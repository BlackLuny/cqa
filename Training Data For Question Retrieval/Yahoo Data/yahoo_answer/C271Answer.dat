MXjvZMUXaa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_m...|`|iIWWeD7Taa	Mainstream European music, using a system of staff notation,  produced in, or rooted in the traditions of Western liturgical and secular music, encompassing a broad period from roughly the 9th century to 1900.|`|naPq2mbtaa	i think classical music is like Beethoven and other musicians from that time|`|1afbbdf95ac24d4f09b64f9e1a7930afaa	Traditionally, Classiscal music is broken down into 3 periods:    1600-1750  Baroque: ex. Bach  1750-1820 Classical: ex. Mozart  1820-1910 Romantic: ex. Chopin    When people discuss "Classical" music, they are usually referencing all three periods, unless they specifically say something like the "Classical Period" or "Classical Era."     Before the Baroque period there was renaissance, and modal music, like chant and things of that nature, but when people discuss classical music, they usually are not including this.     There are also other types of music happening in and between these periods that ARE usually included in the term classical music, like "Impressionist." Impressionist is kind of thought of as a branch off of romantic music and the main impressionist contributer is probably Debussey.    Atonal, Modern, Contemporary, Jazz and Pop were all types of music that were developing at the end of what most people consider classical music. All of this started to blur together and makes it hard to define when one are stops and another begins. For example, Aaron Copeland and Leonard Berstein's music.    There are also people composing today in all sorts of styles, including romantic and classical. Many composers of today could be classified as Neo-Romantic.    So I guess there really isn't a hard and fast definition of what classical definitely is. If I had to define it, I would say it has to be western, have a tonal center, has to use the 12 tone system we use today, and has to fall vaguely between 1600 and 1910.|`|AA11419083	Classical music was music written during the Classical period.  Classical occurred between Baroque and Romantic.  EX: Mozart.

I'd like to just enjoy it without reading too much into what it means or what it stands for.    That's what the bible is for.|`|D1c8cRM4aa	Can you elaborate on this more?

See Goodwin's law...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin%27s_...    It has also been said that The Lion King may be Disney's version of Hamlet.  Some Disney animated movies are pretty smart and have a lot of symbolism and meaning, they are more than just kids fairy tale adventures.|`|btrMdy5Uaa	Thats always been the rumor, the movie is 15 yrs old|`|XxFHAT2aaa	what about mufasa and his family being like the all powerful. and whats that old monkeys name that has the stick.|`|CNotcjbaaa	The movie is supposed to be based on Hamlet, and some people think MacBeth.|`|grTFRJVjaa	wow thats deep i never noticed it but i will keep my eye out

Klw3Ke3Haa	Don't listen to the person below me, licensed animes can still be watched on some sites. You can try sites like veoh, megavideo, youtube, etc. Or you can probably try a blog site or use the power of google to find plenty of useful and helpful sites for you to use. Good Luck!|`|fRVUy8rfaa	Come here: http://watch-tv-show-online.com|`|cgfE0yyzaa	The show Hayate no Gotoku! (dubbed "Hayate the Combat Butler") has been licensed by Bandai Entertainment last year on July, but there were no releases yet on DVDs in Region 1. This means this anime is still not dubbed in English.     I did mention it's been licensed, but I never imply you can't watch it. If I read the question correctly, he's asking for English dub (which doesn't exist... yet), but it's been subbed by SS-Eclipse as they air in 2007-2008, which you can always get from their fansub site or any torrent tracker, DDL mirrors, or streaming.
GS20sIkMaa	According to google  Nick Gigler was their first drummer, apparently they hooked up in high school.  Maybe check wiki to confirm  Good luck.
e0xpYnv1aa	Doubt it, the show is actually doing really well rating wise. Kyle XY is going off the air after this season, so maybe someone got it mixed up.

In Africa, it is customary to put a picture of the jar's contents on the label.  So if there are pickles in the jar, the label would have a picture of a pickle.  This is largely due to the high illiteracy rate in Africa.    So... what does Gerber put on all of their baby food labels again?|`|mYb674PPaa	Don't be silly, protect your Willy!

POXOqhOYaa	Hey ~Skater~. :)    Yes Death Note is one of the better anime shows out there and it's highly worth watching it, it requires some thinking and also has alot of comedy and suspense in it aswell. I would highly suggest it if you haven't watched it or read it yet!     Here's some information about Death Note for you.    -Plot:  Light Yagami is an extremely intelligent young man who resents the crime and corruption in the world. His life undergoes a drastic change when he discovers a mysterious notebook, known as the "Death Note", lying on the ground. The Death Note's instructions claim that if a human's name is written within it, that person shall die. Light is initially skeptical of the notebook's authenticity, but after experimenting with it, Light realizes that the Death Note is real. After meeting with the previous owner of the Death Note, a shinigami named Ryuk, Light seeks to become "the God of the New World" by passing his keen judgment on those he deems to be evil or who get in his way. A shinigami's Death Note is a notebook that can kill any human whose name is written in it. All Death Notes are governed by the same set of rules determining the extents and limitations of the Notes' powers.  Soon, the number of inexplicable deaths of reported criminals catches the attention of the International Police Organization and a mysterious detective known only as "L". L quickly learns that the serial killer, dubbed by the public as "Kira" (derived from the Japanese pronunciation of the word "killer"), is located in Japan. L also concludes that Kira can kill people without laying a finger on them. Light realizes that L will be his greatest nemesis, and a game of psychological cat and mouse between the two begins.    -Main Characters:    Light Yagami  The main character of Death Note, Light is an extremely intelligent but bored 17-year old student. When he finds the Death Note, dropped in the human world by the shinigami Ryuk, he decides to use it to kill all criminals and earns the title Kira. His ultimate goal is to cleanse the world of evil to create a world without criminals and then reign over this new world as its "god."    L  The primary antagonist of the series, L is the world's top-rated detective and tasked with tracking down and arresting Kira. As such, he is Light's arch-enemy. He often takes drastic strategies to confuse and force the hand of his opponents, and his disheveled appearance disguises his brilliance. He enjoys sugar, and in nearly every scene including him, he is found eating cake or confectionery and drinking highly sweetened tea.    Misa Amane  A girl with an immense crush on Kira, Misa is a popular Japanese idol. She is immature and tends to refer to herself in the third person in an attempt to be cute. She is completely devoted to Light, saying that she loved him at first sight, although the feeling is hardly mutual- since Light merely views her as a rather annoying asset    If you want to watch Death Note for free, and with high quality video go to the link below. It's a pretty good site for watching anime shows.    http://www.rawranime.com/category/18/    I hope I helped you out and have a good day!|`|vqg6wpCLaa	Death Note is very good and for a more mature audience.    It is about a young college/university student who excels in everything he does. Top of his class and all that. One day, he finds this notebook called a Death Note. He picks it up and finds mulitple rules written inside. The Death Note kills any human whose name is written in it, is the main rule. Of course, Light Yagami (the student) doesn't quite believe this so he has to try it out himself - it works the first time, on a criminal, who ended up with a heart attack. He does the same to another criminal just to insure that the Death Note actually works, which it does. He plans to destroy all criminals with this new power, and create a heaven on earth.     The  Death Note came from the realm of shinigami (Death Gods), and the Death God who dropped it, Ryuk, had done so to amuse himself. Ryuk then has to stay with Light during the time he is the owner of the Death Note.       Of course, Light can't get away with killing criminals - the FBI and the Japanese want to be rid of this newly found 'Kira' and plan to capture him. Of course, Light being as intelligent as he is, it is very difficult, so they assign L to the case, another genius. Who will win? Kira or L? Read or watch to find out. It's definitely worth it.|`|3N2ElzcQaa	Death Note is good    A lot of psychological events happen. It would be considered a mature manga instead of shonen.|`|f9488cf6c54eb1381e37dcd867602ea9aa	It's one of my favorite shows  has a really mature theme    basically its about this guy named Light  who finds deathnote  When he acquires it, he decides to play God by killing off people he thinks should die  and his enemy L, tries to stop him    at first, a death book does sound kind of stupid but if you watch it, you will become addicted|`|Kgrq92Veaa	death note is really awesome and i agree that the ending wasnt that great but oh well what can you do.    You should also watch:  Blood+  Gintama  Lovely Complex  Bleach  Cardcaptors Sakura  Vampire knight  Tsubasa resevoir Chronicles  Stigma  Elfen Lied|`|Fd0hvyoyaa	OMG it is amazing! It is about a boy called light who finds a notebook (called death note) on the floor. He can write peoples names in them and they die. He can choose how they die and what they do before they die. I can't say too much though because i don't want to give anything away =)|`|xxwb0sCdaa	Yeah It good.|`|xR3IOC3Raa	It was a good show, but I didn't like the ending.  My friend did though, so I guess it's all a matter of opinion.    The story starts out with a boy, Light Yagami, who finds a shinigami's (death god's) notebook.  If you write someone's name in the notebook that person will die.  Light uses the notebook to kill criminals in order to purge the world of evil do-ers and become the God of a new era.  Most of the show is about how the police tries to find Light, known to the public as Kira, who is in fact the son of one of the head cops and an extremely intelligent person.|`|LLO71i1Haa	One of the best animes ever   you can't find something like it ever  Light is so smart sneaky.....you will just be speechless when you keep watching it.  I had a friend who hated watching anime but I kept telling her to watch it and when she finished it, she started search the whole net for something like it but she couldn't   ((( and again it's just an opinion ))) :P|`|GhhbZphuaa	to put it in a simple way...  a guy name light found this notebook called a death note and it belongs to this shinigami name Ryuk  Police force call him kira   the note is used to write a person name's in it, he/she dies in 40 seconds  guy name L trying to stop him  not gonna tell you the rest, you gonna have to see and find out...really awesome show!|`|ZLXgPCP8aa	After L dies, it doesn't seem as exciting, but over all, it is a good series.
2kpr2arRaa	the offical AI website gives Bios of the Judges-- Kara has written several hit songs    One of the industry's most sought after songwriters and producers, Kara DioGuardi's songs have appeared on more than 100 million records. They have been recorded by Grammy award-winning artists, including Kelly Clarkson, Christina Aguilera, Gwen Stefani, Celine Dion, Carrie Underwood, and many more.    Over the last four years, she has been awarded 10 BMI Pop Awards for having written the most performed songs on radio. From her catalog of several hundred songs, over 264 have been released on major labels worldwide; and over 165 have appeared on multi-platinum selling albums. Kara co-owns Arthouse Entertainment, where she develops and mentors fellow hit writers, producers and artists.    "We are turning the heat up on Idol this year and are thrilled to welcome Kara to the judges' table," said creator and executive producer Simon Fuller. "She is a smart, sassy lady, and one of America's most successful songwriters. We know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show."    "We had originally intended for American Idol to have four judges," said executive producer Cecile Frot-Coutaz. "We've seen from our international series that having a fourth judge creates a dynamic that benefits both the contestants and the viewers."    Mike Darnell, President, Alternative Programming of FOX, added, "With Kara by her side, Paula finally has some back-up and now there is going to be a lot more 'girl power' on the show."      http://www.americanidol.com/bio/kara_dio...|`|AopETJqJaa	her name is Kara DioGuardi and shes an american singer/song writer, record producer and tv personality she writes music for pop-rock and dance shes also worked with some contestants and most of the winners of american idol and loads of famous singers like Celine Dion etc    hope I helped     pri|`|17870c3584ae11d39c5493e630a89c34aa	!!!|`|AA12390047	Kara DioGuardi  She's a songwriter, producer, publisher - has a full background in music.

ZyGyDLsDaa	I haven't found a lot about it except this:  Marti Frederiksen provided the lead singing vocals for Jason Lee as Jeff Bebe. We do, however, hear Jason Lee's actual voice singing the song "Cover of the Rolling Stone" when Jeff Bebe learns that Stillwater will make the cover of Rolling Stone magazine.    Peter Frampton taught Billy Crudup how to play the guitar in preparation for the concert scenes.    To look like a real rock band, the four actors in Stillwater rehearsed for four hours a night, five nights a week, for six weeks.    EDIT: Stillwater is credited for the songs, but Stillwater is fictional. Thus, the other actors must have performed the songs~except for Jason Lee, who lip-synched. I had heard that Billy Crudup sings and assumed it was him. In fact, I thought all of them might have been selected. I'm going to check a couple of other sites for a definitive answer~if there is one.     About the first post: Billy Crudup plays the Russell character, so we have a listing for a fictional person in a fictional band singing a song written for the movie. *giggle* Again: There is no real Stillwater~unless a group later took the name as a tribute to the film. Even then, they didn't perform the music.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...  I'll look around some more to see what I can uncover.|`|nDzenpkwaa	A band called Stillwater did!!!    "Fever Dog"  Written by Russell Hammond  Performed by Stillwater  This what the soundtrack says, however the songs were written by Peter Frampton.  There is a lot of info at http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181875/triv...    I know the movie portrays a fictional band, but there IS a southern rock group from the 70's called Stillwater.  I am also well aware of Billy Crudup and him playing the fictional character Russell Hammond.  I listed this way because this is the way, creater, Cameron Crowe listed it on the soundtrack...|`|2stBV6XBaa	According to imdb - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181875/triv...    "Stillwater's songs were written by Peter Frampton (who also had a small part in the film), Cameron Crowe and his wife Nancy Wilson of the rock band Heart, a fact indicated early in the credits although the music acknowledgments credit Russell Hammond and Stillwater as if they were real authors and performers."    "Pearl Jam guitarist Mike McCready provided the guitar track for Stillwater's songs."    There was no information on who did the vocals.    And yes, there really is a band from the '70s called Stillwater, but there seems to be no relation to the movie.

WMrNa3Doaa	It's a song by Suicidal Tendencies.  It's not about the US Army. It's about the fans/followers of the band.  By "joining the army", you're joining the band's "army" of fans. You're backing them up and saying you stand for their ideals. It doesn't have anything to do with the military.|`|vVMgryUlaa	Its a song about joining there "army" of fans,

She's still the same old skanky hoebag.|`|KOYZfaDkaa	I think she means well, but  don't think she's more responsible. If she hadn't made her Prius purchase headline news then I think that would have shown responsibility- doing the right thing without needing to tell everyone about it.

2bKgIMSsaa	If you love someone but there is no chemistry between you, that suggests to me that you are just good friends. If there is no chemistry, how would people come to be dating each other in the first place?<br>  Anyway, if you really believe you are in love with this person, despite there being no chemistry, just tell them what you want them to do in bed. Maybe there is actually chemistry between you but he just doesn't know what to do in bed. <br>  Good luck.|`|JYPrhKrgaa	i would talk to him about it and if it does not get better i would probly dump them but really i don't know, depends on the person.|`|nlKZRNqmaa	I would try to learn or get some tips...|`|rs6CVQ0haa	No keep her|`|5YTkGB5yaa	Sex is just one ingredient in the cake but without you don't have a cake.<br>  So yes I would dump her.|`|8j70Neqeaa	move on|`|Y63Q4bnOaa	I would try and make things work.

Leo and Libra influence I also find can be very attractive|`|B7WIZdglaa	taurus, gemini ,aquarius|`|tIwXLPzFaa	virgos...because they are perfectionists and always look good with very feminine, soft features|`|0HGqGJYTaa	That's silly...anybody can be attractive. All the signs work what they have.    I've seen people in earth, water, fire, and earth stand out equally. It really depends on what you're attracted too. I find that the water signs have beautiful eyes. The earth signs are well put together. Of course, air and fire are a little more extroverted, so it's easy to notice them, not taking anything away from them or their natural beauty.     But, the confidence of an Aries or Capricorn man is something I find incredibly sexy.|`|A3dQS6k2aa	You are best looking in the world|`|LyDd0m7Waa	I find beauty in every sign :)  But the ones that seem to attract me the most  Are Pisces and Aquarius men.  They are both very sexy.    ?
Z5mmaFK0aa	No it should have Dual alnico-magnet humbuckers. Its a whole humbucker as one pickup. One on the neck position and one at the bridge. The D Activator is also a humbucker but its dual single coil as one humbucker. It should be fine tho. I don't know that much about Epiphone I am not fond of Gibson guitars. So as far as the wiring I have no idea I would have to see it. The D Acts are good stuff I also use DiMarzo I use D Sonics|`|ce83aaa18b48dd89e8f2ce5b7f9d7885aa	Did you get a wiring diagram with the new pickup? If not you need to contact DiMarzio and request one. That will show you where the wires go.|`|1400346802cd413252fbe3ead7943e26aa	[S] is right about the pickups in the SG400, but there are quite a few ways to wire them up. Most music stores have a guitar tech that could do it for a reasonable price, plus they can give you other options with the wiring (splitting the coils for a single coil sound, etc) which will give you alot more unique tones to play with. Good Luck and KEEP PLAYING!!!!

b1d94518579dc9e27a499adab10f47e4aa	1. Didn't care for the Kill Bill series, although I can understand why they were popular    2. See above.    3. Love Unbreakable.  In my opinion it is M. Night's greatest directorial effort.  Much better than The Sixth Sense    4. Love this one too.  Bill Murry is fantastic and if it was up to me he should have one an Academy Award over Sean Penn that year (and I'm a huge Sean Penn fan)    5. Haven't got around to seeing this one yet.  It's been on my netflix queue for about a year now...haha.    6. I absolutely adore Magnolia.  This is PTA's masterpiece and he'll be hard pressed to top it.  Every single performance is perfect and it features Tom Cruise at his best.      7. See  5.    8. The Breakfast Club is one of my favorite high school comedies.  Judd T. Nelson was great as Bender (did you know Nicolas Cage was originally supposed to play the role?) and the principal was great.  I'm not a huge fan of the high school comedy but this one is one of my favorites.    9. American Beauty is my 2nd favorite film of all time.  Kevin Spacey deserved every ward he received and Sam Mendes has never been better.  It's a perfect mix of comedy and drama and I think we all wish we could be like Spacey's character from time to time.  And that ending...wow!    10. The Exorcist is my 2nd favorite horror film of all time (behind only Psycho).  I believe it is the scariest film ever made and it used to give me nightmares as a child (and at that time I'd only seen a short clip of it!)  I finally manned up and decided to watch it on netflix one day and boy was I impressed.  Max von Sydow was amazing as the priest and I would have liked to see Linda Blair win the Oscar that year over the other child actor (Tatum O'Neal).    Overall it's a very good list with many films that I love.  American Beauty, The Exorcist, and Magnolia all make my top 100 films list.|`|YkZeA3Jvaa	Here's mine:    1.  The Shawshank Redemption  2.  Star Wars  (1977)  3.  Gran Torino  4.  Rainman  5.  Steel Magnolias  6.  Grumpy Old Men  7.  Die Hard  8.  On Golden Pond  9.  Ferris Bueller's Day Off  10. The Breakfast Club|`|LEQowzHCaa	i agree.    they're all good movies|`|ZtEMJ4ERaa	i'm not trying to knock your taste in movies because those are all very good... but it seems (from your list) as though you haven't seen enough movies to compile a real list... seeing as those movies (with the exception of breakfast club and exorcist) were all made in the last 10 years...     if you believe that prior to 1999 there were no great movies-- i strongly disagree|`|HK4cW2Vcaa	I only agree with 8 and 10, sorry =]    Here's mine ( not in order though)    1. A Clockwork Orange  2. Taxi Driver  3. The Breakfast Club  4. Gone With the Wind  5. The Exorcist  6. The Lion King\  7. The Godfather  8. Lord of the Rings  9. Star Wars  10. Easy rider    I know alot of people would disagree, but his is just in MY opinion.|`|MgpO4FA9aa	I haven't seen most of those. But how could you forget the dark knight, harry potter, and star wars???    Lame list....|`|5ZbaruBgaa	none that you or anyone else stated are top ten worthy    the dark knight  the patriot  braveheart  shawshank redemption  lord of the rings  fight club  saving private ryan  the departed  gladiator  remember the titans  blood diamond  cinderella man   all better then what you said|`|DgBpjcD6aa	Not in order:    1.

Your list is pretty good though|`|nTDHmepsaa	my favorite films of all time:  1). The Comebacks.  2). Failure To Launch.  3). An American Carol.  4). My Best Friend's Girl.  5). Made of Honor.  6). Meet The Spartans.  7). Superbad.  8). You Don't Mess With Zohan.  9). Forgetting Sarah Marshall.  10). Zack and Miri Make A Porno.|`|f2c03d5c2b6c415dede17268613279ecaa	You have listed 8 great american movies from the last 10 years and two reasonable slightly older ones. (Although I am not sure about the Kill Bills v Reservoit Dogs or Pulp Fiction).  Did you know that films were made before the 1970s?  There were also many great movies made outside the US.    Try  1. The Bank Dick  2. Rashomon  3. 2001 A Space Odyssey  4. Night For Day  5. The Maltese Falcon  6. Duck Soup  7. Raise Ravens  8. Nashville  9. A Fish Called Wanda  10. La Dolce Vita|`|thzg9hRGaa	I Don't agree, sorry    These are mine, in no particular order:    The Godfather  Rocky  Rudy  Scarface  Do The Right Thing  The Professional  Forrest Gump  Superbad  Boyz N Da Hood  American Pie|`|Vo4IXBdtaa	i haven't seen any of these.

These are my top 10 movies:  1.Return to oz  2.The silence of the lambs   3.The dark crystal   4.The pianist   5.Willow   6.Hannibal   7.The chronicles of riddick  8.The nightmare before christmas   9.The labyrinth   10.oldboy|`|G9sd4Nlkaa	To be honest, I only agree with a few that you mentioned. The Exorcist was a little slow in my opinion, but it was still intriguing and fun to watch over and over again.     My list: (Not In Order)    Repo: The Genetic Opera  Braveheart  Dragonheart  The Doors  Interview With a Vampire  Across The Universe  Princess Mononoke  Slumdog Millionare  Transformers  Jaw Breaker  Catacombs|`|nDzenpkwaa	I don't agree at all...  But hey everyone walk to their own beat... Mine are  1. Fight Club  2. The Big Lebowski  3. Godfather 2  4. Godfather 1  5. Good Fellas  6. The Return of the Jedi  7. Blazing Saddles  8.

BWVDKixeaa	Oh definately smell as my strongest. I smell things before other people or smell things other people can't.  People smell to me and sometimes I get a smell from no where and I am reminded of people.<br>  <br>  Hearing is my worst. I can't hear people when there is too much music or other noise.  Other people talk over it but I have lots of trouble. I get very frustrated.|`|o8o689x5aa	Let's see. I'm going deaf, so that ain't it. I wear glasses, so the eyes are out.

qjMfGcsbaa	This is a great interview from before the show starts when Conan visits Letterman and they talk about how unknown he is.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsayU6GLcwM&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsayU6GLc...</a><br>  <br>  And this is the first part of the first episode. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AWV792CC44&feature=channel" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AWV792CC...</a><br>  It's really funny how nervous Conan is.<br>  <br>  I've got some old episodes on my computer too, from 94 and the special shows like the 10th aniversary and the episode where he visits finland. If you're interested in something specific I could see if I have it and probably cut out some short parts and send over msn or something.
1WgOj89kaa	an artist that is not signed to a record label and releases albums independantly|`|4fc129ccfffdb16cb2d28a6fe0c55cdeaa	It could mean a person who sings alone - a solist, paying people for the instrumental part .<br>  <br>  OR<br>  A person who manages him/herself and funds himself, sometimes not depending on a label to launch and promote them, or on people to write their lyrics and music.<br>  <br>  There are many degrees of how independent an artist can be.|`|HThsIBrsaa	An artist on an independent record label... not a major one. A lot of major record labels have indie 'sublabels' though.

Ga11Abmzaa	I think it was the one where there was someones voice talking about sponge bob and how to cook a krabby patty.|`|wzM5WB8Xaa	The first episode was Help Wanted/Reef Blower/Tea at the Treedome. Spongebob applies for a job at the krusty krab, uses a reef blower to clean his front lawn, and meets a squirrel named Sandy.|`|f1fd9f1cf1a58e760d7ffd75daa60953aa	help Wanted/Reef Blower/Tea at the Treedome|`|f4ehvRQlaa	i think the first episode was when he saw the help wanted sign for the krusty krab restaurant and he wanted to work there, and that he first met sandy cheeks and he got trapped in her house full of air and he was drying up. something like that.|`|cU2mZfdNaa	ya it was the one when he wakes up and goes to apply to work in the krusty krab and mr krabs tells him he can only work if he gets this make believe super spatula. then spongebob goes to get it and a load of buses of anchovies come and start wrecking the place up for burgers and then spongebob comes back with the spatula and make like a million burgers in a minute and he saves the day and gets the job  it was clalled "help wanted" theres 2 more episodes attached to it "reef blower" and "tea at the tree dome" but "help wanted" was the first|`|Fd0hvyoyaa	I think it was when spongebob applys to work in the krusty krab.|`|3qmRKPciaa	SpongeBob aired its first episode, "Help Wanted/Reef Blower/Tea at the Treedome", after the 1999 Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards.|`|qmp44mhOaa	"Help Wanted/Reef Blower/Tea at the Treedome", after the 1999 Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards.|`|ZmYTngnFaa	I'm not sure, but I think it may be the episode where he meets sandy for the first time, where she gets stuck in a clam, spongebob tries to save her, but she uses karate and gets out on her own  :)|`|pbqsiqt2aa	He meets sandy in the treedome, the tea|`|tcCKYmHAaa	The first Spongebob episode was Help Wanted, Reef Blower, and Tea at the Treedome. All of these were in one episode.|`|CVKGpg3qaa	SpongeBob wants to work at the local restaurant, "The Krusty Krab," and with a little help from Patrick, is on his way. But Mr. Krabs and Squidward don't want him there. They send him out to do a job of picking a special spatula. In the meantime, some anchovies are coming by, and are hungry. SpongeBob must feed them all to get the job and save Mr. Krabs and Squidward    There's a small clam shell in Squidward's yard and he carelessly kickes it into SpongeBob's yard. SpongeBob gets out his trusty reef blower. Squidward always seems to get the worst end of everything as SpongeBob's reef blower goes crazy and messes up Squidward's yard - all because Squidward was lazy and kicked that one small clamshell in SpongeBob's yard    SpongeBob meets a squirrel named Sandy, who breathes air. SpongeBob, trying to impress her, tells her he breathes air. The only problem is that he doesn't know what air is. She invites him over to her treedome, and he can't say no. Patrick gives him useless tips on how to be fancy and SpongeBob goes on over for some tea and cookies. Slowly when there, he is shriveling up and desperately searches for water. Patrick comes in to tell him he is not being fancy enough and they both shrivel up. Sandy comes up with a quick solution to the problem.
FDokzmLGaa	Theory of a Deadman: I Hate My Life  Lyrics:  So sick of the hobos always begging for change  I don't like how I gotta work and  They just sit around and get paid  I hate all of the people who can't drive their cars.  ***** you better get outta the way  Before I start falling apart    I hate how my wife is always up my ***  She always wants to buy brand new things  But I don't have the cash.    I hate my job, all of my rich friends  I hate everyone to the bitter end.  Nothing turns out right There's no end in sight  I hate my life!    How come I never get laid nice guys always lose.  How could she have another headache  There's always some kind of excuse  I still hate my job, my boss is a dick  "I don't get paid nearly enough  To put up with all of your ****"    I hate my job, all of my rich friends  I hate everyone to the bitter end.  Nothing turns out right There's no end in sight  I hate my life!    I hate that I can't tell when a girl's underage,  You know, I tell her she's a nice piece of ***,  Then her daddy punches me in the face    So if you're pissed like me  Bitches, here's what you gotta do  Put your middle fingers up in the air  Go on and say "**** you!"    I hate my job, all of my rich friends  I hate everyone to the bitter end.  Nothing turns out right There's no end in sight  I hate my life!    So much at stake, can't catch a break  I hate my life  No, it's nothing new hear " it sucks to be you"  I fuckin hate my life|`|Swu3Wvhoaa	"I Hate My Life" by Theory of a Deadman|`|ii18DX69aa	Theory of a Deadman, I hate my life|`|f3Y0mEu3aa	ii hate my life....theory of a deadman

Blink 182 is known for having strange songs.  I would recommend Cute is What We Aim For- it's a little out there as far as lyrics go (they are kinda strange), but catchy and popular.  Trapt is a lot like Three Days Grace, too.|`|q2z1YCK1aa	If you like Apocalyptica, check out Emilie Autumn. She is a Victorian-Industrial violinist/singer/composer. Very original. Very good.|`|ak0T96CQaa	I highly doubt you like both Green Day (Mainstream rock) and Cannibal Corpse (Brutal Death Metal) props to you if you really do though.|`|HysVH9qLaa	I like the Ramones, the Clash and Nirvana|`|xliYPI7Vaa	sum 41|`|N4IlzLQjaa	6 bands I would recommend for you:    +44 (Blink-182, excluding DeLonge, formed this band after the breakup)    Breaking Benjamin    Seether    Good Charlotte    Slipknot (their lead singer is featured in one of Apocalyptica's hit songs)    Jack's Mannequin|`|YlCgMDVwaa	OMG i thought yew wer going to list actual talented bands
c4badecf0c276e73f5192cea25fac6edaa	Violence: PG-13  Language: PG  Romance: G (I don't think there is any)    All in all I would say PG-13. It is mostly for the violence because it takes place during WWII, there is some language but nothing to bad, and like no romance at all (it's about a boy and his little sister).

u6xS3eeGaa	Ihtisham T [is a hater]<br>  <br>  &<br>  <br>  For Gemini: The Moon child is far too moody and sensitive for your fickle ways. You are not a homebody like the Crab. You have totally different interests then a Cancer. <br>  <br>  For Cancer: The Twins play too many mind games for your soft and innocent approach to life. Gemini's flirtatious free-spirited nature is just too hurtful for you to have to deal with.<br>  <br>  Cancer is sensitive at love and Gemini’s roving eye would wound Cancer. Cancer needs security and Gemini will not be tied down. Cancer is moody and Gemini has a sharp tongue. Not a good match. Passionate Cancer fulfills Gemini’s physical needs, and Gemini’s cheerfulness brightens Cancers disposition. Gemini is flirtatious and would wound Cancer’s sensitive nature. Cancer needs security and Gemini hates to be tied down.<br>  <br>  This match does not have great chances of lasting. You will at first be attracted to the Cancer boy’s deep and passionate nature. He’s a real sweetie on the surface. Unfortunately, you are a big flirt and even though you don’t mean anything by it, he won’t believe you. Cancer boys are unbelievably clingy and they get very suspicious very easily. He’ll accuse you of being interested in other boys and trying to sneak out on him. When he won’t believe your explanations, you’re get tired of this guy fast. Not a good match.<br>  <br>  While you'll have no problems in the attraction department, Gemini girl may sometimes feel as if she's more in the know than her Cancer companion.  Cancers need to feel loved and supported, so avoid harmless flirting with other guys unless you're ready to leave dodge.  Honor thy Cancer (and never say an unkind word about his mom!)  and you've got the makings of a partnership of enduring value.|`|sIJ6jxNdaa	i don′t think you two are compatible but maybe it would work the horoscopes are not always right so good luck|`|zakIuo91aa	your not a princess<br>  an your not compaible.

i7iQmSgIaa	WOW,Wierd! I was listening to Hey Joe today,thinking how ive loved the song for 30 odd yrs,and was like thinking the same as you,distinctive voice,like david ruffin,or jimmy ellis,Hendrix was great in all ways,a phenomenom,WHAT A VOICE!|`|I5PYvCz8aa	He had a good voice, and he always found a way to fit the song.  When you think about it, would you really have wanted anyone else doing the singing?  He sang with a convincing level of confidence that's managed to sell me on everything of his I've ever heard -- confidence that matched his playing, I think.|`|IARPr7k5aa	you know the thing with hendrix, is herwas a great performer and towards the end that's all people wanted to see, was him playing with his teeth and light guitars on fire. i do think he's a great singer, but many people over look that just for the sheer entertainment.|`|iT31pFLqaa	i liked his voice but everyone knew the guitar stole the show...|`|aQcsrgLCaa	No.|`|wqg3GrI2aa	Studio = I would agree<br>  Live = Not really, he had a very limited vocal range<br>  <br>  Although I still do find it amazing how he played his awesome riffs and sang at the same time, it's the ultimate skill.
Y63Q4bnOaa	If I'm on a shorter flight, window. If I'm on a longer flight then aisle. If I'm on a long flight, I like aisle because I can get up whenever I want.

f02fdd44028e78a86a13cf15a8da31e7aa	The reason is people don't report these incidences.<br>  You can be the one to help get this vicious dog off the street.<br>  Call your local dog catcher or the police and let them know what happened. <br>  <br>  They will contact the owner of the dog and make him be more cautious while walking his dog, (such as wearing a muzzle). If he refuses to cooperate and gets to many complaints then the dog will be taken away from him.<br>  <br>  The owners never think what they are doing is wrong. That's why we have laws to make sure no one gets hurt. This man obviously thinks it's fun to watch the fear in people because of his dogs behavior. One day the dog WILL bite someone. He'll either let the dog loose on purpose or he'll "accidentally" get loose.<br>  <br>  Because the owner is actively encouraging his dogs behavior, if he does get loose he may even kill someone.<br>  If I were you I would report what happened right away. <br>  <br>  Even if you don't know the owner of the dog just tell them what kind of dog and where it happened and they'll take a look around that neighborhood in search of the dog.<br>  I hope you help get this dog off the street before someone gets hurt.<br>  Good luck.|`|akM9EZ8Gaa	Coz they think they tuff owning a dangerous dog, then get bored of it and it cant be rehomed because it labelled "Dangerous" and get put down after a couple of weeks because the owner's a horrible person<br>  <br>  I'm sorry i hate people like that :)|`|uLHyDOm1aa	caus some retarded farmers <br>  have a massive beautiful beachy-feild in spain<br>  and when people walk through it for a romantic stroll<br>  five of his vicous dogs come running and snarling<br>  and your scared to death and are forced<br>  to never go back to that beach );<br>  it could happen you know...|`|jdsRkyKzaa	LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO...|`|z2cysiEhaa	Its MACHO!<br>  But i feel sorry for the poor dogs as they are usually badly mistreated by their owners to become the way they are.|`|ufdFei1jaa	A snarling dog is not illegal and only certain breeds require a muzzle in public. he should not be intimidating people like that though. if you have fears then contact yor local council.|`|JMVkZJzUaa	You're absolutely right.  Was it Michael Vick?<br>  <br>  Never be scared of animals, but always respect them|`|mh5NOsWzaa	...for what just happened|`|JhJs2cnmaa	Some people use dogs as a status symbol and to look 'hard'. Some even fight their dogs which is so cruel! The police and RSPCA are supposed to be cracking down on illegal dogs but they'll never find they all. <br>  <br>  Dogs like that should be destroyed! I love dogs but if they could kill a human, why should they be aloud to live?|`|dcb5b306dda3b53ee6156c20da765b8baa	some people just like vicious dogs. Until it bites someone there really isn't much you can do. You could take a video of the dog being really nasty and send it in. Though not too sure how that would work out.|`|XN0sRoqpaa	he is showing off.<br>  <br>  call the police. seriously, before something bad happens|`|6utYCsK0aa	Just out of personal fancy for the dog.|`|CPxmHjx4aa	if the dogs havent attacked anyone or anything they arent illegal..<br>  i had a german shepherd that was trained as a watchdog and she was about that way...all the owner has to do is keep the dog away from people and make sure the dog never gets loose...<br>  people have vicious dogs for their protection..|`|2xaVpnNNaa	its still sad about this boy that was mauled to death a few years ago, by a bunch of vicious dogs.<br>  <br>  i dont think any dog is really vicious. they just have vicious owners that misuse them.<br>  <br>  im not sure why he has a dog like that, maybe something bad happened to him before and he is like a guard dog for him.|`|g0qIAWhmaa	i know ! , twice this man has bought his crazy dog (definitely part pit-bull) to my kids school , their morons who shouldn't be allowed to have a pet . i reported it to the head teacher and also told the police ,  who have done nothing so far .<br>  it's no wonder little kiddies get killed by dangerous animals when no-one wants so anything about them .|`|lFqUMMAGaa	I think underneath they are cowards who have vicious dogs because they think they look cool and untouchable ~ but they are really thugs who should have the dogs taken away ~<br>  I would avoid that estate if you can ~|`|o2sGJqGYaa	Because the don't understand what illegal dogs means and the refuse to learn|`|Qlyh3pG0aa	So they can look tough behind theyre scary dogs.

tK7XacH7aa	I absolutely love it. A lot of people need help and I'm here to help in whatever way I can. Also, while I do give advice to others I do learn a lot of things from what people ask and from what people answer to certain questions. It's a learning experience for both sides. It also tests how I look at things and tries to get me to look at it in a different way. Especially the philosophy category. Some things are interesting and can expand your views. My specialty the Singles and Dating category I can learn things about what happens in relationship and it really gets me to think about what I would do if I were in that persons situation. I thinking about expanding just a bit, but for right now I'm doing the best I can to help others and learn something for myself as well. It's also a good place where I can ask questions and hope someone can answer them well.

The air is a lot easier to breath, and there is always a shopping mall.  Plus, I think moon pies are horrible, but I love pecan pies.  Also, it is much cooler here than on the sun.  Plus it's hard to sleep there, since it's always light outside.  I will say, though, I wouldn't mind trying out living on Uranus.|`|XJ0Nux6Naa	Life on Earth is normal. You have your ups and downs, you fall in love, you get heart broken. but the beat goes on.

Go to the video, and slip "kiss" between "www." and "youtube", so it'll be www.kissyoutube.com__________. Click download, and then convert it to the format you want at www.media-convert.com (free). Use mp4 for iPod.                                                                                                              I used to get my songs and videos off Limewire, but you shouldn't if you have Eircom, because record companies signed a deal that Eircom would disconnect anyone who used "peer to peer sharing sites", like limewire. Luckily, YouTube isn't one of those sites. Good luck|`|y0YRQYPKaa	well you can download a thing called "youtube video downloader" and you just type in the url of the video you want from youtube and it is pretty good quality (this is what i do) and it works for me very well and the software also has a built in convrter so you can just convert the video after you have downloaded it and quickly added it to your itunes library<br>  hope this helps!|`|ATh0ciALaa	yip google limewire.com download that and you can get pics,songs,movies programs nything ur heart desires

yedvfKTwaa	We all feel like this...and then we wake up. I was going to say you have to be really young. And there you go. Just 16. When you grow up you'll probably be corrupted by the rest of the world to think that only money matters and never mind who you *beep* in the process. They will change you. Those that are cynics, those whose dreams failed, those who will come to be around you and who won't want you to succeed because it will mean that they are failures. 99% of people on the planet are like that negative, on drugs, ruthless, care only about themselves and their profit. If you can save your soul and  hang on to your beliefs then you will make it. We are all destined for greatness but most of us sell out. The question remains...<br>  <br>  ...will you?  (Now you are aware. If you watch out for "them" and keep your vision no matter what, that's the only way to make it. But will you let a vision of money corrupt you? Or will you be the next Obama? Yes you can...but will you?)<br>  <br>  I wish you well.|`|jpTl3o5naa	Success is defined as what you want it to be. You can be successful as a parent, a sister, a friend, a relative or anything else. Whether it is big or small, you can make a difference. We all should want to be the best we can be, no matter what you choose. At your age, you can have your dreams become a reality. Don't give up on your dreams. Make a dream a reality. You have the time and the brains, so use them . Make a plan and don't just dream.<br>  My biggest successes are teaching and being a mother and grandmother.

Sinitta's not trying to be Kate Bush, or Joni Mitchell." and my favorite, from Caroline Sullivan's revue: "Sinitta could... be in your life, if you happen to be a 15 year old with a taste for white shoes and a sister called 'Chelle'. (With lyrics) that are spot-on reflections of a lifestyle that's traditionally dismissed with exquisite scorn by us middle-class elitists."<br>  <br>  It was Simon Cowell, who gave me my first BIG break in the business, by granting me free-reign over the Sinitta LP, based solely upon a couple phone calls between us and my enthusiasm for the project. Donna granted me the permission for use of her entire SAW LP, right after that. Then Hot Tracks' offer of Producer derailed my own company plans. So I took the tracks with me, when I went to work for HT and assembled the meat of Hot Tracks' Issue No. 8-2. With songs by Sinitta, Kylie Minogue, Donna Summer, Samantha Gilles and Love & Kisses. A heavy-handed, candy-floss collection, indeed! That commenced a change in direction and the start of a new identity for Hot Tracks.<br>  <br>  Issue 8-2 pulled the company out of relative obscurity... filled a looming financial hole... was one of (if not the) fastest issue sell-outs in Hot Tracks' history... as well as bringing myself and the company, our first National Hi-NRG Awards. And when I listen to those mixes now, I cringe at the blatant lack of skills. (Thankfully, I got to re-create and clean-up the Donna mix, for CD release.) But the ideas were there. Enough so, to take Donna Summer, on the Hot Tracks label, all the way to No. 2 on the DMR / Hi-NRG Top 25. Only to be replaced on the charts by the commercial 12", with it's release the same week it hit No.1.<br>   project 2 for you  <br>  Panic! at the Disco are a pop /*****/butthole fingereing /fudge packing/ Vegetarian Progressive Grindcore Liberal Democrat supporting band from Uganda, Africa. They are the only known band to make a "song" about closing doors a "hit". They are also notorious for popping up too often when people are looking for disco music, although why people would be looking for disco music is anyone's guess.<br>  The members! of Panic! at the Disco are not technically human, since they were created! using an experimental product from Apple called iClone. Fall Out Boy bassist Pete Wentz! was able to gain access to a prototype! by sucking off Steve Jobs over a period of 3! months (often being forced to wear a wig! while being called Steve Wozniak).<br>  Unfortunately, Pete Wentz left the cloning vats for several decades (whilst checking his myspace!) which resulted in the entire batch developing a hideous mutant capacity to not only hijack but ruin any airwaves / radio transmitters / virgins in their immedeate vicinity.<br>  In order to give this new band! a fa?ade of originality, he locked the clones in a room! for 5 weeks with nothing but a record album by the Canadian Arsonist/Terrorist/Indie Rock band Arcade Fire. When later asked about how having a group of Fall Out Boy clones listening to the Arcade Fire would constitute originality!, Wentz started crying and slashed his wrists. The other members of Fall Out Boy have yet to comment! on the issue.<br>  Their music was developed! by S. P. Lunker, an employee of Egregious Music Incorporated (EMI), where the official name of Panic! at the Disco's music is Generic Emo-Punk 24621552. It was developed to increase the company's profits and counteract good music, as Lunker and other members of EMI had been fighting the evil "War Against Music" since the The Battle! of Los Angeles was released by Rage! Against the Machine.<br>  With the help of notorious club DJs! Vladimir Lenin and Jar Jar Binks (famous for "discovering" the "singing" "sensation" Ashlee Simpson), the Panic! At The Disco clones entered a disco club in Scotland and proceeded to play their music! in the middle of the dance floor. This "music" brainwashed! all of the patrons of the disco club, immediately causing the patrons to style their hair into comb-overs, dye it black, and slit their wrists while sounding as if their testicles! (or clitorises for female patrons) had been chopped off and their heads filled with mediocre 80's dance-pop.<br>  Following the release! of their first album, Panic! at the Disco became a phenomenon destroying music! as we know it. The band's popularity is mainly due to the strong support it receives from homosexuals, Da Cock, Michael Richards, and whiny 14 year old girls. Many experts believe Panic! at the Disco has been the cause of widespread kitten huffing among suburban youths with unlimited disposable income, while others b|`|c3DqvgE4aa	Disco Is a genre of dance music that originated in and was initially popular among African American, gay and Hispanic communities in the United States in the late 1960s.[13][14][11][15][16] In what is considered a forerunner to disco style clubs, in February 1970 New York City DJ, David Mancuso, opened The Loft, a members-only private dance club set in his own home.[17][18] Most agree that the first disco songs were released in 1973, though some claim Manu Dibango's 1972 Soul Makossa to be the first disco record.[6] The first article about disco was written in September 1973 by Vince Aletti for Rolling Stone Magazine.[19][20] In 1974 New York City's WPIX-FM premiered the first disco radio show.[21]<br>  <br>  Musical influences include funk and soul music. The disco sound has soaring, often reverberated vocals over a steady "four-on-the-floor" beat, an eighth note (quaver) or sixteenth note (semi-quaver) hi-hat pattern with an open hi-hat on the off-beat, and a prominent, syncopated electric bass line sometimes consisting of octaves. Strings, horns, electric pianos, and electric guitars create a lush background sound. Orchestral instruments such as the flute are often used for solo melodies, and unlike in rock, lead guitar is rarely used.<br>  <br>  Well-known late 1970s disco performers included Bee Gees, Amanda Lear, Donna Summer and The Jacksons. Summer would become the first well-known and most popular female disco artist, and also played a part in pioneering the electronic sound that later became a part of disco (see below). While performers and singers garnered the lion's share of public attention, the behind-the-scenes producers played an equal, if not more important role in disco, since they often wrote the songs and created the innovative sounds and production techniques that were part of the "disco sound".[22] Many non-disco artists recorded disco songs at the height of disco's popularity, and films such as Saturday Night Fever and Thank God It's Friday contributed to disco's rise in mainstream popularity and ironically the beginning of its commercial decline.|`|34035663e26abeec23f93fbc75e7e6b9aa	paul van dyk - for an angel<br>  the quest - c sharp:)

76140b1733cd124dbe960a504bc06f8daa	Listen, a lot of people enjoyed that film. A lot of people didn't enjoy it. <br>  <br>  So you dislike the film; you hated it. OK. But have you noticed what you wrote? - the real question here is: why are you feeling so overly hostile?  Why are you so angry about others liking a movie that you do not? You're actually taking their enjoyment of this movie as if it were a personal attack on you. But look - no one is attacking you at all. It might be a good thing to ask yourself why are you responding this way? <br>  <br>  So what if people like this movie? Listen dude, that doesn't make them creeps. Just like if you love a movie that others don't care for. THAT does not make YOU a creep. Have you ever considered this? So take it easy.  Likewise, just because you dislike something doesn't make it crap. We all like some things, we all dislike other things. So what of it?  If you don't like something, that's your point of view. But your point of view doesn't make it bad, or good, or anything. It's your preference.<br>  <br>  You really should consider why you're over-reacting. Try to cultivate an open mind.  That doesn't mean you have to like everything; but it does mean you accept the world as it really is - that you will like some things & dislike others, and allow for all the variety that comes in movies, food, tv shows, etc.  And if you really dislike something, you'll come across more intelligently, and more forcefully, if you describe why something isn't so good. 'Crap' and 'creeps' are cheapshot words, and beneath you.|`|tITPAbeKaa	it's an entertaining movie, that's why people love it. It's got a happy ending and a classic tale of the underdog coming out on top.<br>  <br>  But i do agree with you, acting of the adult actors were mediocre at best (the child actors were great though) and the fact that they suddenly started talking english in the middle of the movie, the main guy having a british accent no less, just spoilt the whole movie. So unbelievable-but i guess people in the west don't get how unrealistic it is for a chaiwalla to talk perfect english. With such a HUGE mistake in it, i don't get how people are saying it is such a good movie.<br>  <br>  Edit: Also people think that by watching it they are suddenly in on the *big* secret on how people in India live. Quite naive. But i guess it must be an eye-opener or novel thing for people who don't live in this part of the world. For the ones who do...it's all a matter of been there, done that. Or seen it at least.|`|8ChAefLOaa	precisely!! its CRAAAAAAAAPPPPPP who wants to watch a load of guff about india and millionaire and some stupid indian boy who hasnt had any accredited acting training.|`|YtE7YXJWaa	I liked it because I am a grown up and not a little boy|`|sA3ae7eQaa	its because it is letting people know about what happened and what still is happening. I watched it yesterday it was sad but it got the message though.|`|0VHolTVEaa	Because it real life, people in India are living like that and thats the reality, they cant afford homes and live in slums areas surrounded by garbage and rats. The movie inspires us and we see the world in a different light. Also the story line is great, its shows what really happens and can happen in real life.

17281684a8c9fb76859999f1be18c50aaa	Rather than buying a guitar she's never seen, you might take her to a music store and have her "try out" various guitars. That way she can find a guitar that feels right -- because if she doesn't like holding it, she won't like playing it.<br>  <br>  But there are a few qualities to look at:<br>  <br>  1. Don't go to Wal-Mart. A First Act guitar is not worth getting. At all. The wood is cheap, the tuners are cheap, the sound is... You get the point.<br>  <br>  2. Since she has smaller hands, you're going to want a smaller guitar. There are a lot of really good 3/4 size guitars out there with a good sound.<br>  <br>  3. What kind of playing will she be doing? Unless she's going to be finger-picking everything (no picks), then avoid a classical guitar like the plague. Yes, the nylon strings are easier on the fingertips, but the necks tend to be wider, the actions higher, and are over-all a pain in the butt.<br>  <br>  You may want to check out MusiciansFriend's Acoustic Buyer's Guide, (<a href="http://www.musiciansfriend.com/document?doc_id=99529)" rel="nofollow">http://www.musiciansfriend.com/document?...</a> as there's a lot of information for beginners to look at.

sK4S86piaa	Steven, as much as i can brag about this movie, it's never gonna change right? It's still going to be permanently unchanged no matter how many people criticize it. I just thought that this movie was a good attempt since thay had a low budget (37 million i guess)..but suprisingly it had come up as sucessful as other huge movies, for example 'the dark knight' (for a 100 million budget!) haha i don't know if the sucess were mostly from obsessed female fans..whatever it is, im excited for new moon. Double budget - 50 million. A new director. Hoping it to be good though.|`|tLI94qWNaa	The movie ruined the books for me, I read the books before the movie ever came out, and I was so obsessed with the books.  The movie was terrible, the acting was terrible.  I hate the actors they picked, and now they are making new moon.  I just hope they do better the second time around, if they can.|`|EilAm0Dkaa	Not half as good as the book.<br>  To me this film was just two teens staring at each other for 122 min<br>  =l<br>  At least in the book something happens!<br>  <br>  ----<br>  <br>  However people need to take into acount that it's BASED on a book. It's a film ADAPATION. That means it doesn't have to follow the book at all. They could have just taken a few ideas.<br>  ---<br>  Film wise though, I don't think Kristen Stewart should have been Bella. There's much better people suited to the role.|`|xPlnXwEfaa	the twilight movie waz SOOO not as good the books,they got alice's hair all wrong,it shoul be black.they got bella wrong,thats just my opione.and they left out a L-O-T of detail in the movie,the books were W-A-Y better!|`|QlN0XWxiaa	I prefered the books|`|NPhepcBkaa	It was ok but not great.<br>  Books better|`|1K18X6Hqaa	I personally loved it. People keep on saying it's not as good as the book and stuff and they're probably right, but I didn't read the first Twilight book so I wouldn't know. But yeah, people need to stop complaining about how the book was better and that the movie sucked compared to it, because everybody knows that the book is usually better than the movie of it.|`|JpYrwt1Caa	I really liked the movie. I saw it then read the books and it is a lot different but movies always are. They could never fit all that in one movie. I really don't see the problem with kristen playing Bella. Yeah some parts seemed like bad acting but if you really understand the character of Bella then you know she is clumsy and awkward and I think this is what they were trying to get across in the movie. She was meant to act like that. I understood that part and hadn't even read the books yet.|`|LKgC9VQdaa	It was fluffy teenage dribble based of a slow and dull series of books that has partially ruined the vampire genre of movies and I can't believe I watched it for 5 minutes an awful film, I even found sex in the city more appealing to watch

IARPr7k5aa	if that's the one with human on it then yeah it wasn't as good as i thought it would be. i only like 3 songs on it. hot fuss and sams town were the best.  BTW, they are amazing in concert!|`|m4nKkFDUaa	I saw them last night (am wearing a Day and Age T-Shirt right now!) and they were fantastic! The general opinion is that Sam's Town wasn't good on the whole, and I agree, and that they returned to form with Day and Age, which is similar to Hot Fuss in genre, and is the style they do best. If you don't like Day and Age, you're probably gonna be disappointed with their future albums.|`|gu2MmdRFaa	It wasnt their best album!<br>  I love the killers!|`|aQCTR0Heaa	no me too. they used to be very good now they not|`|zpIrU1yCaa	How can you make a proper decision if you haven't given it a fair chance?  I am a huge Killers fan and can honestly say I didn't like Day & Age until I had listened to it about 5 times, but now I love it.  <br>  <br>  And by the way, Sawdust was not a 'real' album - it was b-sides and rarities and no-one classes it as a full album.
CzLvqFFsaa	it depends on the character. it's a good name if the character comes from a rich or middle class family or if he is british|`|LbZtEIdqaa	The "Clifford Edwin" name is a so realistic for a fantasy name. If you want to make fantasy names, just make sure the name is rare, and if possible, do not extract names from real people. You need imagination to create your own fantasy names, like Cliffer Erderwin, for example.|`|8ZwscVWSaa	<a href="http://getinfo.knows.it" rel="nofollow">http://getinfo.knows.it</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website|`|l2iClWRUaa	Cole Conners<br>  notice in a lot of comic books first and last name start with same letter|`|yUkphPkiaa	No it sounds far to british and tame.

It's usually a disapointment if not an outright disaster!<br>  <br>  One can argue that AC/DC was just as good if not better when BnB came out.|`|vOPZXZ8taa	I prefer Highway to Hell|`|fJPc6Iayaa	Back in Black is def my favorite!|`|ME4XWNmRaa	It was their biggest selling album but i think their best was Powerage, it is loaded with great songs!

AA11440601	No.<br>  <br>  I think Catholics would think you were a murderer.<br>  <br>  Properly translated from the original Hebrew, the phrase is: You shall not murder. Look at a Jewish version of the Ten Commandments: <a href="http://www.hebrew4christians.com/Scripture/Torah/Ten_Cmds/ten_cmds.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hebrew4christians.com/Scriptu...</a><br>  <br>  The commandment "You shall not kill" forbids direct and intentional killing as gravely sinful. The murderer and those who cooperate voluntarily in murder commit a sin that cries out to heaven for vengeance. (Gen 4:10)<br>  <br>  Killing in self defense, a just war, and lawful capital punishment are not considered murder.<br>  <br>  However many Christians including Catholics believe most modern governments no longer need to use capital punishment to protect society from criminals.<br>  <br>  For more information, see the Catechism of the Catholic Church, sections 2258 and following: <a href="http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt3sect2chpt2art5.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt3s...</a><br>  <br>  With love in Christ.|`|aYVVwjBXaa	you would only be a hero until you got caught, then you would be crucified and condemned so that the people who benefited from your cleansing of the wicked could maintain their rightous stand against all crime.<br>  <br>  being a hero requires huge sacrifices, often including your reputation and freedom. it requires you to do what is necessary but unpalatable to most. i wish you luck.
a6j7Bu9daa	You obviously have never been to america and dont know what your talking about. I moved here (california) from the uk last year and cant go anywhere without seeing an american flag, id be lucky to see one in a whole day in england|`|gGZz2EGyaa	Good heavens you are on a roll today, what part of the USA have you been to.  One thing you cannot say is that the Americans are unpatriotic, they are most patriotic nation in the world. Where ever you go in the USA you see the flag flying, even in the gardens of their homes.  How many times do you see a flag flying in this country? (England).  Sorry have to disagree with you on this question.|`|kJ4g1vujaa	I don't know why you are saying this.  Americans are far more patriotic than the British.  Most of us don't even know the second verse of our anthem or how to hang our flag the right way up.|`|3890f326e072192e79ea3f718551dfb8aa	The average American does not believe it is acceptable to burn the flag and most would cringe at the idea of a toilet seat painted like a flag. <br>  <br>  In most cases where you see someone desecrating the flag, or some other national symbol, it's intended to be a protest against the government, rather than against the country as a whole. <br>  <br>  I don't feel the need to wave a flag or say the Pledge of Allegiance every day. And in recent years I have felt disgust at the way my government has represented the country in foreign matters. But I love this country and what it stands for.|`|W7BZcdynaa	"Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel"<br>  <br>  I've seen a lot of people die for their country.

I coudlnt imagine a US flag in a toilet that you could piss on, but i guess you have pointed my view on US patrioism in a different direction.|`|547Ln6rNaa	Gosh I don't think they are, maybe you should hang out in better places? maybe if you're hanging with a particular group of people who are disgruntled, you will hear/see a lot of anti-patriotic stories and sentiment.  I have always found American people to be deeply patriotic, lots of flags on their porches. <br>  <br>  It is we who have let our flag become nothing but a football emblem and a spandex sequined skirt for 16 year old hookers to wear to the nightclub while they puke in the street before fking a stranger. I despair at where we have let England slide down to.|`|G2IoZpeqaa	well just maube there were no against the Country but against Bush I have traveled extensively to different Areas there I didnt see that at all..in fact I thought the opposite, maybe the ones who burnt the flag where from another country ,they are multi cultural|`|GqTSa85daa	The conservative Americans are the most patriotic, but also the most silent that is until they get angry.|`|apcRdPhIaa	Very funny Sid.<br>  <br>  Americans are well known for being unpatriotic!<br>  <br>  Er... not.|`|cPbrL1WGaa	oh i beg to differ... from where im standing it looks like many americans think their country is the best at everything|`|eTTkAv9Yaa	Ah, sarcasm!<br>  <br>  Never met a more over-patriotic nation, not that they have much to be proud of....|`|MWE7rQ4Daa	What?

Glk38Ml3aa	Well Mike Shinoda started the band xero in mid 1990's.<br>  <br>  Then in 1998 they changed their name from xero to Hybrid Theory then mid 1999 Chester Bennington (lead singer) joined the band and they changed the name to Linkin Park. About 6 months after Chester joined, they got a record deal.<br>  <br>  So mid 1999 is when the band was formed with all it's members|`|f5UmSdoMaa	The original Xero formed in December 1996, with singer Mark Wakefield instead of Chester Bennington. Mark later left. The bassist Phoenix was in two bands, so he was in and out of the band frequently.<br>  <br>  On March 20th, 1999, Chester's birthday coincidentally, he received a phone call from Jeff Blue saying he found a band for him in Los Angeles to sing for. Chester won the audition and joined the band since then. The band's name changed to Hybrid Theory.<br>  <br>  In early 2000, the band was forced to change their name again. For a moment they were Lincoln Park, but became Linkin Park to secure a web address. <br>  <br>  In late 2000 Phoenix rejoined the band for good.

(Also, why would you post in the CLASSICAL section and assume that females here will disapprove of listening to classical music? Is there some logical reason that I'm totally missing?)|`|9ee25102a7763535588f4a899e88f4dcaa	I already answerd a question very like this last week. No two girls (and no two boys either) are exactly the same. Therefore, to ask "What do girls think of guys who listen to classical music?" is a nonsense as each one will have a slightly different opinion.<br>  <br>  Girls who might think guys who like classical music 'gay' or 'boring' or a 'nerd' are almost definitely going to be brainless bimbos of low intelligence who follow the crowd like mindless sheep (baaaaa!).<br>  <br>  You really do not need to concern yourself with this. Any girl who thinks badly of you just because you like classical music is shallow and dumb and, therefore, not for you. In my experience, worthwhile women actually admire intelligence, sensitivity and culture in a man. And remember, there are more women musicians now than men and so there are plenty of decent, music-loving girls out there.|`|ThKkn5fKaa	Dude.  You seem to be having some serious self-esteem issues.  Why is it that you keep associating the enjoyment of classical music with being boring, or gay? (You have asked this same question at least twice now)  I think you really need to get over whatever it is that you are going through and realize that right now, there are literally thousands of young people across the country studying classical music.  And there are millions who, if not studying it, still greatly enjoy it.  And they are just like you.  Young.  I don't know where you got this insane idea that it's not right for young men to enjoy classical music, but you are completely misinformed.  Now please stop worrying about it.  The only problem here is that you really seem to have some self esteem issues.  It has nothing to do with classical music.|`|b6cd9d6fe5a0ec1d495444c45c2b75f2aa	If I found a guy who liked classical, I'd be impressed and excited. It would be amazing to sit down and have a nice long talk with someone else about my favorite genre of music.  My friends are always teasing me for listening to music created by "some old dead guys". <br>  <br>  Would I think you gay? No. Boring? Heck no! Nobody my age seems to like classical, everybody likes the same stuff. Finding somebody who is unique in their interests, and isn't afraid to flaunt it isn't boring, but cool. Do I think you a nerd? Of course, a music nerd. And in my eyes there is nothing wrong with being a nerd. I'm a nerd, and I'm proud to admit it! A music nerd is one of the best types of nerd to be!|`|10mOHSZTaa	My boyfriend loves atonal music, but he also likes Wagner. He's a classical music fetishist- and so am I.<br>  <br>  And...<br>  <br>  He's 19.<br>  <br>  You'll find a girl who appreciates you...it's just going to be hard. I'd like to think that it will be worth it though. ^_^|`|35GfsJ3Paa	While I also love classical music, what kind of music a guy likes isn't really a factor in whether I am interested in him or not. It's a nice bonus - interests in common are always a good starting point. <br>  <br>  If you're trying to find out how to make a female interested in you, or are concerned that no one seems to like you, take a look at you personality - are you friendly, kind, a good listener, good sense of humor?<br>  <br>  Don't worry too much about what kind of music you like in relation to your love life. The two are not that closely related.|`|HfoO77gpaa	i love classical music. i much prefer guys who listen to it than inapprochable grunge guys who listen to metal music. guys are more interesting i find who listen to classical. my favourite composers are smetana, corelli and tchaikovsky. i also like piano music and chamber music. <br>  it's not nerdy at all. <br>  it has shaped the way i percieve all genres of music|`|CjPtAEzmaa	I would call you sexy and sensitive, the kind of guy I wish I knew in my every day life.

There are plenty of girls who really love it (including me!).<br>  <br>  It's not gay. I don't get how music preference relates at all to sexual preference.<br>  <br>  Edit for person below me: Amen about the joys of nerdiness!

It's even better when he can play an intrument ;) xx|`|R8INrvi8aa	I would consider guys to be cultured and higher up on my "most likely to date" list.

Obviously I'm not scared of them but I am very disturbed by them.  When I was younger I hated the look, feel and smell of ALL rubber products.  I wouldn't even wear sneakers because they had rubber under them.  I still hate rubber to a degree but I'm better now.  However I can't get over flip flops and how people can wear stinky rubber on their feet. I hate the look, smell (I avoid walking past them in stores) and that awful slapping sound they make.  It really bothers me. I hate looking at them on people's feet and I am so distracted when talking to someone with them on that I can't get it out of my mind. I would never date a man who wears them. It actually turns me off.   I'm not sure it's a phobia but it's a problem for me.

The movie is very predictable at the start and then it all changes and when things happen you'll feel confused then something will slot into place. The action is incredible brilliant fighting not a jump 30 feet on string like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. This movie is recommended to all. Warning a very sad ending though.<br>  <br>  The Shawshank Redemption<br>  Lovely 1940/1950's jail house movie. How he works and works and what it would of really been like and in the end its been a plan the whole time and gets what he deserves because he is 100% innocent. Such a feel good movie in the end. Unless you've seen it you won't have an idea what I'm babbling on about, but this is truly a credit to the film world. Highly under rated. Consider your film collection empty without this cinematography.<br>  <br>  The Rocky Horror Picture Show<br>  Like a dirty version of Grease. Transvestites, singing, dancing...Meatloaf....what else do you really want from a movie. Some unbelievably catchy songs this is sheer genious. Tim Curry is amazing, this is certainly one to see before you die. I will be singing Lets Do The Timewarp on my deathbed!<br>  <br>  Napoleon Dynamite<br>  This may come as a shock but I think this is one of the funniest things ever made. Its pretty clean with no sex or swears in it which is even more amazing. Its based around a loser and all the creepy things he does and in the end you find out he actually has a talent which he's really good at which is so funny. John Heder is an awesome actor in this, better than any of his other films. His goofy expression makes it all the better.<br>  <br>  Alien<br>  Well how could I deny the legend. The start of the most infamous horror charecters ever. Not one to get scared by but its just purely awesome starting off the sci fi / horror  genre. The creepiest part was before you knew about Aliens, Alien 3 or 4 or AVP and you suddenly see this terrifying creature. Awesome|`|PFVqo1wkaa	okay so my fav movie is "Maundy Thursday" or sometimes its called "Our Happy Time". its a korean movie (NOT a drama) n its about a guy who has a death sentence and a rich family girl who had tried to commit suicide 3 times becuz of her dark childhood. they started to see each other in detention house every thursday n falls in love. but the guy has a death sentence you know. and ohhh its such a great movie. it was made in 2006. the 2 roles have verrryyyyyy interesting stories.<br>  genre: tragic romance.<br>  i highly recommend u to watch it.|`|st32dyTDaa	A Clockwork Orange because it's something very different and unusual and something I've never seen before, and because the book is awesome.|`|KO5viXFoaa	Thoovana thumbikal|`|MrQkarVZaa	I love Eagle Eye.

maVptaMZaa	There was a feature on his latest film on the radio today (Radio 4).  He said it would be his last acting part because he wanted to concentrate on producing films and that he felt he was getting too old.  They played a clip from the film and it did have very "colourful" language in it so I imagine that it might offend some although from what I gather in the interview he, (Clint Eastwood) is also playing a character who has very strong racist views.<br>  Maybe you could look at your local Cinema website (Odeon) for instance and see what is showing and when.  I have just routed through my recycling box to see if there is any listing of that film in the cinema section and can't find a thing.  I see what you mean!<br>  Sorry I couldn't be of more help.

vrAmpR3Waa	<a href="http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/3458764513820564205/" rel="nofollow">http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/3...</a><br>  scroll down and read the comments.. everyone has a different point of view on the meaning of it!|`|SmtoSb02aa	People are similar and yet different all at the same time. Everyone goes through emotional/mental struggles. <br>  Sometimes people are pushed past their limit and react how they know. Basically, everyone in this song died. <br>  Just the fact that you don't miss something/someone till it's/they're gone and don't truly know the hurt you've caused.<br>  <br>  The lyrics are uber meaningful, but I suggest watching the video, might help.

The song sounds better with those words together, nothing else would have fit.<br>  <br>  BA: Just tomorrow.|`|oUZLZusjaa	Probably the second thing, as he often said "excuse me while i kiss that guy" during live performances, often pointing to someone in the audience and making kissy faces at them.

3890f326e072192e79ea3f718551dfb8aa	I think the primary reason lies in the fact that about 85% of Academy members are actors. As a general rule, actors are going to favor films that rely on strong acting, rather than special effects. That being said, I think The Dark Knight presents an interesting conundrum for voters because it was a very well acted special effects spectacular. <br>  <br>  I do think that Academy attitudes have shifted in recent years as some of the older members have died off and younger members have become a larger percentage. Case in point is Lord of the Rings winning 11 including Best Picture in 2003. This may just open the way for different types of films to be nominated, and even win in the future. <br>  <br>  Ultimately, you do have to remember the Academy Awards are intended to honor the craft of making films. You have the MTV Movie Awards, The People's Choice Awards, and the Teen Choice Awards for honoring fan favorites. <br>  <br>  This year I have seen virtually all of the films with nominations in the 9 major categories (acting, picture, directing, screen plays, animation), as well as a number of the films that might have been considered. Of those, the only category where I feel there was a major injustice was Christopher Nolan not getting nominated for Best Director. I'm not sure who you take out in favor of Nolan - maybe Stephen Daldry for The Reader, but Nolan should have been in that group.<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  Something else that's going to cause the Academy problems in the coming years is the blurring between animation and live action. Gollum in Lord of the Rings was the first real example of how a fully fleshed out animated character can be real part of a serious movie. This is going to force the Academy to consider whether performance capture roles are going to be nomination worthy, or will they need to add a new category for performance capture characters which will be shared between the actor and the animators.|`|pXlY8eoNaa	For many decades, the Academy spurned great movies of spectacle, such as "Wizard of Oz." But this has changed in recent decades. You can see the progression by looking at how often they award the same film Best Picture and Best Visual Effects (originally Best Special Effects). It wasn't until 1960, with "Ben Hur," that a film received both awards. After that, it wasn't until 1995, with "Forrest Gump." Huge gaps of time, right? Since "Gump," however, three other films have taken both awards: "Titanic," "Gladiator," and the third "Lord of the Rings." Thus, it seems that the current Academy is more open to giving Best Picture to movies of spectacle than they used to be.<br>  <br>  Part of the reason is that there's been a blurring of the line between "serious" movies and spectacle movies. Historical films like "Titanic" and "Gladiator" have come to rely on special effects more than they did in the past. And fantasies like "Lord of the Rings" have adopted an epic feel that allows them to pass the muster of respectability the Academy demands.<br>  <br>  It's easy, in hindsight, to criticize the Academy for overlooking the original "Star Wars" and "Empire" and the early Spielberg classics (though "Star Wars," "Raiders," and "E.T." did at least get nominated). I have no idea whether they would make that mistake today. On the one hand, they've become more open to considering those sorts of movies, but on the other hand, the spectacle movies themselves have become more serious.|`|C7A34HFMaa	The Oscars have always preferred the so-called serious movies. Just take a look at a director like Steven Spielberg who had to make serious movies to get recognized. He should have won for either Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Raiders of the Losk Ark og E.T.<br>  <br>  The list of movies that should have won is long. In 1981 Ordinary People won despite being up against Raging Bull and The Elephant Man. Chicago beat both The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers and Gangs of New York<br>  <br>  To be hones fan favorites have also won the Oscar even though the movies as such weren't great as Gladiator, Titanic, Braveheart, Forrest Gump and Rocky are examples of.|`|qog4MvbOaa	Yeah, even if we were to go by the critics (metacritic.com) The Dark Knight is rated higher than all the other nominated movies par Milk and Slumdog Millionaire. Same with IMDB.<br>  I thought it deserved a Best Picture nomination, and I'm not even a big Batman fan.<br>  And there's no way Star Wars shouldn't of won, looking back at it now.<br>  Blade Runner was never nominated for Best Picture either.|`|1hvrQYWiaa	The Oscars isn't really about the best movie, best acting performance and so on. It's a big party thrown every year by the producers, distributors, and money men - the Hollywood Studio System, if you will - so they can congratulate themselves on what a great job they're doing and how much money they're making.How else do you think average movies like Forrest Gump and Titanic can pick up so many Oscars? Why else do foreign/British movies/artists rarely do well?<br>   If the fans got to vote,you'd see a very different set of winners every year.But then, of course, Hollywood wouldn't like it was doing such a good job, would it?!

I hardly ever thumbs down anyone, unless, like you said, they're an *******.  Sometimes, I go back and look at the answers to my questions and am surprised that someone took the time to go through and thumbs down most of them.  Then, I go and thumbs up all of them.|`|4x6Gkm86aa	Yeah, I know what you mean! I only thumbs up. Have only felt the need to thumbs down twice, and believe me, they deserved worse! (In fact I'm sure they were both in response to some bull crud answer to one of your questions! hehe)|`|AA10953999	I always forget to do either.|`|NHG8JPIAaa	So how many thumbs down did I get today.

FZKFLTyLaa	My only daughter is an adult. <br>  I'd not watch MY daughter in any adult situation like that, BUT I've watched OTHER people's daughters doing this sh!t.<br>  Define the difference - without an audience NO ONE would be watching ANYONE, so who's to say what exactly is right or wrong here?|`|XM7WXyEQaa	I'm a teen and i would rather show someone my chest then have strangers watch me having sex <br>   although i am underage and i could always sue the porno company <br>  but it's not really worth my dignity and my virginity|`|2hx7eEtsaa	Honestly, if shes at that age (18) and she chooses to do it I have no problem with either and I would not be embarrassed. I will try my best to raise my kids to know what they are doing.<br>  (I have no kids though)<br>  <br>  If she was under 18 than i believe that's a legal issue and I would take action.|`|ZFTkBTvvaa	no, if she wants to be a whore that's her right, i said that you can get pregnant and its stupid and unnecessary and against God, <br>  <br>  but after that its just her problem|`|sEpBQjQjaa	I wouldn't be embarrassed. I would be angry and upset with her. I'd rather it be GGW than and adult film...but for real, neither.|`|3urQfMffaa	girls gone wild is prolly more age appropriate for her than any adult film, assuming i have a daughter, which i don't.|`|xhfACgiTaa	Yes to either but angrier if it was something like a gangbang!|`|7U8nhijRaa	no it means shes hottt
00065523689897d7479d3d1a6c534b20aa	I believe the movie is called Love at Stake (1988).<br>  The mayor and judge of Salem trump up the notorious witch trials in support of their land grab scam. The local clergy pursue justice, while the assistant minister also pursues the town baker, Sara Lee. The action is spiced up by pot-smoking Indians, female New England clam chowder wrestling, and the mischief of a real witch. It is a spoof of the Salem Witch Trials. ^_^ The part with the ginger bread men was  very funny!
tmhIpoMGaa	It depends, pot makes me sleepy, so unless I take my adderal right before, I won't smoke.<br>  But overall, I'd rather be drunk. <br>  Not throwed as ****, but on that think line between drunk and buzzed. <br>  Just because I feel more awake and hella social.<br>  <br>  (;|`|Jpb94AZlaa	I would rather be high. <br>  <br>  Alcohol is stale, while weed is fresh and pure.<br>  <br>  + High takes you to heaven, while drunk takes you nowhere.|`|Z2EzfQFvaa	neither.|`|DhmUgq0maa	I love both...I'd choose drunk if i had too, but drunk & high at the same time is great lol.|`|821bd483afcea62cd9c3a4d1aa91236caa	i'd rather get high, because getting high comes from earth's natural herbs, and getting drunk has to do with alcohol, alcohol is man made.<br>  <br>  besides, getting drunk gives you a hang over.|`|mh5NOsWzaa	high ...no hang over except addiction|`|PtRmhxU9aa	Drunk. It at least won't prevent me from getting a job if I have to fill a cup.|`|SUzn3qfzaa	yeah Id rather get high too <:)|`|EhrB7nUXaa	Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiighhhhhhhhhhhh.|`|LId3qnI1aa	Hiiiiggghh.<br>  <br>  <br>  =]|`|NlXWdRcQaa	High, fodeff. ?|`|Jf6cke5naa	Ohhhhh to get high \|`|xGNM8J6yaa	High|`|MHMndoCcaa	high|`|DZ3BBDncaa	I prefer drunk!

What could give me more pleasure than listening to music, or seing a movie, or teaching a new word to my daughter? I would rather be handicapped. Not that people with those kind of disabilities are unable to be happy, but if I had a choice, I would rather lose a leg than my sight.|`|wfMF0pbKaa	Tough @_@ ...<br>  <br>  I'd choose to be physically handicapped, but not deaf, dumb or blind.. <br>  <br>  I don't think I'd really benefit from being fit if I was deaf, dumb and blind.

cLgwmcfwaa	my oppinion= go for it. he's everything u want. the sources oppinion:<br>  <br>  Taurus Man & Libra Woman<br>  This match doesn't have high hopes for success. You might initially be drawn to a Taurus boy for his curious, sensitive side. You both share a love of music, film and art that can form a bond between you. However, after that you are pretty much different in every way. You are social and you love getting together to go out with a big group of friends. Meanwhile, he is very possessive and he'll get jealous of the time you spend with other people, even your best girlfriend. You'll find his whining about this very tiresome. He will also be very jealous with you and he'll take your innocent flirtations way too seriously. He'll never feel secure with you, and you'll never feel understood. Give this match a pass.

AA10053661	Always! I look at this picture and I realize that the world our children know here in the states is so vastly different from the world other children grow up in. The opportunities...... the entertainment...... the education...... the healthcare.......... and definitely the safety and security!<br>  <br>  That's something we so take for granted here. We just assume we are 'safe.' 9/11 really really turned that around for us. Maybe we walk around a little less secure..... a little more wary. But I think years later..... that fear has crept back into the deeper parts of our psyche and we once again take safety for granted. <br>  <br>  I look at my children and KNOW I'm lucky...... I'm alive! They are alive! For that... i'm eternally grateful!!|`|ZYrQXiwBaa	Holy s1-1it, I wish I hadn't seen it.

Even wishing that we were richer........ so I could have so much money right now. But yeah, at least we are living better than that child...

BbiyBG0oaa	I think Goku is one of the greatest japanese anime characters ever created.  I think that Monkey D. Luffy from One Piece was greatly influenced by Goku.  Whenever I watch One Piece that is all i think about because they both protect everyone and love to eat and make you laugh all of the time.  He is a person without any limits and is always getting stronger because he has the will to protect earth because it has given him the friends and family that he loves.  Honestly I don't think any anime character can compare to Goku, he is definately the best character in Japanese Anime.|`|0SiGDy4kaa	I think it's bull**** how everyone he fights is stronger, or atleast seems stronger than him. Frieza, Cell, Buu. But he beats them in the end, well maybe not Cell but he somewhat helped. In GT he turns into a little kid but still beats everyone he fights. And when he turns Super Sayain 4 he turns into an adult again and his voice changes from what it was earlier when he was an adult. He is way too strong, he should be banned from video games since hes like the Super Man of DBZ. His progression is too fast too. I think a lot of things about Goku...no homo. But in the end you cant help but love him..homo.|`|TQge2oBVaa	To me personally he is the best hero there is. He always knows when to fight, and when not to. He always tries FAR more than his hardest. He is funny, and interesting. He is a great parent, and overall, the best hero, in my opinion.|`|AVCSn5EHaa	son gokbu

ZA18KoC9aa	I would- I once cut open a fully bodied and feathered dead chicken and saw the eggs inside it!|`|OMoOg5WJaa	I would only pick up a bird with a stick to put it into a bush becoz it is horrid to leave it out where, whilst it is dead, to get run over again....i would touch a dead fish because well it doesn't hurt me....|`|MMmv06Ynaa	i would touch the bird if it is dead. Actually I would bury it and give it a little funeral. Its sad when animals die.|`|96b1b355d08c721076e9540b69416845aa	Yes. Eviscerating dead animals to cook them is just natural.|`|7294c9edbf7c247468b6e48776c6fcadaa	No not one found dead because of bird fever:  One I killed when hunting yes:|`|bf3ae75cd10212e3ea6776e172ac04cdaa	ME TOO! yuk!  (@_@)|`|bbo35Rs3aa	yuck, no way<br>  <br>  greeneyed40girl|`|4ef505315e6714cd6a174d1beb0546f0aa	I used to work at Valleyfair, an amusement park in Minnesota. My ride was Ripcord, which was a Skycoaster ride, where you are hoisted up 185 ft. off the ground, pull a ripcord, and swing from a tower by two 3/8" steel cables.<br>  <br>  One day a bird flew right into the flight path as three heavy people started their downswing, and the cable cut the bird right in half. Everyone watching the ride saw it and let out this huge "AAAAHHH EEEEWWWW". It was pretty funny.<br>  <br>  Of course, we couldn't let the bird sit there, so I had to take a bucket and go pick up the bird halves, bare handed. One little girl vomited at the sight. It was pretty gross, but things happen and it had to be dealt with. <br>  <br>  Swear to god, true story.<br>  <br>  <br>  Back to your topic:<br>  When you eat greens, you have dead plants in your mouth. Your problem is that when you think of dead animals in your mouth, you have this mental image of some cute, furry wild animal. Not true. Beef, chicken, turkey, fish, all of these animals are specifically bred for food, and nothing else.<br>  <br>  Other animals also eat meat. Remember the food chain?<br>  <br>  I'm sure if you were starving you wouldn't be so mushy-gushy over what you put in your mouth. Turning down food is a luxury. You having a problem with your conscience because of how you picture your food is a product of naivety and ignorance. <br>  <br>  Just eat your meat and stop being so self-righteous. If you're gonna stop eating meat to save a poor animals life, then I'll just eat your share. You're not making a difference, you're only making yourself look like a tool. I bet if you didn't know of the existence of the concept of vegetarianism you wouldn't be thinking these thoughts. <br>  <br>  Instead of worrying about what you feed your body, you should be more concerned about what you're feeding your mind. Examine where you are getting all of your ideas, and how you're letting it affect your good judgment.|`|kCbJ6hPAaa	I have touched a dead bird, with gloves on ofc.

AA11485682	It's a movie musical that's a sexy parody of 1950s sci-fi films, about a boring young couple who meet a transvestite mad scientist, Dr. Frank N Furter and his "creation." While the movie is silly fun, the big appeal is that people go in groups to movie theatres to watch it at midnight, where they talk back to the movie, bring props, dress up in costumes, act out what they're doing in the movie and otherwise make a big game out of it.|`|4xOXiZcNaa	You're KIDDING... right?  Talk about a generation gap.. HOW OLD ARE YOU?<br>  <br>  Just GO RENT A COPY and watch it.. then ask your parents about the cult following it had and the crazy saturday nights when it played in the movies.|`|GqTSa85daa	A movie title.

Theater groups all over the US play the movie and perform it. It's interactive; you can't hear half of the lines because people are hollering well-rehearsed lines at certain times. (The crowd yells, "WHAT IS ROSIE O'DONNELL?" and a character in the movie says something to the effect of, "A perfect specimen of a man.") You bring props such as newspaper for when the car breaks down and the character uses a newspaper as a rain-shield, and toast when a character is making a toast. Stuff like that. Many people dress up for it, like in the characters' costumes. And yes, it is fun. Just don't go with your parents unless you're very, very comfortable with them in awkward situations.|`|kNiWIilfaa	It's a cult classic w/Susan Sarandon,Barry Bostwick and Tim Curry the one who played the clown in the movie IT.<br>  But it's a pretty good movie you need to watch it.

divHOiLWaa	Paramore by far. They have a small singer with a big beautiful voice. They have fun songs which can also have a lot of meaning. Fueled by Ramen records is their label and also the label of many other great bands that are all doing well. Paramore isn't going away, they're going on tour this summer with no doubt. They are also working on a third album. That is why I say Paramore.|`|PDBJ7qPOaa	definitely evanescence<br>  amy lee has so much more talent then hailey (is that the paramore chicks name?)<br>  and her voice has a lot more range.<br>  <br>  i also love evanescence and don't really like paramore|`|XQ5VMNTeaa	i know, evanescence really is great.. but i'll go for paramore... hailey rocks!|`|SiNtWRBiaa	Paramore.|`|G63gOZB9aa	deffinetly PARAMORE (:|`|3koordzkaa	evanescence|`|4ILA5CDzaa	evanescence<br>  without a doubt|`|GHrgVKy1aa	paramore ! ;]|`|96AQZUGyaa	I like both but Evanescence has more feeling, more energy.

Then me and my other best friend tried to comfort her. After a while we noticed there was this HUGE 2 and 1/2 inch booger hanging out her nose. We kept trying to tell her but she just thought we were comforting her. The more we tried the more we sniggered to each other. Pretty soon we were almost crying ourselves from laughing so hard. <br>  Then on top of that, we talked to some other kids about it, and we started to make fun of her. "We've got a hanger!!" and all that other stuff. We secretly nicknamed her "Boogy" and we told my brothers. They started to make fun of her, to her face. Then I finally confessed.<br>  SHE WAS PISSED!!!!!! but the worst part is, as I'm writing this, two years later.....i'm almost crying laughing.....<br>  <br>  it was just so funny...hahaha.<br>  <br>  oh, Geez, I'm a terrible person.|`|MjJSWaUsaa	I lied about a science project.

But he deserved it I guess. <br>  <br>  That was thw worst thing I ever did.|`|BMYOukx5aa	I did not go to visit my parents since July 4, 2002 and always meant to and my father passed away on September 2, 2006 and I never went to see him in those 4 years and now I regrett it with all my heart and soul and I still beat myself up over it.|`|Ym90xu59aa	In high school, I kept $500 of fund raising money and used it to get a tattoo that looks incredibly tacky at my age now, among many other things.|`|jZVtnt9gaa	I stole money.....<----Real.....!!!!!!

uRqm4Bxcaa	It all depends on what she is usually like.  Is she a hard worker?  Is she dramatic and creating baggage around the workplace?  Giving yourself a concussion in front of customers is grounds for termination (and grounds for committal.)  Personally, I'd can her.  If you don't, and she ends up doing something REALLY crazy, you'll have some explaining to do to upper management as to why you looked the other way.|`|mYkinxsQaa	Speak with angry employee about personal altercations and matters at work. Make it clear it will not be tolerated. Offer assistance where possible.<br>  <br>  As far as off-the-clock worker goes, inform her that those kinds of emotional displays are not proper regardless of her status (off clock, as a customer, not wearing uniform). Offer any assistance.<br>  <br>  Find the source of the problem and offer help. Keep them separated for the time being.|`|InGWARz9aa	send her to the rest room straight away! try and find out what the problem is!|`|PtRmhxU9aa	Take her into the office, find out what's going on. If she can't or won't give a good explanation then she gets a written warning. If she repeats this behavior or gets worse - she's out the door.

6oASoFr7aa	This link says Libra, Aquarius, Aries, and Leo<br>  <a href="http://www.astrology-online.com/gelove.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.astrology-online.com/gelove.h...</a>|`|QaJGkXp2aa	Dating based on astrology is for the most part a superstitious copout. I say this as someone who doesn't dismiss astrology outright, but who believes more fundamentally that we are all unique and those who are right for us can show up in the most unlikely places.<br>  <br>  If you do go by astrology, it is infinitely more complex than just picking from 12 sun signs. Sun signs, rising signs, moon signs, cusps, positions of all of the planets and houses, the angles of various astrological aspects... turns out even in astrology we're each unique and thus just looking at the sun sign won't be a good predictor of compatibility. And much of it is open for interpretation anyway...|`|W7l1awFPaa	I find it difficult to believe that there are only 12 types of people out of all the billions in the world.  I think that personality profiles are a more accurate measure of how likely people are to get along although of course this isn't perfect either as many people who have been on dating sites will tell you.<br>  I really do think that chemistry is involved on some level.  You can't KNOW if you are going to like someone for sure until you meet them in person and spend some time with them.<br>  <br>  "Commit all your ways to the Lord and he will make your paths straight"|`|TtMKPBR3aa	"slippery when wet"|`|0PNW440zaa	Ok, you might like your own air signs: Libra and Aquarius.<br>  They're mostly the same as you, great at conversations, flirty, great to work with. They'll soar with you to great heights, the problem is, you both will not stop to think about matters and this may lead to problems when blaming each other.<br>  <br>  Or if you like someone more loyal but slightly emotional, pick water signs: Cancer, Scorpio or Pisces. They're very supportive and caring. They can be very sensitive though, so look out when you're talking. Although you wont feel much bad when dating them, they could be exhausted if you push them too much<br>  <br>  Fire signs are good for you, except when arguing for who's the boss and suchlike. Leo, Aries and Sagittaurus are all fire but could be really enjoyable to be around with. Sags are less fire, so you might like them better than the more fiery Leo or Aries.<br>  <br>  Earth signs are stable ppl, Taurus, Capricorn and Virgo. They're stable, loyal, and comfortable with most ppl. They make great friends and will support you, but since you're an air sign, these ppl may halt your freedom and cut your wings.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|rvthI0dIaa	Other gemini, libra , aquarius.|`|d9hzMrzwaa	your compatible with libras. thats the only one i know of|`|Rlm7VjeEaa	Sagittarius or a Capricorn i believe.

RIRRITy8aa	Actually Kevin & Mac bought it from Nick and Sharon a short while after Cassie died. But when Mac moved out of town I think she left Kevin in charge of it, but to my knowledge he never bought her out.

AA11755427	the only thing i get jealous of is the man next to me at the bar with more in his pint than i do|`|jN29byxsaa	Well I am a Scorpio, but I do not want to speak for all.<br>  <br>  The reason why most (or the majority) or Scorpios get jealous is because we like to dominate and possess. Scorpio is not a sign that likes to be told what to do and feels threatened when something of theirs (including people) are going to be taken away from them.|`|01d9f7d86b08b714b8ed46b41571cfdaaa	Well, it's more of a "don't touch my stuff" type of jealousy that i have, if you can even call it jealousy.  That's more possessiveness, which I don't think is all that bad (seriously, don't go invading my space, and we're fine).  It's also because i like privacy, and when people don't respect that, i can possessive and angry.  At that point, i think its more of a human thing rather than a scorpio thing, but i can be wrong.|`|MtANnIlfaa	Why are you stereotyping? Stop being ignorant.<br>  I've never met a jealous scorpio in my life, including myself. I value my freedom.

Sorry to burst your bubble!|`|BlZ6vJOAaa	Wow i'm a little surprised no scorpios here are jealous but that's good i guess.<br>  If i might answer..my scorpio ex was crazy jealous and so am i, Taurus, we too are jealous signs..

They are the most complex of all the signs|`|mbfMYmzWaa	Same with above... I'm TOO easy-going if anything.<br>  <br>  My lack of jelousy is ridiculous... my ex used to get frustrated cause he could flirt with as many girls as he wanted and it wouldn't phase me. All the better really cause it just means he has to be comfortable with me having guy friends.. If he cheated, of course I'd dump him...but that's due to 'pride' rather than jelousy.<br>  <br>  Sure I go through stages where I envy people... that girl with the super-fast metabolism, my mate with the huge house, my mum's friend who has complete and utter 'spiritual peace' (lol. when I don't even know what that means) But find me someone (anyone, from any starsign) that doesnt...<br>  <br>  You'll probably get better answers by asking why 'people' get so jelous.   <br>  <br>  It's a good question though, jelous people drive me NUTS! ugh.|`|HuXMiJLpaa	I think it depends. Scorpio females don't seem to get very jealous, they could care less. But, scorpio males tend to get a lot more jealous. Scorpio males and females don't act the same completely.|`|nRTMOvMYaa	Because scorpios are very emotional and jealousy is emotion|`|nxHjSKTTaa	You know I am scorpio and I get so sick of everyone saying we are these over jealous nut cases.  I am seldom ever jealous. The few times in life I have ever been jealous, I keep it to my self.  My leo husband is on the other hand constantly jealous.|`|xUKLUSL5aa	ok truthfully i am a jealous scorpio. scorpios hate feeling vulnerable and insecure. we need to have much loyalty, faithfulness and truth from those we love and care about. we want to make sure that someone will always be there and that we can trust them. we are emotional people but we do keep them in...so sometimes you wont really know if we are jealous or not.|`|g2jCrkcPaa	I'm barely ever jealous. :]<br>  I don't get jealous of other people, or what they have.<br>  I only get jealous if my guy is around other girls a lot.<br>  <br>  People over exaggerate the jealousy thing.|`|GI27dKIkaa	I don't get jealous !<br>  <br>  I'm too easy-going to get jealous - and I'm deffo a Scorpio (27th October)|`|KFu7596Paa	sorry you got the wrong star sign im scorpio and i never get jealous <br>  nor doe's my dad who is also scorpio|`|a8qFkmSzaa	I'm a scorpio and im not jealous at all. =D

The media will do and use ANYTHING no matter what it is, to try and bring Miley down and make fun of her and be mean about her. Every little thing she does, no matter how minor, they twist it into something and make her seem like that. It's quite sickening, really. There's nothing wrong with the picture.|`|CYhOr4s7aa	I think miley cyrus is just a strange little rich girl that cant sing, act and her daddy's achy breaky song carried her way to far ,  and the music from her family sucks duck butts|`|kcD05Xu8aa	nope theres nothing gross about them in relation to each other but miley is being to sexy with her audience for somebody her age.|`|sVFtRGBhaa	Every Miley Cyrus picture is weird.  That one's just weirder than usual.|`|7nRom97Daa	certainly different from most family portraits|`|wdLzpIAiaa	though i hate her, she actually looks pretty like that...<br>  i wish she would dye her hair black it looks better....<br>  now if she just loses her sluttish ways......|`|H8DsNL8waa	Look at the bone sticking out of her stomach.|`|SzV0zImdaa	So what?

NBI2r47baa	I do like the Simpsons; however, because they've changed writers, the new episodes are not nearly as funny as the old ones. I love the reruns, but the new ones are off-target. Maybe they are getting tired.|`|p8ahZa8iaa	I wouldn't call it an abomination but it's definitely slipped from the heydays of the 90's.   I will say the movie was horrible though - I was bitterly disappointed.|`|IFnyC2naaa	Sure.|`|S9ZNGhqyaa	yeah, i think its a stupid show|`|bexN2lbvaa	simpisons-7<br>  family guy-10<br>  american dad-9<br>  south park-8 an a half<br>  <br>  simpions is boring and dumb<br>  family guy i can never stop laughing<br>  american dad is supa fuinny<br>  south park funny but sometimes stupid|`|QvbNeLgYaa	Hey Hey Hey Don't talk about Family guy and South park that way you abomination!! LoL jkjk<br>  <br>  But yeah I LOVE south park and Family guy!!<br>  <br>  Not so much the simpsons tey were funny but your right now they just kinda farted and died..|`|Rdiaudxzaa	I like Family Guy wayyy better but, i still do like the simpsons|`|F0uLexezaa	i don't like any of the cartoon series|`|7gfNIajYaa	I know what you mean...the old episodes are fantastic,they are airing all the oldies on our local tv chanel here in Ireland..its so good to sit down and watch the ones like where Bart becomes a hall monitor,or Milhouse becomes Fallout boy,or my faves) when they show Marge and Homer in the past etc etc...all while chilling out eating my dinner:):):)<br>  <br>  New episodes arn't great I agree...but I hope the Simpsons never stops!<br>  <br>  <br>  (They'l never stop the Simpsons...have no fear we'v got stories for years...like..Marge becomes a robot...something something...")XD

eHyJ9mYFaa	Yeah, I had to rewind 3 times, and then I saved it to my Play list.|`|fcPiQDwEaa	Yes it was awesome that she did that, even after he gave her and Abby a "token" for Brad's service. Nobody saw that coming!|`|17d2bf173d4736ad8ae99a2e1672a131aa	yep and she is smart and will have the Abbott' support... just that I found it a little cliche when she said her father went from poor to rich... uh... he slept his way up with two sisters of the same family that created herself!!! How hard was that???<br>  He was never a hero, he was a gold digger, except for his last hours when he went after Sharon... sorry.<br>  I like his daughter but she is too bitter to go down that way... she wil burn herself.|`|cce7d68825e6be23ab1dbad4e0df262faa	YES I love the story line there going with there is a lot of Brad in Colleen and I hope she does her daddy proud and kicks some ***!|`|4kuWOZowaa	I Loved it to!!!!!! OMG IT WAS AWESOME SOMEONE STOOD UP TO THE MUSTACHE!!!!!!LMAO|`|qPCXsXfNaa	She is his daughter. Good for her!!|`|63e06560819d2a12be1f89de0fb23d79aa	I think Colleen is like Brad in the sense that you don't mess with people they care about.  Colleen had her issues with her dad, but loved him and was horribly hurt after hearing how Victor was to Brad on that message.  Granted Brad has done his share of wrong doings, but he ultimately sacrificed his life to help save someone else.  I think that made Colleen realize the true heart Brad had, and she is now out to avenge his death.|`|EPPb5pRBaa	Yeah, but for how long. When Victor finds out Jack is behind it . He won't be too happy.|`|jK9o1ilwaa	yeah i was like you go girl!  it was great!  :)
Ojzv0rAwaa	Many many times. I think there must be some crossover of souls somewhere. Another realm, another world who knows.<br>  I think it is bizarre that a person who has Tourettes Syndrome will swear etc - wherever they are in the world and whatever age. Not every single one of these people would have heard these words in every day life - Deja Vu is a possible reason.|`|cxKR99KIaa	Yes, it creeps me out|`|tIJCQ0XQaa	Many times! I want more! L0L|`|YCUJMvWQaa	I think we had all<br>  At one point experienced déjà vu :)|`|xsHT1Vz2aa	nopeeeeeees.|`|AA10345820	Have you ever experienced Deja vu?|`|IkWcwsj8aa	yes..<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  yes...|`|1iSXOnZ5aa	YES!!!|`|BWVDKixeaa	Not very often but I have. Sometimes as something is happening I start to feel that this a repeat and it's happened before.  It may last about 30 seconds or more then suddenly it stops. I don't know what will be said next but I actually feel like this has happened exactly the same way before. It's a feeling and it's very strange feeling.|`|cnyThvcMaa	all the time.<br>  <br>  sometimes i know what they're going to say BEFORE they say it.<br>  <br>  so i say "stop! this is what your're going to say" ..<br>  <br>  and i'm right :D|`|meyd1kYnaa	Yes I have. But what you experienced is not "Déjà vu" - that's just typical brotherly "thing"|`|EPPb5pRBaa	Yes, all the time..|`|Zcz8cXVRaa	yyeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh|`|e38ee5dc4874727a4e79ac3360093ac1aa	always have....|`|9bG4PRRUaa	yes<br>  its very creepy<br>  lately its been I dream something and it happens|`|uE2aOqeNaa	Yes I have. then three agents tried to kill me but Neo saw us fighting and came in and saved my sorry noob @$$

kNkORi3Aaa	<a href="http://watchtvsitcoms.com" rel="nofollow">http://watchtvsitcoms.com</a> > movies<br>  <br>  when the main thing pops up click cancel and then click OK...neat little way to bypass it...|`|0UYJkSuZaa	I like to go to www.watch-movies-links.net they normally have a link to a movie a few days after it is released to theaters. Though they aren't the best quality and you have to try a few links to get one that the bootlegger knew what they are doing, but this site has saved me so much money since I don't have to spend $10 to see it in the theater!<br>   PS this site is completely legal because they only provide you a link and once you click on it you are transferred to MEGAVIDEO, Supernova tube,Zshare, etc where the actual movie is uploaded to!|`|vYMYd156aa	Try out <a href="http://www.wfmon.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.wfmon.com</a>|`|ERz0KfyOaa	YouTube.  But not popular or new movies.  Try typing in the name of the movie in youtube, followed by "Part 1"  Youtube takes LOTS of stuff down for copyright reasons.  Other websites won't have them unless they are BitTorrent websites (Piracy Websites).  These websites can be packed with unwanted spyware, porm, viruses, etc.  You'd be best off just buying or renting the movie.  I have a friend who downloaded a movie off of one of these websites, and they tracked his IP address.  His internet company acyually called him and told him to stop pirating movies, or they would report it to the police.|`|s62iQmjdaa	I would say hulu is the best place i know of but it has like commecials in it if you don't mind that then its a good site and its free sad thing is you have to sign up for an account...|`|xgM0Hsv8aa	Hiiii...  , I am always here to answer your concern. I discovered great answer to ur concern. Search at - below link . I am sure you will be happy after you visit the link.|`|CTNI86Zsaa	Here's the lists of websites that you can watch movies for free.<br>  <br>  1. <a href="http://tvshack.net/movies/" rel="nofollow">http://tvshack.net/movies/</a><br>  2. <a href="http://www.watch-movies-links.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.watch-movies-links.net/</a><br>  3. <a href="http://www.free-tv-video-online.info/internet/movies/" rel="nofollow">http://www.free-tv-video-online.info/int...</a><br>  <br>  you don't need register an account.<br>  Enjoy Watching!! ^_^|`|sw2je9knaa	www.watch-movies-links.net is the best by far forget hulu or anything else. Just about any movie new and old. It's easy too no login but don't watch movies from megavideo they cut off.

The video isn't 'real life' - it was made by directors, producers and screenwriters. this is their gimmick to drive you insane.

6NZeItMAaa	Many Gemini persons may be said to be double. One trait of character seems to contradict another trait—in other words, they have a dual nature in active operation. They want to travel, and they want to stay at home. They wish to study, and they wish to play. They are happy and unhappy, satisfied and dissatisfied at the same time. They are in love and not in love; warm and cold in one breath.<br>  <br>  The Gemini people do not fly quite so high as the other denizens of the Air Triplicity, because the twins are not always agreed upon the destination. This contradiction causes a state of nervousness which is very hard to over-come. Gemini people are extremely af-fectionate and generous, very courteous and kind to all. They are proud of birth, and have a great deal of family pride. They are not a selfish or a penurious peo-ple. They are thoughtful of the poor, and very sympathetic with the suffering. They are fond of the arts and sciences, are great readers and good talkers, and very quick to see the point of a story or joke. <br>  <br>  Gemini people are often very executive with their hands, and can cut and plan, and see into a device or pattern, and, if not interfered with, will bring the work to beautiful completion. But they are not able to tell beforehand how they are going to do it. Explanations and arguments are impossible to the average Gemini person—in fact, to most of the Air people.<br>  <br>  Gemini women are especially fond of color, and of flowers, and of everything beautiful in nature and art.<br>  <br>  The finest efforts of the writers and poets that come under this sign are reached by inspiration and not by analysis or previous intellectual preparation. Both Emerson and Margaret Fuller Ossoli were born under Gemini, and are splendid illustrations of the true Gemini genius.|`|ElAy3yQBaa	well im gemini and im mean and i hate smiling|`|HQjo5ojfaa	Um, We are described as "superficial"??

No one has even said exactly whats suppose to happen, But I tell you what, think about this- do you want someone to call you and tell you when the nukes are coming. Really--think about it. You gonna worry yourself to death and not even get to make it to 2012. If the nukes do fall, your tongue is going to melt in your mouth- that's my prediction for 2012.|`|xgXzTWa5aa	a lot|`|jeMNcPPYaa	I don't actually follow horoscopes, or believe in them really.

aWEybdDFaa	Chickens evolved from non-chickens through small changes caused by the mixing of male & female DNA or by mutations to the DNA that produced the zygote. These changes and mutations only have effect at the point where new zygote is created. That is, two non-chickens mated and the DNA in their new zygote contained the mutation(s) that produced the first true chicken.<br>  <br>  Prior to that first true chicken zygote, there were only non-chickens. The zygote cell is only the place where DNA mutations could produce a new animal and the zygote cell is housed in the chicken's egg.

To ancient philosophers, the question about the first chicken or egg also evoked the questions of how life and the universe in general began.[1]<br>  <br>  Cultural references to the chicken and egg intend to point out the futility of identifying the first case of a circular cause and consequence. It could be considered that in this approach lies the most fundamental nature of the question, for a literal answer is somewhat obvious, as opposed to the logical fallacy of the metaphorical view, which sets a metaphysical ground on the dilemma. So, to understand its metaphorical meaning better, it could be reformulated as follows: "Which came first, X that can't come without Y, or Y that can't come without X?"|`|YYLzML9gaa	chicken..... duh|`|cefa4b46f9dbacdc72ace097afb9b897aa	Elementary, my dear Watson.. The rule is "i before e, except after c".<br>  <br>   So normally, " i " in "chicken" would come BEFORE "e" in "egg", but since the " i " is after the "c" in "chicken", it comes AFTER  the "e"  in "egg",  meaning "chicken" follows egg, and  therefore the egg came first.<br>  <br>  It's simply a matter of deduction.|`|4nWv0NRuaa	the chicken, in egg form.|`|l6Kii2Uiaa	You jest about what you suppose to be a triviality, in asking whether the hen came first from an egg or the egg from a hen, but the point should be regarded as one of importance, one worthy of discussion, and careful discussion at that."[|`|tDKQ8lwsaa	where the crap did this riddle originate??|`|m703KlwGaa	I hate these questions. <br>  <br>  <br>  ..egg|`|DTPERfnBaa	egg|`|Nc7clhzIaa	Well God made sand and turned it into people.

mNXHgEVWaa	well probably the naughtiest thing i did as a little kid was when i was in third grade there was this girl i hated (back when that was common). so when we were alone re-taking a test in this class after school the teacher left the room for a few minutes.  i, of course, jumped immaturely on the opportunity. i stood up, walked close to the girl (i think her name was ashley), and grabbed her head. then i quickly pushed her head onto her chair, sat on her face, and let out a really long, loud, and smelly fart right on her face!! after that i kept sitting there for a few minutes forcing her to smell it and i let go of her and sat back down in my seat just a few seconds before the teacher walked back in. when the teacher walked near ashley she must have smelled my fart and said "ashley do you need to go to the bathroom?" ashley said no and actually didn't ever tell on me because i guess that would be too akward. yeah what i did was really mean and stuff but it was hilarious. i told my friends and we all laughed for a while unitll it got old. but now me and ashley are friends and even dated for a while so things are much better than seven years ago.|`|vGjxpHD9aa	You sounded like a very naughty kid !

17281684a8c9fb76859999f1be18c50aaa	"INDIE" is short for Independent Artist, or an artist that hasn't been signed to a record label.|`|Cmun3Ec5aa	i'm sure there are hundreds of other people on Y!A who have asked the same, you should look at their answers.<br>  <br>  indie is a shortened term for 'independent', as in independent record labels. independent record labels tend to have a do-it-yourself approach to recording their music, and advertising it, without the funding and influence that major record labels provide. major record labels consist of Universal, Sony, Warner and EMI, which most mainstream artists are signed to, the remaining 18% are indie labels.<br>  <br>  however, 'indie' has become a genre of music, people seem to think. as the music produced from such record labels tended to be 'alternative/punk/rock' type of music, 'indie-rock' is now a sub-genre of music, though most artists included in the genre are usually from an independent backround. <br>  <br>  many popular mainstream artists are sometimes considered 'indie' when they are not. for example:<br>  <br>  -the killers are not indie - even though they could be considered 'alternative'  they are signed to Universal Music group.<br>  <br>  -however, the arctic monkeys who are fairly popular (well in the UK) are indie, as they are not signed to a major record label.<br>  <br>  but being 'indie' or not doesn't degrade the quality of music the band produces, and as long as they sound good, it doesn't really matter about their record label!

XM7WXyEQaa	Time and learning<br>  people are racist because they are ignorant about other culture and can't except anything out of their social norm <br>  new generations tend to be less racist then older ones because they are more open to things|`|ImgouTRIaa	Unfortunately, it won't. We may become a little more tolerant of each other, a little more enlightened, but given human nature, it's not going to happen , unless a race, I don't care which one ,is totally obliterated. If a race is gone from the face of the earth , you CAN'T go to work on them, not even if you wanted to. But it would not end there. Example, my son DESPISES people with brown eyes, even of his own race, guess what someone of that disposition  with some unchallenged power would do? I think I hear Adolph Hitler in the backround somewhere. It's an individual thing, it seems, so we as individuals have to minimize the  knee jerk reactions to those different than ourselves, and give everybody else a chance to prove their character first. Hopefully, by showing that good example, we can encourage others to do the same.|`|a577675893457f8844900f790e549222aa	I don't think it will completely end. People are too happy being miserable. I just keep being me, taking a person as a person and maybe it'll rub off ; )|`|MB1oT04maa	....certainly not this|`|atJxwFssaa	I think it requires continuous effort. But there is lesser racism today than there was a few decades ago, or so it seems. There are many evil things in the world that need to be tackled. I think its root cause is ignorance and insecurities.|`|8nIEuXplaa	While humans live it never will<br>  Most people think racisim is white against black but in reality it is one race against another, colour is irrelevant|`|lTLSqLOwaa	I don't think it will ever end, as long as groups such as kkk, neo-nazis are still alive our world will never progress. Hopefully it will in the near future and we can all live peacefully as one.|`|mh5NOsWzaa	sadly its an unwinnable war, i just dont understand why people even care when theres only 2 types of people in the world ...smart ones and dumb ones|`|2kR4sX48aa	you cant change people<br>  <br>  so i think only the bible has the cure for racism.|`|BGKIJeTGaa	At the end of times.|`|ZFTkBTvvaa	i think lincon will end racism.<br>  <br>  <br>  oh wait he did.<br>  <br>  all other things are bigotry, not racisim|`|AA10345820	Nuclear war.|`|W7l1awFPaa	You can't change anyone except yourself.  Keep doing your best to persuade them to your point of view but don't be surprised if they continue to behave exactly as before.  Personally I think there is only one race, the human race.<br>  Racism will end when Christ has full control of the Earth.|`|3Qv4GRIlaa	I really don't think that it will totally end.  There will always be someone that doesn't like someone based totally on their race...which is very sad.  I guess the only way I could try and change someone of their opinions is to talk to them and to pray for them.|`|GLd6cmlcaa	You can't end it. You can't change human nature. You can't make a law to stop it either you can only try to stop discrimination. Racism sadly will always be a part of human nature.|`|sxk08R2caa	i dont know tbh!<br>  i think racism will live on forever (unfortunately) because both black and white people are considered the same now, but there are still some people who disagree with this- unfortunately!|`|DkRqv6bRaa	ENERGY DRINKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1|`|AA10803956	When we all look the same. Kinda tan. Racism is stupid.|`|Wue4HTPtaa	smoke weed every day|`|AA12265821	i thought Obama would ...<br>  i was wrong !<br>  =[|`|TlqSAM0naa	I do not think that it will be ended. We have come really far since slavery, but people will believe what they want no matter what.<br>  <br>  My mom is stupid for being racist against African Americans. Maybe if she knew more about Obama && how he is helping the country, && that African Americans aren't all druggies or robbers [or whatever stupid idea she has], then she will not be racist anymore.<br>  <br>  I doubt it though, but I wish racism would stop. We are all homo-sapiens, no matter what our skin color is. Racist people make me angry at this world.|`|n55igpCUaa	We thought Lincoln would end racism<br>  We thought MLK, Jr. would end racism<br>  We think Obama will end racism... <br>  Meh... it's like the three deaths of rock and roll... it's not gonna end, but change.<br>  <br>  <-- Bolt is sad because everyone loves hate =(

AA10356243	I'm in the central US and know lots of people on both coasts who are radio fans and I'll answer it for you.<br>  <br>  Basically in Europe, you have many different radio stations and countries in a small area. Many areas of central Europe have countries that are only the size of small states in the US so you have many countries putting their own signals out there plus you also have the closeness to Asia and Africa helping.<br>  <br>  In the US, the land mass from the east is what hurts most people, as water is a great conduit for radio signals with many DXers trying for and receiving european AM stations at night, however land sucks up the signal as it can't bounce off the ground like it can the water and basically why you only are able to receive mostly west cost signals for.<br>  <br>  The west coast however has it's own targets including many of the smaller island chains that broadcast, China,Taiwan,Australia and others are active in English on Short wave among others so don't count yourself out yet.

HoHHpwDlaa	Yeah. Hookahs are legal. The tobacco you put in the hookah, called shisha, is legal. <br>  <br>  but, should you put illegal drugs inside the hookah, (which, mind you, is gross), then THAT would be illegal. well, the hookah wouldn't, but the drugs would. <br>  <br>  So yeah, that's why you see hookah places, stores that sell hookahs and shisha and all that good stuff. If it was  illegal then those places would be shut down soo fast. <br>  <br>  so there you go :]|`|7hrOjPwjaa	Yes they are legal.

nr9q4XvNaa	I have a father and a younger sister who are cancers. In my experience with them(I'm a Leo sun) fire signs will have a rough start with them since we are opposite elements(even if inside,we can be both emotional signs) and they should be patient with them if they wanted to get into their good side(this Leo took like 16+ years to figure out how..lol), they are very scary when they are mad(growing up,when my father gets mad he tends to get physical and he calls us plenty of nasty names. When my younger sister gets mad she resorts to the "silent treatment"like she's retreating back to her shell then resurface again a day or 2 after)they are moody(my father can be a funny in a minute then next he's pretty despicable. My sister likes to laugh with my jokes/teases then next thing she takes it personally and gets bitchy) Both are close to their mother/have a good relationship with mother(My father really loves our grandmother,i think he's closer to her than his father.. my younger sister prefers our mother even if she(my sister) kind of acts like father sometimes)they are not really good listeners and are stubborn...it's pretty hard to change their minds(I know my father is,when i talk to him about something he pretends to listen then act as if we never have the talk..my younger sister listens but doesn't really like to change her views on something even if there's a good explanation behind my words)they are sensitive people..(but they tend not to show it,both of my cancer relatives don't but admit that they are sensitive)they are shy(my father tries to mask his shyness/awkwardness by laughing while talking..which fails because the people he talk to ended up not understanding him very much and my sister,specially when she is younger,is always looking on the ground when talking to others or if she's walking..now however,she's more open even if she can still be shy towards strangers)those are just some behaviors i notice around my cancer relatives. In the end,if you learn to get along with them(like know what mood they are on or what buttons not to push during that mood is important..i think that's part of the reason why i get along better with them now lol)they are good-hearted,patient and generous people that likes to have plenty of friends to laugh with.|`|99lrxv52aa	Im a Cancer and love it.

I hate them. I don't like any of the cancers I have ever met.<br>  they are hyper sensitive, clingy, over emotional, whiny, moody cry babies who complain all of the time and want to look like a victim so that they can get attention. they're always like "look at me. I'm a victim feel sorry for me" they are way too sensitive and get defensive over the smallest things then get an attitude. they're a pain in the butt. You can never take them anywhere without them getting upset over something. they are very fake, emotionally selfish people. I don't care what astrology says about them being nurturing, they are fake. they try to look all tough, but they're not. hard on the outside and soft on the inside. they cling to you like a leach and throw hissy fits if you want to spend time with other people without them like you don't have any friends and you're only purpose on this world is to be their for them when they need you. they are very moody. one minute they don't want to be bothered and the next minute they're upset because they feel like you're not giving them emough attention. ugh I can't stand them.<br>  <br>  *EDIT<br>  ?{}[]?<br>  I'm not hating on you just because it makes you feel better to say I am. there's nothing to hate on|`|ded7fc19860a81607ee52a6560480ab2aa	cancers are loyal to family and friends, they are very stubborn, and they are very good at whatever they do, my son tom is a cancer, i am a capricorn.|`|plBXp91Daa	They are sweet and funny you can laugh with them and have long conversation with them.

qswrz268aa	Well, there's some Chopin preludes, in E minor, and A major. <br>  <br>  There's also some great songs by McCdowell, Sea piece (sometimes just called "song") and to a wild rose. <br>  <br>  Schumann's "About strange lands and people" and "Trumarie" are pretty easy too.<br>  <br>  I recommend these two books, which have a great sample of easier classical music, by Denes Agay.<br>  <br>  The first book... <a href="http://www.sheetmusicplus.com/store/smp_inside.html?item=3603947&cart=34441955421270206&type=image&page=01&cm_re=detail-_-lookInside-_-thumbnail:inside" rel="nofollow">http://www.sheetmusicplus.com/store/smp_...</a><br>  <br>  The sequal... <a href="http://www.sheetmusicplus.com/store/smp_detail.html?item=3603963&cart=34441955421270206&cm_re=289.1.4-_-Results+Item-_-Title" rel="nofollow">http://www.sheetmusicplus.com/store/smp_...</a><br>  <br>  Really, these two books are FANTASTIC!

uKXgg9heaa	The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. My favorite movie in the world is The Bridges of Madison County.|`|BJERgbM5aa	I recommend ALL his movies.  His western movies are slangly called "spaghetti westerns".  Mainly because they were made in Europe (Italy) and many voices of the cast had to be dubbed.  All of his movies are listed on the Eastwood website.  Check it out.  His westerns and his police movies are very popular, but he's made plenty of others that are really good too.|`|yqe0I5zpaa	Gran Torino<br>  Changeling<br>  Mystic River<br>  Blood Work<br>  Space Cowboys<br>  True Crime<br>  The Bridges Of Madison County<br>  In The Line Of Fire<br>  Bronco Billy<br>  Firefox<br>  Sudden Impact<br>  Unforgiven<br>  Flags Of Our Fathers<br>  Letters From Iwo Jima<br>  Hang Em' High<br>  A Fistful Of Dollars<br>  Coogan's Bluff|`|O21k4xn1aa	High Plains Drifter a cool type of supernatural Western movie. I highly recommend it.  Also The Outlaw Josey Wales, that's an absolute classic and one of Eastwood's best IMO.  There's also Hang 'Em High, Fistfull of Dollars and the sequel For a Few Dollars More.  Heartbreak Ridge is good, but that's a military type movie.|`|BOEjPLqBaa	Don't know about his old western's but the movie he has out now, Grand Torino is a good one.  Also though he was not in the movie he did direct Mystic River with an allstar cast including  Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon, Laurence Fishburne.  Also he directed Changeling which again he is not in but did star Angelina Jolie and was a very good movie also.|`|3dcc2948a003c40d98c8ef0d9a516e9baa	the man with no name westerns:<br>  The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly  10/10<br>  Fistful of Dollars 9/10<br>  For a Few Dollars More 7/10<br>  <br>  Must sees:<br>  The Outlaw Josey Whales<br>  High Plains Drifter<br>  The Beguiled<br>  <br>  Other good ones<br>  Pale Rider<br>  In The Line of Fire<br>  Gran Torino<br>  Play Misty For Me<br>  Hang Em High

Holmes is known for his deductive ability even as a youth, amazing his classmates.

IVy35SE2aa	astrology shows the influences operating in your life but it does not<br>  say what you are going to do about them.  How you handle<br>  a situation can be quite different if you are aware of problems.<br>  You can go to www.ifate.com to set up a horoscope<br>  that may give you some clues.  Another site is:<br>  <a href="http://interactive.0800-horoscope.com/cgi-bin/astro/natal0800?" rel="nofollow">http://interactive.0800-horoscope.com/cg...</a><br>  <br>  that gets a pretty good horoscope.  They try to send you to other locations where they sell you "easier" ones.  But the free one is good.

I have fainted a few times, its usually because of lack of oxygen to the brain (postural hypo tension etc) so your body ends up on the floor, where its more likely to get oxygen (not got gravity to fight against). I have no recollection of dreaming. You aren't "out" for long enough... my brother had severe head injury and was in a coma for several months, he says he didn't dream and has no Memory of that time either... i think your brain shuts down to heal, so you don't enter dream state.|`|iq7ZHua6aa	I fainted couple of times in my life... While I was out in the sun for long time, when I was in the art room with strong smell of paints, etc etc<br>  <br>  Anyway, yes I did dream when i faint. It's just an ordinary dream but everytime I get conscious, I wake up in a shock... but I clearly remember the dream.... It's a weird feeling I will never forget|`|c1XvN0BVaa	I don't think one would dream because I think you need to be in REM to dream. When you faint, I don't think you get to the REM state. But I'm not a doctor.|`|hsyI1DxDaa	I don't have an answer, but I like the question, I'm curious myself.|`|nGpBuI9Oaa	i think so|`|BGKIJeTGaa	Never fainted before.

The songwriting credit on the Coldplay song is attributed to the band's four members: singer Chris Martin, bass player Guy Berryman, guitarist Jonny Buckland and drummer Will Champion. A spokesperson for Coldplay could not be reached for comment at press time. <br>  <br>  Satriani isn't the only artist who has claimed the Coldplay song was eerily familiar. Around the time of the album's release, a lesser-known New York band named Creaky Boards claimed that Martin had attended one of their gigs and would have heard the tune "The Songs I Didn't Write," which also bears a similar melody. At the time, Coldplay's spokespeople denied that Martin was at the gig and said the band had written "Viva" several months before that show. <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  Adult<br>  Hate<br>  Spam<br>  Other<br>     <br>  <br>  Submit Your Comment   Cancel Comments 1- 20of 22Comments <br>  Join up for a free account or log in if you're already a member. <br>  Comments on this Article89<br>    dosvolcanes posted on 02.17.09 at 12:32amflag <br>  I wonder why colplay would not try to rip a harder song to play than "If I could Fly", they could try to rip Satriani's Time Machine or Satch Boogie, you need about 7 fingers to play that, but I doubt coldplay guitarrist is able to do that, not enough talent there. <br>    <br>  <br>    dosvolcanes posted on 02.17.09 at 12:25amflag <br>  Some of you are too young to five an educated opinion about this matter or simply have never used a guitar with the exception of your GuitarHero rig, even George Harrison -yes, him- was accused and lost a plagiarism suit in the UK and ended buying the rights of the song he was supposed to have copied, "My Sweet Lord" a number 1 worldwide hit, so it cost him a lot of money to get that matter closed, also some Deep Purple songs like Black Night were thought to be copies of other songs but never got to court, so Satriani can make big bucks on this suit and as someone else noted here you always try to create and will pick some things out of the songs you listen to, but not necessarily copy those. In regards of the incredible statement that coldplay BROUGHT orchestral music to pop, gimme a break, this guy must be 13 or 14, orchestras have been playing not only 10 years with pop bands, the Beatles used them in 66, The Moody Blues play orchestras in almost any single song they play in the late 60's and had to settle with devices like synths since those days, and by the way there is a full line of guys playing with orchestras and classical lines called progressive rock - everyone under 20 might have never heard about them - represented majestically by ELP and Yes, I think Colplay is not a great band but you do not find too many good bands nowadays so one has to be the top dog and sadly at least for me a rather average band like them is top dog. <br>    <br>  <br>    ex50boston posted on 01.20.09 at 09:45amflag <br>  "evilelf7 posted on 12.11.08 at 10:47pmflag coldplay brought the orchestal music into the rock world and combined strings with the rythem section" I also made an account on here to say one thing, and that is to you. Whoever you are you need to listen to Led Zeppelin. There are tons of their songs that incorperate Orchestral music and Jimmy Page's extrodinary guitar riffs. Dont assume Coldplay is a revolutionary band in modern rock. Yeah I like their music and I dont care wether that tiny bit of music that sounds fairly similar was actually plagerism or not, but they are just another pop band. They are not musical geniuses or revolutionaries. Go listen to Kashmir and quit complaining. <br>    <br>  <br>    cellevain posted on 12.17.08 at 10:04amflag <br>  Alright... for people who are saying the songs aren't similar, watch this.

VYS1VfFXaa	Anime > Anime Movies > Manga<br>  <br>  In that order.<br>  <br>  I enjoy the longevity of the anime series and the fact that it's animated and you can hear the character's voices.<br>  <br>  The movies are good because they have a higher budget and the animation is generally better, but it's much shorter.<br>  <br>  Manga isn't animated, therefore not as fun to me.

AA10021017	good morn..well have you taken a course in medical transcribing? if not you have no chance my docs cant even read my handwriting without the assistance of a transcriber, but still given my druthers i prefer handwriting because i still haven't mastered the 2 finger keystroke method of typing yet...another 10 years i should be proficient enough to type a grocery list if its short..|`|AA11101434	Noooooo, never in a million years. I can't read it myself once I've forgotten the context. In primary (elementary) school we only got to do joined-up writing once the teacher was pleased enough with our printing. At the time, I was the only person EVER to be demoted back to printing after being allowed to do handwriting. Later on, they tole me my writing was too big. "Right," thought I, "we'll show ya!". I ended up with writing that had all the right strokes in it, but that you had to use a magnififying glass to read it. My writing these days is still pretty similar, but these days has no internal consistency - I have about three different g's and a couple of p's and so on. I'm a handwritten nightmare!|`|PniClUZtaa	sorta maybe depends on how much i have to write|`|ef019cfbfac8800f4935b6a537172515aa	Would depend on whether or not I was using the left hand or the right one..<br>    or maybe the left one would be the right one..<br>  <br>    and you would get it much faster if I wrote it instead of typing it..<br>  <br>    My spell check for hand written words is in four volumes..<br>  <br>   #1...Webster's New World Dictionary..Unabridged<br>   #2...The Bad Spellers Dictionary<br>   #3...Using the Right Word<br>   #4...Reverse Dictionary<br>  <br>   I do enjoy writing to friends..and hearing from them...<br>  <br>   Want to get on the list?|`|QlBLZ4tVaa	I think some answers on here would be much easier to read if handwritten.

a40380daa8f8c7c0761b53d6ecfddb40aa	My cousin said that when he's in the mood, it doesn't matter if she's on her period or not. He said, "If you want it, you want it... period or not." I find it gross, too, but I've never found myself in that position. I honestly don't see how women can be aroused when they're on their period, because I, like you, just want it to be over. I've also read that having sex while on your period eases cramps, so that may be a reason why women do it, lol.|`|mJbwemH8aa	If they did it because the man asked for it then its selfishness from him, and she accepted that so i feel pity for her, sometimes women ask for it at the real end of it, some women dont have it some and some and some, but to get the end here, it varies between one and another..<br>  <br>  <br>  ..|`|a118b8144112704be52f2ab81596333baa	Maybe this song will clear things up:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zh8qu7Z-NJ0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zh8qu7Z-N...</a>|`|AA10804824	I've done worse.

I'd never do it, but you CAN get pregnant because it's clearing away all that "gunk" and releasing an egg at the same time.<br>  Yeah tell your partner or they may just get this horrified look on their face and never hvae sex with you again.<br>  No it doesn't matter how bad the flow is and some guys are just horny enough not to care|`|CYhOr4s7aa	nasty  but some care little about how nasty it is , the dude cant feel to much for the lady, and vise versa,  if she lets him|`|0ff2304aa58946a2151ca64e5d9e7cd9aa	So you stain the sheets red instead of yellow; what's the big deal?  It all depends on whether the woman is up to it, and after a few years you let your hair down.|`|Wrf5orAuaa	Many women feel sexy at that time. With washers, lube, and perseverance, sex can be very nice for both.|`|BsAQE1Hyaa	Sounds like a bloody good time if you ask me...haha.<br>  <br>  Although remember RED MEANS STOP! :D|`|7nRom97Daa	to each their own, it does help to relieve bad cramping|`|PEz2YMeXaa	Yeah...I was eating like 5 seconds ago...<br>  <br>  Douche|`|Rb5rW8nvaa	red wings mmmmmmmmmmmm|`|7Sslop1Baa	The desire is irresistible.|`|1Z8b5qgEaa	when your hot your hot... but personally  I really dont like ketchup on my hotdog|`|JEg9THbNaa	Yuck! i agree that is disgusting. <br>  <br>  but information wise you can't get pregnant if you have sex while you're having your period. a few days before your period your body is adding more padding to your uterus in preparation for an egg to make it its home, so it can protect the growing baby. when you have your period the time is up and the egg can no longer be impregnated, so the blood is actually the body getting ride of the egg and the extra padding in the uterus.  But there are a few cases where a women will get pregnant having sex this was, some women are just really fertile. <br>  <br>  but please just buy a condom or go on the pill like a normal person.<br>  (a little side note – my mother is a doctor, that is the only reason that I know this.)|`|Am1wfhBDaa	I've always been repulsed by the mess it leaves behind.

It also sounds like a steel-build Bridge made for heavy trains crossing the Rhine.<br>  This could be the sound of surfin on steel while passing a power plant on the banks of the Rhine.|`|rv9pdAqmaa	Let me put it this way -<br>  <br>  They caused a lot of waves on wich other bands (David Bowie, Human League, Depeche Mode, Duran Duran, Alphaville, O.M.D., Rammstein, Ultravox or Front 242) surfed on.<br>  <br>  LG-P<br>  <br>  @Kraftfried - nobody could say it better!!!!<br>  LG-P

My wife is fighting cancer and when you are doing that your focus changes.  Petty things lose their meaning, and you try to make the most of your life.<br>  <br>  Each one of us are living one moment at a time.  There is no guarantees that you will be here even one hour from now.  That is how I live.<br>  <br>  Harm nobody, be thankful for what you have, appreciate life, and give if you possibly can.  <br>  <br>  Sometimes I find myself slipping into old worn out habits, like swearing in traffic.  Then I remember that it was the old me, and the old me was different from who I am now.  <br>  <br>  Wanting material possessions, never being satisfied with what you have, getting ahead by putting others down, bullying to get your way, promising anything as long as you get what you want, and plain old stealing, lying, and killing is for those that want, and cannot be satisfied because there is always something greater, better, or newer.  <br>  <br>  Why is somebody usually evil?<br>  <br>  It is because they try to find things to give them happiness and they will do anything to get it.  The more they want the more evil they become.  Up to and including murder.<br>  <br>  It is easy to live when all you want to do is live, and I am very happy doing that.  All I want in this life now, is my wife to be cancer free.  All I want is my health so that I can help her get through this.  <br>  <br>  Because I want only these things and they are out of my hands, I pray to God and he comforts me.  I have faith he will provide me with my needs.  <br>  <br>  Whatever that makes me that is what I have become.

pDLZ6BGyaa	Astrologers can't agree on this...<br>  some say you are on a "cusp" and will have traits of both signs<br>  others say rubbish the sun can only be in one zodiac at a time<br>  personally, I think there is such thing as a cusp and mixed traits..this is based on the cuspies i know and theyre personalities|`|sIJ6jxNdaa	i read somewhere that if you are in the borderline between two signs you have traits from the other sign like you may have some aries traits but you will always be a pisces|`|ufdFei1jaa	You are on what is known as the cusp.|`|3WItFAwlaa	There is no such thing as cusps.  The Sun can only be in one place at a time.  Go to astro.com to get a free chart.  A complete chart will make you aware of your strengths.|`|7p3TCz3qaa	You are only one sign,nothing happens when you're born on the cusp of two signs.It means you were born in the last degrees of one sign or the first degrees of the next.Each sun sign covers a 30 degree area of the sky so when the sun is leaving one sign and entering the next this is called the cusp,but you can only be one sign.Whatever degree of the sky the sun is in at the time of your birth you are the sign ruling that area.Hope this helps you.

56bNLJykaa	um i've seen a few really good modern day movies from even as recent as 2000+, some of my favorites. but the general quality of movies during the 30s (and earlier as well in terms of sculpting cinema)-even through the 60s was at its best. and anyone who tells you differently really doesnt know what they are talking about. I'm not sure if we will ever see as brilliant directors as we had during that period (the renaissance if you will of cinema)- Fellini, Bergman, Godard, Truffaut, Rossellini, Carl Th Dreyer, Kurosawa, Billy Wilder, Michelangelo Antonioni, Melville, Orson Welles, Hitchcock, list goes on and on.. Some of the better new directors are Wong Kar Wai, Almodvar, Scorsese, Gonzales Inarittu, Allen, etc.|`|DjbCw7ePaa	I prefer classic musicals.|`|taMKteLVaa	modern day, fo sho. :)|`|UYCvwh6Paa	A bit of both....But mainly I rent the new stuff.|`|7lkLZ57Saa	Old classics.<br>  <br>  But the definition of old classics depends on how old you are.<br>  <br>  I mean the 40s and 50s.

ONWCXzUMaa	The truth all of them, it is very sad we don't get all the good bands and artist in.<br>  BQ: there's to many to mention here, but I will give a few; Johnny Winters one of the best rock/blue guitarist around. Bands like Emerson Lake & Palmer, Grand Funk Railroad [in my opion one of the greatest rock bands in America], Saga, Ten Years After, Spooky Tooth an Steppenwolf, one the first heavy rockers around. <br>  take care<br>  dave|`|wOc4Dqllaa	CCR!

They do occasionally get mentioned, but given their place & impact in rock history, I always thought they would've gotten more love here on R&P.  I've always considered them one of the top 5 bands of all time along w/ The Beatles, Floyd, The Who & Zeppelin.|`|AA11039335	Zappa - he's my favourite out of the four, and such a popular genius?

AA10053661	It would be stunning. Maybe difficult...... but probably enlightening. Sometimes we just can't see certain aspects of ourselves. And if someone who is totally unbiased can watch us and see not only what we do, but can analyze why we do it....... it is just stunning!

bYbSVvR4aa	Scorpios like many says can be rather revengeful but on other hand they are pretty loyal and passionate people... ESPecially If they are deeply in love with you... Thus i feel it is quite unlikely that they wouldnt commit unless his SUN sign is not strong and influenced by his MOON or RISING...<br>  <br>  Nevertheless, if u break up with them, is EITHER:<br>  1) they will jus let u go since they are extreme ppl..<br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  2) they will still want you (provided they really did love u in the 1st  place)<br>  <br>  Yups.|`|gHxCVVqKaa	If I loved the person and they broke up with me for not committing, then I would go and commit very quickly, and that person wouldn't say "no" to coming back, because no one commits to a relationship better than a Scorpio.  I probably only held off committing because I wasn't sure about the other person, but since they were concerned about me not committing, then everything would be okay.<br>  <br>  If I didn't love the person, and they broke up with me for not committing, I would probably in all fairness let them go without a fuss.  I might even try to make the break easier for them by explaining why it didn't work.  <br>  <br>  Breaking up for non-committal behavior on my part, when I am not in love with the person, is not grounds for unleashing my Scorpio vengeance.  Scorpio vengeance should be reserved for when my significant other breaks up with me for another girl, or because he finds me inadequate in some way.  Then he had better buy a cup, because he won't have a prayer of keeping his balls without one! (neither physically nor metaphorically)|`|e4h5yVXgaa	I would like them even less!!! It would be fine by me!<br>  <br>  I mean **** (how irritating!!!) what's the rush??<br>  Even if I loved the person, I would definitely let them go! I as a Scorpio, do not take commitments lightly.<br>  <br>  If I didnt love the person samething.<br>  <br>  I feel that out of respect the other person should understand, I mean look around... are people not analytical... are they that desperate? why do they just settle?<br>  <br>  Anyhow I'm not going to elaborate Isador, I've seen/read your plethora of inquirie's... I wouldnt want a commitment w you either, honestly. It would feel like an obligation.<br>  <br>  You need to work on yourself first (and I'm definitely not talking about your weight), before any relationship would work. I mean even if you were to get a commitment out of him, then you two would deserve each other or it wouldnt last.<br>  <br>  Stop obsessing and anticipating the negative. What do you want hime to say to you? "I'm yours forever?". That's not the way it works. People who find lasting love in reality are verrrrry few!! But I believe you can find it if you let go and give yourself every time (that's how you learn about yourself and become stronger).  Just bc sth doesnt work out the way you'd like 99.9 percent of the time, it's nothing personal. Even super models and elite's of this world get dumped, sooo... step into reality and look around.|`|VQcmReqRaa	well I have very strong Scorpio rising in me and if my bf (he's a cancer) broke up with me for not committing I would still stick with my decision and just move on I guess<br>  I believe in a quote "it just wasnt meant to be"|`|fF1WbPltaa	Warn them that I would drop them if they didn't mend  and set a time limit on this improvement. Then I'd do it. This applies if I loved them. If I didn't Iove them I'd just drop them anyway.|`|36PrVK7Oaa	Stop being so secretive and admit U really love the 53X, not the person.

vW0f8a8Faa	Family guy is a show that only appeals to people who have no idea what good TV is. Don't think of TV as a way to burn 30 mins, but as i look into the world of art.<br>  <br>  Family Guy is a funny show, but it is so poorly constructed. With loose plot lines, no character development, and consistent use of cutaway gags, its a wonders as to why the show hasn't been permanently shut down.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying don't watch family guy because its bad, i'm saying don't declare that the show is the greatest of all time just because its funny. <br>  <br>  There are much better show out there :<br>  South Park<br>  The Simpsons<br>  King of the Hill.|`|oWicCn28aa	Becaus it's just not funny.  It was funny when it was first starting out but now they present only three kinds of humor: a) during a situation a character will say "this is worse than the time" or "this reminds me" and then include an unrelated flashback with an obscure pop culture reference.  b) it will just hammer the audience over the head with the same joke over and over again and it will go on for way to long, the chicken is a good example of this.  c) the characters will have a judd apatowesque conversation meant to mimic real people talking about funny stuff.  Heads up, it's not funny, just extremely drawn out and boring.  The writers are just not very smart.  Also, whenever Seth McFarlane presents his political agenda, it's either unoriginal or blatantly anti-conservative to the point where it's annoying.  An unoriginal agenda: at the end of one episode, peter gives an impromptu speech about not blaming television for having shows that people deem offensive and how people should pay more attention to their kids.  This argument has been presented a million time before and in much cleverer ways.  A blatantly anti-conservative agenda: having the nazis wear mccain palin 2008 buttons.  First of all, I am not a hardcore conservative or liberal.  However, if you are going to make fun of a politician, it should be relevant.  I don't think anyone thought mccain or palin were going to be evil republican tyrants.  If you had a Bush Cheney 2004 button on the nazis, that would be more relevant.  However, considering there were better ways to satire Mccain and Palin, I think Seth McFarlane was just trying to garner democrat votes.  An artist should never use a piece of work purely for propaganda, which McFarlane does.  Also, it's good when you're an artist not to take sides.|`|brORsmr3aa	because its bad.|`|Xi5eJGKGaa	Because its straight up retarded...the reason why people think its funny is because they're into that "random" retarded kind of humor, which is okay only in moderation but Family Guy takes it to a whole new level...Now South Park is funny.<br>  <br>  -That dude down there just said south park is significantly less intelligent...man you're a moron!!! south park is one of the most if not the most intelligent comedy shows around...you probably just can't keep up with the wittiness with your lame o dumbfck sense of humor...oh and i'm not a conservative either fool AND I'm aware of most of the pop culture references on their too, so their goes your theory.<br>  <br>  this is the formula for every single family guy episode..."remember the time I ___ with ____ while ____ at ____"...right there, thats every episode.|`|whE5OQ26aa	I tend to find really obnoxious people like it. It's a good indicator I probably don't like that person.|`|UYCvwh6Paa	Lets see...<br>  <br>  The lead character is an obnoxious moron, who is rude, irresponsible, and a complete a$$. He needs to be shot.<br>  <br>  A buddy of his, is a slimy disgusting pervert who would have no qualms about screwing his wife and daughter. The buddy needs to be neutered.<br>  <br>  There is also a sick freak of an old geezer who likes to chase young boys around and fantasize about the leads oldest son. Sorry, creepy old guys like this... neutered painfully then shot and pissed on.<br>  <br>  The wife, an intelligent woman with her head up her a-s. The family dog talks, is the baby's sitter and has the hots for the wife. Stupid plot.<br>  <br>  The show is tastless, crude and not worth watching.<br>  <br>  The only bareable character is a brilliant, power hungrey toddler who wants to kill his mother.|`|16e94bf24b6e37847feefaa920420580aa	I like that show, especially when the chicken comes out of nowhere and fights peter. lol.|`|Y63Q4bnOaa	Because some people just don't have a sense of humor|`|I7qHLCQqaa	I love family guy, but the T.V. show can touch on some very sensitive issues at times. The writers and producers acknowledge the sensitivity of the subject they present, they just neglect it; its not that they are unaware of possible irritation and discrimination, they suppress the idea of it being sensitive, and run the clips regardless. In this way the show actually contributes to society; they attempt to make sensitive issues insignificant and less influential by creating humor within its issues and hence establish whatever the issue may be as a societal norm. <br>  In my opinion family guy symbolizes the high point in the evolvement of comedy. Things people thought as funny 30 years ago is clearly different from contemporary taste in humor. Although granted each individual has a different taste in comedy, Family Guy has united many viewers of a variety of diverse backgrounds; people of many races and ages find the show clever. <br>  <br>  And it is. Family Guy, or their writers, have a certain gift of the mind. No question. The humor in thats show is very advanced, and it is overall a pretty intelligent show. <br>  <br>  Punchlines compare and contrast different scenarios and circumstances and twist assumptions to accomodate the contrary. <br>  <br>  It is no doubt one of my most favorite shows of all time. But, surely, it can, and does, get old. Or sometimes anyway.|`|BHeBSGemaa	I love family guy, but a lot of people find it offensive. I am surprised at some of the stuff they say on there sometimes. I definitely don't think that it's the worst show on tv! There are some horrible ones out there and family guy isn't one of them.|`|4d2a746b2c406b888ee53ccce2cd95e0aa	i love family guy, dont know what the hell they're talking about.... i think tho that the randomness makes them like;"what, that is so random?" lol!...|`|oWFsc0cCaa	Weirdos.|`|kdlWcH3zaa	Well, I've never watched, and the way the characters are drawn pisses me off.|`|1iSXOnZ5aa	i like Family Guy|`|MAGcwMUfaa	i like Family Guy.|`|xGNM8J6yaa	Because its not funny|`|FEVQisMGaa	What's ironic is...<br>  <br>  That most of the pop cultural references, etc. can only be appreciated by those over the age of 25.<br>  <br>  I'm a nerd, so I understand about 97% of the things they joke about. Sometimes the really obscure ones go over my head because I'm too young to understand/appreciate them.<br>  <br>  With that said you can't argue that it's hated and misunderstood because of the age group that it caters to. <br>  <br>  The Simpsons do the same exact thing with their broad range of humor, but no one is crucifying them for it.<br>  <br>  In fact, The Simpsons was criticized for similar things when it was starting up, now most people have come to accept that it's part of the general cultural tapestry.<br>  <br>  The only people I know that b---h about Family Guy are conservatives/right-wing extremists because they know the political insults are directed at them. The contemporaries of the people who b---hed about The Simpsons.<br>  <br>  It's not fair to say that, but it's generally true.<br>  <br>  Even my "libertarian" friends are pissed off, but that's because they're closet neo-cons. They obviously won't go so far as to censor it though.<br>  <br>  Mostly they'll say about Family Guy: "Oh, it's not because I'm conservative. It's because the humor is too random and non sequitur."<br>  <br>  And then the "intelligentsia" really doesn't give a f--k because they'd rather be listening to classical music they downloaded from the NPR podcast (to play on their Zune).<br>  <br>  And then when you address the randomness of the show by directing them to American Dad (another show by Seth Macfarlane) which has a very cohesive plot and less deviation, they'll complain that it's too obscene.<br>  <br>  To me, it's clearly political. They're too entrenched in their own beliefs to laugh at themselves and the absurdity of things.<br>  <br>  American Dad is consistently voted Worst Show by conservative media watchdog group(s).<br>  <br>  Among them: <a href="http://www.parentstv.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.parentstv.org/</a><br>  <br>  Seth Macfarlane makes absolutely no reservations about his beliefs on American Dad. I think most of the cast is left leaning w/ the exception of Adam West (a.k.a Mayor West/Himself)<br>  <br>  That's the root of their dislike.<br>  <br>  Most of the haters just end up watching South Park--a significantly less intelligent show.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Another aspect of it is that Family Guy is reliant on a lot of inside jokes. Family Guy n00bs are alienated at times, because they're kept out of the loop.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Oh, come on! It has nothing to do with the writing on the show. It has everything to do with the politics.<br>  <br>  Most liberals hate South Park.<br>  Most conservatives hate Seth Macfarlane.<br>  Moderates win because they think it's all hilarious.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Pray tell, how does Seth Macfarlane garner Democrat votes when he's not running for political office? He's a Democrat, and he's expressing HIS beliefs on HIS show on a Network owned by Rupert Murdoch. He's not alone in doing so.<br>  <br>  Olivia Wilde, on House, has done similarly. There was one particular scene where her character "13" was in a bathroom stall, or something, and there was on Obama sticker on the bathroom walls.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I love the musical sequences.

Here's one for you:<br>  <br>  A young man saw an elderly couple sitting down to lunch at McDonald's. He noticed that they had ordered one meal, and an extra drink cup. As he watched, the gentleman carefully divided the hamburger in half, then counted out the fries, one for him, one for her, until each had half of them. Then he poured half of the soft drink into the extra cup and set that in front of his wife. The old man then began to eat, and his wife sat watching, with her hands folded in her lap. <br>  <br>  The young man decided to ask if they would allow him to purchase another meal for them so that they didn't have to split theirs. <br>  <br>  The old gentleman said, "Oh no. We've been married 50 years, and everything has always been and will always be shared, 50/50." <br>  <br>  The young man then asked the wife if she was going to eat, and she replied, "It's his turn with the teeth."|`|Jaw2sW3eaa	Ha ha ha !

aiY7ei6yaa	hi, drape. good to see you.<br>  <br>  believe it or not, anchovy and pineapple pizza is my favorite.<br>  <br>  it may sound bad, but it RAWKS!|`|NyBKQx2Aaa	Pineapple for sure. I remember once when I was a kid, my sister ordered pizza over the phone, they asked if she wanted anchovies, we didn't know what they were at the time so she said yes, and we got the pizza, it was horrible, we checked the dictionary and found out it was some type of fish, very sad, we threw the pizza away and starved.|`|AkuUGjoHaa	Alone I say anchovies.<br>  With friends I choose pineapple.<br>  <br>  Fishy breath with friends is not nice.|`|xKtXN50Haa	I love both depending on what I put them on, but I do love fresh pineapple, so delicious.|`|YljbIqskaa	Pineapple.|`|DzIlM76Xaa	Never had anchovies.

jK9o1ilwaa	who knows... they'll bring in some much prettier younger girl he'll fall for.... does anyone know who this mystery woman is he was talking to awhile back????|`|r7sgshwKaa	Come on now you know the answer to this one. He runs thru whoever is available then he goes back to his beloved flavor of the month...Nikki. I hope this time she turns his wrinkled *** down. He needs to lay down and take a nap or do some pushups or something.|`|2f8d927b404e673e434c880af431f65caa	Victor and Niki will probably get close again after some family crisis. It`s about time for another fling for them. Victor will be there to comfort Niki after Casey dies or Summer gets sick if there still going to that.|`|fcPiQDwEaa	Good question, but l agree with those who said Sharon!|`|AA10252869	Sharon|`|EPPb5pRBaa	Maybe Jill.|`|WJW4qOlUaa	Maybe Ester after she gets her heart broken!|`|Am1wfhBDaa	Lol, why not Sharon, she has been to bed with just about every one there so far.|`|PRDZmeiEaa	Hmmmm..... What about Heather Stevens... Ya I'm joking...Everyone knows that once he is done with Ashley it WILL be Nikki again b/c they love going in circles
EPPb5pRBaa	I agree, That was a bad Choice. & When he finds out Karen told her that. he will be mad.|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	I really don't know - this is such a mess.  They finally got her some stability and she was excited about her new science project and now she is on the run with Tyra!  <br>  <br>  Neil will definitely be upset with Karen and rightfully so.  However, I don't think that's the only reason that she ran.  <br>  <br>  I also don't think Tyra will gain any points with Neil for doing that.|`|Am1wfhBDaa	I'm thinking they will catch Tyra before she makes it out of town. Karen looks to me like the might have some deep psychosis and may turn very dark at any given moment, I think she is going to ambush Neil and hurt him.|`|r7sgshwKaa	I don't know but I was ready for them to go anyway. Tyra acted like a spoiled child during that scene because she couldn't get her way with adopting Ana. Running away is so gay. If she thought her back was up against the wall why didn't she just talk to Neil about it? Now the two of them will be on the run for the rest of their lives. What kind of role model is Tyra supposed to be doing that?|`|PRDZmeiEaa	She will most likely get caught up before she leaves.... Why is everyone bad mouthing Karen for? She just wants to be a mom is all and yes she might have gone over board a little but who do you think is worse her or Tyra? I mean Tyra just threw her self at Neil like a little slut monkey knowing that he is MARRIED, Hello how come nobody mentioned that??????|`|2f8d927b404e673e434c880af431f65caa	She `ll probably try to take her back to Seattle, but I doubt she`ll make it out of GC. Neil will be the one to find her, and convince her to move back in with he and Karen so he can keep an eye on her. I don`t think that would bother him much. He and Nick have the same diease........... " In love with two women"!|`|fcPiQDwEaa	I don't know where, but l can see this blowing up in Karen's face. I wonder how Devon will take this.

TT0rCi8kaa	What an outrageous slur on our Prime Minister!  The current levels of Unemployment have been carefully manipulated, over a much longer period of time, than 24 hours!  This hard working, and diligent Cyclops has been working long and hard to obtain such a commendable figure of almost Thatcherian magnitude, and should be credited with much more, than just a hard days work! What a cheap shot, at such an outstanding example of mismanagement, and ineptitude this question is. Shame on you!      ***stifled laughter***|`|jf0UV1Bjaa	A man went on a vacation to Ireland  and in his visit he went to a museum and was looking at paintings.  One of the paintings were 3 black men sitting on a bench naked eating lunch.  But the man in the middle had a white penis.  The guide of the museum was telling the group that this painting was about the white influence on africans who were brought all over the different parts of the world to work, and their oppression.  The group moved from the painting but the man stayed back still staring at the painting, he was confused and felt something was off.  An old white man approached him and asked if he liked the painting.  The guy said yes.  The old man said well i painted it, and it was a self portrait of me and two of my friends when we were young and we were coal miners.  The man said well how do you explain your privates being like that.  And the old man replied, well i went home for lunch that day...|`|aGl2p8dEaa	hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha       <br>  looooooooooooooooooooooooooool<br>  ;) ;) ;) ;)|`|fcd41ae13b5b45292cfeda0b4cdff32baa	no, funny but green....|`|5yN05Habaa	I am confused...|`|GIgbnx53aa	lol|`|mMmNEljxaa	Good one Patsykins darhhling!|`|vtUeGp1Caa	What is ********?|`|4fded85bb017fba5407e3727176079ffaa	That's not far from the bloody truth! lol|`|t2stqpnjaa	Okay, I don't get it.

NQ37mnWkaa	Well Bronwen, perhaps the person to start with is Stevie Nicks. <br>  <br>  Back in the mid 1970's, she was described as having a 'below the belt' quality to her voice, due to its rich, deeper tones {unfortunately, in recent years she has lost some of that}. <br>  <br>  So, maybe some classic Buckingham Nicks, or Fleetwood Mac, such as :~<br>  Long Distance Winner<br>  Rhiannon<br>  Landslide<br>  Dreams<br>  I Don't Want To Know<br>  Angel<br>  Storms<br>  Gypsy|`|bmP4NdKuaa	I Love Rock & Roll - Joan Jett|`|AA12114850	I can't help you with any contraltos, but I applaud you for your courage and musical talent.

Otherwise, I write lol when something is stupid and I want to laugh at the person for being stupid, or when something is funny but I'm not in a position to laugh out loud (at work, for example).|`|gG9KjYRfaa	Mostly I say "haha".

656079ce94cfd53c731f9d38d09cd09baa	Your answer came in Episode II.  That scene was specifically written to show how powerful Force masters are too evenly matched to win in a Force-power to Force-power duel.  Dooku comes right out and says that the only way they can stop the stalemate is to duel with lightsabers.<br>  <br>  Remember when Windu had Palpatine unarmed and at his mercy in Episode III, Palpatine tried using the Sith lightening and Mace could deflect it with his saber.  It wasn't until Skywalker used the saber to cut off Mace's forearm that Mace was sufficiently disarmed and unbalanced enough to be susceptible to the Force Lightning.<br>  <br>  I scanned one other answer and the person was saying something about using a gun.  Obviously guns do work against Jedi if the circumstances are right.  That's how Order 66 was largely carried out.  Notice how every time Clone Troopers tried shooting a Jedi, he or she was able to deflect some with their lightsaber, even the youngling Bail witnesses being murdered.  But typically a Jedi or Sith with a lightsaber is extremely difficult to beat with a gun.  It took enough numbers to overwhelm. <br>  <br>  Of course, Kenobi made it clear way back in 1977 with Episode IV that the Jedi consider blasters to be uncivilized.  It's an example of standards that Jedi themselves won't use blasters.  Apparently, the Sith won't as well since the true Sith Lords never carry or use a blaster.  (Maul, Sidious, Tyranus, Vader)|`|OW1pCxU1aa	When you have 2 jedi/sith fighting against each other, I think the fact that they each have "the force" can be offsetting, making it less effective.  We saw Yoda and Dooku first try to battle each other with the force only to realize neither of them had any real advantage - they then turned to light sabers.<br>  <br>  The real mystery is how come Luke never used the force to make an Ewok fly up and smash up against a tree.  Those little buggers were annoying.  You know it had to cross his mind.  I mean, come on...are we really going to miss a few Ewoks?|`|76140b1733cd124dbe960a504bc06f8daa	You know, the Star Wars movies are sci-fi fantasy, and follow no logic at all. Hey, if Mace Windu came at with a light saber, I'd pull out a revolver & shot the guy.  What's this "thing" with light sabers?<br>  <br>  Well, it does look grand on the screen. But ANY gun or rifle would be better. Heck - you shoot 'em from 40 feet away. THAT's how you fight some crazy dude coming after you with a light saber.|`|lWk05DxUaa	How about find a better taste in movies.<br>  <br>  But Idk, maybe because the force is invisible.|`|hmOfUKRcaa	Using the force probably takes time to be effective.<br>  <br>  Anyone who says "Why don't people just shoot the jedi?", they CLEARLY haven't seen the movies.

2b6bec3d7f2fe8f5707c7d178253ef15aa	I have came across more people looking for these lately than ever before. I came to own one in either 98 or 99. It came with a lot of arcade machines I won. Ummm There were no markings in the or on the cabinet. It could seat one larger child or two smaller children. Placing a coin in it would activate a contact that turned on a (get this) film projector. It was a continuous loop projector. (One film that feed across pulleys allowing the play of around 15 minutes worth of film.) The quarter would allow the film to play between 1 to 5 min adjustable with a timer in the cabinet. I think that I found it was made around 1973. I sold it with in a week, Its not what I was into messing with.<br>  <br>  My thoughts on it:<br>   They were cool and can see why people are looking for them. How ever they were not built to last, they were large and heavy. I think many were just destroyed. I think I may build a few myself and use DVD and Flat screens tho, and incorporate a Mini game in them.<br>  <br>  Finding one will take persistence, place wanted adds in the local Classified ads, and on creigslist..
ZyGyDLsDaa	The Chosen (1981)<br>  IMDb review:<br>  "The Chosen" is an excellent film. It opens up in an inner-city playground softball field, where Reuven (Barry Miller) gets hit in the eye by a baseball hit by Danny (Robby Benson), an Hasidic Jew. The two soon become friends and teach each other about their different worlds. It's a very realistic film, not at all overdone as some films of this genre are. Rod Steiger as Danny's ultra-Orthodox rabbi father and Maximilian Schell as Reuven's liberal father along with Miller and Benson are excellent.<br>  <br>  The Devil's Arithmetic (1999 TV movie)<br>  IMDb synopsis:<br>  When Hannah Stern, a 13-year-old girl neglectful of her Jewish heritage and "tired of remembering", goes to open the door to the prophet Elijah during Seder, she finds herself in 1940s Poland. After being sent to a Nazi concentration camp, she must use her knowledge of the future to survive the past and learn something about the importance of remembering.<br>  <br>  The Diary of Anne Frank (1959) <br>  IMDb synopsis:<br>  Harrowing story of a young Jewish girl who, with her family and their friends is forced into hiding in an attic in Nazi-occupied Amsterdam. <br>  <br>  Playing for Time (1980 TV movie)<br>  IMDb synopsis:<br>  Female prisoners in the Nazi concentration camp of Auschwitz are spared from death in return for performing music for their captors.<br>  <br>  Skokie (1981 TV movie)<br>  IMDb synopsis:<br>  Neo-Nazi activists plan to march through the predominantly Jewish community of Skokie, Illinois. Town officials tell the citizens to ignore them because there's nothing that they can do. But, one citizen who is a death camp survivor says that he was told this nearly 40 years ago in Germany and before he knew it he was in a concentration camp. He says this time if they march, he will not ignore them; he will take action. So, the mayor does what he can to stop them. The neo-Nazi leader goes to the ACLU, and the Jewish lawyer he speaks to states that this is a violation of the First Ammendment. They take the case to court. This is based on actual events in the late Seventies.|`|f2c03d5c2b6c415dede17268613279ecaa	There are a number of aftermath of the holocaust movies such as Sophie's Choice or The Pawnbroker.

837xgMwLaa	That's a hard one, cus they mess up so many re-makes, it would have to be a film that wasn't that good to begin with, or you risk ruining a classic... Hmmm, I think... Street Fighter.

Four 1 1/2 boys = 6 boys. In 1 1/2 minutes each of the four 1 1/2 boys eats 1 1/2 hot dogs. Four 1 1/2 hot dogs = 6 hot dogs. <br>  <br>  <br>  Have a good day!<br>  <br>  Regards<br>  Amal|`|xGbgOrZVaa	um six minutes ? is it a riddle or a maths question?|`|NXA4fJbTaa	a minute and a half coz theyre all eating at the same time :)|`|ZeYYHByTaa	same amount of time. <br>  <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AojO0QOqwOfAZl4JBEggZsgazKIX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220052903AA8InSA">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|wRjRMT3Yaa	How long is eat six and a half?

f02fdd44028e78a86a13cf15a8da31e7aa	Just learn to let others make their own mistakes. That means you need to learn to keep your mouth shut once in a while. lol.<br>  I'm the same way myself and when I realized I was ALWAYS correcting people (and they weren't happy about it) I started to keep quiet and now things are better between my friends and I. <br>  That's not to say I don't ever say anything, I just pick and choose when I should speak up. If it's really important then I will. If it's just silly nonsense then I keep quiet. <br>  Good luck.|`|zvAfMgf3aa	emmmm, yea I get that sometimes when being TOOOOOOOOOO smarty.|`|6Nmly1wmaa	No my hubby does tho...I try to tell him no one likes a know it all but, it never works|`|7nRom97Daa	nope, I learned from a young age to keep my big mouth shut|`|XJ0Nux6Naa	Hell Yeah, from my parents when i prove them wrong.

I don't think he is the better rapper, but that is the better song between these 2.|`|VtHZjeVkaa	Don't get me wrong Canibus is pretty good but to compare him to Eminem is a little weird. Eminem's old school bitterphobia was a lot better than a song that uses all of these big words and make people say "he must be good because he uses so many big words". Come on? He just puts them in his song to make himself sound good even though he is just putting a bunch of adjatives together. Biterphobia was crazy.<br>  <br>  so Biterphobia<br>  <br>  by the way what ever happened to canibus|`|1lvyUwo7aa	canibus has better lyrics, but eminem has a much better flow.<br>  <br>  Eminem wins|`|FwhwN5tnaa	Even though I don't like Canibus, you can't deny that that track is good.<br>  <br>  But I really like Eminem's - and thanks for putting the link, haven't heard that in ages!

L7PfCtBpaa	You should probably work on the rudiments. They can get boring but they're used a lot in drumming. You could also learn different, more complicated beats (than the ones you're doing now). After you can't find more to learn (or just because you're bored) you can make up your own. <br>  <br>  If you want, you can go to this site: <a href="http://www.freedrumlessons.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.freedrumlessons.com/</a><br>  It has video drum lessons.

NWcBNAgdaa	One of the hassles with recording bit by bit is getting the timing correct. The other hassle is the 'feel' of the song. This includes the background ambient sound.

AA12155452	Zavvi closed their doors this weekend and I guess one of the reasons was cheap/free/illegal downloads.  Sure, we have all done it in some way or other but society doesn't exist on giving stuff away, desirable though it may seem. How many other music providers will go to the wall? The problem is that more and more people are using digital  media and that is encouraging people to seek free downloads.  So to answer your question, no people, as individuals, should not be fined but the some action needs to be taken against people that create the download facilities.|`|4Vw9An50aa	I think they should put the price of music down. Then more people would be willing to pay for music rather than downloading it for free. Some people just download it for free because maybe they can't afford to pay for music. And plus how are they going to fine everyone that downloads free music. So many people do.|`|7IjGzvqTaa	Well, according to the music industry, yes.  It's illegal and people are supposed to pay for their music.<br>  <br>  According to the people who download, goodness no.  With the technology available to us, it's impossible to stop all activity surrounding illegal downloads.<br>  <br>  YOU'LL NEVER TAKE US ALIVE, MUAHAHAHA!<br>  <br>  ...But in all seriousness, people would find a way, no matter what.|`|tNk6j437aa	This is a debate that will run and run this is done on such an enormous scale that the "crime" is virtually out of control|`|ko9Zy9k7aa	No.|`|fB9gNs02aa	no!|`|2LlEIkrQaa	Only the caught get punished. But ask yourself, "Hey so I downloaded a couple songs online for free, should I pay hundreds of dollars for it?" If you think someone is gonna report you though, you better the delete the fudge out of it. But in all seriousness, you really shouldn't do it in the first place.|`|FWVUbGJAaa	Yes. Why should some people buy music legally whilst others don't. It wouldn't really be fining them, but just making them pay for what they should have|`|yUkphPkiaa	No it would be too dificult to enforce

5HcbZMwAaa	Although contracts can vary depending on the record company the general way the major labels work is that a commission and number of albums are agreed with the artist. So for example a band may sign a 3 album deal, receiving 10% from each album sale.<br>  <br>  The record label typically covers the cost of manufacturing, recording, post-production, advertising etc.<br>  <br>  Bigger artists sometimes set up their own record labels so they keep 100% of their profits. This would mean they are responsible for their own costs such as recording studio fees and advertising.<br>  <br>  A lot of smaller artists and bands usually make peanuts from album sales and actually receive the majority of their income from touring and merchandise sales.|`|VEgv5NhSaa	Well the music industry earns alot of money anyway because if its in a studio, and the album reaches to the number one charts, then that record company will get thousands of pounds and will be able to make more albums and more and more.<br>  <br>  :):)

That had kept my pet comfort in couch without him to learn that i am left and hve took rest as i desired|`|SLNd60cCaa	put a cushion on your a lap and when the cat goes to sleep and you want to move it then pick up that cushion and put it on the floor or the sofa, or whatever.|`|jinyM8fyaa	Slowly slide your hands underneath it and then slowly lift it and put it in the dryer, lol. just kidding.

BOEjPLqBaa	A quick version....He actually is about to escape from the place when he hears someone screaming.  Turns out same dude that was talking to him is burning some chicks eye out.  He kills dude escapes with the girl to the train station.  The girl sees her reflection in a mirror and sees how her left eye is hanging out and looks disgusting.  She is so freaked out that she jumps in front of an incoming train causing a distractions so that the main character is able to get on a train and escape.  While on the train he notices the same Russian guy that tricked them into going to the Slovakia hotel.  Train makes a pit stop.  Dude follows the Russian into the bathroom, kills him jumps back on the train....end of story

Whatever happened to Randy Edelman, ha!|`|T0pkW783aa	Well, children can make you laugh by something they do but you are not actually "laughing at them", but laughing at something that charms you about what they have done.  Besides that, I don't think it would be laughing at them because they are small, but because they are cute and it would not be laughing at (as in ridiculing but, because you find them so adorable!)  Some children are very sensitive and don't like it when someone laughs at them so you have to explain to them that you are not making fun of them, but enjoying what they have done to make you happy.|`|968KfJjqaa	Yes, I think so.|`|L1DUcTtSaa	No, what are like some sad old git?|`|AA11066099	WTF!

hTruYNUQaa	The economy in Australia is pretty good at the moment..|`|DaLNnxUfaa	I think that the best way to fix the economy here in the US is to raise tariffs on anything imported, so that we have reason to buy our own goods, rather than imported goods.  I also think that globally, companies that make goods for export to the USA, including American owned companies on other soils, should be required to pay workers at least the US minimum wage.  Workers in other countries of factories owned by US companies should be allowed to join unions of US workers to demand a decent wage for what they do.|`|8j70Neqeaa	give every person who needs it, a million bucks.

V2EUoVGvaa	I myself loved reading the books. Yet the movie was awful. The only reason, in my opinion why the film has gotten so much attention from the public eye is because it is loved by teeny boppers. The Cullen family seem to be drowning in girls thinking they are so cute. Mainly Edward. I mean when I went to the cinema hoping for a decent movie I was in a packed theatre. This is a good thing. but it seems that I was one of the only boys in there and every person in there was aged between, I'd say 10 and 17 years old. I know that all the girls are obsessed by Edward Cullen and his siblings because I answered another question to do with Twilight and half the people had names like. "Mrs Cullen", " I <3 Edward", "Jasper Lover" and lots more. There responses wouldn't shut the **** up about how cute an actor was.<br>  <br>  I apologise if I have drifted off the point. Now the film, I think was pretty much only appealing to a certain audience. Unlike the Harry Potter movie seqal it is really a teen love movie, not an oscar material piece of work. The oscars mean that the movie has succeeded in being popular, well done, well acted and its got a decent story line and appeals to more than one audience. Nobody argue that Twilight is a film for boys because its not. Therefore I would say that Twilight is mainly watched by teeny boppers from ages 10 - 17....not a huge audience.|`|Q0wS8fUpaa	the story base is amazing! the books are amazing! the movie is STUPID! the acting is terrible, the graphics are obvious, and quality is crap. If there were oscar awards for books, yes Twilight Series would be nominated. But apart from the good looking vamps and sexi werewolves, TWilight the movie is nothing. It's a movie that even i could make and im 12. Its rated 2 stars.|`|odFpBQkkaa	cus it is not a great film. and nothing was special. effects were cheesy and everything was not a really great stuff. it is just a teen girl flick. not oscarish.<br>  <br>  and what category? i thought the original or sound effects were gonna get nominated (who cares. the film sucks and there are no movie buffs who like twilight)<br>  <br>  and twilight is a bad film.|`|lvu7VIDJaa	there are a lot of popular movies that aren't nominated for oscars. twilight was popular,not because it was a good movie, but coz it's full of romance and it has a cute actor in it. the direction is TERRIBLE, and i thought it was really boring...|`|Tl9ErwUGaa	ummm did you actually go see it???<br>  <br>  apparantley not<br>  <br>  or maybe you were just so infatuated with edward (or in my case emmett) that you didnt see its many flaws<br>  <br>  im a fan of the BOOK<br>  but seriously teh movie was disgraceful<br>  <br>  it was so unproffesional|`|PxAfu96faa	i think its because its mostly directed at teenagers so hen they decide the Oscars adults wouldn't choose it.. i liked the film, probably because i liked the book, (which is so much more better than the film)|`|856Ngy02aa	I love twilight i have read all the books! maybe you should look on the oscar website <br>  <a href="http://www.oscar.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.oscar.com/</a><br>  Hope this helps<br>  x|`|OJhDxJdcaa	i KNOW!!! thats so stupid.<br>  twilight was awsum and all the teens watched and loved it.<br>  it should have totally been nominated and WON an award!!!|`|9bG4PRRUaa	its overrated and it sucks<br>  jeeze<br>  edward is the new gerard way or pete wentz|`|GO1VXNtdaa	it was good...for targeting teens!! so like if no teens voted for it then it didn't nom.|`|c3b11df445c85a57854c19a1ff159cddaa	Because it's shite beyond belief|`|iJbslaQNaa	slow movie! not much fun!|`|uurgL3oZaa	Because the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences isn't made up of 12 year old girls.|`|g22GoipQaa	It just wasn't a good idea of a film... the books werre controversial already in that nobody "didn't mind" Twilight... everyone loved them, hated them, or had no idea what they were..<br>  <br>  I hate the whole Twilight thing. Although, to be fair, I've never read the books, but from the plotline which I've had explained to me.... WHAT!? I personally do not get the appeal... I think many people would agree with this, hence no oscar nomination.|`|f2c03d5c2b6c415dede17268613279ecaa	Probably because it is not good enough.  Even if the criteria was box office takings or popularity, it would not be one of the top 4 of the last year.  It might be different if the nomination panel was made up of early teen girls.|`|capSLZQXaa	Anybody ever tell you that you should be a comedienne?<br>  <br>  Hilarious!!!!|`|Z6tqdAoGaa	It hasn't been nominated because only little children like it....I took my niece and fell asleep it was so bad.|`|apcRdPhIaa	How do I break this to you....  it sucks!|`|KvVTmlLWaa	OK, So all the people that are just criticising it, please, it wasn't THAT bad. I actually found it extremely good, and it's not because I'm in love with Edward Cullen, because, like you, I do not find him attractive in the slightest. However, I found the film a very, VERY well put together film, and it's been amazingly adapted from the book into a film. I don't know why it isn't nominated for an Oscar?. I mean, the special affects were very, very good, and the chemistry between Edward and Bella was outstanding. I could easily go and watch that 100 times over, and I wouldn't tire of it. Also, the popularity of it is just... huge. Every girl I've met has heard or usually even seen Twilight for themselves. It definitely deserves at the least, a nomination, possibly a win.|`|AA11485682	The Oscars don't go to the most popular movies, but the ones that are chosen by actors, directors and other Hollywood people as the best. Plenty of popular movies that lots of people loved didn't get nominated. Things like Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Batman, or other films that were popular and earned lots of money didn't get nominations.|`|tITPAbeKaa	You're kidding right?<br>  <br>  Why in the world would it ever be nominated for an Oscar? There's nothing in the least exceptional or great about it. Bad story line, mediocre acting. It's just a tween flick.<br>  <br>  Yes it's popular, but then so was High School Musical or American Pie or all those Jim Carey movies. Oscars are about good films, not about popular ones.|`|raBbxqWbaa	I think Twilight was really big because of the book. I watched the movie and honestly, I prefer the book.<br>  <br>  There probably were bigger or better movies than Twilight. Maybe that's why it didn't get nominated. <br>  <br>  Fingers crossed for New Moon!|`|n7rfbfGmaa	The only thing thats made it popular is young girls. To be honest, there is nothing really that great about it at all. I wouldn't expect it to be nominated for an oscar, because its really average.|`|e0338b9bb1dd97eb01a44cc65f8d7e7aaa	sorry to have to break this to you<br>  <br>  it was not that a special film<br>  <br>  it was a ok watch not crap in anyway<br>  just in no way oscar material|`|8P0PqRQHaa	Young girls, teenagers, I loved it and I am 32.  Not really oscar material tho.|`|AVYBazOEaa	I have no idea;- I think it should be.<br>  I disagree;- I think Rob is Extremely good looking.

akcGfgdcaa	I think most of the other posters are thinking that she's topless and just wearing underwear down below. When clearly you mean she is wearing bra and panties, in which case, NO it is not child porn, it would fall closer to the bracket of child modelling than it would child porn. It would however be deemed by the majority of people as a somewhat explicit image, and if for example, you are in your 20s or 30s, it would look extremely bad for you to be looking at it, even though technically it's not breaking any laws. <br>  <br>  But no, it's not child porn unless she is showing any private parts or is topless.|`|9qUnD0sBaa	It doesn't sound like porn to me, there are advertisements every day who show young people in bathing suits or even underwear or skimpy clothes that are more provocative than a girl in her underwear doing nothing.<br>  The laws can be odd though and lesser photos have landed people in jail or in the courts.In our zest and rightly so we have become paranoid to the point of ridiculous.  The definition of porn is becoming more and more blurred, because so much is in the eye of the beholder. So much is intent rather than content.<br>  Our number one goal is to protect children from despicable predators and not instill any  thoughts of sex with with any child it is an abomination.  We should though not throw the baby out  with bathwater, we need to have some common sense.<br>  The girl took the photo herself and posted it herself, she needs her parents to explain to her that this is dangerous activity  and she should remove it.|`|UjPArJZ6aa	So she's wearing a tee shirt and knickers, yeah? That would be like saying, if she were in a bikini, it's child porn. I fail to see how it is to be honest.<br>  <br>  What's wrong with all you people? How is that considered porn? <br>  <br>  This world is truly fecked up, no doubt about it.|`|dCMi5rjdaa	yes<br>  <br>  there was story last week about a bunch of school kids sending explicit pics of themselves to other kids over their cell phones...big big trouble....<br>  <br>  pornography is pornography<br>  <br>  under 19 is child pornography|`|kyuEmeNAaa	yes unless you are in Mexico|`|gIitANOkaa	Yeah...|`|nGpBuI9Oaa	yes|`|QdJNKB3jaa	The picture itself is not child porn if it is not done for sexual reasons, <br>  take a look in a cataloge, its full of adverts not porn pictures. <br>  <br>  Like beauty is in the eye of the beholder, <br>  porn becomes what ever floats your boat. <br>  <br>  Like one person can be turned on by just the sight of long leather boots, without a person being in them (a boot fetish) <br>  the boots themselves are not sexual its the kink of the looker that makes them sexual. <br>  <br>  Different people put different spins on things, to suit themselves, <br>  in some countries in the world, a 15 year old (and younger) could be married already. <br>  <br>  Different people different ways, <br>  personally I believe although the picture was not taken as pornography and is not pornography, there are people that will twist it to become pornography. <br>  The girl in question should be made aware of the dangers of taking such photos, in effect she is doing no wrong, innocence and morality rightly says there is nothing wrong with the human body or expressing yourself, <br>  it is the sicko's of the world that see something more in such photos.<br>  I would be seriously disappointed if any of my daughters posted such a pic. <br>  (on reflection if she was on a beach with a bikini on then it would not be porn or wrong, but if someone then kept the photo having no real link to the girl in question, then it could only really be for the wrong reasons) <br>  Interesting question, causes thought and awareness, <br>  that I am in favor of. Thank you.|`|MoUtk7cUaa	on the one hand, if you look at the sears catalog, you can see the same thing and then call it porn as well.  on the other hand, once people start to disseminate it, for the illicit pleasure of some perves, you have yourself the idea of child porn, but still no actual porn as defined by most statutes.|`|PEz2YMeXaa	Yep<br>  <br>  It's child porn, unless the picture was sent to her bf or something|`|cce7d68825e6be23ab1dbad4e0df262faa	Your friend is weird careful he doesn't hang around your children!|`|Gr70BLaOaa	Email it on to me and ill decide!!|`|k56mmj2eaa	I would say yes it is.|`|nlKZRNqmaa	yes....|`|DQlZNeXzaa	I guess it is really child porn. I had to think hard though, to say that...She took the picture, its of her and its posted by her...that's her choice and she probably doesn't consider it porn either...On the surface I'd say no its not...<br>  But its in a public place for the whole world to see and guaranteed some bloke with a hard on is going to see that and find it a turn on and that's when it becomes porn...|`|caVLeRKXaa	first of all she is 15 that is not a child and if shes wearing a shirt this aint no porn at all even if she wer wearing just undies & bra its still not porn and bye the way how many girls in the world wear bikinies when they go swimming about 90% do i think the10% is old grannys if you see what i mean also 15 year olds advertise underwear in catolouges|`|Ynquf69saa	if she sent it to her boyfriend no.<br>  if she took it and uploaded it or sent it herself that is her exposing herself only thing really could be Indecent exposure. and that's her fault but i guess it also depends how old the other person is. if she didn't take it and it was uploaded with out her knowing then there would be problems|`|MmFIQ6qYaa	No I would say no, besides I know she isn't topless or anything so I would say no, and besides even if she was all it is is the human body so I wouldn't care if a 12 year old posted nude pics up, if it was their choice and they wanted to show themselves off they thats fine,,and by the way I am an 18 year old woman.|`|bWcW1fsoaa	Absolutely, yes that should not be allowed to happen the person that posted the picture should be charged with child porn, i also feel if you know about it and don't protect the minor you are just as much at fault as the person who did it|`|DEGClROKaa	I'd say it is. She is underage topless and in her underwear. I think its illegal in most countries.|`|Ri0y2kVqaa	Depends where its at, ALOT of girls who are younger put pictures like this on social networking sites like bebo.|`|QXcbS8C1aa	i see girls all over myspace doing that, and pics haven't been removed so i would say no. but i still think its kinda gross.|`|7ozcEEg5aa	Blud your mates dodgy stay away from him..|`|xGNM8J6yaa	Depends on how old you are.|`|cxKR99KIaa	Ahhhhhhhhh yes it would|`|LDa3Xda4aa	I would have to say yes.|`|Y16olPxlaa	Yeup.|`|YcWGDKvkaa	is that Miley Cyrus?|`|U3KAgO0baa	yes|`|4yFDVPhQaa	yup.|`|tpfxZZADaa	In Australia you can be convicted for receiving, photographing or sending pictures of semi-naked or naked minors (people under 18).

Later it was deemed to be Art with a PG rating by the Office of Film and Literature Classification. <br>  <br>  But the thing is that your friends etc. do not have the political clout Henson did.

eeKlogL4aa	No. I don't understand why some people think that posing semi-naked and taking blatantly racist photo's is a good influence on young girls.|`|6lkNOFNlaa	Yes I do. And I know I will get thumbs down for this but what the hell.<br>  <br>  She's a child herself and is in such a difficult situation. How can so many people hate her when she is only 16? Surely its the parents that are in the wrong for allowing her to be the way she is?<br>  <br>  That may be one argument but personally, I think she's just like every other teen and her pictures are not bad at all. All 16 year old girls take silly pictures like that. <br>  <br>  People think Miley's a slut because she is with Disney but give her a break - she's trying to break through from that.<br>  <br>  She works harder than anyone on here ever will. She was pushed into the spotlight by her parents (what famous person isn't?) and therefore has had no time to ever really be a child. She sees herself as more grown up than she is because that's what the people around her think.<br>  <br>  I think she's a good role model because no matter what, she picks herself up and always tries her best. She has personality, which is something a lot of famous people don't have. She shows people that there is no perfect and that you can only learn from mistakes.<br>  <br>  People forget that she is just a kid and it's a shame that so many do because that is the culture we live in today and it's gone severely downhill.|`|71mzNtu6aa	Yes! And not just on young girls, but on ME, and on A LOT of amazing teens all over the world! She inspires people to believe in your dreams, and create situations that you are ok with. Her songs are inspirational, and her words amaze people everywhere!<br>  AMAZING MILEY CYRUS, KEEP ROCKING OUR WORLD!<br>  <br>  <3|`|bzpY4I8Paa	yes if you want your daughter to grow up to be a completely untalented slut, with little future in anything other being a complete dbag. yet be filthy rich and be considered by many young girls the greatest thing since sliced bread. and off course you'll be allowed to live with her. so i say yes good influence.|`|D3Ru7ghsaa	no, but her music is changing too i mean she is trying to make her music more mature.<br>  and then there is the pictures, which im sure every teenager (or most) have done something like that too but just because she is famous she has to be careful.|`|tMPqa9rYaa	When was she ever a good influence on young girls?|`|Tjr9aObNaa	No she is a whore.|`|8d8d17d3cd10277a2c3970b21b05b5b4aa	I've never thought that she's a good influence on kids at all... I mean she seems like one of those people who would have a panic attack if she didn't have her make up on... I don't know about you but that's the kind of impression I get... plus the photos... about the photo of her making a racist gesture... a couple of years ago that wasn't considered racist so maybe she didn't know that it was considered racist. Pay-pay13, she's dating a 20 year old, not a 25 year old... <br>  <br>  I wouldn't want my 16 year old daughter to be doing any of the above. <br>  How would they learn responsibilities and concentrate on their education if they think about make up and boyfriends 24/7? Need I say more? <br>  <br>  :)|`|SKt1y1gzaa	common on seriously? <br>  You guys give a freaking break....I am 16. she is 16. I am not a big fan or anything but i mean shes just a normal teenager growing up in the spot light. Me and my friends take pics when were in like our underwear were just having fun that's all. Shes trying to do the same thing but everyone just thinks "omg what a slut" or "her dad should control his daughter" Yes maybe some of the things she has done were kind of bad but, shes a teen shes human she makes mistakes but if someone that's not famous does it its like oh well whatever. I think you guys just need to leave her allown shes trying to grow up she cant be hannah montana forever, shes trying to come into herself figure out who she is... i understand where shes coming from, and how much pressure she must have. If you would take the time to understand and not just judge.|`|oHSsJ4Koaa	she was when she was younger but when she started to grow up she started blending in with the wrong crowd and there was one point where she wasnt going to do hannah montana animore|`|26znDQcKaa	Nooo.|`|FwhwN5tnaa	Hell no!<br>  <br>  Who wants there 6-year-old kid to look up to a 16-year-old drunken racist!?|`|nYioXmnGaa	I do not think so I can tell you one thing i am not letting my kids watch her !!!!|`|QWEJc4SZaa	yes and no<br>  yes because she works a a lot<br>  no because of those pics..|`|EMPpDFv7aa	nooooo not at all|`|ZxipP7Bzaa	I think that her singing as hannah montana is a good influence.

Q2yXaQooaa	I believe the reason is that we are searching for alternative to the comics we are familiar with. Also because unlike most western comics and cartoon, animes/mangas are made for a much wider audience, including kids, teenagers, young adults and adults. On the other hand most comics and shows on tv are about superheros or stuff for a younger audience. And like you said, there are so many of them nowadays so it's like movies, you cannot dislikes movies altogether :)|`|P8gGMlbIaa	Kradden's response was a pretty good one, and hateface had as a point as well. While it's true that not every American comic is a superhero comic the vast majority of mainstream comics are. The American comic industry is now a mere shadow of it's former self, and in comparison with the Japanese manga industry doesn't equal up. This comes from back in the 60's when do-gooders and PTA groups thought comics should be a children's only media for entertainment and gutted the American comic industry. The Japanese never had this problem as they understood there are manga for children and manga for adults.<br>  <br>  My personal preference towards manga and anime over American comics, is for the fact that there is no American equivalent to something like Gundam. Or Urusei Yatsura for that matter, and I don't think I would even have read a story like Love Hina if not for it's manga.<br>  <br>  The American comics I do read are.<br>  Ninja High School<br>  Gold Digger<br>  G.I. Joe|`|s5885jNDaa	Because anime is hot lol|`|sOiVT35naa	Mangas are just black and white comics and anime is just a cartoon. I love both styles and watch both styles (by that I mean comics and manga). It's like asking why you are so obsessed with comics and cartoon.(I happen to be obsessed with both so I don't really count) I know ssome comics that are better than some manga and I know some manga that are better than some comics, the same goes for anime and cartoons (same thing different name imo). It's all based on your preference. People need to stop being so picky and picking one over the other or saying one sucks.|`|Xfw1fvnbaa	besides manga is like a real book series you have lot's of genres and you can actually learn some thing from the story\plot at least some of them, and when you live in norway like i do regular comics get kind of boring after you have reached the age of 13 so manga was like a whole new world to me ^_~|`|r7GMWkPraa	i know...it's all starting to look the same. it's getting really boring.<br>  & if you want good "western" comics for adults check out sandman, black hole, or even johnny the homicidal maniac. not all comic books are about superheroes.|`|iZbCGUKIaa	well..as an avid manga reader and an artist,i read manga not only for the sake of the uniqueness or coolness of the drawing style,i also look onto the story of it:)

7IjGzvqTaa	It's not creepy; it's muscle memory.  You remember things much faster from doing them rather than seeing or hearing them.  After you learned the first half of the song, your brain started picking up the note pattern and the second half came much faster.<br>  <br>  Honestly, it doesn't sound like you're worrying so much as you're gloating.|`|OFQoL7H9aa	Some people have natural abilities to do stuff I bet that's yours..Mine is ice skating you can nail an element in one lesson, but that's just mee.

Keep working on it. <br>  and btw im 12 if thats shows anything idk..<br>  hope i've helped|`|vYn5ZzTwaa	I'm like that too, my music teacher let me have a go on the oboe the other day, and I could play it straight away, she gives me a piece of music on flute, guitar, vocals or alto saxaphone and I can just play it, It creeps me out too how fast I learn.  I'm 17 in Grade 12 and I first started learning guitar in Grade 8 when I was 13 and I started learning flute when I was 15, I love music and I can play anything and everything, 'cept for trumpet, and trombone and uranium (uphonium), them things are hard, I also play keyboard. It's good that you can learn really quick, its a gift so enjoy it.|`|dsqm0x9Waa	you put your mind to it. if you were thinking i hate keboard over and over again then you would still have a very hard time learning that same song. but if you were to say i love keboard over and over again in your head then you would be where you are now. it's naturally normal for you to feel this way. i play the guitar and i wish i had your talent. it takes me a whole week to learn a song. hope i helped!|`|TktFxwbhaa	<a href="http://getinfo.biz.tm" rel="nofollow">http://getinfo.biz.tm</a> <br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website|`|hHZpiFmqaa	Maybe your musically gifted or maybe the song was just to easy for you?

AA10283947	Who?|`|HUhheZWtaa	Gavin and stacey Hiscrush onb alexandra burke (x factor winner)<br>  And his interveiw on x factor and wasnt he a comedian?|`|ko9Zy9k7aa	He has played a few little parts in some tv programs, I can't remember any of them to name.<br>  But what made him really noticeably famous was Gavin and Stacey. He created it with Ruth Jones, and his character Smithy is a strong funny whitty character and a lot of people know him from that. He also hosted Big Brother's Big Mouth with Matthew Horne who appears as Gavin in Gavin and Stacey. And James Corden has also done a lot of other presenting things, like he presented The Brit awards 2009 with Matthew Horne.<br>  But he is most famous for Gavin and Stacey.<br>  <br>  Xx|`|8d8d17d3cd10277a2c3970b21b05b5b4aa	- He's on Gavin and Stacey<br>  - He has a massive crush on Alexandra Burke, X Factor 2009's winner<br>  - He co-hosted the Brit Awards with Kylie Minogue and his co-host Matthew Horne<br>  <br>  Actually these are just a bunch of reasons why he's famous... plus he's just another example of absolutely BRILLIANT British comedians! :D Gotta love him!<br>  <br>  EDIT: to those who don't know him... I don't think he's well known outside Britain... check him out on Youtube... I assure you, if you want to see British comedy, it will be totally worth it! :)|`|Vy06ZUVnaa	not sure how he got his start, but he was excellent in the History Boys and hilarious in Gavin and Stacey...|`|JoTbfOnjaa	I didn't know he was. I've never heard of him|`|bGyVJ6meaa	Lack of any serious competition.<br>  <br>  And he is chubby i.e. has a "personality"<br>  <br>  His latest movie, out on preview at the moment, is an embarassment. <br>  <br>  But in terms of career he was on hollyoaks, and then Gavin and Stacey which is an OK comedy in the UK.|`|d8VsP2Eiaa	Can't be THAT famous. I've never heard of him. I live in the real world, not the infantile world of tv and dreams. Please define the word FAMOUS and CELEBRITY Nearly all of these people are neither FAMOUS or CELEBRITY..

scBYJEGtaa	The things I found disgusting in the movie:<br>  (1) Grenouille's birth in a marketplace;<br>  (2) the prostitute's full frontal,<br>  (3) the orgy, and<br>  (4) the scene preceding the one where Grenouille says, "She's busy." when a woman looks for his employer.<br>  <br>  I'm a little sensitive with those kind of stuff.

I'm not just talking ladies either. I was popular after I smoked. I was cool. It was the one time in my life when I felt accepted.... oh... what? We're still on the air? Oh?

WE ARE NOW EXPERIENCING TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES|`|IvIGJnKzaa	A little girl runs out to the backyard where her father is working, and asks him, "Daddy, what's sex?"<br>  <br>  Her father sits her down, and tells her all about the birds and the bees. He tells her about conception, sexual intercourse, sperms and eggs. He goes on to tell her about puberty, menstruation, erections, wet-dreams...and he thinks, what the hell, and goes on to tell her the works. He covers a wide and varied assortment of sub topics and by the time he's finished, his daughter is somewhat awestruck with this sudden influx of bizarre new knowledge. Her father finally asks: "So what did you want to know about sex for?"<br>  <br>  "Oh, mommy said to tell you lunch would be ready in a couple<br>  of secs..."<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  One morning the husband returns after several hours of fishing and decides to<br>  take a nap. Although not familiar with the lake, the wife decides to take the<br>  boat out. She motors out a short distance, anchors, and reads her book. <br>  <br>  <br>  Along comes a Game Warden in his boat. He pulls up alongside the woman and<br>  says, 'Good morning, Ma'am. What are you doing?' 'Reading a<br>  book,' she replies, (thinking, 'Isn't that obvious?')<br>  <br>  'You're in a Restricted Fishing Area,' he informs her. <br>  'I'm sorry, officer, but I'm not fishing. I'm reading' <br>  <br>  'Yes, but you have all the equipment. For all I know you could start at<br>  any moment. I'll have to take you in and write you up.' <br>  <br>  'For reading a book?' she replies,<br>  <br>  'You're in a Restricted Fishing Area,' he informs her again, <br>  'I'm sorry, officer, but I'm not fishing. I'm reading' <br>  <br>  "But you have all the equipment and for all I know you could start at any<br>  moment. I'll have to take you in and write you up.' <br>  <br>  'If you do that, I'll have to charge you with sexual assault,'<br>  says the woman. <br>  <br>  'But I haven't even touched you,' says the game warden. <br>  <br>  'That's true, but you have all the equipment. For all I know you could<br>  start at any moment.' <br>  <br>  'Have a nice day ma'am,' and he left. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  A group of children were trying very hard to become accustomed to Nursery. <br>  <br>  The biggest hurdle they faced was that the teacher insisted on NO baby talk!<br>  <br>  You need to use 'Big People' words,' she was always reminding them.<br>  <br>  She asked John what he had done over the weekend.<br>  <br>  'I went to visit my Nana'.<br>  <br>  No, you went to visit your GRANDMOTHER.

My name is Wanda.<br>  2nd woman: Hi! I'm Sylvia. How'd you die?<br>  1st woman: I froze to death.<br>  2nd woman: How horrible!<br>  1st woman: It wasn't so bad. After I quit shaking from the cold, I began to get warm & sleepy, and finally died a peaceful death. What about you?<br>  2nd woman: I died of a massive heart attack. I suspected that my husband was cheating, so I came home early to catch him in the act. But instead, I found him all by himself in the den watching TV.<br>  1st woman: So, what happened?<br>  2nd woman: I was so sure there was another woman there somewhere that I started running all over the house looking. I ran up into the attic and searched, and down into the basement. Then I went through every closet and checked under all the beds.<br>  I kept this up until I had looked everywhere, and finally I became so exhausted that I just keeled over with a heart attack and died.<br>  1st woman: Too bad you didn't look in the freezer---we'd both still be alive.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Husband: Oh, come on. <br>  Wife: Leave me alone! <br>  Husband: It won't take long. <br>  Wife: I won't be able to sleep afterwards. <br>  Husband: I can't sleep without it. <br>  Wife: Why do you think of things like this in the middle of the night? <br>  Husband: Because I'm Hot. <br>  Wife: You get hot at the darnedest times. <br>  Husband: If you love me I wouldn't have to beg you. <br>  Wife: If you love me you'd be more considerate. <br>  Husband: You don't love me anymore.<br>  Wife: Yes I do, but let's forget it for tonight. <br>  Husband: Please...come on <br>  Wife: All right, I'll do it. <br>  Husband: What's the matter? Need a flashlight? <br>  Wife: I can't find it. <br>  Husband: Oh, for heaven's sake, feel for it! <br>  Wife: There! Are you satisfied? <br>  Husband: Oh, yes. <br>  Wife: Is it up far enough? <br>  Husband: ! Oh, that's good. <br>  Wife: Now go to sleep, and from now on when you want the window open, <br>  Do it yourself.<br>  <br>  Two bored casino dealers are waiting at the crap table. A very attractive Southern blonde woman arrived and bet twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) on a single roll of the dice. She said, 'I hope you don't mind, but I feel much luckier when I play topless.'<br>  With that, she stripped to the waist; rolled the dice; and yelled, 'Come on, Southern Girl needs new clothes!' <br>  As the dice bounced and came to a stop, she jumped up-and-down and squealed 'YES! YES! I WON! I WON!'<br>  She hugged each of the dealers...and then picked up her winnings, and her clothes, and quickly departed.<br>  The dealers stared at each other dumfounded. Finally, one of them asked, 'What did she roll?'<br>  The other answered, 'I don't know... I thought you were watching.'<br>  Moral of the story:<br>  Not all Southerners are stupid.<br>  Not all blondes are dumb.<br>  But all men... are men.<br>  <br>  There was a camel and elephant, the elephant said to the camel <br>  "How come you have your t*ts on your back?" and the camel got offended so he told the elephant <br>  "Well why do you have your d*ck on your face?"<br>  <br>  A Blonde walks into a bank in New York City and asks for the loan officer. She says She is going to Europe on business for two weeks and needs to borrow $5,000. The bank officer says the bank will need some kind of security for such a loan, so the Blonde hands over the keys to a new Rolls Royce parked in the street in front of the bank. Everything checks out, and the bank agrees to accept the car as collateral for the loan. An employee drives the Rolls into the bank's underground garage and parks it there. <br>  <br>  Two weeks later, the Blonde returns, repays the $5,000 and the interest, which comes to $15.41. <br>  <br>  The loan officer says, "We are very happy to have had your business, and this transaction has worked out very nicely, but we are a little puzzled. While you were away, we checked you out and found that you are a multimillionaire. <br>  <br>  What puzzles us is why would you bother to borrow $5,000?" <br>  <br>  The Blonde replied, "Where else in New York can I park my car for two weeks for 15 bucks?"<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Learn Chinese:<br>  (English Phrase) I think you need a facelift<br>  (Chinese Phrase) Chin Tu Fat  (don’t know.

The film showed what India is like, it was about a slumdog, they showed Indians who didn't live in slums, hence the people who were beating him up. The film had a flawless soundtrack including two great original songs, so both those nominations were deserved. The film was well-made, great editing and well directed by the legendary Danny Boyle. People like you expect to see movies like The Dark Knight, is it wasn't The point was in the slums (where the film takes place, not the entire INDIA!!!) is that, the kids who sing good, they take their eyes out, so people will feel bad and give them money. Jamal learned things his entire life and he was albe to use it to win a million dollars, with Latika, the girl of his dreams, watching. The film is incredible, people expecting to see a one-dimensional American movie wouldn't like this movie. Don't get me wrong, The Dark Knight was good, but was it brilliant? No, people like you wouldn't understand that, Slumdog Millionaire was a true masterpiece, the film deserves all it's nominations and it should sweep the two major categories easily. (Best Picture and Best Director)|`|676fffa1d033bd7fc45c4eae89d1f268aa	no it don't even deserve 1  all that movie is about some guy from india  on a game show wow ..;.  i rate the movie  0 /10|`|mrI8mfFpaa	YOU WOULD SAY BATMAN RIGHT???<br>  ....DARK KNIGHT;)<br>  I MEAN ANY MOVIE GOES....

That defines the true depths of India.<br>  -The accents weren't that bad, and some parts were in english, some were subtitled...it was a nice mix. So what?<br>  -"How can you enjoy a film with flaws?" Well, have a nice life enjoying no films whatsoever. <br>  <br>  <br>  *How on earth is it glorifying poverty? That movie showed how awful poverty, religious tensions, and greed can be. The only thing it glorified was destiny, the possiblity that some people are meant to make it out of bad situations. Did your mother never read you bedtime stories? It's a harmless fantasy, get over it. Btw there was one blind boy in that movie.|`|IIPHf4Ylaa	it was a great movie.. but very overrated as said by others. It, to me was a movie you go see, enjoy and continue your life. After watching some of my favorite movies such as ''City Of God'', ''Apocalyspe Now'' ''Forest Gump'' ''Schindler's list'' etc.. I kept talking about it the whole night through.<br>  <br>  bottom line.. Entertaining movie, but wont be incredibly memorable as other movies Ive seen.|`|6i2saWKxaa	Yes it did, it was an emotional film that showed the true depths of India.|`|tzPEckiZaa	Why would the movie be panned? Just because the director is Indian vs. an African American? How is it that Jewish Steven Spielberg can make movies about WASPS or Catholics with out this scrutiny.<br>  <br>  I think you're being hyper-critical because the portrayal is offensive to you because it only shows the slums of India. You would think that Californians would be offended every time a movie is set in South Central LA then. Parts of the world have bad areas that get highlighted in films, the same with beautiful and lavish parts of the world.<br>  <br>  Get over it. <br>  <br>  And....I too think the movie is a bit overrated. It was a great movie, but I don't see it as "life changing" like some have labeled it.

tT256JQRaa	imdb (which is the most useful and accurate site i know of) probably just means the runtime of the film itself, but your download might include the intro bits (like the tristar horse, or the dreamworks guy in the moon etc), that'd push up the runtime - as long as the runtime isnt different by like 20 minutes i wouldnt worry
NVSvpNLiaa	When you download a movie, sometimes the uploader  will trim off some time (The credits, the beginning, wherever). Credits can last for an average of five minutes, I'd say.<br>  <br>  Employee of the Month doesn't have anything that controversial in it. Whenever a movie with a notorious scene or with an "unacceptable" one gets edited, that's basically the only time when you have movie run times differing.|`|c92f32a1f227b73735476774374184b0aa	The wasteful intro & or the credits have been cut out to make the video easier to watch without it being such a large file. I download whatever has the most seeders (I use bit torrent downloading) first, and then for second I look at the quality (people usually leave reviews or posts where the torrent is downloaded). The size, if only difference in 10 min range or 100/200 MB range, is not an issue for me. Dont worry about it.

akcGfgdcaa	What kind of friend are you for wanting to make your friend cry. <br>  <br>  If she wanted to tell you how she feels, then she would. She obviously doesn't feel that comfortable enough around you to do so. And judging by your question I can understand why.|`|uurgL3oZaa	Tell them they're adopted. Worked at my house.|`|76140b1733cd124dbe960a504bc06f8daa	The best thing for her is to seek some psychotherapy. I'm sorry to tell you this - - but wanting her to cry won't help her at all. <br>  The best thing may be for her to see a psychotherapist.<br>  <br>  If she's sad all the time, she may be suffering from a clinical depression (I have been all my life), and I would suggest that you convince your friend to seek help from a psychiatrist (an MD).  Depending upon the diagnosis, the doctor may prescribe an anti-depressent. <br>  <br>  But in conjunction with the psychiatrist, she should still see a therapist. Talking over her problems to a trained therapist - would be a great help to her.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, having your friend cry (as a means of expressing her feelings) will not really help her at all. And if she will not express her feelings to you, then she might feel better with the help (and privacy) of a therapist.|`|Ed6oxtUTaa	Well I keep my feelings to myself because I dont want to make my problems someone elses.  Also if its something that can ruin a friendship, then i also keep it to myself.  The only way i talk about my feelings to someone is if they feel the same way (have the same problem).  I wish it we're the other way around for me, but i dont want to go and do/say something when the other person doesnt want to hear it.<br>  <br>  Try explaining to youre friend that there is nothing too stupid or wierd that he/she cant tell you because you dont judge people based on their feelings, because feelings cant be controlled.|`|7060eafce3928f5687a405e1d56fae80aa	People cant cry on demand unless they are a actor.<br>  Don't expect people to cry to suit yourself that's plain silly<br>  I think she already knows she can depend on you

bc013d45d546bad4f59ce63801728cabaa	The original was yes... When they went to do the 1983 remake with Al Pacino they decided they wanted to use the current political situation of the early 1980's and so they changed script. In answer to your question, the concept of Scarface is loosely based on Al "Scarface" Capone.|`|gqmtPx8gaa	No-<br>  <br>  it's based on a cuban immigrant who becomes a cocaine kingpin in Miami.

There are some actors who are not great looking but they have great talent and that makes them more appealing and believable.  Most people love seeing a great looking person on the screen but when a person is not great looking but can be a believable actor, then it works.  Danny DeVito is not a great looking actor (cute but very short and different than many others) but is talented, makes you laugh and has an impressive history doing acting and comedy.  He is not the Brad Pitt type but entertains an audience who love him for who he is and what he can offer.|`|4WlkDzLeaa	Sadly in Hollywood, good looks will help you get ahead.<br>  <br>  BUT good looks is not the only aspect of an acting career. In fact, if you are a terrific actor, than appearance  should play no part in your career. Hollywood has glamorized its actors too much, but a good actor needs to be talented and professional, needs to be able to interpret a script and develop a character in terms of the context and plot of the story. <br>  <br>  Good looking actors are not always the most outstanding ones.

I finally made Level 4!!!!!<br>  <br>  Big 30 Hometown:<br>  <br>  My computer runs so much faster!  Amazing what adding 4GB of ram will do :)  It was a beautiful trip up to the mountain.  Only takes about 1 1/2 hrs to get up there.  The sky was bright blue and after you go thru the big town of Boring, OR  the mountain seems so big, and the white against the blue sky is so pretty!  And yes, there is a small named Boring & it is boring!  I grew up there during my high school years!<br>  We added the ram, did all my updates, added a few new programs, got the music off my flash drive onto the computer, then onto my MP3.  All I did was sit with my feet up!  I requested an upbeat song on the way home, and I got home and Andrew had heard me.  I didn't get home till almost midnight.  It was a long day, but nice seeing my brother and nephew again.  Tonight we have to go about 1/2 the distance  and we are having a game night at my other sisters.  I've been practicing on the Wii!<br>  I'm jumping stations for an hour or so today.  I want to see George Strait and just can't win tickets, so Wolfe is giving them away at a car dealer a few miles from here.<br>  <br>  Hope you all have a wonderful weekend and be safe and warm in that white stuff.

3b8XhvuEaa	fruityloops is a good one|`|Nq95TtCeaa	Garage Band by Apple. The "Magic Garage Band" feature will even make arrangements, but its a lot more fun to do your own, once you know how to do it. You will need an Apple computer for this, but a lot of artists use Apple computers because of their ease of use - I do! The arrangements are royalty free, so anyone can use them, and once you  add in your own lyrics, you can copyright the song as your own. Check the Apple website for more details. I have the '08 version of the software - I don't have the '09 version. Contact me (email) if you have more specific questions on it.
a8Pq2Lmdaa	It is an overused phrase?  I have never heard before.<br>  <br>  I don't know, maybe because "the fat boys" breaking up is the last thing anyone thought would happen and it was a devastating event and then comes in the "and now this" an event that is even more devastating than the fat boys breaking up, but only because the fat boys broke up before event number 2 otherwise event number 2 would not have seemed so devastating.<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope that makes sense.  I should not answer questions before I have my morning coffee.

tuATxHsVaa	We still have all of those forms in music. They teach Sonata form, Rondo form, Sonata-Rondo form, Fugues, Minuets, Waltzes, and everything else at conservatories and other music schools across the nation. It's just that, for the most part, only intelligent people know what they are and how to use them. <br>  <br>  And also... well.. modern popular music has rendered mankind musically retarded in my opinion. Just look at all these "River Flows Through You" posts for proof of that one. Most of them can't even spell or use grammar properly. They think piano music is always Classical music.<br>  <br>  Even those people that have been educated in fugue and sonata writing do not necessarily know what the heck they are doing. You can't learn everything based on harmonic and melodic analysis. Sometimes, these things have to be learned by ear as much as by book-learnin'. To put it in another way - the obvious answer to your question is simple: The Classical era died out because Classical music is no longer the "popular" music. If everyone was listening to it and dancing to it, then people by and large would still be composing it.<br>  <br>  And yes, there still are a great many people that DO compose Classical or Baroque music. Most of the compositions that I have seen are not pleasing to my taste. I think people need to be raised properly in order to understand the language of Classical or Baroque music - i.e. stick them in a time machine, and put them back in 1780. Their Classical music would then be much more flawless. <br>  <br>  There are still a great many composers out there at work. Those television commercials don't make music for themselves, you know. I think your question is really asking "Why did the Classical era" die out. Most people say it is because the genre was exhausted (all ideas were taken), like the Romantic, but I don't buy that answer. <br>  <br>  How come people don't wear 70s style bell-bottoms or 80s style shoulder pads that much anymore? Things just change. People get older and the young generation tries something new - to distinguish itself. Baroque music yielded to Classical music in much the same way. C.P.E Bach described his father's music as dry and indeed rather dull... and he paved the way toward Classical music as a result. It wouldn't be long before a composer named Beethoven utterly exhausted the Classical style in his own way and forced beautiful Romanticism upon the world.<br>  <br>  Today Classical music is whatever you make of it. It is very much acceptable for you or any other composer to write in a Baroque or Classical style; however, you should expect a lot of criticism. Some people just hate backwards thinking. These people think that if modern music did not evolve from the Second Viennese School then it is worthless trash. It is a pity. <br>  <br>  Furthermore, the Rondo and the Sonata were perfected in the Classical era but are not at all strictly Classical. Both were around during the Baroque era - see the Rondeau from Bach's 2nd Orchestral Suite for one example. The Minuet and trio were also around in the Baroque era. All of these forms were used during the Romantic era. It could be that your love for purely Classical era music is blinding you to the greater developments. These forms didn't disappear, they just were expanded on and changed over the years.|`|9ee25102a7763535588f4a899e88f4dcaa	It never died out! There are still (and always will be) hundreds (even thousands) of composers writing 'classical' music (I use the word 'classical' in its most genereic way). While the era of the minuet and trio has long gone (like everything else, music evolved through time), many composers still use the old forms of symphony, concerto, etc and even write in sonata form. However, of course, the musical language has moved on a great deal since the time of Mozart and Beethoven.<br>  <br>  Don't make the mistake of thinking there are no longer 'classical' composers; there are plenty!|`|Wi0LBsVbaa	We no longer have the "classical" forms because they were dependent on classical harmony. Key relations are an important fact of the forms you mentioned, when key sense is mitigated by chromatic harmony, the structures fail. This is the reason for the gradual abandonment of the classical forms for programmatic music as tonality loosened. Bruckner tried to overcome this by using longer theme groups in a general tonal area, and clearly differentiated themes, Sibelius altered his forms and condensed them. Mahler, well if you hear structure in his works, you have a magnificent musical attention span.<br>  When the classical forms showed their limits, 20th century composers began looking to the Baroque era, for forms Bartok's concerto form being baroque, for example. Or they did away with the old forms all together.<br>  Where we have composers still using tonality, such as Howard Hanson, we still have the old forms with us. They may in fact come back, as there are many more composers bored of dissonance and atonality, than there were say 30 years ago. <br>  Here's to hoping.|`|AA12376180	Classical music is alive and well today, however the classical period has ended for the most part. There a many composers writing classical music today, however their music will not sound like Mozart or Beethoven. Music evolves and will continue to evolve because of human creatitivity. Some modern day composers still write using classical forms and some have abandoned them completely.|`|JDdKbIM1aa	we don't have those structures because we are no longer in the classical time period of music. those forms (as far as composing music is concerned) died out with the era or soon after the era ended. as someone else answered before: music is constantly evolving. <br>  as far as composers are concerned. if you want recently as in the last 50 years or so, look up leonard bernstein or john cage. if you want recently as in the last 10 years, look up eric whitacre.

369vsqhgaa	You are curious, versatile and lively with a lot of mental   energy.  You are probably a smooth talker and never shy about   expressing your ideas and opinions on whatever topic is on   hand.  You love to explore new ideas and to mentally challenge   yourself.  Mind games are just up your alley.  Social settings   are where you feel most comfortable because you excel at   communicating and engaging others.  Your thoughts move very   fast, skipping from one idea to the next.  In this you are hard to   pin down.        Your thoughts and opinions are always changing, in part   because you are always acquiring new knowledge.  The other   part is because you are also very adaptable.  Anything set in   stone loses appeal for you.  For you life is a journey, to gather   new and exciting ideas and thoughts.  Few things will make   you as irritable as others trying to tie you down to anything.  In   the same manner, matters in romantic love can be very sketchy   for you.  Though you enjoy companionship as much as anyone   else, you are firm in the belief that the grass is always greener   on the other side.  Besides, you love to discover new things   and routines, stability and structure bore you to tears.    As a Gemini, you are quick to adopt to new situations and are   great at fitting in with any occasion.  Your lively, youthful and   engaging personality is often widely appreciated by others.    Your sense of humor is very acute and you love to charm other   people with your cleverness.  This can also lead you to be very   condescending of others and arrogant about your own abilities.    You can enjoy verbal arguments and are far more likely to cut   someone down verbally than to get physical.  You can also be   terribly inconsistent, superficial and unable to make up your   mind.    The lesson of a Gemini is to learn to use their great mental   energy constructively.  Often a Gemini will use their need for   variety as an argument against applying themselves to   anything.  Instead of flitting to and from everything, a Gemini   needs to focus their abilities into something beyond superficial   situations.  They need to recognize their abilities as a gift and   to curb their arrogance and feelings of superiority over others.      Traditional  Gemini traits    Adaptable and versatile  Communicative and witty  Intellectual and eloquent  Youthful and lively      On the dark side....    Nervous and tense  Superficial and inconsistent  Cunning and inquisitive      http://mizian.com.ne.kr/englishwiz/libra...    ----has lots of info.|`|B7WIZdglaa	I have a wicked crush on one. He is funny, witty, and very un-clingy. Oh how I love that about him! He's very flighty though and it's hard to hold a solid conversation w/him. He seems very passionate about the things he holds dear though (his family, his dog, working out). I love his passion as well.    I have a boyfriend though, and we unfortunatly do not see eachother like we use to.

She was very two faced and you couldn't trust her at all.

23YPEAqBaa	I actually do have a positive story about bad breath.  Not mine, my boss' dragon breath. lol  He was an older man, a successful portrait photographer with high profile clients. Nobody else in the studio would tell him about it, but I did - gently, and in private.  He appreciated it so much (this was the morning before a major shoot) that he made me his only assistant, and from then on, taught me almost everything he knew.|`|uW7XLCF3aa	Good way to get rid of unwanted boyfriends...|`|8SyUHkPXaa	Avoids the lingering when a date is bad.

Bad breath is curable, very easily.  At least it was for me.  I got me an OraBrush and some mouthwash and now I clean my tongue every time I brush my teeth.  My wife tells me that I do not have bad breath. So if you want to drive people away then keep your bad breath, but if you want to be close to someone do something about bad breath.|`|avhgLEu8aa	Not positively, no.

Tarnations!!!<br>  <br>  dag nab it!!|`|KU5SB6Tlaa	Well, if he knocked it over in excitement and clumsiness, then no! He will not know what you are punishing him for and likely take the last thing he did (besides the bowl, because it was an accident) as wrong in your eyes.  Now if he consistently uses his snout to knock the bowl over, then yes.  However, i would say enough time has passed that you can no longer punish him with any effectiveness.  The quote "You gotta catch 'em in the act" is true; like i said, the dog will confuse your punishment with something else it did, because it will forget that it knocked the water over by now.|`|yuBuNoPDaa	We just clean it up.

"Rant" is just a word that people use to put you down, make you feel bad, and to make ppl feel threatened scared or nervous when they are trying to find an answer to something.    Whatever you want to say, or whatever you have said, or feel that you have to say to get your point across is not a "rant" it is a freedom of  speech and expression and sometimes bravery.    There are no such things as "rants",they are just a pretend feeling and "rant" is just a pretend and imaginatory phrase.|`|3mb5IV1Zaa	I can't stand the "In Loving Memory" stickers on the rear windows of vehicles. Seriously, is that the best way to remember somebody? I'm not trying to be insensitive, but if it was a drunk driving accident, then say, "So and so was killed by a drunk driver. Don't do it." I think it's passive-aggressive... and in my area of northern CA, they aren't just on the old, beat up cars... I saw one on the back of a new hummer. Seriously....

rEWZWZi5aa	If olive oil is made from squeezing olives,how is baby oil made|`|ClRuPRs7aa	It was at the end of the school year, and a kindergarten teacher was receiving gifts from her pupils. The florist's son handed her a gift. She shook it, held it overhead, and said, "I bet I know what it is. Some flowers." "That's right" the boy said, "but how did you know?" "Oh, just a wild guess," she said. <br>  <br>  The next pupil was the candy shop owner's daughter. The teacher held her gift overhead, shook it, and said, "I bet I can guess what it is. A box of sweets." "That's right, but how did you know?" asked the girl. "Oh, just a wild guess," said the teacher. <br>  <br>  The next gift was from the son of the liquor store owner. The teacher held the package overhead, but it was leaking. She touched a drop of the leakage with her finger and touched it to her tongue. "Is it wine?" she asked. "No," the boy replied, with some excitement. <br>  <br>  The teacher repeated the process, taking a larger drop of the leakage to her tongue. "Is it champagne?" she asked. "No," the boy replied, with more excitement. The teacher took one more taste before declaring, "I give up, what is it?" With great glee, the boy replied, "It's a puppy!"|`|gWQ3gOGlaa	Robert, a man is at a restraunt. a dog runs over and sits under his chair.

lUe4rReZaa	If  could only choose between those guitars I would get the first one the GRX20,  The GRGm51HP is a small scale portable with a built in speaker, good for traveling guitar to practice with, but not if you want to gig.  the IJX121 is a "starter pack" guitar, and I have never been impressed by any of those, It may be ok but I would need to play it first.    My best advice is to go out and play every guitar you can find in your price range,  forget about brands and just play them.  One will stand out from the others for comfort, playability, and tone, get that one.      Dude, have you had someone look at your current guitar, you may just be able to replace the neck if it is cracked.|`|bilBsC0Raa	I recommend you cut down the price of that amp. You want a nicer guitar than amp. You can get a $200 Line 6 amp that is really nice. That leaves you to $200 left. I would get a $200 Squier Telecaster that is nicer than it's price.|`|jWMXi3Lnaa	Ibanez is  2 on my list. Of course  1 is Fender. But I would choose the 2nd one|`|DUGZa0Zgaa	Get a Made In Mexico Stratocaster.|`|DnWsMhwLaa	it is my expert opinion that you need to spend the whole 400 on a guitar (assuming you have an amp at all) if you have been at it for 2 years and you are wanting to keep going, it is time for a real guitar.  and that you should find it used somewhere, pawn shop, guitar store, play many of them, do your research, and find yourself a bargain. then save up your money for a new amp.|`|lo12E7T2aa	I have the second one and it works for me. Well good luck dude. Hope you get an amazing guitar!   ~Lacy~|`|voRpCmFvaa	Ew!    Buy a  Fender or a Gibson.|`|rNXcSGwtaa	I like the epiphone wilshire they have
Qih2hKqkaa	Lying is wrong.  Period!|`|FDt7cC8haa	No, a relationship built on lies is destined to fail|`|e55d4a01420a2827c4108baf10b7d77daa	Lying to save a relationship is like fixing a bridge with Poli-Grip. It might patch things up in the short term, but in the end, it'll make the problems worse off than they would be anyway. If you have to lie to preserve the relationship for awhile, it'll just crumble once the lie's found out, and it's not a good relationship anyway.<br>  <br>  Lying to save someone's life would be a completely different scenario, however. Had you asked that, you'd have posed an interesting moral dilema.|`|60aa2c1f0300ff1e992f1bde00c32822aa	~~ Bad idea, but I gather there must be something to hide that might hurt the other ~~?|`|AA10838250	never|`|215646253ac5e0903ab28bc43e031fd3aa	I never lie...the truth is hard enough to remember !|`|GTsKitahaa	That is crazy.  You can't lie to save a relationship.  If you lie, there is no trust, without trust, there is no love.  Without love, there is no relationship.|`|SiEpVRuOaa	if you learned from your behavior and you will NEVER do it again and you know if you tell then your relationship is over then DO NOT TELL|`|vD5ysjwraa	That all depends on what you are lying about|`|UIzaamJ7aa	It'll make it worse...|`|AKVQNGcOaa	if it's a good relationship, you shouldn't have to lie

h1IYS0dbaa	You asked this question before.<br>  <br>  The general public in Europe doesn't know Chet Baker either. You say it yourself. THE JAZZ CLUBS in Paris were silent out of of respect. Only a small number of people in Europe go to jazz clubs.<br>  <br>  The cultural level in the U.S. is not low because of your example. Actually, the fact that Chet Baker was an American proves the contrary. The great majority of the finest jazz musicians in history are Americans.|`|2YShU0IKaa	Well the club in France is a jazz club so that's no surprise.  Comparing a jazz club, even one in another country, to the "public" of a country with extremely diverse musical tastes is kind of like the comparing apples to oranges thing.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Also, comparing Americans to Frenchmen is like comparing apples to polar bears.|`|V5GtTrtsaa	Um. No.  Just because people in the U.S. don't respect or look up to the same celebrities and artists and cultural statutes as France doesn't mean that we're at a "lower cultural level".  It just means that we value different things -- and the fact that an entire continent (in general) is basically biased towards us and thinks we're a low quality society because of that just shows how ignorant and judgemental the majority of the people on that continent are.|`|6N8aZlhbaa	No, I don't think it indicates that the culture level in the USA is low, it indicates that most Americans aren't interested in Jazz, or at least Chet Baker.|`|RvnBuOROaa	yes that does indicate america has low culture. or that you dont talk to the right people, and go to the right places, and that you care to much about the public|`|qQf0V6iWaa	There are a lot of people that "the USA public at large would not even know".  That doesn't prove anything about the culture level.

VSw6eN4Baa	It's simply localized anesthesia. It goes by the name of Novacaine. It works by in 8 steps:<br>  <br>     1.  Displacement of calcium ions from the nerve receptor site<br>     2. Binding of local anesthetic molecule to this receptor site<br>     3. Blockade of the sodium channel<br>     4. Decrease in sodium conductance<br>     5. Depression of rate of electrical depolarization<br>     6. Failure to achieve threshold potential level<br>     7. Lack of development of propagated action potential<br>     8. Conduction blockade<br>  <br>  Enjoy :)|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Novocaine - it takes a few hours to wear off.|`|SkFgDxpEaa	idk what it is but omg! you can't feel your mouth or cheeks for so long after|`|5faa7df1dbf6be8d22c72f7cca966e7baa	Novocaine.|`|nkmwGAKjaa	A form of xylocaine.|`|c3ed7dc313b7c0181d81e54a991e8038aa	Novocaine<br>  <br>  the last time i had that, my whole face was numb for like 5 hours all in thanks to my wisdom teeth.|`|nO2vflnPaa	cocaine...OOPS!

They should have ended it in the fourth series in my opinion. It's the same every single year!    "10:04am in the Big Brother house, Mutya eats a biscuit."    I mean who honestly cares???|`|0789e50a1396d5b6b9138ceaad0e64f5aa	Yes I will Titch but it does need a big shake up instead of the so called 'ordinary' housemates which have been appearing in the last few years.  Last year we saw most of the HMs had appeared on tv or were 'famous' for something or other.  It needs to be going back to the original format when it first started if it is to haul in the viewers again and not the wannabees of latter years.|`|SHeLdu8haa	I hope not but i guess I will survive ....Maybe they will bring out something else to fill in the space.|`|aKhZNd7daa	I'm actually inclined to agree with Tony here Titch !!    However if it is true then maybe they should give the programme a good shake up.  I personally enjoyed BB USA last year when it was aired on ITV2 - maybe they should try using that format !|`|XmD61yBpaa	i hope so|`|in6nku0Kaa	we can live in hope that it will never grace are screens again!|`|AA11052660	i enjoyed it while it lasted, but its been 10years or thereabouts, i am ready for something new and enlightening.  I am growing tired of it, and have often felt that they should skip a couple of years here and there.|`|441GSyaMaa	I liked to watch it... like about 3-4 years ago. It's stupid now, they only ask for opposites to go in, like gay people, people inflicted with someone sort of illness or disease, transvestites.. then BNP supporters, intolerant people. It's just annoying now.    I look forward to it going, especially because channel 4 often do have some interesting documentaries and stuff on it, that's rather fun :-P    PLUS all the papers won't include so much pathetic news of what's happening in the house... lol|`|iFCBEZW7aa	It has been pretty rubbish recently, but it gives you something to watch.

Edit: Titch sweetie I didn't know your real name was Angharad...you must be Welsh!|`|efQGWAoMaa	I hope it is - its a proper freak show now and its painful viewing most of the time.    Channel 4 make such great programmes, why spend any more money on a series that has run its course. xxx|`|RIjjibnwaa	Yea definitely, I hope it doesn't go. It might not as Davina was saying in an interview not that long ago that although the ratings are falling, it's still getting the highest ratings on channel 4.|`|LcS5oJcdaa	Many people think its just a stupid reality television show, but personally I love it...

But i do think it has run it course now and from when all the racist thing started the other year with Jade Goody and then the 1 from this year about coolio, it wudnt surpris me if the ratings had gone down alot!!|`|m7Z6a3NZaa	It was good while it lasted, but I bet there's millions glad to see it go.|`|LAdyqASxaa	To be honest A, I won't be that annoyed, beginning to think it has run its course    Some of the tasks repeat and just a few repetitive things .. we will just need something better to take it's place|`|Q7Sy9Cnraa	Even though i loved CBB this Year,and i'm glad Ulrika Won the Show. I think it is about time the Show was axed forever!    It ran it's course years and years ago when one the best Series(BB3 with Jade Goody etc etc ) went off air.    That was the one that made the Show come into it;'s own and it was brilliant to watch. ;)  But BB4 was a massive disappointment,it was SO boring and this was evident,as they got appalling ratings for it.    It will be an end of an era,..but it's time it should go,...and not comeback.

Women are azzholes. The minute someone walks out of the room. Slammed! Then everyone pitches in to buy baby shower gifts and birthday cakes.

Of course, in politics, your enemy can become your friend, and the enemy of your friend is your enemy, and all that jazz, so who knows?|`|k8QlPisUaa	In high school I had to keep my enemies closer …. I was in a fight with a football player. I guess he played a really important position for the team or whatever.

It's awesome.|`|vvTrmHtxaa	i love heroes still and season 3 is better than season 2 at least volume 4 part of it!<br>  <br>  please pick me as best answer!|`|zovrJ0yXaa	i agreed with everything you said till you said lost was the greatest show ever. i can name at least 5 shows off the top of my head that are better than it. the wire, the sopranos and battlestar galactica are unquestionably better. but like you say, heroes wouldnt be one of them. stick to your guns and dont watch season 3 of heroes, cos it has been absolutely appalling so far. i have been a die-hard fan from the beginning but i am seriously considering giving up. thats how bad it is. also, season 5 of lost has been ok so far, but its nowhere near as good as season 4. that had a much better focus, you could feel the season moving towards something, whereas this season has mostly been a mess of flashbacks which havnt really answered anything and trying to get the oceanic six back to the island, when the whole of last season was about getting them off the island (i realise they have been officially off the island since the last episode of season 3 but the end of season 4 was where they showed it in depth rather than a one episode flashback). im sure the season will pick up soon but its been a bit slow and disappointing for me so far|`|VC2zDWJ8aa	I watch them both...haha, i stopped watching heroes in the second season too, but i decided to give it another try and i finished it out.

I would say the best ever made, for sure!

A neighbor ripped an old car body off the frame and installed a truck bed camper. He has the only RV in town now.<br>  <br>  Dallas|`|BJkfY3g4aa	Well of sorts...yea.|`|AA10415600	i ate a homeless guy once...wait, you're talking about cars. uh, never mind. the answer is no, definitely not|`|tvdabilNaa	NOT myself!|`|RqevddVvaa	move parts from one to another, to get it working, sure|`|p03Jc7eHaa	just people|`|ICLekd2Vaa	well on a multi date escorting, i did do them until i hadd some of each so i could finish!! ;)

ebxwADDcaa	you are pretty good. there is definitely potential there
el8yX5q3aa	yep..heard it this morning.  Anyone who acts and carries on like that should be thrown off the set for abuse.  they should have called the cops.    He did not disagree with someone on quality of work...he was screaming like that at the director because the director accidentally walked in front of the camera and they had to retake it.        THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR SOMEONE TO TALK LIKE THAT...NO EXCUSE!  You can agree to disagree and be adult about it.  This man has serious anger issues.    I think it should be in the contract that they have to be human and moral at least.|`|fHIXRFqHaa	Simply put, he went overboard. I don't care who you are, you just don't treat others that way. There goes my respect for him.|`|2BEMSGPdaa	I saw it and it seemed that what he was yelling about was somebody who did not respect him asking for quality work. An artist has that right.|`|91d486d9ee1450850f05415bcfc95c06aa	When you're in the middle of a major project, going the extra mile to get it completed in a quality way--it's really irritating when someone disrupts your work. It was just one moment, get over it. Plus the guy didn't really stick up for himself, which probably made it worse.|`|135587141c574a1880bd4e34dcbdb34caa	At first, I thought he was a total tool.  But you don't know the circumstances on the set that day, what kind of scene he was shooting or how long he had been working that day, etc.    Factor in that the DP had done this once before on the set and blown a scene.  Bale makes reference to him doing this "again" and something along the lines of if the DP does it a third time and is still hired, Bale is walking.    Granted, there was no need to go off on him so long, and after the guy apologized, but you never know.    I think he could have been less of an ****** about it though, because now that it's out and hearing him threaten to walk out, some directors might think twice about having him in their cast.    I heard the production company sent this to their insurance company just in case Bale walked.|`|Oh3yVRQzaa	Nobody knows the full story - there are three sides to every one.     People think that actors sit around in their trailers all day sipping on champagne - when the reality is - they often spend 12 - 14 days on set in whatever conditions the movie takes place in - in make up - wardrobe (which can be intense depending on the movie) and it takes the perfect conditions to for a scene to be done right - so when this DP messed up the scene once bofore - I would be angry too.    This guy is the Director of Photography he should know his job (his job listings aren't that impressive anyways - Semi Pro, Drumline)     It is so easy to judge someone else's actions as opposed to our own. I have a bad temper and I know it and I've freaked out on people before (minus all the swear words)     What is important is how the person redeems themselves post their verbal expression. Obviously Bale didn't shut down production - so they must have kissed and made up.     People say a lot of things when they're angry.|`|iAuvoQeHaa	He has anger management problems allright. I don't care you think you're a hot guy or big star, no excuse not treating others with proper respect.|`|cPQ6lyk2aa	Yeah I heard it but that's an actor for ya. They're all rich and think they own the world. It really doesn't surprise me that it came out on him since he just got called out on abusing his wife. Hate it for him.
ACoviJV5aa	1. i honestly don't have any clue of what that group could be about, but im not surprised that bart was in it. it always seemed like there was something more to him. im glad that his death isnt the last we see of his influence.  2. i just say, FINALLY. i got so sick of them together. the whole drama between them has been stretched out for way too long. it would be interesting if they were permanently exes then rufus and lily got married, but im not sure if i would really want that to happen  3. i HATE her. but at least she made dan and serena break up. ive never really liked dan either. he says he hates the whole high society concept, but he never acts like it. the way jenny put it in some episode at the end of season one, "you act like you're so different, but the minute you start sending tips to gossip girl, you're in the game with the rest of us." i think dan and ms carr need to get caught and he needs to be a total outcast again at school, but this time he will actually care about his reputation. but i think ms carr should stay on the show for a while. even though her character is unpleasant, she does make the show interesting, just like georgina, marcus and his step mom, jack bass, and many others did.    heres my question: what is going on with blair's mom? she got married and hasnt been on the show since. they kind of wrote aaron off the show, but he is blair's step brother. i really hated aaron, though, more than ms carr lol|`|kMp5p3r7aa	dan and serena are over !  dan slept with ms carr|`|QAQHJFI9aa	I hate Ms. Carr too. God, she looks like she's 14 but is supposed to be like 20-something and a teacher! I hate that she slept with Dan and she didn't even know if Dan and Serena were still together when she seduced him. I hope she gets hit by a bus. Have a nice day!|`|MQNYKISWaa	teh next episode is not on until March 2 or 9 they havn't decided yet

mu5wW7Tkaa	Her days basically consist of writing, recording, doing interview/photo shoots, etc. When she goes home, she likes to just hang out and do things that normal people do like bowling and watching sports.|`|dFHsAXDMaa	LOL stalker are you in love with the image of Carrie Underwood lol <br>  <br>  her typical day is probably wake up go pee, brush teeth have coffee eat a bagel low fat cream cheese of course. shower dress go to rehearsal or the studio spend hours recording or if on tour getting ready for a show. dealing with stalker men like you. taking a healthy crap wiping her butt with charmin  having a glass of wine watching a tv show  brushing teeth and going to bed to start all over again the next day<br>  <br>  But if you really want to know get a job for Extra and you may after 5 or 6 years have the chance to interview her yourself|`|mGvpcZrFaa	Probably she watch ESPN she's a HUGE fan of sports specially football and hockey.|`|V9pAr6Ysaa	she probably just bosses people around in her twangy accent...haha|`|nANyAvzgaa	Call her up and find out!

5KQ9JdLEaa	More than likely, I'd try to start a conversation with you, and possibly ask you out for coffee or tea.  I don't generally try to "hit" on women and definitely not in a bar.  That is so cliche'.  Plus, I wouldn't ask you out for drinks (in a bar) because I don't feel people need alcohol to loosen up to one another.  Yes, I do drink alcohol occasionally, however, I don't use it as a tool to pry into people's lives.<br>  <br>  As for what I would say, it depends on your eyes.  A woman's eyes are the first thing I notice, and they are also very revealing about the woman's personality.  If you have beautiful eyes, I will make a comment to the affect that you have beautiful, or smiling, eyes.  I wouldn't try to impress you, rather I'd let you make your own intelligent decision based on your adventurous and spontaneous nature.<br>  <br>  Believe me, I've heard some real winners when it comes to pick up lines by guys, and I'd never try to stoop to that level.

u0udwkZQaa	I'm a big 'ol scaredy cat, but I have my moments. I have scary moments every week, but I don't pay them much attention and just get on with it. We're talking about big fears though, aren't we? My biggest fears come at major crossroads when I have the option to take the easier road or the one I know I'm supposed to. Thankfully I don't have many of those moments, but usually the gravity of the importance of me doing the right thing opens and pushes me through that door of the unknown, and once I've made the first committed step I'm on my way --which is most of the battle-- and there's no turning back at that point.|`|VBtzeVlKaa	Afraid?  Fear?  What is that?!  ;-)   Haha<br>  <br>  I do try not to let fear control my life, as it would only keep me from living it to the fullest.<br>  <br>  Leaps of faith allow you to spread your wings and fly. They open new worlds for us, new doors. Even when we are not sure what lies there on the other side, if we don't try we will never know and most likely miss out on a great opportunity.. and always wonder, "What IF I had taken the chance?!" <br>  <br>  I dont want to wonder my life away, I want to KNOW...|`|BJPJDLZmaa	when I decided to answer this question|`|WQvDIhmgaa	It seems like almost everyday I'm taking a leap|`|erifEH7Haa	I can't remember.

1ahf1CAVaa	DELIVER, without a doubt. Being in the construction field for over 30+  years ive picked up fingers off the ground, seen guys pass the circular saw threw their legs,  and falling off roofs. You develope a certain calm within.

If every thing goes normally, and normally is what happens most of the time, then it can be done.  Babies come when babies decide to come.  The process itself proceeds without any help from you.  If you know nothing else you just make the woman as comfortable as possible and be their to play catcher.  Now, if something goes wrong you're in trouble. Women have babies all over place in the US and really all over the place in other countries.  It's a very natural process.  Now, on tv something always goes wrong.|`|Tr1hzduraa	I have three kids and was there for all the deliveries helping as much as the Doc would allow.

FfxmE9Toaa	Even though Schoolboys In Disgrace had a big hit with "No More Looking Back" it just doesn't test well with rock or oldies audiences.

jxizzHL1aa	It's almost unfair to put Alucard against Dante.  I'm not really feeling Alucard's new look, but then again his SotN design didn't get the girls wet either.  Even if you wanted to go on personality Alucard as a character isn't that developed.   Dante on the other hand has a hotblooded personality that completely overshadows Alucard.  What's more is that he's got looks that everyone can agree on.  Whether it be the bishonen-ish style of DMC3 or the rugged manliness of DMC4<br>  <br>  Also Alucard spent like a couple hundred years sleeping in the dirt because he got depressed.  Doesn't really sound like the guy you'd wanna go on a date with.|`|ZfqKbAB8aa	Dante|`|G7OwyyHPaa	i have never heard of them.|`|8815883e2ab4555a79f3a28621142ab1aa	who are these ppl?|`|wdxUb3moaa	*Dante*  eeeeeeeeep!  <----fan girl<br>  <br>  EDIT- Video game is good but they made an anime and although it wasn't Great I have some of the episodes and watched the season.....

The tobacco company didn't force my relative to smoke!<br>  If I could sue tobacco for their death then I could sue the grocery stores for my obese relatives dying of heart attacks!|`|e41w1Cmuaa	No, because they put warnings on cigarette packets saying that smoking causes health problems and you could die. It's the persons choice to buy the product and use it, so their death will be their fault.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped  :)|`|Vgk8VnXwaa	Only if the tobacco companies come into their home and force them to smoke.|`|0sUBfPl2aa	NO -- everyone is sue-happy in this country|`|AA11156037	NOPE  There are warning labels on cigars, snuff, pipe tobacco and cigarettes. <br>  They are there FOR A REASON!<br>  <br>  Its like the Old Lady in Albuquerque suing over HOT coffee getting dumped in her lap.

Ow3O7h4caa	Conjunctions are important because this aspect means the beginning of a new cycle; the old one is finished and a new one begins. Whether it will be harmonious or inharmonious depends on the nature of the planets which form this aspect. If between benefics (the Sun, Venus and Jupiter), they are good, or if the planets of variable nature (the Moon and Mercury), are aspected by conjunction or parallel with the benefics it is good.<br>  <br>  Square – indicates inhibition, inability, or restriction….Their energies are released when the aspect is resolved; not as exteriorized as opposition. This represents forcefulness and expenditure of energy- the best dynamic power there is to get things done. It gives enterprise and independent action as well as the possibility of disobedience, disregard for rules and regulations.<br>  <br>  One important note to remember. A natal square is not active yet at birth. It gives you a good clue  as to timing the most important actions you take in life because the natal square declares you WILL and the progressed square or aspect to it says WHEN. <br>  One of the planets enforces the other one to act in  extreme ways, causing all kinds of obstacles and challenges.  We may chose to work with the energy of a square in two ways.  If we chose to work with this energy constructively, it urges us into taking action to overcome the obstacles.  If used destructively, it will cause frustration and maintain the presence of the challenge or obstacle.<br>  <br>  In a chart reading, trines are ok but the squares are the rewarding factor in any chart. You get to learn to work with your squares so that the lessons they learn, will reward you with the trine.<br>  The trine always follows the square and is the reward that awaits you if you did your lessons well.|`|5l2kTANaaa	Of course !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Who would not ?<br>  <br>  It would be like a completely screwed up pic otherwise.<br>  <br>  Well you got.......lots of very good info before I posted this.<br>  <br>  So am just a " fill the blank"..........:-)))<br>  <br>  reading leftie..I have a moon-mars conjunction in leo trine my sun in sag...........it really took me a LON G TIME to find it out..really.. I was all water ( scorpio - pisces) before..although am still am..<br>  <br>  Balance ?? leave it to Libras lol :-)|`|32P3hG0Laa	Left-T has done a magnificent job answering your question. I am impressed and have nothing to add...|`|wNruC52haa	Left-T Your Perfect :) I've Sun square Jupiter. Keep the good work man. Hey laro :)|`|cuIX13BKaa	The first answer is absolutely brilliant. I could no more answer the question regarding squares or conjunctions any better if I tried to....I always learn things here even though I have been studying Astrology for a long time. The points made about the Natal Chart are stellar to say the least.....see we always look to see how our Natal Charts might compare with what is happening now. We change, life is always in flux and the reply about the given lot of time within a true Conjuction is absolutely right on. These are NOT things that we feel right away, nor what would seem to be malefic, the Squares either......Oppositions or the effects of not even having the charts exactly right, which for all of time will be a subject we broach. As we slide into any of a number of aspects, we can begin to 'feel' or 'notice' lsight to majour changes. Yes i DO pay attention to them.....but admittedly often give myself a break as it becomes a rather heady thing and I become saturated with "What are the consequences going to be...?" Rather than enjoying my life....well I AM a Virgo and first and foremost I WILL analyze. When we hit a true defined Conjunction and then notice after a while that there is this incredible intensity of occurences, we await them again...but the next timn the planetary configurations are ALL different as the Universe is always in flux. I see the oncoming Square and brace myself for a 'disruption in the force' so to speak as though I am manning some sort of Astrological Natal Chart of Mine Spaceship and the Asteroids are coming! I have to laugh at myself in this. We are always looking for those things that make us luckier, more comfortable, life changing, when will we meet that person or those persons......when will I be cut a break sort of thing......and I actually throw my hands up because I am not yet convinced that we know enough using only the planets that we have.......staying with Pluto even though it has been downgraded....as a generational aspect I STILL look at it.....however I cannot allow myself to mourn in advance....and my 3 planets in Cancer and 3 in Libra allow me to worry quite a bit.....I can also laugh at my own Oppostions and say..."OK...brace yourself...this is maybe NOT going to be so easy.....but without some sort of flux and friction we can never grow....." ~ Of course I say this a lot easier than I can do it....I am JUST being honest! Yes i pay attention to things, note that there are patterns....and I cannot honestly say that every conjunction has been a smoothe ride......but the beauty of anything is that through the growth of seeming malefics as well the smooth sailing of Conjunctions (allegedly) all make for constant growth....would I have it any other way? I am human...of course i would....not always but sometimes and I LOVE hearing about another persons take on this....and their perceptions of certain aspects and conbinations therein. This question has already been answered brilliantly and I am actually smiling at the incredible aptitude of the aforemetntioned answer. If all Conjunctions were that wonderful.....wouldn't our Solar Returns be more comfortable? If all Squares were like having a burr in ones pantyhose (just an example people) were to be dodged in the trenches of our immediate comfort....the element of our growth would be far more highly in question. My Birthdays are never that comfortable, but I love them.....change is hard.....but without it we would remain small minded, irreverent and somewhat ignorant of what the changes are we DO have to make. I leave it to yo uto pose a question that on the immediate seems so simple....and in actuality is a LOT deeper than one would imagine. Kudos to you once more....I am happy with a format that with the click of a button or key can lead me to the question and above answer....."Wow.....(I think to myself...) THAT person really has thought this out and communicated it beautifully!" was and is my reaction. In conclusion....yes I see them...the aspects, sometimes await them....but God help me that I should lay down and be a speedbump just because of things such as past Oppostions!<br>  <br>  Garbo<br>  <br>  Virgo/Aries/Cancer

Jn09dNMvaa	The Hot rod Deluxe is a great amp. I own and love it. If you want a pop punk sound like blink 182 you will need a pedal most likely. the stock distortion is sufficient for some stooges stuff, ramones, etc. an overdrive like a jeckyll and hyde works great with this amp. cascade the overdrive into the distortion. i also use a big muff into the clean and distortion channel. mostly for white stripes type stuff. Overall this amp takes to pedals very well. <br>  <br>  generally you are going to see lots of marshall stacks. Mike Ness uses a Bassman i think. <br>  <br>  In my opinion there is no such thing as a punk amp. Some of the best bands i have seen, get what they can afford and make it work. In some cases it was a free bass amp. the "punk" sound has become so inbred. use what works for you. unless you're in a cover band and need an exact replica of other peoples tone.|`|TKsYoM26aa	i would say yes. idk much about the hot rod deluxe but i know the metal zone is very versatile. you would probably want to push ur treble and mids for punk rock tho.<br>  <br>  however another option you could explore is using more of an overdrive  instead of a distortion. the metal zone can get pretty vicious (which is sometimes good) but an overdrive sound is gonna give you that dirty crunch that is so classic in punk.|`|ZBVfc2rRaa	yeah. a hot rod deluxe is a great versatile amplifier. great clean tones and if you crank the volume, the amp breaks up and you get a nice gritty, overdriven tone, but you can also beef it up with a distortion pedal or a tube screamer. <br>  <br>  but a better amp for punk is a jcm 800 combo. a little more expensive than the fender HRD, but its tone is great.|`|A17VcS2aaa	id say thats fine, but if u want a even better rig, get an epiphone valve jr half stack or combo amp f(or 5 watts its plenty loud) and a boss ds-1 distortion pedal.when the tubes break up on this amp, it is beautiful. oh ya did i mention its $240 for the stack and $200 for the combo?
oGW5O5bbaa	Soul is a mix of gospel and rhythm & blues.  Some soul artists include Ray Charles, Solomon Burke, Sam Cooke, Otis Redding, etc.<br>  <br>  R&B (Rhythm & Blues) was a blanket term for the combining of soul & funk.  By the 1970's R&B became a blanket term for the mixture of soul, funk, and disco. <br>  <br>  Rap (Rapping) is the rhythmic spoken delivery of rhymes, wordplay, and poetry, one of the elements of the hip hop music genre. Rapping can be delivered over a beat or without it.  Early rappers include Run DMC, Blondie, SugarHill Gang, Public Enemy, The Beastie Boys, etc.<br>  <br>  I personally love all 3 genres!!|`|ZkrIJtbTaa	well the tone and the wordz

dl1yuCoFaa	I agree, a one piece bathing suit would be much more suitable for this show. I have to wonder if the producers/staff of the show provide the swimsuits that they want the contestants to wear. Either that, or the girls are encouraged to bring along the skimpiest bikinis they own. Many of the girls' bikinis all appeared to be the same style, just different colors. It appeared to me that Candace was actually wearing a bra last night, not just a bikini top.<br>  <br>  And many of the guys had on very similar swim trunks last night. Different colors, but very similar styles. It was my understanding that the contestants were put into the game with only the clothes on their backs. I didn't think they were allowed to bring any baggage with them. I'm sure it's probably done to get the ratings from viewers. More skin = higher ratings.|`|Iz5tNA5aaa	Totally agree.  Also, the skimpier the bikini the more shaving that needs to be done and with no shaving gear --- you know where I'm going with it.<br>  <br>  I would bring a one piece just so that I could get physical without worrying.

BJkfY3g4aa	I've got so many damned possums around here I could feed a village.<br>  <br>  Ick, not that I'd ever try to cook one. Gawd have I got a funnyassed possum story to tell. It happened last week...<br>  <br>  Will this be considered chatting? I don't care...<br>  <br>  So last week, I went out to the dog kennels to give the dogs (one being a redbone coonhound) some water and some love. Well there is a possum laying in her kennel...so I called my husband to tell him about it, because I thought it was weird for that thing to be "in" her kennel. So he tells me to pick it up by the tail and drag it out of there. I said, "Hell, no I'm no picking that thing up" mostly because they stink really bad. So he says..."Well get a shovel, scoop it up and get it out of there" he doesn't want the coonhound to be messing with the possum because then she'll be tracking them too when she should only track racoons. So anyway...I go get a shovel and play hell trying to scoop that thing up and get it away from her and get out of the kennel without her getting out too. I throw it out on to the driveway and turn around to put the shovel away. I go back out to look at the ugly thing because I thought for sure it was dead...it's teeth were showing and it's tongue was hanging out and it didn't look like it was breathing. I thought for sure that she had killed it. So I go around to look at it and the damned thing blinked! In the mean time...my cell rings and it's my Mother in law and I was telling her about it and within 15 minutes...that damned thing was up and walking away. It started off walking up toward the house like it was coming to get revenge, then it went to the huge oak tree in the front and up the tree it went.<br>  <br>  Ok, so that's my possum story. Carry on...<br>  <br>  Edit: I love you swallow...you make me laugh and I really need that. *kiss* you sexybitch!|`|8CUfDxRtaa	wow that was a novel.....last time I went toe to toe w/ a opossim I was armed with a pitchfork.

buiHdl0Gaa	Line the walls with sound absorbing material - styrofoam or heavy curtains - anything to absorb the sound instead of having it bounce off the walls. Get better speakers, and upgrade the sound card in yr computer. Computers are not very good at reproducing sounds. You need a better audio system probably.|`|GqEAun7Baa	The worst possible acoustics are in a square room. Try putting it in a room that is as oddly shaped as possible.

F32uPjAraa	Birds are descendants of dinosaurs. So it must be the egg.|`|71mzNtu6aa	The dinosaur! It has been discovered that the chicken is a long relative of the dino family! so, the dinosaur came first! <br>  <br>  How a dino became a chicken:<br>  THEORY ONE:<br>  A mother dinosaur laid eggs, but then did not care for them, so the dinosaurs did not fully develop, and came out much smalled and furrier, as what is not known chickens<br>  THEORY TWO:<br>  A dinosaur egg by the smallest dinosaur type called "Compsognathus", they probably laid their eggs, but one of the babies was born with a birth defect, coming out like a chicken in modern day|`|JgDRKLuLaa	Darwinian evolution through natural selection.|`|s1leABaSaa	The Chicken, no wait the egg, no pretty sure it was the chicken... nah the egg. Ahhhh|`|hfr9rLjkaa	Me i came first..I made god,Then he made Chickens then they made eggs! xx|`|x6bbhRcHaa	the chicken;eggs cant come|`|HC6rrHLDaa	The egg. Everyone believes that everything just appeared and that it was a chicken. But think about it. A dinosaur didnt just appear. There was probably an egg that had to hatch first. So i think that the egg came first.|`|FgWx0hfPaa	Creationism. God created all living things, therefore the chicken and rooster were made with out parents and them hatching from eggs. then with the chick and the rooster, they knew each other and had chicks which hatched from eggs.|`|brz4ojOeaa	Well, this is actually a big controversy. Most Americans say the chicken, but if you were to go somewhere like China, they would say the egg... in Chinese of course! lol|`|HLQlr6pAaa	The chicken.  God made animals not eggs|`|L86QJXzEaa	Egg<br>  dinosaurs=]|`|xhqKLSwCaa	The Rooster  :p|`|Pa0jmm1Yaa	the chicken

PbgcwQe1aa	Fall Out Boy and Panic! at the Disco are both amazingly awesome bands! You have terrible taste in music if you think otherwise!|`|FDt7cC8haa	I think both of those bands have some well written songs....Sorry that you don't enjoy those, but there are plenty of people that do..  Just because you don't like them doesn't mean they suck....|`|ixLoI73uaa	FOB's last 2 albums sucked bad|`|gDxMoBl9aa	Every time Eddie Vedder, Kid Rock, or Fred Durst open their mouths Your theory is disproved.|`|78d567ba4ef552df04b4e4bac0f97f4daa	They Suck Equally !|`|VHQ7l1fMaa	both are bad, but FOB. (tom745 cracked me up!)    but the worst band ever? NICKELBACK. they literally make me nauseous when i hear or see them.|`|LMRaSXFeaa	fall out boy fails,  but panic at the disco is amazing. :]|`|HGnWKRzyaa	Panic|`|rghk8yMeaa	fall out boy. they cant sing and u cant understand what theyre saying and the songs dont even have a good beat|`|DUGZa0Zgaa	I've never heard them but I bet they suck.  But they probably don't suck as bad as Nickelback.|`|ZzqWzFNiaa	you're so cool.|`|X4UAMHhRaa	fall out boy sucks more. cant stand them!|`|vFrnGtiDaa	Fall Out Boy|`|d0YiyKZ7aa	fall out boy - the sucking sound just follows them around|`|bw1Uc8icaa	my opinion, i dont like either. but many people do. i wouldnt say they sucked though cause they both actually have a little tallent.|`|EhHNDf0xaa	FOB definatelly. their songs are really easy to follow and they are all pretty much the same. Panic has got some variation to their songs which makes them more interesting and worth listening to.  if you have heard one FOB song you have heard them all... trust me...  besides they have a video with midgets in it (not that i have anything agaist migdets, you rock little people) it was just a failure of a very bad attempt to look cool , whereas panic had a really cool video with the wedding and the scary gothicy people ... (HIM FOR THE WIN)  =]
X4UAMHhRaa	I agree. I honestly feel like all they did was smoke some weed and wrote some simple riffs and poof! a recording contract.     I heard that they're a bunch of a'holes too. I heard that from someone who interviewed them, said that they got their heads stuck up their ass3s. Really? its not like they write complicated music to act like that *scoffs* ...the nerve!|`|tlj3c50Haa	"Well, to start. ONE question mark is enough, we get your enthusiasm.  Second, it would have HAS no talent."    They are exclamation marks. (Though I'm sure you already knew that.)  It would not necessarily be 'has'. If (s)he is referring to the individual band members as a group rather than the group as a whole, 'have' is probably more appropriate. ("those four people has no talent" - see my point?) However, if that is the case, it should be "Weezer suck..."    As for the question... I like Weezer... I've only heard the blue album. Either way, why do you want to talk about bands you don't like?|`|gDxMoBl9aa	Mindlessly rant much?|`|cGcoJ0dNaa	inorite? their latest album is in my bin|`|yRE2HDr3aa	The Blue Album is good    If you don't like it, it doesn't mean it takes no talent. Their new stuff isn't that great.|`|kP0JGI1waa	Yeah I never really saw anything in Weezer and never listen to them, although I generally dont listen to their style of music in general.|`|78d567ba4ef552df04b4e4bac0f97f4daa	I like Weezer They have some catchy cool tunes they r not my favorite band but they do not suck.|`|Vu4A83dyaa	They are a fun and energetic band, if you don't like them just keep your comments to yourself.    It's funny, cause I'm listening to them right now|`|XDvOwLlNaa	YOU have no talent.

5yDnw2oRaa	The tears will stop when they stop, she will have known how much you love her. It takes as long as it takes. Everyone is different and grief doesn't affect people in the same way, it won't hurt as much in time. Think of all the happy times you had with this person. Think about making a scrapbook or memory box of this person. Keep something near to you that reminds you of the person that makes you smile. My grandad used to grow amazing champion chrysanthemums (the huge pompom ones) since he died I always have a bunch of chrysanths in my house and i always smile when i look at them. I'm sorry for your loss x x x x|`|nFakIvgoaa	My brother died a year ago and while I guess it is a little easier to cope now, I don't believe that you ever get over losing someone close to you.|`|Hs011wnraa	It's up to you, my dad died two years ago and I know I will never get over it, but I had to be strong to help my mum|`|wmBK9uASaa	Not long,,the memories however never go|`|la9zji2Uaa	I don't think you ever get over it. It just gets easier to live with. You will think of them everyday but now when you think of them it will upset you, in time you will think of them and maybe have a little smile at their memory. There are no set rules for these kind of things - you grieve until you stop grieving. Your heart will tell you when you are ready.<br>  x

What do you call a man in the water with no arms or legs?  Bob!    Did you know the very first case of PMS is documented in the Bible?   Yes, it's the night Mary rode Joseph's A S S all the way to Bethlehem.    A shopper in a sporting goods store laid a fishing rod on the counter where a blind clerk feels the rod & says 'That will be $25 for the fishing rod'. The shopper accidently drops their bank card on the floor & the clerk says, 'Will that be credit or debit'. The shopper says credit & bends down to pickup the card & rips a loud stinky fart. The clerk says 'That will be another $12 for the duck call & the catfish bait'    Little LaShonda told her mama she wanted a bike for Christmas. Her mama said, you'll have to ask Santa but don't count on it cuz times are tough right now, even for Santa.LaShonda sent her letter to Santa but when Christmas came she didn't get her bike. She told her mama she liked her gifts but still wanted a bike & asked if she could get one for her birthday. Her mama said, times are still tough but maybe if you pray to God every day, you might get one. So Little LaShonda did just that but when her birthday came, she got no bike. She told her mama she liked her B-day gift but still wanted a bike so her mama told her 'times are tough & you have to be tough so you'll have to figure out a way to get it yourself.' Little LaShonda walked out of the house, thinking intently & as she approached her church she thought of a way to get her bike. She ran into the church, grabbed a statue of the Virgin Mary & ran home to her bed side. Kneeling beside her bed, she prayed...DEAR GOD, YOU KNOW WHO THIS IS. I GOT YO MAMA. IF YOU WANT TO SEE HER AGAIN, SEND THE BIKE. AMEN|`|E2yEOzmKaa	What do you call a fish without an eye?    A fsh

I saw HSM at my friends house when it came out and fell asleep.    So for me it would be   1) Twilight  2)Harry Potter  3)HMS   that's my opinion though.|`|OvFGeZ88aa	I think twilight.  Because many ppl have read the books and they will get entertained.  Some ppl didn't even read the books and loved it.  Harry Potter is a great series of movies but the books made me bored.  I like to see action.  Im gonna say twilight.  And for HSM.  Its for little girls.  =)  No offense to ppl who like it.|`|Yh7GOkZHaa	twlight is awesome  HSM i dont care for at all  Harry potter is cool|`|579qP9JKaa	That's a tough one!  I'm going to have to go with Twilight, which happens to be my personal favorite.  I think that the book itself has a much wider fan base than HP and HSM.  I think it also reaches a much larger age group than HP or HSM.  Think about it people a young as 10, 11, and 12 years old to adults well into their 50's or older are reading the Twilight series.  And more likely then not, these people who are fans of the book are going to see the movie.  And if their anything like me, they're going to go see it again and again and again and again.  Can't wait till the next installment|`|uIV18XoXaa	I'd said Twilight because the story is great even if the movie was less good, but it's still  good movie,  for Harry Potter there are too many movies, and people will not go see every movie, 7 movies and Twilight only 4 .  and High School Musical is too naive.|`|nqskHWCZaa	I think it is definatly harry potter because it appeals to a much larger audience, young kids, teenagers, parents etc, and has a massive fan base. Twilight would be the second because it has such a huge fanbase and is awsome, and HMS come no where near to them, because isn't all that good. Personally, i adore harry potter and twilight

It served as America's introduction to the "total warfare" of the rest of the Civil War. Until Grant's advance down the Tennessee River, engagements in the Civil War had been relatively small.     Antietam September 17, 1862   Bloodiest day of the Civil War, this battle gave Abraham Lincoln the perceived victory he desire to release the Emancipation Proclamation.

I have met the following named children:<br>  Sweetwater Brown<br>  Bittercreek Brown<br>  Heavenly Hamm<br>  Happy Laughlin<br>  but what took the cake for me had to be poor little Mercedes.

XlhBBZPxaa	hmmm teenagers are usually around 13-17 then 18- over is adulthood|`|4kuWOZowaa	Teens are dumb and easily influenced<br>  Young adults know right from wrong but are still influenced<br>  <br>  But they both have in common that they make bad decisions. Correct|`|Vp1Wzu07aa	My opinion...a teen is anyone 13 to 17. A young adult is anyone 18 thru 24.|`|AA11729534	Young adults - 18-21<br>  Teens 13-17<br>  <br>  Because 18 is legally an adult in most states in this country (U.S.)|`|wECDOlfyaa	i hate when an older adult, or younger adult think a younger person[say teens] are dumber then them. seriously i bet i could beat any of them in an IQ test stop looking at me as if im still watching arthur  =/ <br>  sorry for the rant.<br>  i think they are mostly the same. especially older teens 15-18 and 18-23 yr olds. only difference is they can do more, as in drive, drink etc. not that we cannnnttt or anything ;] were just not alloweddd..|`|M1OceGNLaa	Young adults seem to possess a little more maturity than teenagers. I don't think there are any real age boundaries; I think you become a young adult when you make your first real adult decision.|`|FZz11XB4aa	5 years, otherwise no difference.|`|4H5auUkYaa	think teens are up to 18 . . then young adult is 18 to 21 not sure lol|`|VfA96qyOaa	young adults<br>  <br>  16-35<br>  <br>  teans 12-15|`|2xaVpnNNaa	a young adult is from 18 until maybe around mid 20s....<br>  <br>  a teen is until 18...but some still prefer to be called a teen til at least 20....depends on the person.|`|YW74O9aNaa	they are not same ... <br>  teens who are 13-15 are really "older kids" ;) <br>  and teens 16 to 19 are "young adults"<br>  <br>  but these titles differ depending on the individual in consideration too!

6F9M1OGjaa	It's shattered, another name they use is butterfly on a wheel|`|aX00eUSKaa	Funny Games, but you got the end wrong.|`|bTLwhwR3aa	Omg.. wait..<br>  that sounds like Cellular..<br>  <br>  and does the lady put wires togehter and fixes a broken cell phone, and calls for help?<br>  <br>  sorry, i think it was 2006<br>  ok nevermind.. im probely wrong|`|ab250551cde4aadbf54a0fea8a7b14e1aa	Butterfly on a Wheel (2007)<br>   In Chicago, the family man and executive of an advertisement agency Neil Randall has a perfect life: he expects to be promoted in his job soon; he has a beautiful and sexy wife, Abby, and a lovely daughter, Sophie, and he lives in a great house. When Neil's boss invites him to spend the weekend at his cottage in the country, Abby hires a nanny for Sophie so she, the mom, can spend the day with her sister, Diane. While driving Abby in his truck to meet Diane, a stranger (hidden on the backseat) appears with a gun, and tells the couple that he has kidnapped Sophie. He introduces himself as Ryan and demands that for twenty-four hours, the couple shall obey his orders, otherwise, he will kill Sophie. While keeping the couple under his total control, he shows that he is a calculating sociopath with nothing to lose, with the intention of destroying Neil's perfect life. IT TURNS OUT THAT ABBY (the wife) PLANNED IT ALL. It stars Pierce Brosnan as the kidnapper, Maria Bello as the revengeful wife, and Gerard Butler as the two-timing husband.|`|KZdx48HYaa	Are you thinking of Derailed maybe? With Jennifer Aniston? The ending is a little different and some of the details but Jennifer Aniston turns out to be in on it with one of the kidnappers.|`|f6fCixDnaa	Along came a spider is like that.<br>  <br>  Son kidnapped, his tutor and detective work together to find him..but you find out the tutor was in on it all along...<br>  <br>  its not that new though?|`|56bNLJykaa	Eh, it could be Funny Games.. but in that the whole family is kept hostage, not just the son- and they are not really kidnapped, just held hostage in their own vacation home. Also different ending (which I wont spoil), so maybe not<br>  <br>  The original Funny Games came out a bit ago.. They recently made a new American version (which I didnt bother seeing) that came out last year- so it may be worth checking out.

d0cea91fb2ce932e341df1dd8e12e0b9aa	She's just overwhelmed and her way of handling the stress, the kids, the camera crew, and everything else is by being in control.  I think if she's unable to be in control, she'll really lose it.  Did you see the one when they were flying to Utah, and she was unable to cope on the plane because of the delay?  Boy, did she come unglued.  I think Jon is the only one that can handle her because he really does love her.|`|CRAklVJKaa	Okay first of all, I am so sick and tired of people picking on her. She has 8 kids, all multiples. You HAVE to be strict, think ahead, and such in order to have control over that many kids.<br>  <br>  She does not ever say she's better than everyone else, and it's ridiculous that you'd even put such words in her mouth.<br>  <br>  And Jon is just as mean to her, but they're mean in a loving way, not in an abusive way. If it was your friends or you and your s.o. doing that you'd think nothing of it, but because she's on TV people like you have the audacity to judge her.<br>  <br>  Get over it.

Why did she even have them? They get so much help from fans, too. They send them tons of free stuff.<br>  <br>  I'm surprised Jon hasn't divorced her; she's so damn bossy and arrogant.|`|V9pAr6Ysaa	sometimes she can be annoying, like when she's bossing Jon around, other times she's pretty funny|`|5e9Fjbm8aa	extremely annoying. you are right.

RdRsQsiQaa	My step sister gets all those tween magazines. She like, worships them lol.  I guess you should go for J-14.  My sis pretty much prefers that one the most.|`|cesTfRKPaa	When i was younger my mother bought me a subsription to J-14. But i dont know about the other two i have never heard of them.|`|4JcgIuBqaa	Kimberly,  All 3 of these publications are owned by major corporations and do very well with the teen/tween set.  But if you're going to buy one, you better have some pretty deep pockets because they will not come cheaply.  "M" is owned by the London Free Press.  J-14 is owned by InTouchWeekly  Twist is owned by Bauer Publishing  Each magazine has a global readership and is worth millions of dollars so before deciding which one to go after, I suggest that you do your homework and figure out which one you could potentially make a bid for based on profitability and whether the the current owners have shown any signs of wanting out.  Otherwise you might be in for a fight that you can't win.
3YIjKQTEaa	the only place you can watch it on TV in the UK is on Sky Movies.    Sucks because I also like to watch them but don't have sky movies. It means I have to go some where at stupid o'clock in the morning to watch them.|`|XmD61yBpaa	ITV 3
P4Jc76GPaa	Yes it's a love song. Basically who wants to live forever is about why would you want to have heartbreak over and over again. Hope this helps.|`|AA11577233	"Who Wants To Live Forever" is from the movie Highlander. In it, the main character, Conner McCloud, is an immortal man.    It is a love song, but it is also a song about grief, about how Conner must live while those he loves die either by growing old or being being killed because of him.

If you happen to get RATM to play at your party, then I demand to be invited lol.    EDIT: Matt, i am jealous, I have been waiting for so long for RATM to have a show nearby.|`|rpSP0qrQaa	I saw RATM at Reading :)  Got forward of the crush barrier and was in right in the middle. Best 2 hours of live music ever, ever.    Anyway, even if you do have quite a bit of $$$ I think you'll still have to settle with a local band. That doesn't mean they'll be bad - there's a huge amount of undiscovered talent out there, and who's saying the famous bands are any good anyway!?    Talk to people in your school / college.

And some things they reference in SNL is older that 14 year old, actually older than some 21 years old. I.E. this skit about a Judy blume book called Gertie. I don't think no one got it except me and few other people I know online.

Groundhog Day, The Big Lebowski and Waking Life might be the best examples of American films that are existential in nature.|`|AA11310208	Barfly

Let's say yours and Hillary Clinton's charts matched perfectly, it doesn't mean you will date. If you are really in love you will follow your heart and do want you want and do what you think is best; not act upon something the stars and a couple of charts tell you. Love is built on many things, and star charts isn't one of them. You cannot predict love so, (not to be rude), but you really shouldn't bother trying. Love will come when it comes.|`|AA11899483	http://www.adze.com/VenusFiles/    try this link its really good, it will explain the aspects between your charts.

Why not ? have some fun and be glamorous ! and enjoy yourself.|`|0rpN2419aa	You might ask him.  Unless you know that the concert is formal, wear semi formal.  Find a nice dress that flatters you figure, and is the color that looks good on you and a nice pair of heels.  Same with formal, except a long dress.  If you wear a two piece outfit, make sure the colors blend nicely.  Big prints are out for either semi formal or formal.  How great that your son invited you to go with him!  You have every reason in the world to be a proud mom!
MoKUZuQraa	Try looking at Peak music stands. They're very adjustable and relatively inexspensive. I play the saxophone and their stands work exellent for me.|`|tEeiau1paa	Do you mean a strand to hold music on, or a stand to hold your sax?  If it's to hold your sax then I have a Hercules one and you can put other parts on if you play alto and tenor for example.  If it's for music, then any stand is fine, you can get them from your local music shop if you have one. But try the height out first!

xD8KEjSfaa	"HHC: Having defined Toronto as the Screw Face capital, how do you feel about being active and working in the Screw Face scene?<br>  Man that terminology has just exploded in Toronto! I give mad credit to Arcee, Grimace Love and Marvel for documenting what happens to out of town emcees when they do a half *** show in the Screwface. It gets ugly like Sugar Jones… trust me. I love the Screwface Capital because I know from experience that rocking a live show here is a necessity for survival. You have to step into the audience's shoes and realize that they've seen everything and heard even more than that. Coming with originality and disgusting lyrics is a must if you wish to excel on the mic. You really can't understand the level of indifference and screwfacedeness if you're not from here. "

Producers and writers, it's all up to NBC on how they want to do this. But Fallon would sure be wasting the writers' talent if they stay. And Conan would half of what he is without his writers as from what we've seen from the writers strike.

2QuGuphYaa	There are a few steps to the process.<br>  <br>  First you need to download a subtitle file reader, I use Vob-Sub which seems to be the best (small file only about 2 Mb).  You can do that here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.free-codecs.com/download/vobsub.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.free-codecs.com/download/vobs...</a><br>  <br>  Then you need to find the subtitle on one of numerous subtitle websites such as:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.divxsubtitles.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.divxsubtitles.net/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.opensubtitles.org/en" rel="nofollow">http://www.opensubtitles.org/en</a><br>  <br>  Find the file and the language you want the subtitle in and download the file.  You will almost certainly need winRar to extract the file in case you don't have it already.  <br>  <br>  Then the subtitle file must be in the same folder as the movie file AND HAVE THE SAME NAME.  So you may need to rename either of the files so that they have the matching file name.<br>  <br>  Now once you open the file, (VobSub will automaticaly start so you dont need to open the program) the subtitles will be at the bottom of the screen.<br>  <br>  One note:  There are MANY subtitle files for the same movies or TV shows so you might end up having to download a few to get the right one that matches the speed with the audio.  Once you do this a few times you will get the hang of it quickly and it's pretty simple.  The process may sound like a lot but it's not.|`|IHC5F8RDaa	www.downloadfreehindimovies.blogspot.com|`|ewnRaH8Faa	Get vob-sub for urself<br>  and than go here-> <a href="http://www.divxsubtitles.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.divxsubtitles.net/</a><br>  and get what ever language u want the subtitles in<br>  <br>  and than combine them easily

The cycle is a never ending and a never begining if you think about it. The only what we can every firgure it out is making a time portal. The chicken is if you think evolution came and egg if creation(god,zeus,ect). Or was it the other way around?

1JcGyuAraa	i love writing songs too. i can only do it well, though, when i'm either suddenly in a really creative mood, or i'm just really depressed. when i'm depressed, i just write out whats in my mind, just make it have more rhythm and other things having to do with a song. A really good way to look at it basically is just write down whatever's on your mind, and just twist it to make it sound more like a song. hope this helps!|`|sc4BtGxGaa	Do not try to *write lyrics*.  Speak from your heart.  Do not be concerned about meter or rhyme - that can be tailored later IF you choose to.  In country and folk music, FAR more than many other genres, it is the sincerity of the content that matters.  Consider rap music - the percussion of the words, coupled with the aggression of the message, is what matters.  In classical music, the *bel canto* - the pure beauty fo the SOUND - is what matters - the words are often subservient to the melody, and the PLOTS?? - well, they are unbelievable. <br>  <br>  It is far easier for most people to write the melody and harmony AFTER they write the words - so that is how I would begin.  In these hard times, I am sure that you will not lack for inspiration - there are people who in all innocence have been victimized, or have been lied to, bedazzled by greed, seen their life's saving and family trust evaporate - or, to take the OTHER side - are angry that our grandchildren are going to be paying for the greed and avarice of OTHERS.   There are people who pay all their bills - and every other house on their street is in foreclosure, so THEIR property is now worth so my much less!  COUNTLESS topics now that move people - and I hope they move us towards being better *people*.  We need YOU to write some about this!!  Think of how Woody got us thru the Great Depression - now it is YOUR turn. Do good work - we're listening.

Ow3O7h4caa	If you want to get the Aquarian's attention, you'll need to intellectually stimulate them.  They can accept criticism and understand others' perceptions about things. If you have a problem, they'll listen, though after awhile, enough is enough. You don't have to go out of your way to impress them. Just about anything pleases them. From sharing a picnic lunch to a candle lit dinner, Chinese or Mexican, it doesn't matter, as long as variety is on the menu.|`|PCAlAoDsaa	Go to a nice restaurant and have a romantic candlelit dinner. After that go for a walk on along the beach and look at the stars.|`|fXUlPjSIaa	Somewhere different. Like a museum or an Indian restaurant. Just take them somewhere that is different and unique, but would appeal to their general interests. Even a nice Jazz cafe and a walk around town is nice.

BkQ3BtaDaa	Interesting question. The answer might not be as obvious as saying "The Witches". Although it is them that set the chain of events that led to Macbeth and Lady Macbeth causing all the death and destruction, it was their own cruelty, greed and lack of conscience  that led them to their actions.<br>  <br>  If Macbeth was strong and wise like Banquo, he'd have seen much earlier the equivocation of the devil. He could have, like Banquo, completely disregarded them and lived on his honorably life as a worthy soldier and Thane of King Duncan.

wc5nm7MTaa	1) I would say Buck is more underrated.  He is rarely mentioned among the greatest and he should be. BOC seems to to be starting to get some of the credit they deserve in some circles and Buck is probably the reason for that.  2) I think Buck is better as far as imbuing notes with passion and writing though Lifeson probably has higher technical skill.....  3)BOC is one of my favorite bands of all time.  Rush is good but not on par with them in my mind.      Also, I met BOC after a show many, many years ago and they are great guys|`|Z5mmaFK0aa	Hey Night    Yeah they are both greats that's for sure. I agree that both are very underrated.    I think both are kind of =ly UNDERRATED (lol sorry kinda just woke up lol) but I would say Buck is much more underrated. Even when I was a kid and just starting to play guitar players would discuss Alex much more than Buck. I cant even recall the last time I discussed Buck.    I would say there really isn't a better player but on a level of taste and technique the better player would probably be Alex    Rush but I LOVE BOTH|`|gDxMoBl9aa	1 Alex Lifeson  2 Buck Dharma  3 Rush, but that's My  6 Band up against My  8|`|78d567ba4ef552df04b4e4bac0f97f4daa	I think Alex Gets More Credit But is still underrated but not like buck dharma his name never comes up although it should.

Rush is my favorite band,so I choose Rush!|`|ba7bcd7412bbd21d6d0242a98604dfb6aa	1 - Buck Dharma  2 - I'd have to call that one even...both are really good players  3 - just from the standpoint of commercial success, Rush wins, but I saw BOC last fall, and they were awesome, but it is just Buck & Bloom left, whereas Rush is still operating with the same three members since 1975|`|kP0JGI1waa	1. considering i didnt recognize the name buck dharma until you said blue oyster cult, i will have to go with dharma.    2. i have only heard a few boc songs so i will have to go with alex lifeson, he puts out some really good guitar parts, even though he often plays a secondary role to Peart and Lee.    3. Rush, I like boc (at least i have liked every song i have heard from them), but I really enjoy rush, they are a nice blend of catchiness and progressiveness.

I think they showed people and their "Issues" without Passing Judgment on them.    NOT - because the Story "supported" what these people did -- It left it up to You.    A very good Indie-Film Effort IMO  .|`|wHmgVhphaa	I don't appreciate that it made the sexual abuse of a child entertainment.  There is no artistic license for the corruption of children.  The overly sexualized child in the film was incredibly disturbing, as was the pedophile father.      I'm sure I'm saying nothing new, but there's a reason for that.  Normal people don't sympathize with child molesters.  I could find sympathy for a NON-PRACTICING pedophile, but not a person who uses children for sexual gratification.|`|zT2cmrIKaa	Pure genius.
8KbcQGL0aa	This was quite a few episodes back when Brainiac infected Chloe's mind. The 69 Chevy fan is right. Technically it wasn't "entirely" Chloe. Brainiac's influence gave her violent tendencies, but her compassion for Clark was all her and she would do anything to protect him. BTW Smallville is my favorite show.|`|1hS27eJuaa	Yes she did kill someone to protect clark, it was a while back as for the answer above she brainiac was in her, but she killed the guy not him. it was all her.|`|XBGaYJ2waa	Yes, but she's under the influence of Brainiac so it wasn't technically Chloe.<br>  <br>  Good question
CH05taCaaa	The editing is driving me crazy, and I have waited all season for DeAnna to come back!!  He definitely proposed to a dark haired girl at the finale.  All signs online point to Melissa being the final one, but I think it could very well also be DeAnna....although, Melissa does seem a little "woe is me" and with her family not wanting to meet him plays right into that.  I do think that Jason wants a girl who's life will revolve around him, and she fits the bill.    I agree that DeAnna is coming back in New Zealand....I hope she sticks around!|`|e4259abb4e5d0ea5a734423f5be756f9aa	I think crazy Shannon was referring to watching The Bachelorette - when Deanna broke Jason's heart.    Since the hometown dates are next week I think Deanna comes back when they're in New Zealand for the final.    The editing makes it look like all the girls are around when Jason goes on the balcony.    That is my take on it anyway.
JtXuvZLzaa	The Matrix.  Are you saying that the guy boxes a gang that has lots of pistols and machine guns.  Or are you saying that he fights them and he has lots of pistols and machine guns.  And when you say he dies at the end, does that mean he dies cause he was shot or he dies of something else.  Another possibility is Last Man Standing with Bruce Willis.|`|56mYVHTyaa	Is it The Transporter?

But then again, life needs to be care-free, so whatever you want to do is good.|`|CArzkDIUaa	no way it's too early!|`|rDsKB0uXaa	Go to bed right now put a alarm for 2 o clock|`|k6M48eUMaa	If you're sleepy, you should deffo get some rest :)|`|nO2vflnPaa	Mom said get to bed now!
kK4GG6Z2aa	OK magazine.  I like Katie, she's a very sassy and clever lady.  People often criticise her...but whose the joke on.  She's laughing all the way to the bank.  She's gone through some tough time - but always gets through it.  Her devotion to her children especially Harvey is a credit to motherhood.  I admire her for who she is as a person rather than what she does in the public eye.|`|l9ab36z4aa	why do you like her?|`|Hs011wnraa	Ok Magazine
50UbJp14aa	my parents and my brother and sisters mostly|`|mZUXkeyRaa	I love lots of celebs  But Amanda Bynes is my real role model!  She has been acting since she was little  And she hasn't done 1 thing wrong!  I love her funny personality  I love all of her movies & TV shows  I love her clothing line  She is just soo awesome!!  =)|`|o2FJIXS9aa	Tyra Banks. I think she would have been successful at anything she put her mind to. She's positive, she's interested in others and she wants to make a difference. I know she has some tiny faults like being too much into herself, but better that than being down on yourself.|`|JmdnlQsHaa	peter andre    cos even he said he'd prob get fed up with katie price and divorce her eventually|`|UiqRVbRGaa	kareena kapoor|`|capCtdkeaa	probably greg the veg from masterchef|`|7i6qj4OXaa	I don't need one and never have done.

I'm just REALLY disappointed she's somewhat involved with one of those Jonas brothers & Rob from Twilight.    She could do better.|`|qjMTDv1Vaa	Paris Hilton.    I find her funny and wasnt really sure until i met her at a GC gig when she was with benji. Really nice down to earth, clever too!|`|qSwaXLBeaa	Cheryl Cole.    Basically because she proves that if you set your mind to do something, you'll get there. She had nothing and grew up in Newcastle yet she is a member of the most successful girl band in the world. She also seems very laid back and someone you can have a laugh with, not one of those Mariah Careys who acts like a total diva (although I do like her music). She is also hilarious. In 'Ghost Hunting with Girls Aloud' she was like 'Ffs if there's a ghost in this sodden room will you f*kin tell us in some way' *BANG* 'Ahhhhhhhhh fu*k!' Hahaha, she's amazing. She is such a great role model and I really look up to her.|`|Rk6lqCuXaa	Dakota Fanning.  She is rad.|`|f7GGTNjVaa	Cheryl Cole :)  ii really look up to her because she's an inspiration and she's just like everybody else! shes achieved so much, shes real and hasnt let fame go to her head. And she has a real caring side and shes not afraid to show it! she the best one in girls aloud;)  and ii love her accent!  ohh and shes really beautiful!|`|ECWIphqjaa	Leonardo dicaprio.   He has worked on some of the most amazing films ever created. And he is a global campaigner to raise awareness for the environment. He has donated money to victims of natural disasters in America and given lots of money to orphanages in africa. For me he is the best possible role model|`|dqqtmhdnaa	Keira Knightley :)|`|8ku6ox0Taa	Demi Lovato , the Jonas Brothers , Michelle Obama and The Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders|`|Mfy5gd77aa	katie price??? wtf? you want everyone to see your vagina then pretend you know how to raise kids!!???    my role model is bill bailey cus he's really tallanted musically and also funny as hell.

NGNeT3rYaa	Surviving the fire was the easy part. This isn't over," Agent Rayner tells Sam as he finds her standing in front of what used to be General Hospital. He demands answers as to where the missing sphere went and Sam says that she saw it burn. He asks if Anthony Zacchara burnt too and Sam points out that the building is a burnt-out shell! He takes a hard line with her and says that Spinelli could still spend his life in prison if Zacchara isn't found. As he berates Sam for her friend Jason not delivering the goods, Alexis interrupts and gets in his face for speaking to her client without her attorney.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Alexis pulls Sam away and tells her how worried she was about her. Sam says that she was only really in danger at the end, but she was so worried about Spinelli that she didn't think about herself. Alexis warns her to be careful where he's concerned because this is Federal case. Sam shakes it off, but Alexis makes it very clear that there isn't parole in Federal cases and she wouldn't be able to help her if she gets in trouble.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Maxie is the first thing Spinelli sees when he opens his eyes in his regrettably pink room. She tells him that she's going to take care of him and that includes eating things other than orange soda and barbeque chips. Then she says that they need to talk about the future of their relationship. Spinelli is curious what she means. Maxie points out that he's not Jason and clarifies that he's not allowed to risk his life anymore. She says that she needs him and he needs to take care of himself. As she proceeds to fluff his pillows, she is called into Crimson.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Lulu and Johnny are starting a new day over at their place, too. Lulu wants to forget the argument they had before the fire, but Johnny doesn't think they should. He says that his past won't let them go forward no matter how much he'd like to. Lulu wants to live in the present and love each other. Before he can answer, she is called into Crimson.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Jax finds Carly at The Metro Court and compliments her for looking beautiful the day after a crisis. He asks how she slept and she tells him that she wishes he had been lying next to her. She assumes that now that the crisis is over their cold hard reality has come back. He is quick to tell her that he wants to wake up with her every morning for the rest of his life. As they start to kiss, Edward interrupts them to talk about contributing to a fund to rebuild the hospital.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Jax quickly dumps Edward with Carly and goes to Olivia for help. He tells her that his first priority is to spend time with his wife and that he needs her to charm Edward and offer his financial support. Happy to help, Olivia whisks Edward away.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Over at Sonny's house, Milo is telling Max to stop leaving his things lying around. Max looks at the DVD in his hands and says it's not his. Claudia comes downstairs and says that it's hers. She tells him that there's another one just like it around somewhere and asks them to keep their eyes out for it. When Milo asks what's on them, Claudia asks if they ever did anything impulsive that they regret? Milo says that he hasn't, but Max jokingly reminds him of his stint as Mr. Adonis 2002.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Later, Claudia beckons Johnny over to show him Jerry's newest DVD. The clue is that the next DVD is in a room that's near to Sonny's heart. Johnny can't believe that she's right back where she started, but Claudia assures him that she and Sonny are finally on the same page. Johnny says that this will explode and ruin both of their lives because he can't bear to break up with Lulu even though he knows he should. After he's gone, Claudia goes upstairs to check out Michael's old room for the DVD, and Kate slips into the terrace door to snoop around.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Max and Milo are plotting something at The Metro Court restaurant, but Diane arrives and Milo scurries off. When Diane sits with Max and starts to plan a romantic evening, Milo appears and asks if she's considered switching to a more heart healthy lifestyle. He suggests Campbell's soups and a less stressful lifestyle. "Your heart, your health, it's never too soon to start looking after both," Milo says as he pulls out a jar of Prego and offers to ask the chef to put it on her penne. Diane points out how well rehearsed he sounds, but agrees. When the food arrives, she admits it's delicious but she didn't need Max to set her up. Max points out that she has family history of heart disease and she needs to get regular check ups and let her boyfriend pamper her. Finally Diane gives in and they share a saucy kiss.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Maxie and Lulu are at Crimson frantically trying to cover their butts. It has come to their attention that they were too distracted lately to make arrangements for Crimson to have a presence because at the Campbell's Red Dress Fashion show in Manhattan. The dress has already been designed, and they need tickets and a model! They hope that Kate's|`|QAIc4VVPaa	well the wise one is ok and the guy from the fbi or what ever is hunting him down. that girl whoever she is said that if nicolas did not back down she would get him for stalking her. the hospital is burned down now and they will now rebuild it. patrick is talking to his wife and asking her what happened she is back to being overwelmed by the baby. they are going to go in and find out who did not make the explosion and fire. tracy and her step daughter is talking. no luke or other boy. they atre working out of another hospital.

PCAlAoDsaa	Sagittarius is the most enthusiastic zodiac sign.|`|qg11igznaa	Sagittarius, too enthusiastic often times. Gemini can be, but you have  to catch them in the right mood.

Sagittarius is, Gemini usually is, sometimes Leo is, but Leo prefers to lounge around in attention looking good, like the lions they are. I would probably say Sagittarius. They're pretty outgoing and adventuresome.

I only like music from the 50's, and  the 80's in English, and from the 60's and 70's in Spanish. I like Spanish romantic music such as "boleros" very very much, and I don't like Reggaeton at all.

bSxEfkZQaa	Davey Havok keeps his personal life very private. He has never (for what I know) publicly talked about his relationship. Therefore, what we know is from pictures we have seen and we can only assume.     Most think that his current girlfriend is Britany Bowen, though some think she is just a good friend. Again, there have been pictures of them back in about 2002/2003 and more recent ones of them together.     But unless Davey tells us, we can't know for sure.    I can tell you for sure though that he is no longer dating Ivy or Monica.|`|HkIatVdiaa	Not that it is ANY of our business;    but Davey is going out with a girl named Brittany Bowen.

Back In Black has one little lick on the snare/hi-hat that would be a little tough at your stage but Highway to Hell is very easy.

4fca82268fb53ac14ab31b22c0bd8220aa	Definitely Maybe with Ryan Reynolds|`|ZyGyDLsDaa	Definitely, Maybe (2008)<br>  starring Ryan Reynolds, Abigail Breslin, Rachel Weisz, Isla Fisher, Kevin Kline, Elizabeth Banks, Nestor Serrano<br>  IMDb synopsis:<br>  Romantic comedy: Will Hayes, a 30-something Manhattan dad is in the midst of a divorce when his 10 year old daughter, Maya, starts to question him about his life before marriage. Maya wants to know absolutely everything about how her parents met and fell in love. Will's story begins in 1992, as a young, starry-eyed aspiring politician who moves to New York from Wisconsin in order to work on the Clinton campaign. For Maya, Will relives his past as a idealistic young man learning the ins and outs of big city politics, and recounts the history of his romantic relationships with three very different women. On the campaign, Will's best buddy is Russell McCormack. They not only have similar political aspirations, they share the same type of girl problems, too. Will hopelessly attempts a "PG" version of his story for his daughter ad changes the names so Maya has to guess who he finally married. Is her mother Will's college sweetheart, the dependable girl next-door Emily? Is she his longtime best friend and confidante, he apolitical April? Or is she the free-spirited but ambitious journalist? As Maya puts together the pieces of her dad's romantic puzzle, she begins to understand that love is not so simple or easy. And as Will tells her his tale, Maya helps him to understand that it's definitely never too late to go back~and maybe even possible to find a happy ending.<br>  Here's the movie trailer:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfUwvTvzrg8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfUwvTvzr...</a>|`|15bfbee9158c1901c31e1158ebf6bd03aa	Its Definitely, Maybe.
