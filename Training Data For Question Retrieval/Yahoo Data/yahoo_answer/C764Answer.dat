Mullins, the first cookbook mentioning doughnuts was an 1803 English volume which included doughnuts in an appendix of American recipes. By the mid-19th century the doughnut looked and tasted like today’s doughnut and was viewed as a thoroughly American food.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doughnut#cite_note-2" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doughnut#ci...</a><br>  <br>  Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat asserts in her History of Food, "the Chinese may be credited with inventing a device to make sorbets and ice cream. They poured a mixture of snow and saltpetre over the exteriors of containers filled with syrup, for, in the same way as salt raises the boiling-point of water, it lowers the freezing-point to below zero."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_cream" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_cream</a>|`|Scupj6XVaa	I dont know but whoever invented them should have been given some kind of huge reward...  i love donuts... especially sour cream fry cakes|`|rYNM67oyaa	Ice cream a long time ago.

kMK9E2a7aa	I lost over 30 lbs by eating more vegetables, but I'm not a vegetarian. I live in a country which has the healthiest diet in Europe, but I still eat meat within a balanced diet. I actually adore vegetables and have since I was a baby, but I can't live on just that.|`|2RzEaod9aa	I am a vegan, so my list of things I can't eat:<br>  Meat<br>  Dairy<br>  Eggs<br>  Honey<br>  <br>  However, being healthy involves much more than just cutting food out of your diet. I didn't lose any weight for a couple months after becoming vegan because of the foods I chose to eat and the type of exercise I did. I increased my exercise and changed up my foods and began dropping fat while increasing strength and muscle size. <br>  <br>  <br>  There's no magic trick or diet to lose weight and be healthy. No matter what you chose, it's always what you eat, when you eat, and how you exercise.|`|64554a8e1157e502654f643d0ffe309baa	Yes, I lost quite a bit of weight since becoming a vegan. <br>  <br>  I don't eat any meat or dairy products. I don't eat junk food or much processed food. I try to eat primarily raw food.|`|XNo8YGyfaa	Yeah<br>  <br>  I'm not a proper vegetarian tho cause i eat sweets.|`|uS0wlcmtaa	I have lost about 10 pounds since becoming a vegetarian six months ago. <br>  <br>  It is possible to gain weight as a vegetarian though if you eat a lot of fried foods and high sugar foods. <br>  <br>  Just like non-vegetarians you need to watch what you eat, make sure it's nutritious, has enough protein and is the right portion. Fortunately a larger portion of many healthy vegetarian dishes have less calories than some smaller meat dishes.|`|n2KAb9wzaa	I have been a vegetarian for almost two years now.<br>  I'm 16 next month I have lost about 10 pounds.<br>  Like everyone has said i feel refreshed like a new person.<br>  Me personally not that crazy about vegetables ha ha I know crazy..<br>  Vegetarian your sapost to like them but no..

No meat or dairy. And on the weekends i have chicken / meat, but only a small amount. Like on a salad or something. <br>  <br>  I changed nothing else other than eating, i dont exercise more or anything, actually i do it less as it is winter.|`|Vbdfphhbaa	not necessarily vegan...I eat a balanced diet of fruits and vegetables, meats are eaten in small portions and if possible only once a day,or none. I did have more fish and chicken,turkey in my diet. no cookies,no junk food. I avoided sodas and any fruit juice cocktails etc. drank water and club soda instead with some lemon juice instead. ate whole grains like wheat, brown rice, granola. eating most of my vegetables raw rather than cooked or steamed,helped a lot. combined with exercise I was in top shape.<br>  <br>  visit your nutritionist to discuss a list of things yu can eat and become vegan.|`|Tw7o2Uagaa	Vegetables.|`|n7BuH75gaa	Yes and I feel more light.

7at1Hyn8aa	No, Mountain Dew is not that good for you when you are sick.  The only thing in MD that will make you feel a little better, maybe, is the caffeine it contains.  <br>  What exactly do you have?<br>  If its a stomach bug, just drink water or maybe sprite/7up with some of the 'bubbles' stirred out, since they can aggravate your stomach a little.  Gatorade is also a good choice.<br>  If you are only having a headache, than the MD is okay.<br>  <br>  Plenty of water is always best.  So good luck.|`|sJlyZyOWaa	I would go with sprite or sierra mist. You don't need loads of caffeine|`|YVeZ8K6haa	No, not at all. Mountain Dew is one of the highest sugar drinks. You need to drink water or juice if you feel sick. Don't drink mountain dew it has too much sugar, and it may make you feel worse.<br>  <br>  feel better :]|`|ozWi3TJlaa	Not the greatest thing for a tummy ache.  Gingerale is often better tolerated as ginger is a classic for relieving nausea.  7up or Sprite is also tolerated fairly well.  <br>  <br>  It won't hurt you, but putting all that caffeine in your body when you don't feel well will prevent you from getting adequate rest.|`|sP98NDi5aa	I would stick to 7 up, or juices. You probably also do not want an extreme amount of caffiene in your body right now.|`|6n3TY0Xdaa	When I would have a sore throat my mom would give me ginger ale.|`|R71oR4mRaa	no! mountain dew is bad for you even when you are not sick.<br>  it has one of the most caffeine contents of any of the soft drinks and the sugar content is through the roof.

53giV6PFaa	If the crockpot was off all night then throw it away.  Warmed food should not be left out for more than 2 hours at room temp. I hate to see food go to waste, but don't risk it and throw this one away.<br>  <br>  ======================================...<br>  From the USDA website:<br>  <br>  Is it safe to eat leftover food that was left out on the counter to cool at dinnertime, then forgotten until morning? Will additional cooking kill the bacteria that may have grown?<br>  No. Bacteria exist everywhere in nature. They are in the soil, air, water, and the foods we eat. When they have nutrients (food), moisture, and favorable temperatures, they grow rapidly, increasing in numbers to the point where some types of bacteria can cause illness. Bacteria grow most rapidly in the range of temperatures between 40 and 140 °F, some doubling in number in as little as 20 minutes. Some types will produce toxins that are not destroyed by cooking.<br>  <br>  Pathogenic bacteria do not generally affect the taste, smell, or appearance of a food. In other words, one cannot tell that a food has been mishandled or is dangerous to eat. For example, food that has been left too long on the counter may be dangerous to eat, but could smell and look fine. If a food has been left in the "Danger Zone" – between 40 and 140 °F – for more than 2 hours, discard it, even though it may look and smell good. Never taste a food to see if it is spoiled.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fsis.usda.gov/help/faqs_hotli..." rel="nofollow">http://www.fsis.usda.gov/help/faqs_hotli...</a>|`|dbw210qqaa	Toss it~~~~~~~~~better be safe than sorry  =)|`|87cdabfc465780d4ded2686ecd2adb57aa	No, even cooked perishables become dangerous only a few hours after being left at room temperature.

Example: I work in customer service and laugh in my head when customers come in saying completely uneducated things. <br>  <br>  To uneducated omnivores, they think we're the uneducated ones, so they laugh at us. No big. If it's not one thing, it's another.

It just leads to a lot of macho posturing "I ain't threatened by no hippies" bull.  <br>  <br>  Second, your question implies that the left are concerned with ethics and the right are concerned with economics.  This is simply not the case.<br>  <br>  Lastly, the animosity will not stop because suddenly, the hate-mongers understand "passion."    They eventually go away on their own, because being vaguely against something will never be as powerful as being FOR something.|`|b9wICW1Paa	I agree with the other posters in that it is not really a feeling of being threatened so much as the condescending attitude displayed by the vocal minority.  Vegetarians often get de facto representation by abrasive, radical, and downright confrontational organizations like PETA and websites like VegSource.  <br>  <br>  This is unfortunate, since the majority of vegetarians I have met are quite content to live the lifestyle they have chosen and not to preach their beliefs.  They will of course share their beliefs if questioned, but will not actively seek "converts."  <br>  <br>  It is human nature to want others to feel the way we do, or to accept what we might feel is the undeniable truth.  Some vegetarians feel everyone should share their beliefs and values - same with many meat eaters.  Consciously or not, we all want the world around us to conform in some way or another.  When this doesn't happen, a healthy optimism is often replaced by frustrated disillusionment.  Such can lead to name calling, condescension, abusive behavior, and in the worst cases wishing for or attempting harm to others.  In the latter scenario only are meat eaters threatened by vegetarianism.|`|z7zKIwCcaa	TX2Step wrote: "Just do your own thing, quietly, and stop forcing your views on everyone else"<br>  <br>  This is a great example of the complete failure to understand why vegetarians eat the way they do. Listen up, people: many if not most vegetarians are motivated to eat plant-based diets because they are concerned about the SUFFERING OF ANIMALS. Sorry to shout, but this is an important point. No honest person doubts that the vast majority of meat and dairy animals in the U.S. are not treated well, and that abuse is quite common in livestock production.<br>  <br>  So if we agree that livestock animals suffer, and we agree that many vegetarians want to end this suffering, why should vegetarians "do their own thing quietly" and not speak out?<br>  <br>  If I were opposed to cruelty toward dogs or cats, should I just "quietly" let people continue to abuse dogs and cats or should I speak out and say it's wrong?<br>  <br>  I understand that omnivores don't like having a mirror held up to the consequences of their own food choices. This is essentially why they feel threatened. They would rather lash out against vegetarians than take an honest look at their own choices.|`|VdbhuUYBaa	I don't think they are. I'm certainly not. Some people are just bullies.<br>  <br>  Why would someone be threatened by a diet that effects them in no way?<br>  <br>  "Please illuminate for me- other than Hitler- any veggie terrorists or bad people..."--A.L.F.<br>  <br>  "9-11? OKC bombings? Should we now make vast generlizations about meat eating?"---neither animal nor food related as are the A.L.F. terrorist bombings.|`|AAgX0SDcaa	It is human nature not to trust anyone who is radically different from oneself. Only by detaching from oneself and understanding the differences will they be able to overcome that. As for me personally, I say good for vegetarians, they are no threat to me whats so ever, because that means more meat for me.|`|kMK9E2a7aa	People who ask rhetorical questions invariably get rhetorical answers!|`|829070aea711a47d99d908ff132df3bbaa	"Threatened"?<br>  I don't see that.<br>  I think meat eaters are just tired of being preached to.<br>  You actually answered your own question.<br>  <br>  "While I understand some might be tired of our moralizing or insinuations that we're ethically superior"<br>  That's the real answer.<br>  Meat eaters are tired of this sort of thing and not "threatened".<br>  ( Disgusted would have been a better choice).<br>  <br>  Btw, I am also an animal lover.<br>  <br>  There you go ranting again.<br>  If it's all about you, the shut up and go on your merry way.<br>  <br>  This is NOT how you educate people on the horrors of animal slaughter.<br>  All your doing is causing "ANIMOSITY", the very thing you questioned "Why the animosity"?<br>  This is exactly why!!|`|doz7RIoeaa	Actually I find it the other way around. Many vegetarians and vegans seem to need to announce their lifestyle, both here and in real life, as if looking for validation or recognition. That in the absence of either or both, their "efforts" will be pointless. Then there is the constant posting of "conspiracy theories" against the meat and dairy industry itself, If someone posts well known established and documented positive facts about meat and or dairy, it is automatically a conspiracy by the industry, There is even a question of why omnivores post here at all as if this is an exclusive forum for vegetarian and/vegans only. Tell me who is being threatened by those posts?<br>  <br>  Then there is the constant effort by many vegetarians, especially in this forum, to validate their choice, from unproven or outright false science to defective economics to videos, that seems to truly indicate which side is being threatened or feeling desperate. <br>  <br>  And lastly, PETA, who has some support here, has discussions about Yahoo!Answers -Vegetarian and Vegan in their forums and have suggested that certain users here should be supported and others "thumbed down". Again, who is acting threatened?<br>  <br>  last, judging which answers got the most negative responses (thumb down) again, isn't it yet clear who are really being threatened and who are, as one poster put it, the "hate mongers"?|`|C4TjcaUGaa	Vegetarians are different. That's why. We're different than meat eaters and they think we are all the same and we are out to get them converted to vegetarianism. <br>  <br>  But I am a veg and I don't get on people about being one. I'll mention it maybe once or twice, but it's really the persons choice. Yes, we do feel passionate. And we don't appreciate people thinking we are wrong or we are insane for the way we think. <br>  <br>  I HATE when people fight with me about being a vegetarian and animal rights activist. There's no reason to discriminate.|`|8GrguBqoaa	Trust me, the last thing I'd be "threatened" by is some guy munching on a celery stick.|`|IDBasYahaa	were not threatened by them.<br>  <br>  I'm just sick to death of having the vegetarian/vegan beliefs forced down my throat!<br>  <br>  I don't agree with vegetarians way of life, but if a vegetarian asks for a vegetarian recipe, I'm happy to oblige.<br>  <br>  But because I choose to eat meat, doesn't mean they have the right to call me a murderer & make it personal.|`|6Gfz125Paa	They feel guilty, and seeing that there are vegetarian people around serves as a reminder of what they are doing.

RCpkdx4haa	My girlfriend likes to drink what our local comedy club labeled a "skinny *****". It is one part vanilla vodka and 2 parts diet coke. When the flavors come together it really just tastes like vanilla flavored coke. Cranberry vodka and screwdrivers are also popular. For less alcohol flavor you're going to want to stick with vodka or gin, for the most part. Hope this helps!|`|hLNieq8xaa	I dont think there is such thing as a premixed drink that has no alcohol taste in it.. <br>  <br>  Put a lot of ice in it, it will help. <br>  <br>  Do you mix the drinks yourselves?

NeTNnvSZaa	I think  you're talking about the clear glaze, right?  Depending on how many donuts you want to cover, mix about 1 cup powered sugar and a small amount of flavoring (1 tsp or less), like vanilla, and a small amount of milk or water (start with 1 tsp and add more as needed).  You'll just need a small bit of liquid in the powdered sugar, it will start to melt in right away.  Just thin the consistency until it "looks" right, then glaze the cooled donuts (if you do it when they're warm the glaze won't stick, it'll soak in).|`|53giV6PFaa	There are 2 ways you can do this.

DT2mU1jOaa	Overall I support your claim that is<br>  Big Brewer = High Quality low flavor.<br>  <br>  Small Brewers = Low Quality high flavor.<br>  <br>  But things are developing all the time and many brewers make many good quality beers in the micro/craft segment. In fact, this has long been my point, it comes to taste and style preferences and that is why all brewers are good. We do still see people with a dream jump into a start-up brewery with no real knowledge or research on how to brew or run a brewing company. This is true and similar in the Culinary/Hospitality industry also. A great majority of these do not last past the first or second years.<br>  On the other hand many craft breweries are ran by professional (Boston, Anchor, New Belgium to name a few) brewers and business people. These are the ones with the best quality of beers and reasonable business approach.|`|hcJcC182aa	I'll go along with the crowd and agree. Most beer is good and it comes to what you like. So again I agree.|`|8OREBeRdaa	I actually prefer microbrewed beer over large brewery beer. I think it's because I like to support the "little businesses" in that regard. I disagree that small brewers have low quality. <br>  <br>  I think boils down to appealing to what the demand is.  Marketing can also create a demand but it takes a lot of $$$ to do that.

At any rate, it's better when made ahead (at least a day or so), so keep the fridge heavily in mind as well.<br>  <br>  (Now I want some stew!)

His boss told him, "most hot dog companies put those intestines in their hot dogs. We do not. Be glad you work here."  To this day my brother-in-law will only eat that company's hot dogs.

This is unfortunately incorrect. the mixture is GREY before they color it a more appetizing hue.<br>  The basic ingredients in hot dogs are:<br>  <br>  Meat and fat <br>  Flavorings, such as salt, garlic, and paprika <br>  Preservatives and colorants - typically sodium erythorbate and sodium nitrite <br>  In the US, if variety meats, cereal or soy fillers are used, the product name must be changed to "links" or the presence must be declared as a qualifier.<br>  <br>  Pork and beef are the traditional meats which are still widely used. Less expensive hot dogs are primarily chicken or turkey, due to the low cost of mechanically separated poultry. Hot dogs have high sodium, fat and nitrite content, which have been linked to health problems in some consumers. In recent years, due to changing dietary preferences, manufacturers have turned to turkey, chicken, or vegetarian meat substitutes, and have begun lowering salt content.|`|829070aea711a47d99d908ff132df3bbaa	The meat is clean.<br>  But they are made with jowel, lips and cheek meat( no innards like many believe).<br>  With the natural casing hot dogs( the best) the only innard is the casing, which is an lamb intestine( like a sausage casing).|`|OIS808Qmaa	Most hot dogs actually are made of pretty yucky leftovers...

Vatrushka is a savoury open tart with cottage cheese. It's a very common Ukrainian national snack. <br>  200g of butter<br>  200g + 1 tbsp of sour cream<br>  3 glasses of flour<br>  1 tsp of salt<br>  200g of cottage cheese<br>  2 eggs<br>  <br>  <br>  Chop the butter together with flour, in order to get something like buttery grains. Pour the salted sour cream into it. Quickly knead the dough, and put it for 10 or 15 minutes in refridgerator. <br>  <br>  Make the filling. Mix the cottage cheese, 1 tbsp of sour cream, an egg, and add some salt. <br>  <br>  When the dough is chilled, roll it out. Separate round flat shapes out of it with some circular form. Put the filling onto each of the flans, thicken the edges of the flans, leave the center open. Brush each vatrushka with egg and put into the hot oven. When the dough is baked, and has slightly reddish colour, get them out of the oven. <br>  <br>  Vatrushkas are often served with borsch. <br>  <br>  <br>     <br>  Ukrainian Borshch (cabbage, beetroot & tomato soup)<br>  When talking about Ukrainian cuisine, the borshch is the first dish to mention. It's the most widespread Ukrainian dish. It is cooked in each family in Ukraine, but each hostess cooks it her own special way. Here is the recipe of borshch as it's cooked in my family. <br>  100g or 200g of meat with rib bones (prefferably beef)<br>  1 big onion<br>  1 beetroot<br>  1 large or 2 small carrots<br>  50g of pork fat<br>  half a lemon<br>  1-2 tbsp of tomato paste<br>  3or 4 large potatoes<br>  200g of cabbage<br>  bay leaf<br>  salt,pepper <br>  <br>  Boil the meat for the stock. Chop the onion. Grate or shred the beetroot. Grate carrots. Melt some fat on a frying pan. Cut the pork fat into very small pieces and fry it until it becomes golden in colour. Add onions to the frying pan, fry it until they get golden. Add carrots, when they get soft, add beetroot. Sprinkle juice of half a lemon onto the mixture. Add tomato paste to the frying pan. Fry the mixture for a while. Add a litle stock, pepper, bay leaf. Set the heat to the minimum cover with a lid and simmer for a while. <br>  <br>  Put the beef out of stock. Pour the stock into a big pot. Put into the pot the peeled potatoes, cut into big pieces. <br>  <br>  Shred the cabbage. When the stock with potatoes boils put the cabbage into the pot. Add salt. <br>  <br>  Separate the meat from the bones, and put it back to the pot. When the potatoes iare ready (i.e. soft, boiled), turn off the frying pan and put its contents into the pot. Add a bay leaf, black pepper. Turn off the heat. <br>  <br>  When serving put some sour cream and crushed garlic into a plate

nfu6LiVXaa	Sushi originated from China.<br>  <br>  Sushi is also called 鮨 or 鮓, which appeared in the Chinese dictionary in 4BC. 鮨 means minced fish. 鮓 means the preservation (fermentation) of fish with salt and rice. Eventually the Chinese stopped preserving food with rice and in the Ming dynasty, sushi disappeared from Chinese cuisine.<br>  <br>  The word "鮨" first appeared in the Japanese dictionary in 718AD but it had a different meaning. Then in 927AD, the word appeared again in literature and it was used to described the preservation of fish using salt and pressure (ie. placing heavy objects on top of the salted fish). Because this process took too long, people began using soaking the fish in vinegar to instead. Sushi nowadays simply means adding vinegar to rice and serving it with a piece of fish/meat/vegetable.<br>  <br>  The sushi we eat now are developed in Japan, with the exception of some of the rolls that are popular in western countries. California roll was "invented" in North America and I am sure those rolls with philly cream cheese were also invented in North America, too.|`|YxrJQy9Baa	<a href="http://www.asianartmall.com/originsofsushi.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.asianartmall.com/originsofsus...</a><br>  according to this source it comes from China.|`|YYAu9lFDaa	sashimi is japanese.<br>  sushi is american|`|9CKrP9Keaa	Originated in the deepest jungles of Africa.

Most likely the weight is from dairy. Dairy has tons of fat in it per calorie. And really that is what you want to look out for. Look at labels, look at the calories and calories from fat. Your body works on calories per day, so if you eat lots of calories from fat, then you are eating lots of fat.<br>  <br>  Example, if you see 100 calories and 50 calories from fat, that means that 50% of what you are eating is fat.<br>  <br>  If you eat something with 200 calories and 20 calories from fat, that is only 10% fat. <br>  <br>  And basically in short, your body will match percent body fat with percent intake fat.

jr5EgB2Taa	This is tricky, since many states do not allow "home roasting" equipment as they put out chemicals.  I own a coffee roasting business so I can tell you this with a high level of expertise.<br>  You need to check with both your state and county laws before you buy anything.  It would really suck for you to pay out a couple of grand and then get a ticket for air pollution!  Also, you may have to pay sales tax on internet sales depending on what state you are in.  You also need a business licence to sell anything.<br>  If you get the go ahead, then get a small drum roaster, it really tastes so much better than air roasters (you may as well use a popcorn popper!)  The drum roasters are around $1,000.00.  We recommend the Euroroast.  But there are a lot out there.  Don't go with cheap ones, as they will fry after several batches.  Home roasters will only roast about 8 oz at a time.  It is pain, and very, very messy.  The clean up for any roaster is about 30 minutes after each batch (due to the sticky chaff).  If you don't clean it out, you will get a fire (which your homeowners insurance will not cover, and if you rent, you risk a law suite if you don't have written permission from the owner to use a home roaster).<br>  Also keep in mind you will need to source green beans (you will need to buy a full bag weighing about 130 lbs at no less than $2.00 per pound).<br>  If you still really want to roast, but the information I have provided you with seems like a headache (which it is), then I HIGHLY recommend that you find a local roaster (they are in almost every state) and have them toll roast for you for a small fee.  You don't have to worry about the nasty roasting operation, and you can still roast the coffee to your specifications.  However, you still have to have a small business licence.<br>  I don't personally recommend that anyone go into the coffee business right now.  The market is fully saturated on-line.  You are better off finding a coffee you love (by requesting samples around $1.00 each) and purchasing it.

d8685cdfce57268f3ec5dca715629f2caa	"Most sparking wine is non-vintage, which allows the winemaker to blend older wine with the new, to achieve a consistent flavor style. These non-vintage dated wines are ready to consume immediately and should be within one or two years. Slowly but surely, they will begin to deteriorate; further aging does not improve these wines at all.<br>  <br>  Vintage-dated Champagne or sparkling wine can usually benefit from some bottle-aging, provided the consumer enjoys the older, richer, fatter, less vivacious flavors that will ensue. There is generally no improvement more than ten years beyond the vintage date.<br>  <br>  Sometimes a Méthode Champenoise producer will leave the wine en tirage for an extended period of years and then bottle a "Reserve" or "Late Disgorged" bottling. These wines are mostly vintage dated, usually a decade or more old when released for sale, and also immediately ready to consume.<br>  <br>  Consumers would do well to realize that aging is an intrinsic part of the process of making sparkling wine. The vast majority of sparkling wines, including true Champagne will lose both flavor and fizz after a couple of years in the bottle.

You can always make the BS in advance. <br>  <br>  LASAGNE<br>  <br>  Serves 2 <br>  <br>  1. BOLOGNESE SAUCE<br>  <br>  Enough for pasta for 2<br>  <br>  INGREDIENTS<br>  <br>  2 cloves of garlic<br>  2 onions<br>  1 tablespoon of olive oil<br>  500g of minced meat<br>  400g tin of plum tomatoes*<br>  1 beef stock cube<br>  2 teaspoons of oregano or mixed herbs<br>  Ground pepper to taste<br>  <br>  METHOD<br>  <br>  Peel the garlic and chop it into tiny pieces. Peel the onions and chop them into tiny pieces. <br>  <br>  Put the oil into a frying pan on a medium heat. Add the garlic and onion. Fry the garlic and onion for about 2 minutes. Stir frequently to stop it sticking. <br>  <br>  Put the meat into the pan and fry for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring all the time. By this time, it should have broken up and be an even colour, with no pink bits. <br>  <br>  Open the tin of tomatoes. Pour the juice into the pan. Chop the tomatoes while they are still in the can (it’s easier than chasing them around the pan). <br>  <br>  Pour the chopped tomatoes into the pan. Crumble the stock cube into the pan. Add the herbs. Season with the pepper. Mix thoroughly. Continue to cook, stirring as the mixture boils, until the sauce has reduced.<br>  <br>  ADDITIONS & ALTERNATIVES<br>  <br>  Use minced beef, lamb, pork or turkey, whichever is cheapest.<br>  <br>  Add a glass of wine and cook for a bit longer. Drink the glass of wine and cook for the same time. <br>  <br>  * Plum tomatoes can be used either whole or chopped. It is difficult to stick chopped tomatoes back together again if you need to use them whole. <br>  <br>  2. CHEESE SAUCE <br>  <br>  Makes 250ml<br>  <br>  INGREDIENTS <br>  <br>  1 tablespoon of butter<br>  1 tablespoon of flour<br>  250ml of milk <br>  1 tablespoon of grated Parmesan cheese <br>  Ground pepper to taste<br>  <br>  METHOD<br>  <br>  Put the butter into a saucepan on a medium heat. Melt the butter. Add the flour and cook for a minute, stirring all the time. Take off the heat. Add the milk a bit at a time. Stir each time to make sure it is smooth. When all the milk has been added, put the pan back on the heat. Bring to the boil. Keep stirring. Turn down the heat until it is just boiling (simmering). Cook for 2 minutes, stirring all the time. <br>  <br>  Take off the heat. Add the cheese to the sauce and mix. Continue to stir until the cheese has melted into the sauce. Season with the pepper. <br>  <br>  ADDITIONS AND ALTERATIONS<br>  <br>  If the sauce is too thin, add a little bit more flour. If the sauce is too thick, add a little bit more milk. Don’t forget that adding more cheese to improve the flavour will also thicken the sauce. <br>  <br>  TIPS<br>  <br>  The trick is to keep stirring. <br>  <br>  3. LASAGNE <br>  <br>  INGREDIENTS<br>  <br>  1 quantity of Bolognese sauce<br>  1 quantity of cheese sauce<br>  125g (? a 250g packet) of pre-cooked lasagne pasta sheets<br>  1 tablespoon of grated Parmesan cheese<br>  <br>  METHOD<br>  <br>  Put a layer of the Bolognese sauce in an ovenproof dish. Cover with a layer of the pasta sheets. Then another layer of Bolognese sauce. Then a layer of cheese sauce. Then pasta, then Bolognese sauce, then cheese sauce. <br>  <br>  However many layers you end up with, they must finish with a layer of cheese sauce on top. Sprinkle the grated cheese over the top. <br>  <br>  Cook in a preheated oven at 180°C, 350°F, gas mark 4 for about 30 minutes. The top should be golden brown. <br>  <br>  ADDITIONS AND ALTERATIONS<br>  <br>  Use pre-cooked green lasagne verdi pasta sheets.|`|AA12350023	well you could do a simple beshamel casserolle.. its similar to lasagna but easier to me..<br>  boil up a bag of any noodles, (elbow, macaroni, bows, whatever you have).. drain, rinse, drain and set aside..<br>  cook up 1/2 onion chopped, 2 garlic buds minced, 1/2 pound (2 cups or 500grms) of ground beef  till beef is all browned<br>  drain off fat..<br>  add a regular size can of crushed tomatoes (or use whole and mash them yourself).. and 1 small jar/box of tomato paste (6oz) and 1 cup water.. add a small can of sliced mushrooms<br>  add 1 tsp sugar. 1 TBSP of italien spice.

UAW1U3Uoaa	It depends what you mean by drinking problem. If you mean alcoholic then no, he isn't alcoholics cannot function without alcohol if he is only drinking on these days then that clearly is not the case, unless of course he is hiding his drinking at other times. On the other hand he is certainly drinking more than Government guidelines would suggest however even these are open to debate and some say they are for too conservative and some scientists believe it is safe to drink considerably more. If he is drinking a bottle of wine and 1/3 of a bottle of vodka each night that seems a lot, breaking it down we are talking 3 large glasses of wine and 10 shots of vodka this equates to around 16-19 units of alcohol, Government guidelines suggest no more than 3-4 units per day on a regular basis and 28 units weekly your friends husband is consuming around 57 units per week this could cause long term health issues.|`|FF7komSUaa	Well I think he might have a slight problem. a bottle of wine a night and some vodka is a lot of alcohol.

He's drinking 65 units a week. Over 50 units is described as 'serious problem drinking' in the UK and he will be prone to liver damage if he keeps up this level of consumption.<br>  <br>  There is a theory that Milk Thistle and a good diet can combat the effects of excessive drinking.<br>  <br>  The panel who set the limits did not use any scientific advice when they set the 21 unit limit per week, it was a random number, according to some peoples views.<br>  <br>  You take a big chance drinking as much as he is.|`|CB15kchkaa	Let's be honest here, what is a drink problem?

I have a friend who is now in AA who ACTUALY had a drinking problem.  Everynight no matter what he was doing he would take a bottle into the basement and wouldn't fall asleep until it was gone.  He would wake up sunday morning, have the house to him self and start going at another bottle.  He was often wasted before 12 o'clock.  Even if he knew something important was going on the next day the want and need to drink out wayed that and he would find himself passed out in the basement.  The fact that your friend does this on the weekends shows that he is obviously the one in controll not the alcohol.  He can controll when he drinks and how much, therefor he does not have a drinking problem he just simply likes to drink just like millions of other americans

Storing Starter <br>  Let the starter ferment for 5 to 10 days, then transfer from the bowl to a clean glass jar with a lid. Seal and refrigerate. Bring to room temperature before using. <br>  <br>  FOR SOURDOUGH STARTER: <br>  In a large mixing bowl soften yeast in 1/2 cup of the lukewarm water. Stir in the remaining water, flour, and sugar or honey. Stir till smooth. Cover the bowl with 100 percent cotton cheesecloth. Let stand at room temperature (75-85 degrees) for 5-10 days, stirring 2-3 times each day, or till the mixture has a sour, fermented aroma. (Fermentation time depends upon the room temperature. A warmer room hastens fermentation.) When fermented, transfer sourdough starter to a 1-quart jar or plastic container. Loosely cover and refrigerate. If starter isn’t used within 10 days, stir in 1 teaspoon sugar or honey. Repeat every 10 days till used (the starter can be kept indefinitely). To use starter, bring desired amount to room temperature. For every cup used, stir 3/4 cup all-purpose flour, 3/4 cup water, and 1 teaspoon sugar or honey into the remaining amount. Cover and let stand at room temperature for at least 1 day, or till bubbly. Then refrigerate for later use. <br>  <br>  FOR BREAD: <br>  Bring 1 cup sourdough starter to room temperature (about 1 hour). In a large mixing bowl combine 2 1/2 cups of the flour, the yeast, and salt. Add the 1 1/2 cups warm water and the sourdough starter. Beat with an electric mixer on low speed for 30 seconds, scraping bowl constantly. Beat on high speed for 3 minutes. Using a wooden spoon, stir in as much of the remaining flour as you can. <br>  <br>  On a lightly floured surface, knead in enough of the remaining flour to make a stiff dough that is smooth and elastic (8-10 minutes total). Shape into a ball. Place in a lightly greased bowl; turn once. Cover and let rise in a warm place till double (about 1 hour). <br>  <br>  Punch dough down. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide dough in half. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes. Lightly grease a large baking sheet. Sprinkle with cornmeal. Roll each half of dough into a 15x10-inch rectangle. Roll up, starting from a long side. Moisten edge with water and seal. Taper ends. Place, seam-side down, on the prepared baking sheet. Cover and let rise in a warm place till nearly double (35-45 minutes). <br>  <br>  Place an ovenproof ceramic or heavy-duty glass baking dish filled with 1 inch of water on the lowest rack of the oven. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Let the water steam the oven while the bread rises. <br>  <br>  Combine egg yolk and water. Brush dough with egg wash. With a very sharp knife or single-edge razor blade, make 4-5 diagonal cuts about 1/4 inch deep across top of each loaf. Place baking sheet with bread on rack above pan of water. Lower oven temperature to 375 degrees; bake for 30-35 minutes, or till bread is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped. (If necessary, cover loosely with foil the last 15 minutes to prevent overbrowning.) Remove bread from baking sheet; cool on a rack. <br>  <br>  Makes 2 loaves (15 servings each).|`|24kcf3Hraa	I think you're right and the heating pad would be too warm.  One place you might try is the top of your fridge.  Refrigerators do their job by exchanging cold for heat, and there's always one area on the appliance where the heat's given off.  Sometimes it's the back, sometimes it's the top.  If yours gets warm on top, it will likely be warm enough for the starter.<br>  <br>  Keeping it near the stove if you cook often might also do the trick.<br>  <br>  If neither of these are options then maybe you could try covering the heating pad with a couple of folded towels and then set the container on top of that.  Heat would still come through but it wouldn't be at full blast.  I think sourdough needs to be kept at high seventies to low eighties Fahrenheit to be really happy.|`|hKlsJgVSaa	Just keep this in mind.<br>  <br>  Back in the day when sour dough first came about they didn't have warm houses all night long thru out the winter. <br>  <br>  We always had a wood stove growing up no furnace or anything. Our kictehn was always cold and the butter was always hard even when we left it out on thew counter. My Dad was still able to keep sour dough starter on the counter.<br>  <br>  It wont get that nice starter as fast but it will do it. But keeping it on the fridge or near the stove is also a good idea.|`|f262cda35c3c0959f3b4089b38f0359faa	No do not put it on a heating pad. I find that a warm place is usually on top of your refrigerator (not in it of course). Since hot air rises and there is heat generated from behind the fridge this may be the place.<br>   A closed oven with the light turned on is a good place.

e1d102bac5436ccdc1f7ad70bd34d95aaa	Wow, you are really in to this egg thingy!<br>  <br>  My Grandmas recipe (colesterol city!)<br>  Teflon pan: fry you some bacon careful not to burn : remove bacon. Keep grease in pan medium/low heat: crak your egg into the bacon grease: fry until the egg is close to done: take your spatula and splash some of the bacon grease on top of the egg. This will cook the top of the egg. Old southern way!|`|LLQw0xkVaa	I start with a heavy well seasoned cast iron skillet<br>  a thin wide plastic spatula bacon strips and eggs that are not ice cold ( the temp change from fridge to skillet can cause the yolk to want to break more readily)<br>  1st- brown the bacon on med high heat set aside leaving drippings in skillet.reduce heat to med low and break your eggs one at a time into a small shallow bowl gently ease the egg into the skillet. Using the spatula contain the whites that want to spread too far, a compact egg is easier to flip. when the egg feels that it is loosening from the skillet with out breaking up slide the spatula under and rotate 1/4 turn to insure that the egg isn't sticking. cook for 1-1 1/2 min longer gently brushing the bacon dripping up over the top of the egg with your spatula until the white has just set on bottom and then carefully flip egg cook 1 min more.  the flip takes practice its all bout timing the cooking, you want the whites set but not hardened and I do still occasionally break and egg or two but they are cheep and if you don't want to serve them to your guests then cool and store in fridge for up to three days my hubby eats these on BLTs when I have to work nights. you can dice and toss into fried rice with bits of leftover meats and veg as well as make quick kid friendly breakfast wraps with tortillas salsa and cheese|`|AA11767076	Crack your eggs into a medium heated pan that has been sprayed with PAM, or a little melted butter. Once the whites have begun to turn "white", add 3 tablespoons of water to your pan & cover & reduce the heat to low to steam cook. Do not disturb for 2 minutes. Take off lid & voila! Totally cooked eggs that are white & yellow picture perfect.<br>  <br>  The water will have dissipated & your eggs will be wonderful. I was skeptical the first time that I tried this, but it works & no broken yolks!|`|pFkGJlntaa	You are making this effort too complicated. I like my eggs over easy too.  So, I get a pan, put oil, break the egg into the oil, make sure it is hot, then when the egg white starts turning white, flip the egg over, wait for a few seconds, then take it out of the pan.<br>  <br>  Make sure you put enough oil so you are not burning the sides.  Use olive oil if you are health conscious.<br>  <br>  Practice makes perfect.|`|hKlsJgVSaa	Here is how I make my eggs:<br>  <br>  1. Crack the eggs into a small bowl-this way you can make sure there are no eggs and if you are cooking more than one egg they cook as a set rather then seperate eggs.<br>  <br>  2. Heat a skillet with a nice smooth surface-non stick-stainless steal-cast iron etc... on high. Add some veggie oil and pour in the egg(s). Immediatly reduce the heat on the pan to medium.<br>  <br>  3. Once the egg white has started to set start making sure it slides around the pan. Use a metal spatula to slowly start to move it around.<br>  <br>  4. For flipping I find taht some times if I slide it onto a plate then make sure ther is enough *oil ir what ever in the pan and then gently flip the egg back into the pan.  It is just easier to do it that way than fliping it with a spatula sometimes.<br>  <br>  5. As soon as you flip it shut off the heat. Only leave it for about 20 seconds or so. Then you just slide it back out of the pan onto your plate.<br>  <br>  <br>  This sounds like a lot of steps but it's not. I just broke it down.<br>  <br>  ****Don't use bacon grease for this. I am a big fan of bacon grease but the thing is that bacon grease has a lot of little pieces or chunks in it. That will cause your egg to stick more. Also frying the egg right after frying the bacon will make for sticky eggs.|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	The nook would work but so would flipping hot oil on top of the egg. If you flip the egg you run the risk of breaking it.|`|f262cda35c3c0959f3b4089b38f0359faa	If I order over easy eggs at a restaurant and they are not perfect I send them back. I want the white done, not hard around the edges or runny and I want the yolk warm and liquid.<br>  Use a nonstick pan over medium heat. Spray it with cooking spray. The pan should be hot, but not too hot—the egg shouldn't sizzle when it hits the pan. <br>  Place egg gently into pan. <br>  The egg actually has two separate whites, outer and inner. The inner takes longer to set. I puncture the inner white after the egg begins to set in the pan. This will spread it a little and make it catch up to the outer white. <br>  Turn the egg when the white is almost done but you can see the to finish it needs to be turned.<br>  Leave it for about 15 seconds then turn onto your plate.<br>  This takes practice and you will not be perfect at 1st. Eventually with patience you'll get it.|`|0vQsoYIbaa	To make perfect eggs over easy, be sure to use oil of some sort.  Olive oil is OK.  Bacon fat is good, but depending on your pan, if you cook bacon in it, you have to loosen the bacon drippings or the eggs will stick.  <br>  <br>  Here is the secret to flipping eggs.  You learn by putting a hot pad in a skillet and practice flipping it until you get how hard and how high to flip.  Be sure to loosen the egg with a spatula before you try to flip.  When it's ready it will slide around in the skillet easily. Also, when you flip eggs, move over the sink for any splash-outs.|`|AAgX0SDcaa	lower the cooking temperature and watch them every second. They are so easy to overcook if you don't watch them. Cook the egg until the white is completely cooked and gently turn them over and cook for a minute or so to finish the other side.  My favorite style of over-easy eggs is to cook them in olive oil, and serve with green olives on the side. Had them that way in Morocco and always cook them at home that way now.

MbW8KRoGaa	It is a syrup made from processed corn sugars; you know how fresh corn tastes nice and sweet? Well, that's from its natural sugars--corn syrup producers take those natural sugars and concentrate them into syrup form. <br>  <br>  I would use golden syrup or agave nectar in place of corn syrup in most recipes--unless it's a candy recipe. If it's a candy recipe, then the corn syrup is there to keep the finished candy from crystallizing and doesn't affect the flavor at all. In the case of a candy recipe, I would look for a source of pure glucose--which is available from bakery and candy-making specialty shops. <br>  If you can't find glucose and still need to keep the sugar in the candy from crystallizing, use 1/4 teaspoon of tartaric acid. The acid will 'invert' some of the sucrose (sugar) into glucose and help to prevent crystallization in the finished product.<br>  In baked goods, honey is also a good substitute if you don't mind the honey flavor in your dish.|`|AA12350023	its a white syrup thats made from corn sugar..<br>  normally store bought tastes a bit of vanilla <br>  <br>  popular brand is Karo syrup.. .. there is white corn syrup and dark brown corn syrup.. <br>  <br>  you can also use golden syrup in place of this..<br>  <br>  or your own sugar syrup recipe used on pastries..

Serves 4-6.<br>  <br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  Mixed Pepper, Feta Cheese, and Calamata Olive Salad <br>  <br>  (Inspired by the traditional Greek salad)<br>  <br>   8 reasons to make this salad: <br>  <br>  It's delicious! <br>  It's phenomenally healthy -full of carotenoids, vitamin C, phyto-nutrients, fiber, and the healthy kind of oils. <br>  It's very colorful and pretty - great for special celebrations. <br>  It can be made ahead of time.  In fact it's best if it's made at least one hour before serving. <br>  It can stay fresh in the fridge for several days - so you can make up a big batch and nibble at it for days. <br>  It's not fussy about proportions.  A little more or less of anything won't hurt it. <br>  Add or substitute other ingredients and it will keep its basic goodness. <br>  It travels well - a hit at potlucks! <br>  To make it, mix the following in a large bowl:<br>  <br>  2 sweet, red peppers, chopped coarsely <br>  1 sweet green pepper, chopped coarsely, <br>  1 sweet yellow or orange pepper, chopped coarsely <br>  1 large cucumber, peeled and sliced - sprinkle the cucumber slices with lemon-pepper seasoning to enhance their flavor. <br>  1/2 red onion, chopped finely <br>  1 8-ounce pack of feta cheese, crumbled (I usually use feta pre-seasoned with tomato and basil or garlic and herb) <br>  1 9.5-ounce jar (2 cups) pitted, Calamata olives, drained <br>  scant 1/4 cup of extra virgin olive oil <br>  2+ Tablespoons of white balsamic vinegar <br>  1/4 - 1/2 teaspoon of each of the following: salt, garlic powder, dried basil, dried thyme, dried oregano, and pepper if you didn't already sprinkle the cucumber with lemon-pepper <br>  <br>  You can add cherry tomatoes when they're in season.  (You can use slices of regular tomatoes, but these won't stay fresh as long as the other ingredients.The same goes for sliced mushrooms.  )For extra crunch, you might add sliced carrots.  If you're missing red onion, substitute white onion, or even onion powder.  If the garden has yielded too many cucumbers, add more cucumbers and subtract peppers.  So you see, it's hard to break this recipe.|`|FqRaTTPpaa	How about soups!  March is a great month for soup - depending on how many crock pots you have you can offer a lot of different types.  Chili, chicken noodle, broccoli cheese... just have some French bread and salad with it, and everyone will love you!  You can make the preparation as easy or difficult as you like - either buy the industrial-size cans of prepared soup, or make it from scratch!
9xCtDDBgaa	I have one!<br>  <br>  Okay, it is a lunch or brunch main dish from France.<br>  <br>  Chocolate Crepes:<br>  Prep Time: 25 minutes<br>  Cook Time: 30 minutes<br>  Ingredients:<br>  2 cups milk <br>  1 1/2 cups flour <br>  1/2 cup cocoa powder <br>  6 tablespoons powdered sugar <br>  2 large eggs <br>  2 tablespoons butter, melted <br>  1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br>  1/4 teaspoon salt<br>  <br>  DIRECTIONS:<br>  Whisk all the ingredients vigorously until the crepe batter is completely smooth; allow it to rest in the refrigerator for at least 20 minutes before making into crepes. <br>  <br>  Melt a little butter in a crepe pan or large skillet over low-medium heat. Add 3 tablespoons of batter to the pan and swirl until the bottom of the pan is covered with batter. Cook the crepe for 1 minute, or until the crepe is slightly moist on top and golden underneath. Loosen the edges of the crepe, slide the spatula under it, and then gently flip it upside down into the pan. Cook for 1 minute and transfer the cooked crepe to a plate to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter.<br>  <br>  Then, what you can do is sprinkle chocolate shavings and nuts on top! Also, try fruit jam! It's delicious!<br>  Makes 12 servings.<br>  <br>  <br>  Happy Cooking!|`|hHCdXq0Naa	Chocolate would be used in desserts, unless you're making a Spanish mole sauce|`|AA12350023	I dont know anywhere they use chocolate in savory dishes except like the one said above, the mexican/spanish mole sauce.. which is like a thick gravy you use over meat dishes.. <br>  <br>  speaking of.. reminds me of my sons kindergarten.. they make chocolate gravy and bisquits.. they make regular gravy (flour, butter, milk recipe) and add tons of chocolate powder in it with some sugar and serve it over bisguits.. but then again, this might be considered a sweet dish..

It's good in heavily flavored (such as ceasar?) salads because it holds its own pretty well. It also tends to stay crunchy longer. Leaf, on the other hand, is more of a bland (in a good way, of course), buttery green that is especially useful as a base for more exotic mixed greens such as arugula, endive and the like.

It has been proven that circumcision removes most of the sensitive skin of the penis. Most think that the glans (head of the penis) is the most sensitive part, that is only true in males who have been circumcised, but the sensitivity of the glans is greatly decreased because it is exposed after circumcision and becomes callused. <br>  <br>  Many people, even most doctors who have not kept up with the latest research will say that the forskin serves no purpose and removing it does not affect sexual pleasure. But the reason that circumcision became so widespread in the USA is because it was recommended as a cure for masturbation by permanently desensitizing the penis. <br>  <br>  I have a problem with people forcing circumcision on infants but feel that informed adults have the right to have it done, I just want to make sure that adult men know what they will be giving up.|`|v4f1oqOCaa	i wouldnt mention the circumcision in the theme of the party. just a party celebrating him turning 16 would be enough, those who know what is going on know, and those who dont obviously arent close enough to him to need to know.    go with whatever sport or hobby he is into.  if he likes baseball you could make a banner "welcome to the big league"|`|829070aea711a47d99d908ff132df3bbaa	Yes,<br>  Get someone to dress up as Rabbi I.

Its good for you|`|YYAu9lFDaa	sounds good|`|hHCdXq0Naa	You aren't eating any protein or fruit for breakfast.  Add a piece of cheese or hard-boiled egg.

That's the meal that gives you energy to get you going.<br>  <br>  A smoothie is fine (fruit and lowfat milk are good) but add some protein and maybe a carb. What about with the smoothie, 1 slice of whole grain light toast (Nature's Own makes 40cal/slice bread) with either some peanut butter, a slice of ham lunchmeat, or some turkey bacon?<br>  <br>  A small snack between b'fast and lunch, and between lunch and dinner.

2RzEaod9aa	These things take time. Don't rush them. My doctors in the military rushed my broken foot and I'm permanently disabled now...it affects my entire body. And yes, I was an omnivore then.<br>  <br>  Beans and leafy greens are going to help you, calcium-wise, far more than milk ever could. The Harvard Study, done with 75,000 people over 12 years, showed that milk actually makes you more prone to osteoporosis, so don't think that's the way you'll have to get your calcium. <br>  <br>  Vitamin D is found in very few food sources and is a terrible source of D at that. Get some sun. If you're in an area where the sun isn't out during the winter, hit the tanning bed for 3 minutes every other day. Don't wear sunscreen...you're trying to absorb those UV rays to make the vitamin D. Vitamin D increases your immunity, but also helps you better uptake the calcium. <br>  <br>  Give these a shot.|`|NNiN0tK0aa	I've had problems with bone density.....you need to make sure you're consuming enough calcium and other minerals.<br>  <br>  Make sesame milk and drink as much as you can.  Its very bitter, I love it, but if you don't, add dates to sweeten it, or make it into a milk shake with fruit.  When Sergei Boutenko of the Russian Raw Family broke something he craved - and drank - massive amounts of sesame milk and his bone healed beautifully.  Children on raw diets/people who go raw as children often crave the foods their bodies need, and in this case I think his craving was exactly right.  <br>  Also try to have as much green stuff as you can - weeds, dark leafy greens, broccoli, wheatgrass, algae, sunflower greens.  Green juice, green smoothies, salads, soups, dehydrated (kale chips, green crackers), chopped veg, there are countless ways.  Try to eat as much as you can afford financially.  Seaweed also is packed with minerals.

R5IAmQAVaa	Your question is redundant.  Its like asking "how can I drink vodka without getting drunk", or "how can I take sleeping pills without getting tired."   the answer is "you can't".<br>  <br>  Even if you drink cafeene free beverages, they are still loaded with high fructose corn syrup... High fructose meaning, "lots and lots of sugar".  And sugar will keep you awake, there is no way to avoid that, even if you drink caffene free.<br>  <br>  Really, your ONLY option would be to use soda water, which is basically just carbonated water.  You can mix fruit juices which have much less sugar in them to help with the taste and you will still get that cool fizz.  You can also use sugar free kool-aid packets, or any of those drink mix packets that are sugar free.  It won't be nearly as good... but it won't interfere with your sleep as much.|`|oDqRL2gQaa	Maybe try drinking caffeine free pepsi.|`|HBFHZXybaa	Try buying the caffeine free Pepsi.

w0WStkPxaa	I bake my pretzels at 450 degrees. Below is the recipe I use and they always come out perfect. A warm golden brown on the outside. Its from Alton Brown (food network)<br>  <br>  <br>  Ingredients<br>  <br>      * 1 1/2 cups warm (110 to 115 degrees F) water<br>      * 1 tablespoon sugar<br>      * 2 teaspoons kosher salt<br>      * 1 package active dry yeast<br>      * 22 ounces all-purpose flour, approximately 4 1/2 cups<br>      * 2 ounces unsalted butter, melted<br>      * Vegetable oil, for pan<br>      * 10 cups water<br>      * 2/3 cup baking soda<br>      * 1 large egg yolk beaten with 1 tablespoon water<br>      * Pretzel salt<br>  <br>  Directions<br>  <br>  Combine the water, sugar and kosher salt in the bowl of a stand mixer and sprinkle the yeast on top. Allow to sit for 5 minutes or until the mixture begins to foam. Add the flour and butter and, using the dough hook attachment, mix on low speed until well combined. Change to medium speed and knead until the dough is smooth and pulls away from the side of the bowl, approximately 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the dough from the bowl, clean the bowl and then oil it well with vegetable oil. Return the dough to the bowl, cover with plastic wrap and sit in a warm place for approximately 50 to 55 minutes or until the dough has doubled in size.<br>  <br>  Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Line 2 half-sheet pans with parchment paper and lightly brush with the vegetable oil. Set aside.<br>  <br>  Bring the 10 cups of water and the baking soda to a rolling boil in an 8-quart saucepan or roasting pan.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, turn the dough out onto a slightly oiled work surface and divide into 8 equal pieces. Roll out each piece of dough into a 24-inch rope. Make a U-shape with the rope, holding the ends of the rope, cross them over each other and press onto the bottom of the U in order to form the shape of a pretzel. Place onto the parchment-lined half sheet pan.<br>  <br>  Place the pretzels into the boiling water, 1 by 1, for 30 seconds. Remove them from the water using a large flat spatula. Return to the half sheet pan, brush the top of each pretzel with the beaten egg yolk and water mixture and sprinkle with the pretzel salt. Bake until dark golden brown in color, approximately 12 to 14 minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack for at least 5 minutes before serving.|`|6Xbz5AOlaa	425 degrees F.!<br>  for a perfect texture!|`|2b7ErdOqaa	I bake cakes at 350o, cookies at 375o, and bread and pizza at 400o.<br>  <br>  I looked on the "web" and found temperatures of 375o, 400o, 425o, 450o and 475o for making soft chewy pretzels.  I haven't personally made pretzels but I have made bagels which are similar - the shape being the only difference.  And, to make the bagels, you drop them into boiling sugar/water and THEN bake them, which would make the soft outside and the soft inside.  The sugar/water solution is 8 cups of water with 2 tablespoons sugar.  Bring to a boil, drop in a few pretzels and when they float, turn them over, boil an additional 3 minutes and remove them - so make sure you have room for them to float.  Then remove them and place them on a greased baking sheet.  Brush them with an egg yolk mixture (2 egg yolks beaten with 1 T water) and sprinkle with your sea salt or rock salt.  Bake in preheated 400o oven until richly browned (apx 25-30 minutes).  Transfer to wire racks to cool.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|OAEuYZkZaa	This is for Soft Pretzels, but my Cooks Illustrated Baking Illustrated calls for 12 to 16 minutes at 450*F, turning the baking sheet half way through the cooking time.<br>  <br>  As for your French Bread, if you don't brush the top of the loaf with oil or melted butter, try doing so.  Also watch the internal temperature of the loaf.  Start checking with an instant read thermometer and remove it from the oven when internal temperature reaches 195*F.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  Doc|`|zawmsUO1aa	Pretzels. <br>  Out of boredom, I tried Alton Brown's recipe, which called for boiling the pretzels for 30 seconds in the baking soda/water mixture, brushing with beaten egg and sprinkling with salt. They were baked at 450F for approx 12 minutes and they were nice and soft, like a mall pretzel. The egg makes a chewy soft exterior. The downside? They got mushy when stored in a plastic zipper-type bag. Here's the recipe  <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/homemade-soft-pretzels-recipe/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton...</a><br>  <br>  Bread<br>  The pan of water underneath is to encourage a hard crust for breads. If you don't want that, don't use it. When a loaf of bread first comes out, it will be crispy, but all the liquid that was in the dough has to go somewhere, and it will come out through the crust. After a few hours, some loaves might even get wrinkly-looking from the contained water. When I bake  bread, I let it sit on the cooling rack overnight so that it gives off its moisture and then gets crispy again. If I want a soft crust, I put the bread in a zipper-type baggie. If you want a bread with a hard exterior, you could try this low-yeast Ciabatta; not much hands-on work but it could take all day if your house is cool. I've made it twice and it's not at all like conventional yeast breads because of the low yeast content and the long, long, long rising periods. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.thefighting44s.com/forum/showthread.php?t=3034" rel="nofollow">http://www.thefighting44s.com/forum/show...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck!
OAEuYZkZaa	Let me suggest that you spray the exterior of your gloves with non-stick spray.  I believe that is about the only way to prevent bread dough from sticking to the hands.  The only other alternative is to knead in a stand mixer.<br>  <br>  If you don't already have a copy, let me strongly suggest you find a copy of Baking Illustrated from the Test Kitchen of Cooks Illustrated.  Those folks test every recipe seven ways from Sunday, alternating every ingredient, every mixing method, and every reasonable temperature.<br>  <br>  If you try one of the Cooks Illustrated recipes, and follow the directions closely, it WILL  turn out right.<br>  <br>  Doc|`|zawmsUO1aa	Oil up your hands beforehand with olive oil, shortening, margarine or even vegetable oil and use a good hand lotion afterward. <br>  <br>  Flour and water will leach all the moisture out of your hands.|`|ku0wHQDiaa	well, you can use oleo as a non sticking agent for your hands.

aa3f82e25dd13bf67194db3cdf616972aa	These potato skins easy to make. Some approaches call for deep frying, but I don't think it is really necessary. You just want to bake the skins at a high enough heat so that they get crispy enough to hold the toppings.<br>  <br>   <br>  Potato Skins Recipe<br>  INGREDIENTS<br>  6 small to medium sized russet baking potatoes (total 3 pounds)<br>  Olive oil<br>  Canola oil or grapeseed oil<br>  Kosher salt<br>  Freshly ground pepper<br>  6 strips of bacon<br>  4 ounces grated cheddar cheese<br>  1/2 cup sour cream<br>  2 green onions, thinly sliced, including the greens of the onions<br>  METHOD<br>  1 Scrub the potatoes clean then bake the potatoes using your favorite method, either oven or microwave. If using an oven, rub with olive oil and bake in a 400°F oven for about an hour until the potatoes are cooked through and give a little when pressed. If using a microwave, rub all over with olive oil and cook on the high setting for about 5 minutes per potato. I have found that baking the potatoes in a conventional oven yields potatoes that are easier to work with (cut and scoop out), the potato seems to adhere to the skins a little better, but there is hardly a discernible difference in the final product.<br>  2 While the potatoes are cooking, cook the bacon strips in a frying pan on medium low heat for 10 to 15 minutes, or until crisp. Drain on paper towels. Let cool. Crumble.<br>   <br>  3 Remove the potatoes from the oven and let cool enough to handle. Cut in half horizontally. Use a spoon to carefully scoop out the insides, reserving the scooped potatoes for another use, leaving about 1/4 of an inch of potato on the skin.<br>  Increase the heat of the oven to 450°F. Brush or rub grapeseed oil or canola oil (or another high smoke point oil) all over the potato skins, outside and in. Sprinkle with salt. Place on a baking rack in a roasting pan (don't use a cookie sheet, it will warp, use a roasting pan or broiler pan that can take the heat). Cook for 10 minutes on one side, then flip the skins over and cook for another 10 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool enough to handle.<br>   <br>  4 Arrange the potato skins skin-side down on the roasting pan or rack. Sprinkle the insides with freshly ground black pepper, cheddar cheese, and crumbled bacon. Return to the oven. Broil for an additional 2 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly. Remove from oven. Use tongs to place skins on a serving plate. Add a dollop of sour cream to each skin, sprinkle with green onions.<br>  Serve immediately. Serves 4 to 6.<br>  Note: If you have a potato whose skin or flesh has turned green, cut out those parts, do not use them. The green indicates the presence of a toxin that develops when potatoes are exposed to sunlight.|`|xMTstnUsaa	I like to boil potatoes till they are starting to fall to bits and then sitck them in the chip fryer.

If you are doing light exercise or doing nothing at all (couch-warming) - then Gatorade is a big waste of money.

If you are sweating heavily you will lose these two minerals in your sweat. However - I believe you would need to be doing a serious amount of exercise (hours) before loss of these minerals will become a problem (this is a different story if diarrhea and vomiting are involved).<br>  <br>  If you drink a whole bottle of Gatorade you are consuming about 56 grams of sugar -- this is not required in a normal sedentary lifestyle -- and in this situation it could be considered "bad" for you.<br>  <br>  Gatorade Ingredients<br>  water, sucrose syrup, glucose-fructose syrup, citric acid, natural and artificial flavors, salt, sodium citrate, monopotassium phosphate, ester gum, sucrose acetate isobutyrate, yellow 5<br>  <br>  Gatorade Nutrition Facts<br>  serving size: 8 fl oz; calories 50; total fat 0g; sodium 110mg; potassium 30mg; total carbs 14g; sugars 14g|`|EEdwMWckaa	lots of sugar, lots of sodium<br>  <br>  the simple carbs from sugar are empty calories that will leave you feeling drained and cause you to gain weight<br>  <br>  sodium will deplete your potassium level <br>  <br>  and all the artificial coloring is toxic to your body as well|`|5LWq12epaa	It can be.

6Xbz5AOlaa	HMM ILOVE TUNA and i think you will love these recipies and tips: <br>  When you are trying to clean up your diet and eat healthy, you will often be looking for leaner sources of meat to consume. While almost everyone out there seems to love a big, juicy steak, often this is not going to be best for your waistline. You need to find protein sources that are comprised mostly of solely protein, without any additional fat or carbohydrate calories added in.<br>  <br>  The best choices are usually going to be foods such as chicken, turkey, egg whites and fish - including canned tuna. Canned tuna is a very big choice among the fitness and bodybuilding crowd because it is very cost effective, extremely convenient and can be stored or brought with you almost where ever you go. This makes it a perfect option for lunches at work, to bring with you when you travel or for nights when you just don't have the energy to bake some fish or grill a chicken breast. At 120 calories and just under 30 grams of protein a can, you really can't go wrong.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind however that this nutritional information is just for the actual can of tuna itself and that if you start adding high calorie sauces to it suddenly you are no better off than you were with your steak.<br>  <br>  Let's face it though. Most people don't like tuna. They simply don't. Period. And who can really blame them? Unless you are one of the rare individuals who enjoys the taste of plain tuna or are just so oblivious to taste you really don't care, tuna is not that great. Luckily for you though, there are plenty of ways you can dress it up so as to make it much more appealing to your taste buds all while keeping the nutrition content high. This will make sticking to your diet incredibly easier in the long run.<br>  <br>  Next time you are looking for a quick protein source, try one of these.<br>  Easy Mix-In's<br>  <br>  Take one can of tuna and add one of the following ingredients.<br>  <br>  Tuna Salad<br>  <br>  2 tbsp low fat mayo and some chopped onion<br>  <br>  Old El Paso Tuna<br>  <br>  ?-1/3 cup salsa<br>  <br>  Mustard-dill Tuna<br>  <br>  Mustard to taste sprinkled with some dill<br>  <br>  Oriental-Ginger Tuna<br>  <br>  1 tbsp soy sauce, 1 tbsp chicken broth, ginger and garlic powder<br>  <br>  Balsamic Vinegar<br>  <br>  1-2 tbsp balsamic vinegar<br>  <br>  Tuna Italiano<br>  <br>  1-2 tbsp fat free Italian salad dressing sprinkled with oregano or Italian spice<br>  <br>  Tuna Melt<br>  <br>  Once tuna is on a plate, cover a low fat cheese slice and place under broiler.

I take whatever kind of meat we are in the mood for, weather it be Hamburger patties, pork steak, chops, whatever and brown them 1/2 way.  Then I combine 1-2 cans (depending on how much meat) of cream of mushroom with 1-2 packs of brown gravy mix and a little milk to thin.  I like to cook onions and mushrooms down with the meat, but that is purely optional (make sure to season your meat while cooking too, we like garlic, salt, pepper and seasoned salt), put your meat into a casserole dish large enough its in a single layer, then cover with the "gravy" mixture.  Cover and cook over low heat until cooked through.  Serve with mashed potatoes (you already have your gravy) and corn or green beans.  Nice home cooked meal, that, once again, is cheap easy and not many dishes to clean and it warms up WONDERFULLY!!!!|`|TXY6EAYqaa	He liked steak, mushrooms, onions, garlic done in a red wine sauce with garlic potatoes and side salad.|`|8nmEXGctaa	Do you have a recipe for that.|`|hHCdXq0Naa	Meatloaf, mashed potatoes and green beans .... although he does ask for homemade Chili alot ... or Sausage & Peppers on pasta|`|AA11945637	How is that made?<br>  My most recent ex husband liked hot dogs

Also, if I've eaten a platter of buffalo wings before drinking, my chances of vomiting are much higher.

Try using sites like youtube and talent trove. Youtube has videos of cooking so you can easily follow them. But your limited to what is on there. Talent trove has videos too, but unlike youtube, on talent trove you can also talk to the chefs and ask them questions. Sometimes, the chef will even make a new video specifically to show you how to prepare the dish. I have a band on there, and the singers gave me some vocal lessons.

In addition many foods naturally contain glutamate such has tomatoes, certain cheese and cured meats.  Yet, people done blame these foods for headaches ect.|`|EVwllMNqaa	monosodium glutamate is a neurotoxic flavor enhancer|`|EMDNVrcjaa	monosodium glutamate: white crystalline compound used as a food additive to enhance flavor; often used in Chinese cooking; "food manufacturers ...<br>  <br>  From a different website:<br>  In 1907, Japanese scientist Kikunae Ikeda sat to a bowl of tofu in dashi (a kelp-based broth) and pondered dashi’s peculiar ability to pump up the flavor of other foods. Being a curious little dickens, Professor Ikeda hastened to his laboratory bench to conduct many soup based experiments until he succeeded in extracting crystals of glutamic acid, one of the 20 common amino acids of which proteins are built. The Professor found that glutamate had a distinctive taste and he named it “umami” or as Vogue food writer Jeffrey Steingarten terms it “Supreme Deliciousness!” Umami is difficult to translate, suggested English equivalents include savoury, pungent, and meaty, but none of these words do justice to the term — umami implies a combination of all senses, not just taste. It has even been compared to sex, and has more than a whiff of the mystical.<br>  <br>  In 1909, MSG entered the marketplace as Aji-no-moto, a product so successful, the company subsequently renamed itself. MSG lasts forever, and because it has no smell or taste, it could be used in different dishes to enhance the flavour of the food. In essence — an ideal seasoning. Today, the Ajinomoto Group’s 15 factories supply about one third of the 1.5 million-ton global market for monosodium glutamate.<br>  <br>  Now for the bad news… Like other white powders that induce mystical feelings, MSG is probably not very good for you.<br>  <br>  Scientists at the University of Miami School of Medicine recently discovered “that adding monosodium glutamate makes food taste better and makes you want to eat more.” And eating more is a big problem. Some people believe MSG to be at the heart of the recent soaring statistics of morbid obesity in the industrialised countries of the world. Studies have been done showing a causal link as far back as 1969, when Dr. John W. Olney found his lab rats became grotesquely obese when fed MSG. In addition, the rats suffered brain lesions and neuroendocrine disorders.|`|fc5c0507db7f5b77389a61a92ae3cf1faa	it's a flavor enhancer (E 621) and it's not going to kill you, but a lot of people get headaches, try tongues, mouthes, summed up it's called the china restaurant syndrome.|`|AA12336620	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monosodium_glutamate" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monosodium_...</a>|`|AA11015885	<a href="http://www.sellingsalesmanship.com/msginfo.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sellingsalesmanship.com/msgin...</a>

I know it sounds weird, but it works.|`|CMWzDKN7aa	just freeze your tofu|`|OcIYgqtyaa	Simple Ways to Cook With Tofu:<br>  <br>      * Use firm tofu for the following recipes. If it seems too soft, you can wrap in a dishtowel, and press it with a brick or pan of water, or something heavy to squeeze out excess water, just for 10 - 15 minutes.<br>      <br>      * Slice the firm tofu in 1/2 x 1" pieces, marinate, then fry both sides til crispy. Kids love this, and you can toss the pieces into pasta, rice, casseroles, stir fries etc. See Fried Tofu Recipe below for more details.<br>      * For more adult tastes, add spices like ginger, cumin, etc to the marinade, OR use a spicy marinade, then stir fry with veggies OR add an Indian or Oriental spiced sauce. Serve with rice or noodles.<br>      * Cut tofu in 1/2" slices, or in 1" sticks or fingers, marinate and bake or broil, serve with a grain and vegetables or salad. If you want to get fancy, coat with fine dry bread or cracker crumbs first. Great with catsup! See SV's baked tofu recipe for more details<br>      * Add raw sliced tofu to any veggie dish, or sauce. It'll soak up the flavors. It goes well with stir fried greens. Especially if you throw in a few spices, like cumin, turmeric, ginger, hing. <br>  <br>  good luck!!!! hope this helps
rwXcLTNvaa	From a take-away, yes its very bad if you are on a diet. Don't eat it :D....have a salad|`|b2ZwhOqsaa	depends what your ordering. anything deep fried is obviously bad. so no chicken balls, no soo gui and such yummy things. also chinese food has a lot of MSG. MSG is a flavour enhancer and it also increases your appetite so you will eat more, also it isn't good for you. you can order chinese food without MSG at some places, just ask before you order. white rice isn't good for you either, some places have brown rice, opt for that instead.|`|CsIvy5MAaa	It, like every other kind of food, is fine in moderation. Rice and Noodles are packed with carbs, so that is pretty detrimental in losing weight.|`|msNXomjTaa	There are more Chinese people than any other, and they are generally pretty healthy.  I would say Chinese food is good for you, not bad!<br>  <br>  Like anything, it depends on what you eat, and how much.  It tends to be fairly high in vegetables, which is good.  Cooking in a wok adds very little oil to food (compared to deep frying).  It does depend a lot on the food - North American style is perhaps not quite as healthy.|`|829070aea711a47d99d908ff132df3bbaa	Everything is bad for you( so they say).<br>  get Chinese food if you want Chinese food( just tell them to omit the MSG).<br>  It's fine.<br>  All things in moderation.|`|auUeI2Vnaa	They use healthy ingredients, but also use a lot of grease.|`|k3LbhASGaa	eat to much look like whale|`|le0zdEmVaa	I grew up eating mostly homemade chinese food and I am not a blimp. <br>  <br>  Most American style "Chinese" restaurants drown their dishes in oil so you'll probably pack on some weight of you eat a lot of it but I don't see the harm in eating it once a while. <br>  <br>  Try to get steamed rice with your orders instead of chow mein or fried rice.

Do not cut into the chicken to make sure that it is done.<br>  <br>  If you are working with thicker chicken breasts, after flipping the 1st time, put the pan with the chicken into a 500 degree oven for 5 minutes instead of finishing in the pan on the stovetop.<br>  <br>  Also, it is important to let your chicken "rest" for at least 5 minutes before cutting into it so that the juices can redistribute.|`|2b7ErdOqaa	There are a number of tricks to do that.  One is, as the other person said, brine it.  Another is to cook it in broth.  A third is to pound the breast to make the thickness even, add a little salt and pepper (or just pepper if you are watching your salt), sprinkle it lightly with flour, and then brown it in a skillet in olive oil (just about 2 T).  Once brown on both side - not too dark - place on a cookie sheet and bake in the oven 350o for 15 minutes - that will allow the meat to relax.<br>  <br>  The most important thing when just cooking the chicken breasts is to keep your heat low.  High heat will cause the muscles in the breast to tighten up and thus make tough meat.<br>  <br>  So if you cook it in the broth, don't boil it - simmer it.<br>  <br>  Another thing you can brine your chicken in - if you don't want the salt - is milk.  The chicken will absorb the milk and make it moister.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|1JGj56TFaa	Either wrap them in tin foil and cook in the oven or else steam them.

If you continue to stay vegetarian through-out your whole life (which I hope you do) you will always get people who don't understand you and why you have the kind of diet that you do.<br>  <br>  Most people are not that open minded, and most people think that by being vegetarian you are lacking so many things and they think all you eat is salads, which isn't the case at all. You just have to remember that they don't understand you, they haven't done the research and like I said they are probably just so stuck to their ways and their diets. <br>  <br>  The best thing you can do is just try to ignore it, because even if you fight with them about it, or debate about it, they still won't get you, and they'll still eat meat. Just be proud of yourself for making such a healthy choice and for having heart in an important issue such as animal rights.<br>  <br>  The good thing is that hopefully as you get older you'll meet more vegetarians/vegans and you'll be able to share that bond with them and you won't have to worry about getting made fun of. <br>  <br>  Every vegetarian/vegan has their own personal reasons why they became one, some share it and are vocal about it, some are just private. <br>  <br>  Hopefully this helped you out a bit, I'm happy to hear you are a vegetarian and believe in animal rights, I'm right there with you.

So I hope this helps you out.|`|KgtlyWDXaa	If it is Trader Joe's own brand they most likely are, but they do sell other brands as well, which may or may not be.  You need to read the labels.
EMDNVrcjaa	Is it supposed to be sweet? <br>  <br>  You could make rice krispie treats and shape them into things you would give to a charity, i.e. coats, blankets, food, etc. or you could do cupcakes and write on stuff, i.e. give, share, help, kindness. <br>  Another idea would be to use biscuits and put over the back side of a muffin pan and bake. Then it is an edible bowl you could fill with stew, salad, whatever you like. I don't know if it would be "charity" themed though, but it would be nourishing warm food if you do the stew, and it could be from a "soup" kitchen.|`|2b7ErdOqaa	You could make pasties.  They are what the poor "in the old days of Ireland" took to work for a meal.<br>  <br>  With today's supplies, it would be very easy to make.  If you don't know what they are, they are basically a small round pie dough/bread dough folded in half (like a calzone but smaller) and filled with things like beef stew.  You could use the refrigerated biscuit dough that you pop on the counter - the round ones - roll them out with a rolling pin, and put canned cherry pie filling in them.  Bake them by package directions to light brown and, using a frosting gel (you can find it in your baking section at your local store), write on them whatever you want to say - Save the Children, Talk don't Hit, etc.<br>  <br>  You could even put light pink icing on the outside and then use the red gel for your words to perk it up.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.
eRg04AoEaa	Its not bad. You can get Boca Burgers in grocery stores (frozen food/health food sections). You can also order them in some restaurants, I know "Red Robin" carries them, but not sure you have a Red Robin in your area. But I have seen them on other menu's. If you're a total Vegan then I say go for it, they're good. But if you don't mind eating meat, then you can skip the Boca Burgers & go for a regular hamburger & won't be missing anything fantastic.|`|llkSmgLJaa	It's good as long as your don't over cook it. The patties are precooked so only need to be wormed through. Make sure you buy the one's marked vegan since the vegetarian one's have egg in them. <br>  <br>  In the frezer sectoin of any large food store, Target even has it.|`|ozWi3TJlaa	You know what they taste like to me?  Salisbury steaks.  The kind with meat.  I love to entertain and have lots of friends with special dietary needs.  I made stroganoff with the Boca burgers last time...I just crumbled them up and went on with the recipe, using vegetable broth instead of beef.  Honestly, I doubt any of the meat eaters knew the difference.  There wasn't any left.<br>  <br>  P.S.  The main ingredient is soy protein.  Boca makes both vegetarian and vegan varieties, but only some are certified organic, if that is a concern.|`|9O5Y1Kavaa	Bocca Burgers are amazing. The regular burgers are good. The "chicken" burgers are good and you can use it as a subsitute for other chicken recipes. I tried the bruschetta burger last night and i loved it.<br>  Morning star is great too. The brocoli and chedder bites are good. The Asian pattie tasted so good, especially if you add soy sauce.|`|wU3mgjAKaa	Not all Boca and Morningstar Farms products are vegan, but the Original Vegan made by Boca is obviously vegan. In my opinion, they're quite good. I like to eat them on sandwiches, in wraps, in spaghetti sauce or as a snack by themselves.|`|AAgX0SDcaa	I've had Boca Burgers, they were quite good. I also like Gardenburgers, wish I could find a store that sells many varieties, some of those were excellent.|`|24cec6e3d7aec8df481a24425e55b214aa	boca is like the worst thing for you. it's not even vegan, either. most of the types have cheese in them. if you want a healthier version of fake meat - and most of them are not that healthy - just go get Amy's brand. <br>  <br>  You can get it at Wegman's, Pathmark, Stop and Shop ... pretty much any grocery store.|`|6nWzhWyaaa	Boca is okay<br>  but morning star is better, they have chicken nuggets that are reall good as well (not real chicken of course)<br>  but the only place i know to get them is at trader joes<br>  so if you live in l.a. your in luck|`|x071mcM5aa	Morning Star is better to me, and you can get it as basically any grocery store, but if you want wider options go to Whole Foods.|`|QjP2qtSnaa	I love Boca burgers.  They are great for "veggie" burgers.  I fry them in a skillet and season them with garlic salt and liquid smoke.  I also mash up the burgers to make tacos or meatloaf.|`|zWUnjqYlaa	I had the Boca burgers they are very good.....
INPrlW6Maa	Peppermint Creams<br>  <br>  1 egg white <br>  3 cups confectioners' sugar <br>  1 teaspoon peppermint extract <br>  <br>  In large bowl, whisk egg white until frothy, but not stiff. Stir in confectioners' sugar and peppermint extract. You may need to knead it with your hands. If you wish to add food coloring, knead it in, and keep kneading until the color is evenly distributed. <br>  Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. Form the dough into small balls, place on cookie sheet and flatten slightly. Cover and let sit overnight in a cool, dry place, until set.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Grandma's Mint Patties<br>  <br>  1/2 cup light corn syrup <br>  1/2 cup butter <br>  1 teaspoon mint extract <br>  1/2 teaspoon salt <br>  1 pound confectioners' sugar <br>  1 drop red food coloring (optional) <br>  <br>  DIRECTIONS<br>  Beat white corn syrup, butter or margarine, mint extract, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Mix in 1 pound of powdered sugar and knead intil smooth. <br>  Color with food coloring as desired. Pat or roll to about 1/4 inch thick. Use small cookie cutters to cut shapes.|`|QxaWw4TQaa	You get a bit of mint essence, sprinkle it with sun, add a bit of rainbow and whisk for 40 minutes. Then you will have a perfectly good leprechaun!
AC0yjVJjaa	Well if you know how to make it.<br>  <br>  1.) Get a pan and crack to eggs at the most.<br>  <br>  2.) Crack it in a plastic container and scramble it as best as you can.<br>  <br>  3.) Turn it up to medium and poor it in the frying pan.<br>  <br>  4.) Use your spatula and play around with it.<br>  <br>  5.) make it form into a circle and don't forget to put milk in the plastic container to make it creamy.|`|lys5kB9Daa	i hate when people scramble their eggs before they cook them. just crack the egg right into the pan- on med temp- they burn quickly. let it cook for 2-3 minutes then crack the yolk with a spatula and kind of mix it up with the egg. put a piece of cheese on top of the egg so it gets warm and melty then spatula it onto toasted bread. dont try to put the bread on the skillet just using the toaster is much easier. you can add ham or bacon on top with the cheese too, let it get hot.
54a71494855e0d728b9ec00aab8ff5cfaa	Maybe a girly man drink, but never considered a "man's" drink.|`|hLohtlPEaa	definitely a girls drink. sweet. like a woman|`|axxQzOCHaa	Straight up? Can be enjoyed by both sexes<br>  With lime? Definately a girlie drink|`|287ff78445969e6728827bb2210c9074aa	I definitely don't think it is manly drink but it is not super girly either. It is a smooth alcohol that tastes good. And if you get the 100 proff it will kick you in the ***. So be careful!|`|LnoyylQ7aa	it's not a manly drink and it's not a feminine drink it's just a drink, maybe you live in america?|`|auUeI2Vnaa	Not at all...SoCo is definitely a girly drink.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	No. It's all Janis Joplin ever drank.|`|076i35yGaa	I like Souther Comfort and I have never been accused of being anything other than a man.  Also, if it's for lightweights at 80 proof, then explain 100 proof SoCo...<br>  <br>  Half SoCo half sour mix is very good and not a lightweight drink.|`|jij9Fa9waa	no more of a mans drink than when I order bud light, bottle not draft or glass....a personal choice, who cares how others look at you, maybe they think you have fine taste!|`|UDfJQ3i9aa	Nope not at all. I've known many a man and many of women who drink it. Especially with Dr. Pepper!!|`|j7l9gavRaa	no I don't think so, I am a girl and I drink it and it is deeelish!|`|QjP2qtSnaa	No, and I refuse to drink something so bad.  Try Jack Daniels.|`|6YUeJCEQaa	no, its a woman's drink. its full of sugar.
008512e32e60fcef19c7029ae0dc4d45aa	i dont think its going to be hot at all.. you might bite into one seed and get a lil kick for a second. but i dont think it will be hot at all|`|287ff78445969e6728827bb2210c9074aa	If you like spice that will kick it up a notch. It sounds like it might be a littel on the hot side but good. Also it depends on the kind of jalpeno and how hot it was to begin with. Good luck. :)|`|alIO8ic0aa	The ribs inside the jalapeno and the seeds are the hottest part of the pepper. You can bet if you add these in a recipe it will be hot. Better have some milk to cut the heat!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalape%C3%B1o" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalape%C3%B...</a><br>  <br>  The jalape?o rates between 2,500 and 10,000 Scoville units in heat. In comparison with other chili peppers, the jalape?o has a heat level that varies from mild to hot depending on cultivation and preparation. The heat, which is caused by capsaicin and related compounds, is concentrated in the veins (placenta) surrounding the seeds, which are called picante. — deseeding and deveining can reduce the heat imparted to a recipe that includes jalape?os.|`|JcwjDpY8aa	It will prob be spicy, but unless you left all the ribs and seeds it will most likely not be overpowering heat.
