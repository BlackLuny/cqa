20090131111437AAjA6YB	Home & Garden;Decorating & Remodeling	Where can I find a simple 3 bulb ceiling light fixture that isn't one of these newer ugly ones?	Whatever happened to the plain old light fixtures? Now everything I see has to have antiqued glass that cuts the light. Or just too much metal trim with too many twists and turns. They are just too much. What happened to understated elegance?  I'd also like it to be one that is rated at least 180 Watts so I can use 60 watt bulbs, I'm so tired of dimly lit rooms. This is for a kitchen, light is important.

Unfortunately because I live in such a small room I can only fit the bed on the opposite side or the door without it stopping it from opening all the way or closing all the way.       I really need some comfortable furniture that will be space efficient and will work well with such a small space. Please I don't need a platform bed or bunk bed and I especially don't want a futon. I have had all of the above, and currently sleep on a bed that has a nice small desk beneath and a sitting area, but I'm way too old for it, and I'd like to sleep closer to the ground finally.       So if you could please recommend me some good furniture, or at least a store that sells this kind of furniture. Much appreciated thank you!
