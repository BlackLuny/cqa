20090220104501AAQfcHw	Science & Mathematics;Physics	What is the true definition of speed?	Speed is defined as distance over time, but what truly judges speed? For example we are on the earth which is rotating at a little over 1000mph, this means that standing still we are moving approximately 1000mph, not including  the speed of the earth moving around the sun or the speed of our solar system moving in our galaxy. Anyway, based on this, if you are in a car moving east at 60mph you can be considered to be moving 1060mph. Now I am stating all this in order to question Einsteins theory that it is impossible to reach the speed the light, and perhaps it may be, but what is that speed compared to? For example, 2 asteroids are moving in the same direction 1 light year apart at .99 the speed of light, then theoretically wouldn't it be possible to travel to the asteroid in the back at the speed of light when you'd only really have to travel at .01 the speed of light but wouldn't it also be nearly impossible to get back if Einsteins theory is correct? This could apply to moving between any two bodies, like 2 galaxies.      I'm sorry if I confused you by the way I wrote this but you must understand I have also managed to confuse myself, if anything is not clear just tell me and I will try to clear it up.      So my question is how can we determine true speed if all objects are already moving and there is no motionless point to compare everything elses speed to.      And I understand the difference between speed and velocity and distance and displacement so don't get on here just to correct my use of words, you know what I mean!

In one of them this keeper is evening saying that dolphins have towards humans the same protective instincts they have with their offspring!!! Why I ask?? I know they are mammals, but other mammals don't have that kind of protective behavior with humans, and we certainly don't have that kind of behavior with them. Does anyone think they might have the answer for this?...anyone, scientists, random curious people like me, people of faith, or people of the occult.

I want to make the old standby lamp dimmer voltage controller for connecting my soldering iron, or a sewing machine motor to, etc., and I've seen several different ideas.      I basically want to know if I need to add any resistors to the line that I'll connect the dimmer to the plug-in socket or not.  I'll be connecting the dimmer to a wall socket that's encased in an electrical box, and then run a wire from that to the actual house's wall socket.  So basically the dimmer is just a step point between the actual wall and the external plug for plugging in AC devices.      So do I need to add any extra resistors or capacitors in this setup?

A tank contains 1800 L of pure water. Solution that contains 0.04 kg of sugar per liter enters the tank at the rate 6 L/min, and is thoroughly mixed into it. The new solution drains out of the tank at the same rate.      (a) How much sugar is in the tank at the beginning?   y(0) = 0 kg   Pure water --> no sugar, so y(0) = 0      (b) Find the amount of sugar after t minutes.   y(t) = ?? kg      I can't get it, but it's somewhere close to .04 - (6t/1800).  I have been playing around with the equation kP(1-P/K), but still can't get this equation that solves for t.      (c) As t becomes large, what value is y(t) approaching? In other words, calculate the following limit:   lim as t goes to INF of y(t) = ?? kg      Can't get this part until I figure out part c.  I have to be close...I'm just missing something.  Help!!      (Some of the possible equations used are dP/dt = kP, P(0) = Po, P(t) = Poe^(kt), and dP/dt = kP(1 - (P/K)).)

20090220122024AARL5fg	Science & Mathematics;Other - Science	Ok, for all you believers in Evolution what is the scientific status of "survival of the fittest"?	Do you believe that the weak among the human race should be eliminated so that only those with a superior gene pool will procreate and cause the evolution of a superior human species?  For those of you who are also social liberals how does Evolution address that question and should we eliminate the "inferior" amongst us?     Religion and the Torah (Old Testament) believe that all humans are possessed with a Neshama (soul).  You Evolutionists believe that we are another species of animal.  An ape with superior intelligence.  So if we are only animals not possessed with a G-d given Soul then why not eliminate the weaker amongst us so that our species can evolve?

20090203013524AAYWOcF	Science & Mathematics;Biology	What is DNA extraction?	Strawberry DNA Extraction   Many people assume that because DNA is so small, we can't see it without powerful microscopes, and we can't extract it from living organisms without complicated and expensive laboratory equipment. However, this is not true. Below, we have outlined a simple experiment showing how DNA can be extracted from a strawberry and made visible to the naked eye.   All living things have DNA: the chemical instructions on how to make a living thing. It can easily be seen with the naked eye when collected from thousands of cells. This simple method allows you to extract DNA from a strawberry and view it.     Materials   * Strawberries (5 pcs.)   * Zip-closure sandwich bags   * DNA extracting solution (mix about 6 ml of liquid detergent and 2 grams of table salt into 100 ml of water) * Cheesecloth * Rubber bands * Test tubes * Droppers * Rubbing alcohol * Paper towels     Procedure   1. Place a strawberry in a zip-closure bag and remove most of the air before you seal the bag.  2. Mash the strawberry through the bag in your hand. Do not hit against the table.   3. Add 30 ml of the DNA extracting solution   4. Continue mixing and mashing the bag in your hand.   5. Place a piece of cheesecloth over the opening of a 150-ml beaker, securing it with a rubber band.   6. Carefully pour the strawberry mixture into the beaker making sure to catch the solids with the gauze.   7. Take a dropper full of the liquid in the cup and place in the test tube.   8. Add a dropper full of the alcohol to the test tube. Take care not to tilt or tip the test tube; do not mix the two liquids.   9. Observe the line between the strawberry mixture and the alcohol. You will notice a white thread-like cloud appearing at this line. This is strawberry DNA. The DNA will clump together and float to the top of the alcohol layer.     Please help me answer the following:    What does DNA stand for?   What does DNA do?   Why do we use the dishwashing liquid?   Why do we use the salt?   What does the alcohol contribute to the experiment?     much thanks!

If we draw an evolutionary tree graph representing the development of big bang theory, red shift is the single point of origin. If hypothetically, demonstrable proof of at least one other cause of red shift emerged then we would not know the difference between relative motion and that one other cause in which case, virtually 100% of big bang theory would rest upon a compromised presumptive interpretation.      1. Is red shift the winner of the presumptive interpretation challenge by process of elimination of all other known possible causes, or is it the presumptive interpretation because it best fits the aggregate theory?      ... and if is the best fit then...      2. Name one other theory founded on a presumptive interpretation because it best fit the desired result that any scientific community has ever generally accepted as credible.
