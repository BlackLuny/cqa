HFrsH9MRaa	The number one cause of trouble like this on a BMW is a clogged up throttle plate and idle air control valve. Locate and clean these items with butyl cellosolve or Gum-out spray. Also, make sure that there are no holes in the PCV hose(s). With age, this is very common as oil vapors are toxic and eventually rot rubber. Hopefully, you have been smart enough to use only Mobil One or ELF oil in your Bimmer. If not,swear off of all regular dino oils and switch over.  Gas mileage and engine longevity will be your reward. Most BMW owners swear by the new ELF formulations. It cleans out and protects your hydraulic valve lifters and hydraulic timing chain tensioner, among other things. Letting your engine "suck in" some of the Gum-out should clear out any carbon spots in your exhaust system. Feel free to E-mail me back with your results!! Good Luck!!|`|uwRkw4vmaa	The light you are in question about is referred to as the MIL indicator, or the (malfunction Indicator Lamp).

The lenses are coated with a chemical called a "hard coat" from the factory.  This coating slowly erodes from road debris impacts.  The bottom line is that this is not a stain on the surface of the lens but rather the actual chemestry of the lens material is degrading.  Even if it is possible to remove the layer of degraded material, this would result in an unprotected lens that would very quickly degrade again.  I suggest finding used lamps through a salvage yard or a body shop.  There are also aftermarket lamps available from internet retailers.  These aftermarket lamps are not quite as goood as OEM lamps, but they are close and are MUCH less expensive.  I suggest 1A auto parts.  Good luck.

bf7e5158fcc3432d92ed4db83be63d4faa	More than likely you will need an aftermarket floor shifter specifically made for an automatic transmission.

It is easier to convert manual tranny vehicles to automatic, than it is to convert automatic tranny vehicles to standard shift trannys.    Is your manual tranny the same exact length as the automatic tranny you want to install?    Does this help any?

Why London busses in particular?

La Caja Negra esta recubierta con materiales altamente resistentes a prueba de golpes, incendios y explosiones, su estructura esta recubierta con titanio y acero y pueden resistir presiones, altas temperaturas y fuerzas de gravedad. Tambin puede emitir se?ales electrnicas hacia el exterior hasta 1.000 metros (1 kilmetro) debajo del agua por un periodo de alrededor de 1 mes con el fin de facilitar su localizacin.    Las cajas negras no guardan nicamente las grabaciones de radio sino un total de mas de 100 parmetros distintos como la altitud y velocidad de crucero, la aceleracin vertical, las conversaciones en cabina, temperatura, estado del motor y dispositivos mecnicos y electrnicos.. Con todos estos datos es posible reconstruir casi a la perfeccin todos los hechos de un accidente valorando la trayectoria que sigui el avin, su rumbo, etc..    .Espero te sea de utilidad    Saludos|`|60ccff966b57500dd8feb3e57f0ca5feaa	de madera para que floten en el mar

O addirittura la 500 Abarth!|`|bC2nZBS1aa	Ciao,  l'Astra OPC  sicuramente una gran bella macchina tuttavia predilige molto le strade lisce, infatti il suo assetto, messo a punto dai tecnici Lotus mica dal primo pinco palla, ha il "vizio" di copiare molto la strada con il risultato di far perdere un bel po' di precisione allo sterzo (come se galeggiasse sulle asperit) ma  solo una sensazione perch la vettura  dotata di un ottima tenuta di strada.  Il problema si riduce adottando pneumatici pi corsaioli. Inoltre sempre a causa del suo assetto "pistaiolo" accelerando sulle asperit si avverte un consistente strappo (la macchina tende a girare a dx o sx a seconda del fondo stradale) a causa dei trasferimenti di coppia di cui il suo motore  riccamente fornito, bisognerebbe quindi tenre ben salde le redini (il volante) quando si lanciano al galoppo i suoi cavalli.  Prima dell'uscita della Mazda 3 MPI la tedesca era la vettura pi potente della categoria. Ma la giapponese non eguaglia la raffinatezza telaistica della tedesca quindi io non ci farei troppi voli pindarici.  Concludendo, se sei pronto a sudare per domare tutti i cavalli della OPC prendila pure altrimenti orientati su qualche modello pi docile.  P.S. il numero del mensile EVO tratta proprio della tua OPC.|`|1pzXdGpXaa	secondo me non  male...io ho il modello 1.3 CDTI 90 CV ed  una bomba...la opc sar molto ma molto meglio...Forse pu batterla la Grande Punto Abarth (1.4 benzina invece del 1.6 della corsa) e come velocit siamo sempre l...paragona un po tra le due auto cmq io ti consiglierei la Corsa...Ottima scelta...

YJDJO3XLaa	Car is the worst investment. Most of the time people are upside down on it, unless it's paid off. People always lose money on it (unless driving it for 10 years). Yours is not a huge loss - of course, if you can afford to lose that amount. Just accept cash the loss and get a new car and make the payments on the new car. Like you said, more you waiting, the older the car gets, you won't really win much $ back on it and than you will have to find an other buyer, which is not easy all the time..|`|AA11914369	If you think the best way to get out  of debt is to add more, then go ahead and roll over what you owe into a new loan.  If you don't, accelerate your payments until your current car breaks even, sell it to get out from under it, paying it off, and buy something used for cash that you can afford.|`|8GDBr2U9aa	Never roll negative equity into another loan!

Since you are able to get the newer car for $2000 less than it goes for, you are essentially saving some money (not as much as you would like, but certainly less). You are right about one thing, even if you pay down the old car some more, it will still depreciate since you still have to drive it everyday. Make sure to have a mechanic double check the car you plan to purchase. You want to make sure you are moving on to another car that is in good condition before you make the final decision.|`|c22cd3bc80b769e97ac9ae2bc60d368eaa	Sounds like you got a good offer for your current car even you don't want to take a loss.  So, if you keep it longer, will it all of a sudden increase in value?  Or do you expect someone to pay $4600 for a less than $3300 car?  The bank is willing to finance you.  Can you afford the new payment?  Apparently the bank thinks so.  & yep, a coupe will be a pain with a car seat.  Tell hubby he's gonna be the one putting baby in the seat everytime you go somewhere.

If you have an electric fan (likely), see if it's working by connecting the wires to the battery. You should know if your electric fan is working though, you can hear them turn on automatically. If it's not an electric fan, but a belt driven fan, then most likely your radiator is losing it's flow rate due to age and deposits. You might check your thermostat. I throw mine out of my vehicles. Also, you can check if you have the air conditioning radiator infront of the radiator, that it's not clogged with leaves, seeds, paper, or anything that might be sucked onto it. But as you say that it's normal when moving, the increased airflow cooling it down, then it's the fan that's the culprit.  |`|YTDvKGdnaa	You could have three problems with this. First I would look at the cooling fan and make sure it is coming on. If it is a clutch fan make sure it is not worn out. Second You can have a thermostat sticking but will open when driving. When the car is hot carefully touch the upper radiator hose and then the bottom the temperature should be the same. Third this is very rare of this type of symptom but your radiator could be restricted.  If every thing else looks fine suspect radiator and make sure you have correct amount of coolant. :)

In most states the old rule has *finally* become law.  In other states the law requires a carseat be used 'properly'... which means by the book.  Your booklet says 1yr and 20 pound is the minimum... so again you would be breaking the law.  I don't think there are many places where you are going to be able to get an 'ok' on turning him around legally for two more months even if you decide to ignore the current recommendations for safety's sake.    I know having a rear facing convertable seat in a truck is a bit challenging... but it can be done.  I've done it... it is not comfy, but it is possible.

nP92OdBzaa	How did the engine sound when the car started after a few minutes?  A blown gasket usually would not make the engine make a rattling sound.  The fact that yo're loosing oil is a concern. When the engine started again and made some wierd noises, it could be that you have internal engine damage.    Without seeing it it's hard to say. Just the fact there was oil everywhere and a puddle underneath is bad. When you blow a gasket all that happens is the engine will leak oil, but it shouldn't die or make noises. In order for oil to be all over, something could have broken in the cylinder head and punched a hole in the valve cover (the top part of the engine)  Ask the mechanic to show you on the engine what he is talking about. Like that he won't just throw technical terms at you    Is the color of the oil kinda reddish? If yes, it's tranni fluid. Then it could be a problem with your torque converter.    Good luck. And don't be shy to ask the mechanic to explain if you don't understand what he tells you.|`|DV4xyeChaa	gasget blowing out usually caused by lack of coolant,,lack of oil causing overheating  2 has it ever been tuned up..if its not running on all cylinders it can push raw gas into catalic converter causing back fire blowing up engine and converter..  3 unless you love the car its finished as it needs 1500 to 3000 work..|`|57129a726b95061531a862a37ebbea17aa	could be a gasket which is a sela between two parts bolted together or an oil line or simply the oil filter or oil drain bolt was not tightened.

At about 35 mph on a left turn, the front end shimmies. It doesn't shimmy at any other time. It seems that the right front dips down when it happens and the right front shock seems a little soft. Could a weak shock cause this condition? Ethel     Ray: It's possible, but unlikely, Ethel. But since it's a 1976 Capri, we can't rule out anything. You could have a weak shock, a weak spring, or a grossly underinflated tire. But it could easily be something much worse. The right front wheel might be getting ready to fall off.     Tom: So--as with all other shimmies and shakes in the front end--it's imperative that you get a mechanic to give the front end a very thorough inspection.     Ray: If I had to guess, I'd say the most likely cause of this type of shimmy is a bad tie rod end. The tie rods are the metal rods that actually push and pull the front wheels when you turn the steering wheel. At the end of each tie rod, there are ball and socket joints called tie rod ends. And if one of the tie rod ends wears out, it could allow that wheel to wobble under certain conditions...like when you drive! But that's not the worst of it. If one of these tie rod ends breaks, you lose complete control of the car.     Tom: So you absolutely must get it looked at soon by a good mechanic. I realize this is only a beat up, old '76 Capri, and you probably don't have any feelings for it anymore, Ethel. But think about all the NICE cars you might smash into if the tie rod end does break! 1215|`|DV4xyeChaa	1 wheel balance  2 tir rod ends  3 ball joints  4 CB radio did not cause the problem  [sorry i can't help it]

The compressor will turn it's self off if it does not have enough refirgerant pressor. This is very easy to check:  1) Open the hood and locate your compressor  2) Start the engine and then go and look at the compressor and listen to it and remember the sound.  3) Now go back into the car and turn on the air conditioner.  4) Go back and check the compressor, you now should here the difference, and the engine will also sound like it is under a load (this is due to the engine having to run the compressor)  5) Now wait for about 5 minutes, if you hear the compressor disengage then you are low on your refrigerant.    If you decide you are low and if it is a newer car after Dec 31, 1995, then you can "recharge" your refirgerant yourself. Just go to your local parts store and ask them what you would need. It is really easy to do. But if the car is before 1996 or you just don't want to do it yourself then you will need to go to a service area.  The cost should be less then $80.00    Now the bad news. refirgerant does not wear out. If it is low then that means you have a leak. Most of the newer R-134 refirgerants come with a sealer which can fix most very small leaks and I would suggest trying this first. But if it happens again then you will need to take the car to a service center and have them do a leak test. This is done by injecting a dye, that shows up under a blacklight, into the refirgerant, then you drive for a few days and bring the car back, upon which they look for the leak by using a blacklight. My guess is a loss connector.  Hope this helps, cheers....  Rick

89fe044c4d20ad11caa431bd83c3e20eaa	There are a number of possibilities, and they range from a cheap easy fix to possibly more than the car is worth.  The first question would be how long has it been since the spark plugs were changed?  If they are worn out, they may still create enough spark for the car to run in warm-up mode (most cars add extra gas for the first few minutes to help the engine run better until it has been able to warm up), but not afterward.  Otherwise, it could be a failing fuel pump, which is inside the gas tank for most fuel injected cars and is a pain to change (you have to deal with rusty bolts and drop the gas tank to get at the pump).  Another possibility is a malfunctioning sensor, because most cars don't use all the sensors while in the initial "warm up" mode.  These are just a few possibilities I could think of without actually personally seeing what the car is doing.  If the check engine light turns on when the car starts acting up, some auto parts stores will hook up a diagnostic computer for you and read the error codes stored in the computer, but not all of them do so call and ask.  I hope this helps!|`|825df5adf6b3a70e8df648249cb811f7aa	if the engine runs normally when the car is not moving then the best guess is the clutch, when is cold there is enough viscosity to move the car but when it reach the operating temperature then the rotors expanding and slipping|`|b673c54fa0d9c49a980b20e0b96d7843aa	if it revs up when you give it gas its more than likly the clutch and if it spits and sputters and acts like its running out of gas its the fuel pump or fuel filter and depending on if the pump is in the gas tank it might not be worth replacing

AA11220927	It depends on where you live and what vehicles you want to drive. In Europe and i think in some states in America you can get ultra low sulfur diesel fuel. This is a cleaner version of the old dirty diesel. In some places however diesel fuel is dirty and the road tax for it double or triples compared to gasoline engines is you have a private vehicle. Commercial vehicle gets subsidized tax break.  Moder diesel engine have more torque, more horsepower and more miles per gallon compared to ordinary gasoline engines for example a BMW 320i has a gasoline engine producing 150 hp and 200 nm of torque, compared that with a BMW 320d which produces 163 hp and 320nm of torque. Diesel engine naturally offer more power in the lower RPM. Instead of revving to 6000rpm for 200nm of torque in gasoline engine, a diesel engine need only 2000rpm to produce 320nm of torque. That is drivability for ordinary people.  If I am not mistake a Volkswagon Lupo can do close to 100 miles per gallon but in reality you can get like 70mpg in combined city/highway drives with its 1.4 Tdi engine producing 80hp and 143lb ft of torque. Or in the US you can get a Volkwagon Golf Tdi 1.9L with 105hp with 189lb ft or torque that 40 mpg in a combined cycle.    For some people diesels are still smelly and icky which lead us to good old fashion gasoline engine. Usually subcompact cars and compact cars with a 4 cylinder engine provides the best fuel economy. A Toyota Yaris Subcompact car with 1.5 L engine does 37 mpg combined driving while its brother Toyota Corolla compact car with 1.8L engine does  36 mpg. Gasoline is more accepted by the public and is available almost anywhere in the world.    Hybrids are vehicles that has an efficient gasoline engine that is coupled with an electric motor. The electric motor drives the car at low speeds and gives the car neccesary boost when overtaking or accelerating. This type of car work best in stop and go crawling traffic because the electric motor is doing all the driving at low speeds but it is useless in the highway where the heavy batteries weigh the vehicle down. The Toyota Prius does 60 mpg in the CITY while 51 mpg in the highway and does 55 mpg. Hybrids are also more expensive. Although it saves more fuel it will takes up to 4 years till the differences in fuel economy savings is worth.    So choose wisely.|`|6a48621693ddb95b8d80086a7af66a5caa	New Honda Civic, Honda Fit and some Volkswagen diesels.|`|a7ff7e9c125295c5f6688c1859a91142aa	Gasoline engines burn gas they dont save it.|`|aa05e29887483c6fd913f18cb1a20026aa	there are plenty of cars that are nice and decent cars that save alot of gas....but there mostly like jettas, volkswagon, geometro, saturn, jeeps.....forgot one there is hybribs too|`|b334e21468b3e7b490b6d769a92bf8d0aa	I kinda impressed with the Hyundai line, They have an excellent warranty, and good on gas, they also have some nice looking models out now.

41f4c07b76e1599b2fce4ea6a1bfed44aa	It could be that there is some air in the cooling system and this is causing the temperature sensor to get a false high reading (at least everything else seems to be working okay and the fan cuts in).  This is the trouble when Peugeot decide to save a few pounds and just fit an on/off switch rather than a temperature gauge!  Another thing could be a build-up of corrosion on the inside of the radiator.  I would try a cooling system flush and then emptying out the radiator and refilling with 75% water/25% antifreeze.  You should be able to do this yourself.

Like the answer above said though you could reasonably swap in b18c from a GSR integra. K20 is what a lot of really high power honda guys are running. but since you already have an si it would make more sense to mod your current engine which has plenty of potential then spend 1000+ on a swap, thats  if you can even find a decent priced engine.    and come on man acura=honda  please know what your talking about before you answer someone.|`|27a97f47d8c99e2837e4d1a9c3b49347aa	i would probably put a subaru WRX engine in it if it would fit... lol if not just customize the engine i have heard that acura has better performing engines i dont kno if tats true|`|15b7b5c1a346cccc2a1850d1fe7f6cb1aa	A 1999 honda civic engine......if you want power buy displacement.....buy american....|`|1612576b9d8f0ce7e38a2cec2a3a677faa	WRX engine....wow....anyways....You can always swap to a GSR, Type R, H22 or if you have really deep pockets a K20.

AA11965197	The alignment is the key factor in the vehicle which not only reduces wear and tear of tires but also gives you fuel economy. The steps are as under.  1. Go to a alignment centre.  2. Check that thereis no maint work required, the alignment person will tell you if you require change of any bushes.  3. Then comes the balancing of your wheels, this removes if there is any bubling in the car. The do it by putting appropriate weights on tires.  4. Then comes the Camber adjustment which will correct if there is any pulling problem. to left or right.  Finally allignment of fron wheels.  5. Alignment of rear wheels.

6e3ef0af8c9db4865e16c0fa275f7f7faa	O Nascimento do Automvel  Se algum lhe perguntar quem inventou o automvel, o que voc responderia? Carl Benz, Henry Ford, Gottlieb Daimler? Se responder qualquer nome, est errado, porque o automvel tal como a humanidade  fruto de um processo evolutivo, sendo seus predecessores o carro puxado a cavalos, no qual foi montado um motor a vapor, que inventaram um jeito de parar, aumentar a potncia, fabricar em srie...,etc  Assim como a humanidade deixou o aspecto simiesco, o carro foi perdendo sua semelhan?a com as carruagens.   No sculo XIX, surgem as primeiras carruagens sem cavalos, movidas a vapor e t?o barulhentas e lentas que desanimariam qualquer um! Mas, os inventores s?o "pessoas"que pertencem a uma categoria diferente dos outros simples mortais, s?o persistentes a ponto de serem taxados de "lunticos", "doidos"e outros adjetivos menos publicveis. Gra?as a essa persistncia a partir de 1830, foram aperfei?oados veculos eltricos alimentados por baterias, mais "rpidos e "silenciosos", mas que tinham o inconveniente de n?o poder percorrer longas distancias porque lgicamente dependiam de carga das baterias.|`|682bd66041beee460eb8b53dc1f0ab4faa	O carro foi inventado como uma carro?a movida a vapor, como algum falou a, mas o carro fechado com carenagem como + ou menos ns conhecemos hoje, foi inventado por Henry Ford, inclusive foi ele quem inventou os motores de explos?o interna como os nossos de hoje, n?o lembro a data direito mas j fazem mais de 50 anos que estamos queimando gasolina!!!|`|109d9302264aed9e6d49b9e05e095de7aa	N?o sei exatamente quem inventou mas sei que n?o foi Henry Ford com ctz.

O mito de Atlantida contada pelo filsofo grego Plat?o, descrevia um povo muito evoludo etnologicamente e conta-se que usavam carruagens sem cavalos. Com a inven??o do motor a vapor, j no sculo XVIII o militar francs Nicolas Joseph Cugnot (1771) (pag. internet url http://www.solbrilhando.com.br/_Automove... equipou uma carro?a sendo o primeiro veculo auto propulsiondo conhecido, e da foi at o carro moderno que todos sabemos ainda est evoluindo.

Tem tambm Ferdinand Verbiest, que nasceu onde hoje  a Fran?a, e que em 1678 montou um carrinho  vapor para o Imperador da China.   Cugnot, em 1769 fez uma carruagem  vapor j com quatro rodas, mas os sistemas de dire??o n?o estavam bem desenvolvidos.  Em 1870, Siegfried Marcus aplicava um motor  gasolina numa carro?a e em 1885, Benz patenteava o primeiro automvel  gasolina consruido como tal.   Quatro rodas e motor  gasolina apareceram em 1886 na Inglaterra com Fredericl William Lanchester, que tambm patenteou o freio  disco.  Porsche, com seu modelo Lowner-porsche de tra??o nas quatro rodas foi o primeiro  fazer um modelo hbrido (com motor  gasolina e quatro eltricos).   Em 1908, Ford produzia nos EUA os primeiros veculos em srie, e em 1912 a Cadillac inaugurava o self-starter, que dava partida no motor sem o auxlio da manivela, tinha pedais para acelerador, embreagem e freios, o que o torna muito parecido com os automveis atuais.|`|915b19085d2eb4fe92332780aa7bbd9eaa	Cinco sculos depois de sua morte, cientistas italianos finalmente conseguiram interpretar o projeto de Leonardo da Vinci para um carro, e recri-lo. A inven??o  considerada um precursor do automvel moderno.     O projeto de uma carro?a que se move por si s e que aparece no Codex Atlanticus - um dos cadernos de notas de Leonardo da Vinci - sempre intrigou estudiosos, em parte porque a documenta??o estava incompleta.     Agora, especialistas em Floren?a, na Itlia, conseguiram recriar o carro idealizado pelo mestre renascentista e faz-lo funcionar. O resultado  um veculo de madeira de um metro que pode se mover sozinho e est em exposi??o no Museu de Histria da Cincia de Floren?a at junho.

Potente, n?o te deixa na m?o na estrada...    IPVA - R$ 180,00    seguro - coloque uma corrente e cadeado, e um bom alarme    Verifique assim que comprar: troque leo, filtros, velas e correia dentada (tudo isso custa R$ 180,00 em mdia)       E quando for vender, vai vender pelo mesmo pre?o...     (PS: ja tive Gol, Celta, Corsa, Kadett, Santana, Tipo, chevette, fusca, fiesta, Palio. De todos, o Uno (economia e potencia) e o Tipo (pelo conforto) foram os melhores)    Celta: beberr?o, motor bate com 50 mil km.    Palio Young e outros multiponto com motor FIASA: bons carros, mas beberr?es (minha irm? tem um 2001, faz 8 /12 por litro de gasolina).    Gol: os 2 que eu tive, (um 1.6 AP e outro 1.6 Ford) trincaram o chassis...

Kadett: bom carro, manuten?a? cara e beberr?o    Chevette : beberr?o, fraco de motor mas barato pra manter    FUSCA: apertado, mas anda at com arame. N?o  t?o econ?mico.

Levando em considera??o que o pneu que eu coloquei possui uma rea de contato com o solo bem maior que o original,era p/acontecer tudo ao contrrio do que eu senti.E olha que isso tudo em piso seco porque no molhado ele humilha!

Falando srio....Hoje, os elevadores tem vrios dispositivos de seguran?a, inclusive freios laterais, caso o motor princpal falhe.  Antigamente era possvel elevadores despencarem. Tinham um  sistema precrio em que funcionavam apenas com um cabo de a?o e um motor. caso houvesse falha do motor ou ruptura do cabo ai o dito cujo vinha descendo livremente at chegar ao solo. Para evitar uma queda direta, usavam um sistema de molas para amortecer a queda e evitar danos maiores, mesmo assim, algumas vidas eram perdidas.  Hoje, a moderna engenharia, projeta elevadores seguros, com freios, parada rpida em caso de queda.....  Se voc usa elevadores hoje, fique em paz....    Abra?os
