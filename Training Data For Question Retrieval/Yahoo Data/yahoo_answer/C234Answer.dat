m2aznd8xaa	yea bloating is a pregnancy symptom but you should still wait a bit. then take the test again. the best test you can take are the ones that say they can detect if your pregnant 5 days after your missed period. so maybe you are and it too early to tell. wait a week and do it again if not see your dr.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Maybe but it could be PMS. I know you said you've never been bloated like this but not two periods are ever alike and your body changes all the time. I hope you are pregnant but it could also be a period. I'll cross my fingers for you.|`|E7TkNO00aa	If you are pregnant, congratulations. The symptoms you have been feeling point to PREGNANT. However, I think it is possible for a pregnancy test to not work properly.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	I felt that way and was pregnant, but really early pregnancy symptoms and PMS are so insanely similar it is really difficult. You are the only one that can tell if the symptoms are different or unusual for YOU. And yes, you could still be pregnant even if the test came up negative. Wait and test in a few days with morning urine.|`|n86P8yccaa	probably just your period but you never know|`|0NbSSd7kaa	iam also feeling the same as u hunny......i have had unprotected sex ths montharound my ovulation time and had a one week irregular period that only lasted two days while my period is 4days.....and now am so bloated and feeling a lil nauseated i hope we are pregnant.Baby dust sweetie
AA11795652	Depends.  I pushed for two hours with my first child and with my second child I only had to give 3 big pushes and he was out in less than 7 minutes.  But, the actual part of once the baby's head comes out and then the rest of the body comes out only takes minutes.  You still have to push out the placenta after-wards too which is usually called the after-birth.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	It's hours usually...well more like days for most women. Every woman is different so...|`|k9nLue0Uaa	well you could be in labor for hours!!!!!!!!! But I think the actual birth part is between 5-15  mins.. not sure|`|aqto0hJTaa	Hours.    Lots of them.|`|kcGFK36Waa	I was in labor for 20 hours, but pushed for just 15 minutes.|`|i8Ch743Laa	My actual pushing/birth was 2 hours and 45-50 minutes, I was really close to an emergency c-section. 10 minutes away actually.|`|XwjL8PZCaa	MINUTES!!!!!! haha I was in labor for 15 1/2 hours and pushed for over 2 just to have a c-section, I don't know you count the minutes 17 1/2 hours!! plus some for the c-section some people are in labor for DAYS!!!|`|T9fek24eaa	Well it depends. Labor usually lasts for HOURS. I was in labor for 9 hours with my first, I have known women that were in labor for DAYS! But on the other hand I have known women that were in labor for 1 hour. Then the actual delivery... again it depends. My daughter took 3 hours of pushing before she was born, but I have also heard of people pushing 3 times and the baby was out. Every woman is different.|`|24P6A0oaaa	I was in labor for 15 hours and pushed for 3 more hours and baby wouldnt come out, then I had to have a c section|`|Gr78AFvyaa	man...if it was minutes im sure a lot more women would be having babies!!|`|AA10754660	mine was 4 hours but i heard the longest was 3 days and the shortest 30 seconds...depends on the woman
OzPehAR7aa	I *accidentally* let out a burp while giving a science lesson to my students today. I know.. it was hilarious.. silly middle schoolers.|`|ojTcrqAOaa	Well..  My friend,Emir,(guy)came up to me and my friend,Sarah,(girl)randomly and said,   "Morgann, I love you" to me..and I was like, "Aha, I love you too" and he said to my friend(his friend too), "I f*cking hate you!" :P  `Course he was kidding.    And me and Sarah messed with Emirs lunch at lunch when he went to get dressing for his salad.   And, Sarah said it was me and I said, "No! It was Sarah!" and I went to dump my tray and Emir thought I said Sierra, and he was like, "SIERRA!!!" and looked at her angrily:P   And Sarah and I bursted out laughing.     Haa.|`|kRaVa0Wraa	my lacrosse coaches 4 year old daughter told me that she has "2 boy sisters" and that her cat "got surgery to get his boys taken off."      HAHAHHA she's so cute.|`|k31jFSd0aa	Yesterday when we were changing classes i was walking with my friend and we were laughing, and my school is very crowded.  When we were going down the stairs I SNORTED like a pig! and almost everyone on the stairs turned around to look at me, embarrassing but funny.|`|QVXKSxBNaa	We wear a skirt at school (we have a uniform) and I put on my P.E shorts under my skirt in the change rooms. I'm a freshman and there were 2 juniors there. I took my skirt off when my shorts were on, and then realised that the shorts came off as well. So I stood there oblivious for like 20 seconds, while the other 2 girls were pretending not to notice. So embarrassing. That was on Thurs.    I also snorted 2 times that day when I was laughing and there were really, really cute guys behind me, and my other friend was laughing so hard at me :( lol.     Oh yeah, I had a laughing fit in my math class, because my friend said "Whenever we go to hotels we steal there pens. Right now we are stocked up ." They just went to canada about 2 weeks ago. No one laughed except me, and my teacher was getting so peeved at me haha. I couldn't stop laughing, especially the way she said it! hahha. That was yesterday. haha. I find it funny, because we go to a private school, and she can afford this, yet steals pens from hotels hahah! But I completely understand because who doesn't steal pens form hotels? I know I do, but the way she said it, was like "It was normal to steal 1 billion pens instead one on the odd occassion". haha.|`|Q08GpskDaa	My friend made up a fake conversation that me and my crush would someday have (who I have uttered maybe, like, 6 words to). It was really funny.|`|y96eYj0Faa	Well, today we had an essay due. But my friend Ann didn't finish it! She only had half of it done, but she told my teacher she can present the rest of it to him orally. She said "I don't have the rest of it but I can give it to you orally Mr. Dan!" But my teacher said "no, I don't want it orally" "You know how I like it! You know I don't like it orally!" LMAO. This went on for about 5 minutes. My teacher haha was clueless at first but then he couldn't believe he was having this conversation with a student. Then he just pretnded like nothing weird was going on. hahahah! You had to be there.    Haha if you are in high school you will get it.
11SCey7Xaa	Yeah i would sounds crazy but he is her father may not be the best role model but your daughter is going to have to learn the truth about what his father does. Not so much now but later in life.|`|9mMXYCX4aa	your husband needs arrested!!!! no i would never let him so the kid and i would divorce his butt off.!!|`|U1s25amAaa	HELL NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!i would send him to jail!thats kind of a stupid question.you dont even have to think about that!what if he drugged her?|`|4bWUiIVdaa	Hell, no!!|`|bpyx92GZaa	Absolutely not...that's a dumb question. I call the cops on him and put his azz in prison. Have you heard of stories about drug dealers so high that they give their children drugs and they sit there an laugh about it....GROW UP, you know better...grrrrrrrrrrrr!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|XFZmAMOAaa	Uhh...no.Not a good role model.|`|twVyisGnaa	No, I would not if I was a female with a 10 month old daughter.  A dude with that much trouble with drugs might be a mental and health danger to the child and the daughter is WAY too young to be sick.  I really hope you're not dealing with this kind of thing right now.    VIVA LA RAZA!|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	lol thats MY ex..and NO I had all of his rights removed . He isnt allowed near us..because he is a loser. But I do take the money for the 6 kids and smile  You do have to prove it though|`|AYkEwqRXaa	Well in my case, it would be my daughter's mother and there is no way in hell I would let that happen.|`|UspK4SQBaa	No, but then this person wouldn't be my daughter's father either.|`|e158WyFGaa	NOOO DIVORCE COMES IN HANDY     you dont want your daughter to be "inspired:" and want to be that.|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	Even with a bad rap sheet like that, I still wouldn't deny him the privilege to see his child. He just would have to be in my presence when she's with him.|`|FupqCfK0aa	Wait until she is old enough to understand what he's going through.|`|rDsKB0uXaa	No not without police lol|`|1ezYfkX7aa	I have to agree with maria...no i wouldnt let my child see him but then again...i wouldnt of slept and gotten pregnant with someone like that.|`|HOdblqIkaa	definitely not thats a horrible idea  she shouldnt have anything to do with him until he cleans up his act  any mother who would even consider it needs to reevaluate her parenting skills.|`|GtV7iwBlaa	UH UH!!heck to the no.lol.|`|FRpkuABlaa	No! What kind of a mother lets her baby be around a druggie?|`|oXnlk1yOaa	no...not unsupervised.|`|AA11490975	Hell to the No|`|FjiRPKp2aa	If he still does it HECK NO!|`|bYU77eteaa	I would invite him over on the weekend...or do things together.  I would explain to him that until he gets clean things aren't going to be the way he might want them and if he gots a problem with it then take you to court (I promise he will loose and if you dont already got child support on him, he will have it after that)    You may need him to be around so you dont want him to be completely gone but you need to be supervising that|`|MQCT1FXjaa	No.  what if some drugies comes when shes visiting and fire guns?    not very smart.|`|WchGezIAaa	never. not in a million years.  but i would make sure to explain to the child that it wasn't out of hate, but that she might be in danger being around him.   its never healthy to make a child hate one of their parents. it leads to a lot of mental instability's later on in life.|`|rUQAGz9kaa	I probably owuldnt let him see her alone ,and definatly not on weekends.|`|MPc0kS1vaa	hell no. i would not have had a child with him.|`|SBZOVEueaa	i wouldnt but thats just me -     when he got straight and cleaned up - yeah he could see her anytime    if he ever came around her messed up......he would be lucky if i didnt kill him    so WHY did you go w/this guy?????    you know the father has just as much to do w/the developmental probs of drug babies as the mother right????|`|5FhRoNVUaa	no way mami.  i would try to move as far away as possible from him.  u wouldn't want a guy like that near ur daughter,  would u?|`|UeCgFgucaa	noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo|`|AA11509733	all i got to say is u need a serious change of pace cuz it sounds to me like ur life is wrapped up in alota bad s*it. u have horrible parents, a boyfriend who's dealin, and where does it all end? i ain;t tryin to rip on u, but it sounds to me like u need a break from all this junk. my advic e for everythin i seen thus far is to take ur kids, go sumplace and start a whole new life for urself!|`|83GG2y8gaa	OMG HELL NO!!!|`|0TCFrA7iaa	HECK NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|3ZhwIAn1aa	yeah that's her daddy every kid need to see their father whether he is a good or example so they don't blame you at the end or be called a bastered i would let him see her with conditions that he won't do any of these thing infront of her nor with my supervision|`|c4a36c088096bec045e2051f20d57305aa	maybe if I was a crackhead|`|A3g9X5kKaa	I would call the cops and get sole custody until he was clean, thats not the best environment for her. What would happen if the people he associates with were mad at him while he had the baby?|`|BHgtqH9Yaa	Omg NO!!!|`|96ojhoXvaa	No way!!! What if she was caught up in a gunfight or carjacking..how would you feel then?|`|WUyk9nGEaa	NOO!!!!!!!!!!!|`|NH0vq9Kjaa	no|`|HGdQp8QBaa	NO WAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...  DON'T LET THAT RETARD LAY A FINGER ON HER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|bi9EsTReaa	NOT AT ALL!!! well it depends really  -does he love her  ......if he loved her he would stop doing that crap|`|BvA2NmiGaa	uhm, no . :p|`|Ddd8LDPGaa	are u kidding?|`|cc3bc74da528c9ab08e77b61000dc40faa	If you do that child should be removed from your care, I bet grandpa has hep c too. if he gave a **** he would clean up his act, so obviously he is telling you what is more imprtant. and it is not the child.|`|uslo3SF3aa	NO. Tell the father to change so that he can see her daughter.|`|Z7F6h8t5aa	only a bad mother would send their child into that environment.|`|GpmvgIhJaa	Only an irresponsible idiot mother would allow their child to be around ANYBODY like that. What a stupid question.|`|9903428fd2015f9ab08d494eda08819caa	Not until he grew up and cut the self destructive tendencies out.|`|1kQllt04aa	Yes strictly supervised, no alcohol, no drugs etc allowed If he improves or proves trusted-worthy the more supervised time he's allowed to have.|`|QQI4rliYaa	are you high?|`|WbJPQM1naa	Never unsupervised.  Perhaps only occasionally, if I knew for sure that he was clean and sober.  He most definitely would NEVER transport her anywhere!
XN30YgK8aa	I have used the same method to preparing formula for all brand bottles and it has worked great. I have TWO formula dividers, they are orange and from babies r us. I premeasure out the water for each bottle, leaving them filled with water. I premeasure out the proper amount of formula perfeeding needed into the formula containers and when baby is hungry I simply pour formula into bottles. I found when it came to doctor browns I liked the wide shape ones not the regular ones.|`|rjVALevtaa	I use Dr. Browns bottles as well. But I don't really understand what you're asking, could you elaborate?|`|zQAWuMN4aa	I do not have Dr. Brown's but my very good friend does and she carries around an empty, capped bottle and powdered formula in a dispenser. She just uses warm tap water and fills it to the correct amount and adds the powder then shakes.     I use Avent bottles (they leak) but I personally would NOT use tap water unless a DIRE emergency.|`|QQI4rliYaa	advent is a awsome system that we use try that one.. not sure about dr brown.|`|7U1K0l2laa	Babies R Us sells a formula pitcher.  They are great.  You can prepare 32 ounces.  I think they cost 4 or 5 dollars.  I tired to mix formula in the DBB but there were always chunks.  With the pitcher there are no clumps.
kzyEuRroaa	Oh mama, I know the feeling.  The pain is at times unbearable, but totally normal.  I had a desk job while pregnant with baby number 3, and I'd go to stand up after sitting for a while, and be in tears it hurt so bad to walk, sit, move, anything!   The shooting pains are just your stretched ligaments and joints that have shifted for your baby, even moving slowly and carefully I would still get those jolts of pain.  Use lots of pillows, roll over slowly, and basically grin and bear it, because it's only a matter of time before you're done.  Congrats, and hang in there!!|`|kcGFK36Waa	Oh yes the only reason I wanted my baby out was because of that exact pain. I was so sore and it was painful. I hated it and nothing would make it better I was like that for 10 weeks. Its totally normal though and yes it sucks and hurts really bad.|`|AA11795652	I was the same way.  A very short walk and a few stretches helped me.  Also, sitting on a pillow made it bearable.  And making my husband do everything and help me up and down worked too.  A little Tylenol may help but you're almost there, it's time to get ready.
SUWxxF85aa	sometimes its just for the money, an accident, or because they simply love each other and want to make love and create a baby..but why they dont look after there kids? this may be different for everyone, they might not know what they are doing or simply do not want them, if your one of these kids and your parents arent treating you right you can always go get some help and advice off other people, like call the kids hotline? they would be able to help figure something out, take care buddy xo|`|h59Bc4wfaa	For the same reason people get dogs and leave them outside all day every day.     Their idiots. Some people only have kids to collect a check. Some people only have kids because they want someone to love THEM. Some women even get pregnant just to try and keep a man.    There is always a reason, but the only one I like is that their idiots.
sF3UyQsIaa	how about making either payton or leigh a middle name. how bout grace leigh, or alexis payton. you would still be honoring your sister, while making your own child unique. sorry about the loss. good luck!|`|DdjpQr0Gaa	I think you should name her Payleigh Grace or Payleigh Faith.  I think it is beautiful and a great combo of your sisters name.  It is unique and special and it shows how much she meant to you.  No decent person would give you a negative comment about a name with that special of a meaning and if they do its not worth listening to anyway !  Your first choice is the best|`|Elxuvon8aa	paige Lanae  same letters Perry marina  my daughter used to call herself Phylicia Dawn|`|AA11490722	Payton Grace could be nice.    Eliza Payton Taylor   Payton Alexis Taylor|`|TX9igTWraa	why not leigh and something like grace or faith. that way faith's meaning is like a trust in something or a belief in a higher being so by using your sisters middle name as your daughter first and faith as her middle you could be kind of paying tribute to your sister through your daughter|`|xIF2lShpaa	Just use the name as a middle name and maybe add another and have 2 middle names, your choice.|`|AA10325228	How about Paisley?|`|9vzfI4kDaa	i disagree, i think Payleigh is a nice name and a good honor to your lost sister, sorry about your loss too.|`|AUJPwvUwaa	What about Leighton? I think its a beautiful name and would commemorate your sister well.    You could always use Leigh as a first name and your mother or grandmother's name for the middle.
4a4fc6fd359a16c13169b1185d22b8b7aa	I say Kah-li-ah. Yep, like Carlie with ah on the end :)  PS-Kalia Rose is beautiful!!!   :)|`|xIF2lShpaa	Ka-leah.  I think it is beautiful. I also like Ka-Leah Rain. I have a daughter named Shianne Annette and Liya Mariam. Both of there dads named them, and I think they did a great job!|`|E8kzNG3iaa	I would pronounce it  Kah-LEE-ah (Kah like cat without the T)...  Kalia Rose sounds very sweet!|`|Elxuvon8aa	you need to get an r in there if you want an r sound  Kalia is Kal eah  Kaliah rose is beautiful just do not try to get an r sound where there is none|`|aqto0hJTaa	I'm in the U. S., and there would be no "r" sound in the word at all.    It would be Kay-lee-ah, probably with the accent on the first syllable.|`|87WOSjwgaa	I would pronounce it ka liah. with no r. There is no r in the spelling so the r sound would make no sense
TklfCPh6aa	The more you pump, the more you produce. I pump also so the father can be involved and so I don't feel confined to my home! You can also pump and store it in the freezer (for those nights you wanna have a glass of wine. :-) )|`|ebcfaff0504724aa2ad756522576c3b2aa	The more your breasts produce, the more they produce. You can actually overdo it and have too much milk if you were to pump too much, which can cause engorgement and infection.     Unless your doctor, midwife or lactation specialist specifically recommends pumping to boost your milk supply in the first month, it is best to wait until after the baby's first month in order to start pumping at all. This helps establish a correct milk supply for your baby's needs. And your milk supply can vary greatly. You should have no problem producing enough breastmilk--I've known women who've stated that as their problem ("I'd really like to breastfeed but my supply just wasn't great enough") which is really just code for, "okay, enough back to back feedings and getting absolutely no sleep while my body establishes the milk supply." If you begin supplementing with formula the first month, you'll likely never stop. And that's okay too. As long as baby's healthy and happy, you are likelier to be happy too.|`|PCK5bJt3aa	I had a Medela Pump swing, it was tiny and portable (I didn't have to lug a big bag around like other breast pumps) It got out a lot of milk but my baby just ate too darn much, basic supply and demand and I couldn't keep up. We supplemented with formula and eventually switched just to formula but a breast pump is a good idea if you are determined to breast feed since you can pump and freeze milk or store it in the fridge. Medela makes great breast pumping equipment from microwavable sanitizing bags for your pump to milk storing bags for the fridge, even baby safe sanitizing wipes for your pump..|`|1ezYfkX7aa	My first baby i only pumped for 3months because he was in the nicu and wouldnt latch on...my milk supply was fine sinse i was pumping so much but it drove me crazy and i ended up putting him on formula.|`|AhoB10CTaa	my breast pump was a serious life saver! esp. during the first months when the baby had to eat ALLL the time. and honestly, if anything, i think the breast pump helped me lactate better because i'd pump out way more than my newborn would eat, therefore letting my body know i needed to produce more milk. yayyy for breast pumps!!! :)
e4259abb4e5d0ea5a734423f5be756f9aa	In their book Michelle stated they wait 80 days after the birth of a girl to resume intercourse. If they have a boy it's 40 days.  Since she had a daughter Dec 18 it's still within the 80 days.    If history is any indication, she usually gets pregnant around the time the newest baby is around 7-9 months old.|`|nqcnylFpaa	i believe it is all staged not true i know i will get thumbs down but i don't care|`|K4vGNPZoaa	That is just insane. Why would someone want 19 kids? Doesn't she ever feel like she is something more than a baby machine? Who knows, lets wait and see......|`|Ar6wD9Oeaa	i doubt that b/c she doens't announce her pregnancys until after 3 months when it's in the safe zone.    and she just had that last baby in december. I'm sure we wont be left out if she is.     Maybe her son and his wife are expecting a baby?!?!?1 they have been married for a few months now. Crzy to think she's a mom of an infant and could be a grandma now too!|`|2a2c24fc81bc910e984828a1ab26fd3daa	I sure hope not, I know they were saying while she was in labor with her 19th, that they were talking about having another kid.  I think they are seriously messed up in the head for having that many kids.  They say they have that many kids because their religion doesn't believe in birth control, but I don't think its for the religion to be having sex constantly either.|`|FRpkuABlaa	I do not like them at all, they remind me of a creepy family that once lived down the road from me.     She needs to stop popping out kids, its annoying how they are always in the media when there are more important things to talk about.|`|s4LWmcTjaa	Oh Lord I hope not!  I think she needs to call it a quits there.|`|EtCRnDJMaa	has it even been 6 weeks yet?  I don't think she's that stupid      and if she was, they don't tell anyone until she is about 13 or 14 wks along.        Texas Momma:  I sent you an email!|`|14JQ11AUaa	I thought she just gave birth to her 18th this January??|`|bf2b826fb186efa4963970654d24ac34aa	I want to know how she keeps popping them out without her uterus falling out too!  I have a distant cousin who had 5 children (somewhat close together) all naturally and the doctor told her having another one would be very bad for her uterus as it would likely slide out along with the next baby. She actually ended up needing a hysterectomy before baby 5 was a year old. This woman must have a cast iron uterus!
jG8b3Mz0aa	I'm feeling exactly like you. I am not dilated at all, my son is very high and I just am getting very discouraged. Other mommies on here and ones I know have already had their babies and it seems like I'm still stuck here with no progress. Not to mention my sister was due 2 days before me and she had my nephew this past Monday. The only good at the end of the tunnel for me, is my doctor said if I happened to still be pregnant by next appointment (which is Tuesday), we will go on with a scheduled induction. Although I am terrified about that honestly because I had my daughter naturally and I heard receiving Pitocin brings your contractions on very hard and fast (almost to a point where you need an epidural) or what if I don't progress at all; then I will need a C-Section. Don't worry honey, I'm right there with you. Hope you feel better and I'll try to send some labor dust your way.|`|70anKWbNaa	wait for your baby to arrive can seem live forever, but just try to get as much rest as you can because once your baby gets  here you will be on the move non stop.  I had 2 children to raise while i was waiting on  3 which helped pass time but i also bought a book and just had some quite reading time|`|nHpd4lRXaa	Well I was exactly 41 weeks with my son when I went into labour completely naturally and unassisted. It is still possible, and very likely, make sure you are doing things to encourage labour. Squats, sex, walking, nipple stimulation is what sent me into labour.|`|DnBMRRXaaa	i felt the same way!!   then it was this past monday night where i was like man doc apt tomorrow and we are going to talk about inducing since i would be 40 weeks and 2 days. woke up tuesday and my water broke at 7 and i had my baby boy at 1024  soo just when you think it wont happen....IT DOES!!  try not to stress it go do a bunch of walking try the whole sex thing. and just relax and hope for the best  good luck!|`|aYacThofaa	trust me i kno the feeling im 40 wks. 3 days over due i feel like he is just never gonna come but im going to schedule to be induced at this mondays appt.(not by choice) it sucks i really want him to come on his own but im not even dialated:(|`|76b2313ad607b0e7b0eb85999b17c136aa	just keep in mind that no woman has ever been pregnant forever lol  Both of my kids i went into labor naturally.  With my son i was 41 weeks and my daughter i was 38 weeks.  I'm 37 weeks now :)  Although i am in a lot of pain, i didn't take my doctor up on his offer of inducing me at 38 weeks, i am terrified of pitocin and epidurals lol
SBZOVEueaa	now - is when you should schedule your appt    in fl if you are pregnant - your first appt is based on presumptive medicaid - anyone who is pregnant in fl is eligible for medicaid -     otherwise go to your local health department    call your local medicaid office to check on the status of your application - keep calling until you get someone who knows what they are talking about (in fl DCF determines eligibility for medicaid)    but in any case - get medical care NOW ASAP - and start taking prenatals - dr should give you samples also|`|kaqPSgTVaa	The minute you get your insurance OR you should track down a clinic that doesn't need insurance and start care there. Usually they want to see you starting at about 8-12 weeks.|`|m2aznd8xaa	your supposed to schedule an appointment  as soon as you know you are pregnant. and then the dr will see you once a month if all is going good. then at 8 months it will be every 2 weeks then at nine months it will be weekly.as long as you have anormal pregnancy throughout. good luck and congrats|`|XwjL8PZCaa	Most dr's won't even want to see you till your about 10 weeks I just got on medicaid too and did not see the dr till I was 14 weeks it is my 2nd pregnancy though so I was not worried about it.  But you probably can't make an appointment till you have your card and have been approved|`|xq7S9H5Raa	It is important to schedule an appointmetn as soon as you found out that you are pregnant.  There is such things as emergency medicaid.  Speak to the medicaid office.  There are many free clinics that will charge you nothing or a very small fee.|`|8c4kRTnPaa	I called my midwife when I found out at 5 weeks, she wouldn't see me until I was 8-10 weeks because they can only really do a blood test to confirm. At 10 weeks they may be able to hear the heartbeat. So I would schedule your appointment at about 10 weeks and hopefully your insurance goes through!
10r8cXezaa	Stay relaxed. Stress can make you have a miscarriage. Be healthy. Make sure that the baby is getting all of the nutrients he/she needs. Take prenatal vitamins and, of course, drink lots of water. Also, make sure you take Folic Acid. It helps with the growth of the babies spine.     Hope this helps!|`|AA10315542	Truthfully, (besides avoiding drugs) there isn't a thing you can do to prevent miscarriage.  I have had 2 myself and am the most careful person who really took care of herself and her baby.  Take your vitamins and eat well to have a healthy baby.|`|nlteggWIaa	alchol tobacco and over doing it , but if a miscarriage is going to happen it will happen no matter what i did everything by the book and i still lost mine at 12 weeks .... and its 16 weeks not 18
hj9C9fN9aa	I didnt find out I was pregnant until i was 5 weeks along and had had alcohol and over the counter meds for cold/headache & Xanax for my anxiety and now im 4 mos along and everything is going great! Your baby is extremely protected at this early on and it is just an embryo not a fetus so it doesnt take in what you might. But stop taking now!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	No you are ok. My friend had a really bad tooth infection and her doctor perscribed her percocet for the pain. Just don't take anymore.|`|i8Ch743Laa	Typically not. I was on 3 mg of xanax a day before I knew I was pregnant,and they don't think there is any issue,I stopped as soon as I knew I was pregnant though.|`|O7nyzkGdaa	I was 13 weeks when i got kidney stones and the hospital doc's as well as a specialist prescribed me percocets. I asked the NP about them at the OB's office and she said they were fine, so i still have some left over and take them if i get a migraine that wont quit with tylenol. Im not proud of it but i did alot worse than percocets before i knew i was pregnant, but i am 39 weeks with a healthy and normal baby girl. Good luck to you!
AfGJkoJPaa	The pregnancy symptoms show up earlier and sometimes with more force in your second pregnancy. Don't stress it.|`|iTEf1dP3aa	Different symptoms doesnt necessarily mean a set of multiples...My two pregnancies were very different, then again my son is two and I'm expecting my daughter in May...other than that...yes it is very normal|`|s40sgQ45aa	Every pregnancy is different.  Don't rely on the first pregnancy as your guide.  Everything you mentioned sounds pretty normal.|`|Ltb8K9YUaa	All of that stuff started at six weeks for me.  I am pregnant with one child.  Symptoms can be different with every pregnancy.  I have also heard that symptoms can be worse with girls.  And this could possibly be a sign of twins.  The only way to really find out is a ultrasound!  Good luck and congrats!|`|AA12218729	I am 2 months also and have the exact same symptoms but I also get terrible aches in my tummy. this is also my second baby and I am told that these symptoms are normal. I think it feels so bad for me bacause I forgot how painful the first few months can be considering my first baby is almost 8 years old! If you are having twins a sonogram will deff confirm it at 8 weeks. If the Dr. won't give you a sonogram because he/she thinks it's too early tell them you are second guessing how far along you think you are and you maybe more pregnant than you thought...A lil secret a nurse once told me and it has worked every time!
0caa6e1fa230ee8e967b66725f6a0dd6aa	i have been craving chinese food lately. also i used to hate subway but now i think it sounds soooo good. popeye's chicken, yummmm.  one bad thing is alot of foods that i loved, i now get grossed out even thinking about eating them.    i've also been eating alot of fruit, especially apples.|`|44OH7Si6aa	I crave cinnamon. I have to have things with cinnamon in them. At first that meant I was doing a lot of sweets that aren't good for me but I now I keep some instant oatmeal on hand and I eat apples sprinkled with splenda and cinnamon|`|SgfBzfIqaa	reeses nd strawberry yogurt =) luv dat sh*t lol!!  xoxox|`|Kg5KX432aa	cheetos and rootbeer. so healthy! lol|`|780ByZVEaa	with my son fried chicken. With this one seriously nothing i am 15 weeks pregnant and still things make me naussiaus|`|tjNJAn75aa	I loved chewing on ice cubes.|`|q7sgWqZ3aa	I've had different cravings through my pregnancy!    My most occurring one is fruits and KFC honey barbeque snackers and mashed potatoes with gravy! YUM!    In the beginning, I couldn't keep anything down other then the KFC snackers and mash potatoes! Then I started craving frito chili cheese chips with Frito's jalapeno cheese dip( I liked this before pregnancy so its not new to me).    Then my craving changed to beef jerky! I liked that before pregnancy so its nothing new. Then out of the blue I started craving root beer!    Now I'm back to my chips and dip, KFC and fruits! I love my fruits. The jerky isn't that bad either :). I crave alot more meat now, I have to have more meat. I love honey barbeque baby back ribs( my all time favorite food before pregnancy). So none of my cravings were odd and new to me, they were all something I had before. And inexpensive...okay maybe the ribs were a bit costly!|`|VFUdAtrHaa	stuffed crust pizza with lots of cheese and sauce yyyyyyuuummmmmmm!!! lol i don't get paid till wed so i can't get it till then... All the bills where due at once... Don't you love it when that happens...|`|jk6ayFUmaa	hmmm i always want noodles. mashed tatoes, mexican!!!! right now a steak and baked potatoe with everything on it!!!!|`|ffAmoqFTaa	Cereal, I could eat captain crunch and fruity pebbles every meal of the day!  I also crave every fruit imaginable and lately chocolate too!|`|VGoCh2C9aa	my first pregnancy was jacket potatoes with cheese. and this pregnancy milkshakes.|`|qYvDpa6daa	i had different cravings with each trimester. although im now almost 41 weeks pregnant the first craving i got has now returned again, im actually really embarrassed to say this, but i crave the dust from the hoover, everytime i see a hoover i just want to turn it on and smell it, i get really excited when i know i have to hoover, its like taking a big fresh air outside on a cold day, its so weird to explain, i also like the smell of freezers :S weird i know. also i can eat bowls and bowls full of coco pops, i love them. also cucumber, i could sit and eat a whole cucumber in less the 5 minutes if i wanted to, id go through them like no body's busisness, i know im really strange craving hoover dust but every time i tell someone about it, they look at me funny and then laugh.....i do find the funny side, but i wish i didnt crave the most bizare things.|`|P37lIBr2aa	i ALWAYS want pizza or ice cream or cake. Because they are oh so healthy! That and cereal.
3WWHWsHOaa	I spent the last 5 hours helping a woman who is regularly beat by her husband. I took her to the ER for stitches, calmed her children, and helped her find a motel for tonight. I took her shopping and bought her clothing and diapers she will need for the next few days. While dealing with her I received 4 phone calls from my oldest daughter whining that she wanted to play on the computer (home sick and 12 yrs old) and her Dad wouldnt allow her because she is grounded. I got home about 25 mins ago to dirty dishes, laundry, and a house that looks like a tornado hit it. So Im relaxing and the kids and husband are cleaning. I didn't make this mess and they need to learn im not here to clean up after laziness.|`|wZAeBisbaa	I am past those days, but I remember them so clearly.  When they are all settled down, take a look good at them and see how wonderful they are, and remember that it's because you willingly and freely go through days like today, as often as you have to, so that they can grow up healthy and loved.  Had you known in advance what kind of a day it would be, you would have done it anyway. That's what parenthood is. You're doing the most important job in the world.|`|NAnRrCcZaa	I hope that things get better for you. I hate to hear that kids are sick...You are having a hard time and I feel your pain my kids are due for health check ups and their peditrican can not get them in until the end of February. That pisses me off!|`|0ixBWT6Xaa	I'm so sorry you're having a horrible day. This happens though, just think how much better tomorrow will be.Insurance companies do suck and as far as Wal-Mart goes, I' switch to a pharmacy that has meds on hand all the time. Wal-Mart should've told your Dr. office they were out of that med or called you to tell you of the delay.Mine does.I hate giving my money to people that don't care about my time. Your husband owes you big time when he gets home.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	wow, kitkat.  that's the kind of day that might feel bad, but you get to the end of it thinking you actually did something truly useful for another person.  i'll take a bad day like that (minus the mess!).    sorry, was just struck by kitkat's answer.  my day was fine but might have been better had i gotten more than four hours of sleep last night and had my 3-year-old not had the biggest meltdown any of my kids have ever had.  which makes me suspect that i probably now have a sick kid, too.
b7LI0jwXaa	Could be a late implantation bleed.  Personally, I didn't get any spotting/bleeding at all.  But I still don't know if I've conceived?  Do you have msn/myspace?

od51qzQtaa	Did you complete the cause of antibiotics, they only work well if the whole cause is taken. The trouble with antibiotics is that they also kill the good bacteria in the vagina which upsets the balance. the best bet for BV is probiotic drinks, yogurt with natural cultures in, like activia.|`|gHR4vlcDaa	it does sound like a yeast infection, but you can also more/differnent discharges during preg.    mom of 2 daughter 25weeks

If you want him/her to be unique, you are going to have to pick some different names, because I know about 10 kids under the age of 5 with each of those tired names.    And I'm not sure I understand the two middle name thing you have going on.    I also hate with a passion the names Landon and Hailey, and the child will too.    You really need to go to the site below.  They tell you why you shouldn't name your children what you have suggested.  Hey, you asked for opinions.|`|CU5fj3Inaa	Your kids are going to want to kill you for giving them THREE different names not including their last name. Just a heads up.|`|98zdMhZ2aa	I actually like a new version of your girl names, Olivia Violet Marie.  Personally, though I like just one middle name.  For boys I like Landon James.  I wouldn't go with Luke Skylar... I like both names but it sounds like Luke Skywalker and he will get made fun of.      My future daughter is going to be Hesper, Jocelyn (Josie for short), or Alyce.  I don't know about middle names.  My future son is going to be named Graham, Ethan, or Seth.  Fun to think of!|`|G3xC859saa	luke jeremiah  and switch around so colton tyler     for girls sadie andne marie|`|lFoHhPXLaa	i think they are really creative, but for two names to add to your middle name list, i like the name cassandra and elaine|`|AbgrE463aa	they are all great names,i'm expecting in the summer,so i'm trying to find names.|`|AA11199106	Clara Madeline and Landon James :)|`|PUn197AAaa	favorite combos for each 1st name. my favorites are on the top and it goes down accordingly    Sadie Violet Lynn  Clara Emma Lynn  Olivia Hallie Pearl  Hayley Sydney Paige    Luke Xavier  Jordan Colby  Tyler Cohen  Landon James|`|HurPmgSaaa	I love:  Hailey Pearl Jolie  Olivia Adelynne Noelle  Sadie Leah Hope  Sadie Madison Brielle  Landon James  Tyler Jacoby  Tyler Colton|`|dMTx6QRaaa	GIRL: Olivia Madie Marie  BOY:Landon James|`|ajDohnPIaa	hmm you should stick with a 2 way name...

I love Sadie and in particular Sadie Violet Lynn.  Sadie is such a cute name and I love floral names and Lynn is my Mum's middle name!!!    For the boy Landon James - it sounds very distinctive and I just love it.  Similar to Brandon in sound, but that names is so common these days.
yhZvInMAaa	Despite your ovulation cycle, only five days have passed since potential conception; this may be too early for a HPT to work. A blood test would be more accurate at this early stage.|`|piPK22hdaa	You might or you might not be pregnant.  But you are definitely driving yourself crazy.  Take a pregnancy test.
ZaadvJAXaa	I worried about the same thing, but your baby is fine.|`|FoY5fgVwaa	No, you won't squish her head.  She is very protected in there and her head isn't actually coming out of you yet!  Her neck will not snap, either.  It may be very uncomfortable for you, but if she was that uncomfortable, you'd be in labor already!! :)  Good luck and I hope she wants to come out soon!|`|3y8YIs3raa	You need to see a doctor if your worried|`|2de422e579b099a457e9236ca0a2b210aa	LOL...she's fine. No woman ever killed her baby in utero by sitting down.|`|19c2a509cc4109ce143343de4c12a5b7aa	Ooh, I remember that sensation.  My daughter came out with a perfectly shaped head so it mustn't have done her any harm.|`|0fe4f3702c5dd1a403524194d3e9fabdaa	No your baby is completely fine & not getting squashed by you at all! Think of your baby as in a big water balloon, But the balloon is extra thick & cushiony. You are going to bounce around & sit down & lay down & your baby is COMPLETELY safe in there. She just floats around in your amniotic fluid.|`|QB0l3FrSaa	no it is not but if your water breaks while sitting down then you are
FQ4nhSiRaa	Throughout my whole labor my contractions felt like menstrual cramps, sounds like contractions to me, but i believe to be in active labor they have to be 5 minutes apart for an hour. I missed all this because I was induced so I didnt really "go into labor". Good luck with your delivery!|`|iMULlxdgaa	Just go to L&D now and see what they say..hey they might even even keep ya and then you can have your baby!|`|MqFeJiukaa	Early labor starts off with menstrual like cramps that come and go.  When I went into labor with my youngest I experienced the same thing but was thinking it was just pre labor.  When I went to stand up my water broke.  All I can really tell you is time them and if they get stronger and closer together call the hospital.  Or of course if your water breaks go head and call then to lol.|`|6lBWoKrgaa	yes i think it is the start of labor, pretty soon you'll see your baby :)|`|cen8SIssaa	that sounds like early labor...usually the contractions dont hurt to bad just  uncomfortable....you should start timing them from the beginning of your first one and then right again the time of the beginning of your second one.    if they are between five and seven minutes apart you should call your doctor and let them know.    Great luck to you~|`|ZCTh21QCaa	If you're only feeling it once an hour it's probably just late pregnancy discomfort. Even early labor which can last for hours, days or weeks starts out with cramping/contractions every 10-30 min. I had pretty steady contractions 4 min apart for 2 months before I had my daughter, but every woman is different. You know your body better than anyone. If you think you might be in labor, call your doctor for his/her advice.|`|xW9Px03Taa	Sounds like you are going into labor. Go to labor and delivery.

So for example, Daniel andres pulgar gallardo    now for specific girls name  Genesis is a girl name they use in Mexico and it's definitely not as common as other spanish names  there are a lot of cute names that start with y's like yadira, yajaira, yesenia, yvette    I suggest a rare name like yajaira since your child is supposed to be unique and irreplaceable :)    Andrea is also very nice  if you want a common name alejandra  But for your baby...since it's half black Bianca|`|jpIhFC87aa	i like isabel too, but how about..hm. isabella, maria, alicia, mariana, marta, carolina, or lilliana, those are all beautiful names and alicia, lilliana, and mariana could be considered american. hope u lyk my answers|`|7piFsbg0aa	Elena is a loveley name!

Ltb8K9YUaa	I have PCOS so my periods were always irregular.  There were many times when I thought I was pregnant even though the test said I was not.  When I actually was pregnant my test was positive.  I think that we can make ourselves mentally pregnant.  If you really think  you are then take a blood test.  There is no way that one will be wrong.  Good luck!|`|XhIYAH6Laa	You are probably pregnant, however the only way of knowing for sure is to take a test.

When you have unprotected intercourse, semen can live in your body for up to 7 days. So let's say you had intercourse tonight and tomorrow night was were fertile day, your chances are still good. Good luck!
Kg5KX432aa	That was my situation exactly (except later on around 37 weeks). The diarrhea wasn't a bug, it was my body preparing for labor and it went on for a week or two. I also got horrible back pain late in pregnancy because my son was facing backwards.|`|KYkoPHpsaa	these sound like it could be signs of preterm labour... or maybe ur baby is just getting bigger and putting stress on ur back. maybe go get checked at the hospital for ur baby not moving as much, but it could be one of those lazy days|`|79iavUwJaa	i had the same thing its not a problem,unless u have a urinary tract infection which i ended up with when i was 36 weeks pregnant and i almost went into premature labor so check it out.
xa41bRrdaa	I'm not sure about for big kids, but I think your best bet would be to try them out until you find the one that best suits your needs at a reasonable cost        good luck!|`|dnEmFs2maa	Brands like Pampers Underjams and Huggies GoodNights are two of the most popular diapers for kids who are potty trained, but still wet the bed.  I think I've even seen on the GoodNights site they have diapers made to look like boxer shorts.  I thought that was really cool!  If this is a chronic issue, and they need diapers all the time, then adult diapers would likely be a better path.  But, I guess that depends on how big these big kids are.  Can they still fit into baby sizes or are they beyond that?

Do you feel any discomfort?   When I was pregnant I also experience this discharge but it had a tiny bit of blood almost very light pink.   I started feeling uncomfortable after a few hours.   Mine started at 12 p.m then I really started feeling the contraccions like around 7 p.m.   Gave birth around    11:49 p.m.  Good luck.
0178f79aa7217e1f78fd2623ae5b7dd3aa	Girl, you aren't even that big. I started out at 117 lbs. when I first got preggers. By the time I gave birth, I weighed 139 lbs. I lost it all and a few extra lbs. by my 6 week check up. I am now 114 lbs. I breastfed and it came off so quick. That is how I got mine off. When you breastfeed, your body snaps back quick! You can feel your uterus shrinking right after you give birth and start breastfeeding. I would get major menstral cramps during and after breastfeeding. Plus, that milk is so good for your baby. It's like liquid Gold to your child. You should consider it. I no longer breastfeed though, but I am still skinnier than ever. She will be 3 months next Monday. Your gonna love being a mommy. Don't worry about getting your weight back. You aren't even gaining that much - like me.|`|5750c8ed6e36c08baa63c0651369908eaa	I lost 10 pounds the first week after I came home from the hospital, and I owe it all to breastfeeding.  I weigh less now than I did before I got pregnant, and I haven't lifted a finger to work out or even walk!  I eat big meals, and it all goes right to the milk...my baby is extremely healthy, tall for her age, and she is ten months old now and still nursing because I feel like it is good for both of us.  Don't worry about your body right now--your  baby is more important, and if you want my honest opinion, you should probably put on a little more weight just so your baby will be healthy.  But I guess you do have those last two months to go...so you're doing fine.  Just don't worry, as long as you're planning on breastfeeding.  If you don't, you may have to work out and try to get your abdomen back.  Mine has a little loose skin roll on it that I'd like to get rid of.  It was my first baby, and I was scared like you, but after having her, the pounds just melted off!  It's really nice...but they say it isn't that easy with the second child....so we'll see hopefully.  Good luck and enjoy every minute!|`|475361d3b626b195d978150c58c710d5aa	i was 120 lbs when i got prego and im 37 weeks and now i weigh about 175 it ALL came in the last trimester it deffinally sucks but i know its all for my baby|`|657d94581f0e3129298f0e93b85dd7b9aa	I have three kids and the last one I had 2 weeks ago.<br>  Don't get stressed out. How fast  you can lose weight depends on your body. You shouldn't excersize until 5-6 weeks after delivery, but you can and should go for walks with the stroller the sooner the better; it'll help your uterus contract faster and you'll feel better in general.<br>  Don't eat junk but don't starve yourself either. There is no reason not to get back to your weight in about 5-6 months after delivery.<br>  While you're nursing you may still have extra 2-3 pounds because of milk but I don't think your husband will mind THAT (-:|`|9d105810454e7efc3b50dfeaee12e780aa	Piece of cake for you....I was 107 and when I had my son two months ago I was 168..YIKES I know.....I am 30 years old and my metabolism is alot slower than yours...I have not worked out yet but I have already lost 25 lbs.  You should lose almost all of it by the time you leave the hospital....I was in the hospital for 3 days and dropped 15 lbs by the time I left...<br>  <br>  You will be fine and back to normal...If you have a C-section that is a different story as far as the tummy being flat again...Also DO NOT WORK OUT at 3 weeks....My Dr. said at leave wait 5-6 weeks......Please listen to that or your Dr for health reasons...<br>  <br>  Good Luck and God Bless....

AA12106298	The first time my son got sick he was miserable, and so was I. It's really hard to see your child sick. If you are concerned take her to the doctor right now and see what you can do for your baby. There is very little that a mother can do when the baby is so little but you can provide some comfort for your child. My doctor told me that it is good for a child to get sick, because this is what helps to build the immune system. Don't worry. It will all be over soon and then it will come again. The average child gets sick up to about 8 times a year! It will eventually be ok, and you will not be so worried the next time she gets sick.|`|17cd02c243ad95cd0a7ac5eee0305905aa	Its not harmful, its better their submitted to these things early.|`|2d360b1e2f77bde839da4502752fe1b3aa	If you are nursing, she won't get it.

It's possible for a baby to get RSV. Which the way the doctor explained it to me when my daughter had it is basically the common cold for adults but since babies can't blow there noses it gets in there lungs and can make them very sick. I don't want to worry  you but I don't think enough doctor's tell parent's about RSV. Just watch her close and if she starts getting sick suction her nose and take her to the doctor so that he can check her out. Hopefully if she does get sick she'll get over it quickly.|`|AA10232161	Your infant, for the first year, has your immune system. If she gets the cold...well...a couple of cranky days...but it's actually good for her.<br>  Try not to keep her isolated from you because she needs to build her own immune system. Your's is just a based immunity...but she needs to add to it.<br>  I know it's not pleasant to have your kids sick...but it's necessary.|`|d2583e95d4d4519b876d402f5e6dc9b6aa	i would keep rverything clean use your bacterial spray and wash everything and just dont get in face and all if he gets it im sure at 2 months it is okay if it waas ealier i would be worried but if he does at this age  i would get an antibiotic just in case considering his immune system is still low and all.|`|dcedc77f21a739cd68fcdf36aa658e6caa	They must not be because I just took my 3 month old to the dr. today because she is congested with green discharge and she sounds like a pug puppy when she sleeps.

euSgoMy8aa	A good way to have a private adoption is to open your mouth and talk to family.  They usually know someone with an unwanted pregnancy.  My birth mom is my cousin really.  My parents couldn't get pregnant and when my birth mom was in the hospital with me the day I was born, her mom, my grandma and aunt, mentioned my parents and they went from there.  It took two years for the finalization, but it was worth the wait my mom says. Everything was personal, and she's always been in my life, even though I didn't now she was more than just one of my hundred of cousins.  I met her this summer and our relationship is great, I'm so much like her it's scary.  So just talk to people you know and through the grapevine you'll find that one lost expecting mom and you'll save eachother.  Good Luck and God Bless!!! ;)|`|1174cc95a13ab7ebb319456f0cd66959aa	Check out this website.  Good Luck!|`|9f38db29a31bdd91f3bba66fada40705aa	google search for a website that reunites people.

It is a very helpful and free website.<br>  <br>  Not all people have a 28 day cycle therefore not all ovulate on the 14th day like i know alot of people are going to tell you on here.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|948ef77f3c7678cb302784b746c11e1daa	You can try charting your temp - ovulation is said to be happening when you basic body temp goes up a degree - but is difficult to pinpoint and most likely you'll end up not really noticing a difference because body temp. fluctuates at least a degree throughout the month because of a variety of stimuli.  Best bet is to chart your period and if you're lucky enough to be fairly regular, then your ovulation period will generally be 14 days prior the start of your next period - this is not guaranteed but it's a good start.|`|325eabf82573094f078147ac12e521afaa	You can know when you are ovulating when you body temperature changes. more or likely  you will feel warmer than usual. You will also pass, or should I say you will have some kind discharge from your genital area( Vag). This discharge is suppose t be or should be white to clear, I don't think it should have any smell at all. You  ovulate five days before your period and five days after.Still I could be wrong because every woman is different, but if you want to be sure you should ask your Gynecologist.|`|426b2ebde46450837484fb98a2515f7daa	chart ur body temp and chck ur cervical mucus. google the question and it will tell u how|`|DD2mofB7aa	You will need to chart your temperature.  When it goes up and there is also a change in your vaginal fluids, they become more glue like (if you have some between two fingers and you move your fingers apart the fluids don't break straight away, they cling to both fingers).  You need to take your temperature at the same time each day preferably, as soon as you wake in the morning.  If you sleep longer or less this can interfere with your reading.  And make sure you use the same method of taking your temperature.  If you put the thermometer under your tongue, than always do it that way.  If you put it under your arm, than make sure you continue to do so.|`|b744334bc9e2af3b96db155af171cfd1aa	Taking your temp is a great start. There is a web site that has software that will help you chart you cycles. This will also help you to be more aware of what is going on in your body at that time. I have a pinching feeling in my ovaries when I ovulate. Like a cramp but in a small area and not as strong as menstrual cramps.|`|qfYCU033aa	You know when you are ovulating when your stomach hurts and also your back starts to ache.  Also things angure you easily and you mood changes quick

The repetition of the 'e' sound is too much.|`|MtoIxY6Qaa	no one will be able to pronounce them!!!!! they are so weird. cant you name your kid something normal?|`|NgmuqcpXaa	Scarleet Dannon sounds pretty|`|9nJwsSvPaa	OMG heck no!!!!!!1|`|CdGOuEmpaa	Just use ally. just think how many times this kid is going to write her name in school, and just adding those extra letters, besides being hard to figure out how to pronounce, is just tough.     hope i helped!    will you vote on my names now? thnx  http://www.babynames.com/namelist/968217...|`|YLpzo5G6aa	The second name has a very pronounced "e" sound throughout and typically you don't want to use the same strong vowel sound in both the first and middle name.     How about...    Scarlett Eden  Alleigh Grace|`|GoluIRIAaa	Scarlett Dannon I'm not sure how you pronounce the secound set.|`|3AlFMrA5aa	Alleigh is REALLY CUTE/ 2 me|`|8u5DUE5Iaa	What about Allie Danielle?|`|FLOjzbKEaa	I really like Scarlett Dannon.|`|BOJEbnCtaa	I love the name Alleigh but would perfer Danielle is easier to pronounce.|`|GEyJMsaKaa	Scarlett Rose would sound beautiful.
26e007e4ed7e7d42044814b364794a0eaa	C's are never acceptable in my house.  If they get a C on progress report or report card, they will be grounded until the next card comes home.  I have never had to do this but I will 100% stick to my guns if they ever bring home a C and they know this.  My kids are very active in sports and dance and have everything a child could want.  I would go as far as to say they are spoiled.  But they know if they bring home a C, it gone for a while.|`|Qz3sii2caa	Sounds like she's bored and needs a challenge. Would you consider sending your child to a private school? The standards and curriculum is usually harder. It sounds like she wants to do well, but is distracted by all the social activity. She WILL NOT be allowed to run her mouth at a private school; when you're in a classroom you pay attention or you're out. Besides, most private school kids hold a higher bar for themselves so they're not really the type to treat class time as social hour it could be good for her.|`|AA10943329	so you are basically paying her to do well. What ever happened to a hug and a "I am proud of you , well done"? She is 9. Give the kid a break. At that age friends are more important than school to them. Continue to encourage her to spend a bit more time making her work neater. Also talk to the teacher about it and asking her to work more on her penmanship. Such as making her redo it if messy.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Yeah. You seem to be putting too much pressure on a 9 year old,and that will only aggravate her and make her not want to try even more.  A's and B's are good. You should not expect her to act like an adult at 9 years of age.    You should try a different approach. Giving rewards for taking extra time on homework and so forth.|`|AA11946005	Getting upset with her won't solve much, except to make her uptight.  Chatty, social people are often very creative so perhaps you can channel her social energy into ways she can improve.  Sloppy writing?  Maybe one of the rewards you get her can be a journal= stores like Target have pretty ones, even leather for 8 or 9 dollars.  If she has a nice journal have her write stories or poems, and she might be motivated to write more neatly in such a nice book.  Nagging doesn't accomplish much but encouragement means soooo soooo much.|`|70c1c2e410f2cdd8e3cd8235784e9689aa	Sounds like ADD to me.  Especially with the penmenship.  that being said, she sounds a lot like a normal child.  Maybe school just isn't her thing.  She needs to learn to work hard and get smart, but she is just a little kid so jsut keep encouraging her.  I have tried natural consequences with my 8 year old who sometimes acts this way.  This has worked, sometimes.|`|0SeDvhJ9aa	If she's misbehaving in school then you should give her a spanking, but if she really is trying her best then you should think of some way to reward her for her effort.|`|vDjy1eKDaa	Yes school is important and comes first ALWAYS, but shes only 9..dont give her hell over it. Talk to her nicely and help her out. Plus a C is average, but not good enough..its better than a D and an F..for a 9 year old, u should be happy for atleast a C.|`|F3dWvVy5aa	I still tell people how my dad got upset because he would say "why did you get a b on this?" I'm 39 now, so it never really leaves you. if she is goofing off that is one thing. If she really is trying but no matter what she does isn't good enough, maybe you should relax a little. what my mom did was treat me to a great treat if I got all a's. Maybe you could do that. Mine took me shopping and out to lunch. That made me want the goods!|`|CsefdZ0Gaa	Depends on if you think she is trying her hardest.    If you think she's not applying herself.. than yeah... get on her about it|`|bb129c0f6e872ef16842c74d773d2725aa	It's not about grades it's about doing your best job.  That is how we approach it.  If you know she is not doing her best job then talk to her about that, not about the actual letter grade.  For my nine year old (who tends to rush also) I look over her homework and if it is apparent that she did not do her best, then I make her do it over.|`|wv12MI3uaa	Yeah I do think so. She's just 9 right now you can't expect her to be the best and always get A's and B's and nothing else but that. As long as she's trying her best you should be happy. If you want her to get better grade just help her study a little bit. Don't stress it to her so much she'll just get annoyed and feel like that she's not good enough. That's how i sometimes feel when my parents say you HAVE to get better or your not working hard enough or stuff like that. Just relax a little and help her out. And tell her that rushing through her school work will not help her. Hope i helped out a little.|`|jvW3a5GYaa	I got A's B's and C's all through school - in college I got straight A's and graduated with Honor's - she's only 9 and there's nothing wrong with a C. Encourage her to do her best but really a C isn't that big of a deal for a 9 year old.
0RFUKkBLaa	The best way to put it is that the amniotic fluid that the baby is in for the 9 months of pregnancy is in a sac and this then bursts around the time when a women is about to go into labor|`|15UZwW2laa	The the amniotic sac around the baby just broke and that the baby is coming!|`|BfiRm5cbaa	That means that there baby is comin and u need 2 take her to the hospital so she can have her baby|`|Y0mRcFqZaa	WHAT IT SOUND LIKE.|`|5H5iQfW4aa	yes that is what it means if they say MY WATER BROKE then yes they are pregnant and they need to go to the HOSPITAL ASAP
AA11490385	I have seen therapists on and off for going on 13 years now, starting when I was a teen.  I  have had both male and female.  Honestly, it never mattered to me which gender they were.  What is most important is that it is somebody who will listen, offer good suggestions, and after your session you come away feeling like you have spent your time and money well and accomplished something.  Hope that helps.|`|iFXe1Obvaa	I personally like talking to men better, so I have a male therapist. It has nothing to do with sex, or anything like that.|`|X8riDZBqaa	I think it just matters who you click with. I've had a male psych for 11 years now. Not a moment's worth of discomfort or awkwardness.|`|l9a8sFT7aa	Does your daughter relate better to males or females? You may need to talk to her and find out what does she prefer. Good luck.|`|ozATw7s0aa	Female, she would be able to connect with you better.    Good luck!|`|E6T9DPT9aa	I would say female. As she would have grown up, knowing girls' minds inside and out, and she knows girly stuff with the experience.    You may find it a bit embarrassing with a male. Especially if you develop a crush on him!     All my best (:  E-mail me if you want to know anything else (:|`|6ucVuo10aa	a female.....maybe because i think a female one would probably be able to relate to her easier u kno.....seeing as she is a woman|`|y7Mwptsraa	Don't rely only on the male/female thing. You should find a therapist that you are comfortable with. Don't be afraid to interview the therapist. They'll be doing that to you in the first meeting.|`|6gthdHpnaa	Probably a female, she'll be easier to talk to.|`|8ff3196b10cd4c3afc116407535b3666aa	It depends who you would feel most comfortable with. Some girls wouldn't be comfortable talking about girl things with a man, some wouldn't feel comfortable discussing things with a woman. It's all about your comfort level.|`|MyfHYAloaa	id be more comfertable with a female|`|dIdpr45taa	Doesn't matter. They're trained the same way and are all professionals.|`|oYmZUO8Caa	You would probably be able to relate better to a female.
0ixBWT6Xaa	I was one the pill for 7 years went off, one month later i was pregnant. Went on the pill for another 6 years off the pill for one month, guess what preggers again so yes you could get pregnant after being off one month. Oh yeah the Dr. told me I probably wouldn't get pregnant if I went off for one month.Dumb Doctor!|`|B1JFBV3jaa	First of all, a period is not plural.  You only have one period.  It just comes back every month.    The pullout method is ineffective.  I would recommend taking another test a couple days after your missed period.  You will not always get the same symptoms for every pregnancy.  You can't really compare the two.  It may be nothing at all.  When you stress about pregnancy, you can cause yourself to experience phantom symptoms that makes you think that you are pregnant but in reality, it's just stress.
kWvtUrwkaa	I think Sophia Jeanne sounds better and "sophie" could be a little nickname...but Sophia sounds like it will grow up nicely with your little girl!! :) congrats!|`|8u5DUE5Iaa	What about Sophia Jeanne?|`|BOJEbnCtaa	Sophie Jeanne is cool|`|XzV4bUeFaa	Sophie Jeanne is beautiful.  I also would like Madison Jean, or Emma Jean.  (If you should go with Payton--pls. spell like this)|`|yNxYYHszaa	I like Sophie Jeanne. It sounds fine like Madison Jeanne, *Paytyn Jeanne, Paige Jeanne, and Emma Jeanne. *= Spell Paytyn like Peyton so it's easier to spell and tell what it is.|`|UzkHnXzVaa	I think Sophia Jeanne flows a bit more nicely together. That's wonderful that you want to honor your grandmother. :)    Madison or Emma would sound nice with Jeanne as well. Paytyn I don't think would sound good, and although I'm not fond of the name, I would choose a different spelling. Paige doesn't go well with Jeanne either.|`|7e9f66e8183a6115754d5680f9ad5f36aa	I really like Sophie Jeanne!    I'd STRONGLY discourage the funky spelling PAYTYN.  My mother chose a different spelling for me and I hated all the teasing in school.  Teachers didn't know how to pronounce it, always misspelled it and even now when I send emails to colleagues .. even though I sign my name as it's legally spelled, they still insist on changing it.    Honestly, parents just don't think about what a child goes through on a daily basis when something that should be simple is made difficult.|`|0eb9b9f3c0fc0a49aef7113d7c23113faa	it is a beautiful name  sophie jeanne it has a nice ring to it and flows really well|`|WNPgD4QRaa	HOW ABOUT SOPHIE MARIE JEANNE|`|NgmuqcpXaa	i like Paytyn Jeanne because its so original|`|536af1d5775b5f4d1ee77ec280e3bcd1aa	I love that name actually, I don't know ANY Sophies so it won't be very common.

a11810dedcef49b4ee5c4f8c624bb39eaa	I have been in that situation and I totally understand how u feel. Im now 28.4 weeks pregnant. The only advice i can offer u is to stay focused and do all the right things (vits, no smoking etc). I got by knowing that it is actually very very difficult to miscarry based on your actions alone. It is usually someting wrong with the fetus and, honey, there ain't nothing u can do about that!! Also, 90% of women who have had 1 miscarriage go on to have perfectly healthy babies. Stress makes our already tender and soft abdomen muscles tense, causing pain and discomfort. I KNOW its hard, but u really need to find a way of letting nature run its course, and just relax. What will be will be but Im sure u will be fine this time. Keep positive and try not to stress too much. i don't know if u have had kids b4, but be aware that in early pregnancy u will get the odd cramp and niggly pain, usually round ligament pain, so try not to stress too much at every pain. U know the signs of a miscarriage, so unless u exhibit those, stay calm. Good luck to u|`|LBcRolYiaa	Just relax and don't worry so much!! If you've made it to the 5 week mark, chances are very good things will go fine.  Just think happy thoughts, enjoy life and start looking for things to do to keep your mind in a happy place.  I wish you the best!!!|`|BKLLLZyraa	Relax and enjoy your new pregnancy.  I was in the same position last year I miscarried in May 06 and then found out in July I was pregnant again, i am now 36 weeks pregnant and all is well.  My advice would be to relax and don't worry, cause the worrying does not help.  take care and i hope all goes well.  Angela x|`|q7dBTu6yaa	Live every day as it comes.

I was 19 years old.  I first told my boyfriend that i was pregnant, my reaction was that i was SHOCKED. I cried of course, and i didn't know what to do. Many things ran through my mind such as, am i going to keep it, or abortion? My heart couldn't do the abortion part, so i knew my only choice was to keep it. I'm so thankful that I decided to keep it. I am now 19 weeks pregnant. My family was disappointed in me, but what happend happend, and now it's time to be excited about it.|`|Lr3lZ4draa	i was on birth control so i had no idea, then i started puking alot, and even though i was on birth control i thought i might be and so did my boyfriend, so i took a test and it was positive, so i called my boyfriend and told him to come over and showed him the test. i was 17 at the time i told my boyfriend first, then my two best friends    i was terrified because i was 17 (almost 18 but still), but it ended up being  the best thing thats ever happened to me.  and i have a month old little boy|`|AA10015577	I was about 3 weeks late for a period and finally prepared myself to take a test, took it and got an early b-day present and a late one for my hubby.

I was devastated at first but learned to love the idea and became as prepared as possible.  Now he is almost 4 and we are expecting number 2!|`|uMyHeT6Faa	I'm currently four months pregnant (13 weeks, 6 days) with a baby girl. I'm 15 and my baby's due august 1st, i won't be 16 until august 25th. When I found out I was with my friend Chrissy at school, in the bathroom... what a way to find out, huh? All I did was stare into space throughout my classes and when I got home I hinted around for a few days about being pregnant. When I finally told my mom she didn't believe me, after hours of convincing her she didn't talk to me, she cried and then she finally said my dad was going to kill me. I convinced her to tell him for me since my dad can be a complete *** about things and he laughed and didn't believe her. When she finally told him she was being serious he didn't speak but finally told me he wouldn't mind being a grandpa as long as the daddy was with me... unfortunantly he left me. I guess he was okay with it because his mom got pregnant with his brother at 16.     I'm happy that I'm going to be a mom, I'm scared, nervous and excited, but it definantly wasn't planned either. I guess I thought it'd never happen to me but it did. I never once thought about aborting my baby and I'm glad I didn't because I believe everything happens for a reason, you know?|`|RCRTyVKKaa	I was late and told my B/F i was late took a test and it came back positive. I was 15. I told y partner first then his mum, then the rest of our family and friends. I was shocked i was 15 but i chose to take responsibility for my actions.    I now have an 18 m/o little boy. And wouldn't change him for the world. I'm almost 18.
R71NpXKKaa	I know this doesn't answer your question, but I want to share my story in case you decide to keep your mirena, or if other readers are considering it.    I got a Mirena IUC in December 2006, shortly after I had my son.  I bled for three months straight, then got irregular light periods.      In May, 2008 I had just finished my period, or so I thought, when a few days later I started bleeding heavily, the heaviest I've ever bled in my life.  I called my doctor and she said that it sounds like the IUC was out of place and to get a pregnancy test, because it was possible I could have gotten pregnant after the IUC slipped.    I went out and bought the test, took it home and took it immediately.  The test turned positive right away.  I ended up going to the hospital later that evening, because the blood was scaring me and knowing that I was pregnant was freaking me out.    I got to the hospital and the first thing they checked was the placement of the IUC.  Go figure, it was in the correct position.  An ultrasound confirmed my pregnancy, I was about 5 weeks along.  The ultrasound also revealed that the pregnancy was in my fallopian tube, it was an ectopic pregnancy.  As the doctor told me all of this, she pointed out that IUDs and IUCs don't prevent pregnancy per say, they just prevent it from implanting in the uterus.    So that's my story...I wish the best of luck to you!
6MKAU8hBaa	she probably is. thats stupid of her to be so wreckless though. just look up a nearby abortion clinic in your area|`|kdPXhPijaa	Yes, she could be pregnant.  But NO, abortion is not the only answer!!!|`|QQJvWrUkaa	Please DO NOT get an abortion

However, it's normal to suddenly have a growth spurt with your breasts overnight/once the baby is born. Lack of growth doesn't mean you will have a miscarriage.|`|O2ZZpBZzaa	Who knows, the pregnant body is a mystery to us all! If you aren't bleeding or cramping I would say it's highly unlikely.     Have you been losing weight because of nausea?  This could be why.
r52rfBkeaa	Yes, teething can cause what looks like diarrhea.  When babies are teething they're producing more saliva.  Some of it comes out of their mouths as drool, the rest gets swallowed and comes out the other end.  My son is actually going through this at the moment.  Usually his poop is pretty solid and since his incisors are coming through, it's a little more soft.  Have no fear - this too shall pass!|`|wTT8XpKpaa	Yes, teething can cause diarrhea, it will burn your babys bottom very quickly so make sure you change her nappy as soon as she does it!|`|Po2UqfvWaa	it did for all my children. just give clear liquids free of sugar and keep away from dairy if possible. i know your baby needs milk, just don't give so much/cut down for a few days and see if that helps|`|wzjL2itMaa	Yes teething can cause it|`|FZpbfGJNaa	no|`|w4XbSuB5aa	Maybe she's just sick, cuz when i'm real sick i poop yellow dooky lol.|`|6HadL8rHaa	ask yourself the question again....does growing teeth cause watery poo. hmmmmmmmm  they seem so connected|`|maJpBDuvaa	"Some doctors say that the excess saliva from teething may lead to a mild case of loose stools. At this age, however, changes in a child's diet due to the introduction of solid foods may also be the culprit. Always consult your pediatrician if the diarrhea is green, blood-tinged, or lasts longer than two days."|`|D3Fyxj0raa	teething causes diarrehea|`|c4e0f4398cbb2577d252628c76d0781baa	Yes it does.  Babies sometimes get diarrhea when teething b/c they swallow excess saliva.  For your confirmation you can google symptoms of teething and on almost every site it mentions that.  Good luck!|`|92421c37292ceb680aeb803ab5eaea57aa	I'm pretty sure it does, I think my little brother had diarrhea during that period..
EYmgAUgaaa	I'm a physician and have studied pediatric fever.  I can't believe how many misconceptions of fever there are, even from just the responses posted.      I make no recommendations to the original poster (I prefer not to be held liable if something goes wrong).  However, these are the FACTS of fever.    1) Fever of up to 106 does not damage the brain.  A human body has a max set point that it will allow fever to go.  The only way for fever to rise above 106 is usually exogenous sources (locked in a car on a hot day).    2) There is no need to treat a fever and drug the baby.  The body induces fever to help fight infection.  Keep bringing the body temperature down with tyl/motrin, and it inhibits the body's natural system at fighting off infection.  The ONLY reason to treat fever is if the child is uncomfortable.    3) Treating fever does NOT prevent febrile seizures.  If your child is going to have a febrile seizure, he or she will.    4) Dunking a baby in cold water is a bad idea (would you like to be dunked in cold water against your will?)    5) Bundling the baby does NOT make the fever rise (If you bundle hot coffee...does it get hotter?).  It might make the child feel uncomfortable though.    Hmm...a couple of thumbs down for my post.  Maybe people just don't believe me.  That's ok.  Parents coming in for "fever" with a healthy baby is about the easiest way to make a buck.  No tests needed.  I can see and discharge within 5 minutes.|`|D3Fyxj0raa	when he gets a fever give him the motrin but u take off all his clothes just leave him in his diaper|`|Lr3lZ4draa	a fever that high isn't safe, even for an adult. i would take him back to the ER|`|aGOBuJtKaa	I would take him back to the ER. But if that isn't possible, try giving him a cool bath, and let him drink cool liquids.|`|lEjYhwxkaa	I would take him to the pediatrician and get him checked out, that is a high fever, poor baby. Best of luck.|`|t0MiDBMEaa	You should be piggy backing the motrin and tylenol.  Give the recommended dose for motrin then 2 hours later give the correct dose of tylenol and do this until fever breaks.  Colds ar taking longer than usual to get over now and I don't know why. I hope your little one gets better soon.  But, if you are uncomfortable with that high of a fever than by all means take your baby to the emergency.|`|eya1WDS4aa	Well first if it gets above a 102 you need to take him into the er. And you can alternate motrin and tylenol. Do motrin and then when his fever starts going back up (4 hours from when you gave him the motrin)  give him tylenol. It is safe.      Donk a donk--- are you insane! how could they have let you work in a hospital. At 108 an full grown adult can die!!! 106 is WAY TO HIGH for a baby. if it gets above 102 for children under one you are supposed to take them in!  that hopsital you learned that from should really be shut down.|`|mPyN2XX3aa	You can also piggy back the motrin/ibuprofen with tylenol.  So 4 hours into the ibuprofen, give him tylenol.  Then when he is due for the next dose of ibuprofen in another 4 hours (8 hours total)  wait 3 hours for tylenol again (6 hours total between dosages).      IMO it seems pretty high to be teething.|`|MxSY6R3Waa	children will run high fevers and technically its not detrimental untill it hits 106...go ahead and give him a 1/2 dose of fever reducer and bath his head w/a cool cloth....a luke warm bath would help 2.....Good luck     I'll be praying for him. and for you, trust me you are alot worse off than he is right now.|`|sNqi1fLPaa	My son had a temp of 104 before. Its very scary. But i never took him to the emergency room. I heard that if the temp reaches 106 it can cause seazures. Just keep drugging him to keep the temp down. I put my son in cool baths and he actually seems ok in it after a while. When he got out I would wrap him in a cool wet towel with a wet cold washcloth on his head. He was so out of it he didnt even care. But it does help to bring the temp dwon. I put the AC on and had the fan blowing on him. Just do whatever to keep him cool. If that temp last for mor than 3 days, i would be concerened. Dont forget to keep him really hydrated and pedialyte is great for keeping them hydrated. Good luck mama.|`|LDYAGJCxaa	You could try "piggybacking" ibuprofen and tylenol.  This is something my doctor always had me do with my babies when their fevers were high and it works very well.      Give a dose of ibuprofen, 3 hours later give a dose of tylenol, 3 hours later a dose of ibuprofen, and so on.  It really keeps the fever down.  Call the Dr's or speak with a nurse to make sure it's ok, but in my experience, it's worked well.    If that doens't bring his fever down significantly, he needs to be seen again.  And if it's not gone by Monday, then I would take him back in.  Because he's been on antibiotics for a week, I'm concerned that he's not getting better.  (Unless it's viral, then antibiotics won't do anything for the cold).     Good luck and I hope the little guy feels better!  :)|`|FCUBIn3Maa	Take him to the hospital A.S.A.P|`|EAFtAO57aa	You can do combo of Tylenol and Motrin.  First give Motrin.  When you are at the tail end of the time for Motrin give Tylenol.  Dont make the mistake of bundling up the baby.  If you put too many blankets or clothing it will make the fever rise also.  You can also try soaking a wash cloth in ice water and fold it and place it on the baby's forehead.  Also wipe the baby's soles with the ice water washcloth.  Make sure he is drinking a good deal of fluid.
Vw7Ji0zUaa	The mature thing to do is ask him yourself i know it's nerve wrecking but you should still ask him...go up to him and say so the other day in service i saw you looking/staring at me am i mistaken? and just go on from there or you could get to know him better and eventually ask or he'll tell you                                                 OR  the imature route you could ask one of his friends that your close to if he like yous or get one your friend to do it jokingly ask him and see what he says.|`|BYTPpcNZaa	why don't you just ask him if he likes you that way when he gives you an answer you'll know straight away instead of asking on yahoo ask and just getting opinions from people and still not knowing if he actually likes you or not|`|dIdpr45taa	Honestly you should tell him you like him, but if you're too shy to do that then give him hints. Like tell him that you need his advice on a 'guy' that you like but don't let him know that it's him just yet..unless you really want to. I told the guy that I like that I like him and I feel great.
tcU1Xnftaa	I work in a pharmacy and pharmacists never recommend a pregnant woman take any pills, even OTC without asking your doctor first. Believe me, they won't let you suffer. You'll probably get a spinal when the time is right.
hGY08GjRaa	I would suggest you get the proper anti-d. Talk to your doctor. I'm sure they can help you and tell you what to do. Tell them in no uncertain terms that you don't want to risk another miscarriage, so what is the best course of action to  make sure if this baby is Rh+ that your body will not "attack" it.    If i would take a guess, I would guess that your miscarriages could definitely have been a result of your body "attacking" a rh+ baby.      I'm sure the doctors can help you.

F3dWvVy5aa	yeah I think its baby also, I felt a scraping fluttering feeling. After awhile when it gets bigger you will know for sure its the  baby.congrats!!|`|QSodlfMraa	yeah the pinching is the baby! that what i feel!    good luck.|`|vZwJyqc6aa	Sounds like you are feeling the baby. That's what it feels like to me is fluttering. It's an odd feeling. Not like anything else. To me it feels nothing like gas or anything like that.|`|Sj32KRFaaa	I would say that is the BABY!  I felt a pinching/fluttering feeling just like you are describing.  It feels like the little one is pinching you!  It will change over time, but that is what my first experience with the baby moving felt like!|`|NMzlbWt8aa	Mine feel like butterfly wings.  You should be feeling the baby move.  if not dont worry, not all women feel it at the same time.|`|AA10015577	It could be your uterus stretching, but is probably baby movements.  I didn't realize any baby movements until I was 19 weeks and got the first full out kick.  I would say it is the baby moving and feelings from your growing uterus, it's an amazing feeling.  When I explain the movements it's like gassy flutters, when the baby kicks it's like a quick jab from the inside.|`|ebM6CxRQaa	Thats where and how my son felt the first time I felt him! You could be feeling your baby from 16-22 weeks. It will become more frequent and harder over the weeks! GL and congrats!|`|9b633eae216aabb3c79632f53549b57aaa	its most likely little cramps from your uterus stretching|`|fxfMFT6Yaa	yes it is ur baby moving about i started to feel my son moving about at 16 weeks its like butterflys hehe.    dnt worry about a thing hope you have a wounderful pregnancy    god bless
IVSqQQzlaa	I don't really like Ellabelle.  Bella is beautiful though.|`|xglOR1bXaa	Ella Belle...like that    not combined.    i went to school w a girl her name was Belle Dove.    different...lol    i love Belle Rose|`|ej51eWO7aa	i like the names ella & belle separate. what if the middle name is belle, but you call her belle. so the new name is Ella Belle.|`|1ezYfkX7aa	I think Bella is a cute name, but Ellabelle sounds like a toungue twister...i dont like it together...although i do think Ella is beautiful as well =)|`|GkOd1hknaa	oddly i do like it. it has a different sound to it|`|34VXCyvVaa	Annabelle  Christabelle  Maribelle  Rosabelle  Sarabelle  Arabella  Hannabelle|`|f2siAy0raa	i love it! it is the perfect name|`|zXCFGPhOaa	Eh...it sounds like a fairy and it sound too...over the top.Why not just Elle, Belle, Isabelle, Annabelle, or Arabel(la)?|`|vOnzG05Qaa	Belle is a pretty name. But Ellabelle, no. Way to much of a mouthful.|`|tSJFfk8Aaa	Ellebelle is really good. People can still pronounce it but it's not too common.|`|YPRfwMLWaa	I wouldnt go with Ellabelle, it sounds really strange and people will think it is a joke. You could try Annabelle, or Isabelle, not Ellabelle .|`|N5EhfDX2aa	Sorry I dont like Ellabelle; its just too much 'elle'! Good try though. Amabelle is okay. These are 'belle's    Arabelle  Christobelle, Christabel (or similar)  Bonnibelle (gorgeous!)   Jennabel (Cute)  Jezabel, Jesabel (or similar)  Rosabelle (LOVE IT!)     My favourites are Bonnibelle, Bonnibel and Rosabelle, =]     Good luck =]|`|uCdpqmSqaa	Ellabelle is nice.

You and baby will both be fine. They're just vitamins.|`|KQX2BA5Gaa	Dont worry. Nothing will happen if it is one or two times.

If it's a girl I have no clue O_O
kpnSKV6Eaa	well you did lose... fair and square as you put it... grown ups buy there own food, have jobs, pay bills, they dont rely on there mom to come over and clean the house and stock the fridge|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	Why diddent you cook yourself OR ask your pals if you could sleep over and have dinner with them. You have school for breakfast and lunch|`|mxXwQRfxaa	Wow, must be nice to have someone cook for you. My wife won't even cook for me lol.  Count your blessings that you have a mother who loves you and is willing to prepare your meals.  Lots of people don't have that.|`|K5AeQuSNaa	Yup.  You lost fair and square.|`|5D0KuT74aa	you lost  you said she would'nt do anything for you  cooking is something|`|xOr67VDiaa	you'll understand when the time is right. It's all apart of making sure your child knows what respect is for the ones that matter the most. she knew you would end up asking, so its not that fair, cos she didnt really give you a real chance, you should tell her if we are going to do this then we have to do it right, tell her to give you a weekly wages and see if you can handle it on your own.. but dear its your mum she just wants you to learn whats most valuable in life, and nothing is more valuable then a loving honest parent.|`|JK2RvliYaa	You should have kept your mouth shut & gone to the food bank or salvation army.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Welcome to the real world, kid.  Where you provide for yourself, get in the food, make it yourself,|`|ypJt6poOaa	That's 100% fair. COOKING for you is doing something for you. You're an ungrateful little fack feck fick fock f"uck|`|OXXE3T2Aaa	yea sorry to say u lost fair and square|`|HRAqdnGfaa	you lost, you must have had a bit of money to buy something yourself      Also next time keep in mind that she shouldnt be able to ask anything of you|`|AA11537580	sorry you lost, you need her for food.|`|8ff3196b10cd4c3afc116407535b3666aa	It's completely fair. To realize all that she does for you means to realize she buys your food, pays for your shelter and clothing, cooks for you, and many other things. She will always win as long as you live under her roof.|`|BQXg09m9aa	This is SO not real! I don't really beleive this is real, but if it is, you lost fair, and square. You said you didn't need your Mom, yet you need her to cook for you. She was nice enough to let you stay in her house, since you don't "need" her!|`|eQvmKWrFaa	if you didnt have ANY food, the i can understand that. but if you had like canned food or sandwich meat or something like and you asked her to fix you something thats different, but even if you had food you should a fixed it. not hard to fix food, maybe you should have said can we go shopping for food cause we dont have any|`|ntjyM5Q7aa	I'm sorry, but you did lose.  You said you didn't need her to do ANYTHING for you, and you asked her to do something.|`|7TRp1p94aa	"I stupidly said that I didn't need her to do anything for me."...    Hmm, do you still feel that way?   Parents are so disrespected by teens and preteens and they are so ungrateful.    Yes I would say she won.|`|9fqdb4Pvaa	Oh it's fair alright!!  You needed her to go to the shops, buy the food, get it home and cook it.  Granted, you could have probably managed all of this on your own however you were lacking an essential ingredient that you needed from your mum...money.    I hope that this teaches you a valuable lesson...nothing in life comes free!!  When I was growing up we took nothing for granted.  At meal times we cleared our plates or got the food at the next sitting and the next until it was gone.  We didn't get pocket money...we worked for everything...a chore (ie cleaning the windows, or vacuming the entire house, not cleaning up after ourselves) was worth 10p, and we didn't have luxurys until we were old enough to contribute or work for them!!  I was a teenager in th 90s BTW so not so long ago!!  It sounds harsher than it was but we knew about respect and appreciation.    Good on your mum...it's a pity that there aren't more like her..we might not have a society filled with ungrateful hooligans if this were the case!!|`|AKFtOVeQaa	Well, if it was my daughter I would have to say no.  I'd still cook her food and do her laundry and stuff like that.  But in your case, the way you put it I would have to say you lost.  Read your first sentence. Okay? Sorryy.  And please apologize, because you DO need your mom.  Or else she wouldn't have been put in your life by God.  Hope things work out!:)|`|rVFaSEW9aa	Well sorry to say yes you lost this one because the challenge was for you to survive without her in any type of way, then when you ran out of food, you could've made a bologna sandwichh, turkey slices, spaghetti  . or you could've went over a friends place. .maybe if you really stuck to your word and not asked her for anything at all things would've been differentt. since your young you have a few things to understand such as not taking those who care about you for granted..acting spoiled and crying only goes so far...  once you have a clear understanding of  that then apologize to your mom things will get better..as for the phone let me ask you if you got a job and your first pay check was the same amount it took to get your phone on, say 150 bucks or more would you waste the money on a new phone?, phones are expensive once that bill shows up who pays for it..try to be a good daughter you really have it good.  maybe you should try to help your mom out instead of annoying her..it might help your situation more..best of luck..sorry if i sound mean ..you just neede point in the right direction to not make wrong choices in your life it starts with a firm, stable understanding then reality sets in..good luck to you and your family..|`|pgmIFTZhaa	get over it !!! wat a loser who cares! all parents r like that SO grow up
3X0Lsk5caa	Leave. He is emotionally abusive. Contact your department of social services and ask what programs are available to help victims of abuse. If they aren't going to help you, find SOMEWHERE to stay for a few nights. Then go to social services and tell them you are homeless. There are plenty of programs out there to help you get on your feet and set you up with housing and food. Don't make excuses to stay, I know it seems like their are no options, but there are. Best of luck.|`|FmSWPS7Paa	wow thats amazing about how much bull **** you put up with that asshole. You definitley need to leave him. You dont sound very happy at all or even benefitted from this relationship. he needs to grow up. but he prolly wont anyways. So do you have family? your mothers? aunts? cousins? somewhere where you can go untill stuff can be sorted out?  all i can say is that if your not happy then you need to get out esp after three kids! good luck my friend and i wish you the best. where do you live again?|`|F3dWvVy5aa	I did that and stayed and stayed . Ugh I swear I felt soo much better on my own. You really need to just start looking for jobs to get money so you can get on your own. it may take some time but set a date for yourself. I mean you are very pregnant and may be stuck til after you have the baby. You can however start working otu and taking care of yourself. get back down to fighting weight. So if you do date you will feel comfortable taking clothes off. I really think you should look for work, even if its in a daycare so you can get a reduced rate. Then I would be outta there! I stayed and wound up with baby number 4.  Now I am on my own and I love it!! I eat donuts if I want and dance around the living room to loud music, its great. dump the loser.|`|AA10767325	Wow, I'm so sorry you have to go through this crap. Make some phone calls. Find out what kind of services your community offers for low income single parents. It's time to get out now while the children are little so you don't waste your whole life letting this jerk effect your self esteem and let your babies think his behavior towards others is okay..Find out whatever resourses are available to you and use them. It won't be easy but you're better off without him. Good luck.|`|KQX2BA5Gaa	I advise you to keep calm as you are 30 weeks pregnant now. Right now, eat healthy food, play with your kids, live happily till the baby is born. Drink a lot of water , walk for 30 minutes a day, so it will be a normal delivery. Meanwhile get information about jobs - talk to friends, your parents, other family members. One immediate job you can get is as nanny or babysitter at daycare centers. There you can keep your kids as well as earn. That helps initially. Slowly develop credit. Enroll yourself for a course which can get you a job. Meanwhile work on what courses are better leading to a secure job. Be happy now and concentrate on pregnancy.   Good luck.

at9qW0gLaa	I don't really know if the day off could have impacted your blood pressure but I think the protein in your urine is a concern since it is accompanied by heightened BP. I have been on partial bed rest for about a week now because of possible pre-eclampsia.  It started with my BP beginning to rise as well as a lot of swelling in my feet, legs and hands. (sometimes in my face as well.)  About 3-4 weeks ago they began keeping a closer eye on me and bringing me in more to check my urine and BP.  At my appt today I had protein in my urine and my blood pressure remains a bit high so my doctor has scheduled me for an induction next week. I would say if your blood pressure is on the higher end that you should not be working. I am sure that your doctor will watch you and make sure that if you need to stop working that you do, and that if anything else is going on, you will be closely monitored.    Oh I forgot to mention that I started seeing stars(or what looked like bright lights)  a lot too but have been seeing them less now that I am taking it easy.|`|Faw2iBtfaa	Yes, that is a bad thing.  You should call your doctor and let them know that is happening.  Better to be safe than sorry.  High bp can lead to stroke and seizures.
Tjr9aObNaa	Nope...|`|3c8GsRvUaa	i would invite more friends but it all depends on your kid i would find it cool.|`|ozATw7s0aa	That sounds fun.

8am8ExsKaa	I am 12 weeks pregnant with my second baby. My symptoms around 5-7 weeks were sore breasts, nausea & some vomiting but not every time, and very tired and sleepy all the time. I still can not get enough sleep. My November 16 so about 4 weeks. Best wishes on the results your wanting!|`|BepzNmowaa	my hands turned a little red on the palm  my nipple where sore  and i was verrry tired!!  but it took me about three weeks before i started developing symptons and i got sick around 5 weeks!   good luck!|`|dc81da2d89eef9b38499524fbc9b5288aa	I am 6 weeks pregnant.  Sore breasts, they are also getting bigger.  Period like cramping that comes and goes, VERY tired.  LIke, I want to go to bed at 8pm some nights.  My last period started on December 22nd and I am pretty sure I concieved on January 5th (felt the ovulation cramps that day) and I am due September 28th.  You would be about a week ahead of me, so around 7 weeks or so.  I tested positive on a $1 pregnancy test in the evening 4 days before my period was due.  Then I took a "good" test a few days later and never did I see such a dark line!  Good luck!!|`|AA11234404	Last period for me was dec3-dec7. I am 8wks pregnant. First positive result was Dec.31!!! I am only sleepy. Nothing more. Nothing less.
Qn5mn99vaa	My doctor thought I was pregnant with twins right at my first visit (6 weeks.). My uterus was measuring bigger than normal and I already had a bit of a bump. She sent me for an u/s and sure enough I had twins. I felt normal, same as when I was carrying my first. I didn't feel worse until around 10 weeks. Severe morning sickness, excessively tired. That didn't last very long though, only a couple of weeks.|`|UTjWlj9Yaa	The same as if you're expecting at all... Possibly a bit amplified but usually it's a surprise unless twins run in the family:) You won't know until the ultrasound.|`|uOp2sdiQaa	well, an ultrasound will tell you if you are having twins, i didn't find out til i was 6weeks along. i read that you will get alot of morning sickness, which i didn't get. i've had a very easy pregnancy, but now that i'm 31 weeks along, my body is starting to get sore and having a hard time walk and such.    good luck hun=]|`|WxQFe0GYaa	You'll have an ultrasound showing two babies.|`|VGoCh2C9aa	i had no symptons for twins at all and only found out on my 12week scan! I was very shocked|`|SmzUG4pkaa	missed period
Nux5S6oVaa	It's honestly when you personally feel ready.    I think 24-28 is a good span.  I'm 26, I graduated college, became a RN, got married, bought house, became financial stable, got traveling out of my system, enjoyed the freedom of being a young 20 yr old, building a new house, switched jobs numerous times and now feel blessed I am bringing a little one into the world in 9/09!|`|5b2fd4a4183ac1d65721171ad7b2843caa	As soon as you are able to financially support a child, and have someone you wanna have a baby with.|`|9XybFUpXaa	ha...your probaly not going to like my answer but i'm going with the first person age dosen't define how good of a parent you are, it all depends on your maturity & your responsibility to handle & care for a child.  Yes there are some teenage mothers who just don't have their acts together BUT then you have those who climb to the top.|`|JvkYEX9Vaa	it's not on the number.. it's on your attitude and getting ready for responsibility.|`|CVQa88Ujaa	I would have to say 28 b/c when my mom and dad were married my mother got pregnant when she was 28 and my dad was 32 I think that is the perfect age to have a child.|`|nAOlBmzDaa	I had one at 22, one at 25, and I'm pregnant now at 34, and I can say that aside from pregnancy being a little "tougher" in the 30's, the parenting will be MUCH better. So I'm going with early 30's is the best time to have a baby... or two... or 3 ... :)|`|n86nMfbtaa	How is anyone supposed to give you a number? It's ignorance to think an "age" will define how good of a parent you are.

B1JFBV3jaa	Plan B can cause abnormal bleeding (sometimes as heavy as a period).  The overdrive of hormones tends to throw your body for a loop.  If it was pretty heavy, your body might now have anything else to get rid of on the 27th.  I would take a pregnancy test though just to be sure.  I don't think you have anything to worry about.  Anytime Ive taken Plan B, it's caused me to start my period early (by a couple of days).|`|0TrvUZPGaa	i am in the same situation hope you get the answer you want best of luck x :)|`|dn2UCOkqaa	TAKE A ******* TEST|`|rbHGeNsCaa	probably just freaking out|`|ylgNuE3uaa	It's a common side effect to have some bleeding or spotting with the Plan B... even if you just had your period.    However, I would recommend, calling your clinic and asking them yourself, just to put your mind at ease.    You should consider going on a regular method of birth control ASAP. It sounds like you have unprotected sex and your boyfriend just "pulls out". You are definitely going to end up pregnant if this continues to be your only method of birth control.    Plus, you might want to consider the chances of coming into contact with STDs.    I wish you luck!|`|YeyPROgAaa	Pee on a stick and use protection if you're not trying.|`|9wN2nTZOaa	Only true answer to that question would be to get a pregnancy test and find out because the answer to that yes and no... Some women do get there periods more then once and other may not it can be possible for you to be pregnant but to be really sure take the test...|`|uEHANGqfaa	i really think you should try a pregnancy test, then you'll know for sure. best of luck :)
srJNVxS6aa	Its hard to say since you have irregular cycles, because there is no way of knowing when you ovulated really.  If you had sex during ovulation, an average couple has a 25 percent chance of conceiving.  Test 19 days after you think you got pregnant.  Or wait until the 32 day mark  You really arent supposed to get symptoms until the test is positive, but you can notice symptoms like sore breasts and fatigue a little earlier than the other symptoms.  Morning sickness usually takes 6-8 weeks from you LMP. But every one is different.|`|YeyPROgAaa	I was irregular, and tested constantly.  I was 3 weeks late with my expected period before it showed up, but I'm irregular and ovulated later.    I'd test 3 weeks after your expected missed period, since theres the chance of chemical pregnancy and you not really being pregnant.

2f6diQBiaa	Many pregnant charts are not triphasic, so it's totally possible. If you don't chart at the same time every day and your temp fluctuates, this will not affect ovulation. It only affects the ease with which ovulation can be detected. If your temps are very variable, it could be that you ovulated and just wasn't able to detect it because you weren't taking it at the same time. My first time charting, my temps were also very variable. The more you get used to doing it the better (less fluctuating) it gets.    Hang in there! Good luck and lots of baby dust!!!|`|Ql44BXFHaa	for bbt to be accurate you need to take temp at same time each day.  if that's not possible you may want to try another method of predicting ovulation.  after ovulation your bbt should increase and will begin decreasing right before you start af.  if you are preg it should stay up.
QH5oOFutaa	My bestfriends mother had a very healthy baby boy at the age of 45. She didnt take the amniocentesis or the CVS. They prefer you to because the risks go up when you are pregnant over the age of 35 for DS etc. Its 1:300 ratio for mothers over 35 for DS and 1:2,000 for women under the age of 30. Just a precaution thats all. And my mother had my younger brother at 38 years old, never had any tests either. hes a perfectly fine, healthy teenager.|`|GxlkhRfoaa	My aunt had her youngest daughter over the age of 40 and she's fine.  She had EVERY test done that they offer during pregnancy.  And also it would be considered a high risk pregnancy so you would probaby have an ultra sound monthly or weekly.  I think as long as you are in tip top shape for your age your risks of having a child with a disease are low.|`|Slr6jtMGaa	i baby sat a BEAUTIFUL baby boy.....his mom was 42 i believe....|`|9b633eae216aabb3c79632f53549b57aaa	no but ive seen several documentaries on it and the baby came out completely healthy. the oldest ive herd about was in her 50's!|`|5puE2Qfpaa	Yep! She was 47 yrs. and her baby is 5 yrs. now. Went through the normal procedure as the rest of us.|`|vLFUtWuoaa	My mother jest had a baby two years ago. She was forty two.|`|O5aM5xuhaa	My great-grandmother had my grandmother at the age of 49, This was in the year 1948. My great grandmother had nine children before my grandmother, so in total she had ten children. My grandmother lived a full and happy life. But sadly passed my grandmother passed away at the age of 34 due to cancer.|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	My best friend's mom had her at 43.  They are the healthiest and most fit family I have ever seen.  I don't know about her pregnancy sorry.|`|dPULl5hjaa	I conceived our son at age 37 & he was fine & now he's 13!|`|mrYCeWoMaa	Nancy grace, from CNN gave birth to twins at the age of 49, and they are a little over a year old now. And have no idea if she took any tests during pregnancy though i'm sure she did because anything over 35 is a high risk for birth defects and everything.
kdPXhPijaa	Oh my!  We get so many 13/14 yr old FALSE pregnancy questions here, its hard to tell when U r being fooled!    Oh well! If it was unconsented sex and U r realy 13, then U should quickly report to your parents. Well, consent or not, U r a minor and that is STATUTORY RAPE      EDIT: And so I looked into mommyinMay and joesgirl_mllm's responses and decided that this is a FAKE QUESTION. So I take my answer back!!  Why do you come on here and tell people a whole bunch of lies??|`|471ca0c8552c4633e525815ba702310aaa	Tell your mom everything including the unconsented part. I hope she presses charges of rape on the little pecker's @ss! Even if it's your boyfriend it's still rape.|`|iwYu32N2aa	You asked a question before saying that your 15 and pregnant. so which is it 15 or 13?  http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|JnLoHaoAaa	If it was unconsented, regardless whether the guy was a boyfriend or complete stranger, it was not your fault in any way. Tell your mother and she will help you out|`|b4b38acbe2582b7a823dd09b00982594aa	If your boyfriend forced you to have sex with him you need to tell your mom ASAP and then go to the cops. You should have told her (or at the very least another trusted adult) the day that he did that to you. Just talk to your mom, she'll be there for you since you were raped. I hope you're no longer with your boyfriend. You're too young to be having sex and nobody deserves to be treated that way.|`|v8AYoQPeaa	oh lord.|`|jNgh3e3Faa	Tell your parents and let them handle the boyfriend.   I hope you are not still with him.   :(  Rape is often by boyfriends or friends.   It is still wrong.|`|AA12275780	you need to get an abortion you are too young to have a child.  It is not right to bring a child into this world when you yourself are a child too.|`|mTyu7CKoaa	mom im sorry but im pregnant...that easy|`|AgPDg010aa	You just need to be honest. She will be disappointed but understanding. She loves you. If you're really nervous you could write her a letter.|`|Iav8FN0Aaa	Oh this is ********, I'm sick of seeing fake pregnancy questions here, either you're just trolling or you put on a lot of weight on.|`|Mv5RFu1yaa	how can u be 14 wks p[regate cuz i looked at ur other answers and u mentioned u were  in 3rd term or 7 months|`|qKnE08Rxaa	I know you are scared... Telling your mom can be scary too but telling her will make everything better. Believe me! It's all going to be okay so don't worry & just discuss with your mom, sweetie~|`|IVNM1O5naa	At 13, there is no easy way to tell your mom. You just need to come out and tell her. She will be mad, but will get over it in time.|`|kqboJuvvaa	Just be honest and tell her. As a mother it would yes upset me, but I love my girls with all my heart and would do anything to help them and be there for them through their toughest times. Your mother will love you no matter what you do, it's in our blood. Tell her as soon as possible. Figure out what can be done together. Be strong.|`|ki5hZbcTaa	you need to tell her NOW because you really need to have prenatal care. Not just for the health of the baby but for your health as well. Some pregnancy issues can cause major health issues for mom. You are past the point where abortion is legal so that is not an option. (I wouldn't suggest it anyway b/c I'm pro-life) but just telling you. You have the choice to either keep the baby or give it up for adoption but you still need to take care of yourself during this time. She might be mad but you will need her support.    edit: okay why did I even bother answering this question? I saw the other one you posted. Quit playing around on the computer and go play with your dolls. The internet is for grownups not immature kids|`|CHl95Nneaa	first of all  Never Abort it is wrong  u should just sat ur pregnant and hope she understands   if she doesn't then just move into ur boyfriends house   or you could also take the test more than once   but please do  not abort just put him up for adoption|`|KQX2BA5Gaa	Talk to her immediately. Tell her "Mom, I need to talk to you. Do you have some time to listen to what I tell you. This is about my life" Then tell your story. Good luck.|`|JMcY86IDaa	Trust me there is no way you can hide it. If you tell her now there are things she can do to help. If you wait to long then she's going to be more mad and the pregnancy would be to long down the road to do anything.|`|kpnSKV6Eaa	there is only one way to say " mom im pregnant"|`|u5c8eS9gaa	Ok, first and foremost I REALLY hope that you are not seeing this boy any more. Second just sit down with your mom and explain the hole thing to her. Start off by telling your mom that there is something that you need to tell her and explain the hole story about what happened to you. Because if it was truly unconcerned then you were rapped by that boy and I really hope that your mom would be understanding of that fact. Then once you have explained what happened tell you mom that you are pregnant. Ask her to schedule you an appointment with an OBY/GN and that way you will be able to speak to the physician and they will be able to better explain you options to you and your mother. I really hope that everything works out for you. May God bless you and keep you safe.|`|cdE4ELKlaa	2 weeks ago you were 15 and pregnant, your mom and you were having your baby's a month apart and she was very supportive. I don't usually check someones other questions but you are a troll.|`|FSOggfNRaa	I know your scared to tell your mom, trust me I know. I was 15 when I found out I was pregnant. But you got to for you and your baby safty. It's really important to go to the Dr. on regular bass to make sure u and the baby are ok. Im sure she will still love you. Yes she may be mad or very disapointed but she'll come around. And you need to tell her that your BF forced you! That's not right. And don't get an abortion. It's very wrong. i know your only 13 but it is still wrong. If you don't want to keep the baby give it up for adoption. But just go to your mom and say mom I have something very important to tell you. (don't say please don't be mad at me) And tell her my BF forced me to have sex and I am 14 weeks pregant. I hope I helped.|`|GlKq5stKaa	in one of your other questions it says your 15. You are such a liar. I hate people like you who make up things on here!

I am no ultrasound tech but I have 2 girls and a boy coming in 9 days.  All of which I could figure out before the tech told me.|`|4nAl9Y7Baa	It looks like a girl to me but I'm not a doctor lol but that's what my daughter's ultrasound looked like.|`|6EIdLkS7aa	I think it's a boy!  When it's a girl, you will see three little lines.    I'm absolutely NO expert though!  Try looking up pics online to compare!|`|sBHhnDwaaa	Toilet shot makes you know its a girl.

7EOLTC20aa	I just had mine done at 18 weeks and they weren't able to give me a definite boy/girl answer because the baby kept moving (which is always a good thing!) and the cord was between his/her legs.      I believe that by 20 weeks, the baby's genitals are developed to the point that if it's a boy, the testicles have dropped and are able to be seen clearly along with the other male parts, and if it's a girl it is pretty clear that there aren't any other parts there even if the cord if down by the legs.  At least that is what my ultrasound tech told me.    I would see if you could wait to have your sonogram until after you get back.  I know that waiting for something like this, especially with your 1st baby, can seem like torture, but I would rather have been able to wait to have mine done and have a definite answer than have it when I did and only be able to go on a guess!|`|C55pji5Qaa	We found out at 16 weeks and it has been verified again and again. However, I did not buy anything until it was confirmed with another ultrasound but if the baby cooperates you should get a good idea.|`|53QQ9KXEaa	I found out at exactly 17 weeks... So, I think it's possible.     Good luck|`|xRZ1PRZwaa	I know you're on pins and needles, but you may be better off to schedule the appointment for after your trip. It will very unlikely to find out gender at 16 weeks.    Usually they can determine it at 20 weeks, sometimes as soon as 18.    Can you wait? Either way - I hope you enjoy this wonderful experience!|`|cfdooGylaa	I think its better to do it after you come back. The most important thing about that scan is not checking the gender, its seeing if there are any birth defects, etc. Those things ( along with the gender) are more easily seen anytime after 18 weeks. Good luck and congrats.|`|kdPXhPijaa	16 weeks , yes! But for a more definitive result, 18 weeks and above.    Cant U schedule one for much later, like 20 weeks, if U will be back then, Since its not for medical reasons and U just want to check the baby's gender, I will say THE LATER THE BETTER|`|DNygQdmVaa	Itd be better to wait. But in some cases they can tell at 16 weeks. It just depends. If your too anixious just take the chance.|`|1K0n0Sk8aa	i think you can you just have more chance of finding out at 18 weeks, cant you have the appointment after you come back ??|`|Qd5fQpMYaa	My sister just recently found out at 15 weeks she was having a boy. And my mom found out at 16 weeks with all 4 of her pregnancies that we were girls. =) Good luck!|`|8fr7tMfYaa	They can tell then, but sometimes they are incorrect this early.  The best thing for you to do would be to wait till you come back.|`|GJ0IDpULaa	i've had it done with my first child at 16 weeks and we found out the sex then but with my last three it was at 20 weeks with my second , 24weeks with my third and 11 weeks and 18weeks with my fourth so it really depends whose giving the sonogram and how long they've been doing it for.|`|V7Q7SbHfaa	I found out at 13 weeks and it was correct.  They say that they baby develops its sex organs at 12 weeks.  I also know someone who found out at 12 weeks.  As long as the baby is in a good position you should be able to find out.  Good luck!
VgQy2haaaa	keep persisting and if he doesn't believe you catch his brother in a lie.  just to cheer you up though call this number it is hilarious.     781-452-0819 good luck sweetey! ;D|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	He isn't worth your time.|`|WLwnOePMaa	It's his brother. I'm sorry, but no matter how deep of a relationship you and him have, he's going to believe his brother. That bond is pretty unbreakable under normal circumstances. Sorry things kinda work out that way. I know how it feels when a boyfriend believes a family member over you. Its not fun but the trust they have usually doesn't change.|`|AGcwdZGmaa	who cares all your Q are always about crap|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Well. I'd dump him.

What are you talking about?|`|Lr3lZ4draa	remember bloods thicker than water.   you lied once, and of course hes gonna believe his brother over you.
wzjL2itMaa	Any woman, any age can die during child birth. The thing I would think with being 14 is that her body is not mature enough to handle such a tough job.|`|kQA7SbY9aa	I guess lack of pre-natal care could play a factor. Or lack of proper labor and delivery care?    I have to wonder where in the world you live that so many teen pregnancies have resulted in death. That's very rare in many parts of the world.|`|yjhpBM11aa	why the **** is a 14 year old having sex?|`|oaF2kaXAaa	not unless there are certain health issues the girl has... everything should be fine.|`|5b73ZOhkaa	Maybe from pain if the pain is not treated and she cant handle it|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	The only thing I can think of is an angry father.    Death from childbirth is extremely rare.  How many teenagers does this guy know that got pregnant?|`|PwHQSAxvaa	These things happen. It should be rare, unless you live in a country where those without money get 3rd world health care, like the US|`|x4uGfC4oaa	Severe internal bleeding.|`|70c1c2e410f2cdd8e3cd8235784e9689aa	There is no reason for ANY person do die during pregnancy.  If your body is able to conceive, it is typically able to support it.  I think your boyfriend has to stop worrying.  Maybe those other girls killed themselves?  Or had some serious type of medical issue.  How many friends does he have anyway, that got pg as a teen?|`|dSuZ5x1Saa	Blood loss, and a few other things.  I know someone who gave birth at 14. She had to have a complete blood transfusion. She now can never have children again because her uterus and cervix are so ruined.|`|62fa2d0c6e8de6507e574cf4131634dfaa	It can be dangerous for a very young woman to give birth. However, if she has good prenatal care and takes the advise of her Dr., she'll probably be fine. Not easy for a 14 yr. old.Hope she has a lot of support.|`|s815uPJVaa	probably aether not taking care of her self or like a heart attack|`|Jusnu14oaa	thats not true just there time to die|`|mzhFrm5Taa	She will die of a common disease called being a skank.|`|EgGrKWjxaa	Usually a 14 yr old wont die.  You might try to google it though|`|1gooDEfLaa	because she's 14 and your not developed in the hips the way a woman who is older and other health problems my "sister" got preg at 15 and was bed ridden because she was to small
wKsUI9Wdaa	They use it because it has something to do with hormonal balence and acne is manly caused by hormones.|`|vKEYa8aeaa	because it not only helps acne, it protects against pregnancy, helps with pms, regulates the period, etc.|`|r0ISrLc1aa	because it regulates your hormones which cause some of the acne, it actually does work with some people, it depends what kind of acne you have    but wait are you sure your sister wasnt on acutane for the acne? becuase acutane is a 6-month treatment of pills that cures your acne, and you have to be on birth control while you're on it.|`|ZllkWRIOaa	thats strange|`|6ucVuo10aa	......thats stupid|`|92a5d180da3a67afa485c8c161fbd739aa	What's your problem with birth control? I had used numerous types of acne medications (REAL acne medications from the derm.) and nothing helped mine at all.

The egg only lives for 24 hours, though.|`|yjhpBM11aa	Sperm can live inside of a woman for up 2 5 days!|`|nzGdMWbZaa	No its normal|`|rdpZrBc9aa	If you are counting on them dying before 5 days, that's probably not safe!  It only takes ONE!|`|DuCxFQywaa	nope they can last up to 7 days unless they r touched by oxygen then they die!
QGkBZFqWaa	Unfortunatly, I always spend my money on dumb crap :[|`|Nnqw6AU3aa	Both.  I'm an impulsive shopper, too.  I had $20 and I went and bought a massive  bottle of shampoo and the next day I decided  to return it.

Also, I hate spending my dad's money because I feel really guilty, even though he is a lawyer and has his retirement and salary.  I still feel bad.|`|Jucak0HLaa	I try to save it,but I don't realize that i use a little here and there,and by like a month later it's gone.|`|ynAXDyQDaa	I put away some money and then spend the rest :)|`|ZllkWRIOaa	save, thats what smart people do|`|0xiHNsmVaa	I save.

haEvaN7Daa	I am not sure how bad you have CF as I know some cases are much worse than others.  My brother has pretty severe CF and is 32.  He had a bi-laterial lung transplant a few years ago.  He has never spoke of having children, but what I do know is that if you take care of YOU and follow the Doctor's orders EXACTLY and continue to question/research everything you should be fine.  My brother was told that he would not live to be a teenager and now his doctors call him an amazing specimen.  :-)  Maybe you are too!  Keep your head up and the best of luck!  Remember, people with CF (especially severe cases) aren't living because of luck.  They are living because they are fighters.  Find a good support system and stay focused.  *hugs*  Congratulations on your baby!  :-)|`|mx3gFmIKaa	Wow, what does your family think?  Do you have family support?  Suggest discussing with bf about what your wishes are sooner than later, statistically you will need to make arrangements for your child being that the life expectancy for CF is so low (35 and thats if born in 2006), wishing you luck in defying the odds.  Has your boyfriend been tested to see if he is a carrier?  Since you have two affected genes the baby will get 1 from you and at least be a carrier.  You would certainly be considered high risk and should be monitored closely by specialists.  I have not ever encountered a woman with CF who was able to get pregnant.  Hopefully you can find a website for support too.  Good luck.
WlU3NFu6aa	my daughter is 13 mo today. she can point to her hair, ear, feet. she just cant seem to get where her nose it LOL. She says many words if you can call it that. she says mama, dada, papa (for grandpa), baba, sock, sshhhhhoe, dud (for her duckie), wow-wow (for all dogs) mo (for moon-she'll point and say mo), bus, bye, nana (for banana), yes, no,outside (when she wants to go outside), dow (when she wants you to put her down), mum mum.|`|C5ZocttQaa	she can tell us what she wants, she knows where her nose and eyes are, she says names, and one to a few word sentences, she can say please, shes very smart|`|TQScv7Tcaa	My daughter is 16 months and she can point to her nose, hair, belly and blinks her eyes when you ask where they are. She says mum, dad, nan, pa, pop, bottle, dummy, shoe, more, ta, bye, hello, baby, bath, bikkie, shut the door (da da daw), all gone (aww gawn), NO, woof (for dog), birdie, car. When you ask her if she is hungry she walks to the kitchen, when you ask if she wants a bath she walks to the bathroom, she knows what "do you want to go tata's or outside means", she has done and said most of this since 14 months but her speech has become more clear in the past 2 months. Still alot of what she says only people who spend alot of time with her can understand. She is a little advanced i think but not especially so. You will be amazed more every day over the next few months it is alot of fun :)
GJ0IDpULaa	Your cervix is getting in position for the baby to come out you start out at 0% eface or faced out all the way up to 100% eface. You could be no dialation and 70% face out or dialated to 2 and no face out so im guessin your probably 50% face out since she said almost  faced out but im no expert or dr just a women with 4 kids. But walking helps in getting things moving along. So does having sex it helps your cervix dialate but if your feeling like i was with my fourth and thats like a huge cow who was scared to squish her partner then walkin helps. Good luck and have your bag by the door.|`|DQWh4VHpaa	I believe this to mean that your are getting there just relax and let the baby take his course. the baby is right there and ready to say hello.

r0BHJk6Yaa	first thing you need to do is NOT STESS OUT..i know thats hard...but if and only IF you are having a threatened misscarriage, stress is the worst thing for you. you need to get lots of bedrest, drink lots of water, dont stress. you need to fake an illness if you dont want anyone to know..and stay in bed...DO not stress out.    Wait a few days and see how it progresses.   If you find you bleed really heavy and have bad cramps... after say 5 days.. you need to go to the hospital..or doc first then hospital...  if your 7 weeks along u may need a curette... (which is where they scrap your uterus) and i kno it sounds scary but it wont hurt a bit... its nessessary or you might have major problems...    just try to relax and see how it goes..  some preg women experience this and go on to have perfectly normal pregnancies...  some will m.c    so if you just relax and see how it goes you will be ok..,  talk to another adult if you need to.|`|7c9a6ac2b60c434d81159b0728373573aa	Ok..the brown that you see is old blood. The pink could be lot of things. Did you take a test and have a positive result? If you did I would go to the ER immediately. Better to be wrong and safe the right and do nothing. If you are miscarrying there isn't anything that can be done but let nature take it's course but sometimes nature doesn't and the docs need to step in to help you.   As for the cramping...if the bleeding is nothing it could be gas or (for us strange ones) your uterus expanding. I know you aren't supposed to get that at this point but I did.  If you have seen on OB/GYN call their after house and tell them if you haven't I would go to the ER and be checked. It's better to be over reactive.|`|FA710vETaa	i had implantation bleeding around this time you should be ok but you should go to the dr if it continues|`|DNygQdmVaa	you need to go to the dcotor or the ER.|`|nzGdMWbZaa	you should see a dr.|`|X0xHXDcTaa	It could just be normal spotting. When is your normal period? A lot of women will have cramping and spotting around the time that their period would have been due. When I miscarried I had bright red streaks of blood. Sounds to me like it is probably nothing, but I would go to the ER or call your dr in the morn and ask to be seen. At this point if you are miscarrying then there is really nothing that can be done.....I will pray for your situation! I know how hard a miscarriage can be! I miscarried at 16 1/2 weeks.|`|hgTR8Uzaaa	If you are worried about it, you need to go to the doctor.  Even if a doctor responded to your post, it would be impossible for him/her to give you an accurate answer.  You need to get checked out.      Tell your parents.  If that is too hard, tell a teacher, friend's parent, aunt, cousin, adult friend, youth pastor, etc.  But you need to go to the doctor.|`|oaF2kaXAaa	Take a deep breath... and Breathe. You need to get checked asap. Theres no sense sitting around your house worrying... is there? Take care and best wishes.|`|HCMrR1O9aa	ok, this happened to me and i miss carried!!! go to the HOSPITAL just to make sure ok???? just to  be safe ok hun?? i hope your ok!!!|`|0xWAHvKYaa	I never had implantation bleeding either....that happens early on like within 2 weeks after sex.... but I did notice around my 7th or 8th week that I was bleeding a bit and when I wiped the second time a little later it was still a little red but the doctor said everything was ok.  Red blood is fresh blood (new) but brown blood is old blood so if I were you I would make a doctor's appointment to be sure everything is normal.    But it could as well be your period, I have had mine 3 weeks late before too...did you ever take a home pregnancy test to be sure?  I'd take one just to be sure first.    If you are in fact pregnant I know you are scared to death about telling your parents but trust me, they may be upset about it at first but they are going to be even more upset if you wait until you are further along to tell them.  They are your parents, they will love you no matter what and they definitely won't hate you.  You are their child, their daughter and they love you.  Just be sure to tell them, they will give you the best advice because they were once your age.|`|8hwGmfs8aa	dnt worry at all in 19 nd had the same thing....its totally normal unless there are clots in the blood.....wen i was 8 weeks i started cramping nd bleeding nd the doctor told me 40 percent of pregnant woman will bleed during pregnancy its ok i am now 24 weeks nd havnt bled since ....im sure if you tell your parents they wud b fine nd take you straight to the hosp after all it is the grandchild to b if you dnt want to thn jus try relax..... bu i really doubt your having a miscarraige ......yes bleeding is a sign but you can bleed during pregnancy for many other reason so dnt stress cause tha is worse ha but you nd baby will b fine:):):):)|`|GJ0IDpULaa	If you took a test and it was positive then your pregnant and if so then it sounds like your miscarrying but in the beginning stages of the miscarriage and if i'm right which i am no dr i've just been through what your goin through. This is what to expect if you are miscarrying the pain or cramping is gonna get alot worse i mean its gonna hurt and your spotting or blood in urine is goin to increase and you'll see clotting and not to be nasty but stringy stuff and blobs while having the worst cramps in your life then there will be one big blob that will be really wierd looking so dont trip out about it. Just flush it away cause thats what your body is doing with the miscarrying. BUT IF YOUR BLEEDING is really bad like a pad and hour you have to go to the er. And this is what you tell mom and dad that your bleeding bad and its not normal for your period to make you go through a pad an hour. When you get to the hospital you let the dr. know the truth and let the dr know your parents dont know andyou dont want to let them know and your dr can't tell them anything that you dont want them to hear.|`|EOIxLhBxaa	Since you refuse to do anything about it, you need to take a deep breath and try to calm down. It could be nothing. I bled and had major cramps at 7weeks. They gave me a rhogam shot justincase (i have neg blood dh has positive but you dont know what you are). I ended up being fine. brown blood means old blood so that can be a good sign. Did you do anything strenuous like sex?    If you are miscarrying you can do it on your own in a bathroom but should try to see a doctor to make sure everything has passed. Most dr's won't see a patient until they are 12 weeks along anyway. You might see a clot if you pass the baby.
QP8LdPLeaa	I think Women drool over it WAY too much, its just a man-made made up holiday. we have 365 days in a year and for some reason Valentines day means the world to some women then the rest of the year.|`|XJzyTTbtaa	YES it makes people who don't have a significant other feel like crap|`|wKsUI9Wdaa	Totally true to the people above me!

It's not like we get school off for it (in that case, I really wouldn't mind).      This is why my school is having an "Anti Valentines Day" Dance, because it will be Friday the Thirteenth.  It's somewhat lame, but still fun.|`|QSodlfMraa	yeah it is, even if we have a partner.
NysFTExhaa	You'll get a lot bigger faster than other people.  I was told to take extra calcium and folic acid on top of my prenatal since the babies needed more than a regular pregnancy. Find a OBGYN you really like because you'll see them a LOT.  Around 28-30 weeks I began to feel really crappy because I was so big...I was measuring 10 weeks ahead of where I actually was.  Pay attention to your body and don't be afraid to ask questions, my docs said that you can never be too cautious with twins.  You'll probably deliver earlier than a regular pregnancy, might even need a c-section depending on how the babies are laying.  Drink lots of water.    Good luck|`|6avKnzkoaa	You will probably show quicker than a lot of other women who are having singletons. Just take your prenatal vitamins and go to OB appointments etc and I'm sure you'll do splendid. I wish you the best !!! and Congratulations!!|`|hCXjsqA0aa	Before they come, (especially twins.) Make sure you are REALLY well rested. I also reccomend cooking a lot of food that you can store, (Soup, caseroles, etc.) - This way, you don't have to worry about cooking.  Best of luck.  xx|`|3MbtJHq4aa	I am a twin. Identical at that. Eat, exercise daily. Take a vitamin daily. Other than that, congrats and good luck.|`|Azww28cvaa	oo congrats!

PRzmwFfgaa	Does your child have any friends in the class?  Ask them.  And ask your daughter flat out, "Has your teacher hurt you today?"  And then ask her how.  Talk to her about telling you the truth.  And as a mother, always, always, always go with your gut instinct.  Take pictures, go to the head of the school and tell her that your daughter has been coming home from school in this condition and has been unable to explain to you why.  Tell her you have asked the teacher what happened to your daughter and it is completely unacceptable that the teacher cannot explain why your daughter is coming home from school looking like this.  Let them know that it is her job to be attentive to the children in her classroom and either she is not doing her job, or she is hurting your child and they need to take necessary steps to rectify the problem, IMMEDIATELY!  Get angry about this situation, and march into that school and let everyone in there know that you are angry about it.  You are being very passive about a very serious situation.  What if someone else saw these marks on your child and called child welfare services on you thinking that you did it?  Then you would be in a world of trouble.  I would do something about this situation, right away!|`|gG8oyymiaa	Why you asking on here. If I thought my child was being abused I would be looking into it as much as possible. Not asking some people online about what they think on this case when they don't even live in the same town! Why don't you try talking to any of the other mothers and see if they are having anything like this happening with there children.|`|0874a669a08c1d79d874acebac5177bbaa	I would think it a lot more likely that another child is doing this and not the teacher.|`|e43d22697fc95b67db2cbf3fc6d74409aa	Speak to the principal or director and ask that any injuries to your child be documented and signed by the teacher.|`|m2aznd8xaa	if you feel in your heart she is in danger take her out and choose another place and see if the same thing happens if it does than you know that maybe your little one is getting along with the other kids and maybe hurt herself. if you see no more bruises and cut then you know it was the teacher and maybe you should  file a complaint and get an investigation done on that school. mommy have good instincts if you feel she might be getting hurt intentionally get her out of there.   good luck to you|`|f55619778e2c4f36156e3d1508aa6431aa	Ask your daughter if other kids hurt her at school.   Ask her if all the kids are nice to her.   And if that doesn't work then ask her how she hurt herself.   It's easier for a kid to tell a parent that another child could be hurting them if you ask.   Kids that young often think they deserve to be hit if it is done by an adult because they find it hard to believe that an important adult in their lives will ever do anything wrong to them.   When they are a little older they realize that adults can make mistakes, even big ones but for now there is that blind trust.   Little kids need to rely on trusted adults to figure out what is appropriate and inappropriate.      If you keep getting a feeling that something isn't right then take her out of the school.   I would do it (and have done it) just for the peace of mind.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	speak with the teacher & director.  if you suspect abuse, why would you have the child return each day???|`|jvW3a5GYaa	Is it possible that she is doing it to herself? It might be a good idea to look into that possibility before you accuse her teacher.|`|379adf8ec6ff418678fc28b78cee178baa	Children should not be allowed to play rough at school. The teachers are there to protect you child and if you child is being allowed to play rough and get hurt then something is wrong. I would ask to get a report of exactly when your daughter is "misbehaving" and what she is doing. Also, ask to see a log kept of injuries. I know at my daughters school (she is 4 also) they log every scratch, cut, and fall and make sure to tell me about it when i pick her up. I would also ask to come in one day and observe or just show up one day out of the blue to observe. If you arent allowed to do this and they arent able to meet your requests you should really think about finding a new school.|`|20117c2d24d216a72c5b973e9d412b2caa	Just because she is shy around you does not necessarily mean she is shy all the time. Just like adults, children are different in different settings w/different people.   I really don't think it sounds too much like abuse and I gather from you asking on here before going to the authorities that you have your reservations yourself. Just keep a close eye on her and maybe insist that her teacher pay closer attention to her to see where all the cuts and bruises are coming from. It may be from rough-housing or from something medical (I believe something to do w/the equilibrium could cause a child to fall a bit, nothing serious, just something to consider).|`|AA11745717	ok heres what you do. ask the teacher to let you know when she see her roughing with the kids and what they were doing. then if the teacher is abusing her, the teacher will lie to youu saying the cut is from her playing rough on the playground(for example) then ask your daughter about the playground. if you see no signs of her playing rough, then look into it. trust me you can get anything out of a 4 year old, its not hard.|`|3Psi4kBxaa	Ask if you can stay and watch her. The see if this continues.|`|NQ2sDQMRaa	Shes 4, they play a lot and with other kids they play hard, its probably nothing but if you're really concerned talk to some of the other parents and ask if they've noticed anything, if they share your concerns go to the Principle, if the principle wont listen go to the school board.|`|vKEYa8aeaa	go with your maternal instinct...but i doubt that the teacher is physically abusing her, but if you have a gut feeling then go with it and do what you think you need to do.      good luck =]|`|c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	What makes you think it is the teacher?  You should get to the bottom of this...cuts are not normal...|`|AA10943329	lot's of kids get scrapes and bruises without knowing how they happen. Gee's I have cuts and bruises with no idea how they happened.   Kids are very different away from us. If the teacher says she is misbehaving then she will be. You need to find out how is she misbehaving. And just because she is shy does not mean she does not play with others. My daughters friend is shy but with my daughter she comes out of her shell. You should be thankful your daughter is getting over her shyness. If the teacher was abusing her other kids would know about it and at 4 years old your daughter would tell you the teacher did it. Sounds like a simple case of a kid having fun with others to me

9kPPmazoaa	Figure out when you are ovulating and TTC at those times. Also make sure you are BOTH at your healthiest. If you arent already... start taking prenatals and have him take a  mens multivitamin. That way you are at your healthiest.  Also maybe look into preseed. I have never used it but I have heard wonderful things about it.  Good Luck... don't loose faith.    * Also after "doing the dance" make sure to prop yourself for a few minutes. So that everything stays in there for a little while...if you know what I mean. Sorry if TMI... just trying to be helpful.|`|yQdA5rHnaa	my wife and i tried for several months, and just tryed ever other day or as soon there after as we could.

I guess it makes it hard for the guys to swim where they are supposed to.  If you are using lube, try not using it.  We conceived a month after we stopped using it.  Try to relax..take a vacation if you can and get "busy".  Good luck!|`|Du84mgPZaa	GO GET SOME!!!!|`|mdmjsei3aa	Have sex for a very long time and never stop. Eventually it will work. Just keep trying. Maybe its not working cause you are wearing a condom.|`|RFK9sG6zaa	I read somewhere to change the way you are laying in bed.  Start with your head facing North.

e20e778807f334f6575085b3abdf95fcaa	She or her doctor slipped through a legal crack somewhere.   My heart breaks for people like yourself when things like this happen. The unfairness is ridiculous.|`|nuyjnfOfaa	Great question! And why the hell would a Dr give the woman fertillity tx after delivering SIX babies in 5 pregnancies?     Doesn't pass the smell test to me. I feel for your situation as well, its been hard for me to concieve as well and this just makes me sick!    ADD: I wonder how long it will be until those babies are wards of the state? Not hoping that is the case, but as more of this situation comes out, I have some sincere concerns about ALL 14 childern.     And you know taxpayers are going to be supporting her sorry @ss. Sorry but I don't have any pity for her.  She needs a psych evaluation, period.|`|tjgWwfxLaa	i know what you mean i have been trying for 3 years and no babies.  i was pregnant but lost it at 10 weeks.  i was on prometrium to start my periods and femara for my ovulations and they worked until i lost the baby.  my insurance doesnt pay for fertility either and i am willing to do what ever it takes to have a baby.  i go monday to hopefully get more answers.  it is not fair though for her to be able to do this with the money we pay in taxes she would never be able to take care of that many children hell 6 would be to many and all of them the same age is crazy.  well anyways she needs all the prayers to be able to handle it.  i wish you the best and hopefully one day soon you will have your baby.|`|0H1D956Faa	I dont have an answer for how she done it but i cant understand why someone would want to do fertility treatments when they already had 6 kids. i have been trying for 6 years for just 1 baby|`|89b9b79c918cf6555bea31d3d7be7d94aa	her father claimed to have a huge house, so he basically stated that he had money, to be honest i think her pregnancy was for publicity, i wouldn't be surprised if she gets her own show on TLC in a year or so. why would a single mother of 6 (probably with different fathers) go through treatment for more children when clearly she was fertile enough for the first 6. a neighbor stated that she was a young mother, so that makes me wonder even more about her reasons behind the pregnancy.       anyways im sorry to hear about your situation, and hope that in time you'll be able to have a little bundle of joy all your won. talk to your doctor about other types of fertility treatments you can use that your insurance may cover. i wish you the best sweetie|`|j9ta5ulqaa	I usually hate to judge (unless it's politics..lol) but this situation with the 8 babies sounds pretty fishy. I can't imagine how sad a lot of you poor couples are month after month, trying desperatly to have a baby and I know IVF is very expensive. It is very unfair. I can't imagine any dr agreeing to fertility treatments for a lady with 6 kids already. I got remarried and my husband did not have any biological children, I have 5 children and I asked my OB/GYN about untying my tubes and he said WHY? be happy for what u have and if you really want this u may need to do IVF but he would not give his support.My husband has a great job and has great insurance We were financially OK and the Dr was against it. I just think whoever decided to give fertility treatment to this lady has some explaining to do. Plus, I feel bad for the 6 other kids ages 2-7..poor kids. The financial burden allow is scary. I hope TLC or Discovery does not glorify this..Again to every couple on here trying to conceive I pray for u all..Good luck and Baby Dust for all..
TXddP0uxaa	Regardless of what some people choose to believe, ADHD is a real condition with heartbreaking consequences for the sufferer and for his or her family and friends.  A person with this disorder CANNOT control his or her behavior, regardless of any discipline used.  They can't focus on tasks, even those that they enjoy.  Some of them are anxious, nervous people, and others are aggressive and destructive.  ADHD CANNOT be controlled by diet alone.  A child whose behavior is changed by a change in diet has another issue, not ADHD.      Medicine can be an effective aid to treatment, but a course of therapy needs to be implemented as a long term solution.  Therapy can help a sufferer learn to control their impulses, and identify problem areas for themselves, so that they can live with this lifelong condition.    Only you and your child's doctor can determine if medicine is a good choice in treating your child.  You wouldn't fail to give your child tylenol if he had a fever, and a mental condition such as ADHD is just as much an illness.|`|r18PoGJiaa	Please don't do it. I refused to put my son on drugs when he was diagnosed with this stupid made up disease they call ADHD.|`|23033d499769542e5e7910234a60e4f7aa	I never put my ADHD child on meds.... We control his behavior with diet instead...       Watch you sons intake of refined sugars... (You will need to read labels religiously sugar is found in places you wouldn't think of..  Canned vegetable for instance)..  Get a food dehydrator fruits dried are as sweet as sugary treats without the added refined sugar.. (Try some exotic and interesting fruits, get your son involved in choosing some interesting fruits to dry, my son tried watermelon and loves it.)     Look on line there are several sites that cater to diabetics which have sugarless candies, syrups, chocolates etc. without refined sugar.. Look on line for sugarfree recipes (Many of them are as tasty if not tastier than their sugared counterparts)     It took a while (3-5 weeks) on the sugar-free diet for us to notice improvement in behavior and thus grades etc.      My son is now 19 in college and near the top of his class no ADHD meds...|`|JwjFV5Uhaa	im 14 and i have ADHD put who ever it is on focolin (i prob. spelled that wrong) but sometimes it makes you eat less but it helps you pay attention in school    also i took meds since i was about 7|`|prqrQcd1aa	When all else failed with behavior modification and she was on a downward spiral fast, she was very violent and needed to get on meds.   My child is bi polar / adhd. Her meds don't always stop her acting out, in fact her behavior at school is horrid, but she has been doing fine at home. Try getting your son an IEP at school and a behavior plan. By law the school has to do this for children that are disabled. My daughter was 5 and not yet in school, she was heading to kindergarten though.   I know what you are going through trust me! It's not easy, not one bit. If you have already went the route of tss workers, therapists and so on, and you have been consistent with punishment and how he is to act then it's time to get him on meds. If his behaviors don't change or get worse after he is on meds, then you need to get him an evaluation by a child psychiatrist to see if he may have a problem other than adhd.|`|VR9KhbEgaa	I took my son to a behavior specialist dr. After many visits and trying everything they suggested, from various discipline things to cutting all the un- natural sugars from his diet, we all agreed it was time to start meds. He was 5 1/2 when we started this. My son was "kicked" out of 3 pre-k programs, and suspended from school 4 times in kindergarten! I am amazed at the changes I have seen in him! He takes Concerta and Risperdal. We do not use the Risperdal in the summer time and we also cut back his dosage(mg) of Concerta. I hope to one day "wean' him off of this, but for now I feel it is needed and helps his life be easier! He is now 9 and in the 3rd grade. He is in gifted classes at school and has been voted the MVP of his football team 2 years in a row!!! I am so proud of him! The only issues we still have are the normal sibling rivalry issues at home ( he is the oldest of 6). In the end it is your choice, but I will tell you our lives have been amazing thanks to the effectiveness of these meds! Please message me if you need support...I see you are getting some bad messages!!!|`|8HmULotpaa	Hi, the first step is to make sure he has been properly diagnosed.  You  don't mention if he has or hasn;t actually even been diagnosed with ADHD.  If he hasn't visit the doctor and talk about a diagnosis.  This doesn't automatically mean he will go on meds.  many people are diagnosed with ADHD but don't go on meds at all.  But you don't even have the option unless he is diagnosed.    If he has been diagnosed make sure it was thourough.  If the doctor diagnosed him in one consultation go to a different doctor and seek a second opinion.  The doctor should have a long interview with you or several short ones to establish a full history of the child, also at least two days of observing your child, as ADHD kids will vary from day to day and information from his teacher.  As well as a thourough health examination including blood tests to ensure there are no other problems causing the behaviour difficulties.      Once  you have a thourough diagnosis you will be able to make a better informed desicion.  If he does have true ADHD then most likel;y medication will be needed.  This is a medical condition and no amount of discipline can cure it.  Just like no amount of yelling at an epileptic child will stop them having seizures.  It is quite unfair for an ADHD child not on medication because they are in trouble all the time for something they really cant help.    Diet alone can work with a great deal of ADHD kids but it is a lot more complicated than just taking out sugars.  many natural foods are just as bad if not worse.  The correct diet for ADHD also removes many, many healthy foods including nearly all fruit and many vegtables.  As these all make ADHD worse.  It is very difficult to follow and takes great dedication, and generally is only do able if you are a stay at home mother.  You would also need to remove many other things including toothpaste.|`|9nJwsSvPaa	plz dont do this he will end up suicidal!!!|`|q5uYkYsBaa	Let me tell you from a teacher's point of view.  I teach first grade.      I can tell the second a child walks into my door if he/she has taken their ADHD meds that morning.  The child behaves, concentrates, pays attention, and is more well liked among his classmates when he/she has taken the medicine.  They are leaders and very popular among their peers when they have taken the medicine.  They are "model" students when they are on their meds.  Their self-esteem is high and they are confident in their abilities.  They enjoy school and they love to learn.  ADHD kids are often some of the smartest kids in the class.    Without the medicine, the child is fidgity, talks out constantly during lessons, interupts, cannot sit still in the chair or on the carpet for circle time (lays down, rolls around, stands up, dances, etc).  The child gets easily frustrated, cries, pouts, even throws temper tantrums.  They can't remember to do everyday proceedures such as putting their folders into the correct basket.  They lose everything like pencils, scissors, glue, homework and they can't keep their desk clean/organized.  They will spend 15 minutes trying to locate their pencil that they just had in their hand 5 minutes ago.  They can't concentrate on their work.  They get bad test grades.  They throw chairs, books, hit, and kick.  They put pencils, glue sticks, erasers into their mouths and suck on them. The other students in the class basically "shun" the child.  With too many behavior problems and disruptions in the classroom, the student will wind up in I.S.S. (In school suspension) and could quite possible end up at the "alternative learning center".  Having a student attend the "bad school" is extremely heartbreaking to the student, but is necessary for all the other students in the regular classroom to be able to learn without such a problem child disrupting the classroom environment.     You can pick which scenario you want for your child.  I have not exaggerated any of the situations.  This is what I have observed from 11 years in the first grade classroom.       If you want a happy, confident, well adjusted child who listens, pays attention, gets good grades, has many friends and is a popular leader in the classroom, you will let your child take ADHD medicine...and please remember to give it to him each and every day.|`|gSteSrogaa	As a child who was diagnosed with ADHD and put on meds, I would say that if you feel he needs them, get him treated and give them to him. I was so focused while I was on them. I took them from agest 9 - 14. At 14 I refused to take them anymore because my mom was using them as an excuse for me not being "perfect"...I can just say that I was a typical teenager. My grades did go down once the meds stopped and I had to relearn how to control my feelings and anger and such, but I can say the meds truely helped.    Also, something that helped me pay more attention in class was a set schedule. My mom set aside time each day for me to do my homework, and other activities were scheduled at the same time. Predictability and consistancy really helped me.
MHhFMdWoaa	I like Taylor....but not Sophia so much.|`|EIgmm8ilaa	I really like it!!|`|dPULl5hjaa	ok|`|k1StIPdnaa	I really like it.|`|w4kdTalPaa	Nice.|`|5evSFhcDaa	Adorable|`|yPyG3LnFaa	beautiful|`|6qjeneB7aa	I love it! I love the super girlyness of Sophia, and how it's balanced with the unisex Taylor - which I much prefer on a girl anyway. I think it will age really well, and it sounds classy and beautiful.|`|GDWHKzd5aa	emily olivia or emily may olivia!|`|zAHeKvE1aa	That sounds great.

mkph8r0taa	I think it's normal, as long as you are feeling well, just sleepy. My last stretch I went through a major nesting/cleaning phase followed by like a week or two of constant sleeping - then came baby. I was always tired. My advice, let your body get all the rest it needs before the little one arrives, you are going to need it!|`|oaF2kaXAaa	Oh very normal to me... I am sooo sleepy all the time. I am thankful for my daughters nap time. Im 38wks pregnant and somedays I switch from being sleepy to high energy and working on a cleaning project... take care.|`|2AhcNaBzaa	yes it is very normal if you think you're low on something then take prenatal vitamins and dh supplements|`|2irmTjQ3aa	I am the same way, Im 29 weeks and I just found out I have anemia... u should get checked. If not then go ahead and sleep all u want, u wont be able to once baby is here :)|`|sBHhnDwaaa	You're getting sleep stored up for when baby comes.    I'm jealous lol. I can't sleep at all. I'm doing that with eating though!
a7b0f3b04cf7d99c5437ad1f0db9d73eaa	definitely cruel.  i hate both of those made up names and they are WAY too similar.  i don't want to be mean but i'm going for honesty.|`|Tc23KWgzaa	It's not cute.  They sound much-too-much alike.  And yeah, they'd probably face some major teasing, so it may be cruel.  Oh, and I just don't like them.  Either of them.    TX Mom|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Cruel and unusual punishment. They are twins. They their whole lives are going to be trying to be individuals apart from one another. And adding more things to try to make them exactly alike is not a good idea. Give them ways to be unique. Their names are one of them.|`|nCKdkYSyaa	Its OK to do the same first letter but i wouldnt do any more than that. but thats just my opinion..their whole life their are going to try to be seperate people and its going to be hard with almost the same exact name not including someone who also has the same birthday so their the same age, same grade EVERYTHING its probably hard as a kid to be a twin i wouldnt make it any harder for them.|`|EyKJ737daa	Honestly I'd give them their individual names as they are individuals.  While it may be quite while they are young, I think they would resent it getting older and trying to make their own way in the world. Peter and Peta might work for middle names maybe but honestly I'd give them their own names, they are two different people.|`|6ZHAzrA0aa	I LOVE the Rylah and Rylan idea! Another one I like is Michal and Micah.    Rylah Jane and Rylan Zane  Rylah Jane and Rylan Joseph (RJ)  Rylah Ann and Rylan Adam    The names are too cute for nicknames IMO.    ? Taylor|`|RQc8fbjbaa	I am an identical twin, Our names are Kelly & Shelly. It never bothered me.|`|8ff3196b10cd4c3afc116407535b3666aa	I think some matchy names are okay and some are not. These two are overly similar and I don't like them anyway. Two "R" names is one thing but different by only one letter is too much.|`|dXi5trQEaa	why not justin Ryan  and justine Rylah.congrads|`|yPyG3LnFaa	I love matching twin names.     Rylah London  Rylan Patrick    I think Rylah is beautiful so I wouldnt use a nickname. Rylan's nickname could be Ry.|`|wXx0tMxnaa	riley and rylan sound good   if not rihanne and rylan sound good    nickname for girl would be anna maybe|`|kWvtUrwkaa	Rylah and Rylan are too similar.    If you want to be matchy matchy...pick a theme or a letter...however, they are going to be twins forever and already going to be 'matchy matchy'.    Some examples are:   Brooklyn & Braden  Ryanne & Rhyse|`|DycMrGuSaa	Rhayanne (RAY-ANNE) Elizabeth  Ryan (RY-ANNE) Charles     Nickname for Rhayanne = Ray, Anne, Anna, Ray-Ray  Nickname for Ryan= Ry, Ry-Ry    And I am an identical twin. Our names are Joanna and Loanna. It never bugged me, so I guess cute.|`|PUn197AAaa	its awful. you need to give them their own identity. plus those are just awful anmes on their own. Awful Awful Awful. full of awe|`|d8r9qovdaa	i am having twins too! And I have another set already, but I think that's okay because they are boy and girl. Same gender would be odd. I really like the names Rylah and Rylan.    Rylah (boy or girl) [girl] Hope [boy] James  Rylan (boy or girl) [girl] Marie/a [boy] Michael    Rylah- Ry  Rylan-Riles|`|AIkF7Jolaa	dan ann  sam cam(eron)  aidan cayden  dave maeve  tim/jim kim  alejandro alexa (alex & alex)  jamey amy  stephon devon  sorry, that's all i have for now.  i think that you shouldn't make their real names match, but their nicknames, like samuel and cameron ( sam and cam)  there you go, there's my opinion, but it probably won't influence you.  whatever. congratulations anyway.   good luck.
jsBxtO3eaa	It became an issue in the late 1800's when more and more teens began to refuse marriages negotiated by their parents.  They wanted to choose their own husbands and they wanted to get an education and have careers.  Basically, it started when women began to fight for the same rights men had at the time.  Due to advances in medical technology humans live much longer and are healthier.  Hence, women can give birth later in life and they CHOSE to take advantage of that.  Soon after women began to take advantage of their new found freedoms, they soon found themselves pregnant and unmarried and the young men were under no obligation to be forced into marriage by the families involved.  Unfortunately, the fallout of all of this new found freedom was the "old school" beliefs clashed with the younger generation and these young women were scorned for their "improper" behavior and rushed off to have their children and be rushed back home saying they had been to Europe for a year or caring for a sick great aunt.  They still didn't have enough freedom to choose to keep the child if they wanted to.  The parents forced adoption on them.  That mentality led to the current trend of teens being "pressured" into giving up their children so that they could go on with their lives as previously planned.  But, many teens are now refusing.  The problem now is that your parents are legally responsible for you until you turn 18 and over the past 100 years laws have been implemented to protect children from abuse, such as working them, not educating them, etc.  So, the parents are legally obligated to care for their children until they are 18.    So, the stigma with current teen pregnancies revolves around their inability to care for their babies without help from their parents and/or government social programs.  If a teen is able to care for themself and their baby, they can petition the court to emancipate them, which makes them legally responsible for themselves.  This results in taking away the social stigma and all is well.  Adult tax payers simply do not want to pay for programs to raise babies, so they look down on anyone - not just teens that chooses to keep a child they cannot care for financially.    I believe accelerated educational programs and automatic emancipation laws for teen single moms would solve all of these issues.  If you choose to have and keep a baby, then you are on your own and you are a functioning member of society and get the respect you deserve for choosing that path.    Hope this answers some of your questions.|`|cd98c09cc34c3c84ad4502d636e2d2beaa	What is interesting about the stigma is that now that many women are postponing motherhood until their 30s, the same stigma is being put onto women in their 20s, at least as found by these researchers in Canada:     Whitley, R., & Kirmayer, L. J. (2008).  Perceived stigmatisation of young mothers: An exploratory study of psychological and social experience. Social Science and Medicine, 66(2), 339-348.     "Anglophone Euro-Canadian participants in their early 20s felt strongly stigmatised as mothers, which they attributed to their age at parity. In contrast, older Anglophone Euro-Canadian mothers and Anglophone Afro-Caribbean mothers of any age rarely mentioned stigma as a facet of even minor importance. The perceived stigma permeated the lifeworlds of younger Anglophone Euro-Canadian mothers with negative cognitive, emotional and behavioural effects. We argue that such stigmatisation may serve a penological function to affirm and maintain dominant Anglo-Canadian middle-class cultural norms emphasising the importance of education, careers and delayed childbearing for women.  ....  We conclude by theorising that Anglophone Euro-Canadian mothers in their early 20s may now be experiencing aspects of social exclusion traditionally associated with 'teenage mothers.' This may have a deleterious effect on health. "       BTW, teen pregnancy rates now are no higher than they were a century ago.  Nor is there any "epidemic."  The highest rates in the last century were in the 1950s.  They have declined ever since.     Fifty years ago it was a stigma against unwed mothers.  Now it is against adolescent mothers.  As adolescent motherhood remained a cultural norm for impoverished non-white social groups long after white social groups began postponing child-bearing, the current stigma against teen mothers has been shown by sociologists to be closely tied with racism and classism.     Also read "The Scapegoat Generation" for the blame put on adolescents for most of society's ills.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	When your grandmothers were having babies there wasn't much for a woman to do with her life besides get married and start a family.  Women rarely went to college and usually didn't work after they got married.  Women didn't have babies out of wedlock as frequently.  Furthermore a working class man with a high school education could get a decent job that would pay him enough to support a wife who did not work and a few kids.    None of these things are true anymore.  The world is a different place.  Having a baby in your teens means that many of the things that you could do with your life (that your grandmother couldn't, even if she wanted to) are no longer an option.  And an education is more and more necessary to earn the income to raise a family.|`|DHyUnhS1aa	Generally speaking teens having babies is putting a giant burden on the teen's family because most teens (not all) aren't living on their own.  If a teen is having their family pay for everything and take care of their kid then I would have no respect for them.  If the teen has their own job, place to live, and is totally self-sufficient then I wouldn't consider it any more stigmatic than anyone else who is self-sufficient having children.  Personally, I think teens who are stupid and get pregnant before they can support themselves OR the baby then decide to keep it do not deserve support from their parents.|`|2Hot9EJiaa	I am both adopted and have 2 adopted children, and I agree with you 100%.  When I say that I am not saying that I am not thankful that I was adopted, I am.  What I am saying is that some mature teens are able to take care of their children. I know a few that do.  However, I also know a few teens and few older mothers, that should not be mothers at all.  Age really has nothing to do with it.  When a teen or older women gets pregnant and there is absolutely no way that they can raise their child, the option of adoption is awesome and wonderful.|`|n3PE2lvDaa	Whats wrong with being an unmarried mother? Me and my partner are in our 20s and are in a commited life long relationship and planned our daughter. We are not religious and feel there is no need for us to get married. Its just not something we are interested in. Anyway i know this isnt your question but you said you can understand how unwed pregnancys became stigmatized and I dont understand how we should be stigmatized. We are just as good parents as any married couple. we dont need a peice of paper to show us that we are more then capable of raising a happy and healthy child.  I think you touched on some very good reasons of how teenage moms got so stigmatised against. I think alot of it is because of what so many teenagers do these days. most teenagers drink and party when back in your grandparents day they didnt really do that.  In our grandparents day people grew up alot faster then they do today. people judge teenage moms because they compare them to what most people in their age group are doing. They presume that because their 17 year old friends are all partying and drinking that they will want to do the same and so they are not responsible enough to have children. It is very sad for teenage parents that do a very good job raising their kides. It must be hard with so many people looking down on them when they dont deserve it.|`|nQiLLqGeaa	kiwi mum - I don't really think "marriage" has anything to do with it. I think it has more to do with the fact that two people (regardless of gender) will have an easier time rearing a child than one adult (or teen). Guys tend to walk out when teenage girls get pregnant, therefore those girls are frequently left on their own.|`|8Qxb7OZOaa	Ignorance, materialism, lousy parenting skills, profit, agendas.      Good question.|`|gG8oyymiaa	I don't pay attention to them no more. Don't let them get to you. I am young for having a child. They can say all they want, try to downsize me to some low level. But at the end of the day I am still doing what I have to for my child. I will get to see the benifits of my little one growing. I have more for me now at 17 then a lot of grown adults do. So saying that I know I AM a good mother and nothing they can say will change that.|`|Ah6FJHkWaa	I do think though right now there is an epidemic of teen pregnancies as their have been over the past 10 years.  The rate is increasing.  I don't think it is "too young" to parent; however I think work should be done to  PREVENT these pregnancies to start with.    I think the world is different from our grandmothers.  The new generation is a different duck of kids living in a way different world.|`|Kr09aQJkaa	My 14 yr old great grandma got pregnant out of wedlock. This was in 1927. She married her 16 yr old boyfriend, he got a job with the railroad and they lived with her parents for 1 year while he built a house for them. I don't mean he hired someone to build it, he built it himself. They stayed married for 46 years until she died and they had 6 more kids.    I don't think 14 and 16 yr olds are this responsible today. And there aren't many jobs a 16 yr old can find today with no education that would pay to support a family.    That's just one theory.    edit:  I just read my answer again. Holy Crap! My 16 yr grandpa worked as a switchman for the railroad. The railroad. My 16 yr old worked at McDonalds and complained the whole time. Why are kids so different today? It seems as though we have regressed. Wow! Times sure have changed but I haven't decided if it's for the better. I'm gonna have to think on that for a while.|`|RKcwfrGOaa	One of my great-grandmothers married at 13, and one of my adoptive great-grandmothers married at 14.  It's just a different world now than it was then.  My father-in-law was working at a foundry when he was 14.  He didn't marry until later, but his father died when he was 8, and he and his brother had to work to support their mother. They had a small pension from the civil war, but it wasn't much.  (Yes, my father-in-law drew a civil war pension on his father.  That family reproduced really, really late in life!)  My own father dropped out of high school to join the military.  He's living very, very comfortably today.  Turns out the high-tech field pays a little better than a high school diploma.  :)    I had my first child at 18, and that son had a child at 19, but he's doing very well for himself, also.  I just got off the phone with him, and he's getting ready for tomorrow night.  He's a little jittery.  He's being escorted by limo to an award ceremony, and if he's lucky, he'll win the award.  In any case, he's a nominee.      Young people are very capable of parenting if they choose to do so.  I don't know why people decided it's so very wrong.  I have difficulty blaming it on religion.  Mary was very young when Jesus was born.  If it's religiously motivated, the Christians have certainly forgotten their heritage.  Poor Jesus wouldn't stand a chance today, would he?  The manger police would be sending him straight to foster care.|`|TTS9cvUmaa	I think you answered your question. In our great grandma's time all that was expected of a woman was marriage and raising a child.    Now my parents expected me to finish college and get a job before i went the marriage and baby route. If i had gotten pregnant before i finished my education it would have been a huge disappointment and also since women don't stay at home anymore they'd be unable to offer support as a family as used to be done during gran'ma days.|`|b26Dp8LKaa	I just wanted to answer the "belief" that teen pregnancies is "epidemic" over the past 10 years.  Actually, teen pregnancy is at the lowest level it's been in 30 years.  Which I think is great news!  More interesting stat's below:    "The teenage pregnancy rate in this country is at its lowest level in 30 years, down 36% since its peak in 1990. A growing body of research suggests that both increased abstinence and changes in contraceptive practice are responsible for recent declines in teenage pregnancy.  ? The teenage pregnancy rate among those who ever had intercourse declined 28% between 1990 & 2002.  ? The teenage birthrate in 2002 was 30% lower than the peak rate of 61.8 births per 1,000 women, reached in 1991.  ? Between 1988 & 2000, teenage pregnancy rates declined in every state & in the District of Columbia.  ? By 2002, the teenage abortion rate had dropped by 50% from its peak in 1988.  ? From 1986 to 2002, the proportion of teenage pregnancies ending in abortion declined more than one-quarter from 46% to 34% of pregnancies among 1519-year-olds.  ? Among black women aged 1519, the nationwide pregnancy rate fell by 40% between 1990 & 2002.  ? Among white teenagers, it declined by 34% during the same time period.  ? Among Hispanic teenagers, who may be of any race, the pregnancy rate increased slightly from 19911992, but by 2002 was 19% lower than the 1990 rate.    http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/2006/09/1...    As far as the 'stigma' of teen pregnancy goes, it may have started after WWII with the huge growth in the middle class.  Before WWII, about 1/3 of the population was middle class. Following WWII, because of the GI Bill, VA loans, etc., the middle class jumped to about 2/3rds of the population. There was huge pressure to conform throughout the late 40's & 50's. The 'new' middle class didn't want the 'shame' of unwed pregnancy to threaten their social position.  Teen pregnancy is nothing new.|`|nESfk0bXaa	I think you can blame Gloria Steinem and her ilk.  There can only be one 'choice' for a woman--what the Feminist Movement thinks.|`|6orvPrLLaa	simple answer: marital status.     teen pregnancy is NOT an issue as long as the mother is married.|`|oW2UQMRCaa	Because most teens are too young to parent. I'm not saying all teen mothers aren't capable of taking care of their children, because some of them are, but its few and far between. It is probably the biggest reason there are so many uneducated people in existence. I'm not saying it's impossible either. My sister had her first child at 17, and two more after that, but she was fortunately mature enough to realize that when you have children, the children then become your number one priority; the reason why they were raised so well.    The reason its become such a stigma is simply because you rarely hear about the teen parents who made it through and produced a productive member of society, as with all negativity it is what you'll hear about most.

J87cQEuzaa	Hi, well I started feeding my baby oatmeal when he was about 6 months old. I buy the steel cut oats (the least processed oatmeal) I cook it according to directions and then blend in the blender. The oatmeal comes out nice and creamy, if you want to make it thinner just add breastmilk as you use it. For instance, I make a big batch, freeze in cubes and then use a cube a day with added breastmilk to make it a bit on the runnier side. Steel cut oats are not as processed and therefore don't lose as much vitamins as regular oatmeal.     My son is now 11 months old and LOVES his oatmeal in the morning. He has never had constipation issues so far, and has never had the rice/oatmeal baby cereal stuff.     By the way adding pureed or mashed fruit to the oatmeal makes it yummier. My son's favorite is apples and blueberries with his oatmeal.|`|IXBl5l5kaa	I would stay away from rice cereal. That is my personal preference, and also not necessary anyway.    http://kellymom.com/nutrition/solids/fir...    "Cereal is not at all necessary, particularly the baby cereals. Regular (whole grain) oatmeal is more nutritious for your baby. Many doctors recommend iron-fortified rice cereal as baby's first food because it is less likely to cause an allergic reaction and because most babies sometime after the 6th month require an additional iron source other than mother's milk. If your baby starts solids around 6 months or later, there is much less chance of allergic reaction to foods. It's debatable whether healthy breastfed babies need the extra iron (you can get baby's iron levels checked if you're worried about this). In addition, infants need lots of protein and cereal has a low protein-calorie ratio (even lower when mixed with water or fruit)."    I would also suggest buying the store baby oatmeal cereal, but you CAN make your own :)  http://www.wholesomebabyfood.com/cereals...|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	You shouldn't start breastfed babies on grains, really.  You should either start with low iron foods to prevent the solids from interfering with the absorption of iron from breastmilk until the baby is consistently taking solids.  Or you should start with foods high in iron, protein, and fat.  (Depending on who you believe)    The reason that formula fed babies "need" rice cereal is the fiber which is completely lacking in all but one brand of formula; and the one brand has two kinds of fiber -breastmilk has dozens.    If you really want to use oatmeal then get real oatmeal, preferably not quick cooking, and toast in cast iron if you are worried about iron.    http://www.babyreference.com/BeyondBreas...  Use close-to-no-iron foods for  experimentation (pear, cucumber, apple,  plum, papaya, melon, banana) to protect  babys immune advantages before solid  foods are a sure thing    And feed high iron foods once solids are a go  ???? These include peas, prunes, apricots, meats,  beans (especially soy), potato skins, spinach,  fortified cereals  ???? Dont push consumption even once solids have  started  ???? Is there even a need for pureed foods?  ???? If only finger foods are available, baby will only  eat these and only when ready  ???? I think pureed foods are OK  great for some  and not needed for others    Why not cereal?    http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9646449/page...  Take rice cereal, for example. Under conventional American wisdom, it's the best first food. But Butte says iron-rich meat  often one of the last foods American parents introduce  would be a better choice.    Dr. David Ludwig of Children's Hospital Boston, a specialist in pediatric nutrition, says some studies suggest rice and other highly processed grain cereals actually could be among the worst foods for infants.    "These foods are in a certain sense no different from adding sugar to formula. They digest very rapidly in the body into sugar, raising blood sugar and insulin levels" and could contribute to later health problems, including obesity, he says.    The lack of variety in the American approach also could be a problem. Exposing infants to more foods may help them adapt to different foods later, which Ludwig says may be key to getting older children to eat healthier.    http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/solids...  Cereal is not at all necessary, particularly the baby cereals. Regular (whole grain) oatmeal is more nutritious for your baby.    http://www.askdrsears.com/faq/ci2.asp  The truth is, there is nothing special about these foods that makes them better to start out with. Babies don't actually even need rice cereal    http://www.llli.org/llleaderweb/LV/LVDec...  Meat provides additional protein, zinc, B-vitamins, and other nutrients which may be in short supply when the decrease in breast milk occurs. A recent study from Sweden suggests that when infants are given substantial amounts of cereal, it may lead to low concentrations of zinc and reduced calcium absorption (Persson 1998). Dr. Nancy Krebs has shared preliminary results from a large infant growth study suggesting that breastfed infants who received pureed or strained meat as a primary weaning food beginning at four to five months, grow at a slightly faster rate. Dr. Krebs' premise is that inadequate protein or zinc from complementary foods may limit the growth of some breastfed infants during the weaning period. Both protein and zinc levels were consistently higher in the diets of the infants who received meat (Krebs 1998). Thus the custom of providing large amounts of cereal products and excluding meat products before seven months of age may not meet the nutritional needs of all breastfed infants.  Meat has also been recommended as an excellent source of iron in infancy. Heme iron (the form of iron found in meat) is better absorbed than iron from plant sources. In addition, the protein in meat helps the baby more easily absorb the iron from other foods. Two recent studies (Makrides 1998; Engelmann 1998) have examined iron status in breastfed infants who received meat earlier in the weaning period. These studies indicate that while there is not a measurable change in breastfed babies' iron stores when they receive an increased amount of meat (or iron), the levels of hemoglobin circulating in the blood stream do increase when babies receive meat as one of their first foods.      http://www.westonaprice.org/children/nou...  Finally, respect the tiny, still-developing digestive system of your infant. Babies have limited enzyme production, which is necessary for the digestion of foods. In fact, it takes up to 28 months, just around the time when molar teeth are fully developed, for the big-gun carbohydrate enzymes (namely amylase) to fully kick into gear. Foods like cereals, grains and breads are very challenging for little ones to digest. Thus, these foods should be some of the last to be introduced. (One carbohydrate enzyme a baby's small intestine does produce is lactase, for the digestion of lactose in milk.1)    [...]    Babies do produce functional enzymes (pepsin and proteolytic enzymes) and digestive juices (hydrochloric acid in the stomach) that work on proteins and fats.12 This makes perfect sense since the milk from a healthy mother has 50-60 percent of its energy as fat, which is critical for grow|`|VudhjHi2aa	I would say the Baby oatmeal or rice cereals. They are make for babies and give them the vitamins they need. I just started giving my so regular oatmeal sometimes but not all the time and he is almost a year old. So I would wait on that for a while and keep giving the Baby oatmeal. :o)|`|sw2R5A9iaa	save your money and feed the babe the same food you feed the rest of the family.  oatmeal & cream of rice or wheat can be fed to everyone.|`|nYI8eB0Baa	I agree with Mystic's answer..she always gives great answers!!|`|yCwPxulYaa	I just started my breastfed only baby on oatmeal and she loves it.  She has also had no problem with using the bathroom.  She is 5 months old and we had to start because of weight gain issues.      I would recommend getting the store bought oatmeal.  It is much easier then trying to make your own.    I tried rice and it made her constipated...I started oatmeal and she is pooping every day.  They say oatmeal is better for breastfed babies.|`|448z7bSPaa	hii well feed my baby the rice cereal its healthy and it makes it easier for them to go to the bathroom|`|dzNnf3LHaa	You should feed your baby baby cereal.  They make it so it is easily digested by baby.  Also you should always start your baby on rice cereal it is less harsh on their stomach, and they are less likely to be allergic.
1IDSGM71aa	Yes, take it as long as you're nursing. It's as good for your baby now that you're nursing as it was while your baby was in utero.|`|0b822c825c81fdba58631516562146c2aa	I took that thru my pregnancy and am breastfeeding as well.  My OB told me to take it as long as I breastfeed.  It may not have a positive aspect on production, but supplies essential nutrition for you and the babies brain development.|`|C3WlLuYoaa	Ask your doctor, it is the best way to get the best information about the supplement and how it affects the nutrients in your breastmilk.|`|c23e2e9ba321447351d3dc720a353187aa	A womans breast milk contains DHA and other fatty acids for brain development regardless of what her diet is.  It is just taken from your body.  SO basically, the supplement might help you but it won't make any significant difference with your nursing baby.  I don't know where expecta sources their dha but it can contain harmful chemicals and mercury.  You should check to make sure.

Don't worry about it.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Heated/cooked. It kills the bacteria called Listeria which can harm you and your unborn child.     Cook it till it sizzles.|`|23033d499769542e5e7910234a60e4f7aa	Microwave until it's steaming...      Quickly cool the meat in an ice bath.. (seal in zip-lock so the meat doesn't get wet)  and eat..    By quickly cooling the meat to the desired eating temp in an ice bath you get the benefits of microwaving and the temp you like without the bacteria having time to regrow after the heating...|`|i8Ch743Laa	I eat it in moderation,but I'm pregant for the second time,and all this crap just came out. I ate it whenever I wanted when I was pregnant with my daughter. Just eat it how you want to eat it,don't worry about all that,haven't you noticed,the more women seem to be giving birth to more unhealthy babies with tons more allergies,that get sick easier? I'm not saying don't listen to everything,just keep that in mind with stuff like deli meat.|`|xHcQSLiVaa	My wife had three healthy children and never warmed her lunch meat.

Check your deli for Lilydale lunch meat, they have a variety and they don't contain the nitrites and nitrates that are harmful in the other stuff. They also have other meats that are safe like sausage.|`|DBKV3g4baa	My doctor told me to microwave any lunchmeat or hot dogs as soon as I get them home from the store, then refrigerate and eat at my convenience (no need to reheat each time or eat it warm).  I was told to heat it for 10 minutes - it seems excessive to me, but he's the expert.|`|HCMrR1O9aa	ok, my son is 11 months old, and i LOVED cold lunch meat when i was pregnant hun, i don't know where you heard you couldn't eat it cold, because like bologna is pre cooked when you buy it, and if your really THAT worried about it, when you go grocery shopping, look in the deli sections for *pre cooked deli meats* that way, you have NOTHING to worry about...lol if it already says it, you cant worry then can you? i hope i was of some kind of help and good luck with the baby....|`|8hwGmfs8aa	just eat it normally.......you will drive your self insane wi all these do's nd don'ts........
Q8ZjmYuYaa	By the fifth month most babies don't need mothers to burp them at all. They can do that on their own, and they're better at controlling their drinking as to not swallow so much air.     If you're worried, try pressing gently on his belly when he's done eating. If it's really bulged and hard, he probably needs to burp. If it's slightly firm, he's probably just got a full belly and is fine.    As for whether he's full or not, the same test will help you. Feel his belly when you know he's hungry and see how firm it is. Also, watch the way his lips and tongue move when he sucks the nipple when he's eating the first 4 oz. If he keeps sucking the same pace and strength, he needs more. If he starts playing with the nipple, letting it hang in his mouth, etc., he might not need much more.    Most babies I know at 5 months (I work in a daycare, 6 weeks to 18 months) can do 5 or 6 oz every three.     I hope this helps! These are tricks we use with our babies, and we have about 10 or 12 everyday. None go hungry and most parents really do ask us for advice on how much to feed, etc.|`|IXBl5l5kaa	Around 4 1/2-5 months my daughter basically burped herself. I still find myself patting her back (almost 7 months now), but for the most part she is good to go. She has reflux so I'd rather burp her and be safe to help minimize the spit up everywhere lol    She nurses and I really have not noticed an increase of nursing. My husband offers bottles of milk while I am at work and she fluctuates what she eats. Sometimes she takes 3 bottles (4oz each) and sometimes she takes 4 bottles. Just depends really on her mood and how much she ate during the day with me.      **right now she gets one solid per day but we will be adding another soon. They don't replace feedings, though.|`|h59Bc4wfaa	I stopped burping my little man when he shown me that he could burp on his own. It was around 5 months if I remember correctly.    As for the other question, If he can handle more, then give him more. It's important to always start off slow when giving more formula. You have to give their little belly time to stretch. If you're already giving him 4, but going back and making 2 more, I would make him a 6 oz bottle and see what he eats out of it. If he leaves any left, then you'll know how much to make next time. (Like if you make him 6 oz, and he leaves an oz, then you'll know to only make 5 next time)    Good Luck~|`|NQ2sDQMRaa	I stopped burping my son at 2-3 months because he would throw up all his food then want to eat again, I would just sit him up straight and he would burp on his own, or if i bounced him a little that would work too. my son was eating 5-6oz every 4-5hrs at that age. You shouild probably be introducing cereal to your baby soon and shortly after that step 1 foods, as long as hes not hungry then hes eating enough|`|a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	I stopped burping my son around 5/6 months. He just kind of burped himself and didnt need my help. And if your baby is still hungry after 4 oz then go ahead and feed them more. You cant really over feed a baby. They will take what they want.|`|1f440895db82d46ea39724bf6ad660e1aa	Regarding the feedings you can give him more milk. Our son drank up to 6 ounces per feeding at that age. We bought bottles that held up to 6 ounces and just let him eat until he was full which was usually between 4 and 6 ounces per feeding.    As far as burping, our son was about 6 months and was starting to sit up on his own when we stopped burping him. You will notice your son burping more and more on his own. It will surprise you when it happens. It's kind of cute because you won't expect it. That's when you know he's capable of doing it on his own. I remember my son pulling away at your son's age when I tried burping him. It feels like you are using all your strength to keep him in your arms to get the darn burp out. Good luck to you! Soon, you won't have to burp him anymore.|`|50f096720b3c00da77b72dd72a204672aa	Try feeding him more formula and at greater intervals. Our Dr had us stretch my sons feeding schedule out a 1/2 hr at a time, but i eventually got him to 8-10 oz every 5-6 hours. I would make a big bottle and just give him a chance to drink it, let him decide how much to drink. 4 oz every 3/4 hours is the same as 8 oz every 6 hours anyway. It made life alot easier and got him used to a breakfast/lunch/dinner/bedtime bottle ritual. Check with your Dr of course. As far as the burping goes, if he is burping on his own thats all you need. As long as he isnt spitting up or getting really bad gas he is getting it out himself. :)|`|EAFtAO57aa	Yeah sure,one more ounce is perfectly fine.
2pxiK9waaa	Um, none. She shouldn't have milk at all yet. And, if you're worried about her not drinking formula, as long as she's eating veggies, fruits, etc, and has wet diapers regularly, there is nothing to worry about. When you do switch to milk after a year of age, she should have no chocolate added to it. She may never like milk. I never did. 70 percent of people are lactose intolerant. Giving her chocolate brings in unhealthy eating habits and will increase the likelihood that she will develop childhood diabetes and become obese. Not worth it so she drinks milk. She can get those same vitamins from cheeses, yogurts, and fruits and veggies.|`|9J1Sl6X6aa	So are you giving her cows milk or is this formula she doesn't like? I don't think chocolate milk is a good idea for a 10 month old. 10 month is a bit early for cows milk too but I have heard of 10 months olds having it without any problems though. Most kids love their milk. Perhaps you could try to warm it up instead of giving it to her straight from the fridge or try changing milk brands. They do vary in taste.|`|3hIr3Dllaa	several years old|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Well, most doctors recommend not giving children cow's milk until one year of age now.      Personally, I don't think it's the best idea to get her to drink milk by putting a sugary flavor enhancer in it.  I suspect that a kid will never want to drink milk any other way.  And since they drink a lot of milk, that's a lot of sugar.|`|AA10943329	Are you kidding? She is a baby, she shouldn't even be on cows milk for another 2 months. And never with sugary stuff added to it.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	no need to enhance the milk -it has natural sugars.  avoid cow's milk & opt for soy or almond varieties.

MDWaPmXsaa	I'm not a parent, but this is what I expect that I would do.  I would not act like everthing is fine and dandy.  I would do my best to explain to my child why I had not been there for them, then I would leave it up to the child whether to accept me or not.    I really do hope that you have some good talks with your dad, and I hope you can work things out.|`|odQewFgvaa	It had to be so hard for him.  He didn't just dump you somewhere. He left with family who loved you.  He had a lot to deal with. That is a very painful experience, he lost the person he was going to spend the rest of his life with.  I would be beyond devastated if I lost my husband. He just wasn't in the right frame of mind to raise a child properly.     I am not saying that what he did was great. He is trying now to get to know you. Maybe he doesn't get to play the father role but he can be a friend. Give it some time, get to know him, maybe you will understand why he did what he did. If you want some answers from him start asking them.|`|prqrQcd1aa	Wow, i'm sorry about all of this.    Your mother died during child birth i'm taking it, that does not mean that you killed her. Sometimes these things happen. It sounds like he couldn't deal with it and chose to go to the army to try to make a better life for you.... but still couldn't deal with it.    You need to talk to your father about how you feel. Honestly it's the best thing you can do. I understand how you feel, i do. You just need to know that sometimes people grow up and want to be part of your life, how you choose to respond to him now wanting to do this is up to you, but your best bet is to tell him exactly how you feel and then get some counseling about everything you have went through so far in your life. Best of wishes to you!|`|shBj5RElaa	okay tasha several things.    im assuming your mother died during child birth ? He lost a woman he loved and ranway and left you in the care of people who loved you and he knew you would be loved there.    Maybe you looked like your mother to much and it pained him or he couldnt deal with it.    I would ask him to see a counselor with you. YOU dont know what he went thru, so unless you walk in his shoes dont shut him out, hear him out but do it with a counselor    good luck|`|bf2b826fb186efa4963970654d24ac34aa	The guilt monster rears it's head. I agree that it was wrong for him to blame you for your mother's death and he should have gotten some professional counseling to help him deal with that. But in the grand tradition of males, he clammed up and passed the buck. At least he gave you to your grandparents to raise and not total strangers. To me that says he had intentions of being in your life at some point when he thought he could handle it. He now realizes what he did was wrong and you are not to blame; he either grew up and got a clue or finally got that professional help he definitely needed. He is trying to make up for what he did. What you need to do is tell him how all of this has made you feel and both of you should attend family counseling so you can work this out. It's sounds to me like he was young and immature when all this first happened. Give counseling a chance so that if things don't work out, you can at least say that you tried. You need help moving beyond all of this too. You have feelings of anger that you need help sorting out.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	One thing you might not know, once you're in the Army, you have very little choice about where you can live until your enlistment term is fullfilled.  Sounds to me like your dad was deployed for a long time but he was caring for you the best way he could.  I think you need to cut him some slack.  Parents are people too.|`|fdP9UJOsaa	awwwwwwwwwwwwww  man that really sucks :-(.  I'm so sorry for to hear about the relationship between you and your father.    but what you should really know is that your father is trying to give you the best. It might not seem that way for you mainly because you feel he is ignoring you... but why else would he let you live with your grandparents. He knows that he is not capable taking care of you or give you everything you want so the best thing to do is leave you with someone else. Parent's have different ways of showing their feelings... some are too caring and others (similar to your dad) might not show any feelings at all. Try sitting him down and explain your feelings. Tell him everything that you dislike about him and explain your thoughts. Who knows, this can bring a long lost relationship into a happy one.|`|1khVEE6oaa	Firstly, I feel for you.  That's a rough thing to have to go through.  However, it sounds like your dad is trying to make up for not being there all those years.  I'm sure it's hard, but you should give him a chance.  Talk to him, and tell him how what he did hurt you.  Hopefully he will apologize and the two of you can try to move on from there and maybe mend your broken relationship.
HCMrR1O9aa	ok if your worried its a uti, i had one when i was pregnant and they made me drink cranberry juice and lots of other juices, so just drink lots of water and juices till you go and NO sodas and tell your mid-wife and she'll get the doc. to run the appropriate tests and get you on the right meds, also, your body might not be used to that extra weight down there (even if it IS just a little) and THAT might be whats making you urinate so frequently....but just to be safe stick with the juice and tell your doc about it on your appointment...i hoped i helped you some GOOD luck with the baby!!!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	If there is no pain when you pee it may not be a uti. It's actually more likely to be how your uterus is positioning itself over your bladder. Your doctor's office should have an answering service over the weekend though if you are concerned you can always call and ask.|`|53QQ9KXEaa	It's hard to get seen on the weekend, so I think it'll be safe to wait until tuesday... Just drink a lot of water and some cranberry juice (not too much, because sugar can aggitate a UTI... Anyway, you get what I'm saying, MODERATION!)     I just went to the doctor today because I thought I might have one because I have been urinating really frequently, but wasn't sure. I'm glad I went, because it turns out that's what it is.     The ob/gyn told me that it's really important to treat urinary tract infections, because if they develop into kidney infections it could trigger labor.     I waited a little while to go, so don't worry too much.     Good luck|`|x4uGfC4oaa	E coli are the bacteria present in a UTI. It can spread to your bladder, then to the kidneys. Kidney infections are very painful, and harmful to you, but not necessarily the baby. Go to the doctor as soon as you can.|`|GPW6HUZFaa	I don't think until Tuesday would be too long to wait.  Until then though, you could drink cranberry juice or get cranberry pills.  Cranberry helps with UTIs

QBOtYUGyaa	??????, I don't agree with you at all.     To answer the question, it's tough. I think being your position is probably about the hardest life can get, and I say that out of experience. It's so important to be social, but at the same time you need to worry about where you're going to go in life and what you want out of it.     So to give you advice, I'd say you need to take what you want. At this point in your life, you very well may know better than your mother, and while she probably knows a lot more than you in some areas, it's entirely possible that she's clueless on how to raise a teenage daughter.    Keep your grades up and keep your future bright; you'll be thankful you did later in life, and it seems like you've really got it together there. Basically, what you need to do is take a little, and show your mom that you CAN be social while keeping up with her standards; that you CAN see your boyfriend and have a job.     The most important thing in your life is to be happy with yourself and the life you're living. Maybe telling your mom that you're not happy where you are would get her to realize something needs to change. Anyway, keep working on her. Really try to work WITH her, because that'll get you the best results. When she trusts you, you'll be amazed at how nice parents can be, and while it isn't that you're doing anything wrong now, you do need to show her and shove it down her throat that you're doing everything that's expected of you.    I hope that helps. You're at a tough age right now; just try to keep your priorities in order, and never lose sight of what you think is most important to you.|`|MIUzgwsTaa	I hate to say this    But to get what you want you got to do what you want to do    Be rebellious    and the day she asked where did she go wrong raising you    tell her it's her fault for not giving you your space and freedom to grow up    that'll get her (im not talkin about payback either so dont think im evil lol)    Example:    If she says your not aloud to be with your boyfriend anymore or something like that    you tell her: "mom im not a baby anymore im growing up, and i cant wait to the day you accept this.

I don't know if you've had 1 before or not so i'd recommend talking to your mum or another female adult you trust about it just to get your bearings on the whole woman scenario.    If your really worried about go to see your doctor but you can scratch pregnancy off the list.|`|04dc0d2596b5e8336fe567281e72fb2faa	If you have never had sex at all, you are not pregnant. But remember, if you handled a guy and then yourself, or he touched himself then you, you were exposed to sperm and it is possible, but highly unlikely. What you probably have been feeling is either one of those really bad periods coming on or gas. Sound silly, but gas in your bowels can do that. A bad case of diarrhea on the way can feel that way too....sometimes you feel that bubbly belly thing hours before you poo. I am guessing a menstrual thing. If it hasn't resolved itself by morning, tell Mom. (Don't freak, just tell her your belly feels weird.) By resolved, I mean either stopped, diarrhea or your period.

Yea, it's nothing.|`|AA12069251	yes u should go see your gynecologist he will do a through check up and 4 heavens sake u are not pregnant|`|1sjEUoyjaa	No, you can't be pregnant if you have never had sex. You wouldn't feel any movement early on anyway. Digestive upset probably.
NCa8bOjSaa	If you've never had sex, you're not pregnant.    Maybe gas? :-D|`|RLbN2Ujhaa	You don't normally feel the baby until you are about 5 months pregnant, and not ever having sex kind of makes this unlikely unless somehow sperm got into your body and you didn't know it. You are probably having gas pains or intestinal spasms.|`|D4JP3IlWaa	if you didnt have sex your not pregnant. a baby dont randomly appear in your belly. lol
5aufFeiUaa	Most plus size women don't usually show until a little later in pregnancy.  I was around 25 weeks when I started to show & I'm plus sized.  So, give it a couple more weeks ;)|`|Mi0f4Hufaa	im 5 foot and weigh more than you and it was around 20-25 weeks for me to show, really couldn't hide it from the world anymore. now i look like a watermelon smuggler!!!
vqD08Pjgaa	with time you'll get over it. its totally normal. the same thing happened to me with this really cute doctor i went to once. i even fantasized where we would have our honeymoon even though I don't want to get married until I'm like 30.its just a crush and you'll get over it,don't sweat it.|`|Osn1xpu6aa	chill...it was a dream you can't control dreams.   And it's just a crush.  you'll get over it soon.|`|e56f34b226a134831834a176960b7128aa	You can't really control this.. But i say, kinnda ignore it, but do not try to make anything happen;|`|76ac485c49c2e00f916d7d67422bfe41aa	you just said it's just a stupid crush.
n3PE2lvDaa	we use blankets. But she kicks them off so we prefer those sleeping bag suits they wear.   Just make sure you use breathable blankets for your baby. I have a loosley knitted woolen blanket which I put on my daughter. It will not suffocate her if it goes over her face because of the gaps in the knitting. Just test the blankets yourself by putting them over your own face and see how easily you can breath threw them and then stick with the ones that are breathable. Wool is good because it is still warm but more breathable then material like polafleece.   Also you could make babies bed short. Tuck the blankets firmly in at the bottom and make the bed up so that babies feet touch the base of the cot. That way baby will not be able to slip under the blankets.  Good luck|`|1f440895db82d46ea39724bf6ad660e1aa	No blankets for us. Our son is 9 months and we use a onesie, a pair of socks and thick zip up sleeper with footsies. I think I'd hold off on the blanket and just layer the clothing a bit, but make sure you don't layer too much to overheat the baby.|`|zQAWuMN4aa	No. There's been a few close calls and I won't do it until she starts moving around or rolling over a lot. She is 10 months old but not mobile. We had a fleece sleep sack and used that with a long-sleeved onesie. When she grew out of that, we had a thinner sleep sack so we put her in that plus a pair of sweatpants and a long sleeved onesie.    OR we put her in a short sleeved onsie & a cozy zip up sleeper.|`|R62kIKIxaa	I do both my son is 11 weeks old and since its been so cold I dress him in a thick sleeper and cover him with a light blanket just from the waist down and tuck it under him.|`|RX9rGdXAaa	my aunt always puts two pairs of socks on him and alsoslippers, then has a special night shirt hat attactahes to the pants and covers him, hes very warm and theres no need for a blanket!|`|EAFtAO57aa	I went out and bought a good quality down pillow.  Then I tore out the pillow case removed all the down filling inside and stuffed it into a case I made-a baby blanket size.  So I had a relatively cheap down blanket for my baby.  It is light weight and the best material for warmth and comfort.  Just make sure your baby is okay with down,rarely you will hear about allergies to down but just confirm it.|`|AA10506154	My baby kicks blankets off, and sometimes just putting one on him wakes him up. I have him in a onesie and a footed sleeper. When it gets really cold I have him in a onesie with socks on and a thick sleeper.  When I was a baby, my mom wrapped me tight in a blanket, to the point where I couldn't kick it off. My sister discovered me in the morning. She said my face was purple and I was hardly breathing. They don't remember my temperature, but it was high. My mom rushed me to the ER, and the doctors had to cool me off with ice water. My mom got yelled at. I could have died. Please don't over bundle your baby. However you cover your baby, they should not be sweating!|`|8uauS9aAaa	I did. I just tucked it as tight as I reasonably could.|`|ZXhpEuGpaa	I put a thick sleeper on her and i do use a blanket but it a  hand-made  knitted blanket because it has lots of small holes in it that way if she does get it on her face she can still breath,but i am a very light sleeper regardless.She has tons of blankets but i only use that certain one for now and its from her waist down till she gets to moving around.|`|4t2Cb07raa	I've heard horror stories about babies getting blankets wrapped around their necks. The story about being wrapped too tight and getting rushed to the ER sounds like my mom's friend. She did the same thing. Her baby was sick, so she zipped her into a blanket. The baby got too hot, and they took her to the hospital.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	yes and always have bit it never goes above his armpits it always sits a lil bit below his pits and i put him in a onsie and footie pajammas  and the blanket|`|NQ2sDQMRaa	I used a blanket, just one thick one, no pillows no extra ones to reduce the risk of SIDS, he would kick it off a lot though, so we still put on thick sleepers too, im sure either would be fine|`|vpL67nETaa	I use a swaddle-me.    they rock|`|3MelQFxOaa	Oh there are these sleeping sacks at babies r us, for $20 each, and they are the greatest ever. Because it is so cold, and I being a worry wart mom, this is really nice, because it covers their whole body, with their arms and legs being able to move around. There are different sizes, I suggest it. My mom wishes she has them for us when we were a child. And honestly, since i have been using them, my baby has been sleeping better. She must have been a little cold. :-(
xPgKWIigaa	If it wasnt so damn hot here in SA i'd be ignoring them too - and - if i had a pool - but its to hot to even let the kids go under the sprinklers here - with not much shade for cover, so we stay inside and try to make the best out of the air con.  Its silly that the government go on like that, especially after the string of old people dying - because they've been with out power - some up to over 24hours. If you've got no power whatsoever - why cant you use water to get cool???? Those fat cat pollies dont think, cos they got the cushy life, and i bet they've never had their power go out at the worst time possible|`|wFVLP5l3aa	hello weir in melb and copping the worst of it over 44 most days this week and weve been following the water restrictions iv just been using a cool facewasher on my 1 month old and giving him cool baths  weve also ben spending heaps of time in our car driving around with the aircon cause we dont have aircon at our hose only those portable things lol|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	You can use smaller amounts of water in small tubs or spray bottles than would be used in a sprinkler.    Its about balance|`|n3PE2lvDaa	oh wow. I saw on the news last night about how hot it is for you guys over there. People fainting and stuff. Its pretty dam hot here in New Zealand at the moment but I know that is nothing compared to what it must be like over there!! I think what I would do in that situation is full up a paddling pool or the bath tub for the kides and let them splash in there. It will use less water then a sprinkler and if you use a paddling pool they can play in it tomorrow as well. That way you can still be a bit water consious but cool off the kides.|`|rAkWoweOaa	I am not in Australia, however I live in Texas and in the summertime it often reaches over 105 degrees Farenheit. (I don't know what that is in Celsius, lol) We have water restrictions every year, and while it sucks, if we didn't have it, I am scared we would not have any water at all. Last summer we bought one of those huge blow up water parks, and all you have to do is fill it up once and it recycles the water in it, it has sprinklers and slides and everything. They are neat and our city approved it, since it recycled the water instead of using it endlessly. Good luck!|`|9J1Sl6X6aa	I've only got a 5 month old baby so we haven't been using any more water than usually. We haven't left the house for 4 days now. Got the cooler (split system) on day and night though. Feel bad about using it so much as I feel like I'm using so much energy but I know the cooler we have uses much less energy than the old air conditioning our neighbors have. I just feel lucky they haven't cut off our electricity here like in some other places in Victoria.    What about using water pistols in the heat instead of sprinklers. I don't really see anything wrong with using a sprinkler for the kids to play in though as it's not like you will have it running all day and night but someone might dob you in if they see you using it.    I'm so over this heat though. Hope Sunday will be cooler and that we can at least go for a walk or something. Feel like a prisoner in my own home at the moment but I feel very lucky to have a cooler. There are so many houses without coolers in Victoria. I think I would just die if I didn't have one, esp with a little baby.

WIth this pregnancy it's still the same kind of thing, but I really don't want to just because I feel like crap most of the time.

LDYAGJCxaa	If guys are passing you by because they know you won't sleep with them, then they weren't worth the bother in the first place.  You don't want a guy who only wants you for sex.

You have made a well-thought-out and reasonable decision about how you want to conduct yourself.     Think of it this way:  If a guy is avoiding you beause he knows he's not going to "get any", then he's probably not the kind of guy you'd be interested in having a relationship with, anyway.  He has his priorities, and they are not in synch with yours. So it's an easy way to eliminate guys whose views don't coincide with yours. Is this really the kind of attention you want from guys -- the kind that you have to beat off with a stick when they take you out for one lousy movie, buy you popcorn and think that sex is a payback?     You won't have to have a panic attack every time your period is a day late, you won't have to submit to the humiliation of going to a doctor to get penicillin for gonnorhea, and you won't have to wonder if a guy likes you only because he's getting sexual satisfied.    Just make sure that guys don't see you as the ultimate challenge, the girl that scores them the most points for nailing.|`|8ff3196b10cd4c3afc116407535b3666aa	Trust me you don't want the kind of attention your other friends are getting.

QBOtYUGyaa	That was pretty terrible of you. I don't think being sick justifies that kind of behavior.    Granted, maybe she should have been more understanding that you needed a place to store your stuff for a bit, but did you ever think talking to her might have worked a little better?    You had better learn to control your temper and think before you speak before you ruin your relationship and lose touch with your daughter. You should calmly apologize ASAP and have a talk with her; one where YOU'RE listening at least half the time. And whatever you do, make that conversation one that ends calmly.    I hope you will consider my words. I grew up with a father that always had a short temper, and the moment I started respecting him and was the moment he started really listening to me.|`|9AXKzzAjaa	Honestly, you shouldn't intertionally want to compare her to someone who is "immature" as well as being family. That is teaching her the wrong values. She is your daughter, not friend, so don't fight back. Tell her you will do it as soon as you can. You should have made her move it back herself, but I think you should apologize for yelling just because you didnt' feel well. She will understand. Its not a phase she is probally just fustrated being somewhere she isn't comfortable yet, and finds "her room" the only place she now knows. I hope i helped.|`|0ypw5nKOaa	I think you owe her an apology. While she shouldn't have moved the furniture back without asking, you lost your temper. And that's not ok either. You two need to work out a different space where you can store the things where everyone will be happy so you can stop fighting over something as silly as this. No one likes fighting.|`|z3Oed98laa	I think ur being over dramatic and really thats mean to compare her to her aunt in any circumstances. Its offensive either to her aunt of to her. I think you should apologise for being so harsh, but also set limits. Im not saying that wasnt selfish of her, but it sounds like she was really upset.|`|jNgh3e3Faa	Apologize. You need not compare a teen to anyone. They are insecure already.   She should have moved it back herself though. Or offered a better place for it to go.  A stage?  She wants her room to be her own. Understandable from anyone.   Can you not compromise?  She can help you clean up a place to put the extra stuff.   And you both are happy.   Apologize. You need a good relationship. Explain you are sick and a bit of a wreck moving and all.   Speaking of....have you talked about sex yet?  I only ask because I got pregnant very young and my mother was not talkative about sex. At all.|`|XJzyTTbtaa	You we're being a b*tch she FINALLY has her own room and you deicde to put all YOUR cr*p there! if you need to put it some place put it in YOUR room god damn!|`|AA10079820	I think that was a little snappish of you, it hurt her feelings, but you were sick and probably felt like crap without her being a brat.    She's probably just excited she has her own room and is ready for it.  She's just being fifteen and impatient. Welcome to the teenage years.|`|CzdxFiRLaa	Hi Mom,    15 yo teen daughters, love them and they hate you, it is just a 'phase'.  Her life is in turmoil, a change of homes, making new friends, may be a new school.  All daunting and frightening challenges for a teenage girl (or boy).  And lets not forget the hormones.      For the first time she has her own space, her private domain and Mom, you invaded it.  In your daughter's mind, this was her room, no one else's and you shattered that dream by 'dumping' your stuff in her space.      At the moment you have a stand off, she hates you and you are frustrated at her lack of co-operation, plus you are sick.      Try for the win/win on this and re-build the bridge with your daughter.      Explain that you are feeling unwell, you are sorry that you upset her and that you can understand that she wants her privacy.  Now challenge her to come up with the solution that makes you both happy.  Giver her some responsibility in finding a good storage space for the files and discuss with her where the additional furniture would be best placed.  You may need to explain that just dumping it in another room is not going to work.    You may be surprised on her solution.    Good luck with the following teen years.

Just make sure to take it around the same time every morning and use the same body site every time (in other words, once you start taking it under the tongue make sure you always take it under the tongue). Different body parts will have different temperatures. Check out www.fertilityfriend.com . Its a great website on BBT.    Best of luck to you and lots of baby dust!!!

WyXpC5A0aa	I had contactions for about 16 hours before i went into the hospital.  my contractions were four minutes apart. Baby arrived 7 hours later.|`|2fa52a8e6b6c75385da254c267fc7595aa	5 minutes. And believe me, you KNOW when its your time, at 37 weeks your body is probably preparing for the big race. and possibly doing a little headstart. I wouldnt be surprised if your contracting every 10 minutes it happens soon, oor your next visit they say you are dialted to 4 cm. ;o)   btw..... I have 4 kids, all natural. I know these things.   As for your first dont compare it. Mine were all very different experiences. its funny your body acts different. but the great  part? you are not so scared of the pain, you sort of know what to expect.  congratulations.|`|P8VoBR0saa	with my 3rd i was having contractions about 10-15 mins apart and i went to the hospital *first time having a baby in the states others were in germany* and she checked my cervix and everything and i don't know what she did but when i left the hospital because they weren't close enough yet they were 2-3 mins apart and we called and she said if they continue to be 2-3 mins apart for 2 hours come back      hope it helps|`|23033d499769542e5e7910234a60e4f7aa	With my first pregnancy I waited around the house for 3 hours waiting for the contraction to get 5 minutes or so apart..  Then I felt the urge to push (The contractions never got 5 minutes apart...  I actually told my mother "Mom I can't need to push the contractions aren't 5 minutes apart"  She laughed and said "I don't care we are going in." )  so we rushed to the hospital and made it to the E.R. waiting room where she was delivered on the floor....    With my subsequent pregnancies I went to the hospital as soon as the contraction became..  My shortest labor was my last 47 minutes from first twinge to delivery...  My husband drove to the hospital like Mario Andretti saying "Don't push, I don't wanna deliver it." under his breath the whole trip....  We made it to the delivery room with 9 minutes to spare LOL|`|PW3hcVZiaa	At 37.5 weeks, I had sex first thing in the morning, starting having contractions about 4-5 mins. apart at 10am, they were 3-4 mins apart by noon (after a walk around the block and resting they kept being very regular) and I headed to the hospital about 2pm, with contractions 3 mins apart.  They weren't very painful, so I figured they would send me home, but I was 3 cm when I got there.  I was 9.5 cm by 10pm (12 hours after they started) but I stalled with a lip of cervix left and had to get pitocin.  I started pushing at 2am and she was born at 4:30am.  Good luck!

A little while they put in the local anasthetic (it stings) but then its all numb    3. Nope! U only get cut if there is not enough room for the baby, and only tear if you dont listen to your midwife and push to qucikly or also if there is not enough room again. You wont notice that either|`|wiAVa1H5aa	1)  Probably everyone does, but most don't notice that it happened.  2)  It does if your epidural is wearing off, they didn't use a local anesthetic, or the doctor isn't too subtle - for the most part you won't notice.  3) Not everyone tears and more and more you aren't given an episiostomy.|`|pjgMW6qaaa	If you poop you probably won't even know you did...    And I felt when they were doing my stitches..I had no pain meds and it was not completely numbed when they injected the area to numb it.    Recovery was easy. A bit uncomfortable but not painful for me..  And yes most women tear or get episiotomies.|`|KUxEBQuYaa	no neither one happens to everyone.    i didn't poo i was scared i was going to but if you do they dont make a big deal out of it. they just clear it off and keep going. its not an issue.  i did get cut but i also ripped and no i couldn't feel either.     i dont think you can prevent it.... you can ask though.|`|2fa52a8e6b6c75385da254c267fc7595aa	I have had 4 children. I did not poo. I did pee all 4 times, lol.   it can be prevented, just be sure those last weeks you eat healthy so you can use the bathroom in a regular manner.     if you have an episiotomy it does hurt, the stitching does not hurt. healing takes some time. It burns when you pee the first few days. But you will be given tucks to soothe the burn, and a spray bottle to clean youeself and the area after using the bathroom.    I just want to say I have been cut everytime.    no not eveyone tears or has to have an incision. doctors try their personal best to help the vagina stretch around the babys head, cutting is last resort. they dont like you to tear either, so you definately want the cut over the tear, it heals much better
q1YDp1y3aa	I would recommend NOT circumcising your son. Cost depends on the doctor- its runs between $100-$600 depending on where you live and the individual doctor. The benefits do not outweigh the risks. One analysis found that for every 9 boys who might be spared a UTI by circumcision, another 12 boys at the least (the upper estimate was 40 boys) will experience severe complications from the circumcision. Thats great if your boy is one of the 9, but horrible if he's one of the 12. UTIs can be treated by antibiotics quite effectively. Botched circumcisions are much more difficult to fix. Its also worth noting that 99% of intact boys will never get an infection, compared to 99.9% of cut boys. That means you would have to cut 100 boys to save just one of them from infection. Thats 99 boys cut for no reason at all. Out of every 1000 boys who are cut, one will contract a UTI anyway.    Only 50% of boys nationwide are circumcised. Girls of your son's generation will likely have an entirely different view of circumcision as girls from yours. Just because you think intact is "gross" and "unsanitary" does not mean the women of your son's generation will. after all, think of all the differences between you and your parents. Did you know that when your grandparents were young, circumcision was very uncommon?    Next, it is VERY painful to an infant. Most doctors still don't use any anesthesia, those that do rarely offer adequate anesthesia because the only stuff that works is not safe enough to use in infants for such a "minor" procedure. Further, some of the pain meds offered to infants aren't even recommended for use on babies! Some doctors argue that it has been done "for thousands of years" without anesthetic- what they neglect to tell you is that a medical circumcision can take over 15 minutes to complete. A Jewish ritual circumcision, by contrast, takes under 60 seconds to complete (and the baby is given wine) Here is some info on the pain.....  http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/  http://www.circumcision.org/response.htm  http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/taddio2... (note in this one that even infants offered pain meds for the procedure showed signs of post traumatic stress!)    You should also know that studies have shown that the most sensitive parts of the male anatomy of ON the foreskin- NOT the head of the penis. By cutting off the foreskin, you remove a mans most erogenous genital tissue. Here is a study about that.... (note that other studies found no difference, but they neglected to test the sensitivity of the foreskin- they only tested the glans penis of intact and cut men and didn't pay any attention to the foreskin at all) http://www.nocirc.org/touch-test/touchte...    You should know that infant boys are EASIER to care for when they are intact. The foreskin does not retract until late childhood or even puberty, so you do nothing special, just wipe the outside of his penis clean and leave it alone. Furthermore, to prevent painful and bleeding erections later in life, doctors are now commonly leaving more skin behind- in a cut boy this means you may have to push the left over skin back at every diaper change and clean beneath it to prevent it from adhering or infecting. The very thing that mother's think they avoid by circumcising! In short- Intact = wipe like a finger, NEVER retract Cut= vaseline, clean thoroughly, push back remaining skin to prevent adhesions etc (the last step perhaps for several months or years)    Here is an excellent tutorial on the basics of intact care and circumcision....  http://www.lactivistintactivist.com/?pag...    Another factor in your decision is that circumcised boys experience a 12% increase in their risk of MRSA infection. MRSA is commonly picked up in hospitals (where circumcision is performed in non-sterile conditions) and has been known to kill adults. I wouldn't want to deal with it in an infant. 12% is a BIG risk, the risk of a boy "needing" a circ later in life is WELL below that- under 1%. http://www.nocirc.org/publish/12-Answers...    The so called "benefits" of circumcision are generally trumped up. A big one now is that it "prevents" AIDS. All the studies showing "benefits" like this have been poorly designed and inconclusive. Also, for every study that finds a "benefit" there are more studies that find no benefit. http://www.icgi.org/    It is rather eye-opening to see how circumcision first became popular in the US to begin with. It was virtually unknown in this country until the 20th century. This slide show takes you through the rise of circumcision.... http://youtube.com/watch?v=f4unKTMpBGA    Finally, you should watch a video or two of the procedure so you are fully informed of what your infant will go through. I will warn you that these are graphic. If you can't handle watching them as an adult, why would you expect your infant son to endure them?  Gomco Clamp- http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=...

I have aunts who have had their tonsils removed, but I never have. It would have been silly to remove my tonsils at birth.    The vast majority of intact men never have a problem "needing" circumcision. It's most likely that your brother was the victim of a doctor making a mis-diagnosis. A lot o them are used to circumcised boys and consequently they don't understand how the foreskin works, and recommend circumcision for incorrect reasons.    After research I have decided that circumcision is cruel and not medically necessary. It's a horrible thing to do to a baby, for no good reason. I wouldn't do it if I had a son and I encourage you not to do it either. Most foreskin problems are caused by improper management of the foreksin (e.g pulling it back before it's ready), and can be treated by less invasive means (e.g. antibiotics).    Harriet|`|4arnbpUCaa	If a boy is not circumcised, its rare that it has to be done at a later age.  Its entirely possible that your mom did not know how to take proper care of your little brother's penis when he was a baby, resulting in the problem he had.    The bottom line is that as long as you read up on how to care for a baby boy that isn't circumcised, and that you teach him when he's older (like 8 or 10 years old) that he needs to wash properly there, he will NOT have any problems.    Moms also tend to presume that its more difficult to keep clean if he's not circumcised. The opposite is true. If you don't circumcise then you don't need to do anything, but if you do, you need to take extra care of the wound.    I think your gut instinct is telling you not to do it. Don't be afraid to tell your mom that you've researched it and that the problems your brother had are rare. You could also tell her that the procedure isn't recommended anymore. The American Academy of Pediatrics says there are insufficient benefits and that "it is not essential".    My personal recommendation, spend the money on clothes and toys, not on a surgery that's painful and unnecessary.|`|CNW6eAjoaa	I am with the group that opposes circumcision.  It is a destructive procedure that is never called for.  Statistics indicate that 99.5% of all circumcisions are not necessary.  There are always options.  As Nurse Autumn said, the problem with your sibling might be because the foreskin was forced to retract before its time.  If you have no problem, do not it.  Read up on the reason and function of the foreskin and you will see it as a gift, not something to be chopped off without reason.  You are the one who will have to live with the damage it causes.  You foreskin represents 75-80% of your sexual receptors.  The rest in shared between your coronal ridge of your glans and frenulum.  All that will be left after a north american style circumcision is the coronal ridge.  In short, you will loose almost everything.  As you age, your glans will lose additional sensitivity as it rubs on your clothes and becomes covered with scar tissue.  I know one contributor suggested (as have I in the past) that the mother should crawl up on the procedure table and submit to Female Circumcision (Female Genital Mutilation) and see how much enjoyment she experiences from that.  Circumcision is just that,...Male Genital Mutilation thinly disguised behind a more socially acceptable medical term.  It is against all international laws for the rights of the child to perform FGM, but it is perfectly acceptable to cut a male to pieces for no medical reason.  The idea that circumcision is helpful and better is proven myth.  The natural, intact condition you were born with is much better.  Do not submit yourself to this procedure only to please someone else.  Read, read, and read some more and you will see what a benefit it is to keep your foreskin.|`|dzNnf3LHaa	I had my son circumsised when he was a baby.  It took about ten days to heal.  I use to work in a nursing home, and let me tell you, there is nothing worse then having to see a grown man get an infection there from ppl not cleaning it properly.  Then having to get a circumsision.  How awful, get it when they are babies and wont remember.  Save them from possible pain of infections.|`|l10h4yqeaa	Honestly i thought most insurances did cover it. I am for circumcision because it does not pose as many risks.

I hope this helps you.|`|aMlWMkO5aa	I had my son circumcised as a newborn. I suggest getting it done. It's better hygiene.

If you are going to get it done I guess it is better to do it when he is young.  My husband is circumcised but had no problem with me not having our boys done.  In Australia it is not that common anymore.  If you are going to do it, do it because you believe it is best for your bub, not because someone else thinks you should do it.  I am not at all religious, so I don't understand why people do it for religious reasons either.  Do what you feel is best.  And good luck.|`|VudhjHi2aa	I had it done for my son who is 11m it did not hurt him one bit and all we had to do was put a lil cream on it when we changed his diaper.

Also my nephew had lots of problems when he did not have it done. and had to have it done when he was older and he was in more pain then i think he would have been if he just had it done when he was born.|`|AA11987492	Your brother probably had problems becuse you Mom was forcibly retracting his foreskin to clean under it. This is not necessary, and actually dangerous. At birth, and sometimes until puberty, the foreskin is attatched to the glans like the fingernail is to the finger. It is NOT supposed to be retracted. It is like this in order to keep the head of the enis protected from urine and feces. Around the time a boy is potty trained, most boys are retractable. (you can pull the foreskin back) is this a coincidence? NO!!! There is no need to clean under the foreskin before it can be retracted because nothing can get under it. Do we need to clean under our fingernails? (the part that is actually attatched) no, because there is nothing to clean.    This is my answer to other questions from parents debating circumcision:    I chose NOT to have my son circumcised. It is not medically necessary, and the very few UTI's that it prevents are negated by the rate of complications. People say that it is easier to clean, but that is NOT the case! With an natural penis, you just wipe like a finger, but with a circumcised one, you have to have gauze, Vaseline, push back skin to prevent adhesion's, and think about it... a fresh wound being soaked in urine and feces all day?!?!?!?!?!?!    It is becoming less common is America (I don't know where you are?) So the locker room thing just wont hold up. Even if he does get made fun of for it, is it not our job as parents to build a healthy body image? If your daughter got made fun of for having small breast, would you immediately get her a breast augmentation? What are they making fun of anyway? At least he has a whole penis....    Looking like daddy, now this one makes me laugh! Ah, the ignorance of this statement! Since when do toddler boys look even remotely close to a grown man? What are you gonna tell him when he asks like he doesn't look like mommy or sissy??? And since when do teenagers compare penises with their father? This argument makes NO sense!!!    Your son can stay STD free with the use of a condom (which he should be using regardless of his circ status!) and still have his foreskin.    The foreskin is not just a useless flap of skin, it is a vital structure of the penis. http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/    If people are so worried about infections, HIV, and Cancer, the why why don't we give all baby girls routine mastectomies? That would eradicate breast cancer, which kills thousands every year, and is MUCH MUCH more common in the developed world than infections of the foreskin, penile cancer, and HIV put together!    The real kicker for me though, was the fact that I believe that we own our own bodies. Who am I to make that decision for my son. It is HIS penis, so it is HIS decision    http://www.naturalfamilyonline.com/5-bc/...    http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/    http://www.glorialemay.com/blog/?p=57    http://www.noharmm.org/mothering.htm    http://childbirth.amuchbetterway.com/sev...    http://viewofcircumcision.blogspot.com/|`|b26Dp8LKaa	I am strongly against routine circumcision. It's amazing to me the myths & false or inaccurate information that continues to surround circumcision! On a personal level, I have a son who is not circumcised. He has autism, is now a young adult & has NEVER had a single infection. I've never pulled back his foreskin to wash him. Not as an infant & not now. That may be routine for a sexually active adult male.    His dad is circumcised. We wondered about that as an issue. But really, the only difference a boy is likely to notice is that daddy's is bigger.  DADDY is more likely to notice the difference.     Most people don't know that the primary reason circumcision became routine in the US around the late 1800's was as an attempt to prevent masturbation. (I didn't)  Many reports say that the foreskin provides greater sensation for the male. Why would anyone want to take that away from our guys?    For those who say circumcision is for cleanliness or hygiene, you might want to do a little research. From a medical standpoint, that is untrue! There is a 1% increased risk of infection in the first year, which means you'd need to circumcise 100 penises to prevent a single UTI. Interestingly, there's about a 1% risk of complications when having the procedure.  Perhaps the foreskin actually protects the head of the penis from infection.    For you gals who insist that circumcision is cleaner, consider having your labia removed. Because really, that would be more hygienic also! And we gals have more issues to deal with in that department every month! LOL Sounds kinda extreme, though, doesn't it?    From the American Academy of Pediatrics:  "there is little evidence to affirm the association between circumcision status and optimal penile hygiene"; "Intact men enjoy four times more penile sensitivity than circumcised men"; "less sexual dysfunction in circumcised adult men"    http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi...    From the American Medical Association:  "data are not sufficient to recommend routine neonatal circumcision."  http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category...|`|OWOtKZmgaa	please leave him as nature intended because if another family member had a problem it does not mean your child will as only a small percentage of boys ever get any trouble with there foreskin. if we have a boy he will be left intact as its far healthier all the advantages have been found to be of almost no benefit and the procedure is terribly painful as pain relief is hardly administered at all due health risks. thanks for reading this.  p.s. it is very damaging and totally  unnessary to be trying to   retract and clean under a child's foreskin it does not need cleaning at this stage and  may not separate from the underlying glans fully until puberty.   makell this question must mean you live in the u.s. so please take note of the number of thumbs down i think they are telling you circumcision is dead so don't listen to your mum honey good luck|`|dOpKsNYcaa	Well as a male (who happens to be uncircumcised), I'm going to have to suggest you do a little more research into circumcision. A lot of women (who don't have a penis) are going to suggest you get him circumcised for whatever reason (they've heard). But most boys don't want to be circumcised and very few adult men would ever want to be circumcised. There is absolutely no reason why you need to do that to your son. There are so many reasons why circumcision on an infant is a bad idea, I don't have enough room to list them all here (e-mail me if you want more info), but suffice it to say, the more research you do into it the more you will see infant circumcision in America as the scam it really is. I would also recommend that you watch a circumcision before having it done to your kid. It's an extremel painful, invasive procedure (despite what some folks would have you believe). If you can still do that after seeing one for real, you're a better person that I am! Good luck.|`|a454ee46524abf792eec0686abd82584aa	Cost varies, around $500 at least.   It's likely that your mom or somebody else tried to retract your brother's foreskin too early, thinking that it had to be cleaned.   The penis forms as one organ and at birth the foreskin is usually fused to the glans like a fingernail to its finger. So there is no cavity for germs and dirt to collect in until it separates naturally later; sometimes not till puberty or later. Only the boy himself should retract it and then he can be taught to skin back and rinse with plain water regularly. Misguided attempts to retract too early, often by doctors and nurses, are the main cause of damage to boys foreskins and the real main reason for childhood circumcisions.   Otherwise it is rare for a boy that young to have any sort of foreskin problem. In fact the real rate of complications from circumcisions is under-reported, because they only record the ones that happen straight away, not things like too much skin removed or skin bridges, that are much harder to fix than foreskin problems. Even on the statistics that are collected medical authorities throughout the world have worked out that the overall complication rate is higher than all the benefits claimed by the pro-cutting advocates. One by one the claims are disproved but the pro-cutting zealots come up with more and keep quoting the old ones despite the evidence against them. For example you have more chance of dying from a circumcision or losing your penis from infection than from penile cancer. The rate of penile cancer is higher in the largely-circumcised USA than in European countries where less than 1% of the male population is circumcised. Plus circumcised men have been found to have penile cancer, mostly on the scar. (Remember this is a very rare disease in intact or circumcised men).  A very recent study in New Zealand followed a cohort of boys through life from birth to age 32. About 40% were circumcised. The intact males had a slightly lower rate of sexually transmitted infections than the circumcised but there was no significant difference.  Using surgery to mutilate the genitals instead of washing in a modern western society makes no sense. Normal intact male genitals are, if anything, easier to wash than female ones and the same substance, smegma collects in the genital folds of both sexes. A few intact males have problems with tight foreskin but this is only a tiny proportion of intact males. The condition can now be almost always treated with simple stretching exercises, sometimes in combination with a steroid cream that speeds up the process.  To perform a neo-natal circumcision the circumciser has to rip the attached foreskin away from the glans with forceps. Then the foreskin is either cut away or clamped until it falls off. Both methods cause the baby extreme pain and his raw glans and wound sting every time he urinates. It's quite common for the raw edges of the cut foreskin to fuse to the raw glans during the healing process, forming skin bridges or tags. More serious complications, though not common are immediate. Some babies lose their penis to infection, bleed profusely (often because they are haemophiliac) or even die each year.    Circumcision removes over half the skin of the penis (about 15 square inches or 40 square centimetres, in an adult) and it's not just simple skin. It's packed with nerve endings, special anatomical features like the ridged band and has a unique elastic gliding action, allowing it to slide on itself and act like lube. This action is what most males use to masturbate with. Circumcised males use what skin they have left, except those who are cut so tightly that they have to use lube or just rub it dry. The intact male can stroke the entire length of his penis using his foreskin and also has the option to use lube too, if he wants to. During intercourse the foreskin acts like lube on entry and may act as a dam, preventing lubricating secretions escaping from the vagina. In one study women reported that sex with an intact partner was gentler and more satisfying since he doesn't have to thrust as hard to feel enough stimulation. Removing the foreskin turns the surface of the glans from an inner mucosal membrane to outside skin. Newly circumcised adults usually go through some weeks of intense discomfort as the glans is constantly exposed to rubbing on clothing, until it develops a thicker keratin layer and becomes less sensitive. A recent study has shown real differences in fine touch sensitivity between circumcised and intact penises and that the most sensitive parts of the intact penis are those that would be removed by circumcision.  I am circumcised and hate it. I wish I'd been given the chance to choose for myself. Your son will grow up with many intact friends and there is every chance he would resent this unnecessary cosmetic surgery.  Geoff|`|k4nKYlW7aa	I wish my mom never had me circumcised! All it does is make it harder to masturbate without a foreskin and it has no medical benefits. Circumcision is really dumb and selfish because boys don't even get to choose for themselves! All these "moms" wanting to cut their boys penises are ridiculous!|`|TsjqzanQaa	I would tell your mother to get herself circumcised first, a female circumcision, so that she can experience firsthand all of the wonderful "benefits" that she proposes inflicting on a helpless male child, since she thinks that circumcision, or genital mutilation, is so beneficial.    I wonder how she would enjoy being scarred, mutilated and deprived of sexual sensitivity for life.    Having a foreskin is natural and normal; circumcision isn't.    The penis, whether intact or mutilated can develop a problem.    Circumcision causes many complications, and has adverse effects that the doctors don't disclose, and in fact, they suppress.    They don't want to discourage anyone from perpetrating this on their sons.    I was a victim of male genital mutilation, called circumcision.      As a result of the damage sustained, I was unable to achieve orgasm in normal sex.      Circumcision destroys an average of 50-75% of sexual sensitivity, and more in some cases.    After years, I found out about foreskin restoration, and this has vastly improved my sexual sensitivity and function, together with increasing the intensity of orgasms.    Don't inflict this on your child; he's whole, please leave him that way.    Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.    A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.    ERIC|`|44OH7Si6aa	My Doctor charges $500 up front if you are planing to have your son circumcised and your insurance doesn't cover it.   My insurance was willing to cover the procedure when our son was born but has since changed their policy. We elected not to have him circumcised. He is at higher risk for a urinary tract infection and we had to take the extra time to clean the penis and pull back the foreskin when changing his diapers. He's 5 now, we've had no problems from it what-so-ever. When we looked at the research so much of it was inconclusive about preventing disease and better functionality in sex, we just decided to leave him the way nature intended.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	The reason your insurance doesn't cover it is because it's not medically necessary, so there is part of your answer.    There are some rare circumstances in which a boy that is not circumcised could have a problem later on, but it's not common and I personally do not believe that that justifies the procedure.    I did not have it done.  It is an unnecessary surgery.  It is painful for babies.  Unless it's for religious reasons, I really don't understand why anyone would do it.      You are this child's mother and this is probably the first, of many times, that your mom will want you to do something.  You sound ambivalent.  Don't do it just because she wants you to.|`|zwctZ812aa	the person who said no insurance companies cover it is wrong.  my insurance covered my son's circumcision.  We have Kaiser.  Anyways, to answer your question, if you aren't a fan of the process, then don't do it.  It is a totally person choice.  I chose to have my son circumcised.  It was done in the hospital when he was a day old and he was fine.  His dad went in the room with him and said he didn't even cry.  It healed up nicely and we havn't had any problems with it.  I do believe it is more hygienic, though I know a million people on this site will argue with that.  I'm prepared for the thumbs down!|`|lGSUToFQaa	i had our son circumcised i don't think it was really even a question with us, i asked my hubby once but i knew he'd say yes, because it's easier to clean, and it's more sanitary. but that was us|`|K4zsztkRaa	Insurance doesn't cover it becasue there is no reason to get a circumcision.  There isn't.  I don't know what was wrong with your little brother but unless it needs to be done, it shouldn't be done.    I was circumcised as a baby and I won't ever forgive my mother on some level for doing it. She violated my human rights and took advantage of her power as a parent. As a mother it's her job to protect me and my rights, not violate my rights and make life changing choices about my genitals for me.  That's my job and as a parent she should automaticaly understand that and leave me a lone. At least thats the way I feel.  I'ts my penis, not anyone elses and only I can decide if I want it cut up or not. I would rather have left it whole.  1 because I am of a religion that shuns it,  2 sex feels a lot better when you aren't circumcised (I am restoring my foreskin I know that your sensitivity doubles when you have a foreskin)  3 it's the way I was born and I should have the right to be as I was born  4 plastic surgery demeans the human body.    Also it's very, very rare that a boy "needs" to get circumcised later in life. Statistics prove that about 50,000 circumcisions have to be preformed to prevent a major infection that requires surgery.  It's very rare that someone needs to get it done. Plus why are you going to cut off a part of his body that most likley won't cause any problems?   To me it makes no sense to circumcise a child for a condition he may never have in his life.    Just because your brother had issues doesn't mean your son will.    Also keep in mind these statistics:  Women are 10 times as likley to get an infection over a male, and you very rarely hear of a female getting a bad infection. So that tells you something.  Women get 9 times as much smegma and build up than an uncircumcised male. So women are the ones that have to worry about keeping clean, not males.  A vagina is A LOT harder to clean than a penis. A penis takes 20 seconds to clean in the shower.    It's best to leave your child as he was born and let him decide what he's going to do with what is his.  Also if he has to get it done later in life, it's better than getting it done as a baby. It hurts less as an adult. It would hae been his choice and he will behappy with his choice, he might not be happy with yours.  Also there is less of a risk of there being problems with the circ. Circumcisions are more likley to get botched when done to babies than adults.  1 out of every 10 infant circimcisions, something doesn't go right. And that is a proven statistic.  Sometimes the problems don't show up untill the boy is grown up, and even then the guy doesn't notice there is something wrong, like skin bridges or too tight of skin that causes painfull intercourse.    His body  his choice.    That's the way I look at things.  Circumcision also reduces sexual feeling, it's not your right to take sexual pleasure away from someone else.  Your kid or not, only he can decide that for himself.      That's my opinion    -Connor|`|rjVALevtaa	When I had my first son I didn't have insurance for him. When he got circumcised it costs about $150, of course this was 4 years ago so it may be different now.     Both of my boys are circumcised. I know it isn't medically necessary, but a circumcised penis is easier to clean. Plus their father is circumcised so it just seemed like the right choice.|`|tHM6TjtIaa	I have 2 sons and 4 daughters. I have had both of my sons circumcised and do not regret it at all. It is mostly a personal decision, some do it for religious reasons but that was not the case with us.     It is a decision you make and will be just the beginning of difficult decisions as a mother. Do know that there is nothing wrong with or with not doing it. Your mother is probably just trying to be helpful in offering you advice on your journey into motherhood :) feel blessed you have that. I only wish I did.    Best Wishes & God Bless|`|VR9KhbEgaa	As far as insurance is concerned, to my knowledge there is not one out there that will including Medicaid! The cost is around $100 to $200 depending upon where you live. The dr. will send you a bill for this and you can make payment arrangements if you do not have the money at the time to pay for the entire bill. That is no reason not to have your son circumcised. I have 5 boys and 1 girl. All of my sons are circumcised. Unless you have religious reasons not to do so I feel you need to have this done. I have only heard bad things from parents that have chosen not to do this.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	If you have a doctor who knows how to care for an intact penis circumcision is almost never indicated.      The uncircumcised penis requires LESS care the entire time baby is in diapers (which most are at age 2).  Its probable your mom was forcibly retracting your brother's foreskin, that is wrong and causes problems.  The uncircumcised penis should be cleaned like a finger -you don't peel your nail back to scrub it, don't rip the foreskin off the glans!  Or if you like its more like the vagina, soaps and excessive cleaning cause it to be more prone to infections (like yeast).      However the circumcised penis, particularly the loose circumcisions which are more common now (to prevent bent penis, hairy shaft, and painful erections because of too little skin in the adult) the foreskin must be retracted at least once a day to prevent adhesions from forming.  Adhesions can cause scarring and more damage.    Previously unretractable foreskins in children over a certain age (5, 10, 15, 18, whatever) or adult penises that became nonretractile were treated with circumcision.  Now steroid creams and "exercise" are used.  In combination with antibiotics or antifungals if needed.  You don't cut the labia off for recurrent UTIs or yeast infections, doctors should know better than to amputate the foreskin.    I have two sons that are uncircumcised and have never had a problem.

QBOtYUGyaa	Be friendly with her, but keep your distance. If I were you, I wouldn't take her too seriously; you'll find that the people who go furthest are the ones who believe in honesty.     It seems like the two of you just aren't meant to be friends anymore. It's too bad, but it happens. I truly believe, though, that there are too many people in this world to stick around a person like that. You'll find a person you match up well with; just give it some time.    Hope that helps!|`|x3vnPezTaa	Honestly, If she was your true friend she wouldn't be so insensitive to you and what has happened with your sister.  I can see from what you have said here that you are trying to better your life in a positive way and she could care less about actually doing whats right. I would just say dump her. Let her do her own thing and don't let her be on your team. You don't need that. She seems like the type of person that would let you do all the work but she would be the one to take credit for it. The friendship is just one sided now because you are a caring person. You're the only one who truly cares but if i were you i would stop FAST. Live your life and let her live hers. Be done with it, It's a lost cause. I've had a similar situation happen to me not to long ago. Sometimes you need to just let things be and move on. And remember everything happens for a reason. If its meant to be it will work itself out. Its all about karma hun. Good luck! Stay thinking positive about your future and forget about hers.|`|dX63OGoaaa	I say get a new friend.

I'm sure the farther along you get the more excited he'll be. Just let him feel what's he's feeling now. Pregnancy is a scary thing for both the woman and her partner.|`|6avKnzkoaa	Time. A lot is probably going through his mind: How things will change, that he's going to be a dad, financial responsibility, etc. He might come around later after he's gotten his head around it.

I wish you the best of luck!|`|cbkvWnb4aa	it takes time my boyfriend was the same way and he still has his days one day hes excited the next hes not once she is here I think he will be better about it.

TXddP0uxaa	You are the adult, you make him take it.  Be firm and let him know that one way or the other he WILL take his medicine.  Give him the chance to take it nice, and if he does (no whining or fighting) he gets a piece of candy or something.  Nothing big, just a single hershey's kiss will do.  If he doesn't, you will MAKE him take his medicine.  It isn't nice or pleasant for anyone, but hold him down, plug his nose and make him swallow.  It's just that simple.  Don't allow a 3 year old to call the shots.|`|3Psi4kBxaa	Use a syringe. It is far easier.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Most strong things like chocolate pudding would dilute the taste.

Or you can stuff it in a sandwich.

To make it easy to swallow tell him to put it on his tounge take some water and tilt his head all the way back.

Don't make a big deal about medication time.   good luck!|`|73193e3b067ba4736d1fab4da3289625aa	Really it wont help with whatever you mix it with. The trick is to make him want to take it. Make up a chart for him...let him help make it. Explain that its a big boy chart for taking medicine. Only big boys get to have charts like this. Mark off each time he has to take his medicine and give him a marker or a pencil or a sticker is better. Explain that every time he takes his medicine properly (like a big boy) he will get a piece of candy or chocolate or whatever he likes most. Show him the chart and let him cross out each time he takes the medicine. Tell him that after he takes the medicine say 10 times (or whatever you think best) then he gets a special treat. He can go and get a movie to rent or go to McDonald's or go for a drive somewhere or go to the park or to visit someone. Has to be something he likes doing...a treat. He is old enough to grasp the idea and once he gets a treat the first time he will probably want to take the medicine 5 times a day to make the treat come along faster. Make the taking of the medicine business like..dont appologise or say its nasty just say time for your medicine and pour it and say nothing until he takes it.|`|jvW3a5GYaa	You are the parent, he's 3 years old - you say  "here take this".

xue72D76aa	You produce colostrum for the first few days (2-3) after birth, then you typically begin to express milk.  The colostrum content remains pretty high for the first several weeks and then slowly shifts to more milk content.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	You start producing colostrum about the middle of pregnancy BUT anywhere from 2-8 months is normal.  The inability to express colostrum does not mean its not there.    You produce "milk" 30-40 hours after birth.    The feeling of your "milk coming in" is from an increase in lymph fluid and blood flow to the breast, not milk.    http://www.kellymom.com/bf/supply/milkpr...  Endocrine (Hormonal) Control of Milk Synthesis -- Lactogenesis I & II    Milk production doesnt start out as a supply and demand process. During pregnancy and the first few days postpartum, milk supply is hormonally driven  this is called the endocrine control system. Essentially, as long as the proper hormones are in place, mom will start making colostrum about halfway through pregnancy (Lactogenesis I) and her milk will increase in volume (Lactogenesis II) around 30-40 hours after birth.    During the latter part of pregnancy, the breasts are making colostrum, but high levels of progesterone inhibit milk secretion and keep the volume turned down. At birth, the delivery of the placenta results in a sudden drop in progesterone/estrogen/HPL levels. This abrupt withdrawal of progesterone in the presence of high prolactin levels cues Lactogenesis II (copious milk production). Other hormones (insulin, thyroxine, cortisol) are also involved, but their roles are not yet well understood. Although biochemical markers indicate that Lactogenesis II commences approximately 30-40 hours after birth, mothers do not typically begin feeling increased breast fullness (the sensation of milk "coming in") until 50-73 hours (2-3 days) after birth.     http://ninemsn.birth.com.au/Info.asp?cla...  The milk. About 72 to 96 hours (3 to 4 days) after the birth, the milk changes from being 'transitional milk' to mature milk, and is said to 'come in'. The volume of milk noticeably increases, and for some women can be seen to flow, or leak, readily when the baby comes off the breast.    The milk 'coming in' is the time that the breastfeeding will start to incorporate a 'let down' reflex. A 'let-down' is a response by the woman's body to the baby suckling. The stimulation of her nipple triggers the release of her natural oxytocin hormone from the brain, which causes her milk to 'eject', or flow freely. The 'let down' is also known as the 'milk ejection reflex'.    The breasts. The woman's breasts usually feel heavy, 'firm' or 'full' and warm. They will increase considerably in size (although this is only temporary for a few days). The breasts may look a little flushed, and the woman may have a slight temperature (up to 38 degrees Celsius). Most of the 'fullness' in the breasts is due to an increase in blood supply to the breasts (called 'vascular engorgement') and an expansion of the lymph supply, as well as the start of the mature milk production. This is why it is usually difficult for the woman to judge if her breasts feel 'full' or 'empty' after a feed (or to tell by feeling, which breast she fed from last!)    For a day or so, the supply of milk will be a little more than the baby needs, contributing to an 'overfull' feeling. It is crucial for the baby to feed 'on-demand' at this time, to keep the milk flowing, otherwise the normal vascular engorgement will turn into painful 'milk engorgement', as the alveoli distend with milk. However, many women will want to feed their baby regularly at this time, because it relieves the overfullness.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	it varies by woman -my milk came in at 5 mos gestation.  by the time, i gave birth i had buckets but no colostrum.|`|dwdLkvgPaa	Well I started to leak milk while about 7 months pregnant but my milk didn't fully come in until around 4 days after my baby was born...but you produce colostrum right away...|`|7CoVXfA1aa	Your milk "comes in" about 3 or so days after birth.

r2FxWILBaa	He probably has an umbilical hernia, like my son did. Don't worry about it. It will go away in time. If he still has it by the time he's about 3 years old, they'll do surgery. But until then, just be careful not to put him in pants that are too tight on him as this will push it in. DO NOT push it in on your own. They used to do this years ago with a quarter and a piece of tape, but its been found to cause serious problems. So just be careful around it, make sure to mention it to your doctor at baby's next appt and don't worry :)|`|be8738c7b3a936fc2e865b3f0e6ad7d4aa	My son had that and his doctor said it was an umbilical hernia. She told us to use medical tape and a large button, we taped in to his belly button (change it frequently and make sure the area is really dry) over and over for about a month. He has an innie now :)|`|VudhjHi2aa	More than likely it will go back in but their is a Belly binder you can buy for like $2 if you want. My mom used them on me and I have a cute lil innie. ;o)|`|DuCxFQywaa	did u make sure it doesn't have a baby hernia? well nayways i bought a belly button belt for my little girl but she ended up having a baby hernia, it healed all by itself and she now has a precious little innie!|`|UIS8Wll1aa	My daughters belly Button started pocking out and her doctor told me she has a hernia but, not to worry it would go away on its on
gz1avio9aa	I like Phil!  Let's name him....Max|`|DdjpQr0Gaa	I wouldnt take that chance.  If u thought of it then you can bet some mean person would call him that at some point.  Phillip is a nice name but i would definately not put the two together.  you are right to be concerned and it shows you will make a great father because u r already thinking of his future and feelings.  best of luck to u and ur wife|`|EIgmm8ilaa	I'm sure SOMEONE will call him Phil, maybe you could consider Phillip is a middle name.|`|8ff3196b10cd4c3afc116407535b3666aa	Just make she his is called Phillip. Or name him Phillip Jacob and call him PJ.|`|Elxuvon8aa	If you want him called Phillip just tell people to use the full name. My sister is crystal she has never been called Chris or Christy|`|PWVYYh2Haa	i think someone will end up calling him Phil. I have a daughter and i liked the name Madison, but not Madi, my husband and i agreed that we were naming her Madison and we would not let any one call her Madi. Well she is three now and thanks to the staff at her daycare she only will answer to Madi, which i now think is kinda cute, but nicknames happen, and your son will probaly end up being called Phil. Have you suggested Phillip for the middle name?|`|QQI4rliYaa	CHOOSE JAMAUL AS A NAME|`|oAbmSV6Gaa	Okay I see your point...I believe that children are cruel...and they might make fun of him. I would choose another name.|`|nK4bytqdaa	phillip is a fine name.  if you are really doubtful about it you can always use it as a middle name.
y43tzOQlaa	I truly believe that there is no substitute for experience. If you have lived it and learned from it then you have a good insight when you give advice.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	a softy or a passive door matt? If a man cheats on you and you take it ..your showing your daughters how to become victims and passive dependent twits|`|shBj5RElaa	i live what I say,period|`|ORy1HG0yaa	I'll put in my 2 cents =o)    I am a mother of a 1 yr old, and I have seen a lot. The advice I give people is either what I did, heard, experienced, or (in my opinion) would do if I were in their situation. But, as you pointed out, I cannot know what I would really do until that situation arises.     Also, on the flip side, you do not always have 100% of the story on here. People leave out important details, or even a word here or there, that might completely change your answer.     Bottom line: I am here to help others, and even get some help myself at times. I stand behind all of my answers, and hope that other people find them useful!
UKPYoPKuaa	Kimora?    I like Sakura aswell btw|`|nrQhVcy7aa	sakira|`|LgxVVDWraa	Oh my god I was going to ignore this question due to the already decent responses but I have to say...PLEASE do not name your child after something you see in anime  no offense to the speaker above, I know what anime she watches it's very popular in Japan and it's known as InuYasha.    However, if you actually went around naming your kid after anime they would get ridiculed in Japan.  For example, InuYasha is a name used in anime.  "Inu" means dog.    don't name your child sango, please, or after any name you see in anime.  Ask your Japanese friends first what kind of names are acceptable for a non Japanese in Japanese society.  You really don't want actual, real life Japanese people making fun of your children PLEASE....  for the sake of your child~!|`|ZGMsI5ykaa	I love the names you like!!!! They're beautiful!! Are you pregnant? Sorry to ask, but i had to. What about Kiomara or Kiaritzi or Kiara??! I am not sure if the are Japanese! Sorry if they're not!! My daughter goes to school with a Kiomara, Kiara and Kiaritzi!!|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	How about a name like    Mai  Rena  It's a janapanese name and westren name at the same time|`|kBek6QCLaa	for girls I like:  Rio   Kaoru  Emi  Kira  Kaede    for boys:  Jun    ...that's all i got for my favorites|`|H7kAHTyOaa	KiraKira: It means like glittering and shining.     I prefer Kirakira, but I like Sakura for a girl. And I think Kohta is very catchy.    Congrats and good luck!|`|fthTHYFgaa	I love Keiko for a girl.  It means Blessing.  Sakura is cute.  Kohta is nice, too.|`|coVZ1uqCaa	Sakura & Yukio are completely lovely names for a girl. I absolutely fell in love with Sakura. It's so elegant.    Kohta -- I never heard of, but I'm sure I'll be in love with that name any time soon.    I used to watch a lot of anime shows (Japanese), and I've got some.    Girls :    Sango (Song - oh)  Kagome (Kah-go-may)  Hinata (He-nah-tah)    Boys :    Ren    Sorry ! That's all I know for now. Hope I helped (:    By the way : I went to Japan a couple of years ago. I loved it. I hope you'll enjoy your trip there, also.    -----
yiR22Gabaa	Just honestly tell him why you want him to stop and get your family to back you up.   ~I'm concerned for your health  ~It's bad for the rest of us  ~It's dangerous to leave them smoldering  ~It's worrisome that you take time out of your day just to smoke     etc.    Learn your facts. Show him pictures of a smoker's lungs. Give him researched statistics about how long smokers live.      AND offer to help! Do your research! I've heard that little suckers are good for smokers trying to quit. That's what my friend's dad did.     Good luck!|`|k6XRVeJxaa	You can't.

2a2c24fc81bc910e984828a1ab26fd3daa	My situation is very different from yours, but I will tell you what I went through.  When I got pregnant with my 1st child, everything was going along smoothly, felt like everything was fine, felt great, but at 22 weeks with no warning, no symptoms, my water broke.  I went to the hospital with very bad pains, I was unsure as to what was happening.  My doctor told me my water had broke and I had an infection called amnioitis, which is an infection of the amniotic sac, and they had to induce me, and my baby had a less than 5% chance of survival if she was born alive.  Unfortunately 10 hours later, my daughter was born stillborn.  Devastated me.  8 months later, I got pregnant again.  Starting from 14 weeks on, I started having problems, I got full placenta previa, I got put in the hospital on bed rest for a few days, the placenta corrected itself, but when that happened, the placenta started to tear away from the wall of the uterus, so I stayed in the hospital a few more days to try to give it a chance to reattach, which it did, thankfully.  At 22 weeks, I went to ER with very bad pains, feeling like I was in labor, and I, in fact, was in labor, and if I wouldn't have come in, I would have ended up losing that pregnancy as well.  I was stuck in the hospital on bed rest for a week.  At 27 weeks, I was in ER again with premature labor, and they found out during an ultrasound, that I had a tear in my cervix, which my doctors attributed to my daughter that was stillborn, coming down when I wasn't fully dilated, so at 27 weeks, I had a stitch put in my cervix called a cerclage, in the hospital for a week after that to get my labor under control.  At 31 weeks, put in the hospital after going into labor again, for the remainder of my pregnancy, I was having contractions, numerous times a day.  At 32 weeks, they couldn't get my labor stopped, and I got put on magnesium sulfate (such fun stuff isn't it?), which I was on for 4 days.  On the 4th day, they had to take me off of it cold turkey, my heartrate had gone down so low, they were afraid if I stayed on it any longer, even to wean me off of it, that my heart would stop.  So I got put into a medically induced coma for 2 days so they could take me off of it cold turkey.  I ended up giving birth to my daughter, who is now almost 11, at 35 weeks, she was a little sick, spent 2 weeks in NICU, had problems her first year but has been very healthy and happy ever since.    I am now pregnant with my 3rd child, 12 weeks pregnant as of tomorrow, with no real problems so far.    I do wish you the best of luck!|`|SUWxxF85aa	aww this is an amazing story, sorry i cannot answer your question because i am only seventeen but i wish you health and happiness for the future and a happy healthy life for your newborn xo
QvmHjhdsaa	While not having the same issues that you have had I have never had a "normal decent pregnancy" My first pregnancy was a molar pregnancy and I had to have a d&c to clear that up and be monitored for about 6 months to make sure everything was clear. After that I was able to try again. I got pregnant immediately. I was sooo sick. Morning sickness, uti's, dehydration and extra hospital stays. I finally went into labor and because I was not dialating they "assumed" it was false. However it turned out I was actually in real labor but my body refuses to dialate (my sis has the same thing) I was in labor for nearly two weeks befire my crazy dr would allow a c-section. The nurses told me later that with how i was inside I would have never delivered naturally. 14 days after I had her the incision from my c-section basically exploded and I was in the hospital yet again. It was severely infected and I had to be on some heavy duty antibiotics. After I went home I had to stay on antibiotics (iv) for about 8  weeks. I have terrible veins and every time the nurse would come and put a new iv in it would only last about 1-2 days before blowing meaning I was black and blue everywhere. The worst was when she had no more veins to find and had to dig around for veins in my feet. OUCH!!    When my sweet baby was 2 we ended up pregnant with another girl. I do not recall the pregnancy itself being quite so awful other than the normal complaints. Delivery was a nightmare. I of course had to have another c-section which was planned. During the surgery my spinal started to wear off so I was able to actually feel what the dr was doing. They doped me up with extra morphine and that was that. My daughter had trouble breathing once she was born and had to be wisked away to the nursery for oxygen. I was back in recovery baby still in the nursery getting her care when my blood pressure dropped DRAMATICALLY like to 50/30 everyone was freaking out. Turns out I was bleeding internally. THey decided instead of opening me back up they would do several blood transfusions and if my bp regulated then we were ok if it didnt get better they were going to have to open me back up and find where it was going. Luckily it got better I was just wiped from having lost so much blood. My daughter was brought to me and i was too weak to hold her for more than like 5 mins. When she was 2 days old she started having seizures and had to be transfered to Childrens hospital where she stayed for the first 8 weeks of her life in the NICU. We got home for thanksgiving but the sunday after she was back in the hospital for another week or two. We spent EVERY sunday for the first 6 months of her life in the ER because her medications were so wonkey. We decided then and there no more. I couldnt handle the pregnancies and we were very overwhelmed by this new baby    That being said I am pregnant with my 3rd angel (a boy this time) This pregnancy has been no better I have suffered from the  most awful morning sickness. My kids have brought home so many stomach bugs that I cant even count them anymore (they of course always share lol) And when I was 19 weeks I went into the hopital in such pain I was praying to be rendered unconscious or just die ...... whatever made the hurt stop was ok. We found out I had an ovarian cyst that was twisted around ovary and fallopian tubes cutting off it's blood supply making it the worst pain I have ever had in my entire life. They tried to drain it with a needle but that didnt work so they had to do major abdominal surgery to remove the cantelope sized cyst. It was unreal. I  was in the hospital for 4 days and we were very  unsure as to wether or not the baby was going to make it.  He DID!! 2 weeks ago I went in to the hospital because i thought my water had broken. It had not but due to low lying placenta I have been bleeding and spotting since then. I have contractions whenever I stand up. My dr has put me on bed/house rest. basically As long as i am sitting i am following dr orders only allowed potty trips and a shower then it is right back on my butt. My doc tells me that because of where the placenta is he will have to cut through it during the c-section which can lead to extreme bleeding (they will have extra on hand) and that if the bleeding wont stop I will end up with a hysterectomy.     We are DEFINITELY done having kids now.  I have already had to have one ovary and tube removed. We are hoping to be able to salvage the other but tie it so I cant get pregnant again. All of this hinges on wether or not he ends up having to do a hysterectomy.    All that and I dont regret a single moment. NOT A ONE!!! Scary heck yeah! but God has gotten me through each pregnancy and I have a fabulous dr. I would not trade any one of my kids for an "easy" pregnancy. Would it have been nice to have normal for once. Of course! But I didnt and I have 2 almost 3 beautiful babies because of it. Only you can decide if you want to risk another pregnancy. I|`|i8NOVfm0aa	i had a easy pregnancy but i hated the delivery part 13 hours of labor with an epidural that didnt work and 2 waters! lol but that sounds like nothing compared to what you went through. congrats and you must of have the best christmas present.. your little boy home with you where he belonged. if you want to try for another baby i think you should go for it! god bless you and your family and your heart!|`|MzHwklzKaa	Each pregnancy is different, and there's really no way to predict.    I do want to add a few things for you to consider.    If it does go bad, are you ready and willing to die and leave your son motherless?  Is that fair to him?  Say you don't die.  Say your heart is further damaged, and you can't live a normal life.  Is it fair to your kid(s) that you can't do things other moms do?    Is your heart condition genetic?  Do you think it's fair to play Russian Roulette with an unborn child's health?  Is it fair to deliberately conceive a child that may face life long heart problems?    I think you should count your blessings and not try again.|`|AhoB10CTaa	you know, i always thought i had a horrible pregnancy, but mine was a cake walk compared to yours! it makes me feel like a whiny brat. i had the usual feet and hand swelling, major major heartburn, SEVERE leg cramps ( to the point where i could scream it hurt so bad), my back felt like it was going to break and my stomach was so itchy i could have scratched it until i bled. but i had a healthy baby at full term, so i really have nothing to complain about and should just shut up because i know some women out there have had it far worse than me. i think you're a strong person and i wish you all the luck in the world w/ baby number 2! they are worth every painful second, aren't they. :)
14JQ11AUaa	It is common, more in boys than girls. It will go away in a couple months! Do not put lotions or soaps on it, it will irritate it even more! Good luck, congratulations on your new baby :)|`|Z1atdG4kaa	My daugher had it too...it is normal and will go away. For us parents it does make you feel bad though. It's not causing her any discomfort just be patient and let them go away on their own.|`|0zpWVq0Iaa	Hello Kim-  ahah I am only a 13 year old girl,  but i am hopping I can help.!  I am a aunt of a baby who has baby acne also and sometiems his bumps appear in random places at random times,  I dont think theres anythign wronge  unless the bumps start to change in size and color-  check webmd.com  Mayeb that will help.!|`|L1FqPE3Vaa	My baby sister had the same thing. We tried not to kiss her so muvh, but she was so cute...haha, so just avoid kissing him where the bumps are and wash his face with a warm wash cloth, and skip the soap if his skin is really sensitive.|`|AA11625299	ok, its just baby acne...dont worry so much, my daughter got the same thing...it started clearing up and then her skin got really dry and flaky, now it is gone, its just a little dry, and I asked my dr what I could do( it wasnt bothering her just me) but they told me to get the aveeno lotion for babies and now its almost all gone!!!|`|X7nKeapbaa	the only thing that i done with my daughter was give her a bath day and night and use dettol soap wash his face with a face washer and the should clear up. if i skiped a day without giving her a bath they would show really bad so i gave her one everyday twice
vOomJtbsaa	Lol so funny that you asked this question.   Thats the first thing that made my son laugh out loud when he was 2 months old, having his boogies sucked out of his nose!  He gave me this huge belly laugh, he thought it was so amusing! It was hysterical and heartbreakingly adorable.  I remember jumping up and down and screaming to my hubby to come look at the baby and we continued sucking his boogies for about 15 minutes making him giggle, it was fantastic!  My son (almost 5 months now) is a little comic, he laughs at everything but that was the first thing he ever laughed at.|`|RT3Og4Oiaa	lol funny, i just finished sucking my lo's nose out about 15 mins ago....and she screamed!!! she is in my lap now...all happy.|`|c5519f0ed7a867f4c4afd56a3ecd58b1aa	I have a 5 month old who also likes it he just pulls his head back a little but won't cry.|`|HqOkC2YHaa	Mine swats at the suction, or she turns her head from side to side. I'm afraid one day I'm going to poke her eye out...so I've stopped using the bulb and resort to my pinky nail for the hard ones which are at the tip, but when they're liquidy and easy to suction I put up the battle with her. She doesn't whine thank goodness she justs squirms!|`|SaRDq9iLaa	My daughter starts crying and turns her head away real fast.  I usually have to try to hold her head while my husband tries to get the boogies out.|`|WxQFe0GYaa	That's funny, because my baby actually kind of likes it!  When he sees me pulling it out, he smiles and laughs.  I'm so glad he likes it because I love to suck boogers out!|`|3hIr3Dllaa	Mine screams her head off|`|xPR7g0wFaa	How Cute is that! My kids hated it.|`|VudhjHi2aa	My son was the same way.... he did not care.... then he hit 9 to 10 months and he Hated it. I guess at first they don't seem to mined it all that much but when he got to an age of understanding. He said the heck with that.    Have you ever tried it on yourself?    I haven't LOL but a girlfriend of mine did and she said it "sucked"   She said it felt like her brain was going to pop out of her head. lol|`|MslcyESfaa	My 5 month old doesn't mind the saline drops, but when I use suction, whoa! He starts shrieking and turns his head back and forth like he's saying no! lol|`|rjVALevtaa	Oh god! I wish my son was like that! My youngest is 5 months old and just recently became sick for the first time. He screams his head off and tosses back and forth when I try to suction his nose.    Consider yourself lucky!|`|bf2b826fb186efa4963970654d24ac34aa	My elder boys hated it. The newest little man will try to turn his head away, but he doesn't scream unless I try too many times. He's more annoyed then anything else because it's not what he's wanting at the time. I have tried it myself and it doesn't hurt but it feels kinda weird. It tickled my nose and made it itch!|`|n6XYYyoLaa	i love the name lilah, but my dd has and does hate it with a passion, and i can't stand for their to be anything in her nose!!! and it is so little, that i can't possibly get it with a kleenex or anything else....she cries and fights me the whole way....she even tries to push my hands and arms away, LOL...and i feel like i am torturing her every time....:(
kRaVa0Wraa	nope, it can be like an "old-school" sleepover with no guys or drinking!  haha. (: sounds kinda fun tho.|`|QGkBZFqWaa	Call into your favorite radio station and try to request a song.  That's what my friends and I did.    On my 13th birthday My friends were calling in nonstop to ask them to give me a birthday shout out. THEY DID IT! It was like 2:00am though :P|`|QkKXX6igaa	u'll be fine, truth or dare is always fun...chances are you won't have time to do all you want, cause it's hanging out with friends, you find things to talk about and do.|`|uHTpBjWDaa	Do what comes to any of you.  Drugs and alcohol are not at all needed, and you were probably asked that to tell a parent or something like that.  Whet ever you think is fun others will probably enjoy too.          If you're still having second thoughts though, I could come.  Haha jk.|`|xYrjfxfzaa	Prank calls, truth or dare, and taking pictures are fun too. If she brings or makes you buy alcohol ban her from the sleepover. I want to come!|`|MHxeLTUPaa	No, it is not a bad idea. The good parties are the ones without drugs, boys, alcohol! When you include alcohol and especially drugs, that only calls for trouble. It's sad that a lot of parties do contain alcohol but it's best not to have alcohol, especially parties around your age. Some ideas is to go rent a movie or few and watch and enjoy popcorn, chips etc.    Hope you have a good time. If any trouble (with ideas for the party and stuff), email me and I'll try to help.|`|kvYE5HRSaa	No alcohol, or drugs are definitely not needed to make it "cool".  Playing wii sports is always fun with a lot of other people if you have it.  Games like Twister are fun also.  Hope this helps                   ~Dan~|`|VHQG3PlLaa	I am so glad that there are no boys, drugs, or alcohol. :o)  You could possibly get some avocado cream to put on each others faces. Other than that, Sounds like fun.
WWcaKZ7Qaa	I don't see why you can't. It's not like there is a no pregnant ladies driving law or something...lol. The only way I wouldn't would be if I knew it was going to put too much stress on me or something. You should be fine :)|`|m2aznd8xaa	yes you cantake a road test no matter how far along you are as long as you arent going into labor.|`|nlKZRNqmaa	I was when I took mine years ago.. you should be fine|`|SnDTQwGnaa	i did..|`|MslcyESfaa	sure, u just might not be comfortable tho! :)|`|Bt3857hxaa	I think you should just wait until your baby is born. Because I rather u not take it while ur going to give birth anytime soon. You never know what could happen while ur driving. There are alot of crazy drivers on the road. What if some person crash into you.  Plus...what happens if your water breaks or u get side pains or any other problems. You never know what could happen while ur on the road. You need to relax and be safe.     Just wait until baby is born!...That way, when u have someone to watch baby. You can go ahead and take your test.     Good luck and conjurations       God bless =D
1CryEnb3aa	Too soon.  You should wait two weeks from ovulation.  This should be around the time you should expect A.F.  Take a hpt with first morning urine and if neg wait a couple days and test again.  If, you get another neg, go see your dr. for a blood test as this can detect from the day of conception.  I know waiting is terrible, but testing too soon can give you a false negative and get you down and inin factou could very well be pregnant.  I hope you get a BFP!  keeping my fingers crossed for you!!|`|eNAvGgHAaa	that's too soon.  wait until Feb 10 days.    good luck!|`|MslcyESfaa	How regular are your cycles? I would start maybe around Feb 2 or so if you are every 28 days. Either way, stock up on HPTs from Family Dollar and your good to go! Good luck :)|`|ra3EsJ1raa	No. Sunday should not be too soon. Are your cycles pretty normal? Like 28-30 days? If so, you count from the first day of your last period. If your period ended on the 5th, then you likely started your period around the 2nd, making Jan. 2nd the first day of this cycle.     Start counting Jan. 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15. You probably ovulated around the 15th. So yesterday the 29th would have been day 28 of your cycle. Good luck!
23MPcnNqaa	I have twin boys, and we bought their first cake.  I'm not much of a baker and I wanted everything to be perfect on their day.    We did a "Blue's Clues" theme because my boys just adored her at that time.  So the main cake had a big picture of Blue on it.  We also decided to get the boys each a baby "block" cake.  A piece of cake for each of them in the shape of a baby block.  The bakery that made the cakes did a really nice job!!  And my boys loved digging into them.|`|LbkLg4RFaa	Made it.  Round Vanilla cupcakes joined together to make a caterpillar.  It had green butter cream icing with green tinted coconut and a few sprinkles covering the cream.  Smarties for legs, eyes and mouth.  A cupcake for each guest with a few extras in case of seconds.|`|HqOkC2YHaa	My daughters not near 1 yet, but I plan on making her birthday cake and the ones here on in.    It's something my parents always did from me, and I'm talking about full out crazy cakes like big bird, mickey mouse, barbie cakes and so on I never had a repeat cake lol|`|K4vGNPZoaa	I just bought an ice cream cake from Carvel. She didn't have a party, just my family at my mom's house for dinner.|`|BHgtqH9Yaa	My daughters was bought, it was a dora cake. It was a dora theme party.|`|sL3i1INXaa	I bought it. I bought little tonka trucks (dump truck, bulldozer, etc.) to put on it and the cake decorator made hills and piles of dirt using icing and chocolate cookie crumbs. I didn't want a character cake and this one turned out really cute.|`|8a5c549ea7fffbe40a9a737812632ec8aa	i will be making my grandmother's hot milk cake. it's one of our family favorites. we're going to have a garden party theme and i'm going to use a sunflower cake mold. i'm not going to do frosting--just a dusting of confectionary sugar because that's all the cake really needs. it's delicious on its own, and also because i don't want my baby girl having too much sugar all at once (i know, buzzkill mommy!).|`|62ed2c415d781a32b672aaa388d79f43aa	im a cake decorator by trade so of course ill be making my daughters 1st and proberly the next 30 birthday cake's   lol|`|XN30YgK8aa	My sons birthday was go diego go and I bought his cake from Publix. We also had it at chuckee cheese.|`|0qP8gLpyaa	I made it. It was a train station and around it I put cupcake size train cars on a licorice lace track.  It was adorable.    This year I will make his cake again and it will be a 3D fire engine.|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	We bought it from A&P Supermarket and it was a Dora Cake. Her party was Dora themed.|`|rjVALevtaa	On my older son's first b-day we had a coupon for a free cake from Von's. It was a pretty basic cake with balloons and his name on it. If we hadn't had the coupon, I probably would have made it myself.    It was pretty funny watching him eat it though. He devoured his piece in about 10 minutes, then he stole the cake of the person sitting next to him and started eating that too!     First birthdays are so fun. :)
kPl8TTzNaa	It is ok. I much prefer Adelaide or Adelheid. Adlie is my newest favorite. Adeline, Adele, and Adella are all lovely as well. As long as they are feminine, I like most Ad names. However, I dislike Addison and Adrien / Adrienne, both which are masculine.|`|HXfHkoSHaa	I like it.  I also like Adelaide.  Not on your list, but I really like Adelida.  It is an awesome George Strait song.|`|TX9igTWraa	i don't like them! sorry :(|`|9wS0LxjLaa	Big Love :):)|`|PzrVrlW4aa	In general, Im not that crazy about "Ad" names. Just being honest though. Good Luck! =)|`|BQsVPV9Yaa	I LOVE IT!!! I would call her Addie!|`|nrQhVcy7aa	pretty|`|STLATMAUaa	i like them..but it seems like they are getting kinda popular..    i lovelovelove addalyn though :) hope you like it too :)|`|jCC5BRbLaa	I think they're very pretty and sophisticated. But not sophisticated in a bad way. I like all of the names, but I'd have to say my personal favorite is Adelaine, then Adella second. They're different and unique, but still pretty. Adele reminds me too much of the singer, she's not bad, but I just perfer the other names.|`|Yy4RCOnVaa	I love Adeline or Adele! or Adelina!|`|RnKFuUGPaa	Adeline... so much better than my name.. xD|`|7drjpohUaa	I love them! And Adelaine is such a beautiful name. A also like Adalyn and Ada. I love "Ad" names because nicknames could be Addie!|`|Hco3gULiaa	Adelaine is a beautiful name.  My mother was "Adelina", so any form of that name is wonderful to me.|`|yznZqcznaa	I love Adelaide and that was a name I had picked for my little girl if I have a girl.
MsipL0Mzaa	i would say warm bathe...when your pregnant your not suppose to take real hot bathes,ask dr ...or getting back on all 4s and rocking ....only thing that works for me!!|`|AA11304279	I took hot baths as hot as you can stand it. This relaxes your muscles and bones and it also relaxes the baby to where he/she isn't such dead weight on those areas. when in bed sleep with a pillow in between your legs at the knees to the point that your body is totally straight and in line when you are laying down instead of your hips and legs being lower. hope that one makes sense  have other half massage them   and most of all have the baby its just part of your body getting ready for the baby. everythign is trying to accomdate the size of the baby to come down.|`|Iuy1eWyhaa	I had the same problem when i was pregnant. I couldn't lay on my back cause id get short of breath, and when i laid on my side, i would have to flip over every 10 mins. cause my hips would hurt too much. Combine that with having to pee every 15 mins and you wont get a good nights sleep until... atleast a few years down the road! (lol)    Maybe you could try sitting on a stability ball (exercise ball). they are soft and movable, and rocking side to side and back and forth might give you a bit of a stretch and help feel a little better!    but dont fret, your almost there!!! best of luck!!!|`|c20207b79edb6a1d68e27d7750bd7d9caa	have the baby.....    that's the only way you are going to have some relief....    so you are going to just have to wait it out, you don't have much longer!!!|`|eiFQ0mHCaa	A bath - if it's OK wtih your Doctor.|`|oaF2kaXAaa	If you have an excerise ball- I'd suggest rolling on that for awhile.. and stretching your legs out... also the dog position stretch- hands and knees on the floor and lift your legs up to the sides and back... it helps the hips stretch.. Just work with your body and move yourself around to what feels right... best of luck to you!
iYAmPsQsaa	It is good at first for them to eat every three hours, and the schedule just helps you to see when the baby needs to eat again because at first the docs say they do need to eat every three hours- the schedule just helps YOU. You don't have to do that and yes sometimes they get sleepy early or later and things- no need to worry! I was the same way at first. Just stick to your schedule and as time passes, you will begin to see and know when your baby needs more or less sleep or food. Just keep it every three hours and they really do end up staying on the schedule really well because if you do not have them on one, it gets pretty stressful to just wonder if they are hungry or not becaue just like us grown-ups- if  we did not go to bed at a normal time each night and just slept whenever, we would never know a good time to sleep, we would be off all of the time and all haywire. But if you go to bed the same time and eat the same time your body kind of begins to fit into that and works very well that way, and as a mom, you will be alot happier if you just get him/her into a good schedule. Trust me! By the time you get the schedule down, you will begin to know your baby alot better on when they are hungry- you can put a bottle to their mouth, and if they take really fast, they are still hungry, if they barely nip around at it, well, you kind of get my point. Just don't worry you will be fine- good mothers like us always worry too much.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	My kids are pretty normal every day. They usually get up around 7-8 then we eat breakfast, they help me clean the kitchen then we get ready for the day. We then play for a while doing various activities and have lunch about noon then the younger one goes down for a nap and me and the older one have our own time together. When he waked up we do any errands that need to be done. I do some cleaning or laundry while they play then I make dinner. My youngest one is only two months old and has a bottle about every 4-5 hours. If she gets hungry before then then I feed her. If they get tired before nap time then I let them sleep. Their bodies know what they need so I'm not going to stop that.|`|6jECbxIeaa	We say that because we find a daily pattern in our kids i.e. my 7 month old son has dinner at 6, and he always naps at 1:30...you kinda notice a pattern....you know when they are tired and hungry..|`|XN30YgK8aa	My son was on a schedule at a very early age. He had times he ate, times he napped and  of course a bed time. A schedule is very hard to have when you have a baby but in the end it makes life easier as they get older. My son now works like clock work.
Svgru3Tnaa	Ahhh, Im so sorry! I have two little girls of my own (4 & 2 yrs old) and I had the same problems. The bleeding is usually due to the soreness of the infected area. I know she is very uncomfotable, but there isnt much you can really do.     I took this from a site:  http://ezinearticles.com/?Dont-Confuse-Y...      Anti-fungal medications are the only types of medicine that can get rid of yeast infections. Some pediatricians might write a prescription for Nystatin while others may recommend and over the counter medicine like Lotrim AF to treat the diaper yeast infection.    Using antifungal cream, soaking the baby in warm water two times a day and frequent diaper changes will usually clear up a yeast infection within a few days. While you are treating the yeast infection make sure that your babys diapers are loose enough to let air in. When changing your childs diapers, make sure the skin on his buttocks and groin area is clean and dry.    Some holistic medical practitioners advocate the use of a diaper cream containing tea tree oil to help clear yeast infections in the diaper area. Others recommend using aloe or pressing damp chamomile teabags directly on the babys rash. If the yeast persists for more than a week or if your baby has fever or chills you should consult with your pediatrician.    Best wishes and good luck!|`|2932ee4950edd4f131a711d029cc8528aa	Apple cider vinegar in the bath (1-2 cups into an infant tub). Soak for as long as your LO will sit in the tub. Then when she gets out put calendula cream over it. Repeat daily (or even 2x daily). It should be gone within 2 days... 3 days max.  It was the only thing that helped the little girl I nannied for. Even the prescription creams didn't help as much as the vinegar baths.|`|tOdjjeAmaa	Until you get a prescription from the doctor, DO NOT use over the counter meds for yeast infection! I had this problem with my daughter when she was about 12 months. It was horrible. The prescription stuff is gentle enough for your baby and won't harm her. I had read in a million places online to get Clotrimazole (for athlete's foot) from the drug store and use that. But then I read somewhere else that it has a very strong steroid in it that is NOT good, especially on little lady parts!! I almost had a cow!  I was so scared that I had harmed my baby. I took her to the doctor and used the ointment I was prescribed on her and it went away much quicker. Nystatin, I think it was called. For now, give her a bath and put Vaseline on there or let her run naked and air it out, but no OTC anti-fungals!|`|kbdkOPHDaa	poor hannah!    anyways, i would def. put some vaseline on it.  vaseline seriously makes everything feel a little better i love that stuff. my daughter is almost 3 and shes never had a yeast infection but i would start feeding her some yogurt more often or something i heard that helps that sorta stuff... and just give her medicine the last dose and then when you talk to doc tell them it didnt help. but for now use vaseline!|`|Z1atdG4kaa	babycenter.com is great for conceiving, pregnancy, infants, and toddlers. I'm on there almost everyday. Check there.|`|1a03fd470e002c088b333c229350271faa	I wish I could be of more help, but as for the cause of the bleeding, could she be so itchy from the yeast infection that she has scratched so much it's made her bleed? Maybe keep an eye to make sure she is not doing that, and I agree with a lukewarm bath and vaseline, that should provide some temporary relief for her. Good luck!|`|dTLTNZTzaa	For the burned spots:  Try using tea of camomile's flowers. 2 tbs of flowers on 1/2 cup of boiling water. Let it stay for 1 hour, after drain it and use as a wash for the gentle baby spots (apply warm with cotton ball ). Let it air dry. It helps when skin is irritated. Do not use any creams or oils as well as powder. Try doing it with each diaper change. Should help.  As for yeast infection - please wait for the doctor to contact you - it needs attention of professional.  Good luck|`|KQU5y20waa	wow.....what a question.  i am a daycare provider. and have had a girl since she was 6 weeks old. she is now 15 months old. about 3 monthes ago she started what looked like a diaper rash. but she was trated for a child yeast infection. then she was told that taking baths is what was doing it. but everything that she did, did not work. it keeped getting worse with every diaper change. she had everything that you have said. i told her that she should take her to a dermatoligist. she did. and she finally prescribed the best medicine ever. .... with a diognosis. she was severly elergic to the diapers..... no matter what brand she used. so now we have to put this cream on her at evey diaper change. for one week. then off one week. we have to do this cause if we use it continually, it can scare her down there. i hope this helps you.....let us know.....good luck.|`|EYSl68csaa	You can bathe her in warm water it will soothe her do not use soap let her run around naked especially if your in a place where she can get some air outside it's not to cold, I would say if she's out of meds get some over the counter cream and just keep her as clean and dry as possible.    Good Luck!|`|PWVYYh2Haa	my daughter had a yeast infection when she was a toddler and the doctor said giving her yogurt is a natural remedy because of the live cultures in it, as well as cottage cheese. if she is bleeding and running in the nude , she may get more of an infection from sitting on the floor or the couch or air borne bacteria. I would have her at least wear some panties, just lay a towel under where she seats in case of an accident, and try some neosporin the kind with the pain reliever, to help with the healing.|`|47R03TbFaa	MOMMY SORRY TO HEAR YOU LITTLE ONE IS HURTING.BUT CALL THIS 800   AND SEE IF THEY CAN SEND YOU A FREE SAMPLE ITS CALLED CRITIC AID*SKIN PASTE  1-800-533-0464  THIS STUFF REALLY WORKS HOSPITALS USE IT IN THERE NICUS  ON NEW BORN'S WHO HAVE SERIOUS RASHES  THIS STUFF I WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANY PARENT WANTING HELP WITH A REALLY BAD RASH|`|reO9Dgmsaa	Here is the link!  :)  Poor honey; that sounds so painful!  http://www.drjaygordon.com/development/b...      **Aww Hannah's Mommy I'm glad I could help!!|`|oaF2kaXAaa	awww.... poor baby.. I wouldnt want to put anything on her to further irratate her skin... maybe a luke warm bath..... pat dry... maybe vaseline to coat the skin from urine and whatnot... best of luck to you two...    Add: on babycenter.com I was reading about yeast infections:  As you may have noticed, diaper creams won't help cure a yeast infection. What your child needs is a topical anti-yeast or antifungal cream such as nystatin, clotrimazole, or miconazole . Some are available without a prescription at the drugstore. Use one as directed on the label; the rash should take only a few days to clear up.|`|XN30YgK8aa	sounds like an allergic reacyion to the prescription. i wouldnt wait for the dr but go to the er. it could worsen|`|VZdRV78Kaa	My 10 month old daughter recently got a bad yeast infection from being on antibiotics and it was painful for her (I was crying too to see her like that)..The RN who returned my call suggested a lukewarm bath with baking soda in it (it did soothe her)..she also suggested soaking cotton balls with Mylanta/Maalox and applying it to her bottom (some ingredient in that soothes)...When you do take her to be seen or you get to talk to her doctor ask him/her for a prescription anti-yeast medication call "Vusion". It's a combo of Nystatin (a yeast medication) and Zinc Oxide (the stuff in Desitin) so it provides protection as well as treatment. The only thing is that the "Vusion" cream is only available as a band name medication so it will be more expensive but it really works well...you just apply it like you would your normal diaper cream. I saw a big difference after just a couple of days.I hope this helps. Good luck.|`|KICQQxLxaa	Agh...I will not let me post a link!!  Look back through my questions...I asked about a similar thing, and got good tips and advice w/ websites.    The apple cider vinegar baths really helped, along with the grapefruit seed extract.  I use the GSE now at every diaper change (I keep in diluted with water in a small spray bottle) and she hasn't had one since.    Good luck...I know it is tough watching her in pain!!    ETA:  Here is the answer from Mrs. Ferrai (a TC here)  If you don't want to use the OTC creams (which are effective), you can give her shallow baths with some apple cider vinegar thrown in. The plain yogurt on the diaper area is effective, and you should also try to get her to eat some (steer clear of the sugary "fruit" yogurts, since yeast thrives on sugar). Also you can offer her some acidophilus (put it in her food or simply empty a capsule into her mouth) to combat the bad bacteria. If you buy Grapefruit Seed Extract in liquid form, dilute it with water and spray on the diaper area! I used GSE for my nipple thrush, and it's a miracle worker.    I can't get the website to show up though...|`|4e67Pdfvaa	tripple paste is good for yeast rashes, and have her naked for time in between diapers.. she needs air and NO moisture.  YOu can also apply a few drops of tea tree oil.
vOomJtbsaa	Hmm my breasts are usually sore around PMS time but not bigger, that could very possibly be a pregnancy thing!  I'm throwing baby dust your way!  Yay for more babies :)|`|fa0dd5777a3c1d7f167867babbfebd0baa	Mine did every time before I got my period and when I was pregnant. It's kind of hard to tell as it can be both. Also it depends on the person. Good luck though and I hope you get your BFP if that is what you want =)|`|O7nyzkGdaa	i never noticed bigger but more painful yes. When i got pregnant i remember thinking that they hurt so bad, but i thought it was just really bad PMSing, but no it was definately caused by a baby. But every woman is different. I wish u the best|`|jYPeis3Saa	before i had my son, my PMS symptoms included very tender and swollen breasts.   but since ive had him, 15 moths ago, i dont get that anymore. so weird.     anyway, yes pms symptoms and early pregnancy symptoms are a like, so if you htink your pregnant then take a test!|`|PwhrTNZraa	I used to notice when i was TTC to conceive that every month as PMS my boobs would get sore and start to feel heavy and full....they never got bigger, just felt that way.  Usually they started to get sore RIGHT after ovulation and it would end the very day AF started.  The month I did get pregnant, they weren't sore right after ovulation -- it didn't start until about 8dpo so I knew something was different.|`|8c4kRTnPaa	yep right before I start my period my boobs are bigger, heavier and sore so it was hard to tell if I was pregnant or just pmsing. I did notice that my areolas (area around your nipple) got bigger and darker and my nipples grew.|`|MslcyESfaa	When I PMS my boobs get a little bigger, but they get sore too.
3untsNTlaa	I think that you should keep the baby.  Please don't get an abortion.  That is so cruel. I don't understand how anyone can be so cruel and do such a thing. You just have to take one day at a time and don't have so many negative thoughts in your head, that is not going to make things any better. I really think you should just tell your parents before they find out by someone else or if they find out on their own. There are many facilities that help with pregnant teens and they also help with teen parents. Some places will give you free formula for your baby and free diapers as well. You could also apply for food stamps to help with food sources. There are also some places that are meant just for teen parents that are struggling and need help, those places can also provide free daycare services for your baby. As a last resort, I would suggest that you put the baby up for adoption, Its a lot better than Abortion. I really hope my answer helps you and I hope you can get through this.    I will keep you in my prayers.  God Bless.|`|buCcqA5Vaa	Oh man I'm so putting daughter on birthcontrol when she's a teen! Wow that sucks! I want a baby! Damn bless you!|`|3cea97f9abc80ff593bdb3828a3f1adfaa	What can anyone tell you to do?  Someone could give you the best advice in the world but what good would it do?  Obviously you won't listen if you can't even learn from your own mistakes.  I just hope for the sake of that poor child that you give it a chance at a good life and give it up for adoption.|`|tsdDMCDCaa	get a job after school and pray for a healthy baby. dont kill the baby|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Well, first of all you need to suck it up and tell your parents. It's probably not going to be very pleasant. There's really no way to sugar coat it. Also, why in the world weren't you on birth control if this has already happened to you before?|`|jNgh3e3Faa	I got pregnant at 15 and did not have sex again until I was 18.   Why would you have sex, much less unprotected sex again?  Tell them now. You can give up your baby for adoption.   Your parents needed to put you on birth control. Why did they not?  After I had mine I was GIVEN birth control. Even though I told them I had no plans to have sex. I accepted it. It was not used or needed.   Why?  You should be focused on caring for the one you have and getting as much work as you can. Babysitting and such if you have to.   Life is hard enough without throwing in sex.   Get tested for STDs, too.|`|o1yy6KABaa	*sigh*     tell your parents, unless you have a termination there is no way they are not going to find out!|`|xIF2lShpaa	What were you thinking!! You are so young!! You are still a baby yourself !! You really shouldn't have been having sex at all !! I was sixteen when I had my first daughter and it was so hard, that I didn't have sex again, because I was so scared that I was going to get pregnant again. Well, it did happen, and you need to own up to the responsibility, and tell your parents. It is going to be really hard, but you can do it. Next time, just try to be more careful.|`|dSpLfZFnaa	I don't know what you should but you have already done what you shouldn't do.|`|WkaWSKNAaa	If you are not equipped to have a baby then stop having sex!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|KGT1B0Elaa	U poor dear... Life is funny.. here i am TCC but havent been blessed with such yet... and there is u...    have u considered adoption? i noe it is not the best solution, but each child deserves a fair chance to achieve their best possibilities in the future.|`|u6K7atx7aa	Honestly, it sounds like you can't even take care of the child you have right now. I would say either look into an abortion or adoption depending on your personal belief system. If your parents are having a hard time with just the one grandchild, think about what another one would do. Also, do you think they would support you if you had another?|`|rJ7QfQ0Raa	oh boy, i would just blurt it out and tell them, they'll find out anyways|`|915705d92192ca14561aef0c15a747e6aa	Wow, that would suck. maybe u should have been on birth control.

QBOtYUGyaa	I don't think it would hurt to tell her how you feel. The flip side is that if you don't, you'll regret it an wish you had. I guess the only thing to stop you would be fear of her reacting badly.     That's life though. Hopefully she's open enough to understand, and even if she isn't interested in you like that, she'd still value your friendship.     Maybe you should hang out with her again and just see how it goes. Read into her a little bit, and every time you think you see something, give a little something back. I hope it works out for you!|`|kRaVa0Wraa	wait, is she bi/lesbian?  if shes not, dont tell her how you feel. it will freak her out.   if she is, i would tell her how you feel

I do prefer swaddlers though.  I feel like they are much softer for my baby.|`|qxnZXOVFaa	i used swaddlers since my babies were born and i LOVED them!  but the biggest size they come in is a 2-3.  my girls wear a three now so i just get the pampers baby dry.  they seem to be working well for them as far as leakage.  we've had no leaks from wet diapers and only a couple blow outs up the back with dirty diapers!  but i really think that the mesh netting in the swaddlers helped a lot with keeping the wetness away from the skin because since i've switched, my girls have had a couple diaper rashes and they have never had one before.  i hate to buy a whole new package of diapers if they aren't good, but if my girls keep getting this diaper rash i'll have to find another diaper.  my girls skin is sensitive, though.  other than that, it is a good diaper.|`|2932ee4950edd4f131a711d029cc8528aa	I used the swaddlers til my son didn't fit anymore. They were just so soft in comparison. But the baby dry worked just as well as for leaking. Though my son now gets rashes on his legs where the "elastic" is from the baby dry. we switched to huggies natural fit and all it well again.|`|oaF2kaXAaa	I loved pampers... too expensive for me... I found that the target store brand is actually quite similar- just the knock-off brand of pampers.|`|VudhjHi2aa	Love swaddlers. Never tried Pamper. Oh And I liked the Huges natural fit.|`|fC1HUgAAaa	The swaddlers only go up to size 2 and then it's either Cruisers or Baby Dry. I personally prefer the Baby Dry because, they are more flexible, more absorbant and I haven't had any leaking problems.     With the cruisers They leaked and fell apart. My daughter woke up with little jelly pee balls on her face one morning because the diaper ripped to shreds in her sleep pretty much.     Anyway, Baby Dry is my first choice in diapers, I bought the swaddlers as long as I could because they are super soft but now I can't because my duaghter is in size 3.|`|PWVYYh2Haa	honestly i preffered huggies, they were a bit cheaper and i had no leaks with them, and my kids used to get red if i used pampers or luvs.|`|AwvWBROlaa	swaddlers only go upto size 2 1/2 which its 2-3 printed on the package. when i needed size 3 i went to cruiser but it was soo stiiff but very good quality diaper. nothing like  the swaddlers. its more like the brand huggies in my opinion. then i went to baby dry and i LOVE IT! its more like the swaddlers and it fits my chubby baby better. I have not leaked and over all pampers are very good brand.|`|sAhAEC2qaa	they are fine they do the job the same as swaddlers|`|1IDSGM71aa	I HATE them. The only diapers that work for my daughter are Target brand, Parent's Choice (one of Wal Mart's brands) and Pampers Swaddlers Sensitive, sometimes. They worked great for her til she got to a size 2. I hate Huggies, too. The Baby Dry ones kept her wet and she kind of got a diaper rash, even if we would change her like every hour or more. We also had leaks with them.|`|w7FSmSTnaa	swaddler are made by papmers with that being said ive tried many diapers and pamers are the best. all tho i like crusers better than baby dry just because the seem to fit better once the baby starts moving more. i have 3 kids and have used crusers for the past 5 years and love them|`|XN30YgK8aa	I tried all brands of diapers with my son (I made the huge jump to cloth long ago, after much trail and error with disposables) and I was always the happiest with pampers baby dry's. They always worked, never leaked and the tabs were never flimsy. I couldn't use swaddlers on my son because they have that net lining (same as cruisers, couldn't use them). I preferred huggies natural fit over all of them but you can't purchase them in bulk at BJ's or Costco. I loved the baby dry and I am sure you will too.
bSZK2tVtaa	Well i've heard that pre-*** can get you pregnant i just wait it out hunni if your period never shows then i would take a test. But DON'T STRESS YOURSELF OUT! Because stressing can just delay your period and make it not come so try to stay stress free.     If the test are negatives then i would take another one and if is neg too then i would think your not pregnant! = )     Good luck darling.   Sara-|`|7YU9IreXaa	There is a one in five chance you are pregnant.  but you probably are...  dumb *****|`|U3A3m6elaa	Oh, Bummer.|`|eA93MJj4aa	there is a chance that you can get pregnant; now if you are regular and you are 4 days away from getting your period then most likely you are not pregnant.  But everybody is different; don't believe in the rhythm method .. :)|`|3I3bdjAsaa	Oops!|`|rUQAGz9kaa	your chances of being pregnant are pretty high . especailly since its more risky to have sex the week before your period than during it . Your period is how your body gets rid of the egg.|`|91b27b540655ebe4e66c72274b49dd33aa	slim do not worry|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You are most likely ok. If this happened within the last 72 hours you can always go and get the Plan B morning after pill to make yourself feel a little more protected. If you have a normal cycle and ovulate at a normal time though you would have ovulated last week which would mean you can't get pregnant.|`|uOp2sdiQaa	i don't know what the chances are, but its still a chance, and the only way to find out for sure is if you missed your period, and took a test.|`|HT1Jb7zOaa	it hard to tell weather you going to fall pregnant or not everyone is different go to the doctor and get the morning after pill just to make sure because there is pre *** and depends on how firtile he and you are better to be safe than soory       Hope that helped|`|BepzNmowaa	I dont think that you would be pregnate.  but their is a possibility  As long as he did not ejaculate inside you.  also the time you can get prego the most is 2 weeks after your period so you shold be safe
AA11779376	You should be fine if didn't finish in you or the condom before it broke. But the best way to tell is to test. You just need to remember not to freak out and over stress if your waiting for your period. because it can delay it. Good luck!        I disagree with whoever said plan b isn't an abortion. It doesn't prevent a pregnancy, it cancels it. The cycle of life has already started so I would count it. Prevention would be birth control.|`|KHyPqJviaa	yes you should be concerned even though he didn't ejaculate there may be pre *** inside the chamber and even if you get your period you still should get a test|`|cmdAsz2iaa	Let's be honest.... if you think for a second that you could be pregnant and you don't want to be...... then plan B is the right choice. (I understand you said not to mention it) but it's not that expensive and you should just get it. It's the best way. You can for sure be pregnant even if he didn't ejaculate. There's no percentage of chance here... it just could happen.       Those things are good swimmers i'm telling ya. Go with plan b|`|i5cApRkgaa	You should be fine something simaler happened to me and i thought i was pregnant but i was just over worried about it and stressed forever the best thing you can do is take a test, make the guy who did it buy one good luck      answer mine back just search  I  HAVE A HUGE BOY CRISIS!!! can someone help please?|`|savPsYWjaa	Falcon Punch|`|yDWcYXl5aa	You very well could become pregnant without proper protection.    I wonder why you won't consider the plan-B?  It isn't an abortion pill, it's a pill that prevents pregnancy from beginning.  It won't affect your ability to get on birth control, and it's available over the counter at most pharmacies.|`|dMZEnWPnaa	take the pill|`|KAiHiHkGaa	If you refuse to get Plan B there is nothing that you can do for yourself other than wait it out.  You could be pregnant.|`|gkJZITkuaa	well if there was like alot of spern in the condom then theres a chance u might be pregnant but it depends on how long u were at it
zGXbaHOBaa	Hey, hun.  My then-boyfriend left me when I was a month preggo. I was very emotional and so stressed out. I lost weight in that first month without him, actually. I was too sick from crying my eyes out that I didn't really eat--I didn't want to.  I did get over it, but never really got over him-I still wished to be with him.  Luckily, and this probably doesn't happen often, he realized what a jerk he had been and realized he still loved me. We got back together when I was 6months along. We actually got married three months after our son was born, too.  There's still hope, but don't dwell on it. Make sure his parents know that you're going to keep the baby (they'll probably want to know their grandson). I hope you'll still keep the baby, although when my then-boyfriend left me, I considered abortion (for about 2seconds) and later considered adopting my son out because I wasn't really able to take care of him financially.  Talk to your parents and his parents to see how they feel. They shouldn't be left in the dark--they deserve to know about the grandbaby that is coming, if you haven't told them yet. Grandbabies are very important.  Family and friends are real important right now; don't stress too much about that idiot of a male.  Take care of yourself and your baby.|`|Bu6eSZSlaa	Well in my case the prick didn't return. When I was pregnant with my 1st daughter I found out when I was 3 mths & told the clown & that was the end of that he hightailed it outta there like a dog with his tail stuck between his legs. 10 yrs lata his butt hasn't found his way to my address but we're both still standing & today I have a wonderful fiance of 11 yrs who has been by my side before my daughter was born & whom she calls daddy.....his lost|`|Gr78AFvyaa	you don't NEED a man to help you raise a baby. sure it makes it easier, but there are so so many resources out there to help you do it on your own! just be strong and if he wants to be a part of your life let him but don't depend on him.|`|KGT1B0Elaa	Gosh.. u had just made me wonder abt ur current situation.. so much underlying mesaages u r giving...    I do hope u'll be ok... stress is not good for the baby in u...|`|pcjLTnwTaa	A friend of mine left her abusive bf while pregnant with his baby. But now that the baby is born the father is not being very nice to her and she still is getting a lot of trouble from him coz he wants to see the baby, but she wont let him see it. She wants to get a court order against him. She has a lot of support from her parents so still coping well without the father.|`|MslcyESfaa	I have a friend whose baby dad left when she was 6 months pg. The baby is fine and well adjusted and she is now in  relationship with someone else. She calls him her sperm donor.    Bottom line: If he left than he is not ready or mature enough to be a father. But all babies need is love and I am sure you will be fine. Things happen for a reason.    Good luck to you and a happy and healthy 9 months! :)|`|9vy2FTfkaa	Hun,     My situation is a lot worse. My bf was living with me and couldn't stand my dad so he left. 3 days after I found out I was pregnant. I think God helped me to find him that day to give him the news. I didn't know where he was or what he was doing. 2 days later he called me yelling at me about my dad. I asked him if he loved me he said 'of course i do you are carrying my baby'. No worries right? WRONG! I asked him if he was cheating on me. he said 'i swear on the baby inside your stomach' LIAR!! A few days ago I found him on myspace with CURRENT pics of him and a girl he just met. He still lied to me and swore on my baby which is not right to me. He didn't think I'd find his page so he thought he could get away with it. Now he wants to change and get a place for me and him. and all this other crap i don't believe. Just don't stress over this. MANY MANY WOMEN OUT THERE HAVE BEEN THRU WORSE AND THEY ARE PROUD SINGLE PARENTS TODAY. I KNOW I WILL BE SOON.
IXBl5l5kaa	Shots will usually cause additional sleepiness. All the shots my daughter has had thus far have caused a day of a lot of sleep. She has had up tp 6 months shots and going for 9 month shots soon.    When she started teething at 6 months her sleeping patterns totally changed. This week she is in a pretty bad way with a couple new ones getting ready to pop in and her sleeping has been hit and miss. I remember last week, though, she was taking 3 hour naps straight which was totally unexpected.|`|YS47Ci4paa	That could be why. Maybe you should try to put him to bed earlier like around 9pm.
rjVALevtaa	You put one seat on each side of the backseat of the car. I don't have twins but I had two boys (ages 4 and 5 months) who are both in carseats. Technically, the middle of the backseat is where the carseat is supposed to go, but it doesn't always work out that way!|`|jYPeis3Saa	i dont have twins, but im assuming you would put a carseat behind the driver seat and a car seat behind the passanger seats.  just like if you had 2 kids of different ages.  ive never heard of only being allowed 1 carseat per car. how strange.|`|f98ecf3f5dd8f9c4fb1b97facf100a2aaa	You put one behind the drivers seat and the other behind the passenger seat.  I haven't heard the one capsule rule before, anyway it's not true!|`|bf2b826fb186efa4963970654d24ac34aa	Never heard that rule. You put two car seats in. If there were truth to that then people with high order multiples would have serious problems.
Vh5DrXvOaa	Yes but I would use as little of juice as possible so he will get all the medication..You can also mixed it with a little applesauce or any kind of baby food he might eat. They also have those pacifier medication dosers if you think he might us that....I got a pacifier baby.|`|rjVALevtaa	I just asked my doctor about this today actually. She said it isn't really a good idea since if he doesn't finish the drink he won't get all of the medicine. But I guess if he finishes his drink in a relatively short period of time it's not a big deal.|`|fpt2rOYpaa	I would use very little juice if you want to go about doing it that way.
zbjaBgyEaa	No, my tastes have definately changed.  When I was in middle school I was determined that I'd name my daughter Amber Skye.  I thought it was soo cute.  And I liked Crystal, Gemma, Tiffany.  I thought they were pretty.  I don't like any of those names anymore - especially Amber Skye.    I think often the names change with the trends (90s names like Tiffany have been replaced with 2000s names like Serenity, Trinity and Neveah).  But more often they change as you mature.  I find that women who are really young tend to chose trendier names while women who are slightly older tend to chose names that are more classic.    I really love the names you're considering and I especially love the name Evelyn - it's gorgeous.|`|DdjpQr0Gaa	I had my first daughter in 1998.  her name is Alannah Lynaeld pro  Alannah was just a name I liked and Lynae (lynn-a) is a combo of some family members names.  It was 5 years before I had my son and I named him Connor Warren.  Warren is my grandfathers name and Connor was a name my husband got off the Highlander movie.  I still like those names but I think Connor is way to common now and I would probly not have used it today.  I was going to named my daughter Lance if she were a boy and I wouldn't do that either.  I had my third child in May of 2008.  Her name is Brylan Faith.  Brylan is after my husband, his name is Brian.  and Faith becuase I was going through some tough times when I found out I was pregnant and it took alot of Faith for me to keep it together.  I thank god for her every day.  I am 32 years old now as well and I definately think my tastes have changed.  I love the names you have chosen for the new baby.  Naming them after someone is always special.  I wish the best to you and your family|`|44OH7Si6aa	Nope, we tried picking out names for each before they were conceived and always ended up hating it a couple months into the pregnancy and picking out a different one|`|E70A7aqcaa	I was 32 when our first child was born, and 34 when our second one was born, and my wife and I picked more of what might be called classical names, not anything "popular" but ones that have been around for eons, and didn't necessarily stand out among names.  We figured we'd raise our kids to "stand out" a bit, hopefully in a positive, classical sense.  Well, we got the names right, anyway. :-)) !!  They're 24 and 23 now, and I sure do love 'em, regardless of their "station in life".  God Bless you.|`|Elxuvon8aa	we chose to use our middle name for the first child's middle name   when  2 came along we never even considered it 8 1/2 years later   3 was not named until she was 5 days old the name we chose did|`|syrh8J6Vaa	I am 30 now and funny enough ten years ago I was pregnant with my son. He is named Thomas Moore after his father and grandfather.  If he was to be a girl her name would have been Madison Rose.  I have loved then name since high school.  When I was pregnant with my second her name was going to be Madison Rose up until the day she was born.  She just didn't look like a Madison to me so she became Karli Michelle.  If I were to have another daughter Madison would still be on the list.  I really don't care how popular a name becomes because what is unique today may become popular tomorrow.  I go for what I like and screw everyone else.  So I have added a couple of names but my taste really hasn't changed.  For girls I like:  Madison Rose  Toni Danielle (anthony is my husbands dads name and I like it with an "i" for a girl)  or irelyn marie  Boys:  Jaxon Anthony ( I have loved Jaxon since steel magnolias came out )  Morgan Wyatt  or  Dylan Anthony    From your choices I like Emmett Doran &  Evelyn Genevieve|`|CMuL7XpKaa	no|`|ot0TqzSvaa	yes    i used to love Leon, Theo, Candy and Sugar :\    now i like Jett, James, Aili, and Isabel|`|1en1Jtp4aa	yeah I still like those victorian era names but I also enjoy the creativity of the more modern names like Emmerson, Ethan, Ney-Yo, Gwyneth, Denzel, etc.
76hNV3iqaa	No she can not get pregnant if she has not (for sure) had her period. I am very curious as to why a seven year old is having sex? If she isn't as was raped then you MUST report it. Now just because she doesn't have her period does not mean that she can not get an STD! Plus all it would take is for her to have unprotected sex and then start her periods, which means that she would be ovulating and then she could very well become pregnant. ANYTIME you have unprotected sex you can for sure get pregnant. I really am praying that this little child(think about it 2 years ago she was 5!!!!!... SICK) Is not having sex. If she is then you need to step up and tell her parents.This is something that can be very dangerous and she could end up getting very hurt (by some older guy) plus her body is in no way ready to have sex, so it can effect her growth. PLEASE DO THE RIGHT THING and tell her parents.  God Bless  PS. I am really praying that you are not the 7 year old, and even worse that you are wanting to fool around with a 7 year old! If that is the case then you need help(whether you are 7 or you are wanting to be with a 7 year old sexually!)|`|RAgWVuu4aa	It IS possible, but HIGHLY unlikely...She would have to be getting her period very soon...But, like I said, that is very, very, very unlikely to happen...There would have to be an egg in her uterus, which means she would be starting her period very soon.    If that were to happen, the seven-year-old would most likely have some sort of hormone disorder...    The youngest recorded person to get pregnant was five when she conceived and six when she gave birth (cesarean section). But that's because she had a really rare hormone disorder that caused her body to develop quickly, and she got her period when she was eight months old...|`|Qc3bu3ioaa	no way! that waaaaaaay to young! u crazy!!! ahhh!|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	This is a very disturbing question.    A young lady CAN get pregnant before ever having menarche (the onset of menses).  The first period would follow ovulation, if conception did not occur.  It is unlikely-though not impossible-that a girl of that age would be ovulating and on the verge of menstruating yet.    Again, very disturbing.|`|pHIUUnOiaa	no its 10000000% impossible its like a old lady who has gone through menopause getting preggo no honestly its impossible    hey who gave me that thumbs down i am telling you the god dam truth gosh!    also what the hell is wrong with you and seven year old girls like honestly are you like a rapist or something all of your questions are about 7 year old girls and puberty perv|`|Qe9rXFm0aa	You all may want to read this weirdo's previous questions.        To the weirdo: The answer to your question is YES. Ovulation happens before the actually bleeding (sign of a period)|`|PAwqjxvaaa	If she has not had her period, she can not get pregnant. a 7 year old is not even nearly ready for sex. a 7 year old body can not handle sex, their bones are still too small, and can't handle it.    you can only get pregnant once you start having your period.|`|ZQ0dRFoTaa	Oh, oh I read sevenTEEN year old.|`|HcCYeLMAaa	yeah its definitely possible ! the youngest anyone has ever gotten pregnant was around 4 or 5 i think . & wth is a 7 year old doing have sex , not unless it was like rape or something , then it needs to be reported immediately !|`|k6XRVeJxaa	Nope.|`|mowvERi1aa	please tell me your not a 7 year old wanting to have sex    or you want to rape a 7 year old.|`|YWmyTXThaa	as far as i know it is a no because there is no egg to be fertilized  (:|`|S3t69kh2aa	The answer is yes.  Ovulation would occur two weeks before her first period.  If she had sex at that time it would be possible.  A very small percentage of women get their period when they are that young.|`|739d2c0f3a827ed66532c97b8757d73faa	Not honey|`|BYTPpcNZaa	no she cant|`|vjeRcy5Xaa	Course not. Your 7 for ****'s sake.|`|mvZTm2pjaa	im not sure, bc it is possible for a someone  (a girl,lady.woman w.e. ) to get pregnant without her period, but im not sure about a seven year old,     it is a def possilbe thoo.|`|lzviKPJWaa	the youngest mom in history was 5...google it.|`|PbPKSNlLaa	Its very unlikely to happen but yes a seven year old could get pregnant.  the baby would most likely have major issues because the girls only seven years old and her body isn't even developed but yes theirs a low low slim chance.      10 points please?|`|ATaePt5Xaa	The simple answer is yes.  only if she has ovulated. This, however is extremely - emphasis on the extremely - rare.|`|0K42KId5aa	If a woman *girl* has never had her period then no she can not get pregnant. Especially if she is only 7 years old. Most girls are around 10-13 years of age when they get their first menstrual cycle.|`|44OH7Si6aa	It would be possible, the youngest girl to ever give birth was a Peruvian girl who was only 5 years old named Lina Medina in 1939. Her parents brought her to a hospital because they though she had a tumor, a month later she delivered a baby boy via c-section. Here's the wikipedia link on it if you want to read about her   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lina_Medina|`|ekThx3AAaa	Obviously not.|`|QGkBZFqWaa	Negative.|`|WO68RZdIaa	Anyone have any good Troll repellent left? I'm out.|`|Bw18seFqaa	not likely.. but not impossible.    girls are maturing at younger ages, ovulating and starting periods.. part of this is because of the added hormones in food.    You dont need a period to get pregnant.. you only have to ovulate..  ovulation occours before your menstural cycle..  so if the child has ovulated, and her body is preparing for a menstural cycle, and she has sex while fertile.. yes, she could get pregnant.    I'd have to wonder why a 7 yr old is engaging in sexual activities tho?
le8qkjkSaa	absolutely nothing can induce your labor (other than true doctor administered drug, and even that doesnt always work) unless your body is already ready for labor. And no there is nothing that can prove pineapple aids labor at all.|`|k9nLue0Uaa	mmm pineapple lol|`|JsshzKM9aa	I don't know about that but I've been craving pineapple bad!|`|TX9igTWraa	no.. your baby will come out when it's ready.|`|O7nyzkGdaa	i saw this too and i have tried everything else to try to progress the dilating and effacing.

IA5zVfk0aa	i get sore from having sex, it is probably that, dont worry and sex can stop your period.. good luck :)|`|2I5D78Sbaa	you wouldnt get the symptoms that soon,  and sometimes your period will stop when you have intercourse..i know mine does.|`|gM0RMviAaa	it may be but i would wait a few weeks and take a test|`|oZVAWpwTaa	3 days is very early.  It is very possible that you are paranoid, but if your period was light you could still be pregnant, and that might have not been your period, its called implantation bleeding and you get that with pregnany!    Hope this helps, good luck hun:)
kPuls66caa	Yeah I came across this website just a few days ago and bought the ovulation test strips. Im still waiting for them but i noticed they had something to test sperm...give it a try and keep me updated, im curious to see if they work!    Good Luck and TONS of baby bust!
okgr5aPCaa	Ryan is a good name, its not bad at all and I cannot find any faults in it.  It is strong and masculine as well as neat for a little boy.      Allea is a nice and unique name.

The weird thing is i hate hamburgers, and i've been craving hamburgers all the time! lol|`|z7w6xyOKaa	I'm 17 weeks and I've been craving a bunch of sour candy and mozzarella cheese sticks. Not together though|`|mqHL4UcRaa	Congratulations. I bet your excited to have your ultrasound coming up soon!    I'm 25 weeks & I've been craving fruit & lots of sleep this week!!!

I have been craving BANANA'S my whole pregnancy I eat at least 4 a day honestly ..   It's weird because I didn't even like banana's before ..|`|X83LVP6Iaa	I am 38 weeks and ever since I got my appetite back from having severe morning sickness, my cravings change every couple weeks. Currently my cravings have been tangerines, red seedless grapes and oatmeal raisin cookies, but not all together.|`|WBv2vD4haa	Chocolate and also watermelon with yoghurt|`|ENzdDADpaa	Ice cubes i eat at least a few trays per day and i'm 32 weeks along!|`|AZSIoSNoaa	Turkey and Orange sandwiches, lol, and granola bars|`|7ZTlktMeaa	I crave SEX & SLEEP!!!

xIF2lShpaa	No there is no real way to confirm a pregnancy without a test, and even an at home test can not confirm the pregnancy. The best way to confirm it is to go to a doctor for a blood test. I had a pregnancy test say it was negative and I was 3 or 4 weeks pregnant. Sometimes they can not read the HCG levels if they are not high enough. If you are having a lot of pregnancy symptoms, then I would test at home and at a doctors office just to be sure. Good Luck !|`|8bRxXlmFaa	duhers! when you stop your period|`|ZHhXQ0ebaa	a doctor|`|AZSIoSNoaa	ummm, yea, wait about 4-5 months til you feel something move, or like some women go into the hospital er and get the suprise of a baby popping out!|`|7xQIDDQRaa	Stand on you head..  If you start speaking in spanish it means you are preggers..|`|Lc3POYy0aa	For christ shakes take a friggen test! they are like a dollar at dollar General|`|17wtWAreaa	no not until ur stomach gets bigger or u get morning sickness|`|buCcqA5Vaa	Testing would probably be the best way of knowing! I would just test if you want a result right away!|`|X83LVP6Iaa	Yes. For most a missed period or several missed periods, having many pregnancy symptoms, uterus gets bigger, and eventually you shoulld feel a baby moving around and then give birth. So yes, many ways to tell your pregnant without a test. Also an ultrasound.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	No. Not unless you want to wait so long that you get huge and can feel the baby moving around but that takes up to 5 or 6 months. Take a test. If you are you need good prenatal care.|`|tOdjjeAmaa	When your stomach gets larger and you feel a baby in there moving around, then you will know.|`|z7w6xyOKaa	Wait nine months and see if a baby pops out?|`|WxQFe0GYaa	An ultrasound.  Eventually, your belly will get big, and you'll feel a little being kicking around in there.  And then, later on, a baby will come out of your vagina.|`|ebM6CxRQaa	Wait until you never get a period and feel the baby moving... and your tummy gets big    are you younger and afraid to take a test or buy one? Well just buy it and take the test at the store... thats really the only way to know... or go to the doctors and get a blood test done
et3OzeiLaa	my son has this problem. the dr. gave me enulose the nurse said it is like adding more fiber to his diet, but if is just a every so often thing you can try glycerin suppositories they are quick and effective and harmless!!!|`|WjTzUCnnaa	My son is formula fed and was having problems with constipation. The doctor told us to add either prune juice or pear juice to his bottle.  The prune made his poo sticky and really smelly.  The pear juice works really well, were still trying to find a happy medium with the amount to give him though.|`|688c403afa0715767110cfa7a696a616aa	If he's having trouble pushing his dirt out, and he's not doing as often as he used to - as Jessica says, the suppositories are quick and harmless, almost guaranteed to make him do a smelly in a few minutes.|`|AhoB10CTaa	if i were you i'd call your pedi just to be careful. it could be any number of things and i wouldn't chance it since really no one on Y!A is really medically qualified to diagnose your baby w/ anything. it could be constipation, but it's better to be safe than sorry, right?|`|AA11625299	baby poop can be runny all the way up to harder like playdoh/peanut butter...its constipation when its in hard balls|`|46ddc6b6990fcd5b5d5e36dc7b533ccaaa	Has she had more formula in the last couple of days than normal? This can cause constipation especially if you are using the GOLD types of formula (eg S26 Gold) as these have extra nutirents and protiens that a baby gets from your breast milk which causes them to be consipated and get a belly ache!    Try her on a normal brand of formula instead of a gold type.    Your health centre nurse or pharmacy will help you pick the fomula that is best to use if u r breastfeeding as well|`|QQI4rliYaa	hmm. try pedi lite.might be bound up a little..not sure tho.|`|XN30YgK8aa	It could be the switching between breatmilk and formula. Some baby bellies can not handle the combination. It could also be the choice of formula. Before changing formulas always confirm it with your pedi but I would consider making a formula change. Sometimes babies do better on gentle formulas, especially when also being breastfed.|`|R62kIKIxaa	My son is 11 weeks old and he had the same problem. My pedi dr said it was probably cause by the iron in his formula and told me to put a table spoon of dark karo syrup in every other bottle and it would help loosen his stool. Within a couple of weeks his stool was back to normal and he was able to go to the bathroom with ease. If she is having problems burping I would try putting a teaspoon of baking soda in her formula but just a couple of bottles not all of them that should help her burp and get rid of any extra gas.
TQg7yubGaa	Yeah you need to take a test.  Yes you could very well be pregnant.|`|HoHHpwDlaa	Yeah, it's still possible to get pregnant while on your period. Please please please go get a pregnancy test or visit planned parenthood. I know, i know, the taboo "planned parenthood." But they cover up the sign in sheet so no one knows your name or information. Better safe than sorry.     Hope everything turns out okay. :]|`|bvt9kvS8aa	maybe...  go to a local store and get a pregnancy test.    good luck :)|`|hqSDVWuKaa	yes, those sound like the right symptoms.... use protection hun!!!! and i think bob s is out of answering!!! yeah!!! haha lol =]|`|QGkBZFqWaa	http://s123.photobucket.com/albums/o304/...|`|XhpLwjCuaa	I agree, take a test you never know for sure. if you are underage don't worry about who sees you buying a test its more important to know that to be embarrassed or just look up a free clinic|`|OI3bf4yjaa	If you had unprotected sex there is ALWAYS a chance of pregnancy. You can still get pregnant while you have sex during your period, you know. Take a pregnancy test.|`|II5N7XYKaa	Yup, you may be pregnant!

wziUVyVoaa	Sasha Nicole - I love this name. I've always loved the name Sasha. No one really uses it anymore =(.    Shaelyn Elizabeth - I'm not a huge fan of this name. It could be very hard for some people to pronounce, therefore it could cause problems in the future with school and sports. Plus, there's too many variations made up these days with the name Shae.    Makaela Rae - I like this name, but I like the name McKenzie Rae more. It sounds like one of those names in which no one will call her McKenzie, she will always be McKenzie Rae! And that's cute.    Brooke Christine - I like both names apart, but I don't think they make a very good name together =(.    Alexis Jayne - I think this is very pretty. Even though the name Jane is common, I really like what you did with the spelling. The name Alexis is popular now, but still very very pretty.    Kirena Emily - This is probably my second favorite, next to Sasha Nicole. It's exotic and unique. Plus the name Emily compliments it well.    Micah Andrew - The name Andrew is a little over-used, but the name Micah isn't, and it has a biblical background (even better).    Zachary Michael - Both of these names are very over-used. Zachary isn't badly over-used, but Michael definitely is. I still like it, though.    William Joseph - I don't like this name =(. I don't really like the name William (a little too old-fashioned for my taste) and Joseph is too common. I guess it depends on you and your tastes though, not mine lol.    They're all very nice and I think you made nice choices. My definite favorite is Sasha Nicole, though. Good luck! =)|`|LiiDOQWqaa	Mikaela Rae|`|sajJeZvgaa	Dude give your kid a real name here.

AA10858530	It's either unprotected or it's not.  There's no "might have been unprotected".  And even if it was protected, sometimes unexpected things to happen, like condoms breaking, pills failing, etc.    What you should do is go down to the drugstore or wherever, and pick up a pregnancy test.  Pee on it, wait however long it says, look at the symbols that appear.  That will tell you if you're pregnant, not anyone on yahoo answers.|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	what is recent?    A day ago?  Get plan b    More than 3 days, wait and see if your period is late    How do you not know if you use protection?|`|kaqPSgTVaa	take a test or go to planned parenthood.|`|k9nLue0Uaa	it might have been unprotected?

What makes us believe that you will listen to us this time?|`|9vy2FTfkaa	There could be a chance you are not. I have had unprotected sex before and not gotten pregnant. The best thing you should do is wait for your period, if you haven't gotten it by the time you are expected, buy a test. I found out the hard way. I took a pregnancy test b/c my friend said I was. 2 out of the 3 that were in the box said negative. I wanted to just get rid of the last one so I took it a month later. Turns out I'm pregnant. So my best advice is just to wait until your period, if it doesn't come, take the test. If anything go to the doctor. Also, there is a new pill called Plan B. You have at least 72 hours after unprotected sex to prevent it. Sorry if I didn't help you much.     Good Luck with everything
zGXbaHOBaa	Okay, this question should seem like a no-brainer, but before everyone starts riding her case, think about it. Not all schools teach sex-ed, and parents can still choose to keep their children in the dark. The parent has the choice of allowing their child to take sex-ed classes or not. If they choose not to have their child educated in school, then it is *their* job to educate their child, and many parents refuse to do that.  Lets go ahead and educate her, please. Let her have information so, since she is already having sex, she'll make educated decisions.  Sex is considered "unprotected" when you or your boyfriend is not using a condom or other anti-sperm device. There are different things that you can use to prevent sperm from reaching your eggs, like NuvaRing and something that was popular in the 80s called a "sponge". Google "contraceptives" if you want more info, or better yet, ask your parents or a doctor.  Question: If you wear a female condom (yes, they make gender-specific condoms) and your boy wears a male condom, is it better?  Answer: No. The two condoms will rub against eachother, even if you use lube, and can rip easier. You can use a condom and a NuvaRing or Sponge, but not two condoms at once.  Question: My guy is big. Will the condom fit him?  Answer: Yes. Condoms are made to stretch, and they do make extra large condoms for those guys whose egos are equally inflated. My sex-ed teacher in the sixth grade stretched a regular sized condom over her entire head with no problem. He'll fit. Make him wear it.  Question: Will it feel as good to him if he's wearing a condom?  Answer: Some men report that they can feel the condom and that it does get in the way of the full pleasure, but if he worries after the fact about you getting pregnant, isn't a little less pleasure now better than a possible few months of worry?  Pregnancy occures when the sperm from the penis actually manages to penetrate an egg. It can happen the first and only time you have sex. There are reports of girls having sex while on their period and still getting pregnant. It is a rare thing to ovulate while on your period, but you might be one of the few, so why take that chance?  Sperm live up to three days in the vagina. That means if your egg isn't dropped and fertalized the first day, it still could be the second, or third. Most over-the-counter pregnancy tests require hormones in your body to build up for about 2weeks before they can give you an accurate idea if you're pregnant or not.    I know this isn't what you want to hear, but if you don't know the basic fundamentals of sex and being pregnant, you might not be ready to be having sex.  Talk to your parents or your doctor to get the facts about pregnancy and sex. Remember, abstinence is the only way to prevent pregnancy 100%.  Also, please remember: Condoms have a small chance of preventing the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs, previously known as veneral diseases). That small chance is better than nothing when it comes to preventing them. Chlymidia is a very popular STD that is, luckily, cureable, but it does damage to your body each day you don't know its there. It causes uterine scarring which can prevent the ability to one day carry a baby, or can even cause ectopic pregnancies due to scarring in your fallopian tubes.    If you have any questions, please ask your parents. It is their job to educate you in the sexual matters if they didn't want the schools to. It is better they know that you're sexually active and give you all the right information than to leave them in the dark and get pregnant with a child you might not be able to take care of or get an STD that will affect you for the rest of your life.  Decisions you make now will affect you for the rest of your life. Please get more info on sex before you continue in your sex life.|`|k9nLue0Uaa	How can you sayit might have been unprotected????? Either it was or wasn't!|`|bT4npA7Jaa	Okay, first of all if you have to spell out SEX, you shouldn't be having it. Honestly, grow up. And DUH you can get pregnant with unprotected sex.

I would contact my doctor immediately.|`|pmiKJGJmaa	yes you can get pregnant from having unprotected sex! you can go get the plan b pill at the pharmacy without a prescription as long as you're 18 and it might help you if it hasnt been 72 hours. but other than that, either wait til ur cycle comes on... and you can go to the doctor after ur cycle goes off to take a test... cuz sometimes your cycle might come on even when pregnant!
14pjwQPLaa	Well, you know it's going to disappoint your mom, but since she's the one that brought it up, I think she'd be MORE disappointed if you didn't come to her for help to prepare yourself for responsible sex.      You might want to just bring it up by saying that you and your boyfriend are starting to get more and more physical, and you want to make sure you are completely protected just in case things get out of hand.  That way, it doesn't make it sound like, "Hey mom, BF and I are gonna get it on Saturday night!"      Keep in mind that you should be on birth control for at least a month (two months, preferable) before you depend on your birth control to be your only form of contraception.  Even then, a condom is still a very, very good idea. Better safe than sorry!    I will observe, however, that you should probably wait until you are more excited than you are nervous before you take that step.  Don't push it -- when it's the right time, you'll know it. If he's at all considerate, he'll take a lot of time and trouble to make sure that your first time (and his!) is extra-special and not just a quickie in the backseat.  For the first time, the more foreplay, the better.|`|ALvp7YRuaa	sorry girl i don't about the types of birth control. but you should sit your mom down and tell her that you need to talk to her and there she'll know what is gonna come out of your mouth. like tell her that your ready to take it to the next step and she'll see how mature you've become on making your own decision in your life. but if she explodes then tell her that she was the one who said to come to her and tell her it's the way of life and people do everyday but you're doing it because your ready!well kayy den byebye;  RiCHARd|`|hqSDVWuKaa	just say to your mom, when it's just the two of you, mom, you know how you told me to use birth control? well, i'm ready for it. she'll know what to use, but use CONDOMS too.... just in case, you can also ask at, like, the pharmacy. nerves- ehhh.... not much to say, just calm yourself down, i guess.... haha idk|`|AA11476951	Just so you know....the day you start birth control you cannot have sex! You'll get pregnant. It takes a while to get into your system. Ask your doctor how long it takes. If you are seriously thinking of sex (and I DO NOT recommend before marriage) tell your mom now. The sooner you get on birth control the less likely you are to have a little one running around.|`|rP1OWD38aa	Be open and honest with your Mom.  If you are like best friends then she's probably ready to hear it from you and will listen.  As for protection, birth control... definitely.  Condoms, absolutely.    As for the nervous part... that's natural.  Relax, take your time and cherish every moment.  Just remember one thing... once you cross that threshold, you can never go back.|`|0K42KId5aa	It is very normal to be nervous the first time you have sex. Nothing really can calm your nerves down in this situation. I think it is so responsible that you are going to get on BC before you do have sex. And that you discussed this a lot with your boyfriend. I'm on Yaz it is the best oral B/C pill I've been on. I'm 27 years old and have been on basically all types of b/c. Just make sure to take your pill everyday.      Okay to bring it up to your mom is sorta tricky. She sounds very down to earth and understanding. And even though she is very religious she will understand your feelings of wanting to have sex. I would just sit down with her and tell her that you and your boyfriend are getting along really well and you are thinking about getting on some sort of birth control JUST INCASE you two do end up having sex. If your mom is real easy to talk to then I would confess and tell her you and him are wanting to have sex and are ready. But if not then just tell her just incase something happens..but assure her nothing has...you want to be protected. If you don't want to go down that route with your mom tell her your periods are very inconsistent and that you would like to get on the pill to regulate your period. Also mention that BC pills help clear up acne and that is another good reason to get on it.|`|II5N7XYKaa	If you don't feel comfortable talking with your mother about this then you're not ready to have sex.    Try waiting until you're an adult to engage in adult behavior.  Then you won't have to involve your mother.
Bw1h5xAcaa	You have to find a hospital that allows them, not all do. Most hospitals have tubs to labor in, but for insurance reasons or whatever they do not allow waterbirths. So it might be hard to find a facility that will let you both labor and deliver in the tub.     Once you find a facility, work backwards, ask the hospital what physicians or midwives have medical priveleges there, and then choose someone for your primary OB provider.    Both doctors and midwives can do waterbirths - at the facilities that allow it. But personally I would recommend a Certified Nurse Midwife. They just generally take a more natural and holistic approach to pregnancy and labor and delivery than many OB/GYNs.|`|SRzswqTeaa	Do you live in the US?  It's a little bit harder to find hospitals that allow waterbirths.  There are hospitals that allow you to labor in a tub, but they don't usually let you give birth in one.  In my area, there are more hospitals *without* tubs, than with.  You might want to contact some doula's or childbirth educators in your area to get an idea of what is available.   Your next step would be look into either a birth center, or a homebirth with a midwife.  Good luck!  Email me if you need help in your research :-)|`|yznZqcznaa	Try to google birthing centers in your area or water birth and your state.  Here in Ga I know that one hospital does offer them, they have a birthing center.  Once you find a place that does them you have to find a Dr or midwife that delivers there and start going to them.
eSsQRGlMaa	ground him|`|yGwda7wPaa	I would talk to him about treating other people with respect.  I would take the picture away and think of an appropriate discipline, such as doing something nice for someone else, perhaps even the girl in the class.|`|WBhkQK9Haa	well if you are a christian i would remind him tht this is all part of growing up but he should not lust over her.  also be gentle. its not like he's trying to disrespect her.  He probably like her. Or is just her breasts. Still remind him this behavior is unsutable and then encourage him to go on a run whenever he has these thoughts. nothing like good ol excercise to clear your mind.|`|QQI4rliYaa	ha i dont even no how to answer this one|`|C7UsyVkVaa	Personally I would take the picture, rip it into small pieces and give him an embarrassing  speech on how women deserve respect. Sometimes the best and easiest way to get through to your kid is embarrassment. Good look!|`|DRTM8M07aa	Well... this really depends on how old he is... but definitely save it and show it to him when he's older. You'll get a kick out of the reaction - my mom did when she did it to me.
AhoB10CTaa	she'll probably just have an outie belly button. everyone is different :)|`|HqOkC2YHaa	It'll stay an outtie, I wonder why that happens...on to researching lol thanks for keeping my mind occupied for the next little bit :)|`|i8NOVfm0aa	she will probably have an outie forever. :) now she can't ask  to get it pierced lol|`|ac5gX7sNaa	There is nothing wrong with having an outie. My daughter is 18 months old and has an outie, everyone thinks it's cute :)|`|CEpsmUmraa	is not going to go in, after the remains of the umbilical cord fall off thats what the babies belly button is going to look like, so it looks like to me your baby has an outie :0)
Ar80Ri8eaa	There's a definite chance you can become pregnant from this.     Pre-ejaculate contains sperm and it sounds like he had a lot of it.|`|bxqwIjyeaa	these people are all idiots and have payed WAY too much attention in sex ed in high school. which is aka PROPAGANDA    no, pre-ejaculate only contains sperm if there is sperms on the walls of his urethra left from a recent "splooge." so if he pees(clears out urethra) before yall get down, you should be straight. before i put my girl on the pill i did it all the time. no worries little homey|`|rjVALevtaa	Yes, there's a chance although it's probably slim. It is possible to get pregnant from pre-c-m. Maybe you should look into another form of birth control like a cervical cap or Mirena or something.|`|x4uGfC4oaa	Yes, there's a pretty good chance, but don't worry about it yet. Wait until you miss a period, but don't stress yourself out about it.|`|DGXE4VH0aa	Yep...you sure can.|`|IA5zVfk0aa	i got pregnant like that so good luck :/|`|PWVYYh2Haa	the "wet" that he felt was precum, and yes you can get pregnant from it, so be more careful, or prepare to be living with a baby. and you may want him to read on sex ed .|`|AA11764538	you could   You could go ask for the morning after pill just incase.|`|eiFQ0mHCaa	If you aren't 1/2 way through your cycle - which is when you ovulate, you probably won't get pregnant.  Most females only have a 1-3 day window to get pregnant.|`|jUwFP8Rnaa	www.babynames.com|`|6EIdLkS7aa	You sure can!  Look up "precum"|`|7OgMrMn1aa	yes you can, its called precum, and its just as easy to get pregnat this way, as if he finished in you|`|YiY9Yd2Jaa	Any time you have your knickers off in the same vicinity as a boy you are likely to get pregnant.
FiUprYsvaa	Its ok to text each other. You CAN read her text messages. While they are on the phone that is, if she deletes them you'd have to supoena the phone company for them.     But its "going out" for tweens, its not real.   Its like splenda, it looks like sugar but its not.     Going out at her age goes something like this:    Girl: Hey, we should go out.  Boy: Ok  They both walk away.    They hold hands in the hallways. Maybe share pizza at lunch.     I would let the boy come over to your house and let them hang out and you watch over but don't be a vulture.  Take them places like ice skating or to the mall. Stay there with them and sip on hot coffee or endulge in some panda express.    Its cute at that age.    Now, if you change colors and morph into Momzilla, and stomp around banning her from dating, she'll rebel, harbor bad feelings toward you and probably end up pregnant.     But if you allow her "baby steps", basically what I listed above, she'll be more likely to respect your rules knowing you won't say NO RAWR NO all the time. Take her and the boy to go do things like I said. Ice skating, to the mall, to go do things like putt putt golf, stuff like that.  Let him come over. Watch over them but don't be a vulture perched on the couch between them.     Please trust me on this.   If you follow the kind a parenting I am talking about, your daughter will be more open with you and come to you more. You will have a way better relationship with her. She won't feel the need to sneak around because she will know you are compromising and reasonable.    15 is about the age teens go on single dates.  So 12 or 13-14 is the best time to do those group dates and double dates and it's also better to set down the guidelines then as well because you can't teach a teen anything, its best to get to them while they are young.       I hope I helped.  Please feel free to IM me if you want some more advice.   :D|`|WQONdh1Laa	I think you should, but set limits like until she's older she can only go on double or group dates.  Having a boyfriend would probably make her more outgoing and confident about herself.  I am 13 and those are the rules my parents have set and it works out fine.  Just make sure he's not a creeper. jkjk just freaking you out. :)|`|jvW3a5GYaa	That's a tough one - she's way too young to have a boyfriend but, honestly, if she's bent on having a boyfriend she doesn't need your approval or permission to sneak around and have one at school.   Maybe the best thing to do would be to keep the communication open with her and talk to her - tell her you understand about having a crush on someone, explain the difference between having a crush and having a boyfriend (stuff like dating, kissing, etc)|`|hxienw1Xaa	Okay listen lady (no offense) im 13 and the worst think you can do to a kid is tell them they need limits and they cant hang out with somone. Now if hes more then 2 years older then hes should go but just let them out but make sure they cant get a lone even though if they wanted to they could and really you cant tell her she cant talk to him.... be nice and dont presure. I hoped I really helped >.>  -Some teen|`|aXm6wS8paa	she is too Young to have a bf, you should talk to her tell her too wait until she is a bit older,she might cry and yell and begging but she still might have one behind ur back, promise her something or if she really wants a bf let her but just make sure you when she gets older she under stands she under stands     good luck with her :)|`|y43tzOQlaa	Well as the mom of two teenage girls, now 17 & 18, and speaking from allot of girl & boy experience at this point. No to the 12 yr. old and a boyfriend. Trust me. Also the texting at this age should be ended. My girls had my-space at 12 and Dad &I didn't know for two yrs. I can only tell you that they have an Amazing ability to be extremely sneaky. We have been through some real rough time with the whole boy thing with our girls. Even when you think your on top of it they come up with something else. Be very aware!!!|`|2922d954ea395adb74f8ebd934852090aa	I dated at 12...it didnt last. I dated at 13 and 14...it didnt last. They were all cheesy, fleeting kid flings. My mother tried to stop me too and I just got pissed and did it anyway. If you tell her not to, she'll prob wind up "dating" him at school anyway...theres really no way to stop them from seeing each other at school.     What you can do is monitor her outside of school if she sees him............be around or in next room if they watch movies or hang out at your house.........make sure you call his mother to make sure there is parental supervision if she hangs out at his house. If they go ice-skating, mall, movies, etc, make sure you or another adult drop off, set a time limit, and pick up.     Most of all, talk to her about what you find appropriate behavior and what you expect from her. She'll listen........even if it annoys her, she'll know she has age appropriate limits and that she needs to abide by them...if she doesnt, thats when you start taking those privileges/freedoms away...thats eventually how I learned.|`|P544Sbmqaa	Well, theres not a whole lot you can do to stop her from talking to him.  I would allow supervised home dates if she is mature enough to do that.  I would NOT, however, let them have alone dates.    So, let her invite the boy over for dinner or a family outting.  Do not let them be in a private room, make them stay in public areas of the house like the living room or kitchen.  You can let them be "alone" but keep a watchful eye on whats going on.  This can be a good time to let her explore a relationship under your guidence.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	That depends.    Is this a "school boyfriend"...meaning most if not all the contact is there...lunch, and whatever...or actual dating?    Twelve is too young in my opinion.  It sounds like your girl is more interested in "having a boyfriend" than actually dating. The problem is that it sets up the concept that she needs a boyfriend to validate herself.    First, she needs to be mature, independent, and confident.    Good luck.|`|fALkYOC1aa	Well, there's nothing really you can do.  She is going to text him regardless if you give her permission to have a boyfriend or not.  It's better for her to do it around you than behind your back.  Maybe allow him over at your house when you are there. If she goes out with him, maybe only let it be in groups... until she reaches the appropriate age to actually start "dating".|`|AHEFXgE7aa	Have an open relationship with her so she feels she can always go to you for anything.  If she gets in some kind of trouble, hopefully you will be the first to know.  I would start to talk to her about relationships, the fun as well as the dangers.  Sounds like she already has a boyfriend, so take it from there.    Cheers|`|ox7mJ2Psaa	get over the shock / anger and get her an appointment for birth control. i recommend the patch under the skin or the shot type because girls don't take the pills when they should and things do go farther than they should sometimes. young girls worry more about losing the boy friend or hurting his feeling than making sure she doesn't get pregnant. girls are just dumb that way.
Kr09aQJkaa	Foster-adopt is a very good option. The friend that told you the government will give you money every month to take care of the child must have been talking about foster care. They do give you a little bit, very little. If you do decide to foster be sure you are able to support a childs needs fully because what they give for clothing, food and housing would barely support a puppy much less a child. This isn't a paycheck it's to help cover a small portion of the childs care the rest us up to you.|`|ETcBRko3aa	If you want money, get a JOB.       Adopting from foster care for a paycheck sucks!.        Disgusting....|`|AXshzI0Kaa	There is never a guarantee the Government will subsidize an adoption just because the child is adopted. Some states will deem the child eligible if they are considered special needs, that is over a certain age, medically needy, sibling group.....    Honestly, if you cannot afford a child....then best not adopt. They are very expensive. Daycare costs upwards of 500 bucks a month, food is high, shoes are expensive......    http://www.childwelfare.gov is a good place to look up adoption subsidy guidelines by state as they are all a little different.    ETA:    Okay, I missed the "other country" in the question.     The U.S. government will not subsidize an adoption for a child adopted internationally, unless you somehow swing it though the adoption agency and then apply for welfare services as a single parent living in a low income means.....but then that doesn;t even make sense as it costs A LOT OF MONEY to adopt through international agencies....|`|73458eadba0f98a5aadf5ddb0b5dc1ceaa	...But you look like you're 12.|`|gEBBpvlFaa	Look into foster-to-adopt in the U.S. These kids really NEED homes and loving families. Many of the children in foster care are of mixed race or of Hispanic descent. My son is. I adopted him through foster care 5 years ago.    Contact your county's Department of Child and Family Services. They will tell you how to get started.    Many countries outside the U.S. are closing adoptions outside the country because of black market baby-selling. This is common in Guatemala and parts of Asia. If you adopt from outside the U.S. you could very well be "buying" a baby that has been stolen from his or her mother in order to make money for some nasty people. Note that I am not saying that ALL children in other countries are stolen or sold. But enough of them are that I wouldn't want to be a party to that.    ETA: If you can't support a child on your salary, don't adopt. Expecting to get a check to 'help' you raise your kid is pretty low class.|`|hTieELhTaa	From my understanding if you foster children you get money each month to help care for the child. once the child is adopted it is YOUR child and you are expected to care and pay for all of that childs needs. i dont want to sound rude or mean here but it sounds like you are considering adoption for a monthly check and if so shame on you! I really dont think the government would pay you to adopt outside of the country seeing as how there are so many children in the US that need a forever family and homes.|`|DmJFln79aa	You shouldn't be adopting if you need assistance in raising a child.  Half the time, that's why the kids are facing adoption.  Why have them leave their biological home, only to go to another home with the same circumstances?      BTW, they don't give you enough to make it a career.|`|2wyDALHgaa	Is there a question in there somewhere?    Edit:  Well, now that you have posed some sort of a question here is what I understand about it and what happened to us.  Yes, in many areas when someone adopts a child from foster care there is a monthly payment that the State makes to assist with the costs of raising that child.  It's not payment for the child, it's intended to be financial assistance to assist with the raising of that child and the costs that the parents may incur because of issues the child may have.  Counseling, medical care, vocational training and such things.  The State feels that it's more cost effective to assist parents with state sponsored adoptions then it is to retain those children in care for the rest of their childhood.  Of course, the fact that the children find loving homes is the best benefit but anything that helps with their adoption is a good thing.  Such assistance however does not happen with international adoptions, private adoptions or agency adoptions.|`|vwTyihvvaa	Whether you are married, single, etc. if you cannot financially support a child than you should not be adopting one.
DDIBEvUTaa	ask your doc of course but he may be getting ready for solids.  My boy started eating a lot more around 4 months, but around 4 1/2 months he would start nursing then pull away & fuss.  My milk supply seemed fine- it really just seemed like he was teething (symptoms were the same when he got 2 teeth in a month before) I was determined to wait until 6 months to start solids for my little man, but his growth slowed drastically between 4-5 months & doc told me to start him on food (when she had advised to wait until 6 months at our 4 month visit).  I started him on the cereal the other day, he wolfed it down then starting nursing even more often.  *But my boy was also having weight gain issues, each baby is different*. Seek the advice of your pediatrician or a LC|`|b0c36350d835d81614a99e05c0418bf5aa	pump once you are done feeding him and let him use you as a pacifier. Try not to give him the bottle too much because your body will start realizing that you aren't feeding as often and that will affect your supply. A breast is never really empty...he's just getting annoyed because it isnt coming out as quickly as a bottle. Plus babies get out much more than a pump does. I always have a bit of an oversupply because those growth spurts are sheer hell!|`|4e67Pdfvaa	the best thing I can reccomend is having the baby nurse on you as a pacifier even when not hungry.. that will increase it a ton!|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Nursing will increase your supply faster, you just need to make it easier for baby.  Personally I would ditch the bottles, a 4 month old is old enough to take a cup.    http://www.kellymom.com/bf/concerns/baby...  "Instant Reward" techniques    For a newborn who is not latching or an older baby who does not want to wait for letdown, try these techniques that help to teach (or re-teach) your baby that nursing is a way to get milk:        * Hand express or pump until let-down, just before trying to latch baby, so that baby gets an instant "reward" for latching on. Another way to elicit let-down is by doing reverse pressure softening.      * If you are using a nipple shield to transition to nursing, try filling the tip of the shield with expressed milk prior to applying the shield and latching, so that baby gets some milk first thing as he latches.      * Drip expressed breastmilk (if you have it) or formula onto the tip of the nipple as you're latching (use an eyedropper or a bottle). You can continue this while you're breastfeeding: Just drip milk toward the center of baby's upper lip; let the drop start on the breast and roll down toward the center of the upper lip (12 o'clock position if you're using the football/clutch hold), one drop at a time. A curved tip syringe can also be used to drip milk into baby's mouth.      * Use a nursing supplementer to increase milk flow at the breast.    If baby starts breastfeeding but stops sucking as soon as the milk flow slows, breast compressions can speed the flow of milk. If this is not sufficient, the last two methods above can also be used.    http://www.kellymom.com/newman/15breast_...  Breast Compression How to do it       1. Hold the baby with one arm.     2. Hold the breast with the other, thumb on one side of the breast (thumb on the upper side of the breast is easiest), your other fingers on the other, fairly far back from the nipple.     3. Watch for the baby's drinking (see videos at www.thebirthden.com/Newman.html), though there is no need to be obsessive about catching every suck. The baby gets substantial amounts of milk when he is drinking with an open mouth widepausethen close mouth type of suck.     4. When the baby is nibbling at the breast and no longer drinking with the open mouth widepausethen close mouth type of suck, compress the breast. Do not roll your fingers along the breast toward the baby, just squeeze. Not so hard that it hurts and try not to change the shape of the areola (the part of the breast near the babys mouth). With the compression, the baby should start drinking again with the open mouth widepausethen close mouth type of suck. Use compression while the baby is sucking but not drinking!     5. Keep the pressure up until the baby no longer drinks even with the compression, and then release the pressure. Often the baby will stop sucking altogether when the pressure is released, but will start again shortly as milk starts to flow again. If the baby does not stop sucking with the release of pressure, wait a short time before compressing again.     6. The reason for releasing the pressure is to allow your hand to rest, and to allow milk to start flowing to the baby again. The baby, if he stops sucking when you release the pressure, will start again when he starts to taste milk.     7. When the baby starts sucking again, he may drink (open mouth widepausethen close mouth type of suck). If not, compress again as above.     8. Continue on the first side until the baby does not drink even with the compression. You should allow the baby to stay on the side for a short time longer, as you may occasionally get another letdown reflex (milk ejection reflex) and the baby will start drinking again, on his own. If the baby no longer drinks, however, allow him to come off or take him off the breast.     9. If the baby wants more, offer the other side and repeat the process.    10. You may wish, unless you have sore nipples, to switch sides back and forth in this way several times.    11. Work on improving the babys latch.    12. Remember, compress as the baby sucks but does not drink.    In our experience, the above works best, but if you find a way which works better at keeping the baby sucking with an open mouth widepausethen close mouth type of suck, use whatever works best for you and your baby. As long as it does not hurt your breast to compress, and as long as the baby is drinking (open mouth widepausethen close mouth type of suck), breast compression is working.|`|OyBuEpOTaa	There's a lot of good answers. Make sure to drinks lots of fluids. I would let the baby nurse more if he will. Perhaps you can drip some formula down as he suckles to encourage him. You can check for more suggestions with the La Leche League.|`|FmC1TGm5aa	Stop using the bottle for a few days and increase the frequency of your nursing sessions. Only use one bottle per day when you bring the bottle back and make absolutely sure you're using a slow-flow nipple on the bottle. I think you're projecting a bit - your baby is not old enough to "know" the bottle will fill him up instantly (nor is he old enough to take a cup!). And on top of this, I think you have underlying fears that your milk supply isn't adequate (we all do). But it is!     Before trying any of this, you should really see a lactation consultant and call your pediatrician. Most hospitals have an LC on staff, and they're extremely helpful! I would not have succeeded at breastfeeding without one!|`|3hIr3Dllaa	every 1-3 hours with a goal of 12 pumps a day    pump every time he feeds for 10 min once he's done or 20-30 min total if he refuses the breast|`|skzRZdAgaa	Once he has finished feeding give each breast an extra 5 mins each. There is nothing wrong though with giving him a supplement once a day, also i used fengugreek its in healthfood shops and is herbal and it helps boost milk supply.|`|HCMrR1O9aa	ok, after he eats, pump about thirty min. after wards, and save the milk in the fridge, let him eat, then pump thirty min. after ward, and once you save up enough milk, feed it to him in a bottle and pump that session....thats what i did...lol and i pumped every time thirty min. after he ate till my bodie got used to how much he needed to eat...every body is different, why not look up a nursing specialist for around your area if that doesnt work, and that'll provide extra help!!! i hope i was helpfull and good luck|`|gvLjbVFJaa	I would try to go every two hours during the day, and then at least 2 times during the middle of the night, if you can.     Have you thought about taking Fenugreek to help your supply? You need to take at least 9 capsules a day to notice a difference.     Also, if you give him a bottle switch the nipple to a SLOW flow nipple. Don't use any other flow.     If you have any pumped breast milk, you should give at your breast using an SNS (Supplemental Nursing System) instead of a bottle, that way not only is he getting the extra milk but he is also stimulating your breasts as well while he's feeding. He will also get the faster flow that he is looking for. So if you can, use an SNS each time you nurse over a bottle. This will help your supply a great deal. I had the same problem around my baby's 3 month mark, and using the SNS boosted my supply tons. Also, do tons of skin-on-skin contact. Having him naked (with diaper) on your chest will help as well.    check out:    http://www.medelabreastfeedingus.com/pro...  http://www.kellymom.com/bf/pumping/alter...  http://www.kellymom.com/bf/supply/adopti...

21EWKrF6aa	Hi there.My sister has had both of boys at home.She had a midwife and if there was any problems the midwife called for the help.My sister didn't have any problems giving birth.I was there to watch both of my nephews being born.Her third son was born in the hospital only because at that time there was no midwife in our area.Her kids are now 14 12 and 3 years old.There is now a midwife in are area but my husband and I are not able to have children of our own.If I was to get pregnant would get a midwife in a heart beat.|`|i8Ch743Laa	I don't say they're wrong,in any way. I just say,in case there are issues with the mother,do it in a hospital,just to be safe. It only takes a woman 8 minutes to hemorrhage.|`|a3MSSvdcaa	There are some hospitals that are willing to let you do your own thing naturally in there, but there are doctors and nurses there to step-in in case of a complication.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	It's all about the baby, a hospital is safer in case there are complications|`|46ddc6b6990fcd5b5d5e36dc7b533ccaaa	If you have a normal pregnancy with no complications and a term baby then there is no reason not to have a home birth so long as you have a qualified midwife at hand who can recognise anything going wrong before it gets to serious.    Never have a home birth without a midwife or doctor present (unless its unplanned!! :P)     Home birth for your first baby may not be a good idea since you do not know how you or your body copes with labour and the pain, if you will bleed alot afterwards etc.    Its a very contraversial topic and i would suggest you find a doc or midwife first who will discuss the pros and cons with you|`|RLbN2Ujhaa	My 3rd was a water birth, though in a hospital. My first 2 were also drug-free but "land births" and I am planning with excitement a second water birth! When I got into the tub, I felt like I regained control over the contractions and my fear went away. For the first time I didn't end up with debilitating hemorrhoids. And the warm water increases blood flow to your uterus making the contractions more efficient. I probably went from 7 to 10 cm and pushing in 15 minutes (can't say for sure b/c they don't check you ALL the time like regular hospital births were you're so drugged you can't feel what's happening to your body.) There is not birthing center in my state. I can't home birth b/c I risk out b/c of a hereditary blood disorder my babies may inherit.  ~~~ wanted to add that most of the complications that hospitals have to handle are instigated by doctors in the first place: medically unnecessary induction, drug reactions, breaking water prematurely and having cord prolapse, labor stalling b/c of epidural.|`|kcGFK36Waa	My respects to women who have home births.. I would never have a home birth. Because I wouldn't want to not have an epidural.|`|bsMfl0Uoaa	hun.. i would totally pop my baby out at a hospital.. but it's your call.|`|w2uktQyBaa	I personally will have my baby in a hospital because they are more equipped to handle an emergency should one arise.  If I were you I would do researh on finding a hospital in your area that will let you have a doula or midwife at the birth and respect and follow your birth plan unless it is an emergeny to save you or your baby's life.  Have you seen the documentary The Business of Being Born by Ricki Lake?  Check it out if you haven't.
RSfFN1Koaa	Tell them before hand, tell them to be optimistic because you like him and he is a good guy.|`|76nTvO4iaa	How long have you been together?    What have you told your parents about him?    If he's a great guy and makes you happy, tell them about him before you even consider introducing them.  Stress his good qualities.|`|hqSDVWuKaa	i agree with the first answer, kittens.... but it also depends on your age.... =]|`|b30a67bb9890faa58afa5ef3c9a79a91aa	Well, you're going to have to introduce him someday...I would try talking to your parents first about him before introducing them. Explain WHAT you really about him - his personality, his intelligence level, and other traits you find desirable.     When your parents and your boyfriend meet for the first time, I doubt that your parents will be rude to him, as that is an uncourteous gesture. They may show their disapproval to you later with a talk, but it should go alright...as long as your boyfriend acts polite and tries his best to impress them!    But most importantly, explain to your parents what you like about him.|`|bSkYYRrEaa	You don't. You'd be causing unnecessary trouble for no reason. What's your age? That depends on alot, and also how long have you been dating him?|`|14pjwQPLaa	Well, just give them a bit of a warning -- say, "He's very individualistic in how he dresses, and you might be a little surprised by his (____) piercing, but just talk to him for a little while, and you'll be surprised at how (smart, sweet, funny, etc.) he is."  You don't want them visibly taken aback when you introduce them. Point out that you aren't planning to marry him, but just enjoy hanging out with him :-)|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Forget about getting a positive response from your parents.  He doesn't sound like he has any redeeming qualities.
ErQWfSPNaa	yeah, I dont think you are.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Take another test in the morning. If you got a positive it's likely that you are. Take another test. False positives don't happen. I'm sorry.    You can always go to Planned Parenthood. They can help you there.    Add: If he had *** on his hand it's possible. Very hard to have happen but possible.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	the immaculate conception!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	You got a positive pregnancy test and you are a virgin? You need to be calling a priest not asking for advice on yahoo answers.    Seriously, you can't get pregnant unless you had sex.|`|i8Ch743Laa	Calm down,if you're a virgin,the answer is no.|`|bSZK2tVtaa	That's your problem right there you even said it! Your stressing your period away. Your not pregnant trust me. You even took the hpt. Came out negative not saying they never give a false negative but i'm pretty sure your not pregnant darling its just your stress. Also if your that worried about being pregnant you should not do any kind of oral sex until you a mature about it and get on the pill. Good luck    Sara-|`|d1X9zICiaa	You cannot get pregnant without vaginal intercourse. Meaning his penis has to be inserted into your vagina. If that didn't occur, you're fine.    But, since you don't know what it takes to become pregnant. I suggest you stop doing what you're doing.|`|46ddc6b6990fcd5b5d5e36dc7b533ccaaa	Its really rare to get a false positive test but false negatives are common. What you saw may have been an evaporation line. Its unlikely to be pregnant if you have not had sex but its possible.    Go and see your doctor for a blood test|`|5MBdJK4Baa	these kids seem so uneducated now a days!!!    If your a virgin your not pregnant!!    you have to have sex!!!!!   he has to penetrate you and ejaculate in you for you to get pregnant..    use your brain!!!!|`|X83LVP6Iaa	You say you're a virgin, so assuming no sperm has ever been near your vagina, then quit worrying about being pregnant. You aren't the Virgin Mary.|`|WBv2vD4haa	unless his penis entered your vagina and he ejaculated aka *** inside you theres no chance|`|xIF2lShpaa	You really don't need to be having sex if you are that paranoid. You are probably not pregnant, and you probably saw the line because you were so sure it was there. Wait a few years, until you know that you are ready for sex. You should consider the fact that if you have sex, there is always the possibility that you could get pregnant no matter how careful you are. That's just one of the consequences of  having sex.|`|mrYCeWoMaa	You can become pregnant as long as 1 sperm gets in there, a sperm can live in the vagina for 2 to 3 days waiting for an egg to become fertilized. so if your boyfriend had a little sperm on his hand when he was fingering you than there is a chance of pregnancy, just not as great as it would be if you had sex. But at any rate i would go to the doctor and get a blood test to be sure. Because it's not very often you get a positive result and not be pregnant.|`|qgJDdCiHaa	First of all, you are NOT a virgin. If you let him finger you, you are NOT a virgin anymore. Secondly, you could very well be pregnant if he had semen on his fingers and you were fertile at the time. If you don't want to become pregnant, don't play around at all. I doubt you are pregnant. You probably just saw the evaporation line on the test, however, you should rethink what you are doing to put you in this kind of situation before you become a "virgin mommy"|`|Bt3857hxaa	Sweetie relax!!!....There are test that do make mistakes!....The only way to fine out if you really are pregnant is to go talk with your doctor.     If you have to, go take another test tomorrow morning and find out again. -|`|KGT1B0Elaa	Dear, u need sperm to fertilise the egg before u cud get pregnant. Unless there were sperms on ur bf's fingers, i guess u will be fine....    Relax...|`|z3DoHPtMaa	u cant be pregnant unless his penis entered you and there was sperm in you or around your area. im sure your just stessing over nothing AND stressing can delay your period so just dont worry you cant be pregnant if your still a virgin :D|`|sF3UyQsIaa	hunny.  do this for me...*take a deep breath and calm down.* it looks like you should be fine. if you are a virgin, then there shouldnt be any worry to there being any semen in there to get you pregnant. fingers dont ejaculate, as far as i know...|`|8wmKeNgbaa	WOW! you really are a blonde aren't you, I think you need to get educated: FIRST OF ALL you cant be pregnant if you are a virgin, SECOND OF ALL you dont get pregnant from handjobs and fingering....|`|TQg7yubGaa	You may have just gotten a false positive, I doubt your pregnant.  Unless he was right there at the end, you can't get pregnant from just fingering and hand jobs, unless your getting REALLY close to having sex, like your both right there.|`|9vy2FTfkaa	whoa. okay virgin mary. there really is no possible way you can be pregnant. don't worry. If your boyfriend has not entered you, you should have no worries. There are some tests that can come out positive and lie to you. seriously don't worry about it. sperm+egg= pregnancy. you can't get pregnant without a man. And some future advice when you are ready to have intercourse with him be sure he wears a condom and if you are EXTREMELY paranoid about getting pregnant start birth control. If you live with family members they can't be mad at you for wanting to take precautions...no worries okay?|`|376c9ee2d13520e1ceb53b45722f7ed9aa	Relax!  Breathe!  You are most likely not pregnant.  Your boyfriend has to ejaculate into you during intercourse. If it will help ease your mind, go see and OB/GYN and have them test both your urine and your blood.  You are most likely stressing yourself out and that is why your period has not come.   Good Luck!|`|w2uktQyBaa	I doubt you are pregnant unless he had semen on his fingers when he pleasured you.  Just go to your doctor or a clinic to find out for sure.  All this stress will just delay your period anyways.|`|yAnks4aGaa	she can be a virgin and get pregnant, as long as there was sperm involved.|`|5xaEC0EVaa	Your name Mary??  Just break down and ask your parents to take you to the "female" Dr. Lots of other explanations for your problems.|`|buCcqA5Vaa	What holy **** fingers can get you pregnant!?! Lol funniest **** I've ever heard|`|tRDYTmoSaa	you have nothing to worry about      -pregnancy tests don't work until about 7-10 days after sex.  -also it is pretty much impossible to be pregnant if you are a virgin because his sperm need to be inside of you, unless you guys did that i am 200% positive your not.|`|lI7DRP7Jaa	I have heard abt that happening before....its rare but it does happen....think about it, it only takes one sperm to get u pregnant. when a man's penis is erect and ya'll are doing stuff he's more than likely "pre-ejaculating" and if he touched himself and fingered you he could have got u pregnant.  But to give you a little hope...in a healthy youn couple there is only a 35% chance to get pregnant avery month (with penetration)  your probably looking at 0.5%....good luck... :)|`|0cd614f1916fe3a0e7e55c61e721edc5aa	Even a virgin can become pregnant if seminal fluid comes into contact with vaginal fluid AT ALL, even a little drop on his hand can be enough to transport sperm to your genitals,which can then travel through your cervical mucous into the fallopian tube to fertilize an egg. Pregnancy tests work by detecting a hormone called HCG. Different tests show a positive at different levels, so you can get a negative on one test and still be pregnant. Modern pregnancy tests are ten times more likely to show a false negative than a false positive. If you had a positive pregnancy test, see your doctor.
ibWLdXlJaa	I think both of you overreacted. She finally has her own space and I can't say I blame her for wanting it out. But she should have been more understanding to the fact that you were sick and with working haven't had the time. You had every right to put it back but went overboard yelling at her and saying the things that you did. Maybe you could try to get her to help with the organizing if she wants it out that bad. Good luck.|`|agTCqkLDaa	You shouldn't compare to anyone ever.    She's 15-looking at her the wrong way is going to make her cry.    She probably just wants her space.    My mom and sister (and I'm 23 at home until I finish school-was in the military and it was a generous offer from my mother so I accepted) use my bathroom closet as a catch-all and then my mom gets mad when it's "cluttered".  So that's irritating.    Just go to her tomorrow and say "sweetie, I'm sorry but I just need to figure out where to put stuff, okay?"|`|uGezRb7Xaa	Can't you put it somewhere else? Give her some spare, that is for once hers.|`|Ar80Ri8eaa	You shouldn't compare your child to anyone, ever, that was out of line.     She is young and wants a place of her own. I would have just let it be.|`|wz3S190haa	if she is ugly that was meen. if its your stuff you should put it in your room, you wouldnt want her stuff in your room, an also if your her mother, why would you tell her she looks like someone she dont like? if my mom told me that i would cry myself to sleep to, also im 15, and i aint gonna lie, im going through puberty, so im moody.....im not trying to critisize you, how ever you spell that, but put your self in her shoes...hope things work out.|`|T9JDbfLPaa	she was probably just trying to help you by moving the stuff out because she knew you were tired, jeez calm down|`|tRDYTmoSaa	i am 16 so i might be some help      usually at 14 or 15 teenagers turn very moody they want they're own space and particularly girls are all about themselves and extremely on the edge with a lot of things.  not all teenagers are tho, cause im not, i have never faught with my dad but then again you should try talking to your daughter about the move, she could be angry about it or nervous idk that is my idea of what is wrong with her.      i probably didn't help much but i tried  good luck! =]|`|5a066f23730087641ff3d156e7a2b41faa	Why didn't you just tell her to move it back into her room if you are so tired?  My parents were rude to me for no reason when I was a teenager, my mom was always too tired to do things because she ate too much and was overweight.  I don't talk to them too much, may be once a month.  You need to realize that your daughter will be an adult soon and she can "choose" to not be around you.  It's also in poor taste to speak poorly about her aunt.|`|e158WyFGaa	Dont compare her to anyone.|`|a3MSSvdcaa	Just a phase.  I'm the youngest of 4 girls and always had to share a room with my one sister.  When I was around her age, my oldest sister moved out and she was barely pulling out of the driveway before i had my stuff moved in her room.  My dad was pissed because the room needed remodeled bad before I could move in there, but I thought he was just being a jerk.|`|kxIopSI8aa	Its HER room and you shouldn't have put YOUR stuff in there. Its HER personal space and YOU shouldn't have invaded it.

nrQhVcy7aa	alysia|`|DdjpQr0Gaa	You should name her Allie if that is what you like.  It could be short for Alexandra, Alejandra, or even Alligator but it will be important becuase you chose it.|`|EIgmm8ilaa	I have the same situation, hate Victoria, love Tori.    You could name her Allie, many people think Lexie/Lexi is short for Alexis but it is very well a name itself.|`|a3MSSvdcaa	There's no reason you can't name her just Allie.  I know someone named Mike, not Michael.    How about Allyssa|`|Elxuvon8aa	Kallie Callie Kalie Kalle Hallie Sallie Halie Bailie|`|w6DJj1a8aa	it;s both a cute name i think!!!! =)|`|7drjpohUaa	Allyn.

If it's the spelling that bothers you, you could spell it like Alyson.|`|WoxMH0wZaa	I think you should give her a longer name...just so that she can chose not to go by Allie when she's older, because she might want something longer and more sophisticated.     How about Alliana, Alivia, Alice, Alauna, Alayna, Aliyah, Allegra, Alissa, Alexandra, or Alicia? There are lots of options for things that can use Allie as a nickname.|`|KjF0p72naa	Name her Allie if that is what you like. It's your kid.    If I had a girl I might name her Jenny.

If you want it to look more like it's not a nickname, you could try spelling it Alley...but either way is cute!|`|a94b92cff3ce40968ac165e7d7ff52e1aa	Name her Allie if you like it. I think it's stupid to name a baby something you're not going to call her. Like giving her the name Alexandria and calling her Alex...why not just name her Alex? But that's just me. I like Allie way better than Allison too but prefer Ally.|`|Vk6oCBgQaa	how about Aliauna or Alianna?|`|VH1bIlLoaa	I love the name allie too. Maybe Alia|`|AA11459214	Alexandria is my cousin and we call her Ali  really anything that starts with "al" could be come Allie  but I just like the name Allie to not need to lengthen it|`|FAMRtYn9aa	There are so many Allie's in my school it's not even funny. I can't blame them though, it's a really pretty name. You can always name your girl Alexandra, Alessandra, Alyssa. or just Allie. Typically, the girl has a long name and uses Allie for short and I like that better.|`|nolxYfzUaa	Aliaha.  But, I love the name Allie.|`|Xg3sHmeIaa	Oh my gosh! My name is Allison Rae. But everybody calls me Allie. like everyone,my parents call me Allie Rae when i am in a lot of trouble. I hate Allison. It sounds like a old lady name.          My nickname is Al really but that is stupid and only what me parents call me. You could do Ally, Ali, Alli, Alley, or Aly. Or you could call her Leigh or Lea or Lee. There are not many nicknames for Allie that i can think of.         Congrats on the baby girl though!!|`|FP4cyhUPaa	I have a friend who's name is Allie Marie not Allison just Allie. Other Allie root names could be Alliea, Aleina, and Alexis. Hope it helps !!!|`|ot0TqzSvaa	Aleera, Alex, Aylee.
rpZ12Rt6aa	I'm sorry to hear your sister passed away.  My father died of cancer recently as well.  [EDIT] - Sorry, I didn't know the pronunciation!    I always think of leigh as sounding like 'lay.'  Now I think that's a great name.  The only problem comes to pronunciation, but once you explain it'll be alright.  It's so great that you'll be remembering her with this name :D|`|76nTvO4iaa	If you saddle your child with this name, she is going to spend the rest of her life telling people how to spell and pronounce it.  She's probably going to have the longest name in preschool & it will take her forever to write her name.    Find a first name that you like, that has standard spelling and pronunciation.  Give her Payton or Leigh for her middle name as a way to honor your sister.|`|DdjpQr0Gaa	I think that is sooooo sweet!  I dont think its a strange name at all it sounds like Rayleigh and Ive heard that alot.  Plus it has a wonderful and important meaning that will insure your daughter will have a special angel forever.|`|1ezYfkX7aa	When i first saw the name i didnt care for it and then i read why...and the meaning of it is just beautiful. We are due in june with a baby girl who we are naming Paityn Alexis =) Good choice and congrats on your pregnancy.|`|a1ymHaWAaa	aww sorry to hear about your lil sister.I hate cancer!! I lost my mom last january to breast cancer. The name is actually pretty and I think it's such a sweet thing for you to name your daughter.Absolutely precious.|`|Elxuvon8aa	not to my liking sorry  I would use Payton ot leigh as a middle name|`|qLvhoRpsaa	Any name that you choose and especially if it is to honour your sister, would be awesome. That name is beautiful and so are the reasons you chose it. Good Luck with your daughter. Peace:)|`|kPl8TTzNaa	It is nice you want to honor your sister, it is sad she died so young, but to be honest the name is horrible and trendy. Especially since Leigh is masculine looking.    How about instead of combining her name to make a name for her daughter you could use the same initials as your sister in a way to honor her? For example, Penelope Leanne. Also in that way, your daughter has a name that is feminine, honors your sister, yet is uniquely hers.    I also would not go with Peyton, which is masculine and a boy's name.|`|TX9igTWraa	i don't really like it. my first thought was payless. why not just give her your sisters name payton leigh, cuz that name sounds pretty. you could even add a second middle name and make payton-leigh her first name.|`|J3ROtKo5aa	I love it.|`|uGezRb7Xaa	Unless you are a celebrity, you should probably give your child a more popular name. Kids are cruel and they will tease her relentlessly. Maybe you could use Payton as her middle name.|`|AA12339451	As long as you like it is all that matters.|`|87WOSjwgaa	Reminds me of the soccer star! What about just using payton or leigh as a middle name.|`|2EcyWp2baa	The meaning is wonderful...not so fond of Payleigh though.|`|PJYrLxZHaa	I LOVE it, and I love the meaning behind it as well. Cute name, and I'm sorry about your sister.|`|9e446fd9db4d9ad99d9a59fab5cbb25aaa	i don't think that is a good name but i think its good that your idea is there  i think the name is awkward    talk to your parents and see if they would mind you naming your child EXACTLY after your sister  and you can always call her payleigh as a nick name if you don't want to call her your passed sisters name|`|bb0a55c9173c16dcac954fc0cee8992aaa	I love the name.  In fact, I was going to choose Paisleigh for my own daughter's name at one point.  I am sorry to hear about your sister, but this would be a great way to honor her and also have a name that is unique but not out there like Huckleberry or Apple!  :)|`|O4ysbdwVaa	i am deedply apologetic og your sister, my grand daughter died that way to.    however, i know a stripper named Payleigh. a few moths ago, she transgendered. now she is a man named Payton.    and Payleigh is a very stupid, made up sounding name.  i gaurentee she wwill be  made fun of growing up.    but you should definatly (if you WANT TO) give your daighter a name similar to Payton Leigh.     however, it is your choice. i am just saying its a very dumb  name|`|c9bdb3ad3698e1bb4ed0383822c061c8aa	I don't like Payleigh... sounds odd.  I love Payton though.|`|AA11689956	I dont understand why you're mom wouldnt want you to honor your sister by giving her the same name    i dont like Payleigh sorry    some P names    Paige  Paisley kinda sounds like Payton Leigh  Paris|`|GVSt1NLTaa	I think its cute!  I like Payliegh Dannielle!     P.S. My name is Payton   Sorry about youre sister   God bless
62ed2c415d781a32b672aaa388d79f43aa	yes my daughter slept "in bed with me " for the  nights i spent in hospital , the midwives would have like me to stay another night but i really wanted to go home so they let me they did come over for the first 3 days after discharge to see if i was coping which was nice of them as i had no friends or family around to help.|`|IXBl5l5kaa	From what I understand 48 hours is the standard, but some people may be able to go home earlier. We had our daughter at 8pm on Wednesday and were going to be able to leave at any time on Friday, but had to stay til Saturday.|`|97e203321264077846c0132c575f8c57aa	My friend had her son at 10am and she left hospital at 2pm same day.|`|aqto0hJTaa	If it's a vaginal birth, you might be able to go home the next day.  If it's late in the day (and vaginal), you would go home on the second day.    If it's a C-section, they like you to stay two full days.    If the baby has a fever when it's born, the baby must stay at least two days (or that's the way it was in my experience).  Just pray you and the baby need to stay the same number of days.  Going home without that baby sucks big time.|`|vOomJtbsaa	I had a c section and stayed for 3 nights, 4 days.  Believe me stay as long as you can, when you go home you're on your own and you don't have the help from the nurses and such.  And those first few days you take as much help as you can get.  Let your body rest and recuperate and you can bond with your baby in the hospital just as well as you can at home.  If you have a normal vaginal delivery you'll most likely be there 24-48 hrs after delivery.  Good luck!|`|Lr3lZ4draa	i had my son at 5pm, went home at 3pm the next day    it depends on the hospital,  but i had my son in the room the entire time, except when he got circumcised, and had some tests done|`|Bw18seFqaa	depends on the hospital..    if things go well tho..  vaginal birth, is typically a 2 day stay, cecarian is a 3 day stay.      You have the option of having the baby in your room, or you can send him or her down to the nursury.  Depends on if you want some extra rest or not.. the nurses can bring the baby to you if you for feeding.    My baby was probably in my room about half of the time..  there were times they took her for routine tests, check her weight, a bath, etc.. so she was in and out of the room often.|`|AA11795652	Depends on you, how you gave birth, if you tore, and your baby.  If everything goes well, you could go home after 24 hours.  I went home after 48 hours and was pleased with that.|`|rjVALevtaa	It varies. If you and the baby have no complications, usually 2-3 days. Each hospital is a bit different. With my first son I went home 2 days after he was born. With my second son, they made me stay 3 days. Which drove me crazy, btw.|`|Qe9rXFm0aa	It depends on if the birth was vaginal or csection..and also, how the mom is doing, and how the baby is doing.    But I had a vaginal delivery to a full term healthy baby..so we were out in 2.5 days.    You have the option of baby staying by your side, or they can have them in the nursery.  I was bfing, so I had her stay by my side.|`|wKYdIaZVaa	It all depends on the hospital... I had an emergency c-section at 1 in the morning on a Tuesday and went home Saturday at noon. Unfortunately, my daughter had to be in the NICU so I didn't spend much time with her at night.|`|gvLjbVFJaa	48 hours is usually the norm.   I stayed 4 nights/5 days, since my baby was born premature and she roomed in with me.    Honestly though, I think it varies from hospital to hospital but every where around here is 48 hours.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	If it's a healthy vaginal birth and everything's ok, usually the stay lasts about 48 hours or a little longer after giving birth. I gave birth in the middle of a Wednesday afternoon and went home that Friday night. Also, the hospital has the option where the baby can sleep by your side or the baby can go in the nursery.|`|rvVKr3DSaa	I havent had my baby yet but my mum gave birth on 4th november 2007 at 10:43am and was out of the hospital by 7pm that night.. we are from the UK|`|zQAWuMN4aa	I stayed at the hospital for 5 days, 4 nights. Had a c-section. Was in no rush to go home. I loved it there. Honestly.    EDIT:  We chose to put our baby in the nursery at night so we can get a bit of sleep but I would wake up unGodly early sometimes and get ready to go get her.    EDIT 2: if it's a c-section it's likely 3 or 4 days. For a vaginal it's 2 days. At least where I gave birth it is.|`|DuCxFQywaa	i got to go home after 2 days|`|HGUoCE1naa	Depends on delivery and how the baby is .Myself I was home in three days . Now with my last one I was home in five days. Just depends on how well you do and the baby.|`|AA11185954	Depends on the hospital.  Some you can leave as soon as you're put together and the baby is declared well (a few hours after) but some places have you hang around for a while.    I had mine at a military hospital, and they had me stay for 2 days to make sure my baby and I were healthy and no complications arose.|`|XN30YgK8aa	Your go home time depends on a few factors and is not so cut and dry. If you and baby do great and have no problems, and most states need your baby to pass a car seat test (they monitor the heart rate and make sure your baby can hold their temperature) then you can probably go home within 24 hours. The average stay is 48 and if there are minor complications maybe 72 hours. The more complications the longer the stay.    Most hospitals allow you to have your baby with you at all times.|`|7U1K0l2laa	Two days and the ped had to sign off on it|`|mn8tFuhoaa	well if your lucky enough and have it naturally vaginal you leave in 24 hours. and it depends on the baby if hes okay they let him go 24 hours too.. but if is a c-section normally 3 days.. i stayed in the hospital a week.. and my miracle stayed 2 months he was preemie.|`|et3OzeiLaa	on a normal basis   vaginal delivery 2 days  c section 3 days  if there are any complications with you or the baby it could be longer.    you can choose to send the baby to the nursery and have them bring the baby for feeding time.  or it can stay in your room.    good luck
69koYO5faa	during pregnancy you can Develop clots and or deficiencies. all very common and not too much to be concerned about as long as they are monitored and treated properly. eat a banana cramps in the legs or muscles could mean a potassium deficiency. ans see your dr tomorrow.     alexia's mommy|`|aqto0hJTaa	The stinging sounds like it could be a nerve thing.  However, I wouldn't guess.  It could be any number of things, some benign, some very serious.  I'd call my doc in the morning and get in ASAP.|`|JsshzKM9aa	No I haven't. I just get really bad restless legs!!!|`|OtobKO3Eaa	I had the same kind of pains from my back to the back of my thighs, the side of my thighs and down my legs. My doctor said it was sciatica which is pain along the sciatic nerve. She showed me some stretching moves that I did every morning which helped. She also told me to sleep on side ( you should always sleep on your left side while pregnant) with a pillow between my legs. My job required me to sit at a desk for long periods of time. She told me to use a lumbar pillow to support my lower back.   Every pregnancy is different.  Try to lay down on your left side with a pillow between your legs and relax. Defiantly go into your doctor tomorrow and talk it through with him/her. Write down now exactly where the pain is and what it feels like in case it subsides but if it gets any worse or you just can't deal with it I would go into the Er tonight. I could be something very serious like a blood clot in your leg.---

MHhFMdWoaa	I absolutely love the name Salem. I personally think Salem would lean more towards being a boys name, especially with Cole as a middle....it might be too much for a girls name. Although I've hear of a Male singer named Ashley Angel, which definately sounds like a girls name to me :)|`|DdjpQr0Gaa	The first thing that comes to me is "Salems Lot" .  It is also the name of the talking black cat in Sabrina the teenage witch.  I actully think Salem Cole sounds good but I dont think peace is what people would think of when they hear the name.  I would be worried people might associate it with something dark or evil.|`|LdoCKo4Qaa	Sorry, but Salem sounds like a cigarette.  Might be a nice name if the baby was conceived in the town of Salem.|`|m6xvhlJqaa	no|`|HCuArmpGaa	Its not my first choice. It sounds like a boys name personally. But if you have your mind set on the name then choose it. :)|`|9lvybFqNaa	I LOVE the name!!    We are naming our Daughter:    Salem Kaine    = )|`|7YU9IreXaa	A great name if you want your child to become a stripper.  go with a clean name like candy|`|ot0TqzSvaa	Salem sounds like a boy name to me.|`|iZyLbv6aaa	Salem. Good name.  Girl name.  The cat from Sabrina/Witch trials/The town my cousin lives in.  I like Cole. =)|`|nrQhVcy7aa	strange|`|tPeUIvzraa	I personally like this name.  I would use it as a boy name.  The first thing that popped in my head with this name is the cat on the show "Sabrina the Teenage Witch". (the cat's name is Salem).   I like Salem Cole!|`|AA11703652	I like it--it's a girl name to me.  I think the Hebrew one is spelled differently, but Ito me it sounds like Puritanical, Hester Prynne times, but with no stigma or bad associations.  I like it more the more I think about it!  The morons who mention the cigarette obviously have that on the brain...I don't associate the name with smokes at all...|`|PuRpsENEaa	I don't know why, but it sort of creeps me out!
IA5zVfk0aa	your not :)
xPR7g0wFaa	Ive never heard of that before.I think I would get her to the doctor to make sure its not serious.Chances are she just has a dry little nose and she'll be fine but to make everyone feel better,ask the doctor. Good Luck !!|`|J5V9dvm8aa	I have no idea what this could be but if she were my daughter I would definitely be concerned.  I would take her to see a doctor.  In between now and seeing one you might try a humidifier, it will moisten the air in your house and maybe rule out dryness.  Good luck.|`|UIS8Wll1aa	A call the doctor now B get Humidifier C stop bleeding hope you fiind out whats wrong good luck|`|oaF2kaXAaa	I would be concerned. Im a mum to a soon to be 18mth old.. Its dry in our house and she sometimes gets bloody crustys in her nose, but not bloody noses... set up an apt. asap.|`|PWVYYh2Haa	it is probably sinus stuff, my son used to have a similar problem but his wasn't everyonehe cries, i would ddefinitelycall your dr about it.|`|XN30YgK8aa	I would recommend maybe going to the ER and not waiting for a doctor. I would also make sure to be aware of how long this has been happening, what color the blood is and if her nose is constantly irritated? Sometimes a bloody nose can be caused by dry air, but it wouldn't be everytime someone sneezes or reaquiring. What is bothering me the most is that it has happened more then once. I would go to the ER. It isn't THAT normal of a problem to have and wouldn't you rather be safe then sorry?|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	You may as well take her, but they may just find a crack from the dry air.    On the other hand there could be something more serious.

eNAvGgHAaa	Make sure it's just not for the sex, but for who you are...  No|`|N4052uEWaa	"Save me, it's a vampire,  Im going to die." Is this a joke.|`|ErQWfSPNaa	what the? this makes NO sense. You are going to have sex with a vampire? and you are wondering if you will die when giving birth?     Weird question.|`|wA7kqXfRaa	If you do get pregnant after this, your vampire for a boyfriend is going to be in shock and will apoligize. Your stomach will grow rapidly and you will look like a very weak vampire. Hopefully, when you are in labor your boyfriend vampire or someone who is a vampire is around you so as soon as the baby is born they will change you into a vampire. It is a very difficult process. Also, you will need to feed the baby by drinking blood. Human blood. Get it from a hospital or something. You may not want to eat food right away after feeding the baby. Your baby after you give birth will be half vampire and half human. It may thirst for blood and be disgusted by human food. The baby will grow rapidly but will eventually stop aging at a good age.
XntSwYezaa	The middle!|`|a3MSSvdcaa	I personally think behind the passenger because if it's just you and him in the car, you want to be able to reach him easily and it's a whole lot easier reaching behind the passenger seat then it is the driver seat.|`|ki5hZbcTaa	If they are riding on the outside, both are equally safe. The middle is usually the safest place for carseats. However, how old is your child? If they are under 4 yrs old, you should look into keeping them harnessed longer. Most children are not mature enough to sit in a booster seat. My son is going to be 3 in 2 weeks and he is almost 40 lbs. He is still harnessed in a Graco Nautilis and will be until he hits 65lbs (the weight limit on the seat). Even though the manufacturer says he can legally sit in a booster, he is no where near ready to be able to sit properly for the entire car ride. This means having the seat belt in place and not putting it behind his shoulder.|`|d4BhvnMyaa	The safest place is in a harnessed car seat. The Graco Nautilus is pretty cheap ($139 at walmart.com), and will keep your kiddo MUCH safer. Adult seatbelts are not the best option for kids. I personally keep my son behind me (in a harnessed seat)    *****When used correctly, 5-point harness car seats provide significant safety advantages over securing your child in a booster seat using the adult seatbelt.    * The crash forces are spread over the skeletal body  over five points rather than three.    * The crash forces are spread to the strongest parts  of the child's body.    * Forward head excursion (the distance the head is  thrown forward) are lessened.    * The child is secured in the correct seating position rather  than being able to wiggle around, lean forward etc.       Look at this website- this poor little 3 year old boy died because he was in a booster seat, not a harnessed car seat. The parents account of the accident will just rip your heart to shreds.. (in fact, everyone should see this website).    www.kyledavidmiller.org
HqOkC2YHaa	I saved my daughters in a pill container, but when we moved my dog found it in a box and ate it :s    Now that was a fun story to explain to the bf lol.     One of my friends however was telling me that she saved her sons but the last time she looked at it he was about 1.5yrs old it had shriveled up to practically nothing and stank something firce and she said she threw it out (the story she told me after I told her about my dog incident lol)|`|AA11625299	I didnt know you should save it but my aunt said something about saving it and so I did w/my daughter (almost 2 months) I put it in her baby book|`|p7BjjPtNaa	Put in in carbonite|`|6jECbxIeaa	I didn't save it, but I know that you  can somehow save it with your hospital, and it can be really useful in the future in case someone has a transplant or something...I'm not sure how or why, but I know it is a good idea to save it|`|ctNNzYW6aa	I thought my baby's cord dropping off was a monumental event.  I wrapped it in a hanky and put it into her memory box... Fast forward to a couple years later when I opened the box, unfolded the hanky and discovered that I had saved a SCAB!  I got rid of it.|`|XN30YgK8aa	I didn't know that you could save the cord or that there were special meaning to the cord until MUCH after I had my son. I would have saved it or even made pills from it to be honest. I wish I had know what I know now. I think there is a lot of special meaning to the cord and I would highly recommend doing SOMETHING. Don't regret it like I do.|`|IXBl5l5kaa	My husband tossed my daughter's I don't miss it or regret not keeping it.    I'll keep things like teeth and first lock of hair but the umbilical cord wasn't a "saver" kind of deal for me. That story above of smelly cord years later makes me glad I didn't save it lol

If U still are kind of obsessed just do another test will make U feel much more comfortable no matter what we say.|`|MslcyESfaa	It is also more accurate if done first thing in the am
aqto0hJTaa	My advice is to go to another doctor, one with a lot of degrees and experience, maybe even a specialist in high-risk pregnancies.
nrQhVcy7aa	fine|`|DdjpQr0Gaa	I love Damien.  I thought the devils name was Lucifer?|`|EIgmm8ilaa	I like the name Damien, I had no idea it was the devil's name.|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	It's not the devil's name. That's ridiculous, Damien was the name of the possessed/devil spawn in The Omen. I know a couple little boys named Damien and neither show any signs of evil. Go ahead and call you future son Damien it's a cool name.|`|GEyJMsaKaa	Yeah,but it's a cool name.    I am gonna name my future son either Teagan or Christian.|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	I know a boy with that name    His mom always loved it  She is surprise by people thinking it's a name of a devil    I really do not like the name    If you do, then use it  You can always use it as the middle|`|Elxuvon8aa	I like the name Damien It means to tame or subdue I do not know how it gets a devilish meaning from that|`|coVZ1uqCaa	Just because everyone thinks that it doesn't mean it's actually true, dear.    I've known a kid named Damien. Really sweet boy, a little shy. No one would compare him as a devil (:    -----|`|rS7fh6pRaa	I like it .. its not that commen   Everyone thought the names I liked were dumb Too!   I hated it but then I learned who gives a darn what they think!!!|`|cWqVZ33laa	i think that's a really cute name! i love that name but my husband doesn't like it because i guess one of his childhood enemies was named Damien lol dork huh?? jk|`|a94b92cff3ce40968ac165e7d7ff52e1aa	I agree. It's a satanic name.|`|UKPYoPKuaa	Their is nothing wrong with Damien, ppl still name their kids Michael (myers) or Jason (Vorhees)...The only reason why Damien has negative Conotations is because it's less common.    It's a great name, go with it!|`|UYAhesuvaa	I like it :)|`|m6xvhlJqaa	i like it|`|Gjyd1W5Waa	its not what people like it what you like and if thats what youlike then use it|`|WEYA89znaa	Lol I don't think so. It's a cute name!! I actually go to school with 2 Damien's. If you like it go for it :]    Good luck!|`|LgLpJxnwaa	i think its just from a movie.  that shouldnt determan what you call your son.|`|DycMrGuSaa	I LOVE the name Damien, and if I ever have a son I'm naming him Damien Charles or Damien Alexander or Damien James lol.  :) GO FOR IT!!!|`|J1F3SRJsaa	I say go with Gaius Julius Caesar, Germanicus or Augustus, these will probably scare the bullies away.   Well I think it's better than living with Damien (Omen) probably will get picked on quite a bit.

Have a good day!
TQScv7Tcaa	For my baby shower we had all an all pink theme (if she doesnt know the sex you could do both pink and blue?), as i knew what i was having, we had pink cupcakes and pink (non-alcoholic) punch, we played pin the dummy on the baby, the abc name game and abc baby things game (whoever can name more babies names/things from a-z wins a prize), everyone put $2 in and had a date and weight guessing game (guessing what date and i would have the baby and what date she would be born), then i opened my pressie and we all sat around discussing everyone elses birthing experience and such it was a lovely day. Just let your aunt relax and make it her day and she will love it :)
Ar80Ri8eaa	Some women don't know till after birth!|`|52bAHCaUaa	9 months.    Women have gone to the hospital because they were in labor and didn't know it.    ~~~~~~~~  Well, in that case...I was 4 weeks and 1 day! :) Only waited that extra day because I convinced myself I didn't know how to count and my period really wasn't supposed to come yesterday! lol.     I believe it can happen though!    ~~~~~~~~~  I saw that TLC episode!!|`|1ScoQM0faa	where i used to work,we were cleaning u at the end of shift one night, and a colleague had been crying most of the night saying that she had really bad cramps and was really hot,then she started screaming as agushof pinky liquid came from her, and she was in labour and hhadn'teven known tthatshe was pregnant.she just thought that shed been puttin on weight from all the nights out and late-night take-away|`|VR9KhbEgaa	I have heard stories of women going the entire pregnancy without knowing, I think these cases are very rare! With my self ( I have 6 children)...with my first I think it was more of a case of denial, but I was 12 weeks. With my last I was 21 weeks...let me explain, I had my 5th on 11-09-2007, I was nursing and never had a period, I also did not go back to the dr. for my after birth check up. I noticed I was having uncontrollable night sweats & felt it was time to go see the obgyn. Little did I expect to hear "Congratulations"....  6 was born 10-09-08!|`|AA11401067	What, you mean that if you are putting on weight, and you notice physical changes, and endure some sudden sharp pains, you are going to see a doctor and discuss these changes with your friends? Only in an ideal modern country, I think.      Don't many disadvantaged and uneducated people decide instead that they can live with it?     I think it's amazing how some women and men I know don't see a doctor, leave their bullying partner, or change their lives for the better. But it's probably a common instinct to tough it out, to tell yourself that "it must be your fault and there must be something weird or wrong with you. If other people knew, that would be worse."|`|rUQAGz9kaa	the whole 9 months , but i dont know from personal experience . . . theres this tv show about people who didnt know they wer pregnant :P|`|MslcyESfaa	I was watching TLC the other night, and a lady had gone in to the hospital because of the pain, and ended up giving birth to twins!|`|X83LVP6Iaa	I have seen on Discovery Health a program where a few women were pregnant the whole 40 weeks (10months) and did not know it. There was a woman here in this town I live in that gave birth a few months ago, she is in her early 40's and did not know she was pregnant. I have never experienced it and this is my 4th pregnancy. I am so regular that if I am more than 3-4 days late I know to take a pregnancy test..lol|`|25bab68b4289b0408fe71b2c88b50a62aa	Several years.    There are reports of woman who have been in a coma for years getting pregnant, (rape) and delivering a healthy baby.    Who knows if she is / was aware that she delivered a child. I cannot find a recent update to her story.|`|Z1atdG4kaa	This isn't personal but it happened to my friend. She was in a motorcycle accident and lost her baby. Then got pregnant almost instantly after and all the symptoms she had she assumed was her body coping with the fetus leaving her body. She had 1 month to go before the doc told her she was prego. Talk about rushing to get ready...I can't believe people don't realize it until they are in labor either although I have heard of alot of instances. I knew within 2 months of being pregnant with both pregnancies.|`|FYiLg6OAaa	I was wondering if anyone could help me... I have no money and it's late at night so I can't see my doctor... I have been having many issues with my body, and I've been searching on google for answers until I can get to my doctor on monday, when it brought me to this page. I have symptoms that would mean I am atleast 5 months pregnant. I have never stopped having my period. It has stayed the same hasn't even changed by a day. I don't know what's wrong. I took 2 pregnancy tests a few months ago and both were negative. But being pregnant is the only thing I'm finding so far... Help?
bSkYYRrEaa	Cuz all those movies are about Chico State!!! :p|`|ynAXDyQDaa	Because most people wouldn't be interested in a movie about a guy who studies 24/7 to get good grades.|`|hqSDVWuKaa	true, true.... idk why though..... haha it's a good point! lol|`|QGkBZFqWaa	Not everyone's college life is the same.  Besides, movies about booze and sex would be alot more interesting than watching a guy make good grades...|`|cxVmq2kraa	Because there is NOTHING intresting or entertaining about watching someone study.|`|EriaXXVWaa	Imagine this. Coming summer 2010. Jack Sutherland is a college junior. He studies hard, attends all his classes, and recieves straight As. Follow his journeys as he reads his textbook and takes his midterm. Would you watch it?|`|al4qc3Ywaa	umm they make movies about college like that because they want ppl to think thats all u do and thats its fun and stuff. Also no1 would want to watch a movie wit ppl studying all the time|`|14pjwQPLaa	Because a movie about watching a kid study probably wouldn't make much money :-)     My favorite college movie is "The Paper Chase" (1973), staring a very young Timothy Bottoms, Lyndsey Wagner and John Houseman.  Granted, it's Harvard Law instead of "college", but the intensity of the studying and the strategizing for grades, etc. are spot-on.  "Rudy" is another favorite, although it's mostly about football, it also concentrates on how hard Rudy has to work to get into the school of his dreams.
0lnamekJaa	You need to figure out what is going on!    It is possible to have a fake-pregnancy if you believe it enough but I doubt that is happening... It is just too rare...    You may have been molested and were either drugged or are in denial and blocking it out...    If I were you... Iwould go to the doctor and tell them exactly what you told us and see what the doctor says...    PLEASE go to http://www.plannedparenthood.org and find a location near you... They will help you through this no matter what it is...|`|bpyx92GZaa	rapped or raped?|`|twVyisGnaa	If you really want to feel better about this, get a pregnancy test as soon as possible.    VIVA LA RAZA!|`|auRHZadYaa	go see a doctor|`|rDsKB0uXaa	insecurity|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	Have you been to a party recently where you were served a drink you didn't get yourself? I would definitely make an appointment with your doctor to get yourself checked out. At thirteen your body probably hasn't really regulated your periods yet and stress can easily cause a missed period. There could be other reasons for the rash and pain, but you really need to see a physician.|`|LbGRsCTKaa	You mean like someone "rapped" on your door?    Like they knocked?|`|iCKkOWI7aa	i dunno..... talk to someone|`|hwHJ1vzCaa	You didn't have a "dream". You had a nightmare. When bad stuff like that happens its a nightmare. But, you can try taking a home pregnacy test just to be safe. Hope this helped. Good luck...|`|ngeBdq3Maa	I'm thinking its puberty...|`|Li1mDuUDaa	That's odd, but take a home pregnancy test, just to be sure.  Good luck!  I hope your not pregnant! =]]|`|bvt9kvS8aa	Possibly insecurity in some aspect of your life!|`|uGezRb7Xaa	Did you go to a party or something where you stayed overnight? It could be nothing or your subconscious trying to tell you were sexually assaulted and you're trying to block it? Or maybe it was just a nightmare.|`|U1s25amAaa	Im sorry.thats really scary and creepy.and at 13?you could be pregnate.or your just scared and insecure.i dont ever remember having hazy dreams.you should talk to your mom or a doctor.you could just have had a dream, but it could have been real.im sorry, again.mabey you could get a home pregnancy test?!it could be puberty and the dream creeped you out so ur just making a big deal about it and over reacting and thinking your back hurts, and you could be eating more?idk about the rash tho.i hope i helped :) you really shoud see a doc.      P.S. tell us if it was a dream or not :)|`|KM6PDz5qaa	You probably did..Umm, see your Doctor, and get a pregency test.|`|FrNUIdF4aa	You really don't know if it was a dream or not?! Woah! That's weird. But yeah it sounds like your pregnant.|`|dMZEnWPnaa	idk wat u mean, did u have a dream or did it happend ? , eather wy talk to your parents !|`|nsIy1zfkaa	How the he!! do you not know if you got rapped! Get a pregnancy test. And if you are, trace back to what you have been doing for the last month, or whenever you got "rapped". And pay attention next time you get harassed.|`|ZUCkh7dmaa	Well first thing is first, Your period is irregular because you are thirteen, you look biggish and your breasts are that way 'cause your growin, rash on yor inner thighs means your using soap that gives you the hives, or lotion, and your leg has NOTHING to do with being pregnant.   I don't know about the back thing though, that could be serious! Haha just kidding. The real problem is, why are you dreaming about being rapped?|`|7YU9IreXaa	rapped  were you in a rap battle  i know when you get served rap battle style it can be very traumatic  im not sure about the rash maybe you have bed bugs|`|rCzGlz3uaa	you should go to a doctor for the rash. Also you should wear pads. You should not worry abbout being rapped because its just a scary dream. You should keep a good relationship with your mom she can help  you with problems like these.|`|96ojhoXvaa	I am not going to make fun of you b/c when I was around 16 and living at home I had "dreams" of my dads drunk friends being in my room and uncovering me in my sleep and all! One day I actually awoke to someone standing at the foot of my bed with my head on the foot of my bed and it was all fuzzy, and they crept out.  Still to this day I am not sure what happened.  My dads friends were very big drunks and not the best of people.  Be very careful in the places you go and the situations you put yourself, do not trust anyone with fixing you drinks or snacks! Take a pregnancy test, also I would see a DR about the rape b/c that is a very serious crime!|`|9mMXYCX4aa	i would ask someone who was in your [dream] if it really happened. PS check with a doctor a parent or friend   have u have sex latly  who would do that? like do u have a boyfriend?|`|hlq3Eo0haa	honestly i would go and speak to your mum and ask her to take you to the hospital, with this and before with your cutting problem,i honestly believe you need help and fast
2932ee4950edd4f131a711d029cc8528aa	At this age toys are education. Crawling helps with motor, and vision. Reading stories helps even the little ones that there is a time for calm sitting. Talking to your little one and singing songs with her will help with language development. Taking your LO out and about to the store or a restarunt helps them to learn how to behave in public (I'm not saying you won't have temper tantrum, but the earlier they are "out" the better they seem to behave). Toys, books, practicing pulling up and standing (cruising if she's there). Discipline... not alot if you've got it all babyproofed-- but knowing what no means is good. "Dangerous. The stove is HOT. Danger. HOT"|`|WxQFe0GYaa	I don't know what an 8 month old SHOULD be doing, but my son is 7 1/2 months old, and he plays a lot on the floor, he cruises around, plays with different toys, etc.  Usually, after meals, he'll sit in his high chair for a little while and I'll sing to him (songs or ABCs, etc.).  I'm just doing what feels right and natural.|`|8a5c549ea7fffbe40a9a737812632ec8aa	other than playing and exploring, i would just say read to her and get her interested in books and also singing and music. my daughter ( now 11 months) has this natural rhythm, it's so funny. any time a song or commercial on TV comes on she just bops along to the music. she's loved the itsy bitsy spider since she was a newborn and now loves Bingo and Thumbkin. She claps along; it's adorable! oh, also, take advantage of storytimes and gymboree type places. i regret that i can never take my daughter to these types of things because i work and they are always during the week in my area.
LrsYFnHuaa	The pediatrician can prescribe the same medicine they give for chickenpox (the same type of virus causes chickenpox and cold sores).     This will help him heal faster and also reduce the chance of passing it to your baby. The virus that causes cold sores rather serious in a baby.|`|70c1c2e410f2cdd8e3cd8235784e9689aa	BEG him not to touch it.  Otherwise, keep it moist.  But a lip gloss style chap stick on there so he doesn't have to rub it on the cold sore (it will hurt, plus germs).  Then see if something like Abreva or something can be used on a young child.  I would think just one dose wouldn't hurt.|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	Cold sores can be contageous at certain stages.    Today, there are over the counter salves which will dry them up in no time at all.  They are a little pricey but worth every penny.  You could give one of these products a try.|`|W85IdGzvaa	First of all, he cannot spread this type of herpes to his penis. Second of all, he absolutely can spread it to the baby's mouth so tell him he CANNOT touch the baby when he has a cold sore. This will help with the next part too.  If he cannot play with his baby brother, it'll bum him out.  But tell him you can get rid of it if he keeps his fingers out of his mouth!  Put Lysine on his little mouth (it's natural and cheap) every few hours and it'll be significantly better by the end of today and almost gone tomorrow. (I've gotten cold sores since I was little and I've tried everything as an adult, Lysine works better than Abreva and is only 3 bucks compared to Abreva at 15!)
ErQWfSPNaa	ok........... but whats the question?|`|8NxEtxqyaa	Um..... Well, days can change... I wouldn't freak out if you haven't done anything.
coVZ1uqCaa	Avery Kendall - Too feminine. In fact, both names are more commonly used for girls.    Paul Isaiah - I guess this is my favorite out of them. I'm not a huge fan of Paul though.     Rnn Kendall - Too many accents on the first name.    -----|`|MHhFMdWoaa	Rnn Kendall|`|DdjpQr0Gaa	Although I do love the names Avery and Kendall, I think they sound to feminine to be for a boy.  I think it would be alright as a middle name if you like.  Ronan Kendall is my favorite.  Ronan sounds like a strong name to me.|`|EIgmm8ilaa	Paul Isaiah is a very wonderful, strong name.|`|Elxuvon8aa	I like Avery Kendell as Kendell has been a fave of mine for a ling time.  although we have a extended family member with a dog named Avery|`|7drjpohUaa	I think of Avery as a girl's name. I like Paul Isaiah, or maybe Paul Kendall. Or maybe Paul Everett?|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	Avery Kendall, i would think it was a girl.  Avery is a top 50 name girl name.    Paul Isaiah is okay, my favorite from your list    Ronana Kendall is okay|`|pLD3pYsuaa	Paul Isaiah, i don't really like isaiah, paul i like but is whatever u like :)|`|oruWntCfaa	avery kendall put i think avery is more of  a girls name but i like kendall the best name ever EDWARD CULLEN ha ha|`|p0D4dxEqaa	Avery  Kendall    It's modern and when you say it out loud it sounds calm.|`|PuRpsENEaa	I only really like Kendall and Paul|`|ot0TqzSvaa	theyr ok but Avery is a girl name.    Ronan Isaiah is my fave|`|EXBMxFCKaa	I really like them all, Paul Isaiah would be my personal choice because Paul is a family name and Isaiah is gorgeous, but I love Kendall too so I'd be torn. All of the names flow very well but I think I'd go with Avery over Ronan, just preference.     Aussie: No, Kendall isn't feminine for any name, especially not Kenneth, to which it's not at all affiliated. Kendall is a masculine english name meaning "of the valley"|`|o9Ckf0h4aa	avery kendall is the best! All sound ok to me.|`|bT4npA7Jaa	I looooove Avery for a boy, though some seem to think it's a girl's name. I like Avery Kendall the way it is. Paul Ronan & Kendall Isaiah sound best like that though :)|`|ISRTiSnoaa	no. how bout dragoynnne Caliopius|`|TK5mhb1waa	Avery Kendall|`|WKH6t2MQaa	I like Rnn Kendall it sound like it goes well together|`|qhYPmnyraa	My son's name is Kendall and I love it, it, and Avery for that matter are very masculine despite being unisex in this day and age. I really like the sound of Paul Isaiah as far as "flow" goes but Avery Kendall is my favorite combination as far as preference.|`|H7kAHTyOaa	I love Avery Kendall, its easy to pronounce. Because going to school with a name that's hard to pronounce is difficult. It flows very well.|`|DycMrGuSaa	The third one is real cute :)|`|u3idZ9l9aa	Paul Isaiah. i like it.|`|nrQhVcy7aa	Avery Kendall|`|ZaUqhmFaaa	Ronan Kendall best of the ones you provided.    But if I had my choice of mixes, I'd do Avery Isaiah.|`|pUE6wNqXaa	My pick is Ronan Kendall    Ronan is a very strong name that stands out and is unique without being strange. Ronan kendall together is very nice together, but when you really think about it, how often will he be called by his full name?  Ronan with any last name sounds good.|`|LgLpJxnwaa	I shreik no when i see Avery kendall as a boys name.  I really think Avery is a girls name, and Kendall is the feminine version from Kennith.    I love Avery Kendall for a girl.    Paul Isaiah would be my fav for a boy.|`|ZGMsI5ykaa	Paul Isaiah. It is a biblical and very strong, firm name! I love it! Patrick Isaiah, I also suggest! Hope I helped! Superior name!|`|oqvssqRqaa	Paul Isaiah|`|2mhLJl11aa	Kids love to find something to rag on each other about. I wouldn't suggest a boy's name that has KENDALL in it what-so-ever. Maybe times have changed, but I really doubt so in this category. Maybe over in England it'd be good (after all, Mary and Barbara are boy's names there). Out of all three, Paul Isaiah is the strongest and most masculine. Just my opinion of course! If you really love the name, then I say go for it. But just be aware! :o)|`|J3ROtKo5aa	I like Avery Kendall but i like it better for a girl.  Ronan Kendall sounds ok without that accent thing
1ilfOgBjaa	I think you should not be spreading your inability to spell onto a new generation.|`|LdFgAPFxaa	i dont think you will be, if you have had your period a little bit, it think you'll be fine, but if he didnt *** into you, you should be even safer =)
ErQWfSPNaa	it could well be the heat wave (it sucks hey!) But I would call your doctor anyway as those symptoms could be pointing to pre-eclampsia which can be very serious.  Good luck through this shocking heat and with the rest of your pregnancy!|`|91b27b540655ebe4e66c72274b49dd33aa	could be either drink lots of water and see a docter|`|kaqPSgTVaa	If the swelling happened quickly you should call your doctor. Extreme swelling is a symptom of pre eclampsia. I think I spelled that wrong but it's not a good thing.|`|MslcyESfaa	How is your BP? Is there anyway you can take it?|`|tZU9k9zNaa	Did the swelling happen suddenly? If I were you I'd go to Labor and Delivery at your hospital for a quick evaluation.Dont wait till monday.This is a sign of preclampsia.I hope everything turns out okay.|`|TycCeqtaaa	its part of being pregnant. it will keep up until the baby comes. i suggest you take off any rings on your fingers off because then you'll loose circulation. i'm starting to swell too. and im 6 months lol.
LdFgAPFxaa	i think you should do whatever feels right, as for me im going down to victoria to go shopping =) i think the lau would be really cool tho have fun and happy birthday ?|`|cG2UKGQRaa	Well ... I dont like iny to be honest .But i have a suggustion :Try  to maybe pick a bowling party .But if i would choose id say a scrapbooking party.|`|3GWh9DcKaa	I think you should have like a rock-out birthday party or any other parties 4 music because music can really be awesome for a party!|`|hqSDVWuKaa	i like the idea of the luau, just go to orientaltradingpost.com and get stuff from there, but i wouldn't decide quite yet because your birthday is in a while, so you might change your mind.... good luck! and happy early birthday! =]|`|b3FkhOicaa	I like the luau!

zjsP15dpaa	I didn't put any real shampoo products in my daughters hair until she was maybe going on 1.  I used johnson & johnson, but as a moisturizer.  I used moisture max. Its pretty good.  I still use it and I use Optimum products for shampoo.|`|2932ee4950edd4f131a711d029cc8528aa	Time. I babysat for this little girl who couldn't even put a barrett in her hair until she was 2 1/2. Then it started to grow.|`|3hIr3Dllaa	no...there's no miracle product...    if there was, I'd use it on MYSELF :) (lol)    I know it's frustrating though...my daughter has some hair but not enough to put the cute ribbon clips in and I'm dying to
kbdkOPHDaa	well its possible to just be a little depressed because you know, you just had a baby....you dont feel the same naturally! i was 19 when i had my daughter and i was so happy with having her and all but i was so young and my body was RUINED i have stretch marks pretty bad and i am alot bigger than i was. i think the first child made me feel just fat and gross... but for me it wasnt really PPD, i think i just hated the way i looked.  after having my son 8 weeks ago, i actually feel really good! i mean i still have the marks and im even a little bigger than after i had my first, but i just dont care anymore. i mean my body is beautiful the way it is, im curvy and i look like a woman : ) my fiance loves me and my body and he said the love handles are his, because his children put them there. (LOL my son was 10 pounds so maybe that is why i felt so good when he was OUT)    so i think its normal to adjust to yourself after having a baby. your baby is only a month old! seriously give it some time. it will get better but if you have bad feelings then you need to make sure to talk to someone close about how you feel.    in the mean time, go get a tan and your nails done...i swear youll feel a million times better! go get some jeans than a maybe a size bigger than what you did wear. that made me feel better too.    i know im writing alot but i seriously understand how you feel i have been there... feel free to add me we can chat when you feel down!  and moms rock so love yourself, you just made life and its the most amazing thing.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	possibly, it couldn't hurt to talk your feelings over a little more in depth with a doc and see what they think....|`|2932ee4950edd4f131a711d029cc8528aa	It could be, I would talk to your doctor about it. Also if you find a new moms group (either a new mom support group, breastfeeding support group, or an infant meetup... www.meetup.com) you can connect with other mom who are going through the same things as you.|`|XN30YgK8aa	Sounds like some PD. PD is pretty normal and really common. You should see your OB and he can give you a prescription. It is better you deal with this now before you let it go. PD can get out of hand very fast and can have life threatening effects.  It shouldn't be taken lightly.|`|wFVLP5l3aa	my babies a month old and im the exact same way only i was getting fustrated with everyone as well as my son with the feeling bad as well so i went to see my gp and shes put me on antidepresents  i felt so terrile all the time like i was a horrible mother and ashamed at how i was feeling but the doc assured me that its nothing to be ashamed of lots of women go through it  iv always hated the idea of drugs to help things but my sons wellbeing is the most important thing to me so i agreed when my doc suggested the antidepresents for his sake.    dont feel ashamed at how you are feeling go visit your doc and they will be ale to help you you prob dont even need antidepresents just somebody to talk to. trust me it can make the world of difference    and try to rember that you only had your baby a month ago and that you will start to loose weight and look good it just takes time. it took you 9 months to put it all on it wont fall off over night  i try to tell myself this when i look in the mirror and sometimes it helps   im only 20 years old and i put on 28ks with my son lol|`|6jECbxIeaa	Yes, this is post partum depression
nzGdMWbZaa	I am sure you are ok :) Dont stress its not good for the baby.|`|i8Ch743Laa	I highly doubt you've miscarried hun. I'm pregnant after a pregnancy loss at 20 weeks. At that point,it's no longer termed as a miscarriage. So just calm down about it. You're fine,I'm sure. good luck!|`|JsshzKM9aa	Well first of all, stress is really bad for the baby anyways. So stop stressing.   If you haven't been bleeding and cramping, your baby is fine. Be positive!|`|yznZqcznaa	No a pregnancy test will be positive until you fully miscarry. At 10 weeks it could be weeks for your levels to go down to 0.  I would find a new Dr and get an ultrasound.  I am 7 weeks and have already had 2 by 10 weeks I will have had 3.  After 2 miscarriages I am very happy to know my baby is in there and kicking.|`|X0xHXDcTaa	I know exactly how you feel!! I miscarried in Sept 08, and just found out that I am 7 weeks pregnant. I am very excited but have been a bit worried! The stress and anxiety are not good though. So try to relax. Your body will do what it needs to do! If you miscarry a hpt will still read positive until the hcG level in your blood has dropped drastically! So the best thing to do is just relax and wait til you see your dr again. I know that is easier said than done! I would just pray about it! That always helps me! Congrats!|`|8c4kRTnPaa	Try not to stress hun, just have faith that it will all work out. I had a previous miscarriage as well and I was so nervous that it was going to happen this time around too. My midwife didn't see me until I was 10 weeks so I worried the whole time until I saw her. But we heard our baby's heartbeat so that was so reassuring.  Good Luck!|`|qgJDdCiHaa	Being 10wks, even if you miscarried, it takes awhile for your levels to return to too low to be picked up by a pregnancy test. When I had my miscarriage at the end of Dec-beginning of Jan, I had been bleeding since Dec but was still carrying the hormones. I didn't get the "all clear" until about another week and a half after that, and I was only around 7wks, so unfortunately there's no relief in that.    If you aren't having bleeding, things are still very positive for you right now. It's hard to feel safe in your pregnancy after knowing you can lose your baby. Before I had my first miscarriage, I thought all pregnancies ended in happy screaming babies, but unfortunately, our eyes have been opened to the contrary now. Try to relax as best you can. You've almost made it to the 'safe zone" 2 wks to go....you can do it....he/she can do it...just believe it will be ok.|`|7ZTlktMeaa	If you know for sure you are pregnant again the home test wont prove anything. Save your money... You'll need it when your little one comes. I would says, chances are good that you are pregnant & the baby will be fine. 1 out of every 3 pregnancies end in a miscarriage, I was told by my doc, after having one. I am now pregnant & @ 32 weeks! I hope everything goes well for you! You really wont be able to tell anything until you get that first u/s & are able to see your baby's heartbeat, which especially after having a miscarriage, is the BEST & one of the most emotional experiences thus far!!! Best of luck!!
sF3UyQsIaa	actually, its not cat poo or pee. its the litter. as long as she isnt around the smell of the litter, she should be ok. which is why everyone says never to have a pregnant woman change the litter. same with small critters etc... and you should look into the landlord thing. there is something they can do about it if it is getting complaints. if not, i would get the police involved and say that there is a pregnant woman involved. they would at least file something and talk to the landlord.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	No just gross smelling. You can always call the lanlord and complain.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	No, it's cat feces that harbors the toxoplasmosis gondii parasite which can cause problems in pregnancy. But, if the urine smell is that bad, I'm guessing there is probably feces built up in the house too. It's not an airborne pathogen though, she would need to come in direct contact with cat feces (like by changing the litter box) in order to contract it.     That's absolutely ridiculous the landlord refuses to do anything about the problem. That's disgusting. Does her neighbor have kids? I would probably call CFS on her for that if she did.|`|a3MSSvdcaa	no, it's cat poo that's harmful|`|Gr78AFvyaa	that's BS that the landlord can't do anything. she needs to call a better business buero or something because that is ridiculous. I don't know if its harmful but if I were paying for a place to live I wouldn't put up with that. pregnant or not.    EDIT: if the landlord refuses to do something about it call animal services..her neighbor obviously doesn't have the means or ability to take care of her animals and they should be given to somebody that can.|`|m2aznd8xaa	the land lord can definatly do something about it. and should when a tenant complains. i know it must be hard on your sister to smell that all day,and no she shouldnt have to just deal with it. the landlord can get in troulble for not complying. i say you look into it.|`|1ezYfkX7aa	If i was paying rent to live somewhere you better believe i would not be putting up with cat urine smells when i dont even have a cat. I would first speak to the people downstairs about it and then if they dont do anything and the landlord doesnt i would call the better business on them and be looking for a new place live. I wouldnt be bringing my newborn home to sit and smell that, its awful. Not sure it can harm her while pregnant but i cant see that it would be doing her any good to smell that.|`|w2uktQyBaa	I don't think it can harm her other than making her sick to her stomach.  Has she tried to speak with her neighbors about it?  She could always use her pregnancy as an excuse and say that her sense of smell has really heightened since becoming pregnant and that the smell is making her vomit constantly.|`|AA11185954	The really bad urine smell is mostly from the ammonia in the pee, which can be harmful in large doses, but may not be from her situation.    She should request to move apartments within the complex if the landlord won't do anything about (free of charge), maybe even bring the law into it and get a court order to have the other apartment cleaned or get her a new place.  Not sure if that is possible, but worth a shot for sure.
16XpYCBmaa	Once you become pregnant you stop having your period. you may get some implantation bleeding but it is very light and may only last like a few days. And if she was 5 months pregnant I think she would know by now that she is pregnant. But if she still thinks she is pregnant then tell her to take a test....good luck to her.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Have her take a test?|`|m2aznd8xaa	no i dont think she can be 5 month . she would have a belly and feel the baby moving by that stage. how old is she. is she on a birth control because birth control can do that to you.|`|o1yy6KABaa	if she was 5 month pregnant you would know.|`|BHgtqH9Yaa	She should know if she is 5 months pregnant! She probably isn't even pregnant, just tell her to take a test|`|QQI4rliYaa	nooooo|`|GaZscBiBaa	No you crack head. why wouldn't she just take a test?!!|`|v8JzqMDRaa	Ask her to go for a check and clear all the doubts.|`|Brkk1Tuwaa	A women's menstrual cycle can be thrown out of whack by a lot of things! Stress, change in diet, strenuous exercise, and many other things. A test would be the easiest way to resolve this but at 5 months prego, there would be tell tale signs. Bigger tatas, frequent urination, you would certainly feel the baby move, increased appetite, undeniable weight gain, among other things. You can google the symptoms for a more extensive list! Hope this helps.

DZedvrIraa	Prop a pillow under ur bottom after sex for 30 minutes   get a fertilityfriend.com account   chart ur cervical fluid  chart ur basal body temperature  have sex on ur fertile days  dont smoke or drink or do drugs  keep sex fun!!    goodluck and babydust|`|bWyKAFwuaa	Okay so I am TTC  2, I am doing everything!!!!  Charting days, cervical mucus, cervical positioning, ovulation predictors, pre-seed, instead cups, and clomid.  But with  1 I didn't do a thing, except have sex about 11 times in four days when I was ovulating...so I would say giddy up lol
AA11779376	The symptoms are pretty much the same as menstrual symptoms such as tender boobs, cramping, bloating....and so on. You should just chill out and try to relax because stressing can delay your period. Pregnancy tests aren't a big deal have your bf get it for you if your not comfortable enough to buy it. that's what I did lol I'm sure he's dying to know as well.    I hope all goes well with you!    -Edit- Also for the symptoms part.... For me sex started to feel really uncomfortable about 2 or 3 weeks after I got pregnant.|`|p0prrzf2aa	i didn't noticed my symptoms til it was close to my period. i have acid reflux bad it's so annoying. but just keep in rythym with your body and if you notice anything different you could be pregnant..some women don't even have symptoms except for a missed period|`|kaqPSgTVaa	It usually take 3-4 weeks after sex to get nausea. The biggest sign to look for to take a pregnancy test is a missed period. ;) Wait until then.|`|QQI4rliYaa	chill...few days get a test silly....if u r tho ur body feels different etc very tired... boobs hurt|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	It took me about 3 weeks after I was pregnant to start getting any symptoms at all. It could just be acid reflux, especially if that's your only symptom.|`|TX9igTWraa	i felt nauseas after two weeks. wait until you miss your period before you buy a test, because those things are expensive!!|`|1qlSzdK5aa	its REALLY hard to tell. Because some girls get symptoms as early as 2 weeks, some as early as 4 weeks, and some as late as 2 to 3 months. I didn't start getting my morning sickness until almost 2 months. So its really hard to tell. But throwing for no reason and then feeling fine after is a sign, and getting a light period sometimes is too when you normally don't. like i said, its hard to tell. you are better off getting one of those early as 5 days before pregnancy tests.    good luck to you.|`|hj9C9fN9aa	Don't be paranoid and if you are, take a HPT. I remember being paranoid and i had no signs of being pregnant until my period was late and sure enough i was pregnant. I did n't start experiencing any stomach pains, breast tenderness, until around 6-7 weeks and no nausea until around 8 weeks.  Good luck girl.  also some of the first things i noticed after an HPT were breast tenderness and there were more visibly veins, which surprisingly were a lot of my friends first symptoms too.
UUpsa35Daa	I think, it's none of my business unless they, themselves, involve me in it.    But my general opinion on the matter is... Yes, i do feel a tad bit sorry for the baby their carrying and hope that it ends up living a good life because of the fact they didn't ask for 2 teens to have sex and conceive them. They were put in the situation against their will. I don't feel sorry for any of the mothers or fathers to be, whether it was intentional or not, because if they're having sex...they should know pregnancy is always possible and they put themselves in that situation.|`|ojTcrqAOaa	Its bad..  but my mom had a baby at 17, and shes fine(:  And a great mother.    It wasnt me:P  It was my older brother.|`|QGkBZFqWaa	Yeah I think it's pretty unfortunate.|`|Qc3bu3ioaa	its pretty weird but my mom had her 1st kid @ 15!so! wat da hek!|`|qn9NilP3aa	18 is way too young. By getting pregnant, one is likely to throw their life away to raise a child that they mentally, emotionally and financially  cannot properly take care of, especially if the father won't take care of the kids (it does happen, unfortunately, especially if the father is also 18 or younger.)    I would say wait until at least age 24-30 to have a child.|`|YVRXdfGHaa	I don't give a flyin' flip how old you are or how many babies you have. Just don't ask me to pay for 'em. If you can afford it, go ahead. But don't take money from me ( taxpayer ) to support your stupidity.|`|bSkYYRrEaa	Yesh, we yall do.|`|23fDrmZoaa	age has nothing to do with how good of a mother you may be and if you will or will not be able to take care of your children. I am 20 years old and I have a 2 and a half year old, yes i had her at 17 and i am pregnant with my second child. I do not see it as being bad tht i am getting ready to birth my second child becuase I am fortuante enought o be able to take care fo what i create it is only bad and irresponsible if you cannot take care of what is yours or if you just do it to feel loved like some of those teenagers you see on maury.|`|rUQAGz9kaa	I dont think its bad , teenagers already act older as it is whats the different between having a kid now and later besides not having your own home to raise them in ?    Its not like you can say their immature ,some teenagers are even more mature than adults that have children.Maybe its a little immature of them for having sex so young but thats it.|`|Emputg1taa	Since not many kids tha age have the financial means to support a family, I do think it is irresponsible. It doesn't make them 'bad' parents though. It just makes them irresponsible.
49f06b796d54e170c36a6cf4fc463182aa	Yes you can buy formula with food stamps.  If somebody receives food stamps then they automatically qualify for WIC as well which gives babies formula so you can use the foodstamps to buy other food that you need.  From the age of six months they also give baby cereal and juice.  Then at the age of one they give milk, juice, cheese, eggs, peanut butter or beans, and cereal.      You should call your local WIC office for an appointment.  I know you will qualify.  They will want to see proof of income, residency such as an electric bill, and a birth certificate.|`|76nTvO4iaa	Check on WIC, too.    If you qualify for food stamps, you should qualify for WIC too.|`|h59Bc4wfaa	Yes, they do. Also, if you are getting food stamps, you can also get WIC. You atomically qualify for WIC because you get food stamps.|`|bf2b826fb186efa4963970654d24ac34aa	yes|`|rjVALevtaa	I've never been on food stamps but I don't see why they wouldn't. If for whatever reason food stamps didn't cover formula costs, you can always apply for WIC (and if you qualify for food stamps you'll definitely qualify for WIC) and they will give you free formula.|`|F08HDRvraa	Yes, food stamps covers baby formula, and baby food.  If you qualify for food stamps, you should qualify for WIC, which provides not only formula, but some food items for the mom as well.  Ask your food stamp worker and they should be able to give you a telephone number to contact to apply for WIC.|`|i8NOVfm0aa	you have to ask your case worker or call the number on the back of the card and ask a customer service agent. get wic! i have it and its great.|`|CEpsmUmraa	if you dont have money for formula,  breastfeed ;0)|`|mTyu7CKoaa	yep i was amazed by it too|`|9vzfI4kDaa	they should  did you or do you qualify for WIC?|`|rJ7QfQ0Raa	yes, they most certainly do.|`|4yUUUkAsaa	Yes food stamps work for anything except alcohol, tobacco, and nonfood items.|`|WwafMKN4aa	yes it does..|`|jC1Mdsefaa	Yep they do!!  thankgod!!  also if you need help with getting formula (* or practically anything for baby*)  WIC helps TONS!!!|`|EPnsbdOpaa	no food stamps dont but wic does i work at a supermarket we get this all the time|`|MslcyESfaa	yes, but if u qualify for food stamps, you probably qualify for WIC.|`|et3OzeiLaa	I'm not sure if it is different from state to state but in tn it does. However you should go apply for wic they will provide formula and you'll have the extra money to spend towards food!!!

It will help you time when you are ovulating and the best times to conceive.It will help you be able to understand your cycle better and look for signs of the cycle.   My Doctor recommended it to me and after 1 year of trying I got the book.  It worked the very next month.  It turns out that my timing was wrong due to mis-information.  I hope it helps you, too!  It's not only about getting pregnant.  It's about knowing your body and knowing when you are fertile or not.  You can pick and choose what you do with your info.  Good luck and don't listen the all the myths|`|AA12151452	i don't think so never heard of that.|`|AA12060447	Prenatal supplements are just like vitamins only double and extra vitamins needed for healthy development of the fetus. If you're having problems with your cycle maybe you need to go to a gyn and discuss how you can get them more regular, and make sure there isn't something more serious going on with your body.|`|AA11188099	I believe the only thing you could take to make your cycle "regular" would be birth control. But since you are planning for a baby, it sounds like you're not taking birth control.  Since prenatal vitamins are really just that, vitamins, I doubt that they would change your cycle.  Best bet would be to call your OB/GYN.|`|eb8df000eded28b5f45277ee569be1f8aa	Anything that improves your diet and well-bring can halp regulate your cycle. The extra iron and calcium in the pre-natal supplements could have replaced what was depleted from your system.     Then again, even reducing the stress in your life by doing something healthy can improve your general fertility.
59b3663495b976ad7f27acbbb79a8b5caa	No, I've had 3 children and I am 27 weeks along with my 4th.  I have been offered this test but I've never taken it.  I don't care anything about this test.  See it's just stressing you out.  Now if the test results arn't what you wanted them to be, what are you going to do?  To me, this test is just added stress in your life that you don't need being pregnant.  When the baby is born is when you can see if anything is wrong but I am sure that you'd still love it the same!  I've also heard that this test is not the safest thing for your little baby in there.|`|0841ac317a9c384196ddb88713e00e06aa	I took the test and it showed I had a 1 in 8 chance of having a child with Down Syndrome.  I chose not to have the amnio, because it would not have changed the course of my pregnancy.  My son was indeed born with that extra chromosome.  However, you should know that the triple screen test does have a relatively high false-positive rate.    As a side note, I can tell you that having a child with Down Syndrome, while not what you are expecting, is an incredible experience.  Every parent I know with a child who has Down Syndrome thinks they are a gift from God and that having them has improved their lives greatly.|`|AA11682165	Please don't stress over this. I had the test done when I was 25 weeks later. However, the results were irrelevent b/c my son was born a week later. ( yes, a preemie) Anyway, the test is just a formality. The only reason to truly be concerned about an amnio is if you were an older pregnant woman. Just think, when your mom had you, the test didn't even exist and you came out fine. Just relax, If, God forbid, the test resluts came back positive, you have the right to refuse the amnio. Justrelax, I'm sure everything's fine.|`|AA12056184	go see a doctor they will help you, if you have any doubt, they will make you feel better.|`|AA11599430	just keep good thoughts . good luck|`|AA10133791	hmm exactly why are you having this done have u taken the time to read up on this subject I HEARD THIS IS A BAD THING TO DO! DID YOUR DOC SUGGEST THIS? if so i think you need the opinion of another doctor.. please go read up on this matter before it gets done unless it to late!|`|AA10984959	I personally refused this test when I was pregnant. I know a lady who had these test, they said there was something wrong with the baby and she selected to abort. Well after the abortion they did an otopsy and there was nothing wrong with the baby. She has been in a deep depression for years since. I think it's all a matter of choice.|`|AA12366625	You should consult some doctor for more advice.|`|4bf3af300c574cf8f4f133f38afb5eb8aa	He lo  So this is your first time sorry to see you have to go through all this if may I ask amnicentises I have never heard of it strange I have seven children and I never heard of that word amnicentises I will look it up on my medical book of (Dr Wrights books) family medical books please dont be to scared everyone has to go through all that I had four operations ceacerian operation so dont be scared its alright you be alright dont worry to much about it once you get your results every thing will be ok|`|AA10220975	Even if the test comes back positive it doesn't mean you will DEFINETLY have an amnio.|`|AA12184098	I had it with my son and everything was fine.  Just remember, if something doesn't seem right, it is just a screening and alot of time with the triple screen something abnormal comes up and scares the parents to death.  When the amnio is done, a good majority of them find that everything is fine with their little one.  Good luck, there is no better feeling than that of being a parent!|`|AA11851613	I will also tell you that the test can have false-positives and false-negatives! I had the AFP  screen done and it came back that everything was fine. My son was born with Down Syndrome.     If the test results would not change what you do about the pregnancy then i would not risk the baby to have the amino done. Although DS is a life adjustment it is also a wonderful experience and the joy of a lifetime.
b85f1b7ccd23446e1adaf9f0ebcb79b9aa	You are just a little past seven months. You have 9 weeks to go and that is a bit more than 2 months. That is going on the 40 weeks being counted from the first day of your last menstrual period. If you go from the likely day of conception, then you go 38 weeks.  Since not many women know the exact day of conception, your gyn-ob probably goes with a 40 week calendar.|`|e41ee900f0db147dffde02bb9ca9ef9aaa	There are four weeks in a month.

Although typically it is 40 weeks. I have had my girls at 38 weeks, 40 and 36 weeks. you could have 9 wks left or less or even go to 42 wks. It just depends on your body|`|a49fd68495c13992e9a5d341c8d8956eaa	7months 7days|`|1a4be5a66cf64a81fce17f75bff35be2aa	Average gestation for humans is approximately 39 weeks. So you have a bit of a ways to go.     It all depends upon how you do the math.  A month is 4.3 weeks.   31 / 4.3 = 7.2 months.    Some people just round down and say a month is 4 weeks (28 days) in which case: 31 / 4 = 7.75 months.    I would be more inclined to calculate it in weeks and calculate the percentage of average time: 31 / 39 = .79 or 79 percent complete.
AA12378413	More than likely it was to early, you should usely wait until you have a missed, so that the Hcg can build up in your blood.|`|AA12220887	You are normally fertile 14 days after the 1st day that your period starts.  Yes, it was way too soon to test.  Wait until you miss your period and then try it again.|`|AA11236050	A blood test will show you are pregnant 6 days after conception.      When can I take a pregnancy test?      The most asked question of any woman who is wondering if she is pregnant or not is How soon can I test? The answer to this question varies depending on what kind of test you buy. Before we go into the different types lets go over how they work and what they are looking for.    How do they work?    No matter what kind of Pregnancy test you buy, they are all looking for the same thing: HCG hormone. Human Chorionic Gonadotropin or HCG, is a hormone found only in pregnant women and is frequently referred to as the Pregnancy Hormone. The purpose of HCG is to keep the estrogen and progesterone at appropriate levels until the placenta has developed enough to take this function over. HCG production begins around 6-10 days after conception, when the embryo starts to implant itself into the uterine lining. Levels of HCG double approximately every 72 hours.     At-Home Pregnancy Tests    At-home pregnancy test are considered to be very accurate with a low occurrences of false positives. If used correctly they are about 98% accurate. The standard pregnancy test is only useful the day of your expected period or sometime after. It is best to use first morning urine since the levels of HCG will be concentrated and easier to detect. If you get a negative result but still not getting your period, you should wait a few days until your HCG levels have doubled and try testing again.     Early Prediction Pregnancy Tests    For the woman more anxious to find out if she is pregnant or not, there are at-home pregnancy test which are more sensitive and can detect lower levels of HCG than the standard at-home test. Most of the time these are more expensive than your standard home pregnancy test.     Since every woman is different and they produce different levels of HCG, there is not an exact day you can test using an early predictor. These more sensitive tests can pick up levels of HCG starting around 8 days after conception. However, HCG is detectible in the blood serum of only about 5% of pregnant women 8 days after conception. So remember, a negative result may in fact be a positive a few days later. Most early predictor tests say they can detect pregnancy about 10 days after ovulation (about 4 days before your expected period). However, the earlier you start testing, the higher chance of getting a false negative.     Blood Tests    Blood tests given by your doctor or lab are the most accurate of all of the tests. They also can detect a pregnancy sooner than any of the home tests. There are a few drawbacks of the blood test however, the results usually take a few days depending on the lab and they are more expensive. Blood tests can usually detect pregnancy about 8 days after ovulation (around 6 days before your expected period). Most doctors wait to give you the blood test until you have received a positive home pregnancy test.       Points to remember when using a home pregnancy test     * Try not to test to early. It is best to test once your period is late.    * The earlier you test, the more likely to get a false reading.    * HCG levels double every two days. If you get an negative test, wait 2 days before retesting. This will help you save on the amount of tests you use.    * Although many test say you can take the test at any time of the day, it is best to use first morning urine. This way, the test will get the most concentrated urine of the day. If you can not do this, try testing at least 4-5 hours after your last trip to the bathroom.    If you buy things offf of the net go to http://www.pregnancytests.com and there you can buy tests that claim to show you are pregnant 6-8 days after conception.    Good luck to you|`|AA10229056	Have you missed a period yet?

AA11864107	Each pregnancy is different. The bumps may appear for the first trimester and then go away or they may be there thru out the whole pregnancy, along with other tale tell signs- you nose may increase in size, you feet and legs may swell, your neck may turn darker then the rest of your body,and etc... . The most important thing to remember is it will be over in 9 months. The focus is a healthy baby you will love and take care of. You can overcome all the changes your body will go thru.|`|AA12363313	They can do either mine came and went but i have some friends who've had stayed... it's all normal.|`|AA10091662	do you mean the outer lineing where the oil glands are? they usually stay because the are keeping the nipple and areloa "soft"|`|207823303bb97d2aa7dac65b73e92d3aaa	they are called montgomery glands...they keep your areola soft|`|4b1a74846f1afcc6a250ec162e3f7202aa	mine came and went  .some people they stay every pregnancy is different.
AA11278617	Yep. It is very possible. I think it is a little harder for the women....just depending if you are into that type of thing or not. There is a little bit of pain the first time mainly then it's no as bad. But you need to be relaxed during the process or it will hurt more and you'll clench up and have a bigger chance of a rectal tear.....|`|AA11820208	Yes.  it is possible.  Yes.  Is does hurt for a little while but after you get into.... it is a whole different experience.  Try it.  Then try it again, you will like it the second time I promise.|`|AA11098414	Yes, it is possible, for both men and women.  You must be careful though and be sure to use a condom and lots of lubrication.  It is a situation to be eased into as it can be painful and cause rectal tears.
AA12058912	I'm a nutritionist, i don't see any reason you couldn't drink coffeemate during pregnancy (as long as your are not using The sugar free kind which is contraindicated during pregnancy)    BTW to all these people that keep saying caffeine is bad for the baby I need to point out that caffeine is a class B drug its the same class as tylonal and has not been show to cause any harm during pregnancy|`|e8d8092076df47bacc74aecc932c82f8aa	by coffeemate, are you meaning the whitner that oyu add to coffee or actual coffee?|`|61f85114683375bfab07e547221445a4aa	my doctor told me that caffine was bad for my baby.... maybe every once in awhile .. but not every day.|`|AA12021064	talk to your doctor.|`|AA11923443	Caffeine is NOT good for your baby. Doctors say no more than one soda with caffeine or cup of coffee a day if you cant cut down all the way.  That means no soda with caffeine, tea, or coffee. You can have chocolate but only in moderation. Motherisk recommends that caffeine intake by pregnant women not exceed 150 mg/day whereas OTIS stated that moderate caffeine intake of 300 mg/day (equivalent to about 3 cups of coffee) does not seem to reduce fertility in women or increase the chances of having a child with birth defects or other problems. Caffeine can enter breastmilk, and high amounts can cause the baby to become wakeful and agitated. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that nursing women limit caffeine intake, but states that no harm is likely to occur in a nursing child whose mother drinks one cup of coffee a day. OTIS recommends that pregnant and nursing women drink plenty of water, milk, and juice and not substitute those fluids with caffeinated beverages.     Because the systems for breaking down and eliminating chemicals are not fully developed in the unborn child, blood levels of caffeine may remain elevated for longer periods in the unborn child compared to the mother. OTIS (OTIS 2001) notes that, "...higher amounts of caffeine could affect babies in the same way as it does adults. Some reports have stated that children born to mothers who consumed >500mg/day were more likely to have faster heart rates, tremors, increased breathing rate, and spend more time awake in the days following birth."|`|AA12340453	drink decaf coffee, but i thought coffeemate was just added to coffee as long as its caffeine free you should be fine, plus caffeine can just make your child head smaller and or make your child very hyper active
