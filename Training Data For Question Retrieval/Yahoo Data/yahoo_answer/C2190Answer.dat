IxjDznLgaa	No!<br>  Because, you'll need that masterball for Cresselia or Mesprit, the wandering pokemon. Those two are SO hard to catch without a masterball. I found Cresselia was the hardest.<br>  <br>  You can easily catch Giratina without a masterball.<br>  Just save the game right before you go into battle with it, and make sure you have atleast 40 ultra balls (just incase) or dusk balls (those work REALLY well in caves). Weaken it as much as possible and paralyze it/put it to sleep. Then ultra ball/dusk ball away! <br>  Simple as that :)<br>  And if you end up killing it by accident or your balls run out (which isn't very likely), just shut your game off and you'll come back to where you started.|`|7oZv4KMhaa	use it on cresselia

I am an American and my husband is a Canadian.  We live in Canada but go to the USA often, so we cross the border often!  I also purchase most of my fabrics and craft supplies from the USA.

All of the dough recipes you will find are easy to use with children and do not require a large amount of ingredients.  Hope this helps.
q1Fav370aa	It's a tricky system, but this is how it works. You get a diamond every 10 kills or so. Diamonds buy weapons. You spend diamonds in each class, and each diamond you spend is saved in each class in Ranked matches. Confused? Okay, so long as you stay in the server in regular matches, you can continue to spend diamonds on your classes. Spend one diamond in the sharpsooter class for a new rifle, and the rifle is bought and the diamond is saved in your class. What this means is next time you have a diamond and you want to buy the 2 diamond flare gun, because you already spent a diamond in the sharpshooter class before, you can buy the flare gun with the one diamond you have because you will spend 2 diamonds in the class. So next time you have 2 diamonds spent in the class, so with one more diamond you can buy the rifle that costs 3 diamonds. So even though the total costs of the weapons is 6 diamonds, you can buy them all for just 3 diamonds.   However, leave the server and your progress isn't saved so you have to start allover in a new match. In Ranked matches, your diamonds spent are saved, but be sure to spend your diamonds while in game because if your diamonds aren't spent before the game ends you may lose them. I'm not sure if this is a bug, but now you know.

AA12145054	Sonic the Hedgehog is a platform game developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega for the Mega Drive/Genesis system. It is the inaugural game in Sega's flagship Sonic the Hedgehog video game series, and was the first title developed by Sonic Team. It was first released on June 23, 1991 in North America, and the same day in Europe. The Japanese Mega Drive version was released on July 26, 1991. It is sometimes retroactively referred to as Sonic the Hedgehog 1 or Sonic 1 to differentiate it from both its main character and sequels in the same series.|`|4wtHZBqpaa	Mega Drive!!!!!!!!!    sonics awesome|`|3Ptf8E3yaa	Mega drive i think :S dont take my word for it tho|`|Sv3oNOggaa	It was for Mega Drive first.|`|HlkwHLxqaa	Sega Mega Drive/Genesis   First Sonic the Hedgehog game 1991|`|HYrRkTjQaa	the megadrive in 1991

25a903128a710f9935672e9f69763d85aa	I like Dollar Tree. Some stores carry the paper which is fine, I like the cheap page protectors ( 10 for a buck) Big Lots sometimes carries cheap supplies too but not lots of choices. Use magazines or the online scrapbook sites for ideas. Really, it's your book. Do what you want. <br>  <br>  Favorite suggestion for newbies, JOURNAL! Don't just put 7 pictures on one page. Pick up 1 - 3 pics that go together, pick the paper that kind of goes with it, use a title of some kind ( even if you just handwrite it on the page) and then document in journal the who, what when why or how of the pictures so you don't forget the info for later. <br>  <br>  Embellisments ( the extra stuff) are fun but can cost you big bucks) Focus on your pictures.. they are why you are making the book right? <br>  Good luck.|`|AA10949869	Out of those 2 choices, definitely Michaels...|`|nWjbtatdaa	I remember when I first started out -- it was so exciting. I was sure that I wasn't going to be scrapbook crazy like the other women I was cropping with --  Yeah right.  <br>  <br>  Now I own an online scrapbook supply store.  I offer 10-20% off everyday retail.  Check out my website to see if there is anything -- as scrapbookers we can always use more of anything LOL. <br>  <br>  Here's the web address:<br>  2daughtersscrapbooking.com<br>  <br>  Most of the new stuff from CHA is coming in -- already have Basic Grey, Anna Griffin, Dream Street Papers, Paper Trunk, Webster's, My Mind's Eye -- Fancy Pants,and Creative Imaginations are due in this week.<br>  <br>  Check it out, and if you have any questions about scrapbooking in general - just email me.|`|glyi7k2caa	If I had them close, I would probably choose Michaels.  But here's another option.<br>  <br>  I don't have access to craft stores, so personally, I'm a big Ebay fan.  Not only can you get great deals, but you don't have spend lots of time and gas obtaining supplies.  Also, it's a really great place to see others scrapbook art that's up on auction.<br>  <br>  If I can't find something on Ebay, I look for other online sources.  The internet is full of resources for products and advice.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|GEVFL6iRaa	I am a new scrapbooker myself.  Sign up for online newsletters from Michael's and Jo-Ann's for weekly coupons.  I never purchase anything without a coupon from either store.  Look at their sales fliers to stock up on items.  Also, look at www.scrapbookpal.com for some great deals on products.  And Big Lots has some surprising deals.|`|WTovnDwQaa	Check white pages online for your area or type scrapbook and your zip code in your search bar.  You'd be surprised how many small store there can be locally.If the is Hobby Lobby in your area, check online for their coupons, you can print them yourself.|`|iAuqXEsoaa	michaels personally. <br>  <br>  by the cheap things like yarn there is a lot you can do woth it.|`|ZUeulrPwaa	From myself!

gOQ5mZ7Xaa	I agree I got a PS3 from the day it was out, recently bought a 360, PS3 is much better in my opinion. The only to break one without dropping it from a two-storey building is overplay it. I broke the laser leaving GT5:P on pause for a week and Sony replaced it under warranty and I was playing again in two weeks. Not too bad. Exclusives are better quality than the 360 as well. I'm having trouble finding games for the 360. And note to the fanboys, Xbox LIVE doesn't "own the ****" out of PSN. It's just that paying PSN is the only way you can defend against the fact that you paid for it...|`|27f80d3a98f55a846a83e5d74639661eaa	The only things I don't like about the Xbox 360 is Xbox live costs and yes, I have heard that they do not have a very long life. I just got mine recently. It's the arcade version so I've got to buy a hard drive but, I don't mind because the console was only $200 and I can get a 20GB hard drive on ebay for less than $50. I really don't care about the PS3 because of how expensive it is. So, what I'm saying is that I like the Xbox 360 better that the PS3 mainly because of the price. But, I would take my Wii any day over both of them. At least I don't have to choose between my 360 and Wii, lol.|`|BttUGexOaa	360 for me... but you should buy the one your friends have... because its amazing playing online in gta or other games with friends... besides 360 has xbox live which owns the shyt out of ps3|`|JDLEBC3eaa	Xbox 360|`|uoIV59V6aa	360 OWNED ps3
diPu1Vncaa	For infernape i suggest you teach it Focus Blast instead of Close Combat and since it has a 90 accuracy than get Wide Lens in Veilstone Game Corner in the house with prizes to boost the accuracy.<br>  <br>  You should teach flamethrower to Lucario instead of Blaze Kick cause it has bettter accuracy.<br>  <br>  You should teach Torterra either Leaf Storm or Frenzy Plant<br>  You should put either weavile or Electrivire on your team<br>  <br>  Overall I would give your team a 9.4 out of 10|`|ihOIHE5Aaa	That's fukcing awesome!

gOQ5mZ7Xaa	PS3 has all of those games except for Halo, but it also has exclusives that are better than Halo and the Xbox 360's other killer app, Gears Of War 2. Resistance 2 springs to mind. 60-player online FTW.|`|DOVbF4Piaa	The xbox 360 is the only one with Halo|`|5a4dVSvIaa	I'd get an Xbox 360, because it will play most of your old Xbox games. Also, Halo is exclusive to the 360, and Gears of War is also a fairly good game for the 360.  <br>  <br>  The 360 is also cheaper than the PS3, and Xbox live works far better than the PlayStation Network.|`|TfcQc0fmaa	PS3, Xbox360 may have more people playing but everything on the PS3 is way better plus like 60 people online in 1 match is so awesome...

QT6iRQNaaa	For finding out how much it is worth, I would recommend the Price Check forum on RarityGuide.com<br>  <br>  Many coin collectors hang out there and someone might have an idea of how much that coins is worth.|`|iuurJCzTaa	1861 LIBERTY SEATED QUARTER<br>  <br>  Collector Value: $25-$350 Depending on condition Most likely $25-$75<br>  DO NOT CLEAN IT!<br>  <br>  Cleaning an old or rare coin will deminish its value greatly. If you decide to sell it, take GOOD photos and provide the date, name and if it has been cleaned. Do not offer YOUR opinion on condition, collectors will do that for you when looking at your coin to buy and buy/bid accordingly.<br>  <br>  The prices I quoted you are from the members area of NGCcoin.com.|`|zrKuaiDLaa	That is very cool! I have some old Indian back nickels. I am not sure about your coin though! Check ebay for a price RANGE! Try to find some local coin collectors, (if trustworthy!!!) to get an estimate price.<br>  Other ideas: <br>  Search the web!<br>  Go to the library and see if some material on this subject is obtainable. <br>  <br>  Selling: Be careful about selling! Get a really good price estimate before selling, so you don't get ripped off! I hope it helped! <br>  P.S. I wouldn't mind being selected best answer... Sorry to be rude but I really need points!|`|l2ma3RYraa	it is going to depend upon the condition and the mint mark<br>  since it is a quarter i am going to assume that it is silver<br>  i am going to guess that it called a seated liberty<br>  <br>  once again it will depend upon the condition and mint marks<br>  could be anywhere from a few bucks to maybe 1000 bucks|`|OoYldnAsaa	Need to know the condition... that's a big factor in value.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://andoyanjewelers.com/info/Coin_Conditions_and_Grading.html" rel="nofollow">http://andoyanjewelers.com/info/Coin_Con...</a>|`|dZ3B2vNIaa	Save it maybe a year longer then sell it.

So are date and mintmark. The mintmark will be below the eagle on the reverse, (the eagle is the reverse, the seated liberty figure is the obverse, front). Once you have date, mintmark, and learn to grade, then you can look up the value. Go to library and get a copy of ANA grading standards or photograde, those are the best way to grade a series of coins since they show you pictures of coins in various grades. If you do not want to, find a site online that teaches how to grade. With that info, you can go to pcgs.com and look up relative values.|`|dgXs1Y2faa	I would need to know the condition the coin is in. If it is in a very very very amazing condition it might sell for around $1,600. If it is not that good and in a pretty bad condition it is worth about $20.00-$40.00. The mint mark doesn't make it much more valuable. Only a few dollars more valuable. If you want to sell it go to a local coin dealer.

jjDZJmfpaa	What crafts do you do well?<br>  <br>  What is it that you like to do?<br>  <br>  Personally, I thought making and selling perfume would be fun to do until I saw how much it costs to get the right fragrance oils and to know the difference between what a fragrance oil is and what are essence oils I knew this would be more than a notion to do. I also had to research as to the different notes that make a good fragrance. There is research in developing a good fragrance and did you know you can get a recipe to make perfume online?<br>  <br>  So that was on hold for awhile and I thought about making soap. People like to have natural things including washing their body. Then I saw that the more natural a soap is the more things that are in the soap that will clog the drain. Can you imagine the complaints from that?<br>  <br>  I finally settled on crocheting different blankets and garments from instruction rather than taking requests. People are picky when you are making something rather than them purchasing off of the rack. I sew too. Children's clothes are easy to make and don't take as much fabric to do. Also making purses seems to be all of the rage in high schools these days contrary to what Prada thinks. I hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Know that whatever you do make sure you are insured. The insurance lets people know that you are serious and they think twicew before suing.|`|0rpN2419aa	Making jewelry is lots of fun!  You will be suprised at how creative you can be!

a4LGeeI9aa	Well it's a strategy game. Telling a story is pretty limited when the story keeps getting interrupted with intense tactical gameplay. But so far i'm finding the campaign story and gameplay very entertaining.<br>  <br>  Regarding the base building dissapointment.<br>  I'm at work now so I can't confirm, but I googled dawn of war 2 forums and came upon a site that was discussing multiplayer, and which units to build first and when to place down powerplants, etc. It sounds like multiplayer provides a limited opportunity to build a base.
bJqS9GYOaa	See the movie,   Most of the movie is based on the character build of Afro Samurai, and the heightened emotions of the main character.  The whole movie is really nothing but sex and violence.   That is what the writers wanted.   The game is based on the amine movie.  So its not surprising that the game also has sexual themes.

I have no idea what GTA 4 is but I can tell, at the rate things are going, it will come out soon. last, I would probably get a game that you can enjoy after you have already beaten it. EX. after I beat Metal Gear Solid 2 I didn't want to play it again because it follows the same plot over and over. I would definately get a game like Mario Party where the characters always do different things. your welcome. wish you luck.

Sfhq7Pkhaa	Video games don't make someone 'weird' or 'not-normal'.  Their jaws drop because most girls don't like video games they think they are boring.  I am a girl, who people wouldn't necessarily look at my as a stereotypical RPG player.  I play WoW in fact.  I play because it's just more exciting than shopping, sports and texting.

WAOkgdj6aa	God no, the game is TERRIBLE. IGN Rated it 5.9 out of 10. Here is a clip from their review of it.<br>  <br>  "Sadly, the repetitive nature of the Entrencher can be applied to everything in Fracture. The levels, story, boss fights, and more all involve doing the same things over and over and over again. The story's broken up into three acts -- San Francisco, the southwest, and Washington D.C. -- but there are no chapter tags or subtitles for the act parts. That means you're just killing everything on the way to your radar-marked objective, and when you get there, you repeat the process after a quick save that often causes the screen to stutter. It's like you're just running through one excruciatingly long level."

XrGFZ2LJaa	Hi.<br>  <br>  No I haven't played the demo of Empire: Total War, I already pre-ordered the game a month ago. I will just wait for it to be released :) There's only 11 days left for me, unfortunately Australia gets their stock on March the 5th (latest in the world).<br>  <br>  By the way, Persians didn't exist in this period of colonization and imperialism (1700s-1800's AD). The Persians were a power of the Middle-East around 1500 BC. So far, the Swiss haven't been confirmed as playable or unlockable. Here's a list of factions you can start with, only one space remains.<br>  <br>  * Great britain<br>  * France<br>  * Spain<br>  * Sweden<br>  * Prussia<br>  * Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth<br>  * The Ottoman Empire<br>  * Marathas<br>  * Austria<br>  * Russia <br>  * United Provinces (Dutch)<br>  * Unknown?|`|RJghPceKaa	terrible loading but thats about it<br>  <br>  its a really good game, even though i likethe campaign parts of tw games better than the battles<br>  <br>  naval battles are awesome especially if you have a good graphics card|`|XQOB6eaUaa	played it<br>  <br>  it's really cool<br>  <br>  naval battles are cool but sometimes chaotic|`|pa6N30V3aa	no
LOY18BKRaa	The power of sequels ?|`|mePPZXAsaa	because for the movie resident evil 2, 3 , and 4 sucked major balls. The games are wicked though!|`|bbecdbkQaa	After playing the demo, fans seem to be split down the middle as to whether they liked it or hated it.<br>  <br>  Alot of people think the controls are clunky, or outdated, or that RE5 plays identically to RE4 and that Capcom haven't tried hard enough to upgrade the series for next-gen consoles. <br>  Some people don't like that the series is no longer survival-horror, but rather it's action-horror now.<br>  Others don't like the forced co-op. <br>  There seem to be many reasons why people think RE5 will be a flop.<br>  <br>  I personally can't wait for RE5. I had fun with the demo and can't wait to see how Wesker and Chris's story will pan out in the game.|`|WAOkgdj6aa	Because what happends is: When a brand starts to sell a lot because the first few games were amazing, and there are a lot of fanboys that will buy it because of the name... it doesn't matter what the quality of the game is... because fanboys will say it's amazing and buy it anyway. This is why a lot of newer games with brands that sell a lot (such as Guitar Hero World Tour) are GARBAGE.<br>  <br>  Oh, Also because it would never compare to Dead Rising 2 and Left 4 Dead.

rjbmPrwPaa	Some places in your town are known as "dead land".  Basically you cannot plant anything here and expect it to grow.  The best idea is to cut down an already existing tree and dig a hole in that exact spot.  Then just replant with whatever tree you would like.<br>  <br>  For coconut trees, just find a normal tree that is near the beach and repeat the process that I listed above.|`|62mt0VKJaa	Not all places in your town are fertile.

sV2mmEadaa	Well I wouldn't buy any of them without first buying the first one, Guild Wars: Prophocies, and in my opinion, that is the best one. I own all of the Guild Wars expansions, and there is not only one, there is Prophocies, Nightfall, Factions, and Eye Of The North. If you don't have Prophocies, there is no point in getting Eye Of The North. Factions is the least favourite among most people and the expansion with the least sells among all of them, but if you plan on getting all of them, I would get them in the following order. Prophocies, Nightfall, Eye Of The North, Factions. It just fits in better. I am pretty sure that you will be lost on any of the expansions if you have no knowledge about Prophocies, hope it helped.|`|ttYZ2Vwuaa	theyre all great and all worth it.<br>  1 being the best and 3 being the lest great this is the order.<br>  1.guild wars prophecies<br>  2.guild wars factions<br>  3.guild wars nightfall<br>  Id get them in this order <br>  proph<br>  eotn<br>  factions<br>  nightfall|`|z9c8VsRfaa	They are all good in different ways. I find Prophecies to have some cool missions and a lot of people playing it. In Factions you get to level 20 very quickly plus you get to do Alliance Battles which are lots of fun, as well as getting the Assassin and Ritualist. Nightfall has some awesome areas in it as well, it gives you the Paragon and Dervish professions and also the ability to use heroes which are quite useful. Eye of the North is very good but I think perhaps a little bit more difficult than the others, but it is only an expansion, you will need at least one of the three campaigns to play it. That being said, it really comes down to personal preference.|`|aTwBOyBraa	This is just a personal opinion, but I beleive that Guild Wars: Eye of the North would be considered the best. It has all the features of it's predecessors, plus an extra 2 classes. However, there will be a Guild Wars 2 coming out, though I have no idea when.
8ffEy0RSaa	If you mean boots of lightness, i think you need to do temple of ikov quest for them. If they are desert boots, really easy 2 get on grand exchange.<br>  <br>  2.

Level 3 are from monsters like green dragons( level 87) and higher levels. If you need help Runehq.com has a full guide on there website. <br>  <br>  Hope I helped!

FJeHg6Mxaa	First off, the most obvious should be set up an account recovery option. 2nd, make your password something difficult. 8 characters or more, with alternating capital and lower case letters, and try to include a number or two and try not to use words from the dictionary. Know what are scams and what aren't. If someone starts asking for your password to do something for them, decline and report them. If they ask to trim your armor or cut gems for you or lead you into the wilderness as an escort, decline. But most of all, just use common sense!<br>  <br>  An example of a good password would be this: $H@bo1g3N

Magic Kingdom gets decorated, including the castle. which looks incredible at night. and the decoration are location specific. so at Epcot each country gets decorated in that countries traditional flair. and each one tell stories of their holiday traditions. like there is a story of the three wise men in mexico, etc. Animal Kingdom is probably my favorite... because it is so unique. all the ornaments are animal, animal patterns or hand made to go with the theme of the park. really cool. oh, and a lot of the shows, parades are switched over to a holiday theme.<br>  <br>  The Magic Kingdom offer a special Very Mickey Christmas even on certain days during that time of year. its a "Hard Ticket Event" which translates to "You Need to Buy A Separate Ticket If You Want To See It." The park closes early (around 6pm) and then they re-open the park to people with the special tickets. you are given a bracelet to identify you from other guests. the rides are open and they have special photo opportunities as well as special themed shows.|`|cCAGstnpaa	I have never been there before, but I heard that all four parks are extremely awesome!|`|Ir51Eb0Kaa	I was there in mid January and the weather was absolutely perfect. The earlier you go in the morning, the less lines. However all in all the lines were not really bad. This was a couple of years ago, with the way the economy is now I don't think lines will be bad.<br>  In the evening at the Magic Kingdom and the Epcot Center there is a fireworks show which I highly recommend seeing.<br>  Have fun ?

You can get banned and loose out on everything.<br>  <br>  Here's a suggestion, play it yourself.|`|JCOALBwfaa	Here are your two options:<br>  <br>  1.) Level an account up like everyone else did.<br>  <br>  2.) Get a life.<br>  <br>    Seriously. Just train up or leave Runescape.

PWQSCgDDaa	Why is the question in video game section? Anyway to break your addiction first get rid of all yur Twilight stuff where you can't see it. Don't do anything involved with it and ignore stuff that has to do with it (exg. This question) If u do it u should forget about it and if u remember eventually forget it.|`|L3VbnH1faa	Don't try to get rid of it cuz that's the worst thing you can do. Eventually it will go away if you just leave it alone...of course it may come back worse than before. take me for example...i've gone monthes without twilight and now suddenly it's back again!|`|B2PW3sUKaa	that's what i did too for a while. just try to convince yourself it's just a book and nothing else. do something else to occupy your time with...|`|rjbmPrwPaa	Start reading other books.  After awhile you will try to act like all the characters in all the books you've read.  By that time you would be like yourself again.<br>  <br>  Kinda a hard question to answer though. :P|`|ymuLw18vaa	read different books<br>  maybe find something you enjoy and are interested in<br>  find a hobby or something to do to distract yourself- something to do|`|GfXhyUBZaa	You have problems.|`|gaVhPGWhaa	get over it. twilight is stupid. who wants to "model their life  after bella"?|`|JI1EpWX6aa	I guess you can try reading another book series to get your mind of it. Hang out with your friends so you can realize that VAMPIRES AND WEREWOLVES ARE NOT REAL! even though sometimes I wish they were. Anyways the point is start hanging out with your friends and read a new book series or listen to music just do something to get your mind of Twilight. REMEMBER ITS NOT REAL!!!!!!|`|uz6z6kxUaa	I had a friend that was the exact same way with Titanic, she was obsessed with it.<br>  <br>   For now you just have to obsess about it, but itll eventually pass.|`|ukymQZSvaa	try reading another book/movie can u answer my question<br>  <br>  help with confidence any1 pls help? is my question <br>  <br>  search it on the search for questions bar|`|kvKQAKxsaa	i have the same problem. i can't move on either. but i love the book/movie.|`|XMjdZBmmaa	Why don't you try reading something else that might be interesting? Maybe try a different genre of books.|`|OqvMI3S6aa	me too...man|`|konr3GMVaa	same here!|`|gxpeKrOtaa	Why not trying to read other books? Cirque Du Freak is such a great series, and far better than Twilight in my opinion, though I loved Twilight. You could also try re-reading the book. My friend read it a second time, and realized that it wasn't what she first thought it was, and realized it was just a book. <br>  <br>  <br>  Also, and I'm not ripping on Twilight or anything, but even reading what critics have to say might help you. They know what they are talking about, and know what to point out about the book.|`|F0RnaAUvaa	watch different movies and tell your friends if they have seen it to not talk about it if someone starts talking about the movie then change the subject try to get into a better and exciting movie. I never say the movie twilight but all my friends have and they keep on talking about it and it is pretty annoying.|`|CsrOiFqmaa	ok now what you have to do is throw the book and movie away and just act like one of your friends intil you get an idea of how to act normally

n7KrgqHYaa	The ps4 will come out maybe 2010-2113. The x-box 720 is the same. The Wii 2 is crap. Dont buy. If i were you, Waiting 2-4 years might be to long. So just buy a ps3 or 360. I have a ps3, i like it to. Good graphics and new games are coming out soon. Like Call of duty 6 Modern warfare 2. Also, Halo wars is coming out on 360, but i think strategy games require a mouse to play, not a controller with 10000 buttons. The prices are not going down either so just buy something now. I recommend Ps3 #1. 360 #2. Wii is for younger people. Hope i helped. = ]|`|WAOkgdj6aa	Why buy a 360? Unless you just want to play Halo and Gears of War, get a PS3. PS3 will last you a lot longer where as the 360 will break very fast, overheat (regardless of all the fanboys that say the 360 now has the Jasper chip in it), and scratch your disks. PS3 is a blu-ray player which will be relevant for a very long time and is also good if you have a high definition TV or will be getting one in the future. The 360 also requires you to pay for online, so that's pretty much the selling point to get a PS3 as the online is much better and FREE on the PS3. The menu system is much simpler on the PS3 and more organized than the 360. The games are either released to both consoles or have similar titles from the PS3 to the 360, except the 360 has all the old garbage titles that released before the PS3 did. If you are looking to waste your money, buy a 360. If you want more value for your money that will be relevant for a long time (even when the PS4 is released in however many years), buy a PS3. It has a Blu-ray player, wireless controllers, uses bluetooth and overall a better system. The 360 has too many hidden costs and will break on you and become obsolete in however many years the new Xbox releases. Hope that helps.

ee0d5392d404921277604008a24d4060aa	Well, if you like single player shooters or action games, go for Bioshock (which is incredible, beautiful, and just AMAZING), GTA (not actually a shooter, but there are guns, and it has a great story), Left 4 Dead is pretty crazy (and not single player)... <br>  <br>  <br>  Also interesting - The Orange Box (Portal has a great story- really weird and puzzle-ish, but great - Half-Life is really interesting - and Team Fortress 2 is a really different and interesting multi-player game)... Dead Rising is a lot older, but hilarious, especially if you like zombies. Oblivion and Fallout 3 are interesting action rpgs with insanely large worlds.<br>  <br>  <br>  And of course, Resident Evil 5 is coming out soon, and THAT will be AMAZING!!

AA10726404	The basic answer is no.  Casinos have subtly changed the rules over the years to make it harder to beat.<br>  <br>  Any time you are playing against the house you are going to lose in the long term.|`|0koKzeVEaa	People really have no idea. Yes you can make money if you do want to study but only if you want to study. Don't just go oh im going to go to a casino and win $5000 tonight.<br>  <br>  With blackjack the odds are with the punter. Don't listen to these fools blackjack hasn't changed much at all.|`|sbMQDiTiaa	Yes, you can make money, but you can also lose money. Played correctly, blackjack gives only a very small edge to the house, so the chances are around 48% to win. A good blackjack strategy can be found here:<br>  <a href="http://www.casinators.com/strategy/blackjack.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.casinators.com/strategy/black...</a><br>  <br>  Those who constantly win more than they lose are card-counters, and they use techniques to remember what cards were dealt and have a clue about what cards are left in the deck. If you are a good card-counter and have deep knowledge of the game you can overrun the house edge and have more than 50% chances to win, that in the long run can make you big profits.|`|AQELdkXlaa	<a href="http://allanswering.moowuz.com" rel="nofollow">http://allanswering.moowuz.com</a><br>  A very informative website, kindly stay in website and check

AA10144233	Well, I own both the games and they are okay. But I prefer Oblivion more. It has more realistic than Fable 2, but Fable 2 is neat in how you can own property and have a wife. But the wife is a hassle (not being sexist, its the same for husbands im sure) and property is too easy to get after awhile of getting money, then you get 200000 every 5 minutes, even when you 360/PS3 is off. You see where im going with that?? lol. I like Oblivion better also because it more open ended and longer storyline. More side quests. You actually get armor that works lol, in Fable 2 you only get clothes that do nothing for protection. Now im wanting my Oblivion back lol. I borrowed it out to a friend. If you dont have either and were wondering which to get, get Oblivion first. Trust me. Then once you are bored/done with that get Fable 2.|`|PdwWTrGSaa	Fable 2 I would say is a little better in some ways but it does lose in other places too<br>  <br>  <br>  in fable 2 there are more range of types of weapons i mean you can use guns with swords|`|8HIybjKXaa	oblivion easily, its one of the best games ever, you can spend 150 hours on it without completing everything, and still have tons of fun|`|EN5felveaa	Fable 2

I believe I already emailed EA about it. Maybe someone will come out with a patch for it. Would be awesome.<br>  PS ... I even tried placing the hotel desk and changing the lot zoning back to resedential, but then the desk because "un-clickable"

JMK6fRV2aa	Unfortunately, what you ask for is unrealistic. The file size is too huge to be playable online. It would most likely run only at 8%, which nobody would put up with.<br>  <br>  The only way you are going to play the game for free IS by downloading. The only games that can be handled online via websites, are small flash games, that only last a few minutes, and are simplistic in control. <br>  <br>  If you want to play it for free, the only help I can suggest is to download via torrent file. thepiratebay is a well known trusted torrent site. ALWAYS check comments just in case though.<br>  <br>  You don't want to download though, and so your only other options are: Buy the game yourself, or have a friend dump their files from a cd, to your computer. Unless your friend knows what they are doing, that last option is unlikely to work anyways.<br>  <br>  -------<br>  EDIT::<br>  <br>  If your computer runs the game too slowly, it would be even worse online, if any servers could even handle that. <br>  <br>  If you want the game to run faster, you need to update your RAM, or delete some files to make some room on your computer. RAM is what makes your computer run faster. Maybe your friend will get it back on your computer if you get your computer to run faster.

That means one dead char real quick.

WAOkgdj6aa	No, Super Smash Brothers will never be released for the DS as the game would be too big and too advanced to release on a DS cartridge. Also, since Super Smash Brothers is regarded as a fighting-style multiplayer party-game, the game would be useless and would not sell. Most people have 1 DS to a household and since the DS multiplayer is almost non existent with the DS having low-range wi-fi, it would almost be impossible to connect to another player to play against them unless you have a friend with a DS and you want to play with eachother. <br>  <br>  Basically, since the game is 95% based on multiplayer, the game would be useless on the DS.

U3Wi5FAdaa	AC is a amazing game, the main story is a bit confusing, but it does not take away from the gameplay at all, i would never even compare crackdown to AC. everybody that i know includung me has said that it was one of there favorite games. i definatly suggst it.|`|VWILDaYPaa	assasins is fun addictive but short<br>  crack down is too fakish but still fun and long<br>  buy crackdown if ur not getting another game in a while.assassin is overall more fun though. but im a violent guy hu likes stabbing random people in the back tho so........|`|62mt0VKJaa	assassins creed|`|YbIiwut7aa	Assassin's Creed got higher critical reviews, but it depends on what you like. Assassin's Creed is fun but fairly short. Comparatively, Crackdown is a sandbox game (meaning there's a lot of exploring the world other than mission play) - it's basically grand theft auto but with superpowers. Actually, it was made by the same developers, so if you liked GTA, you'll like Crackdown. Crackdown can get repetitive, but so can Assassin's Creed. Personally, I think Crackdown is both more fun and more addictive, but it's up to you. <br>  <br>  Also, Crackdown is cheaper - I bought it for 12.99|`|vwsO7Pv8aa	Assassin's Creed is too easy and too much of the same thing, but it's still fun imo. <br>  <br>  Never played Crackdown, so sorry for that.|`|qdmsWtLkaa	Assassin's creed is great|`|89cbb8981bec096d1ad9f9f6ad042c7baa	But assassin creed it has great graphics and its awesome game!|`|PJelxn5Xaa	ASSASSINS!!!!

83UXfyAaaa	The map is huge especially the cities. I remember there is like 3 main cities and one main town or something and the countryside is huge too. The bad thing is most of the places you go in the city are similar hence the term reptitive comes in. The game is hugely reptitive especially the missions but the storyline is great and the graphics is the best out everything.|`|Si68nlUjaa	its big its fun and hopefully they come out with a second one... it gets boring so replay value i would say is not the best... but get it anyway cuz its totally worth the one time game play...

KiVENZoBaa	You need the Hook Shot in order for you to continue your journey. <br>  First head towards the Village near Death Mountain. Once there, enter the graveyard and pull a gravestone that has 3 green flowers in front of it. There are two of them so the one you will be looking for is when you find the ghost in the hole. Walk up to the ghost and then you must follow him in order to get the Hook Shot. This gets very tricky since he moves pretty fast and throws flames on the ground, which is supposed to help you if you avoid running into them. Once you obtain the Hook Shot go back to the Lost Woods where Saria was supposed to be. (you can teleport there) by using the melody Shiek has taught you). Aim the Hook Shot at the branch above and you will enter the Forest Temple.<br>  <br>  Good Luck! Email me if you are still having some problems.|`|C7rV71Cjaa	You suck your momma's cock at night and like to finger yourself with your dad.|`|mOAY4FbJaa	One note: Do NOT keep the Giant's Knife as your weapon because it will shatter after only a few uses.  Even cutting GRASS can break it!<br>  <br>  The Forest Temple is in the Sacred Meadow in the Lost Woods, exactly where you met up with Saria as a kid.  As an adult, you won't have Saria's Song to guide you to the temple, so you need to memorize the path you took through the Lost Woods as a child to reach the Forest Temple.  The path is the same in both time periods.  As an adult, though, you'll run into Mido, who will not let you pass as he is keeping a promise he made to Saria.  Play Saria's Song to prove that you know her, and he will let you pass.  However, on final approach to the temple, you have to defeat a MONSTROUS Moblin with a giant sledge hammer in order to reach the temple.  To defeat it, hug one side of the path; when it begins swinging the hammer, immediately cross over to the other side.  Approach the Moblin in a zig-zag pattern until you get close enough to slash it with your sword.  It will drop to one knee; you can stay close enough to hit it as it gets back up, but timing is critical or you'll be knocked backwards about 30 feet.  You need three hits to defeat the Moblin and reach the temple.  You'll meet Sheik and learn the Minuet of Forest.  Look around for a one-eyed statue; play the Song of Time to unleash a fairy to heal yourself before using the Hookshot to pull yourself up to the entrance of the temple, where you will find the Fairy Bow and a phantom version of Ganondorf.<br>  <br>  You may want to obtain the Scarecrow's Song before trying to reach the temple.  If you talk to the scarecrows at Lake Hylia as a child, you can make up a melody of eight notes.  If you play that same melody for the scarecrow at Lake Hylia as an adult, it will become the Scarecrow's Song.  At certain places where Navi hovers green, play the Scarecrow's Song to summon Pierre the Scarecrow, and latch onto him with your Hookshot to reach places you might not otherwise reach.  Using the Scarecrow's Song will allow you to reach the Forest Temple more easily as you can bypass some of the giant Moblins (except for the one with the sledge hammer) and use the Hookshot to defeat them stealthily from above.  Good luck.|`|k3cmetWRaa	Go back to the Kokiri Village (Where you started from).<br>  Go to the Lost Woods.<br>  Saria will be there.<br>  There is a pattern you have to figure out to go through the Lost woods.<br>  Once you are through you will have to get past some Ogres, then you will find the Forest Temple.<br>  <br>  This is one of my favorites, you have do alot of rotation is this temple, so have fun....|`|ee0d5392d404921277604008a24d4060aa	Go back to the village you started in.

Also this requires you to do this with 3 other people in your group and each of u get a ghost and finish the level ( the hardest part is the final part with using the ghost to escape Halo ) So far this achievement gives 0 points, but Bungie explained how if u do this particular achievement before the next update, you will get something special ( could this mean recon or a new armour or even getting the mythic pack before everyone else for free? ) <br>  <br>  Vidmaster Challenge: Brainpan <br>  When the mythic map packs come out you must find all the skulls on them to get this achievement complete.<br>  <br>  Vidmaster Challenge: Lightswitch<br>  Possibly the easiest one of all, get to Lieutenant in any playlist with the new EXP Progression System.<br>  <br>  Vidmaster Challenge: 7 on 7<br>  On the 7th day of ANY MONTH u must have 7 EXP in any playlist and simply join that playlist and boom u got it! <br>  <br>  in a couple moths when the mythic map pack is realeased therel be a couple more. and therll be a couple on halo 3 odst. thats about it. good luck my gamer tag is Aden Verda.|`|R9tUWsXnaa	You must prove to Bungie that you are worthy of holding it.

They require you to level-grind for long periods of time. MapleStory, compared to RuneScape is better, but if you want a really good MMORPG, try getting a game called GuildWars. There's a huge fan base and player community, great quests and party systems, plus it was made by employees who quit Blizzard Entertainment (Blizzard develops the popular game World of Warcraft). By the way, there's also no monthly fee. The game runs cheap now, you can probably buy it for under thirty bucks.|`|R7AYASQRaa	mabinogi on nexon.net is better than both of those. for one thing its 3-D and theres no pointless grinding to get to the next level|`|DmdvmZl6aa	prepare for the fanboyism and hatred from both sides on the other<br>  <br>  And runescape's graphics are actually improved a lot now.

I felt these were all a major waste of my time.|`|IzN0nv9caa	I like World of Warcraft.<br>  <br>  Scott<br>  <a href="http://www.SmartWarcrafter.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.SmartWarcrafter.com</a>|`|s2Y2Xyg3aa	Atlantica and Space Cowboy are alright.<br>  Pay to play games are worth more of your time though.

They have forums too with friendly, helpful people. Sign up with the link below!<br>  <br>  tinyurl.com/rewards1-freebie-source|`|AA10144233	Im sorry to burst your bubble but nothing is free. Unless you get it from a friend..or theft, which is illegal. Even those ads on sites promising free stuff you have to subscribe to a bunch of things, equaling or exceding the cost of the item.

6qGY4cljaa	You can't download that for free.|`|AA11707728	You might be able to find some site that illegally hosts image files for a Fallout 3 XBoX 360 disc.  Then you could burn a copy of it.  However, such discs only work if you mod your XBoX.  That involves buying a special chip (also illegal), ripping out the old one and replacing it with the new one.  That has a substantial risk of turning your XBoX into an expensive paperweight.|`|J03Qy5aoaa	There is a way involving steam and PC but that doesn't do anything for you so NO..... furthermore if you like the game BUY IT.

zmapclE1aa	Erm i won't go into detail as i probably won't win  best answer however to evolve a pokemon thats needs top trade you don't need to trade it! Go to the GTS and put your pokemon up for trade (Gengar) for another pokemon that can't be obtained, such as Level 1 Regigigias. Then trade for any pokemon such as Level 23 Bidoof. Once you have made this trade take out your pokemon (Gengar) and he will evolve, trust me it works i used it to get my Gengar, Alakazam and Porygon-Z. However i did once lose a Haunter because someone used AR to get a Level 1 Regigigias so only do if you are going to be quick. Ok? <br>  <br>  Actually i will give you one or two suggestions.<br>  Firstly you have a lot of ice weakneses so i suggest getting a Special or Physical Sweeper that learns fire moves, although i don't really know is there is one. You could use a Lucario as he is Steel, Fighting and both are super effective to ice.<br>  <br>  Lucario@ Life Orb<br>  Adament<br>  Evs 252 Att, 252 Hp, 4 Spd<br>  ~ Earthquake<br>  ~ Swords Dance<br>  ~ Close Combat<br>  ~ Extremespeed<br>  <br>  Or <br>  <br>  Lucario@ (Not sure soz)<br>  Modest<br>  Ev 252 Sp.

127766aa9c415a074e2f444c6c56e4b4aa	Not a free one. A world coin website is very large and expensive to put together and maintain. Also coin collectors are still in the books days. We still use reference books and price guides made of paper. It was not until last year that a few world coin books became available on DVDs, it made it easier on me for I did not have to tote around a 2,000 or so page book that only covered 100 years. If you do not have a large amount I could help. Also some library's have the standard catalogs of world coins.
a6FK5F5Oaa	I think that Garry's Mod might be the perfect game for you if you want the sandbox style of LBP with the customization that the PC platform brings.<br>  <br>  Garry's Mod is a sandbox game that is relatively similar to LBP because almost all content is user created. It is different from LBP in a few ways though.<br>  <br>  - It is first-person and 3-d rather than 2-d side-scrolling.<br>  - Gameplay in Gmod does not always have a objective or a clear end<br>  - Gmod allows for a unbelievable vast amount of customization because you can not only build contraptions and other structures with the tools in-game, you can modify the core game to expand in gameplay vastly. For example, many "role-playing" servers exist for Garry's mod where you live and interact with other players realistically in a way that suits your character's personality. These servers have settings ranging from Half-Life 2's city 17 to tropical islands and even space.<br>  <br>  <br>  Garry's Mod is $10 and available through Valve's Steam program.<br>  <a href="http://store.steamgames.com/" rel="nofollow">http://store.steamgames.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://garrysmod.com/" rel="nofollow">http://garrysmod.com/</a>|`|ULbkPIGdaa	There is nothing like Little Big Planet for PC. LBP is an exclusive title to the PS3, so it's not going to come out for the PC.

If you aren't familiar with the gameplay style of Modern Warfare though, you'll have some trouble until you get used to it though (only takes a day)<br>  <br>  <br>  You should get it.  I had a good amount of difficulty on normal mode.  It is well worth it.  Getting to play as the Russians and the Americans.  (They need to make more games as the other Nations as well though)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I think that Call of Duty needs to make a game where you can choose a major Nation, and play as them throughout the game though.|`|8CtqfHgoaa	It mainly uses call of duty 4 features but worsened it a bit.

AA10232254	No specific date, but March 2009. <br>  <br>  Straight from the Wikipedia entry:<br>  <br>  "On February 10, 2009, Activision and Treyarch announced that downloadable content (DLC) was under development for World at War. The first installment of DLC will include four new multiplayer maps. Nightfire takes place in the ravaged streets of Berlin, Knee Deep involves several destructible Japanese fortifications, and Station consists of the damaged remnants of a U-Bahn (underground rapid transit system). The fourth map, titled VerrÃ¼ckt (German for crazy), is an addition to the Nacht der Untoten map on Nazi Zombies mode, and includes new weapons and power-ups intended to expand the experience. The DLC pack will be released in March 2009 for the Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 versions of the game.[35]"|`|AA12116047	idk if they ever are.. do you know for a fact that they are coming out with any. cause if they are. i dk when|`|A57BtbRDaa	This may answer your question<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIQkAgbbptw" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIQkAgbbp...</a>

The Big Corporations want to make more money.  you can play all games from say xbox on a pc i'm not going to get into the details but its possible. the xbox 360 on the other hand is possible  but you need a pretty beefy computer to handle the ( non existent emulator) to run the games. but as for say sony's ps3 vs Microsoft's 360 is hardware  there not powerful enough to run one others games in the format that's on the disks ,, it just wouldn't makes since to each of the platforms running it. and to emulate a 360 on a ps3 or visa verse .. is for lake of a better word .. impossible.. just wait for fable II to come out ..  should be ( my guess )  around Christmas.. why Christmas.. so they can make .. cough cough  more money =P i'm pc all the way i have an xbox 360 but it fails in comparison to my pc.|`|jPEoiWkGaa	It would never happen because the game makers are all out to make money.

QaJGkXp2aa	Two very different games and I've played both. Fallout is deep and complex. It has a lot of story and seemingly endless potential for exploration. The subject matter can be kind of grim, but it's very engaging and I think one of the great RPGs of all time. It's an RPG gamer's game.<br>  <br>  Fable 2 is fun. It is a much more lighthearted approach to an RPG. Exploration is much more limited and the world is not nearly so open as in Fallout. It's more casual and funny, with a little depth if you choose to dig deeper, but nothing like Fallout. For me it's a perfect game to play as Winter drags on. The ending seems kind of rushed, making the game a bit less fulfilling overall, but still very worth playing.<br>  <br>  So are you in the mood for something deep and grim (Fallout) or something lighthearted and casual (Fable 2)?|`|NRhrO833aa	These Games are both Very excellent games. I have both however, and this is my honest opinion and fact: Fable 2 has a much different environment than Fable 3. While Fable to is in the forests and woods and caves, Fallout 3, you will see yourself out there in Desert ruins, wasteland [as expected of nuclear bombs ], and toxic water. Fallout 3 is more about survival and scrounging for weapons, armor, food [food and water that is healthy is very scarce], while as in Fable 2, you would often find yourself making money by doing jobs like Blacksmithing, Trading, etc. Fable 2 is seemingly shorter but is Definately worth your money because of the somewhat high replay value [Being Good the first time/Bad the second time!]. As far as difficulty, I would say that Fallout 3 is much, much harder than Fable 2, even on the lowest difficulty. Fallout 3 is also longer. Fable is feels more like an RPG because of the nice use of magical spells and, while Fallout 3 feels more like an FPS, because you use tons of guns and mechanical weapons. Overall, if you could, I'd Rent Fallout 3 first, but if you do not like, then try out Fable 2, or buy it on the spot if you get the chance. I hope this helps, and thank you for reading this :).<br>  <br>  Quick Note, You can fully create your character in Fallout 3, but only edit your character in Fable 2.|`|JneyGHfCaa	I liked Fable 2 a lot, but too bad it was so short of a game.  I say get Fable even though I've never played Fallout 3.|`|k7TLCP5Naa	in my opinion fallout is the better game. It has a great story, huge area (Washington D.C.) and great weapons, enemies, quests and a big variety of outcomes based on your attitude towards others (good, neutral or evil).<br>  Though fable 2 also has a good story-line and also has co-op. There are quite a lot of bugs and glitches that have to be fixed and the story is quite short.<br>  According to reviews of the two games, fallout 3 has the better reception, as well as being voted the game of the year by many magazines and websites.<br>  Metacritic (a renowned game reviewer) gave fable 2 a 89/100 and fallout 3 93/100.|`|vcZAoi96aa	I haven't played Fallout (yet) but from what I hear Fallout has a longer storyline. Fable 2 is shorter, still a lot of fun. After you beat it though there is not a lot to do except start over.<br>  <br>  I enjoyed Fable a lot but after I beat it I haven't played it since.|`|twHXC9Draa	fallout is HUGE<br>  fable is well fable it has a awesome story and i like it<br>  depends on the gamer big with sh*** story<br>  or mmm okay size with a good story?<br>  you choose lol get fable 2

3d649503cd0b980eb75794de4bc639e9aa	The closest answer I can get is this:<br>  <br>  A source of damage is a permanent, a spell on the stack (including one that creates a permanent), or any object referred to by an object on the stack (including a creature that assigned combat damage on the stack, even if the creature is no longer in play or is no longer a creature). A source doesn't need to be capable of dealing damage to be a legal choice.<br>  <br>  It's the ruling for Circle of Protection cards.<br>  <br>  That is what I think is a source.|`|X9kNbpnQaa	By saying a "source you choose", it is actually allowing you to select practically any single card. <br>  <br>  A source is anything (it is usually a card, though). It's a way of allowing you to target spells on the stack (instants/sorceries) AND permanents (creatures, enchantments, lands, planeswalkers, artifacts, etc). An ability's source is referred to in the ability's text. <br>  <br>  For instance, if you use Karplusan Yeti, it is the source of its damage and the other creature is the source of the other damage. If you use Shock, the source of the damage is Shock. If you use Shock Troops, they are the source of the damage. Since you choose a source, you can pick something that's not in play anymore (Shock Troops, for one)|`|82c09456498d17b7fdcbd55444c0d086aa	Usually, a source is a card. In this case, you can prevent damage from one source (one card) that would deal damage to you.<br>  <br>  For example, there is a Grizzly Bear attacking you and a Shock aimed at your head. Both these are sources of damage that are directed twoards you.<br>  <br>  Hope that Helped!|`|W487jubsaa	black

I use Steady Aim, Bomb Squad and I can't remember what else.<br>  But if you don't like to snipe I suggest an MP-40. Yours looks good but change Bazooka to Bomb Squad. Whenever you unlock them, use the Type-99 and the Ppsh.|`|IOshodopaa	My favorite is my sniping class. Depending on my level, Kar98k or Mosan Nagant with scope, Bouncing Betty, Stopping Power and Deep Impact. I use that on pretty much any map and currently my kill/death ratio is 1.68 i think.
VsRHii7xaa	Yes, you have ample time to beat the game. Granted, you probably shouldn't have rented(?) it; its  way more enjoyable to play all the side quests leisurely, leveling up your hero and having the land really grow to respect you and all...sorry i'm rambling. Bottom line-if you want to know how the story ends, yes, you have enough time. If you want to really play the game in depth, you should buy it.

Here you go:<br>  <br>  1. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4zgKjaeVp4" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4zgKjaeV...</a> (This shows what you should do when you beat Cerberus).<br>  <br>  2. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB6fXeRWPQs" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB6fXeRWP...</a> (This one shows the path to the next boss, Necromancer).<br>  <br>  You know, You Tube is an incredible way to solve many issues related to videogames. For example, if you want to get all the items in Castlevania Circle of the Moon, put in the You Tube Search Bar "castlevania circle of the moon walktrough" and you will find a lot of videos showing you how to do that.<br>  <br>  Well, I hope I could help you.<br>  <br>  Take care.<br>  <br>  Bye!|`|2q5wZI3waa	<a href="http://getinanswers.sogutonualabalik.com" rel="nofollow">http://getinanswers.sogutonualabalik.com</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website
eeb898bd256e45f62aa2f9354d7b958baa	MY personal favorite has been Portrait of Ruin(PoR). I haven't  played  Circle of the Moon(CotM), but I would say that's the second best even w/out playing. Order of Ecclesia(OoE)  is the latest but plays like Aria with the soul collecting thing. There's no link between the 'good guys' from either story other than a passing mention that the hero from OoE is from a simialr group as Charlotte from PoR.<br>  <br>  Since you already have CotM, get PoR, it's better than OoE.

If you're just going to play games like Brain Age and My Weight Loss Coach (which I think are great games [have them]), then there is no need to get a DSi. If you think you'll be using the dual cameras, DSiWare, AAC playback, and web browser, then get the DSi.<br>  <br>  Using "My Weight Loss Coach" and "Brain Age" on my DS Lite was fine, so just get the DS Lite.|`|bT4P5F2yaa	It think it is great! I have two ds lites and I am trading my black ds lite into GAME and getting a black dsi for just ï¿¡75 instead of ï¿¡150. The DSi has free internet, DSi WARE (download games to your DSi!). Yes, the GBA slot is missed on the DSi, but as I have a DS lite, GBA SP, GBA and GAMEBOY MICRO, I can play the GBA games on those. I suggest you:<br>  1.) Go to CEX either at your local store on 'www.cex.co.uk' and buy a GAMEBOY MICRO (they are not much!)<br>  2.) Buy the DSi!<br>  If you buy a DS lite, in the long run, it will cost you more than if you buy a DSi, which will be the latest console and will use the latest games and the normal ds games.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. HAPPY GAMING!|`|29wQe2cHaa	I would say that you should get DS lite instead of DSi or normal DS, because the camera is not even that great in the DSi it's 0.3 mega pixels and you can only put in AAC files for music not MP3 and you can't play any gameboy advance games, if you don't believe me check the link below.
