M1ymLE9Paa	I totally agree.  He knew before he got w/Carly that Carly and Sonny share 2 kids together, and that they were married to each other and would always share a bond.  Just b/c he can shut his feelings off for his exe's doesn't mean everyone is that cold-hearted.  I'm not saying Carly hasn't given Jax good reason to feel uncomfortable about her relationship w/Sonny (she did cheat on Jax w/Sonny, afterall).  But I think if he was just more accepting and less antagonistic, Carly would not get herself into some of the crazy situations that have happened.  You'd think he would live and learn.|`|AA12315431	I agree with what you are saying. he needs to realize that Sonny is Michael and Morgan's father, like it or not and Sonny will always be sort of in their lives because of that. I understand his concern about the boys being in danger because of the mob and that he hates that but you know darn well that his long animosity toward Sonny is why he acts the way he does. Jax isn't entirely unselfish. With all of that said, he is going to be even more insecure I bet now because of Carly sleeping with Sonny. I am not sure I could get over that so I sympathize sort of.|`|SqNPj54Kaa	I do too.  It was more upsetting when Kate & Jax hooked up, as that seemed an intentional stab.  So now Jax & Carly are starting over and I hope the writers remember the Jax over the years because that will keep them a very interesting couple.|`|7XM4QJiuaa	I completely agree with you.|`|WjuSuKjoaa	I understand what your saying, but I think that if Carly really wanted to make her marriage work, unless there is a crisis with their SONS, I think she should stay away from Sonny.  Remember, Jax does have a right to worry, Carly did have sex with Sonny in the limo that time...I wouldn't trust her either (at least not yet)|`|CFZ4ISNNaa	I like Jax and Carly too!  But he's so insecure when it comes to Sonny. Its his own fault for taking Sonny's sloppysec...uh for taking Sonny's ex women.  He does need to just man up and stop being jealous over silly stuff.|`|P9k8qHP6aa	I totally agree with you Carly is trying so hard to make their marriage work and Jax cant get over Sonny by now he should realize that Sonny will always be in the picture even if Carly is over him.|`|msUIsv8maa	Because of the Children they will always have a certain amount of contact with each other after all sonny will be calling about visits i guess .|`|rFyikmTSaa	I totally agree I love them together but something always seems to get in their way carly is trying hard but all he can ever bring up is sonny this and sonny that|`|NGNeT3rYaa	I love them too but ya know, Jax has a point.Yes she will always care about him, he is the bio-dad of one of her kids but you know so is Alexis and she don't follow him around and ruin all her relationships for him. She can care what happens to him but other than that she needs to be free of him. Pick a man! She wouldn't tolerate Jax running to Brenda's rescue or anyone else's!|`|Y5jv0ybFaa	You can be divorced and  stay out of each others lives. You have someone else chaperone  when he is with the children.

gIjnoEi5aa	From what I understand, Ken Warwick, Idol's executive producer, will allow the judges to bring back about 9-10 of their favorites from the previous 27 semi-finalists, on March 5. Each wild card contestant will perform and then the judges will choose the three best to complete the top 12.

Because you can't stand for anything yourself, you have no character.<br>  <br>  In the context of ethics, it is your personal ethics that develop your character.

The ones they get for Celebrity Apprentice are alright, so-so, but those people don't have to make any BIG changes in their lifestyles, etc.<br>  <br>  On the 1st ALL-Stars (Season 8) - Just getting the former contestants back was a challenge.  Not all, but some of them began asking for more $$$, special treatment, etc.  In the end Jeff and co. just told them, no, sorry - "Look - we're doing this WITH or Without you".  You choose.  99% of them came back!<br>  <br>  So can you imagine what 'the divas' would want to suffer on an Island, even if they could?? - Can you see Oprah or Paris actually 'roughing' it?!

1wNsBNmxaa	Elvis Aaron Presley Died August 16, 1977<br>  <br>  The medical profession has been seriously questioned.

I'm still hunting for mine actually....|`|D4XWrwuaaa	When I saw ghost poopie in your question I thought you were referring to marshmallows.  I have seen people give out little bags of marshmallows here at Halloween that are package in a label that says Ghost Poop on it.  The kids really think it is funny.<br>  <br>  As for your actual question, I haven't experienced it. Although it actually sounds more pleasant than non-ghost poop!|`|mtuZ3i7haa	xD<br>  That just made my day|`|f2MmEMg5aa	Omg i thought i was the only one who looked into that! lol<br>  I know exactly what you mean. When i strain to poop and sometimes even hear a plop!! So thats the really spooky part, because, if it plopped...where does it go from there? Is there a top secret poop chute? Methinks it may be.

I am a big fan of the Coverdale/Hughes team Myself. <br>  <br>  Probably one of My favorite Eras in Music is the late 70's and a lot of the reason why is because of the crumblings of Bands like Deep Purple and Black Sabbath and all the other fantastic Bands that grew out of their breakups like Coverdale's Whitesnake and Blackmore's Rainbow.<br>  <br>  No, Purple Mark III was fantastic, You ever hear the only Mark IV album Come Taste The Band?|`|qx4F2SJmaa	No Geddy Lee of Rush is much better....take off!|`|AA11221133	I doubt you will be the only one but i would imagine you will be in the minority, For me the mk2 lineup is the definitive deep purple, but i do like coverdale on stormbringer along with glenn hughes and yeah burn is a catchy album so i can see where you are coming from even if i don't agree with you.

Millions of dollars are going to create more prisons due to overcrowding.  HELLOOOOOO  PEOPLE, prison shouldn't be comfy and cozy.  It is apparent that our punishment system is too lax.<br>  I mean seriously, if the only thing someone has to worry about is having the tax payers pay for the time and effort to go to court just to get a suspended sentence, then what kind of deterrent is that?<br>  I mean if the only thing one has to worry about after going on a killing spree is filling out the proper paperwork to get a free college education in between watching HBO in prison, then what the hell is the deterrent to murder, rape, and other intolerable crimes?  I mean with all of the money the government is handing out right now to people who bought houses out of their price range and beyond their means of paying for, why should we spend money on prisoners to live better?<br>  I can unserstand people didn't make wise choices or something happened and they are having a hard time paying for houses that they live in.  But, someone who made a choice to commit rape or murder shouldn't live a better more comfortable life on our tax money.  <br>  Seriously now people, since the government is already taking our tax money and using for housing, wouldn't you rather see it going to help a family keep their little kids under a roof, instead of for someone who wants to rape those little kids or murder them and their parents?<br>  Well, you did ask what do I think.|`|ib00OjJXaa	i think its horrible<br>  living without him, knowing it'll be a year before i see and talk to him and be with him again<br>  my homie just got out of the hospital a week ago<br>  my baby neice is in the hospital for dehydration.<br>  <br>  im losing it<br>  what else is going wrong for me in 2009?|`|XZecjMyXaa	I think that what I think is nothing to think about because I'm not thinking of exactly what to write.|`|qhU3PDgfaa	i think.. i can be pretty good at..err... making out ;)|`|bKyCEBmlaa	so, i'm here to be loved and judged, anyone for thumbs...?<br>  <br>  as i walk down the path into memory lane<br>  wondering why the people around me are never the same<br>  i turn around and stumble in fear<br>  as something in shadows starts to leer.<br>  the fear and the paralysis starts to show<br>  stopping me from head to toe.<br>  it stops me dead in my tracks.<br>  the monster starts to attack<br>  tearing at me from neck, the fangs show<br>  now my dear my blood flows<br>  my heart is racing then slows in time<br>  she says now i found you, you are mine<br>  cuts her tongue and offers me<br>  her blood dripping i can see<br>  now her tongue i start to bite<br>  her blood i start to swallow<br>  this is the last time i'll see the light<br>  forever now with dark gloomy hollow.|`|4f0c942659d974d7439550ff4cc933daaa	violent and uninhibited sex... thats the way to go...

A lot of people claim you can get addicted off one cigarette, but that's not true. Many people try smoking, but very few actually get addicted. I smoked occasionally for a couple years before I got addicted. I also know people who only smoke socially, usually when they are drinking alcohol. They can go days, weeks even months without a cigarette, but put a drink in their hand and they need to smoke. There's also a difference between the physical addiction to nicotine and the psychological addiction to the act of smoking itself.|`|k9oT7rRFaa	Smoking is no good...it does not matter y u started but if possible dont get addicted to it....life is really beautiful...if u r stressed you can talk with ur frnds and u also have YA....once you get addicted to it....u will just keep finding an excuse to smoke...say like m sad..m stressed....m happy etc....so before cigarettes starts smoking you...stop smoking|`|nooi0ldjaa	different for everyone i guess.<br>  <br>  i smoked with my friend for a whole day, the next day i was wanting one bad. but i wasn't "addicted"<br>  <br>  its different for everyone. may take a day, may take a month. why would you want to become addicted to anything?|`|YJAlNJq1aa	it took me about a month lol when i had my first craving i didn't know why i was in such a bad mood and grinding my teeth

AA11590905	Commitment in a relationship never made sense to me. It still doesn't. Hence I don't understand the whole concept of having a boyfriend and being in a relationship. Why are we dictated by the norms of the society? I'm 18 and I've never been in a relationship not that I'm ashamed of it. I really don't want to be in it.<br>  <br>  Besides, why should a piece of paper dictate my course of life? Marriage, especially arranged marriages don't make sense to me. But I live in India, a place where every second marriage is arranged. And they work for most of the times. That's surprising,isn't it?<br>  <br>  I don't get the logic behind commitment either. Hence relationships like having best friends or boyfriends/girlfriends does not make sense to me.|`|0l7pyBSTaa	to me i think marriage is just a piece of paper that changes your last name and makes it so when you get a divorce, the other person gets half of your stuff...and thats about it...vows mean nothing anymore to most people, their just words coming out of your mouth, most of them are broken in the first few years anyways...and if you decide not to stay with that person, a divorce will cost you a ton of money...i have been with my 1st love for 7 years now, we have 4 kids together, and things are wonderful, no were not married, honestly i don't think we ever will be, and it doesn't matter to us, we love each other, and that's what matters the most...sometimes i think when people do get married, they automatically get the idea that the person they are with belongs to them, and i wouldn't want that feeling, i am with him because i want to be, not because a piece of paper says i have to be... so i totally agree with you 100%...|`|AA11656797	I don't want kids and I don't want marriage.|`|iIU7PQHjaa	i am married...the point of it is to be joined together with your spouse "til death do you part"|`|KsVW0paHaa	I don't think I will ever get married lol I hate being clingy|`|qH7IA1Staa	i get what ur saying. When u fall in love whats the point of getting married? if u love each other and trust each other then whats the point? Well i think its cuz two things. <br>  1) u get joined bank accounts and the same last names.<br>  2) when u have kids u will want to tell pll ur married and not have ur kids ask y u guys aren't married like every one else and why u have kids and r not married....ect.<br>  i think some things r easier when ur married plus it's harder for anyone to get out of a relationship when there married so it finalizes things. oh and also for religious purpose's i suppose.|`|8j70Neqeaa	living with mf gf for 15 years, why get married, every one ends up in divorce any way.this way no messy split.|`|9LLDkYPeaa	Marriage would just make your kids legitimate. And maybe change the last name , but thats upto you. Girls like weddings more than marriages. As for me, I guess I'm not the "steady" kind as of now, and am still undecided about marriage...only because my parents believe in the institution so yeah respecting their opinion and all...But yes, I would think before tying the knot since its a legal commitment and divorce can be messy!|`|S1A20Oouaa	I've been married almost 28 years.  I love being married.  My husband is my best friend.  We have two kids, 13 and 16.  I met my husband in high school.  We dated 7 years before we got married.  It's great knowing I have someone here for me no matter what.  It gives you a great sense of security knowing we vowed to be together no matter what.  We have been through some really hard times and really good times.  We made it through together.  When one of us is down the other brings you up.  It's almost like we are one person.  I hope you find that someday.  Good Luck!|`|FhKfyxWlaa	When you fall in love, you just might change your mind.|`|i171LlfTaa	I agree.

Oh and I always think something is wrong with me even if the doctor says there isn't I believe he missed something lol. <br>  <br>  I have a virgo sun and mars.|`|bKpTiFuraa	Yes, I worry all the time, about everything. And when I look back on past times when I've worried and it turned out there was nothing to worry about and I decide not to worry now, I worry that BECAUSE I'm not worrying, something bad will happen as opposed to when I worried and it never did.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, with certain things.<br>  <br>  Yes, I do like things in order.<br>  <br>  I don't get hyponchria.|`|R1Fc344laa	i'm a virgo sun/gemini moon/ and scorpio rising<br>  <br>  i only worry when i think i'm gonna get in trouble.<br>  <br>  yeah i'm a hardcore perfectionist unfortuanetely i'm mostly just hard on myself<br>  <br>  and no. i dont over exxaggerate about anything.especially when i'm sick. i immediately know too, and if it's bad i dont cry or overreact. i state facts to the doctor calmly even when i'm in pain. <br>  <br>  but ive had some big health problems so maybe you guys have never had surgeries or been admitted into the hospital before so that coulsd be where the fear stems from liek you dont know what to expect whereas i already know. <br>  <br>  another trait i heard virgos have is that virgos are snobby especially to people they consider "trashy" or ilke a "low life" <br>  i know a lot of virgos like that!|`|DEi5wYkJaa	Hey!<br>  <br>  I'm virgo sun mecury and mars...yes I do worry. But I'm not sure about the perfectionism...of course I like my environment nice and tidy, who doesnt, but it doesnt mean I keep it that way. My room is always an utter mess (to my shame lol) and I hate housework.. I like things in order coz they look tidy, but im not ocd or anything!<br>  <br>  So yeh, tbh I think this whole perfectionist thing is a bit too general, maybe we should be called hard workers and very efficient, instead of critical and ocd lol... I don't think Virgos are given enough credit for what they are like..people seem to pick up on one small bad part we have and forget the other good stuff..anywayy..this is jst my opinion!|`|Mg4cxVy0aa	I'm a Virgo and I like things in order and I am a perfectionist in a lot of ways....not so much the hypochondria. I find it so interesting how same signs can relate.|`|738e2bd340747ab38ce7182b67f01999aa	I worry all the time about my grades, my weight, what other people are thinking. I worry about everything really. <br>  A perfectionist? In some cases, yes, I would consider myself a perfectionist. I get upset at myself when I score lower than "A" or a "B" on a test! I know, it is weird haha.<br>  I like to keep things in order since it helps me keep a routine and keep things familiar. However, I still do not have the neatest room in the world.<br>  I do not get hypchondria though. All in all, I would say Virgos get a bad rap since people think we cannot mellow out or relax. It sucks, but we have a good side as well (we are sweet, intelligent, helpful, etc).
uQUqZ7k5aa	i would never take mine into the bath... unless it was aquaman and i would never read aquaman.|`|Q8yTJWTXaa	i dont know about comic books but i like to read books in the tub|`|AA11656797	5.

Now, what is strange would be that whenever you want to read a comic and you can't do it unless you are in the bathtub.|`|7dedb1d505bc774b219a42c84ed2ca4caa	Absolutely not strange at all<br>  <br>  People read all sort of magazine and books, whats the difference with comic books?|`|IO5wDOnxaa	i think a 5 be cause it depends on what kind and what type of person for example smart of dumb cool or nerdy hot or not you know|`|vN6J6nELaa	6|`|yGm29f3Eaa	are we talking weird tentacle porn comic or like Batman?<br>  <br>  Batman I give 6<br>  <br>  Tentacle porn - 1|`|e458b49846d0cdbd9493a27ec2896b94aa	not strange - 0 <br>  do what you want in yur own tub|`|BCIfeHAqaa	I don't know anyone who does it..but i guess it's just a way to relax?|`|AA10711985	I read in the bathtub.

People read in the bathtub all the time.. comics are just another form of reading material. And have a lot more action than the sappy romance novels people consider "normal bathtime reading material" :-/ lol<br>  <br>   I'll say it's a 1 on the strange scale. BTW.. nerds are hot. lol|`|U5CLIhYgaa	Why would reading anything in the tub be strange?<br>  <br>  Personally I don't read in the tub anymore, I watch something on my portable, or play PS3.<br>  <br>  However I only soak in a tub maybe once a month when my muscles hurt.|`|AA12227599	Who gives a crap what they think.

qswrz268aa	It's not entirely my favorite Hayden symphony... It is rather humorous in some spots the first time through... <br>  <br>  I much prefer his 49th symphony, 96th symphony, and his 80th symphony. I hardly know that many symphonies by Hayden though... Maybe about 10 of them, and of course there are over a hundred of them... I doubt I'll ever know them all :]|`|CrAwmz65aa	My assignment for Music of the Classical Era was to compare three compositons in the same form, one by Haydn, one by Beethoven, and one by Mozart.

My life is hard enough as it is without have ridiculous fears of this nature. People fear germs waaaaaaaaaaay to much.<br>  Now, if I saw them put their hands down inside their pants and scratch, then immediately touch some food then I would; not throw my food away but I would ask for my money back and make a formal complaint.<br>  Did you let management know of your dissatisfaction?

I went to a 4 star hotel once and the ice cream you could tell, had melted and been refrozen cause it had those little hard bits of ice in, which is a food poisoning risk, and this was at a 4* hotel! I have worked in the catering industry and the ppl there rlly dont give a crap about the ppl they serve too, and on Gordon Ramseys Tv show, he goes to all these posh restaurants (where u hope u would be safe from this kind of thing) and he often finds food that is about 4 days old being served and re cooked and stuff.....so rlly, I dont trust anywhere.<br>  <br>  I once saw a fat fly crawling all over the tuna mayo in these open baguettes at a sandwich bar and i told the girl behind the counter, she said something like "all our food is clean" and I said something like "ppl could get very sick and I have seen it with my own eyes" and she had to throw them away in front of me, yeah some ppl would call that being a busy body but im happy knowing i stopped 3 or 4 ppl getting seriously ill.

I did though and found it hard going but stopped watching about half an hour before the end when they started brutally attacking and torturing the young journalist.

ABybHyU7aa	They get old quickly.  You get all excited about turning 21, and then not long after that, it loses it's thrill.

ADBMrG87aa	The writers want to mislead us into thinking that the serial killer is Todd but longtime fans know better.  I think Todd went looking for his daughter to let her know that Cole is in a bad state of being.  I was checking out the gloved hands and it looked sorta feminine but the pants and shoes threw me off.  We know its not Lola since she's at the school dance so who could it be...maybe Tea or Talia or is it Miles Lawrence?<br>  <br>  (\__/)<br>  (='.'=)<br>  (")-(")<br>  Sweetie|`|WjuSuKjoaa	No, I don't think it is Todd.  He and Blair have such a love/hate relationship I don't think he would ever hurt her.  I also don't think that he would let Marty take the blame for killing Wes.|`|7XM4QJiuaa	I don't think he is the killer.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	Todd is just laying low but the killer isn't him.|`|AA12390047	I think they're just setting it up to look like it's Todd.  He's capable of a lot of things and he has motive but I don't think he's the killer. He needs Blair to take care of his kids.

vsy4QMHMaa	If you've got one hand over the other, it stands to reason that the other one is under the first.<br>  <br>  It really depends on what the passage is, which position is more comfortable. I could easily see passing the left over right to strike a high chord (right hand under) as well as a passage where the one hand is playing "up on the keyboard" (toward the fallboard) on mostly black keys while the other hand comes in playing "down on the keyboard" (toward the keyslip) and needing to slide in underneath to play some close harmonies. <br>  <br>  ... I would say 98% of the time the hand with the passage requiring the most dexterity* will take the upper position.|`|0MunIx8raa	Play it however you feel comfortable.  Personally I don't do that..I do cross over top not under.  That just wouldn't be comfortable or easy for me.|`|sJNoTGQVaa	hand under hand would just be a lot more difficult than hand over hand. You would have to move the hand thats not moving upwards more to make more room for the hand going under because that has to reach the keyboard, whereas hand over hand you don't have to even move the hand being crossed over|`|qswrz268aa	It doesn't mater if you cross over or under. But generally, crossing under is much slower... I prefer the hand that has the melody to be crossed over the other hand, but that's just me. So if a piece something with the other hand crossed, that isn't the melody, I prefer it to be under the hand that has the melody. <br>  <br>  But that's just me...<br>  <br>  Good luck! Cheerio!

e458b49846d0cdbd9493a27ec2896b94aa	Yes - popcorn is very important. And I would boycott a bad popcorn theater.  Because when the movie is bad.  At least the popcorn was good.|`|GBSO1Efraa	No, the popcorn is not important because you have more important factors to look at.  Movies now a days goes a lot to buy the pass and for the price you pay to see your movie of choice, I would expect to get what I'd pay for.  For example you go to the movies and who ever is running the projector doesn't run it right.  The sound keep going in and out, the picture is jumping and the screen goes black.  You pay to see the movie with not of that stuff and if its happens, I would want my money back.  I heard some case where the machine broke in the middle of showing and they cinema didn't even refunded the money when by corporate rules, they had too since their equipment failed to work properly and it was your fault.  Once I got my money back because my friend was getting really sick and we had to take him to the hospital and they give us our money back.  You can always buy the popcorn and plus you can bring your own candy by hiding it in your purse or jacket.|`|2BPMRCVMaa	i eat popcorn sometimes but because i go to the cinema 2wice a week it gets expensive so i settle for coke or popcorn bought from supermarket.<br>  <br>  And yes it would stop me from going there. bad popcorn = **** cinema.<br>  Im lucky im up the road from an amazing one, with imax, 3D and normal viewings. Just sayin' :)|`|cH18CCV6aa	nope, i dont normaly have popcorn anyway|`|ezT7xruoaa	1. No. I like candy too. <br>  2.

Its about ￡2.00 cheaper from the mini store|`|RKVbWPTcaa	i bring my own popcorn from home =]|`|LruRPr8Iaa	I would still go to a cinema because i have only bought popcorn once and that was when i went with school so i could throw it at my teacher. If there was bad popcorn then it might put me off a bit, even though i dont buy it, but i would still go, and take my own food. Simple. (:|`|uJrHmAKDaa	no those chocolate coated nuts are much better|`|AA10778911	yeah|`|frwlypDWaa	Great popcorn can make almost any movie seem good.

AA10197672	If hurt badly then yes! Dont expect them to show any emotions...|`|auUeI2Vnaa	Yes they can!|`|AA12215623	They are the most emotionally detached sign I know of next to Capricorn, then Cancer. Though Cancer's are known to be full of love, and kindness that's only if you earn it. All water signs can have this trait, maybe a few earth signs also.|`|AXE1ukupaa	Uh-huh, especially when they're not interested or distracted. But they're still a good sign. <3|`|7NnBhdNEaa	scorpios have serious mood swings|`|awLQeRkMaa	Oh yes.|`|ziPzCuvBaa	Definitely I agree on the fact that if a scorpio is hurt enough times, they can emotionally detach themselves. But of course every scorpio is not the same. Scorpios are tough, yet very sensitive when it comes to the people that they truly care about. Scorpios are after all known to be very loyal and dedicated. I myself got hurt so much that my emotions are on standby and right now am falling in love with a sagittarius but my emotions are still on the side and I somehow have this choice of leaving my emotions there on the side or taking them fully into the relationship.<br>  That's just from my own personal experience, though.|`|3MJzunf4aa	LALA is right! Next to Capricorn, Scorps can be very emotionally detached! Especially, after they have been hurt or they are not sure of someone or a situation. One thing for sure, when they love you they really love you! They will give you the world! They are sooo loyal!!! :-) Well, I am, atleast! :-)|`|G3lkvGfDaa	They are.  My girlfriend is a Scorpio.  I'm not that emotional.  I prefer to use my head than my heart, but it doesn't mean I'm emotionless or heartless.|`|f5d7aa26eb84978ea4149e1eb47fcf6eaa	passive aggressive mostly but sure, anyone can be anything from time to time.sun sign is your ego.

If you never shaved at all, you'll wind up with hair on your legs similar to the dudes in your family.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/oldwives/hairgrow.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.snopes.com/oldwives/hairgrow....</a>|`|d5HprGzIaa	we're all modern apes|`|2NDX7cSsaa	hey, the hair does not grow back thicker and longer. It's just that, before you shave, the ends are streamlined and pointy in shape, making it look light. when you shave, the ends become flat, so when they grow the stubble end is flat too. This gives it the appearance of being longer and thicker, but it isn't really so.|`|xJTMuHFNaa	Hair grows fast and dark right after shaving (fact).

Think about if he's already show how superficial he is now he will continue. You want a guy who likes you not only for your looks ( lets be truthful looks do matter to some degree) but your personality. Any guy willing to kick you out of the car based off your looks is a man who looks at women as an ornament. I sure your a wonderful girl with a good personality, but if you start compromising things like this in the beginning of the relationship bigger compromises will also occur and you will be mad at yourself and your partner. The most important thing to remember its about what you think of yourself (looks) not the guy. If you are not comfortable with your looks it will shine through to the next person. T, think about what you want in a relationship first. this is displayed by  trail and error before you know what guy is right for you. From my observation of this guy he is not!! I won't be a hater though and tell you to be done with him, just have fun with him by enjoying the things you do like about him, but I would not recommend a relationship with this guy.... If all else fails honey have fun! good luck you in your future endeavors........|`|MEN0lnlraa	you represent me????? Wow, you should be insulted he sees you as a toy, be careful.

vsy4QMHMaa	The only real reason I can think of for your horn to sound different is the mouthpiece and/or the reed. Take it to a shop and try out a few other mouthpieces buy a couple of different reeds to try.<br>  <br>  If the instrument functions fine, but you are dissatisfied with the sound (possibly psychological because you know it was somehow damaged and repaired) you could take a loss on it and trade it in for an other instrument. <br>  <br>  ... expect to get anywhere from 25-35% of the value* of the instrument if you do a trade-in for a new horn.|`|ThKkn5fKaa	Yeah.  If everything is functioning properly, and the only issue is the general sound, I too wonder if your mouthpiece or ligature was damaged.  That being said, at least where I live, there is generally a lack of people out there who really understand how to repair saxophones.  Maybe it deserves a 2nd look from a different repair shop?<br>  <br>  For our info, do you know what all had to be fixed after it fell over?  That might help us to determine the issue.

NV9FoM5Jaa	If it is going to happen it is going to happen.<br>  Do you want it to happen? I am guessing not,the very best advice I can give you and the hardest advice for you to follow will be as follows.<br>  Do not under any circumstances keep hounding him about his ex.<br>  Do not repeatedly ask him if he still has feelings for her etc...<br>  You will drive him right into her arms if you do that.<br>  I think she really hurt him(due to the 2 day prolonged silence)<br>  I think at this point he doesn't want anything to do with her,but she does with him.(because she lost her virginity to him etc...)<br>  Doesn't matter,it  doesn't make her more special then you etc......<br>  Take what he says at face value,pretend she is not living down the street and go on about your business.Time will tell,but if you hound him about it.......your time with him will not last long.<br>  It will be hard........but try your best to at least come across like you are not insecure about the situation.<br>  And if all goes according to plan the whole thing will just mystically blow over.......(she will get a boyfriend etc....)<br>  If you do get suspicious and she is coming around,the best thing you can do is befriend her,make her trust you,eventually she will confide in you,and then you will know exactly where she is coming from.<br>  Also,it doesn't matter if your prettier and have a better body......if she is the nicer of the two of you quite honestly she will probably get her way.|`|exc0TyOEaa	He's probably banging her now.|`|toLCaFc9aa	Just keep your eyes really open.|`|AA11656632	Just keep an eye on him for a while|`|in0fQxN1aa	um...if he cheats he isn't good enough.

ahjqc9Ifaa	I haven't known many celebrities, but I know people who work in theatre and/or movies, and they say that there's definitely a "real me" persona some celebrities put on when they're supposed to be being themselves--but it's just another role.<br>  <br>  More often, according to my acquaintances, some celebrities have a deep-seated need for attention and admiration, and their need is the most important in the room. One online friend tells the story of a certain actor (she names him; I won't) who was in wardrobe for a fitting when a woman received a phone call that her mother had died. His reaction was not sympathy but, "You think that's bad? The worst phone call *I* ever got was..." which failed to acknowledge her feelings or her loss.<br>  <br>  What a total d!ck, huh?<br>  <br>  On the other hand, my acquaintances note that people who pursue the craft of acting at a level which makes them celebrities tend to not be "on stage" when being themselves and would prefer to be treated like anybody else. These include Philip Seymour Hoffman, Keanu Reeves, Ethan Hawke, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.|`|QV02KUDRaa	yea I heard reports that Tyra Banks is fake she is only nice when the cameras are rolling|`|wkCsk3t4aa	YES there is such thing.<br>  I remember going on a trip to korea<br>  and well there was this famous korean singing group of girls <br>  i saw them at the mall and everyone was crowding around them and asking for their autographs and stuff and the famous korean group seemed REALLY nice. well later their bodyguards like...<br>  took them all away and later i was about to walk up to them but then later i saw a a small group of teens about 15 yrs old come up to them like... asking them questions. well the famous korean group just pushed them away and told them to get away from them and walked away... i was pretty shocked when i witnessed that o_o|`|1fbac5d623b9757f6a5e6b9d7ba0b5c2aa	omg, every single celebrity besides 10..

Be back to edit with the right answer :]<br>  <br>  Edit #1: Ok, I think I got it, True (With You) by the Wild Colonials. I'm currently tracking down where I can listen to it. Dawson's Creek uses a lot of indie bands, hard to find lyrics :[<br>  Edit #2: Does it start off : Such a sinful story, won't take long to - <br>  <br>  Dawsonscreekcds.com isn't letting me listen to the whole song.<br>  Actually, listen to it yourself : <a href="http://www.dawsonscreekcds.com/servlet/com.mixonic.dawsons.servlet.TrackSearch?QSTR=True&go.x=16&go.y=20" rel="nofollow">http://www.dawsonscreekcds.com/servlet/c...</a><br>  Do you know what episode number it is? It IS Season 6, right?<br>  <br>  Edit #3: I'm pretty sure it's True (With You) by the Wild Colonials. That's the only one that makes sense with the lyrics you have, and matches up with the scene description. You can create your own soundtrack at dawsonscreekcds.com, which is pretty cool. But there's no where else to listen to it or download it :[ Hey but hopefully this is the one you're looking for. I'm pretty sure it is.<br>  <br>  Edit #4: OK, it DEFINETLY is.

You have Iron Man, Thor, The Hulk, Black Widow, the Wasp, much better characters than Superman/Superwoman, Batman or Green Lantern.  The characters from the Ultimate have more depth to them than characters from the Justice League, that is only my opinion though.  Plus, Superman/Batman have been overdone in movies.|`|GQFjK5e3aa	It all depends on who you like better, I am a DC kinda person.  I am pretty sad witht he meta human comunity in marvel ever since the civil war.  I would go for the Justice league.  But thats just me.|`|d7jsyxEpaa	Yeah Marvel characters are more realistic. They have awesome origin stories<br>  But then again DC has more heroes to deal with. So more super heroes = more action. <br>  It just really depends who you grew up with I guess...

I'm still here.<br>  <br>  This is a picture I made on paint<br>  <br>  <a href="http://s539.photobucket.com/albums/ff360/spekledworf/?action=view&current=ins.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://s539.photobucket.com/albums/ff360...</a>|`|1MLIYilNaa	My favorite quote ever is: <br>  "Even if you stop believing in us, we'll never stop believing in you" (Gerard said that)<br>  It just makes me feel really happy, because they believe in me. And of course, I believe in them (:<br>  And I'll never stop believing in them. Ever.<br>  I often turn that quote around, so like, I'm saying it to them.<br>  <br>  And I think the lyrics from Welcome To The Black Parade are pretty inspirational.<br>  This bit especially:<br>  <br>  "Do or die, you'll never make me<br>  Because the world will never take my heart<br>  Go and try, you'll never break me<br>  We want it all, we wanna play this part<br>  I won't explain or say I'm sorry<br>  I'm unashamed, I'm gonna show my scar<br>  Give a cheer for all the broken<br>  Listen here, because it's who we are<br>  I'm just a man, I'm not a hero<br>  Just a boy, who had to sing this song<br>  I'm just a man, I'm not a hero<br>  I don't care!"<br>  <br>  It's a bit long.. but.. it's really good.<br>  To me, he's just saying don't give a shít about what anyone else thinks of you, be yourself, don't regret anything, be proud of who you are, don't change for anybody and just really nice stuff like that. <br>  Then.. the end bit ("I'm just a man, I'm not a hero") is Gerard (or the patient w/e) is saying.... well.. that he's just a man, not a hero. <br>  People expect too much of him, they expect him to be perfect, but he's not. <br>  He's human, he makes mistakes.<br>  And he's just saying that he doesn't care what people think of him anymore, he does everything for himself, not anybody else (not in a selfish way.. but when he was trying to please everybody else, it was making him unhappy)<br>  <br>  lol, that's probably waaaay off track.. but it's what I get from it xp<br>  (It makes sense in my head!)|`|5kxsEuYuaa	"Saints protect her now" from Interlude.<br>  <br>  -I'm in the same boat as you and many, many other people. They saved my life and keep me going. If I was you I would use that quote. I mean, It fits, and it's appropriate and it's not one of the "cliche" MCR quotes.

Any real and true My Chemical Romance fan will know that this was the best and the most original of them.<br>  <br>  I've grown up since I first heard them and although I don't like them anymore, Vampires will never hurt you is amazing.<br>  <br>  "I'll never let them hurt you, I promise," would be ideal, especially regarding your situation. I can relate, Gerard gave me hope when I first heard this song.|`|XDTAkV5Gaa	in my school speech, i used these quotes:<br>  <br>  " i feel like there's so many people at there who have the kids in the palms of their hand listening, but there are so few people saying something."<br>  <br>  "For me (being onstage) is me being everything I always wanted to be.

They were just 'ordinary' people and they made themselves into something extraordinary that millions of people look up to' It makes me think that I can really do anything I want with my life.

toim8ro7aa	Exactly, imo Lost has lost its self. They are jumping around too much for me. When you finally think you have lost figured out, they hit you in the face with another mix, This is still one of the best shows ever but its confusing. I cant wait for it to end so i can say "Finally, I understand!!"|`|b8a3a3de3ff9b2402cfe47da112e1149aa	yeah but thats also what i like about the show. it's not predictable, it really keeps me guessing. i hate when i can guess whats going to happen on shows or when it cliche. but i love lost because i can guess and speculate and sometimes im right, but most of the time im surprised, so its pretty cool. i do have to say, this season has really dissapointed me. this season started off pretty crazy and confusing but i really loved the epiisode "316" and i was like "yes! thats the lost i love!!" and so then i was really excited for the next episode, "the life and death of jeremy bentham" but i was pretty dissapointed. i was also disspapointed with the episode last night. i really hope it gets back to the way it used to be...|`|SOSsN6mpaa	I jumped in during the middle of a season.

e481b39061db47d1765a634589aeffe3aa	In my own little mind. I didnt find it much to be social commentary. More like, Matt & Trey displaying their issues through south park. Case in point. Their views on how Scientology is a goofball religion made by a goofball sci fi writer. And later on, insulting Issac Hayes by making his character Chef a pedophille and having him killed off, only to return again as Darth Pedophille Chef. The fact that that episode was made because of how upset they were with Issac for leaving his role as Chef because of how they insulted his goofball religion on that episode that i already mentioned. You can even tell that they were when they had Kyle mention that "a goofball club has taken him away" (not exactly what he said. but he was referencing Issac's scientologist beliefs through Chefs brainwashing by the adventure club)<br>  <br>  Another issue example is would be of course: Family Guy. They have a huge hatred towards that show. So they expressed it out through a 2 parter episode explaining how they hate it. But at the same time in their usual way. Have it seen in abit of a positive expression as well along with a half assed funny plot like "Manatee Writers".<br>  <br>  But if its the deep down issues that would be considered social commentary like for instance the references relating to Terry Schiavo, Hurricane Katrina, Or 9/11 (and its conspiracy). It's just Matt & Trey's little ways of expressing how annoying these issues were and expressed them out through South Park. I mean, if i had that kind of power to make a cartoon. I would probally do the same thing. Cause i am easily annoyed by these issues as they are.<br>  <br>  So to put it bluntly. Its not much about social commentary to me and it still it pretty damn funny enough for me to continue watching. I mean, they had to stop killing Kenny every episode at one point.|`|2d3cd2ef5e604d7264bd218d2009bf60aa	Becoming?   The last season and a half have been pretty much that...and form what I can see it is only getting worse...too bad too becasue I used to like the show...still do sort of...just wish Matt and Trey would get back to good clean DIRTY comedy and forget the political stuff...we got Bill Mahr and Letterman for political commmentary we don't need South Park doing it.<br>  <br>  As to the Simpsons...the same applies although not so much as with South Park...at least the Simpsons still can do pure humor without being overtly political once in a while...|`|765aee307dea23245e63ace6327c09c6aa	I always thought that was the point of both shows, to get people thinking about how stupid society can be.  I think it's supposed to be ironic or at least satiric.|`|AA11161407	You think that the first couple of seasons of South Park were *not* about social commentary?  I imagine they've always had that bend.|`|da164df447b5c3da99e38dceb5c942d3aa	South Park is its' own genre of comedy. It makes fun of everyone and everything. Every religion has been made fun of and a lot of countries (especially Canada) have gotten a beat down too. You've just got to accept it for what it is... FUNNY.... mindless, and stupid, but freakin hilarious all the same. It's always done what it is doing now, but Kenny isn't dieing. Same old stuff never ends.|`|f6cadfa2dbdd304573419b8517b89b9faa	The show has always been that way.  They have always addressed "current issues" with their satire.|`|AA11491405	It is now just offensive instead of edgy and insightful|`|AA11193649	The series originally started as a purely raunchy comedy with small doses of social commentary, and has been playing with the recipe ever since. and often Matt and Trey will fall back to raunch when they themselves see it getting to 'social'.  It may have shifted too much for some people, but on the whole it is still more Comedy than Commentator. <br>  <br>  You have to remember, it started with a short almost 10 years ago with a fight between Jesus and Santa over who Christmas belonged too, now if that wasn't social commentary I don't know what is. So the Commentary has always been there, its just ebbed and flowed within each episode, and season to meet the needs of the times. <br>  <br>  Most 'Social Comment' episodes are made within weeks of the events that inspire them, where as the general comedy can be made and shelved until needed. Look at the "Ike & his teacher" episode, yes it was commenting on the occurance of those incidents, but its been months since one of them was in the news, and the episode would have been just as funny if Mary Kay Latournoux(sp) were the only person who ever did that.|`|414d1fe066dfeaf1dca41b67b46b50f9aa	I don't know....  It can be a little too over the top with the social commentary and lacking in focus on comedy....  but it could swing the wrong way too....  that is what I think happened to Family Guy... Family Guy has gone the other way, trying too hard for the cheap laugh and losing the social commentary (which they had early on)....<br>  <br>  Anyway that is my opinion.|`|55833baa318dbad677efdb3bbd677ccfaa	The Simpsons have numerous writers and has REALLY suffered. South Park is still funny and socially relevant.|`|834e49d3bae86765bd01b3e28aa519dbaa	i think it also has to do with the fact that south park has pushed the boundaries so far, that they have almost run out of things to shock you with...  so they pick up on every little thing they can, and current events (especially controversial ones) are a good mining source|`|f47f3836c054a899250388624b801598aa	The social commentary is what makes it funny for me.

10mOHSZTaa	A few months ago, I was "conducting" a Sibelius symphony and walked straight in to a pole. Really loud volume, no attention paid to where I was walking, et cetera. I wish I was making that up...because it hurt. :(<br>  <br>  Today I just got weird looks from people around Chinatown while I was counting time for a Beethoven string quartet on the train.<br>  <br>  And then a few minutes ago I almost fell flat on my face when I tripped on some dude who I didn't notice because of the Bach fugue I was blasting at dangerous levels. (EDIT: I ran the risk of stumbling right on to some subway tracks.)<br>  <br>  Some day, my passion is going to get me hit by a car.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Sometimes I get really, really confused when outside noise combines with my music. I've shared a room my whole life (unfortunately) so I'm pretty used to ambient noise, but sometimes it just gets weird. Within Temptation mixed with "And The Glory Of The Lord" from Messiah. My dad telling me to go load the dishwasher blending perfectly with Bach's "Jesu, Meine Freude" on organ. It's really weird.<br>  <br>  The moral of the story, kids? Don't play your music so loud you can't hear the rest of the world. Dying isn't fun.|`|g2GogSALaa	HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAH.<br>  <br>  No, I've never actually done that, but that sounds pretty epic:)<br>  <br>  Mahler's symphonies would be really fun to blast.<br>  <br>  Or pretty much anything Berlioz:)|`|ThKkn5fKaa	When I was in college, that was my first time ever sharing a room with anybody.  Thank goodness he was a close friend of mine who also enjoyed classical music, otherwise I would have driven him nuts.  I would never blast the classical music on my computer, mainly because I prefer headphones anyway.  But apparently, I sing along with the music and don't realize it?  Nobody ever told me this!  He would be trying to study and have to yell at me to stop singing.  And then, less than a minute later, I'd be doing it again!  I never even realized I was doing it!<br>  <br>  EDIT: Schumiszt- Although I admire your persistence you had to have known that there was no chance for your car play louder than theirs.  Isn't that what people who listen to rap do?  Spend all of their money on speakers for their car?|`|b6cd9d6fe5a0ec1d495444c45c2b75f2aa	Since I don't drive (yet! Still reading that handbook!) I'm not in charge of the music playing in the car. But at school I get teased for conducting or even singing along with an opera aria if I know the libretto well enough. Most people don't let me play my music loud, as they know it is classical and they really don't want to listen to it. Shame, they don't know what they're missing. <br>  <br>  So I haven't gotten any weird looks from strangers, just my friends. Like just today they were teasing me because I was upset that they are doing away with the Music History course and replacing it with a course on Broadway. I hadn't yet taken the course due to scheduling conflicts, and now I can't. My friends always make comments about me listening to "some old dead guys". Maybe one day I'll convert them...maybe.|`|8nsAUwl7aa	It's funny to me when I walk into my appartment and find my roommate (brother) conducting to one of his favorite pieces. I can stand there for about 3-4 minutes before he even notices I am there! Then I usually scare the living daylights outa him :o) It does not bother me at all being that I am a lover of "pop" music. He has put up with my music my entire life so I never have problems with his music. <br>  <br>  When we were younger, I would be jamming out in my room singing loudly to Mariah Carey and he would barge in and start howling! Meeeny!<br>  <br>  Love you brother dearest!<br>  <br>  ~BW's sister<br>  <br>  (keep up the good work)|`|C4OIwfS3aa	I love classical music and I often listen to it in the car but never at such high volume that other motorists or passers by can hear it.  For one thing, not everyone likes classical music and why should they be blasted by it just because we like it?  I hate modern pop music and get very irritated when I hear it blasted out from passing cars or from speakers in shops.  There seems to be a general presumption that everyone loves the latest pop hits.  Grrrr!<br>  <br>  But there is another, even more important, point here.  What about road safety.  You need to have all your senses working at peak performance when driving.  Loud music dangerously inhibits your sense of hearing.  Yes, I know profoundly deaf people can drive very safely.  But their other senses are far sharper than those who can hear and this means that they can drive safely without sound while those of us who have hearing definitely can not.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry my 'story' is not funny but my message is, I believe, very important.|`|OPrvUEDYaa	I love classical music but I nearly always use headphones and I never blast it. My only real gripe with modern society is noise and I don't want to add to it.<br>  <br>  Noise pollution is a real health problem and the studies on the long-term effects of constant exposure to noise are quite surprising.<br>  <br>  I just want to encourage you to continue with your love of the classics. You may be in the minority but... so what?<br>  <br>  Try to treat others well and respect their rights to privacy and quiet.<br>  <br>  Treat others well. That's all that really matters.<br>  <br>  Best wishes, BW.|`|qswrz268aa	That's awesome... And terrible... I bet if it wasn't classical, she wouldn't have even been pulled over. <br>  <br>  Okay, I have a rather embarrassing story... I was in the car listening to some Schubert lieder, and I just had to sing along! It was, Rückblick If I remember correctly... <br>  <br>  So it was a hot summer day and I had the window open... And I got a little to carried away... Stopped at a red light, I drove by a convertible with two black "gangsta's" who were listening to rap, and rapping along. Rap is the most DETESTABLE sound on the planet, in my opinion, so I turned it up and sang as loud as I could to show them the beauty of Schubert... They did the same while giving me a rather offensive hand movement (use your imagination)... And unfortunately, their car was louder than mine...<br>  <br>  Oh well... Some people are real friendly these days...<br>  <br>  Cheerio!|`|f8580fb10a70074a6148e666b97f9cdaaa	I'd like to tell you that every day I used to listening to classical music when driving, I turn it on with a loud volume, closing all car windows to avoid the outside noise, which causes a great disturbance.<br>  So may be the funny stories that I was told by several people who were coincidentally driving beside me, and hardly trying to show me themselves by getting closer and making continuous warning klaxons, and also shouting to me loudly, however I was totally separated than outside, not getting any calling try, being fully affected by the played music inside.|`|qWNdhGVXaa	I get weird looks all the time, I don't know why so many people dislike classical music nowadays.  I don't have any really funny stories, but once on the way to state youth orchestra, I was actually practicing the Tchaikovsky violin concerto in the backseat.  I think the people in other vehicles were kind of surprised, how often do you pass someone actually practicing in the car, lol

And look for how many *stars* it got . well toodles man|`|88121f18eb8124b298d050e15f43bac4aa	the first one sucked real bad...i bet 2 is even dumber|`|AA11450187	I thought it was pretty creapy.

It was very repetitive, and I would not waste my time or money seeing the second one.|`|d9c9e33c0db0b545caaee56ec7487c78aa	I hated the first grudge but the second one seems more intresting. I personally probably won't go see it, but idk.|`|f3a994861e8dff04d3b0e6074d38d08caa	I actually unjoyed The Grudge a bit more than it's Japaneese verson Jun-On. I'm looking forward to the sequel.
f639092fc925bbd55e7b6272eeb17334aa	No<br>  <br>  The book is better.<br>  <br>  I would make you watch every movie.<br>  <br>  The best is 1944 with Orson Welles but if you watch them all you will learn how directors change the story slightly to appeal to new viewers. <br>  <br>  But definitely read the book first.|`|Isxq5DhOaa	there are quite a few Jane Eyre movies really but if I may recommend one I would almost absolutely say the one with ruth Wilson...<br>  <br>  it is so good!!!<br>  please check it out!! ^_^<br>  <br>  edit: i dont think it would matter if you read the book first or not (:<br>  <br>  the 2006 one...it should show say in the link (:<br>  <br>  its very good but about 4 hours long although very very worth it ^^

Whether John is the shortest boy depends on whether you know the Peter, Mike and John ARE in fact all boys (they could be men or animals etc.)  "John is the shortest boy" makes it sound like he is the shortest boy out of ALL boys (i.e. shortest boy in the world), not just the out of 3 in the question - which would in general be false.  The question lacks the specificity needed to be determined either true or false in general, for all cases.|`|NfhsXAOeaa	If you think about it, It's True and False.

414d1fe066dfeaf1dca41b67b46b50f9aa	Rob Zombie seems a bit too obvious... but a good one.....<br>  <br>  I suggest Mickey Rourke however.

Tu3VrkVkaa	No, I used to think that it was murder, then remembered and put together everything else:<br>  He'd tried it once before.<br>  He was pretty much always on drugs.<br>  <br>  It could have even been a complete accident, and he just happened to be high while in a room with a loaded shotgun.|`|PwHQSAxvaa	I find it "obsurd" that people cannot spell "absurd". Kurt Cobain was hospitalised a number of times just before his death, including a heroin overdose in the same week. He was found with a gunshot wound consistant with self-infliction, and no evidence of any other person being involved. It was also known his overdoses were all deliberate.|`|zu0W6hCTaa	pple on drugs can do surprising things, killing themselves is one.|`|28d1daabadd63d26e86fd71474b9230daa	Okay, first of all, how do you NOT know who Kurt Cobain is??? He is one of most famous rock musicians of all time, he singlehandedly started the grunge rock trend, and Nirvana is regularly featured on Greatest Band countdowns and such....wow, you must live under a rock...or be 13.<br>  <br>  Now to the question. The whole thing is a bit of a mystery to me. They thing is, Kurt regularly took drugs like that, and so, he was able to function more than your average person on that many drugs. BUT, the whole fact that he used a shotgun, and the angle is what gets me. The Courtney Love theory is a pretty good one though, since his death gave her such a big career boost. I'm not sure what exactly happend, but I wouldn't put it past her crazy crazy *** to do it. Ultimately though, he DID have emotional problems, and he had been hospitalized before, so you never know.<br>  <br>  Nonetheless, it was a huge loss to music when he died :(|`|1JLEySEHaa	Well he did write a suicide note,<br>  & it was in his hand writing,who knows he probley<br>  planned it,got the gun in a place he can reach and<br>  took a load of drugs and got the gun and killed himself.<br>  <br>  Courtney Love could've murdered him but Im not that<br>  big of a Nirvania fan to know if they had relationship problems<br>  and blah,blah,blah. If Courtney did kill him I find it impossible<br>  how he actually wrote that he was going to kill himself.<br>  <br>  but who knows..<br>  <br>  EDIT: My sister says that she thinks that Courtney Love<br>  hired someone to kill him because she was angry because<br>  of their divorce.And mabey someone made him write<br>  the letter??<br>  <br>  R.I.P Kurt.|`|OPhcD52Daa	i never thought he killed himself.  my sister is a huge fan of him , so we watched all the news after he died and don't believe it was suicide.<br>  if you just look at one thing : there were no legible fingerprints on the shotgun !!! well there is 2 option for that<br>  1 .somebody killed him<br>  2.he didn't die right away, and cleaned the gun|`|a6j0cwgqaa	What I find totally obsurd is I don't even know who the heck Kurt Cobain is!

In the early years, many were tinted frame-by-frame by hand---later, whole sequences were tinted for mood or time of day; by the mid-1920's some films or sequences in films were shown in a two-strip Technicolor process, that reproduced a partial palette of colours- -finally, in or around 1932, true Technicolor was achieved, that could reproduce the full spectrum of colours.|`|AA10478730	"WIZARD OF OZ " may have been the first .|`|71f9e3541936d53052a4d1ff2d316710aa	1968|`|834e49d3bae86765bd01b3e28aa519dbaa	not that this helps, but i saw a documentary once on color movies, and the first was a silent bible movie (no clue on the name or year), where they had actually hand colored every frame... was interesting...|`|AA11056696	Color movies got off the drawing board and began inception in 1938 with several films to be released in the great release year of 1939 with such classics as Gone with The Wind, The Adventures of Robin Hood with Errol Flynn. The form was known as Technicolor.

But my school's dances (for grades 6 through 8) aren't the type where boys and girls slow dance and stuff. Everyone mingles and there is a DJ and we just have a great time dancing. It's not really formal.<br>  <br>  You should go to yours :) It is a great social time to be with friends an meet new people. But is yours like the boy-girl dress up type? That just might not be your thing. If mine were like that, I probably still would go anyway though.|`|it5cjyOraa	i dont. i find them pretty boring. but it depends on what your into, some people think their fun. if you wanna go and think it will be fun, go for it! if not, dont worry your not missing anything :)|`|F0sr7Tpcaa	yes they can be fun<br>  once at my middle school ( idk how i still remember this) but anyways..)<br>  one of my crazy teachers started doing the maccarana *sp? i think he was a little high|`|3BnF5juxaa	i went to mine you should go even if you don't know how to dance. just strat moving with the flow|`|YKSF6aoraa	i went to a couple.

I didn't really dance all that much I just went to talk to my gal pals...you should go to the dance, if it sucks you can always leave early|`|c9b6778bcf8abb59cfb68e059b6f01c9aa	Yes...everyone wears a costume.<br>  I say costume because no one will dress to a dance the way they dress everyday.  That alone makes it an interesting night.|`|YWQdsoOMaa	Go socialize and have a blast.<br>  You only live once, might as well make it fun.|`|zvAfMgf3aa	yea, I do that all the time, you should go too, or you will miss alot of FUN FUN & FUN|`|Igyp0mB1aa	No, they suck.|`|cGwa5XHSaa	Nope i liked the first one after that they got reallly boring|`|3OBJlaTJaa	yea they r kinda fun!!!|`|8Y9timR4aa	no <br>  sure

rZQYCpabaa	I saw this a while ago and hated it b/c it's completely misleading.  I am not saying that fast food is healthy.. it's not clearly and eating a lot of it does not a skinny person make BUT.. WHY DID THIS FILM HAVE TO TAKE SOMEONE WHO IS VEGAN AND WHO EATS USUALLY WAY MORE VEGETABLES THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON AND BASICALLY ATE AT AN EXTREME HEALTHY END OF THE SPECTRUM TO THEN GO TO THE OTHER END AND EAT FAST FOOD?  Of course he was going to gain a ton of weight.  He probably would have gained weight had he eaten a normal diet too.<br>  <br>  It was SO stupid.  Take an average person who eats a healthy balance of snack (fatty ones), fruits, veggies, meat, etc.. and then have them go on an all fast food diet.  The results would NOT have been as alarming.|`|6t76bgS3aa	propaganda ... there's already all kinds of rules and taxes on smoking, so fast food is next on the agenda|`|ee74f3aa67efefa8e49e21be6f4ec61faa	First of all, I don't want the government looking out for my health.  We have way too much government in our everyday lives already.  I can look out for my own health thank you very much! <br>  <br>  Now, that being said, yes I have watched the Super Size Me movie and it was a real eye opener.  It shows that your diet does directly affect your health.  But then again, too much of anything is not good for you.|`|8vfCRg7Caa	the ultimate responsibility for your health is you. Too many fat people need to quit watching the biggest loser and start going to the gym. its alright if some how a gene? got passed down and now you inherited your size from your parents. its not alright just to sit on the couch and do nothing about it. a lot of friends are fat because they dont do any exercise when they get older.and that movie has no being on me going to mcdonalds.|`|MlCWsBcwaa	The last answer is right about this being towards the extreme end of a bad diet.  Even at McDonalds in our state, we can get reasonably healthy food options, so you could eat there most of the time and be okay I would say.  It is good for people to see just what food can do to your body, but a lot of people would soon forget.  It is false economy not to spend more on getting people fit and healthy (will save on health care costs later on).  Also, we are to automated and lazy these days.  Still, it is a matter of personal choice and some people choose to super size.  That is my opinion anyway.  Good luck.|`|y9Hkvn2Waa	I adore that movie...really eye opening. The gov should be taking more responsibility..........they have all these facts about how eating fast & junk food makes us REALLY unhealthy, yet they don't do much about it. Instead, they promote it!!! <br>  After watching that movie I decided to be vegan & stop eating fast/junk food. And I'm feeling 1000 times better...|`|LWvh2g2maa	The government shouldn't be looking out for your health, you should be.|`|DHR04WTHaa	It should'a shocked me but i hav to admit, i was kinda expectin it- after all, it IS McDs.<br>  I don't know about the American Government cos i live in England but the government here is definitely trying to make the younger generation healthier.|`|9v4OInllaa	With Obama around our health seems to be watched!

I wouldn't trust the media response on this one - they've been out to make him look bad since he had the audacity to release a Catholic movie (imagine!) Anything he said that was anti-semitic was wrong and grossly inappropriate and completely inconsistent with Catholicism. BUT just because he has problems doesn't mean you throw the baby out with the bathwater - it doesn't mean Catholicism is hypocritical. It just means, like Catholicism teaches, that we all make (big!) mistakes and we need to ask forgiveness and try better next time. <br>  <br>  I hope all Jewish people understand that Catholicism teaches respect for Jewish people, not hate.

These leaves look the most like tobacco leaves in real life, but some assert that they are fig leaves, which traditionally cover the same area of the body as Fruit of the Loom products do.

A more adult-oriented show that is REALLY FUNNY is Excel Saga. You can find plenty of episodes of Excel Saga on MySpace Videos... but there are only 26 episodes of Excel Saga. Another good show that used to come on the IFC channel is Samurai 7. Samurai 7 is probably the best anime I've ever seen, but I haven't seen it on TV anymore. You might want to look for DVDs of it, if they have any.|`|6fa96f43ce8131efe0692d185a843304aa	well you can watch Mar on jetstream and the Desendents of Darkness or patlabor on some asian channal|`|8b8fa478032f1f753b54306c596cd0ddaa	hey there are alota of good animes out there online as well. <br>  id like to say fushigi yuugi, bleach, or hikaru no go.<br>  oh and about avatar, go to youtube and u can catch up on all the episodes!!|`|AA11372802	Samurai Deeper Kyo, Rurouni Kenshin, Candidate for Goddess, and Reborn.

CVBahMK0aa	sharing printers is like sharing an ice cream cone:  your always getting someone elses crud.  the best thing to do is just turn it on and off so the poor IT guy has to waste his time varying it off and back on.  or better yet, just empty the paper, and say you don't know what the error message is.  another great one is dropping a paper clip in where the print head travels back and forth.  that will send everyone in a tizzy.  disconnect the cable, you know where i'm going with this.|`|8437dcfc5c9fd513d8d7e3e5f74a9ccbaa	Just kick it in its USB port, and then disconnect its LAN connection.<br>  <br>  That'll teach it.

Jessica tells him that he is a dealer Linderman wants her to see. Dl thinks he is a target or worse. As DL leaves the room Jessica stops to load her gun.<br>  <br>  At Suresh's place, Mohinder is telling the now tied up Sylar about the curari. He is saying how Zane's death was in the news the other day. Then he starts torturing Sylar with a tuning fork. Sylar is taunting Suresh by telling him that his father liked him better, just like he like Suresh's sister Shanti better, Sylar tells him that his father didn't want him involved in this.He thought Mohinder was too fragile. Sylar sees himslf as a necessary part of the evolutionary process a parasite. <br>  Mohinder tells him that his father called Sylar Patient Zero and wated to use him as a template to cure the other heroes. He say that it will be easier to do this once he takes a sample of Sylar's spinal fluid . It will hurt quite a bit but that is part of the fun of it.<br>  <br>  In Las Vegas, Hiro takes the elevator to the Curator and tells him he has the latest Mendez painting. He is also there to pick up the bushido katana sword. The curator is suspicios of this. He opens the case to pull out the painting and finds it has been torn and taped together. The curator calls for security. Hiro gets to the computer and looks up the sword code number CRM114 and tells the computer to open that drawer. When the drawer opens Hiro climes a ladder to retreive the sword. As he is coming down security has arrived in the form of Ando in a security outfit. The rest of security is on its way as Ando and Hiro bend time with the sword.<br>  <br>  In a room elsewhere in the building Jessica breaks in on the FBI setting up to tap Nathan's visit. She tells them that is unacceptable and proceeds to kill them all.<br>  <br>  Back with Suresh, he is telling Sylar how there seems to be 4 simple genes involved here. Sylar is telling Mohinder how he is the true victim here. he is just looking for his own salvation. He is just a natural part of the species. Suresh is telling him how it is unforgiveable killing his father. Picking up his gun and pointing it at Sylar he pulls the trigger but Sylar stops the bullet with his mind. He tells Mohinder how he turned off the IV a long time ago and opening his restraints tells him how he has just been playing with him to get to the list.<br>  <br>  In the loft, Isaac is back to painting and his painting is of him with his head chopped open and blood trickling out.<br>  <br>  Bennett has made it back to his hotel room and is telling Sondra that he has to go looking for claire. She will not be safe. The company is looking for her. He is afraid of all these lies. Bennetts's phone rings. It is Thompson saying we have a problem. Sondra turns into Candace. Thompson comes in from the other room with two other company men.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, Hiro and Ando transport to the Devereax terrace sometime in the future after the explosion and Ando is amazed at the damage that has been done to the city.

Her grandmother wants to keep her protected.<br>  <br>  In Vegas, Jessica seems to have found Nathan and tears open his shirt to get to the bug. She tells him to get rid of it. He tells her the FBI are on their way. She tells him they are dead and to do as she says. She says that Linderman will make him an offer and that he should take it, whatever it is. He wonders why she does not kill him. Long story short, Jessica killed the FBI and then Nikki took over to try and teach Jessica a lesson. She wants him to do as she has said and before leaving knock her out with the gun. Jessica has to learn a lesson that she is not in charge. Nathan whacks her one and putting the gun in his pocket proceeds to find Linderman. He expected to meet in Linderman's room but Linderman chooses to meet him in the kitchen where Linderman is chopping some zucchini. Linderman is asking vegetable? Linderman keeps talking about cooking and the pot pie he is making and how he likes to do some things himself. He likes looking for perfection in life. He says most people eat when they are happy and there comes the issue with Nathan. What makes him happy. Is he searching for happiness or meaning in all of this? Life is in the present. Meaning wallows in part of life. In the future. Linderman notices that Nathan has pulled the gun out of his pocket and is now pointing it at Linderman with the gun ******. Linderman says "No pot pie?" Linderman tells Nathan that he has many friends that as a group help one another and they do quite nicely for themselves. If nathan joins the group he will win the election and in a short while he could even win the presidency. The gun starts to come down.<br>  <br>  At Mohinder's place Peter has arrived to ask Mohinder what is up with the search for a cure but he is greeted at the door with a choke hold from Sylar who says that he remembers him. Mohinder is stuck to the ceiling bleeding as Sylar finds a new person to amuse himself with. Sylar starts to cut open Peter's skull with his finger and Peter screams from the pain.<br>  <br>  To Be Continued April 23<br>  <br>  EOE|`|AA12064604	it has not been on in a couple of weeks,the congressman meet linderman,there a shape shifter,the artist kill Peter girl friend|`|bkMIcRSEaa	I've watch till the latest episode when Peter met Sylar at Suresh's apartment.

TfVkvY1caa	I've been clean for 3 years now but I used to do anything I could get my hands on. I think the worst hallucination was when I had been awake for almost a week of some crystal meth and I was sitting on my couch at like 10 p.m. and I was so strung out and I looked outside and there was a cop in my tree and there were storm troopers, you know the ones from star wars, outside hiding behind cars. I thought that the task force was coming for me. Every time I looked away they would get closer so I spent the whole night staring outside at them so they wouldn't come closer. It was really scary, the next day I decided to go to rehab and ended up going within a month.|`|262b14ec96964f5337d35a1076f74f0caa	With LSD, and a bit of Ecstacy, I saw the room full of dancing people come to a halt.<br>  It looked a bit like when you get a scratch on a DVD and it pauses.<br>  It was freaky, but wonderful.|`|Z08JeiQqaa	I had thought that the moon was going to fall down on top of us.

Not necessarily hallucination though. They were watching me and wondering if I could see them.<br>  Mushrooms give a very deep, rich, colourful, earthy, yet spacey trip, in my experience. A great sense of the void, and eternity, esp. if taken at night.  Not, bright and brilliant like LSD did for me.|`|B0srk7Fuaa	man im stoned now, i can see a screen with writing on it,,and it has YAHOO W****RS at the top,,ace weed|`|647497294bd98ac6e0af48f6c811fc44aa	Haven't done mushrooms, but I hav done other stuff.

I think if u don't have enough trust then the relationship won't work. we both are individuals, we like to do what we want when we want.  don't get me wrong we have our arguments but its mostly about money, if i don't control him then he'll buy the world lol we work well together solving our problems. if we do have an argument it never gets in between us, by the end of the day all is settled and we're back to having a loving relationship. i guess  just be opened minded about the relationship, Aquarius men are sensitive even if they don't admit it. if they feel your not faithful or loving then be prepared for confrontation. But like I said if their is no trust or faith in one another then it wont work. hope its works out for you even if your not considering a long term commitment.

4709b71b64f197c865b2389feab6b5b3aa	In my opinion all adaption terrible! The worst is Final Fantasy to movie (it's look like alien series game). It is not the same when we played in the game. No magic, summon, Chocobo, etc. That is Final Fantasy world. Where those characteristic? Latest Final Fantasy Movie: The Advent Children is better, yet still bad enough. Why all adaption terrible? Because it can not gives us the 'great' fell like when we played it. Like different with the game! Steet figther? The main hero is Ryu and Ken, NOT Guile. Ok if Guile become main hero, but the story different! The real story Guile wants to revenge Nash/Charlie death, but not in the movie! Vega/Mr.Bison to skinny! Van Damme's hair, Sonic Boom? The good one is Silent Hill movie, but i don't likes the game, so i can not judge. Is it good adaption or not.... <br>  <br>  The worst (1st rank): Final Fantasy 1st movie (forgot the title)<br>  2nd rank (on the second thougt there is no 2nd rank): street fighter and other movies sucks!|`|3a09c69a12a5dc2ebfea09cf614bb59aaa	fight club- brilliant film but the game was absolutely ******* crap!|`|74633056a7060cd8eb83a9de45c1587caa	if they ever made a film of gta san andreas it would be shite in comparison to the game i would imagine.<br>  seriously, would like to hear if someone has been brave enough to either watch the fifty cent film or play the game|`|e4bbb5f5ae7ad5d67690140dfdb6eb07aa	sonic x mainly because they gave him a 3year olds voice...|`|8a1b6468198eb3bc8926090f71a22b48aa	I'm not really big on games etc, but i'd say pirates of the carribian or Harry Potter.

Rumors has it that there are a million game cartridges in the landfills because it was so bad.

A lot of people start at Varsity on Lendal and work their way down Coney Street taking in Orgasmic, Pitcher and Piano, Ha Ha Bar and finaly Yates's, The Capital, O'Neills or Old Orleans.  If you aren't wearing jeans you could then nip into The Living Room (good cocktail menu) then over the road to The Parish.  Then it's up to Reflex (80's Bar) and maybe into Flares and most people end their night in either BPM or Nexus.  There is also another club called the Gallery which you might enjoy.  This is back up nearer to Yates's.  There is also the Micklegate run starting up at the Punch Bowl and going down the hill til you get to Reflex then onwards. The run is not as good as it used to be.  This is all of course if you like dance music etc and not rock.  If you prefer rock music try Fibbers club night.

2d17d689172b0ec9acbc257caf63febeaa	Hmm.. actually, no. its not wierd for an anime fan to have crushes on cute characters. The thing is, its not normal for someone to be REALLY obsessed.. i mean totally. What you guys are doing is far from being obsessed... in my point of view. In fact, i like reading fanfics and i make some too. I have plenty of crushes on anime characters and my boyfriend doesn't think its weird. i just find them really cute!! :D  <br>  <br>  you just have to know when to draw the line... :D|`|sO2GLB67aa	No. There's nothing wrong with this, it's perfectly normal behavior for an anime fan. All of my friends are anime fans, and i've met alot of fans who aren't my friends who are also this way, both girls and guys. Believe me, it's perfectly normal. (for an anime fan ^^)|`|ac35f09a157429e34ba70bc44b1d3280aa	well teen agers always have a crash on someone easily and it is a quite natural phenomena for teen agers having a LIGHT crash on anime characters for a short period. But you must always tell or remind yourself that that the characters you crash on is not REAL and don put in your heart 100% into it. Ya i think it is all right to watch anime as it is some form of hobby.........

It is ruled by Mercury, and its element is earth, demonstrated through the Virgo's practical stability. Its quality is mutable, which signifies those who are malleable, amendable, or adaptable; the the yearly cycle, it indicates the shift between two seasons. When the Sun is in Virgo, summer becomes fall. As the Sun moves through Virgo, the following energies predominate, affecting the way people relate to one another:<br>  <br>  Notable positive qualities associated with Virgo:<br>  -Precise, analytical<br>  -Gentle, humane, helpful<br>  -Intrinsic understanding of mental, spiritual, and physical health<br>  -Organized, dedicated<br>  -Sympathetic, warm<br>  <br>  Notable not-so-positive qualities associated with Virgo:<br>  -Hypercritical of self and others, judgemental<br>  -Worried, pessimistic<br>  -Untidy<br>  -Hypochondriac<br>  -Dogmatic, didactic, pedantic<br>  <br>  If you are wondering romantically, such as the person you are pursuing is a Virgo, then let me know and I can give you more information on how to win her over.

Fe4DAGjPaa	While your fascination with everything Nathan Coles is completely understandable and even admirable, his middle name should be the least of your concerns.  Nathan Coles has done so many great things for mankind.  It's like he has done everything that could ever be done and is everywhere at once, yet he is still understated, humble, and hidden (an enigma wrapped in a mystery.)  Legend has it that a woman once made eye contact with Nathan Coles and has been stuck in a catatonic state of fantasy about him ever since.  Everyone knows that Nathan Coles has appeared in YM and Seventeen magazines a number of times, but most people do not know that the photo shoots had to be done using a modified pinhole projector because of the dazzling brilliance that naturally surrounds his perfect body.  In 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court barred Nathan Coles from appearing shirtless at the beach, citing the 1919 Court case Schenck v. United States.  The majority opinion of the Court stated that this man's chiseled musculature and playful smile represented a "clear and present danger" to the general population because of women's tendency to stampede as they fight to make their way closer to him to bask in his glory just a little, just for a second, just to see how it feels.  In response to your question, Nathan Coles' middle name is never written because it would cause the reader to go blind.  It is never spoken because it is too beautiful to pronounce.  If you even think of his middle name in your mind you will be driven insane.  I'm sorry to go on and on and not be able to specifically answer your query, but I too am a huge fan of Nathan Coles.  God help you if you suffer the misfortune of coming across his middle name.<br>  <br>  P.S. It's a fact - 95% of women fall asleep at night thinking about Nathan Coles.  The rest lie.<br>  <br>  P.P.S. Nathan Coles' tears cure cancer.  Luckily he cries happy tears all the time because he just feels so fortunate to have been born Nathan Coles.|`|V0LaoP9Maa	Maybe he doesnt have one, some people dont have middle names.

AA10739032	Do you mean "In The Sun" by Michael Stipe (of REM) along with Chris Martin, Justin Timberlake and Will.I.Am?  If you do, then you can find it on iTunes.  It came out last year as a single to raise money for Katrina relief.  It's a remake of an old Joseph Arthur song, but I find no reference that Peter Gabriel ever recorded it.

AA10058555	In about 200 years.  Too many people jumped onto the "Collectibles" bandwagon.  The thing that made collectibles valuable is that few original copies existed in good condition, ie few people collected and saved them properly.  A bunch of people saw this as an investment and bought all the new number 1's, cards, etc.  At this point I could probably wall paper my bathroom with Spiderman #1 (Todd MacFarlane) at little more than the cost for wallpaper, perhaps less.

9C3uBQDFaa	Andrea Chénier di Umberto Giordano<br>  <br>  All'epoca della rivoluzione francese 1789-1794 è la storia d'amore di un poeta, Andrea Chenier, che professa l'amore come purissimo sentimento, con la prima frivola nobildonna Maddalena trasformata dalla rivoluzione in una donna dai sentimenti forti. L'amore è contrastato dal vecchio servo della signora Gerard che è geloso e che nonostante abbia ripensamenti e cerchi di voltare verso il bene alla fine cede alla tentazione di accusare il poeta perseguitato dal governo del "terrore". Maddalena cerca in un disperato tentativo di offrirsi a Gerard per salvare il suo amato, Gerard impietosito cerca di salvare con ogni mezzo il poeta ma non vi riesce. Chenier viene condannato a morte,Maddalena con la complicità di Gerard si sostituisce ad una prigioniera va incontro alla morte col suo amato serenamente, come dimentichi di tutto quanto li circonda, rapiti dal loro sogno d'amore e di martirio. In un angolo del cortile, Gérard piange disperatamente."<br>  <br>  <br>  Ehm il requiem di Mozart non è un'opera (scusate se lo faccio notare).<br>  <br>  Ok l'avete voluto voi. Nominare opere solo per sentito dire è una caratteristica di chi non ama l'opera. 1) L'opera di puccini è la Boheme ma almeno sapete di cosa parla?<br>  2) Lo schiaccianoci di ?ajkovskij non si può definire esattamente un'opera essendo una rappresentazione in balletto e per opera si intende una versione cantata di una storia quindi idem dicasi per tutte quelle opere da voi citate (ma le avete mai viste) che propriamente non son opere.<br>  <br>  Bohème<br>  <br>  <br>  A Parigi nel 1830 Rodolfo (pittore), Schaunard (musicista) e Colline (filosofo) convivono in una soffitta, campando di arte ed espedienti. E' la vigilia di Natale e Rodolfo si attarda a casa da solo, quando alla porta bussa la giovane vicina di casa, Mimì. Scoppia un colpo di fulmine e i due giovani si dichiarano amore reciproco. Gli amici li chiamano per andare a festeggiare al Quartiere Latino, che è un tripudio di colori. Al gruppo si aggrega Musetta, che con un espediente finisce tra le braccia di Marcello, ex amante di cui è ancora innamorata. <br>  E' febbraio e le cose tra Rodolfo e Mimì non funzionano più. In realtà il pittore vuole lasciare la ragazza perché è malata di tisi e lui non ha mezzi per poterla curare. Mimì viene a sapere della sua condizione, ma la risolleva il fatto che Rodolfo la ama ancora. Passano alcuni mesi. Marcello e Rodolfo abitano ancora nella soffitta; trafelata arriva Musetta ad avvisarli che Mimì è in strada morente. Viene fatta sdraiare sul letto, dove si spegne tra le braccia di Rodolfo. <br>  <br>  LA TRAVIATA : <br>  La scena si apre nella casa di Violetta Valéry, famosa donna mondana che festeggia per dimenticare le angosce per il suo grave stato di salute. Durante la festa, il nobile Gastone presenta alla padrona di casa il suo amico Alfredo. <br>  I due si sentono attratti e mentre danzano Alfredo dichiara il suo amore a violetta che gli regala una camelia. La donna finita la festa si accorge di essersi, per la prima volta, sinceramente innamorata.<br>  Violetta e Alfredo vivono felii fuori città, sino a quando l'uomo viene a sapere che Violetta sta vendendo i suoi gioielli perchè priva di denaro. Mentre la donna è sola, riceve la visita del padre del suo amato, Giorgio Germont, che l'accusa di condurre il figlio alla miseria e la invita a lasciarlo, poichè la loro relazione desta grave scandalo, al punto che egli non riesce a far sposare un'altra sua figliola. Violetta decisa a fare il bene del suo Alfredo lo abbandona e riappare ad una festa con il suo vecchio amante Duphol. Alfredo è tra gli invitati, entrambi fingono di non vedersi, ma Duphol, accecato dalla gelosia, vorrebbe sfidare a duello il suo rivale.Violetta lo convince ad allontanarsi dalla festa con la promessa di seguirlo e prima di andarsene dice ad Alfredo di aver promesso a Duphol di non incontrarlo mai più, senza rivelargli dell'incontro con suo padre. La reazione di Alfredo è dura, la tratta da prostituta. Violetta è gravemente malata, ormai è sempre a letto. Una lettera di giorgio Germont allieta il grigiore della sua vita. Finalmente Alfredo ha saputo dal padre del suo incontro con Violetta e del suo sacrificio. La donna spera di restare in vita per rivederlo. Alfredo e il padre giungono al capezzale di Violetta che davanti a loro muore di tisi.<br>  <br>  "Il barbiere di Siviglia"<br>  <br>  Io sono docile,<br>  <br>  son rispettosa, sono obbediente,<br>  <br>  dolce, amorosa,<br>  <br>  mi lascio reggere,<br>  <br>  mi fo guidare.<br>  <br>  Ma se mi toccano<br>  <br>  dov'è il mio debole,<br>  <br>  sarò una vipera, sarò...<br>  <br>  (Rosina, Il barbiere di Siviglia)<br>  <br>  La scena si svolge a Siviglia. Il Conte Almaviva è follemente innamorato di Rosina, la pupilla del Dottor Bartolo; costui conta di sposarla, perciò la tiene segregata. Al termine della serenata che il Conte canta sotto il balcone della sua bella (Ecco ridente in cielo/spunta la bell’aurora) arriva Figaro, barbiere di Bartolo, uomo astuto e gioioso, che canta a squarciagola (Largo al factotum della città).<br>  Almaviva mette al corrente Figaro sulla ragione della sua presenza in quel luogo ed il desiderio di riuscire ad entrare nella casa. Scoperto che il barbiere ha facile accesso alla città, il Conte lo convince ad accettare di aiutarlo dietro il pagamento di una forte somma di denaro (All’idea di quel metallo /portentoso, onnipossente/un vulcano la mia mente/già comincia a diventar, sì). La mente di Figaro è già al lavoro. Fa cantare al Conte un’altra serenata dove costui si fa passare per Lindoro, giovane squattrinato, al fine di evitare un amore “interessato” da parte della giovane. Rosina è al balcone, affascinata dal canto proveniente dal cortile ma, uditi dei passi, è costretta a rientrare in casa. Chiusa in camera ha tra le mani una lettera che vorrebbe far recapitare all’uomo, dalla cui voce melodiosa è rimasta incantata (Una voce poco fa /qui nel cor mi risuonò) …da Figaro, naturalmente. Mentre i due confabulano, arrivano Bartolo e Basilio, professore di canto di Rosina, il quale informa il padrone di casa che il Conte di Almaviva è giunto a Siviglia, e consiglia a Bartolo, che vuole concludere al più presto il contratto di matrimonio, di ricorrere alla calunnia per scoraggiare Lindoro (La calunnia è un venticello).<br>  Figaro, che di nascosto ha udito la conversazione, rivela tutto a Rosina e fa in modo che incontri Lindoro, che s’introduce in casa fingendosi un soldato ubriaco e riesce a scambiare un biglietto con la ragazza.<br>  Successivamente Almaviva riesce a reintrodursi in casa come maestro di Bartolo col pretesto di sostituire Basilio ammalato. Figaro, intanto, arrivato col pretesto di radere Bartolo, riesce a sottrargli le chiavi del balcone dov’è rinchiusa Rosina. Dopo altre peripezie, con uno stratagemma, e con la complicità forzata di Basilio, Figaro riesce a far celebrare il matrimonio tra il Conte d’Almaviva e Rosina (Di sì felice innesto/ serbiam memoria eterna), e quando Bartolo arriva non può fare altro che unirsi al coro di gioia (amor e fede eterna/si vegga in voi regnar) e benedire gli sposi.<br>  Questa è la trama della più popolare delle opere buffe di Rossini, articolata in 34 numeri, definita “il più grande poema musicale comico-satirico-umoristico dell’umanità”che, rappresentata per la prima volta a Roma nel 1816, ottenne un clamoroso fiasco, prontamente riscattato, però, da un incredibile successo già alla seconda rappresentazione.<br>  L’iniziale insuccesso dipese dalle modifiche sostanziali che il musicista apportò al testo originario della commedia francese “Il barbiere di Siviglia” (creazione del sig. Beaumarchais, ribattezzata da Rossini “Almaviva, ossia l’inutile precauzione”), con una nuova versificazione dell’intera opera, con l’aggiunta di nuove situazioni di pezzi musicali e con l’introduzione dei cori, sia perché voluti dal gusto moderno, sia perché indispensabili all’effetto musicale in un teatro di notevole ampiezza come quello di Roma.<br>  L’ottica di questo capolavoro è decisamente di tipo ludico, con la sospensione dell’azione drammatica, con il contrasto continuo dell’azione per lasciare spazio al vitalismo musicale, attraverso arie trascinanti che trasmettono gioia di vivere, in un risultato che non è mai statico ma intriso di scioltezza narrativa e divertimento.<br>  Rossini si differenziò dai modelli musicali settecenteschi anche nell’accentuazione dei caratteri dei personaggi, che rese più umani e più realistici. ad esempio trasformò Figaro, dialettico e calcolatore in Beaumarchais, in un popolano chiacchierone, generoso ed astuto; Rosina diventò una ragazza moderna che sa cosa vuole; Almaviva un giovane intraprendente che non si ferma di fronte agli ostacoli; e di Bartolo e Basilio fece una satira sociale del passato.<br>  Il "Barbiere di Siviglia " è, dunque, una commedia giocosa, una variopinta commedia umana copiosa in musica, ricca di presenza ritmica, e tutta l’opera più che di fascino melodico è carica di spirito e briosità, con arie sgargianti, spiritose, come la cavatina di Figaro (Largo al factotum della città) o la lugubre aria di Basilio (La calunnia è un venticello), o il malizioso duetto tra Figaro e Rosina per la consegna del biglietto a Lindoro, scelte musicali che dimostrano l’intento di Rossini di esaltare non la melodia ma il virtuosismo e la ritmica, caratteristiche ben espresse dai cantanti.<br>  Quest’opera, oltre che al pubblico, piacque a molti nomi illustri, all’antirossiniano Berlioz, a Schumann che rimaneva estasiato ogni volta che la ascoltava, persino all’antitalianista Wagner, ma il giudizio che mi sembra esprimerne al meglio lo spirito e il valore è questo:<br>  …Fedele interprete dell’anima nazionale italiana, esso rimarrà documento imperituro della genialità di nostra gente e continuerà per secoli a deliziare il mondo con la giocondità serena e benefica dei suoi canti, finché gli uomini chiederanno alla musica un sollievo dalle miserie quotidiane.<br>  <br>  "Così fan tutte"<br>  <br>  Le donne son tutte civette, gli uomini son tutti creduloni, almeno gli innamorati. Basta saperlo e regolarsi di conseguenza. A prima lettura la trama è questa, misogina e un po' qualunquista e anche molto tradizionale, con le due coppie di innamorati (Fiordiligi e Gugliemo; Dorabella e Ferrando) che si amano, si indispettiscono e si riconciliano, con la serva intrigante (Despina), pronta a consigliare, tradire e ricomporre, il vecchio un po' philosophe (Don Alfonso) che conduce il gioco e, dopo aver scomposto la trama a suo piacimento, la ricompone nella formazione originaria. Facile l'insegnamento condiviso:?Fortunato l'uom che prende / Ogni cosa pel buon verso, / e tra i casi e le vicende / Da ragion guidar si fa. / Quel che suole altrui far piangere/ fia per lui cagion di riso, / E del mondo in mezzo ai turbini / Bella calma proverà?. <br>  <br>  "Falstaff " G.Verdi liberamente tratto da "Le allegre comari di sir Windsor" di W.Shakespeare<br>  <br>  In Inghilterra regna il primo dei Lancaster, Enrico IV, il quale è salito al trono dopo torbide lotte. Le rivendicazioni sollecitano i tentativi ribelli, di cui si fa portavoce il giovane Enrico Percy, detto Hotspur. Egli giura di vendicarsi, e ucciderebbe volentieri il principe ereditario, se non sapesse che questi è inviso al padre, perché preferisce passare il tempo a gozzovigliare con amici, tra i quali l'inseparabile Falstaff, bivaccando in una malfamata locanda. Ma gli eventi precipitano: Hotspur prende la via della ribellione aperta sobillando la gente del suo popolo, mentre Enrico IV manda a chiamare il figlio, affinché assolva gli obblighi militari che gli competono come principe ereditario. La battaglia, divampa e il giovane principe riesce a vincerla e a uccidere lo stesso Hotspur. Ma Falstaff se ne attribuisce l'onore, lasciando al re la negativa impressione sulle capacità di suo figlio. In seguito quando giunge la notizia che Enrico IV è morto e che suo figlio è salito al trono col nome di Enrico V, Falstaff non sta in sé dalla gioia, sicuro che la sua vita futura non avrà più problemi. Ma Enrico V diventando re, ne ha accettato tutte le responsabilità e non può più ammettere la vicinanza di individui dissoluti. Avvilito Falstaff continua il suo bighellonare con filosofica tracutaggine, fino alla sua morte.<br>  <br>  <br>  Non basta menzionare opere per sentito dire bisogna ascoltarle e come disse uno in un film: "L'opera la senti nel cuore potrai imparare ad apprezzarla ma sarà tua solo quando senti che ti da emozioni dentro" stava guardando la traviata di Verdi.<br>  <br>  Ma volete che citi "I pagliacci di Mascagni""?<br>  Il rigoletto<br>  il trovatore<br>  la cavalleria rusticana<br>  Madame Buitterfly<br>  L'elisir d'amore (molto divertente)?<br>  <br>  a citare il titolo siamo bravi basta averlo sentito ma quanti di voi son davvero stati ad un teatro dell'opera?<br>  <br>  Tamino potevi anche scriverlo in italiano o non sai qual'è l'opra o opera che sia?

In normal tissue, blood flows from the heart through arteries, and then to smaller vessels called capillaries. The surrounding tissue recieves its nourishment from the blood flowing through the capillaries. In AVMs, the capillaries are absent, so that the blood flows directly back to the heart, and the tissue does not receive nourishment. The brain tissue between these vessels is abnormal.

d440ae3e3b490be7fc853eccf4f67bf8aa	Yes, I think it is worth it.  You've got variant covers and limited editions and they are mostly in Near Mint condition as you said.  The desirability of your books will be increased many times over by a professional grader like CGC.  I suppose ONE really good variant cover book from your lot will more than pay for the membership fee at eBay.  However, price on grading already starts at US$10 EACH book so make sure your books are worth at least $10 to break even.<br>  <br>  You'd definitely make a profit out of buying Near Mint copies, having them "slabbed" and selling them via eBay IF the items you will buy are truly collectible.  So choose very wisely on what issues to invest on.  <br>  <br>  HERE'S A TIP: Track down Amazing Spider-Man #298 (Venom's first appearance) before the third movie hits the big screen.  That will definitely double up in value in ungraded condition.<br>  <br>  Good luck on this venture!<br>  <br>  12 Jan 2007; 9:41pm|`|834e49d3bae86765bd01b3e28aa519dbaa	not unless you have some REALLY good stuff...

Spider-man is fighting 3 super villians in the next movie what else do you want?|`|5b95fe2f238f09d23f5898738a58e1b1aa	There are lots of older games with Carnage. Like for the Super Nintendo.<br>  <br>  As for now? Who knows. It might be because he is a little to extreme for the series of Spider-Man movies. I would imagine they would want the current Spider-Man franchise to steer clear of him. The movies are all rated PG-13, right?<br>  <br>  Here is a brief description of Carnage from Wikipedia. Lol. (By the way... Kasady is Carnage.)<br>  <br>  "His past is uncertain and information given by Kasady himself is often contradictory. Kasady claims his mother tried to kill him after she caught him torturing her dog. She was apparently beaten to death by Kasady's father, who received no defence from his son during his trial. Kasady however seemed to care for his mother, causing him to dig up her grave in Maximum Carnage, totally contradicting his prior account in which he took glee in her death. He also claims he killed his grandmother when he was younger, pushing her down a flight of stairs. By his early twenties, he had been convicted of eleven murders, although he bragged about committing dozens."<br>  <br>  He might not mesh well with the current image of the Spider-Man franchise. You know, with little kids wearing Spidey shoes and socks?|`|8f4c9ca28f181f4c1f8729b27fcdd202aa	One symbiote (Venom) is enough. Carnage wouldn't be all that different or interesting|`|f54f2ef281b02ebc76e6104013052334aa	There was one game that was focused on Carnage. It was for the SNES and the Genesis platforms, and it was called: Maximum Carnage. The game was released in the mid-'90's and allowed the gamer to play as Spider-man or Venom. The game was based on comic storyline of the same name. On a side note; Carnage is dead in the comics.|`|834e49d3bae86765bd01b3e28aa519dbaa	carnage has been in games... and he cant be in a movie until AFTER venom is introduced considering venom is carnage's 'parent'...|`|084e25d976363b80a09cea83fd33847baa	Yeah!!!

bb3de3ca6513172530fef5133f6bc55caa	Ugly Betty follows the daily life of Betty Suarez, a young woman from a struggling Latino family, who works as an executive assistant at MODE fashion magazine. Most of her female co-workers are more attractive than she is; they often humiliate and insult her because of her appearance (her only friend is Christina, the Scottish seamstress). Suarez is not very interested in fashion and is sometimes clueless about the company's motives and organizations, although she does have a passion for photography. Her boss, the womanizing Daniel Meade (who initially turned her away because of her appearance), also lacks fashion experience. However, both are intent on performing well at their jobs, even at the expense of those trying to stop them.<br>  <br>  It's based off the the Mexican counterpart La fea más bella.|`|a6f5efb2cbade02a525b433574402dc8aa	she's an ugly duckling, she takes the braces off her teeth then she's a swan. on the way her innate integrity confounds the machinations of evil attractive witch and her gay familiar and various thin, pretty imps and pixies, fairy tale for the more mature hard of thinking.|`|f04c6c80d5cbc9c9da6f3df285f9bf7baa	Ok, I'll try.

Considering this is a top fashion magazine, its fairly obvious that this girl from Queens, New York does not fit in at all, as the rest of the people who work there are tall, perfectly groomed, and obsessed with their appearance. They seem like clones. She is short, wears  thick glasses, has unkempt thick eyebrows, braces and obviously has no sense of style. The person who greets her pretends there is no job available, as he realises she does not fit into the ideals there and sends her away. Fortunately for our heroine, the owner of the magazine Bradford Meade spots her and also realises she is nothing like the sort of girls his son,Daniel, who has just become editor in chief of the publication usually goes for. He has been afraid his sons reputation will damage the magazine if he has an affair with his assistant. He calls Betty that night and offers her the job. She is excited as she knows Bradford is the magazine owner. This cheers Betty up as she has just been dumped by her long-time geeky boyfriend (she was expecting him to propose).<br>  The next day she starts the job, but unfortunately the receptionist looks shocked she's there and almost doesn't let her in. (the receptionist is dating Daniel and assumed the position would be hers when it was advertised). Eventually Betty gets past and goes to the room where Daniel is holding his first meeting and he doesn't know she is his assistant. She embarasses herself by walking straight into the glass door of the room upon her arrival and is met by horrified looks from everyone in the room. After an awkward first morning she meets Christine (Ashley Jensen from 'Extras') who works downstairs in the Closet (the room where all the seasons clothing collections are stored for fashion shoots and for the use of the staff) and she introduces her to other people who work there. They are much more down to earth and friendly. She starts to feel more comfortable.<br>  Now not everybody is pleased about the appointment of Daniel as Editor In Chief of Mode. Wilhemena Slater (ex beauty queen/model Vanessa Williams) believes the job should have been hers. With her  *** kissing assistant Marc she resolves to ruin Daniel and gain the position she believes is rightfully hers. Betty's initial incompetance at the job sees her dreaming up all manner of scenarios to achieve this. <br>  <br>  Later on we find out that Daniel's new appointment was due to the sudden death of ex- editor Fey Sommers who was well respected by the staff in a tragic car crash. There is also a suggestion that Bradford may know more about this than he is letting on and has hired a private investigator(?)/detective(?)/general creepy guy to try and make evidence disappear. <br>  <br>  Every week Betty comes up against more challenges. She makes a mistake (which could result in her sacking) but lives to fight another day, because of her honesty, and ability and desire to do the right thing and the friends she has down in the closet room. Daniel has now realised what an asset he has in her and is on her side. <br>  <br>  This is as far as I have got, hope it was useful. Sorry it rambled on a bit.|`|628a981f86b42fb08d1f7cc52dfa2c5caa	Its based on the Devil Wears Prada film, but if you ain't seen it:<br>  <br>  Unattractive girl, gets hired at highly fashion-orientated magazine company, worked to the bone, losses The Book, gets in trouble, finally become attractive, leaves the job... end of!|`|c12cd5a10bad9706ce2ff246880bbc6baa	Betty wanted a job on a proper magazine but instead got hired to be an assistant at mode by the dad of editor to stop him sleeping with his assistants, 1st he tries to get rid of her now shes a vital person but still not properly accepted at mode...yet watch it its good but obviouse|`|e87f1c407f4d2389ce889a2002cff8d3aa	She is ugly. <br>  Her name is Betty.<br>  She works at a fashion related job.<br>  She is not at all fashion related.<br>  Comedy|`|3beDEefRaa	Ugly Betty is about a young girl fresh out of college who lands the job of her dreams working at a fashion magazine. The only problem is she has no fashion sense, no idea how to behave in that environment and worst of all is totally ugly.<br>  The only reason she was hired is because her bosses father wanted an assistant for his son that his son would want to sleep with.<br>  Being Betty though she has pulled her boss out of some very sticky situations and each week we see her and Danial ( her boss) get closer together.<br>  There is also the bitchy executive who wants Danial's job and will stop at nothing to get it, the mystery with Danial's father and his affair with dead editor in chief, Fey, and the woman who keeps giving hints to Danial via anonymous phone calls about the affair.<br>  On top of that you have the on-off relationship between Betty and her ex boyfriend, who cheated on her with her arch enemy and now keeps trying to win her back.<br>  Confusing enough for you?!!<br>  Seriously though it is a cool show and well worth watching.

Also,  if the kid is worried what his parents will say, or an adult is stupid, they may not report they were shot and end up with an infection and die.   <br>  <br>  It also works the other way.  I know of a guy who shot himself with a 44 mag and barely had a scratch...

fac1c9c3b6fa937737c35c6e21f6363faa	It's an old Hollywood "trick."  In the olden days of film making, actors used British accents when they were either (A) playing an "intellectual," or (B) playing a villain.  American moviegoers wanted to easily distinguish the protagonist from the other characters.  In "Rome," it's most likely they do this to appear more intellectual - it subconsciously makes you feel smarter, or at least trying to feel smarter.|`|f639092fc925bbd55e7b6272eeb17334aa	So that you can follow every word they are saying. <br>  <br>  You have to admit you can't follow a word of the Passions of Christ while you can understand every word spoken in The last Temptation of Christ.<br>  <br>  ROME is just trying to be understood.|`|AA11850032	because the actors and actresses have horibble talent being able to impersonate accents|`|c78773d9f1ce15019cc0ac173631923daa	Because unfortunately, the 'powers that be' who make this show credit the audience with such a low IQ that they assume they would not be able to read the subtitles if it was made in Italian with authentic Italian performers.

dcfb578874333848742d04522f8f7a92aa	It was everything I had hoped it would be. I have been a die hard for years. Rocky was a childhood hero for me. I enjoyed all of them of course. The only one that was a bit disappointing to me was Rocky V. I think that this one caught all of the heart and character that Rocky Balboa is all about...what Rocky V missed even though it was the one that sent him back to "the neighborhood". <br>  <br>  I do not want to ruin anything about the movie. I highly anticipated it. I saw loads of trailers on it, and as many different trailers as I saw...they did not give away the story. There were many surprises. It was a great film and we plan to go see it again with other family members. If you enjoyed Rocky and Rocky II ...this one will not be a disappointment as it truly brings his character FULL CIRCLE...<br>  it touched on all of the emotions...laughter, tears and plenty of "edge of the seat" excitement.

f4cc06720ee5147ef58788be047bdf95aa	Yes, me! Sign me up! My friend made me watch it, and I hated it! Maybe because I'm a devoted Rent-head, all musicals seem a little crappy compared to Rent, but HSM sucked bad. The music was so unoriginal, and the whole thing was just one big scam to get money from kids.|`|7bc59807ddbcc55e7a54516a6a027780aa	Happy Holidays|`|c98178d9efa19f35dc0877676eee4639aa	I think it's an ok film for children and young teens, of course it's not a great film, but at least it 's not violent and it leaves a message.|`|3a7f4f647586bcc40965ffe7842aadafaa	whats hsm?|`|3e62268f401c0665ff9312997df67486aa	I LOVE HSM!!!!!!!!!

She knew what she was getting into when she married him.|`|0a360ce4919629913c60b72438a5beaaaa	I completely agree, all he thinks about is his whack martial arts. whatever!|`|64dad7beee317a2971a82dc398c9e0f5aa	at least he said that he was willing to give up his martial arts training on the weekends (or was it only saturday?) so that his wife could attend acting classes. What a huge sacrifice this guy is making. Plus, he was really paying attention to his kids in that episode where he talked about spending more time with them. Loved how he ran out of the room to talk on his cell phone when it rang-leaving the kids behind to fend for themselves while his son (i think it was his son) kept calling for him, "daddy? daddy?......"<br>  <br>  What an excellent role model he is. No need to worry about his children having "father" issues.<br>  <br>  yes, i am being sarcastic|`|AA11445783	he's not that unusual as far as being arrogant-most hot guys are-and his wife is in it for the money-HELLO??<br>  as for his clothes-he so looks foolish, but look at what he does to superficial people-who's really the whacked ones??|`|b2b90abc925c11392f9aeb69faa4f35daa	I totally agree! It really disturbs me to see what a piss *** father and husband he is. Selfish and arrogant. I feel so badly for his wife. She's screaming for attention and love from him. And it breaks my heart to see how his kids plead for his time. And what does he do? He goes and works out. <br>  <br>  I truly think he has a narcissistic disorder. His wife needs to leave him, take him for a bunch of money and MOVE ON.|`|3a60c46d933a93abd68a1c82b1976fd6aa	How about those scrub tops made specially to show off his guns?

My take....YES, he's quite an arrogant jerk and his suit was RIDICULOUS last night...he looked like a clown.  His wife is definately anorexic and she most likely has sufficient emotional scars from being married to an A** like her husband.  <br>  <br>  She needs to run very far and very fast to get away from him. He obvioulsy does not pay one iota of attention to her.<br>  <br>  Hopefully she will do well with her acting career and hopefully she'll eat a cheeseburger once in a while!!|`|AA12256572	Ditto....used to like the show as entertainment but can't watch the arrogant pri** any longer.... likes himself waaaaay toooo much!

It's a great show. Don't take any of it seriously though. Wicca and real witchcraft is way different. Anything you see on there is acting, scripted, and has nothing to do with paganism.

The next morning when we eventually woke he was so mad that he threatened to chase us with a knife outside.|`|54afeaac36bb5fe0d28935f21d6a274daa	I stole a 6 foot statue of Athena (the Greek goddess) off a living room area in a locked psychiatric ward (on which I was working). I then took pictures of her around town and sent ransom notes to the unit. I kept this up a couple of weeks. I later was again able to return it with no one knowing who did it. This was during the time of the  Olympic games in Atlanta, where I live. Now how you can carry a 6 foot statue through a locked unit where people are supposed to be on guard??? - that's another story....|`|65b1af9618e7d6bab8fb29f6deaf32b9aa	May not sound funny if you were not there, but still funny years later. <br>  Me and my mom set my brother up real good. First keep in mind my brother reallyyyyyyyy believes in ghost and everything else.<br>  <br>  Remember when the furbees were really hot, well I got one, did not open it cause it was a xmas gift. My brother and I went out for a few minutes and when we came back (remember me and my mom had this planned), she comes running to us saying there are wierd voices coming from my bedroom. So of course I go check and now I come running out and tell them that furbee (still in box) is opening his eyes and demanding to get out of the box. Anyway to make a long story short, my brother really freaked out big time, saying it is possessed and I had to get rid of it NOW.......... I know I did not explain it good but believe me it was good. My brother had it coming cause he is always playing jokes on people. Just wanted to ad, we were adults when this happened, so to see a grown up guy act like this was a riot.|`|f1ea8bada9ce95fdcbff3ddc9399fea7aa	Put shaving cream on the palm of the dominant hand of a sleeping person and tickle his/her face with a feather.

AA10739032	The only thing I know of was a cheesy Justice League special from the late seventies called "Legends of the Superheroes."  Green Lantern was a part of that, but it was awful and I don't think it's even available for purchase in any form.  GL was played by Howard Murphy.  When I say cheesy, think the old 60s Batman and triple it!  Hope that helps.  Everything else that includes GL is animated.

He tells the elders about all that he saw and what he's learned (basically that penguins haven't offended any great god to shorten their food supply, but man has been taking away their food).  Then his pack activates and the scientists come and all the penguins tap dance together.

a3eb0e8dd85a19141250e3da9058a85aaa	I think it was "The Dark Secret of Harvest Home", a made-for-TV movie. The details I remember are: There is an older midwife/granny-type woman who is in charge of all the women. She goes around making house calls, and one of the men she takes care of is a guy with no tongue and who can't see. His wife brings him books on tape from the library. Near the end of the movie, the guy in the young couple that moved to town decides he will spy on the women, and he sees whatever it is they do. At the end of the movie, he has had his tongue cut out and is made blind too, and his wife is also bringing him books on tape from the library.<br>  <br>  Is that it?<br>  <br>  And here's what one person said on IMDB: <br>  ". . . there can be little doubt King was influenced by Thomas Tryon's outstanding novels "The Other" and "Harvest Home."<br>  <br>  The TV movie version of the latter book, titled "Dark Secret of Harvest Home," was the second and final adaptation of Tryon's work and was originally aired in 1978 . . . Unlike 1972's "The Other," "Dark Secret of Harvest Home" was presented as a mini-series with a superb cast headed by Bette Davis."|`|7e34c9da95e7899b9d0bfc2c0ae70553aa	try googling pagan movies, you might find something. and wickerman left me soooo frustrated. they should have at least had some bullets in the gun so he can take some people with him. geez...|`|26441ce5247e2d6d3324972cd87e870eaa	its the original wicker man. it starred edward woodward and christopher lee.|`|Y4vWPqKBaa	I want to say the Stepford Wives but i cutting off heads makes me say NO!  Do you have an actor who was in the movie or a time frame of when it was showing?
AA10662560	I really liked the movie.  I thought V was both a terrorist and a hero, which I know is a dangerous stand to take in today's America!  He was a terrorist to a "terrorocracy - " a government which ruled it's people via fear.  So it's almost like two negative integers equalling a positive one - he fought against an evil government in order to free the countrypeople, and that's really what a hero is.  The movie and V's character motivated me to keep a more watchful eye on our government, all things (read: Patriot Act) considered.  I'd have stood behind him.|`|36699acbd2e679dcc5ee14a54f2a8492aa	This was probably my favorite movie of the year.  I liked it because even though it was not action heavy, it still made you think about certain things could snowball into a greater disaster.  V was probably both of those things because he wanted to be and he felt what he was doing was the only way.|`|51Pafu6Raa	it ia a good movie, but sort of confusing..... I"m stilll wondering the samething too about v being a terrorist or not, but I'm leaning towards a no, because he was helping the people|`|7e34c9da95e7899b9d0bfc2c0ae70553aa	v is a hero in the eye's of the revolution and a terrorist in the eye's of the government. (did you know that the guy who played v is the same guy who played mr. smith in the matrix?)|`|MtiEnvaoaa	V for Vendatta was a great movie because it explores many subjects about whats right or wrong. V, in his eyes, is doing what is right. Like Voltaire (i think) said "The ends justify the means" V was trying to open the eyes of the british people. So, yes he is a terrorist. But a hero? He was merely an idea of freedom. V didn't save anyone from any villians. (exept Evey, but that was so he had a succesor.) I think the V was also just trying to get revenge on his oppesors. Hope this helps.

Understanding is not always what he is. I agree his show is helpful to some "but he is not all that and a bag of chips." He needs to learn to be a little less aggressive with people then maybe the understanding part will fall into place.|`|AA10625290	Dr. Phil has done a lot of good with his show, but there are a couple of things that bug me about him.<br>  <br>  One is that his show is becoming like the Jerry Springer Show, with too much focus on sensationalism and wierd sex.<br>  <br>  The other is that Dr. Phil can be a very controlling person with a strong need to always be right. When he gets all macho and starts saying stuff like "we could get into a pissing contest if you want" it just shows that he can be a real jerk when he wants to be.<br>  <br>  Never forget that to Dr. Phil helping people is a business and a career above all else. If you look up his history before he had a show, you will find that he has not been above helping corporate lawyers screw the little guy by helping pick juries that ruled in favor of corporations who had harmed people.|`|a106030adeae0802270c217a444d5f0baa	He is absolutely the best!

f22500d08149aa18a03eafcd71480959aa	I saw it too. I cried and cried and I made my kids watch it this morning so that they would appreciate what they have better. I think that the best thing that average people can do is to mentor a disadvantaged child, there are programs everywhere, just to give them a little inspiration. I volunteer my time during school breaks, I could do more though. But living in a place where there is so much pain and disappointment makes it easy for a child to give up and not think they can succeed. My boyfriend and I were talking about how at such a young age those kids are as sweet and hopeful as any. But fast forward a few year after the world has hardened their hearts, and they turn to the same streets that hurt them. It is such a sad sad vicious cycle.<br>  But Camden is not the only community like that. They are in every state in the US.|`|NkN4HoFpaa	I did watch it.You can collect food for your local food bank.|`|01cfb362d7210b2939d3722728a7eefeaa	it was very very very sad|`|1d6e8cb8365e1f454494ca1e53cac02daa	I thought it was really sad, but I also thought that it was great of Diane Sawyer to show people the poverty we have right here in America, we hear so much about Africa and other countries, that sometimes you don't even realize that we have it right here in America!|`|548481a26ed8b4141dd79f418a1e8e30aa	That show simply broke my heart!<br>  The little boy "Ivan" was so sweet and thankful for everything that he had.  It made me want to scoop him up and take him home with me.<br>  Our country needs to start taking care of our homefront so we don't have tragic circumstances like these children in Camden, NJ.<br>  We tend to think of the unfortunate only during the holidays, but homelessness and poverty is sadly a year-round problem for these poor children.|`|AA11025669	Ask yourself just exactly who's fault it is that those kids live like that. Is it the governments? No, it goes back to the parents. If they wanted a better life for their children, they would get up and go and make one. Our government has told them otherwise. Don't say they can't, they can. It's in all of us, it's just that some of us choose not to do so! Oh yeah, if anyone ever shows up on your doorstep and says, "I'm from the government and I'm here to help", turn and run, run as fast as you can because they will make your life a living hell if you let them.|`|AA10714512	The plight of the children in Camden was terribly sad, but there is little you can do for them from a distance.  I think the solution they offered was basically to get involved in your own community.  Whether we recognize it or not, there are children in every city in America who go to bed hungry.  Find a mentoring program in your community and get involved.  Volunteer for Big Brothers/Big Sisters or at the local Boys & Girls Club.  <br>  <br>  And I don't think it's fair to put the blame solely on the parents or, for that matter, the government.  Take Billy Joe's family, for instance, his dad was doing the absolute best he could to keep that family together.  Now some of the parents were just terrible, but not all.  As far as the government goes, our welfare system is definitely broken.  We need to find a way to make sure the money that goes into the system (the tax dollars we as citizens have paid into the system) gets to the people who really need it the most, that the benefits that are available aren't being taken advantage of by people who are defrauding the government for an easy buck, and that we are preparing those in the welfare system for a day when they can depend on themselves not the government.|`|WL9tTEHbaa	i saw it yeah it was so sad<br>   to help i give my stuff 2  the Salvation Army and the Good- Will ,  u can donate money to the boys and girls club|`|bc570fe6f04e9a7a95a11de7d1b1923aaa	I know, I thought about all last night!

However, due to the advancing age of its members and the inability of finding musicians whe were capable of playing this demanding book, the Heath family decided to disband the group. One reader, Mr.John Hunt has noted (in private correspondence) that currently (2005) "..vocalist Denis Lotis is currently touring Britain with a farewell concert before emigrating to Australia, having recently married an Australian girl." Last mention of him October, 2006 still performing in Tasmania.

This document contains the set of standards followed when handling the American flag, such as its display, storage and destruction.<br>  <br>  "(d)The flag should never be used as wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery.  It should never be festooned, drawn back, nor up, in folds, but always allowed to fall free.  Bunting of blue, white, and red, always arranged with the blue above, the white in the middle, and the red below, should be used for covering a speaker's desk, draping the front of the platform, and for decoration in general."|`|mvESyHvJaa	Sand Camo

However, the careers of the people in Friends haven't gone well since the TV show finished - so they may decide a movie would be a good move!|`|OBwqjS8maa	I seriously doubt it. There's been speculation about a Friends movie ever since the show ended, but I wouldn't be surprised if it never happens.<br>  <br>  And I disagree with what the poster above said about the cast's careers not going well...Matthew is doing great in Studio 60, Jennifer's been in several films, Courteney has the new FX Show Dirt, Phoebe's HBO tv show was praised (even though it was cancelled), David continues to do theater and, well...ok, maybe Matt's career hasn't been stellar, but there's always hope!

But remember to have a secure place to keep your wallet. <br>  <br>  I think you should also bring shorts incase its sunny, and 3 quarter length throusers incase its cold. Full length trousers can get muddy in even the nicest weather, and you dont want anything that will touch the floor in those pissy wet portaloos. <br>  <br>  Bring a hat to stop the top of your head from burning, and to sheild your eyes from the sun.

9bQ09ndnaa	No you've got it all wrong. You've got to embrace who you are and what you like. Ok do not conform to society and what other girls say is what's in and all. I was always called werid and all but people like me. Don't hide or try to supress who you are and your interest. I mean I always loved fantasy and science but as time went on I mean it wasn't something I made a part of my life. Now I've seen great anime movies and I love them. My ex boyfriend George brought anime into my life and fantasy and epic movies and now I still watch them and even read fantasy books. I LOVE ALF! and all 80's cartoons. I love being dorky and corny and cheezy and silly.

It's well worth it.<br>  <br>  I can't really choose just one favorite, but,<br>  <br>  "Half the World Away"<br>  "Talk Tonight"<br>  "Let's All Make Believe"<br>  "Where Did It All Go Wrong"<br>  "Little By Little"<br>  "Sunday Morning Call"<br>  "Don't Look Back In Anger"<br>  <br>  are among the top choices for me. But "Half the World Away" and "Talk Tonight" are top two by miles, in my humble opinion.|`|4f5c0deb5fed9c732f652ea4cbb585f7aa	the very well known one... what else? wonderwall of course!|`|5CvOkqxIaa	ah Ha, ''Gin n Tonic''!|`|Md7y5KSYaa	Most people will say Wonderwall since it is the most overplayed and unfortunately thats all the Oasis a lot of people know!!! I for one cannot name a single favorite ballad but here goes...."Champagne Supernova" "Stop Crying Your Heart Out" "Let There Be Love" would all have to be contendors for that title in my book and though it is overplayed indeed it is a masterpiece "Wonderwall"|`|bJPmglKwaa	Wonderwall's my fave then Champagne Supernova and Half the World Away...<br>  Oasis are awesome!|`|jk79bZeuaa	Wonderwall and Champagne Supernova. <br>  <br>  In fact, one of the more tasteful covers of Wonderwall I've heard was done by an artist named Ryan Adams.

ea3ed6de35f69708e0ecf30b3774cd4baa	oh yes the scene with the men old and young alike walking down the hill, chests glestening was awesome and worth the price of the movie<br>  when he threw the spear at xerxis, when the queen stabbed whats-his-face (everyone clapped in the theater) and when he killed the messenger<br>  Or I could just say from the opening credits to the ending credits was my fave|`|8895056583b447b2e166c33b6f5993e4aa	Great movie except his wife is the biggest hussy ever!  He would've killed when he got back, good thing he died.  She dropped her clothes REAL quick!|`|CRvLgPfoaa	Mine was when Marty went back to 1955 and got hit by the car, And he saw his mother whan he woke up.|`|WfGtcUbJaa	Definitely when Leonitus asked each of the Arcadians what there profession was, then asked the Spartans.<br>  "It seemed like I've brought more soliders..."|`|EthnWyI0aa	That move was sooo awsome!

They think just because we are getting up to get a snake and go pee that we need to be able to hear the commercial. Well I for one like to go pee alone!!!|`|AA11961239	They do this to get your attention.  So if you are the kind of person that goes to the refrigerator to get a snake during the commercial, you'll still be able to hear the ad.  It's a marketing technique plain and simple
ENPbAYbxaa	As the first person answer stated, the girls were adopted as babies by two different people. The girls met each other when they accidentally ran into each ther at the mall. I believe Ray's wife died before Tamara was adopted.|`|WuVHoL4Paa	they were both adopted to different people. then they met and theyre adopted parents moved in together so the sisters could be together.|`|AA12141892	Yes, Reays wife died before the adoption. The two sisters were seperated as babies to different parents, Lisa and ray. One day, Lisa and ray just happened to be at the mall with both Tia and Tamera..the sisters accidentally bombed into each other then they saw that they looked a like, then found out that they had the same b-day and everything...so the sisters pleaded their parents to live together because they did not want to be seperated...that's how they became a family

I also liked "Audition" and "Ju-On 2".|`|sQEMFUcgaa	I liked the original Ring movie - the US version was crap. The Australian movie Wolf Creek scared me shitless, more so as I used to live a few hours from there. <br>  <br>  There is a Korean movie called Old Boy - not scary but has a nice little twist and a very graphic scene at the end.|`|81795f6f3a94b68b76772b69ce36918faa	Audition<br>  Men behind the sun<br>  Flower of flesh and blood<br>  <br>  Those are 3 good ones|`|AA12072871	For sheer creep affect...go with the film that is grandaddy to Ring and Grudge...Kairo. This baby started the genre...watch it and you will see why. Quiet...and sparse...this Japanese dissertation of how we are allowing the world wired web and technology to further isolate us from each other...is simply one of the creepiest horror movies to come out in ages.

138zXDQhaa	Grindhouse theaters were "ghetto theaters," typically located in poor neighborhoods, which showed "exploitation flicks," films which were too graphically violent or overly-sexual in nature to be shown in mainstream theaters. They would usually show two films back-to-back, with trailers in between. They were extremely popular in the late 60s, and throughout the 70s, but began decreasing in popularity around the 80s, due to the arrival of VHS tapes. As far as I know, there are few, if any Grindhouse theaters still around in the US.|`|WuVHoL4Paa	its 2 films one by quentin tarantino and some other guy. they play both shows in one viewing|`|y0ASEEBBaa	Good examples of a Grindhouse film:<br>  <br>  Blood Feast<br>  <br>  Blackula<br>  <br>  I Dismember Mama<br>  <br>  Nightmares in a Damaged Brain<br>  <br>  I Eat Your Flesh<br>  <br>  I Drink Your Blood<br>  <br>  Night of the Living Dead<br>  <br>  Cannibal Holocaust<br>  <br>  Love Camp 7<br>  <br>  The Beast in Heat.<br>  <br>  Basically it's a movie, usually made to shock, on the cheap, and with a poster that's actually better than the film itself.  Occasionally some Grindhouse fare does go on to rightfully claim classic status (Night of the Living Dead for example) but most of the time it's total trash.<br>  <br>  The posters would usually feature a scantily-clad woman, and make an outrageous claim that the film was made using some cinema technique that didn't even exist ("Filmed in glorious SexiVision and RawColor").<br>  <br>  God I miss those movies...|`|MdYjJjyJaa	Grindhouse is the name of the double feature film by Rodriguez and Taratino.

CLH4Wrcbaa	Shin Chan is one of the most liked serial by children. When ever mothers have a get together or meetings , the most favourite topic is how their children love watching shin chan and the things that r done by him. Though he is a darling of most of the children as they identify themselves with him but to mothers he is a nightmare since children try and copy him most of the time. in my opinion he is the most mischievous boy i come across. Where ever shin chan is trouble automatically follows. He should not have been named shin chan but trouble boy. I always tell my kids i pity his mother and if i ever had a child like him god knows what i would have done|`|1g4RNkewaa	shin-chan is a lovely kid.Me and my friends just love him.naughty but lovely.|`|VoPyzBELaa	I love Shin-chan, I think its funny and irreverent and smart.  I would equate it to South Park in America except Shin-chan is more kid-friendly for lack of a better word.  I think he acts like a typical kid who might be a little more savvy about how to annoy his parents.  He is mouthy, selfish all they things that kids are.  I don't understand why he isn't more popular in America|`|b2fcf5954cfa35d9ce40c680abf428f9aa	ABOUT crayon shinchan?? ok, i can tell u about my ideas on this-----<br>  Crayon Shin-chan ( Kureyon Shinchan) is a manga and anime series written by Yoshito Usui. The American version of the manga is titled "Crayon ShinChan" while the UK, Italian, Catalan, Galician, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, French, German, Hindi and American version of the anime is titled Shin-Chan. The series has also been translated into Chinese as both Japanese and Chinese humor are very similar. The series follows the antics of a five year-old boy Shinnosuke Nohara, his parents, neighbours and friends. This story is set in Kasukabe, Saitama Prefecture, Japan. The show is called "Crayon Shin-chan" because "crayon" signifies the fact that it is a tool commonly used by kindergartners and that Shin-chan goes to kindergarten. "Shin-chan" is the affectionate name for the main character.<br>  <br>  Crayon Shin-chan first appeared in a Japanese weekly magazine called Weekly Manga Action, which is published by Futabasha. Crayon Shin-chan began broadcasting on TV Asahi on April 13, 1992, and has also been aired by the anime television network, Animax across Japan and Latin America. Starting in April 2006, Crayon Shin-chan celebrated its 15th anniversary by starting each broadcast announcing the fact that it is 15th anniversary no matter what season it is. This feature is expected to end in April 2007.<br>  <br>  Much of the humor in the series stems from Shin-chan's occasionally weird, unnatural and inappropriate use of language, as well as from his inappropriate behavior. Therefore much of this humor is untranslatable for Western readers and viewers, and a few jokes can't be translated into other East Asian languages. In Japanese, certain set phrases almost always accompany certain actions; many of these phrases have standard responses. A typical gag involves Shin-chan confounding his parents by using the wrong phrase for the occasion. For example, Japanese usually announce that they are back when they have returned home. Shin chan would make the mistake of saying "you are back," instead of "I am back."<br>  <br>  The storylines used in the anime series are based on those in the comics most of the time. Although the stories have been softened for television, there has been controversy about the program, primarily from parents who argue that the main character, Shin-chan (like Bart on the American animated series The Simpsons), sets a bad example for children. Although some westerners have called Shin-chan the "Bart Simpson of Japan," there are fewer similarities than differences between the two characters. In particular, Bart is older and apparently more intentionally mischievous than Shin-chan, many of whose misdeeds seem to stem more from simple ignorance of correct behavior due to his age (however, this is less the case in Funimation's English translation of the anime, which frequently takes artistic license with the original dialogue). This provides the writers with ample opportunity to write gags based on age-inappropriate behavior, such as Shin-chan's occasional use of extremely formal language.|`|ef5815b05cbc33106a5d0958839a0a11aa	OMG i LOVE him!!! and that show!!!!! its sooooooooooooo freaking awesome and cute i was totally crushed and missed it when they took it off of adult swim a while back but now its back!!! im soooooooo happy!!

1e98b8d13992d5e456c90684fb4c13a0aa	Tooru ends up with Kyou and marries him in the near future. (People thought they got married after chapter 133 but were only confused by the proposal Kyou was talking about. He was asking her to travel with him, not marry her. Though looking at the final page of the series they had a traditional wedding.)<br>  The curse is fully broken by Kami (not Akito, though they share the same body) when he finally understands why the Cat didn't want to be reborn.<br>  No one dies that wasn't already dead before the series began (Kyouko, Katsuya, Akira, Kyou's mother.)<br>  Tooru is hurt when the ground collapses beneath her and she falls down the side of the hill. Akito did not push her despite rumors, she was about to accept her hand in friendship when the ground fell away.<br>  Though it's never said, its assumed Akito will no longer die young as Kami no longer shares her body.<br>  Yuki gets together with Machi. Machi is Kakeru's half sister and the brown haired girl in the student council who can't stand things to be perfect.<br>  Hanajima and Kazuma don't get together, he and Kunimitsu hire her as a live in maid. (Many people we confused as they appear in the final chapter together. They were unable to read the Japanese text with it so assumed they'd gotten together.)<br>  Momiji nevers tells Momo that he is her sister. Instead Takaya has him give up on his family and have a new dream of finding the best girlfriend. (People also believed Momiji told Momo but in the chapter after his curse is broken we see Momiji give up on his family. In the final chapter he talks about Tooru and getting a girl, not Momo.)<br>  <br>  Final pairings:<br>  Kyou/Tooru<br>  Yuki/Machi<br>  Shigure/Akito<br>  Hatori/Mayu<br>  Ayame/Mine<br>  Ritsu/Mitsuru<br>  Haru/Rin<br>  Hiro/Kisa<br>  Kureno/Arisa<br>  Kakeru/Komaki<br>  Kyouko/Katsuya<br>  Akira/Ren<br>  <br>  Momiji, Kagura, Kimi and Nao remain single. Though Nao does confess to the Pri Yuki Fan Club leader that he likes her, its never confirmed if anything happens between them.|`|AA12144282	Tohru ends up with Kyo. They kiss and get married near the end of the manga. Yuki goes out with Machi. There wasn't any reason given as to why Yuki likes her but it seems they are mutually attracted to each other and became lovers in the end. No one dies that I remember except for Akito's mother I believe. The curse was released by Akito and she is no longer evil like in the beginning. Tohru only got injured when she fell off the cliff pushed by Akito. She did not die and the manga ended happily.|`|gC1GUZntaa	you really should read it. Its a good book. i really enjoyed it|`|25d86bb09cd10f9a1c4dc88423dfeacbaa	Yes, Tohru finds a way to break the curse and she and Kyo-kun get married while Yuki and Machi start dating (and everybody wondered why I prefered Machi and Yuki over Tohru and Yuki =_=").  Shigure and Akito end up getting together and Akito and Tohru form a better friendship.  Hiro's mother gives birth to a baby girl and names her Hinata.  Uo-chan and Kazuma get together also.  Hatori and Mayu get together (the English teacher).  Momiji's sister gets to know her older brother.  Haru and Rin get back together (I think...) I'm not entirely sure if Kisa and Hiro develop a relationship though (which I think they should!! They are so cute together XD)|`|68ec1dd18733bf14ea616458df922cb9aa	if you didn't know, akito is a girl ,tohru ended up with kyo, yuki ended up with machi, shigure and akito ended up together...you may not believe it but they really did, and the curse was broken, tohru and akito became good friends and yukis girlfriend is a person on student council with him if you didn't know, thats what happened at the end put shortly

YlrAYrqQaa	increible !! las mujeres se la pasan haciendo chistes feministas en los cuales dejan por el piso a los hombres y entonces un hombre intenta desquitarse y se molestan que paresen fieras y hasta te dicen gay,,,, <br>  <br>  muchachas estamos en chistes y humor ,, como mismo ustedes hablan de nosotros nosotros estamos en el derecho de hacer chistes de ustedes,, esto es CHISTES Y HUMOR , NO SE TIENEN QUE MOLESTAR ,,,, <br>  mira yo todos los dias veo chistes feministas ,, ahora que veo estos me alegra ,,, <br>  <br>  JAJAJAJAJAJA estan buenisimo tus chistes ,, felisitaciones y ahi te dejo tu estrella ,,, <br>  saludos ,,|`|9ryMdyW5aa	jaja =D yo te paso otros que me enviaron!!:<br>  <br>  Para cuando Dios hizo a la mujer, ya estaba en su sexto día de trabajo de horas extras. Un ángel apareció y le dijo: "Por qué pones tanto tiempo en ésta?" <br>  Y El Se?or contestó: "Has visto mi Hoja de Especificaciones para ella?"<br>  Debe ser completamente lavable, pero no ser de plástico, tener más de 200 piezas movibles, todas cambiables y ser capaz de funcionar con una dieta de cualquier cosa y sobras, tener un regazo que pueda acomodar cuatro ni?os al mismo tiempo, tener un beso que pueda curar desde una rodilla raspada hasta un corazón roto y lo hará todo con <br>  solamente dos manos."<br>  El ángel se maravilló de los requisitos. <br>  "Solamente dos manos....Imposible!“<br>  Y este es solamente el modelo estándar? <br>  Es demasiado trabajo para un día...Espera hasta ma?ana para terminarla.“<br>  No lo haré, protestó el Se?or. Estoy tan cerca de terminar esta creación que es favorita de Mi propio corazón. Ella ya se cura sola cuando está enferma Y puede trabajar días de 18 horas." El ángel se acercó más y tocó a la mujer.<br>  "Pero la has hecho tan suave, Se?or <br>  "Es suave", dijo Dios, pero la he hecho también fuerte. No tienes idea de lo que puede aguantar o lograr.<br>  "Será capaz de pensar?" preguntó el ángel.? <br>  Dios contestó:<br>  "No solamente será capaz  de pensar sino que razonar y de negociar"<br>  El ángel entonces notó algo y alargando la mano tocó la mejilla de la mujer....<br>  "Se?or, parece que este modelo tiene una fuga... Te dije que estabas tratando de poner Demasiadas  cosas en  ella"?<br>  "Eso no es ninguna fuga... es una lágrima"  lo corrigió El Se?or. <br>  "Para qué es la lágrima," preguntó el ángel.<br>  Y Dios dijo: "Las lágrimas son su manera de expresar su dicha, su pena, su desenga?o, su amor, su soledad, su sufrimiento, y su orgullo."<br>  Esto impresionó mucho al ángel "Eres un genio, Se?or, pensaste en todo. La mujer es  verdaderamente maravillosa"<br>  Lo es!  La mujer tiene fuerzas que maravillan a los hombres. Aguantan dificultades, llevan  grandes cargas, pero tienen felicidad,? amor y  dicha. Sonríen cuando quieren gritar. <br>  Cantan  cuando quieren llorar. Lloran cuando están  felices y ríen cuando están nerviosas. Luchan por lo que creen. Se enfrentan a la  injusticia. No aceptan "no" por respuesta cuando ellas creen que hay una solución mejor. Se privan para que su familia pueda tener.  Van al médico con una amiga que tiene miedo de ir.  Aman incondicionalmente. Lloran cuando sus hijos triunfan y se alegran cuando sus amistades consiguen premios. Son  felices cuando escuchan sobre un nacimiento o una boda. Su corazón se rompe cuando muere una amiga. Sufren con la pérdida de un ser querido, sin embargo son fuertes cuando piensan que ya no hay más fuerza. Saben que un beso y un abrazo pueden ayudar a curar un corazón roto.  <br>  <br>  Sin embargo, hay un defecto en la mujer: Es que se le olvida cuánto vale.|`|EzUy2uI1aa	Hoy amaneciste de chingaquedito no???<br>  Solo recuerda que tu madre (si es que tienes) también es mujer.<br>  <br>  Como veo que tengo muchos pulgares hacia abajo ahi les va:<br>  <br>  - En que se parecen los hombres a los espermatozoides<br>    de que de 100 000 solo uno sale bueno.<br>  <br>  - En que se parece un telefono público a un hombre<br>     que ninguno sirve, y el que sirve esta ocupado<br>  <br>  - Que la mujer sin el hombre<br>     Educar otro animal<br>  <br>  - Como se le llama al pedazo de carne que rodea la vagina<br>     mujer  ( a no ?verdad?)<br>  <br>  Ojala te gusten y me cambies el pulgar hacia arriba  :(|`|IWXg6Tiyaa	jjjjajaaa|`|kVW8Yy3Kaa	uuummmmmmmm,muy malo,que no tienes madre guey,de seguro eres gay,con razon paquita la del barrio les tira duro a los hombres<br>  rata de dos patas. <br>  <br>  ahi te va uno,POR QUE HIZO DIOS PRIMERO AL HOMBRE?<br>  POR QUE ECHANDO A PERDER SE APRENDE.<br>  <br>  ESTAN UN POCO FUERTES TUS CHISTECITOS,BAJALE NO?|`|naUxp9SWaa	(también hay chistes para que ellas se rían)<br>  <br>  ?QUé HAY EN COMUN ENTRE LOS HOMBRES QUE FRECUENTAN BARES DE  SOLTEROS? <br>  Todos son casados. <br>  <br>  ?COMO HACER PARA QUE UN HOMBRE HAGA ABDOMINALES? <br>  Colocando el control remoto entre los dedos del pie. <br>  <br>  .<br>  <br>  ?COMO SE LLAMA UNA MUJER QUE SABE DONDE SU MARIDO ESTá TODAS LAS NOCHES? <br>  Viuda. <br>  <br>  <br>  ?POR QUE ES TAN DIFíCIL HALLAR HOMBRES BONITOS, SENSíBLES Y CARI?OSOS? <br>  Porque normalmente ellos ya están enamorados. <br>  <br>  <br>  ?QUé  DIFERENCIA HAY ENTRE UN HOMBRE Y UN MANGO VERDE?<br>  El mango madura.<br>  <br>  <br>  ?CUANDO UN HOMBRE DEMUESTRA QUE TIENE PLANES PARA EL FUTURO?<br>  <br>  Cuando compra 2 cajas de cerveza.|`|tvZIMd71aa	Buuu, espantoso, cual fué el chiste? yo te puedo contar mucho mejores.....|`|ucAt05Ygaa	no inventes no me gusto|`|979b1756c214760449edcfc5c620ac6caa	ajaja okay okay tengo que aceptar que estan chistosos <br>  por mi parte (mujer)  no tengo problemas con esos chistes <br>  jajaja me gusto mas el de<br>  <br>  la hoja blancaa jajaja .....rompecabezaaa muy bueno :D|`|PTFb9Fsbaa	muy buenos chistes, yo te apoyo.|`|etz6M3hTaa	aguas obrador ya que se nota estas damas que aceptan su realidad y las que le vieron lo chistoso saben que no tienen que ver nada con ellas, hasta algo tontas tienen que ser para tomarsela enserio!! que verguenzaa el representar a una mujer y quejarse de eso apoco no? jajajajaj ,se la toman enserio jajajaja ahi mujeres ustedes siempre seran todo lo contrario del chiste captan!!??|`|gqFGCtXYaa	Ay Dios!! mio quien te hizo tanto mal.

tuvcxnJXaa	It depends...there are different methods for recording.<br>  <br>  If you ever hear a band say they recorded something "live" in the studio, then that means all members of the band were in the studio, playing the song(s) together as they will eventually sound on record.   They then mix them afterward with the producers.<br>  <br>  More often than not, though, band members will come in separately, and play along to a pre-recorded tape (usually a 4-track demo, recorded by the band previously) of the parts of a track already laid down.    They are then mixed together (usually) seamlessly to sound as if they were recorded "live".   <br>  <br>  Hope this helps a little.<br>  <br>  EDIT : I don't think there's one set and defined method to what you're asking.   I think it's probably on an artist-by-artist, or maybe even song-by-song basis.    There's no one correct way that it's done.   Every musician has their own way of recording, and the producer also has some input.   I understand your question, but I don't think there's one single, across-the-board answer.|`|b32501726d33018adfee15dc84a32f79aa	I'm going by the *little bit* of vocal recording experience I have.<br>  <br>  When I did vocals for a few tracks many years ago, like Deke said I was using a pre-recorded instrumental track.  There was a bit of cutting and pasting (so to speak) when it came to the final product, but all-in-all the majority of one particular take was used.<br>  <br>  Now this was hardly a major-label, high-tech effort...this was done on a much more local, "grass roots" level.  My guess is that with a bigger budget and better equipment the game could completely change.  Not only would you have the opportunity with better mixing equipment and engineers to be more selective with certain sections to be used, the portions that may not be considered to be ideal could be cleaned up and improved.  It's hardly a one-shot deal at that level.|`|hmsCFQocaa	It can be done that way and has been done that way, but since that's harder than just making one take, usually that's the way to go.<br>  <br>  Ray Parker Jr.'s "Jack And Jill" is an example of his doing ALL the vocals, even the backing ones. No way that happens in one take.|`|NQ37mnWkaa	It all depends on the individual singer. <br>  <br>  Some will take the easy route, sing it once and have it spliced in ~ which is so much easier now that things are digital, as you no longer have to literally copy, cut and paste bits of tape!<br>  <br>  Others {more-so pre-digital} insist on singing the entire song through from start to finish. This is how some songs end up with subtle differences in the choruses that aren't in the album's printed lyrics ~ singing the same thing take after take can lead to vocal ad-libs.<br>  <br>  <br>  Having read a 'making of' book about Fleetwood Mac albums, I'm aware that for several songs they would use a bit from one take, and a bit from another, but each of those bits had been sung 'fresh' in each take. The only real 'copy and paste' they did was on the studio version of 'Rhiannon', for a particular part of the drum track.|`|fk3OcaoPaa	Alot of times it depends on what type of song it is. if there is only one singer but there are overlaps in the singing then thats a sure key that it was recorded individualy and that the vocals alone had been recorded 2 or 3 times. <br>  <br>  like the song "light up the sky" by yellowcard is the perfect example.<br>  during the bridge there is no possible way for Ryan Key to sing it altogether. i've seen them live in concert and during this part of the song he is always gasping and trying to get his breath back. so he recorded vocals for the song in at least 3 different sets|`|hJP9y6kjaa	There will always be multiple takes, but if you hear *exactly* the same vocal oddity at the same timing, then yeah, it was probably a cut and paste job. Which sucks that someone would do that - there's Pro Tools for you. Means the singer can't sing, or couldn't get a decent take for more than one chorus.<br>  <br>  There should *not* be cut and pasting going on... there *should* be multiple takes, then selecting the best take or combinations of the best takes.... but not straight cut and pasting, except maybe in electronica, etc.<br>  <br>  <br>  Saul|`|wqg3GrI2aa	When I worked in my local recording studio for mainly local bands to record.<br>  <br>  We would normally take bits from the 3 takes, so even though it sounded like one take, it would usually be about a mix of three takes.<br>  <br>  Although, it makes for more work to splice it all together instead of using one take.

ZM7PLcfOaa	Charles Manson è un personaggio famoso per essere stato il mandante di alcuni dei più efferati omicidi che hanno scosso l'America e il mondo intero dalla seconda metà del 1900. Ha avuto vari soprannomi, tra cui "Mr Satan" o "Satan Manson" e la sua espressione "diabolica", nonché la sua crudeltà, lo hanno reso un simbolo del male personificato. (Ma in realtà non aveva nulla a che fare col Satanismo, infatti diceva di essere Gesù Cristo del XX secolo). Nonostante venga identificato come un "serial killer", Manson, stando alle indagini effettuate dalle forze dell'ordine, non ha mai ammazzato nessuno e si è limitato solamente ad impartire ordini criminali a terze persone.<br>  <br>  Per avere ulteriori informazioni vai qui: <a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Manson" rel="nofollow">http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Man...</a>|`|JUtgu3ITaa	a me marylin Manson fa schifo...sinceramente mi repelle...in quanto a qst Manson nn so niente ma passerò ogni tanto per sapere qlc...io so che Manson ha detto di essere la reincarnazione del demonio...poi che vuole entrare nella testa della gente per farla impazzire..e che vuole terrorizzare i bambini americani sempre cn le sue canzoni...k schifo baci<br>  <br>  Grace Kelly|`|c8ab492f00254fbe4bd0c9a6714007c1aa	Nel 1989 Warner, originario di Canton (Ohio), fondò il gruppo Marilyn Manson and the Spooky Kids. Già agli inizi cambiò molti membri, tra cui i più importanti furono Daisy Berkowitz, Scott Putesky, Twiggy Ramirez e Madonna Wayne Gacy, meglio conosciuto come Pogo. Più tardi entrò a far parte del gruppo una ragazza di nome Nancy, che tuttavia creò non pochi problemi. In seguito la band accorciò il nome in Marilyn Manson, in quanto sufficiente ad identificare la loro "sostanza". Successivamente però vi furono problemi con altri membri: Manson fu costretto a fare da balia per un certo periodo a Brad, che aveva iniziato a fare uso di eroina. Così, dopo innumerevoli promesse di disintossicarsi, decise di allontanarlo dal gruppo.<br>  <br>  Il primo album dei Marilyn Manson fu Portrait of an American Family (1994) che non fu un autentico fallimento, nonostante il loro produttore, Roli Mossiman, volesse orientarli verso il genere pop. Così si rivolsero a Trent Reznor, del noto gruppo industrial metal Nine Inch Nails, per riregistrare l'album. Si verificarono però altri problemi: dapprima in quanto il pezzo "My Monkey" che compariva nell'album era in parte di Charles Manson, e questo fece irritare molto l'associazione delle vittime (la canzone uscì ugualmente); poi per la presenza nel libretto che accompagna l'album di una foto di Brian da bambino, sdraiato su una poltrona, nudo. La foto era considerata pornografia infantile e, per evitare strascichi legali, non fu mai pubblicata. Ancor prima dell'uscita dell'album cominciò il tour con i Nine Inch Nails e le Hole di Courtney Love: fu durante questo tour che Brian iniziò ad assumere cocaina.<br>  <br>  Nel 1995, i Marilyn Manson andarono in tour con i Danzig. Questo tour era stato caldamente consigliato dalla casa discografica quale ottima pubblicità per "Portrait of an American Family" ma, dato che la band considerava quell'album già defunto, partecipò al tour controvoglia. L'autista del pullman dei Danzig, Tony Wiggins, entrò quasi subito in amicizia coi Marilyn Manson, preoccupandosi di offrire ad ogni membro della band tutto il divertimento malsano di qualsiasi città o paesino in cui si fossero fermati. Una delle sue trovate più originali fu quella di organizzare una pseudo-consulenza psicologica che avveniva nel backstage dei concerti, dove le persone venivano legate e, con una videocamera puntata addosso, interrogate. Non poche volte Tony si trovò sul punto di finire nei guai a causa di ciò. Ma non fu del tutto inutile, poiché un paio di queste confessioni furono pubblicate nell'EP "Smells Like Children": la prima traccia ("The Hand of Small Children") è infatti un "interrogatorio" di Tony ad una ragazza. Anche a metà disco è presente una delle performance di Tony: la confessione di una ragazza che aveva molestato il cuginetto di 7 anni. Il pezzo forte di "Smells Like Children" è sicuramente la cover degli Eurythmics "Sweet Dreams", singolo tra i più famosi di tutta la produzione del gruppo, che la casa discografica inizialmente non voleva pubblicare.<br>  <br>  Nel 1996 Marilyn Manson, ancora sotto l'ala protettiva di Trent Reznor, pubblicò il famoso Antichrist Superstar, album dal titolo profetico che condusse Manson alla vera fama di star internazionale e che, allo stesso tempo, aumentò l'ira e le critiche delle organizzazioni clericali. Nel 1998 è il turno di Mechanical Animals, musicalmente molto valido album-tributo al glam rock di David Bowie, T-Rex e Alice Cooper. Del 2001 Holy Wood, album molto apprezzato dai fan della band, in cui si citano personaggi come Kennedy, Lennon e Gesù, tutti e tre visti come dei capri espiatori, condizione in cui Manson si identificava (in quel periodo era stato incolpato di aver istigato il tristemente noto massacro della Columbine High School, avvenuto nel 1999 in Colorado). Importante fu la sua collaborazione nel film di Asia Argento "Ingannevole è il cuore più di ogni altra cosa".<br>  <br>  Recentemente la band è entrata in studio di registrazione per l'atteso nuovo album, che dovrebbe uscire in questa primavera con il titolo Eat Me, Drink Me.<br>  <br>  Il disco uscirà in Italia il 5 giugno. Questo nuovo lavoro del "Reverendo" è basato su un suo periodo personale di pesante depressione e il tutto è stato riversato nei testi cupi e malinconici dell'artista. Un disco che si preannuncia come il ritorno di Manson in tutte le sue principali caratteristiche quali Teatralità nei suo prossimi tour e testi profondi<br>  <br>  spero ti basti.........ciao :)|`|rdCRU31Baa	è charles manson..un pazzo omicida che tra gli altri ha ucciso anche la moglie del regista roman polanski (spero si scriva cosi)<br>  <br>  comunque gli è stata trovata una lista di vip che avrebbe dovuto uccidere se non fosse stato arrestato. <br>  aveva creato una vera e propria setta che lo seguiva come fosse un predicatore.<br>  <br>  un pazzo furioso con grandi manie di protagonismo insomma|`|2b60b163851ffe1c462af7bb91e05a52aa	Vai su google e digita Charles Manson, troverai molte notizie!|`|Q4Ze0Bojaa	Il simpaticissimo Charles Manson.

naUxp9SWaa	otro igual(y la estrella)<br>  <br>  Una ni?a con un cuerpo espectacular pero cansada de trabajar y no tener una buena oportunidad para sobresalir en la vida, tomó una decisión drástica; a falta de oportunidades decide buscarse un viejo, pero bien viejo, pero con harta plata, así pensaba ella, me caso, y en la noche de luna de miel, lo mato a puro sexo y quedo viuda, joven y con dinero. Así que logra por fin su propósito y logra enganchar con un viejito magnate due?o de una enorme fortuna, el que prendado por el escultural cuerpo de la chica, le ofrece matrimonio de inmediato. El día de la boda fue fastuosa y el viejito lo único que quería era consumar el matrimonio y llevarse a la ni?a a la cama, y la ni?a lo único que quería era darle sexo al viejito hasta dejarlo muerto y amanecer al otro día viuda y rica. Así que escapándose los novios de la fiesta con sus propósitos fijos, llegan a la pieza del hotel, el viejito apresuradamente empieza a sacarse la ropa y entra al ba?o, mientras que la ni?a sacándose el vestido y quedando solo con los encajes puestos se tira sobre la cama esperando al viejito para consumar sus oscuros propósitos, lo ve salir en calzoncillos, con unos inmensos fonos antirruidos y un perro de ropa apretándole la nariz, mientras se calzaba un condón descomunal recauchado con goma de cámara de neumático en su pene monstruoso. La ni?a lo queda mirando estupefacta y contrariada preguntándole; “Mi cielo?, el condón lo entiendo, pero porque los fonos antirruidos y el perro de ropa en tu nariz?, a lo que el viejito responde.. “Mijita, hay dos cosas que detesto en la vida, una es los chillidos de las mujeres y lo segundo el olor goma quemada.|`|57d935d67dc458acbe4d4b7dc2d5d1beaa	pobreeeeeeeeeee xD|`|bcdffb51ddfe275be6632f6b799fa53aaa	hehe sta bien  pero podrias mejorar un poco,no?|`|vzzxEJcHaa	jajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajaja<br>  buenisimo ahi te va una estrellita|`|yAMs9Cikaa	mmmm  pues no esta tan mal,,,pero hay nejores,,,|`|37d2aaa9a4e953af74f2d6f8cd7f92b3aa	Auch, dejame buscar el mio.|`|I3Tc4kDbaa	HELLO MOTO!!<br>  <br>  A mi si me gusto!!!<br>  <br>  Saludines de la mas boninamente de Los Cabos BCS Mex<br>  <br>  Me Pushi!!<br>  <br>  ...........................|`|8a6e24a287b48bf945dd6dfc8b8f7d8eaa	Es bueno que tú te rías de tus chistes, porque a mí no me hizo gracia ni es picante.|`|LMERC8Tqaa	jajajaja mas vale chiquito y jugeton que grande y bobolon ;)|`|ac14902eadc964655edd6e5ac5263922aa	jajajajajaja esta bueno!!!|`|uKeuDYnzaa	jajajajajajajajajajajajajajaj<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  muy bueno!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  pasa x el mio

FPCPy3Nhaa	usually the tune comes with the words. If you have a basic Chord progression, play that over and over humming various melodies until one comes to you. if you dont have a progression, take a song you like (or he likes) and "borrow the chords" and use the method i mentioned above to hammer out a melody.

Entonces decidimos subir por la puerta vecina a la que venia el guarda, porque mi esposo llevaba el carrito de bebé con muchas bolsas de la compra y yo llevaba a mi hija en brazos, como "protección", pensamos que si el guarda nos veía, estaríamos más seguros al subir.<br>  Mi esposo subió primero para acomodar el carrito de bebé y después ayudarnos a nosotras a subir, pero para mi sorpresa, el guarda dio la se?al de partida justo en el momento en que yo ponía un pie en el estribo, y el tren arrancó a mayor velocidad de lo acostumbrado, sin darme tiempo a sostenerme debidamente. Mi esposo no llegó a sostenerme más que de un brazo, y mi hija y yo comenzamos a caer, porque me estaba resbalando de sus manos. Jamás voy a olvidar su mirada, nada podía hacer para sostenernos. Mis piernas estaban ya casi rozando las ruedas del tren, cuando miré por última vez el rostro de mi esposo, apreté fuertemente a mi hija y dije "ya está Dios mío", (Para todo esto yo era absolutamente consiente de todo lo que ocurría a mi alrededor, escuchaba las voces de la gente que estaba en el andén diciendo, que por favor alguien nos ayudara, los gritos de las personas que iban en el tren, mi esposo que me decía que me agarrara fuerte. Es increíble la lucidez que experimente en segundos), pero justo en el momento en que me estaba dando por vencida, ya estábamos más abajo del tren que otra cosa, mi brazo se zafó de la mano de mi esposo y comenzamos a caer, me entregué y ocurrió el milagro, sentí una mano en mi espalda y una paz increíble. Cuando reaccioné estábamos sobre el andén sanas y salvas. Era imposible que algo así sucediera, no tengo una explicación racional. Sólo me queda dar gracias a Dios y a mi ángel de la guarda. ?

7fd1e50b341fbe4626a07216268a464baa	Porque al momento en que nacieron, sus padres ya eran supersaiyajins, y por lo tanto les heredaron de genes la transformacion.

En eso el ni?o llorando corre con su mama y le dice :"mami,mami, ya no me compres KINDER SORPRESA" <br>   <br>  Había una vez un granjero que tenía gallinero con 180 gallinas y estaba buscando un buen gallo, un día el granjero va al pueblo y se mete a una gallería y le dice al gallerro: Buenas tardes, quisiera un gallo que me pisara mis 180 gallinas.<br>  Entonces el gallero saca un gallo enorme, fibroso, la cresta parada, ojos azules y un tatuaje en el pecho de los Rolling Stones<br>  El granjero se lo lleva y a la ma?ana siguiente lo saca de la jaula y lo mete al gallinero, el gallo sale corriendo,casa la primera gallina, le echa dos palos, sale, agarra a la segunda, le echa el primero, y cuando le está echando el segundo se queda frito.<br>  El granjero lo mira y dice:<br>  Qué che gallo me vendieron, se echó a dos gallinas y ya no pudo, entonces casa al gallo de la cresta y se lo lleva al gallero y le explica lo que paso.<br>  él se disculpa y le saca otro gallo ***** con la cresta amarilla, ojos grises y zapatillas nike y le dice al granjero: este es el Nico, pruébelo y después me cuenta.<br>  El granjero se va y repite la maniobra, lo suelta en el gallinero, el gallo sale desesperado, se voltea a la primera gallina, agarra a la segunda y la empala, a la tercera le hace el 69 y cuando está echándose la cuarta revienta y cae muerto en el gallinero.<br>  El granjero enojado caza el gallo de la pata, se lo lleva al gallero y le dice: este es el segundo gallo que me vendes y revienta, más vale que me des un gallo bueno o le prendó fuego a tu tienda...me entiendes?<br>  Entonces el gallero le sacó un gallo, todo flaco, pelado sin plumas, ojeroso, jorobado y con zapatillas de hule de llanta y le dice al granjero: mire, se?or , es lo único que me queda, se llama TITO y llegó de casualidad y el granjero se lo lleva pensando:<br>  ?Qué voy hacer con este gallo flaco?....llega, lo suelta en el gallinero y el gallo sale enajenado y se echa a las 180 gallinas, y pega la segunda vuelta sale corriendo y se echa al pastor alemán entonces el granjero le pega dos chin....gadazos y lo mete a la jaula<br>  Que fenómeno este gallo!!, piensa el granjero;

Cogió sus libros sin decir una palabra y salió de la clase para nunca más volver. <br>  Sin embargo, mientras cruzaba la puerta, la respuesta del profesor fue clásica. <br>  Totalmente serio, respondió a su pregunta: No le sabe dulce, porque las papilas gustativas para el dulce están en la punta de la lengua y no al fondo de la garganta.

naUxp9SWaa	exelente<br>  <br>  Tres tios se mueren y estan en la cola para entrar en el cielo. San Pedro le pregunta al primero como se han muerto.<br>  <br>  "Pues mire, yo estaba sospechando que mi esposa me enga?aba, asi que hoy vine pronto a casa para sorprenderla y me puse a buscar por toda la casa; al cabo de un rato oi un ruido en el balcon, me asomo y allí estaba el hijo de pu ta, colgado de la verja del balcón para que no le viese; como vivimos en un quinto piso, lo que hice fue pisarle en las manos para que se cayese, pero no veas lo que aguantaba el mamón, al final conseguí que se desprendiese, pero fue a caer entre unos arbustos y no se mató, asi que fui a la cocina, agarré la heladera y se la tiré encima.

FGZ0TiiUaa	De las mejores preguntas que he leido , muy controversial xD<br>  <br>  Pues yo si le temo a enamorarme, por que en toda mi vida nunca he tenido alguna relacion que valga la pena recordar o que haya transcendido en aspectos mi vida.<br>  <br>  Nunca me han dejado buenas experiencias mis 'relaciones' (que para ser honesta nunca he tenido novio jajaj =p)<br>  <br>  Soy muy 'zacatona' no me he querido dejar enamorar de verdad y siempre salgo huyendo y me justifico , siempre culpando a la otra persona por todo, pero la verdad es que nunca doy ese 'GRAN PASO' el de abrir mi corazon, y entregarme por completo, simplemente todavia no estoy lista<br>  <br>  Creo que muchas veces la gente confunde el sentir atraccion por alguien, que de verdad amarla, yo al menos los tipos que he conocido han sido solo 'simple atraccion visual' pero no he encontrado un alma que en verdad haya transcendido en mi vida y que me haya querido hecho sentir por primera vez lo que es EL AMAR.<br>  <br>  Por ello siempre estoy como ha la defensiva resguardandome de que no me hagan da?o, tal vez malamente pienso que 'para que enamorarme' si no es el indicado y al final no va a valer la pena y solo voy a terminar de nuevo con una mala experiencia =p o tal vez me estoy predisponiendo a mi misma a que asi sea, hasta creerme esa idea<br>  <br>  En este momento deseo enamorarme , por que es una de las mejores etapas que puedes vivir (es mejor que cualquier alcohol, droga, estimulante, alimento, chocolat....etc cualquier vicio que tengas)<br>  <br>  'Mhhh.. creo que estoy hablando muy personalemente ' xD y la pregunta era en general del amor . Yo creo que influyen muchas cosas a que temamos enamorarnos, por instinto cuando nos quemamos la primera vez, la segunda tratamos de prevenirla, cuando nos quemamos la segunda vez , la tercera somos MAS precavidos que la segunda y asi consecutivamente.<br>  <br>  Es instinto de supervivencia, (solamente los masoquistas, PERO ES AMOR!!! KE MAS DA JAJAJA xD) continuan amando , ahora cuando se divide la PASION CIEGA, AMOR, OBSESION<br>  <br>  el problema es cuando tu ya decides por fin de nuevo hacerlo y la otra persona , no siente lo mismo por ti, eso si que es dificil, por que al final de cuentas en el corazon no se manda y por mas que tu ames a alguien no es suficiente, NO BASTA.<br>  <br>  Entoces cada vez un corazon roto es mas dificil de repararlo por que , con los a?os se va volviendo mas y mas fragil, no digo que todos seamos asi, conozco gente que puede enamorarse facilmente de un mes a otro, a veces desearia ser asi, pero otras veces lo medito bien y pienso que me gusta ser como soy<br>  <br>  por que el dia que mi corazon se entregue, va a ser de verdad, tal inexperto 100% , pero sincero, por que cuando El llegue , (que espero saberlo) no se va a limitar en abrirse por completo. Aunque muchas veces tengo miedo de por tanto postergar el enamorar, termine quedandome sola<br>  <br>  Pero por lo pronto solo tengo 21 a?os xD jajaja, asi que creo que todavias me faltan otros 20 a?os para preocuparme por eso, por lo pronto pienso que todos debemos continuar con nuestra rutina diaria y el verdadero amor llegara cuando menos te lo esperes, y te daras cuenta desde la primera vez que lo veas llegar.|`|n8XZalL0aa	pues  la verdad  debo de confesar que estoy enamorada pero pues yo no queria pero pues que le hacemos eso no se puede controlar <br>  a mi me daba miedo enamorarme por miedo a no ser correspondida y lamentablemente eso me sucedio quiero muchissimo a un chavo pero pues el quiere a otra pero pues que puedo hacer verdad bueno ese no es el tema pero como te digo mi miedo era y no ser correspondida<br>  saludos!!|`|rGQqzbANaa	Ese no es mi caso, Abyss; a mí me horroriza dejar de hacerlo.<br>  Au revoir|`|25BcPFXJaa	POR QUE ME CONOZCO!

Hoy he trascendido esos miedos concientizando que cada persona persigue intereses diferentes y que carezco del poder para obligar a alguien a que me quiera como soy. Hoy busco compatibilidad de caracteres, gustos y espectativas afines y siempre respetando la forma de ser, pensar y actuar de la chica que me pudiera interesar y dependerá de mí la decisión de volver a sufrir o no, por ello se que esos miedos han sido superados.

naUxp9SWaa	tipos de mujeres...<br>  <br>  El comportamiento de las mujeres en el amor, varía de una a otra..., he aquí algunas de las categorías encontradas<br>  (no son definitivas, porque con las mujeres "uno nunca sabe")<br>  <br>  LAS ASMATICAS<br>  Pueden hacernos pasar un susto, porque durante el amor, parece que les diera un ataque de asma, de ellas solo se<br>  escucha: ahhh, ahhh, ahhh,ahhh<br>  Consejo: tenga siempre una bombona de oxígeno o el número de emergencia de una ambulancia, no sea que entre<br>  en crisis de verdad.<br>  <br>  LAS MATEMATICAS<br>  Son fáciles de reconocer, ya que suelen repetir en la cama: MAS, MAS, MAS.<br>  Consejo: a ver si le ense?a otras operaciones matemáticas ej. súmele a su cuarto, divida sus piernas, eleve el<br>  miembro a su máxima potencia, halle la hipotenusa y dele una buena raíz.<br>  <br>  LAS PI?ATERAS.<br>  Son aquellas que durante el acto amoroso (entre ahogos y suspiros) solo exclaman: DALE!, DALE! MAS DURO!,<br>  DALE!, como si Ud. nunca hubiese estado en una fiesta infantil dándole palo a una pi?ata.<br>  Consejo: dele lo que pida.<br>  <br>  LAS RELIGIOSAS<br>  Al momento de alcanzar el éxtasis exclaman frases tales como: AY SAN PATESTE, QUE DIVINO SAN<br>  GENOVEVO, AY SANTA ROSA QUE DIVINA ES ESTA COSA.<br>  Consejo: sámpeselo.<br>  <br>  LAS ACROBATAS<br>  Quieren hacer en la cama mil y una piruetas. Cierta vez una pidió que saltara desde un escaparate, para probar mi<br>  puntería y resulta que me le fui encima con todo y escaparate, parando la susodicha en el hospital con polifracturas<br>  y yo en la policía por intento de asesinato.<br>  Consejo: no las complazca en todo porque se mal acostumbran.<br>  <br>  LAS COMPARADORAS<br>  Después de hacer el amor comienzan con que: EDGAR ES MEJOR LENGUA Y LITERATURA, MIGUEL TIENE<br>  MAS GRANDE EL COPETE, ETC.<br>  Consejo: cuando termine de hacer el amor métale una gasa en la boca y péguele un adhesivo, porque sino<br>  terminará traumatizado.<br>  <br>  (continua)<br>  <br>  hace 2 semanas<br>  LAS COMPARADORAS<br>  Después de hacer el amor comienzan con que: EDGAR ES MEJOR LENGUA Y LITERATURA, MIGUEL TIENE<br>  MAS GRANDE EL COPETE, ETC.<br>  Consejo: cuando termine de hacer el amor métale una gasa en la boca y péguele un adhesivo, porque sino<br>  terminará traumatizado.<br>  <br>  LAS LOCUTORAS<br>  Creen que sus manos tienen la oportunidad de ingresar al mundo de la farándula y micrófono en mano le dan rienda<br>  suelta a sus dotes artísticas y narrativas (sin cortes comerciales), imitando a las narradoras de noticias.<br>  Consejo: permítale que narre con cierta regularidad.<br>  <br>  LAS RISUE?AS<br>  Se la pasan toda la noche muertas de la risa como si lo que Ud. está haciendo es una payasada<br>  Consejo: póngale seriedad al asunto<br>  <br>  LAS ASESINAS<br>  Viven diciendo: SI ME LO SACAS TE MATO!!!!!

Estas fueron las medidas de cada uno : El primer General decide que el examinador le tome las medidas desde la planta del pie hasta lo alto de la cabeza. Después de medirle, el examinador le atribuye una cuantía de 183.000 dólares. El segundo General decide estirar los brazos hacia los lados, manteniéndolos paralelos al suelo, y pide ser medido desde la punta de los dedos de la mano derecha hasta la punta de los dedos de la mano izquierda. El examinador le mide y le atribuye una cuantía de 205.000 dólares. Cuando llega el turno del tercer General, para espanto general, pide ser medido de la punta del pene hasta los testículos, a lo que los presentes responden con una sonora carcajada. El examinador intenta disuadirlo durante algunos minutos, pero al ver que el general estaba firme en sus propósitos, decide concederle su voluntad, mandándole bajarse los calzoncillos. Coloca una punta de la cinta métrica en la extremidad del pene y cuando está comenzando a medir, exclama :<br>  - "Pero dónde diablos están los testículos!"<br>  A lo que el general responde : - "En Vietnam"|`|pimVybsIaa	El chiste es muy bueno me gusto jajajaj<br>  y respecto de la duda de algunas yo creo que la relación del chiste con salma hayek radica en que ahora que esta embarazada, ella a provocado esa escasez de alimentos, ya que como come!!!!<br>  <br>  jiji =)|`|qRJcZMR4aa	Que tiene que ver Salma Hayek con ese chiste... ??<br>  jajaja me gusto mas el chiste de Guille, a el si le daba la estrellita, lastima! solo pude votar positiva su respuesta!|`|vJTzZ1wBaa	jajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajaja...|`|oZYmm5o2aa	>> Jajaja xD;!

bzXjhfqZaa	Los mejores artistas del tatuaje se han reunido para mostrarnos sus nuevos dise?os y la vida de ellos en su nuevo local, todo esto puedes verlo en miami ink, y si compartes tu fanatismo por su arte.A partir del 6 de Marzo MIAMI INK estrena su segunda temporada, donde Kat se integra al equipo y Yoji comienza a tatuar profesionalmente. Los episodios se emitirán todos los martes a las 21:00 horas por PEOPLE + ARTS.<br>  <br>  El calor sube mientras los chicos (y la chica) de South Beach regresan a People+Arts para estrenar la segunda temporada de MIAMI INK. Los entintados íconos de Miami serán puestos a prueba al enfrentarse a la administración de su exitoso negocio, hacer malabarismos con sus horarios y mantener su credibilidad como artistas. MIAMI INK 2 arranca su segunda temporada a partir del 6 de marzo todos los martes a las 21:00.<br>  <br>  En esta segunda etapa de MIAMI INK, el equipo disfruta de un éxito sin precedentes tanto como artistas y administradores de empresas, pero es también una época muy intensa en cuanto a reflexiones personales, cambios de vida radicales y decisiones trascendentes.  Cada uno de los tatuadores va aprendiendo que más no es necesariamente mejor al verse confrontados a elegir entre su arte y su vida personal, sus relaciones, sus posesiones, su familia y el negocio.<br>  <br>  Además de los artistas que ya conocimos en la primera temporada de MIAMI INK, Ami James, Chris Nu?ez, Chris Garver y Darren Brass, la única mujer del grupo, Kat Von D (de origen latinoamericano), se une a ellos de tiempo completo. Joven dinámica y atrevida, Kat comenzó por sustituir a Darren durante la temporada anterior pero pronto se volvió insustituible en el estudio. Conocida por sus bellos retratos cutáneos, Kat había trabajado con Chris Garver en Los ángeles y viene a aportar el encanto femenino a este “club de Toby”.<br>  <br>  Por otro lado, también en esta temporada, Yoji Harada, el leal aprendiz y joven padre ahora ocupa un lugar oficial en el equipo. Aunque todavía le falta para consumarse como un artista del tatuaje, día a día consolida sus destrezas y por si fuera poco trata de equilibrar su tiempo para compartir con su esposa y su bebé.<br>  <br>  En esta temporada de MIAMI INK el equipo además se da a la tarea de buscar a un administrador para que Yoji tenga más tiempo para tatuar. Tras un casting organizado en la Internet, llegan cinco individuos a South Beach cuya entereza y paciencia serán puestos a prueba: Joel de Massachussetts; Talia de Naples, Florida; Josie de Chicago; Lee de Miami; y Anthony, de California.  Estos afortunados elegidos tienen que hacer mandados, soportar bromas pesadas, lidiar con clientes, y someterse a rigurosos exámenes sobre todo lo relacionado a los tatuajes.  Al terminar los periodos de prueba de cada uno, los due?os del estudio, Ami James y Chis Nu?ez seleccionan al candidato idóneo, quien, además de administrar el negocio, aparecerá de planta en el programa.<br>  <br>  Esta nueva serie de MIAMI INK se concentra en las historias de los clientes.  Los televidentes ya saben que hay mucho detrás de cada tatuaje – y de cada artista- mucho más de lo que las apariencias pudieran mostrar.  Desde historias familiares hasta sus actuales prospectos románticos y sus relaciones, conoceremos asimismo los motivos y pasiones detrás de la carreras y detrás de los artistas<br>  <br>  Saludos!|`|511de820aaed2c7c63f309bad2dc0740aa	Los horarios son distintos, el taller esta en Miami, a mi me encanta esa serie, hacen unos tatoos increíblemente bellos, los mas q me gustan son los q hace Kat, ella de un retrato el tatuaje de personas y le quedan igualitos, con facciones y todo, aunque todos son muy buenos, los mas q me gustan son los de ella|`|RpHPAjJmaa	Si la veooo y me gusta mucho, lo que me parece gracioso es que casi nunca se quejan por el dolor cuando les hacen los tatujaes..y siempree quedan satisfechos jejejeje en realidad me gusta este programa ademas son bn sexys los tatuadores!!!!<br>  y lo veo en people and arts!|`|2HHhHk5haa	Si lo he visto y me gusta mucho porque me gusta saber el significado de los tatuajes de la gente y ademas hay muchas historias tristes y lindas, como tambien hay una gente que se tatua por estupideces.

Dice el otro y pregunta: ?Cómo se llamaba?<br>  <br>  El primero responde: No me puedo acordar, ?cuál es el nombre de esa flor roja que tiene espinas alrededor?<br>  <br>  ?Una rosa? Responde el otro.<br>  <br>  Si, eso es, dice enérgicamente. Entonces la mira hacia la cocina y grita: ?Rosa! ?cuál era el nombre del restaurant al que fuimos la otra noche?|`|CKqgujz4aa	Erase una vez una fiesta de animales que acudieron de todos los tipos, a la hora de comer se dieron cuenta que no había tortillas y dijo el rey león:<br>  <br>  "Vaca anda por las tortillas" y ella respondió: "No; que vaya otro" entonces dijo:<br>  <br>  "Liebre arrancate por las tortillas" y esta dijo: "No, yo traje la botana; que vaya la tortuga, ella no puso ni mad...s"<br>  <br>  "De veras tortuga" dijo furioso el rey león "Ve tú por las tortillas"<br>  <br>  "Si" respondió la tortuga y se fue por las tortillas.<br>  <br>  Un rato después dijo el perro: "Mta! para ese caso yo hubiera ido por las tortillas" Entonces dijo el águila: "Es cierto, para la lentitud de la tortuga, mejor me hubiera ido yo volando por ellas" Entonces dijo también el canguro: "No pos la verdad que sí, yo hubiera ido en ching y me las hubiera traído en mi cangurera para no estar aguantando la lentitud de la tortuga" <br>  <br>  Y en eso la tortuga se asoma por la puerta y dice enojada: "SI SIGUEN CHING... NO VOY A IR!"|`|HNOAMUPlaa	Mueren 3 personas y van al Cielo.

Le dice a uno de ellos:<br>  - Tú, pasa a ese cuarto. <br>  El hombre obedece y San Pedro entra detrás.<br>  - Qué fruta trajiste???<br>  - Un kiwi.<br>  - Bien, metetelo en el c.u.l.o.<br>  - Es una broma???<br>  - Si no te lo metés, no entrás al cielo.<br>  El hombre hace un esfuerzo y cumple la orden, luego entra al Cielo.<br>  - Que pase el segundo hombre al cuarto, ordena San Pedro.<br>  La orden es obedecida por el sujeto, quien traía las manos a la espalda escondiendo algo.<br>  - Tú, que fruta trajiste???<br>  - Traje una sandía, contesta el hombre orgulloso.<br>  - Metetela en el c.u.lo., ordena SP.<br>  - Pero esto es una broma, no???<br>  - Si no cumplís la prueba, no pasás al Cielo.<br>  El hombre apoya la sandía en el suelo, se sienta arriba y comienza a introducirla en el lugar ordenado: por momentos lloraba como loco y después estallaba en carcajadas, así hasta que la sandía estuvo completamente adentro.<br>  - Muy bien, le dice San Pedro, pasaste la prueba y puedes entra, pero antes te hago 2 preguntas. La primera, Por qué llorabas???<br>  - Porque me dolía el culo.<br>  - La segunda pregunta: por qué te reías???<br>  - Porque me acordé que el que está después de mí, se trajo un ananá.|`|f36d074eaedecacb19e4c6942c9d4ecdaa	Estan 3 hombres esperando a entrar con el doctor entre ellos platican:<br>  El primero pregunta ?Por que estan aqui?

Así que uno planta su propio jardín y decora su propia alma, en lugar de esperar a que alguien le traiga flores. <br>  <br>  Y uno aprende que realmente puede aguantar, que uno realmente es fuerte, que uno realmente vale, y uno aprende y aprende... y con cada día uno aprende. <br>  <br>  Con el tiempo aprendes que estar con alguien porque te ofrece un buen futuro significa que tarde o temprano querrás volver a tu pasado. <br>  <br>  Con el tiempo comprendes que sólo quien es capaz de amarte con tus defectos, sin pretender cambiarte, puede brindarte toda la felicidad que deseas. <br>  <br>  Con el tiempo te das cuenta de que si estás al lado de esa persona sólo por acompa?ar tu soledad, irremediablemente acabarás no deseando volver a verla. <br>  <br>  Con el tiempo entiendes que los verdaderos amigos son contados, y que el que no lucha por ellos tarde o temprano se verá rodeado sólo de amistades falsas. <br>  <br>  Con el tiempo aprendes que las palabras dichas en un momento de ira pueden seguir lastimando a quien heriste, durante toda la vida. <br>  <br>  Con el tiempo aprendes que disculpar cualquiera lo hace, pero perdonar es sólo de almas grandes. <br>  <br>  Con el tiempo comprendes que si has herido a un amigo duramente, muy probablemente la amistad jamás volverá a ser igual. <br>  <br>  Con el tiempo te das cuenta que aunque seas feliz con tus amigos, algún día llorarás por aquellos que dejaste ir. <br>  <br>  Con el tiempo te das cuenta de que cada experiencia vivida con cada persona es irrepetible. <br>  <br>  Con el tiempo te das cuenta de que el que humilla o desprecia a un ser humano, tarde o temprano sufrirá las mismas humillaciones o desprecios multiplicados al cuadrado. <br>  <br>  Con el tiempo comprendes que apresurar las cosas o forzarlas a que pasen ocasionará que al final no sean como esperabas. <br>  <br>  Con el tiempo te das cuenta de que en realidad lo mejor no era el futuro, sino el momento que estabas viviendo justo en ese instante (...) <br>  <br>  Pero desafortunadamente, sólo con el tiempo... <br>  <br>  <br>  Jorge Luis Borges|`|kN5FExoZaa	Me ha ensenado a valorar la vida misma,a valorar a mis amigos  a mi familia y no pensar en la muerte como una salida,pues no lo es,la vida es maravillosa cuando contamos con amigos como tu,Wandis.

73akeRPLaa	Caro: a mí me gustan mucho tanto los chistes feministas como machistas, me parece que todo está bien si la cuestión pasa por reirse un rato y punto.<br>  Muchos de nosotros también somos seguros de nosotros mismos y creo que ninguno podría llegar a vivir sin el otro, ni los de mi bando, ni las del tuyo. <br>  Es la sal y esencia de la vida. Y lo que posibilitan éstas peque?as rencillas amistosas, es brindar una pizca de pimienta necesaria para que haya un poco más de diversión en la convivencia entre los dos géneros.<br>  Acá te mando algunos chistes machistas y otros feministas para emparejar la cosa:<br>  <br>  ?Qué hace una mujer fuera de la cocina? <br>  - Esperando que se seque el piso. <br>  <br>  ?Cuál es la diferencia entre una mujer y una foca? <br>  - En que una es gorda, tiene bogotes y huele a pescado, y la otra vive en el mar. (medio grosero, pero me parece gracioso).<br>  <br>  ?En qué se parece un clavo a una mujer? <br>  - En que los dos tienen cabeza pero ninguno piensa. <br>  <br>  ?Sabes por qué a las mujeres lo que les entra por un oido les sale por el otro? <br>  - Porque las ondas no se propagan en el vacio.<br>  <br>  ?En qué se parece una mujer y un globo? <br>  - En que el globo tiende a subir y la mujer sube a tender. <br>  <br>  ?Cuándo irá una mujer a la Luna? <br>  - Cuando haya que limpiarla. <br>  <br>  ?Y a Marte? <br>  - Cuando termine de limpiar la Luna.<br>  <br>  ?Qué es una mujer? <br>  - El motor de la escoba.<br>  <br>  ?Cuándo la mujer tiene más de una neurona? <br>  - Cuando está embarazada. <br>  <br>  Sabés cuál es la parte mas dolorosa de la operacion para el cambio de sexo hombre-mujer?<br>  - Cuando te extirpan el cerebro.<br>  <br>  Cuáles son las 5 partes de un chiste? <br>  Introducción, Desarrollo, Remate, Risas y una mujer que dice: "no entendí".<br>  <br>  Qué es una hoja de papel en blanco partida por la mitad? <br>  - Un rompecabezas para mujer.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ?Por qué los hombres tienen que estudiar en un submarino? <br>  - Porque en el fondo, muy en el fondo sirven para algo.<br>  <br>  En qué se parece un hombre al espermatozoide? <br>  - En que de millones sólo uno sirve. <br>  <br>  Por qué son mejores las pilas que los hombres? <br>  - Porque por lo menos las pilas tienen un lado positivo.<br>  <br>  Inteligencia masculina es una contradicción.<br>  <br>  En qué se diferencian dos camiones, uno lleno de cerdos y otro de hombres? <br>  - En la matricula.<br>  <br>  Los hombres son como los ba?os públicos, o estan ocupados, o estan llenos de mierd....<br>  <br>  En que se parecen los hombres y los chicles? <br>  - Entre más los pisas, más se te pegan.<br>  <br>  Por qué los hombres tienen más estómago que cabeza? <br>  - Porque es más fácil alimentarlos que educarlos. <br>  <br>  Cómo vuelves loco a un hombre en la cama? <br>  - Escondiéndole el control remoto. <br>  <br>  Las medidas perfectas de un hombre son: 80-03-80... <br>  80 anos de edad, 3 infartos, y 80 millones en el Banco. <br>  <br>  Por qué les cuesta tanto a los hombres el contacto visual? <br>  - Porque los pechos no tienen ojos. <br>  <br>  Qué les pasa a los hombres cuendo los castran? <br>  - Comienzan a pensar con la cabeza. <br>  <br>  Espero que te hayan gustado. Hasta la próxima.|`|88arMUpuaa	estaba pepito en la escuela y saca su cosita y dice lindo pescadito vamos jugar........entonces lo ven los demás ni?os y lo acusan con la maestra  que le dice a pepito ma?ana si no traes a tu papa no entraras a la escuela...........llega pepito con su papa al otro día y el papa le pregunta ala maestra que paso con mi hijo srita.que su hijo anda de grocero sacándose su cosita delante de los demás boys eso no es nada teaccher y se saca su cosoto y dice tiburón, tiburón  ...........|`|IWXg6Tiyaa	jjaja <br>  saludos|`|JntswnP3aa	jaja pues la verdad a mi si me gustan los chistes machistas porke si unos si estan chidos, y tambien los chistes feministas...en lugar de que todas las mujeres nos enojaramos deberiamos reirnos, que al fin y al cabo para eso son no?? como uno que dice "porke las muejeres se parecen a una manzana?

Bueno un factor puede ser el peso del puente pero no creo por que tendria que estar  incluido en los 120 kl del cartel. el otro que el puente este roto...XD o q analizo todo 13 dias (mala suerte). tambien puede haber fallado la brujula y se equivoco se puente ^^ o cuando desis q hacia mucho calor puede haber algo relacionado ahi.|`|FfN2ukrPaa	La respuesta más logica es :<br>  <br>  La balanza que uso estaba rota... por eso no marco el peso real de Anastasio y sus bártulos; convengamos en que es raro que un hombre adulto, una mochila cargada con tutti (a la "anastasio"), botas pesadas y hasta el sudor de la frente, pesen nada más que 82 kg...<br>  <br>  Q te parecio?<br>  <br>  Y a los que te respondieron que cruzaron mas personas, de donde lo sacaron? cuando dice "anastasio y su organizacion" no se refiere a un grupo de gente sino a la forma de ser de anastacio, q.e.p.d. ...<br>  <br>  saluditos!!|`|cab8a1be1ab1e87a00d80b564218e9ddaa	Creo que es porque cuando afirmas que Anastasio y su gente cayeron fue porque cruzaron más de 2 personas a la vez. Y ahí está el error. Anastasio pesaba menos que la capacidad del puente, pero como lo atravezó con su comitiva, este no resistió y todos cayeron al vacío.

TSJ7SLhAaa	para mi no es ninguna de las que han dicho, la respuesta es la sgte.<br>    Para mi cada uno veia 6 ciudades, y habia una que solo la podia ver uno a la vez porque 1) el sol estaba de un lado y luego del otro, por lo tanto uno veia cuando el sol estaba y el otro no podia.   O 2)una de la ciudades no era visible por ninguno, por que era en la que ellos estaban. ejempplo:  <br>      <-----IOI------>.   el tramo entre los dos I   I es la ciudad.<br>  <br>  <br>  no estoy seguro, pero esto es lo que pienso, son cosas que me parecen que ayudan en la respuesta:<br>    - el sol sale por el este y se esconde por el oeste, eso hace que cuando uno tenga luz el otro no.<br>    - que no se pueda ver una ciudad por los dos al mismo tiempo, quiere decir que estaban mirando para lados opuestos y sin poder verse.

En el tercer golpe, el marido le dice a la mujer:<br>  -Querida, ten cuidado al pegarle a la pelota, no sea que la mandes a una de esas preciosas casas y rompas un vidrio. Va a costar una fortuna repararlo.<br>  No alcanzó a terminar la frase cuando ella da un golpe y la pelota va directamente a una ventana de la mejor casa. El marido se vuelve loco.<br>  -Te dije que tuvieras cuidado, -?Y ahora que hacemos? Más tranquilo dice: -Vamos a pedir disculpas y a ver cuánto nos va a costar el arreglo.<br>  Van hasta la casa, golpean, y desde adentro una voz responde:<br>  -Pueden entrar.<br>  Abren la puerta y ven todo el vidrio disperso por el piso, una botella rota cerca de la mesa y a un hombre sentado en un sillón que les dice:<br>  -?Ustedes son los que rompieron la ventana?<br>  -Sí -responde el marido con timidez- y lo sentimos mucho. Queremos pagar el da?o...<br>  -De ninguna manera -contesta el otro- soy yo el que debe agradecerles. Soy un genio que estuvo preso en esa botella durante miles de a?os. Ustedes me liberaron. Por eso puedo conceder tres deseos: les doy uno a cada uno y me guardo el tercero para mi.<br>  -?Que bien!! -dice el marido- Yo quiero un millón de dólares por a?o, durante el resto de mi vida.<br>  -No hay problema. Es lo menos que puedo hacer por mi salvador.<br>  -Yo quiero una casa en cada país del mundo, -agrega ella.<br>  -Tu deseo está realizado, responde el genio.<br>  -?Y cual es tu deseo, Genio? -pregunta intrigado el marido.<br>  -Bien -responde, desde que quedé preso en esa botella, hace miles de a?os, no tengo la oportunidad de tener sexo. Mi deseo es tener sexo con tu mujer.<br>  El marido mira a su mujer y le dice: -Bueno, querida, nos ganamos un montón de dinero y todas esas casas. Creo que no está pidiendo mucho, a lo que la mujer asiente entusiasmada.<br>  El Genio lleva a la mujer a un cuarto y pasa alrededor de dos horas con ella. Al finalizar, mientras se visten, el genio la mira y le pregunta:<br>  -Dime, tengo una duda: ?Cuántos a?os tiene tu marido?<br>  -Treinta y cinco, -responde ella.<br>  -?Y semejante pedazo de jil todavía cree en Genios?|`|K66TFJ5jaa	como se llama la que come chicle siempre<br>  -mas   cadora<br>  <br>  y la que tiene cayos en los pies<br>  ca  yosa<br>  <br>  un doctor le dice al paciente :<br>  hace mucho que espera<br>  y el paciente contesta :<br>  no doctor ayer... era manzana<br>  <br>  doctor ,doctor: <br>  antes de ayer sufri de imsomnio...<br>  ayer sufri de escalosfrios ...<br>  _y hoy _pregunta el doctor<br>  hoy... me siento mejor que nunca!!!|`|Pl2IpjJcaa	jajajaja muy wuenos y sanos..

9ryMdyW5aa	pues debido a tu pregunta tuve que ponerme a investigar porque esto de las estrellas como que no se me da... y de acuerdo a mi rapida investigacion.. llegue al punto en el que no se si reir o llorar.. he aqui mi descripcion (casi casi):<br>  <br>  Fuego:<br>  <br>  El hombre de fuego es el portador de la bandera de un ideal, y generalmente encuentra quienes lo secunden para hacerlo realidad. Una vez lograda esa meta, de inmediato la reemplaza por otro objetivo, en un infatigable proceso de autoafirmación de la propia voluntad, en el que son secundarios los logros obtenidos. Este hombre no tiene tiempo para mirar hacia atrás, es insaciable en todo el sentido de la palabra, con el impulso siempre dispuesto a lo que viene después. Esta es una de las razones por la que no es depresivo, porque nunca se detiene a lamentar el pasado.<br>  <br>  Agreguemos que carece de consideración hacia los demás, quienes tienen que soportar sus exigencias y sus impulsos arrolladores que arrasan con todo lo que está por delante. Es muy poco diplomático y no desperdicia su tiempo en dar explicaciones ni excusas. No se detiene en los aspectos lógicos o formales de las cosas, ni se entrega a inquietudes psicológicas prolongadas. 0 llega instantáneamente a la médula del asunto, o pierde el interés. Nada crónico ni restringido le atrae, sino lo nuevo, lo no inspeccionado, lo no descubierto, lo ilimitado. El máximo ideal del hombre de fuego es la conquista de su propia libertad de acuerdo a sus propios valores, y la mayor catástrofe que pudiera ocurrirle es el derrumbe de sus ideales. Su prototipos son el predicador, el héroe, el profeta, de uno en uno, y aún los tres a la vez.<br>  <br>  Entre las virtudes del hombre de fuego están la inspiración, la perspicacia, la productividad, la eficiencia -"Ia mayor eficiencia con el menor esfuerzo y en el menor tiempo posible", es su lema - el valor, rayano en la temeridad, la espontaneidad, la independencia, la automotivación con lealtad a su ideal, la honestidad, la calidez, la vitalidad, la carencia de prejuicios. Sus aspectos negativos provienen de sus mismas virtudes: agresivo, insensible a las necesidades de los demás, exigente, egocéntrico, impaciente, fantasioso, arrogante, impertinente, extravagante, impositivo, tirano, cruel.<br>  <br>  Te doy una estrellita porque NUNCA me habia despertado curiosidad esto.. y porque estuvo entretenido.|`|AA10782322	Como geminiana soy el aire.|`|T4yoKswTaa	no se cual es mi elemento segun mi signo pero creo q soy agua.<br>  te digo pq le tengo terror al mar, nunca he estado en un crucero ni lo estare, ni en jetski o kayak nada, pero amo la playa, soy muy playera no dejo de ir a la playa, es algo  q me relaja y simplemente no puedo evitar ir, por eso me considero con ese elemento AGUA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|naUxp9SWaa	agua... lo que mas me marca de este signo es la perseverancia y la capacidad de entender los sentimientos del los demas....<br>  <br>  ...|`|muW8m6n3aa	agua|`|f7c2a37f831b107bb3639831c7ac8c26aa	Agua, según mi signo zodiacal.|`|98ecb3e765d8e773672dae42e0b1e78caa	Hola!!!<br>  Soy aire, porque acuario es signo de aire, y te digo que soy tan voladora, que creo, que la astrología conmigo no se ha equivocado.

liIqiHJbaa	Asi de simple te digo que hay que comprender un poquito a Akira y que los japoneses siempre la riegan en ocasiones como cualquier humano no? tambien tiene su derecho.<br>  1.- simplemente será por que le gusta ser alguien poderoso, pero si hablamos de inyecciones, es otra cosa, a veces la fobia ataca, algunas personas les temen a las palabras largas (hipopotomonstrosesquipedaliofobia).<br>  2.- las personas tenemos el límite de llegar a los 120 a?os, yo creo que tenia entre 70 u 80, todavía le quedaba vida, no? ademas, viejo pero todavia tenia su condición.<br>  3.- Un rapidín tal vez, además, eso no lo sacan en este tipo de historias. <br>  4.- Hay partes que les quitan, tal vez por ser el primer sayayin en la tierra se la dejaron, pero los siguientes ya no les gusto la idea de parecer "anormales" o solo los mismos padres, no creo que a Bulma le llame la atención tener un hijo con cola y menos sabiendo lo que provoca esta, mejor prevenir que lamentar.<br>  5.- En el mundo de Dragon Ball existe lo "anormal": lobo-hombres, con un ojo, muertos en la tierra, muchos brazos, revivir muchas veces, y un hombre que tenga tres ojos no se ve TAN mal.<br>  6.- De por si era humana, fue el doc. Gero el que la cambió junto con su hermano, merecia otra oportunidad, no?, Trunks asegura que estos son mas buenos que los de su realidad y tiempo, además fue amor a primera vista entre 18 y Krillin, y ella sería la única que soportaria peleas de su marido, por que Maron no creo que lo hiciera, me agradó mas 18, la verdad, de que se volviera buena o al menos pacífica, pues ya no le vió lo bueno de estar matando.|`|73qdacgDaa	1.MMM..no sé goku es raro...jajajajajajajaja xke como es todo ni?o por eso le dan miedo<br>  2.lo mismo me he preguntado yo...si ya tiene como...unos sus 120 a?os en el GT...XD XD<br>  3.cuando estaban entrenando (goku y gohan) para el torneo de cell ke siempre andaban convertidos en SS fue en una noche de esas seguro<br>  4.ni idea<br>  5.mmm...xke el jefe de la polica es como un perro antopomorfago o algo asi se dice (que es como humano), no sé habian personajes bien raros en dragon ball jajajaja<br>  6.xke le dio lástima krillin cuando la revivió, lo único que hizo en la serie fue hacerse millonaria con todo el pisto que le dio MR. Satan en los torneos de artes marciales|`|CxL8X0qgaa	1.-  Goku siempre fue de corazon noble, recuerda que hasta de grande se sigue subiendo a la nube voladora. Y toriyama trata de dar a entender con las inyecciones que para ser de corazon noble hay que ser como un ni?o (sin maldad en el corazon) Y a los ni?os les da miedo las inyecciones.<br>  2.- El maestro sigue viviendo porque es el Dios de las artes Marciales de ahi su nombre que se le da como el de otros dioses; Kame Senin. Como Kamisama, Kaio sama etc. Ademas Roshi es traduccion al espa?ol.<br>  3.- Fue antes de la pelea de Cell, es cuando Goku baja con Gohan a entrenar para la pelea de Cell.<br>  4.- Para no hacer mas tediosa la serie. Recuerdas que como a Goku le salia cada problema con su cola, e incluso a Gohan le salio, pero despues se la quitan como a Goku(aunque no se ve en la serie, pero se deduce). Ademas se piensa que los demas como Goten, Trunks, Pant y Bra no tienen cola porque ya son mas poderosos, Recuerdas como les costo a Goku y a Gohan convertirse en un Supersaiyan y Goten y Trunks lo hacian desde ni?os.<br>  5.- Porque era para darle mas variedad a la serie y a los enemigos de Goku. (Cuando este era su enemigo al principio) El podia ver lo que otros no podian, cuando goku hacia los movimientos rapidos. Luego su maximo poder se basa en el triangulo que hacen sus ojos. Y esto en la serie hacia que goku se superara mas para poder vencer a su rival.<br>  6.- La verdad estoy de acuerdo contigo, no aporto nada a la serie, solo que es la esposa de Kuririn. Y pues yo creo que estaba mas buena Marioon, la ex de Kuririn. O no????|`|aSiFqRnTaa	o nop me habia dado kuenta de tantos enigmas <br>  0.o|`|xhCXyzOqaa	ajajaja estoy apurado|`|pOSaC1UMaa	1) por si sentia la picadura ademas de que no sabia que hacian<br>  2) el toco al ave inmortal que daba el don de la inmortalidad (se la queria dar a goku pero el ave inmortal murio) <br>  3) tuvo 10 dias de ocio antes del torneo de cell<br>  4) quien sabe a la mejor  se las quitaron desdde un principio para que no hubiera problemas<br>  5)  era hijo de humano y extraterrestre<br>  6) se volvio buena porque krillin la salvo<br>  7) la hicieron para romperle el brazo a vegeta para matar a gohan para que cell se perfeccionara para que krilin tuviera parte en la serie para ayudar a matar a super 17 y estafar a satan para ganar el torneo ademas de que tiene protagonismo en 2 peliculasy otras cosillas mas<br>  8) y pues las razones ya pues este krilin quizo hacerla humana y le mostro que es una persona y que alguien siente amor por ella (cursi lo se : )<br>  <br>  bueno men esas son mis respuestas : )<br>  <br>  a lo que dices de la cla goku le hizo sabe que cosa este kamisama para que ya no le creciera y vegeta ya no le pudieron salvar la cola pues habia sido horrendamente golpeado tal vez lo mismo paso con gohan pues cuando pelearon con vegeta el quedo mal : )|`|9HDPV03vaa	1.-Goku le podian dar miedo las agujas por su mentalidad de ni?o.<br>  2.-Por que es muy fuerte<br>  3.-En algun dia de cuando entrenaban para pelear con los androides<br>  4.-por que a Akira se le olvido ponerles cola cuando hizo a los personajes y Pan no se hace super saiyajin porque no supo como se veria una mujer transformada<br>  5.-Por la misma razon que hay hombres invisibles y vampiros<br>  6.-La hicieron buena porque Krillin no tenia pareja y  empezo a entrenar artes marciales para conocer chicas (al final si le dio resultado, no se porque a Yamcha no)|`|DmI7SXAQaa	1. A Goku y su temor a las inyecciones lo entiendo, tengo amigos que le tienen pavor a las agujas y son cinturón ***** en taek won do, qué gracioso<br>  2. Y pues no sé en qué momento Milk tuvo a Gotten pero el degenerado de Goku no se ocupó de él, casi que crece sin padre, el pobre Goten<br>  3.

Creo que porque necesitaban pareja para Krilin, no? el pobre se iba a quedar soltero, jejeje|`|Vpdil4fyaa	holaa me encanta dragon ball jejee y si hay muchos misterios como en la mayoria de las series, sobre ciertos detalles en la vida de los personajes, pero existen casos en las que los escritores deciden ponerlos de manera indirecta para probarnos que tan fanaticos llegamos a ser, aunqe existen otros casos en los que no deciden ponerlos para crear mas intriga y crear otra continuidad a la historia dependiendo de la peticion del publico o porque no les parece conveniente que lo sepan o simplemente por que quieeren ser los unicos en saberlo XD.<br>  <br>  1.- Goku tenia fobia a las inyecciones, cuando uno  tiene fobia todo desaparece y solo hay temor, y es por eso que goku olvidaba la insignificancia que eran las vacunas en comparacion a las peleas, que por cierto el las disfrutaba como el mismo lo confima varias veces, ademas de que se encuentra en su naturaleza sayayin ser luchador por experiencia ,lo de las vacunas pudo tambien haber sido inculcada por su abuelo gohan al que queria mucho pues no se explica mucho de sus vivencia con el, solo los detalles mas personales.<br>  <br>  2.-  su nombre original es Kame Sen'nin (con eso sabemos por que se llama KAME HAME HA ) y solo sus discipulos le decian maestro roshi aunqe prefirio que se le conociera asi siempre tiene una gran logevidad por que tiene un gran dominio en las artes marciales (lo que lo mantiene saludable) y ademas que tomo una extra?a agua que tomo a?os atras.<br>  <br>  3.- La primera vez que vi dragon ball ttambien se me quedo esa duda, pero cuando lo vi por segunda vez note que cuando goku se encuentra grave por el padecimiento del corazon es llevado a kame house y es atendido por Milk y cuando al fin se recupera milk es la primera que lo nota  y luego ellos se quedan mirando fijamente  y  en ese momento se encuentran solos, despues pasan a otra escena, ese fue el unico momento mas apropiado en el que seria mas logico que goten fuese consevido durante el anime, aunqe tambien pudo aver sido consevido durante el tiempo que paso antes de la pelea de cell en que festejan el cumplea?os de gohan.<br>  <br>  4.- por que la sangre se mescla y ya no es pura asi que varias caracteristicas se pierden, gohan, goten y trunks al ser medio sayayin tuvieron mas posivilidades de tener esa cola, aunqe solo se muestra la de gohan por que es la que tiene mas relevancia con la pelea con vegeta y ademas para que en su primera aparicion fuera obvio que era el hijo de goku. pan es solo un cuarto de sayayin asi que posiblemente la sangre ya estaba muy diluida, aunque pudo haver abido otras razones, por que no se muestran muchas mujeres de la raza sayayin y tal ves ellas nunca pudieron tenerla o convertirse en super sayayin.<br>  <br>  5.- por que es de desendencia extraterrestre.<br>  <br>  6.-  solo era su programacion , por eso era mala, ademas los androides tenian diferentes personalidades a las del futuro alterno siendo solo mas arrogante y un poco mas humana a diferencia de 17 que solo queria matar. ademas como su personalidad era un tanto mas arrogante y fria  no le gustaba demostrar sus sentimientos como los que sentia por krilin. sus razones para ser buena fue krilin pues influyo mucho en ella ademas de que tuvo una hija con el y sentia que con eso ya se habia redimido de sus malos actos que habia echo en el pasado.  pero en lo que aporto en la saga fue ayudo a eliminar a la rencarnacion de numero 17 por que habia matado a krilin.|`|clafm4PTaa	?Por que si goku aguantaba cualquier golpe de su enemigo le temia a las inyecciones?<br>  A quien no??<br>  <br>  ?Por sigue viviendo el maestro roshi?<br>  Tomo un elixir de la vida junto a su hermana Uranai Baba, eso lo explico en Dragon Ball ya que tenia como 300 a?os al inicio de la serie<br>  <br>  ?En que momento goku y milk hicieron a goten? si goku estuvo muy ocupado en las peleas de ese momento y apenas se le ve con milk, ademas se muere y no hay un <br>  momento en el que pudieran hacerlo<br>  Por que Goku iba a lo que iba a su casa, a darle cari?o a su esposa, o ke querian que hiciera a la mitad de un bosque?? <br>  <br>  ?Por que de los sayayins que nacieron en la tierra solo gohan tuvo cola?<br>  Era como la circuncicion para ellos, se las quitaban al nacer y cada rato se tenian que andar razurando<br>  <br>  ?por que tenshin han tenia tres ojos?<br>  Uno estaba pintado por eso nunca lo movia, era solo decorativo pero el decia que era para detectar movimientos que los otros dos ojos no veian<br>  <br>  ?por que el androide 18 se volvio buena? si no aporto nada <br>  a la serie como buena, mejor se hubiera muerto ?con que sentido lo hicieron? ?cuales fueron sus razones para volverse buena?<br>  Buscarle una novia a Krilin, ya se veia muy raro sin novia no?? No querian que tuviera la misma fama que Robin|`|k8ZQLMTyaa	Hola buena tu pregunta<br>  <br>  1. es para denotar que goku en el fondo es en parte Humano y por ende tiene miedos un poco absurdos ademas es para darle humor a la serie<br>  <br>  2. Por que tomo un elixir de la vida eterna (espera  y luego confirmo datos ??)<br>  <br>  3.  no sabria decirte pero creo que fue en una visita mas alla de la tumba muaahahahaha<br>  <br>  4. Ellos no tienen cola debido a la genetica, asi mismo lo explica Toriyama.<br>  Es por eso k, tanto Pan como Goten y Trunks, nunca se les vio con cola. De hecho, en la serie, Kirllyn le pregunta a Bulma si Trunks tubo cola al nacer y ella nunca le responde<br>  <br>  5. Por que es descendiente de la raza de alienigenas de tres ojos <br>  <br>  6. No es que se haya vuelto buena solo que se caso con Krilin y dejo de hacer tanta malda en parte influenciada por el chip que los tenia programados para eliminar a Goku (recuerda que en un torneo e artes marciales accede por una fuerte suma de dinero que no me acuerdo cuanto fue, con tal de dejarse derrotar por Mr. Satan?), podria decirse que no era mala solo que estaba programada a derrotar a Goku y por eso se veia en un papel para nada amigable<br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------... edit<br>  <br>  hola pues segun no esto y mal corre un rumor que dice qeu ellos cuando bebes les quitaron la cola para evitar problemas, pues si te fija a Gohan se la quitaron y nu le volvio a nacer<br>  <br>  si es raro eso y pues ante eso nu te podria responder jejeje sayo ahora si ^_^

Este comportamiento se debía a que en el pasado, su padre (Sakumo Hatake), conocido como "el Colmillo Blanco de Konoha", fue deshonrado al abandonar una misión para salvar a sus compa?eros, lo cual estaba fuera de las reglas de los ninjas. Una vez salvados sus compa?eros, la misión fracasó y sus 'amigos', a los que había salvado, le dieron la espalda. El padre de Kakashi, después de una gran depresión y de la perdida de la consideración de la aldea, se suicidó a causa de la humillación recibida. La única manera que tenían los ninjas y los samurais de lavar el honor perdido era mediante el suicidio. El poder del padre de Kakashi era legendario, comparable con el de los Sannin (Los tres: Orochimaru, Jiraiya y Tsunade). <br>  Cuando Kakashi se convierte en Jounin, su compa?era Rin y su maestro Yondaime le hacen obsequios (un equipo médico y un Kunai especial, respectivamente), pero su compa?ero Obito no le da nada en ese momento porque se le olvidó. <br>  Recién convertido en Jounin, su maestro Yondaime le encarga su primera misión como líder junto a Rin y Obito, en la cual su compa?era Rin es raptada por el enemigo para obtener información. <br>  La humanidad de su compa?ero Obito convence a Kakashi de que es más importante salvar a su compa?era Rin que completar la misión, ya que en un principio el plan de Kakashi continuar con la misión y salvar a su compa?era más tarde. <br>  Cuando van a rescatar a Rin se origina un combate en el cual Kakashi pierde su ojo izquierdo al proteger a su compa?ero Obito. Obito, sintiéndose importante para sus compa?eros, despierta su Sharingan, que muestra por primera vez. El primer escollo es salvado por Obito y Kakashi, pero más tarde, una gran piedra que iba a aplastar a Kakashi cae encima de Obito, que se pone en lugar de Kakashi para recibir el da?o (específicamente le aplasta la parte derecha del cuerpo). Antes de morir le pide a Rin (ninja médico) que le dé a Kakashi un regalo que cambiaría su vida para siempre: Su Sharingan. <br>  Kakashi, que maduró como ser humano y como ninja, lleva consigo, aparte del Sharingan, muchos toques de la personalidad de Obito, como llegar siempre tarde y dar una excusa totalmente irracional. Tiene un sentido del humor único y espontáneo y no puede faltar en sus manos su libro favorito, "ven ven paraíso" (lit).(Traducido como "El Paraíso Erótico"). <br>  Kakashi nunca había aprobado a un grupo como maestro, hasta que se topa con el de Naruto, Sasuke y Sakura, quienes demostraron poseer lo que él reconoce como un buen equipo: un grupo unido capaz de poner a sus amigos antes de cualquier regla u objetivo. <br>  En su primera misión fuera de Konoha, que consistía en proteger a un ciudadano del País de la Ola, Kakashi y su equipo se enfrentan a dos grandes enemigos con los cuales no contaban: Zabuza (ninja de rango S) y Haku (que posee línea sucesoria). Es con Zabuza con el que Kakashi muestra su Sharingan y su técnica original, Lighting Edge (Filo Relámpago) o Chidori (Millar de pájaros, llamado así debido a que cuando se utiliza esta técnica se oye un sonido similar al piar de miles de pajaros). También es conocida como Raikiri, que es el apodo que tomó Kakashi al cortar un relámpago con esta técnica. Kakashi se la ense?ó a Sasuke antes del combate contra Gaara. <br>  Las cualidades y el potencial que su equipo demostró durante la batalla contra Zabuza y Haku, su unidad como grupo y fortaleza contra el enemigo, es lo que hace que Kakashi tome la decisión de escogerlos para realizar el examen de Chunin en su primer a?o como Genin (ninjas de más bajo nivel). <br>  Durante la supervivencia en el bosque (primera prueba práctica) del examen de Chunin, Sasuke es marcado con el sello maldito de Orochimaru. Tras la pelea de Sasuke en los combates preliminares, Kakashi le realiza una técnica de sellado, pero le advierte que ésta no tendría efecto si él permite que el sello se apodere de él (Sasuke debe controlar su ansia de poder). <br>  Tras la muerte del 3er Hokage, la rivalidad entre Naruto y Sasuke se ha incrementado hasta tal punto que Kakashi se ve obligado a intervenir en una pelea entre estos dos cuando estaban utilizando técnicas de alto nivel y alto rango de da?o. <br>  Tras esto, Kakashi recibe uno de los golpes más duros, la separación de su grupo con la partida de Sasuke, a quien anteriormente explicó lo que significaba perder a sus amigos por una venganza que podría cambiar su vida para siempre. <br>  Tan pronto se entera de la salida de Sasuke de Konoha, Kakashi sale en busca de él y Naruto, a quien Tsunade ya había enviado en una misión de rescate liderada por Shikamaru. Pero esta vez llegaría tarde, ya que se encuentra a Naruto inconsciente tras haber luchado con Sasuke, y no ve rastros de este último. <br>  Dos a?os y medio después, Kakashi participa en una misión para rescatar al Kazekage de la arena (Gaara), en la cual muestra por primera vez la evolución de su Sharingan a Mangekyou Sharingan (lo cual ocurre cuando matas a tu mejor amigo, pero Kakashi lo ha conseguido de otra manera hasta ahora desconocida). Lo que está claro es que influyó el enfrentamiento contra Uchiha Itachi, que utilizó el Mangekyou Sharingan contra Kakashi. <br>  Kakashi utiliza el Mangekyou Sharingan para enfrentarse a un miembro de Akatsuki: Deidara, después del enfrentamiento, Deidara pierde un brazo y Kakashi manda una gigantesca explosión a otra dimensión. Tras el gasto de Chakra que hace, se ve incapaz de poder moverse por sí mismo y es sustituido como líder de su equipo por un miembro de ANBU capaz de utilizar el poder del primer Hokage (crecimiento de madera) además de controlar el poder creciente del Kyubi en Naruto. <br>  En estos dos a?os y medio, podemos ver a un Kakashi más poderoso, ya que tiene el Mangekyou Sharingan y para ello ha mejorado su nivel de Chakra y resistencia. Además en la primera temporada no podía utilizar su Sharingan más de pocos minutos porque caía inconsciente, ahora es capaz de usarlo durante más de 24 horas evidenciando sólo cansancio. <br>  Se dice que el Chakra de Kakashi es blanco como su pelo, cosa que es diferente al Chakra normal el cual es azúl. Domina técnicas de casi todos los elementos: Katon (Fuego), Raiton (Rayo), Suiton (Agua) y Doton (Tierra). Solamente no le hemos visto utilizar el Fuuton (Viento). Su dominio en las técnicas ninja es altísimo, estas son: Taijutsu (artes marciales, cuerpo a cuerpo), Ninjutsu (tipo conjuros o técnicas de ataque y defensa) y Genjutsu (control mental, ilusiones). Sus cualidades como velocidad, destreza, inteligencia, habilidad con los sellos son sobresalientes y su resistencia, constitución y nivel de Chakra son medios. <br>  Combate contra el miembro de akatsuki, Kakuzu, junto a Ino y Chouji, y con la ayuda de Shikamaru consiguen eliminar dos de sus cinco corazones, aun así casi pierden la vida contra este, pero justo en ese momento llegaron Naruto, Yamato, Sai y Sakura para ayudarles. <br>  Kakashi oculta habitualmente su rostro, aunque algunas personas como Ichiraku y su hija le han visto la cara descubierta por completo (obviamente cuando come). <br>  <br>  Logros [editar]Se convierte en Genin a los 5 a?os. <br>  Se convierte en Chūnin a los 6 a?os. <br>  Se convierte en Jōnin a los 12 a?os. <br>  Se convierte Capitan de los ANBU alos 13 a?os <br>  Su técnica original, el Chidori, la desarrolla con 12 ó 13 a?os. <br>  Más de 1.000 técnicas copiadas. <br>  Invocaciones, sellados, contrasellados, etc. <br>  Copiar el Rasengan a su maestro Yondaime. <br>  Perteneció a los ANBU, del cual fue capitán (Taicho). <br>  La evolución de su Sharingan a Mangenkyo (Calidoscopio), vemos que la forma del ojo es diferente a la de Uchiha Itachi y por tanto, las técnicas que puede utilizar, también. <br>  <br>  Técnicas Sobresalientes [editar]Kuchiyose no jutsu - Invocación de perros - Técnica que utiliza Kakashi para invocar sus perros ninja para misiones de búsqueda, para inmovilizar a sus enemigos.<br>  <br>  Sharingan - Técnica sucesoria de los Uchiha capaz de copiar las técnicas enemigas, predecir el movimiento y actuar en consecuencia.<br>  <br>  Chidori (Millar de pájaros)/ - Es la única técnica original y propia de Kakashi, es un arma letal que consiste en una gran cantidad de chakra en su mano capaz de atravesar al enemigo, emitiendo un sonido similar al chirrido de mil pajaros (de ahí su nombre). <br>  Esta técnica luego es evolucionada a Raikiri (Navaja Relámpago), que es mucho más poderosa.<br>  <br>  <br>  Rasengan - Técnica basada en la manipulación de forma del chakra, de ahí su color azul (como el chakra), Kakashi le copió la técnica a su maestro y creador de la misma, Yondaime.<br>  <br>  Mangekyō Sharingan - Técnica que desarrolla Kakashi (sin ser usuario de sangre del Sharingan), es una de las 3 evoluciones del Sharingan. Consiste en transportar a otra dimensión cualquier objeto que mire a través del Magenky? Sharingan , es un Ninjutsu poderoso pero requiere mucho chakra.<br>  <br>  Más de 1.000 técnicas - Kakashi es poseedor de más de 1.000 técnicas ninja copiadas con su Sharingan, lo que lo hacen poseedor del título de ninja que copia. <br>  <br>  bueno eso es todo lo que se bye|`|iIkIYhDGaa	no estoy muy seguro sobre quien se lo dio pero a lo que leei se lo dio su amigo obito que era del clan oshija obito fue uno de los genin que entreno el cuarto hokage junto con kakashi y la hermana de kiba bueno esto es lo que leei no se si sea verda|`|AA11586229	Sábe tu.|`|ofDeaFExaa	pues mira lo vez en Kakashi Gaiden y esta muy buena leelo por que te explica bien como lo obtuvo saludos n_n

48087ef15d07e9faccdbe775fb68d5b8aa	è tra i miei film preferiti<br>  il migliore di Besson sicuramente<br>  credo di averlo visto un centinaio di volte, adoro il "cattivo" Léon, l'interpretazione di Reno è magistrale, per non parlare di Gary Oldman uno dei cattivi più riusciti nella storia del cinema...<br>  e la piccola Matilda/Portman ha fatto strada, un grande talento alla sua prima esperienza<br>  <br>  la storia è di una tenerezza disarmante, mi emoziona sempre, devo dire che dentro di me ogni volta spero che Léon non faccia lo scherzetto dell'anello e tutte le volte ci rimango male<br>  sono scema lo so....|`|42M02O82aa	Jean Reno é tra i miei attori preferiti di conseguenza anche i suoi film.|`|GOXPNXtKaa	si figo mi è piaciuto tanto! brava la piccola portman!|`|Kn7jl9dpaa	bello, specie perche' sono sempre stato fan dei film che esagerano su argomenti tabu', andandosi a scontrare con l'emotivita' dei piu' sensibili|`|xN4HDB45aa	Carino. Non uno dei migliori di Luc Besson, ma uno dei migliori di Jean Reno.<br>  <br>  Ps. Scusa il puntiglio, ma era un accento acuto: Léon.|`|xtJesuCFaa	Un grande capolavoro.|`|xw517C2Jaa	io!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!troppo bello, poi l'attore è troppo bravo.....è tra le mie collezioni di film.lo aqvrò riguardato mille volte!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|z4tvjuBHaa	Bella trama ottimi interpreti ,Reno super , ma un pò ambiguo il rapporto con l' adolescente ragazzina da parte di Leon  a momenti  mi dava fastidio.|`|3GcWbiBZaa	si e mi e piaciuto molto,e un film cazzuto!!!|`|mgoRitxlaa	Il film è estremamente ambiguo e sostanzialmente figlio, nella filmografia di Luc Besson, del grande successo di Nikita. Là Jean Reno faceva l'eliminatore, qui è il protagonista assoluto, ma ancora svolge una funzione simile, solo al servizio della mala invece che dei servizi segreti. La storia tra Matilda e Léon diventa una vera e propria vicenda di amore platonico, con lei più maliziosa di lui, la cui mente elementare stenta a capire i sentimenti della ragazzina, che a un certo punto gli confessa che si è innamorata di lui. Aiello sembra lì lì per reinventare il suo ruolo di Sal del film Fa' la cosa giusta, di Spike Lee.<br>  Le vicende sono raccontate con taglio di film noir, ma anche con stile iperrealistico e fumettistico. La colonna sonora, simile a quella di Nikita, le scene salienti al rallentatore, la partecipazione della città americana più amata dal cinema e l'ambiguità del rapporto tra Matilda e Léon che, a tutti gli effetti, è un amore pedofilo ma platonico, hanno contribuito ad assicurare a questo film un grande successo negli anni '90 e un'influenza notevole su molti altri venuti dopo.<br>  <br>  In un'intervista a Film and music del 2007, Natalie Portman, che ora ha 25 anni, ha rivelato che la sua partecipazione al film Léon le ha fatto ricevere richieste "sessualmente esplicite" da parte di pedofili e che queste brutte esperienze l'hanno condizionata molto nelle scelte successive; tanto che si è rifiutata più volte di girare scene di sesso come nel film La mia adorabile nemica con Susan Sarandon.<br>  resta comunque un gran bel film , anche se preferisco di gran lunga nikita , sempre di luc besson<br>  <br>  ciao|`|U3Fe60gKaa	Io l'ho visto e mi è molto piaciuto, un film ricco di significati e veramente fatto bene, Jean Reno è bravissimo, ho visto praticamente quasi tutti i suoi film e Besson non sbaglia mai un colpo!<br>  Io personalmente l'ho trovato un pò lento, ma del resto quasi tutti i film francesi hanno questa caratteristica.<br>  Comunque la storia mi è piaciuta, ma a tratti forse mi è sembrato un pò banale, banale nel senso che una storia di "amore" che parla di sentimenti tra un sicario di mezza età e una ragazzina di 12 anni è una storia originale ma un pò eccessiva. <br>  Ma per il resto lo si può quasi definire un vero e propio capolavoro.|`|Q4Ze0Bojaa	Bellissimo, lo vorrei rivedere sono anni ormai..|`|d568fa98401b119079065eb9e507ecbbaa	ti rispondo in ordine:<br>  io<br>  si<br>  un capolavoro<br>  :-))|`|eTd1OC13aa	io!!! e devo dire che mi è piaciuto tantissimo, e il modo in cui una giornata che inzia normalmente può cambiarti radicalmente la vita...|`|gdVDRAykaa	io...bello ma sicuramente nn eccezzionale...

r4eB6sdsaa	DTS is a digital sound system for theatres. It has six tracks and is designed to produce the best sound reproduction possible in a movie theatre. The six discrete tracks used in the DTS format are Left, Center and Right which are the stage channels with their speakers behind the screen for precise positioning of dialogue, effects and music, separate Left and Right Surround channels to immerse the audience in the film and a Sub-woofer channel for enhancing the bass response and adding punch to the action. The DTS system is distinguished by the fact that it is the highest quality, most reliable and affordable theatrical digital sound system available in the world.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.real-image.com/dts/faq.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.real-image.com/dts/faq.asp</a>|`|43edafa6306bc99698cab55b472fc4a3aa	yes they have the Dolby DTS effect.It can be identified if u here any digital sounds or feel the bass sound

In the book Harry gets a sense of death while being near it, so all we know is that it's some kind of path to death, or just passing through it kills you.

A person would not go to an art gallery while sleepy, and doze off while looking at a Van Gogh or Dalli, Romare Bearden, etc.<br>  <br>  The same respect has to be given to Jazz. first I suggest you learn the difference of real jazz and elevator music. Its easy to be confused with the way the record companies and radio stations are calling jazz these days. example: you're in the store to buy potatoe chips and the labels says, Bar B Que "style" ; it does not mean they put the chips on the grill and smoked them. Artificial flavoring  was added to give the illusion of Bar B que. The same with "Smooth Jazz" versus"<br>  Main stream, or straight ahead" (swinging) as oppose to just a locked-groove.  You'll find your own way eventually..<br>  <br>  Here's some  CDs you can't sleep on,  Art Blakey Jazz messengers- Egyptian - blue note records, The Gigolo- Lee Morgan, Empyl Isles- Herbie Hancock<br>  Jack Johnson; Kinda Blue, On the Corner - Miles Davis<br>  Red Clay- Freddie Hubbard and  Boperation - Ray Vega<br>  <br>  I have my own jazz blog and website and love teaching novices about how to begin a collection , finding approachable music before you take on John Coltran OM or Chicago Art Ensemble, Sun Ra, etc. see:http//:hipstersanctuary.blogspot.com

Las películas muy raras veces igualan o superan al libro.|`|8c18e7cb2df190462529c82715791a62aa	Yo considero que el libro es mejor, porque te permite recrear en tu mente la historia con todos los detalles pensados por el autor, complementados con tu creatividad e imaginación. Todo esto es difícil que pueda plasmarse en una película, aunque ha habido algunas, como la de "Como agua para chocolate", logran transmitir la esencia del texto.<br>  Saludos!|`|gIexvnCFaa	Hola, todo depende de como sea el libro o la adaptacion cinematografica. Nos podemos encontrar con casos en los que el libro es muy bueno, pero sin embargo la adaptacion, que puede que sea muy esperada por aquellas personas que les ha gustado el libro sea muy mala. Pero puede haber otros casos en los que el libro te puede haber parecido muy malo,pero la adaptacion al cine es muy buena. <br>  Te puedo dar ejemplos de lo anteriormente mencionado (todo segun mi punto de vista, es una opinion totalmente subjetiva):<br>  El libro 1 de Harry Potter (Harry Potter y la piedra filosofal), me habia parecido de lo mas comun, sin embargo luego vi la adaptacion cinematografica y me parecio excelente.<br>  El libro del gran escritor Gabriel Garcia Marquez "Cronica de una muerte anunciada" me parecio espectacular, con una historia muy interesante, muy bien redactada por el escritor. Pero luego me encontre con que la adaptacion en el cine era muy mala comparada con la obra maestra que lo es el libro.<br>  Esta es mi opinion, espero que te guste y coincidas con ella. Saludos y suerte|`|zV8HIMcWaa	SIEMPRE me ha gustado más el libro.<br>  Pero lo cierto es que NUNCA vi primero una peli y después leí el libro.<br>  Las adaptaciones al cine se me quedan pobres en comparación.<br>  Excepto honrosas excepciones como "Los pájaros" que está basada en un relato corto. O la saga de El Se?or de los anillos, que las novelas me parecen un ladrillo.<br>  Salud camarada!.|`|1iyDP5WZaa	No se especifica de que libro?<br>  <br>  De cualquier manera prefiero el libro, cuenta detalles que en la película no se puede ense?ar bien, algunos libros con muchos pensamientos, no hay manera de demostrar eso en el cine.|`|287ddc386d7a8874794075fb9b4e98ebaa	Siempre es mejor el libro.<br>  Por muy buena que sea la adaptación al cine.<br>  Hay películas muy bien logradas, para mi gusto, Los Puentes de Madison y La casa de los Espíritus.<br>  Pero igualmente siempre disfruté mucho más del libro.<br>  Por ejemplo con Coma y Expreso de medianoche, el libro me hizo temblar, cosa que no me pasó con la película aunque me gustaron muchísimo las dos.<br>  También tiene mucho que ver si el autor de la novela supervisa la filmación, como ocurre en muchos casos, y ahí es donde generalmente se asemejan mucho la película y el libro.<br>  Es mi humilde opinión.<br>  Saludos.|`|6f9ad450234d3ee0402ebb66443167fbaa	El libro, es mucho más extenso, puedes utilizar la imaginación, y no esta editado|`|RggSdnvcaa	La pelicula, me da ladilla leer el libro|`|Ruc2pXL6aa	Primero el libro, porque es tu imaginación la que crea las imagenes a tu gusto y ganas. Y como es lógico es más completo que la película.<br>  <br>  Primero hacete la película vos, con formas y personajes a tu medida, luego ve como se lo imagina el otro y lo compacta en un par de horas a su forma.|`|Xi6HmHWMaa	para mi siempre son mejores los libros, porque bueno, es imposible poner en una pelicula todos los detalles que narran los libros, y suelen saltarse cosas importantes; a parte muchas veces tu te imaginas a los personajes de una manera y en la pelicula suelen poner a gente que no tiene nada que ver con el personaje que tu imaginaste, por lo que al final te desilusionas.|`|d2a463d72b510ae5bf2c6621e7b9a7a7aa	depende... puede que el libro sea una vasca, y la pelicula tenga a un super directorazo y unos buenos actores, o tambien que el libro sea el primero en la lista de los best-sellers y la producción se confie al hacer la película... si quieres una historia más detallada y llegar al fondo con los personajes lee los libros, si quieres comparar tu imaginación con la imaginación del director, divertirte un rato o simplemente ahorrarte horas de leer pues ve la pelicula.|`|ef3f03a89a8bd4978b7bc5e07d5a7bdbaa	El libro suele ser mejor en la inmensa mayoría de los casos. ?qué hacemos aquí si hablamos tan bien de los libros?|`|f9A7bPFfaa	Hola! Interesante pregunta.<br>  <br>  A mmi me gustan las dos cosas, <br>  <br>  me gusta primero leer el libro dejar volar mi imaginación y luego me gusta ver la película (mientras no me rompa el esquema)<br>  <br>  por que por ejemplo si dice que un chico/a era muy lindo/a me gustaría ver un buen actor para ese papel, o me gustaría ver el entorno en el que se lo hizo..<br>  <br>  Bueno Suerte!<br>  <br>  Chau!

bHR9h1N2aa	Notre société nous bombarde d'images, de sons, de livres cela va trop vite pour tout apprécier. Pour preuve cette foule d'artistes oubliés que je découvre sur une période d'une vingtaine d'année. Nous vivons une culture "Reader digest" et notre démarche est certainement une réaction contre cet état de fait. Le fait de ne pas "consommer" du CD comme tout le monde trahit notre malaise face aux modes éphémères et à la dictature des médias et certainement une difficulté à gérer le temps qui passe. alors ne jette pas garde une grande valeur avec le temps qui passe|`|2b5b70624897cbcf635f9389032b31f8aa	....ne jette pas....

Message : ?a ne s'abime pas, plus petit, plus facile d'usage.<br>  Ce qui n'a pas été transmis aux acheteurs : <br>  1) un vinyle ne s'use pas si la tête de lecture / et le diamant sont en bon état.<br>  2) Un vinyle contient environ 1000 fois plus d'infos qu'un CD. Sur le vinyle il y a une courbe harmonieuse qui reproduit le son. Sur le CD cette courbe est numérisée, et au lieu d'une courbe lisse, la courbe est en escaliers. Avec les meilleurs ordinateurs du monde il serait impossible de faire des CD si précis que ce que contient la courbe du vinyle.<br>  3) Les fanatiques de musique savent maintenant cela, et se ruent dans les brocantes sur les vinyles. Un vinyle d'une chanson / groupe connu vaut de l'or. Ces fanatiques du son parfait ont des chaines Hi-Fi entre 20'000€ et 1 mio d'€. Un fameux chef d'orchestre, du c?té de Vienne, je n'arrive pas à me souvenir de son nom, a construit sa luxueuse villa en fonction de la chaine HI-fi, des enceintes, etc. <br>  Il est évident qu'une personne qui a du matériel pour 100'000 € ne vas rechigner à payer un montant élevé pour un vinyl d'un groupe adoré. <br>  Ainsi les prix moment, montent.<br>  <br>  Donc ne jette surtout rien. D'ici que les ordinateurs puissent lire des "CD" avec tant d'informations que sur le vinyle, vont passer encore bien des années.<br>  Si tu veux t'en défaire : tu vas à paris, dans une foire ou brocante. Tu regardes les prix d'autres vendeurs, et tu vends soit à des marchands, soit t'installes ton petit stand pour vendre aux particuliers. <br>  Tu n'as même pas besoin de faire si compliqué : tu as vu que certains QRistes t'ont demblée dit qu'ils étaient intéressés. Pour ne pas vendre trop en-dessous du prix du marché, tu peux fouiner sur Internet, il y a s?rement des sites spécialisés, sinon e-bay. Et, si jamais, tu me contactes, je crois que tu sais que j'ai un ami totalement branché vinyl, qui a vécu a Paris, qui conna?t approximativement la valeur des vinyls.<br>  Cette nouvelle fièvre des vinyls n'est peut-être pas encore arrivée jusque dans ton pays. Cela ne va pas tarder. Les nouveaux riches veulent le top. S'ils ont les moyens de s'acheter des enceintes à 10 ou 50'000€ ils vont aussi payer ce qu'il faut pour les vynils.      <br>  <br>  En résumé : ne jettes rien du tout. Et si vends, informes-toi sur les prix "internationaux".|`|b0f3a479572b4cae2e9064feb328a223aa	Tu aimes plaisanter , alors jette le !!|`|JFn337Kcaa	Bien non, ca ce ne jette pas, il y a des collectionneurs qui les veulent, et cela ce vend une petite fortune aujourd'hui !!!!|`|63456df29ba368e1d3356ee5341ab589aa	?a se vend, il y a des amateurs|`|GarU2nPqaa	pour répondre à la question:<br>  par ailleur un vinyl ?a se garde ou sa se vend, sa ne se jette pas ...<br>  au pire donne les!<br>  <br>  certains peuvent valoir cher, mais crois moi ce sont des choses très spécifiques , le mieux c'est d'aller sur un site comme priceminister et faire une recherche sur tes disques voir à combien les vendeurs les proposent, ?a te donnera une bonne idée de la valeur même si ce site laisse la possibilité de faire de bonnes affaires<br>  <br>  <br>  Ok Jules C ne dit pas que des bêtises, mais ce discours pro-vinyles je suis pas tout à fait pour ...<br>  <br>  <br>  "1) un vinyle ne s'use pas si la tête de lecture / et le diamant sont en bon état."<br>  <br>  faux<br>  à moins d'avoir une cellule de très très bonne qualité et d'avoir regler le poids au minimum (ce qui veut dire que le disque saute bcp plus)<br>  mais un vinyle avec une platine normale sa s'use qd on l'écoute...même si c'est qu'un peu<br>  combien de disques j'entend ou les mecs ont reglé leur poids à fond et ou il y a un énorme bruit de fond alors que l'aspect du vinyl est très bon....<br>  pour du neuf c'est peut être valable pour de l'occaz faut pas rêver :)<br>  <br>  <br>  "2) Un vinyle contient environ 1000 fois plus d'infos qu'un CD. Sur le vinyle il y a une courbe harmonieuse qui reproduit le son. Sur le CD cette courbe est numérisée, et au lieu d'une courbe lisse, la courbe est en escaliers. Avec les meilleurs ordinateurs du monde il serait impossible de faire des CD si précis que ce que contient la courbe du vinyle."<br>  <br>  c'est vrai que l'analogique possède une information en continue, mais les spécificités du cd ont été callé sur les possibilités de l'oreille humaine, en clair, il faut vraiment être très fort pour distinguer le son entre les deux...<br>  alors sa fait peut être une petite différence mais honnetement, à part d'être un mélomane qui écoute du classique ?a change pas grand chose (pour le classique c'est un peu différent que pour les musiques "amplifiés")<br>  <br>  "3) Les fanatiques de musique savent maintenant cela, et se ruent dans les brocantes sur les vinyles. Un vinyle d'une chanson / groupe connu vaut de l'or. Ces fanatiques du son parfait ont des chaines Hi-Fi entre 20'000€ et 1 mio d'€.

Pero no se pude comparar. Lo que pasa es que sakura es un shojo y one piece un shonen, segun el genero que prefieras te gustara mas una serie u otra. Y one piece (en la version sin censura) me gusta mucho mas, ademas tiene mas capitulos, y aunque sakura es tambien un anime excelente, creo que no se le puede comparar a one piece. Solo lo supera en la calidad de los dibujos (en op al principio la calidad no es muy buena, pero va mejorando con la serie).<br>  Y aunque las dos series son buenas, yo las he visto las dos completas, y one piece me gusto muchisimo mas.|`|BV5SEe7Taa	Sakura|`|SkaA71jdaa	Sakura Card Captor obvio ?.?|`|an4Ii7gzaa	La verdad yo prefiero el anime de One piece Es bastante aceptable y tiene buenas graficas,buenos personajes y una mejor trama<br>  <br>  Pero CC sakura es bastante bueno tambien<br>  <br>  Asi que empate!|`|d1201dc530cb8fd6b369abb1ce1e550aaa	Infinitamente me gusta más Sakura Card Captor, es mi anime preferido *-*<br>  <br>  Los personajes de OP están medios raros, sin ofender|`|liIqiHJbaa	Sakurita!!!!!!<br>  el porque? es simple la respuesta, por el hecho de que esta es clásica en el anime (solo chequen, salión en 1996 y todavía siguen hablando los otakus y fans de este lindísimo anime), tal vez no tanto como dragon ball o sait seiya, pero uno de los principales del shojo, ???claro que si!!! aparte de sailor moon (aunque este no lo he visto completo), ??arriba el anime!!, y más a un las CLAMP, me encantan sus creaciones!!<br>  <br>  NOTA: pero no crean que insulto a One piece (que también me gusta) solo que con Sakura como contricante, no llega a su altura de la clásica.

V9UxKg4Faa	Pues cada uno tiene lo suyo, un manga lo puedes leer mientras esperas en la fila, en el camión o yo que se XD, un anime no!<br>  Por otro lado las historias que son más de acción y peleas se disfrutan mucho más en un anime, además tienen color.<br>  <br>  En lo personal me gusta más el manga, porque igual me gusta leer mucho (y para los que andan reclamando, no solo manga, sino muchos libros también). Pero ambos son muy buenos!<br>  <br>  Saludos!!|`|5eb6e7c3cedd4588c8e1a8347c378e4faa	la verdad que el anime el manga solo lo veo cuando se tardan en pasar series y descontinuan el anime pero siguen sacando el manga.<br>  mi favorito hellsing|`|69RRH0XPaa	el anime|`|J3VVlsbCaa	Pues la verdad me gustan ambos, pero si he de escoger uno pues...el manga, porque puedo leer en cualquier ratito libre o en el transporte público, mientras que el anime debo estar frente al televisor (y no siempre se puede)<br>  <br>  ??OTAKU FOREVER!!|`|ROnuZtrOaa	A mi me gusta mucho el anime y un poco el manga.<br>  El anime porque es como una obra de teatro plasman lo que esta en el manga original o modifican algunas cosas para su mejor desarrollo. Ademas de que el anime esta tomando bastante fuerza ahora en todo el mundo debido a su gran animacion y a sus increibles historias que a veces lo dejan a uno boquiabierto o a veces te hacen matar de la risa.<br>  <br>  El manga tambien pero un poco menos porque en verdad no me gusta leer mucho jejejejeje pero el manga es donde esta el contenido original osea la verdadera trama en la que se basan los animes, el manga es mas concreto en su historia pero a veces cuando lo llevan al anime lo distorcinan un poco el contenido original dejando a veces insatisfecho a los otakus.|`|RqkNIpiAaa	Yo los dos, cada uno tiene su atractivo, con el manga echas a volar tu imaginación y los personajes y situaciones adquieren más sentido y más vida y la animación al mostrárte las escenas dinámicas te atrapa y captas algunos detalles más. Además cuando la música es realmente buena te deja una percepción más profunda de las emociones y situaciones de los personajes.<br>   Por eso me gustan las dos.|`|liIqiHJbaa	las dos son muy buenas, pero digamos que por el movimiento, el color, la voz, etc. le da más sabor y vida al anime, así que prefiero las dos, pues el manga es la versión original, ya que al anime le hacen algunos cambios|`|n4oo7SJFaa	A mi ambos  lo que no hay en uno hay en otro|`|7H9Qg3Uuaa	el manga, viene mas especifico y mas completo aunque el anime nos ayuda un poco al momento de imaginar, pero milveces prefiero el manga :)|`|s1aEUWsRaa	Las dos cosas me encantan. Aunque el manga es el original, pero esta bueno leerlo y despues ver el anime<br>  <br>  Saludos|`|RBD5alyWaa	Prefiero Anime|`|bh2gb3v1aa	prefiero el anime|`|cEJFsqOKaa	A mi me gustan los 2 pero me gusta mas el anime...me entretiene mas.....ahunke de vez en cuando me leo uno k otro manga...|`|r6tdDQjDaa	Hola amiga!! Como estas?? Ojala q ben, a mi me gustan las dos cosas:<br>  El anime porque puedo conocer las voces de mis personajes favortios y verlos a color...<br>  Pero el manga tambien me gusta porque trae todooo y estan algunas partes q en la tele censuran..Ademas yo me compro mangas para los viajes largos..???Es genial!!!<br>  Salu2y estrella!<br>  BYE!|`|7fd1e50b341fbe4626a07216268a464baa	Anime para entretenerse un rato mientras se ve la tv.<br>  Y el manga cuando no estas frente a una pc o tv, y matas el tiempo leyendo el manga.|`|7y2CkKyOaa	pues  yo  prefiero  el  anime,no  mejor  prefiero  el  manga,no  mejor  el  anime,esta  dificil,los  2  son  en  diferentes  tipos  de  ocasiones  en  las  que  quieres  pasar  el  tiempo,el  anime,cuando  es  una  hora  en  la  que  no  quieres  hacer  nada  y  te  sientas  a  ver  TV,el  manga,cuando  quieres  ver  capitulos  que  todavia  no  estan  en  el  anime<br>  <br>  <br>  salu2  y  prosperidad  para  toda  la  CyA|`|BV5SEe7Taa	El anime|`|J7GLPnMsaa	pues me gustan los dos enel manga sale con mas detalles, acun el anime es mucho mejor .|`|PFDfOYPPaa	Me gusta más el anime pero también no dejo atrás el manga porque es algo más completo que el anime puesto que en el anime nunca sale toda la historia del manga.<br>  <br>  Bye! Bye!|`|T71a06N8aa	Los dos el manga tiene muchas cosas q no ponen en el anime y en el anime ves los personajes del manga moverse y como quien dice cobran vida, los dos a mi tambien me gusta mucho leer y pues me etretengo con eso.|`|WiS93DWKaa	Prefiero mil veces mas el anime!!!|`|bjPVmMCvaa	El manga, me parece mucho más artístico y sin importar donde estes, siempre puedes tenerlo a la mano.

En attendant la deuxième saison, je vais vous parler des acteurs.<br>  Je vais commencer par Mark, en effet il est le leader du groupe mais s'est aussi mon préféré. J'ai toujours aimé cet acteur que j'ai découvert dans Chicago Hope.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Mark Harmon est né le 2 Octobre 1951 à Burbank en californie. <br>  <br>  Dans la famille Harmon, seul le père est footballer (Tom Harmon). La mère (Elyse Knox), la soeur (Kris Harmon) et la nièce (Tracey Nelson) de Mark sont acteur et actrices.<br>  Même sa femme ( Pam Dawber) est actrice ce qui est logique.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Au début, il va sur les traces de son père puisqu'il joue dans l'équipe universitaire de Los Angeles mais ensuite revirement de situation il se tourne vers Hollywood.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Voici un petit palmarès de sa filmographie :<br>  <br>  1978 : Le souffle de la tempête (Comes a Horseman)<br>  1979 : Le dernier secret de Poseidon<br>  1985 : Des vacances de rêves (Prince of Bel Air)<br>  1986 : 6 hommes pour sauver Harry (Let's Get Harry)<br>  1987 : Prof d'enfer pour un été (Summer School)<br>  1988 : Présidio, base militaire, San Francisco (The Presidio)<br>  1988 : Le retour de Billy Wyatt (Billy Wiatt)<br>  1988 : Trois lits pour un célibataire (Worth Winning)<br>  1988 : La mémoire brisée (Stealing Home)<br>  1991 : L'ombre d'un doute (Shadow of a Doubt)<br>  1991 : Dillinger (Dillinger)<br>  1991 : Les années perdues (Long Road Home)<br>  1994 : Wyatt Earp (Wyatt Earp)<br>  1995 : Orky (Magic in the Water)<br>  1995 : L'ultime souper (The Last Supper)<br>  1998 : Las Vegas Parano (Fear & Loading in Las Vegas)<br>  2002 : Freaky friday dans la peau de ma mère<br>  2003 : Esprit libre<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  La même année il obtient le r?le de Leroy Jethro Gibbs en tant qu'agent spécial du N.C.I.S enquêtant sur un meurte dans les services du JAG. Deux épisodes de suite tourné dans cette série diffusée par France 2.<br>  Par la suite il reprendra le r?le dans NCIS enquête spéciale. Ancien sergent artilleur des Marines, il est très doué dans son domaine et même s'il ne suit pas le code de procédure, ces petits défauts de criminologue l'amène toujours à trouver le coupable et rendre un travail parfait.<br>  On sait que Jethro est fils unique, qu'il parle le chinois et qu'il a été marié 3 fois. Un détail ses ex étaient tous rousses et que l'une d'entre elle l'a attaquéavec un club de golf.|`|YKLzerpiaa	Je connais pas je regarde pas cette série|`|ZhH1bQ22aa	Toi même tu aimes quoi?

Es simplemente genial.<br>  Luego<br>  Kujaku Mai ( Mai Valentine) de YuGiOh! porque a pesar de aparentar ser una mujer autosuficiente es de lo más humana y sensible, depende mucho de sus amigos TT0TT.<br>  Kuchiki Rukia de Bleach, porque ella es lo mejor, tiene una luz propia que la hace brillar. Tuvo que soportar muchas cosas en su vida ;_;|`|30fa91ed0e946cd68560074ba15f4070aa	hola <br>  pues para es difícil por que me gustan varios pero voy a elegir a uno a ver: bueno elijo a tamahome por que un hombre muy lindo y valiente que siempre defenderá su amada miaka a costo de su vida.<br>  o sera sailor moon que es una de mis favoritas por que siempre piensa en sus amigas y no le importa lo que le pueda pasar a ella si sus amigas están en peligro. aquí les dejo mis personajes favoritos aunque tengo mas. adiós nos veremos pronto.|`|dsq4DmeIaa	hooo pues mi personaje favorito es shaoran de ccs y trc *-* es mi personaje favorito porque? bueno me encanta su forma de ser es serio, solitario, poco comunicativo xD tambien es amable con sus amigos aunque no lo admite es capaz de sacrificarse por la persona amada, es orgulloso xD como yo aparte que es lindo *-* y considerado, valiente jejejej para mi es perfecto xD adoro cuando se sonroja que es muy seguido por lo menos en sakura card captor jejejeje  <br>  <br>  shaoran es mi personaje favorito porque me identifico con el en su caracter ^^ no lo cambio por ningun otro personaje jejejeje 100% numero uno ^^ <br>  <br>  ja ne|`|6zqTBAZmaa	Konichiwa!!!

w4cICNMLaa	+2<br>  <br>  jaja no ; la verdad nose si yo estoy en los primeros o si de verdad aporto algo a la comunidad. Claro en esas maratones siempre voy a contestar algo gracioso ; pero en una pregunta seria si me pongo serio.<br>  Ademas eso va dependiendo de la pregunta; un ejemplo claro es cuando se debate del porque de tantas preguntas sobre naruto o series de igual repercusion. En cambio en unas maratones con las ''preguntas'' q hacen lo mas normal es divertirse y pasar un buen rato sin dar una guia completa de la respuesta. Admito q en las maratones pongo cualquier cosa ; pero porq la considero graciosa.<br>  No digo q mis respuestas sean lo maximo pero siempre en preguntas q si valen la pena eh tratado de ayudar como dar una pagina web q uso para q los demas usuarios la disfruten.<br>  O dar mi opinion en encuestas.<br>  O elegir mis mejores canciones o animes.<br>  Bueno eso solo es mi hunilde opinion t espero q no se me tome a mal ninguna de misrespuestas.<br>  Ademas q recien tengo 28 dias aqui no me maten!! jiji una bromita para alegrar el ambiente q esta bien caldeado.<br>  <br>  O por cierto esto no viene para nada al caso pero esta es mi respuetsa #999 jeje espero q no me critiqen por oner esto.|`|1affe4aa187ac057a34e4f2e0afcfa75aa	Creo q eso  a mi,en lo personal no me afecta demasiado,,,si tu opinas por ejemplo q este foro es para responder y ayudar en lo q podamos,,eso tambien se aplica para las preguntas,,no solo para las respuestas,,,o sea ,q si queremos q una seccion sirva para aprender y conocer cada dia mas,deberiamos ,por ejemplo realizar mas preguntas especificas ,y dejar d lado el tipico,,"quien gana entre X vs X.?",,,,,,o cosas asi,,o por ejemplo cuando hacemos preguntas solo por diversion o para saludar,,,(me incluyo,ya q tambien hago ese tipo d preguntas),,,o sea,,, al punto al q quiero llegar es a q ,si en verdad nos quejamos d las malas respuestas q no aportan nada,,,q tampoco nos duela cuando nos responden mal,porq usamos el foro para otras cosas q no sean el d "preguntar",,,si buscamos q haya ley pareja,nosotros tambien debemos fijarnos en nuestros errores....si los demas usuarios ven q hacemos preguntas(q en realidad ,d preguntas no tienen nada),es logico q despues den respuestas,q de respuestas tampoco tienen nada,,,creo q cuando ya has pasado suficiente tiempo en esta seccion y enYR en general,sabes como va la cosa,,,por eso lo digo,,,yo aun habiendo leido las normas d yahoo,a veces violo ciertas reglas( algunas sin voluntad d hacerlo),,,asiq hagamos un "Mea culpa" y nos daremos cuenta d q para poner el grito en el cielo,primero hay q dar el ejemplo,,y es verdad q muchas veces nosotros no damos un buen ejemplo d como se debe usar correctamente esta seccion,,,yo no tiro la primera piedra porq en varias ocaciones he estado en falta(y colaboro con aquellos q tambien lo estan),,,asiq solo me tomo las cosas d manera liviana,,,,,y si me responden d la forma q tu dices,pues nada mas doy mi calificacion y espero q alguien q de verdad tenga ganas d responder,me saque d mi duda,,no hay q dramatizar tanto,,,,pero aclaro q esta es solo una opinion muy personal mia,,,,y no me molesto ni por ese tipo d respuestas ni con algunas clases d preguntas q se salen d lo q es debido,,,,cuestion d aceptar q ese tipo d cosa siempre estan y van a seguir estando,,,,,,,<br>  claro q lo d +2 es algo realmente absurdo,,y eso si es una total falta d respeto,,,,,,nada mas,,,<br>  espero q sigan bien,,,y nos vemos,,,,,,,,,,|`|7y2CkKyOaa	pues  tienes  razon,hay  gente  que  solo  responde :<br>  <br>  estoy  de  acuerdo,claro  que  si,porsupuesto, <br>  <br>   y  que  por  pura  trampa  consiguen  los  10  puntos,eso  no  me  parece  justo,ademas  son  unos  flojos,seguro  que  solo  les  importan  los  2  puntos  y  que  estan  de  afan  por  responder  otra  y  llegar  a  ser  colaboradores  destacados,esos  tipos  no  estan  compartiendo  con  la  comunidad  de  yahoo  respuestas.<br>  <br>  salu2  y  prosperidad  para  toda  la  CyA|`|WiS93DWKaa	+2......................xP|`|an4Ii7gzaa	ES CIERTO LO QUE DICES AHY ALGUNOS QUE COLOCAN ES NO SE, O TIENES RAZON...<br>  <br>  TE FELICITO!<br>  Xd|`|cEJFsqOKaa	mmmm......Pues yo creo k lo unico k kieren es juntar puntos poniendo esas respuestas.....a mi tampoco meguta k solo contesten NO SE......pero en fin ni k hacerle...cada kien con su mundo.|`|f3DEXEkOaa	La verdad es que uno intenta responder lo mejor posible por lo menos esa es mi intencion ayudar a lo demas con mis respuestas <br>  <br>  <br>  Saludos y no te hagas mala sangre con eso|`|q0NGWtwpaa	Hola amigo, pues sí de que los hay, los hay, pero eso es algo sobre lo que no tenemos control u_u solo hay que concentrarse en las buenas respuestas, (si las hay)  y seguir ....<br>  Claro que me dan unas ganas enooormes de reportar gente... ?? que no me aguanto... <br>  En este mundo hay de todo, gente buena y honesta.. y smpameros,  no podemos hacer nada contra ellos más que reportarlos...... jajajajajaja<br>  Es un trabajo dificil, pero alguien debe hacerlo ?no?<br>  Arriba el animo mi amigo poliCyA!! (la "Y" fué a proposito eh)  Por un Yahoo Respuestas sin SPAMEROS!!!!!!<br>  <br>  La psicótica ha hablado!!|`|J3VVlsbCaa	Es cierto, lo más probable es que esas personas lo único que quieren es sumar puntos, lo cual no se vale porque, como tú bien dices, el propósito de este espacio es compartir opiniones y que podamos comprender mejor diversos temas.<br>  <br>  En mi caso, lo que hago es contestar las preguntas según lo que sé, y si de plano no tengo la más mínima idea, pues...no la contesto XD, pues si, si nada más voy a inventar, no tiene ningún caso molestarse ?no crees?<br>  <br>  ??OTAKU FOREVER!!|`|QSN9Oisgaa	es muy sierto la malloria de los que contestan ponen lo primero que se les ocurre, a beses ni siquiera ponen nada. esta claro que solo contestan por los puntos que ban aresibir, aunque no es mucho lo que sepuede aser para ebitar esas respuestas, lo que queda claro es que no obtendran mas que eso por que su respuestas no seran consideradas como las mejores.|`|RqkNIpiAaa	No me gusta que hagan eso por ejemplo mira en mi pregunta má sreciente, yo espero que los que saben de comic y animación me ayuden y bueno no solo aquí sino enotras secciones de Y!R donde pregunto, mis últimas preguntas no tuvieron buenas respuestas en el verdadero sentido, yo  me esfuerzo en mis respuestas así que espero lo mismo, pero tal vez solo quieren ganar puntos fáciles como si sirvieran de algo.<br>  En serio necesito ayuda con esta pregunta:<br>  <a href="http://mx.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AvDk8F5HHOEItYKTP7QmUeGY8gt.;_ylv=3?qid=20071114112402AASW0lz">http://mx.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a><br>  Y es cierto tienes toda la razón, mira quien fue la primera enresponderme .....|`|liIqiHJbaa	buena observación, claro que lo he notado como "no sé", "quien sabe", etc. es lo que más ponen pero bueno, la verdad mi estilo es buscar las preguntas que conozco al respecto o que simplemente me llaman la atención mientras buscaba algo que responder (como esta), antes de responder uno debe pensar en que sirva esa respuesta, si no, entonces ?Para que se molestan? (respuesta) por los puntos fáciles.|`|n4oo7SJFaa	Si tienes razon suele suceder pero que se puede hacer, seria interesante hacer que todos actuen como desearamos que actuaran, pero creo que no es necesario hacerse mala sangre por unos cuantos pelagatos que solo buscan puntuacion, yo prefiero seguir confiando en la buena fe que algunos le ponen en sus respuestas, ya sea mucho o poco pero siempre se puede aprender algo nuevo de cada persona|`|rC9m2eFGaa	Esque la gente es muy perezosa y no se molesta en investigar por la red, entonces yo me pregunto ?Que narizes hacen en yahoo respuestas??<br>   la verdad mas valdria que aprovecharon el tiempo en otras cosas.<br>  Quizas sea porque tambien esperan a que otro usuario conteste primero para plagiarle la respuesta...|`|m0TqKoAraa	Hola mi Fara!!!<br>  <br>  Pues mira mi fara, yo siempre hago preguntas con buen animo,  como para mover un poco la sección, tambien porque hay respuestas que son muy buenas, interesante, graciosas, serias..o simplemente para mantener contacto con los usuarios.<br>  <br>  ahora que al principio me daba cosa leer el +2, o el "no lo sé", pero despues de un tiempo pense, pues ya esta, que se queden con sus puntos, igual ya inverti mis cinco puntos..XD<br>  <br>  Y pues Fara, no ahy poque hacerse problemas, en todas las preguntas que he hecho, por cada tonto que responde asi, hay muchos que me dan respuestas muy buenas, asi que simple..se ignora eso y ya.<br>  <br>  yo me conformo con seguir mis preguntas, y pues tratar de responder siempre lo mejor que pudo, aunque como que me extiendo un poco.xP<br>  <br>  Saluditos...n_n<br>  <br>  "Affirmatio non negnati, incumbit probatio"|`|pOSaC1UMaa	je nada mas andan copiando de una pagina y ya<br>  no leen nada de la pregunta no saben de lo que estamos hablando son bolsones y solo van a molestar con su "no se"  o "quo es anime?" o " no entendi tu pregunta" <br>  <br>  osea enserio qe eso molesta yo e preguntado por ejemplo quien es goku? y luegio pongo no no se crean dejen saludos<br>  y algunas de las respuestas la copiaron de wilkpedia la biografia de goku y la pegaron <br>  <br>  je je necesitan  aprender a leer urgentemente|`|08f379b6b4738b963955fa65364c8678aa	Eso pasa por andar compitiendo, ya que la mejor pregunta pues a veces cuando la escogen es la 1ra que de una mejor ideda, yo creo que solo apartan y luego no editan o no saben ni que onda, como hace rato en tu pregunta de anime que dejarón de transmitir, creo que conteste algo que ya había dicho Al Naht, pero ni cuenta me di hasta que lei las respuestas y pues me gano la idea, pero como no estoy aqui por puntos sino pa entretenerme, pues no importa.<br>  <br>  SALU2|`|T1gKkbRWaa	Seeee... es deprimente, vienes a evr qué hay de bueno o nuevo y te topas con gente que responde "no sé" "+2" "gjhg" o cosas así...<br>  <br>  Y la o él que se hace llamar "Júpiter" ciertamente ya tiene historial. de hecho antes traía un avatar distinto (se lo cambia a cada rato) y se llamaba chobits... Hace unas semanas comenzó a responder a lotarugo varias preguntas diciendo "lo siewnto, es que me hacen falta puntos para llegar al nivel 3" y ese mismo día publicó su grandiosa pregunta de que la felicitáramos por ser nivel 3 XP Y nada que ver con una chica de como 16 a?os que también tare ese nick de chobits....<br>  <br>  La neta ya la tengo bloqueada desde ese día XP<br>  <br>  Y es de lo peor cuabndo ves tipitos que entras a su perfil y responden de todo en todos lados, y muchas veces con babosadas...<br>  <br>  A veces los reporto, otars hasta les mando un mail y les digo que no manchen, todo conrespeto... pero hay gente que te insulta al regersarte el mensaje XP<br>  <br>  Una tonta hace poco hasta sse burló de mí creyendo que yo era tarada al decirle que la estaba reportando. Pues si yo no le tengo miedo a que sepan a quién reporto o proqué motivos... XP<br>  <br>  Lo que pasa es que hay cada tipo cobarde y que sólo quiere ganarse puntos fáciles que dices "si así son en su vida normal, qué patéticos" XP<br>  <br>  Por eso yo mejor prefiero callar y parecer tarada a hablar y sacarlos de la duda XDDDDDD<br>  <br>  Salu2 XD|`|a88e17fd13477d5c73f4ba7fe7a3720eaa	por eso no respondo nada a menos de que sepa algo o al menos tenga una idea..................me dedico a ver las respuestas de los que si saben para ver si puedo aprender algo de eso que no sé<br>  <br>  me verás volver!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|pqy8l5K1aa	Cuando hago preguntas de anime.... por lo regular nadie las responde.  =.....(<br>  Pero la verdad si se pasán nisiquiera investigan, yo si!!!<br>  ademas solo contesto lo que sé... aqui no regalan nada por llegar a tener mas puntos....

El mesero se había quedado sorprendido de que solo con números hubiera entendido y fue a preguntarle a los chinitos que significaban, a lo que respondieron:<br>  <br>  "?Ah! Mul sencilo" 61, 31, 41, / + 31 + 41, 20, 20, 20<br>  <br>  Se senta uno, tenta uno, calenta uno, entle mas tenta uno, mas calentauno...vente, vente, vente|`|5BSB5zMVaa	jajaja bueno!|`|EK6aBrWAaa	ta bueno el chiste!!!!|`|IWXg6Tiyaa	jajajajaj|`|OMBZgsk8aa	Ha que chino,jajajaja,te regalo una estrella = )|`|naUxp9SWaa	hay una princesa china en sus aposentos, y llega un tipo y la intenta violar<br>  <br>  -escolta escolta, gritaba la chinita<br>  <br>  -es colta, pelo la vas a disflutal igual|`|njdeo7Hmaa	Muajaja... sí, una estrellita we. <br>  <br>  Inocente inocente.

If we act compassionately, maturely, and lovingly then our name becomes a fond memory to those whose lives we have touched.  If we act like untamed orangutans, then the next time others meet another who carries our name, there may be a negative emotion attached.  Great question...you get a star today!

444cc0a50021891de69824c19550f54daa	his style of play was amazing to say the least.  Most famous guitarists express their awe for the man in every interview  where they name him, and all openly admit that no matter how skilled they are, they can't play like the  man<br>  on top of that most lyrics he wrote are so universal and touching that it's hard to believe that they were written by a man with no education whatsoever .  (nearly) every single bluesmusician has at one time or another done a piece of music by Robert Johnson<br>  the story of his life is a matter of discussion.  he's supposedly not the johnson relative that sold his soul to the devil.  But still it's hard to believe that he learnt to play like he did in such a short amount of time.  the story goes that he was considered no more than an amateur by son house when he played in his band.  then for a period of 1-2 years he dissapeared from the scene to emerge as one of if not the greatest guitarist the 20th century had known.<br>  A few years ago me and a friend tried to analyse some of his music only to find that some of the chords and effects he played are impossible to play for the average human.  the man had extremely long fingers but still.<br>  he's the father of a whole lot of the music that followed, and still inspires many people to this day|`|2vzj65Kfaa	He was influential for all of the reasons listed by the other posters ...<br>  <br>  But also it was myth that helped him along.  For whatever reason, he gained posthumus fame even though a lot of what he is credited for was given to him by HIS influences.<br>  <br>  He did not make a deal with the devil at the crossroads (nor even really sing about it) - that was Tommy Johnson.<br>  <br>  He was not the best delta blues guitar player (though CERTAINLY one of the greats!)<br>  <br>  He did not invent the style of Delta blues, though certainly his enduring legend helps keep it alive.<br>  <br>  Although he wrote wonderful songs, some of his songs, or large portions of them were rolling around the south for years before he picked them up - written by bluesmen that are only just now beginning to be acknowledged for their contributions.<br>  <br>  Why is this so?  Hard to say, but I think the English bluesmen of the 60's crediting R. Johnson as their influence did a lot to perpetuate already existing myths.<br>  <br>  In my opinion the romanticization of these stories is as important to the blues as the music itself.|`|xlKuKqkFaa	Do yourself a favor and pick up the DVD called "Eric Calpton: The Robert Johnson Sessions"<br>  Eric Clapton is probably the biggest Robert Johnson fan around. Even his Grammy winning Unplugged album back in 1992 had a few Johnson songs on it.<br>  In the DVD he basically explains his influence, style and plays most of his songs. He even goes to the locations where Robert Johnson recorded his songs.<br>  This is a great clip from the DVD on youtube:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETELORdwmJA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETELORdwm...</a><br>  When the great Eric Calpton has trouble playing your music, you know you must have been one of the greats.|`|geq6iU0Oaa	My brother Conchobor gave a great answer. Robert Johnson's influence is half talent and skill, half an undefinable mystique. Why that mystique surrounds Johnson rather than a number of others is probably unanswerable. The fact that his recordings were largely unknown until the release of "King of the Delta Blues Singers" in the early sixties, the paucity of factual information surrounding his life and death, the existence of only two known photos-all contributed to that fact. Its the James Dean syndrome. If Robert had lived long enough to be "rediscovered" and paraded before adoring whites like Son House, Reverend Gary Davis, Mississippi John Hurt, etc. (all of whom recorded before Johnson) I suspect he would be less mythical today.|`|958b3c9dfffbd359af24a34956241277aa	I agree with Martin Couch.  One thing though is that Johnson played what became known as Delta, and that sound carried on to Memphis and Chicago.  When white English players in the 60's sited RJ as an influence, they had to have made that connection, likely through Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf and those guys.  IMO, RJ was not such a phenomenonal player.  While I prefer the Delta sound, the Piedmont players had the chops and most of them were blind.  Blind Blake and Blind Willie McTell played circles around Robert Johnson.  I've have read articles as well that during his day, RoberT Johnso was consdiered average compared to his contemporaries.  he was famous for his lifestyle and the way he died.|`|0vfX40Qxaa	Some of his original songs became blues standards when they were first recorded, but I see his biggest influence, on the Blues Rock of the 60's  he became very popular with and influential to players like Keith Richards, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck and Jimi Page.|`|4WHgZw01aa	The fact that little was known about him is what made him so incredibly influential. His amazing talent complemented by his mysterious life gave rise to legends, like going to a crossroad to sell his soul to the devil for the gift of guitar. This kind of superstition was exactly what people needed in the early 20th century, the industrial revolution heavy on everyone's mind, and a legend as spectacular as that must be the only explanation as to how Robert Johnson could have such amazing guitar skills. He embodies the first original roaming pariah guitarist, living on street tips while he played, and a life shrouded in mystery.|`|akUVg7CEaa	He was very talented, at singing, playing a guitar, and songwriting.<br>  <br>  He died young, which also added to his myth, as it does with many musicians and other entertainers who die young (see Buddy Holly, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, James Dean, Marylin Monroe etc.).<br>  <br>  He was lucky enough to be recorded, and many musicians since have studied his recordings, to learn how to present their skills the way he did.|`|AA11826768	Robert Johnson didn't just play the blues.He lived the blues. Like Muddy Waters he was a child of the blues. When he performed he was playing and singing what he had in his soul. Picking cotton and putting it in an eleven foot sack you drag with you. While dodging rattle snakes. And trying to ignore the cuts from the cotton bowls will give you the blues.<br>  As a child i was made to pick cotton once for a short while so i would know what real work was. so i know a little of what that,s about. but it was not just that it was the Jim crow laws and poverty that shaped him.<br>  this is why he was so influential. He was the blues.|`|FUwnW9Mtaa	Being the originator of a specific style.|`|Drkql0syaa	Simply put...He was a genius! He probably didn't even realize it.|`|ESKn4BrXaa	Because he is Robert Johnson.

3Y3pPdl0aa	Dog was sent to jail for 5 years, convicted of a murder he didnt commit. That's where he found God in his life. God now plays a major role in his life. He still claims his innocence.<br>  <br>  I got this from Wikipedia. Might not be 100% true. I did read an interview his son did where he said that his father is fake on the show and that he is really a racist!!!!!|`|mYDwfq0qaa	I think he went jail for being an accessory to murder (he heard the gun shot and did not contact the police) so it would not be a long sentence and good behavior, time served, and possibly a plea bargain would also make the sentence shorter if he had any.   I think he was also into drugs and stealing before he went to prison.

Y es probable que se haya usado en los países del Asia Oriental hacia el tercer siglo de la era cristiana. Y hay quienes opinan que un milenio más tarde, Marco Polo la introdujo en Europa.<br>  <br>   Los chinos usaban un trocito de ca?a conteniendo una aguja magnética que se hacía flotar sobre el agua, y  así indicaba el norte magnético. Pero en ciertas oportunidades no servía, pues necesitaba estar en aguas calmas, por lo que fue perfeccionada por los italianos.<br>  <br>   El fenómeno del magnetismo se conocía; se sabía desde hacía mucho tiempo que un elemento fino de hierro magnetizado se?alaba hacia el norte, hay diversas teorías sobre quién inventó la brújula. Ya en el siglo XII existían brújulas rudimentarias. En 1269, Pietro Peregrino de Maricourt, alquimista de la zona de  Picardía, describió y dibujó en un documento, una brújula con aguja fija (todavía sin la rosa de los vientos). Los árabes se sintieron muy atraídos por este invento;  la utilizaron inmediatamente, y la hicieron conocer en todo Oriente.<br>  <br>   La brújula (de "buxula", cajita hecha de boj o boxus) es un instrumento magnético que aparece descripto en La Divina Comedia de Dante, de la siguiente manera: "Los navegantes tienen una brújula que en el medio tiene enclavada con un perno, una ruedecilla de papel liviano que gira en torno de dicho perno; dicha ruedecilla tiene muchas puntas y una de ellas tiene pintada una estrella traspasada por una punta de aguja; cuando los navegantes desean ver dónde está la tramontana, marcan dicha punta con el imán."<br>  <br>   Otros historiadores se?alan que la primera brújula de navegación práctica fue inventada por un armero de Positano  (Italia), Flavio Gioja, entre los siglos  XIV y XV. él fue quien la perfeccionó  suspendiendo la aguja sobre una púa de forma similar a la que actualmente conserva. Y la encerró en una cajita con tapa de vidrio. Más tarde apareció la "rosa de los vientos", un disco con marcas de divisiones de grados y subdivisiones, que se?alaba 32 direcciones celestes, y que fue la brújula marina que se utilizó hasta fines del siglo XIX.<br>  <br>   Posteriormente se logró un nuevo avance, cuando el físico inglés  Sir William Thomson (Lord Kevin) logró independizar a este instrumento, del movimiento del barco durante tempestades, y anuló los efectos de las construcciones del barco sobre la brújula magnética. Utilizó ocho hilos delgados de acero sujetos en la rosa de los vientos, en lugar de una aguja pesada. Y era llenada con aceite para disminuir las oscilaciones.<br>  <br>  En los comienzos del siglo XX aparece la brújula giroscópica o también llamada girocompás. Consiste en un giróscopo, cuyo rotor gira alrededor de un eje horizontal paralelo al eje de rotación de la tierra.  Se le han agregado dispositivos que corrigen la desviación, la velocidad y el rumbo; y en los transatlánticos y buques suele estar conectado eléctricamente, a un piloto automático. Este girocompás se?ala el norte verdadero, mientras que la brújula magnética, justamente, se?alaba el norte magnético.<br>  <br>  Sobre el tren, pues no echa humo porque es eléctrico, usa electricidad.<br>  <br>  la diferencia son 5 y media docena de huevos.|`|0eb8e13c1513240926e9789f0501b936aa	Una brujula es una viejula sobre una escobula.<br>  <br>  El tren electrico no hecha humo.<br>  <br>  La diferencia son 33 hombres.|`|d123fc6301714e68d9dd2b9b13d6ba5aaa	1-Una viéjula sobre una escóbula.<br>  2-No echa humo un tren eléctrico.<br>  3- 66 huevos

ifzlR4tAaa	Mira este: "Un mes de atraso".<br>  Una gallega le dice al marido: <br>  "Fíjate Paco que tengo un mes de atraso. Creo que<br>  vamos a tener un ni?o. El médico me dijo que ma?ana me daba el resultado de los análisis.<br>  En eso suena el teléfono. Es una llamada de la oficina de cobros de la Electricidad.<br>  La se?ora contesta, y le dicen "Somos de la Electricidad y queremos comunicarle que en nuestros archivos aparece que usted tiene un mes de atraso". <br>  La se?ora se sorprende y pregunta: "?Pero cómo pueden saberlo?"<br>  _"Porque nuestras computadoras llevan el registro de todos los atrasos".<br>  La se?ora, turbada, le pasa el teléfono al marido y le dice: <br>  "Oye Paco, son los de una oficina de la Electricidad y ya saben que tengo un mes de atraso". El marido, extra?ado, toma el teléfono y les pregunta: "?Es verdad que saben lo del mes de atraso?" - <br>  _"En efecto - le responden - y le estamos avisando que deben realizar inmediatamente el pago del atraso".<br>  _"?Un pago? ?De veras? Joder.... ?Y qué pasa si no quiero pagar?"-<br>  _"Pues entonces personal nuestro tendría que ir para allá para su casa y se la tendríamos que cortar". <br>  _"?Co.?o! ?Tanto? y en ese caso, ?qué podría hacer mi esposa?"<br>  "Pues realmente no sé. ?Pienso que probablemente tendría que utilizar una vela!".|`|yriLOHC2aa	Estee!:<br>  <br>  Una viejecita fue un día al Banco del Comercio Bancomer" llevando un bolso lleno hasta el tope de dinero en efectivo.<br>  Insistía ante la ventanilla, solicitando que quería hablar única y exclusivamente con el Presidente del Banco para abrir una cuenta de ahorros, para lo cual decía comprenda Ud., es mucho dinero".<br>  Después de mucho discutir, la llevaron ante el Presidente del Banco, respetando el concepto de que el cliente tiene siempre la razón.<br>  El Presidente del Banco inquirió, cual es la cantidad que Ud. desea ingresar.<br>  Ella dijo que $165,000.00 US$ y automáticamente vació su bolso encima de la mesa.<br>  El Presidente, naturalmente, sintió una gran curiosidad por saber de donde habría sacado la viejita tanto dinero y le pregunto: Se?ora, me sorprende que lleve tanto dinero encima, por ser mucha cantidad y acto seguido le pregunto: como lo ha conseguido? La viejecita contesto: " es simple, hago apuestas" Apuestas? pregunto el Presidente,que tipo de apuestas? La viejecita contesto: "Bueno, todo tipo de apuestas; por ejemplo le apuesto a Ud., $25,000.00 US a que sus testiculos son cuadrados!"El Presidente soltó una carcajada y dijo: "Esa es una apuesta estupida.... Ud., nunca podrá ganar una apuesta de ese tipo". La viejecita lo desafió. Bueno ya le dije que hago apuestas; esta Ud., dispuesto a aceptar mi apuesta? Por supuesto, respondió el Presidente. Apuesto 25,000.00 US$ a que mis testiculos no son cuadrados.La viejecita dijo: "De acuerdo, pero como hay mucho dinero en juego, puedo venir ma?ana a las 10.00 AM con mi abogado para que nos sirva de testigo? Por supuesto, respondió el Presidente, teniendo en cuenta que se apostaba dinero.<br>  Aquella noche el Presidente estaba muy nervioso por la apuesta paso largo tiempo mirándose sus testiculos en el espejo; volviéndose de un lado para otro, una y otra vez. Se hizo un riguroso examen y quedo absolutamente convencido de que sus testiculos no eran cuadrados y que ganaría la apuesta.<br>  A la ma?ana siguiente a las 10:00 en punto, la viejecita apareció con su Abogado en la Oficina del Presidente. Hizo las pertinentes presentaciones y repitió la apuesta de 25,000.00 US$ a que los testículos del Presidente son cuadrados.<br>  El Presidente acepto nuevamente la apuesta y la viejecita le pidió que se bajara los pantalones para mostrar sus testículos.<br>  El Presidente se bajo sus pantalones y la viejita se acerco y miro sus testículos detenidamente y le pregunto tímidamente si las podía tocar; expresando: tenga Ud., en cuenta que es mucho dinero y debo cerciorarme. Bien de acuerdo, dijo el Presidente convencido, 25,000.00 US$ es mucho dinero y comprendo que quiera estar absolutamente segura". La viejita se acerco al Presidente y agarrandole empezó a palpar sus testículos; paralelo a lo cual el Presidente se dio cuenta de que el Abogado estaba golpeándose la cabeza contra la pared.<br>  El Presidente pregunto a la viejita: y ahora que le pasa a su Abogado? Ella contesto "Nada,solo que he apostado con el 100,000.00 US$ a que hoy a las 10:00 de la ma?ana tendría las testículos del Presidente de Bancomer en mis manos".|`|X2J67610aa	No es el mejor de toda mi vida, pero es uno bastante bueno.<br>  <br>  Suena el teléfono en el cuartel a las 3 de la ma?ana:<br>  -Hola?-dice el soldado que atiende, somnoliento.<br>  -Páseme con el sargento, y que sea rápido-dice el General, del otro lado de la línea.<br>  -Mire, el sargento está muy cansado y pidió que no lo molesten, llame ma?ana por favor.<br>  -Escúcheme incompetente, páseme con el sargento ya!-responde furioso el General.<br>  -?Es usted sordo o se hace?

Lo vi besando tu cuello, y aprovechando que salió, quiero pedirte que cooperes con él y hagas todo lo que te pida. Si quiere tener sexo contigo, no lo rechaces y finge que te gusta. No lo hagas enojar. ?Nuestras vidas dependen de ello! se fuerte yo te amo.<br>  <br>  La joven esposa le dice al marido: Querido: estoy complacida de que pienses así. Efectivamente, ese hombre no ha visto a una mujer en muchos a?os, pero no estaba besando mi cuello. Estaba diciéndome al oído que tú le gustas y quería saber si guardamos la vaselina en el ba?o. Se fuerte, mi vida; yo también te amo!!!

Pueden estar presentes uno o más cálculos al mismo tiempo en el ri?ón o en el uréte<br>  <br>  Los cálculos renales son muy comunes. Aproximadamente el 5% de las mujeres y el 10% de los hombres habrán experimentado un episodio, como mínimo, antes de llegar a los 70 a?os de edad. La recurrencia de los cálculos es frecuente y son comunes en bebés prematuros.<br>  <br>  Los objetivos del tratamiento son aliviar los síntomas y prevenir síntomas futuros (los cálculos renales usualmente desaparecen por sí solos). El tratamiento varía según el tipo de cálculo y la magnitud de los síntomas o las complicaciones; y puede requerirse hospitalización si los síntomas son severos.<br>  <br>  Cuando los cálculos salen, se debe colar la orina y conservarlos para analizarlos y determinar su tipo.<br>  <br>  La ingestión de líquidos debe ser abundante para poder producir una gran cantidad de orina. Se recomienda tomar agua, al menos de 6 a 8 vasos al día, e igualmente se puede requerir la administración de líquidos intravenosos.<br>  <br>  Es posible que sea necesario administrar analgésicos (calmantes) para controlar el cólico renal (dolor asociado con el pasaje de los cálculos). Si el dolor es muy severo, se pueden administrar analgésicos narcóticos.<br>  <br>  Dependiendo del tipo de cálculo, se pueden indicar medicamentos para disminuir la formación de cálculos y/o ayudar en la desintegración y excreción del material que causa el cálculo. Estos medicamentos pueden ser diuréticos, soluciones de fosfato, alopurinol (para los cálculos de ácido úrico ), antibióticos (para los cálculos de estruvita) y los medicamentos que alcalinizan la orina como el bicarbonato de sodio y el citrato de sodio.<br>  <br>  Si el cálculo no sale por sí solo, puede requerirse una extracción quirúrgica. La litotricia puede ser una alternativa a la cirugía. Las ondas ultrasónicas o las ondas de choque se emplean para desintegrar los cálculos de forma que puedan ser expulsados con la orina (litotricia extracorpórea por onda de choque) o extraídos con un endoscopio que se inserta en el ri?ón a través de una peque?a incisión en el flanco (nefrolitotomía percutánea).<br>  <br>  Pueden ser necesarios algunos cambios en la dieta con el fin de reducir la recurrencia de algunos tipos de cálculos|`|CiJBhYEkaa	Creo que Si es posible<br>  <br>  Mi abuela sufria de calculos renales, y se los sacaron.<br>  <br>  Tambien la vesicula.<br>  <br>  No le han diagnosticado calculos.|`|0eb8e13c1513240926e9789f0501b936aa	Así es, Bebota.

834e49d3bae86765bd01b3e28aa519dbaa	i agree, bill engvall is the funniest and best looking...|`|hiJXETeRaa	Not a lady, so I can only answer the first part.  When I first listened to them, I thought Ron White was the funniest of the 4, but in following comedy specials, he hasn't added much new material.  I think he has the potential to be the funniest, but he needs to keep it fresh, or he'll always be outshined by everyone else inevitably.  Currently, I would give the edge to Bill Engvall because his comedy seems the most natural, has the most variety, & seems less forced.  Larry is playing a character, & it shows, even though he's still quite funny.  Jeff is pretty funny, too, but is still having trouble escaping the "you might be a redneck" schtick.<br>  <br>  As for looks, if any women pick Larry, that will prove one thing: there's hope for all men everywhere!

Un día llega de urgencia un chico con una bala en la cabeza, cuyos padres han sido asesinados y cuya hermana se encuentra traumatizada y no habla. Justo antes de operar, el director ordena a Tenma tratar al alcalde, que acaba de ingresar, pero éste elige al ni?o fiel a sus valores. Mientras que el chico se salva, el alcalde fallece.<br>  <br>  <br>  Esto hunde la carrera de Tenma, que de casi ser director de urgencias pasa a estar totalmente denigrado.

El mamífero más fiero con el arácnido más temible, sospechosa combinación. El detalle que hay aquí es que los dos son dominantes, habrá que ceder un poco para que ambos sean felices. ESCORPIO es demasiado celoso para permitir que LEO esté coqueteando en todas partes, y a LEO le encanta ser el centro de atracción. ESCORPIO deberá comprender que LEO necesita sentirse el rey, aunque no lo sea y que, por lo tanto, precisa que continuamente le ratifiquen que tiene aptitudes de mando y que su pareja lo reconoce. Si deciden unir sus implicables fuerzas, no habrá puerta que se les resista, excepto las de un piso para convivir. Se admirarán desde lejos, manteniendo las distancias y harán bien en no acercarse. Respetarán el uno el terreno del otro, pero si se mezclan surgirán las gigantescas diferencias que les separan. ESCORPIO y  LEO no se entienden con facilidad, por lo que el LEO nunca vivirá altos vuelos junto a ESCORPIO. (Nota: Esta relación funciona mejor entre Mujer LEO y Hombre ESCORPIO)<br>  1.B) COMPATIBILIDAD ESCORPIO - ACUARIO: Ambos viven en mundos apartes, pero a millones de a?os luz. El exclusivismo de ESCORPIO choca con el individualismo de ACUARIO, que es  volátil, impreciso e indefinido. Aunque ESCORPIO admira las cualidades humanitarias de ACUARIO, no quieres compartirlas con el resto del mundo y cuando trates de encerrarlo, ?verás lo que son problemas!  ESCORPIO es de temperamento fuerte y sólido y tomará como una afrenta los descuidos del despreocupado ACUARIO creándose mal ambiente entre ellos. Entre un signo tan mal pensado como ESCORPIO y otro tan despistado como ACUARIO, la incomunicación es abismal. Esta combinación termina en una guerra de nervios porque ACUARIO hace cosas insólitas que sacan de quicio a ESCORPIO.<br>  2) ACLARACION: Acuario no es un signo del elemento agua, sino de aire.<br>  3) ESCORPIO ES COMPATIBLE CON LOS SIGUIENTES SIGNOS SOLARES: Tauro (Mejor cónyuge - Mejor socio), Cáncer (Mejor maestro), Virgo (Mejor amigo), Libra (Enemigo secreto), Escorpio, Capricornio (Mejor “amigovio” - Mejor vecino) y Piscis (Mejor amante).|`|vee6j3bjaa	pues a esta escorpiona,con leo le pasa lo mismoooooooooooooo. y bueh!!!|`|66f2160b7b403d2461f53f54ffde67ecaa	Yo soy acuario y dicen que nos llevamos mal con los escorpios, aunque muchos de mis mejores amigos lo son.

El hombre Escorpio tiene muchas virtudes deslumbrantes para ocultar sus vicios, pero es tremendamente ingenuo y bondadoso por naturaleza. La pasión que nace entre los dos perdurará mucho tiempo pues la mujer Tauro y el hombre Escorpio son leales por naturaleza. Ella tendrá un orgullo y devoción sin límites por él, mientras él será incapaz de darle celos. <br>  La mujer Tauro y el hombre Escorpio se sienten fuertemente atraídos físicamente, aunque una unión entre ellos puede llegar a no ser muy duradera, pues será la Tauro, quién quiera conquistarlo sintiéndose enormemente atraída por él, mientras él con un cinismo que le caracteriza la mayoría de veces, la abandonará sin ninguna explicación, tan solo por el hecho de hacerlo.<br>  <br>   con Sagitario <br>  La mujer Sagitario se adapta perfectamente al hombre Escorpio sin perder nunca su personalidad y pueden formar una de las parejas más felices del zodiaco. él es dominante en el amor, muy sentimental con la mujer que quiere conquistar y puede fingir en cualquier momento la escena que más le conviene sin parpadear. él necesita estar en soledad y tranquilidad en numerosas ocasiones, sin estar rodeado de multitudes. <br>  Por el contrario a ella le encanta estar en compa?ía permanente y cuando no es así es inquieta e irritable. En ocasiones estas diferencias son las que ocasionan desavenencias. Ella busca en su marido el amor incondicional y le gusta ser el centro de atención en su matrimonio, todo esto lo puede encontrar en el hombre Escorpio que puede representar sin ningún tipo de esfuerzo el papel que ella desea.|`|b4HOGpw3aa	Hola los escorpios son un temazo y sin conocerte te digo que eres: Vengativa,egocentrica,muy sentimental,orgullosa y cuando alguien te gusta pones el ojo sin importar nada y por ese impetu lo tienes que pasar muy mal.No quiero parecer pesada pero para pareja los escorpines...no no no.Pero claro,es lo que los signos muestran aun asi no son santos de mi devocion.Saludos y suerte!!|`|zGDkbb6maa	con un libra pues se dice q en épocas antiguas una hermosa princesa el cual su signo era libra y un joven príncipe Escorpio eran la pareja perfecta y al ser su amor imposible el destino unirá a los grandes ya sean amigos o pareja

PFDfOYPPaa	Hola!!!<br>  Tienes un corazón muy tierno por querer conseguir empleo de cupido. Pero bueno... yo te digo esto. Las cosas pasan si tienen que pasar. Si el destino de ellos es estar juntos, así será porque las casualidades no suceden así por así.<br>  Si dices que Paula ahora está sola, considero que primero tendrías que investigar si ella siente algo por Ernesto en el sentido amoroso. Porque creo que sería muy cruel para él que ella le llegará a decir que "nada que ver" y él resulte herido emocionalmente. Si ella dice que si le gusta pues creo que tendrías que motivar a Ernesto para que le expresara sus sentimientos.<br>  <br>  También hay que tomar en cuenta algo muy importante, si él no lo hace... quien sabe cuando lo volverá a hacer. Las cosas pueden cambiar ma?ana y si espera tanto, ella podría empezar alguna relación. <br>  <br>  De mi parte... les deseo mucha suerte a ambos chicos y espero que tu puedas lograr tu cometido de cupido.<br>  Un abrazo y una estrellita para ti!<br>  <br>  Bye! Bye!|`|TH8Xnu1Yaa	se que quieres ayudar, pero no puedes obligar a que dos personas se enamoren, lo tienen que resolver ellos mismos. podrias decirle a ernesto que se le declare a paula, y que a partir de ahi se arreglen ellos dos|`|Rm6szazuaa	e?|`|V3ivaIgLaa	es muy lindo de tu parte quererlos unir, me gusta la idea de que quieras ayudarlo eso hace ver lo mucho que lo quieres,para empezar si quieres ayudar a ernesto debes de contarle lo que piensas hacer asi pueden buscar estrategias entre los dos, por otro lado un buen comienzo seria que el o tu le ayudaras a escribirle cartas o poemas a paula que la fueran conquistando poco a poco, aprovecha estas fiestas para hacer actividades las cuales puedan ellos compartir y conocersen un poco mas, pero te repito que ernesto sepa y quiera eso verdaderamente<br>  <br>  te deseo muchos exitos en tu tarea de cupido, en verdad espero que los puedas unir porque segun como me describes se verian lindos como pareja<br>  saludos<br>  <br>  pt: ojala si pasa nos cuentes los resultados haber si nuestros consejos funcionaron|`|YJfLCR8faa	Te digo que no desesperes y si es su destino estar juntos, va  a pasar|`|liIqiHJbaa	chava, que buen corazón tienes!!!, por desgracia, la vida real es la vida real, tú no puedes mandar a las demás personas para que se enamoren si no quieren o no se deciden, lo único que podrías hacer es pláticar con ellos y tratar de convenserlos de que se declare uno al otro, si no dejalos hasta que se den cuenta o sea tarde, pero bueno, lástima que la vida no es como un anime, cambiarle si algo no te gusta, decidir la vida de los personajes, no te molestes, pero debes aprender a aceptar las cosas tal y como son, ya sean buenas o malas.|`|ef163cffca5cea2db7e1fd7db658ab93aa	Hola me gusta la idea de que juntes a dos corazones pero te doy a dar un consejo ponte de acuerdo con Ernesto para que le den un regalo para Paula algo que le agrade un bonito detalle de la epoca navide?a, para que asi recuerde esa navidad, otra idea es de que los invites alos dos al cine y escogan lapelicula pero apra no te sientas mal inveta algo para que ellos solos vallan y despues te cuenten que tal esta la peliclula son mis unicas ideas suerte......
UrJarxYLaa	Perdona compa?ero que invada tu pregunta pero alguien que esta en el oscurantismo y quiere limitar la libertad de expresion borro la mia, asi que cualquier comentario, duda, pregunta, e incluso insultos (ya me estoy familiarizando) la recibo con gusto en juan.sahagun@yahoo.es<br>  <br>  Primero quiero disculparme si alguien se ofendio con mi pregunta de ayer: <a href="http://es.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...">http://es.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a> <br>  Lo que pasa es que en mi humilde opinion YR puede ser mas constructivo que destructivo y como me pidieron una pregunta interesante pues ahi va...<br>  <br>  ?QUE OPINAN?<br>  <br>  La gente que muere joven traen un mensaje o una ense?anza, son maestros, se van cuando terminaron su tarea, son almas avanzadas que solo a eso vienen: ense?ar, al igual que los que nacen discapacitados, cuando estan en una familia donde hay amor son maestros, vienen a ense?ar, cuando estan desamparados son almas que estan aprendiendo y tienen que vivir eso para aprender, es su Karma, y no solo tenemos una oprtunidad (una vida), eso dicen las religiones para "espantar" y que "compres" el perdon, ?te has dado cuenta que hay gente que hace maldad sin remordimiento? son almas que estan iniciando el camino, todavia no hacen "conciencia" de sus actos con el karma. Con el karma es como aprendemos, no es porque se tiene que regresar el da?o o el mal o porque Dios nos castiga por el mal que hicimos, es la forma de aprender, y hacer conciencia y sentir en carne propia el da?o que provocamos, ?por que hay narcotraficantes, asesino, etc... que viven sin recibir su karma? porque ya le tocara en la siguiente vida sufrir por un hijo drogadicto, o que le maten a un hijo, la mejor forma de hacer conciencia, ?no crees? este es un ejemplo, nadie puede decirte como se va a regresar un karma. El fin es que todos alcancemos el "cielo". Aunque la mayoria de las religiones lo niegan pero la ciencia (psicologia) ya comprobo la reencarnacion con las "regresiones" (ya paso el tiempo en que si lo niega la iglesia no existe, eso fue en la edad media, ?la tierra es plana? ???evoluciona!!!)

True Crime movies are always popular, so keep your eyes open for movies involving serial killers coming out in the near future.|`|qNcfTQRAaa	The Zodiac|`|tbDUdtJjaa	the only one i can think of is zodiac but he did not target only females he targeted couples.|`|AA11314600	Zodiac|`|1TEsJLqzaa	It's a little older than 6 1/2 months but in January 2006 there was a movie released called Green River Killer which was about Gary Ridgway who was the Green River killer, he went on for about 25 years without the police ever having a clue, they finally got him about 2 years ago.  Let the new serial killer movies begin !!!   Hope this helped

Y CANDY CANDY ERA UNA NI?A QUE SE ENAMORABA DE SU PRINCIPE AZUL|`|41fca3ef26f94d9028de0111ec2c9ca8aa	Candy fue un verdadero fenómeno porque de entrada la historia es fascinante: Una ni?a huerfana de gran corazón, intrépida y fuerte que pasa por momentos difíciles antes de ser adoptada por una familia rica. Encuentra como todo el mundo su primer amor a los 12 a?os, solo que lo pierde en un trágico accidente; pero no todo es desgracia, despues la vida sigue y conoce a Terry, el amor de su vida en una románica noche en la cubierta del barco que la llevaría a estudiar a un prestigioso colegio británico, las aventuras en el colegio de monjas son divertias, románticas, peligrosas..., en fin, el sue?o de adolescencia de cualquier mujer joven. Después abandona el colegio para pese a ser una rica heredera, dedicarse a ser util a la sociedad y decide ser enfermera, es decir, no es la clásica historia de telenovela mexicana de la pobre inculta que se vuelve una dama refinada de un dia para otro.<br>  El final, el final no es lo que esperábamos, y nos duele mucho, pero es parte del encanto. Lo que la serie necesitó es una continuación en la que Candy y Terry siguieran peleandose y amandose como en el colegio.<br>  <br>  Bueno, otro factor que convirtió a Candy en un hit fueron los galanes de la serie y el fabuloso primer capítulo.|`|Pq7Sr1Qgaa	Era algo asi como una telenovela japonesa hecha caricatura.<br>  <br>  Aqui hay una ligera descripción:<br>  <a href="http://www.animedia.com.mx/animecomics/anime/candy/candy.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.animedia.com.mx/animecomics/a...</a><br>  <br>  Saludos.|`|bbiywRCvaa	puedes comprobar lo que te han dicho en este link<br>  <br>  a mi me encantaba de peque?a, pero me gustaban solo los capitulos de cuando Candy era una ni?a, despues todo fue drama y dolor...|`|fc5f62e944d6ca68ca2664349a136da3aa	era una huerfana, adoptada por unos ricos me parece que se enamora de uno de la familia, y se la pasa buscandolo osea era su amor imposible,  es una tipica historia, de la pobre se enamora del rico, la humillan, la pisotean a mas no poder, pero muy buena, aki te dejo una foto|`|9ryMdyW5aa	aggg.... es una ni?a incomprendida, enamorada, llorona y medio tonta...

En el anime se dice que ocurrió un día de invierno y caía nieve, pero en el manga se convierte en un día de mayo...<br>  <br>  En el hogar de Pony<br>  Tras pasar toda su infancia en el orfanato y criarse como hermanas, Annie y Candy son inseparables. Al crecer, el fuerte carisma de Candy hace que una familia muy rica quiera adoptarla pero ella se niega para no romper la promesa de estar siempre juntas que le hizo a Annie.<br>  <br>  Sin embargo, es Annie quien es adoptada por la familia Britter, y Candy ve su inocencia defraudada por los firmes deseos de su "amiga" de tener padres.<br>  <br>  Después de un tiempo, Annie, tras de escribir varias veces a Candy, le comunica que ya no lo hará más, pues su madre adoptiva le dice que no puede permitir que sus nuevos amigos se enteren de que procede de un orfanato.<br>  <br>  Desconsolada, Candy corre a la Colina de Pony y es ahí cuando se encuentra por primera vez, a los 6 a?os, a su "Príncipe de la Colina" (su primera ilusión), quien pronuncia la frase más popular de la serie:<br>  <br>  "-?Por qué lloras, ni?a pecosa? Eres mucho más linda cuando ríes que cuando lloras".<br>  <br>  El príncipe se marcha sin decir su nombre, pero se pierde un prendedor que Candy conserva como amuleto.

DYoNH7T7aa	Hey! www.manga-destination.com is a way better site for free online viewing. Also it uses photobucket for it's viewing which is better than some of the regular manga viewers because:<br>  <br>  1) Regular manga viewers WILL NOT REFRESH a certain page. Photobucket will.<br>  <br>  2) Regular manga viewers can be SLOOOOOOW depending on your Internet. Photobucket works at a constant speed.<br>  <br>  3) No maintanance needs to be done on the server, which means it's available to view more often<br>  <br>  4) Anyone can upload, so it does haven't to go through the admin, which means more manga and faster.<br>  <br>  So overall, the Manga Destination online viewer is more convenient than other sites and makes online viewing simple and efficient!|`|12f4eb48840ca8cd78f8c042ddcf1195aa	try this, they are realy good, you have to register but it is for free...<br>  <a href="http://www.mangatraders.com/files/manga" rel="nofollow">http://www.mangatraders.com/files/manga</a>|`|QUcMvRAtaa	i read manga on onemanga.com|`|ac35f09a157429e34ba70bc44b1d3280aa	hey my friend, try out this site at <a href="http://www.mangavolume.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mangavolume.com/</a> i am sure you will like it^^^

Sin revisar el contenido del paquete,<br>  el joven envió el regalo a su novia con la siguiente<br>  nota:<br>  <br>  "Escogí este regalo porque he notado que no usas nada<br>  cuando salimos por la noche; si no hubiera sido por tu<br>  hermana, hubiera escogido los largos con botones, pero<br>  ella se probó estos cortos que son más fáciles de<br>  quitar.<br>  <br>  Quería escoger una tonalidad más delicada, pero la<br>  vendedora me mostró los que ella usa; no se los había<br>  cambiado en tres semanas y no se le nota para nada la<br>  mugre.<br>  <br>  Le pedí a la vendedora que se probara estos que compré<br>  para tí y en verdad se veían muy bien. Quisiera estar<br>  contigo para ponértelos por primera vez; no tengo duda<br>  de que otras manos los tocarán antes de que los vuelva<br>  a ver.<br>  <br>  Cuando te los quites, recuerda soplarlos antes de<br>  guardarlos pues es natural que cojan un poquito de<br>  humedad.<br>  <br>  Sólo puedo pensar en cuántas veces los voy a besar<br>  durante los próximos meses; espero que los uses para<br>  mí el próximo viernes por la noche.<br>  <br>  <br>  Recibe todo mi amor.<br>  <br>  Paco<br>  <br>  P.D. La última moda es usarlos doblándolos un poquito<br>  hacia arriba para que se vea el peluche".

Ya en el concurso paso primero un conejo que contò un chiste, pero la tortuga como si nada, de hecho el chiste era tan malo que nadie se rio, asi que tuvieron que cortarle la cabeza. Asi fueron pasando todos los aimales, y nadie podia hacer reir a la tortuga.

50p3V7JSaa	I'm surprised you haven't watched "Princess Tutu" yet. "Princess Tutu" is a fantastic anime about a duck (named Ahiru, which actually means "Duck" in japanese) who watches a prince, whose eyes are full of emptiness, dance. She wishes that she could see his smile, and says she would do anything to see it. A strange man named Drosselmeyer lends her a pendant that is able to turn her into a girl, and when she is girl, she is able to transform into Princess Tutu.<br>  <br>  Sounds pretty light and fluffy, correct? Nope. This anime has its fair share of dark, depressing moments. Actually, as the series progresses there are more dark moments that light ones. It's what makes the series so beautiful. <br>  <br>  The name certainly doesn't do the anime justice. It probably scares people away, if anything. But if you stick around to watch a few episodes, I can almost guarantee that you'll fall in love with it. It carries an intricate plot, with many twists and turns. The animation is gorgeous and in great quality. The characters are extremely easy to connect with. You will find yourself laughing along with Ahiru as she has her comedic moments, and you just might find yourself crying with her, too, as she mourns over the tough choices she must make.<br>  <br>  "Princess Tutu" truly is a gem; an anime like no other. I can hardly describe it in words. (But I'm sure wikipedia can do better.) Here's wikipedia's entry on "Princess Tutu", but beware, there are spoilers.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Tutu" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Tu...</a><br>  <br>  If you would like to watch the episodes, this site has all of them except for the last three Akts ("Akts" are like full episodes. The first season has 13 Akts, each 20 minutes long; each a full episode. The second season has the Akts broken up into two parts, or two episodes, each 10 minutes long. There are only two seasons.)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tv-links.co.uk/show.do/3/3598" rel="nofollow">http://www.tv-links.co.uk/show.do/3/3598</a><br>  <br>  The rest of the episodes you can find on veoh.

(Remember, season two, Akt 14 through 26, each have two parts (or episodes). So Akt 14 would be episodes 14 and 15, and Akt 15 would be episodes 16 and 17, and so on.)<br>  <br>  Give this anime a chance. You won't be disappointed. Just a side note: It's certainly not perveted, but it's got good looking people in it.

"Rumbling Hearts" -- High school swim jock Mitsuki originally befriended Takayuki because her timid friend Haruka had a crush on him and she wanted to help her make a connection, but over time she, Takayuki, and Takayuki's friend Shinji became the best of pals. Despite her own interest in Takayuki, Mitsuki pushes him and Haruka together, and ultimately they become a couple. Just as they are starting to get serious about their relationship, though, tragedy strikes, leaving Haruka in a coma for three years. Though torn up for a long time over what happened to Haruka, Takayuki is eventually forced to cope, and ultimately finds love again with Mitsuki. When Haruka finally awakens, she is unable to comprehend that, while time has not passed for her, it has for the other people in her life. But turning the clock back three years is not so easy a thing to do, not with everything that has transpired since.<br>  <br>  ANN link: <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=2570" rel="nofollow">http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclop...</a><br>  <br>  2.) "Simoun" -- On the distant planet of Daikuuriku, everyone is born female and chooses their permanent sex when they turn seventeen. Centuries before the storyline begins, an ancient yet advanced civilization fell into ruin, leaving behind the mysterious aircraft known as "Simoun." In the present day, the country of Simulacrum has a monopoly over these machines, which they regard as "chariots of the gods," but when the neighboring country of Argentum decides to take the Simoun by force for their own imperalist goals, war breaks out and caught in the middle is the elite Simoun squadron of Chor Tempest.<br>  <br>  ANN link: <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=6287" rel="nofollow">http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclop...</a><br>  <br>  I realize I didn't mention the yuri relationships in my summary of Simoun, but after watching it, you'll come to realize why Aaeru (the main character's name) quite literally means "the highest form of love."|`|RbzCXdupaa	Elfen Lied but it's on the mature side.

I enjoyed Ai Yori Aoshi and the sequel Ai Yori Aoshi ~Enishi~, which I guess is harem but I liked it waaaay better than Ichigo 100%.  If you want something kinda soap-opera-ish, try Rumbling Hearts (Kimi ga Nozomu Eien).|`|aLij6i7Saa	Go back in time... to the 80s, friend.<br>  - Maison Ikkoku.

ihsKogu2aa	The radio station has to keep playlists per FCC rules so sometimes if you call the station and tell them a bit about the song & approxiamtely what time it played  they can tell you.<br>  <br>  Good luck!  : )
ihsKogu2aa	Yes, she was killed by an assasin in the 2nd movie . The shooter was trying to kill Bourne and shot Marie instead, which prompted his vendetta in that movie. <br>  <br>  The 3rd movie is about him trying to find out who "turned" him into a spy/assasin and him wanting revenge on the people who did that to him.|`|FrFHEl29aa	yes, she dies in the 2nd one.

jByLKnzgaa	if j.k. rowling had written it that way, the story would have been much shorter, also fudge probably would still be the minister. if harry used a pensieve to show his memory, the fight at the ministry with ron, hermione, luna, and neville would not have been the same because then everyone from the ministry would be there as well as the order members and that wouldnt have been so awesome. i like the way she wrote it because it goes with the rest of the story so well. any other way just wouldnt be harry potter-ish!<br>  <br>  and to stephaniek, it is also easy to tell when a memory has been altered; for example in slughorn's memory, everything went unnaturally dark and they heard slughorn's voice, so even if they had done it that way, fudge would know it wasnt all truth.|`|8ab62bcab301d81ad0fea7cabc2ec3baaa	It appears that the reason for the pensieve is that the person no longer has to retain the memory.   Therefore, if Harry put it in teh pensieve he would no longer being able to recall it, which could have been deem too great a risk.<br>  <br>  Plus it was clear that the Minister was being unreasonable and seeing only what he wanted to see, being in strong denial.  Even if he saw what happened, he probably still would have tried to explain it away.|`|AA11612093	Pensieves are very rare and also very expensive.  In addition, as we see in the sixth book with Slughorn's memory, it is possible to alter memories.

En una de mis extremidades se encuentra una zona con pelos que transporto con arrogancia. Cuando me utilizan, lo hacen introduciéndome rápidamente y a menudo con vigor. No obstante, hay adiccion de una utilización rápida y otros de una lenta: todo depende del humor y de la condición física. Sin embargo, el modo de empleo siempre es el mismo: movimientos repetidos en el interior de una cavidad cálida y húmeda, que crean una fuerte excitación en la zona afectada.<br>  <br>  Cuando concluye mi tarea, dejo en la cavidad húmeda una sustancia blanca, espumosa, pegajosa y un poco azucarada. Esta secreción también queda sobre mí y en mis pelos. Hay que lavarme para que esté limpio de nuevo en espera de mi siguiente utilización.<br>  <br>  Una vez recuperado el estado de reposo, espero inmóvil mi próxima actuación. Podrían hacerse de dos a tres veces al día, pero es un ritmo que pocas personas son capaces de llevar.<br>  <br>  ?Quién soy?<br>  <br>  .............<br>  ...........<br>  ........<br>  <br>  El cepillo de dientes !!!!!!!!<br>  EN QUé ESTABAS PENSANDO ???? xD<br>  <br>  ? ? ? ? ??  ≈ ? ? ? ? ?

He introduced it to his students initially as a poem and asked them to interpret what the lines meant.  The interpretation is amazing! It's so profound and moving... <br>  <br>  Here's the direct link to the song: <a href="http://forums.pearljam.com/showthread.php?t=241909" rel="nofollow">http://forums.pearljam.com/showthread.ph...</a><br>  <br>  But if you really want something that doesn't have a clear meaning, then do BUGS by Pearl Jam..

Traven es un escritor que publicó algunas cosas el siglo pasado en México, pero nadie sabe cual era su nombre, el cual siempre firmaba como B. y su apellido Traven (B.  Traven)<br>  <br>  En el proceso de ponerle nombres a las calles de la Ciudad de México, según los historiadores, a algún "brillante" político o delegado se le ocurrió llamar la calle con el nombre de ese escritor, y como no sabía su nombre, pensó que Bruno sonaba bien.<br>  <br>  Y así quedo la calle, con ese nombre, un nombre inexistente (al menos con quien se supone se le relacionó)<br>  <br>  <br>  Hay otras calles curiosas en el oriente del D.F. hay una calle que se llama Goma y en la esquina con Chicle, se encuentra una empresa de dulces llamada Tutsi-Pop.<br>  <br>  Otra es la calle de la quemada que proviene de una antigua leyenda en México. Una mujer muy bella en la epoca colonial, cansada de que un noble caballero retara a duelo a todos sus posibles pretendientes y los matara decidió meter su rostro en un brasero ardiendo, quemándose horriblemente la cara. El confesor de esta bella mujer se entero por boca de ella que ella esperaba que al dejar de ser una mujer bella, cesarían los pleitos por ella y la dejarían en paz. Para asombro de ella misma, el caballero que la pretendía pidió su mano admirado por su nobleza de corazón y se casó con ella. Por ese hecho se llama así esta calle.<br>  <br>  Saludos|`|736299cc3f93228199baf18421775f4baa	La calle Cucha Cucha siempre me pareció una jodita de algún funcionario de la municipalidad.|`|0nGeuKcgaa	La calle ahorro esquina con prestamo, me dió mucha risa jajaja|`|a174f3e7c565425bc836024b8c6699daaa	pues va a parecer groceria pero yo vi una que se lalamaba "Parada de vergara" si esta medio subidita de tono la calle, no?|`|naUxp9SWaa	en chile existe una calle que se llama "CALLEJóN DE LOS PERROS"<br>  <br>  obviamente los vecinos de esa calle solicitaron que se le cambiara el nombre<br>  <br>  tambien existe otra calle llamada "PLANO REGULADOR", lo que no se es si esta ubicada en la vi?eta del plano regulador que la proyecta

Cuando goku lucho contra majn buu goku le costava muxo manteer la forma de ss3 ya que normalmente esta transformacion solo se puede hacer en el otro mundo por eso estava a puunto de perder|`|02UUUpoRaa	Despues de 80 combates puede ganar goku|`|1qInPTP8aa	pero seguro, ademas lo pone en cuatro patas y le empiesa a dar carne rosada para que guarde!!   jajaja|`|FMe3cEBmaa	goku nivel 4, claro, en bragon GT se fusiona con ub y ni asi le se le hacercaba|`|LxzIHQGQaa	PERO POR SUPUESTO,FIJATE QUE MISTIC GOHAN Y GOTENKS SSJ3 LE ROMPERIAN LA CARA A MAJIN BUU MALO SI ABRIR LOS OJOS,ENTONCES IMAGINATE GOKU SSJ4|`|M8FI0Q87aa	goku es mas fuerte en nivel 4 tonses goku es mas fuerte  ke majin boo|`|jf9um0Phaa	creo q quedarian igualados.... seria una pelea dificil... ademas guku siempre necesita ayudas de otros<br>  <br>  si pelean solo los dos, sin q nadie los molestes, creo q ganaria majin boo<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  mattane|`|liIqiHJbaa	respuesta sencilla:<br>  claro que si!!<br>  si observas los enemigos van de acuerdo al nivel de fuerza de Goku en esos momentos, como Yamsha, Tao Pai Pai, Ten Shin Han, despues Piccolo, Freeazer, Cell, etc. y cada uno de estos en el orden son más poderosos que el enemigo anterior, por lo mismo, si logró ponerse a su nivel con el 3, mucho mejor con el 4.<br>  <br>  lo unico que no me agrada es la version AF!!<br>  <br>  Akira!! me gusta asi como dejaste tu historia, y luego vienen aficionados a continuarle sibn sentido!!! WAAA!!<br>  <br>  Sakurita es mi socia!!<br>  <br>  Sayounara!!|`|mhztTyM5aa	por supuesto como ya te dijeron varios usuarios ya dos ssj3 le roperian la cara a ese magin booy si goku pelea en niovel cuatro equivaldria maso menos el mismo poder ese es mi punto de vista.|`|fZsBjjhVaa	un rato largo goku 4 es de niveles mas alto por que es de la saga GT lo que quiere decir que la saga Z es de niveles bajos|`|mzBBHRdHaa	para darte una idea.......no se si habras visto un capitulo de dragon ball gt, en donde goku chiquito se enfrenta aun general mecanico llamdo rildo, y goku dice ""esto no se compara con majimbu"", significa que aun estando asi ya le hubiera dado lecciones jeje, o sea que en SS4..... seria como que aquel majimbu peleara contra mR. Satan o algo por el estilo jaja,|`|pkA1uwtkaa	goku se pone mas fuerte despues de cada batalla  yo creo que en fase 4 le ganaria a boo|`|zOgMTR7xaa	goku gana por mucho, recuerda q goku no podia hacer la transformacion de super sayayin 3 porq el cuando estaba muerto le era facil de hacer, al revivir le costava mucho mas, despues q se adapto es muy probable q venciera a boo en un abrir y cerrar de ojos|`|0700e65fe4a2d65428dc671f07d42febaa	por supuesto<br>  <br>  :-)|`|1cbaa04f3c6d2e4be5aeb6db4c2ac05caa	Claro que si cuando goku se convirtio en supersayayin 4 era mil veces mas fuerte que bu
85fbf5c5846fb27813ab868e3d2a9df9aa	1.- por ke goku ya traia los arcillos<br>  2.- por ke es mas rapido<br>  3.- por ke NUNKA convenceria a vegeta de hacer los pasos (a pesar de ke lo convencio en la pelicula de janemba, pero esa es otra historia, y ademas se ubica despues de la saga de boo.)<br>  4.- por ke majin boo podria haber matado a goku para cuando pudieran hacerla. (osea ke tardarian mucho a comparacion de con  los arcillos para fusionarse)<br>  5.- por ke con los arcillos no existia el factor tiempo como desventaja.<br>  6.- kon la fusion, los peleadores , mas bien, el peleador pierde totalmente su objetivo, y la pelea se vuelve puro juego para el ( o ellos como prefieran).<br>  7.- alguien tendria ke entretener a boo mientras goku le mostrara los pasos de la fusion a vegeta ( y no habia nadie con esa capacidad)<br>  8.- tmb el poder es un factor importante, recuerda ke debian tener "ki" al mismo nivel, y el tratar de igualar sus poderes necesitaria de un poco mas de tiempo, y tiempo es una cosa ke obviamente no tenian.<br>  <br>  <br>  bueno eso es todo lo ke se me ocurre por el momento jaja|`|NT8zZxT5aa	Ahí ma's pillao.|`|liIqiHJbaa	porque no duraba mucho tiempo solo duraba 15 min. y para volverse a fusionar era media hora, imaginense!! asi como hiban a matarlo!! jamás, y como ya estaban desesperados, mejor usaron los aretes|`|zJY9acNcaa	no hacieron la fusion normal porque ni vegeta ni gohan sabian hacerlo y ademas como sabes buu no s tan tonto pa dejarles hacer la fusion|`|BCNdpSpFaa	Xq hay como 3 razones:<br>  <br>  -De seguro vegeta no iba a querer hacerla<br>  <br>  -La fusion por pohtala es mas poderosa que x la fusion<br>  <br>  -Goku iba a perder tiempo convenciendo y ense?andole los pasos a vegeta. digo, majin boo pudo haber hecho algo en ese tiempo<br>  <br>  Suerte|`|HuOVDIlHaa	no la hicieron porque sus poderes no estaban al mismo nivel, fijate que goku era mucho más poderoso que vegeta. además, creo, querían darle algo de importancia a los supremos kaios, porque en realidad no ayudaron practicamente en nada|`|LxzIHQGQaa	1)porque el plan desde el principio era que goku se fusionara con gohan,pero como majin buu lo absorbio,goku tubo que ir con vegeta despues de que se diera cuenta de que vegeta se encontraba en la tierra.<br>  <br>  2)ademas, seguramente vegeta no iba a queres hacer la fusion con esa tecnica tan ridicula y menos la iba a hacer con goku.<br>  <br>  3)no habia tiempo para ense?arle ni a gohan,ni a vegeta los pasos de la fusion,porque majin buu no los iba a dejar.<br>  por eso prefirio usar los arcillos ya que la fusion con ellos es mucho mas rapida y tambien infinita.|`|zOgMTR7xaa	bueno, ello se fucionaron con los aretes porq con ellos tenian un poder mucho mas elevado que la fusion normal, no tenia limite de tiempo, no tenian q hacer pasos ridiculos, no tenian tiempo de practicarlos y vegeta se reusaria a hacer esos paso|`|1cbaa04f3c6d2e4be5aeb6db4c2ac05caa	Mira la intentaron hacer pero majimbu no dejaba de atacarlos y no les dio oportunidad de hacerlo. por eso goku llevo los arcillos para poder hacerla mas rapido|`|YMiZkVWdaa	ola que tal? sou brasileira! estava passeando pelos países e vi sua pergunta sobre Dragon Boll e me interessei! n?o entendi bem o que você disse, mas era viciada no desenho, principalmente a primeira vers?o! rsrsrs beijos pra você! tenha um ótimo dia!!!
BCNdpSpFaa	Si la hay, es una linea 3ra, en la que el cell del presente (osea, el que hizo el cell games) sale en esta( que ahi es creado), que en esa 3ra linea, trunks llego a eliminar a los androides, y cell, como no estaban los androides, no podia alcanzar la perfeccion, asi que cuando trunks iba a viajar a una linea 4ta (xq esa linea no tenia relacion con la 1ra y la 2da, osea, la actual y el futuro de trunks)<br>  cell mata a trunks y le roba su maquina y se va a la 1ra linea, ose, la actual<br>  Creo que cell lo mencionaba cuando estaba peleando con piccolo<br>  <br>  Suerte|`|BnGe0gSJaa	Si cell lo mata y le roba su maquina del tiempo,por eso aparece en la época de goku y los demás|`|LxzIHQGQaa	EXACTAMENTE COMO YA TE LO HAN DICHO LOS DEMAS USUARIOS|`|eo326sMZaa	por supuesto que existe ya por eso cell puede llega ala epoca en la que goku nuna murio|`|hDvso5Unaa	si|`|iiStThasaa	claro que si, cuando trunks vuelve de avisar sobre los androides y de avisar k gocu morira por un una enfermedad del corazon, el regresa a su tiempo, el cual es el mismo solo k el viene del futuro... al regresar a su tiempo se encuentra con cell, el cual no vacila en asecinarlo con su propia espada, asi cell roba su maquina del tiempo y con ella regresa a el mismo tiempo en el k trunks avisara, es asi como nadie sabia de cell, ya que trunks aviso de los  andriodes pero  desconosia de cell.. <br>  <br>  saludos|`|liIqiHJbaa	pues me imagino que si, pero de seguro la mayoría de las lineas del tiempo debieron ser que Trunks moría en manos de los androides 18 y 17, pues era la mayoría de su preocupación, pues despues aparece Cell|`|zOgMTR7xaa	si, ya q cuando trunks llega al pasado, cell en otra linea de tiempo llega al pasado, cell llego mucho antes q trunks, el cell de la epoca en dond llego trunks fue destruido, gracias a eso el cell q viajo en el tiempo y llego antes q trunks pudo absorver a los androides y poder llegar a su face final|`|0700e65fe4a2d65428dc671f07d42febaa	si<br>  <br>  :-)|`|DkKcTRaxaa	no lo se es posible|`|2LcldHkNaa	si ya que llegaron los androides 17 y 18, y ellos eran despiadados y malos y mataron a todos los guerreros de artes marciales menos a thrunks ya que no le prestaron tanta importancia x el poco poder q tenia en ese instante, ademas de que gohan le pidio a thrunks que vengara a todos los guerreros q habian muerto. El Dr. Gero tenia un plan: El ordenador secreto del Dr. Gero que estaba en el sotano del laboratorio mas tarde creó su proyecto final, un ser mitad androide mitad ser vivo, un ser que cumpliría su sue?o de destruir a Gokū: Cell, el cuál fue creado de la fusión genética de los más poderoso guerreros: Gokū, Piccolo, Vegeta, Freezer, etc. Pero necesitaba absorber a los Androides 17 y 18 para llegar a su máximo poder. Apareció en una máquina del tiempo, ya que venía desde el futuro, y empezó a absorber a humanos con su cola, lo que le hacía incrementar su poder. Piccolo, al descubrir esta nueva amenaza, subió al palacio celestial, y se fusionó con Kami Sama para formar un super guerrero Namekusei. Gokū, ya recuperado de su enfermedad, entra a la habitación del tiempo junto a Trunks, Gohan y Vegeta. Piccolo quería destruir al androide 17 para que Cell no lograra su perfección, pero Cell llegó al combate y estuvo al borde de matar a Piccolo (lo dejó inconsciente bajo el agua) y absorbió al Androide 17, lo que hizo que cambiara a un segundo estado más poderoso y más parecido a un humanoide. y luego sigue lo demas q absorbe ala otra androide....|`|AtNAUNoPaa	si cell mata a trunks, creeo cuando descubre la forma de acabar a los androides cell lo mata y roba la maquina del tiempo de este para encontrar a los androides que en el futuro no los encontro|`|c91agt09aa	Bueno que yo sepa o mejor dicho lo entiendo de esta forma, Es correcto, Cell mata a truns, pero en una linea de tiempo antes de que aparesca trunks por primera vez, esto lo comprendi en el capitulo en que hayan la nave, la que esta toda vieja y llena de monte. porque cell ya estaba aun cuando vino freezer el mismo lo dice cuando va a entrenar al espacio que le serviran las celulas de freezer para poder estar en el espacio. bueno los capitulos si no se cuales son, pero eso es lo que entiendo. o he logrado deducir. suerte.|`|mhztTyM5aa	si!
rl0Zq1gvaa	I was a HUGE fan of TNES growing up.  Whenever I was allowed to pick out a movie to rent, that was the one I chose.  Unfortunately, my parents, and ESPECIALLY my older sister, hated this face, because it ALWAYS gave me nightmares.<br>  <br>  EVERY<br>  <br>  SINGLE<br>  <br>  TIME<br>  <br>  I eventually bought the movie as an adult, and have watched once or twice since high school, but still with trepidation.  While I enjoy the movie, I just know it's going to restart the recurring nightmare of the wolf besides my bed, licking his lips, showing his white teeth, and paralyzing me with fear so that I can't scream, or even move.<br>  <br>  Whenever I decide it's time to go into therapy, he will most likely be the first thing I discuss.  Even before my mother.<br>  <br>  I say all this to assert that G'mork is the second scariest Hollywood monster, with Scientology being the first.|`|K2pAQeBQaa	If you mean like,<br>  the scarriest monster you wouldnt want to see<br>  I think the guy with no eyes in Pans Labrynth was the scarriest<br>  <br>  If I actually saw that guy in real life<br>  I would probably never sleep again<br>  <br>  maybe its his pale skin<br>  maybe its his claws<br>  maybe its how he moves<br>  maybe its his creepy breath<br>  I dunno<br>  but hes scary as s***|`|Z7ahwdDCaa	 i have only seen both of those movies once.....when i was 13,i like the movies,in fact i'm buying them,& i didnt find that monster as scary as the island turtle!|`|53a84f79585762fc7ab61d83be60d1dcaa	Haha...I remember watching this movie back in the 80's when I was in grade school! He's not scary--just a talking puppet! LOL...|`|m9r3ONd4aa	Sorry, but I'm not really sympathizing. G'mork never bothered me|`|jo8V5nAgaa	hecks yeah!!!!! my spine still gets that cold chill when he snarls and his eyes get all glowy (creepy!)|`|AA12016383	i would have him as a pet
742e7a50895672653c4eed6ddedd5c24aa	I'm not a fan of Eve, but I will say that she doesn't exploit her sexuality like a lot of other female rappers do, which make me respect her more.  I think her best song is "Love is Blind." (SoSin recently reminded me about this song).|`|CEKZsoFRaa	She's cool, fashionable. Last I saw her on VH1's Hip Hop Honors. She's probably still "in the studio". Songs I've liked are Tambourine, Love is Blind, and Blow Your Mind.|`|911c5486ad6f6c3cef4af6c4ca5e728eaa	she is definately do-able!!!!<br>  <br>  just like you!!!!|`|eV5E9MhUaa	You mean the black chick that dies her hair blond? I'd say I rate her... bleached. |`|o0C2wWCtaa	H O T ! ! ! ! !|`|rEqHeTY5aa	I thought she was working with Justin "Nappy-Headed" Timberlake.|`|mnzOTYP1aa	love is blind and it'll take over your minddd, what you think is love is truely not, u need to elevate and finddddd|`|PSR8CRcQaa	Eve look like a crooked faced man<br>  that was one bytch I couldn't stand<br>  |`|QDEcahpLaa	SHES HAWT!<br>  <br>  LOVE IS BLIND<br>  OR I GOTTA MAN|`|CDnmuX1Jaa	I dont like her music<br>  <br>  But she can get it :| <br>  <br>  Sorry for the rudeness|`|AYkEwqRXaa	I like Eve.  She was one of the best female rappers.  I won't say she's fallen off, but she has been M.I.A.(pardon the pun) for a while.  Her last album got pushed way back like not released.  Fave tracks<br>  <br>  Who's That Girl<br>  Gotta Man<br>  Anything I Want(I think that's what it's called)<br>  
PeQ40WcWaa	That's horrible. I hate people like that. I just can't understand why they have to be so vile. 22 is not too young to have a child! For God's sake, when my grandma was that age, people were married off at 17.<br>  <br>  The worst thing I have had recently was a bus driver. I live in Birmingham and the busses here are awful. Everyone is so rude. I come from a little village where people would queue properly for the bus and you would let elderly people on before you. In Birmingham it isn't like that!<br>  <br>  I had just had the most awful, rubbish day. I was close to tears anyway due to relationship rubbish (isn't it always?!). Got on the bus.. asked for a ticket to my area. He didn't hear me, and instead of using his mouth, he was over the top rude and cupped his hand over his ear in this really arrogant way. Then when he finally got me, he sighed really loudly and rolled his eyes. Then when i waited for my change, he ignored me, and eventually said "you're not getting any change". He did the same to a couple of other women. <br>  <br>  Then when i got off the bus, he sped past my stop and suddenly screeched to a halt, then only opened one door!! So i sighed and got off the bus - then he shouted after me sarcastically "thank you!!", so i turned around, gave him the middle finger and called him something i would never normally call a bus driver! I really never do that, but he was SO vile!!<br>  <br>  I really did want to report him. I think it's great that you wrote a complaints letter. <br>  <br>  Don't let him get to you. The sorry idiot most likely lives on his own. I'd bet money for it. Bitter old fool.<br>  <br>  xx Emmie|`|Ua1OiWmbaa	I have lots of bad experiences, one time I was swore at by a member of staff who later apologised but blamed it on having a bad day.|`|bljBwqCaaa	that's ******* horrendous what happened to you. <br>  speak to the guy's superior, i'm sure they'd want to know about it. |`|YeWaVMIEaa	the bank! my mom wont let me get my money out of it :O cry|`|pc3Z4PZsaa	ya one time me and my mama were at wall mart and my moms cash account got shut down cause the system was down and the lady said we didn't have the money to pay for it and then the lad had the nerve to yell it across the store to another worker. then i cursed her out in a foreign language and walked away|`|Vw5pO9luaa	I was called deaf and stupid, so i verbally abused them before slapping them silly.<br>  <br>  ;]|`|rqOpdqUXaa	done the right thing,<br>  good luck|`|c2uEs18eaa	Ugh. People are just IGNORANT about mothers. I had to ride on the bus when my son was younger, and strangers would come up to interrupt if he was crying or whining, to suggest...<br>  He must be hungry<br>  Maybe he is thirsty<br>  Perhaps his diaper needs checking<br>  He looks to be overdressed/underdressed (on the same trip, in the same outfit)<br>  He ought to be napping<br>  Maybe I should undo him from the stroller and hold him<br>  Maybe I should lay him back in the stroller<br>  Eventually, on a really bad day, I snapped at someone, Yes, he is crying. Do you suggest I smother him, or beat him, or drug him, or spoil him, or neglect him? Cause I don't see any of those options as preferable to what I am doing right now, thank you. :-)<br>  Later, when my son was about 3, he wanted to ride on the blue bus one day. Nope, the number 7 bus taking us home was red, sorry. So there I was, with him bellowing his outrage, until the bus driver actually pulled over at a bus stop and turned around to snap at me to shut him up. And I smiled (OK, you might quibble, actually my teeth were bared) and said I knew exactly what the problem was, it would be much appreciated if he wouldn't mind stepping out and repainting the bus for me. No? Well then, nothing I can do.<br>  Not to say nobody is helpful or considerate... just, many people show their irritation and disapproval while pretending to condescend with some uninvited advice.|`|xG29HFeLaa	I had a bank bounce 2 checks on me when I had enough to cover either of them alone but not both.  The representative said I'm sorry but its the computer and there's nothing we can do about it.  Well, above her desk was a customer service award plaque.  I pointed to the plaque and said I don't know how you got that but you certainly don't deserve it.  closed my account and left.<br>  another time. me and some buddies stopped at a strip club in Canada.  We were the only ones in there and the girls did not dance and no one came over to take an order for drinks for a good 15 minutes.  We ordered our drinks and after they started to come over we got up left.<br>  |`|eXE3NE6Daa	bought a self assembly table from Asda and when i got it home discovered it had no legs.when i took it back to customer services the lady suggested that that was the way they all came.|`|5cf10b9f247ea700ce15c2a77c990d36aa	Loaded a trolley with 17 boxes of 13" x 10" ceramic tiles, 2 large buckets of premix tile cement, 1 large bucket of premix grout, various tools, and went to the checkout to ask for assistance in moving what was by then an extremely heavy load. Was assured help would be sent immediately to where the trolley was. Waited 20 minutes - no help. Went and asked again and was again assured help would be sent immediately (same checkout girl) waited another 20 minutes - no help.<br>  Struggled (I was 61 and not very fit) and managed to get trolley to checkout one my own. Bathed in sweat, dripping off face and soaking my t-shirt.<br>  Paid. Asked for help getting trolley to car - was told 3x help was on it's way. Never arrived.<br>  Now I know I should have abandoned this exercise much sooner, but was determined to begin the tiling job that day, so didn't.<br>  Struggled, huffing and puffing, to car park, loaded up and left B & Q thoroughly disgusted.<br>  Wrote a letter of complaint to the store manager and their head office.<br>  Then another.<br>  Then another.<br>  3 MONTHS later, got a reply from the head office which informed me that an "anonymous shopper" had been to the store and reported "good" levels of customer service, but they were sorry I had found reason to complain. It was quite clear I was being fobbed off.<br>  B & Q, where I used to spend a fair amount of money in a year, haven't seen me since.<br>  Can't say I miss them.

991623483fab2646191b06c4cc5abde8aa	I've always loved this show but last Sunday was a huge disappointment.  I really missed Carolyn and George, even though I knew they weren't going to be part of it (since Carolyn got fired and George is in New York) and I'm just not buying Ivanka as the seasoned "veteran" who is so business-savvy that she's in a position to really critique others.  I didn't like having the winning project manager sit on the other side of the table either and really hope it's not going to be that way every week.<br>  <br>  I also hate the tent city idea and keeping the same project manager until he/she loses too.  The project manager part doesn't even make sense since a big part of the judging process has always been to see how every single one of them handles being a PM at least once.  (In the past, participants have been criticized for not "stepping up" and volunteering to be PM at certain times!)<br>  <br>  I didn't have a problem with the project itself since I know there will be a lot more complicated ones down the road and sometimes the things that seem like they should be the easiest end up being the hardest, but the boardroom was sooo annoying with everybody talking over everybody else and trying to get the last word in.<br>  <br>  I can't find much of anything positive about this season based on the first episode.  If it doesn't get a lot better really fast, this will probably be the last year because the ratings are going to sink even lower than they already are.  Being up against "Desperate Housewives" isn't going to help it much in the ratings category either.|`|076738792e78b29df5726ad83c1e7533aa	It stunk! Not bothering to watch next episode!|`|0e4276e0851a729381d1133b7aafc095aa	If it doesn't get better, this should be the last season.  I want George and Carolyn back.  I think the whole 'haves and have nots' is stupid.  The whole 'keep the same project manager until he/she fails' is ludicrous.  This is a sinking ship...|`|8df11d168accf941bf3130e6f62ef19baa	They've made too many changes to the show. I think it's corny having people sleep in the yard. I agree with the other person, I want George and Carolyn back too. It wasn't broke but Trump still tried to fix it. And one more thing California doesn't have the right feel for the show. I don't know about the candidates yet, I'll watch and see how it plays out.|`|1e7b350dd94e597ef7b663828acd1899aa	It was totally boring. It seems that the Donald has become soft. I like his past seasons better. Those were really challenging and engaging to watch. It took a turn from serious to silly. And no, it does not appear to be high standard to me.|`|AA12390047	I thought it was entertaining.|`|4fc01f58b1e64fe2198371bbc6ad568eaa	It's getting stupid.  A bunch of morons who think they're type A personalities.  It'd be somewhat entertaining but this group are horrible.  The guy with the horrible clothes who got fired was just annoying.  <br>  <br>  This show has never been about the best and brightest.  It's about drawing in ratings.  Trump makes money by viewers.  All this crap about tents and carwashes and overzealous idiots making fear-ladened speeches in the boardroom is just stupid.<br>  <br>  Trump and Rosie is better than this crap.

That is very rude to give someone a gift and ask them to pay for it. A gift is something free that you give from your heart. You're asking her to buy the puppy. My advice is to return the puppy. Then get her something within your budget.  Don't ask her to give you the money back. You might actually get a date with her if you do a selfish act of kindness from your heart. |`|ygjuc7i6aa	She shouldn't  pay for it if you are giving it to her as a gift.

You bought her a Shih-Tzu puppy as a gift but you want her to give you the money for the gift you got her?  You do know that usually when you buy someone a "gift" it is usually something you give them free of charge.  You don't go and buy something for someone then turn around and say "Hey I brought you this really cool puppy.. it cost $450 so give me the $ and you can have the puppy.  Does that sound right to you cause it doesn't to me.  I mean if this is how you are when you give her a "gift"  that could be the reason why the 2 of you are not a couple.  That is just me opinion.|`|qDHc5EHOaa	Sweet Secrets?

Also, regardless of the level of difficulty, it is not impossible for anyone to learn a new language, either by another person who teaches you or by self-learning. But one thing for sure is you really need three things that are essential for learning another language: adequate and appropriate learning resources, understanding of the way you learn, and passion of learning.<br>  <br>  When you learn a language, two things you can’t do without are books and audio-visual media. Books can teach you mostly on written text, including pronunciation guide in purely written text, while audio-visual media, including DVDs, CD-ROMs, and DVD-ROMs, teach you mostly in oral language, including pronunciation, and not much of written language. (The Rosetta Stone is considered audio-visual media.) When you shop for language learning materials, it is best to buy a set of language learning kit that comes with both books and audio-visual media (DVDs, CD-ROMs, and/or DVD-ROMs) that are correlating to each other in the sequence of chapters and sections. This is the easiest way to self-learn a foreign language because you can study the pronunciation from audio-visual media while you read the book to learn the written text, plus you can follow the chapters and sections easily. Otherwise, you can buy a book and an audio-visual media separately. The difference is you will have to work a little bit harder compare to learning with a kit with both types of materials combined. You also may have to do some bookmarking for reference when you use a book while listening or watching audio-visual media.<br>  <br>  Also, there are three more things you can seek help to when learning a new language. These are IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet), internet, and the people whom you trust the most. For those of you who don't know what is IPA, it is a set of alphabet where each letter represent only one sound for consonants and vowels and other symbols as changes in the way a consonant or a vowel is pronounced. It is traditionally used by most linguists around the world as the most standard form of phonetic alphabet for all languages of the world and now used in many foreign language textbooks where the foreign languages do not use Latin alphabet (including Russian, Greek, Hebrew, and Japanese). Some languages have phonetic alphabet that is not found in most languages, which makes most people having difficulty in mastering some of those languages without knowing the exact pronunciation first. Even though you have overcome pronunciation difficulty, I suggest you to use IPA as a guide for correct pronunciation. If you can find a foreign language material that uses IPA, I encourage you to buy it, or at least borrow it. Besides major languages, there are some good numbers of books and other media materials that will teach you minor languages in libraries and bookstores. Check you local bookstores and libraries first. If you can’t find it, try going to large bookstores or libraries in large cities where there are more choices than the ones at suburban or rural areas. Also, if you are a university student or you have access to borrow materials from a university, the libraries in universities (including Stanford, Harvard, and Yale) are truly excellent sources for finding materials for learning both major and minor foreign languages.<br>  <br>  Alternatively, go to Wikipedia or Omniglot on the internet (I will get to the details of Omniglot later) and find the language you are learning; many languages now have pronunciation guide in IPA. Just look for the pronounced words closed by two square brackets like these [ ] on most webpages, including Omniglot, or two slashes like these / / on many webpages of Wikipedia but not in Omniglot.<br>  <br>  For more information on IPA, see the webpages below for details.<br>  <br>  International Phonetic Alphabet (from Wikipedia)<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPA" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPA</a><br>  <br>  The International Phonetic Association (also with the same acronym IPA)<br>  <a href="http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/IPA/" rel="nofollow">http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/IPA/</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Since many of you now have computers with access to internet, the internet is also another good source of reference. There are many websites that will give you information on foreign language and the method of learning, but I do recommend you to go to Omniglot, an excellent informational website on languages run by Simon Ager, an Englishman with tremendous interest in foreign languages. It has plenty of details on the written languages as well as useful advices in learning foreign language. You will like Simon Ager and his website after you read those information if you haven’t visited his website before.<br>  <br>  Omniglot<br>  <a href="http://www.omniglot.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.omniglot.com</a><br>  <br>  <br>  If you have family members, relatives or friends who are at least bilingual, who are fluent in the language you are planning to learn, and whom you can put your trust upon, I encourage you to ask them for help. Make sure you tell them that you are interested in learning their language and want to practice the conversation in their language. Once they agree with you, this is your opportunity to improve a foreign language by practicing with them. When there is an opportunity, grab it as soon as possible before you lose it.<br>  <br>  The correct combination of resources is one thing, but the method of learning is another matter. When learning, don’t just learn with diligence; learn with your planned strategies and tactics. With strategies, you want to think big and create a grand plan for achieving an ultimate goal – to be proficient in a foreign language in reading, writing, speaking and listening. Also, you have to break down your grand plan into manageable mini-plans so you can work on both short-term and long-term plans. Be clear, specific, and realistic on planning. Work on each mini-plan gradually and sequentially. Make sure you focus and follow your plan accordingly. If you are unable to reach each small goal within your time limit, be flexible in making changes in your plan. Learning a new language takes time.<br>  <br>  With tactics, you are using your skills to enhance your learning and overcoming the obstacles. Before you start learning, you need to understand yourself. You need to know how you learn when you learn. There are some people who can learn by reading text, some who can learn visually (through illustrations and charts), and some who can learn by listening, and so on. If you want to know about how you learn, I recommend you to understand theory of multiple intelligences by Howard Gardner. You will be surprised by how much you haven’t known about your secret self.<br>  <br>  Theory of multiple intelligences (from Wikipedia)<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_multiple_intelligences" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_m...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  There are also plenty of websites where you can get yourself tested on your preferred learning method for free. Just use your favorite search engine and type “Theory of multiple intelligences” or “multiple intelligences” and it will do the searching quickly and easily.<br>  <br>  Once you know your strengths and weaknesses in learning skills, utilize your strengths while learning a new language and, at the same time, improve your other learning skills that are your weakness by leveraging with your strengths to maximize your learning potential. Nobody is born with talents; talents are created through learning knowledge continuously and using your knowledge wisely and appropriately.<br>  <br>  Finally, the most important ingredient in successful learning is passion. You need to maintain your interest in the language you are learning. The most important thing you need to remember while learning any foreign language is you learn and apply with confidence (maintain your morale), determination (keep up with your good fight against all odds), and patience (control yourself even during a difficult time). Learn to make mistakes; you can’t improve yourself without making mistakes first. Practice frequently with full consistency and you will overcome any obstacles, large or small, in life, hence making you better in using another language while practicing, whether you are at home, work, or traveling. Don’t worry if you are a slow learner; everyone learns in different speed and style and learning a new language takes time. Also, always manage to use your native language and second language(s) equally in respect to your schedule so you will retain you native language and second language(s) easily.<br>  <br>  You can learn as many languages as you need. The sky is the limit! The more languages you learn, the better you can communicate with others, particularly in international traveling and employment. (In other words, “The more, the merrier!”) If you can handle this, do it; otherwise, learn one language at a time until you are ready for the next one.<br>  <br>  Most importantly, you must be proficient in reading, writing, speaking, and listening in each language to be considered as fluent. If you are not proficient in at least one of the four categories of a particular language, then you are not fluent in the particular language, even though you can only speak another language without flaws. Imagine you are lost and you try to find a place to stay in Russia. The address you have is in English but the street names are in Russian. It is really horrendous when you can’t read Russian, especially when you are stranded in the middle of the frigid, winter night (brrrr!). So, therefore, learn to read and write just as you learn to speak and listen, even if it is difficult. Also, be sure to master every aspect of the language you are learning, including pronunciation, grammar, vocabulary, and expression. Just don’t make the same mistake more than once and you will do fine later in life. <br>  <br>  Good luck and happy learning!|`|0ffdb9dc23ea4daa66d018dcdabc0a14aa	Italian<br>  I have taken French in college and it was a hard language for me to learn, Spanish was hard for me too.|`|Xtqq71KGaa	latin.  it helps you understand the english language, and i love learning about words.|`|v7O1Vzpsaa	Spanish and Italian...

Thus, in interpreting your dreams, it is important to draw from your personal life and experiences. <br>  <br>  Remember that a dream unifies the body, mind, and spirit.

So stay awhile -- explore, discover, have fun, make friends, and find out what's in your dream!

ca0a1a2d0e81935238801f7182de2553aa	I agree with you.  If someone had said the N word to him they would not have been given a second chance, they would have been fired on the spot - apology or not.

You should ask family members and friends first THEN log on and ask. :)|`|AA10394986	nope...the computer is basically my hobby...well i read books alot...but mostly go out, do this, watch tv and sleep<br>  <br>  <3|`|c478f056cb88e6ce86dc4fca2726b493aa	i work on a comp and spend my down time in here...i play guitar and go to the gym and work on cars for fun|`|115a09b8c3fc25cb29b8f5e3d2aa87c0aa	i draw and paint|`|ShNbgDWmaa	softball with my kids

gGZz2EGyaa	Oh yes I like the Animals singing The house of the rising sun.  It was a great record, when I first heard it I was surprised how long it was but after a few times it grows on you and is one of the 60's greatest hits.<br>  I believe that Eric Burden and one of the other members of the Animals was/or still is in dispute about royalties and who wrote it.  Eric Burden was interviewed on the tv not so long ago and I just caught the last part of the interview, so I do not know if the dispute has been sorted out after all these years.<br>  Still a great record though and thanks for sharing with us.|`|j6RbKNmjaa	Yep a classic 60s song |`|wmBK9uASaa	Yes good song but I prefer the version by "Frigid Pink"... |`|qWqg7vFJaa	Yet another one that has stood the test of time Paul.<br>  Yes I do ..|`|ClCQIjZHaa	Of course that's what you call music not like the screaming and shouting they do these days|`|aKhZNd7daa	Yep and it's always guaranteed to get people singing Paul !!|`|538c1fe1a2e40d8a0eeb8046985ef01eaa	Yes.<br>  It is the still there, it got its name because it was the brothel where Fathers took their sons!<br>  If you listen to the song that is what it is about.|`|KhFeTlU6aa	yeah i love  60s music!  its interesting they had a music video for that song considering MTV and the concept of music videos did not begin until 1980.|`|5cf10b9f247ea700ce15c2a77c990d36aa	Great tune.<br>  I got it on vinyl and still play it , and was lucky enough to see Eric Burden and the Animals at The Twisted Wheel in Manchester twice!!<br>  Happy days!|`|3qa3BftUaa	Yes.

But also there used to be Heckel and Jeckel that were supposed to be magpies even though they look more like crows to me. There were quite a few cartoons with them and they had the crazy dancing hats on often. Just a thought...

77c7d8e69108b17cfefc8be8745ac142aa	Onkel Dagobert – Sein Leben, seine Milliarden (The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck) ist ein Comic des Comicautors und -zeichners Don Rosa. In zw?lf Hauptkapiteln auf 212 Seiten wird die umfangreiche Lebensgeschichte des Fantastilliard?rs Dagobert Duck in den Jahren 1867 bis 1947 beschrieben.<br>  <br>  Der d?nische Egmont-Verlag beauftragte Rosa im Jahr 1991, Ordnung in Ducks Leben zu bringen und die Geschichte, wie aus dem letzten m?nnlichen Nachfahren der verarmten schottischen McDucks der reichste Mann der Welt wurde, aufzuzeigen.<br>  <br>  Die Comics des Zeichners Carl Barks, der Dagobert Duck 1947 erfunden hatte, dienten als Grundlage für Dagoberts Lebensgeschichte. Don Rosa durchsuchte sie gründlich auf Hinweise über Dagoberts Vergangenheit. Selbst kleine Randbemerkungen bei Barks wurden so in Sein Leben, seine Milliarden eingearbeitet. Das erste Zusammentreffen von Donald Duck und Dagobert Duck seit Donalds Kindheit, das Carl Barks 1947 beim ersten Auftritt von Dagobert schilderte, bildet den Abschluss des Hauptwerkes.<br>  <br>  Für sein Werk, das als sein magnum opus gilt, erhielt Don Rosa im Jahr 1995 den Eisner Award.<br>  <br>  Don Rosa fertigte in den folgenden Jahren weitere Zusatzkapitel an, die einzelne Erlebnisse in der Jugend Dagoberts ausführlicher erz?hlen.<br>  <br>  Die deutsche Erstver?ffentlichung der zw?lf Hauptkapitel erfolgte 1993 bis 1995 in Fortsetzungen in der Micky Maus, gefolgt von einem Nachdruck in sechs Alben. 2003 folgte eine Neuausgabe in einem Band, der au?erdem sechs Zusatzkapitel, ausführliche Vorworte von Don Rosa zu jedem Kapitel sowie eine um drei Seiten erweiterte Fassung des letzten Kapitels enth?lt. Von diesem Band erschien auch eine limitierte signierte Ausgabe (999 Exemplare) als Hardcover, die aufgrund von weit über 1000 Vorbestellungen bei Erscheinen bereits vergriffen war. Mittlerweile werden Exemplare dieser signierten Ausgabe für enorm hohe Preise bei Ebay und auf Tauschb?rsen gehandelt (bis zu 180 €). Irgendwann werden jedoch alle 999 Alben einen Liebhaber gefunden haben und ganz vom Markt verschwunden sein. Zudem gibt es noch 99 sogenannte Künstlerexemplare mit einer K-Nummer. Diese waren nicht für den Verkauf bestimmt, jedoch haben schon ein oder zwei Exemplare auch hier den Weg zu Ebay gefunden, was von Fans scharf kritisiert wurde.|`|8594c2f53657f257662e12a69a2e0c85aa	die entenhausen story.|`|7d4fe63dbec37190de229b9fb91c60b5aa	Hallo Corto Maletese,<br>  <br>  das Buch über Dagobert und seine Phantastrillionen müsste eigentlich "Ich, Dagobert Duck" hei?en...<br>  <br>  Unvergessen die Geschichte, als Dagobert seinen Geldspeicher (mit Hilfe der Panzerknacker) v?llig leert und alles Geld in einem idyllischen See versenkt....<br>  <br>  Aber das Baden im Geld fehlt der reichsten Ente der Erde einfach, also wird eine Geldinsel hochgebaggert und da wird Dagobert just von einem Panzerknacker entdeckt, der in dem See angeln m?chte...<br>  <br>  Ach ja...

fE83WcSiaa	I suppose if you analyse this properly you would have to come up with a variety of answers that reflect the meaning of the title.<br>  <br>  One would be that a long distance in it's essence is someone that spends the majority of their time alone, when training and competing. Training involves many hours a week, by yourself, struggling with the determination to keep going to reach your goals. One of the obstacles you have to overcome to do this, is being able to motivate yourself alone, with no incouragement from anyone but yourself.<br>  Hence, the loneliness of the long distance runner.<br>  <br>  The second would be if you apply the title to the character of the film.<br>  He is a criminal that is sent to a facility with others alike. There he is the same with the same sort of background. Once he is noticed as a talented runner he becomes sort after by the guy in charge. After a period of time where he has to train and compete he becomes an outcast by the people who he has to live and work with, because of the treatment he receives by the man in charge for being talented and competing when he has to.<br>  This makes him a lonely person who has no one to turn to but himself.<br>  hence, the loneliness of the long distance runner.<br>  <br>  I'm sure other people have different ideas that are just as accurate, but I feel the personally, the above does well to describe the meaning behind the title.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|pivFuuAVaa	its a book about , an impoverished Nottingham teenager  who has few prospects in life and enjoys few pursuits beyond committing petty crimes. His home life is dismal as well. Caught for robbing a bakery, Colin is confined in a borstal, or prison for delinquent youth.

ymF54ElWaa	lol|`|wYrLN0Fvaa	i dont get it, r u tryin 2 say that god exist?|`|L1rMeIIpaa	The existence of god(s) is relative on how  do you conceive him.<br>  I, for instance conceive god as something is put inside of you, is the thing makes you feel well or bad when you do good or evil. In other words, is the coscience, (which does not exist in animals)   |`|QB8rPK15aa	No God does not exist. Jeeez.. Why do people have to believe that NOTHING created NOTHING.<br>  If God is not a physical thing, yet you believe he made physical things...why can't you believe that these things created themselves? At least science can prove something...all you have for God are some words in a book that is clearly just full of stories that are supposed to make you feel good about yourself..which isnt all that bad, unless you go living by everything and preaching it.<br>  <br>  |`|mIO4q7Nsaa	haha how amusing.  I guess that settles it, huh?<br>  <br>  So who created your god?  Was it...people like you?|`|DyliE5vEaa	lol that's quite good|`|pU0VPMy8aa	we cannot prove god i real but people believe in god.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081108192753AACAqWv">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|z6yP8zI8aa	he hasnt helped me |`|mdjhIeN7aa	haha good one|`|ofeFfLSSaa	God created us and everything around us. God is with us always. Man cannot do the things God does.|`|31cf2a3995a7e000ff27474f546fb219aa	i personally don't believe in god but i can't prove his existence or nonexistence. make your own call|`|f1G05i8Kaa	**Hmmm when you put it like that maybe he does exist.**|`|zI6cZoAWaa	allah exist|`|HmQzOLv6aa	LMAO<br>  Of course God exist, if not why are we here?|`|wIBni2isaa	bahahahhahaha funny|`|peDJSnQPaa	he might he might not thats what keeps me goin..|`|Ho15Akgwaa	Part of the strangest song i have heard: God made the world,<br>   world made man, <br>  man saved the world,<br>   world saved god.....<br>  <br>  <br>  O_________________O<br>  <br>  Hey, If you ever watch a series of shows Called Supernatural on the CW station, it is now that Dean Winchester came to life by Angels sent from God....<br>  <br>  So it would be strange if Dean went against the angels, went to hell, got to meet Lucifer, Lucifer gave him demon powers, and went against god...|`|H1MMcsqaaa	God is all that is. We are every bit a part of god as anything else, so we really can not become equal with god, just be part of god, which is why making the most of our lives and doing right things to improve life as a whole is important to god. <br>  <br>  We can always deny our being part of god, which is illogical, but choosing to live as though we are not part of god (everything) then we may be able to think we are our own god and do as we may. It really just eliminates our purpose. <br>  <br>  So, asking if god exists is really a question of if you exist, and if you are certain you exist, regardless of if you think others do, then you are certain that god exists as well, and regardless of how we came into existing (creationism or evolution) God had part in it and is the result of it all the same.|`|uBLICbyWaa	HA!<br>  That is so funny!<br>  I am going to tell all my friends!<br>  lol<br>  :)|`|VsETaNHIaa	no god. <br>  |`|cuVIWtxUaa	haha thats cute.<br>  <br>  but i think its more of a commentary on the nature and ego of man, not on whether god exists.|`|6fc235c7c8f97970921b44ab3c3ede90aa	Funny joke - but I wouldn't NOT believe In God because of that- hahahaha - but atleast funnier than the 'evolution theory'. Everyone heard of Darwanism? the  guy that made that theory - his theory was about believing we came from apes etc - apparently when he died he admiitted that HE did not believe in his theory! Anyway - <br>  <br>  I would have to be dumb to believe something 'accidentally evolved'. (ok, yes some things evolve naturally - like ageing, dust accumulation when you don't clean, Wrinkles when you sunbath like a desert lizard etc etc!<br>  <br>  Understand this theory - things don't happen from doing "nothing". Who changed your nappy when you were a baby? who brushes your teeth? Who made your science project? <br>  <br>  WHO did your homework? and if you didn't - the consequence would be that it never got done(nothing) - and Mary Poppins aint real and won't save the day for you. <br>  <br>  Just like we as humans have been given the ability to design, invent;create - God has all power to do these things and more... he has passed on intelligence to us to use - fortunately and unfortunately - at our own free will. Just my opinion - that's all folks. oh oh and...<br>  <br>  Anyone ever had a teacher that taught you something THEN you became even better than them at what he/she taught you? well no, you cant be better at something than God - other than being bad! A human teacher is different to God - a HUMAN did NOT design you.hehe. ok, yada yada yada |`|1e51b16d7d9f60b9d7a98d3743ca4d06aa	God obviously exists; men like to borrow what belongs to him. <br>  <br>  And uh, if you ever feel like editing your question, it's "Does God Exist?"

ooPI3gpyaa	Mein Mitbewohner hat bei der aktuellen DSDS-Staffel mitgemacht, nur aus Spa? und Interesse. <br>  <br>  Die erste Auswahlrunde wird garnicht im Fernsehen gezeigt, da ist er weiter gekommen und in den ersten Folgen, die im Fernsehen gezeigt werden (Vorrunde) hat er dann somit mitgemacht. <br>  Er musste zweimal eine Treppe runtergehen und ist dabei gefilmt worden, dann musste er noch ein bisschen was aus seinem Leben erz?hlen und dann hat er vor Bohlen und Co. gesungen und Gitarre gespielt. Bohlen hat dann zu ihm gesagt, dass er unmusikalischer ist als Heino's Perrücke, obwohl mein Mitbewohner sogar schon einen Plattenvertrag bei einer kleinen Agentur hat und wirklich nicht schlecht singt. <br>  <br>  Wir sind dann Abends in der Kneipe gesessen und haben uns über die ganze Sache kaputt gelacht, er hat es zum Glück garnicht ernst genommen und hat es auch einem Freund empfohlen, der auch in einer Band spielt, weil er meinte, dass es einfach total witzig ist und man die durchgeknalltesten Leute kennen lernt.

Das passierte so im Frühling.<br>  September hat man sie dann angerufen, dass sie für das Casting ausgew?hlt wurde(in Offenbach). Sie musste 1 1/2 Stunden mit dem Zug fahren. Das Casting begann morgens. Sie hat nicht vor Dieter und so gesungen, sondern vor irgendwelchen anderen Leuten. Die haben auch net sofort gesagt ob sie jetzt weiter ist oder net. Die ganzen Kandidaten mussten bis sp?t abends warten bis die dann gesagt haben wer nun weiterkommt. Meine Freundin ist nicht weitergekommen, obwohl sie voll geil singen kann und auch in einem Gospel-Chor singt. Es sind nur so voll die Witzfiguren weitergekommen und so 'ne Blonde mit Beinen so lang wie sonst was und Doppel-D.<br>  DSDS ist voll die Verarschung. Sie hat einen ganzen Tag umsonst verloren und hatte auch noch Stre? mit ihrer Mutter, da sie nicht zur Schule gegangen ist.

Ciascuna fascia presenta un'ora di differenza rispetto a quella immediatamente vicina. Per esempio, quando sono le 10 a Washington D.C. (che è nella Eastern Time), sono le 7 a San Francisco (che è nella Pacific Time). Alaska e Hawaii hano due ore di ritardo rispetto alla Pacific Time.  Nella prima pagina della guida del telefono si trova sempre una mappa delle zone e delle fasce orarie.<br>  <br>      Rispetto all'Italia, la Eastern Time è sei ore indietro, mentre la Pacific Time è di ben 9 ore in ritardo. Ciò significa che se in Italia sono le 12 (mezzogiorno), a New York sono le 6 di mattina e a Los Angeles sono le 3 di notte.<br>  <br>      Anche negli Stati Uniti esiste l'ora legale (chiamata Daylight Saving Time, cioè orario del risparmio diurno). Essa prevede lo spostamento indietro di un'ora dall'ultima domenica di aprile all'ultima domenica di ottobre. Fanno eccezione a questa regola gli Stati dell'Arizona, Hawaii e Indiana.<br>  <br>      Negli Stati Uniti vige la regola anglosassone per indicare l'ora, pertanto le ore dalle 0.00 alle 12.00 vengono indicate con la sigla a.m. (ante meridiem = prima di mezzogiorno), mentre quelle dalle 12.00 alle 24.00 con p.m. (post meridiem = dopo mezzogiorno). Pertanto, le quattro di pomeriggio (per noi le 16) saranno indicate con le 4 p.m.   Può sembrare ridicolo, ma spesso accadono confusioni, soprattutto negli appuntamenti e negli orari di aerei e treni. Un po' di attenzione eviterà imbarazzanti situazioni.|`|KKA1Qf6Waa	Io ci sono stato negli States.

Non ho antipatie o idionsincrasie nei confronti dei Blink, ma devo proprio dirlo: per varie ragioni (ovviamente cronologiche e di genere, ma anche di stile, di levatura, di impatto sociale) i Nirvana appartengono proprio ad un altro universo... Comunque, a parte questa precisazione un po' saccente ma necessaria (qui si toccano i mostri sacri!!), non mi risulta che ci sia una cover con la caratteristica di cui parli: ma stai parlando di questa raccolta di brani dei Nirvana rivisitati in chiave new-age per fungere da ninnananne (guarda al link sotto)?  A parte tutto, credo che se mai dovessero esserci episodi del genere, quello dei Blink sarebbe sicuramente una forma di tributo: non si può copiare una delle più importanti band della storia della musica, ci si ispira e basta!

Ese pato es para el su mejor amigo, como un hermano, daría su vida por él, pero llega a embarcar y le dice la muchacha:<br>  <br>  - Lo siento, pero el pato no puede ir con usted en el avión.<br>  <br>  - Pero como que no! Si es Pepe! Le he comprado la plaza y todo! No me puede hacer esto.<br>  <br>  - Lo siento de verdad, pero el pato no puede ir con usted.<br>  <br>  - Y podría ir por fuera del avión al lado de mi ventanilla?<br>  <br>  - Por supuesto, fuera del avión puede hacer lo que usted quiera.<br>  <br>  Y ya despega el avión y el pato al lado de la ventanilla, pero llevan ya una hora y el pato se empieza a cansar y se queda un poco atrás, y el hombre nerviosísimo le dice al piloto:<br>  <br>  - Se?or frene un poco el avión que mi pato se queda atrás!!<br>  <br>  El piloto frena un poco y dice:<br>  <br>  - Se?ores pasajeros, griten Pepe para darle animos al pato y que pueda llegar con nosotros.<br>  <br>  En esto que empiezan todos  "Peeeeepeeee, Peeeeeeeeeepeeeeeeeee" y Pepe más cerca del avión. "PEEPEEE, PEEEPEEE" y Pepe casi llega . "PEEEEPEEE!!!!!, PEEEPEEEEEE!!!" y Pepe está llegando cuando de repente algo se lo lleva... y sabes que era??<br>  <br>  UN LADRILLO BOTANDO!!<br>  <br>  Espero que te guste, pero ten en cuenta que hablado tiene más gracia que contado jejejej<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Aquí va otro:<br>  <br>  Está un tío dando tumbos por la calle después de salir del bar y le entran ganas de mear justo cuando pasa por la puerta de un convento. Se acerca a unas florecillas que había en la puerta del convento para mear, se abre la bragueta y cuando empieza llega una monja con una cara de inocente que no puede con ella y le dice:<br>  <br>  - Ay Dios mío! Qué es eso que le cuelga por ahí?<br>  <br>  Y el hombre:<br>  - Pués se?ora, esto es... eso que tenemos los hombres... para mear... ya sabe no?<br>  <br>  - Aaaaahhhh!! Anda que gracioso!!! y tiene una bolita al lado!!! Me dejaría usted tocarla?<br>  <br>  - Se?ooooraaa... es que... a ver...<br>  <br>  - Anda por favor, que yo nunca he tocado eso y me haría mucha ilusión...<br>  <br>  - Bueeeeno, pero solo un poquito, no se emocione demasiado.<br>  <br>  - Ay gracias! Que Dios se lo pague!!<br>  <br>  Está la monjita tocándole cuando se da cuenta de que hay otra bolita igual:<br>  <br>  - Ui mira! Si hay otra al lado!!! Me dejaría usted tocarla también?<br>  <br>  - Se?ora es que ya esta tocando una... y es un poco incómodo la verdad...<br>  <br>  - Por favor se?or, que yo ya mismo me voy a morir y me voy a ir sin haber tocado nunca las dos... por favor...<br>  <br>  - Bueeeeeeeeeeeeeenooooooo, está bien...<br>  <br>  Y la monja le coge el otro y con toda su mala leche empieza a machacarlos diciendo:<br>  <br>  - NO SE MEA EN LAS MARGARITAS!!!<br>  <br>  jajajjaj este queda muy bien si lo haces con mímica!!! jajajajjaj<br>  <br>  Feliz Navidad!!

CvgZdsADaa	My Dad was born on the same day, technically under Scorpio yet he acts a lot like a Sagittarius too sometimes. Too often to not be a complete Scorpio. And no, he does not have any other Sagittarius influence. The closest to it is his Aries moon sign which is a Fire sign yet that is about it. If he was born a few hours later he would have been born under Sagittarius.<br>  <br>  Regardless, him, like myself and your crush, were born under cusps. We are influenced by two signs. That doesn't mean we were born under both but are influenced and shape by them both. Physically I have several Capricorn traits and other Aquarius traits. That makes sense since I was born under the Capricorn/Aquarius cusp. As you could guess me and my Dad get along great. All cusps get along. We get along as well with all other signs but sometimes that other influence causes a clash between signs we are suppose to get along with.<br>  <br>  Either ways, check his moon sign, rising sun sign and other signs like Venus and Mercury. Those matter a whole lot too. Just a few days ago I noticed the great importance of my Ascendant sign. I get along with two of my friends who other than by our rising sign we are not compatible. Yet it works. So check those signs and try to make sense out of them.|`|b57985650358c60befec84eaa1edddb5aa	i believe in astrology, <br>  <br>  but i dont think that crushing on a guy, and just because he might not be a certain sign, doesnt mean you shouldnt like him..<br>  <br>  Anyway, i have no idea.. but i think hes a scorpio too..|`|8r46d89Vaa	What year?

Now, let me tell u a little about them, cus im one, i should know!!!

liIqiHJbaa	El hubiera sido el nuevo due?o y se hubieran llamado "cartas Syaoran" (pero no creo que la espada cambiara ya que esta le pertenece, pues con saku cambia porque el baculo no es suyo al principio) así como el libro hubiera cambiado su apariencia,(lo que me hubiera gustado saber es el escudo de detrás de las cartas) pero también mi Syaoran se hubiera vuelto más orgulloso, cada vez que atrapaba uno (al principio) se ponia más arrogante, pero mi linda Sakurita le quito eso con su encanto (aaaaaaaa... kawai) y ahora que me pongo a pensar, si los hubiera conseguido se hubiera regresado a Hong Kong y Eriol hiba a perseguirlo a él, pero la verdad no se hiba a ver muy bien que otro chico acosara a otro, no? Yue y Kerberos hiban a pertenecerle también y pelearían a cada rato, no se hubiera quedado más y de lejitos no se hubiera dado cuenta del amor que sentia por Sakura, fue por eso que me encantó la 3° temporada por que los celos de Syaoran hacen que se comporte más lindo, tierno, dulce y todo lo que vemos en la historia con Sakura aaaaaaaaaaa..., perdón pero cada vez que hablo de Sakurita me pongo romántica y nostalgica, cierto!!! tampoco hubieran salido los vestidos que le hizo Tomoyo a Sakura para cuando ella fuera transformando las cartas Clow a Sakura, y Tomoyo hubiera estado muy triste (snif) pero como es ella encontraría una manera distinta para continuar grabandola con los trajes, y lo peor de todo!! Syaoran no se le hubiera declarado y no hubieran terminado juntos!! (WAAAAA!!) a lo mismo con Touya ya que Yukito se hubiera ido a Hong Kong para estar con su nuevo due?o, por que Yue debe estar junto a él y también Sakura se hubiera deprimido mucho por la ida de ambos, no!!! que terrible, la verdad es que me encantó la forma en que las CLAMP hicieron su historia, así como está me encanta, la verdad, yo solo cambiaría una cosita, que hubiera habido un beso en el anime o minimo un abrazo, por que en "La carta sellada" solo se ve que se avienta Sakura y que Syaoran la va a atrapar pero ahí la dejan, buuuua!!! bueno ni modo, eso es lo que yo me imaginaría si Syaoran hubiera sido el due?o de las cartas Clow.<br>  <br>  Sayounara!!<br>  <br>  Syaoran te amo!!

834e49d3bae86765bd01b3e28aa519dbaa	Well, first of all, the Joker wasn't named Jack Napier in the comics...  that came from the first Batman movie when they try to say the Joker had killed Bruce Wayne's parents (instead of Joe Chill)...<br>  The Joker started off as a criminal named the Red Hood (Jason Todd has recently taken that name) and he was robbing a card factory when Batman stopped him-- he dove into the chemicals to escape and they bleached his skin white, turned his hair green and his lips bright red.  This snapped his already fragile mind and he was inspired by his new resemblance to a joker card and became the clown prince of crime...<br>  In retro-histories, they have altered this slightly, but this all basically remains true...|`|SEOyrSG7aa	Hotly debated. Some say Napier isn't the Joker at all, that it was a nameless dude.<br>  <br>  In The Killing Joke, the joker "remembers" that he was a failing  comic with a pregnant wife who was gonna help a couple guys rob a chemical factory. They killed his wife when he tried to back out, and was knocked into a chemical pool when the cops showed up.<br>  <br>  But, he also says that he remembers becoming the Joker differently each time he thinks about it... some things just are.|`|YMuSSLhGaa	I'm afraid that there's not a real answer. The closest thing we have to a real origin is what was told in "The killing joke" as was already stated, but then again, the Joker himself admits he always remember his origin in a different way.
BdRQA6Emaa	I'm Virgo as well (but I don't match the description at all), I have one very close Cancer friend I fight a lot with too, but when I think about which star sign has the most people I don't get along with I'd say Leo, Capricorn, Pisces, and Virgo.

JYDIYVozaa	1) It has to be popular<br>  2) It has to attract enough sponsors to finance the animation project<br>  3) It has to have great 'readers' share' when it is still in manga<br>  4) There is animation studio and enough workforce available to produce the project<br>  ... among other (financing) factors.<br>  <br>  It won't matter if you really like 'Me & My Brothers' since one single opinion won't weigh much.  If by chance half of the population loves the manga, there is a good chance that that manga will be televised.|`|3N2ElzcQaa	I do think Me & My Brothers do deserve to be an anime. An OVA or 13 full length would suffice enough for the anime.<br>  <br>  To make it an anime, it has to be very popular in Japan, how well its sold in stores, and how everyone loves it. |`|AinUCq4Iaa	The Books have to sell exceptionally well, or anime companies have to take intrest in it for some other reason.<br>  9 Volumes isnt much, especially because some go on for 30,40 and even 50 volumes. <br>  If "Me & My brothers" is meant for the shojo demographic, it will have to get Very popular before becoming an anime. Shojo tends not to be picked up as much as shonen. |`|KmkUBGaXaa	Anime companies (i.e. adv films, funimation etc.) contact manga companies (i.e. viz media, tokyo pop etc.) about their most popular manga to see if they can turn it into an anime. the manga companies contact the artist(s) that make said manga to get permission (if they don't already have it) to make an anime version. the manga company sells (some of) the rights to the anime complany and the anime company makes the anime.<br>  *phew!*<br>  hope that helps!

Aunq hay partes muy chistosas con el perbertido d Roshi y las caras d monstruo q pone Bulma pero de resto... nahhhhh no se compara<br>  <br>  Pero hay q tener en cuenta q con la experiencia se fue mejorando y es por eso q dragon ball Z es tan bueno y es el mejor d todos los dragon balls incluso q el GT.<br>  <br>  Bueno eso es todo<br>  Mucha suerte|`|pOSaC1UMaa	pues la verdad asi que tu digas que es super genial nop pero es muy divertido tiene gran aventura y todo ese mundo que creo toriyama es muy bueno ademas de que los villanos no eran superdestructores si no que querian lo clasico conquistar el mundo<br>  mmmmmm pero es una lastima que en CN hayan censurado mucho de la serie casi ni parece dragon ball casi casi se parece al de espa?a con todos los cortes que hicieron le quitaron el toque chusco de roshi y ahora solo quedaron las peleas que no son malas pero tampoco toda la serie es de eso no?tambien deben de dehar el toque chusco<br>  mmmmm en lo personal me gusta mucho dragon ball haya partes que no (como ahorita que estan pasando la villa pingüino) pero con los cortes o me gusta <br>  je saludos|`|ITSSUanAaa	Si pero no mucho, habia unas sagas muy interesantes, como la del primer torneo.

82UJ3vlpaa	Es muy buena tu intención, pero esa información es uno de los tantos HOAX que corren por la red. <br>  <br>  Aqui te dejo la información:<br>  En realidad, surgió (en una versión diferente a la actual), en los ochenta, aunque las causas parecen remontarse a 1977, donde un artículo de una publicación semanal de Illinois, EE.UU, informaba de que en Europa se planeaba rodar una película pornográfica sobre Jesús.<br>  <br>  La revista no tenía nada que ver con el proyecto, sin embargo recibió muchas cartas de protesta e incluso denuncias, que solo significaron pérdida de tiempo, y tal vez, más publicidad de la que se quería evitar. Finalmente, la propia revista informó que el proyecto de la película estaba cancelado.<br>  <br>  A raíz de esa historia, en 1980, comenzó a propagarse a través de panfletos fotocopiados, la versión en la que se basa el HOAX actual. En esas hojas (las que se pedía firmar y enviar por correo, también fotocopiadas, a otras personas), se mencionaba que la película se estaba por filmar en el propio Illinois. Hasta el procurador general de ese estado recibió decenas de miles de cartas encolerizadas por la historia, la que claro, no era verdad.<br>  <br>  Fueron muchas personas e instituciones las que protestaron por el tema, y hasta el evangelista Jimmy Swaggart llegó a emitir un encolerizado sermón por la blasfemia. Lo único que se logró, es que otras personas, menos escrupulosas, pensaran que hacer alguna obra de teatro o incluso una película, podría ser una mina de oro, ante tanta publicidad gratuita.<br>  <br>  De hecho, existen antecedentes de este tipo de historia. En 1988, la película de Martin Scorsese, ?La Ultima Tentación de Cristo?, causó un gran revuelo por la forma de tratar la vida de Jesús. Esta polémica aún persiste en nuestros días. Un poco más recientemente, una obra de teatro, ?Corpus Christi?, también generó controversia, al presentar a un personaje homosexual, cuya vida es un paralelo a la de Jesús, con la traición de Judas y la crucifixión incluidas. La publicidad gratuita, llegó con las protestas de grupos cristianos y personas ofendidas.<br>  <br>  El HOAX actual, en su versión electrónica, es casi una copia de aquél fotocopiado, solo que se transmite a través del correo electrónico, y las firmas solo ponen al alcance de otros inescrupulosos, las direcciones de correo electrónico apetecidas por tantos ‘spammers’ que se aprovechan de esto para el envío de su correo basura (SPAM).|`|qhg9AEGbaa	Jajajaja_ Ahora entiendo por que la pusiste en este foro.... esta bien cajeta tu peticion... no firmo nada.|`|00PYpi7Laa	como la gente puede hacer casos a cosas tan absurdas xD<br>  yo solo respondi x los puntos|`|cQCpfaBGaa	Me quede esperando el chiste<br>  <br>  Saludos|`|cd0d98a509d556360adc2acc7ff385dfaa	pos yo si te apoyo, porque los que dicen que no es cierto , que acaso no se acuerdan de la pelicula  "la ultima tentacion de cristo", y ahi filmaron donde dice que jesucristo tuvo relaciones con la magdalena, y si es cierto la obra de teatro ya se presento en N:Y: y esta hecha por gente no catolica ni cristiana, son ateos que solo ven el billete que pueda resurgir de este filme, la pelicula de que les hable arriba , no se proyecto en muchisimos paises, por la peticion que se hizo por internet, donde millones de correos se mandaron para evitar la proyeccion de esa pelicula aberrante ,,,digo,,,|`|naUxp9SWaa	la verdad, que es de esta forma como el moustro de espageti volador se manifiesta...<br>  <br>  de verdad crees en lo que dice una cadena?<br>  <br>  y si fuera cierto, crees que seria justo negar la libertad de expresión de algun artista que hizo la pelicula<br>  <br>  <br>  la verdad que, como chiste, esta buena tu preocupación|`|0qA3LYngaa	esa cadena lleva anios circulando en internet y la verdad no he sabido nada de que eso sea verdad... pero igual te apoyo =)|`|4MppCKDVaa	presente|`|E04uMhe6aa	Otra vez el demonio metido entre los santos,porque aqui en los chistes ? ca...ra...jo... ! en pleno siglo 21 y todavia existe la santa inquisicion,diablos! diablos!diablos!.porque no nos permiten ver y despues opinar.... porque siempre nos castran y luego nos pregunta,son estas tus bolas ?.|`|VeEcZVpbaa	porque esta esto en "chistes y humor"?

nWWqdzhRaa	existen varios tipos de kriptonita, en la historia de superman, principalmente 5.<br>  1) la clasica que es la verde...que le causa debilidad a superman o a cualquier kriptoniano, y mucho tiempo de exposición puede ocasionar la muerte.<br>  2) la roja que causa efectos impredecibles...como crearle un gemelo a superman...en la serie smallville la roja transforma a superman en un ser sin inhibiciones, dandose gustos y placeres que normalmente no tomaria.<br>  3) La dorada que hace que superman pueda perder los poderees permanentemente.<br>  4) la blanca que es mortal para la vida vegetal de cualquier mundo.<br>  5) azul: es una artificial creada por superman para derrotar a bizarro.<br>  y luego hay otras variedades que aparecieron en los comics...que son como 5 mas.<br>  Kriptonita joya...que aumenta los poderes de los criminales de la zona fantasma.<br>  Kriptonita X creada por superchica en un experimento por buscar antidotos a la kriptonita verde.<br>  Ultra-kriptonita...que es como una especie de kriptonita verde ultrapoderosa...mucho mas veloz y rapida.<br>  Anti-kriptonita que mata a kriptoniano sin poderes.<br>  y La magno kriptonita...que no recuerdo que hace..|`|ebc979e337b1dcb57dc224608390d7f7aa	me acuerdo de la negra, la plateada, que segun quitaban los poderes<br>  <br>  y ana no me acuerdo el color en la caricatura de los superamigos que le salian otros brazos y piernas a superman cuando la tocaba, jajajaja<br>  <br>  <br>  saludos|`|bb8ab7ff43370565dcdc50d75e4fa197aa	Bueno, es un misterio, veras...<br>  ANTES de Crisis en las tierras infinitas existían como Kriptonina NATIVA del planeta, de varios colores, verde, roja, azul, blanca y dorada principalmente.<br>  DESPUES de la CRISIS en las tierras infinitas se supone que solo existía la VERDE ?por que? bueno, deseaban en aquél entonces darle mayor "credibilidad" a la existencia de la que MATA A SUPERMAN, por motivos que se explican en World Of Kriptón, pero no tardaron en crear una primera variante, LA ROJA.<br>  Para cuando aparece MXYZPTLK en la nueva continuidad en un momento Lex Luthor le pide como deseo un trozo de Kriptonita, el duendecillo al no saber que es la kriptonita -salvo por loque le dice Lex- aparece una de color ROJO que, aunado a ser mágica afecta de manera distinta a Superman.<br>  Asi las nuevas kriptonitas que han ido apareciendo en la nueva continuidad -Post  Crisis en las..- son en su gran mayoria imitaciones químicas sin origen kriptoniano.<br>  A saber si han aparecido mas colores pero solo hasta el momento que se sepa existen la verde y roja.<br>  Salu2<br>  ++++++++++++++++++++<br>  1.- La unica persona que fue da?ada por la radiación de la kriptonita es Kenny Braverman, vecino y amigo de Clark, pero más adfelante se transforma en "conducto" FALSO Lex luthor pierde una mano al traer un anillo de kriptonita -el anillo luego lo traeria BATMAN escondido a petición del mismo SUPERMAN-.<br>  2.- La verdad es que Lana estaba super enamorada de Clasrk, pero él solo la veia como su hermana. CIERTO<br>  3.-Lois Lane aparece hasta el punto en que Clark llega a Metropolis. VERDAD A MEDIAS supuestamente Lois hizo un viaje a Smallville cuando éra adolescente, conocío a un editor de la Gazeta de Smallville y de ahí le nació el interes de ser reportera, esto se narra en uncomic POST CRISIS asi que se toma como cierto.<br>  4.- Lex Luthor aparece al igual que Lois, hasta Metropolis. CIERTO<br>  5.- Es cierto que existe el Lex Luthor "Junior", pero es clon de el primero. EL CUAL MURIO PERO EXISTE NO SOLO UN JR. SINO QUE KON-EL EL QUE ?RA EL ACTUAL SUPERBOY TUVO GENES DE LEX LUTHOR<br>  6.- ?Lex con Lana? por favor!!

Hasta que no ocurra esto no podremos asegurar que efecto causa esta Kryptonita sobre los kriptonianos.<br>  Podría ser que cambia la personalidad o la pone más agresiva.<br>  Este tipo de kriptonita a diferencia de la verde no ha tenido mayor explotación a nivel industrial y debido a su color, se utiliza mucho en joyería. (Anillos, collares etc.).<br>  <br>  Kryptonita Negra<br>  <br>  Esta kriptonita liberó a Clark de una personalidad puramente kriptoniana otorgada por Jor-El. ?Qué pasara si es expuesto nuevamente a esta Kryptonita? ?Se volverá a dividir?<br>  Sin embargo puede afectar de la misma manera a humanos, como le sucedió a Lex (Malo y Bueno). Esta clase de kriptonita, es el resultado de las investigaciones en torno a la kriptonita verde; se descubrió en el laboratorio, que este material al ser sometido a una temperatura aproximada de 300 grados Fahrenheit puede transformar su estructura molecular, cambiando sus propiedades químicas; sin embargo debido a los riesgos que presenta el método de transformación, se ha descartado algún uso diferente al de la kriptonita verde.<br>  <br>  Kryptonita Plateada<br>  <br>  Kryptonita ficticia creada por Brainiac para crearle alucinaciones y paranoia a Clark<br>  Era una simple roca de carbón a la cual Brainiac introdujo parte de su cuerpo.<br>  Vale aclarar que Brainiac por si solo podría haberse introducido en Clark, pero todo era parte de un plan de Brainiac para hacerle creer a Clark que él era su amigo ayudándolo con esta variedad de Kryptonita y así ganar su confianza para poder entrar a la Fortaleza de la Soledad y liberar a General Zod<br>  <br>  y para las historietas tenemos muchos mas clases de kriptonita aqui tambien te las dejo....<br>  <br>  Kryptonita Roja:<br>  produce síntomas extra?os e imprevisibles, como cuando divide Superman en gemelos o lo transforma en un nene o en un gigante. La transformación dura 48 horas<br>  <br>  Kryptonita Azul:<br>  Es el antídoto para las demás kriptonitas.<br>  <br>  Kryptonita Blanca:<br>  Solo afecta a la vida vegetal y animal (solo las bacterias).<br>  <br>  Kryptonita Dorada:<br>  Le quita los poderes a superman para siempre, hay una sola en el mundo y solo la tiene él.<br>  <br>  Kryptonita Lenta:<br>  La kriptonita lenta es una modificación de la kriptonita verde. Fue creada por Metalo, esta kriptonita reduce la velocidad de impulsos nerviosos, y los movimientos tanto de los kriptonianos como de los terrestres.<br>  <br>  Kryptonita X:<br>  Concede superpoderes temporales a los terrestres. La kriptonita X, es una variación sintética, fue creada por la Supergirl como una cura potencial paral a exposición a la kriptonita verde.<br>  <br>  Anti Kryptonita:<br>  No tiene efecto sobre los Kriptonianos con superpoderes, pero tiene el mismo efecto que la Kryptonita verde en los nativos de Kripton sin superpoderes, creada para contar los origenes de Supergirl.<br>  <br>  Gema de Kryptonita:<br>  Creada por Jax-Ur. Amplia los poderes de los que viven en la Zona Fantasma, permitiéndoles proyectar ilusiones sobre el mundo real o controlar las mentes.<br>  <br>  Magno-Kryptonita:<br>  Creado por Truff, del planeta Pyron.<br>  <br>  K-Metal:<br>  Un prototipo de Kryptonita de la edad de Jerry Siegel y Joe Shuster llamado "el K-Metal del criptón!". Tiene el mismo efecto de debilitamiento en Kriptonanos que la Kryptonita verde, con el efecto adicional temporalmente de conceder enorme fuerza y posiblemente otras superpotencias a la gente común.<br>  <br>  Kriptonite Falsa:<br>  Creado por Supergirl usando magia en un pedazo de kriptonita, es totalmente inofensiva.<br>  <br>  Kryptonita Sintética:<br>  Versiones sintéticas de Kryptonita verde creadas en laboratorios.<br>  <br>  Kryptonita Plateada:<br>  No es una kriptonita...solo fue una joda de sus amigos para su cumplea?os, creada por Jimmy Olsen<br>  <br>  Kryptonita Amarilla:<br>  Otro tipo de kriptonita ficticia. Fue utilizada por Lex Luthor para realizar una broma pesada.|`|kiR5SYftaa	Si hay otras....<br>  <br>  Tipos de Kryptonita  <br>  Origen de la Kryptonita<br>  <br>  Son fragmentos radioactivos que sobrevivieron del planeta Kriptón, han estado en la Tierra desde hace ya muchísimos a?os. <br>  La primera lluvia de meteoritos que conocemos fue hace más de 500 a?os, dándole origen a los Skinwalker (?si no se destruyó Kriptón, que se habrá destruido?). También pudimos observar que había Kryptonita en Shangai (China) protegiendo uno de los Cristales de la Sabiduría, no hay datos de que haya existido una lluvia de meteoritos, pero se supone que si hay en China, también podríamos encontrar en Honduras y en Egipto, protegiendo los otros Cristales.<br>  La segunda lluvia de meteoritos que conocemos fue la llegada de Kal-El a la Tierra y es ahí donde se hizo mas conocida y donde aparecieron la mayor cantidad de villanos y algunos peque?os héroes.<br>  La tercera lluvia de meteoritos fue la llegada de Brainiac, Nam-Ek y Aethyr. Duplicando la cantidad de Kryptonita y mutaciones en las personas.<br>  <br>  Kryptonita Verde<br>  <br>  Debilita a cualquier kriptoniano y con el tiempo podría llegar a matarlo.<br>  Esta variedad de Kryptonita, es la que más usos tiene a nivel industrial; debido a que en su estado puro se encuentra adherida a otros materiales, se debe proceder a su separación, para purificarla, en este proceso, debe someterse a enormes temperaturas para derretir el cristal sólido y poder volver a solidificarla para diversos usos ( balas, armas químicas, etc), pero también este material puede licuarse para proceder a su utilización a nivel biológico ( potencializadores, armas biológicas) , entre otros.<br>  <br>  Aparición en Smallville: PILOT, 1a Temp.<br>  <br>  <br>  Kryptonita Roja<br>  <br>  Genera sobre Clark una personalidad más rebelde, mostrando su lado negativo y perverso. ?Qué pasara cuando algún villano kriptoniano se exponga a esta variedad de Kryptonita? ?Su personalidad cambiará para bien o para mal? Hasta que no ocurra esto no podremos asegurar que efecto causa esta Kryptonita sobre los kriptonianos.<br>  Podría ser que cambia la personalidad o la pone más agresiva.<br>  Este tipo de kriptonita a diferencia de la verde no ha tenido mayor explotación a nivel industrial y debido a su color, se utiliza mucho en joyería. (Anillos, collares etc.).<br>  <br>  Aparición en Smallville: RED, 2a Temp.<br>  <br>  Kryptonita Negra<br>  <br>  Esta kriptonita liberó a Clark de una personalidad puramente kriptoniana otorgada por Jor-El. ?Qué pasara si es expuesto nuevamente a esta Kryptonita? ?Se volverá a dividir?<br>  Sin embargo puede afectar de la misma manera a humanos, como le sucedió a Lex (Malo y Bueno). Esta clase de kriptonita, es el resultado de las investigaciones en torno a la kriptonita verde; se descubrió en el laboratorio, que este material al ser sometido a una temperatura aproximada de 300 grados Fahrenheit puede transformar su estructura molecular, cambiando sus propiedades químicas; sin embargo debido a los riesgos que presenta el método de transformación, se ha descartado algún uso diferente al de la kriptonita verde.<br>  <br>  Aparición en Smallville: CRUSADE, 4a Temp.<br>  <br>  Kryptonita Plateada<br>  <br>  Kryptonita ficticia creada por Brainiac para crearle alucinaciones y paranoia a Clark<br>  Era una simple roca de carbón a la cual Brainiac introdujo parte de su cuerpo.<br>  Vale aclarar que Brainiac por si solo podría haberse introducido en Clark, pero todo era parte de un plan de Brainiac para hacerle creer a Clark que él era su amigo ayudándolo con esta variedad de Kryptonita y así ganar su confianza para poder entrar a la Fortaleza de la Soledad y liberar a General Zod.<br>  <br>  Aparición en Smallville: SPLINTER, 5a Temp.<br>  <br>  <br>  Kryptonita en los cómics Superman<br>  <br>  Durante la Pre-Crisis había una gran variedad de de Kryptonitas<br>  <br>  Kryptonita Roja:<br>  produce síntomas extra?os e imprevisibles, como cuando divide Superman en gemelos o lo transforma en un nene o en un gigante. La transformación dura 48 horas<br>  <br>  Kryptonita Azul:<br>  Es el antídoto para las demás kriptonitas.<br>  <br>  Kryptonita Blanca:<br>  Solo afecta a la vida vegetal y animal (solo las bacterias).<br>  <br>  Kryptonita Dorada:<br>  Le quita los poderes a superman para siempre, hay una sola en el mundo y solo la tiene él.<br>  <br>  Kryptonita Lenta:<br>  La kriptonita lenta es una modificación de la kriptonita verde. Fue creada por Metalo, esta kriptonita reduce la velocidad de impulsos nerviosos, y los movimientos tanto de los kriptonianos como de los terrestres.<br>  <br>  Kryptonita X:<br>  Concede superpoderes temporales a los terrestres. La kriptonita X, es una variación sintética, fue creada por la Supergirl como una cura potencial paral a exposición a la kriptonita verde.<br>  <br>  Anti Kryptonita:<br>  No tiene efecto sobre los Kriptonianos con superpoderes, pero tiene el mismo efecto que la Kryptonita verde en los nativos de Kripton sin superpoderes, creada para contar los origenes de Supergirl.<br>  <br>  Gema de Kryptonita:<br>  Creada por Jax-Ur. Amplia los poderes de los que viven en la Zona Fantasma, permitiéndoles proyectar ilusiones sobre el mundo real o controlar las mentes.<br>  <br>  Magno-Kryptonita:<br>  Creado por Truff, del planeta Pyron.<br>  <br>  K-Metal:<br>  Un prototipo de Kryptonita de la edad de Jerry Siegel y Joe Shuster llamado "el K-Metal del criptón!". Tiene el mismo efecto de debilitamiento en Kriptonanos que la Kryptonita verde, con el efecto adicional temporalmente de conceder enorme fuerza y posiblemente otras superpotencias a la gente común.<br>  <br>  Kriptonite Falsa:<br>  Creado por Supergirl usando magia en un pedazo de kriptonita, es totalmente inofensiva.<br>  <br>  Kryptonita Sintética:<br>  Versiones sintéticas de Kryptonita verde creadas en laboratorios.<br>  <br>  Kryptonita Plateada:<br>  No es una kriptonita...solo fue una joda de sus amigos para su cumplea?os, creada por Jimmy Olsen<br>  <br>  Kryptonita Amarilla:<br>  Otro tipo de kriptonita ficticia. Fue utilizada por Lex Luthor para realizar una broma pesada.<br>  <br>  Kryptonita-Ma's : No hay información sobre ella|`|liIqiHJbaa	la cosa es que tú estas super basado en smarville, la verdad es que no se ni cuantos existen en esa serie (solo la medio veo por Welling, jejejeje), pero la verdad es que solo existe la verde, única y original, ya que en los verdaderos comics así lo demuestra, me molesta un poco el supercambio de la serie, por ejemplo, hay les van algunos cambios:<br>  <br>  1.- La unica persona que fue da?ada por la radiación de la kriptonita es Kenny Braverman, vecino y amigo de Clark, pero más adfelante se transforma en "conducto"<br>  2.- La verdad es que Lana estaba super enamorada de Clasrk, pero él solo la veia como su hermana.<br>  3.-Lois Lane aparece hasta el punto en que Clark llega a Metropolis<br>  4.- Lex Luthor aparece al igual que Lois, hasta Metropolis.<br>  5.- Es cierto que existe el Lex Luthor "Junior", pero es clon de el primero<br>  6.- ?Lex con Lana? por favor!! Lex perreaba demasiado a Lois (pero jamás lo peló), este nunca llegó a conocer a Lana.<br>  <br>  etc., etc.<br>  <br>  bueno solo es mi opinión, creo que necesitaba sacarme lo que pensaba desde hace rato.<br>  <br>  sayounara!! <br>  <br>  Syaoran te amo!!

La profesora, un poco nerviosa porque no quiere que Pepito salga con una de sus vulgaridades, le prepara cuidadosamente una pregunta: <br>  <br>  "A ver, Pepito, recuerdas la clase de ayer en la que platicamos la historia del Himno Nacional." <br>  <br>  "Claro que me acuerdo profesora." <br>  <br>  "?Recuerdas qué le dijo el Sr. Francisco Gonzalez Bocanegra a su esposa cuando esta le pidió que él escribiera el Himno Nacional?, eso lo comentamos ayer Pepito." <br>  <br>  "Sí profesora... lo tengo en la punta de la lengua..." <br>  <br>  Mientras la profesora esperaba la respuesta, nerviosamente jugaba con un lápiz que acabó por caérsele al suelo. Al inclinarse a recogerlo mostró todos sus lindos atributos físicos. Entonces Pepito continuó... <br>  <br>  "?Ya me acordé! El tipo ese dijo: ?Qué buenas nalgas tienes mamacita!" <br>  <br>  La profesora, molesta por la respuesta, le pide a Pepito que salga del salón. <br>  <br>  Pepito, muy serio, recoge sus cuadernos y libros e indignado voltea hacia el inspector y le dice: <br>  <br>  "?Ya vez pendejo, si no sabes para que soplas!"  <br>  <br>  <br>  Esoss sonn algunos<br>  jjaaj <br>  BYE|`|6dYkk7K2aa	ja ja ja ja|`|9oPykRYFaa	éramos tan, pero tan pobres, que teníamos que esperar a que un rico se tirase un<br>  pedo para oler comida caliente.<br>  <br>  En el manicomio:<br>  -?Y tú por qué no trabajas?.<br>  -Porque estoy loco.<br>  -Sí, pero otros locos trabajan...<br>  -Ya, pero yo no lo estoy tanto.<br>  <br>  -Se pintan casas a domicilio.<br>  -Se vende hielo, bien fresquito.<br>  -Vendo maquina de escribir que le falta una tecla.<br>  -Cambio condón roto por ropa de bebé.<br>  -Chico tímido busca... eh.. bueno... esto... nada, no busca nada.<br>  <br>  Primer acto: un pavo con una pistola de rayos laser.<br>  Segundo acto: un pavo con una pistola.<br>  Tercer acto: un pavo con una espada.<br>  ?Como se llama la obra?.<br>  Los pavos rangers<br>  <br>  Un ni?o de 9 a?os vuelve a casa antes de lo previsto al haber acabado las clases antes. <br>  Al entrar, ve a su madre con un hombre que no conoce desnudos en la cama, y al darse cuenta que no se han percatado de su presencia, se esconde en el armario para observar lo que hacen. <br>  En esto que el marido de la mujer llega también antes de hora, y la mujer mete a toda prisa a su amante en el armario también, sin darse cuenta que dentro estaba su hijo. <br>  El ni?o dice, "Esta muy oscuro aquí dentro." <br>  El hombre contesta sorprendido, "Si, así es." <br>  Ni?o: "Tengo un balón de fútbol." <br>  Hombre: "Ah, muy bien." <br>  Ni?o: "?Quieres comprarlo?" <br>  Hombre: "No, gracias." <br>  Ni?o: "Mi padre esta ahí fuera."  <br>  Hombre: "De acuerdo, ?cuanto pides por el?" <br>  Ni?o: "5000 pesos" <br>  Hombre: "Un poco caro, pero de acuerdo."

WzHUW50baa	yeah, but hey.<br>  life is good, why are you worrying about this?<br>  there's definitely bigger issues in the world than the average wait in the Wal-Mart line.|`|iuWfp2fEaa	Oh yeah, customer service is almost nonexistent at the local Walmarts in my area. I wanted to buy a television at Walmart a few months ago, but i couldn't get anybody to wait on me, and I got so frustrated that I ended up walking out, and they lost a 150 dollar sale!|`|uz0n8fRIaa	I avoid Wal-Mart as much as humanly possible, ESPECIALLY on the weekend!|`|3818167ac154551351613f47dcd24c42aa	yes we have them same problem in north florida and their are always atleast 5 csm's just hanging around up front by the registers i live in a small town and walmart is pretty much the only main choice we have if we had a target or even a k-mart i can assure you alot of people would quit going to walmart. walmart sucks . have you seen their new commercial we now do more at night so we have more people to help you in the day bull crap|`|MJ8GFvnJaa	yes! i know just what you are talking about<br>  <br>  i am in northern kentucky, we have a few walmarts in the area and they are all like that|`|WFwG1kFZaa	wait time here is a half hr. for selfe check out longer at the manned stations. realy annoying when i have my six kids with me.|`|fbPyPQrNaa	go to walgreens!<br>  go to walgreens!<br>  go to walgreens!|`|8ZdHXxi7aa	weal  good,<br>  i don't know  about Wall-mart.|`|DaCyp5UHaa	Not really.<br>  <br>  <br>  Please...<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ArIRPcAhgcgCH1nwpzfE1S_sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20080217233529AAjM3MO">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|NgThVVvraa	i use to work at Walmart. It was crazy, my job was to work in the back and I constantly had to go work registers because a lot of the employees don't want to. I've seen other people actually hide from managers when they went looking for people to run registers. It's unbelieable sad. I felt bad for the customers, then they get pissed at me when something doesn't ring up and it isn't even in my part of my job! But I understand, it is a huge pain.|`|UpKNdLHfaa	Nope . . .|`|Us2UnLHUaa	Yes,  and when I want my industrial sized bag of Cheetos, dammit, I want them now !|`|XcFKa9PLaa	6 registers...where the heck is your wal-mart...we're lucky to have 3 open..and 1 of them is the fast lane..12 items or less...as if..and those self-check thingy's suck..time after time i have to scan several times...a couple of times i went to return an item and the line was like forever and only one person behind the counter..its a cheap store on several accounts|`|lzR29wo4aa	Sounds like they are shorthanded.  I work at a Wal-Mart and the only time we have this problem is after 9 pm if it gets busy.|`|533f2b85d7b4277bd6bb254c5aad00d7aa	haha|`|D71DwxTCaa	That's what attracted me to your question.  I was going to complain about just that.  Wal Mart never has enough cashiers.  There are at least 20 lanes in our store and only 2 or 3 of them are open and everyone is always standing in line.  I don't shop there for that reason alone.  The last time I was there I stood in line for 20 minutes and I just had one item.  I think the store is white trash, a lot of the parents that shop at ours don't watch their kids, there are long wait lines, and the service clerks are usually rude and uneducated.  I usually have a hard time just walking through the store because there is so much s#@% all over the place because they don't have stuff stocked.  I am anti-Wal Mart.|`|kByHbz3xaa	haha.<br>  <br>  Australian.<br>  <br>  Woolworths is the equivilant I am sure.<br>  <br>  and yes it does get kind of annoying waiting in the lines. <br>  <br>  especially when you have the teenage checkout chick and then you have somebody trying to swipe there credit card and they cant get the right way. <br>  <br>  haha<br>  so annoying.<br>  <br>  :)|`|wFzt2jzLaa	okay. I work at Walmart at the Customer service desk, and walmart gets thousands and thousands of people through the doors everyday and when you only have limited cashiers that have to get their breaks thats when the lines come especially on the weekend. If you want to go to walmart go on Wed. All walmarts are different, and if you don't like to wait then I advise you get a job there and be a cashier or go somewhere else, trust me wal-mart wont be hurt without your money.

Bring a pokemon in your party with the tm strength.  Go to the depths of the cave whenever it is not filled with sea water until you find a kartate man.  He will give you an important item.  Move the boulder using strength in the south direction.  Walk along the path in the east direction until there are stairs.  Go down these stairs and you are into the deepest part of the cave.  Snorunt can be found here but you must complete the icy puzzle to get to the area he is at.  Move along the snow squares and onto the icy ones carefully.  Travel to the end of the ice and there is a ledge.  Move back and forth but do not jump off the ledge.  If you keep searching in this small area a snorunt will eventually appear.

rl0Zq1gvaa	Movie studios have to release movies along a certain schedule to meet their own budgets and projected incomes.  Just like you want to get a regular paycheck each month, movie studios want to get a certain amount of money by certain dates.  The two big money-making seasons are the holidays, and the summer.<br>  <br>  Last year's writer's strike was noticed by most people because it immediately affected what TV shows were able to do, but we are just now feeling the effects on the movie industry.  Because there weren't any writers working on scripts during that time, it means the studios won't have movies to distribute as often as they would like.<br>  <br>  "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince" is expected to make Warner Brothers a lot of money, regardless of when it is released.  They've decided to let it fill the gap, to be that paycheck next summer that otherwise they wouldn't have.  They have a handful of other smaller titles that they believe will carry them through the holiday season.|`|9gjEsSVnaa	with The Dark Knight doing exceptional at the box office and seeing their release schedule for next year, they realized they didnt have any big releases next year and only 4 summer movies, so they moved it to next year where it can make much more money than this year.|`|6zdmzdQ2aa	It is NOT because of Twilight.  Twilight moved to Harry Potter's spot after they announced they were pushing it back.  They were behind in editing/finishing the movie, pretty much.  It was all filmed, I believe, it had to be if they waited such a long time to move it back, but they claimed they were still behind from the writer's strike.  I don't really mind, I kind of like that it comes out in summer, they I can go to the midnight release/early early morning showing without worrying about school and homework.  It sucks that we have to wait so long though.|`|SC6T3SAzaa	well warner brothers did it to excite the people coz they want to increase their income...it's really disapointing coz i realy wanna watch the film..|`|dBB1nOY5aa	i think it's because twilight comes out this month, and harry potter didn't want to share the glory...... :( <br>

Libras are flirtatious and romantic, and Gemini is the sign of the twins so they can be one way one day and a different way the other. I am a Libra myself and had a great love affair with a Gemini when I was 16. I would just flirt with him and tell him how sweet he is, how good he looks, and laugh a lot around him until he notices you are paying attention to him not just as a friend, but more.|`|5d8ca28356da2a343262326d1b36fc0faa	When Gemini and Libra come together in a love affair, they enjoy a great relationship based on intellectual interests and mental agility. Dual-natured Gemini loves Libra's balance, and Libra is always entertained by the chatty, brainy Twins. Libra loves art and beauty while Gemini loves the beauty of an idea, but these loves aren't far off from one another. Both Gemini and Libra have a great deal of mental energy. They can come up with all sorts of great ideas when they work together, and Libra has the get-up-and-go needed to put their ideas into action, a quality which Gemini tends to lack. In fact, in the birth of an idea Gemini is better at pontification than direction, but this is a valuable contribution to Libra's mental process. Both Signs share a need for intellectual freedom, which they can certainly provide for one another. Libra is ruled by the Planet Venus (Love) and Gemini by the Planet Mercury (Communication). Libra and Gemini work well together; they combine the forces of love and communication. As Libra prizes harmony with their lover almost above all else, Gemini won't be able to indulge their love of a good, hearty debate too often; Libra would rather do almost anything than argue. <br>  <br>  <br>  MOON or VENUS in GEMINI<br>  The type of woman who attracts you is clever and changeable, and can keep you guessing. You can be drawn to average-looking women who are witty and interesting, more than to the "beautiful but boring" types.<br>  <br>  Curious minds and quick tongues can turn you on. Witty flirtation and an interesting conversation is the best seduction for you; and women who are either good talkers or good listeners can attract you.|`|fb9723b35315a2a536ec93891ab8d33aaa	Libra and gemini are both the element of air thus meaning a great combination for compatiability.|`|0781d4f76a66884ae44e3a8513369b9aaa	signs don't mean anything don't even think about 'em.|`|d8134f1d5a8d43d7f2a124b878ca0ed4aa	Yeah, Libra and Gemini are supposed to have a good relationship. And, you could ask him questions like, "What plans do you have for the future?" or "Are you dating?" or "What age do you plan to start dating?" And then agree with him: "Really? Me too! We have SO much in common."  ^_^

El ladrón insistió "Que no vas a tener nada, dame el celular, que yo ví que tenés..." En ese momento miré al ladrón... Lo observé tenía la mano en el bolsillo de su campera, pero yo no sabía si tenía un cuchillo o un revólver, quizás no tenía nada... Me supe calmar, y entonces no sé qué me empujó a decir... "Te soy sincero, no tengo nada"...<br>  El ladrón, al escuchar eso me dijo "Bueno andate..." Yo me fuí  tranquilo... Y cuando ya había mucha distancia entre el ladron y yo... Mis piernas empezaron a temblar... El miedo que no pude expresar en el momento, lo había liberado en su debido tiempo y fuera del alcance de otro ladrón... Pero por si acaso aumenté el paso... Hasta que no llegué a mi casa no dejé de caminar a paso ligero... De todos modos tuve suerte, porque lo mío no fue tan así como sinceridad, porque el celular las llaves de la casa, tenía una buena suma de dinero en mis bolsillos..."<br>  <br>  Esa fue la última vez que me intentaron asaltar...

Todas las veces ha sido a punta de pistola y solo se han llevado un poco de efectivo, tomamos la precaución de ir sacando el dinero del negocio varias veces al día para evitar riesgos mayores.

Lo más probable y dadas estas circunstancias, es que el otro, no quiera ser tu amigo. Por lo tanto no será tu mejor amigo.<br>  Falta ahora descubrir tu verdadera personalidad, pero teniendo como dato esta situación, yo particularmente no moriria por ser uno de tus amigos.<br>  Una cosa es que se rompa un matrimonio y otra muy diferente es que te cambien por otro. Realmente leyendo tu comentario, creo que en lugar de tu mujer, adoptaria el mismo criterio. Eso de calificar como mejor amigo tuyo a la persona que la conquisto, deja bastante que desear a la palabra "HOMBRE".

Las mujeres suelen sentir cuando un chico está sobresforzandose por gustar y eso, lejos de atraer, aleja.<br>  <br>  -Sé tú mismo, no asumas una personalidad que no tienes ni pretendas hacerte una identidad que no es la tuya.<br>  <br>  -Los caballeros nunca pasarán de moda, sé cortés, respetuoso, detallista sin exagerar.<br>  <br>  -Sé cari?oso sin volverte meloso ni pegajoso.<br>  <br>  -Sé un buen conversador, no hay nada más delicioso que un tipo con el que pueda ella estar horas y horas hablando de muchos temas, que sepa dónde está parado y la haga reir, pero sin posar de intelectual ni de payaso.<br>  <br>  -Cuida al máximo tu aspecto físico sin volverte vanidoso. Por favor, arréglate como un hombre, nada de esmalte transparente en las u?as, ni aretes ni maquillaje. Lo que primero las llama la atención son tus manos, tu dentadura y tus zapatos. El pelo y la barba, sea cual sea el estilo que lleves, deben estar MUY LIMPIOS, y con apariencia cuidada.<br>  <br>  -No presumas con ellas, no les gustan los fanfarrones. No les interesa saber que has tenido veinte novias ni que saliste con una modelo, ni que tu papá es millonario. Deja que te descubran a su propio ritmo, no te halagues a ti mismo o las espantarás.<br>  <br>  - Los detalles sin justificacion alguna siempre sientan bien , asi que ya sabes, elige cualquier dia y regalale cualquier detalle por infimo que sea, a ella le encantara.|`|i0FjM0Vcaa	yo como chica: para enamorarla no debes darle cosas materiales si en verdad te gusta. tampoco no le mandes cartas , lo que tienes ue aser es ser tu mismo ciempre demostrale tus virtudes al maximo demostrale que a ti ella te importa que tus ojos estan hechos para ver su rostro, talvez solo para enamorarla tienes que ir de frente y decirle que tu sientes cosas por ella y de hay empezar a jugartela. pero un consejo , no te vallas  regalandole cosas porque se fijara en eso nada mas.|`|2rP1apvWaa	Una pregunta, Por q ponen este tipo de preguntas aqui?<br>  Esto es celebridades, o q acaso eres una? ?|`|GOn6TOCWaa	de repente le gustas pero es tímida en sentimientos pero si es así como dices que te mira a cada rato pero ala hora de hablarle es tímida es que le super gusta te lo digo como una chica y si es que te atreves dile lo que sientes por ella|`|qVnqrsiqaa	simplemente se tu mismo y dile lo que sientes y demuestraselo|`|yH5jVs0Jaa	invitala a salir..investiga q le gusta...y sobre eso habla...se tu mismo...se gracioso...y con eso...

Como a maioria das pessoas concorda que felicidade é feita de pequenos momentos, quando uma pessoa sorri, mesmo que for?adamente, seu organismo libera endorfinas responsáveis pela sensa??o de bem-estar, e como o sorriso é geralmente contagiante, esse bem-estar se transferirá a todas as pessoas que o presenciarem, criando um momento especial, ent?o acredito que quem ri é, realmente, feliz.|`|dbf068c216abbb3eae261150858ae034aa	? sinto q sou feliz.

3582e67fe102c3b9bf2df5243198d648aa	It makes more sense if Yahiko is Juugo. He's got the ties to Akatsuki (via Orochimaru), he's looks are blatantly obvious with Yahiko. He's an obviously important character since he's the origin of the CS curse. <br>  <br>  People complain that he "looks" too young to be Yahiko. So?Tsunade's over 60 years old. Why do you people use age as an excuse knowing it's actually physically possible for an old woman to look like she's still in her teens or 20's?  If you're gonna deny that Yahiko is Juugo then think of something better than "he looks too young".<br>  <br>  Also, a lot of people kept denying that the Fourth was Naruto's dad but now it's been proven that he is from the horses mouth. Thing is if it's blatantly obvious, it's probably true.|`|XhosS6iUaa	i really dont think yahiko is juugo...yahiko would be around 35 or something if he were still alive and juugo is only 15 just like sasuke....i dont know where yahiko could be but i do have one thing that to point out...i mean remember pein/negato's previous  body which many said looked like naruto or watever...well if u ask me that body looked alot like yahiko...i mean maybe yahiko died and negato is using his body...idk..cant wait till next week though!<br>  <br>  hope ive answered ur question!<br>  <br>  EDIT- Kyubii King...i understand wat ur saying...and i agree "he's too young" in many ways isnt a good enough excuse...however tsunade uses a jutsu that makes her appear young...and well i highly doubt juugo is that worried of ppl thinking he looks old...yes the connections are there...but the connections are stonger when it comes to the posibility of yahiko have joined the akatsuki with negato/pain and konan and later on died....im just saying...but hey maybe ur right!...idk im not kishimoto to state any facts which have not yet been made...i have absolutly no clue who or where yahiko is...so i guess we'll just have to wait and find out!..great answer though!|`|wJVNxpfhaa	kira is right

She did not do her research. She said she wanted go to a red state and Alabama is the top red state but Montgomery is the bluest city in Alabama. If she wants to her rally, she at least needs to go to Mobile or Birmingham which has more people who are supporting Bush like me.|`|31b9789366ff5be076f00fbeadf4d573aa	I have never ever ever heard of that. sorry

jnKQVlymaa	i read at wikipedia.com that tobi is NOT yondaime.. TOBI is MADARA UCHIHA (read it at wikipedia.com) though there's a fifty fifty chance that he's not madara, but i'm pretty sure he's an uchiha..|`|jMfn1tnKaa	I don't think so. There's a much higher chance of him being Uchiha Obito or Madara. I can only think of two reasons his body wasn't found.<br>  a) The Yondaime-Kyuubi-Naruto sealing jutsu was a really special and even forbidden sealing jutsu. The price was not only one's life but soul+body so there was no chance of resurrection.<br>  b) He somehow locked himself in the Kyuubi so that when it finally gets fully released, Naruto will stand a chance. He's his father, after all ;)|`|j5KNAvdFaa	No! Tobi IS NOT the Yondiame. The Yondiame is dead (he didn't come back!). Tobi is Uchiha Madara -- you find this out if you read the manga... I don't think the Shippuden episodes are that far.... Hope I helped... sorta.

cab8a1be1ab1e87a00d80b564218e9ddaa	Sinceramente, creo que abría que considerar un triple empate (en mi opinión) entre tres grandes canciones:<br>  <br>  - Bohemian Rhapsody (A night at The Opera)<br>  - Innuendo (Innuendo)<br>  - The March of the Black Queen (Queen II)<br>  <br>  Considero que cada una de ellas tiene lo suyo, pero lo más resaltante es su planteamiento en cuanto a melodía, su composición musical es increíble. Creo que las 3 fueron compuestas por Mercury (en Innuendo con Taylor, si más no me equivoco). Hay otras canciones movidas, como Radio Ga Ga, A kind of Magic, pero prefiero escuchar al Queen original, al de sus inicios, al creativo, al que realizaba "Obras de Arte" en cada una de sus composiciones. Concuerdo con alguien que una vez dijo que sus discos favoritos era los 5 primeros más Innuendo (su último disco, donde retoman esos aires creativos). <br>  <br>  Podría escribir horas y horas sobre estas 3 obras de arte, pero el tiempo apremia.

It worked!<br>  <br>  The headaches are all gone.'<br>  <br>  Well, that is wonderful.'<br>  <br>  His wife then says,<br>  <br>  'You know, you haven't been exactly a ball of fire in the bedroom these last few years. <br>  <br>  Why don't you go see the hypnotist and see if he can do anything for that?'<br>  <br>  The husband agrees to try it.<br>  <br>  Following his appointment, the husband comes home, rips off his<br>  <br>  clothes, picks up his wife and carries her into the bedroom. <br>  <br>  He puts her on the bed and says,<br>  <br>  'Don't move, I'll be right back.' <br>  <br>  He goes into the bathroom and comes back a few minutes later<br>  <br>  and jumps into bed and makes passionate love to his wife like never before.<br>  <br>  His wife says, 'Boy, that was wonderful!' <br>  <br>  The husband says, 'I'm really pleased darling now don't move! I will be right back.'<br>  <br>  He goes back into the bathroom, comes back and round two <br>  <br>  was even better than the first time.<br>  <br>  The wife sits up and her head is spinning.<br>  <br>  Her husband again says, 'Don't move, I'll be right back.'<br>  <br>  With that, he goes back in the bathroom. <br>  <br>  This time, his wife quietly follows him and there, in the bathroom,<br>  <br>  she sees him standing at the mirror and saying, <br>  <br>  'She's not my wife <br>  <br>  'She's not my wife.<br>  <br>  'She's not my wife!'<br>  His funeral service will be held on Saturday|`|QzpFfF2qaa	A psychiatrist was conducting a group therapy session with four young<br>  mothers and their small children. "You all have obsessions," he<br>  observed.<br>  <br>  To the first mother, he said, "You are obsessed with eating. You've<br>  even named your daughter Candy."<br>  <br>  He turned to the second Mom. "Your obsession is money. Again, it<br>  manifests itself in your child's name, Penny,"<br>  <br>  He turned to the third Mom. "Your obsession is alcohol. Again, it<br>  manifests itself in your child's name, Brandy."<br>  <br>  At this point, the fourth mother got up, took her little boy by the<br>  hand and whispered, "Come on, Dick, let's go".

Can I just say, the band have been on tour since around January, and they are on tour until August. Yeah, that's 8 solid months of singing, almost every night, at least every 3 nights. And plenty of jet-lag. Try singing that often, with hardly any time to warm up. Then your voice would be like that. I lose my voice after one evening on Singstar. And they don't electronically alter the voices in the studio, they just record over and over, til it's perfect. You get one chance on stage. And I've seen videos of them live, and they are awesome.

Her personal life is troubled, however; she struggles with self esteem issues, she is torn between the relationship of her divorced parents and grappling with her mom's issues, and feels like a social outcast at school. Shortly after befriending Evie Zamora (Nikki Reed), the most popular and attractive girl at school, Tracy is led into a world of sex, drugs, and crime. She becomes a violent and self-destructive girl, losing her old friends and gaining a bad reputation. The film follows her trying to deal with the emotional difficulties of teendom and the consequences of a self-destructive lifestyle.|`|QryYwqmOaa	Jason vs Freddy Krueger...its and important life lesson, never get drunk or high when Jason is on the loose and Freddy is out scaring the living daylights out of gullible teens.|`|ld5VLrkKaa	the butterfly effect (kinda..) - very worthwhile thou<br>  thirteen|`|7j2nhdviaa	well a movie in theatres is 21. it deals with gambling, drinking, etc.<br>  <br>  it's a good movie.|`|X1ffX68saa	Do you want to watch these kinds of movies so that you don't give in to the party seen???

Naruto melawan Sasuke aja udah kalah apalagi ngelawan Goku udah kelenger abis.|`|WMvxGf44aa	da pasti naruto (kyuubi ekor 4)<br>  karena........<br>  ya pokonya naruto de yang menang<br>  kimi ga pernah & ga suka nonton dragon ball jadi ga tau super saiya 5 tu kaya gimana ???? taunya saint saiya tu|`|hTYl2H3Kaa	songoku ga ada ss5 , cuma ampe 4 .<br>  ss5 itu cuma fan art .<br>  tapi klo kata kmu ada ya udah gw jawab ,<br>  ya menang ss5 goku lah , <br>  goku bisa menghancurkan alam semesta ,<br>  naruto ekor 4 ngancurin bumi aja belom tentu bisa .<br>  jadi songoku pemenangnya .|`|mAkAskmyaa	musang ????<br>  <br>  yang benar rubah kaleee<br>  <br>  aku pegang naruto aja deh<br>  <br>  semangat naruto tak akan pernah pudar<br>  <br>  apalagi keinginannya menjadi hokage<br>  <br>  dan keinginannya mengejar sasuke muncul dibenaknya<br>  <br>  dia tidak akan pernah terkalahkan<br>  <br>  dengar dengar, naruto berhasil mengendalikan cakra kyuubi sampai keluar ekor sembilannya|`|mu7VuLWcaa	maap bukan menghina naruto , <br>  <br>  tapi menurutku kekuatan naruto hanya bisa dibandingkan sama dragonball yang gokunya masih kecil aja bukan yang sudah besar ,<br>  <br>  kalau goku yang sudah besar dia sih bsa membunuh semua orang yang ada di anime naruto hanya dalam 1 hari saja ( tapi kayaknya tidak mungkin soalnya goku itu orangnya sangat baik dan dia hanya pernah lepas kendali saat jadi monyet besar aja , selebihnya dia orangnya sangat baik , jadi mustahil dia mau melawan naruto yang sama-sama orang baik ),<br>  <br>  karena goku besar kekuatanya sangat dashyat dapat menghancurkan bumi dalam sekali serang <br>  <br>  sedangkan naruto menghancurkan desa aja belum pernah , <br>  <br>  jadi kesimpulannya naruto masih kalah jauh dari goku apalagi super saiyan goku mustahil dia bisa menang|`|q0B4XwSMaa	menurut q........<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  pasti menang goku....<br>  <br>  <br>  karena goku itu adalah termasuk 3 dari orang terkuat didunia selain legend supersaiyan(broly), dan bejita...<br>  <br>  <br>  naruto....<br>  alah.....<br>  <br>  <br>  apa sih.....|`|qGybjosBaa	Walah... perbandingannya terlalu jauh.<br>  Goku bisa menghancurkan bumi dengan 1 serangan.
