I’m a 13 year old girl and I’m running out of books to read      I would go to the library but no-one else in my family really reads books as much as me, so I don’t have a way of getting there.      Some books I’ve read and enjoyed:      The Harry Potter Series,   Cornelia Funke books,   The chronicles of Narnia      I know they are just kiddy books really, (Sept Harry potter) but I don’t mind reading more grownup books (within reason, of course)      And before anyone suggests it. I have read Twilight and didn’t really like it.      Also has any one read Marley and me by John Grogan, and if so was it good?

This is evidence, If you can speak Chinese，you will not doubt my identity.    http://groups.google.com/group/the-divin...       Because of me, the Chinese government has completely controlled by the United States and the European Union.

Because of the Third World War, end of the world in 2017. Why I return as the Messiah in China? The fuse of the third world war is the war in the Taiwan Strait in 2008. I just want to tell you, there is a great plague coming, more than two thirds of humanity will be died. The upcoming terrorist deal with a major disaster.

Such that he will cast thunderbolts, so many in such an array，    Few and distant, then deep into the Hesperias.    3.60   Throughout all Asia great proscription,    Even in Mysia, Lycia and Pamphilia.

I grabbed everything in sight to stuff into it; I was going to leave from this place. I hated it, and I had hated it for seven years. I was finally able to get out of here. I had been for a while now, but I just had the perfect day to go now. I shoved the last article of clothing into the bag, and unlocked the mini safe that was in my room. I jerked on the handle of the safe, and it popped open. I grabbed the money from my dad's will out of it. I was now eighteen, a legal adult. I was allowed to have half the will money, and the house he had left me in West Port Washington. I lived in Charleston South Carolina. I would have to get on a plane. I had already ordered my ticket. I wrote a short goodbye to my mom, not like she would find it or care, but I was leaving with a good bye. For the horrible seven years she forced upon me. I dragged my suitcase to the bus stop, and waited on the bench next to the stop sign. Constantly thinking about what would happen when I got to West port. The buses tires screeching against the pavement interrupted my thoughts. I got on noticing not many people were on it. I claimed a seat in the front of the bus. I waited patiently before it could stop. I looked out the window and watched the scenery of blackness fly by the window. I was extremely tired. I laid my head against the seat in front of me. Feeling like freedom was only a few hours away.  I heard the bus screech to a halt, and I picked my head up from the seat, attempting to wake myself up in the process, I walked off the bus. I was at the airport. Making sure to grab all of my stuff, I walked slowly to the door, opening it with exhaustion, and saw some people scrambling around quickly. Grabbing luggage, and running in a different direction. I sighed, and threw my stuff on the ground. I sat there a while, just watching happy families go by me. The bored announcer came on the speaker. Saying it was time to board my flight. I grabbed all of my stuff, and headed toward the plane. I dropped my stuff off, so it could be loaded into the plane. I went through the medal detector, and they checked me in. My heart bounced at the thought of being free. I boarded the plane. There were some people on it. I was not sure many people would be on the way to the same place as I was from all the way in Charleston. I sat in a secluded corner by the window, tracing my fingers against the fog on the window. I felt the chill run across my fingers. It was a good feeling. A family sat across from me. A boy had to sit by me, so he could be near his family. I looked away, and out the window. I was thinking about these last few years, how horrible they had been. I don't even see how I survived them, but I did.   The plane started to jerk, I closed my eyes. I wasn't used to planes. I didn't mind them. I wasn't scared of them, but I just got these weird feelings on them. I opened my eyes, and saw we were way up in the sky. Good I had missed the bad part. I rubbed my sore eyes from the non- sleeping life style. My head was throbbing. Lauren would have liked this. She loved planes. Lauren was my sister. Her, and my dad were supposedly killed in a fire, but I remember something different. I remember walking with Lauren outside. I remember someone grabbing me, holding me back, and lots of screaming. I thrashed against the person holding me captive, knowing that if she died, I would never forgive myself. When I was able to look blood smothered the ground, and the bodies of my father, and Lauren were limp on the ground. I remember turning around, and seeing neon blue eyes. Warm arms were around me. Then it was all blank, and I was in the hospital. They had told me I was in a fire, my arms were burned. They said that Lauren and my dad were not as lucky as I was, and didn't manage to survive. I knew this had to be a lie, because I had remembered some of what had happened. They were murdered.   After that my mom went practically crazy. I couldn't blame her. I had almost lost it through the many years. I can't express how glad I was to leave. My mom was never really there anymore. She was usually off somewhere doing drugs, or out partying. I opened my eyes, and saw the family talking. It was at this time I had come to notice that the boy that was sitting nearest to me. Was different then the others. He looked a lot different. The whole family had dirty blond hair, and most of them hazel eyes. There was a man, and a woman. A set of twins it looked like. Then there was this boy. He had the bluest eyes; I had a sudden flash back of the neon blue eyes. I shook it off; he had black hair that was hanging in his face. His eyes looked back at me staring. I looked toward the window trying to ignore them. I didn't want to hear what they were saying.

This is a chapter in a book that I am working on, please read it and tell me what you think of it. Any feed back is good =)                     I left Alicia's house party quickly. It seemed like Alicia had her hands full and was really too busy to talk at the time. My house was only about five blocks away from her house anyways, so I figured it would not be too much trouble to walk home. Besides it would give me time to think. Time to think about my strange re-accuring dream that I been having for the past week.      Every night, I dreamt I was in a dark, dreary forest. I had no idea how I got there, nor how I would get out. I would run through the forest, desperatly trying to find my way out, venturing deeper and deeper into the forest, until all was black. The only think that would be visible, would be a pair of bright, red eyes.      I shivered at the memory of my nightmare, and picked up the pace. By now the music from Alicia's house was next to gone. I walked down the dark street to my house, listning to the last bits of audible music, until all was silent.      I quickened my pace even faster. The darkness was not helping me feel better about my nightmare at all. Plus it felt like I was being watched. I was finally half way home and looking forward to having a nice cup of hot chocolate while snuggled in a chair reading my newest book, The Clique.      "Kiana..."      I stoped in my tracks. For a second my heart stopped beating. I slowly turned around to see a teenage girl, standing in the middle of the street, staring at me.      I did not recognize the girl at all. I looked at her and racked my brain. How did she know my name? Did I see her at the party? Is she from my school?      I stared at the girl. She must have been the most beautiful girl I have ever seen. She had long blonde hair that reached all the way down to her waist, big round sea blue eyes, full lips and a figure that any girl would kill for. She had pale, flawless skin that reminded Kiana of a proclain doll.       But yet, Kiana could not help but feel unsafe and scared.      The beautiful girl walked over to Kiana. She was just as graceful as she was beautiful. Kiana watched the girl as she walked closer and closer. She watched as the flawless girltook stride after stride. With every step, a smile would form across her face. Baring pearly white teeth, and two sharp teeth that reminded Kiana of fangs.      Slowly yet steadily, the girls eyes turned from their beautiful Sea Blue, to a deadly, gleaming bright red.      It was the girl from Kiana's nightmare.

Cast   Blue Bloods Series by Melissa De La Cruz   Vampire Academy Series by Richelle Mead   Twilight Series by Stephenie Meyer   The Host by Stephenie Meyer   Uglies Series by Scott Westerfeld   Midnighters Series by Scott Westerfeld   Peeps by Scott Westerfeld   Private Series by Kate Brian   The Clique Series by Lisi Harrison   Just Listen by Sarah Dessen   The Truth About Forever by Sarah Dessen   I Heart You, You Haunt Me by Lisa Schroeder    Far From You by Lisa Schroeder    Wake by Lisa McMann   Generation Dead by Daniel Waters   The Summoning by Kelley Armstrong   Looking For Alaska by John Green         Yeah, my problem is that I can't find any other books to read. Can you suggest some out of the books I have read and liked?   Thank You So Much.      Oh, I am currently reading Kiss Me Kill Me by Lauren Henderson    and I just bought the sequel Kisses and Lies.      But after that I don't have any other books to read.

20090131182420AAPdM3W	Arts & Humanities;Visual Arts;Photography	Why is are my pictures so dark?	I just got a Nikon D60 and my pictures which are taken in well-lit environments come out pitch-black. Like, I take a picture of the sun and I can barely make it out. When I lwoer the shutter speed to like 1/10 it's fairly bright but when I get over 1/100 it goes black. HOW DO I FIX THIS??? And does aperture have something to do with this? I noticed the smaller the aperture the brighter, but this can't be the problem...      I'm a beginner...

20090131190537AAq0jO5	Arts & Humanities;Visual Arts;Photography	At what distance should an image be taken in order to get a true representation of one's physical appearance?	I'm recently started taking pictures with my camera phone and had some questions concerning the results I'm getting.  All of the pictures I've taken are mirror shots.  Essentially me standing a short distance from the counter with a mirror in front and taking a picture of the image in the mirror.      Now, obviously all of these pictures are taken at a relatively short distance, but if i move like right up to the front of the mirror and take a picture, I don't like the result whereas if I take a picture at a very short distance from behind the counter I do.  Now I want a true representation of how I look, but at the same time I was wondering, if you take a picture where your face is basically right in front if the mirror, can that produce a bit of a distorted image?  To me, I would think an image taken form right behind the counter would be a more accurate portrayal since people are never right up in your face in real life, but I wanted to see what others thought as well as to see if there are distortions that do in fact take place if an image is taken at a very close distance?

20090131200049AASrnlR	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Care to comment on a Tourist Snapshot poem?	My inspiration has been on a week-long break. It suddenly came up with this.....      All-Day (and Breakfast) at the 24/7 Café   By Jellz Fisher      Every sign tells a story,   when you are hungry.   Next one read,   “Breakfast served all day”      It made me want to ask,   at this 24/7 Café,    “What time do you   finish serving breakfast?”   But I feared the answer   might have been too simple.   So I finished my Hash Brown,   while walking out   into a glorious sunset.      Sun served all day,    clocked-out when    Moon showed up    for duty.   I guess God and   Man run on a different   time sheet.

Screams So Silent…   Every day I go out and play   A part that hides my dismay.   And even though I’m in such pain,   I push away the pouring rain.      “She’s so quiet.” I hear them say.   But I’m screaming every day.   My tortured head begs for rest   From the never ending test.      I don’t have a clique    Or a guy named Rick.   I don’t have a skill    And no longer a will.      Do I fit?   Even a bit?   Am I really wanted    When I’m confronted?      My heads so confused   I have been used,   Forgotten,   And treated rotten      When the pain grows strong,   I don’t know what is wrong.   With no one for me to be reliant,   My screams shall always be so silent.

Like in this great mass of people in the world, you are a forgotton soul, only to find moments later that your not by the ones that love you? But no matter what that feeling comes back? How about feeling as if you KNOW your meant for something BIG, that your meant to change and affect others lives for the better. That your different from everyone else, but you just dont know what for or how to even do it? Like others are dragging you down? Have you even experienced life in other peoples shoes? Like even ACTUALLY thought about it? And how you have an influence on them by the way you treat.. them? We are all messed up someway or another. Do you feel as if your a fake person when your around people, just to fit in? But in the long run, everyone is being fake, so in reality, nobody is fitting in to nothing? Is it all pointless? Can you even make a difference? Do you really care about other people when you see them getting picked on, but you join in just for the temporary laughs? Do you know who you are? Are you blending in, and slowly slipping away from yourself? Do you feel like nobody notices you, and that you dont even deserve to be here? Like you want to take back everything you say, because you assume nobody cares and that everything you say is meaningless to others? Sorry...these are just some of the things I think about... Not necessarily WHO I am.Just questions for others.   Shaggy

20090131155314AA6lQqI	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	What is true beauty in this world?	As you all know, men perceive woman as an attractive and sexual appealing being to them. At times people would say "she is beautiful", at times people would say "she is ugly". However, every person has a different perception and what might be ugly to me could be a beautiful thing in your eyes. For example: a male tiger sees a female tiger as something that's appealing to him. However when people sees a female tiger, it's hard to even figure out the difference between the visual appearance between one tiger and another. So my question is, if everyone sees things differently. What is true beauty?

I couldnt fit it all in one so please read my other question similar to this. it has the first chapter and this is the last paragraph that finishes my 1st chapter thanks.      "SOMEBODY HELP ME! i screamed and gasped at the same time. I moved back a bit and patted the little girls face. She was gorgeous, she had light blonde hair and what seemed brown eyes, she looked only 5. But where were her parents? I shone the torch to the pavement and started to half scream half cry as red blood trailed down the cement. I looked back at the girl and she stopped twitching. I reached for her throat to check her pulse but there was no beat. "Im so so sorry". I Jumped back as she tried to gasp a huge breath, but then she was still. I froze again as i just realised that I had killed this little girl, this gorgeous little girl that was innocent from myself not paying attention to the road. I hit myself on the head several times of anger and sadness. And hit my head a bit too hard making it throb in pain. I slowly stumbled back to the car and reached for my phone and called 000. About 10 minutes later two ambulances and cop car arrived. The police didn't ask me any questions because I was too shocked to answer. The ambulance staff wrapped me up in a towel and tried to support me. They took me in the back of the ambulance before i passed out in their arms.

What if we're thinking we're living for something, only to find out in the end that it didn't matter.      How would you feel?      Lately, I've been thinking that nothing even matters.So what if I become successful; I could lose everything that I had in one moment.      So what if I have a family, humans are going to have to die one of these days, so what's the point?      Nothing really matters. Even all the good experiences are lost with our fading memory. All the people who know us after we're gone are also going to die.      I mean do you even know who your great, great, great, great grandmother is?      I didn't think so.      Again, how do you guys feel about this? Our lives probably won't matter.
20090131195600AARM7xw	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Please help me improve my poem, and if possible, change the last stanza.... [poem is about the KING AND I]?	Back in the year 1862,   In a place in Siam, called Bangkok,   There lived a King, his children, and wives,   Who had a lot of knowledge they were to unlock.      With the help of Anna--a terrific instructor,   They all discovered a lot.   The King himself, has been taught good deeds too,   And soon enough, his immorality, he forgot.      Anna stayed with them for quite a while,   Teaching them new things everyday.   They determined new facts, and continued to learn   And thanked Anna all the way.      Anna wanted to make a difference.   She tried to make the discrimination end.   Women those days, weren't treated the same...   That was something she'll have to amend.      It has been unfair for most of the women,   They've always been looked down upon, and stepped on.   People make promises, and try to convince them,   But all those commitmment will be gone.      Thanks to Anna's influence, Siam had a change.   And now the Western Culture has become their phase.   They're on to a new league; a whole new life...   And a new society without disgrace.            *please help me improve and add more rhymes... and also, please help me change the last stanza.

I've been doing music my entire life, and unfortunately it takes a while before it can pay even some of your bills.  I still plan on teaching private music lessons as well.  However, I've been doing a lot of thinking about what type of day job would I do.  I've done corporate 40-hour a week jobs already, and I can't stand being stuck in a building 5 days a week over and over again.      I also want to ask of professional photographers to view my online portfolio and give your honest opinion (on if you think I could make a business-oriented living doing it).  NONE of my pictures are photoshopped.  Most of them are straight out of my camera, however some are enhanced through aperture.      www.ashleyspencerphoto.com      myspace.com/ashleyspencermusic

I get up,  The air that enters my lunds is cold and wanting,  Wanting warmth and sustanace to fill it with joy,   Impossible!   I look out the window and see malice and despair,  Grey, dark, deprived, and wanting just like the air,   But, what?   I go outside and the chill runs deep to my marrow,   I am alone,   I am left....No one!  Desolate and deprived,the land and air is around me,  Yet, I wonder still, what do they want?  I walk around grey, cold, and quiet.   I realize the peaceful calm, no noise, no life,   I go crazy searching for lingering presence,   I run..... and run....and run......      I trip and feel the warmth run through air and land,  I finally realize what the air and land want,  ......Me! Im left, they've taken all else but me,   and finally as the sky gros darker, the ai and land,   Want no longer for they now have all.

20090131194621AA50EMn	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What do you think of this poem i just wrote?	These bottled up emotions not happy or bright.   These bottled up emotions make me want to fight.   I am sick to my stomach for keeping them in.   My vomit is these words through paper and pen.      The cure is honesty, that is all that I need.   Look into my eyes when you are talking to me.   I will not put up with this a second longer.   Don't try to walk on me now, my heart is stronger.      Pick a direction and I'll go the opposite.   Don't say you will change; It's already a habit.   The emotions I kept—I will never forget.

And...I don't know...maybe they're right, because I'm bisexual, and none of my friends know that I am xD. So is that mostly true? Or just steriotype?   The whole point to this question is mostly the question asked above, but for one reason. 1.) I'm starting to like this guy in theater, and I don't know if he's that way or not. He's really quite since he's new, and he's like mostly around me since we're the only two guys out of 10 chicks in the class. Which is kind of nice xD. So yea, no hard feelings if the question is completely false. Just wanted to ask:D Please answer thanks!!!

20090131165439AAENoVD	Arts & Humanities;History	Machiavellian principle?	As the arts flourished during the Renaissance, new political ideas were also born, Italian philosopher Niccolo Machiavelli believed that a good ruler could not always honor his word and had to put his needs and that of the state above promises made to the people. Machiavelli  thought that “the end justified the means” and that morals should be removed from politics.

20090131172656AAed5zh	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Would you call that wisdom?	This is about my mother  and her influence in my life.I already posted the bottom on yahoo and got some good  feedback so I decided  to add more lines to it. I am hoping that at the end, I will write enough paragraph for a college essay.What do you think? Once again, feel free to share  your own philosophy of life or correct any mistake in mine            “She  built  a kingdom   of  knowledge with  a third  grade  education. She has  more wisdom than the intellectuals  who claimed  to be  philosophers. Her  voice  could  turn the stubborn to the right  direction, her hands  could  feed  the  world. When  injustice and impunity filled my heart with anger, disgust and resentment, it was in her arms that I discovered the power of forgiveness. She is  not  a divine creature, thus there is no way that she could suddenly change the negative feelings that I carried  in my heart. However, I was to liberate  myself till I let my heart ill from within. I realized and understood that  A young heart must liberate itself from the dark relic of its past in order for it to reach the dream that it has always fought for. Regrets can only hold it in a backward abysmal and make it bitter. Sadly, a heart that is rotten by bitterness can become a dark nest where hate likes to grow. I should  not hate my imperfections because hate makes one blind and obstructs their judgment. It is hard to forget past mistakes and to forgive  those who has hurt me but instead of moaning on what has been done I ask God for the courage to accept the things that I cannot change and the wisdom to accept  what I cannot change.

20090226073757AA6zya5	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Victory at Gallows Creek?	As I walked along the narrow trail .... the shadows moved in fast .... I could feel the evil lurking there .... as the hairs stood up upon the back of my neck .... I could almost smell the rotten flesh ....      The Evil one he lurks about .... spreading all the fear .... he preys upon the little ones who play upon the forest edge ....      The waters run so swift, so fast, the current it flows free .... time and time again I felt my soul bewitching me ....      The moon beams glisten in the night .... I see afar a shinning light .... my heart beats hard against my ribs .... my head it now feels faint .... I start to run across the field of Golden Oaks & Willows .... trying to out run the Beast before he catches me ....      Suddenly I trip and fall, and start rolling down the hill .... I hear the Evil one approach .... my heartbeats all but still ....      The Elf's & Faeries run and hide .... the Gnomes they stand their ground .... the mighty Trolls they move in fast .... astute they stand to fight at last ....      Victory is close at hand .... I stand and turn to fight .... with the mighty Trolls upon my left .... and the Gnomes upon my right ....      The 1,800 lb four headed wild boar stares right at us .... with bitter sour faces .... I call upon the Trolls to charge .... and the Gnomes to attack the rear ....      I drew my mighty sword so fast .... I slashed the dreaded beast .... I opened up two ugly heads and knocked out half their teeth ....      The Faeries cheered, the Elf's cried out Hooray for the Gnomes & Trolls ....      Within the hour the beast lay dead .... we soon began to feast .... shouts of joy and shouts of cheer could be heard all the way to Gallows Creek ....

Is there ever a proper/appropriate justification for someone being mean? or is that state inherently, frivolous/angry/unnecessary?

20090131180156AAScNJi	Arts & Humanities;Visual Arts;Drawing & Illustration	Potential stupid question about life drawing...?	I want to test my skills by drawing a nude person. I could maybe even include it in my art portfolio for college. However, being in high school, there's not much opportunity to have a life drawing class. I'd rather not draw from a picture, so I've considered drawing myself nude in a mirror, or at least part of me. I'm underage however, would there be any legal issues (or just issues in general) when I tell the people who are looking at my portfolio that it's a self drawing?

It fits perfectly, and it means ten times more than anything he could have bought for me.   However.  Every time I wear it, the skin under it turns a yellowish orange, and stays that way for a good few days, even if I scrub it.   I was wondering if anyone had any ideas of some sort of sealant I could use, that wouldn't damage it?     P.S.  I had no idea where to put this, I figured people around here might know stuff about working with wood... any suggestions for a better category are welcome.
20090131183751AACdLoH	Arts & Humanities;Theater & Acting	How can you audition and prepare for movies/commercials/voice overs near PORTLAND OREGON?	I have previous acting experience, besides schools plays, and an acting class when I was real young and such.      I know, me and a billion other 13 year old girls dream of being in movies. Something to do with the effects afterwards. But I've watched how they film the scenes. I don't want some google search of talent agencies in portland, because those can be scams, unless you know they are reliable agencies. And I don't want to spend thousands of dollars on something that I will get nothing out of.      Ever since I was 5 I've wanted to be an actress or singer. I don't necessarily aspire to be famous though, but I could manage it.   I just want something that looks good on my resume, so that I could audition for a real movie. I don't have the means to travel to Los Angeles right now, unless I know for sure I could get something.      Does anyone know any casting calls in Portland, where they don't require previous movie experience? Or in the Oregon Washington area.      What do you suggest? More acting classes? Is the thousands of dollars worth it? And how do you audition for acting school? How do I prepare?      Thanks :)

20090226061600AAEABlH	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	For all the writers and young adults out there...?	i'm 16 and wanted to know what do u think of this first chapter in my ya series,any suggestions to make it better??Thanks      Chapter1        It was nearly midnight. A tall, broad shouldered man walked down the gravel lane. On both sides of the lane grew lush, newly irrigated grass. The man climbed the first two stony steps, bulging out of the ground in front of the oak door. The house was silent under the glimmering stars. The man knocked twice with his knuckles, and waited. Nothing stirred, for a few seconds, inside the house, but a moment later the yellowish light of the living room filtered through the drawn curtains of the front window, and the door swung open.           A man in his sleeping pajamas gazed at the unexpected guest. ”Byron??”As the nearly awake man spoke in vivid astonishment, the guest pushed forward without even being invited. His black, leather coat ruffled behind him casting a dark shadow under the light of the living room where, a moment later, he was standing. The man closed the door, and followed his guest with dismay over his bony, long face. The guest took off his coat and threw it over one of the long couches. His round face was reddish under the heat of the small lamp that swayed down the ceiling over his head, where a few white hairs spiked out on both sides, just above his long ears.           Byron gazed up at the man who seemed to be struggling to pull himself off a long sleep.He kept on rubbing his eyes,that were rimmed with with blue circles.           “Won’t you show me some hospitality Elliot?.It had been a long time since last I saw you,ten years,I guess”Byron said,sitting on the coach beside his coat”I’m not here to waste my time.There’s an old unsettled business I need to finish with you”           “There is nothing for you to settle with me Byron.I’ve abandoned your filthy business a long time ago,and I won’t meddle in it once again”.Elliot turned towards the entrance door,and opened it wide” I think that you need to leave”        Byron pushed himself off the couch,and pointed towards the wooden staircase standing a few cms at the end of the living room.”I guess that  victor will be happy to know the nature of his father’s work,won’t he??” Byron smirked at Elliot”I know many ways through which I can find victor and tell him the truth,guess what he’ll be ashamed of his father.I can simply go up right now,wake victor,and tell him every single detail of our filthy business,”Byron walked towards Elliot with his hands dipped inside his jeans pockets,and whispered in Elliot’s ear”and you won’t be able to stop me”           A moment of silence passed,with Elliot staring right into Byron’s deep, blue eyes, that were strikingly similar to Elliot’s eyes.Elliot considered the warning for a second.If victor knows anything about him,for sure,he’ll reconsider their relation as a father and son, besides,any secret of Elliot’s past being slipped into victor’s ears would undoubtly throw victor into great jeopardy, and Elliot daren’t risk his only son’s life.           “Fine Byron. follow me”. Byron raised his eyebrows triumphantly as Elliot approached a white curtain hanging down from the ceiling. He tore the curtain down to ,wooden door appeared .Elliot turned the bronze knob remembering the key. He dipped his hands into his pajamas coat and took out a black, iron key. His hands fell under the heaviness of the key, but Elliot managed to poke it into the door, and turn it open.           Byron walked forward into the office sensing something, with the back of his hand, inside his left thigh pocket. From inside the office, Elliot twisted his head over the door, running his eyes anxiously up and down the silent living room, making sure that Victor wasn’t strolling somewhere in the house, then he closed the door quietly.           “what do you want then” Elliot said locking the door, and slidding the key back in his pajamas pocket,and glaring at Byron who sat down crossed legged,behind the red fire of the hearth, in an old arm chair.” finish it Byron,or else….”        “or what Crow?? speak.” Elliot stole a contemptuous look around.The room was quiet. Nothing stirred, save for the fire eating at the thick branches of wood at the fireplace.           Elliot pulled out a chair from an oval table. The table was laden with all kinds of slithery tubes, colorful mixtures, and huge tomes of advanced math.Over one of the dusty covers, a magnifying glass, with a red haft was placed. Elliot slid the magnifying glass carefully into his pocket, and sat down facing Byron, who took out a pipe, lighted it up, and blowed out fumes with the shape of a heart,;they wifted in a zigzag line towards Elliot and vanishing after colliding with his shoulder.           “Still playing with your old set Elliot, I can’t help but remember the old memories”           “finish it Byron” Elliot interrupted placing his elbows on the wooden arms of the chair           “fine Elliot”Byron blew harder at his pipe, that perched at the left corner of his mouth.Byron to

HOW DO I REPLY TO THIS??????   =OO      The sky was streaked with a deep golden orange color as the sun began to set and night would cascade upon the city. The streets were spotted with a few people here and there, nothing unusual for a night like this. Light Yagami, was walking alone on the side walk. His hands were tucked inside his pockets as he walked at a semi fast pace towards his home. The orange rays of light cast a shadow to fall across his face, his shadow touching the concrete behind, following him with each step. The light only made him look foreboding and evil, which was both true and false in a way.      Though to everyone else, he would appear to be alone, there was a creature floating just on the rim of his own shadow. This was the shinigami by the name of Ryuk, the only person who could see him was Light himself. So no one would ever see Ryuk or hear him, unless they touched the Death Note and Light would make sure that that never happened. He was a killer by the name of Kira, Kira was the second half of him, the more evil side if you will. At first he was just the same, using a notebook to pass judgment, but with time his mind twisted into a scheming one and now he plots to rule the new world as a God. Kira would do anything to get what he wants, so keeping any one from touching the Death Note, was simple, because he would just kill them any way.      Recently, Light Yagami, has been attending college, and there he met someone who claimed to be L. He did not know for sure yet if this was true. He was still trying to communicate with the other, keeping it only inside the campus. He didn't know how much longer this would last though, but he would stick to it just to be sure that this guy was or wasn't the real deal. Now, though he was just going home, to resort to his typical doings, the Death Note was waiting for him in the hidden drawer. With the cameras and such gone, he could do whatever he wanted, and talk to Ryuk as much as he wanted.      By the time he was turning the corner from the main street, Ryuk was talking so much behind him, that he was barely focusing where he was going, or who was walking around him. He gtared over his shoulder at the shinigami who seemed never to shut his big mouth. He couldn't exactly say it out loud, because the people around him would think that he was mad, talking to someone who wasn't there. He was always very carefull with this, determined not to be caught, not by the police and not by L.      Because he wasn't paying much attention to the things around him, he walked right into someone else who had been walking along the street. HIs fast pace, had knocked them both to the ground. The fall is what finally shut Ryuk up, because he was too busy cackling and laughing at what had just happened. Light got to his feet and dusted himself off, looking over to the other person, he put on an apologetic look.      "I'm...really sorry I ran into you, I guess I wasn't watching where I was going...." he said, this was Light Yagami talking.

My professor assigned our new art project today and it is to get a found object, and change its color or texture (but not it's form) in order to change its meaning or function. Some examples were painting a stop sign green, painting an orange road cone camouflage, or painting all of the ends of jumper cables black.      I'm really at a loss here. I know I get just as angry as the next person whenever someone posts on here asking for homework help, but I just don't know what to do here, and hopefully someone has done a similar project before and can provide some insight into this.

I imagined this is what it felt like to become insane. Thoughts swirled in my head. The questions i had about him burned into the back of my skull. I pondered the thought of him.      William.      My eyes blurred as i pictured him and a smile slid across my face. This misterious boy had entered my life just days previously and yet now it was like I couldn't get him off my mind.      His curly brown hair the hung just above his eyes swarmed my mind. I marveled at the thought of his smile. His brilliant white teeth seemed to sparkle in every direction. It seemed as if nothing would ever break my concentration. That was until Doyle walked back into the room.      Would I ever find out what William was hiding from me or would I spend forever just wondering what mystery he kept inside himself?

20090131193533AANnohq	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	To the writers: Creating a fictional spoiled brat...?	...is hard.  Fun, but hard.          I am having a bit of writers block when it comes to this particular piece of characterization.  This character is, suffice to say, a prince of sorts--a boy who has been given everything, used to have servants attending to his every whim, who is so self-entitled that he believes that he is indestructible.      However, he is also a good person; he is not so selfish that he cares nothing for others, he is capable of love.  He is not, as we like to say, evil, but simply self-absorbed.      Suffice to say, this is no easy character to create.  I would love any sort of suggestions you could give me, be they about potential mannerisms, actions, events in his life, or anything else that you may even consider trivial.          Thanks in advance...seriously, ANY suggestion will help.        PS: The boy is a closeted homosexual in this story, so any chauvinism or interaction with a female love interest is probably not going to work.  And yes, this detail is indisputable, so please, if you feel so go gay-bash somewhere else if you feel offended.
20090131163037AACKmkR	Arts & Humanities;Performing Arts	Feeling awkward on stage?	I'm in a musical where I am the lead character. There is a lot of touching and near kisses [and one actual kiss] with the lead boy in the play.      I've never really been a touchy person and so this is kind of awkward for me. I hardly know the guy and it's hard for me to be social so i haven't really gotten to know him yet.   I also don't hug people much [i'm just not touchy] and i've never kissed anyone before.   I know how to flirt [well], but It's hard to seem flirty with this guy because I don't actually like him like my character does in the play.      What can i do? i want to be comfortable with him and i want to have an attraction, but I'm not good at being social.   also, there is another girl who shares my role with me [we switch off days] and she is very comfortable with him and they look like they are actually a couple, so it makes it even more awkward for me when it's my turn.      How can i change and be better at this.      also, how can i not feel awkward kissing him and stuff?

20090131193610AAPua4R	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Do you like the 1st chapter of my story!?	Finally some peace to myself, i thought. I looked at my watch, 7:00pm. Work was the cherry that completes me. ugh. Being around screaming children all day is not a job I wanted, its just a job that I need to survive in this tough world. I walked over to my fridge and smiled as I saw the chocolate bar, that's exactly what I needed, a nice bar full of caleries. As I was about to sink my teeth in the bar i screamed "What now!. My phone was vibrating, I pulled it out of my jacket and whined as i saw the number, it was Carly. oh, great, another boyfriend dumped you sweetie? i thought to myself. I shoved my phone back in my pocket and ignored the phone call. Now back to the calerie bar. I opened my mouth until I felt another vibrating. It was Carly again. This time I decided to answer so she can shut up.    "Hello Carly, what a surprise I was just thinking about you".    "Hi Jessie, um is it okay if you could come around for a while? Im kind of sad.   I grabbed the phone and starting wacking it on the front of my head.   "Sure Carly, I mean thats what great friends are for" I said a little bit too sarcastic that she might of noticed.    "Ok thanks Jessie, well Chris broke up with me. He said I was really annoying and he'd been waiting to brake up with me for months. Am i annoying to you'?   "Oh no, not at all"   "Are you being sarcastic"?   I bit the end of my phone.   "no i will be around in a bit, GOODBYE!"   "cya soon".   I hung up the phone and chucked it on the table. Is this girl trying to ruin my life! Carly is a great person we were friends since  we were both 13 years old but after 18 she won't stop winging about finding the 'right' guy. Im 24 years old now and I still don't care about guys. Im quite happy in my comfy little house with my pool, its very relaxing, except my job as a kindey gardner carer. I know I'm not an ugly girl. I have short blonde hair and green eyes. A few years ago I went out to the pub and a guy came up to me. he seemed nice though and he was good looking so we started to talk for a bit. But when I walked back to my car at night from the bar the same guy was behind me, he tried to assult me but luckily a person heard me scream and bashed the crap out of him. All my life guys have been attracted to me and at one point I hated them. Since that night 3 years ago I haven't been out since. And won't walk home alone in the darkness or in the brightest light of day.   I walked over to the bench and grabbed my car keys and phone, then ran up to my room to get a wet weather jacket. It was pooring out side, but I like it when it rains especially going to bed and hearing the raindrops thud on your roof, it just sounds relaxing. I made sure that all the windows were locked. My neighbourhood is nice but it is a target for robbery, only a few weeks ago i got robbed while sleeping in my room, only because the loungeroom window was a few inches open, so they managed to open it up and sneek in, luckily nothing important was taken, just a camera and a clock. What dumbass would steal a clock though? I grabbed my 'calerie' bar and eventually got outside and locked the door.    It was really dark outside and it was raining moderate. I started to laugh to myself for some reason because I love the rain that much. I quickly ran to my car and hopped in. Carlys house was about 15minutes away so i thought some music would be nice. I ran through the disks, anastasia... next, gwen stefani.... next what about katy perry? ok.    I started up the engine and drove off. The road was quite slippery and my windshield wipers were not doing a good job. When i looked out I saw the fuzzy yellow lights as the drivers drove past. I took a few bites of my chocolate bar, i wasn't much of a chocholic I only enjoyed it when i was stressed out. "stupid pot hole! I yelled as i drove over it knocking my bar to the floor. I reached down keeping one hand on the wheel taking my eyes of the road for a second. Got it! I looked back up and there in the road stood a little figure. I slammed on the brakes. But it was too late. And a big bang smacked on the front of my windshield shattering bits of the front windshield some hitting me in the face.    As the car finally stopped i froze. I could'nt move an inch. I quickly reached up to the light in the car and turned it on. And froze again as I saw blood on my face from part of the windshield glass. Just under my right eye was a big patch of blood. I was to scared to look back at what I just hit. I reached to the console and grabbed my torch i use for emergencies. I slowly opened the door with trembling legs and turned on the torch. I walked over to where a black figure lay and shone the torch over the body. I gasped as I saw a little girl twitching and covered in blood. I started to cry and slowly walked up to her. Her face was covered in blood and her head was also twitching. I walked closer and dropped to my knees. "Im so sorry" I started to cry and hugged the little dying girl.

A Winter Poem      I showed him the poem I wrote   that afternoon, it was called   The Sunflower and was the    most beautiful thing anyone had ever seen      He read it slowly, tasted the flavour of   each word, then quietly set it    down on the table      Your poem is very   beautiful, he said, and   I can see the sunflower in the field,   feel it’s desire to follow the sun      I too would like to spend my days   following the sun      In fact   I would much rather do that   than sit with you and read poems,   or even write them   knowing now the sunflower   has long turned   to    dust.

But I noticed that it had a roll of what looks to be already exposed film.  Now, from what I can tell the film itself has been discontinued in production, and is hard to find, which is a shame.  What I want to know is where I can find someone to develop the film I found in the camera.  I know it's probably a long shot, as I don't know how it was kept or how long ago it was actually made, but I'd still like to get it developed none the less.      Thanks in advance!

20090226075725AAqYpTQ	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Im 19 but feel like the world is coming?	To an end soon. In my mind it is dark, weary and drained. I used to be very naive. For the last four years of my life. Ive just sat back and tried to make sense of things. Just observed and watched things happen. I lived in my room all this time. But when im out im just very dissatisfied at whats happening around me. I dont find any intrinsic value in anything. Ive seen what life is all about. And the behaviour and narcisissm of everybody else just disgusts me. Ive come to the conclusion that there is no fundamental purpose in life. Its just an experience and you can choose to focus on things around you to hold on to as a purpose. The correct purpose is to accept God and his commands. You can either choose to live by that purpose of worshipping God and using this life to obtain a better in the hereafter, or choose to make the best out of this experience and indulge in what the world has to offer. Accepting that it is pointless in the picture as a whole, but you'd still enjoy it. So im stuck between deciding how i would like to spend my remaining 40-50 plus (hopefully) years. I need to take an executive decision. But i really dont feel young at all. Im smart, good lucking, decent personality. But Im not at all interested in anything around me. Im not holy, but i feel that there is a God and he has made the world as such. It feels as if everything is about to come crashing down and to an end in my mind. Life is imperfect. Thats why im not excited by it at all. Like im getting a raw deal, and not the complete, genuine thing.

20090226075101AAR6rzS	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Story ideas? please help!?	I had a dream last night. I don't remember much of it: just snippets of images. I kinda wanted 2 write a story but I had nothing 2 inspire me but now I'm like kinda fascinated by this dream so I wanna write something about my dream LOL lame idea, I know. Here're some of the images I can remember:   1 A delicate wrist. It probably belonged to a girl. A strong hand (probably a guy's) was holding it against the wall. I could only see the wall, wrist & hand.   2 The moon. It was very beautiful, blue-ish, sparkling, kinda coming out of a wisp of cloud, the clouds looked very smokey if you know what I mean.   3 A girl was crying. Her tears were falling thickly, she was kinda falling to her knees. She had brown hair, brown eyes & fair skin. I guess you could say she was pretty, but she was a bit too... ordinary.   4 The same girl was running, backwards, like somebody was coming at her. She kept tripping over the bushes & stuff, she looked very scared.   5 Sun was shining so brightly it was blinding. A guy was smiling. He smiled brightly too.   6 That girl I saw was kissing a guy, but not the guy who smiled. It was someone else, golden brown hair, icy blue eyes. Very striking guy. The light was dim, it was night & their kiss was very hesitant, like they were afraid to break each other.   Weird, huh?? What is a story I can write based on this?? BTW the atmosphere of the dream was mostly intense. LOL.

I have to write a poem modeling this poem-      Come live with me and be my love,   And we will all the pleasures prove,   That valleys, groves, hills, and fields,   Woods, or steepy mountain yields.      And we will sit upon the rocks,   Seeing the shepherds feed their flocks,   By shallow rivers, to whose falls   Melodious birds sing madrigals.      And I will make thee beds of roses,   And a thousand fragrant posies,   A cap of flowers and a kirtle   Embroider'd all with leaves of myrtle:      A gown made of the finest wool,   Which from our pretty lambs we pull;   Fair lined slippers for the cold,   With buckles of the purest gold:      A belt of straw and ivy buds,   With coral clasps and amber studs;   And if these pleasures may thee move,   Come live with me and be my love.      The shepherd swains shall dance and sing   For thy delight each May morning;   If these delights thy mind may move,   Then live with me and be my love.      It is basically about a man trying to get this lady to come and live with him by gving her all kinds of material things. I have to write a modern day version of it.       It has to follow the same rhyme scheme. (AABB CCDD...)    It must be 6 stanzas. Four lines each.    I also have to write it from a girls' point of view to a guy.      Any ideas would help. I am terrible at writing poems so any help would be great. Thanks.

20090131194322AADPL0f	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I need an idea for my Twilight fanfic?	Hey guys, I'm currently writing a Twilight fanfic about a new vampire that comes to Forks and falls in love with Alice while Jasper is away at Tanya's house.      At one point of the story Spencer (the new character) must for some reason need to avoid Alice even though it's the last thing he'd ever want to do. This is the part I need suggestions for - reasons to avoid Alice.      I've got a lot of material done already but once I hit this part, I realized that what I had originally planned to write doesn't fit so well because the reason of avoiding Alice is not sufficient enough. It sounds corny and over-dramatic. Therefore; I need a new reason/dilemma.      The fanfic takes place after New Moon and before Eclipse.      So far, Alice and Spencer have become best friends. Emmet and Rosalie are "out to college", Jasper is at Tanya's, Bella and Edward are absorbed into each other, and Spencer moves to town and becomes friends with Alice (the third-wheel at the Cullen's table).      What I had originally wrote was that Edward read Spencer's thoughts and threatened to kill him if he took Alice away from Jasper (whom at this point was coming home in 2 weeks). Spencer could easily kill Edward due to his "talent" of telekinesis, but knew that killing Edward would mean losing Alice - which he would not do. Therefore; under Edward's watchful eye he starts avoiding Alice.       Here's exactly what I wrote -   “I know what you’re thinking, Spencer.” He whispered with an icy venom. Then he spun my chair around faster than a heartbeat so that I was inches from his face – his eyes dark and repugnant. He bared his teeth in warning. “If you take Alice away from Jasper, I’ll  kill  you.” He growled. My face remained unchanged, but the pit in my stomach grew more and more immense. “Remember that, nomad.”         Okay, now I need suggestions. I want to keep the above part, but I don't feel like it's a strong enough reason for Spencer to denounce his love for Alice.       Keep in mind;   - Alice and Spencer have become best friends and spend all their time together (mostly because Edward and Bella are at Charlie's all the time so Alice has nothing else to do with her sleepless nights).   - Spencer loves Alice   - Alice loves Spencer, as well as Jasper (because girls are indecisive lol)   - Spencer's talent is telekinesis, he can also put up "walls" to block other consciousness to enter his mind. Although if he's not concentrated they can falter (which is how Edward broke through)   - Spencer has his own home on the other side of town in the forest as well.   - Spencer used to be a nomad, robbing banks/people with his vampire ability (super strength/speed) as well, he used to feed on humans and came to Forks for a new start. (Alice knows all this already)         Okay, suggestions please? :)      One thing that I was thinking of was getting the Volturi involved - somehow Edward could get them after Spencer; and therefore Spencer must choose between Alice or his own life. Although with Aro's ability to see all thoughts, present and past, causes a problem.      Anyways, any help will be appreciated. Thanks.

20090131200241AAZLvDP	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Hey I am writing a story how does it sound?? NO COPYING MY WORK!?	All Aude wanted was to feel the brush of wind in her face and the gliding sensation of her skates making gentle lines in the ice, over and over again. Step, twirl, twirl, step.   “One, two, three, four. One, two, three.” Her lesson teacher Mrs. Sutoraiku counted.   It was always Aude’s dream to be an ice skater like the ones on TV like Peggy Fleming or Alexander Abt, always twirling and spinning with their delicate outfits. Soon, waiting for all her admirers, they would be watching her with aw as they would soon see her on TV. Soon, but how soon? Would it be days? Months? Years? Or never? She shook her head she shouldn’t think about that, right now her dream would come true, she was sure. Somehow.   “Alright Aude time is up, you can go get changed now.” Mrs. Sutoraiku interrupted her thoughts.   “Aw but I don’t want to.” Replied Aude not for the first time.   “ I know, I know but your mom is waiting, see? You can still practice at home right? You still have the pond near your house and it should be frozen it is still the middle of winter.”   “Okay, I guess I will practice at home.” Said Aude sadly giving up.   She strolled away from the middle of the rink to the edge of the door and to her mom and her shoes. Slowly unlacing her skates to watch the older students shuffle onto the rink to start their practice. After her shoes were on she slowly but surely went out of the building with her mom to go meet her brother sitting in the car.   “You did good today Aude, I noticed how well you were doing on those bunny hop jumps.” Said her mom with little excitement.   “I wasn’t doing bunny hops I already learned those you weren’t watching were you?”   Aude saw her mom’s head droop a little. Her mom always did this, picking her up so late and not having any time to watch her. It was all because of their dad he had left when she was little leaving a huge debt for them to pay for. As a result her mom had to work for more money not just to support her children but also to pay off the debt.   “Its okay mom I’m not upset I was just asking.” She paused thinking on what to say next to make her mother happy again. “How was work?”      how was my writing?? BTW im 12 and a half

20090131175225AAyNdyT	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Please read this poem that I made!! It's called "I Live In The Real World."?	This poem is about what I am going through with my Husband's parents. Can you please tell me what you think, and how you interpret it?      Fairy tales are easier to believe in because the real world makes happily ever after so darks and cold.   Stories always begin with a princess who lingers for a prince to always be there for her to cherish and to hold.   She is kept in a tower to wait for her prince charming to lead her to love his pure, good heart.   Their love is promised to shed the light when they are blind, and nothing will tear their love apart.   Then, the evil forces come into play and they tell Juliet and Romeo that there is no such thing as happily ever after and true love forever.   However, Romeo and Juliet will always hold onto their pure love to make it through the evil forces together.   The villain makes the prince, and the princess’s dream shatter as they try not to see their love so far away.   The Prince promises Juliet that he will forever be there for her to protect her and be there for her everyday.   Juliet feels that the evil forces will force her Prince to be obedient to their regulations, and force them to be apart.   It will kill her to see her Prince listen to others instead of listening to his heart.   He is forced to have some time to think about what shall they do.   Juliet rests heartbroken as she says to herself “Romeo I can’t live with out you”.   Fairy tales always end with a happily ever after, but in reality stories don’t always end so bright.   Juliet said to her mother “Why do people have to force my Romeo to chose their path instead of being my knight?”   “The world is a cruel place” her dear mother told her, but she reassured the Princess that love will always conquer it all.   Juliet brings her broken heart with her as she meets her Prince at the ball.   They danced together so happily, and Romeo told her that he’ll forever love her, and she will always be his beautiful girl.   Then, I woke up and realized that I wish that life would be a fairy tale, but I live in the real world.
20090226074715AAj9L2j	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Trying to find the title of an old-ish book?	It's about two college students who create a computer simulation of the universe. They become totally consumed with it and spend all their time fixing it and changing it, trying to make it perfect.   I don't remember much else except that at the end, they discover a theory for time travel, and the computer recreates that exact theory on it's own. I think one of their names has the word Gold in it.

I am trying to write a realistic account of pastoral nomads in Mongolia at the time of Genghis Khan.

20090131181350AAdlkMZ	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Would you keep reading?	I'm writing a story called 'Mirror'.   My aunt works for a publishing company, so she really wants to help me. But I don't want to present something that isn't worth reading in the first place.      But here's the summary;      She wants too much. She expects perfection just to be disappointed in the end. No one is ever right, and no one is ever worthy of her. She feels as though no one can ever love her the way she wants and deserves to be loved…      But in all reality, it’s her who doesn’t deserve love. And she knows it.      She knows exactly what she’s capable of; destruction to say the least. Manipulative, conniving, intense destruction to say even less. She’s already hurt so many, and refuses to make the same mistake. So she pushes away the ones who might love her to protect them, and sacrifice her own feelings to spare others’.      But what is she to do when he sees through all the games and lies and the fake facades of emotion, even uprooting things she’d never admit to anyone?      But he has a secret too, one that could shatter the both of them entirely if it was ever revealed.   They’re two of a kind, each a past mirror of the other.      What happens when you lose yourself in your reflection?   What happens when your bleak reality just becomes a shared nightmare?            Please tell me what you think!   I'm only thirteen, so sorry if it's a little rough.   But all aside, I welcome all suggestions and constructive criticism;   Praise is cool too :]      Thanks in advance.

20090131184427AAplDrd	Arts & Humanities;Dancing	Training for a dance lift!?	Hello. I'm in a male in a dance production that calls for lifting a female into the air, her stomach facing down, and my arms completely outstreched above me. The only momentum I'm currently getting is her running start into my hands, and as you can guess, I'm having a bit of trouble with the weight.   She's not overweight, but I'm not the most experienced or strong dancer.    Might you know any good ways to train for a lift like this, or any pointers of the actual process? (I plan on doing ordinary squats, so far).   Thank you in advance!
