AunZaJOEaa	Thats good. Oats are a great breakfast and a ham and cheese panini sounds yummy.|`|ensojBFHaa	Oats are good but maybe try adding some fruit to that like sliced banana or strawberries. <br>  <br>  Ham and cheese aren't good for you... cheese especially is just pure fat and cholesterol. Maybe try having a wholemeal sandwich instead with lots of salad in and something like humous and avacado.<br>  <br>  Assuming you're still going to eat dinner, be sure to try and get a variety of fruit and veg in your diet. Nuts and seeds are also great for snacking on.|`|nTU85LLJaa	Very unhealthy: <br>  <br>  Breakfast is the most important meal of the day after the many hours of "Fasting" at night.

7O3r2QuHaa	i think so. life is about people. other people. we are meant to be connected...and isolation can harm individuals greatly. of course there are introverts and extroverts....but every needs love. Not necessarily a relationship... but everyone needs to be able to love, and everyone wants to be loved.  just show love to other people, and many times they will love you.
oGFNIQdIaa	my advice is drink alot of water.. i have same problem... but i dont know how much it takes... also i know that onion( not preparated) is good in water retention|`|0SPdcLKEaa	How post baby are you?  I ask this because it may not actually be water retention from sodium at all.  It could just be noticing your body shape is different from prepregnancy.  The best advice that I can give to help firm things up is aerobic exercise with exercise to help tone.  The most important thing to remember when doing your aerobic exercise is to make sure you are breathing properly.  If you can't carry on a converstation while exercising you are doing too much and need to slow down.  Oxygen burns fat!  Then alternate that with exercises that focused on your core.  An exercise ball would be great.  Of course all the same stuff everyone else will say a balanced diet.  Another thing that I have tried is a supplement with green tea; it helps curb appetite and gives you more energy.  If you are breat feeding though the extra cafeine can be hard on the little one.  I hope this helps.
Qxh1kPLfaa	I have been dealing with the same thing for 12+ years.  M I L loved to slip my allergens into foods that usually do not contain my allergen.  I finally sought council from a professional.  I'm basing my answers on what I learned there.<br>  <br>  1.  She is not having trouble learning.  She is doing it on purpose.<br>  2.  Never and I mean never eat anything she cooks <br>  3.  If you must eat there, always bring your own food and never leave it unattended around her.<br>  4.  It is NOT you in the wrong.  She has bigger issues.  You and your allergies are just her dumping ground.  If you didn't have allergies, it would be something else.|`|Hue313M3aa	Totally understand your side. You could take your dinner and then you could all eat together.|`|nUGvaPJBaa	You totally done the right thing! <br>  Maybe you should invite her over for dinner? That way, you do the cooking and she still gets to see her son :)<br>  <br>  Good luck xox|`|AA11508016	I agree with Moo completely!<br>  <br>  A few questions for you:<br>  <br>  Do you carry epi-pens? <br>  If not, start! Over 80% of people who die of anaphylaxis do so because they didn't think they need to carry epi-pens. Also, Always have two, in case one fails.<br>  <br>  Has your MIL ever seen you have an allergic reaction that required an epi-pen?<br>  If you eat her food, and need and epi-pen and a trip to the ER, and she gets to see it all go down, she MIGHT change her tune a little bit.<br>  <br>  Do you have an emergency action plan written out for you from your allergist?<br>  In an emergency action plan, it will dictate when to take benedryl, when to take the epi-pen, and when and how long to stay in the ER for observation.<br>  In ever EAP that I have ever seen, if you have hive and throat swelling together, it calls for the epi-pen and either a four or six hour hospital stay. In a reaction that effects two systems of the body (throat and skin in this case), it is classified as anaphylaxis and can turn deadly in a matter of seconds.<br>  <br>  ADD:<br>  I'm really glad you carry your epis. It IS amazing how many people think it can't happen to them.|`|688a7b812dded24c0867e947aee9d86aaa	I again agree with Moo.  My son has similar allergies to milk and egg and they are in a lot of foods.  Even when I check ahead and am assured there will be food for him, I STILL tuck some food away for him, just in case.   When I get there, I also ask to check ALL labels and ask about every step of the preparation... shared pans, oils, cutting surfaces, utensils, etc.   If I am not satisfied with what I see, then he eats the food we brought for him.<br>  <br>  Tonight we are going to a pizza shop that offers Vegan pizza.  Since egg and milk are a no-no for Vegans, it should be fine.  But when we get there, I am going to double check all the utensils, pans, etc.<br>  <br>  While egg and milk are not on the menu for Vegans, it's not the same as an allergy.  Contact with milk, cheese, egg, etc. won't "kill" a  Vegan.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, the person with the allergy (or the parent if it's a kid) has to take full responsibility for what they put in their mouth.  If you can't trust the source, then don't eat it.  <br>  <br>  It amazes me that so many people do not take food allergies seriously.  It's not like an itchy nose, rash, etc...|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	It wouldn't cease to amaze me if she was cooking those things just to TRY And kill you. Avoid her like the plague. He needs to get out of that house. She is just being rude and selfish. Eat at home.
dHH4Rl2yaa	That does sound like problem you should talk to your doctor about.  Birth control probably would only make the situation better.  It helps to regulate periods and helps you know when they are coming.  Try to sit down and talk to your mother about it.  Let her know it will only help you.  Birth control doesn't always mean you are sexually active.|`|Ljqgbtxvaa	Okay, so you are probably feeling so crappy and tired because you have lost too much blood.

upvLAyyzaa	Very long route....<br>  <br>  A psychiatrist is a physician who specializes in psychiatry.<br>  <br>  Education and training. Formal education and training requirements for physicians are among the most demanding of any occupation—4 years of undergraduate school, 4 years of medical school, and 3 to 8 years of internship and residency, depending on the specialty selected. A few medical schools offer combined undergraduate and medical school programs that last 6 years rather than the customary 8 years.<br>  <br>  Premedical students must complete undergraduate work in physics, biology, mathematics, English, and inorganic and organic chemistry. Students also take courses in the humanities and the social sciences. Some students volunteer at local hospitals or clinics to gain practical experience in the health professions.<br>  <br>  The minimum educational requirement for entry into medical school is 3 years of college; most applicants, however, have at least a bachelor’s degree, and many have advanced degrees. There are 146 medical schools in the United States—126 teach allopathic medicine and award a Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) degree; 20 teach osteopathic medicine and award the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.) degree.<br>  <br>  Acceptance to medical school is highly competitive. Applicants must submit transcripts, scores from the Medical College Admission Test, and letters of recommendation. Schools also consider an applicant’s character, personality, leadership qualities, and participation in extracurricular activities. Most schools require an interview with members of the admissions committee.<br>  <br>  Students spend most of the first 2 years of medical school in laboratories and classrooms, taking courses such as anatomy, biochemistry, physiology, pharmacology, psychology, microbiology, pathology, medical ethics, and laws governing medicine. They also learn to take medical histories, examine patients, and diagnose illnesses. During their last 2 years, students work with patients under the supervision of experienced physicians in hospitals and clinics, learning acute, chronic, preventive, and rehabilitative care. Through rotations in internal medicine, family practice, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, psychiatry, and surgery, they gain experience in the diagnosis and treatment of illness.<br>  <br>  Following medical school, almost all M.D.s enter a residency—graduate medical education in a specialty that takes the form of paid on-the-job training, usually in a hospital. Most D.O.s serve a 12-month rotating internship after graduation and before entering a residency, which may last 2 to 6 years.<br>  <br>  A physician’s training is costly. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, in 2004 more than 80 percent of medical school graduates were in debt for educational expenses.|`|BuJIQ8Jhaa	First you take a major in premed then you go to medical school, and after that there is at least a year or two of specializing in psychiatry.  I used to tell people I was going to be a psychiatrist.  It was impressive to the chicks.  Unfortunately my grades weren't good enough to get into med school.|`|67NqWxuGaa	You could research this answer yourself  and if you want to become a psychiatrist, you better get used to thinking for yourself and research...<br>  Here is the process, you first have to go to undergraduate school for four years after hight school, and study science classes that are prerecquisites to medical school.<br>  Then you have to maintain a high grade point average...<br>  Then you have to apply to medical school, and go thru medical school...<br>  Then you have to intern somewhere and specialize in psychiatry... another couple years... <br>  then you have to pass all the exams, then you can practice...

If yes, have you ever considered testing to  see if you have ADD (attention deficit disorder), I just thought I'd copy and paste some information on this for you, so you can have a little idea of what ADD is, if you didn't already know (info is below).<br>  <br>  I feel for you, because my husband and daughter have ADD and when I read your question it made me think of them.  They found something  that really helped them, my husband had started out on some prescribed meds, but the side effects were so harsh that he couldn't stay on them so he's trying something else now. He was scared to try any other kind of prescriptions because of all the horror stories we kept hearing about these drugs.  So he decided to give a certain alternative treatment a try and for him and my daughter it works well.  Anyways, my aim is not to sell you anything here. So back to my answer.  I just wanted to tell you that having problems concentrating like this,  that's one of the symptoms of having ADD and I know that it can be hellish to live a life with that.  My husband only was diagnosed with this 5 months ago.  He was in tears, when given the chance to feel how it is to have a quiet mind and full focus, he hadn't realized how hard he had struggled all his life with this condition.  Just to show how there is an improvemen: he loves to play the violin and in the last 3 months, his progress doubled, my husband after 10 years of marriage kept eye contact with me, was attentive for the first time. It helped us in so many ways to find out that my daughter and husband had ADD because it helped me understand a lot of the things they did.  A person that has ADD, can be very easily, sadly, typically perceived as a lazy person, a person that starts out many projects that they never finish, and now knowing this I feel horible to have felt frustrated with them about these things, I thought they were always just trying to get out of doing things or just acting in ways to purposely frustrate me.. I won't go on too long about our personal story just in case I am way off base here. But wanted to express, that if you do have ADD, that I understand and that there are a good variety of meds and alternative treatments out there that can help you.<br>  <br>  Here is the copied and pasted info on ADD: (hope it helps)<br>  <br>  ADHD stands for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. ADHD used to be known as attention deficit disorder, or ADD. In 1994, it was renamed ADHD. The term ADD is sometimes still used, though, to describe a type of ADHD that doesn't involve hyperactivity.<br>  <br>  ADHD is a medical condition that affects how well someone can sit still, focus, and pay attention. People with ADHD have differences in the parts of their brains that control attention and activity. This means that they may have trouble focusing on certain tasks and subjects, or they may seem "wired," act impulsively, and get into trouble.<br>  <br>  Symptoms and Signs of ADHD<br>  Although ADHD begins in childhood, sometimes it's not diagnosed until a person is a teen — and occasionally not even until someone reaches adulthood.<br>  <br>  Because ADHD is a broad category covering different things — attention, activity, and impulsivity — it can show up in different ways in different people. Some of the signs of ADHD are when someone:<br>  <br>  has difficulty paying attention or staying focused on a task or activity <br>  has problems finishing assignments at school or home and jumps from one activity to another <br>  has trouble focusing on instructions and difficulty following through <br>  loses or forgets things such as homework <br>  is easily distracted, even when doing something fun <br>  has problems paying close attention to details or makes careless mistakes <br>  has trouble organizing tasks and activities <br>  has difficulty waiting one's turn <br>  interrupts or intrudes on other people <br>  blurts out answers before questions have been completed <br>  fidgets with hands or feet or squirms about when seated <br>  feels restless <br>  talks excessively and has trouble engaging in activities quietly

9pLdhuBnaa	The reason that you have the headache after the reflexology session is because of the fact that it was moving the toxins out.<br>  <br>  It is best to have the water after you get the reflexology or massage because that helps to push the toxins out.  <br>  <br>  If the headache doesn't clear up in a few days I would recommend seeing your doctor for further evaluation of the situation.
VGhmc0dOaa	Ok, so I wouldn't be concerned about not eating breakfast and lunch- some people just don't have big appetites!<br>  But you also mentioned that sometimes when you're upset you go a day or two without food- that could potentially be a problem. Why do you go without food when you're upset? Is it because when you're upset you genuinely have no appetite? or is it because you feel fat and need to loose weight? <br>  If you frequently go without food because you think your fat then that is potentially an eating disorder. However, if you're just one of those people who have a small appetite, then its not an eating disorder.<br>  So basically...<br>  If you think you need to loose weight- could be an eating disorder<br>  If you're just not hungry- not an eating disorder

Not alone.<br>  I can totally relate to what you are saying.

There are natural resources that can help to raise these,   food sources containing Vitamin B's,    supplements such as GABA.     or you could be prescribed medications,  if the problem is really severe.

ItJzrvQ4aa	There should be method in training those pectoralis muscles. The<br>  overall shape and development of the chest is a product of the<br>  exercises you choose and how those exercises are incorporated into<br>  your overall chest workout. Ignoring certain exercises or<br>  concentrating solely on one type of chest exercise can lead you to pec<br>  imbalances. The most common type of "imbalance" with the chest is<br>  deficient upper pec development. This is common in those individuals<br>  who fail to incorporate incline bench presses into their training or<br>  save them until the end of their chest workout, when the clock has<br>  struck twelve and their chest has turned into a pumpkin. <br>  There are 3 distinct regions within the muscle that will develop<br>  depending upon the exercises you perform. It is important that you<br>  train the upper, middle and lower regions of the pectoralis muscle, as<br>  well as begin with the exercise which focuses on the weakest area of<br>  your chest. For most people that's the upper chest. And for this<br>  reason, we begin our workout with the incline movement. <br>  Begin the workout with 5 minutes of stretching using 5-10 pound<br>  weights in each hand. With weights in hand, lie on a flat bench and<br>  allow your fully extended arms to dip down to the floor. This<br>  stretches out the pecs and prepares your chest for the workout ahead.<br>  Then, for each exercise perform 1-2 light warm-up sets of 15<br>  repetitions using a light weight which allows you to effectively warm<br>  up the muscles for that particular movement without causing premature<br>  fatigue. After the warm-up, perform 4 sets of the exercise with the<br>  following repetitions: 12, 10, 8, 6. Gradually increase the weight<br>  with each set. The weight you choose should allow you to complete the<br>  desired number of repetitions for each set, but the weight should also<br>  be sufficient so that the final few reps demand the most out of your<br>  pecs. Having a spotter for safety as well as assisting in a forced rep<br>  or two is a definite advantage. <br>  Exercise 1 - Incline Bench Press <br>  This exercise will help you develop the weakest area of your chest,<br>  at least with most of us... the upper chest. Beginning your workout<br>  with this exercise will allow you to use maximum power from your upper<br>  chest to force that chest to grow! Keep the movement slow and<br>  controlled while getting full movement, bringing the bar or dumbbells<br>  all the way down, then all the way to the top. While you press the<br>  weight up your primary focus should be on squeezing your chest. <br>  <br>  <br>  Exercise 2 - Decline Bench Press <br>  This exercise is excellent for developing the lower aspect of your<br>  chest. This exercise has a tendency to really work those triceps too<br>  so remember to focus on squeezing the chest. Avoiding complete lockout<br>  of your elbows will also decrease your triceps involvement. <br>  <br>  <br>  Exercise 3 - Flat Dumbbell Flys <br>  This is an excellent exercise to finish off your chest workout. It is<br>  an isolation movement which places complete focus on the pectoralis<br>  muscles. This is because it consists of pure arm adduction which is<br>  the primary movement performed by the pectoralis muscles. Start by<br>  lying on a flat bench with your arms fully extended above your chest<br>  with your palms facing each other and elbows slightly bent. Bring the<br>  weights down towards the floor while maintaining the slight elbow<br>  flexion. Stop when you feel your arms are close to locking out. Then<br>  squeeze your pecs as you bring the weights back to the starting<br>  position. The entire movement should be 100% focused on squeezing the<br>  pecs together... as if you had an egg between your pecs and you were<br>  attempting to crack the shell as you squeezed those pecs together. <br>  <br>  Remember these important points to maximize your pectoralis gains: <br>  Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze the chest and nothing else. On every<br>  repetition of your chest routine you must focus on squeezing the<br>  chest... do this and the weight will go in the appropriate direction.<br>  <br>  <br>  Be sure to perform a full motion but don't over do it. Getting a good<br>  stretch with each exercise is important... however, when you're<br>  handling heavier weights don't completely lock out your joints in the<br>  down position as this places a great deal of stress on ligaments,<br>  joint capsules and other supporting structures.<br>  <br>  <br>  Push-ups are good if you can't make it to the gym or if you're out of<br>  town and can't get to a gym. They work the pecs but they are<br>  definitely no replacement for the real thing. They simply do not<br>  provide the quality and quantity of resistance that free weights give.<br>  <br>  <br>  Never attempt to "max out" or try a new heavier weight without a<br>  spotter. Remember this cardinal rule especially when using barbells to<br>  prevent a potentially serious injury.

But run, you will lose more weight due to running than any number of push ups, stationary bicycle rides, crunches, or pull ups.<br>  though I do recommend crunches for a flat stomach.<br>  <br>  So in a nut shell:<br>  - Eat a large lunch, very modest dinner. Maybe no more than a sandwich.<br>  - Run every other day. Or at least three times a week.<br>  - Do crunches, and push ups if possible.<br>  <br>  You will be in great shape in no time.|`|Hx0a0Q8Uaa	I started swimming. Before I had my youngest I was able to lose 40 pounds and keep it off without any dieting at all. Every morning (5 days a week) I would swim, I'd use fins and a board and i'd do 72 pool lengths (1/2 a lap)  of an Olympic size pool  that = 1mile it took me 45 mins <br>  By using just a board and fins you swim flat therefore you work out every muscle in your body and you can't even feel it until it's bed time. The only changes I made to my diet was, I ate a small breakfast before my swim (usually a banana and a boiled egg or a bowl of cereal) and I would wait at least 1 hour before eating after my swim. After that i'd eat normally <br>  <br>  To start out I suggest only doing 25-30 lengths and work your way up by 5 lengths everyday|`|fkqPs9QRaa	I never had a problem with my weight, but I control it easily by doing sports and mostly by running ( i built my way up from short to longer distances)|`|QsrX5CY3aa	I lost 33 pounds with a diet that involves increased levels of protein and fiber and an natural weight loss supplement called Hoodia.  Back in 04 I had to have back surgery and was laying on my back for 22 months recovering and I got a little fat in the process.  I couldn;t take one more day of looking in the mirror and seeing a fat *** staring back and I decided to do something about it.  My buddy mark is kind of a fitness nut and I asked him what he suggested.  He told me he had heard good things about hoodia.  If you've never heard of it, (I hadn't either) Hoodia is an all natural herbal supplement that was used initially in South Africa by the native tribes there when they'd go hunting and such because they couldn't carry a lot of food and supplies and because it pretty much eliminated hunger and appetite.  I research it and found out that a  company called Desert Burn had the best brand out there.  I got some and literally the first day I forgot to eat, plus that light headed feeling you get when dieting and that weakness didn;t occur when I took it either. I have kept my weight off for over three years now and I swear by the stuff. If you'd like GOOGLE: online health desert burn hoodia ; Only 100% hoodia gordonii is the oone that works and Desert Burn is that kind.  All my best to you and good luck.|`|K1Uvl2kXaa	well i eat really healthy and eat alot of protien. well if sometimes i want chips and i eat them, i just burn them off from how many sports i do. i do 2 soccer teams, track team,softball team, and 2 hip hop performing groups. so just do alot of sports and it burns your fat off.im only 13 and i already have well defined abs also drink lots of water and ignore the pop.|`|6b7KFgtpaa	I visited two websites.<br>  <br>  www.crossfit.com<br>  www.paleofood.com<br>  <br>  I strongly encourage you to give crossfit a look.

Make promises to quit, have nic fits, stop, start, backslide, nicoderm patches, gain weight due to oral fixations, become irritable and essentially have to build a tower of iron will to fight the urgest to avoid a 90% recidivism rate.<br>  <br>  How to REALLY QUIT SMOKING.  Start thinking like an athlete.  It isn't recommended by the surgeon general. it IS recommended by Runner's World.  Doctors are afraid everyone will have heart attacks and sue.  If you do this right you will hate smoking, get fit, get addicted to exercise, live longer, reduce stress, improve your eyesight, clean out your lungs and have a good time along with bragging rights.<br>  <br>  Sign up for an athletic event such as a 10K or a half marathon.  Preparing for the event becomes the goal, and quitting smoking, losing weight, being healthy happen along the way with no conscious effort on your part.  Just train to finish that race.<br>  <br>  Start running an EASY 30 minutes, 3-4 times a week. (heart rate in the 137-144 BPM range).  Increase the time you run by no more that 10% per week. In 12 weeks you're running for an hour and a half -- that's at least 8 miles each time. If you can run 8 miles at conversational pace (zone 2 above) then you can certainly finish a 13 mile half marathon.  In 16 weeks you'll be capable of doing a sub 4 hour marathon.<br>  (You can get a heart rate monitor for $40 that should do the trick and there are articles about "training in zone 2" all over the internet.)  To avoid injury, take 2 days off a week.  If something starts to hurt (besides your lungs and your sides) below the waist, slow down or walk.<br>  <br>  Now after the first 5 days and 18 hard miles later you can run 30 minutes non-stop.  You want a cigarette -- there is nothing to stop you except that 1 cigarette will wipe out 10% of your conditioning for the week.  Smoke 10 and you wasted the entire week of exercise and your ability to run 3 miles/30 minutes non-stop has been washed down the tubes.  If you want a cigarette, go find your running shoes and run till the feeling goes away if you can.  If you can't run, remind yourself that you're going to destroy your conditioning very quickly if you even put a hand on that cigarette.  My guess is that if you have success in running the first week and you are actually of the mind that you are training for a race in lets say 12 weeks, SMOKING is the LAST thing you'll be considering.<br>  <br>  By the way you can do cycling or swimming instead but not all people have access to a bike or pool and there are fewer of those events to enter.  There's a 5K, or 10K race every Saturday within 10 miles of anyone.<br>  <br>  To help you get started, check out "Chi running" by Danny Dryer or check videos of people that practice Chi Running.  For swimming check out Total Immersion by Terry Laughlin.<br>  <br>  I think the endorphins released from endurance sports help override nicotine's grip.  After you've been running for a while you have waaay too much to lose, and if you take a drag from a cigarette I guarantee, you'll start to puke up your gatorade.<br>  <br>  So ask yourself -- do you have $10 for that 5K in 3 weeks? GO FOR IT!  <br>  <br>  P.S. And put your son in a jogging stroller so he can go with you! They fall asleep after about 2 miles.|`|T1CuRwm3aa	Get Certs by the case and eat one each time you want a smoke.|`|12VQ4ETcaa	My dad quit smoking cold turkey after 30 years, ages 13 to 43.

Not only did we both quit ... now over a year and neither of us have even thought of smoking... but also I talked my sister into trying it and it worked for her also. She has the willpower of a goldfish.  (Sorry sis, I love ya) But it is true.  Of course like everything else in the world, nothing works for everybody and you really do have to want to quit.

To have the best chance of success in quitting, you need to know what you’re up against, what your options are, and where to go for help. You'll find this information here.<br>  <br>  Why is it so hard to quit smoking?<br>  <br>  Mark Twain said, "Quitting smoking is easy. I've done it a thousand times." Maybe you've tried to quit, too. Why is quitting and staying quit hard for so many people? The answer is nicotine.<br>  <br>  Nicotine<br>  <br>  Nicotine is a drug found naturally in tobacco. It is highly addictive -- as addictive as heroin or cocaine. Over time, a person becomes physically and emotionally addicted to (dependent on) nicotine. Studies have shown that smokers must deal with both the physical and psychological (mental) dependence to quit and stay quit.<br>  <br>  How nicotine gets in, where it goes, and how long it stays<br>  <br>  When you inhale smoke, nicotine is carried deep into your lungs. There it is absorbed quickly into the bloodstream and carried throughout your body. Nicotine affects many parts of the body, including your heart and blood vessels, your hormones, your metabolism, and your brain. Nicotine can be found in breast milk and even in mucus from the cervix of a female smoker. During pregnancy, nicotine freely crosses the placenta and has been found in amniotic fluid and the umbilical cord blood of newborn infants.<br>  <br>  Several different factors can affect how long it takes the body to remove nicotine and its by-products. In most cases, regular smokers will still have nicotine or its by-products, such as cotinine, in their bodies for about 3 to 4 days after stopping.<br>  <br>  How nicotine hooks smokers<br>  <br>  Nicotine produces pleasant feelings that make the smoker want to smoke more. It also acts as a kind of depressant by interfering with the flow of information between nerve cells. As the nervous system adapts to nicotine, smokers tend to increase the number of cigarettes they smoke. This, in turn, increases the amount of nicotine in the smoker's blood. After a while, the smoker develops a tolerance to the drug. Tolerance means that it takes more nicotine to get the same effect that the smoker used to get from smaller amounts. This leads to an increase in smoking over time. The smoker reaches a certain nicotine level and then keeps smoking to maintain this level of nicotine. In fact, nicotine inhaled in cigarette smoke reaches the brain faster than drugs that enter the body intravenously (IV).<br>  <br>  Nicotine withdrawal symptoms can lead quitters back to smoking<br>  <br>  When smokers try to cut back or quit, the lack of nicotine leads to withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal is both physical and mental. Physically, the body reacts to the absence of nicotine. Mentally, the smoker is faced with giving up a habit, which calls for a major change in behavior. The physical and mental both must be addressed for the quitting process to work.<br>  <br>  Those who have smoked regularly for a few weeks or longer, and suddenly stop using tobacco or greatly reduce the amount smoked, will have withdrawal symptoms. Symptoms usually start within a few hours of the last cigarette and peak about 2 to 3 days later when most of the nicotine and its by-products are out of the body. Withdrawal symptoms can last for a few days to up to several weeks.<br>  <br>  Withdrawal symptoms can include any of the following:<br>  <br>      * dizziness (which may only last 1 to 2 days after quitting)<br>      * depression<br>      * feelings of frustration, impatience, and anger<br>      * anxiety<br>      * irritability<br>      * sleep disturbances, including having trouble falling asleep and staying asleep, and having bad dreams or even nightmares<br>      * trouble concentrating<br>      * restlessness<br>      * headaches<br>      * tiredness<br>      * increased appetite<br>  <br>  These symptoms can lead the smoker to start smoking cigarettes again to boost blood levels of nicotine back to a level where there are no symptoms. (For information on coping with withdrawal, see the section, "How to quit.")<br>  <br>  Smoking also makes your body get rid of certain drugs faster than usual. When you quit smoking, it changes the way your body handles some medicines. Ask your doctor if any medicines you take regularly need to be checked or changed after you quit.<br>  <br>  Why should I quit?<br>  <br>  Your health<br>  <br>  Health concerns usually top the list of reasons people give for quitting smoking. This is a very real concern: About half of all smokers who keep smoking will end up dying from a smoking-related illness.<br>  <br>  Cancer<br>  <br>  Nearly everyone knows that smoking can cause lung cancer, but few people realize it is also a risk factor for many other kinds of cancer too, including cancer of the mouth, voice box (larynx), throat (pharynx), esophagus, bladder, kidney, pancreas,|`|kB4EJUKgaa	I don't smoke, but 5 months ago I lost my mother to lung cancer. She smoked since she was in her teens as well. Use that as motivation for quitting. It is one of the best things you could ever do for yourself, and for your son. <br>  <br>  Quitting smoking is a mental thing as much as it is a physical thing. You can use the nicotine substances like patches and gum to suppress that urge but substitute activities during the day for smoking. Like if you smoke going to work, call a friend instead. Or eat a granola bar or something to keep your hands busy. If you smoke after you eat meals, maybe play a game with your son instead. Showing him that you'd rather be playing a game with him instead of smoking will show him that you're really committed to it, regardless of his age. <br>  <br>  Hope some of that helps, and GOOD LUCK!!!!!

QluBTwCvaa	You go to their supervisors. If you are not happy you go higher. Hospitals have a department for consumer complaints.  I had a friend who has been diagnosed with muscular dystrophy. He lives on a partial diability of  just over $600 per month. Needless to say his wardrobe could use some more money spent. He needs loose clothing to be able to move freely.  He wears boots to give his ankles support so he can walk and so he won't have to wear some kind of braces.  When my father was in the hospital I left a message for him to come and see me there. I forgot to tell him the new room number. He went to the intensive care waiting room where he had been with me another night. When he could not remember my father's first name security took him out of the hospital.  Someone had reported him as a homeless man running around the hospital because of his clothing.  They told him if he did not leave the hospital they would call the police.  I saw him leaving through the window but my father required constant attention, and I could not leave to catch him. I thought he just could not find me. I did not know that they took him to the security office and questioned him before kicking him out.  The hospital's public relations office heard from me.  So did a lot of other people.<br>  <br>  Hidden within this new stimulus package is something that is really going to make it hard to get complaints heard. They killed my father, called it hastening the death.The day before they said he was grouchy from sleep deprivation. So he goes to sleep and they call him unresponsive.I left for twenty four hours and came back to my brother having been talked into signing papers. Reheboam and his foolish counselors. I stayed with Daddy for 5 hours while they dehydrated him and depressed his breathing with morphine and left him on his back with sleep apnea. They had him all wrapped up from water retention but that was down and the man needed fluids and nourishment and normal after surgery care. Those in government want to push this thing through in the middle of the stimulus package where they will decide whether or not your family gets medical care. I helped my daddy breathe by a simple life saving technique of pulling his jaw forward, until someone struck me knocking my hand loose and my father's head sideways. He seemed to be able to breathe freely in that position then so I let it go. Anyway I struggle to forgive them, including my brother. I warn you that according to a radio interview of one who should know, 30% of the deaths in Holland are by euthanasia.

Lymph nodes can remain swollen for weeks after the original illness has left the body, so don't be overly concerned if you are otherwise healthy.  However, if you are ill and you do not improve within a few days or get worse rapidly I would recommend seeing your doctor right away.<br>  <br>  A few things to consider also... the fact that it is hurting is actually a good sign.  It is when you find painless growths that there is cause for concern.  Also, lymph nodes around the neck are the most commonly enlarged as they are responsible for helping drain out your sinuses and ear.  <br>  <br>  If your throat really bothers you, you may want to try a warm salt water gargle several times a day.

This type of infection is bad news because it can lead to deposits of bacteria and cells on the heart valves long after the infection is gone, that can in turn lead to heart failure due to inefficient valve function.

That's rather natural actually.  Even with weight lifting or running or whatever you kinda hit that imaginary barrier and it's hard to break through to the next phase of your personal weight loss mission. I went to a wedding on hoodia and lost weight so you should have no problems.  The best way to lose weight is to control your appetite and the best way to do that that I know of is with hoodia.  When I was dieting (and believe me I still watch my weight even though I have achieved my weight loss goals for the most part) I realized right off that the most important thing is to control your appetite.  If your stomach's not always growling and your not always craving food it is sooo much easier to stick to your guns and stay on your diet.  With hoodia I would literally go a whole day sometimes and simply forget to eat and I didn't get tired and run down like diets can sometimes make you feel.  Once my appetite was under control and I wasn't always thinking about eating then and only then could the weight start coming off consistently and steadily because the hoodia kept my mind off of food and I would go longer on my diet and as I did that naturally I lost weight.  You have to remember that consistency is very important when losing weight.  If you cut back a little on your food consumption everyday your body will change (stomach will shrink and you won't be eating as much) and with that consistency over a few days, weeks and months you will lose weight just like I did.  Hoodia was my saving grace for all of these factors.  Hope this helps!!!

You may need to lower your calorie intake a little in order to reach your weight loss goal.|`|sdSKerI2aa	Actually, I do not know about weightloss<br>  However, I have site reference about diet pill or weight loss pill and I hope it helps you.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.acaiberryselect.com/splash.php?aid=931107" rel="nofollow">http://www.acaiberryselect.com/splash.ph...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.carallumaburn.com/splash.php?aid=931107" rel="nofollow">http://www.carallumaburn.com/splash.php?...</a> <br>  <br>  There offer you diet pill for weight loss, you get it free for first time.<br>  For example Caralluma, it is patent protected and clinically proven to suppress the appetite. And Acai Berry (fruit of Amazonian Acai Palms) is as a food staple and for their rejuvenating and detoxifying properties.<br>  <br>  So rather than you buy weight loss product first, then you are disappointed with that weight loss pill, then you buy another diet pill again, and this case is time after time, it means that you have lost much your money and without satisfied result ?.<br>  <br>  So I just can say, it is better you try two or more diet pill product free, there is no one to try. Then you compare the result between one diet pill products with another. If one of diet pill work, maybe you want to get it more, or leave it if this diet pill is not satisfied.<br>  <br>  Good luck and success for your diet !!! :)

It produces the hormone thyroxin. This hormone is converted outside of the thyroid gland where it becomes activated and stimulates every one of the trillion cells in the body. Almost all of our systems and functions depend upon receiving adequate amounts of this hormone. The thyroid along with the adrenals is probably the gland most susceptible to the tremendous stress of our fast paced society. It is the thermostat of the body. It produces hormones that work to keep our metabolic rate stable and keep energy-producing processes in balance. The thyroid is essential in protein synthesis, growth, temperature regulation, and oxygen consumption of cells. If the thyroid is depleted or deficient, the rest of the body functions poorly. With low thyroid, cholesterol can shoot up to dangerous levels. <br>  <br>  Thyroid disease, both hyperactive and under-active, is so extraordinarily prevalent today that even by conservative estimates it may strike up to 15 percent of the adult population. Women are particularly susceptible, and the disease tends to run in families. A possible reason for the increase in thyroid disease is the high prevalence of auto-immune disease today. Immunity in general is being assaulted by toxic chemicals in food, water, and air. Under-active or hypothyroid conditions can cause low energy. <br>  <br>  "Yes" answers to the following questions may indicate a hypothyroid condition. <br>  <br>  Are you depressed, lethargic, and easily chilled? <br>  Do you gain weight easily? <br>  Do you suffer from chronic fatigue? <br>  Do you have dry skin, hair loss, eczema, or adult acne? <br>  Do you suffer from muscle aches, constipation, and hoarseness? <br>  Do you have PMS or menstrual abnormalities? Is your libido low? <br>  Are your feet and legs swollen and your nails brittle? <br>  Do you get a lot of colds and flu? Low thyroid results in increased vulnerability to infection. <br>  <br>  A test may be taken at home to find out if the thyroid is low.<br>  For four days keep a thermometer by your bedside. As soon as you wake up in the morning put the thermometer in your armpit for ten minutes. You must do this before you get up. If you get up first you will not get an accurate reading. If your temperature runs below 97.8 then you most likely have low thyroid. It is important to shake the thermometer after each use. <br>  Some of the common causes of low thyroid, besides inheritance, include: iodine depletion, x-rays or low dose radiation, pituitary and thyroid malfunction, air and environmental pollutants, overuse of diet pills and other drugs, and vitamin A, E, and zinc deficiency. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Treatment for Thyroid Disorder<br>  Avoid refined foods, saturated fats, sugars, and white flour products. If the thyroid problem is severe it is then good to avoid brussels sprouts, cabbage, broccoli, kale, mustard greens, peaches and pears as they have anti-thyroid substances and may suppress the thyroid function. <br>  <br>  Follow a diet with at least 50 % of the foods being fresh, and organically grown to rebalance and establish a better metabolism. The enzymes from live foods help the body to maintain proper metabolism. Foods that heal include sprouts, salads, raw vegetables, and thermos cooked grains to retain enzymes which heal and feed the glands. <br>  <br>  Eat foods rich in vitamin A, such as yellow vegetables, eggs, carrots, and dark green vegetables. M.U. Tene is concentrated Beta-Carotene, the precursor to Vitamin A and one of nature's most powerful antioxidants. <br>  <br>  Iodine rich foods that nourish the thyroid are: fish and sea vegetables such as: arame, kelp, dulse, hijike, nori, wakame, and kombu. Seaweeds are very nourishing to the glands. <br>  <br>  Zinc and copper are important in helping the body make thyroid hormone. Foods rich in zinc include: beef (range free), oatmeal, chicken (range free), seafood, dried beans, bran, tuna, spinach, seeds, and nuts. Foods rich in copper include: organ meats (range free), eggs, yeast, legumes, nuts, and raisins. <br>  <br>  The amino acid tyrosine is helpful. Tyrosine is found in edamame, beef, chicken, and fish. Soy should be only used in small amounts or on an occasional basis. <br>  <br>  Black and red radishes have been used by some doctors in the old Soviet Union as accepted medical treatment for hypothyroidism. Raphanin, the main sulphur component in radishes, is chiefly responsible for keeping the production of thyroxine and calcitonin (a peptide hormone) in normal balance. Seeds and nuts, seed and nut milks, vegetable juices (celery, parsley, small amount of carrot, Swiss chard, wheat grass) and plenty of green drinks containing chlorophyll for healthy blood are helpful.

Some types affect the body, so your body feels floaty (or heavy), kind of tingly.  Other types affect your head mostly.  It gives some people energy, while others it causes to sit around feeling mellow/sleepy (this also varies by type).  Some people get silly/laugh a lot.

Even small stupid things you like look at an old book and you relive your childhood for a few minutes. Then you go get something to eat and the 30s second it takes for you to go to a next room feels like an hour long epic journey. Sometimes you feel like a character in a movie, sometimes you feel like a completely different person/race/gender. Sometimes you feel like you've just discovered the meaning of life. When you listen to music it touches you on a different level. You become ONE with the music and when you close your eyes you feel like you are just a passing note in the music and you are playing around with all the other notes.<br>  <br>  And millions of other crazy things that cannot be experienced or even imagined sober.<br>  <br>  I highly recommend it.|`|UnoKRIu7aa	Depends on how much you smoke.

Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.<br>  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.<br>  Do these exercises three to four times a week and within a month<br>  you'll start to see ripples you never knew you had.<br>  Warm-Up: Do three minutes of cardio before your arm routine to<br>  increase your heart rate, loosen your muscles, and help avoid injury.<br>  Jumping rope, climbing stairs, and walking on a treadmill are great<br>  options. Once your torso begins generating a little heat, do two sets<br>  of 24 small (about five inches in diameter) arm circles to warm up<br>  your biceps, triceps, and shoulder muscles. Move your arms forward for<br>  the first set, backward for the second set.<br>  Tip: If you don't have hand weights, use cans of food or water<br>  bottles filled with sand or uncooked rice.<br>  <br>  Push-Pull Kickback<br>  How to Do It: Stand in a squat position, legs shoulder-width apart,<br>  knees bent at about 45 degrees, and chest leaning slightly forward.<br>  Hold a light dumbbell (three to five pounds is a good starting point<br>  for all these exercises) in each hand, palms facing your thighs.<br>  Bending your arms, bring your fists up toward your torso, in front of<br>  your armpits. Push the dumbbells straight out in front of you, fully<br>  extending your arms, knuckles up. Bending your arms, pull them toward<br>  your armpits and extend them back behind you until they're straight<br>  (shown). During this part of the exercise, pretend your upper arms are<br>  glued to your sides to better isolate the triceps. Do three sets of 12<br>  repetitions.<br>  <br>  What It Does: Works your chest and triceps. You'll see results along<br>  the backs of your arms and in the area where your shoulders meet your<br>  chest.<br>  <br>  Shadowboxing<br>  How to Do It: Stand upright, legs spaced slightly wider than your<br>  shoulders, hands in front of your face (like a boxer getting ready for<br>  a bout), with a light dumbbell in each hand. Extend your right fist as<br>  if you were hitting someone in the face, angling the punch toward the<br>  opponent's opposite ear. As you pull your arm back, imagine that<br>  you're ducking an incoming punch and bend your knees into a squat.<br>  Stand and repeat with the other arm. For the next punch, move your<br>  fist in a rapid upward motion, as if hitting someone just under the<br>  chin. Squat, stand, and repeat with the other arm. For the last punch,<br>  extend your arm as if punching someone on the side of the jaw with<br>  your knuckles (shown). Squat, stand, and repeat with the other arm. Do<br>  two to three sets of punches, 10 seconds for each set.<br>  <br>  What It Does: Works your biceps, triceps, shoulders, and upper back<br>  -- the whole package. The squats will develop your glutes and<br>  quadriceps. The rapid and dynamic moves will give your heart a<br>  workout, too.<br>  <br>  Double Biceps Curl<br>  How to Do It: Stand upright, feet close together, knees relaxed. Hold<br>  a dumbbell in each hand, pressing your elbows close to your sides,<br>  palms facing forward. Bend your arms so your forearms form 90-degree<br>  angles in front of you. Squeezing your biceps, slowly lift the weights<br>  up toward your shoulders. Lower your arms to the starting position.<br>  Palms facing up, slowly curl your arms back up, this time to the<br>  outsides of your shoulders (shown). Again, remember to press your<br>  upper arms tightly against your sides to really work the biceps. Do<br>  three sets of 12 reps.<br>  <br>  What It Does: Works the very centers of the biceps from multiple<br>  directions, creating chiseled definition.<br>  <br>  <br>  Standing Push-Up<br>  How to Do It: Stand facing a desk or a sturdy ledge. Place your hands<br>  shoulder-width apart on the surface in a push-up position and place<br>  your body at a 45-degree angle with the floor. Pull your navel inward<br>  and balance your weight on the balls of your feet (shown). With elbows<br>  close to your sides, bend your arms and bring your chest toward the<br>  desk as low as you can, inhaling as you descend. Slowly push yourself<br>  back up to the starting position, exhaling as you rise. Do two to<br>  three sets of 8 to 10 reps. To increase the challenge, do half the<br>  sets underhanded, gripping the desk or the ledge from below. This<br>  focuses the benefits on the lower triceps, which most women have a<br>  particularly hard time firming up. As you improve, intensify the<br>  exercise by moving your hands closer together.<br>  <br>  What It Does: Strengthens your triceps as well as your abdominals and<br>  shoulders, which can improve overall posture.<br>  <br>  Cooldown: Stretch the muscles you just worked to reduce soreness and<br>  maximize flexibility. Sit in a chair, extend your arms in front of<br>  you, one over the other, and clasp your hands to stretch o|`|dXAgTUSraa	Trust me keep on for another 3 weeks and youll see a difference, you can also do a low carb only diet and that will help also.|`|6rvzeOsqaa	if you are losing weight everywhere else except your arms, maybe it's time to think about a little Lypo?|`|bhyVC2mtaa	pushups

I incorporated hiking into my weight loss routine along with taking hoodia and honestly the weight started falling off. It's simple really, is you control your appetite and are eating less and you exercise more it's a great formula to drop as much weight as you desire. What I liked best about hoodia was that I didn't feel like I was dieting. It took away my hunger and I didn't feel all lightheaded and run down like can happen when you cut back caloric intake.

Do they have temps?  Do they have runny noses as well (post nasal drip)?  If they do have excessively runny noses, can use antihistamine to stop the drainage into the back of the throat.  It is possible they need to go on antibiotic after being seen by a physician.
kLN5hx6paa	Not long, a day at max.|`|1kmnTcWDaa	The length of time alcohol stays in the system depends on the amount consumed and how soon it was consumed prior to testing.  Just remember, if a person has drank a lot, the blood alcohol content won't peak for several, several hours after the drinking.  Then the blood alcohol content has to wane, or go down from there.  The best is to not drink at all for at least 24 hours (maybe more) before testing.  Good luck.

I know a lot of that dieting stuff is expensive but I found a free trial of Acai Berry(I think it only cost me like 7-8 bucks at the time for shipping.)  The site was   <a href="http://theweightlossplace.com" rel="nofollow">http://theweightlossplace.com</a> -  All I did was try it out for a month and I was sold,  I saw the results I wanted to and like I said I was in that plateau with my weight loss.

JAzYCgkCaa	If your goal is to lose weight you should start with 20-30 minutes of weight training because when you do cardio the first 20 minutes are dedicated to burning muscle and then you begin to burn fat. So build up for muscle mass, kick your heart rate into gear and you should see results.<br>  <br>  Best of Luck!
AA11404742	A psychologist would expose you gradually to the things you fear in a process call desensitivation.  You'd see pictures of needles, maybe, see other kinds like sewing needles, knitting needles, whatever it takes to get you comfortable on some beginning level.  Then you'd gradually get more and more exposure - maybe handling a sewing needle, seeing a hypodermic on a table, etc.  You can go to a therapist and try this if you want, or try it on your own, if you go gradually.  It might help.<br>  <br>  Or when you need an injection, just ask the nurse to give you a minute to compose yourself, and to use a fine needle if possible.  Study relaxation techniques ahead of time.  Take slow, deep breaths, and focus on something across the room, or even outside the window.  Put yourself out the window in that tree you see there, maybe.  Picture yourself standing by the tree.  See the shade on the trunk.  Put your hand on the trunk, and feel how rough the bark is.  Notice the ant that is crawling up the tree.  Feel the breeze on your face, and hear the bird above you.  Tell the nurse to do the injection then, and keep focusing on being in that tree.  <br>  <br>  And the fine thin needle will be almost unnoticeable.  She may be done before you even realize it.|`|phWUBtviaa	the trick for me is that i cannot look at the needle piercing my skin.  i have to look away.  and it only pinches for 2 or 3 seconds.  its not an agonizing pain.|`|WuskPQ6Qaa	nothing is greater than fear than fear itself|`|IDj64QwDaa	Don't think about them .

My ex boyfriend was too, and like you, when he went to the doctors, he would faint.  <br>  <br>  While my reaction isn't as strong, I do get terrified.  Especially of them slipping or poking me in the eye.<br>  <br>  Taking up sewing as a hobby actually helped me a lot.  I got comfortable with being around needles, touching them, learning to be safe so I wouldn't get hurt.  In a doctors office, I DO NOT look at the needles.  I stare into a different direction and think of other things, and pretend they are holding a pencil in my hand and will just poke me gently with it.  <br>  <br>  Don't know if that helps?

AA12123587	There are two different types of male breast development. One is called Pseudogynecomastia and the other is called Gynecomastia. <br>  <br>  The first, Pseudogynecomastia, is due to fat accumulation in the chest area. This type of breast enlargement responds very well to dieting and exercising. The problem is that if you gained excessive weight and then lost it, you may find yourself with a droopy flap of skin (chest ptosis).<br>  <br>  The other type of breasts development, Gynecomastia, is actual breasts tissue and gland formation. In other words, real breasts development similarly to that in women. Milk production may or may not be present, but usually there’s none. <br>  <br>  It may be caused by hormonal imbalance, medication with estrogens or steroidal compounds, failure of the liver to inactivate circulating estrogen (as in alcoholic cirrhosis), marijuana use, hyperthyroidism, decreased testosterone production, chronic kidney disease, Klinefelter's syndrome, testicular tumors, pituitary gland tumors, and obesity which tends to increase estrogen level in the body.<br>  <br>  True Gynecomastia can NOT be entirely treated with exercise and dieting alone. In fact, doing push ups or other exercises that develop the pectoral muscles underneath the breast tissue can make things worst. This is because the developed muscles will push the breasts tissue outward making them look bigger than they really are. But just like in women getting rid of excessive fat may help reduce the size of your breasts, but not eliminate them entirely. <br>  <br>  If the problem is new, it may be treated with Selective estrogen receptor modulator medications such as Letrozole. This is a pretty effective treatment during the first 2 to 3 years of breasts development. After that period of time, the breast tissue tends to remain and harden due to maturation, leaving surgery the only treatment option. Simply put, the sooner you get treated, the better the results.<br>  <br>  Surgery is an option for some people but not for all. Mainly due to cost. Plastic surgery is very expensive and not everyone can afford it. There is a couple of other options. You could wear a compression garment which hides the condition, or just learn to live with it. <br>  <br>  I would suggest that you don’t try to diagnose yourself, but rather seek the help of a doctor. Because as I mentioned before, Gynecomastia can be caused by some serious medical conditions. Only a doctor can rule any of these conditions out and tell you what your best options are. Good luck!|`|c3IXjK26aa	Look up "pectoral exercises" and you'll find a lot. <br>  <br>  I know push ups help. <br>  <br>  Also eating more fruits, vegetables & lean meat would probably be enough to lose the tiny bit of fat that makes them appear "boob-like".

zJoVm4SSaa	I'm also going to school for this and I am female. There are 12 people in my class. out of them there are 3 males. We just went over this very same thing in my psych class. Its called gender identity. It is influenced by social factors and biological factors.The biological are hormones and physical shape of body and brain structure. The social factors which is ( why men aren't dental assistants as much as women.)  These social factors sometimes contribute to stereotyping. Which in this case is one of them. You know boys equal blue girls pink. Parents separate gender the moment we are born. Men are taught to think they have to show less emotion and be stronger and women are taught to be weaker and fragile housewives. So it contributes to the whole doctor/nurse thing. same thing for dentist and dentist assistant. It is assumed by society that guys are the dentist and girls are dental assistants. If you see a man nurse you think hes gay, but thats because of the social factors. the way you were brought up will change teh way you think.<br>  <br>  By the way awesome job. Great hours. Different things to do everyday . Def recommend it.Good pay.|`|3PuKXEwZaa	I think it is more something that women have dominated for so long.  Many dentists are men and prefer to hire women.  Sort of like how secretaries all seem to be women.  You could call your local dental society and inquire about accredited dental assisting programs if you are interested in going to school for it.
inH6jIrhaa	You are doing the right thing. Keep doing it. Keep talking about it and each and every time it gets a little better. You sound very good for what you are going through and if i were you I would not worry one bit. I lost a child 18 years ago and not one day goes by that I do not think of her. Many days I feel like "why even try" but having two other children helps. Hang in there and keep talking to who ever will listen. About shrinks. I went for ever one year and never said one word. Now 18 years later I started to go because I want to and I want to talk about it. You will find what works for you and the way it sounds you are doing awesome. keep it up. O if nothing else and you feel like you just can't do it anymore don't be afraid to get meds. You need to see a psychiatrist for the meds but they work. You might have to try a few different ones but they help. They will make you feel good and they can really help you. Don't feel bad or ashamed if you need medication either.

7baf2d70f091a4c4b5364a457f94ea90aa	Yes its most likely your starting your period...just take some pain relief or a hot water bottle and have an early night with your favouriate teddy bear and dont stress about it and you will be fine...|`|04F4149yaa	Probably...That's what happens for me...But every woman's period is different and there is no way to predict what will happen to you judging from your experience.|`|hSvQqSRqaa	Take some aleve that always helps my cramps go away.

However, if you've been sexually active, and your period doesn't arrive within a week, take a home pregnancy test that you can buy at the drugstore.  If it comes out positive, make an appointment with a OB/GYN.|`|o5o4LXVwaa	It could be an ectopic pregnancy.

Please call the dr's office now. Don't let them take a message for the doctor so he can call you later. tell whoever answers that you're on coumadin and hit your head and tell them of your symptoms. If it's after hours when you call, I'm sure the doctor is still available if (and it is) an emergency. If still no success, go to the Emergency room asap.<br>  You can't fool around with yourself when you're on coumadin.

I'm not bothered with it because I value inner beauty above outer beauty but of course I care how I look. I just don't occupy myself with "Oh my gosh! It's a imperfection."

WVd2S6xWaa	do you know how to bake a cake? you use yeast to make it rise. its a healthy thing, just make sure you don't put to much pure yeast in your vagina or you'll get an infection. try just a handful at a time, or else your vagina will rise to oblivion.|`|v3TvbdrBaa	GO ON WEBMD.COM AND LOOK IT UP..IT WILL GIVE A MORE DETAILED DESCRIPTION THAN ANY OF US COULD.|`|CHlxBbkHaa	You'll have some odd discharge.  You'll be super itchy.  Nothing will stop the itching.  There is generally a not so nice smell that comes with it.  If you think you have a yeast infection, go to the doctor.<br>  <br>  If you are prone to getting them then stop sleeping with your undies on.  Stay clean and dry and that'll reduce your chances of getting it.
MOHgYm8raa	When I had my molar out they just left the hole. It felt a bit weird but it soon closed up after a few days.
8hOYHOMxaa	If you say it feels like it is on the bone, then it is probably mastoiditis. Where that bone is there are little mastoid air cells. When they become infected they swell up and are painful. You should go to your doctor to confirm but it sounds like this is the case. If it is, you need to be on antibiotics ASAP. <br>  I am not a medical professional, but a student in the medical field. We just learned about this not too long ago. See your doc.<br>  Hope this helps!<br>  just google mastoiditis to read about it if you want.<br>  <br>  also, you said you were sick first....usually this occurs from an untreated middle ear infection.|`|K6fasl6kaa	could be a swollen lymph node due to infection.  these become larger and make more white blood cells, the body's natural way to fight infection. if it lasts more than a few days, see your md.|`|Ruifi0GSaa	Sounds like you need a anti-inflammatory.<br>  Try this home made item.

5PIgZ7tFaa	It sounds like an addict with serious anger control issues. That was a cruel thing to do. It probably has to do with the addiction. If she is still using, her self-control issues are highly unlikely to have improved. <br>      At any rate, it doesn't really matter what caused her arsonistic urges; no child should be around someone who can't control themselves. You've done the right thing in getting custody of the child. He needs stability, and he won't get it with his mother if she is still indulging her addictions.|`|esSVPxRAaa	I think this was mean, and a symptom of rejection thru an unstable mind. You state she has substance abuse problems. At the time she could have been on any number of things, or coming off of them which either way creates an almost uncontrollable insanity and state of madness. She has the disease of addiction. Hope for the best for her, tho expect the worst at any time. At her age, I suppose she's left the nest and flies on her own. She is out of your control, And possibly out of her own control as well.|`|IDj64QwDaa	Noooo !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! do not give the child back if you do this will lead to an abusive situation.Your daughter really needs help she may say she does not but she does. ps yes what she did was mean|`|ffWnnM5Faa	If she's on drugs, then that could have been it.

No way|`|AA10041941	sounds down right mean, my parents have passed away and if ANYONE ever touched the last gifts I ever recieved from them I don't know HOW I would react. She sounds a little "off" but you know that before you even try to get custody it has to be proven WHY you want him and you have to prove that the mother is not mentally & physically able to take care of her son. The way you describe it she sounds like a drug addict who FIRST needs to clean her life up way before you even consider giving her the child. Its been 2 years and you haven't gotten custody of the child yet? Why? that child needs to be in a loving stable environment and it seems the mother would NOT be a good choice at the moment. Go see a lawyer and maybe they can gice you specifics on what you need to do to get this child to be actually YOURS. Please do not delay.. she is the mother and unfortunately she has rights you need to get those suspended A.S.A.P

7UQUkhjZaa	I have no idea for sure... best bet is to ask the dentist or stop by his/her office.<br>  <br>  You can look up pics online of dry sockets - check out images.google.com.  Most of those pictures don't look like yours does... they usually show a black hole depicting the socket.<br>  <br>  The weird taste may be resulting from infection or just the open wound.  If it's dry socket, it should be a "foul taste or odor".  <br>  <br>  Also, the pain is supposed to be excruciating and constant if you have dry socket.  I think it's one of those things that you'll know for sure when you have it.<br>  <br>  But again, check with your dentist :)  Good luck :)
4qrItF27aa	Try using Carmex it really gets rid of blisters. You can usually find them at stores such as Walmart, Walgreens, ect.|`|8bdc9ac98f919f0faf749743418c2d54aa	Abreva works when applied right when you feel the little tingle where the cold sore is. And keep applying for 1-2 days, few times throughout the day. Sometimes, it'll not take away the sore, but actually speed it up so you'll end up with the scab-like hardening of the skin without having it wait a week for it ripe and burn and then harden.<br>  <br>  You should put a lot of vaseline on the spot to soften the skin so it's not so obvious and also so it doesn't get dry, crack, and bleed.<br>  <br>  Also, I've heard that cold sores are caused by viruses. So once you get one, you end up carrying the virus and will continue to break out if you are in contact with whatever causes it break out (i.e. stress, cold weather, etc.) Not sure how true this is.|`|PwQLpawkaa	hi, i think it could be a coldsore, you should get a cream called zovirax it's especially for anything like that on your lip, and it works wonders!! also you can get pills to stop you from getting coldsores on your lips also, you can get all this in the chemist!|`|nT0Yq4qvaa	Maybe it's not a blister, maybe it's a cold sore.

Don't worry, it isn't the same as genital herpes and 80% of Americans have it. You just need to go get cold sore medicine which is right next to the chapstick in most drugstores. But be aware it is extremely contagious so don't share drinks and it can be spread to the genitals if you give oral sex with a sore.|`|mMfXWjeSaa	Try the medicine Brioschi....It may sting for a few seconds but it will work.<br>  <br>  I have used them for both blisters and coldsores....the lemon flavor is good. <br>  <br>  My Italian grandmother turned me onto this stuff when I was little.  If you ever have an upset stomach....mix some Brioschi with a glass of water, chug it, and say goodbye to your tummy ache!

AA11481893	I had gallstones about 7 years ago. Twice I went to the ER and they said it was nothing that i was fine. By the third time I went I was literally hours from death. The infected gallbladder had damaged my liver and pancreas. If u do have the gallstones, get the surgery. I couldn't keep anything down I lost like 20 pounds, I eventually quit eating altogether and yet still dry heaving. If you get pain in your right side go to the ER because I had that pain and it was liver damage.<br>  <br>  Gallstones do suck I'll give you that one. The downside to all of this is some peoples digestive system don't work the same. I cannot eat any greasy fatty foods unless I want to jump up from the dinner table with diarrhea. You will have to completely change your diet if your a greasy junk food eater.|`|AA11388527	I've never had a choley (short for choleycystectomy), my sister did, but what did you want to know about it?  I can tell you.<br>  <br>  And as far as your question about symptoms, yes, other people with choleycystitis experience these symptoms.|`|2cb46ea6e0285a7d419967ceaef6f993aa	I'm a nurse in a surgeon's office. We schedule people for gallbladder surgery all the time. Your symptoms sound pretty typical. An ultrasound or a hepatobiliary scan can confirm the presence of gallstones.  However, you may not have any stones, but instead have a gallbladder that doesn't work well.  Again the hepatobiliary (Pipida) scan can find that out. <br>  Surgery is actually pretty simple. Nowadays it is done laparoscopically 95% of the time.  The surgeon makes 3-4 very small incisions on your abdomen to put in a camera to see what he is doing and instruments to remove the gallbladder.  The incisions are closed with steri-strips (tape). Most of the time no stitches or staples are needed to close the wounds. <br>  The surgery is usually done outpatient.  You will come into the hospital or surgery center in the morning, get surgery done and if all goes well, you will go home the same day. Our doctors tell patients that they can expect to resume normal activity in about 1 week. But some people do that a lot sooner. <br>  If you find out it is not your gallbladder, you may need to have a scope done to see if you have an ulcer or gastritis (inflammation of the esophagus and stomach).|`|yUIODXRzaa	yeah

AA10766729	First of all, you didn't entirely miss a pill; 10 hours is NOT a huge deal.  If you're skipping entire days at a time, THEN it's time to start worrying.  And just so you know, when in doubt ALWAYS use a condom.<br>  <br>  Secondly, you did NOT have unprotected sex.  "Unprotected" is sex that occurs without ANY means of contraception whatsoever.  Since you're on the pill -- even if you're not 100% perfect using it -- you're not having unprotected sex.<br>  <br>  Finally, if you're THIS uptight about pregnancy, then you should not be having sex.  NO method of contraception is EVER 100% effective, so you have two options....accept the responsiblity that may or may not come with having sex or don't have sex.<br>  <br>  As for your period issues, you may skip the first month, but to make yourself feel better, take a pregnancy test.|`|04F4149yaa	There is always a chance for pregnancy honey.

156ONtMraa	Hey, I just got braces on Monday, and to tell you the truth.. it does not hurt at all. I just got the top done and it took about an hour. All they do is take some more x-rays then they take molds of your teeth with this plaster stuff. (you get to pick the flavor!)-Breath through your nose!!<br>  <br>  Then they put this mouth opener/stretcher in your mouth to keep it open and to hold your tongue back. They clean your teeth, then they put the bands on your back molars. (this might hurt just a little).<br>  <br>  After that, they apply glue to each tooth, then they apply the bracket to the tooth and they use this UltraViolet light gun and shine it on each tooth to dry the glue. Then they put the wire in place and they ask what color little bands do you want. While they're putting those on the bracket you'll feel some pressure on your teeth, but NO PAIN!<br>  <br>  I was scared at first too cause people said it hurts alot, and i have a LOW tolerance for pain, but the process of braces did not hurt!!<br>  <br>  I havent gotten them tightened yet cause I just got them but it should feel like when you got your first wire, just little pressure.<br>  <br>  (But just to be safe, take an advil/tylenol before you go!)<br>  Have fun with your train tracks :) -i love mine!!|`|eXDepNHZaa	it depends how bad your teeth are messed up.when i got mine on it hurt soo bad.and my teeth were straight they just had some gaps.and it hurts a little when they tighten them but you get used to it.it does hurt and you cant eat and it feels weird but you get used to it. braces do suck but they are SO worth it in the end.if you take care of your teeth and wear your retainer after you will be so thankful.i got my braces off about 6 years ago and i still wear my retainer at night.all the time i get compliments on how nice my teeth are =]|`|DpqQKrsYaa	Yeah, they're going to hurt when you first get them on, but the initial pain subsides pretty quickly. Make sure to take some motrin about 1/2 an hour beforehand. Your teeth will probably hurt for about a week, so don't eat anything too hard or sticky. The tightening process hurts as well, during and after, but its not as bad as when you first get them on. Just be gentle with them at first and make sure to clean them really well!|`|aVbWrsVOaa	heyy i have braces and they really don't hurt getting them on. i don't like the sound of scrapping teeth and my had to be sanded a little and that was uncomfortable but it lasted like 2 seconds and not everyone needs that. the braces do feel soar the day after you get them or even the night after but only for like 2 days and but taking an advil/ tylenol helped me. and tightening just makes it soar like 2 days after. they really aren't as bad as people think. i promise :]  good luck with them!!|`|dag4omlAaa	Hi ok i have had my braces for the past 2 years and yes they hurt when you are getting them put on and they will hurt for a couple of month after that and everytime they tighten them and when you have to wear the rubber bands. Just take some pain meds. the night before you go and  1hr. before your appointment and that should help with the pain it did with me.. Hope i help :)
ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|F8EnH6JQaa	TRY THIS, and stick to it.<br>  <br>  the first 3-4 weeks are the hardest until your boy adjusts to the change.<br>  Results will be in about the same time<br>  <br>  Fruits and Veggies<br>  <br>  Eat more plants and keep away from stuff that was made in plants.<br>  don't eat anything that comes in a can, box or package...THEY HAVE ADDITIVES IN THEM THAT MAKE YOU ADDICTED TO THE FOOD<br>  If man made it, don't eat it<br>  <br>  Stay away from FAST FOOD<br>  <br>  <br>  Don't think of it as a diet, but think of it as a lifestyle change<br>  <br>  I have lost 25.5 pounds in 2 months, drink lots of water. I usually eat a meal of what ever I want once a week....controlled portion....this really works.........<br>  <br>  Write down every thing you eat<br>  <br>  Take a multi vitamin at night|`|QsrX5CY3aa	The best way to lose weight is to control your appetite and the best way to do that that I know of is with hoodia.  When I was dieting (and believe me I still watch my weight even though I have achieved my weight loss goals for the most part) I realized right off that the most important thing is to control your appetite.  If your stomach's not always growling and your not always craving food it is sooo much easier to stick to your guns and stay on your diet.  With hoodia I would literally go a whole day sometimes and simply forget to eat and I didn't get tired and run down like diets can sometimes make you feel.  Once my appetite was under control and I wasn't always thinking about eating then and only then could the weight start coming off consistently and steadily because the hoodia kept my mind off of food and I would go longer on my diet and as I did that naturally I lost weight.  You have to remember that consistency is very important when losing weight.  If you cut back a little on your food consumption everyday your body will change (stomach will shrink and you won't be eating as much) and with that consistency over a few days, weeks and months you will lose weight just like I did.  Hoodia was my saving grace for all of these factors.  Hope this helps!!!|`|HsDEPhdLaa	The formula for losing those unwanted pounds is not difficult - consume less and exercise more often - the difficulties surface when we really try to put that into practice!

3QIWdvG1aa	you probably just have a higher level common cold<br>  Symptoms of a common cold usually appear about one to three days after exposure to a cold virus. Signs and symptoms of a common cold may include:<br>  <br>      * Runny or stuffy nose<br>      * Itchy or sore throat<br>      * Cough<br>      * Congestion<br>      * Slight body aches or a mild headache<br>      * Sneezing<br>      * Watery eyes<br>      * Low-grade fever (up to 102 F, or 39 C)<br>      * Mild fatigue<br>  <br>  The discharge from your nose may become thicker and yellow or green in color as a common cold runs its course. What makes a cold different from other viral infections is that you generally won't have a high fever. You're also unlikely to experience significant fatigue from a common cold.<br>  <br>  When to see a doctor<br>  For adults — Seek medical attention if you have:<br>  <br>      * Fever of 102 F (39 C) or higher<br>      * High fever accompanied by achiness and fatigue<br>      * Fever accompanied by sweating, chills and a cough with colored phlegm<br>      * Significantly swollen glands<br>      * Severe sinus pain<br>  There's no cure for the common cold. Antibiotics are of no use against cold viruses. Over-the-counter cold preparations won't cure a common cold or make it go away any sooner, and most have side effects. Here's a look at the pros and cons of some common cold remedies.<br>  <br>      * Pain relievers. For fever, sore throat and headache, many people turn to acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or other mild pain relievers. Keep in mind that acetaminophen can cause liver damage, especially if taken frequently or in larger than recommended doses. Be especially careful when giving acetaminophen to children because the dosing guidelines can be confusing. For instance, the infant-drop formulation is much more concentrated than the syrup commonly used in older children. Never give aspirin to children. It has been associated with Reye's syndrome — a rare but potentially fatal illness.<br>      * Decongestant nasal sprays. Adults shouldn't use decongestant drops or sprays for more than a few days because prolonged use can cause chronic inflammation of mucous membranes. And children shouldn't use decongestant drops or sprays at all. There's little evidence that they work in young children, and they may cause side effects.<br>      * Cough syrups. In winter, nonprescription cough syrups practically fly off the drugstore shelves. But the American College of Chest Physicians strongly discourages the use of these medications because they're not effective at treating the underlying cause of cough due to colds. Some contain ingredients that may alleviate coughing, but the amounts are too small to do much good and may actually be harmful for children. In fact, the college recommends against using OTC cough syrups or cold medicines for anyone younger than age 14. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) strongly recommends against giving OTC cough and cold medicines to children younger than age 2. Meantime, under an agreement announced by manufacturers in late 2008, several brands of OTC cold and cough medications began carrying a warning that these products should not be used in children under 4. For young children, an accidental overdose could be fatal. Coughs associated with a cold usually last less than two to three weeks. If a cough lingers longer than that, see your doctor.<br>  <br>  Lifestyle and home remedies<br>  <br>  You may not be able to cure your common cold, but you can make yourself as comfortable as possible. These tips may help:<br>  <br>      * Drink lots of fluids. Water, juice, tea and warm soup are all good choices. They help replace fluids lost during mucus production or fever. Avoid alcohol and caffeine, which can cause dehydration, and cigarette smoke, which can aggravate your symptoms.<br>      * Try chicken soup. Generations of parents have spooned chicken soup into their sick children. Now scientists have put chicken soup to the test, discovering that it does seem to help relieve cold and flu symptoms in two ways. First, it acts as an anti-inflammatory by inhibiting the movement of neutrophils — immune system cells that help the body's response to inflammation. Second, it temporarily speeds up the movement of mucus through the nose, helping relieve congestion and limiting the time viruses are in contact with the nasal lining.<br>      * Get some rest. If possible, stay home from work if you have a fever or a bad cough, or are drowsy from medications. This will give you a chance to rest as well as reduce the chances that you'll infect others. Wear a mask when you have a cold if you live or work with someone with a chronic disease or compromised immune system.<br>      * Adjust your room's temperature and humidity. Keep your room warm, but not overheated. If the air is dry, a cool-mist humidifier or vaporizer can moisten the air and help ease congestion and coughing. Be sure to keep the humidifier clean to prevent the growth of bacteria and molds.<br>      * Soothe your throat. Gargling with warm salt water several times a day or drinking warm lemon
4flomCyJaa	Dust mites. Dust mites are impossible to get away from, and they especially love fabrics like bed linen and carpet because it's full of the dander that they eat. The waste that the dust mites give off are allergens - so allergy-like symptoms - chest congestion, coughing, sneezing, watery eyes, etc. - can crop up if you have a lot of dust mites in your bedroom. Like I said earlier, there is no way to completely rid your room of dust mites (which is okay because they don't bite or anything), but there are things you can do to alleviate the allergen problem. First of all, wash your bed linens. Get them as clean as possible - maybe even buy some new hypoallergenic ones. Definitely buy a hypoallergenic pillowcase - because dust mites near your nose will just make the problem worse. Also, give your floor a good cleaning - if you've got carpet, consider switching to hardwood or linoleum because it's easier to clean the dander (carpets can never be completely cleaned). I hope this helps.|`|8HDQMkSBaa	It may be caused by the 3 packs of cigarettes a day...|`|TiX5Z4Zbaa	Allergies?
AA10766729	The hymen is generally a thin ring of tissue at the entrance of the vagina.  It doesn't cover the entire passage; this is why virgins can use tampons (as well as vaginal medications).<br>  <br>  And just so you know, even if the hymen is torn or completely ruptured by the use of a medication or tampon, that does NOT mean virginity is gone.  Virginity can only be taken by having sex with a penis.  In short, lack of hymen does NOT equal lack of virginity.

So does holding them under the shoulders.<br>  <br>  If the problem is that they're too heavy for you to carry the solution is more people. There's no good way to do this if you can't lift them.|`|2GwUiEStaa	Honestly it depends on the size of the person and the extent of their abilities. What might be the easiest way would be to have someone assist you and use a gait/transfer belt to stand pivot the person. Or, if the person can slide a little a slide board can be used. If the person is small enough and you don't have another option stand in front of the person and have him/her hang onto you if possible and assist them to stand/pivot to the bed.|`|Mxq1NQJdaa	How did they get into wheelchair in the first place?  Can ask the person who transferred the compromised person into wheelchair to show you, since the degree  affected, side affected, etc would indicate how best to assist with transfers.<br>  <br>  Can the compromised person assist at all?  Stand in front of person, bend your knees, place both forarms around upper torso, place persons arms on your shoulders, and lift as one with you, pivot and sit person on the bed.  The wheelchair needs to be aligned at the side of the bed....sides of each lined up.  Put the chair where you want the person to sit after you pivot.  It is really best to be shown how best to perform this assistance.

CHiEKZrLaa	Oxygen is carried to our tissues through the blood.  It cannot be simply dissolved in the blood, it needs a carrier.  The carrier is HEMOGLOBIN.<br>  <br>  Hemoglobin is a protein, and each hemoglobin molecule has 4 binding pockets... think of them like parking stalls.  Each parking stall has room for one molecule only.  Oxygen, carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide could each park in a stall, but only one per stall at any given time.<br>  <br>  Which molecule gets to park in the stall at any given time depends on 2 things: how many oxygen "cars" there are compared with carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide "cars" (this is the partial pressure.)  And also the binding affinity each "car" has for the "parking stall."  Kinda like how perfectly the car fits in the stall.<br>  <br>  So!  The problem with carbon monoxide is that it's affinity for hemoglobin is really high.  Like 3x higher than oxygen.  So much higher that even if there's more oxygen cars trolling around the lot trying to find a place, the carbon monoxide car will get every available parking stall... it's affinity is so high, it can even kick oxygen cars out of their stalls and take over.<br>  <br>  Making matters worse, the carbon monoxide just hangs out, parked in the hemoglobin stalls for a LONG time.  Much longer than the oxygen cars who were just running in to pick up a few things.  ;)<br>  <br>  So it doesnt take very much carbon monoxide to fill up all of the parking lots (hemoglobin,) leaving oxygen without a carrier.<br>  <br>  Not enough oxygen in the blood.  Not enough oxygen to the brain.  Literally, you suffocate.  Pretty quickly.  You're breathing in and out, lungs are working fine, but the oxygen cant find a vacant stall to get into the blood.|`|rcPnnfmmaa	Because it sticks to hemoglobin and doesn't let go. This means that your hemoglobin can't absorb more oxygen. You can suffocate on pure oxygen if there just isn't any working hemoglobin left to carry oxygen to your cells.|`|ci6f63Ifaa	It prevents the lungs from absorbing oxygen and transferring it to the bloodstream. The carbon monoxide basically crowds oxygen out and takes its place.  What makes it even more dangerous is that it is both invisible and odorless so it can affect you without you being aware of it.

dMqytjONaa	Well targeted weight loss is not possible, genetics will play a role which leads to this myth anyways. Everybody body is built differently and if your body tends to pack it on on your thighs and belly, then guess what your body is also designed to lose it there as well.<br>  <br>  Losing weight has more to do with proper diet and exercise, namely cardio. This doesn't just mean jogging and running, walking is a cardio workout, it just burns calories at a slower rate.<br>  <br>  Remember to lose 1 pound of fat you need to burn off 3500 calories, that means diet and exercise. walking will do this too you just need to figure out how much walking is that.<br>  <br>  This site has some great information that can really help you out with this idea you should check it out|`|COrM1SQdaa	Targetted weight loss is quite hard, many would declare impossible, nevertheless the only thing that really worked for me was wu-yi tea, it can be viewed in the resource box underneath, they have a limited number of free trials in stock, it was highlighted in Fox News and USA Today.

Eat (at least) three times a day. <br>  Because when you eat only once a day, your metabolism gets slower than it already is! That's the main reason. Sounds funny, but to lose weight... you must eat (the right things, of course) <br>  ? Eat low-fat, high-fiber foods such as salads and vegetable pastas.<br>  ? Your last meal should be before 18:00. Try. <br>  OK, one apple after 18:00 <br>  ? Don't starve <br>  Starvation is not good for losing weight, nor your health. <br>  Starvation is the worse thing you can do in a weight loss diet. <br>  ? Try oatmeal instead of cornflakes for breakfast--eating oatmeal can help reduce cholesterol levels, and its high fiber content will keep you full longer.<br>  <br>  WHAT to drink for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Drink 6-8 glasses of water every day ! <br>  Can be tap, plain, mineral, sparkling. I just love mineral sparkling water! <br>  This improves your bowel, reduces the "hunger" sensation, and hydrates your skin. Your skin will look much better after the first weeks! <br>  Don't believe the slogan "water makes me fat". Beside being stupid... you might get into serious troubles with your kidneys. <br>  ? Drink ONLY natural juices, freshly squeezed! <br>  Don't drink Coca Cola, Pepsi, Spite etc. during the diet. Even lite or light versions. <br>  <br>  <br>  Exercise for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? If you want quicker results - exercise would be good. <br>  ? Don't just sit in front of the TV and eat peanuts... <br>  I guarantee THIS won't work for your weight loss... <br>  ? Start a regular exercise program and stick with it. Don't be afraid of those sweat suits and Lycra pants! <br>  ? Start swimming. Swimming is an excellent exercise to get involved with, since it increases blood flow and uses muscles we don't regularly use. Start a swimming program and try to do it 3 times a week. You will feel excellent and rejuvenated.<br>  ? Choose an exercise program that you enjoy, and don't shun the unconventional. For instance, did you know that regular vigorous dancing is exercise too?<br>  ? Also Cardiovascular exercises such as running, jogging, or aerobics will help you lose that unwanted belly fat. Weight training can also help you lose body fat because the more muscle mass you have, the more ability your system has to burn body fat.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  Hope this helps~|`|tERrqwzaaa	try lots of lunges and squats with weights in your hands to make it even more intense<br>  do it to your favorite music :]<br>  do 30 squats<br>  jog on the spot for a minute<br>  do another 30 squats<br>  jog for a minute<br>  15 lunges on one leg<br>  15 on the other<br>  jog for a minute<br>  15 lunges on one leg<br>  15 on the other<br>  jog for a minute<br>  <br>  do this as often as you can :]<br>  doesnt take up much time, 10/15 minutes max?!<br>  <br>  really gets your legs burning :)<br>  <br>  good luck<br>  its knackering haha, make sure you stretch your legs well before otherwise it can be easy to pull a muscle<br>  <br>  xo

I feel theres always and answer to any pain or illness. however, knowing the answer doesn't mean theres a cure. if someone has muscle pain all over and its due to a neural problem, theres probly not much u can do, but why call it FMS? why not call it what it is. theres a reason they call it a syndrome... because theres no true evidence of a disease.|`|heziH5K4aa	I had an ex-boyfriend who had fibromyalgia. He looked like he was in pain all the time, and said that his muscles and back would feel sore everyday, all the time. He would just lay in bed all day and weighed about 118 and he was 5'7". He really looked sick mostly. I think it is a real illness. Just because there is no test now to prove it exists doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

tqeAHAR9aa	The chief con of multivitamins is that a person can take one and think "There, now I'm covered health wise, no need to eat healthy."  I'm not surprised some nutritionists discourage them.

hUHwf0hmaa	This is a new cold, most likely.  Once you've had pneumonia, I think you're a bit more susceptible to opportunistic upper respiratory infections, so go to bed, get plenty of rest, drink a lot of fluids - and DON'T try to get up and go about your life until you are really feeling better.

8iHbDmHmaa	152 calories!  That's it?!  For an average woman to lose weight, she should eat between 1200-1500 calories.  You are starving yourself, and your body is going to hold onto every single calorie you eat, it's called "starvation mode".<br>  <br>  Talk to your parents and see if you can come up with a healthier grocery list together.

You will trick your body into thinking you are starving, it will shut off your metabolism.  You will slow down weight loss eating like this!  Look up your Resting Metabolic Rate, there are easy calculators online.  Your RMR is the amount of calories your body would burn if you laid in bed all day doing nothing, you need at least that many to survive.  Calculate your RMR and shoot for eating that many calories per day.  Stick to low fat foods, your fruits and veggies are good, add whole grains and some lower fat dairy.  Avoid pre-packaged things like cookies, crackers, chips and soda.|`|tERrqwzaaa	thats really not healthy<br>  <br>  when you go back to eating 1,500 calories or however many you were, you'll put t all back on and it wont be worth it<br>  <br>  3 days is impossible<br>  <br>  reduce your calorie intake by 500 and exercise every day for atleast 30 minutes of high intensity cardio<br>  <br>  it takes time but itll be worth it<br>  good luck xo|`|kLSSLlOaaa	whoa...your asking for death with that kind of dieting. the celery and water is what we call 'negative calorie foods'. this means your body uses more calories digesting the food than it actually gets from the food. <br>  <br>  You will not lose your stomach in 3 days. no matter how much you workout. <br>  <br>  your best bet is to eat about 5-6 small meals a day and exercise. this will increase your metabolism so you never have to worry about your weight like this again. when they say its a lifestyle, they mean it

rpnFxnCQaa	I know how you feel. I had anxiety attacks too. <br>  <br>  For me, that was when I had to speak in public. Or when there would be more than a few people around me in the same room. It was something that started when I was a teenager and that lasted over years and subsequently affected my career until not so long ago. <br>  <br>  At some point, I was prescribed medicine but I wanted to avoid that because of side effects. That's when I discovered a program that literally pulled me out of that "hole".

People don't want to dig into the research for themselves and/or find out the facts about things, then want to treat you like some kind of weirdo because you do.

Luckily, my mother lets me decide what I would like to do with my body. Therefore, I decided against this vaccine for a couple reasons. My personal opinion is to be wary of vaccines or medications that have not been around long enough to truly know and understand the long term effects. I feel as though there may be major side effects that we are unaware of. Also, this may cause something worse later on. This is why I have decided to stay away from this particular vaccine. I personally feel as though many people over medicate and over vaccinate these days. And try to let my body repair itself for the most part.
Kxwyy0Eaaa	In addition to fruits and veggies (I'm eating frozen carrots that I put in hot water long enough to thaw as I type this), I eat whole grains and vegan sources of protein-- beans, tofu, veggie burgers, peanut butter (yummy with apples), etc. I try to avoid anything with corn syrup, high fructose corn syrup, partially hydrogenated oils, hydrogenated oils, artificial colors, artificial flavors, artificial preservatives and anything that looks as though it was created in a lab by humans and not in nature by God and anything that I can't pronounce, as it's very likely fake. <br>  <br>  Overall, I stick with mostly frozen fruits and veggies. They are usually frozen soon after harvest and have most of the nutrients in them, still. With "fresh" they are generally picked before they are ripe and travel many miles and handled many times before I even see them. Not so good. However, I do eat apples and bananas. Canned is okay, but most canned veggies are laden with salt for preservatives and are cooked some (I think) and there are usually as many nutrients in there. Some canned fruits and apple sauce have corn syrup and/or high fructose corn syrup in the juice, which, of course, gets on the fruit, and in my opinion, completely ceases to be healthy. <br>  <br>  This is not a "diet" for me, but how I choose to live my life. Yes, at six feet 155 pounds, I'm thin, well I guess skinny since my ribs and my hip bones stick out and my collar and shoulder bones as well.

Your body would need to dissolve muscle and use it for proteins and energy.   Try eating protein with the vegetables and fruits.  Cut out starches and sugars, other than the vegetables and some fruit.  Canned vegetables are OK.  Canned fruits often have added sugars, so check the label carefully if you use them.  Eat plenty of protein, some good fats like fish oil supplements (which help you burn stored body fat) and olive oil, drink lots of water ( take you weight in pounds and divide by to for ounces of water to drink daily).  Adding fiber supplements, taken half an hour before eating, can give you a full feeling and help you to eat less. Fiber also balances blood sugars and lowers bad cholesterol.  It keeps your intestines working well, too.<br>  <br>  Last year I lost thirty pounds by cutting back on portions, no sugars or flour, walking two miles a day.  I drank plenty of water. I started to measure my food so I knew exactly what I was eating , not just guessing.  I used this site to figure nutrition information:  www.nutritiondata.com<br>  <br>  I think it's best to change your every day diet so you can eat that forever and keep at a good weight.|`|9fb74469d3f937feeed0a568c9da83feaa	I eat a lot of veggies (((salads, tomato, carrots, ect ect ect))), some fruit, but I do also eat fish (((tuna, salmon and chicken, not to much red meat thought))) I drink water, te and some fresh juices !!! and I combine with exercise everyday 45 to 2 hours depends of how much time do I have, I am pretty bad waking up so early so I do it at night.... <br>  <br>  It is not how fast you lose weight, because you can starve yourself and lose weight... but the idea is to change your lifestyle for a healthy one and your results will remain forever !!! <br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck !|`|2qRaprunaa	you will be very hungry<br>  <br>  do drink lots of water and get your butt moving by walking an hour or running 30 mins a day.<br>  <br>  do a good carb/bad carb<br>  one day only eat things very healthy, like fruits --which is manly water<br>  and tommorrow, eat a little bit of anything.<br>  <br>  this will keep you full and keep you form snacking at night, or crashing your only fruit diet.|`|7RNF5wAFaa	not enough protien

Only you would know if u are sexually active or not, and if u are then u are entitled to a smear test simply because they may test you for HPV ( human Paloma virus) I don't know if it is spelled correctly.

She can stay where she is for a few years.  I would talk to the doctors and find out what is causing her kidneys to fail.  Is it high blood pressure, diabetes, or autoimmune related?  <br>  <br>  Take a deep breath.  It is scary. She qualifies to be evaluated for a kidney transplant now....EVEN prior to dialysis!  I am on the kidney transplant list and not on dialysis. We are trying to skip it.<br>  <br>  I wish your mother well. With the proper care she can live many MANY more years.|`|AA11388527	Chronic kidney disease is divided into 5 stages with stage 5 being ESRD (end-stage renal disease) indicating renal failure.  The stages of chronic kidney disease are measured by the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) level. GFR indicates how much kidney function a person has.  I've never heard of a 3 1/2 stage but I guess it would be between a 3 (moderate decrease in GFR) and a 4 (severe decrease in GFR).  Dialysis and transplant are discussed at stage 5 and sometimes at stage 4 if GFR continues to decrease.   I'm not aware of a stage 6 and perhaps this hospital (or doctor) uses a somewhat different staging system.<br>  <br>  Her nephrologist may have ordered a serum creatinine, a creatinine clearance using a 24-hour urine or a serum cystatin C.  He may have ordered more than one test.  These all evaluate GFR.<br>  <br>  Speak to her attending doctor.  She/he is responsible for coordinating her care.  If you're the responsible party on record, you have a right to your mother's health information and answers to your questions.  Speak to her Social Worker and request a PCP meeting.<br>  <br>  By the way, a creatinine level of 10 or more, indicates a need for transplant or dialysis.  The normal range for females is 0.5 - 1.1mg/dL.  My guess is that uncontrolled diabetes is responsible for everything from the hypertension to the nephropathy.  These are well documented consequences.|`|5ta5yyWSaa	It is the stage of renal failure. Check out webmd.com for more info,<br>  <br>  Methods of Measurement for CKD<br>  <br>  Stages of kidney failure<br>  <br>  Chronic kidney failure is measured in five stages, which are calculated using a patient’s GFR, or glomerular filtration rate. Stage 1 CKD is mildly diminished renal function, with few overt symptoms. Stages 2 and 3 need increasing levels of supportive care from their medical providers to slow and treat their renal dysfunction. Patients in stages 4 and 5 usually require preparation of the patient towards active treatment in order to survive.Stage 5 CKD is considered a severe illness and requires some form of renal replacement therapy (dialysis) or kidney transplant whenever feasible.
nDSLNnguaa	Please don't thumb down when I say this- YOU don't conceive the kid, the woman does.  And what do you mean you won't find someone young enough?  How young is young enough?  Plenty of women today are having babies well into their forties.  In fact most women's eggs don't become geriatric until forty.<br>  I had my fourth child at 35. No problems, no complications.<br>  <br>  It is normal to be concerned about fertility.  I worried about it before I started trying to conceive.  I now have 4 (LOL). Chances are there is nothing wrong with your fertility but if you are unreasonably worried about it you can always have testing done to be sure.|`|BuJIQ8Jhaa	Be careful what you wish for,,, a bunch of kids means more child support,  Or at least 20 years of trying to raise them right.|`|uKSsXz2iaa	It's common among men.|`|Sr1kywKFaa	You at least recognize that this fear is unreasonable, which is the first step. Let's put this into perspective- as a man, you can create children for the rest of your life. Men have impregnated women well into their 60s and beyond. You are 25, way too young to be paranoid about it. If you truly are concerned about your own fertility, then you can have your sperm tested, though it will be at a cost. Moving beyond yourself, finding someone young enough shouldn't be your concern- you should be focusing on someone that you love enough to want to have children with.  Age shouldn't be your prime focus. Fertility treatments are increasingly becoming more advanced than ever, so should that women can have children into their 40s. Anything beyond that is hard, because having children is a large physical energy requirement, and your energy level decreases as you age. Bottom line is that you shouldn't feel any pressure at your age. And besides, you seem to be irrationally focusing on conception- perhaps if you wanted a child and couldn't, you can always adopt a baby.|`|sCCjAKllaa	It is for me, yes.<br>  <br>  I'm 21, but I often see kids all happy with their parents, and I wonder if I'll ever be able to share that happiness. I believe most of it is me just thinkin about it too deeply, but it is a reasonable fear in many regards, too. I suggest you don't look into it a bit too much, because it'll only enhance your pressure, and before you know it, you'll just make it seem 100% obvious you won't have kids. Most of your issues derives from the mental part, anyway, so you need to be more confident in your abilities.|`|67NqWxuGaa	you could try a free technique at www.emofree.com that really works on this and other feelings.... then you will have it for anything in the future also... this is not spam, it works.

You might not be getting good REM sleep and that is why you hit a wall in the mid-day.  If you have a person you sleep with ask questions about your sleep patterns that you might not know about (i.e. the snoring) And then make a doctors appointment to get a referral to a sleep specialist.  It is so worth it.

LOL<br>  <br>  I think around 6-8:30 you need to get out and do something. Perhaps go to the gym and workout. You'll find that after a hard day of sitting behind a desk, nothing is more refreshing than moving your body and breaking a sweat. Then once you've finished your workout...come home...take a shower...eat dinner...and then BAM! You'll be asleep faster than you can say "bun and thigh rocker". You'll wake up in the morning refreshed. If you stick to a routine like this, then you're on your way to good regulated sleep and killer "buns and thighs". ; )|`|cd3d6652026769d6c622057ae1142194aa	Strangely enough, you're getting too much sleep =) slip back to a normal sleeping schedule like going to bed at 10 or 11 every night and then just getting up when you have to.

5ta5yyWSaa	If your thyroid isn't putting out enough hormones it will need medication to regain balance. It is the thermostat of the body. You can't just stop taking the medication which is usually for life.  Age, tumors, cancer and possibly genetics all play a role. It could be caused by inflammation of the thyroid gland which leaves a large percentage of the cells of the thyroid damaged (or dead) and incapable of producing sufficient hormone. This can happen years after the inflammation. Hashimoto's Disease or surgery to remove the thyroid gland are also causes.|`|n7KCez59aa	Hi !<br>  <br>  What causes hypothyroidism?<br>  In the United States, the most common cause is Hashimoto's thyroiditis. It causes the body’s immune system to attack thyroid tissue. As a result, the gland can't make enough thyroid hormone. <br>  <br>  Other things that can lead to low levels of thyroid hormone include surgery to remove the thyroid gland and radiation therapy for cancer. Less common causes include viral infections and some drugs, such as lithium. <br>  <br>  Hypothyroidism can be easily treated using thyroid hormone medicine. The most effective and reliable thyroid replacement hormone is man-made (synthetic). After starting treatment, you will have regular visits with your doctor to make sure you have the right dose of medicine.
4flomCyJaa	Anemia is having too little hemoglobin - not iron. If you have an iron deficiency, I can't really help you, but if you're anemic, you probably got a blood transfusion when you were younger - getting someone else's hemoglobin-rich blood instantly raises your hemoglobin level. You can still get a blood transfusion now, but that is usually saved for people with a very low hemoglobin level (around 6 - norm can be 12-17). Try taking folic acid - it helps you to produce more red blood cells (and thus, more hemoglobin). I think only up to 800mcg tablets are available OTC, but if you talk to your doctor, you can get a prescription for a 1mg pill.|`|fMilDRgLaa	I get injections of procrit for anemia but it is caused by my kidney disease. Sometimes it is every week and other times it is bi-weekly.  Procrit makes my body produce more red blood cells.

Yn6pM2Xyaa	I used to work in Ontario and the disability coverage for people on it was minimal, you would be covered for all basic needs but nothing fancy, all of that would come out of your own pocket if you wanted.  likeif you wanted a crown made from porcelain rather than metal etc.  there are also limitations on how often services can be performed though with things like severe gum disease etc the dentist can write to the appropriate government office and request more coverage temporarily.  It is generally harder to find a dentist who will take you as a patient as they tend to limit the number of patients (if at all truth be told) on disability that they will accept- mostly because they only get apid a fraction of what the dental services acctually cost for everyone else.    Call your disability office for specific coverage explainations.
gBRY2YEEaa	actually it will help you.  you see researchers have discovered that the nutrients in meals are absorbed more quickly when spread out among the day.<br>    Also the metabolism of your body will kick in faster and when your metabolism is up, your body naturally burns more calories.  Hope it will work for you like it did for me.|`|hR87A418aa	NO.. U HAVE TO EXERCISE..|`|1dJoqM9xaa	Yes, you will lose weight eating smaller portioned more frequent meals throughout the day than you would if you were to eat three "square" meals. In a nutshell this is what happens: Smaller meals (which need to be specific in nature and portion) eaten more frequently throughout the day, will speed up your metabolism thus resulting in you body burning more calories. I myself eat 7-8 meals a day in conjunction with weight lifting and a cardio routine. Smaller meals in turn force your body to "store up" energy in the form of fat until its sure its getting its' next meal. <br>  Unfortunatly, its not an  easy or quick method of weight loss. It takes major dedication to prior planning of meals usually a week in advance of what you plan on eating. The payoff takes a minimum of 8-10 weeks before you really start to notice considerable changes (depending on how much you have to lose). But , the good side of it is its reliability of effectiveness. If you develop a good strategy of meals, stick to eating them, and make realistic goals for yourself you will definitly lose weight and have a better chance of keeping it off than other fad diets.<br>  Eating clean foods (frequently- about every 2hrs.), mild weight lifting, and a cardio routing is the best balance for general weight loss.
vsaaaSsAaa	You can detect pregnancy 2-5 days before your missed period with most pregnancy tests.  <br>  <br>  If your last period was Feb 12, you would be most likely to get pregnant around Feb 21st.  And your missed period would be around March 7th.|`|hSvQqSRqaa	You need to wait until next saturday february 28 for the test to be accurate. The test is most accurate two weeks after having sex.

5PIgZ7tFaa	Maybe your parents thought that since you had therapy, you're "cured." Depression is a complex and persistent disorder, and relapses are common. Somehow you are going to have to get them to realize that depression is a serious disorder, and there are no quick fixes. <br>      Your dad's complaints that you don't get involved may mean that they are frustrated with the apathy that is common with depression. Maybe if you got more involved they might warm to you. It may be that they think you're not trying hard enough. I know this is unfair, but it is common. They might have fallen into the mistake of stigmatizing you.<br>       Try sitting your family down and explaining how you feel. Encourage them to get on the Web and find out as much as they can about depression. <br>        It is important that you stay connected with your family. Try to force yourself  to participate more in family stuff; if they see that you are doing your best, they might be more understanding of your disorder.|`|67NqWxuGaa	Yeah, go to www.emofree.com.... this is a free site that will explain itself if you read there... and should help you a lot if you apply the free technique found in the free manual there....   it will help, look into it....try it at least...|`|a6rvseCxaa	You farted in McDonalds, what??

You aren't alone in this, as too many of the adult population simply equate depression with insanity, and don't have any empathy for others. If your parents point out you aren't involved, I would continue to point out that they are not involved, because otherwise they would all be more involved in trying to help you get well. Personally, if you are old enough, I suggest that you leave. You need to be in a better environment to get well, and therapy is just so important. If that's not an option, then you need to spend a lot more time away from home. It's clearly a toxic environment for you and being away from it would help.|`|hmMb2oMOaa	You can always talk to your school councilor, if you really want help. He/she will be there for you and help you through this. <br>  And I know how you feel...trust me. I had the same problem with my parents for years. I think they are just scared of what they don't understand. Give them time. That's all you can do|`|sCCjAKllaa	Well, as a parent, he should be able to understand you completely. It sounds like you have some serious inner issues within yourself, and most of it is not entirely your fault. The thing you have to focus on now, though, is how you can deal with it. Feeling alone is never a good feeling, but at the end of the day, all you can do is rely on yourself sometimes to see light at the end of the tunnel. You can do it, too. It may not seem like you can, but you know yourself better then everyone else, so it's easy for you to see things a certain way while they obviously can't.<br>  <br>  I suggest havin a serious talk with your dad, though. In some way, shape or form, he needs to learn why you do the things you do, and needs to really focus on givin you all of the help an guidance you need to get you through this.<br>  <br>   Hope all goes well with you.

Eat maybe 1-2 meals a day instead of three, and drink lots of COLD water. Make sure its cold, because it makes your body work harder. And exercise. :)|`|hUfgIX3eaa	You can't lose 10-15 lbs in two weeks in a healthy manner.  Most weight loss programs and doctors will recommend losing 2 lbs. max per week.  The Alli supplement is expensive, but can help you make 2 lbs. per week into 3 per week following a healthy diet and exercise program.  If you must lose faster, try the lemonade cleanse, it is a fast to detoxify your system and clear out your digestive tract.  It is healthy to do every so often even if you are not trying to lose weight.  You could also try cabbage soup, make your own from fresh ingredients and keep it low sodium to prevent water retention.  Eat it for lunch and dinner, keep breakfast healthy, fruit and yogurt.  You can find good recipes on the web.|`|qhJZrYB9aa	there really isn't a healthy way to lose weight in that short amount of time.  Starving yourself is not the answer, i did it and now im anorexic.

Eat (at least) three times a day. <br>  Because when you eat only once a day, your metabolism gets slower than it already is! That's the main reason. Sounds funny, but to lose weight... you must eat (the right things, of course) <br>  ? Eat low-fat, high-fiber foods such as salads and vegetable pastas.<br>  ? Your last meal should be before 18:00. Try. <br>  OK, one apple after 18:00 <br>  ? Don't starve <br>  Starvation is not good for losing weight, nor your health. <br>  Starvation is the worse thing you can do in a weight loss diet. <br>  ? Try oatmeal instead of cornflakes for breakfast--eating oatmeal can help reduce cholesterol levels, and its high fiber content will keep you full longer.<br>  <br>  WHAT to drink for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Drink 6-8 glasses of water every day ! <br>  Can be tap, plain, mineral, sparkling. I just love mineral sparkling water! <br>  This improves your bowel, reduces the "hunger" sensation, and hydrates your skin. Your skin will look much better after the first weeks! <br>  Don't believe the slogan "water makes me fat". Beside being stupid... you might get into serious troubles with your kidneys. <br>  ? Drink ONLY natural juices, freshly squeezed! <br>  Don't drink Coca Cola, Pepsi, Spite etc. during the diet. Even lite or light versions. <br>  <br>  <br>  Exercise for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? If you want quicker results - exercise would be good. <br>  ? Don't just sit in front of the TV and eat peanuts... <br>  I guarantee THIS won't work for your weight loss... <br>  ? Start a regular exercise program and stick with it. Don't be afraid of those sweat suits and Lycra pants! <br>  ? Start swimming. Swimming is an excellent exercise to get involved with, since it increases blood flow and uses muscles we don't regularly use. Start a swimming program and try to do it 3 times a week. You will feel excellent and rejuvenated.<br>  ? Choose an exercise program that you enjoy, and don't shun the unconventional. For instance, did you know that regular vigorous dancing is exercise too?<br>  ? Also Cardiovascular exercises such as running, jogging, or aerobics will help you lose that unwanted belly fat. Weight training can also help you lose body fat because the more muscle mass you have, the more ability your system has to burn body fat.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  Hope this helps~

I set the weight so that it is tiring the first two sets and is getting more difficult to lift by the third.

It had normal pain from surgery but it was taken care of with pain meds. at first and then motrin later on. Good luck and just think of how pretty you will look and how good you will feel when this is taken care of.|`|uDOVf2vvaa	My husband had it done and he swears it was one of the best things ever. He was in a good deal of pain once the meds that they gave to knock him out wore off, but they give you pain meds to take so it wasn't that bad. The whole thing took about two hours. Then they tape your whole head up and you have to ice it all the time. But he looked so awesome when they were completely done healing. He recommends it to everyone who ask him about it. The only problem is one ear came lose just a little and the dr. had to go in and fix it. The dr. didn't charge him to fix it, but he did have to pay the anesthesiologist again. In both our opinion's it was worth it. Tell your friend good luck and I hope it goes good.|`|uV54p794aa	One of my daughter's best friends had the operation. It was extremely painful afterwards. The surgery itself didn't last real long, maybe 45 minutes or so. This girl had her knee operated on before her ears and she said the ears were MUCH more painful, because it's almost impossible  to sleep afterwards. Don;t tell your friend this, as she is already scared, just be prepared to be really compassionate afterwards. Today her ears look great & they don't stick out anymore. She had the operation done when she was about 12 years old ( it was that bad) and now she is a stunning 17 year old woman. She says it was worth it, but she said she will never forget that pain.....gl!|`|bpeUMPAHaa	It doesnt hurt at all,the operation didnt take that long,it was definitly worth it as my ears dont stick out through my hair any more!!!!1|`|74bab6c1ae1e088c586807a5eec9d8beaa	how do you get your ears pinned back?

n7KCez59aa	Hi !<br>  <br>  Most swollen glands or lumps under the skin are not cause for concern. The glands (lymph nodes) on either side of the neck, under the jaw, or behind the ears commonly swell when you have a cold or sore throat. <br>  <br>  More serious infections may cause the glands to enlarge and become very firm and tender. Glands can also swell and become tender after an injury, such as a cut or bite, or when a tumor or infection occurs in the mouth, head, or neck.
143bm6cnaa	Thanks for the two points.  You idiot.|`|ObIGVYbwaa	yeah ive heard its a really common problem, just ask anyone...personally i would reccomend Dr Pat Mabutt|`|XYzWRPoLaa	I reccomend Dr. Bendover.<br>  <br>  Good luck with the ***-crack.|`|CCnej03qaa	Haha your questions......|`|874EAxkfaa	dr buti should be able to tape it.

It takes time and antibiotics. Only 10% of sore throats are actually strep, so your doctor would have to take a throat culture to be sure. <br>  <br>  Chicken noodle or broth based soups, bread, crackers, 7 up, ginger ale and other soft foods. No tamales for awhile!  Ice water helps too!
vsaaaSsAaa	When you do Kegal exercises, it will also feel like you are clenching the anal muscles too.  You are definitely doing it the right way!  <br>  <br>  I don't think you can make them easier.  (Maybe eat more protein to build muscle??? haha)|`|tP4Bx4OWaa	Hold in a pee mid-flow , and that locates the correct muscles you pull. And is a test- if you cannot stop the pee mid-flow, but continue to dribble, then your muscles are not in good condition .Just flex in and out when you remember .|`|l7GjBVvhaa	There are no foods or drinks you can take. There is a cream out there for people who after children want to tighten their vaginal walls. The cream is called VirginCream. You can buy it online. It helps tighten the walls of your vagina. It is not an overnight miracle cream though. You need to stick with it. <br>  <br>  As for the Kegel moves. These muscles are attached to the pelvic bone and act like a hammock, holding in your pelvic organs. So it will feel like that. As long as your abel to stop your pee for a few seconds at a time then release and do again you are doing it right. Also the elevator move is good. You Tighten for a millisecond then release and do again for the duration of your urination period. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Be seeing you...|`|8I24u0BIaa	the muscles that you use to stop the urine from coming out are the kegel muscles. just practice acting like you are trying to stop urinating . do it everytime you go to the bathroom and you will improve them greatly.the results were great for me|`|t26ctJdraa	i just squeeze my butt cheeks. and i know its working cuz sex is so much better
nIN8avGwaa	I used Or tho Tri-Cyclen for about a year and never had any problems with it. We used it as our sole method of birth control and had no "accidents." I also had a very irregular period and it helped to regulate it so that it was actually at the same time each month. It's the only type of pill I used, but it worked very well for me.|`|jtjISk6qaa	i like it. i didnt gain weight, no spotting, no side effects for me, and the best part is im not pregnant!<br>  <br>  and you can also get cool little dispenser things from their website
skJihSWSaa	Your symptoms are like reading the DSM for borderline personality disorder. I'm in no position to diagnose however. I would approach your doctor by saying your finding your life hard to cope with, and that you've been putting it off for some time but you need help. They'll then most likely ask in what way can't you cope and you can list everything you said above. Hope this helped.|`|E9Xn0cY0aa	I agree, tell ur GP exactly what you've said here. Write it down in bullet points and run through one at a time cos its easy to go blank when ur nervous and you enter the GPs room. Ur GP will not think ur a total nut case like your worried about, instead they will actively try and help you.<br>  <br>  So, in summary - tell GP - write it down and take the list of problems with you - don't worry  - us GPs see people with symptoms similar to urs all the time :-)|`|gXjJg6swaa	the doctor wont think your a nut case i basica;;y have what you described and i see it more as a lack of emotional response to the world which is usually caused by great amounts of emotional trauma at some point in your life|`|SsXNL74Aaa	sounds like me ... classic borderline personality disorder im afraid. but your symptoms sound soooooooo text book|`|dbgxhAT4aa	This sounds like you're depressed.<br>  This isn't anything to worry about!<br>  If your assumptions are right, then he'll be experienced with these sorts of "cases".

If you are concerned that you may be gaining weight, try cutting out sodas and sugar products, they are a likely cause of weight gain in most people (my husband lost 30 pounds from 200 @ 6'2" to 170 just from quitting sodas).  At your weight I doubt that you should lose weight, but it is good advice for anyone. Also, have you ever tried weight lifting? You may want to try this to help improve your shape if this is your concern. Losing weight will not change your shape, but weightlifting will-i.e. lunges give lift to the booty, bicep curls and triceps extensions tone arms, etc...|`|581d3e6d1f6271aa31d16117d9703a38aa	I think you're doing fine i mean usually tall people weight more...And as you get older you'll gain weight.

fvuEtkROaa	If you are on the average 28 day cycle, your period should be starting very soon. Periods are counted from the FIRST day of one to the FIRST day of the next. Cycle lengths vary among women from 21 days to 35 days.   If you are not using any birth control, I suggest you get to your health care provider and get started on something.|`|9fb74469d3f937feeed0a568c9da83feaa	I think is the plan B : )... that kind of pills just mess up with your cicles... The dark brown discharge still being blood, (((it is not "old" blood))) <br>  <br>  That's normal. Its just normal blood that doesn't have certain cells in it or something- I read somewhere that its a warning your period will start soon.
gVMmdeLcaa	well it could be palpitations or fluttering if it feels like its racing... so u should go see a dr - but dnt panic... that can be caused by minor things.. otherwise ur just less fit than u shud be.. and u shud try exercising more to help keep ur heart healthy.|`|UmSDoQXZaa	Are you scaring yourself? Do you exercise too much? Don't worry, this happens to everyone. But if you're worried, and your blood pressure is abnormal, you might want to check with a doctor. S/he can tell you much more.|`|YhYSZlroaa	idk that seems like alot<br>  i would go to the doctor right away if i were you|`|vsaaaSsAaa	I have this too.   I have low blood pressure also, and that's the cause--- especially when I am standing.  Try taking your pulse when you're laying down.  <br>  Do you exercise?  I'm 24 years old and thin, but very out of shape... I think that's what's to blame for the high resting heart rate.
bmWKETgWaa	Sure, they could be wrong.  However, as your pregnancy progressed, the size of your uterus was monitored.  An ultrasound was probably done, which would reveal a lot about your fetus.  If you remind your doctors of your unusual periods when you became pregnant, they'll be better equipped to modify their estimate of your delivery date.<br>  <br>  So meanwhile, be prepared for a February baby!  And if they're right about March, well that's a nice time of year to have a baby too.|`|vsaaaSsAaa	They can also confirm your due date by looking at size of the baby, size of the stomach, and measurements of hCG.  If the doctor hasn't mentioned any discrepancy, then you should assume your estimated due date is accurate. (A whole month off would raise some flags when they do these other measurements)
AA10561400	YES|`|SltEwVX7aa	yeah, it's from the clamps they put on the skin to hold things tight.  Loved the Barney reference.  My penis looked like that after I got circumcised.<br>  <br>  You'll be fine.|`|dkoGI9nfaa	After surgery in in the groin area it looks terrible.  I can understand your concern but it is really not necessary.  I had a inguinal hernia operation last year.  They did it laproscopically.  They doctor told me dead blood will settle in my scrotal sack.  When it happened it could not believe how bad it looked.  Also discoloured the base of my penis.  It really looked bad.  It all went away.  100%.  Totally.  Completely.  You will be fine.  I took photos of it and when I now look at them I cannot believe how bad it looked but it is perfect now.  So don't worry.|`|LYeMqJIRaa	I just had testicular surgery last week and my genitals look like they belong to Barney the dinosaur.  Give it time.  Put some clean gauze on and check to see if it gets stained with blood (it could also be stained from the antiseptic on your skin.  Put some antibiotic ointment on the incision site to help prevent infection. For me there was much more bruising than when I had surgery on my legs. Like the other guys said it is a very sensitive area|`|AA10331437	Yes, it is a very sensitive area and anytime of surgery will cause discoloration for a few days or maybe even a week.  You will notice a change as you heal....less black and blue coloring and swelling will go down.  Just give it time.  Remember to keep the area clean and keep changing the dressing daily or maybe twice daily.  <br>  <br>  You will be ok.  Just relax and let time work its wonders...
ODvnyAdlaa	you are not fat at all be happy and confident with yourself, weight does not equal happiness at they end of the day they are just numbers. xx|`|AA11032982	Ok so that's not very overweight but if you still want to lose more you can lose about 15 lbs and you'll be ideal weight. Just stay active and eat healthy. Remember you just need 7 minutes of very strenuous exercise every week.  that's IT. but it has to be VERY hard exercise, like running as fast as you can! But I still wouldn't worry about your weight THAT much unless it gets out of hand. But still always eat healthy.|`|MoUtk7cUaa	first for the people who don't know, 1 stone is ~14 lb.s<br>  since you're still growing, don't get too hung up on this.<br>  i personally never found heavier girls attractive, but this doesn't mean you're unhealthy or that others won't find you attractive. to be honest, you're not really in that bad of shape, but don't let it get out of control before you're finished growing, around the age of 23.  then it will be even more difficult to change.|`|tKfOcgDlaa	I am nervous|`|vKlMdtpaaa	at that age some girls do as its down to periods etc.<br>  <br>  at your height i wouldn't worry too much about your weight because you seem pretty active most of the time. if you are on the pill or something similar, then part of the side effects of the pill is weight gain, usually water retention.<br>  <br>  just keep up what you are doing, you will soon burn it off.|`|zfD0NX5oaa	l0l.

Don't worry about your weight.<br>  <br>  You're fine (:|`|dJuEtGxraa	Here are a few tips;<br>  <br>  WHEN to eat for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Eat (at least) three times a day. <br>  Because when you eat only once a day, your metabolism gets slower than it already is! That's the main reason. Sounds funny, but to lose weight... you must eat (the right things, of course) <br>  ? Eat low-fat, high-fiber foods such as salads and vegetable pastas.<br>  ? Your last meal should be before 18:00. Try. <br>  OK, one apple after 18:00 <br>  ? Don't starve <br>  Starvation is not good for losing weight, nor your health. <br>  Starvation is the worse thing you can do in a weight loss diet. <br>  ? Try oatmeal instead of cornflakes for breakfast--eating oatmeal can help reduce cholesterol levels, and its high fiber content will keep you full longer.<br>  <br>  WHAT to drink for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Drink 6-8 glasses of water every day ! <br>  Can be tap, plain, mineral, sparkling. I just love mineral sparkling water! <br>  This improves your bowel, reduces the "hunger" sensation, and hydrates your skin. Your skin will look much better after the first weeks! <br>  Don't believe the slogan "water makes me fat". Beside being stupid... you might get into serious troubles with your kidneys. <br>  ? Drink ONLY natural juices, freshly squeezed! <br>  Don't drink Coca Cola, Pepsi, Spite etc. during the diet. Even lite or light versions. <br>  <br>  <br>  Exercise for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? If you want quicker results - exercise would be good. <br>  ? Don't just sit in front of the TV and eat peanuts... <br>  I guarantee THIS won't work for your weight loss... <br>  ? Start a regular exercise program and stick with it. Don't be afraid of those sweat suits and Lycra pants! <br>  ? Start swimming. Swimming is an excellent exercise to get involved with, since it increases blood flow and uses muscles we don't regularly use. Start a swimming program and try to do it 3 times a week. You will feel excellent and rejuvenated.<br>  ? Choose an exercise program that you enjoy, and don't shun the unconventional. For instance, did you know that regular vigorous dancing is exercise too?<br>  ? Also Cardiovascular exercises such as running, jogging, or aerobics will help you lose that unwanted belly fat. Weight training can also help you lose body fat because the more muscle mass you have, the more ability your system has to burn body fat.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  Hope this helps~<br>  <br>  (Average for teens)<br>  5'0" = 94.5lbs <br>  5'1" = 98lbs<br>  5'2" = 101lbs<br>  5'3" = 104.5lbs<br>  5'4" = 107.5lbs<br>  5'5" = 111lbs<br>  5'6" = 114.5lbs<br>  5'7" = 118lbs<br>  5'8" = 122lbs<br>  5'9" = 125lbs<br>  <br>  (Average for adult females 20+yrs)<br>  5'0" = 100lbs <br>  5'1" = 105lbs<br>  5'2" = 110lbs<br>  5'3" = 115lbs<br>  5'4" = 120lbs<br>  5'5" = 125lbs<br>  5'6" = 130lbs<br>  5'7" = 135lbs<br>  5'8" = 140lbs<br>  5'9" = 145lbs<br>  <br>  This is based on adult BMI charts for women.|`|wzM5WB8Xaa	You are putting on weight rapidly, because you are likely going through puberty.

And you will be more toned.  <br>  <br>  Just eat healthily and take care of yourself, if you don't, the weight could catch up with you sooner than you think, and you will kick yourself for wishing you could put on weight lol.|`|tERrqwzaaa	have a peanut butter + jam sandwich before you go to bed :]<br>  its healthy, protein and all that but like quite heavy on the stomache!<br>  <br>  make small changes, go to full fat milk instead of semi skimmed, white bread instead of wholemeal etc :)<br>  <br>  good luck <br>  xo

AA11292270	Yes, I quit AA.  Not because of the "alcoholic" label, although I have stopped using it for the most part (I've been sober more than ten years, and it doesn't feel right to continue to self-identify with a problem I don't have anymore).<br>  <br>  Actually, I quit because over the long term I found that AA ideology (particularly the concept of "powerlessness") was, at least for me, incompatible with continued emotional growth and health.  Not only that, but many of the other members were, well, completely out of their minds.  It got really old to watch the drama, the constant hooking up, the frequent relapsing, etc.  <br>  <br>  As per AA ideology, when I left, although I was 9 years sober, I was told that I would soon relapse and that I was signing my own death warrant.  It's 18 months later, and I'm still just fine.|`|inH6jIrhaa	Yes I quit. I started using again. 2 and a half months I had another stroke. last night I went to a meeting. It has been 10 years since a meeting but I can't do it alone. The only bad part was people trying to hug me but hey they are probably saving my life. Really it is what the person needs. I need to talk and need help. Many people don't. There is hope. There is always hope. When I quit meetings before I was about 22 and an idiot. Anyway it has to help a little right? I will take any help I can get because I don't want to die yet, I'm only32.

ft8t98Pnaa	Yellow stool can be associated with gallbladder disease.  With the liver tests "elevated", you may want to ask if the bilirubin level was elevated as well.  If so, that may be an explanation for the color.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  As for causes, you can consider an abdominal ultrasound for initial evaluation.  This can determine if there are any blockages in the common bile duct (i.e. as shown by any dilation).  <br>  <br>  <br>  Occasionally, you may see undigested food fragments in stool. This usually is high-fiber vegetable matter, which isn't digested by the enzymes in your digestive tract. Undigested food in stool generally isn't a problem unless it's accompanied by persistent diarrhea, weight loss or other changes in your bowel habits. If you have such signs and symptoms consult your doctor|`|8HDQMkSBaa	you REALLY need to go see a Doctor!!!!|`|13k2WKx8aa	Have you been going heavy on the antacids as of recently?<br>  <br>  Sounds to be gastrointestinal. Irritable Bowell Syndrome considering the yellow in the stool (which could likely just be mucus).<br>  <br>  Set a Dr.s Appointment and have them look under IBS.<br>  <br>  So my guess is going to be at two separate things. The heartburn could be unrelated entirely (possibly Acid Refulx?). Going heavy on antacids would explain the partially undigested food and the yellow in the stool would explain the IBS WITH the undigested food.<br>  <br>  The undigested food also means your body is trying to purge something with a quickness.<br>  <br>  For a year? Is there any pain in your abdomen? It's a long shot and probably wrong, but a tape worm can also cause your stool misery.|`|MQ1QVNXbaa	Do you have a bland taste in your mouth?<br>  Intestinal rumbling/cramping?<br>  Check your tongue in a mirror is it pale and enlarged?<br>  If so something may be wrong with your spleen.<br>  A colonoscopy can be considered as an initial evaluation when you see your doctor.|`|874EAxkfaa	first ,I would guess you are overweight, one fat hog! at least for your body size. i don't mean you weigh 300lbs, but you are too fat for you! start by dropping 10lbs and i bet you will see some improvement.what goes in comes out.|`|OLTjkS4zaa	I saw something like this on one of those medical shows.  It took a very long time for the person to be diagnosed.  So sorry but I can't remember what it was called.  Make a Dr. appointment.  If you are unable to see a doctor with in a day or two you might want to consider finding a Dr. who can see you sooner, or if your heart is sent on the hard to get a hold of Dr. then make the appointment AND go to the walk-in-clinic.  You always have 24 hours to cancel if the walk-in-clinic helps you out.  Also I would do some internet research because if my memories serves me correctly that is how this lady on the medical show was able to get diagnosed.|`|sDfBDXpXaa	Your best bet it to see someone who can use muscle testing or kenisiology on you.

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).<br>  You need to occupy yourself all the time so as not to be bored and not to succumb to emotional eating.|`|7Q7dFghmaa	Eat Funyuns.|`|778827aa11aaa1341c23ec56d63c39bcaa	Start exercising more.

It's a pain in the butt but you can eat practically anything as long as you eat small portions of it and stall within your calorie range. I did this and lost 15lbs.. But you gotta work hard to keep them off. You can use the website www.livestrong.com or www.thedailyplate.com. They will help you count the calories you eat and track your exercise. If you want to eat more and you already finished your calories for the day, you just have to exercise until you burn off some of the calories again and then you can eat again. It's gets easier after time. Now I kinda know how much calories each thing has, and you can look at nutrition labels and figure them out. And just stay within your range. the websites i gave you calculate how many calories your body needs to lose 2lbs a week. that should be good because than you will keep it off. Good luck|`|FlmQ2MYNaa	I think the fastest way to lose weight is on a low carb diet, but this isn't the best option for you right now if you are breast feeding.  The only problem with that diet is when you start eating carbs again, the weight comes back.  If you are breastfeeing, you will lose the baby weight, but this takes months and you have to eat well and exercise.  <br>  <br>  To lose it permanently, you have to do it slow.  Losing 1 - 2 pounds a week should be the goal - you will keep it off longer this way.  Cardio and eating well - that's the way to do it.  <br>  <br>  But seriously, give yourself some time!  You just had a baby!  Your body was stressed for 9 months, give it a break. Hopefully your husband will understand.  You deserve a break!|`|UQBCj2q2aa	In my opinion the best way to lose weight is from extended cardio. You should start running long distances. If possible three miles a day is what I usually run. If that sounds rediculous, work your way up slowly. Also, dont run on a treadmill, its boring and harder to run on. Running not only burns tons of calories, but it is amazing at reducing your hunger.|`|j7P5QAt7aa	well you should rlly be focusing on ur child rite now but..<br>  stay away from things that are "white" like bread and rice it brings on a bunch of carbs.

Ugh lol I'm trying to revise for my March ones right now. Kinda getting distracted atm!<br>  <br>  Okay so to start of you could make a revision schedule.<br>  <br>  Whatever you make don't plan it for a long period of time but for like say a week. Some people find it's better to concentrate on one subject and others find it's better to do different ones so they don't get bored. You should do about 10-30 minutes a session (and then hange the subject for the next session) and then take a break. You should at least spend 2/3 hours a day. Leave one day to give yourself a rest though. Prepare beforehand make check lists of things you already know and things you don't, or what you need help at and so on.<br>  <br>  Switch of everything that can distract you (like music, the computer etc.). Also find a place that's comfy for you, and not like say a boring old study room where you can't concentrate! Do something where you can work properly.<br>  <br>  You can break stuff down into 10, 20 or 30 minutes and swap it between different subjects. If you are somebody who gets distracted easily strictly do 10 minute sessions! & If you feel brave you can do longer than that I sometimes can work for an hour non-stop!<br>  <br>  When you make a revision timetable don't make it too hard either cos you won't stick to it. Now that I make mine easier I actually stick to it.<br>  <br>  Oh and you need to find your own revision methods, I like making notes, doing podcasts, posters, cards etc. find what works best for you. Make it look interesting though not boring but colourful and attractive so you will look at it. Ask friends or family to test you as well.<br>  <br>  Also when you go home from school you can note down what you have done and try making useful notes during lesson times.<br>  <br>  To remember things try sticking stuff up your wall or places where you go past a lot at home or somewhere. There is this story technique and basically if you for example need to know the reactivity of metals you will have to write them down first and next to it write a familiar word next to it. Then you could make a story with the familiar words and you could remember it.<br>  <br>  If you don't like revising from books etc. you can go on things like BBC Bitesize, or Samlearning and loads of other revision websites. BBC has a lot of podcasts and stuff for French and Science.<br>  <br>  Don't leave revision too late though or else you might regret it. You would be like I wish I had done better than and trust me you don't want to be retaking exams and so on it will be too much!<br>  <br>  Of course don't do it excessively have fun now and then as well. Little treats and rewards help as well. ;)

ot0WW8lZaa	Well if I can save you the trouble, nothing on legalbud.com works. If you wanna order a legal herb that will get you ****** up, try salvia. And yeah; you can. They might say that you need to be 18, but they have no way of checking since they won't ask for signature unless if it's a big package and even in that case, they usually just leave it at your door if nobody answers. Hoe do you plan on ordering it though? If you use your parent's credit card it's gonna come up as a bill from whatever site you ordered and if your parents aren't aware that you ordered it, they're gonna question a bill that they have no knowledge of; meaning that they will eventually find out that it was you that ordered it. I think you can pay by cash if you order through ebay though.|`|22621f93a7534ed2f1a71acf45cf11a4aa	ask your parents to do it for you just in case|`|Q8fcepcZaa	they have no way of checking. you can buy what you want, you could buy knives and all sorts on ebay if you wanted. you will usually only have to sign for a package thats too big to fit in your letterbox.<br>  <br>  EDIT: salvia isnt something you wanna be doing regularly, but if you want a weed substitute that actually works, try spice gold. i think real weed is healthier, but spice gold definitely works.
AA11538461	My son became lactose intolerant at 15 months old.  Stay on the lactose free milk.  After a couple of weeks of normal stools, give him one cup of regular milk.  If he gets diarrhea again, you can feel certain that he is lactose intolerant.  He may also have trouble with cheese and yogurt.  You may want to give him calcium supplements.|`|Gt9PsLr4aa	Firstly if youre seeing a doctor that isnt taking you seriously in your requests while your son is experiencing pain I would see a new doctor to do the testing.<br>  You dont exactly NEED the testing (you can rule it out on your own if you'd like. But its more solid evidence if thats what youre looking for)<br>  <br>  There are two tests you can have done. One is through endoscopy and one is a breathalyzer-like test.<br>  <br>  I would already guess your son is lactose intolerant from what you're describing but what you can do is keep him completely lactose free for two weeks, then on the third week introduce a little lactose and see how his stools and moods are.<br>  If he gets cranky or cries of an upset stomach or strong gas. If he suffers from the symptoms I would think its safe to say he is LI.<br>  <br>  He may be able to eat some cheeses and yogurts though depending on the severity so its not all bad (:<br>  Especially certain cheeses like cheddar have less lactose, and yogurt with active cultures are less likely to cause lactose problems.<br>  <br>  If he is just make sure he is getting enough calcium from other places i.e.:<br>  broccoli<br>  beans<br>  soy milk<br>  tofu<br>  etc<br>  <br>  If he handles cheeses and whatnot better you could even have him take a lactase enzyme supplement (such as Lactaid) just before he eats. These can be taken in drops or tablets and even added directly to milk (they tend to make milk taste a bit sweeter if left for a long time). Which help alot.
nAp688tZaa	I never experienced weight loss, but did experience weight gain, even though I did not change a thing about my diet and exercise routine.  I do know that weight gain is one of the most common side effects of this medication.  However, if you find that it is working for you, to control whatever condition you are being treated for, then keep taking it, so long as any of the other side effects, such as fatigue and mood swings, are not bearable.  If you are one of the lucky people that get to experience weight loss, then good for you, especially if it is treating your condition well.|`|j9ta5ulqaa	I also gained weight on Lyrica.

yijmoNbSaa	It may be called TMJ.<br>  <br>  Your dentist CAN make an appliance that you can wear at night to keep your teeth from chattering and causing trauma to your jaw with which you must suffer during-the-day.  He/she will have to make a cast of your teeth, and from this cast, he/she will make this appliance.<br>  <br>  What caused this?  Well, you may share my affinity for hard candy and you love crunching the hard candy too.  This crunching can cause trauma to the jaw's joint causing one of the bones to move too far away from the other bone, and there is no way, naturally, for the connection to reform.<br>  <br>  Your dentist or doctor may be able to put your jaw into traction, and this will allow the joint to heal, but that may take many WEEKS for this healing process to complete.  Can you handle having your jaw in traction for that long?  Most of us couldn't.  *laughter*|`|TX9igTWraa	it can be fixed. my jaw did the same thing until i got braces. now it is lined up back in place|`|9Gt4UxUvaa	I suffer from this also. Yes it is called TMJ, and some doctors will fix it by breaking your jaw and snapping it back into place. You have to wear a brace to help heal the jaw. However you will only find this method of fixing it down south and up north they try to create a brace for you to wear a night to keep you from constantly moving your jaw. <br>  <br>  There isn't much that can be done to fix this, but if you go to a doctor they might be able to help you.|`|FhrCLLzFaa	You most likely have TMJ. TMJ is a disorder of the temporomandibular, or jaw joint. TMJ causes pain with the movement of the jaw and the surrounding muscles, ligaments and nerves. First of all it can occur when the jaw joint itself, is worn down. Secondly TMJ can occur when the jaw joint becomes abnormal in shape due to injury. And last, but certainly not least, TMJ can occur in people who have arthritis and when the jaw joint has therefore, been affected by arthritis changes.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Also, appliances that dentists make that you wear at night for people who "GRIND THEIR TEETH" don't work. My mother has had many of them and they don't help anything and sooner or later you wear them out.

Perhaps there is a hidden illness causing your loss of appetite.  If there is something worrying you, that could be a factor.<br>  <br>  Your body really needs food, and your brain in particular does not function right unless it has a steady supply of nutrients.

b5tf7EkTaa	I'll just give you a bit of a short analysis that can help you understand what it can do. Stress depletes the brain's message sending chemicals known as neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters actually communicate every impulse, every thought you have, from one part of the brain to another. at some point, because of stress, addiction or other dysfunction, the brain literally runs out of these chemicals. This creates a communication grid lock within the brain and starts a chain reaction of damaging effects. Your body responds to emotional stress the same as it would to physical danger; an alarm is triggered. Adrenaline races through the body, commanding a series of physical changes. These days with all the stress we face, we experience anger, fear, lack of sleep, irritability, anxiety, depression, insecure feelings, and more. The constant release of these chemicals, like adrenaline, chip away at the immune system, opening the way for cancer, high blood pressure, heart disease, gastrointestinal disease, asthma and dozens of other problems.  It can lead to this: stress can cause the brain's chemical levels to diminish. This creates a sense of urgency in an individual, many people find relief from these feelings from an artificial opioid that is released by alcohol or other drugs, so addictions can take place as well and these substances create more damages.<br>  <br>  To my opinion, stress is a bad guy.|`|A9etUnnfaa	stress makes you tired, lazy and depressed, a good stress reliever is going as far away as possible you can get from what stresses you...taking a long walk works.|`|tb67ss8Naa	Stress causesyour body to shut down and protect it's self.

SQ39aHSoaa	my 14 year old daughter used to do that.  she was waking up around the same time in the middle of the night around 2 or 3 a.m. and panicking and thinking she was going to vomit again....just like previous nights. seeing that she has a horrible fear of vomiting, she would get herself so worked up that she would have a panic attack and vomit every night.  the very first time she threw up was due to some bad food she ate.  it was so bad that she thought she was going to do that every night after wards.  she did off and on for weeks until we realized it was all physiological.  got her to realize that and it wasn't anything physical (doc couldn't find anything or diagnose) and she eventually grew out of it.|`|5c29536e08a5b98c6451c88a20d06461aa	See a DOCTOR right away!!!!!<br>  <br>  Could be stress, ulcer, cancer, or even poising.<br>  <br>  Not normal and any doctor should know that....|`|AA11552865	See a doctor.

heziH5K4aa	Rebound tenderness is one of the key symptoms of the diagnosis. This is when you press on the side where the pain occurs, and then withdraw the hand. It will hurt worst when you take your hand away. In addition, another sign is lie flat and raise your leg on the side of pain. You will feel sharp pain in your abdomen as you have someone press against your leg as you resist. You could also have a mild fever.

Many people feel the first pain near the belly button. Then it moves to the lower right side of the belly. But the pain can be in different parts of your belly or even on your side or back. The pain may get worse if you move, walk, or cough. You may also have a fever or feel sick to your stomach.<br>  <br>  Sometimes the only symptom is a general feeling of not being well and a pain that is hard to describe. The pain in your belly may be different than any pain you have had before. It may be severe. Or it may not seem like a very strong pain, but you may have the feeling that something is wrong. Trust your instincts.<br>  <br>  Because the diagnosis is not always easy to make, it is very important to see a doctor as soon as possible if you have symptoms.<br>  <br>  In some cases, appendicitis does not cause any symptoms except for belly pain. If you have moderate belly pain that does not go away after 4 hours, call your doctor. If you have severe belly pain, call your doctor right away. The only treatment for appendicitis is surgery to remove your appendix (appendectomy). If you have appendicitis and do not have surgery in time, your appendix can burst. A burst appendix can cause serious problems. It’s best to remove the appendix before it bursts.<br>  <br>  There are different types of surgery for appendicitis. Your surgeon may operate through a large cut (incision) in your belly or use a tool called a laparoscope to remove your appendix through a few smaller incisions. Either way, you may take antibiotics before your surgery, after your surgery, or both. There are advantages and disadvantages to each type of surgery. Talk with your surgeon about which type is best for you.<br>  <br>  If your appendix does burst, you will need antibiotics. Surgery to remove a burst appendix may be more complicated.

nykA4Vhjaa	all the above...|`|dJuEtGxraa	I think B, because theres a diet along with it, thats pretty much the most common way people lose weight.|`|XwgoLxnhaa	I have been through it all and know what's it about.  The main thing is to stick in there.  You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off.  I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.  <br>  <br>  Nothing works,  besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.  <br>  <br>  First,  depending on how much weight you need to lose,  your diet is the first concern.  You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off,  even if you are exercising a lot.  Which brings us to the next thing.  Duh,  Exercising...<br>  <br>  This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight.  Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising.  Do some cardio,  in the long run,  it's good for the heart.<br>  <br>  However,  I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off,  in my diet.  It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies.  I've found a great addition to help any one out,  it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol.  Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work.  That is true,  but not in this case.  This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch.  It's an appetite suppressant,  along with being a fat binder.  I saved money on the pills at <a href="http://starturl.com/efblc" rel="nofollow">http://starturl.com/efblc</a> along with getting some good info.  It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar.  For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full.

AekVyLneaa	Albuterol is not a decongestant.  It is a bronchodilator.  It is only recommended for Bronchoconstriction, such as seen in asthma.  All albuterol will do is loosen up the smooth muscles around the airways and that is not the source of your problem.  Mucus is the problem.  Sometimes mucus can get stuck in the airways and cause a sound that sounds like wheezing.  The best thing that you can do is see a Dr.  Since you have tried OTC meds and they have not worked, now is the time to see a Dr. for something stronger.  You may also need a round of antibiotics since you have not been able to kick this for over a month now. Best wishes!!|`|TfbTYc2Laa	Simultaneous wheezing and sinus problems may indicate failure of mucociliary system. Both the nasal membranes and lungs are equipped with an innate cleansing system called the mucociliary system. This system washes the interior of sinuses and lungs. <br>  It is based on two kinds of cells: Mucus goblets which secrete mucus and cilia which vibrate rhythmically in harmony to push mucus out like oars push water. This pushing motion creates a continuous stream of mucus, which flows fast (at a rate of six to seven millimeters per minute). The stream then continues all the way to the stomach acid.  This streaming blanket of mucus traps virtually everything in the air as it passes through the nose and lungs. Dust particles, pollens and foreign invaders such as viruses and bacteria are all stuck on the mucus-covered walls much like flies on flypaper. <br>  Constant production of mucus and the sweeping action of the cilia together form the cleansing system. <br>  This system may fail due to a myriad of reasons like inadequate water intake, excessive use of oral antihistamines or oral decongestants, being subject to high levels of dust or smoke, etc. I would recommend you increase your water intake if you do not drink 7 or more glasses of water a day. Then, you may need to take some preventive measures for your mucociliary system. <br>  In short, your solution may not be medical. I suggest registering the free course offered in www.howtogetridofsinusitis.com.|`|18AOjbgYaa	Albuterol with or without a nebulizer . Go see a doctor .

KrkftOfkaa	Yeah...going online for help for this is a bit counter-productive.  Look for support groups in your area.  I'd call a counseling center or talk to your counselor at school rather than look for it online if you want to try and break away from the internet.<br>  <br>  Other than that you need activities that ground you back in reality.  Find a sport you enjoy, join a club, reconnect with friends (that are not glued to their computer screens), etc.  Deleting all but maybe one or two of your online accounts would be a good thing.  So you will have to say "no I'm not on My Space anymore but I spend a limited amount of time on Facebook" and you're just going to have to be okay with that.

xNsJqTgaaa	You want to get bigger.  Use heavier weights, shorter movements...like doing arm curls, use the heaviest weight you can lift, but don't extend your arm fully, only about halfway.  That tears the muscle in the middle and creates bulk there, quickly, while a full extension will make you strong, but not as big.<br>  <br>  You will get bigger fastest if you concentrate on your biggest muscles....your legs.  So work on squats, I really don't know of a better exercise overall.|`|hUfgIX3eaa	Lift weights at the gym.  Many local health clubs have a fitness consultant on site that can show you proper form to achieve the bulk you want.|`|581d3e6d1f6271aa31d16117d9703a38aa	you don't want to have too many muscles,it ain't healthy, you can do interval training.|`|G1OSlub8aa	You have to be more specific. 4x10 of what exercise and at what percentage of your 1-RM?
xNsJqTgaaa	It's good, but not anything to rest on.<br>  <br>  135 (the bar and two 45s) should be something you use to warm up.  After that you should be able to bench your body weight a solid 3 times.<br>  <br>  By the time you are adult you should be able to bench more, but height is an unusual factor.  The shorter you are, the more you should be able to bench, relative to your body weight.  Shorter people tend to have shorter arms.  It's physics, the shorter arms require less work to move the weight because it's not only a shorter distance traveled, but at the bottom of the movement, there is less of an angle making the entire movement easier. <br>  <br>  The point being, if you are taller don't expect to bench double your body weight as easily as your short friends can bench double theirs.|`|J1kJb98Maa	its not great|`|ljVwo5qZaa	Since you're only 14 I guess it isn't that bad.

6e0PG4YWaa	At thirteen years old you should not be counting calories or exercising a crazy amount.  For you to be 107 lbs at the height of 5'11", there is something wrong if you think that you are fat, and you seriously want to lose more weight.  I am 5'3" and I weigh 119 lbs, and I'm thin.  I think you really should look into professional help because the way your mind is working right now, is not the proper way.  You should not be thinking the way that you are.  I highly recommend you check this site out..<a href="http://www.eatingdisorder.com/?utm_source=ans&utm_medium=pv&utm_campaign=rcx...it's" rel="nofollow">http://www.eatingdisorder.com/?utm_sourc...</a> and informational site about eating disorders and I really think that you should take a look at it.  Eating disorders are not something to mess around with, they are serious, you can seriously damage your body physically as well as mentally.  These professionals know how to handle situations such as yours.  I really highly recommend that you give the helpline a call, and speak to a professional before you really hurt yourself.  Good luck!|`|qBz0ZfzFaa	I really hope you are making this up to see what kind of responses you'll get. If not, you're crazy.

(Typically people think of bulimia as eating and purging, but there are many other characteristics that classify a bulimic, it is more of a mind set.) If you continue to view yourself this way you are certain to fall under an "anorexic" title eventually refusing to eat all together. My suggestion is to seek professional help. You need to focus on self esteem and being satisfied with who you are. Seeing the beauty you already possess on the outside and inside. I'm deeply concerned for your health. Please please please, talk to someone you know about going to a counselor. (I have a bachelor's degree in Health science and a Master's in Psychology so believe me when I say your self perception and eating habits are not healthy!)|`|4BE2ZSdZaa	yeah you sound like you have anorexia you are VERY underweight and i wouldnt lie to you, you need to see your doctor or at least tell your parents your thoughts, as you keep losing weight your mental state will get worse too im anorexic been like it for 5 years and am at risk of many health problems. if you dont want that you need to tell your parents. your not fat tell yourself i look thin 20 times a day and you may start to believe it. it isnt easy to recover when you think there is nothing wrong with you but trust me you need to get help before you become physically ill. good luck<br>  hope i helped :)|`|UHTcpdkVaa	Ewww.

2cb46ea6e0285a7d419967ceaef6f993aa	It sounds like it needs to be looked at by a doctor. You probably need an antibiotic. Also, if your tetanus vaccine is not current, you should have had that done when you got injured. (Tetanus vaccine is good for 10 years.)|`|85O36QGIaa	You definitely should see a doctor and check the date of your last tetenus shot, if you have had one at all.  Soak your hand in warm water and pour some hydrogen peroxide over the wound.  It will bubble if it is open and hopefully disinfect your wound.
E3CgJYDxaa	I had Chlamydia and didn't even know it. Although I had some of the symptoms. And I also had some symptoms of an UTI... So it was very had to pick out both. I was treated for both the infection and disease. But I didn't have sharp back pain. Maybe it could be someting else. I say go back to your doctor or find another one.

Are you taking the correct dosage on a daily basis? If you skip days, that could affect you in a negative way.  Your dosage may need to be adjusted. You don't need to continue to feel the way that you do. I wish I could help you more. You may also want to go to a christian counselor if you are a spiritual person.  Try to focus on the positive things that are going on in your life; make a list to read when you feel down.  Make a list of future goals to pursue.  I believe that you can get through this with the right counselor and medication.  God bless you sweetie!!! :)
CB4ag09Paa	So long as you're not writing them twice a week or camping out in front of their home, I wouldn't worry about it too much. You don't mention how you actually emotionally feel toward this individual. If it is like a crush, these things usually pass on their own in weeks or months. If this hasn't happened, as with any addiction, I suggest you go cold turkey. <br>  <br>  Delete all the websites on the person that you have bookmarked. Change all user names/passwords that may relate to that person. Any photos, magazines, etc that you may have put them in a box and stuff them some place (or have a friend or relative hide them from you or keep them for you). Journal if you need to about your feelings and seek out someone to talk to if necessary. And try to get involved in a variety of things, rather than focusing on only one person/thing.|`|BG8vMyZjaa	Stop worrying about it, lots of fans do the same thing and feel the same as you do.<br>  Why do you think there is so much memorabilia and so many fan clubs around?<br>  When you meet someone special that obsession will fade into obscurity, or you might just both laugh about it.|`|6Btmg7Tcaa	You realise its an obsession which is great because your not confusing the reality with the fantasy, thats only when it becomes a problem.<br>  Doing what your doing is fine, we've all done it, we've all been that way about someone at some time in our lives, i've been like it since I was 12. I'm 36 now and still obsess over someone, but it helps me. Obsessing over someone takes you away from the stresses of daily life and takes away the bordem. Life is hard and we all need an escape route, the celebrity is your escape route. <br>  <br>  When you start camping outside their house stealing money to follow them, writing them letters 24/7 and start stalking them, then you have a real problem. As long as you can keep them in your fantasy mind its great. <br>  <br>  Just remember to live your real life though, have some time each day where you dont think about the celebrity and do something else instead. That'll help keep the reality real and the celebrity safe in your fantasy and much more enjoyable|`|ckd18jUMaa	Try to start by asking yourself what is it with this person to begin with?? What is it about this person that you think you can find in a real every day person, in the next guy?? What is it about this celebrity that attracts you and that you think might be missing in your own life? Usually obsessing with something, anything, means that we are just trying to feel in a void of some kind, maybe some kind of fear of living real experiences with real available people! <br>  <br>  Take some time to look at yourself, and inside yourself, and it is indeed very important that you look for professional help, as you shouldn't play around with these things!! For your own good, and because you don't wanna be wasting any precious time of your life obsessing with people that you don't know, one the right person might be just around the corner, you should consult a professional on this!<br>  <br>  And just keep in mind that it's all about you yeah... your life has to first of all and foremost be all about you, and only then can you reach enough balance in order to look at someone else, without obsessing that is. <br>  <br>  Congratulations for acknowledging that it is an issue, and that it could escalate into a real problem if you don't act upon it!  Congratulations for taking the first step, which is to ask for help, now you just have to go and ask for the right kind of help! :)<br>  <br>  ...and remember there is nothing wrong with you, we all do that at some point in our lives... it's just that there's a limit to it, and if it's bothering you, it's because you feel like you have transpassed yours!!<br>  <br>  Keep on moving in the right direction, stay strong, and it will soon pass! Good luck! ;)|`|smKrIXYSaa	This is probably just a passing phase in your life. Once you have a new interest this ''obsession'' will be a distant memory.

ePkiOzPSaa	Yep.  Could be any number of things based on your body's physical limits, the type of radiation, and the strength and duration of exposure.  Could be some sort of abnormal growth (tumor?) or just severe tissue damage.|`|AA12358000	Jacqui,<br>  It would depend on the severity of the dose of radiation that a person has incurred. The illness induced by exposure to ionizing radiation may range in severity from nausea, vomiting, headache, and diarrhea to loss of hair and teeth, reduction in red and white blood cell counts, extensive hemorrhaging, sterility, and death.  The biological action of radiation is not fully understood, but it is believed that a disturbance in cellular activity results from the chemical changes caused by ionization. Some body tissues are more sensitive to radiation than others and are more easily affected; the cells in the blood-forming tissues (bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes) are extremely sensitive. Radiation sickness may occur from exposure to a single massive emanation such as a nuclear explosion (such as Hiroshima and Nagasaki), or it may occur after repeated large exposure or to even very small doses in a plant or laboratory, since radiation effects are cumulative. Should you consider that you, or the person about whom this question is asked, has been exposed to radiation, you would be advised to consult your doctor at your earliest opportunity.<br>  <br>  ALL ANSWERS SHOULD BE THOROUGHLY RESEARCHED, IN ANY FORUM AND ESPECIALLY IN THIS ONE. -  MANY ANSWERS ARE FLAWED.<br>  <br>  <br>  The information provided here should not be used during any medical emergency or for the diagnosis or treatment of any medical condition.

AA11522944	Yes and no.<br>  <br>  A lot of peoples first sexual experiences are 'same sex' experiences.<br>  <br>  This is thought to happen because in the normal order of childhood development children are curious about their bodies and the bodies of others BEFORE they are attracted to the opposite sex.<br>  <br>  Sometimes 'games' involving nakedness or even touching happen between children of the same sex.<br>  <br>  This contact between children or teens of the same sex is considered to be somewhat 'normal' and NOT an indicator of sexual orientation.<br>  <br>  In other words if you played with your buddies dick when you were 12 it DOESN'T mean you are gay... necessarily.<br>  <br>  Sometimes this curiosity and experimentation will extend into the teenage years when a young person might still be coming to grips with their sexual identity.|`|l7GjBVvhaa	Does not matter the age. <br>  <br>  Yes there are many females and males who experiment with the same sex. There is nothing wrong with it and it does not mean one is homesexual if doing so for the experience and the joy they get from it. You are only homosexual when you only ONLY enjoy being with the same sex as in relationships and sexually, with no interest in the opposite sex. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Be seeing you.....|`|zEy0uuAFaa	It's fairly common for young guys, who are just starting to explore the boundaries of their own sexual landscape.  Often boys like to have some of their first experiences with other boys, because they feel more secure interacting with other boys instead of the much more mysterious girls.  It's not universal, but it's fairly common.|`|h5WyXa9Uaa	Good question!<br>  <br>  I read somewhere that about 3/4 of dudes have masturbated with their friends.<br>  <br>  I'm straight, out of high-school, but have never experimented in person,  so I don't think age or orientation has to do with it.<br>  <br>  Probably would be fun to do. Like male-bonding or whatever.|`|VO9XEPeNaa	I dunno. I've heard that too. <br>  <br>  I never asked or seen any of these actions between men.|`|1oNi2v38aa	At a young age, children may experiment with their friends.|`|lpadt3bCaa	I think it would be more accurate to say "a significant percentage of guys have done something sexual with another guy...."  And, I would bet most of those guys would deny they had those experiences.  <br>  <br>  Is this just a random curiosity of yours?  Or, are you concerned about something that's happened or something you want to happen??|`|sRRs5urWaa	This Is true. If you do not try it when you are young then when you get older you will know whether you are gay or not, based on whether you liked it.|`|fJQrxgZ6aa	I have know guys both in their teens and some older that have experimented with same sex but doesn't mean your gay or will be gay.

So if you stop taking Proactol and keep eating the same fatty foods, you probably will start to regain your weight.<br>  <br>  What you should be doing is taking proactol with a healthy diet that way your low fat meals become practically Zero fat meals thus you get the weight loss boost you need to shed the lbs fast.|`|OMxNblImaa	Hiya i suggest you should read the leaflet it may indicate some advice :)

Best bet is to get to the gym, it is possible to lose that weight in 2 months, but then you will put it all back on as soon as you stop the diet. Ive done it myself so many times.<br>  Cut back on carbs, starchy carbs such as bread, pasta, rice ect will leave u bloated and loads right around the waist. No fruit (full of sugars), loads of water, green tea, get a weights prog and head to the gym!!! you will feel much better.<br>  I could suggest starving yourself but you would only end up messing up your metabolism which wilol lead to weight gain after or else lead to a disease like anorexia. so good luck, make the smart choice!!!!<br>  <br>  Bet your perfect the way you are though, size 6 doesnt always look good and the scrawny look is not nice|`|dJuEtGxraa	Here are a few tips;<br>  <br>  WHEN to eat for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Eat (at least) three times a day. <br>  Because when you eat only once a day, your metabolism gets slower than it already is! That's the main reason. Sounds funny, but to lose weight... you must eat (the right things, of course) <br>  ? Eat low-fat, high-fiber foods such as salads and vegetable pastas.<br>  ? Your last meal should be before 18:00. Try. <br>  OK, one apple after 18:00 <br>  ? Don't starve <br>  Starvation is not good for losing weight, nor your health. <br>  Starvation is the worse thing you can do in a weight loss diet. <br>  ? Try oatmeal instead of cornflakes for breakfast--eating oatmeal can help reduce cholesterol levels, and its high fiber content will keep you full longer.<br>  <br>  WHAT to drink for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Drink 6-8 glasses of water every day ! <br>  Can be tap, plain, mineral, sparkling. I just love mineral sparkling water! <br>  This improves your bowel, reduces the "hunger" sensation, and hydrates your skin. Your skin will look much better after the first weeks! <br>  Don't believe the slogan "water makes me fat". Beside being stupid... you might get into serious troubles with your kidneys. <br>  ? Drink ONLY natural juices, freshly squeezed! <br>  Don't drink Coca Cola, Pepsi, Spite etc. during the diet. Even lite or light versions. <br>  <br>  <br>  Exercise for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? If you want quicker results - exercise would be good. <br>  ? Don't just sit in front of the TV and eat peanuts... <br>  I guarantee THIS won't work for your weight loss... <br>  ? Start a regular exercise program and stick with it. Don't be afraid of those sweat suits and Lycra pants! <br>  ? Start swimming. Swimming is an excellent exercise to get involved with, since it increases blood flow and uses muscles we don't regularly use. Start a swimming program and try to do it 3 times a week. You will feel excellent and rejuvenated.<br>  ? Choose an exercise program that you enjoy, and don't shun the unconventional. For instance, did you know that regular vigorous dancing is exercise too?<br>  ? Also Cardiovascular exercises such as running, jogging, or aerobics will help you lose that unwanted belly fat. Weight training can also help you lose body fat because the more muscle mass you have, the more ability your system has to burn body fat.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  Hope this helps~

I think a C cup is a good size, because once you take away the breast tissue its gone for good-unless you get implants, of course, but you can always get another surgery if C is too big (but you will probably be happy with a C).|`|bmWKETgWaa	There are more issues here than the size you eventually want to be.

Try. <br>  OK, one apple after 18:00 <br>  ? Don't starve <br>  Starvation is not good for losing weight, nor your health. <br>  Starvation is the worse thing you can do in a weight loss diet. <br>  ? Try oatmeal instead of cornflakes for breakfast--eating oatmeal can help reduce cholesterol levels, and its high fiber content will keep you full longer.<br>  <br>  WHAT to drink for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Drink 6-8 glasses of water every day ! <br>  Can be tap, plain, mineral, sparkling. I just love mineral sparkling water! <br>  This improves your bowel, reduces the "hunger" sensation, and hydrates your skin. Your skin will look much better after the first weeks! <br>  Don't believe the slogan "water makes me fat". Beside being stupid... you might get into serious troubles with your kidneys. <br>  ? Drink ONLY natural juices, freshly squeezed! <br>  Don't drink Coca Cola, Pepsi, Spite etc. during the diet. Even lite or light versions. <br>  <br>  <br>  Exercise for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? If you want quicker results - exercise would be good. <br>  ? Don't just sit in front of the TV and eat peanuts... <br>  I guarantee THIS won't work for your weight loss... <br>  ? Start a regular exercise program and stick with it. Don't be afraid of those sweat suits and Lycra pants! <br>  ? Start swimming. Swimming is an excellent exercise to get involved with, since it increases blood flow and uses muscles we don't regularly use. Start a swimming program and try to do it 3 times a week. You will feel excellent and rejuvenated.<br>  ? Choose an exercise program that you enjoy, and don't shun the unconventional. For instance, did you know that regular vigorous dancing is exercise too?<br>  ? Also Cardiovascular exercises such as running, jogging, or aerobics will help you lose that unwanted belly fat. Weight training can also help you lose body fat because the more muscle mass you have, the more ability your system has to burn body fat.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|SAgCy83Oaa	Around 10-12 pounds, if you really push it.|`|l7GjBVvhaa	1 - 1.5 pounds is safe if you are trying to loose weight. <br>  <br>  Which means 4-6 pounds a month, is healhty.<br>  <br>  Anything more is unsafe.<br>  <br>  Try calculating how many calories you you intake a day and buring it all and more to lose weight. <br>  <br>  Do not starve yourself though.

(The mastoid bone is behind the ear.)<br>  I have had two of these surgeries.<br>  The ear is a tough place to cure an infection especially if it is deep in the inner ear.<br>  That was my problem.<br>  What they do sounds terrible but it is not. No pain ,no disfiguring. A slight scar behind the ear. <br>  In the hospital, under sedation the surgeon slices behind the ear where it meets the skull so a scar does not show. The ear is not removed but is moved (flapped) forward while still firmly attached to the skull. The surgeon then can go into the ear and actually scrape the infection away. Then they will replace the ear drum. Then they flap the ear back into place and sew it up in the deep crevice behind the ear. After the surgery, it never hurts but it is bandaged up for a month. to allow it to heal. <br>  I have had to have this done twice two years apart because all the infection was not removed the first time. It is not a dangerous operation.<br>  Everyone feels sorry for you..take advantage of the care..goof off. Haha.

0nyWiro9aa	They are concerned with the child's immune status as pediatric sepsis including kidney infections normally illicit an strong immune response to the point where such response is often included in determining whether infection is present or not with laboratory testing. Doctors are aware that some patients do not exhibit such elevated white cell counts and is a problem in children in particular. To complicate the picture some people show the opposite effect with bacterial infections with the white count going down instead of up. This can happen in severe infections. Keep in mind that antibiotics only inhibit the grow of bacteria and it's up to the white blood cells to actually kill them. The white cell count is thus important as a diagnostic tool but also as an immune indicator in fighting infections.<br>  <br>  Generally an infection is suspected with an elevated white count specifically a neutrophil count or a shift in immature white cells, toxic changes in the neutrophils such as hypergranulation, dohle bodies, vacuolization, elevated sedrate, elevated CRP,  or procalitonin testing. The reason such additional testing is sometimes undertaken is because in the very young, and or in the old, the classic elevated WBC count may not be present.<br>  <br>  So of concern is chronic infections and if it does not resolve then immune status needs to be assessed.

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|wxzeKh4Iaa	Look into the Fat X program.

AA12190953	Ohh my goodness!!! I had the same thing happen a few years ago only i was playing with my daughter and she kicked her foot across my eye. And it is the very worst pain i can imagine!! I have had 3 children and the pain from a scratch on the eye is worse than the child birth. I remember not being able to sleep due to the pain and my eye was watering continuously. So much so that my pillow was soaking wet. It didnt seem to matter what i did nothing made it any more bearable. A friend who has had this happen a few times said to get Bausch & Lomb's Sensitive eyes plus, saline solution. it comes in a 12 oz bottle and you can get it at any major drug store. This provides a small source of relief until you can get in to see an eye dr. And you really should got to the dr because a corneal abrasion can get infected and cause blindness. And a corneal abrasion also takes a VERY long time to heal. I found this out over time, it can take up to 2yrs if it ever heals properly. Because just like any other part of the body the scratch on your eye forms a scab, and being that its a moist area the scab tends to stay soft so it is very easily rubbed off. Also I learned to have a bottle of the saline solution right next to my bed so that i could put it in my eye before i opened them in the morning, because your eyes tend to get dry over nite so when you first wake up and open your eyes the scab will stick to the eyelid. Hopefully my trial and error will help speed your healing time along. <br>  When you go to the eye dr they will put drops in your eye to numb it and them another that will turn your eye very dark bright orange (this is what helps the dr see the scratch), so try not to have any plans after the dr appt for a couple hrs. The numbing drops are the best but they wont give you any because they to can cause blindness due to overuse.<br>  Also how u use the sensitive eyes plus..... tilt your head to the side that has the scratch, with your head over a sink or have a towel to catch the excess solution and just pour it into the eye try to open the eye with your fingers just slightly enough to allow the solution to saturate entire eye, its amazing the instant relief you get, its so cooling and it really does help for a while.|`|IMPvzBk1aa	Always get medical treatment anytime your eye is injured.  Injuries and infections may damage eye tissues and lead to blindness.  See a doctor for this asap.|`|4P7N6XULaa	I did this a few weeks ago with a tree branch, like the other person said it hurts like hell. My doctor friend suggested to me to get eye infection ointment put it in every 4 hours and take some pain killers but the pain was so bad that i was getting worried so i went to the eye hospital to get it checked out the next day. I would always get it checked out first its your eye sight after all. At the hospital they saw it was a superficial scratch on the eye ball and gave me the same anti bacterial infection ointment and some other drops to open to pupil up. take some pain killers and get yourself to the eye hospital. <br>  I know exactly what youre going through and its the worse pain in the world, like someone stabbing you in the eye with a knife.<br>  It will get better over the next 2-5 days get checked out. ouchie x x x

kprKXEOSaa	I don't really know any women who want to gain weight.  But that maternal instinct kicks in, the biological clock, whatever you want to call it.  It's embedded in our DNA, the desire to have children, and it overrides the desire to be thin and have a perfect body.  Ask Cindy Crawford or Heidi Klum.|`|a984cQjKaa	because they want kids more than they don't want to gain weight. either that, or they got knocked up on accident.
NPzDQmlQaa	I have been through it all and know what's it about.  The main thing is to stick in there.  You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off.  I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.      Nothing works,  besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.      First,  depending on how much weight you need to lose,  your diet is the first concern.  You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off,  even if you are exercising a lot.  Which brings us to the next thing.  Duh,  Exercising...    This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight.  Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising.  Do some cardio,  in the long run,  it's good for the heart.    However,  I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off,  in my diet.  It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies.  I've found a great addition to help any one out,  it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol.  Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work.  That is true,  but not in this case.  This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch.  It's an appetite suppressant,  along with being a fat binder.  I saved money on the pills at theweight lossplace.com along with getting some good info.  It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar.  For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full.  Now this doesn't mean you have to follow my foot steps but I've successfully lost roughly 70 pounds and keeping it off til this day.      Well good luck and remember what I said,  Dedicate.

A certain level of stress is unavoidable, in modern society, so it is a good idea to develop effective coping methods. Light to moderate daily exercise helps fight stress. For some people, it helps to visualise a quiet, relaxing scene (imagine, as vividly as you can, that you are on a tropical beach, reclining comfortably; you luxuriate, as the the sun warms you, and a gentle breeze caresses your skin lightly, inhaling the tangy, sea scented, salt laden spray from the sparkling, translucent, aqua waves, crashing on the white, coral beach sand, and feeling the hot sand slip through your fingers in one hand, sipping your favorite drink with the other; all the while, the seagulls call, swoop and cavort playfully overhead in a cloudless, azure sky: you feel just like one of them, free to soar and cartwheel, or just glide in the moist, heavy air, and that this moment will last forever ... ). <br>  <br>  Options: Try: <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/meditat..." rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/meditat...</a>  & <a href="http://www.healthjourneys.com/free_audio.asp?f=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthjourneys.com/free_audio...</a> & <a href="http://www.meditainment.com/free-meditation-content/" rel="nofollow">http://www.meditainment.com/free-meditat...</a> & <a href="http://www.freehypnosistreatment.com/hypnosistreatment.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.freehypnosistreatment.com/hyp...</a>  Relaxation Hypnosis  Take 4 Omega 3 fish oil supplements, daily: (certified free of mercury) it is best if consumed with an antioxidant, such as an orange, or grapefruit, or their FRESHLY SQUEEZED juice. If vitamin E is added, it should be certified as being 100% from natural sources, or it may be synthetic: avoid it. The supplement DHEA is thought to counter the stress hormone, Cortisol. Ginseng & Lady's Slipper are recommended herbal remedies: see section 55, at ezy build, below. Practise daily, one of the relaxation techniques in sections 11, 2, 2c, or 2i; whichever works best for you, but the mindfulness breathing for 15 - 20 mns is ideal, although the progressive muscle relaxation can be learned quickly, and takes only several minutes, if pressed for time.

Employ the EFT version for use in public, for which you can reasonably claim that you have a headache, as you massage/tap your temples, but it may be advisable to restrict yourself to subvocalising (saying it to yourself, in your mind, not aloud). Section 53, and pages 2, 2.q and 2.o refer. "Even though I sometimes suffer from stress, I deeply and completely accept myself". A variant of EMDR: Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing therapy, which has been used successfully for those people suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, insomnia, and anxiety, is shown in section 42, on page i, at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> I have found that the 2 - 3 minutes spent using the EMDR markedly reduces distractions to the relaxation process, and is well worthwhile. You can also multitask, using the gazing technique, as you walk/jog or exercise, by focusing on a distant object, or just focus awareness on how each step feels, noting any thoughts which flash across your mind, without pursuing any particular train of thought, just gently redirect your focus to the task at hand.|`|ToILKl6waa	It's nice of you to want to lend a helping hand to your husband in a time of need. You must do everything in your power to support him and not let negative thinking/stress get the worst of him. Let him know that struggles are only temporary and things are seen according to his own mindset - not as they are. Tell him you love and appreciate him and comfort him if he wants to talk. Don't offer advice to move on. Just give encouraging words and be an ear for him to talk to. I would also urge him to exersize to release some anxiety or go for a passion when he has the time instead of playing video games lazily. Help him set up motivation for himself and reward him with praise once he has done so.|`|WT9cjXtIaa	I agree 100% with Maggie. Make him go for a walk with you. You have to do it with him.

XvGQq1gBaa	A 20 dollar tub lasted me a month and I dropped 10 pounds! That's 2.5 pounds a week - not bad. I did no real exercise, yet did eat sensibly. I took it about 2-3 hours after dinner when I would often get the munchies for chips and pop. The oil gave me a sense of being full and I no longer craved the junk foods at night. This time round I'm going to incorporate swimming 1/2 hour 3 days a week, with a 1/2 hour of weights 2 days a week to see what happens. I beleive this stuff is a no brainer for weight-loss, and is definately proven effective for me. People are noticing my weightloss and asking me what my secret is. When they find out, they are immediately interested and want to give it a try. I recommend it to anyone who has 'hit the wall' with their weightloss progress, or to those who want to start out on the right path with guaranteed results. I even went off it for 2 monthes and the bodyfat didnt come back. I take @ 4tbsps every evening. Good luck with it if you give it a shot!|`|QsQj8jO7aa	It shouldn't be a diet but a replacement for all the other oils and fats in your diet. Stop eating processed foods and replace ALL other oils and fats with the coconut oil. No more, canola, vegetable, safflower etc...Cook w/coco oil, take it in capsules. Since it is a natural product, a saturated fat you can't hurt yourself by "over doing" it. If you're serious about doing this you have to realize that saturated fat isn't harmful.

8iHbDmHmaa	Don't have it in your house.  Or don't let yourself get so hungry that your healthy eating goes out the window and you grab whatever's closest.<br>  <br>  Eat every 2-3 hours (not huge meals), and make sure you have some protein with every meal.  Protein will keep your sugar levels more even.  It's when your sugar levels drop that you get ravenous and reach for the sugary stuff.  Protein doesn't have to be just meat, you can have eggs, cheese, yogurt, cottage cheese.|`|iegRymuraa	Usually I fill up on filling foods when I'm hungry, like grapes, carrots, nuts, or celery. Fill up with a glass of water. <br>  <br>  It's usually tempting if you have bad food right in your face, too. When shopping for foods resist the bad food, or get replacements like:<br>  - the Quaker Quakes [instead of chips]<br>  - the 100 calorie snacks [instead of the regular snacks]<br>  - or things like the Smart Ones desserts. <br>  <br>  Look for labels that say "Low-fat" or "Light". Having those kinds of food in the house is a BIG helper when trying to avoid the bad stuff. And you don't feel so guilty if you snack on light things like the above.<br>  <br>  TIP: If you HAVE to have bad things in the house, keep SMALL AMOUNTS of it, like mini candy bars. That way you won't be so tempted.|`|216ef6efd780221df4689eda5ca350e9aa	If you can't control yourself around 'bad' food, then don't keep it in the house. Have a fruit bowl on the kitchen table instead of a packet of biscuits. Grapes and bananas make great snacks, or even sultanas, dried fruit or nuts. Someone mentioned carrots - keeping carrot sticks in the fridge is good, or celery. You might not be nuts about the idea now, but once you do it for a while, you may just start to enjoy it.|`|IM7nzdjbaa	Drink water.  People sometimes eat when they feel hungry, but alot of times it's just thirst.|`|enNFDXqSaa	If you are hungry, eat. Try starting with something like almonds, or a diet soda which can curb hunger, and diet soda often curbs sweet cravings.  If you don't have it in your house, you can't eat it. Try modifying some of your "bad" foods to make them healthier. Keep in mind though that if you are craving something and then you eat a salad, odds are you will still have the craving afterward and may end up eating both. Another idea is have some of the "bad" food, but have it in moderation, with a salad first so that you will eat less of the fatty food.|`|3rvsG372aa	Two bits of advice.<br>  <br>  First off avoid bad food by not having it around, and instead have something healthy (such as fruit or veggies).  Sometimes you're craving a bit of sugar in the middle of the day.<br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  You could not avoid bad food, but keep it to small amounts.  If you're craving chocolate, then have a hershey kiss instead of a whole chocolate bar.  Then eat healthy food and drink water (to help you feel full)|`|E6QRz0QBaa	For some people it's hard to avoid "bad" food and for others it's easy.

mqXyDTwwaa	Being overweight isn't an advantage in the cold. Nerves that sense cold are on the skin. The layer of fat an overweight person has keeps the heat from the body from reaching those nerves, so a fat person feels colder in cold weather. The only advantage I know is an overweight person can survive starvation longer than a skinny person.

It is normal. Do it when lying down in bed or on a sofa - then you wont fall. Enjoy!!!|`|jmlAmr3gaa	It's normal enough to feel that a little, yes.  Heat exhaustion and moisture-laden air in the shower and could be making it worse.    People have been known to faint in showers from the heat alone.  I guess it's like they say about cooking crabs or whatever: if you put them in boiling water, they'll try to jump out.  But if you put them in cold water, and gradually increase the temperature until it's boiling, they don't know they're too warm.    Between that and the exertion, it's not surprising.  My advice is check the temp, sit/lie down (even just towards the end if you prefer not to always).    You might (or might not) be a little unfit too, so try other forms of exercise and see how you feel after.    If you want to handle the temperature thing without things getting too clinical or losing their spark, you could make it fun by balancing the heat with an ice-cold drink or something.  How you can use that ice-cold drink during a hot shower, I'll leave up to your imagination.    It is a bit dangerous to risk fainting in a shower, as you could fall through the glass and end up very hurt, so this is worth resolving, somehow.    Have fun ;)|`|RhPNV1ohaa	Like Ice cream - it is possible and probable you are getting too much of a good thing.|`|ETFZaJkmaa	hypertension...

MeGwJfSLaa	No you need to eat hun. No matter what. But not to much. You should eat three meals in a day and drink lots of water. it makes me full. Have snacks in between to like fruits or veggies. When your stomach rumbles dont ignore it! it wants food lol.|`|WN6tWLdYaa	just eat a small portion size of food. maybe just a handful of nuts is all you need. also drink lots of water. its helps a lot.|`|BCgp7GTpaa	Yeah its okay to not eat as long as you eat your regular three meals a day, but if you really cant stand it try chewing gum or having a serving of fruits of vegies.
jSHTTq3kaa	I don't think that gaining fourteen pounds in 91 days is bad.  You shouldn't, either, unless you wanted to lose weight.  Its not that big of a deal, too.  The situation is 14 pounds in 91 days.  That's an up side.  For this situation to be bad, the day count would be much shorter.  If you think that you are developing a gut, try bringing your shoulders back a bit more.  Guts normally form when you hunch your back most of the time.  That's why you should bring your shoulders back, don't be like the Hunchback of Notre Dame.  If this doesn't work for you, try to eat healthy food.  Don't under eat in meals, because then you tend to over eat the next.  That's all the help I can give you-if none of this works, try asking your Doctor.  Hope this helps you and all the other people who want to loose weight.|`|d8mDPfjgaa	Well muscle weighs more than fat so if your gaining muscle, your going to gain weight.  and make sure your eating right also.  It helps a lot when you are trying to get in shape.  And also make sure your well hydrated.|`|5kYIteIHaa	noooppeee not bad.|`|oKRbe6XYaa	No that's normal, but you just need to stay active.  I gained 10 pounds in a week, which is even worse....

(BMI) it will have to measure your arms waist leg ect...and if you have a fat pincher that is best. You cant measure weight gain or loss by a scale. You need to know if it was fat or muscle by measuring your fat pinch against your muscle. see google. there are websites that will assist you how to measure.|`|5GKOtJwjaa	i think that u are growing, just continue to work out, it will be fine|`|CrjU3eWYaa	try being less of a girl?|`|WKkyriIZaa	well it depends, are you still at a healthy weight? or not?          if you can still see your toes, then you're fine ;)|`|UrUpWmA7aa	Muscle is more dense than fat.

Theres no way you gained fat with your work out regiment, unless youre eating like crazy one or two times a day.    14 pounds of muscle in 3 months seems really good.    Any flab could be caused by loosening fat getting detatched from the muscle as the muscle becomes more defined, that youre body is ready to lose.|`|5rgRqdZLaa	Depends on various factors:    Age?    Taking supplements?    Eating healthy?|`|JmMrgtGqaa	if your working out its prolly muscle.|`|4CsGde1qaa	Nope, just average. You can easily shed them away in no more than a month if you work hard.|`|iJmafJWBaa	woah fatty,  haha jk  your muscular hun.  football playas are sexy|`|hW6JWFLTaa	FIRRRRST ask yourself this question...    is there any possibility you could be pregnant?|`|bkIRC8Q3aa	you have gaine fat mmuscle takes more time to gained. Fat is faster to gain. 14 pounds in 91 days its gotta be fat or either that u are growing.|`|TAgPuPbkaa	well im the best football player and best wrestler in my team and im in eight grade... looking fowrard to high school lol and no its not bad because ive weighed 155 during football and ive gained about 10 pounds after basket ball and now im in wrestling season... people say i look like im in 130 pounds because they dont think im fat... in fact i have no fat just muscle...its probebly the same reason... ur getting into shape and your getting muscles and burning up fat u might still think ur fat because thats what i thought but ur actually burning up fat... lol congradulations ur getting stronger lol its not bad
ROAS5EGLaa	1-8 weeks. Your shoulders look way better and your bicep is a tiny bit bigger. Keep up the work and you'll get huge!|`|yo0qnedIaa	A month or so ?  Looks good.  Just don't get TOO muscly, where your veins are practically popping out of your skin, cause thats gross. Lol.    |`|NBM8vqkHaa	1 week|`|Vu4SFGsqaa	I would say maybe a month or 2. I don't know, just giving you my guess :P.|`|59xQlCjGaa	About a week and a half
C88VCkvnaa	I don't know much about weight loss, but you seem to have the right idea. :) I think you are doing great because you are giving your body enough calories but not TOO much. Either extreme would be detrimental. I think it's okay you are giving yourself a little of what you want; that way, you don't have strong cravings and ruin your whole plan!  Keep some exercise going as well to aid the process I think.  Don't be embarrassed by how much you weigh! It's not that bad. You're doing great     Good luck, I wish you the best!! Keep up the good work!!      Edit: No problem. =D  p.s. I have never heard of a samosa, it sounds interesting!    Edit  2: Sorry for editing this all the time. I would also suggest adding fruit into your diet. It's natural sugar, and yummy =] Good source of nutrients!!|`|3tnistZQaa	Lay off the chips, tortillas and cheese. Also, I know how we Pakis and Indians cook our food so avoid the oily stuff and switch over to Peanut oil if possible.|`|UZKg2odzaa	just try to cut out he fried/ fatty stuff out of your diet and you should be fine
YIs51Vp8aa	Turbo Jam is my favorite of all the Beachbody Workouts! The Cardio is awesome and the focus on the core and abs is great. I use a heart rate monitor and doing the Punch Kick and Jam workout I burn about 850 - 900 calories in the 50 min. I burn about 550 - 650 or so doing the sculpt workout.  I was able to lose a consistent 2 - 3 pounds per week. I lost about 5 - 7 pounds for the 1st 2 weeks!    I have the entire series and use one of them almost everyday! I moved on to a different program (ChaLEAN Extreme) since Turbo Jam but love the cardio from Turbo Jam!    The key is to keep good form and your intensity up! I had the great opportunity to workout with Chalene live on 3 occasions and that really helped me take it up a bit. Crank up the music and really go for it. I also use the weighted hand gloves for a little extra ;)    You will LOVE Turbo Jam!
9lCulhIsaa	You should make an eating plan for yourself. Eat anything that you want to but eat it in small portions. My friend did this. She ate six small meals a day and stuck to it. She ended up losing 25 pounds. And do not feel intimidated to speak with your doctor. They can really help you. Do not go on any crazy diets or try to starve yourself ever. I did that a few times and it really does not work. Or you could do what I do, The Special K diet. It sort of limits your meals but it is actually working for me. Do not forget that exercise is important as well.     Good Luck!!!! =]
ROAS5EGLaa	No. If you are eating less and working out more, you should be burning fat,muscle, and losing liquid. If you are getting wider you might be eating to low calories and your metabolism is at a bad point in which fat loss will slow down. Measure yourself to make sure your actually wider and not just seeing things. Also if you are doing weights will be most likely get a little bigger so weigh yourself and make sure the number is going down, unless you are trying to get buff.|`|x355hpUZaa	That definately doesnt seem too normal.  Maybe your gaining weight though.  If you work out you could end up gaining some weight from muscle.|`|dlgQCSocaa	Have you been very strict on cutting calories?  If you cut too much, or skip meals your body can go into "starvation" mode, and start saving more fat, and using muscle for energy instead.  So if thats the case, your body could be showing your fat stores and loss of muscle.  Or like another said, you could simply be gaining muscle mass and bulking up a bit.  If you do weight training, this is a strong possibly too - as long as its a toned wide look and not flabby.|`|ZW0La7M7aa	Gaining muscle would be my guess.
5Qo6OWNzaa	Of course you will lose weight. Of course it is not healthy. Hope this helped.|`|3yNh5jO8aa	you are not eating enough to even get your metabolism moving! you need to add more protein. Eat a chicken breast or a small steak at night. you also need veggies.|`|HjMbOgvqaa	You are not eating enough to keep your body going and it will not lose because it is starving ,the yogurt and protein bar are probably full of sugar and salt.If you want to lose fast eat leafy greens, fruit ,low fat dairy and chicken and fish .Stay away from fast food and grocery store premade food loaded with fats and salts and white flour,eat 5 to 6 times a day to keep your blood sugar and metabolism high and burning
gERaZGZeaa	Back:  Deadlift, bent over barbell rows, dumbbell rows, and lat pulldowns.  I find 4 sets of 6 work best for me.  Legs: Barbell squats, front squats, leg press, leg extensions.    With leg extensions, use light weight and focus on the contraction - it's hard on the knees if you go to heavy.
4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	You should teach yourself some relaxing techniques (it's sort of like self-hypnosis).  When you feel things start to escalate, you trigger the relaxing technique and put yourself into that calmer place.  It is a learned conditioning so maybe you need to talk to a yoga person.  Or just do it yourself if you have enough motivation.   Think what types of things make you feel good--baby animals, lying on a tropical beach with no pressures, whatever--and practice thinking about your favorite things, see how they make you feel better, see how your blood pressure seems to calm down.  You should practice this just all the time before you're in a situation where you start losing it.  Then when the real thing comes along, you know you switch your mind to thinking about lying on the floor with a bunch of sweet baby puppies scrambling to play with you, take a big breath of that thought and feel better and calmer.
7waA9vGeaa	You are NOT overweight; if anything, you're probably underweight. I think you need to talk to a close adult about the self-esteem issues you seem to be having.|`|wv5PiHxcaa	Babe, 107 pounds is far from fat.  You're very slim and soooooooo many girls would kill to be that size.|`|qAjcfjmeaa	I hope you realize that at 5'4 you should on average weigh at 128lbs. Mirrors can be deceiving, so listen to what people say about you in person. You are technically 21lbs underweight so its safe to say you are not fat. If you still don't like your body maybe you can tone it a bit.|`|rZmme9amaa	it depends on how your body is distributed, but no when you are 5 feet 4 inches you can be 145 pounds before being "overweight". If you need any help losing weight or anything email me.|`|GO63RB5paa	i feel the same way  im 14 years old  5 feet exactly   and 107 pounds  everyone tells me that im skinny  so i would say your not overweight  usually once you hit 5 feet every inch over that  you add about 5 pounds and that would be average weight  so 5'1 =105  5'2=110  5'3=115  5'4=120  .. you get it.|`|MeGwJfSLaa	You have got to be joking. I would kill to be that weight! Dont even thinkk you are close to fat because you are not. I hate when girls say they are fat when they are actually slim! Be happy for who you are.
5feIH8nGaa	I wouldn't say it's a disorder, but it isn't healthy.  You should never ever ever skip breakfast.  Eating breakfast in the morning starts up your metabolism. If you aren't hungry at all, just eat something little like a slice of toast.  Fiber One bars are also really good for you to eat in the morning.  Also you should really drink something when you wake up, water is always good, because your body is dehydrated. <br>  Skipping meals are never really a good thing.  If you aren't hungry, you should eat something little.  have some salad, make a frozen dinner like Smart Ones or lean cuisines.  There isn't much food in them and you'll still get the nutrients you need.  Then eat dinner like you usually do.  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|3z3P6j49aa	No, its not an eating disorder at all.<br>  I don't eat anything for breakfeast OR lunch, and maybe a sandwitch for dinner.<br>  <br>  Its just your diet.. a disorder is throwing up after you eat, or eating tooo much.|`|AA11828439	Nope, but it sure isn't a healthy way to eat.|`|P8xN2IzIaa	To me, that is not a lot of food.  My mom can't eat breakfast tho, in the morning, she is still full from dinner.  Me, on the other hand, if I don't eat almost immediately after waking up, I feel horrible for the rest of my day, but I have low blood sugar.  I guess everyone is different.  you should try eating more healthy though more healthy things for lunch.  Dinner does count, actually.  If dinner didn't count, dinner wouldn't be considered a meal.  you should try having more little snacks throughout the day.  Like almonds, pistachios, strawberries, small salad, fruit salad, etc...|`|oaJcgz3uaa	It doesn't sound like an eating disorder to me.  Sometimes people don't have huge appetites.  Usually, eating disorders are attached to a distorted sense of self.  For example, some people become anorexic (as in they eat maybe a cracker or a salad a day) when they think they weigh too much.  Even when they're underweight, these people will tend to think they weigh too much.  This is, of course, very dangerous because our bodies need food to function.  <br>  <br>  Just as long as you maintain a steady, well-balanced diet, you have nothing to worry about.|`|RivwZRNsaa	NO its ok like some people just dont stuff their faces its just ur appetite|`|TJ2EfH7oaa	I think, according to what you said, all is ok....<br>  but a little more info is needed:<br>  how old are you?<br>  how much do you weigh?<br>  <br>  Not trying to be nosy, but if you want a thorough answer, this info. is needed.<br>  *Edit*<br>  Ok, now you add the bit "I hate my body".  Believe it or not , that attitude has a big impact on your eating habbits.  When you asked about potentially getting help, do you mean it?  Would you get help if advised to, or are you just asking for the heck of it?  Now that you've added the "I hate my body" statement, I really think you ought to talk to somebody (i.e. a professional...not just Yahoo Answers) about your eating and self-image.  Also, I am not saying this to be an a$$.  I care about your well being.|`|GiYVrmI3aa	An eating disorder is a psychological as well as physical disease. unless you are doing it because you are uncomfortable about your body then it isn't an eating disorder.
lLAjT8mjaa	No, but you do need to get some medicine for it. It won't clear up on it's own.|`|3sriJtSkaa	short answer: no<br>  <br>  longer answer: not unless both your clothes were completely soaked and they were very thin or porous. <br>  however, I supose that if the discharge of the infected person were spread to the outside of their clothes for some reason and you rubbed up against it it would be possible. ... so I would say it's HIGHLY unlikely but I suppose there are certain situation in which it would be possible.|`|4d20446491a7a798682c4161206db004aa	you need to go to the dr....geeze!|`|10456fcb36c09d510c3f73faba95f075aa	Maybe if it were only a pair of knickers separating the two of you.|`|i9BgSAMjaa	no dont worry about it
a7Osxk2iaa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depo_shot|`|KL1Y5FeHaa	Many women experience Irregular, Heavy or NO bleeding as a side effect of the Depo Shot. After a year of use, many women stop having a period. Your body is most likely getting used to it all. See your doctor to discuss your side effects.|`|hzCK4ORbaa	It is normal for the most part to have irregular periods after depo. My daughter didn't have 1 for the 4 years so took the shot, but them it took 2 years to get back regular after she stopped...I don't see where the Ibuprofen is going to stop the bleeding, it is an anti-inflammatory, used to reduce pain and/or inflammation. Strange prescription to me unless you are experiencing pain or bloating. But, who knows, maybe is will help.
cb2NxPERaa	Swimming, Running, and most sports that increase your heart rate.|`|lcj1AKt1aa	Running or race-walking.
Zbn8A7Geaa	No, unfortunately not.  But because you get them when you are much older (sometimes in 30's or 40's even), when you supposedly have reached an age of wisdom, they're called wisdom teeth.|`|1rNVgEDIaa	Third molar teeth do appear last and are permanent. So is wisdom!<br>  Not at all. Some toothless souls old people are wiser too!!|`|Ctni8I2zaa	they are called wisdom teeth, because the older you get the wiser you get supposebly, and you get wisdom teeth as your last set of teeth after your adult teeth.
PrS7So5Yaa	I'm with ya. I love running!    If running is what you really, really want to do, you'll find a way. Either get over your fear of going to the gym, or wait a little while until you can go outside. How about going to the gym with somebody you know who will make you feel more comfortable?    Lastly, you could work for a treadmill. Offer to pay for half the cost and save up for it. That will show your mom that you're serious enough about it to put your own time and money into getting it.
utaMlXnQaa	Here is the criteria for anorexia nervosa:    "To be diagnosed as having anorexia nervosa, according to the DSM-IV-TR, a person must display:    1. Refusal to maintain body weight at or above a minimally normal weight for age and height (e.g., weight loss leading to maintenance of body weight less than 85% of that expected; or failure to make expected weight gain during period of growth, leading to body weight less than 85% of that expected).  2. Intense fear of gaining weight or becoming obese  3. Disturbance in the way in which one's body weight or shape is experienced, undue influence of body weight or shape on self-evaluation, or denial of the seriousness of the current low body weight.  4. The absence of at least three consecutive menstrual cycles (amenorrhea) in women who have had their first menstrual period but have not yet gone through menopause (postmenarcheal, premenopausal females)."    Basically if you are a healthy eater/exerciser, you eat well and exercise well to be good to your body and healthy. If you have an eating disorder, you do it to lose weight, and develop an abnormal obsession with weight, and a huge fear of gaining weight.  Hope this helps!|`|EnFjPl6Naa	1. Check height vs weight ratio.  2. Caloric intake vs activities   3. Health- illnesses or weakness  4. Look at dental wellness- gums and teeth  5. Hair is also a good determining factor regarding eating disorder.     If the hair is brittle or even falling out shows problems with health.  Altogether energy level can be likened to putting gas in a car. Not enough gas- your "machine" (aka body) will not function. properly. With enough abuse, systems will start shutting down. Frequent headaches, hair loss, tooth decay and nausea can be signs of eating disorder. If there is a question of a disorder, a physician should be consulted. A counselor is also a good source to determine a problem.
a7Osxk2iaa	Its realy possible. Depends. If you are realy underweight it may disappear.|`|a984cQjKaa	it might, if your body fat has dropped below a certain level.|`|nMwbTKlpaa	it can, however, if it will..it all depends on your body. you'll just have to wait and see.|`|lcc4Z6fXaa	I don't think so
c4kOwX0eaa	You hear about it all the time so it must work for some people at least! This site reviews different brands of Acai  http://acaiberryreviews.webexpresslane.c...    .|`|S730dpLfaa	WARNING! Read this blog before trying Acai Berry!  http://acaiberryscams.wordpress.com/2008...  Thanks to this blog, it helped me a lot to choose the best.  Hope this helps :-)|`|NPzDQmlQaa	One thing that brought my dieting and losing weight out of the plateau I was in so long was the Acai Berry.  I was stuck at my weight loss goals and this brought me through it and made me lose a lot of weight.  So in my opinion it helped me lose weight tremendously.  I know a lot of that dieting stuff is expensive but I found a free trial of Acai Berry(I think it only cost me like 7-8 bucks at the time for shipping.)  The site was http://starturl.com/efblc -  All I did was try it out for a month and I was sold,  I saw the results I wanted to and like I said I was in that plateau with my weight loss.  This kicked it up a bunch.    Good luck and I hope this helps.|`|dX3Zlp2Jaa	Actually, you don't have to diet per se if you want to lose weight, the sole diet that clearly delivered for me is wu-yi tea, it can be viewed in the resource box below, they have a handful of free trials in stock, it has been highlighted in Reader's Digest and USA Today. I lost twenty five pounds, it clearly does work!|`|iH6V4u7Maa	Theres really a lot out there. Its difficult to pick so what I end up doing is starting with the less expensive and trying out several trials and seeing the results.This is a good website at http://www.pure-acai-berry.saverightnow.... visit and see if it interests you, I did.
eu6UQElYaa	I used to get that all the time.  In one sentence they'd be all "Oh God I'm so fat I wish I could just lose some weight. Blah blah blah."  Then in the very next sentence they'd say "You're too skinny, you need to eat!"     I just figured they were jealous.  They couldn't lose their weight so they assumed that because I was naturally skinny, I must be anorexic because if they couldn't be that skinny then it must not happen naturally and I must be sick or something.   I think it just made them feel better about themselves and about their own weight. I just stopped listening to them.  Learned to be happy with my own weight and continued to accept people at whatever weight they happened to be.|`|piI1aWOdaa	coz girls are very weird..how about everyone support everyone else for a change..starting with you and everyone who reads this question|`|VuhhcINOaa	they're probably jealous and mad that they don't look like you so they put you down to feel better. it sucks.|`|8hGfivoDaa	Insecurity.|`|JLBuXqStaa	ok i think thats stupid when girls act like that. naturally skinny girls are soooo lucky.
4bf562ccbf266e504b30ac04a5e0a34aaa	I do believe that to be true.  Only it would be Extra Virgin Olive Oil.  I use it everyday a little on my bread each day.  It does wonders, for the body.|`|MzWM9rBRaa	No that's not true.  Olive oil has fat in it (even though it's good fat) but if you eat it with bread it leads to a bad combination (cabohydrates + fat).  If you don't burn that energy up then it will turn into fat.    Now if you replaced veggy oil with olive oil, and if you replaced fast food with bread and olive oil, then that is a much healthier overall diet and you could lose weight.|`|6rrP6p8vaa	Well i've heard that when you eat certain foods(like olive oil) something in them makes you burn stomach fat. But make sure you don't eat too much of them. (i think some of the others were dark chocolate and almonds maybe??????)
wd893RR8aa	Sorry man... doing squats and lunges will only make your butt bigger. It'll build muscle pretty fast back there.. Only thing I would suggest is going into space where there is no gravity and just let your muscles atrophy.
mC4mnvGFaa	since its too late to do anything, stretching exercise will loosen stiff muscles, then after the tryouts, have a hot bath.|`|9W30kANZaa	If you are sore for exercise  I recommend you before you go to play warm up and try to run or something like that, in that form your muscles wil "warm" and you be able to play.  Take some pills whit paracetamol or naproxeno sodico (if you can get them)  and buy a cold cream for muscle pains.|`|edbeaf74946e31ae50c17ddd80060083aa	You really have to release the lactic acid from the muscles which I'm afraid will take movement.  The thing I would do is suffer through a short run before the game or a couple of sets of body weight squats.  It's gonna hurt a bit at first but it will help.|`|AA10551261	Take a Epsom salt bath.

JVe8bujHaa	lol thats a good workout for upper body muscle, but the hard part about workout routines are if ur lazy or not. most people do something like that straight for a week, than slack down a bit, and end up not bothering to do it at all in just 3 weeks. so make sure u stick with it and not grow lazy and make any excuses, if u do that ur fine with that workout plan
5kXxr6r0aa	impossible to tell, because it all depends on the muscles previous experience before that, and how possible it is to still get the "shock" effect to muscles as soon as they enter a brand new workout.    6 months got me up like 50 pounds on bench off of bodybuilding workouts when i was started, but now that i've been doing it for a while, progress comes slower as my muscles can no longer be shocked with as many new workouts and so now i'm lucky if i can increase 20 pounds within 6 months without switching to a powerlifter's workout.
2DwhcjmBaa	no pain at all. They dry the tooth put the seal in let it set for a few secs and then put a light on it. then your done good luck|`|onySROuhaa	It won't hurt.

zgfIOZ6raa	in addition to actually working out, you should revise your diet. because if you work off more calories, but you're still putting the same amount into your body, you're just going to end up at square one, but with more muscle, which will actually make you heavier cuz muscle weighs more than fat. in fact, if you do gain weight during your training regimen, its most likely due to the increase in muscle mass so dont sweat it... actually, do sweat. hope i helped.|`|ayLYuIvOaa	run up down stairs|`|8SRjELNBaa	Jump rope in your garage.

ZsCqfPaZaa	All sorts of things could cause skin redness/inflammation.  There's really no point in speculating as to the cause.    As for getting rid of it, try pressing a damp cloth wrapped around ice onto the site for a few minutes.  That usually closes up the capillaries in the area and gets rid of the redness.

It sometimes happens that a woman does not bleed the first time.  it could be because that delicate little tissue was already broken from normal activity sometime during the previous years.  It could be because the hymenal membrane was small to begin with. <br>  <br>  Just be glad you're living in modern times when people understand these things, and not in some backward age or Third World country where lots of blood had to be shown to prove previous virginity.|`|1vaqtRI2aa	Once that penis goes inside the vagina just once, you're no longer a virgin. Not everyone bleeds, and the hymen does not "break", it stretches. Every vagina and hymen is different, so some girls will bleed and some won't. For me I didn't bleed the first time I had sex even though it hurt more than anything in the world. <br>  <br>  Of course, it depends on the person. Some people will say you are, some will say you aren't. If you want to call yourself a virgin, go for it.

Enjoy being a teenager, life's too short to stress about the small stuff.|`|CF4K2dVAaa	It sounds like you are pretty active and fit, which could mean that you have a lot of muscle, which weighs more than fat. It could be that you weigh more than that girl because you have more muscle, which means you are skinnier, and she is just full of fat, which doesn't weigh as much. But your BMI (body mass index) is 23.83, which means you are at a pretty healthy weight.

I thought this was an important topic to share with you because the reality is that most people simply don't realize how dangerous their excess abdominal fat really is to their health. Also, by removing excess belly fat, you can undercover your hidden six pack. <br>  <br>  The Hidden Dangers of Your Excess Abdominal Fat - It's More Serious Than a Vanity Issue!<br>  <br>  by Mike Geary, Certified Nutrition Specialist, Certified Personal Trainer<br>  <br>  Did you know that the vast majority of people in this day and age have excess abdominal fat? The first thing that most people think of is that their extra abdominal fat is simply ugly, is covering up their abs from being visible, and makes them self conscious about showing off their body.<br>  <br>  However, what most people don't realize is that excess abdominal fat in particular, is not only ugly, but is also a dangerous risk factor to your health. Scientific research has clearly demonstrated that although it is unhealthy in general to have excess body fat throughout your body, it is also particularly dangerous to have excess abdominal fat.<br>  <br>  There are two types of fat that you have in your abdominal area. The first type that covers up your abs from being visible is called subcutaneous fat and lies directly beneath the skin and on top of the abdominal muscles.<br>  <br>  The second type of fat that you have in your abdominal area is called visceral fat, and that lies deeper in the abdomen beneath your muscle and surrounding your organs. Visceral fat also plays a role in giving certain men that "beer belly" appearance where their abdomen protrudes excessively but at the same time, also feels sort of hard if you push on it.<br>  <br>  Both subcutaneous fat and visceral fat in the abdominal area are serious health risk factors, but science has shown that having excessive visceral fat is even more dangerous than subcutaneous fat. Both of them greatly increase the risk your risk of developing heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, stroke, sleep apnea, various forms of cancer, and other degenerative diseases.<br>  <br>  Part of the reason visceral fat is particularly dangerous is that it apparently releases more inflammatory molecules into your body on a consistent basis.<br>  <br>  If you care about the quality of your life and your loved ones, reducing your abdominal fat should be one of your TOP priorities! There's just no way around it. Besides, a side-effect of finally getting rid of all of that excessive ugly abdominal fat is that your stomach will flatten out, and if you lose enough stomach fat, you will be able to visibly see those sexy six pack abs that everyone wants.<br>  <br>  So what gets rid of extra abdominal fat? Is there actually a REAL solution beyond all of the gimmicks and hype that you see in ads and on commercials for "miracle" fat loss products?<br>  <br>  The first thing you must understand is that there is absolutely NO quick fix solution. There are no pills or supplements of any sort that will help you lose your abdominal fat faster. Also, none of the gimmicky ab rockers, rollers, or ab belts will help get rid of abdominal fat either. You can't spot reduce your stomach fat by using any of these worthless contraptions. It simply doesn't work that way.<br>  <br>  The ONLY solution to consistently lose your abdominal fat and keep it off for good is to combine a sound nutritious diet full of unprocessed natural foods with a properly designed strategic exercise program that stimulates the necessary hormonal and metabolic response within your body. Both your food intake as well as your training program are important if you are to get this right.<br>  <br>  I've actually even seen a particular study that divided thousands of participants into a diet-only group and an exercise/diet group. While both groups in this study made good progress, the diet-only group lost significantly LESS abdominal fat than the diet & exercise combined group.<br>  <br>  Now the important thing to realize is that just any old exercise program will not necessarily do the trick. The majority of people that attempt getting into a good exercise routine are NOT working out effectively enough to really stimulate the loss of stubborn abdominal fat. I see this everyday at the gym.<br>  <br>  Most people will do your typical boring ineffective cardio routines, throw in a little outdated body-part style weight training, and pump away with some crunches and side bends, and think that they are doing something useful for reducing their abdominal fat. Then they become frustrated after weeks or months of no results and wonder where they went wrong.|`|3rvsG372aa	You need to do stomach exercises to tone up your stomach.  I advise getting one of those ab wheels, they're easy to use and very effective (and you can get them pretty cheap at a Walmart)

Sometimes delivering a baby can cause this especially in women that are not physically fit.      Doing jump rope will exercise the muscles that are not in pain and draw fresh blood through your thighs.  As long as you are eating healthy then the jump rope should help you recover and if not then you might need a surgery to restore blood circulation.

ykCo6SDOaa	Sudden unexplained weight loss can be an indication of serious health problems I would advise you to see your doctor as soon as possible.    A steady diet loss would be about 2 to 3 lbs a week - that's about half (max) what you have lost without trying. You are looking at almost a pound a day through the month and if you have not changed lifestyle you should get a check up.    Added: Note that 2 months ago you MAY have been OK. And Doctors are not perfect. A simple health check may well have overloked a major issue brewing. I urge you to go back and ask for more in depth checks.     It may be NOTHING - but a major cause of unexplained wieght loss can be a rapidly growing cancer - for example. You do not want to wait longer on this one - please believe me.

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|S5FZy9Ppaa	Sorry, you are the only person who can do that. call gene simmons.|`|07vq1Y8iaa	Losing weight is all about calories. The human body is only capable of losing 2lbs a week of body-fat. When trying to lose weight you must try to eat between 300-600 calories below your maintenance levels. For example... Im a big guy and my Maintenance calorie levels are 2600 now in order for me to lose weight i have to eat 2100 calories. Now that i know how many calories i need to eat to lose weight slowly and safely i have to choose a diet with types of food that will all add up to 2100 calories...    But first you will need to calculate your Maintenance calories which is the amount of calories you need to maintain your body weight. You can easily do that in the following link http://yoursuperbody.com/A-Nutrition-die... and scroll down to the Calorie Counter and then click "Settings" then fill in your Weight and Age etc. Once you have completed that subtract somewhere between 300-500 calories from your Maintenance Calories and then begin using the Calorie Counter to work out what food and how much of it you can eat.

fZCfJWpOaa	I did a quick search and found information from the Mayo clinic on antidepressants during pregnancy.  They also have a list of commonly used medications:     http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/antidep...    It seems that women do use antidepressants during pregnancy, but it's still early to know how much they affect the embryo and fetus.  Some medications are considered safer than others.  However, it is not recommended to stop taking medication all together to protect against a depression relapse.    I took some medications and spoke to my doctor before we started trying to conceive on whether or not it was safe to take while pregnant.  You should make an appointment before you try to conceive anyway to get a prescription of folic acid from your doctor, which is important to be on before you conceive to protect against neural tube defects.    So, talk to your doctor and see if he or she has any recommendations.  It is not only important that the baby is safe, but that you are safe and healthy during your pregnancy--physically and emotionally.|`|a7Osxk2iaa	Its best to ask your doctor.

The key ingredient is not medication, lifestyle changes, or relaxation exercises. It is when the individual no longer fears the thought of having a panic attack. <br>  <br>  This may seem like a simplified and obvious observation but give it careful consideration. The one thing that has you searching for a solution to anxiety and panic attacks this very moment is the fear of having another one.<br>  <br>  The first time a person experiences a panic attack it can feel like their world is falling down around them. Nowhere feels safe as the anxiety becomes like a stalker lurking in the background. <br>  <br>  When this happens people begin to either avoid situations that make them anxious or they medicate themselves to the point where they are numb to the fear.

I do know, the woman, who started the program wrote a book called "From Panic to Power" and you could find that.<br>  <br>  Medication helps, temporarily .. . but medication alone doesn't work without therapy. That said, panic disorder is the most curable of the mental disturbances. Most do not require medication -- it only requires therapy. Medication helped me for one year and I weaned myself off (Paxil) and moved to the natural "St. John's Wort" (after I completely finished Paxil). Then, after a time, I found I didn't even need the "St. John's Wort". There is also the natural "Valerian Root" tea. [WARNING:Valerian root is how valium is made -- and Valerian Root tea has a strong, strong odor. If you can get past the odor, it does calm you down and is natural).<br>  <br>   Meditation, though, can stop it<br>  . . . try <a href="http://www.flowdreaming.com." rel="nofollow">http://www.flowdreaming.com.</a><br>  It completely CLEARED my panic disorder! There's a CD titled "Immediate Relief" which is just for this type of thing. There's also one for "Health" and "Well-Being".<br>  <br>  And from the informercial program, here is a breathing exercise.<br>  <br>  When a panic attack is coming on, do this:<br>  <br>  Concentrate on your breathing . . .<br>  Take two full breaths in through your nose <br>  One . . . One thousand<br>  Two . . . One thousand<br>  <br>  Then, breath out through your mouth for four counts:<br>  One . . . One thousand<br>  Two . . . One thousand<br>  Three . . . One thousand<br>  Four . . . One thousand<br>  <br>  Do this a few times . . . until you stop hyperventilating . . .<br>  Then, exchange the breaths with words . . .<br>  <br>  In through the nose:<br>  I am safe .. .<br>  I can breath . . .<br>  <br>  Out through the mouth:<br>  I am here ...<br>  I am breathing . . .<br>  I am secure . . .<br>  I am healthy . . .<br>  <br>  The words must be comforting . . . <br>  This exercise nips a panic attack in the bud without medication.<br>  <br>  And they have special over-the-counter medications that do not cause anxiety. You may want to avoid those that do for a few months . . . and liquor. I stopped drinking liquor for almost five years, you can drink fruit juice and other things. Even seltzer . . . why make it worse?

Once your foreskin retracts, you should wash underneath it once a day to clear away any secretions.  You should be able to accomplish this with just water; soap will probably feel most uncomfortable.  When you're done with that dry your penis and let your foreskin fold over to cover the glans again.<br>  <br>  Other than that, there's no requirement to retract your foreskin.  You can do so as often as you want when playing with yourself, if you like the feeling.  As your glans becomes less sensitive, you may enjoy uncovering it and stroking it gently, perhaps with some lotion or lubricant.  This simulates the experience you will have with a partner in the future.  Wipe or rinse off any foreign substance on your glans before you cover it up again.<br>  <br>  Your foreskin should easily slide back to uncover your glans and forward again to cover it without any squeezing of your glans.  If the opening feels tight and doesn't slide back over the glans easily, you should manually stretch it until it develops the ability to do so.  Just spread it open with your fingers, not far enough to hurt, and go just a bit farther each day.  You can do this when you're taking a bath or shower and the skin is more elastic.|`|0usYKmX9aa	you can keep it retracted as long as you want, and the more you do it, the more it will not be so sensitive.<br>  <br>  its best to have it go all the way back, easier to clean and keep clean|`|Ldy7mNHKaa	There is no amount of time you need to have it exposed.

The human body is only capable of losing 2lbs a week of body-fat. When trying to lose weight you must try to eat between 300-600 calories below your maintenance levels. For example... Im a big guy and my Maintenance calorie levels are 2600 now in order for me to lose weight i have to eat 2100 calories. Now that i know how many calories i need to eat to lose weight slowly and safely i have to choose a diet with types of food that will all add up to 2100 calories...    But first you will need to calculate your Maintenance calories which is the amount of calories you need to maintain your body weight. You can easily do that in the following link http://yoursuperbody.com/A-Nutrition-die... and scroll down to the Calorie Counter and then click "Settings" then fill in your Weight and Age etc. Once you have completed that subtract somewhere between 300-500 calories from your Maintenance Calories and then begin using the Calorie Counter to work out what food and how much of it you can eat.    Good-luck  Any questions feel free to email me  Anthony
BNAzjSO1aa	Do you mean when visiting different countries or do you mean going out as in eating out? If you mean when visiting countries abroad the general guidelines are drink bottled water, do not eat salad /use ice cubes unless washed in/made from bottled water.

But if you mean just going out for meal etc then I think you have it covered but it sounds like you are overly worried by the chances of picking up a stomach bug.

Y6YrRo7Uaa	You probably hear all of the hype about that new famous weight loss duo, that promises to shed the extra pounds quick and cleanse your body at the same time. The acai-berry power 500 and colon total cleanse diet duo are really what they stand up to be. I tried them for 2 months and lost about 20 pounds noticeably fast. I highly recommend these products. The only downside was that the company that sells these pills is RETARDED. They offer a free trial and then charge you before the trial is up. Also, to cancel your membership with the pills you have to wait for 30 minutes on hold with the company, and a call to two different cancellation numbers, because they are trying to bore people out of cancelling their account. It is also pretty expensive at about $80 dollars a bottle a month, but I have to say that it was well worth the money. I do have to recommend that if you are going to try these, you should buy the bottles off of ebay or amazon, seperately, when needed because the customer service of the site that sells them is truly a ripoff.|`|DcywamI3aa	Theres a diet that you can try thats perfectly safe.

677bc72a53a3d69018bbcce7ac7bb384aa	Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neuro-genetic disorder characterized by intellectual and developmental delay, sleep disturbance, seizures, jerky movements especially hand-flapping, frequent laughter or smiling, and usually a happy demeanour. AS is a classic example of genetic imprinting in that it is usually caused by deletion or inactivation of genes on the maternally inherited chromosome 15.<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  What causes it?<br>  Angelman syndrome is a chromosomal disorder caused by the absence of a gene. Interestingly, 75 per cent of those with Angelman syndrome have a similar genetic fault to that found in another genetic condition, Prader-Willi syndrome, but occurring on the chromosome 15 inherited from the mother rather than the father. <br>  <br>  The genetic abnormality may be due to one of several possible types of problems with the chromosomes:<br>  <br>  A small deletion of part of chromosome 15 - this accounts for about 75 per cent of cases<br>  Paternal disomy - about two to three per cent of cases result from inheriting two copies of chromosome 15 from the father<br>  Mutation of the UBE3A gene in 15 per cent - there's a risk the condition will recur in other children born to the mother<br>  Translocation involving chromosome 15 in a few cases<br>  An error in the imprinting of chromosome 15 in about five per cent<br>  In some cases, the genetic abnormality has yet to be identified<br>  <br>  <br>  Chromosome 15 is almost unique in that it carries an imprinted region, which means that it's marked so the copy inherited from the mother behaves differently from that from the father. Errors in imprinting can affect a baby's development. In this type of Angelman syndrome, there's a risk the condition will recur in other children born to the mother.<br>  <br>  What are the symptoms?<br>  Typical features of Angelman syndrome are a small head (microcephaly), epilepsy, severe learning difficulties (with poor communication skills and little or absent speech), an unsteady or ataxic gait, a characteristic facial appearance and a happy disposition.<br>  <br>  How is it diagnosed?<br>  Early developmental delay may be noticed but the diagnosis isn't usually made until the age of three or later, when other features become apparent.<br>  <br>  Genetic tests can confirm the diagnosis. These may be done antenatally using CVS or amniocentesis if there's known to be a risk. However, in most cases the condition does not recur within one family.<br>  <br>  What's the treatment?<br>  There's no cure for Angelman syndrome. Support for specific problems such as learning difficulties is important.

Make sure you do your pelvic floor exercises because they really do help and it also helps to get anything else back to normal down there!|`|cmoGATT9aa	i havent had a baby but i know pleanty of people that ahve and have shocking bladders.    google 'pelvic floor muscel exercises'   i've heard it works wonders    good luck xx|`|1zPXQ3uNaa	Yes happened to me with both my kids. Can take a while for it to settle down.|`|p3NsXo0baa	That is why you rmeant to do kegal exercises. You sit on the toilet, while your urinating stop and try to hold it then keep going. This will strengthen your muscles back up. I had mys on 6 months ago but never had problems with incontinence becasue i done kegals since i was 30 weeks pregnant.    Just to add, kegals are pelvic floor exercises.

a7Osxk2iaa	Honey,it shouldnt hurt. Maybe you should try the smaller size. Good luck|`|kprKXEOSaa	Inserting a tampon shouldn't hurt.  You don't push it straight up, the vagina angles back, so try inserting at a different angle.  You can also try inserting one when your flow is very heavy, with a smaller tampon, so it will slide right in because of the moisture.    Google Tampax and take a look at their site.  You can also contact them with specific questions, and they will probably send you some coupons, too.  Good luck!|`|9679eed4decfc91fdcea2e17ae362313aa	Use a plastic applicator!|`|xBgKqAPHaa	squat down so ur legs are spread open then inserr it slowly  shouldntr hurt at all|`|VerfhAQcaa	Use a tampon with a plastic applicator.

If you do not have enough blood then it will be too dry to insert the tampon.  Even after being married for years, it can hurt to put in a tampon if there is not enough blood yet.    Also, if you are a virgin maybe you should stick with a pad.    Note: A tampon should never hurt. If it does reinsert one or stick with pads.|`|pWqYGLOLaa	Tampax Sport is awesome.. get some and it'll be real easy..
PnMtlZ0Yaa	I cheated by looking at your question history:  You discuss periods of depriving yourself of food.   You mentioned feeling "way too fat."  You discussed feeling like your body was trashed by your pregnancy.   You posted "anorexia, for or against?"    You posted about using Ex-lax for the purpose of weight loss.  You posted that you are pro-anorexic.   It is an eating disorder. Your height and weight have nothing to do with it.     You need to discuss this with your doctor. You need to be honest with your doctor about it.     Starvation and ex-lax are not the answers to your dissatisfaction with your appearance. You need to establish an exercise regimen for yourself. Make it part of your routine.     ALWAYS keep a healthy diet. Be consistent in the quality and quantity of foods you eat. Don't watch calories or get involved in a weight loss diet. You wouldn't just give your baby water and breadcrumbs for a week, would you? Then why make your body suffer that way?      You need to understand that your body will cycle monthly and at times you may bloat or retain water. Accept it.     Oh, I hope you liked Chuck in 3D!

5kXxr6r0aa	depends on what you're working for.<br>  <br>  if you're looking for tone (less size, but more of a defined outlined and visible muscle), then 30 seconds to a minute is ideal.<br>  <br>  if you're working for power though, using heavier weights with more sets and less reps per set, then you'll want to bring that waiting time from around 1-3 minutes. A lot of guys will tell you 3 minutes is way too long, but for a power workout, it's totally acceptable.<br>  <br>  hope that helped good luck with your goals|`|OeFNGqbzaa	30 sec. is a good time|`|ljVwo5qZaa	30sec is too short. 60-90 seconds is much better.<br>  <br>  You should do another body part instead of standing around (if that's what you do). So do a set of curls and then without resting go do some abs or chest,shoulder, tri, leg work. Usually that works out to about a 60sec break.<br>  <br>  Don't forget to keep good form on those curls. Keep the elbows in and don't let them rise when you lift the weight. If you can't curl w/o raising your elbow it's time to lower the weights.|`|hUfgIX3eaa	It depends on how much you stressed the muscle.  I personally will count back up to the number of reps I just completed and then start again.  i.e., I do 3 sets of 25 reps, so I do 25, then rest 25 counts, and start again.  Smaller muscles I will only do 3 sets of 15 reps, so I count to 15.|`|G1OSlub8aa	depends on how heavy the weights are. if its a lighter weight than 30-40 seconds, if its a heavy weight you need more time for glycogen stores to get back to normal.|`|UFYOzP41aa	30 seconds.|`|Ccbr7pV0aa	45 to 60 seconds for maximum growth.

All the info you want on saturated fat, unsaturated fats is online you can find out the good and bad easily then only eat the good.|`|AHk1r9wbaa	Don't eat carbs late in the day, or in the afternoon unless you're doing some physical activity..    Secret behind carbs.. simple sugar aka simple carbs are in fruits, milk, candy, all that... Milk is okay, before working out..  If you don't use the sugar, your body will turn it into fat.. same with fruit.. i wouldn't recommend the fruit juice.. just peel an orange, you get less sugar, and +8 grams of fiber.. a lot better trade, wouldn't ya say?    Natural sugar, yes it's natural, but it also will make you gain weight..  Good carbs/complex carbs are whole wheat sources of grains like whole wheat bread, brown rice.. and stuff like kidney beans.. they take longer before they're stored as fat, and can be used as energy for as long as 4-6 hours..    Simple sugar lasts less than 30 mins..  It's not just simple sugar that makes you gain weight, any carb will if you're not using energy.    I would suggest eating carbs and egg whites in the morning/mid morning time.. saving your lean meats and veges for later on in the day, protein shakes if you drink them..    Soda, bad stuff right? yeah your body doesn't really process the sugar very well, but diet soda.. i thought that was cool too, until i learned it can lead to certain cancers, and the artificial sweetner is worse than sugar.. your body doesn't recognize it, so it doesn't get processed.. instead, it's stored as fat..    In terms of carbs, maybe 200 if you're active.. if not, I'd try 60-120.. if you wanna cut fat man, cardio is the best way to go.. even if it's walking on the treadmill for 30 min w/ your ipod and some kind of magazine.. thats 200 calories burned..    But basically, the simple sugars like fruits and milk are good, yeah, but if you wanna lose fat I'd suggest eating them in the morning or before working out.. maybe cuttin them to a minimum if you wanna see some serious fatloss.. If your body doesn't use the stuff, it's just added fat.. Best of luck, keep up the good stuff brother
ZS7Ew7F3aa	I know you would prefer easy shopping but I recommend you at least go talk to someone at a health food store. I have found them to be really knowledgeable. & keep in mind that if your son eats a healthy, well-rounded diet then multivitamins may not even be necessary for him.   You can also make a quick call to his pediatrician who should be able to easily advise you, & s/he can base it on your son's health & growth history!|`|TFfgskH0aa	i would like to share some info with you about those vit. at the store. they are so unnutritous. they have all kinds of additives in them and most of the vits. are not absorbed into the body because they are not food form where your body can absorb them.  i will give you a website to check out  www.exploremannatech.com   then get back in contact with me at jjwitter@verizon.net so we can chet more in detail and get more info to you.

b959c1bacc75d8acf50a00e99fc88981aa	There are a number of different possibilities, but the most likely is malnutrition. Many people disrupt their fat-storage processes by starving themselves, because they think that this will improve their health.    The idea that eating less, or less fat, must be good for your body IS A MYTH.    If you eat very little fat, your body will be desperate to store whatever fat is available. Triglyceride is the 'storage' form of fat (three 'fat chains' joined together by a 'glycerol group'), and it can't be burned as fuel because the glycerol acts like a 'fire retardent'.    The Triglycerides can't be stored, because your body wants to use the fat as fuel for activity. But the fat can't be released, because not enough energy is available to power the process.     Eating more fats (and probably eating more generally) will allow your body to fuel more activity. GENTLE activity (movements that don't need conscious 'effort') burns fat as fuel.    If you are getting enough fuel from your diet, you will be able to store the triglycerides in fat ('adipose') cells, where they are harmless. This process won't make you fat, IF you are active enough at the same time.     (Healthy fat cells are always storing and releasing fat at the same time; activity helps to make them release more, and store less.)    Restricting your diet makes it very difficult to be active enough for good health. Eating the right amount of nutritious food (ALL food groups are necessary) will enable your body to handle its nutrient and fuel needs much better.|`|spXPpyP0aa	EXERCISE|`|7uV0SAWnaa	Only thing I can tell is that your triglycerides level is too high to be comfortable. LDL is okay - though prefereably it should be about 100 or lower. Following foods can contribute to high glycerides level - cakes , biscuits, chocolates, dairy food, starchy foods and the like. Only thing to do to reduce is to get 30 minutes of exercise daily. Doctors give a drug to lower it  and is called gemfibrozil tablts.

2eGMXYaIaa	v\You need to do cardio!  When I say that you have to work hard and get your heart rate up.  So many people say they do cardio but they walk or job leisurely on the treadmill or elliptical.  Running is the best way to shred excess fat (make sure you have good knees).  It's not about losing 2 or 3 pounds here and there because it is very easy to gain it back.  You have to change the complexion of how your body functions.  Consistency is the key.  The more you workout your metabolism will burn fat at a higher rate.  Eventually you want your body to work for you, not work for your body (if that makes sense).  And if you want to lift and workout I recommend doing high intensity circuit workouts where you are doing an exercise one after another, to again, get your heart rate up and increase your fitness level (not be one of the those people we do a set, rest for 2-3 minutes and do another one).  There is too much down time, that's good for increasing strength but not overall fitness.  Diet is just as important as working out!|`|3b43628da17fa39fdf0695aa42cc5afdaa	To lose weight (fat), include more fibrous slow digesting carbs, as opp. to the fast digesting ones. <br>  <br>  No white breads, fast foods, sodas (not even diet) no ketchups, sugar, only skim milk, not 2%, skim and whole grain non sweet (sugary) cereal, whole wheat bread, maybe buy some soy or whey protein.<br>  <br>  Include lean meats like ham, and other sources of protein. Avoid red meats. Take a multivitamin, calcium and vitamin d every 2 days, one or two V8s a day (or every other day). <br>  <br>  Don't starve, eat small healthy meals. A lot of small meals opposed to a few bigger ones-- make sure is has at least 8-10 or more g of protein, not too much protein because the body can only digest a certain amount at a time; and avoid too many fruits, carbs and sugars. Fibrous veggies, greens (no starches or potatoes) are good, and no BBQ sauce (unless used sparingly) and not too much (if any) salad dressing. <br>  <br>  Before bed (2 hrs), eat something with protein, don't<br>  eat many carbs before bed. Eat some of that good cereal in the morning, you need quality carbs, just not too much, and the slow digesting ones.<br>  <br>  Do slow crunches until you can not do anymore, jog stairs (be safe though), warm up first and do sprints, short bursts of intense activity is very effective compared to long weak activity, just don't over do it. Also include some slow but long endurance jogging. Be active!<br>  <br>  Jog stairs ;and also do some lunges until it burns, do this every day or 2 days, keep going and don't give up, same with eating, you need some fat, so one or two fish oils daily.<br>  <br>  Eat fish (not fried, be careful, very careful for bones) Peanut butter on whole wheat (no jelly), which has protein, and don’t worry about the fat in that. Avocados, has fat, good fat; eat it when your hunger cravings get you. <br>  <br>  When you do crunches, also twist on some to work your sides, keep tension on your abs. <br>  <br>  <br>  Need more info, go to <a href="http://www.bodybuilding.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bodybuilding.com</a>|`|bszyOuIqaa	Replace old bad habits with new good ones.

Sh7r0kNuaa	its not true. the way they did the study is by asking people with testicular cancer if they had ever smoked pot, and if so when they had. so many people experiment with marijuana that you could ask that same question to people with any disease and find a correlation. it wasn't a well constructed study.|`|IMvg8zajaa	Can't cause cancer: <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/05/26/MNGAKJ2S481.DTL&type=science" rel="nofollow">http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cg...</a><br>  Like the guy above me said, can't cause testicular cancer.|`|T2JlDJD7aa	Yes, it has four times the amount of cancer-causing agents as tobacco.

Z9ZWq2iNaa	Actually, you don't have to diet per se if you want to lose weight, the one diet that really delivered for me is wu-yi tea, it can be checked out in the resource box below, they have a few free trials in stock, it was highlighted in Reader's Digest and CNN. I worked off 25 pounds, it really does produce results!
3y9AlP6Raa	Whatever the truth.   It`s real enough to you.<br>  Can you talk to your Grandmother.........carefully, and watch her reaction.<br>  Before you do, think if it happened what you want to do about it.<br>  How do you get on with your Uncle now?<br>  Are you old enough, strong enough to ask him.<br>  It`s not fair, but consider what the truth would matter to you, and if it did happen what could/would you do about it?<br>  Maybe, it would serve your purpose to, carefully, insinuate to your uncle that you remember, but do it so that if he us guilty, he would know that you know and if he isn`t, doesn`t.<br>  Do you trust your Grandmother enough to look out for you.<br>  In which case.   If it happened. She knows and he knows.<br>  Sometimes anaylising can be it`s own problem.<br>  I am not qualifying what he may or may not have done,but I am concerned about you.<br>  I am 61 years old, an ex cop and have a daughter, to whom I would be saying the same.<br>  It isn`t the best but it is the best I can offer.|`|AA10020760	Talk to your Grandmother about it.|`|FKDv6ycbaa	get a shrink, you need help|`|z1xBUi8Jaa	i sometimes have dreams i suddenly remember and think they are real but you can never really tell<br>  if you dont want to talk to your grandmother about it... do some detective work.<br>  how does your uncle act around you and [i'm sorry to say this] other children? maybe family children?<br>  does he look at them or you in a weird way? is he very touchy feely? maybe you should talk to someone about this. maybe a doctor, who can get you a counciller to talk about it?|`|0Pkup44haa	ask grandma|`|qO3w1Iq7aa	Ask your grandma.|`|3Ln5Gastaa	im really sorry for you , but it wasnt a dream n im pretty sure, i think u should talk to someone u r really close 2 aka mom just tell her what happened n how it haunting u n im sure shell sort ur uncle ouT!

It might be hard at first but just give it a try.|`|7d631c01cf0e5633e2dfbfb918c6300faa	Ask your grandmother.  Tell her what you said in this question.  Explain that you're unsure if its true or not and explain how it has haunted you.|`|ZTRakv6maa	chances are if you've had that memory for as long as you have, yeah..he probably touched ya. pervs just dont touch a kid out of the blue.... they usually condition the kid to get them to think its okay in a way. it all depends on what you feel like you should do. as for family--yeah, it'll screw some stuff up. but ya know what?? if it helps you, and they love you to stand by you...it'll be worth it in the end. thats just my opinion though. good luck with all of this. you should try to find a support group you can talk about this with. people who know where you're coming from.|`|kfWi9ZkEaa	1. you don't have to go telling all the world, my goodness, what sort of advice is that? Start world war three without any clear idea?  <br>  <br>  2.  Probably did happen, you probably had a lucky escape.  As to telling: you have two choices.<br>  <br>  1.  mention it to your mother, if you have a good relationship with her.  It might freak her out or it might even have happened to her as a child.  Either way, say it with great humility: this 'may' have happened.  This softens the blow.<br>  <br>  2. explain to her why you needed to tell her.  Fact is, you don't have to tell anyone else at all.  Telling mum will be enough - it may have been enough to tell us - can you feel it already?    Mum, if she is in a good space, may well give advice such as 'theyr'e in their eighties, you're safe now, let's not kick up a stink but here, come and have a big hug and I'm so, so glad you escaped.'  This may be enough.  You probably don't have enough for a court case: you certainly don't want to cause family stink and I don't see any rational reason to go make your grandmother miserable.  The horse has well bolted: leave the gate alone.  What a terrifying idea!  <br>  <br>  You don't have to create when these things happen - telling Mum is usually all you have to do.  She will know what to do about it because she's been in the family much longer.  <br>  <br>  General rule of thumb:  nobody go off half-****** and do/say anything to anyone until decided to at least 3 days later.  Give any emotional experience 3 days to settle:  you may freak mum out, she may leap to your defence - whatever you do, do a deal with her that you neither of you do anything whatsoever that does not prove absolutely necessary, and that you'll give anything 3 days to see if you really think it's so necessary.  You've lasted this long, 3 days is nothing.<br>  <br>  Good girl, though:  good girl for asking if it was real, good girl for checking things out.  Clever girl.  You're going about this absolutely the right way - but you're right that you need to clear it up.  Tell Mum.<br>  (by the way, tell mum might actually mean 'tell dad' or 'tell auntie fay' in your family.  Tell the person you talk to when you need a sensible, friendly response from whoever is the calmest and best person when you have a problem.  It's usually mum, but it could be your uncle for all I know.)<br>  <br>  PS:  why has it affected your whole life?  Surely msot of the time you didn't think about it?  My dad pointed a deer-shooting rifle at me at the age of 5 and said "shut up or I shoot her" to my mum - and it was indelibly etched:  but as to wrecking my life, I think one must consent to have one's life wrecked by such things.  I had moments of woe when I remembered it, and I blamed all sorts of things on it - which I otherwise would not have blamed on it, and therefore would have had to deal with - (so I suppose I could blame them on it for that reason, couldn't I?) but in the end, you can blame your mother for giving birth - you can blame granny for having your mother.  Once one starts casting blame, there's sooooo many targets.  Takes forever, quicker just to solve problems than to find someone to blame for them.<br>  <br>  ;o)
pjYQhPPBaa	Everyone did read your question, and there were quite a few that answered your question to the best of their knowledge. Remember, they don't know you and they're not doctors so they can't possibly know if/when you're going to start your period. Not even your doctor knows when you get your period.<br>  <br>  I had all the signs for getting my period nearly 2 years before I got it. I got my period when I was 11 and 85 pounds, so you don't have to be 100 pounds. Usually those who are over 100 pounds when they get their period are overweight for their age, thus causing them to get their period earlier than they should have. (My Grandma went through menopause for a brief period of time because she was overweight, but then started her period again after getting acupuncture!)<br>  <br>  The signs for getting your period are armpit hair, pubic hair, breast growth (you can physically feel it at times) , growing pains (pains in your joints)...cramps sometimes have nothing to do with it. I didn't have cramps until the day of.<br>  <br>  I truly don't understand why girls these days want their period. It means you can get pregnant and you will be bleeding for a week straight every month. What's so great about that?|`|bO2rzfISaa	Well, 7 people answered you question.

But perhaps you are just bloated. Do you eat a lot of salt in your diet?|`|q0ce9dEnaa	That is overweight, but choosing to diet is your own decision.

I'm not sure why.<br>  <br>  It is silly, we know this, but that doesn't mean we can just change it like that.

I never eat in public, or if I have to, I only take small bites because I feel so self conscious and suffer from a rock-bottom self-esteem.

You sound like you have a healthy lifestyle, so just carry on eating in small bites :)|`|up4CNbs9aa	I used to feel that way for awhile, especially around guys.

Jswomud7aa	If I were you I wouldn't go back to your dentist. There is a certain level of professionalism that every health care practitioner should maintain and it's extremely disappointing when they fall sub-par. <br>  <br>  Many dentist use a lab that sends cases out to China. It's pretty common. While most of the time the labs to a desent job they do tend to get confused easily. <br>  <br>  You are well within your right to request a "lab slip" from your dentist. If you paid extra for an upgraded crown it's an even more important that he prove to you that you are getting what you're paying for. <br>  <br>  If you choose to go back to this dentist, make him show you the crown before seating it. Look it over really well and make sure it looks like what you paid for. You can google the type of crown you got and familiarize yourself with what it looks like/made out of.<br>  <br>  There is a crown that is made with a zirconia reinforced coping (the inner part of the crown). It's as strong as metal but is actually full porcelain. If it's not too late I would recommend for you to call the dentist and ask if you can have that type of crown fabricated (if that's not the crown you chose already). LAVA by 3M is what we use in our office. The doctor has probably done over 400 crowns without a defect in a single one! <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  When a lab pours the porcelain to fabricate the crown, the dye they use is already mixed in. So if you cut the crown in half you will see that it's a uniform color completely through and not just the outside. <br>  <br>  The American Dental Association recently reported that a crown made in an overseas dental lab may contain lead. While they are not sure if this is an isolated incident or a larger problem, the ADA is working closely with federal regulatory agencies to investigate this problem. <br>  <br>  The American Dental Association advises that you ask your dentist whether he / she makes the crowns in the office or sends them off to a lab. If they are made in a dental lab, ask where the lab is located and if the dental lab ships the crowns to a foreign country. If so, they should be able to provide written documentation that they are registered with the FDA.|`|t2D5P9Dpaa	buddy, you need to change dentists. You are paying him, he works for you. Not the other way around. He sounds ridiculously unprofessional and you shouldn't be yelled at or spoken badly about. I think you really should just call, tell them politely that you are completely unhappy with the service you have been provided and you will not be returning because of that dentist, and find someone new that you can actually talk to.
AA10391286	What you put in your mouth is more important that exercise in my opinion.  If you exercise and eat junk then you're working against your goals.  Eating right, drinking plenty of water, and exercise is the key.  You should be consuming about 1200 calories in healthy food a day, I know because I'm 148 lbs 5'4" and on track to loosing 20 lbs after having a baby.

qnD5RfbPaa	Many persons tend to get confused the difference between acidic foods and alkaline foods.  Acid foods are foods that become acid when ingested.  These are foods such as corn, rice, macaroni, noodle etc.<br>  <br>  Alkaline foods are foods that become alkaline when ingested.  These are foods such as pineapple, citrus, tomatoes etc.<br>  <br>  Now with that out of the way I will answer your question.  You are having the problem with tomatoes because your digestive system is off balance.  It is too acidic.  Some persons have problem with all sour fruits, others with sweet potatoes.  Before I found out what to do mine had reached the stage whereby if I have a drink of water it burns.   As soon as your pH is balanced again, you'll find that you will not have a problem.  <br>  <br>  You could correct this one of two way - using the quick method I used and get it over with within 4 day.  Or just make a general adjustment in your diet and allow your system to gradually balance itself.<br>  <br>  Quick Method<br>  Start your morning with a tall glass of citrus juice (orange or grapefruit)<br>  Allow an hour to pass<br>  Have a bowl of fresh raw fruits - all kinds of fruits (full your stomach)<br>  Allow two hours to pass<br>  Eat a mixture of nuts and seeds mixed in with a few raisins. (as much as you can) - between the fruit meal and the nut meal drink pure water<br>  Allow two hours to pass, have fruit meal again, followed by nuts and seed meal with water between and keep repeating for the entire day; for four days then return to a routine of a balance of fruits, vegetables, complex starchy carbohydrates, and proteins.<br>  <br>  The slower method is to have a glass of citrus juice first thing in the morning.<br>  Follow and hour later with your breakfast<br>  <br>  Two hours later a bowl of fresh raw fruits (all kind of fruits including pine apple)<br>  <br>  Later in the day have a meal consisting of meat or fish,<br>  1 or 2 complex carbohydrate (eg. yam, potatoes, pumpkin etc)<br>  a mixture of raw vegetables, (eg. lettuce, tomatoes, cucumber, broccoli, yellow or red sweet pepper, shredded carrots)<br>  varied mixture of steam vegetables (eg a leafy vegetable and/or string beans, or a vegetable salad<br>  <br>  This may be followed by a bowl of pure tomatoes<br>  <br>  Please note: do not eat your tomatoes or fruits along with anything else or within one hour before or after any other meal.  They should be eaten by themselves preferably on an empty stomach.  You should also be drinking water between meal - a total of 8 to 10 glasses of water per day.<br>  <br>  Until your stomach pH balances again (The optimum pH range for human tissues is between 7.35 to 7.45), avoid, ketchup or any other commercially made tomato sauces.  These are usually made with sugar and will result in the burning sensation.  After your digestive system is healed, you'll be back to eating any or everything again without discomfort.  I know because I'm able to.<br>  <br>  Avoid antacids.  They damage your digestive system in the long run by stimulating the stomach to produce more acid in order to create the proper balance.  Also they destroy some essential nutrients.|`|nAp688tZaa	Tomato products, as well as other acidic fruits, have high levels of natural acid in them that can cause heartburn and acid reflux.  Really, the only two solutions are to cut out all tomato products from your diet or to take a preventative medication like Pepcid. The best thing is that most preventative medications are now available over the counter and work just as well as any prescription medications aimed at treating the problem. This type of medication is able to neutralize the acid that is in tomatoes and other acidic fruits like oranges and limes, and not cause you the heartburn symptoms or damage to the stomach lining and esophagus.  So, if you like ketchup and tomato based sauces, then this is the best method that  know of to protect yourself from the pain of heartburn, indigestion, and acid reflux, all of which can damage your stomach with ulcers or damage your esophagus.|`|AA12224567	I've known several people to comment on this.<br>  It seems to usually have to do with excessive acid in he stomach.<br>  Coffee seems to have a very bad effect also.<br>  My wife had this in a very bad case and has scarred her esophagus to the point she has difficulty swallowing in the past.<br>  She has to take Prilosec almost daily for her future health.<br>  Please be cautious in what you eat and how it effects you.|`|QvrhmdAtaa	My Husband and I had the same problem with eating spaghetti so I started adding some sugar to the sauce,it really cut down on the acidity in the tomatoes and we don't suffer quite as badly now,sometimes not at all.

You may experiment with sweeter tomatoes and see if that helps. I would also like to suggest that if you consume yogurt everyday it may help you with acidity problem in general. Also drink lots of water and reduce coffee, tea and sugar intake.
n7KCez59aa	Hi !<br>  <br>  I have answered this question so many times that I now just copy and paste my story !<br>  <br>  If you want to loose fat, I suggest eating a well balanced diet.<br>  Grilled or baked lean meats, fruits, fiber, vegetables, water and un - salted nuts. <br>  <br>  Exercise 5 days of the week, alternating with cardio and strength training. Do not cross out anything from your " diet", save the 2 days that you do not work out for being able to eat junk foods. You will not over indulge, after 2 weeks of eating a well balanced diet, on the 2 off days you have, you will not want as much junk food. <br>  <br>  I lost 105 pounds in 1 year by eating this this way.|`|TrvFnYnmaa	I've been using Acai Berry for a while now and so far I've seen some great results.

There is no secret to it.  I tried all of the fads and all of the diets, and yeah, sure you may lose a bunch of weight really quickly, but you'll gain it back as soon as you go back to your normal eating habits.  The key is to change your lifestyle.  You need to eat lots of fruits and vegetables and cut out greasy and fried foods.  After few weeks, you find that your body starts to crave the healthy food more than the unhealthy.  I work out 4 times per week both weights and cardio.  Also, something to keep in mind is that rather than skipping meals or eating really big meals, eat 4-5 smaller meals throughout the day.  This keeps your metabolism going, and really prevents binge eating.  Good luck!|`|m1TSG9Cvaa	I would suggest a cleansing diet. I lost 12 pounds in 9 days and then 28 pounds in less than a month. I also lost a lot of inches too!   I learned that cleansing will help the body get rid of toxins.  Toxins come from a lot of things like fast food, pollution, food additives and preservatives and lots of other things.  The toxins get stored in the fat in our body.  To get rid of the fat, we have to get rid of the toxins by cleansing the body.  This made sense to me and I decided to try a cleanse program and it worked.  The weight came off fast and this kept me motivated to keep going, not like other diets where the weight loss it too slow. I did Jenny Craig, Weight Watcher and Medifast.  If you want to learn more call the toll free number 1-877-587-4647 or check out the website.  This was the first time I ever did a cleanse, it was easy and I feel better.  Good luck whatever you decide to do!  <a href="http://thebestcleansingdiet.com" rel="nofollow">http://thebestcleansingdiet.com</a>

c120fb8742987c4295de038bc9dcb8a8aa	A stroke is similar to a heart attack in that blood flow/supply is being cut off from a vital organ. With a stroke its your brain. Typically, the area of the brain that controls motor function is one of the more obvious potential outcomes or after effects of having a stroke. Additionally, as with a heart attack symptoms include pain and numbness along the left side of the body, a stroke can cause pain and numbness along the right side, but those symptoms are not mutually exclusive.|`|WadzK6ejaa	When it affect the neurones in the motor area which is in the anterior or frontal part of hemispheres|`|AA12358000	James S,<br>  There are two types of stroke - Ischemic stroke, this type of stroke happens when blood is blocked from getting to the brain. This often happens because the artery is clogged with fatty deposits or a blood clot. Hemorrhagic stroke -- This type of stroke happens when a blood vessel in the brain bursts, and blood bleeds into the brain. This type of stroke can be caused by an aneurysm which is a thin or weak spot in an artery that balloons out and can burst. The specific abilities that will be lost or affected by stroke depend on the extent of the brain damage and, most importantly, where, in the brain, the stroke occurred: the right hemisphere, the left hemisphere, the cerebellum or the brain stem. The chain of nerve cells that runs from the brain through the spinal cord out to the muscle is called the motor pathway. Normal muscle function requires intact connections all along this motor pathway. Damage at any point reduces the brain's ability to control the muscle's movements. This reduced efficiency causes weakness, also called paresis. Complete loss of communication prevents any willed movement at all. This lack of control is called paralysis. The way in which the person affected by stroke reacts to these changes will affect their personality, and may cause changes in control of emotions and behaviour.  People affected by stroke may become confused, self-centred, uncooperative and irritable, and may have rapid changes in mood. They may not be able to adjust easily to anything new and may become anxious, annoyed or tearful over seemingly small matters.<br>  <br>  ALL ANSWERS SHOULD BE THOROUGHLY RESEARCHED, IN ANY FORUM AND ESPECIALLY IN THIS ONE. -  MANY ANSWERS ARE FLAWED.<br>  <br>  <br>  The information provided here should not be used during any medical emergency or for the diagnosis or treatment of any medical condition.

As you may know, the body's organs and tissues need a blood supply containing oxygen and nutrients to stay alive. If the tissues do not have adequate circulation, they will die. In a stroke, a piece of a blood clot from the inside of a vein or artery breaks off and goes into blood circulation. If the clot makes its way to the brain, it can clog one of the arteries that feed the brain, causing and area of tissue death in the brain. Depending on where the clot clogs, it can affect any number of different functions (different areas of the brain control different parts of the body). Paralysis will occur if the motor function area of the brain dies from the clot.<br>  P.S. there is another kind of stroke that results from bleeding in the brain, but its a lot less common but has the same effects depending on the area as the other kind.|`|fg9TUTg6aa	haha I just wanted to laugh at the person who wrote in before me.

The right side of your brain controls the left side of your body and vise versa.  <br>  <br>  When you don't get blood to these areas (stroke), you lose motor function.  Sometimes you can regain it, sometimes you can't.

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|wxzeKh4Iaa	Take a look at the Fat X workout videos.

Also, they didn't seem to give me the same satisfaction that they once did, helping lessen the appeal of that first one in the evening.<br>  <br>  It's worth it if you want to quit.

It gives you ideas about lotions and creams you can put on him and it tingles and feels like oral. And much more!! Also, you could go online and just read and look at pictures.  If you aren't looking in that direction you could just tell your husband you don't like doing it, but you want to make him happy. And if you to have a strong open relationship maybe he can give you some insight on what he likes. I was a little embarrased at first talking to my husband about our sex life and changing it or trying new thingd. But when you don't like one thing you can replace it with something even better. I hope I helped a little! Good luck!|`|WVd2S6xWaa	tell him how you feel. he'll understand and you can cut it out of your diet, but if he is giving YOU oral, then you MUST reciprocate if you wish for it to be given back. however if you don't just simply get rid of it and you'll be good.|`|A5ZVXcVzaa	man if u dont like it then simplly don do it<br>  and if religion stops u from beeing ure self then just change religoin

I am not asking you to tell, but I think that is where the answer lies from what i read. Whatever his therapist has advised is clearly not working. Sounds to me like he is testing you and looking for answers in you. Go and see your GP.|`|ZaLrtSd7aa	you're correct this sounds like boundary testing and attention seeking. You may have to actually hold him in time out, but without emotion and not actually interacting with him while you do - no hugging or consoling. Time out is a punishment, not attention time. Above all be CONSISTENT. Never ever change because he's had a bad day (or you have!) because it will just confuse the hell out of him. Good luck|`|kBcI3Uleaa	I know from experience that he is only trying to control you and see what he can get away with. Plus children love attention even if it's positive or negative. I would ask for whatever he has that he's not suppose to, be calm and ask for it, if he hasn't given it to you by the third time. I would take it and tell him why he can't have it. If he starts to yell and scream try to act excited about something else and point his attention torge a toy,book,or movie.. Children have such  a short attention spand.  If that don't work I would give him a few choices of what he can have and do. Remember he's going to try to push your buttons and play the control game with you. If he's seen any fighting like arguments he's expression his frusteration by yelling and acting out because that's what he knows. He might not be able to talk to you but he knows what you are saying. I hope that helps a little.<br>  Just try to be patient and if it gets to the point where he's totally out of control and you tried giving him a few choices, speaked to him in a calm voice, try to make him think of something else,gave him a firm hug, tried interacting in a activity with him,and whatever else you use for tools. And nothing works I would try to put him, in time out, so he knows it's not okay to act like that. Children explode, then they vent, then they calm down and collect themselves, usually eat or drink then it's over and done with. And they act like nothing happened..! But I think if you did some sort of discipline when he acts like that next time he starts exploding he'll remember last time I acted like this mom put me in time out without toys or anything to do. I hope it all goes well, good luck!|`|kfWi9ZkEaa	At his age:  he is learning methods of control and power: they go through this at his age regardless of what visual experiences they have.  Two very, very important things to say to you.<br>  <br>  1.  Don't screw yourself up about what a small child sees.  If you had older children you would realise that your child at this age is a half-set jelly:  he has no moral loading on what he sees.  He is not at a stage of extrapolation, analysis, moral judgement and psychological damage.  He's a cat, a dog, a rabbit:  he experiences life and then experiences the next bit, and the next bit.  How many years did you have to sit in the car with your mother/father driving, thinking they're fine, and then you get your licence, and you realise their driving gives you the creeps?  Years, and years, and years, and years, and years.  A 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 6 - - 16-yr-old is not analysing the world the way you are so stop projecting.  Treat him like a cat.<br>  <br>  2.  Crime & punishment.  I always gave a hard smaack for screaming.  They go through a phase, and if you look in their eye they're looking straight at you, and screaming, and what's actually happening is a form of domination.  Theyt're training you to obey.  Like the rooster in the pen, like the dogfight, this is a power play.  You have to win.  As I say, I always gave a hard whack. I remember my eldest, at around 2 -3 would have days where he would get ten smacks - and then weeks when he was sunny, happy, fine, sweet.  It's like they can't cry, they can only scream, and if you smack them (they are usually doikng something naughty at this time, which is jolly convenient) the screams change to crying, which is healthy and purges stress fully.  If you follow that smack up with cuddles and sleep, by the time they wake they're a happy, normal, well-adjusted and cheerful child - well, till the next time.  <br>  <br>  Kids are just animals.  Treat them like pets until they're about five and they respond very well.  Just don't let yourself get screwed up, because you're captain of this ship and if you're a loose cannon, who'se looking after the baby?  Relax.  If primaeval cave-woman  chick could do it without any shrinks, or training, or rubbish like that, then you can.  Major, major rule however: listen to your feelings, listen to your instincts, but don't project, and don't read magical stuff into things.  A child will bemore screwed up by mummy changing the way she behaves towards him, changing her routines and expected responses than he EVER would by seeing something flit across his heyeballs that he cannot even comprehend.  When a child doesn't comprehend something, he pays it no attention.  Do you not remember this?<br>  <br>  This is a common concern, and a concern born of love: but beware it because there is no faster way to destroy your child, than to think he's already destroyed.  Your kid is fine, he's absolutely normal, he's just going through this stage which is an absolutely normal stage.<br>  <br>  Just read the beating up business - my answer still stands.  You'll wreck him far more badly thinking he's already wrecked, than you will by maintaining your standards, maintaining your expectations, and carrying on as usual.  Then, if he's able to extrapolate anything (which of course he can't but what the hey you may still believe he can) he will extrapolate that watching something unpleasant is not a good enough excuse for becoming an obnoxious little hitler.<br>  <br>  Mummy is boss.  What Mummy says goes.  Mummy Knows Best.  (I can say this because you obviously love your child and your problem is not that you are switched out or don't care, your problem comes from the other end of the spectrum.  I wouldn't actually say the above to just anybody....)

I went on to graduate from HS and college and now am working on my Masters' degree in counseling.|`|AA12041870	Turner syndrome (TS) is a medical disorder that affects about 1 in every 2,500 girls. Although researchers don't know exactly what causes Turner syndrome, they do know that it's the result of a problem with a girl's chromosomes (pronounced: krow-muh-soamz).<br>  <br>  Most girls are born with two X chromosomes, but girls with Turner syndrome are born with only one X chromosome or they are missing part of one X chromosome. The effects of the condition vary widely among girls with Turner syndrome. It all depends on how many of the body's cells are affected by the changes to the X chromosome.<br>  <br>  Girls with Turner syndrome are usually short in height. Girls with Turner syndrome who aren't treated for short stature reach an average height of about 4 feet 7 inches (1.4 meters). The good news is that when Turner syndrome is diagnosed while a girl is still growing, she can be treated with growth hormones to help her grow taller.<br>  <br>  In addition to growth problems, Turner syndrome prevents the ovaries from developing properly, which affects a girl's sexual development and the ability to have children. Because the ovaries are responsible for making the hormones that control breast growth and menstruation, most girls with Turner syndrome will not go through all of the changes associated with puberty unless they get treatment for the condition. Nearly all girls with Turner syndrome will be infertile, or unable to become pregnant on their own.<br>  <br>  Other Effects Turner Syndrome Can Have<br>  A number of other health problems occur more often in girls with Turner syndrome, including kidney problems, high blood pressure, heart problems, overweight, hearing difficulties, diabetes, and thyroid problems. Some girls with the condition may experience learning difficulties, particularly in math. Many have a difficult time with tasks that require skills such as map reading or visual organization.<br>  <br>  In addition to short stature and lack of sexual development, some of the other physical features commonly seen in girls with Turner syndrome are:<br>  <br>  a "webbed" neck (extra folds of skin extending from the tops of the shoulders to the sides of the neck) <br>  a low hairline at the back of the neck <br>  drooping of the eyelids <br>  differently shaped ears that are set lower on the sides of the head than usual <br>  abnormal bone development (especially the bones of the hands and elbows) <br>  a larger than usual number of moles on the skin <br>  edema or extra fluid in the hands and feet <br>  Because Turner syndrome can affect how a girl looks and develops, some girls may have problems with body image or self-esteem.<br>  <br>  People with TS are all different. Some may have many physical differences and symptoms, whereas others experience only a few medical problems. With early and appropriate medical care and ongoing support, most people with TS can lead normal, healthy, and productive lives.<br>  <br>  Diagnosing Turner Syndrome<br>  Girls with Turner syndrome are usually diagnosed either at birth or around the time they might be expected to go through puberty. If a baby girl has some of the signs of Turner syndrome, a doctor will usually order a special blood test called a karyotype. The test counts the number of chromosomes and can identify any that are abnormally shaped or have missing pieces. In some cases, there are no recognizable signs that a girl has the condition until she reaches the age at which she would normally go through puberty.<br>  <br>  If the karyotype blood test reveals that a girl has Turner syndrome, her doctor may order additional tests to check for problems with the kidneys, heart, hearing, and other problems that are often associated with Turner syndrome.<br>  <br>  Treating Turner Syndrome<br>  Because Turner syndrome is a condition that is caused by a chromosomal abnormality, there's no specific cure. However, scientists have developed a number of treatments that can help correct some of the problems associated with the condition — such as growth problems — and researchers are constantly looking into new forms of treatment.<br>  <br>  Growth hormone treatment can improve growth and influence a girl's final adult height. In fact, in many cases, the treatment can help many girls with Turner syndrome reach a final height in the average range, especially if treatment is started early enough in childhood.<br>  <br>  Another treatment for Turner syndrome is estrogen replacement, which helps the girl develop the physical changes of puberty, including breast development and menstrual periods. This treatment is often started when a girl reaches about age 12 or 13.<br>  <br>  And a technique called in vitro fertilization can make it possible for some women with Turner syndrome to become pregnant. A donor egg can be used to create an embryo, which is then put into the uterus (womb) of the woman with Turner syndrome. With proper supportive care, the woman can carry the pregnancy to term and deliver a baby through the normal birth process.<br>  <br>  Living With Turner Syndrome<br>  Although people with Turner syndrome may have ce|`|Q1SABrSXaa	my daughter (12)has Turner Syndrome (TS) she was diagnosed at birth due to <br>  low birth weight<br>  swollen feet,legs and hands (edema)<br>  a high arched pallet<br>  a blood test confirmed it.<br>  she started growth hormone treatment aged 4yrs as she was very tiny for her age.<br>  started on oxandralone(anabolic steroid) aged 8 to boost the growth a bit.<br>  aged 11 she started on estrogen treatment , which is in the form of an HRT patch. she's been on this treatment for 11 months now and has had a huge growth spurt and it's started puberty (which won't happen without treatment in most cases)<br>  she's 12yr old now and when measured last (5 months ago) was just 4ft 3" and that was with a good growth spurt<br>  she's in mainstream senior school and doing well, she has some slight problems in maths, writing, organisation skills and spacial awareness, but in the main is the same as her peers.<br>  she see's her TS specialist every 6 months to check height,weight,and development, she also see's a dermatologist as she has developed alopicia areata which "may" or may not be linked to her TS.. she also see's an orthodontist as she has teeth and jaw problems that are linked to TS.<br>  her screening was a simple blood test at birth that looked at her chromosomes.<br>  other screening she's had was a heart and kidney scan at 3 weeks (both normal) and every year she is tested for liver function, thyroid function, cholesterol levels, a diabetic screening, kidney function, a test to see how much growth hormone she has in her body.. all that is done by blood so only 1 test. so not too invasive. Her BP used to be checked annually but now it's every 6 months at hospital and once per yr at out GP's as she is on the HRT... She will have another heart scan at 18 even if she shows no problems then scans ever 3-5yrs to catch early any problems  that may happen.<br>  soon she will also have progesterone added to the estrogen which will give her a monthly bleed that otherwise she'd not get. also it makes her feel "normal" and keeps her womb healthy.<br>  she will always be having some sort of hospital tests and will need medication most if not all of her life, She will also need screening for the rest of her life.<br>  all being well she will leave school, go onto further education and get a job, she plans on being a nurse or a gym teacher and i don't doubt that she will do what she wants..<br>  she knows that for her babies are not straightforward like it is for other females, she knows a little about IVF and egg donation (which is what she'll need) but she also has said she'd like to adopt..to me it shows she is quite mature for her age.<br>  to me she's just a normal little girl just we go about things in a different way

These infections effects your health because if gets into your blood stream to your heart. If extracted, your other teeth will begin to move causing your bite to be off making jaw pain (very painful) and missing teeth makes it harder for you to eat and effects your smile.

9edc5077057569352822a821adc48204aa	I work in a psychiatric hospital.  Here's what happens.<br>  <br>  Call the admissions office of the hospital you are considering and ask your questions.  Before admission they'll have to contact your insurance company to get preauthorization and that process takes hours.  The insurance company will want some very detailed information, so a preadmission interview at the hospital is usually required.  So bring a book or magazine or something to keep you busy.  Yes, I know you're probably having a hard time concentrating right now, so make it simple.  But be prepared to wait.<br>  <br>  A lot of people expect that in a hospital you get a lot of one-on-one therapy but that's usually not the case.  While you will get some one-on-one time, most of the therapy is done in groups, so if you want to get something out of the experience, be prepared to talk about what's going on in your groups.<br>  <br>  The psychiatrist visits will usually be about 15 minutes in length and you'll mostly be talking about your medication.<br>  <br>  Once you start to get better you'll go to outpatient care.  Outpatient psychotherapy sessions are usually where you'll be working on your problems over the long term.<br>  <br>  The hospital will keep you safe, offer you some education about your problems, and get you started on some new medications.  It can also provide psychotherapy but only if you are willing to engage in group therapy.  If you are unwilling to talk about your problems in group, you won't have a very good therapy experiene in the inpatient program.<br>  <br>  P.S.  If you are a female and you are considering bringing stuffed animals with you to the hospital, DON'T DO IT as it's often a sign of immaturity and staff will get a bad impression of you because of that.  This doesn't apply if you are a kid, of course, but if you are an adult, it will not lead to staff wanting to invest time in you.|`|TDTz4bAhaa	A qualified mental health professional has to admit you.

Depending on the hospital they do that because bed space is limited and they like to keep it open for the most sever cases.<br>  <br>  It's best to call in so they can be ready to talk to you.<br>  <br>  <br>  The first time I went I was so doped up it felt like I was forgetting who and where I was and I didn't give a crap about anything, mostly it's boring though. Didn't really get to talk to the psychologist much and not much to do expect groups and sleeping.  Some of the nurses asked how I was, but I felt like going there didn't help because the doctor really doesn't talk to you much and mostly your by yourself or with others who are staying there.<br>  <br>  The second time I went, different hospital, same thing but some of the nurses were pretty rude and mean, again I felt like it wasn't helping and I started feeling worse being there and started to try to cut myself with a plastic knife I hid in my room.   I felt more depressed being there and even thought of escaping.<br>  <br>  <br>  To me it was pointless because I feel like it didn't help much, but maybe you have a better hospital where you are so it could be different.|`|UIpobEThaa	It might work differently at different places or states.

Is it that you are just talking to yourself in your mind or that you actually hear a voice that no one else hears that is not your own thoughts. Is it bad? No, while it is not common to hear voices that doesn't mean that you are any less of a person; what it does mean though is that you have a condition that needs to be looked after by a medical professional. You should think too, is this constant all the time, only when stressful things occur in your life, when you are scared, etc. It might be a good idea to keep a private journal and keep up with when and what you are hearing, so that when you do talk to someone for medical advice you can be more specific. You need to talk to someone about this don't just try to ignore it. Seek medical advice; you can do this privately if you are embarrassed.

Everyone, whether they're conscious of it or not, hear voices in their head, at least once a day, if not more. <br>  <br>  Right now, as I'm typing, I'm reading the words in my head, making sure I'm not making any mistakes, so on and so forth. Or, you may be thinking quietly to yourself when you're out, remembering things - or unconsciously commenting on your daily life.<br>  <br>  However, if there's another voice in your head, telling you there's something wrong with you, or you should kill someone, or steal something - then it might be considered 'bad'. Still, it's curable. If it really bothers you, then you may want to talk to a psychiatrist, or someone who had/has a similar problem. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps!!|`|qbZKBSFHaa	I don't think it's bad to hear voices in your head, but it's important to notice if you have a problem and seek help as soon as possible.  <br>   <br>  Those voices can become delusions and you may lose touch with reality and possibly endanger yourself and others if you have a problem and don't manage it. <br>  <br>  My mother used to hear voices in her head and had hallicinations on a regular basis. She was diagnosed with Paranoid Schizophrenia at the age of 37 and was prescribed haloperidol and other antisphycotic medications to keep it under control. The disorder is not curable and for my mom, it became worse as she encountered stressful times in her life and skip dosages on occasions. She was a great mom and wife, just needed a lot of extra care during difficult times, especially when she fell victim to the voices in her head.   <br>  <br>  I never considered her hearing voices a bad thing at all.  My mom had a great personality, she loved her family, and functioned like a normal person.  She would always tell me that the voices told her to do things, things about people, and I have to be honest with you, they were usually right about somethings! She would meet people and on first contact, she would look through their souls and the voices would tell her if they had good intentions or not, something like that. It made for great conversation :) God rest her soul, she died 3 years ago in her sleep.  I really miss her.  <br>  <br>  I hope you find peace with the voices in your head and pray that you have family and friends to gather around and support you.  <br>  <br>  God Bless.|`|8Ic3r9i8aa	well depends, <br>  are they telling you to kill someone?<br>  im not making any bad accusations against you but, try to get medicine or even admit yourself to a hospital before it gets too far. it is normal to hear voices in your head, but it isnt to hear hurtful/bad/suicidal voices.<br>  I suggest help immediately before it gets elevated to another level.|`|zFZ2EAsmaa	...its not ALWAYS a bad thing..<br>  but you might want to think about talking to a therapist... not to be mean.|`|kT2dQhfNaa	Well, I hear voices too and it sounds like I'm in the same situation you're in because the voices aren't mean to me and they can be helpful, but I am kind of worried about my, uh, sanity.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I know I'm not much help, but I've been googling it and by the sound of it hearing voices is ok as long as it doesn't negatively affect your life.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|lGSbjuIuaa	schizophrenia.|`|SaAQZiG4aa	i am a restech and a mental health facility and there nothing wrong with hearing voices its called schizophrenia and there are meds that can help you deal with it but people can live a very healthy and long life with this and there is nothin wrong with this disorder its more common then alot of people beleive good luck|`|ExaRyk8Uaa	um. yeah.|`|hW9Kv59Iaa	Yeah, that scares me.|`|NbmnWwqEaa	If they say bad things . . . it is bad.<br>  If they ask you do do things . . . it may be bad.<br>  If they are similar to your own thoughts . . . it may be divine guidance; you could be a psychic or you may be channeling spirits.<br>  <br>  Or it could be mental illness . . . <br>  How often? Write down what they say . . . and see if it's true or dangerous. If it is saying "You are safe. I am with you." It could be messages from Heaven ... a Guardian Angel.|`|xFbntCMNaa	well talk to a parent or counsolour. its common just as long as you dont do what they tell you too. just relax and DONt keep it to yourself. dont ignore it and not tell anyone. dont be afraid remember they wont think your crazy if you go talk to them. the WILL think your crazy if your killing people and you think its ok.

Sorry. I just read that it could also be your Spirit Guide, or a passed family member. I guess it may depend on what they are saying to you to determine if its bad. It may be Scitzophernia.|`|Mr8YpNOSaa	erm, generally voices in your head is a BAD thing...|`|G2QNC22eaa	it depends if its your own voice asking your self a question if its not your mind answering something you want to know then that's a bad thing <br>  <br>  <br>  ANSWER MINE PLEASE :)<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Au4zw7C9Rf1oXoqbBSLpcajsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220112028AAIkSO2">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|kANR98tIaa	yeah its bad, but is it your thoughts?|`|MA8AUiQYaa	the same thing happened to my friend lol nothing bad happened and i don't thinks its bad maybe you just need to talk to someone or you just have something on your mind!

It shows you are in touch spiritually but if they are crowding out your clarity it can mean you need to clean up your life. You might need to take better care of yourself on all levels. If you are really healthy then sitting & asking the voices for their message & keeping a journal could be very helpful.|`|8dba39f4036fb9d63e8a6e57495dcb19aa	It's not good.|`|8SKpsVG7aa	no I hear voices to and nothings wrong with me|`|SiPGcBnYaa	a little bit yeah|`|1oBilGHuaa	If the voices are preventing you from carrying out your daily activities, it's not good.

It's a sign of schitzophrenia (how ever you spell it). You need to talk to a psychiatrist. What kind of things do they tell you?|`|WfwlGbUAaa	No. It's normal, it can be because of stress, so is talking to yourself.|`|wPD3BGEHaa	Well I guess it would depend on the answers the voice are giving you...if they say to kill someone then stick a q-tip in your ear to quiet them, if they say lets go get Ice Cream..then by all means honey listen to them..lol|`|e6939e2c550152ccd357282adb355721aa	You have obvious psychoses.

In fact, many of those affected describe their voices as being a positive influence in their lives, comforting or inspiring them as they go about their daily business. We're now keen to investigate why some people respond in this way while others are distressed and seek outside help.<br>  <br>  Although the voices heard by psychiatric patients and members of the general population seem to be of the same volume and frequency, the former group tend to interpret the voices as more distressing and negative.|`|ZaLrtSd7aa	Whether it's wrong or not, it needs work up. Voices are indeed a possible marker of schizophrenia. Another situation they can occur in is severe depression, chronic, or acute due to a traumatic event (e.g. close family member dying). It should be worked up by your doc or a psychiatrist - at this point this is likely out of the realm of just counselors.|`|6YbxTlDCaa	it depends on what they say...<br>  the good ones say "respect yourself"|`|SMVsmzi4aa	i hear voices in my head too, i sometimes even talk to walls, i personally think theres nothing wrong with me but idk. heres one of my questions =] <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AletF4HjOkBYhqhLbcZ_kGrsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220091533AAJmWQs">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|LVDV6PjKaa	Nope not at all...I hear them as well?|`|a4993452396339ce385ccb5fbed48e21aa	I don't know if it's bad but you definetly need checked by a good  Dr.|`|WXduJP08aa	yes you need to go see a doc or a phycologist because you could have paranoya scitsafrinc which is really bad you need to add more details and what all the voices say|`|L5I2tXvVaa	thats scary|`|GWECmJ46aa	it could be|`|jKDZlgMiaa	depends on what they're saying|`|sjkASt4Raa	i dont think its bad i hear them all the time some times their bad<br>  but i dont really listen to em.....  most real religious people think its bad cause they think its "satan"|`|hIzQyflqaa	yeah its not normal, what do they say?|`|2liGWU0kaa	could be.<br>  you should talk to a couselor about that...|`|hlE3nwyGaa	Yes, there is something physically wrong with your brain.

b46872233138995124ae9bf597a5667caa	While you can tire your eyes out from excessive computer usage, I highly doubt your "slowly going blind", also the computer isn't making your eyesight worse, that's just a myth.<br>  <br>  Take breaks from the computer ever so often, stare at something in the distance for a minute or so, give your eyes a chance to rest.  Also you may want to try artificial tears for the dryness, stay away from Visine and such as they can be irritating.  Refresh Plus is a good brand.  If you still feel the need, or your current glasses aren't as good, consider having your eyes checked by your eye doctor.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|0dd7cabdea5b9d991d838d3e770488a1aa	No, I don't think you are slowly going blind, but I do think another visit to the eye doctor is in order.  Dry eyes can be a problem, and there are auto-immune (body attacks itself) diseases that can cause the lacrimal (tear) glands to not produce enough - dry eyes can cause more eye problems, so you need to tell the eye doctor how dry your eyes are and tell him or her about the spots and floaters and how they have gotten worse over the years.<br>  Make sure you also mention your eye infection you had when you were little - perhaps this damaged your lacrimal glands?  I don't know, I'm not a doctor - I'm not even a nurse!  It just seems that you have an awful lot of dryness for a person your age.<br>  Make sure you see an Ophthalmologist, not an Optometrist.  An Ophthalmologist will be more likely to be able to help you with your dry eye problem.
Zt6eh6VRaa	You have run into one of the biggest problems of trying to have clear skin. Yes, products stop working because the skin has adapted to it and stops responding. Frustrating, I know. <br>  <br>  In our clinic, we change how our clients use their products about every two weeks in order to stay ahead of the skin's ability to adapt. That might mean using a product more frequently (like twice a day) or it might mean adding a new product into the homecare mix. It usually takes a mix of using an exfoliating serum along with benzoyl peroxide to get clear.<br>  <br>  There are also other factors that can exacerbate acne. If you want lists of foods and other lifestyle factors that can make your skin worse, go to the website below.<br>  <br>  If you would like to know more about our long distance client program go to this link:  <a href="http://www.facerealityacneclinic.com/longdistanceclients.html." rel="nofollow">http://www.facerealityacneclinic.com/lon...</a> <br>  <br>  If you become a client, we work closely with you one-on-one with acne experts to help you get your skin clear.

u4LLFhORaa	as long as you watch your sugar intact why not|`|Dx6dsQx1aa	Sure, just make sure not to fall into the common WW trap of eating too many high-carb, low-fat foods like crackers or those 100-calorie snack packs.  They have a "core" plan that focuses more on lean meats and veggies, and that's ideal for diabetics.|`|8OqdoIHtaa	Yes, but you still need to watch your carb intake.<br>  Talk to your doctor about it, or better still, talk to a dietitian who specializes in diabetes.|`|DGPUdOOjaa	Yes they definitely CAN. I have diabetes and I'm trying to lose weight the right way and I know it can be done. With input from a doctor and the help and support of a diabetic group you can lose the weight.|`|ohl9XRYzaa	Yes you can. I know several people who are diabetic and lost weight this way. They followed the diet and counted their carbs and did just fine.|`|na2axA4taa	i would speak to your doctor not anyone on here when it come to your health as there are horrible people who give inaccurate answers<br>  hope my answer helped and have a nice day x
RvddYKqjaa	Wear a tampon. I can't believe how many young people think you can't wear a tampon to bed. It's perfectly safe and perfectly normal to do it. Toxic Shock doesn't come from wearing a tampon at night. It comes from not removing it for long periods of time. Unless you sleep for a day or two at a time, it will not be a problem.   EDIT: <br>  Do you realize that you have only about 3 Tablespoons of blood with your period? That's not much of a gush. With mucus and tissue it is a total of no more than 9 Tablespoons. Put 9 Tbsp. of water in a cup and see how little that really is.|`|ziVtTtObaa	the blood is pooling in your uterus as you sleep. when you are up right it comes out. Wear a pad on tampon to bed. Or even both, so when you get up you will not be messy. this is very normal...|`|xFv6LirIaa	Either get on birth control pills to regulate your period or wear a maxi pad that is for a very heavy flow at night.|`|cvjPQ9tTaa	I had that problem but that was until I started to get up in the middle of the night and went and then again in the morning, and it sorted the problem..well didn't make it as bad.  <br>  (I know its a pain to get up in the middle of the night though)|`|SnTBokvyaa	Wear a pad to sleep!<br>  <br>  I just dont think that you should wear a tampon to sleep considering it would be in there for a looong time and increase your chances or TSS (toxic shock syndrome)... which is not cool...<br>  <br>  stick with the pad =]|`|ERxADoBAaa	Yup..gravity is a bee-otch. You can't prevent it but lessen the mess by wearing a tampon and a pad to bed.|`|bmWKETgWaa	Evidently your menstrual fluid is pooling within your vagina while you're lying flat.  This is normal and there's no way to prevent it.  You could wear a high-absorbency tampon at night, even set your alarm so you can get up and change it halfway through the night.  Or you could have a pad handy on your night stand and put it in place before you even get up.|`|ddkVFlojaa	The reason for this is basically that when you sleep your laying down, so all the blood comes out, but it doesnt rush down like suring the day, so once you stand up it comes running down. This sometimes happens to me, try putting on double pads,or keep a special towel for when you stand up. NO TAMPONS AT NIGHT!|`|NS6PJlDraa	not too much because when ur sleeping ur laying horizontally and when u stand up all the blood thats been sitting in there comes out all at once   this used to happen to me all the time because i wore pads to bed but my period got lighter with my nuva ring so i wear tampons all the time|`|08RugVdtaa	It's called "gravity".Think about it when you're laying down not much is going to show up on the pad or whatever you use and of course when you stand up it is going to come down.Make any sense?|`|VGhVdWVcaa	There is really no way to prevent this. Naturally, sitting or laying down will cause the amount of blood to decrease. The best way to keep the mess away is to wear a overnight pad.|`|e2B2H8Cpaa	Your blood pools overnight so when you stand vertical there is a rush.  Nothing to worry about though just a dash to the loo|`|geUh9V64aa	Wear pull ups to bed|`|fQVM8OHmaa	Wear a pad to bed.|`|Yi9CusAsaa	I have this same problem... I'm 21 and its happened since I was 13 lol... Truth be told being on birthcontrol will lighten up your period so the gushing isn't as bad in the morning however it'll still happen... and I've learned that if I wear a overnight pad (always makes awesome ones) to bed and then sit up slowly and kinda let whats been pooling come out slower, I don't end up running to the bathroom and have it running down my legs or something nasty... prevents stains too lol... just trust me... sit up SLOWLY and wait a couple mins before you get outta bed and you'll be FINE!=]|`|BeWOV1vSaa	Maybe you should go visit your doctor, i don't think there's anything wrong. I just think maybe when your laying down the blood just sits there that's why it may seem as if you bleed less but when you get up all the blood that was sitting inside of you is now being let out. The only thing i would suggest is to use a heavier pad.|`|0n1FZPHGaa	This will sound really pervy from myself being male, but see me as a doctor.<br>  <br>  Wearing tampons or sanitary towels can help.<br>  <br>  The brand: "Always" make over-night towels for your periods.<br>  Making sure that you have a happy one.<br>  <br>  Bleeding is a good sign, I don't know really if it matters when or where you start to bleed, because I was taught as long as it's bleeding, it's fine.|`|tUsWZGWsaa	The reason this is happening is because there is nowhere for the blood to go when you are lying down, so when you get up, it all gushes out. If you can predict when your period is going to happen , wear a pad or tampon to bed, but if you can't, I guess you'll just have to sacrifice the knickers and leg it to the bathroom!|`|eINo6GPoaa	Well if you are wearing a pad you could wear 2 at a time. This happens because you are laying down and your not up. When you get up it all comes out. If you wear a tampon then wear a pad. I have never had a tampon. So ya.. I have heavy periods and they are torture. I know what you go thru.|`|y7ws0PDIaa	it might be how ur sleeping, try using an night time pad if you dont already. but for all girls there are different times they bleed more so dont worry just try to remember to get up at night if you can and get a clean pad. :) hope i helped|`|Hj3fPypGaa	You should definitely wear a pad, it's not good to wear tampons all the time because the blood is meant to flow so just wear tampons during the day and pads at night.|`|LXgpTj65aa	wear a night/maxi pad.  They are designed to gather heavy amounts of blood because you aren't suppose to change your pads over night.|`|aee0aMUdaa	yeah it seems like when you sleep hardly any blood comes out but when you go to the bathroom its like all hanging in there lol. i dont know but this is normal|`|003f0f094c2f0cb577473885f7bbce23aa	use pads that are made especially for using at night! my mom has them and i kinda took some lol cuz they really work and are thicker to absorb more.|`|zIma8YWYaa	When you sleep you flat, so the blodd sits there then once you stand its bursts out|`|dfbc3f35da98132143b605b02d89e5b9aa	get a better absorbency tampon. I'm a guy but I would assume this would be a fix? It doesn't gross me out at all. never has idk why|`|CpevWaQ7aa	Just wear a higher absorbing pad.|`|oCG2xEEraa	thats exacly wut happens to me.<br>  u cant do much about it.<br>  but its normalll.:D
AA10350894	Him being drunk is no excuse for his boarish behavior, in fact it just makes it worse!<br>  Firstly, I recommend that you steer well clear of this guy and tell your fiends about what happened so they can keep an eye on you when he is around.<br>  Secondly, if he continues with this behavior, especially at school or school functions, you need to tell a teacher, councilor or principle about it, and tell his coach as well, so they can nip this in the bud! Otherwise it very well could escalate. And you certainly don't want that!<br>  Lastly, and most importantly, tell your parents! It is almost a certainty that they will put an end to it! Plus, if something should happen (God forbid), some one will need to know who may be the one who did it!<br>  Abuser often threaten their victims with more or increased violence if they tell some one as a means to control them. Don't give him that control over you! Once he has it he will try to expand upon it!<br>  <br>  <br>  BTW, it doesn't matter how big he is or how small you are, a firmly planted shoe in his crotch will floor him! If need be... GIVE HIM THE SHOE!!!|`|SltEwVX7aa	I normally would never tell anyone this, but in your case, it'll send the message loud and clear.<br>  <br>  If you're alone with him again and he starts this stuff, a quick knee between the legs will drive the "No" message home.  He'll get the hint.  And if that still doesn't work, talk to the police.  They'll get his attention for sure.|`|ShVxmkO8aa	Good question..........<br>  <br>  Tough one too.......<br>  <br>  Just keep doing what you are doing, and if he ever touches you again, report it to someone at your school...I think he can get arrested, or at least get a restraining order|`|Dv1UMYqUaa	man that got me hot|`|IK6MGTMAaa	I'm an older female.  I'm not sure what to tell him but you should try to have friends around you at night and do NOT go anywhere alone with this guy.  Men and boys will say any stupid thing to get you alone and then they will say that you must have known what they really meant.  You have to be the one to not leave yourself vulnerable to such a person be-cause they are stronger than you.  And he should NOT be grabbing your private parts.  Try asking your mom and/or dad for advice on the opposite sex? Or a trusted adult?  I hope you get better advice than this but anyhow, be careful! I'm sorry 'bout what happened, that's scary and awful.<br>  P.S. You are smart not to drink. Trust me, you have plenty of time to drink. Also: get some pepper spray? (And learn how to use it, and take a self-defense course?)  If he's assaulting and frightening you, maybe you should tell him you'll report him to the police, or just tell the police (or some-one at school -- at least your cheerleading coach).|`|zzvDybEiaa	To his  type of personality, (very Narcissistic) He is unable to accept a hint. To him - No means Maybe, and Maybe means YES.<br>  He has to be told straight outright.<br>  <br>  The next time that you see him, ( have a friend with you for support and to witness) inform him that what he did was most inappropriate, and it had, better never happen again. and that you are not the least bit interested in him, Now or Ever.<br>  <br>  And turn around and walk away.|`|sMcAEPN0aa	i can understand what your tallking about.  i'm a 15 year old guy who can understand the jock likes girl thing, even though i'm not totally a jock.  right now, i think you should talk to him one on one about how you feel about him grabbing your butt and touching your boobs, etc.  You can tell him nicely that you're not interested, but also afraid of what he means that he will do it again.  If he doesn't stop, i would ask an administrator for help.  But if you ask to talk to him, and don't back down, he probably will listen. Hope this helps! :D
c3a1a57ab0707d2296e8aa9f6bd4dc91aa	You will be okay.  Maybe there is something deep down inside of you that has caused you to react the way that you do. Try to remember the positive things in your life. Find things to do that make you happy.  You're just growing up. hugs|`|jlZZbdIjaa	Hahaha srry but i couldn't help it....ok umm just try not to cry a lot think about happy stuff!=) there's nothing wrong with crying...it's actually good but just try not to do it so much. Think about what makes you cry, and think about what makes you happy...replace the sadness with happiness!!!!!!!|`|0unqJPehaa	Your just more sensitive than most guys which is good, more guys need to be sensitive instead of stuck up jerks.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also, ignore LOVE, you have a right to cry, crying isn't a male or female thing, no matter how much you cry.|`|5c6F8ogkaa	maybe ur just a sensitive guy? nothing wrong with that. also ur probly still goin through puberty so ur emotions are gonna be everywhere atm. no worries dude, nothing to cry about|`|YL5ziuTRaa	I cry too alot. I guess we're both sensitive. Well to stop crying you could just think when your about to cry that 'your strong, don't cry'<br>  <br>  this is just a suggestion|`|iHKwtMUoaa	i do it nd all no need to worry your not alone|`|kfWi9ZkEaa	I have a daughter like this: she purges every last piece of emotion, and is left with nothing to grow from. To find a way to refuse to cry (only in public, go for your life in private obviously) forces the pot to, well, stretch a bit, which will allow you a little more room in future and you will not find yourself embarrassed so often.  <br>  <br>  It sucks that you have an older brother who gives you sxxt: he will have gone through the crying phase of the game himself but not noticed.  Having said this, my son knows a kid at boarding school who is always, always crying and I think this causes the boys to treat him rather badly.  The aim is of course to toughen him up as his crying embarrasses the hell out of them and they never see it coming.  This kid cries when the other boys are actually just joking - so they start to get a bit mean with it because they're so annoyed.<br>  <br>  You are absorbing what your brother does nad not fighting back: and the problem with this is that to absorb, and absorb, and absorb leaves you with no resilience.  You need to stop absorbing, you need to find a way to send it back.  Either your bro is joking, in which case laugh at his joke, or he's trying to hurt you, in which case laugh at his joke.  Don't let yourself get so screwed up you can't speak.  Plan this out in advance.  Don't get snotty, they can attack snotty easily.  Just tell him he obviously has a secret crush on you, and he should just come out and say it, it's okay to be gay, ra ra.  Come on, play the game.  It's fun!  It's a bit like tennis:  slam the ball right back and learn that this isn't nasty, it only turns nasty when someone throws themself on the ground and tattoos 'kick me' on their forehead like you're doing.  You may one day have to smack your brother one in the chops to make him take you seriously of course: but what the heck.  Pain is just pain.  Crying is from (a) hormones and (b) injustice.  You can't do much about the hormones although that's usually around 13-15, you certainly can do something about injustice.  Esp as you're doing about 68% of this to yourself!  Relax!  Have some fun!  Learn to joke and this will turn into a good thing.  EG:  my brother and i used to compete to call each other the foulest, nastiest name we could.  Neither of us got 'hurt' for pete's sake.  We inevitably ended up killing ourselves laughing.  it's not what's said, it's why its said that makes an emotional impact.  <br>  <br>  And who are you to know your brother's motivation?

dUj7rP2haa	Skipping solid food all morning could be a big mistake.  It's much better to spread your calories over the whole day.  If you can't manage a breakfast right when you wake up then you might want to bring a small snack to school that you can fit in between classes (apple slices, a small granola bar, a hard boiled egg, a low fat yogurt or even a handful of nuts if they are allowed in your school).  <br>  <br>  Don't think of carbs as a bad thing.  They can be really helpful in loosing weight... they fill you up.  Just stick to small servings of whole grains.  Home made vegetable soup can make a great lunch.<br>  <br>  Avoiding chips and sweets will be a good idea, but if you find that really hard you may want to make room in your life for small treats rather then occasionally going completely off the rails with a big binge. For example, a lollipop only has 40 or so calories... if one of those will satisfy your sweet tooth you're better off having one a day then a big bag of chocolate once a week.<br>  <br>  You'd be better off going for a fast paced walk for 20 min then using an exercise bike.  Save the bike for days when it's raining.|`|4f46a3ab367e69b76b30e6290112ed68aa	Sweetie, that diet is starving yourself. You need a minimum of 1500 calories and your choices add up to about 675 depending on dinner. Take your lunch if nothing is healthy at school. Add that salad with some chicken and fruit from your snack and then do it again when you get home. Have another lean protein and some type of veggies and fruit again at dinner. Oh, and try to do a fruit smoothie or something for breakfast. A better calorie count and still not that heavy first thing in the morning.|`|hUfgIX3eaa	Look up your Resting Metabolic Rate, there are free calculators online.  Your RMR is the amount of calories you would burn if you just laid in bed all day.  It is the amount of calories you need to survive!  Eating less than that amount will cause your body to shut down your metabolism because it will think you are starving.  Eat your calories in fruits, veggies, low fat dairy, whole grain, high fiber, and lots of water.  Avoid pre-packaged foods like cookies, crackers, chips, soda and diet soda, etc.  Start with the exercise you have planned and try to work up to more time on the stationary bike gradually.|`|n4uffXEtaa	It sounds really good. And curl ups will help u alot in your stomach. Squats will work well 2. But, i suggest to eat something solid for breakfasts instead of eating lunch. I know, i know, i get sick eating breakfast to, but it increases your metabolism rate, it's healthy, and when u were sleeping, you fasted for like 10-12 hours. So, breakfast is really important. Thats really all i got to say, trust me it works, and u will get used 2 eating breakfast, soon enough it will be a routine. Oh yeah, and about ur sweet tooth, sugarless gum can really fill u up, and hot chocolate is good to. on ur diet, u have 2 give ur body what it wants, meaning give it something sweet, or u might not be able to stick to ur diet so long. No worry, u can still have something sweet, it matters OF HOW MUCH U EAT OF IT. hope this helps:)|`|TrvFnYnmaa	I've been using Acai Berry for a while now and so far I've seen some great results.

YOu need to Eat to lose weight ya know. If you do what your planning to you wont lose anything.<br>  <br>  for lunch why odnt you eat a sandwich with carrots or somethin like that? <br>  <br>  if your going to snack when u get home, dont use mayo, cheese, or any other fatty things. just use slice of ham. lettuce tomato if you have it. mustard. <br>  <br>  for dinner add veggies in. im sure your parents will buy some if you ask. Eat a portion.<br>  <br>  You have to eat though. Dont do what your planning or you wont lose anything. i cant stress that enough.<br>  <br>  Your exercise is fine for now. But you need to work yourself to an hour of exercise a day 5 times a week. So like at the end of the month, try to be doing 1 hour 5 times a week,|`|S7Q3fRvoaa	Honestly, this doesnt sound like the best diet... you are not eating enough!  The key to losing weight is portion control and the types of foods you eat!  Here is a little crash course:<br>  <br>  Each day, you need to be eating a balance from all the food groups. This includes plenty of fresh fruit and veggies, which are low-cal and very filling, not to mention good for you.  You should not cut out carbs... that is a myth.  Your body uses carbohydrates for energy.  Just try to make half your servings of grain whole wheat.  Lean proteins are also very important.  Things like chicken breast, beans, tuna, and cottage cheese.  You also need dairy, which provides calcium (important for strong bones so u dont have osteoporosis later in life)  Choose 2% or skim milk and yogurts. <br>  <br>  It would be wise for you to cut out chips and soda... dont even drink diet soda.  Wean yourself off slowly so its not overwhelming.  Instead of sodas, drink water or milk.<br>  <br>  As for portion sizes, pay attention to the serving sizes on containers and stuff.  You could also find some stuff on google.<br>  <br>  But diet is only half, you must exercise too.  You exercise plan sounds good, you just need to stick to it!  If you have to, set up small rewards (new pair of shoes, go see a movie, etc) for sticking to it.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!!!
zIaXUWgEaa	If the pop is in your knee then it is fluid in your knee that is popping. It's perfectly normal and nothing to worry about.<br>  <br>  If it is elsewhere in your leg then it isn't normal and you should see your doctor.
tVF9O1Olaa	I am not to sure but i have been signed off by my doctor for mental health issues and what i think happens is you have to be signed off continuously for 28 weeks to go on to benefits, i am not sure if this true. I was off for 13 weeks and i got sick pay as i had sick note but didn't get disability benefits.<br>  <br>  <br>  Why has the doctor signed him off sick if he hasn't got a job? I think the best thing you can do is speak to someone at your local job centre who can tell him what he can apply for, he will get job seekers allowance but not sure about incapacity/disability benefits. Or look at the job centres website and it tells you on there the different things you can apply for.|`|9edc5077057569352822a821adc48204aa	Specify what type of benefit you are referring to; your question is so general it's impossible to answer.<br>  <br>  Is it sick leave at work, or some type of disability or ???<br>  <br>  It's not even clear if you are referring to a sick note for school or a sick note for work.|`|d162f121edc74fbff5dcd0d3373d75e6aa	I believe Incapacity benefit is paid after sick pay ends, after 28 weeks.<br>  Check website for eligibility details.<br>  Good luck.
VV7bpOXuaa	I had that earlier! It happens quite often for me if I suck in my stomach, or just somehow strain a muscle. I got it earlier from slouching while I was eating and laughing at the same time! LOL. Not recommended. <br>  Don't worry, it will definately go in time :)<br>  And if it doesn't go by about 3 days, just go to see a doctor.<br>  You can also get pains like that if you have acid reflux syndrome (oesophagitus). Which is nothing bad, just a build up of stomach acid which causes pain (mainly a pain in the stomach muscles). Many people suffer from it, it just requires medication to get rid of it :) And I doubt it is appendicitus!<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|6ef0e0ba6af3df8415ccaf3351847985aa	you can have a strained muscle from sucking in your stomach. if you eat then its not your appendix. because you wouldn't be hungry.|`|orTsZkNnaa	you proble stared your piroed
UZJ7wVc8aa	You can get abs but you can't really do anything to make yourself grow taller. You're still very young, you probably have a lot of vertical growth to go.<br>  <br>  Getting a nice set of abs is such a misunderstood process. It's actually a lot easier than most people think which is why most people are in a never ending quest to get that perfect six pack - it's because they're doing all the wrong things.<br>  <br>  When you eat more calories than you burn, your body takes those extra calories and stores them as fat somewhere on your body. For some people, the #1 fat storage area is around the thighs and for others it might be around the stomach - it differs from person to person. Sometimes the fat is perfectly distributed around the body so it's not as big of a concern. <br>  <br>  If an excessive amount of fat is stored around your stomach, the reason that you're not seeing your abs is because your body fat percentage is too high. What you need to do is create a calorie deficit (take in less calories than you burn) so that your body is forced to use its fat stores for energy. After a few weeks of doing this, you'll notice that your abs will start to show.<br>  <br>  You first step is to figure out how many calories you burn each day. Use this calculator <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a> for an estimate. Now you need to increase the amount of calories you burn by exercising more and decreasing the amount of calories you eat. Cut out junk food such as fast food, candy and sugar. Eat foods that are high in fiber: bread and pasta made from 100% whole wheat, brown rice, oats, fruits and vegetables.<br>  <br>  You shouldn't ignore targeting your abs with sit ups, leg raises and twists but doing hundreds of sit ups won't do anything about the layer of fat that is covering them. Cardio and calorie restriction should be your main focus.

Just get the tests run and go from there.|`|0mpeDMxwaa	If you just said armpit, I would not be worried at all.

Although it was already said, I do realize some of the meals are high in sodium, so I look out for the sodium under the nutritional information.  I don't think they are bad for you, if you eat them a few times a week, but I also cook a lot.  A lot of people of Weight Watchers use them, too, I have noticed.

Do it several times before tomorrow and the last time you do it should be right before bed so you are the most relaxed when you fall asleep. Also get to bed early.

Doctors usually say give it an initial three months, then to talk with them about it.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)<br>  -MVP|`|z5hzyDZgaa	yes this is very normal, your boobs could possibly increase in size as well. there are many things that come along with taking a pill filled with hormones. you may get used to the mood switch eventually but basically as long as you take the pill you will have all of these symptoms... its really the sucky part about it, isnt it?|`|6f3f1840626b7f8f4152f15766378d79aa	Yes it is normal. It will just be water retention. You can get rid of excess water by actually drinking more water, and avoiding caffeine. <br>  <br>  If, after 3 months the side effects persist, ask to change your pill to one with a lower oestrogen amount, or a different progestogen. <br>  <br>  Yasmin contains a diuretic and so many women find they don't gain weight but lose some!|`|IGYa2yF6aa	Yes, this is normal. The hormones in the bc pills are strong and your body is getting used to them. You'll probably notice your breasts getting bigger, too. If you're really uncomfortable or if the symptoms continue for more than a couple of months, ask your doctor to change your prescription. Some women have to try several different kinds of birth control pills before they find the one that feels right.|`|CpevWaQ7aa	Its normal when you jsut start but it should clear up after the first few months.

Also, many large churches have Christian schools where you might get a job.|`|ParFJxnSaa	Ask yourself: "Why do I feel depressed, and when did I first start to feel this way: can I associate this with any recent change in my life?" (if so, it is probably reactive [situational] depression: counselling, such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy may be indicated, but most of life's adverse situations are resolved within 16 weeks, yet the medical criteria for depression, and the prescription of antidepressants is only 2 weeks!). Or, was it a more gradual thing, with no apparent cause? (a nutritional deficiency, hypothyroidism, environmental toxicity, or reactions to some medications, etc., becomes more likely as the cause). Antidepressants work quicker than the following; 2 - 6 weeks, but you may have to adjust dosage, or types. St. John's wort helps most people; tolerance doesn't develop, and the few side effects don't occur often, and even then are normally not severe (neither should be relied on as a sole treatment). <br>  <br>  It doesn't cause sleeping problems, or weight change, but usually takes at least 2, and generally 4 - 6 weeks to become effective, but can work quicker than antidepressants, sometimes. A recent, independent German double blind study showed it to be as effective as a commonly prescribed antidepressant, in cases of major depression, with far fewer side effects, and those were generally better tolerated, with a lower rate of discontinuation. Unlike antidepressants, where sexual dysfunction is a common side effect, it happens much more rarely with St. John's wort (I have noticed no effect in this area). A multidimensional approach to treating depression without medication follows. All except for no. (7.) are safe to use with medication, but not St. John's wort, because of interactions, and it's sensible to check out anything else first with your doctor. <br>  <br>  (1.) Take 4 Omega 3 fish oil supplements, daily: (certified free of mercury) it is best if consumed with an antioxidant, such as an orange, or grapefruit, or their FRESHLY SQUEEZED juice. If vitamin E is added, it should be certified as being 100% from natural sources, or it may be synthetic: avoid it. In the winter months, if not getting sufficient daily exposure to strong light, see <a href="http://www.mercola.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mercola.com/</a> SEARCHBAR: enter: "vitamin D3", & Go to a doctor and ask for a 25(OH)D, also called 25-hydroxyvitamin D, blood test. When you get the results, don’t follow the typical “normal” reference range, as these are too low. The OPTIMAL value that you’re looking for is 45-52 ng/ml (115-128 nmol/l)". The company which tests your levels has to be one of those using the correct form of test, and this topic is addressed via the searchbar at mercola.com - "vitamin D3; testing". Also take a vitamin B complex which is certified as being 100% of natural origin; a deficiency in vitamin B9 (folic acid, or folate) is known to cause depression. Around 30% - 40% of depressed people have low vitamin B12 levels. Depressed females using the contraceptive pill may benefit from vitamin B6 supplements. <br>  <br>  (2.) Work up slowly to at least 20 minutes minutes of exercise, daily, or 30 - 60 mns, 5 times weekly. Too much exercise can cause stress, which isn't wanted when dealing with depression. (3.) Occupational therapy (keeping busy allows little time for unproductive introspection, and keeps mental activity out of less desirable areas of the brain). (4.) Use daily, a relaxation method* and/or yoga*, and/or Tai Chi*.(5.) Initially, at least, some form of psychotherapy or counselling; later, perhaps either Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy, or Rational Emotive Behavio(u)ral Therapy for, say, 6 months. (6.) Maintain a mood chart, and daily activities schedule**.  (7.) As options, if desired, either a known, effective herbal remedy, such as St. John's wort, (get a German variety, if possible; local ones may vary in effectiveness. Perika, and Kira brands have been recommended as being effective. Take with a meal) or supplements, such as SAMe, or Inositol (from vitamin and health food stores, some supermarkets, or mail order: view section 55).|`|uSNn3iJDaa	Life isn't about waiting for the storm to pass its about learning to dance in the rain..<br>  <br>  Love that quote!

Depression my foot: you're MISERABLE.  Got it?<br>  <br>  You have to take medication for depression:  miserable is something you can do something about.  This is your first utter life lesson so learn it well.  There is no such thing as depression.  Say it ten times in a row: "I am not suffering some bullshit mental disorder that was only invented 100 years ago:  I AM MISERABLE BECAUSE MY LIFE IS CRAP."<br>  <br>  Got it?  It's like Alcoholics Anonymous: you have to name the true problem in order to even begin solving it.  Depression is insoluble so never ever name anything it unless you want it to stay that way!<br>  <br>  Now: get a humble job cleaning toilets/houses or whatever you have to do to earn a living:  and in the mean-time, you look around for teaching positions.  If there are none now, you go for teacher-aide positions.  Doorknock: go hang out at the local elementary school telling them how much you need a job, and is there anything you can do?  Covering books?  relief work?  Get on everyone's relief list. <br>  <br>  In short: get out there.  Cover your bases, get out there, don't get too excited because yes, it's a recession - but he who dares wins.  Stay away from greebly daycare: yuck.  What sentient being wants to do that?  But stocking shelves in Walmart is a far cry from sleeping in the streets: so do what you have to to survive, and bide your time.  This recession will probably only last 18 months.<br>  <br>  As to your boyfriend's family not inviting you to the wedding:  don't assume people are poking the borax at you when their reasons could be any number of other thigns.  They're dealing with the recession too, after all.  And girlfriends do not usually get invited to weddings: only fiancees and wives.  Okay?  you run the risk of becoming one of those insufferable self-pitiers if you steer yourself down that track so avoid even the tiniest whiff of it.  (that's a warning in advance, I'm not secretly accusing you of already being that.  I'm too old to play those sorts of games!)  <br>  <br>  Learn to stop saying 'why me?' and start saying "well, I suppose, why not me?"  It's not that one's special for attracting this kind of crap;  it's that one would have to be pretty special not to.  We all catch it because the people around us say and do ambiguous things all the time - as we do, too.  don't sweat these things and unless someone takes out a full page ad in the paper saying "we don't want you here" assume they have their own set of problems which is causing whatever you don't like.  This is a very, very good life lesson here:  think carefully about it because this is pure gold, and cost me a lot to learn it.  A sunny temperament is the best way to success:  but one has to be genuinely sunny, so one has to not malinger, one has to see the best in others and oneself until proven otherwise.  (I'm nto suggesting naivete - I'm suggesting operational naivete.)<br>  <br>  And finally: watch what your girlfriends/friends say.  Spin? do they ever!  If you have friends for whom everything goes right: that's what they're saying, it's not necessarily the whole story in fact it is NEVER the whole story.  Do not compare yourself to others because they're all marketing and networking like crazy, those who are riding the wave are not learning life lessons, those who are learning life lessons are not riding the wave.  Compare yourself to your friends at the end of your life, when the results of the methods are in.<br>  <br>  There you go, go get 'em, that's enough from me.  ;o)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :o)

I would try one thing at at time - for at least threed days to see how it helps, and then try the next one if you need...... if you take a lot of things at once you don't know what will help.<br>  <br>  First, if you stop taking the drugs, you may get withdrawal side effects, I've seen a lot of people go through this.  You can go onto supplements to stabilize and then taper off the drugs.   You can search for Ativan withdrawal, etc. and find some good natural supplement programs to help with this because often if you do have side effects they masquarade as return of symptoms.<br>  <br>  These drugs effect the hormonal system by unbalancing it and when you go off of them, it can really cause an unbalance.<br>  <br>  I would get a good whole food supplement to build you body up.  The best I know is www.realfoodnutrients.com/hb/home.htm.  I like these supplements.<br>  <br>  To help with anxiety, search for Tart Cherry capsules.   Find one that is flash pasteurized, it works great for anxiety.<br>  <br>  If you get depression while coming off the drugs, use Omega 3 Fish Oil.  These are essential fatty acids and you should actually take some now as these drugs will deplete the body.  <br>  <br>  I would get a good whole food vitamin B supplement as your body will need this too.|`|p0D4dxEqaa	Centrum is a good otc vitamin.<br>  <br>  Magnesium definciency has been linked to anxiety and panic syndromes.  <br>  <br>  our intake of magnesium is very deficient due to our soil being deficient in it now. <br>  <br>  250 mgs of  magesium a day couldn't hurt.  <br>  <br>  I am not a doctor and this is what I take, it relaxes me.

BOuPi3wDaa	You need to eat natural protein, like a peanut butter and jelly sandwhich within and hour after working out (don't eat too much though or you might get sick) and only weight lift every other day.  When you lift weights, you muscles actually break down and repair themselves to be stronger.  But if you do it every day, they'll never be able to strengthen and it's a waste of your hard work!

If she does not have any active lesions or symptoms it should be fine. Genital herpes can be spread whether that person is having an out break or not. It is a skin to skin (contact) infection. There is never a 100% guarentee whether you use condoms or not because condoms do not cover the whole genital region. Also if you are a girl you are more at risk then a male because our genitals cant be covered. You can get pregnant if you have herpes just as though you didnt even have it. And you can have a baby vaginally and not give it to your baby. Just as long as you are aware you are infected while your pregnant you can tell your doctor. millions of people have herpes and it has been very rare to give it to a infant. A blood test will tell you if you have herpes for sure. hope this helps

What I can tell you is that if you are unhappy with the answer you get from your doctor you should tell him/her that. A lot of people find it difficult to do this, but the reality is that you are paying for a service. If you find that your doctor is unwilling to listen then you always have the option of finding another one. It is a hard thing to do especially if you have had the same physician for a while, but not all change is bad especially when it concerns your health!

kxSr7oTdaa	Hi Lorenzo,    Be warned, the first day of this plan will be tough but if you stick with the strict fruit juice and yoghurt regime, it will kick start your detox. After that, the calorie intake for each day varies, from 800 calories on day 4, the special rice day, to 1300 calories on day 6. This carefully controlled low-fat, low-calorie diet will ensure you lose weight while the high concentration of fruit and veg will flood your system with vitamins and minerals. The result will be glowing skin and a lighter you!    The large quantity of fruit and veg needed could be expensive and some of the meals are time consuming to prepare. This diet is probably best done during a week when you're not working as you might get a headache due to the detoxification process.    If you think you can manage this process well enough, then try to follow the details as below :    Day 1: 600 calories  ----------------------------  This is a fasting day. Drink loads of water and herbal teas throughout the day. Breakfast, lunch and evening meal are the same: 1 glass of unsweetened fruit or salt-free vegetable juice plus a carton of natural live yoghurt.  Try to start this diet on a non-working, quiet day and don't worry, it does get easier!    Day 2: 1200 calories  -----------------------------  Breakfast:  This is the standard breakfast you'll eat for the rest of the week. 1 portion fresh fruit (vary throughout the week between apple, pear, mango, grapes, pineapple, grapefruit), 2 slices of wholemeal toast spread with low fat cottage cheese, a carton of low-fat live yoghurt, a small glass of skimmed milk and a cup of herb or weak Indian tea without milk or sugar.    Lunch:  1 kiwi fruit, a mixed raw vegetable salad (a bed of iceberg lettuce, filled with grated carrot, celeriac and beetroot, with a squeeze of lemon juice and a drizzle of olive oil) plus 150g (6oz) of any steamed vegetables, sprinkled with a chopped clove of garlic and a drizzle of olive oil. Herb or weak Indian tea.    Dinner:  50g (2 oz) blueberries and 100g (4oz) unsweetened muesli mixed with a tablespoon of orange juice and a carton of low fat live yoghurt. Herb or weak Indian tea.    Day 3: 1100 calories  ------------------------------  Breakfast:  As on day 2.    Lunch:  1 large mango, 150g (6 oz) mixed salad including watercress, fresh mint, spring onions, tomato, red and yellow peppers, chicory, baby spinach and beansprouts drizzled with a lemon juice and olive oil dressing.  1 large jacket potato with 50g (2oz) low-fat fromage frais whipped with chopped chives and a clove of garlic. Vegetable juice.    Dinner:  1 carton of low-fat live yoghurt mixed with blackberries, blueberries and 1tsp of honey. 1 crusty wholemeal roll with a matchbox size piece of soft cheese (brie, camembert, or similar). Herb or weak Indian tea.    Day 4: 800 calories  ----------------------------  This is a very special day where your main food will be rice. Start by preparing the rice for the whole day. You'll need 225g (9oz) dry brown rice cooked according to the packet's instructions. If you prefer, you can cook half the rice in water and the other half in vegetable stock for a more savoury flavour. Drink only water today.    Breakfast:  75g (3oz) cooked rice with 125g (5oz) stewed apple flavoured with honey, cinnamon and grated lemon rind.    Lunch:  75g (3oz) cooked rice with 175g (7oz) steamed vegetables - celery, leek, carrot, tomato, spinach, broccoli and shredded cabbage.    Dinner:  75g (3oz) cooked rice mixed with soaked dried apricots, raisins, sultanas, and the flesh of a pink grapefruit.    Day 5: 1100 calories  -----------------------------  Breakfast:  As on day 2.    Lunch:  1 apple, 1 pear, 150g (6oz) raw vegetable salad (cauliflower and broccoli florets, carrot, spring onion, grated red cabbage, mange tout) tossed in olive oil and cider vinegar dressing, sprinkled with a teaspoon of raisins and 3 chopped brazil nuts. Large jacket potato filled with 75g (3oz) steamed spinach chopped with 2 teaspoons of olive oil, clove of garlic and a generous grating of nutmeg. Herb or weak Indian tea.    Dinner:  75g (3oz) fromage frais mixed with 1 carton of low-fat live yoghurt, poured over a generous bowl of mixed fruit salad, including kiwi, pineapple, orange, grapes, blueberries, apple. Cup of herb tea.    Day 6: 1300 calories  ------------------------------  Breakfast:  As on day 2.    Lunch:  1 banana, 150g (6oz) mixed salad (shredded iceberg lettuce tomato, olives, red pepper, carrot, spring onions, cucumber, a clove of garlic, fennel and watercress) with a dressing of lemon juice, walnut oil and tarragon. 1 large jacket potato with 75g (3oz) steamed French or runner beans with a dessertspoon of sunflower oil sprinkled with finely chopped onions. Herb or weak Indian tea.    Dinner:  75g (3oz) muesli mixed with lemon juice, 1tsp honey, grated apple and 1 carton of low-fat live yoghurt. 1 slice wholemeal bread with a matchbox sized piece of brie, camembert or similar soft|`|u6fXoeNVaa	well detox never worked for me.|`|5c9KUHvCaa	Sounds good..

PrS7So5Yaa	One or two answers on Yahoo won't be much help, honestly, especially for overall health.    Start reading. Go to websites like WebMD, health magazine websites and wellness websites. Buy books (or get them from the library) and read everything you can get your hands on. Sign up for newsletters from websites on health and wellness. Most of mine are for women so they won't be much help to you. Go to men's magazine sites and sign up for newsletters for tips and info.    When it comes to physical health, just try to keep calories low, eat a balanced diet, and eat food as close to the earth as possible. The less processed the better. There are no special foods.

3834f6be064d0b2e2db8adc3264f234baa	Firstly..look at the diet pill..is it a diuretic or water pill.  This may cause you to lose water, but not inches.  Fat is lost in the reverse order that you gained it.  So if your muffin tops on your back end were their first..you will lose them last.    You cant direct where you lose fat, but you can direct or target areas to build muscle.  Building muscle will improve posture, compress your core and improve the energy burning capabilities of your body, thereby decreasing fat.    Also..be sure to have your hormones checked, thyroid and adrenal glands.  If these are not functioning properly, there is not much you would be able to do to lose weight until the problem is corrected.    I recommend building some muscle along with the diet pill to create a tighter form.|`|UbB5qnX9aa	i Would advise you to see a doctor|`|E3grj9bOaa	Ya don't loose pouns. Or you can't be loosing muscle.|`|WpgEqGrvaa	You could be loosing the internal fat that is surrounding your organs rather than the fat you see in your shape. You will eventually see a change.   I'm not sure that a diet pill would make you lose muscle but if your worried then see your doc.|`|RumoQkohaa	get off the diet pill now!....ok now that thats done, change your eating habits...forever...diet is short term were gonna change your life forever so get good foods, lots of veggies etc..  exercise 3 times a week for about 30-45 minutes.  drink lots of water and think long term, not short term because its easy to gain it all back
7nbqb4e2aa	Hmmmmm, time for fat people to lose weight... I am disgusted with the deep, ugly, "walking by burp" they always do. Makes me wonder how their wives/husbands can curl up next to them at night... Oh, I forgot, they're usually fat too.
1oWCTV1aaa	The key for losing weight is simple - consume less food and move more often - the difficulties appear when we in reality try to put that into practice! There are lots of stumbling blocks out there don't you think?! The only diet which really delivered for me is wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box below, they have a limited number of free trials in stock, it was featured in Reader's Digest and CNN. I melted away 30 pounds, it really does produce success!
700eb1d0a3c26ec1b6bc612bdaefe114aa	i guess eating healthier. cut back on fatty & sugary foods & especially soda. & eat more fruits & veggies. try to eliminate oil when possible. & go running & do cardio exercise that makes you sweat because that's how your body will burn fat. :)|`|QCTy1iaEaa	Most exercises won't do anything for the butt, you need to work very specific muscles. Also, you can have the strongest gluts in the world, but if they're hidden under a layer of fat (and cellulite), nobody will see them. So you need to get rid of fat too (which takes care of cellulite as well).    Cellulite is fat. Women typically have cellulite because as they gain weight, their fat cells swell but their connective tissue stays the same, causing a dimpling or cottage cheese look that we all hate!    Since cellulite is fat, the key to ridding yourself of it lies in reducing the size of your fat cells. This is best accomplished with a combination - a specific diet and effective exercise program. And, in case you didnt already know, body wraps, toning lotions, electrical muscle stimulation, herbal remedies and other quick fix solutions you see on TV and in magazines DO NOT WORK! Any effects are temporary, so save your money. Look for specific butt workout programs such as http://www.firmbuttexercises.com/workout and others.|`|yZqRYFsPaa	i want that!=)|`|VSadTGgUaa	omg butt fat is co0l! and thighs are great! but since you don't like em I'd suggest doing squats|`|60ApQsGOaa	you obviously hang around white boys. if you hang around black crowds, you'd come across individuals whod enjoy nothin but meat on their plate. Trust me i have a black boyfriend lol|`|jvLCHuqTaa	There are several great cellulite removal treatment therapies on the market today. The most common is mesotherapy. Mesotherapy involves injections of vitamins into the target area that helps break down the fat. Does it hurt? Everyones pain tolerance is different so it is difficult to say. Mesotherapy costs $250 - $600 per treatment and only a licensed professional will be able to tell you how many treatments youd need.    Lippodissolve is very similar to Mesotherapy but it uses a more concentrated solution of vitamins. It generally costs between $400-$1000, and only a licensed professional will be able to tell you how many treatments youd need.     Endermologie is a technique where rollers are applied to the target area to help smooth out the cellulite. Generally, endermologie is needed to be done twice a week to be affective. It generally costs between $50 - $70, and only a licensed professional will be able to tell you how many treatments youd need.    Velasmooth is a technique that combines Endermologie with radio frequency designed help speed up your metabolism to burn up the fat causing cellulite. Treatments generally costs between $250 - $400, and like the other treatments only a licensed professional will be able to tell you how many treatments youd need.|`|FJZsa32paa	Squats.  :)|`|q2Dle3hLaa	Cardio exercise is key to changing the size of your butt and thighs. Cardio includes exercises such as jogging, running, jump rope, climbing, jumping, cycling, kickboxing - anything that gets your heart pumping and increases heart rate.    The stepper is an effective way to lose thigh fat because it focuses on the butt muscles and because the gluteal muscle group is the largest muscle group in the body, more calories are burnt using this compared to the other cardo machines.    * For an even effective reduction of fat on your thighs, cut down on your carbs intake like potato, rice, grains, pasta. Use brown carbs instead like sweet potatoes, whole grain bread; increase your lean protein intake such as chicken, egg whites, cottage cheese, protein shakes etc.|`|XDhBclzlaa	Hi,    The most effective is to exercise thru jogging, squats and walking. This will firm the muscles in your thigh and butt area.     So, if you r thinking of doing exercise at home perhaps on the spot jogging and squats will suit you. Add some stretching routine to liven your activity...:o)    Alternatively, you could use the walking mill or running mill machine for better results. Swimming is also effective in toning up your legs and butt. Try it and good luck.

You'll be fine- drink water! DON"T STARVE YOURSELF! this will make you gain more weight because your body will go into starvation mode and store everything you eat as fat instead of metabolizing it|`|gg127tbjaa	The key for losing those unwanted pounds is not difficult - eat less food and workout more - the issues appear when we really try to put that into practice!

7beff2801682ee45b1c21db21b38fd27aa	Usually I'd speculate and do whatever I could to avoid seeking medical advice...but from what you describe, I'd suggest a chat with your doctor. The soreness could simply be from over exertion or a pulled muscle. The stomach problems however point to something potentially more serious.    I'd strongly suggest a trip to your doctor ASAP.
wRtzGgRxaa	There is no reason to have surgery for gynecomastia, as it is a very normal occurence during puberty in adolescent boys.  It subsides over time.
067fa6dfc93e782fff815f1abe45eebaaa	I would eat more for your breakfast. Its the most important meal of the day so don't worry about eating to much. Go with the whole banana and cup of soy-milk.  Depending on your time of dinner eat a snack after wards around 8. (if dinner is before 6:30)    Vitamins are GREAT in the long run and sometimes in the short run, but more importantly look at what you need, if you haven't had a problem with calcium or iron then your fine just taking a multivitamin.    Look to mix some stuff up, a equivalent to an apple is a pear. instead of salmon you can go with tuna, crab, tofu.   Have as many veggies as you want, watch what you dress them with!    You could gain alot more weight, and wouldn't have to worry.     After you workout, i want you eating a banana too!  Your on a great track, sounds like your takinggood care of yourself.|`|yn0FXozCaa	go to lifewithhealthandwealth.isagenix.com and isamovie.com watch that video then email me at kierra.poulos@gmail.com this stuff is all natural and helps you loose weight.|`|lzviKPJWaa	you are not eating enough
qSrfPxpwaa	You probably have an allergy to one of the preservatives or flavor enhancers... there's hundreds to choose from so it would be hard to know which one for sure.  They don't really care what additives they put in it, even the FDA approved ones aren't necessarily safe... and MSG is a common one which is poisonous but in almost all packaged foods these days. Some people have a very quick and very bad reaction to that.    Anyways, its not particularly nutritious, the packaging probably contains more vitamins. Its probably your body telling you not to miss treat it. Microwave food, and microwaves are an express ticket to your own funeral.|`|lzviKPJWaa	because ur body knows its not healthy food and its rejecting it.
PlxGpCPiaa	haha i exercise when ever i am in the mood like 1-5 times a week i do tons of crunches pushups and strechs then i ran on  the treadmill. THEN I i take my dogs for a 2 hour run ,  But i am really fit 150 and only 15% fat yea haha  I really can only do this because i dont have a job yet but idk in your case|`|7d9Njtitaa	ive been doing a kickboxing class once a week and running more than a mile everyday it has been really helpful my tummy is WAY firmer and i look leaner it is great and with a healthy diet and LOTS of water it should work great!!!
I0GqKJ0aaa	I had the same problem this winter and I just covered up as well. My main motivation is that when I'm older, it's gonna be a lot harder to look and be healthy so I might as well start now. I want to take care of my body and when I think about the gross things most people put into their bodies every day, it's overwhelming-most people have no idea what they're doing to themselves and their future health, so that's my main motivation. Also, every time I think about eating something bad, I look down at myself and think about the way I'll feel after eating it-how will this food, with no nutritional value, benefit me? I try to do some sort of work-out every day, whether it's running, some crunches, squats, or a really intense work-out. If you can't make it to the gym for a few hours every day (and most people can't), don't feel bad because you can still take a few minutes out of your day to do some cardio or work on your muscles. I hope this helps and good luck! :)|`|4zQEvzCsaa	Keep a food diary, but don't give yourself much room to write what you eat. You'll trick yourself, knowing that if you eat too much you won't be able to write it down! It's a good trick that works for me, and it has helped me cut back on all the snacking I was doing, plus seeing everything you eat on paper is a wake up call to change! Good luck!|`|aOmDuXubaa	The best way to lose weight is to control your appetite and the best way to do that that I know of is with hoodia.  When I was dieting (and believe me I still watch my weight even though I have achieved my weight loss goals for the most part) I realized right off that the most important thing is to control your appetite.  If your stomach's not always growling and your not always craving food it is sooo much easier to stick to your guns and stay on your diet.  With hoodia I would literally go a whole day sometimes and simply forget to eat and I didn't get tired and run down like diets can sometimes make you feel.  Once my appetite was under control and I wasn't always thinking about eating then and only then could the weight start coming off consistently and steadily because the hoodia kept my mind off of food and I would go longer on my diet and as I did that naturally I lost weight.  You have to remember that consistency is very important when losing weight.  If you cut back a little on your food consumption everyday your body will change (stomach will shrink and you won't be eating as much) and with that consistency over a few days, weeks and months you will lose weight just like I did.  Hoodia was my saving grace for all of these factors.  Hope this helps!!!|`|pdDEtKaIaa	well i would say if you want to lose weight start off by eating the right food like carbs, protein and fats in moderation of course. next would be exercise i say since its winter try to use a jump rope for cardio its cheep and it gets your heart pumping. Do not buy those cardio vids i mean it could work but why waste money on that. there are alot of others for cardio but that what i do or even a walk or a jog for 30 min works. try to eat health food avoid thouse junk foods and keep it up and you will look beautiful in the summer time if you keep this up
m5aenb6qaa	maybe it was because of the pressure on the shoes that you wore the other day. try to put an ice pack on it for 10-15 minutes and elevate it like put 1-2 pillows when you lie down.     or maybe it was from an insect bite. if the swelling does not go away for more than 3 days then seek medical help.|`|k91hDzu9aa	Okay.
p3NsXo0baa	Mri is no radiation so alot more safer where as with a ct scan your exposed to radiation.  I know a ct cuts the body up in thousands of pictures but im not sure what an mri does. But an mri is the safer way to go and better in diagnosing back problems.  Hope ive helped :)

It's difficult to explain the reason, but if you to know why it happen try Sigismund Freud "interpretation of dreams"  (it's not so difficult to understand this book).    Your Psyche is really powerful...|`|aR1OiJ7Waa	Falling in love with random people is a common theme in many dreams.      Dreaming about your period and starting a period can be explained in several ways:    1.  Subliminal perception  2.  Coincidence  3.  Latent cognition  4.  You're madam Cleo the psychic    I think you will get together with him if you make yourself sexually available, but don't expect him to respect you in the morning.|`|na8T1IGMaa	You're apparently physically attracted to this boy.   You dream about the things you think about most.  You want to have relations with him, but your subconscious mind is telling you that you're not ready with the dream of you menstruating.     If you both like each other, I'm sure you'll get together, but you should really ask yourself if that's what you want.   Get to know him VERY well before you make that decision.    You can only lose your virginity once, and 75% of non-virgins that have been surveyed said that they regretted their first time.   Wait for it.     I lost my virginity at fifteen, and now that I look back on it, I wasn't in love, and I do regret it.   I met the man of my dreams last year, and I really wish I would have waited and saved myself for him.     So I'm sure you know the risks of intercourse, like pregnancy, STDs, and other physical ailments, but the emotional risks are unavoidable.   You don't have to wait until marriage. Just wait until you're in love, and the sex means something to you.     I'm sure you guys will get together if that's what you guys want. Talk to him more, and show some interest. Don't be too shy. Guys are kinda slow, so you've gotta make some effort to let him know you like him, or he'll never see it. Guys don't pick up on subtle hints. Ever. Just don't do anything too drastic, because you might scare him away!     I hope I've been helpful a bit.
84eecd1a05ce02d2c2c9fb77423f6e95aa	Drink lots of fluids, get lots of rest, and stay away from others.....  Nobody wants you to share it!!    Feel better soon.....|`|uuQrhnJ4aa	Both cold & flu are caused by viruses. Lots of them-that's why we don't have a cure...it's the way the virus is made. Antibiotics do not work for viruses-only bacteria.    The only way to get rid of it is to let it run its course. That's usually from 7-10 days.     Get plenty of rest, remain hydrated w/lots of fluids, eat when you can. The main thing is to take it easy. Avoiding work/school will not only help you rest, but can prevent your passing it on to others.    If you try to push yourself, you can take longer to heal or even weaken yourself further and develop a secondary infection.     You can take over-the-counter meds to treat symptoms such as cough, sneeze, phlegm, aches, fever. These OTC meds do nothing in curing the illness, but they do help you feel better in coping w/symptoms. (Tylenol is good for fever reduction & aches. Cold preparations w/diphenhydramine help stuffed up heads. NSAIDs (Aleve, Ibuprofen) help w/body aches since they're excellent inflammatory relievers & help w/fever. Cold meds usually contain a combo of medications to help with multiple symptoms.    Fever is not necessarily a bad thing. It's the body sending out the troops to fight the bad guys. Once the fever reaches a high level, it can be dangerous & should be brought down. A low to mid-grade fever can be left untreated unless its making you feel really lousy. High fevers can become extremely dangerous & even life-threatening. Hospitals must be sought when a high fever doesn't respond to the usual onslought of aspirin, tyelenol, or advil pills.|`|twWeb9Piaa	the trick is not to stay enclosed in your house and rugged in bed  you must get fresh air outside away from your germs  light exercise is good  spicy hot and healthy nutritious meals
ykCo6SDOaa	Good - you have set a realistic target time and can lose a lot of weight ,and get toned and fit into the bargain, for autumn time. You need to several things though - as follows:    1) Improve your diet - Sorry if I am making assumptions  - but you need to shift on to green vegetables, less fatty foods, less meat, and little in the way of carbihydrates. Plenty of greens will provide a wide range of nutrients and promote health in various ways    2) Increase activity - to burn more energy - you should work towards about 3 periods of up to 30 minutes vigourous exercise a week (assuming you are staring from none just now) - exercise ahould be enough to raise your heart rate and keep it elevated for about 20 to 30 minutes to promte heart health benefits, get you lightly sweating...and so on - BUT always chack with your Doctor before starting an exercise program if you have (or might have) any health issues    3) Try a clean sweep! It is often overlooked but - a colon cleansing routine can clear out fermenting debris, and parasites that could be making you feel fat and bloated  - and ordinary 'dieting' just won't get rid of these problems so it is highly recommneded to sonsider doing: Some tips and advice: http://www.how-hub.com/colon-cleansing.h...|`|spXPpyP0aa	EAT 1200 CALORIES A DAY|`|Aw23tsCxaa	I don't exercise or eat healthy I eat alot of fast food and drink alot of soda and I have lost 25 pounds in 1 month.... o_O I don't if that work for you but idk haha...
X7nkrw6maa	She's a lesbo just like leah darkchild.|`|q7mActnmaa	It is possible that she isn't sexually attracted to you anymore.  Or that she just doesn't feel like having sex.  A number of things could cause it.      The vaginal lining is very estrogen sensitive. Even years before actual menopause, when estrogen's fluctuate during the cycle and reach a low just after your period, you may sense that you become less lubricated during intercourse. (This can also happen when you are breast-feeding and dont ovulate or produce normal quantities of estrogen). With menopause, lack of estrogen causes a decrease in blood supply, muscle tone and elasticity of the tissue, a diminution of fluid and lubrication with arousal, a change in pH and eventually, thinning of the vaginal lining. Eventually, the vaginal opening may shrink so that penetration becomes difficult. All these rather horrific symptoms are encompassed by the medical term atrophic vaginitis).    -Cass|`|kprKXEOSaa	She could be dehydrated.  But even when sexually aroused, and even after orgasm, some women still don't have enough vaginal lubrication for intercourse to be comfortable.  Get some lubricant, Astroglide is a good one, and there are tons of other brands out there.|`|lcc4Z6fXaa	You are unable to activate her physically. Try a lot of oral. It will help in this problem|`|OsT64mqMaa	Maybe she isn't attracted to you anymore. Sometimes you can't force it, or fake it.

To me, it really sounds like herpes, and many doctors will tell you that you can only contract herpes with sexual intercourse, but that is a myth that doctors stick with. It has been proven that some stds can be transmitted from toilet seats, things you touch with you hands, then wipe, tanning beds, and much more. The only real way to know if have the doctor do a suave of the area and test it. Good luck to you, and don't freak out. First of all, you did nothing wrong, and you can't be ashamed of that. Just get it checked, and deal with it when you know...|`|pWqYGLOLaa	If you've never had sex before chances are. .Its nothing.. dont be stressin over it.. just go get it checked out.. you'll be glad you did! :)|`|a7Osxk2iaa	Honey check it out.

I had a large gap between my first and my second period, my second one was heavier than my 1st too. Your body is still developing and growing into puberty, your periods will become much more regular in the years to come. If you are extremely worried, see your doctor.|`|na8T1IGMaa	Yeah. That's perfectly normal.     I had my first period in July of 2004. I was 12, and had a very small build. I was a cheerleader, and exercised a lot. I had a lot of stress at home, as well. Those were all contributors to the reason why I didn't have another period until August of 2006. I spotted a bit a couple of times but no real heavy flow.     The first two years of experiencing menstruation are always sketchy. Some chicks never have a specific day they get it, or any precise amount of time between them. Before I started birth control, I would never know when I'd have mine. I'd have two or three 5-day periods a month, or I'd miss mine for three months. It'd never be one week of every month. It's different for every girl.     Don't worry about it. Worrying and stressing over stuff too much will make your body freak out and not menstruate, or delay the menstruation.   There's nothing wrong with you.
a7Osxk2iaa	Get him some lip ice. Lolz|`|vl0HWTDJaa	No. You can only get herpes from someone who has herpes, and in that case it doesn't matter if their lips are chapped or not.    He should be putting vaseline on overnight to avoid his lips getting too dry.

SrpX6IJDaa	A simple filling honestly doesn't hurt, and it's not that scary!   Some can even be done without an injection of local anesthetic, but that's if it's only a surface filling.     Firstly, they'll put gel; a TOPICAL anesthetic which the dentist will place on the GUM at the injection site (if an injection of LOCAL anesthetic is needed). They'll wait a minute or two, to test that it's working, and then gently insert the needle. You probably wont feel the actual needle, the only part you might feel is the actual anesthetic moving through the gum. It might cause a slight stinging sensation for a few seconds.     The dentist will then put the needle away! and wait.     They usually give you a few moments, and then test to see that the local anesthetic is working, by doing a few different 'tap' tests on the tooth and surrounding gum area.     There's two types of 'numbing' techniques used. One for just the tooth that's being worked on (usually the technique used for simple fillings) and there's a block technique used to numb the whole side of the jaw. (If you're having major work such as an extraction, or root canal, they'll use this technique).     Once they've made sure that the tooth and gum is numb, they'll use a small drill to drill out the 'decayed' area. There's no pain associated with the drilling, as your tooth will be more than numb. You will feel a strong-ish vibration, as the drill moves around and the handle touches your lip or gums. This doesn't hurt, it just feels like you're resting an electric tooth brush in your mouth. Bit odd, but in no way painful.     When they've cleared away the decayed part of the tooth, they'll then start the filling process.     Fillings are actually a paste like substance, which they 'paint' onto the hole, or surface of the tooth. It usually goes on in quite a few layers, depending how deep the cavity is, to be filled.   When they've finished filling it up with the paste like substance, they'll shine a UV light onto the tooth, which 'seals' the paste like substance onto the tooth's surface. They'll then ask you to bite on a small piece of black 'blotting' paper, and presto! You're done!     It's really as simple as that!     Remember, if you've got ANY pain, at all throughout the procedure (even though you shouldn't), make sure you raise your hand, and alert the dentist or assistant.   They can then top you up with more local anesthetic as needed, and once again, wait and test to make sure it's working!     If you're extra nervous (like I was the first time I had dental work done a few months ago), it's a very good idea to get Nitrous Oxide. It's actually what you'd know as Happy Gas! It's brilliant stuff. It doesn't send you to sleep, but it relaxes you to no end. A few deep breaths BEFORE the needle, will do absolute wonders.     I used to be so scared of dentists, and I didn't go to one for 10 years, because of my fear- but I ended up having three periapical (root) abscesses, which all required an extraction of the three teeth.   I was shaking, teary and ready to bolt on that first appointment, but Nitrous Oxide, and a really nice dentist got me settled, and now- i've been to the dentist 14 times in a year now, for different work and now orthodontic work, and I couldn't be further from a fear.     Don't worry, you'll be fine :)|`|1aagL3uvaa	Well, first thing they're going to do is, they'll shove your head under a massive guillotine and whack your head off so you don't feel your teeth.  Then the take a hammer and slam the tooth out of your mouth so your gum's don't hurt when they operate on it.  Then they have their cement truck out back which is where they take your tooth next and fill it in.  It takes about a week to recover from the whole ordeal but it's worth it  ;)
wZnADZsnaa	No that won't work. Wear them every day like you are supposed to and they will gradually correct your under/overbite. If you don't wear them properly you'll only need treatment for longer, and might even do yourself damage wearing 4 at once like that. You don't do it to impress the dentist just before the appointment, you do it so that you'll have a nice smile when you grow up.    Trust me, it pays in the long term. I gave up my treatment early because it was taking too long, and it was a mistake. I envy anyone whose teeth are more perfect than mine, and always look back with regret on that day when I asked to have the brace removed because I was sick of it.    It's worth having a brace for a few years when you're younger, the brace is only for a few years but the teeth you have will stay with you the rest of your life.|`|oGyL9WJ1aa	If you aren't wearing them as prescribed then your treatment is going to be longer. Wearing a bunch at night will not replace the constant wearing of them. Lots of people think that but it simply isn't true. Put them in and think of how bad you want them off - that will motivate you.|`|DzHB8z6Yaa	Actually this will not work the dentist is going to know if you have wore the or not. So I suggest wearing them or your going to have your braces on long and you probably don't want that. Just wear them make sure you always have a pack with you!|`|vsQBW5jaaa	Just wear them! You'll thank yourself for it when you have perfect teeth like me :D I had to have elastic bands, yeah it gets sore but guess what? You get used to them! Just dont eat or sleep with them in and wear them all day, I used to play the guitar with them :P|`|mLrDiRkdaa	Wear your rubberbands ALL day and remove them ONLY when you eat or brush&floss. My first month having rubberbands, i wore them all the time & by the next appointment my doctor said if i continued to wear them well like i did - then i was able to take off my braces early a couple of months. After that i thought i was fine, so i stopped wearing my rubberbands and only wore them at night - next appointment he noticed and i was delayed taking off my braces. This is my third month, and now i have to make up for all the lost time without my rubberbands /=    So wear yours!
Z2m8TEFHaa	Go to NHS direct website (www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk) and give them a call. It's likely that it's not anything serious but better safe than sorry.
eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	It may not be due to any one particular thing, but a combination of them that is the problem.  Boils and pimples are due to bacteria that normally lives on the skin getting beneath the skin, or into a hair follicle or pore.  Once in beneath the skin, they get attacked by your immune system, and you have a spot or boil form- depending on the location.  The groin is by nature a spot favorable to gerbies because it's warm, dark and moist- jus the things they like.  And once you get a bacterial population explosion going, it's just real easy for them to spread from one spot to another.  You can make matters worse by trying to stay extra clean, too- which is a real insult.  For starters, try changing a few things to make the area a little less inviting.  Use an antibacterial soap, and a medicated body powder.  For washing up, make sure you use a bath cloth, and don't use it more than one bath.  If you use a scrubbie, you need to dip it in a bleach/water mix to disinfect it completely before you use it again.  Wash the cloth before using it again, and get it bone dry in the dryer.  Unless you simply must wear them, for now going commando is the ideal way to go.  You want to stop doing crotch pot cooking, and that means you need to get air and sunlight to the region.  Since sunlight is pretty difficult, a nice airflow is critical.  Even when you must wear undies, they should be boxers and not jockey shorts.  You don't want the temperature and moisture held in against the body, and boxers help keep a bit of airflow going as well as a lower temp.  Before you get dressed for the day, powder things down with the medicated body powder.  If you do get a spot, keep your hands off it at all costs.  Use moist heat packs to get it to drain itself, and don't pick, prod or squeeze.  One thing you may have done if you did previously pick, prod or squeeze was to rupture one beneath the skin or break a cyst.  When that happens, you spread the infection around, and the broken cyst multiplies to make others.   So you really want them to drain themselves.  When one begins to drain, clean it well and use something like witch hazel on the skin.  It's a nice gentle antiseptic on skin, but really wicked on bacteria.  Make sure your pants are not really snug fitted in the region either, and natural fibers like cotton and wool are a much better choice than synthetics.  Synthetics do not breathe, so moisture and heat don't escape as easily, and there's no air flow.  A natural fiber will wick away both heat and sweat, so there's less friendly circumstances for gerbies to set up house with.  Mostly it's a matter of making the area less friendly.  You may still need antibiotics to help with a boil, but if you can get the cycle broken, it should reach a point where they don't happen much at all.  Some folks are just cursed with getting them in a spot, so you may always be prone to it- but there's no reason why it has to be a constant misery.  Other things to consider- if the laundry detergeant and fabric softener you use don't get completely rinsed out of your clothing, that can also be a skin irritant.  It doesn't cause the spots, but irritated skin is easier to infect.  You also don't need to wash all of you more than once a day, although the crotch does often benefit from a wipe down more frequently- it doesn't mean you must scrub with hot water and loads of soap.  As a rule, one good bath and a wipe down between is about all you should need to keep things sweet.  Too much washing with harsh soaps is just as bad for skin as being grungy.  Try these things, and with a bit of luck, you should have some improvement.|`|rsdKX1fyaa	look up FOLLICULITIS (inflammation/infection of hair follicles.  Treated with antibiotics.      Also look up HIDRADENTITA SUPPERITIVA.......you could have either of these conditions.  If the problem persists despite treatment, ask your doctor to refer you to a dermatologist.  The antibiotic TETRALYSAL is particularly effective.
c9NuCZnaaa	bio oil is meant to be better than cocoa butter. So i'd sugest the bio oil. I used it after i had my baby. I had really purple angry looking scars all over my belly and now i just have a few silvery white lines on the bottom. nd i've been using it for 8 months. So it does take time but it's worth it.  If it's putting you down too much maybe consider lazer surgery|`|AA10577667	Not exactly sure what bio oil is but I do know cocoa butter works pretty good. I have used it myself and my scars can barely be see (I think they can only be seen by me because I know they are there and mind you they are no scars from surgery so they are probably not as deep)    But yeah, cocoa butter works great and hey, Don Cherry was the one who recommended it to me!

TqQcB2gWaa	type 1 is worse for your body, type 2 is worse in the sense that it is self induced. (the side affects from type 1 is worse than type 2)<br>  It's hard to explain, It's worse to have type 2, because there are many other problems you also have. I feel like im starting to sound ignorant...this is kinda hard to explain...<br>  <br>  Basically Type 1 is worse cause your body produces no insulin, as compared to type 2 where you are not completely dependent on insulin, or maybe not at all. Many type 2's can control their diabetes with diet alone,<br>  Also type 1 is worse because your stuck with it forever, unless they find a cure, which is very possible. Type 2 you can get rid of by loosing weight in most cases.<br>  <br>  Type 1 and type 2 are basically two completely different diseases.<br>  <br>  Btw, guessing that you are newly diagnosed, If  you have any questions, feel free to email me @ tannerroan@yahoo.com|`|0hSpsSByaa	While both can hurt you, type 1 is generally worse.  Commonly known as juvenile diabetes, it often starts in childhood and is frequently harder to control.  Type 2 can often be controlled with medication other than insulin, and often can be controlled without medication using diet and exercise.|`|e5VUwaRsaa	Type 1 is considered more serious, especially since most people with it get it at a young age. Also, type 2 can be reversed, but type 1 cannot.|`|8OqdoIHtaa	Neither one is worse. What is worse having uncontrolled diabetes of ANY type. <br>  <br>  Either type can be very bad for your health if not well controlled. <br>  <br>  Some type 2's need insulin and are basically in the same situation as type 1's because their body can't make insulin anymore or can't make enough. Many type 2's are insulin dependent. <br>  <br>  Type 2 is worse in one way for sure. You can have it for 8 to 11 years or even longer before you get diagnosed. In all that time you have elevated blood sugar that is damaging your body, and the strain on your pancreas to produce more and more insulin eventually burns out your pancreas. So by the time you get diagnosed, you have multiple health problems and irreversible damage to your eyes, nerves, and possibly your circulatory system and digestion. <br>  <br>  Both Type 1 AND Type 2's on insulin are basically in the same boat as far as having difficulty controlling it with insulin. You have to be very strict with your diet, and very careful about how much insulin you use and when. <br>  <br>  Type 1 is a quick onset, Type 2, is a slower onset and at the beginning can be often be controlled with diet, exercise and oral medications. Eventually most type 2's will need insulin, as their pancreas will become unable to produce enough. <br>  <br>  Both have a hereditary factor, but anyone can get diabetes at any time, even if there are no known family members affected by it. <br>  <br>  Type 1 gets all the attention because it affects kids and young people. <br>  <br>  Type 2 diabetics make up from 85 to 95 % of the diabetic population. Many people have type 2 diabetes and don't even know it until the damage is already done. That's the tragedy of type 2. Its a silent killer. <br>  <br>  Instead of focusing on which one is worse, focus on educating people about diabetes and make sure that everyone in your family gets tested at their checkup. They should always get an HbA1c test, which shows the average blood glucose over the past 3 months. If they have no symptoms, they should still get tested. As I said, type 2 is a silent killer. <br>  <br>  Many people think that type 2 is brought on by being fat and inactive. This is not true and an out of date theory. Many people are fat and inactive and don't get diabetes. <br>  <br>  There are lots of type 2 diabetics walking around that are not fat, OR inactive. So weight is not the trigger. <br>  <br>  You have to have defective genes to get type 2. There are many different genes that can lead to type 2. <br>  <br>  We know now that these genes lead to insulin resistance, defective insulin, and weight gain, rather than weight gain leading to diabetes. <br>  <br>  Its time for everyone to stop blaming type 2's for their disease and realize that our genes are beyond our control and make it very difficult to keep the weight off and control our blood sugar.<br>  <br>  Here's an excellent article that explains how type 2 happens...<br>  <a href="http://www.phlaunt.com/diabetes/14046739.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.phlaunt.com/diabetes/14046739...</a>|`|oojO4WAraa	Type 1 is an autoimmune disease - you never get over it. <br>  <br>  Type 2 is due to poor lifestyle choices and is reversible through diet and proper exercise.  <br>  <br>  Type 1 is worse.

The genetic one is worse.|`|MeJplr38aa	Type 1 your body does not produce insulin.<br>  Type 2 your body does not produce enough insulin or you body cannot use the insulin, meaning your cells dont recognize it.<br>  <br>  In my opinion one shouldnt be worse than the other because they both generally are treated with insulin injections. <br>  Type 2, though, is a lot easier to regulate. Some people can regulate it just with diet and exercise. Type 2 though generally occurs after the age of 30.<br>  Type 1 is also known as juvenile diabetes because it is more common in children.<br>  So if I absolutely had to choose one that is worse I would choose Type 1 because it cannot be regulated without insulin.|`|DjMAhvpvaa	It's type 1.

It really does a pretty good job on water weight, and overtime works on fat, but not nearly as fast.  Its really only going to be truly effective if you are doing 30 minutes of cardio every day you take it.  and its affects seem to wear off like a low cal diet.  As soon as you go off of it, expect to see some weight gain within a week, so if you are going to take it, you need to take it until you leave for Miami or it will all be for naught.  That said, if you doo all of the above, you can expect to see some decent results, possibly getting down to 165 with consistent cardio and some good definition which I assume is your goal.<br>  Best of luck.

f8mLpPXlaa	Your nose generally warms and humidifies the air we breathe. In extremely cold air the nose is no longer able to do that hence the air reaches your lungs cold and dry. Just having gotten over a lung infection the membranes are probably still quite sensitive. So you have a reaction like you did, it gets hard to breath because of the increased irritation. Not to worry this will go away.

XgbIJkcmaa	Well I used to be just flat stomached without abs then I started doing 600 consequetive situps every morning and night for a month and now I have an 8-pack ab's, but 50 won't give you result's for a while, I suggeststarting with what your doing now and every 2 weeks add another 50-100, additionally when you do situp's when you lean foward when doing them twist oyur body to the left then when you do another one twist it to  the right and it will tone more then just the front muscle's and will tighten your sides.<br>  <br>  Hope This Help's! :D|`|MPX0f5jzaa	It may be getting bigger if your form is wrong.  Don't push outwards when doing crunches (you shouldn't be doing sit-ups), it'll build the muscle outwards.  Pull in instead.<br>  <br>  You can't target weight loss, so if you're bigger around the middle, chances are you owe the rest of your body some exercise too.<br>  <br>  When I'm targeting my stomach, I do 50 at a time, but at least four sets.  That comes to 200 a night.  It was said that at Britney Spears' heyday, she did at least 500 - 1000 a night, and you know how tight she looked, so....|`|cbp7Gukbaa	it takes years to see true results|`|0Pkup44haa	Only doing sit-ups to reduce fat won't work. Try eating healthy, jogging, swimming weight training, etc.|`|1iOsKZvIaa	if you have wii fit, try the abdominal exersizes, works a treat!|`|VPNP5Irfaa	you need to do more than just situps, also 50 won't get you too far|`|6b7KFgtpaa	Your tummy may seem bigger due to swelling of the muscle from workouts, water retention, even a bit of subcutaneous fat.<br>  <br>  Be careful with sit-ups, watch your form and don't pull on your neck/head with your hands.  In fact keep from touching either one.<br>  <br>  Do crunches.<br>  <br>  Mix it up.  Go to websites like youtube and look at demos for workouts that involve the abs.  My ab workouts are usually part of compound exercises such as L-Dips and L-Pull ups.  Do leg lifts, get on a pullup bar and do knees to elbows.  There are several ways to mix it up.<br>  <br>  Then there's diet.  Decrease the fat layer to show them off.|`|qDfmDVPIaa	hi, the best tip is to keep at it evey single day, when it becomes easier to complete 50 in one session up the ammount of reps. also try to increase the ammount of sessions you do- so do 50 before breakfast, 50 before tea and 50 just before bed- you need to sick to a strict scedule and don't give up- you won't notice it over night - just as the flab never arrived overnight but persistance is the key.|`|37L6OOC5aa	Targetted weight reduction is quite tough, many people would state impossible, but the only method which definitely worked for me was wu-yi tea, it can be viewed in the resource box below, they have a limited number of free trials left, it has been featured in Fox News and USA Today. I melted away 20 pounds, it definitely does produce results!|`|hpkOeOLyaa	don't click on that link, its probably spam<br>  just keep doing what you are doing, it sounds good, try running too, and try to eat healthy and try more situps.|`|5eb9bc08684eb639e4e67dbad037e24daa	Hi <br>  Try and do planks too. Also try and do leg risers, these will help define your stomach.<br>  <br>  peter|`|3rvsG372aa	I think you're starting at a good pace.  I imagine that as a dancer, you keep your body fat at a low level, which is important because no matter how toned your stomach is, nobody can see it if it's covered up (by fat that is).  In addition to the sit-ups, I would advise buying an ab wheel.  I bought mine from Walmart for like $5, and pretty much all it is is a wheel on a stick.  The exercise is very effective though because it gives you a longer range of motion and if you are doing the exercises right, then it will also give your stomach a more intense workout.  Good luck with your Stomach!
5u1oHgTZaa	Are you sure this person was an assistant and not a hygienist?  There is a difference.|`|Po4Lljjwaa	Yes, that's what a cavitron is for.<br>  <br>  "A cavitron is a dental tool that uses high frequency sound waves to clean teeth. The Cavitron ultrasonic cleaner is a state of the art instrument that has proved to be an extremely successful tool in removing tartar from both above and below the gumline. Instead of scaling your teeth with bulky metal hand scalers the cavitron ultrasonic cleaner is a blunt tip that uses oscillating sound waves to gently vibrate the tartar away from your teeth. The Cavitron unit is so gentle that it can even be used to administer deep cleaning and gum therapy many times without the need for anesthetic. Having your teeth cleaned with the Cavitron unit is a safe effective and painless alternative to traditional cleaning methods. A Cavitron vibrates at the speed of sound so quickly that you can hardly feel any movement this ultrasonic method is a more pleasant alternative."
UL3XOKJxaa	Absolutely not...a dental assistant can not use a Cavitron or any scaler on a patient. These have the ability to remove hard tissue and this is not allowed. The doctor should be fully aware of this and should not allow it.|`|861e2515d2e36cb441a7198e2e55446caa	TELL THE DOCTOR<br>  DAMAGE TO TEETH/GUMS MAY BE CAUSED|`|3PuKXEwZaa	It would depend on your individual state laws what duties could a dental assistant do or not do.  In general dental assistants can only do things that are reversible.  A cavitron is used for cleaning teeth so I think it would be o.k. if a dental assistant used one.  As long as the dental assistant is not practicing hygiene.|`|XUCER5Vcaa	I am in the dental field and my hygenist uses the cavitron on me.

ToILKl6waa	It seems like you're holding onto a great deal of grief. There comes a time in your life when you need to let things go for your own well being, and look towards the future. Each day is a fresh start. The past is nothing. Accept your parent's divorce - they only did it to suit their best interests and it's rough for them too. It's not right for your parents to offer remarks instead of comfort in regard to your anorexia. I advise you to talk to your mom truthfully about it and beg for her understanding. She cares for you inside, even if she fails to show it. Your teacher seems like an ignorant barbarian and horrendous role model. Forgive yourself for the F and use your cruel teacher as a motivational tool to prove her wrong. Study more often and believe you can do better. Do not let get to you, and realize that things change. Eventually you'll be graduating and breaking free from all those who hurt you. Be free and expressive - change around your routine and try new things. You can get past this struggle if you have faith. It would also be best for you to keep a journal to record your thoughts and feelings in when it is necessary. <br>  <br>  Best wishes.|`|H0oylQOwaa	Sorry to hear ur having a tough time.She shouldn't be allowed to hurt u. A lot of parents just about emotionally abuse their kids and it ain't fair. My moms like this and i hate her but i don't want to.

Maybe a cousin or older sibling. The sooner she knows what shes doing to you the sooner she will stop. <br>  <br>  My cat got killed by a Dog and she was 6years old and beautiful and I fainted when i saw.

k3ZVZmBJaa	You could have bipolar or you could just be experiencing fluctuating hormone levels.  In reality, there is lot of different illnesses it could be or you may have nothing wrong with you at all.  Do not allow people in your life or on Yahoo diagnose you.  That must be done by a doctor or trained mental health professional.  Psychologists, psychiatrists, etc. can diagnose you based on your present or past mental state, your medical history and your family's medical history, and your functional ability in social, occupational, or academic areas.  Many mental health professionals use specific tests (MMPI) or others to gain a better understanding of your personality and emotional state.  <br>  <br>  If you are concerned about how you are feeling, it may be beneficial to see your general physician first and, if necessary, see a mental health professional.  It is entirely possible that you are experiencing a medical illness rather than a mental illness.  At the very least, talking with a professional can help you better handle your moods.  <br>  <br>  And, yes, bipolar can be genetic, but that is not to say that everyone will develop it just because there is a family history.|`|nZpSM7ngaa	you are bipolar if, like you said, you have very high highs,  and very low lows.  there is medication i think.  i think its ritalin im not sure,  then again,  if you are a teenager,  it could be mood swings,  but if you have had these your entire life,  you could be bipolar.  you should make appointments with a therapist on tips how to contain your self.|`|8FbOtXAXaa	If you are bipolar, sometimes you will feel like you are full of energy, have really high self esteem, and ambition, and that nothing can get you down. Then it goes to another extreme with feelings of extreme irritability, lack of concentration, paranoia, impulsiveness, weight loss due to lack of hunger and these are just a few. You need to go to a psychiatrist and he can diagnose you as to what you are dealing with and if it is in fact Bipolar disorder. He will then prescribe you meds if needed. Don't go to see just a family doctor because they are not equipped to rule out a mental disorder, that is a psychiatrists job. Hope you find this helpful.|`|syARUNBDaa	About 2.6% of Americans age 18 and older have been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder.

278113a07b7b6648ec6e32639de20bf9aa	I took a product called "All-One" several years back.  They have several varieties.  The store owner, a vegetarian, suggested it and I had a lot of success in taking it.  It was during a time in my life that my digestive system wasn't working very well, among other health problems.  I needed something easily assimilated by the body, and easy to take.  I mixed it with a small amount of pineapple juice every morning around 10:00 a.m. (but you can take it whenever), and I could tell a HUGE difference when I didn't take it.  <br>  <br>  I know you said you weren't particularly looking for a powder, but this is a really good product that I think would give you good results.  I am very picky about the vitamins and supplements that I take, and haven't come across a good chewable.  I use a lot of Nature's Sunshine products.  They do have a children's chewable, but I've never purchased it.  We do not buy cheap vitamins at Wal-Mart, because they just aren't very effective and at times are not in a form the body can absorb or even use effectively.  <br>  <br>  Also, I know there is conflicting information about Mona Vie, but I really like that product.  My husband & I are not members, and so do not sell the product, but we enjoy using it when we can afford a bottle and notice a lot of good benefits from it.  It's a juice, basically, and you take 1-2 ounces 2 times a day.  It contains MANY nutrients, easily used and digested by the body, and it tastes good.  <br>  <br>  Link for All-One:<br>  <a href="http://www.all-one.com/en/" rel="nofollow">http://www.all-one.com/en/</a>|`|8y24H37Maa	viagra

3sriJtSkaa	Whoever told you to drink water is right. It sounds very much like a kidney infection. here is a possible scenario for what went wrong:<br>  1. bacteria of some kind was introduced at your vagina (very often e. coli that spreads from your poop somehow to your vagina. I know ti sounds gross but it's really common. <br>  2. the bacteria infected your urinary tract- this is probably when you began to feel the urge to urinate frequently<br>  3. the bacterial infection of your urinary tract was not treated promptly and as a result, spread up further into your kidneys. <br>  The lowr back or "flank" pain is a classic indicator of a kidney infection and although you can try to drink water, you will not be able to cure this yourself. <br>  you attempts to avoid the doctor however, will prolong the amount of time that your kidneys are infected and raise the chances that your body will be damaged forever. <br>  go.to.the.doctor. <br>  they will give you antibiotics and you'll feel better in 48hrs|`|0bff81ed3d62dee95cf8cc2a3daa55a4aa	Sounds like a UTI, more common in females than in males, and it needs an antibiotic.  To get the antibiotic, you need a prescription, and to get a prescription, you need to see a doctor.  This is a good idea anyway, to make sure you get the correct diagnosis and the correct medication.  Don't fool around with this on your own.  Also, in future, if you're not doing this already, always wipe yourself from front to back to prevent transfer of bacteria from your rear end, if you catch my drift.|`|BNAzjSO1aa	It certainly sounds like it is a UTI, which can cause serious problems if left untreated and normally needs antibiotics to clear it up completely. The fact that the urine is clear may mean that it is the early stages but the other symptoms suggest that you have had it for a while. A few things that might help relieve the discomfort are to drink plenty of water to flush the kidneys through. Drink cranberry juice to change the acidity of the urine. But you should seek medical help if it has not started to improve with in a day or two. If it was a yeast infection your discharge is more likely to be a yellow/greenish colour smell offensive and itch. Personally I would seek medical advice because if it is a UTI  which I think it is I also think the back pain you are experiencing is due to the problem reaching the kidneys so please see a doctor ASAP(as soon as possible)

If it's on the crescent on the end of your nail, meaning the part that you trim off, you can either trim your thumb nail short, or you can file it down *note, if it's still raw it might hurt a little*.  Or, if it's right near your thumb on the very inner part of your nail (sorry there are two white crescents haha) you can either paint over your thumb with some neutral colored polish, or try using clear polish if you want to get rid of it.

RSBufJHUaa	It would be considered ASSAULT AND BATTERY and you could be arrested like the 7th grade girl at a school near me.  She kicked a 9th grade boy so hard, he fell to the floor, vomited and urinated on himself.  She and her 'friends' stood around and laughed at the boy.  His parents took a warrant out for her arrest.  She got 10 days suspension from school (no makeups), a fine through the court and 20 hours community service.<br>  I'd have beat the living snot out of her if it had been me!|`|zR8RrgBnaa	ROFL !<br>  yeeah , it would.<br>  if i came up to you and kicked you in the nuts,<br>  would that be mean ?<br>  <br>  yuuuussiirie! it would.<br>  XD|`|q0ce9dEnaa	Yes that would be mean, as it could render him sterile; he may never be able to have children becuase you wanted to kick him for no reason.|`|8umXlm1Jaa	No even though that would be mean, it could render him sterile; he may never be able to have children becuase you wanted to kick him for no reason.

BOuPi3wDaa	Don't worry!  I get that all the time!  It looks gross but hey, who sees it?  Those are really just blood or tissue clots.  I get them because I'm at school and pretty much sitting all day, so the blood flows down but gets stopped up from sitting and it forms a clot.  Nothing to worry about.  At first I thought it was a serious disease, and now it's just part of my period.  And yes, sometimes they're pretty big.  Don't worry unless it hurts or itches or something.  Sending you good luck and sympathy!|`|DjsQlvTRaa	Its just because during your period the lining of your uterus is shedding along with eggs (your eggs attach to the lining of the uterus) so those lumps are pieces of tissue/lining. I have heavy periods and I tend to get large pieces of lining. Its normal, I asked my doctor because the pieces got so big it scared me.|`|eCTSonKraa	idk happened 2 me be4 but i have no idea wat it so <br>  when u find out plz tell me :P|`|ogeRU7KEaa	It's normal. Don't worry it happens to everyone.|`|sKTmxnx1aa	I get those too.  A lot of women get them when they have heavier periods.  Yes, they are clots.  They are pretty harmless, so I wouldn't be worried.  Hope this helps!
bmWKETgWaa	If you are overweight, you may be putting too much strain on your muscles, joints, and tendons. <br>  <br>  If that's not a factor, you should get your folks to take you to an orthopedist (a doctor who specializes in such things).|`|bf5cDEyZaa	It is not possible to diagnose you without a proper  examination but I would consider juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, which is inflammation of your joints.<br>  There is pretty good info on it here:<br>  <a href="http://www.webmd.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/tc/juvenile-rheumatoid-arthritis-topic-overview" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmd.com/rheumatoid-arthriti...</a><br>  <br>  Best of luck!

Above all, get a good night sleep!|`|fBFNCS1Naa	Go to a hypnotist and get them to convince you that if you don't win tomorrow's race a terrorist will kill your parents.

ba57fb92aa421eaa3a4ae7f0f80f397caa	The findings indicate that your have several sources of sinus blockage.  <br>  <br>  The right maxillary sinus is near your right cheekbone and right eye socket - the lining of this sinus is swollen and partly filled with fluid. This finding suggests a chronic infection or chronic allergy. You do not have the same problem on the left side.  Your nasal septum (bone that divides the sinuses to the left and right) jis skewed to the right, which makes the opening to the right side narrower than the left.  If the opening is narrowed, the sinuses tend to clog and get infected or swollen.   This type of problem sometimes causes pain in the cheeks. <br>  <br>  A concha bullosa is a specific type of swelling that occurs in the central part of the sinuses, more or less above your palate and behind the eyes.  This type of swelling causes another blockage, and sometimes causes sinus headaches with eye pain.<br>  <br>  The osteomeatal area consists of a layer of bony cavities directly above the palate and toward the back of the skull.  The right side is completely blocked and the left side has some narrowing.  Blockage and swelling in this area tends to make it feel like your upper teeth ache (but not intense  pain like a toothache from an impacted tooth).<br>  <br>  Taken all together,  you would benefit from some type of treatment to open up your sinuses.  You might find some relief from some combination of a decongestant, antihistamine, expectorant, and/or steroidal nasal spray (like Nasonex or Flonase).   You might also be a good candidate for having your sinuses unblocked by surgery, and this might be the only options that is effective if your problems are not allergy-related.|`|rqW2JjiCaa	ok. Your right sinus has got a fair bit of mucus in it (hence air/fluid level) or could be blood if you recently have had a decent punch in the face! Your nose (septum) is toward the right side, could be normal or maybe you broke your nose once. The concha bullosa is a small cyst in your middle choncha. (The chonch are 3 ridge like things deep in your nose.) This bullosa is completely harmless unless its big enopugh to block air flow and yours isnt). The diagnosis is chronic sinusitis.|`|AA12041870	You can look all those terms up in a medical dictionary and figure out what it is telling you that way.  You can pull a medical dictionary up on the computer.  It says you have thick mucus in the right side of your face on the right side.  It isn't as bad on the left.  Your nose is growing to the right instead of in the middle of your face, and you may have a little cyst like thing growing in there.  The last sentence, it's hard for you to breathe because of the thickenings.   This is very very broad.  Look up the terms to understand what you are reading.
13k2WKx8aa	Yep. They won't refuse you. It doesn't mean they're not going to collect though. Also, they don't have to take care of you. Some places are better than others though.<br>  <br>  I live in Boston near Mass General Hospital (one of the best in the world).

SFba2RUPaa	If you have no symptoms( pelvic pain,irregular bleeding,etc),the fullness is likely nothing to be worried about.Your doctor is just being careful not to miss anything that could potentially get you into trouble.A pelvic exam is not the easiest thing in the world to do and folks have all sorts of normal variations on their exams.The pelvic ultrasound just adds an additional view of your pelvic organs and will help rule out a problem.Sounds like your doctor is just doing her job-and doing it well.Good luck!|`|5dEacmPzaa	My sister had this problem and it turned out to be a cyst.  She basically just had to live through some pain during her ovulation period and after awhile I believe that it went away.|`|lNsr26oIaa	In your ovary, it could be a cyst. Fibroids are uterine. But ovarian cysts are common and usually benign, so try not to worry.|`|Sb1PmUZQaa	i had a pelvic ultersound to check for cysts, and i had to drink a ton of water before hand, not sure if its the same thing you have to do? They were looking at my ovaries and tubes/looking for cysts.

1f93fa3c5a4f157aadd42c2fd3953d4caa	First of all, your size/ appearance is your business. If you like it, then forget what others say. <br>  <br>  Secondly, different body shapes-ruler, pear, hour glass, apple, all look and carry mass differently. It does not always matter how much you weigh,  (unless a person is not anorexicly sick or very obese- both can be unhealthy).<br>  <br>  Rulers are straight up and down, and can measure (in inches)<br>  32-30-32, and weigh 120 @5ft 2 inches.<br>  <br>  Pears, have small shoulders, and hips that are wider than the shoulders, making the body look spoon shaped. Alot of girls in my classes are pears. They look like 32-21-42, are 5 feet tall and weigh 100 lbs or so. But they look more proportionate in shoulder pads. <br>  <br>  Hourglasses are like 36-26-36 or 34-24-34. They have hips the same width as their shoulders, and defined waist lines. <br>  Apples, carry all mass on top and have skinny legs, so they might be 40-30-32.<br>  Bottom line, there are many different body shapes, and many happy- functional people in the world. So whatever your shape, make the most of it.|`|ymK1hg2Raa	um, their f*ckin liars because you cannot be 104 lbs and wear size 10 or 12. just not gonna happen.<br>  <br>  i'm sure you look like a size 4 and they are just crazy jealous that they don't have your body!!|`|AnhoHRFTaa	You don't look much more then your original size. You are just kidding yourself about your actual size. You are a 10 or 12, probably 12|`|fox5a3ePaa	I dont know but id take it as a compliment, size 6 is skinny where size 10-12 is sexy|`|yx1dPYZVaa	Probably because size 6 is too small for them to conceptualise- size 6 is tiny! my 11 yr old daughter is  a size 8 ( but then she is taller than you)<br>  <br>  Don't spend so much time thinking about how others see you looking- why do you care? Try some deeper thinking or do something useful to others with your time- less self focus might help you value yourself by what you do rather than how you look!|`|771aacf2f768bc76138476f792d8ae83aa	Forget about size and concentrate on your looks.<br>  Depending on where she shops my wife can go from a size 16 to a size 20 and at 66 she still looks great.|`|M5oDWsLPaa	it is probably because u are curvy most curvy girls are perspected as bigger than they actually are|`|h3VqVwbQaa	I have no clue, maybe u have huge breasts?|`|xqQO81Omaa	What are your actual measurements? Perhaps it's because they imagine a size 6 as skin and bones but you still have curves as you are petite. Some people think of the 5ft10 catwalk models when they think of a size 6, they forget about the petite girls who are just naturally small.<br>  <br>  I'm the same height as you, but wearing a UK size 10.....I'd hate to imagine what size your friends would think I was!|`|QkL7PcJHaa	don't worry, it could be your body shape, or your just being paranoid, and people lie, when i was anorexic a fat girl said i looked size 16 lol.
rpnFxnCQaa	I know how you feel. I had anxiety attacks when I had to speak in public. Or when there would be more than a few people around me in the same room. It was something that started when I was a teenager and that lasted over years and subsequently affected my career until not so long ago. <br>  <br>  At some point, I was prescribed medicine but I wanted to avoid that too(because of side effects). That's when I discovered a program that literally pulled me out of that "hole". It is a 100% natural method. The main key here is that you should no longer fear the thought of anxiety. You have to get out of/break that loop. Not only did that cure me - you become your true self again - but I was also extremely surprised to even discover newly built self-confidence. It is<br>  <a href="http://www.stop-your-anxiety-now.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.stop-your-anxiety-now.com</a><br>  <br>  There is always a solution! Get out of the anxiety loop!<br>  <br>  All the best|`|70sjdbzyaa	i suffer from anxiety also and hate it ive lost so many girls because of it and is now controlling my life your not the only one but it will get better try to get the right meds and make sure you like your therapist and feel comfortable with him as this can be one of your main supports keep looking until you find the right one and feel like you can tell him anything.<br>  if you want send me a message maybe we can talk some thanks. nd dont worry =D|`|OgaJqkSQaa	I've also been dealing with this for almost a decade and I have no life. Anxiety takes the pleasure out of everything. I can't do most things because of it, and the things I can do are so difficult they're not worth doing.<br>  If you're about to start meds this could be a turning point for you. When I was on meds I was sooo much better. I can't tolerate medication though, and react badly to eveything from antids to antibiotics. Shame, because I'd go back on them tomorrow if I could.<br>  <br>  I really hope you get good results from the zoloft. Lexapro is also good for anxiety.|`|jcL7gDMKaa	Ok, first of all anxiety isnt going to go away by itself, as your therapist may have said to you, you need to work on the CBT (cognitive behavoural therapy) , I am unsure of what exactly causes your anxiety (whether it is generalised or social anxiety) but the medication needs to be accompanied by your WILL TO BEAT IT!! It takes allot of courage to fight your fears. I suffered from severe social anxiety for almost 2 years and it is still with me from time to time but you can control it. Something simple like walking to the store would require the courage of jumping of a cliff at times and it takes allot of determination to make yourself do it but the mind is a very powerful thing and it is a case of mind over matter. Focus on being relaxed as much as you can with breathing exercises or listening to soft music. This all makes a huge difference.|`|zeTGmB3faa	It's obvious that you're upset!  Good that you are getting help. Your meds will take approx 3 weeks to kick in. Perhaps the doctor will give you a small dose of Xanax to get you through until the Zoloft kicks in. <br>  Anxiety is really miserable but it can be helped. If a med doesn't help, tell your doctor right away. You are your best advocate. But take an adult approach and try not to act like an angry young lady towards the doctors, they want a success story too.

AA10766729	At this late date, I'd just hold off till Sunday, start a new pack then, and use backup contraception for the whole pack.

72c3b924e93e85f5493bc3f07051afb4aa	Unfortunately, your wrists can really only be as big as your bones.  There's really nothing but tendons near your wrist and they really do not get much bigger even with strenuous weight training.  This is why we measure wrists for body composition and types.<br>  <br>  For your forearms there are a number of exercises to do to increase size and strength.  To answer your question, you want high-weight, fewer reps.<br>  <br>  I used to take a free weight and tie a rope around it.  Then I'd connect the rope to something that you can easily wind up and down.  Then I'd stand with my arms straight out and twist the rope all the way up lifting the weight over and over.<br>  <br>  Try investing in some grip strengtheners too.<br>  <br>  Check out this site:<br>  <a href="http://www.exrx.net/Lists/ExList/ForeArmWt.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.exrx.net/Lists/ExList/ForeArm...</a>|`|Z2TJbrKeaa	you should do heavy weight low reps with your forearms,they are used to moving a lot during regular activity anyway.|`|o6FM4vEraa	Work out and take protein, it is needed to build muscle mass!|`|fTztIC22aa	hammer curls will not make your forearms and wrists look bigger. Buy a set of grippers from the heavy grippers brand or captains of crush and use those twice a week and also wrist curls or rope twists will help you with your wrists and forearms|`|VtqdeSQ8aa	I'm not sure there is a name for this one. I learned it from my hubby who has popeye forearms.<br>  <br>  You hold a weight in your palms with them facing upwards. Your arms are in bicep curl position with your elbows bent and at your sides, forearms straight out, palms up. Ok, now CAREFULLY tilt the backs of your hands down to the floor so that the weight rolls to the end of your slightly upward curled fingertips. Without letting the weight fall (and break your toes!) wrap your fingers around it and curl your hand back up to starting position while squeezing. You will feel it in your forearms. I hope this make sense when you try it b/c it works.
KAnEq8Laaa	Like most fast-food offerings, this one is not healthy. I just looked up the nutrition information on their site; the one with 400 calories, or thereabouts, is the large; in addition to the calories, it also has 105 grams of carbs, which is about half, or slightly less, of the number that the average person needs on a daily basis. So, in general, if you're eating a treat that is loaded with half a day's worth of say, calories, or carbohydrates, it's probably not the best thing for you. As an occasional indulgence, sure, go ahead. It probably tastes pretty good.<br>  <br>  If you're trying to kick the caffeine habit, there are probably better ways to kill the appetite for soda or coffee or whatever it is you're jonesing for, and you can accomplish the same thing with a smaller investment in calories and carbs, less or even no sugar, and even some healthy benefits. For example, decaffeinated green tea is so ridiculously good for you it's not even funny. Likewise decaf black tea. There are decaf versions of many sodas, like Coke, that taste surprisingly lifelike, if soda's your bag. Or, you could get some sugarless gum, or sugarless candy (i.e., those little fruit flavored hard pieces of candy for diabetic people).<br>  <br>  On the other hand, if this is the only really "bad" thing that you consume in a day once in a great while, and you work out vigorously for an hour the same day you have the beverage, and otherwise eat a healthy, balanced diet, then it really makes no difference. But to answer your question, no, it's not healthy.|`|dUj7rP2haa	I'm not a big fan of juice because you get calories with no fiber... therefor you don't get filled up.  You could likely have one of these from time to time without too much harm but it doesn't sound like you're just having them occasionally and 400 cals each could add up in a hurry.
gkqmrIAGaa	It could be harmless palpitations caused by stress but nobody can diagnose you on this site. When it comes to your heart you have to be expecially careful. You need to see your doctor and if it is stress he will prescribe an anti-anxity medication if he feels you need it. He will first want to check out your heart to be certain.  I can't believe you're schedule and how you are able to keep it up.  You certainly should be proud of yourself!!

Unless you are very tall and 80 pounds or something, you shouldn't really be worrying about your weight. Unless it's mandatory, but even then, is it worth it? Try laying off exercises, and as for getting weight in certain area, I don't think it's that easy. It all depends on your metabolism and what you eat (energy foods, healthy foods, fatty foods.) If it isn't necessary, don't stress about your weight.|`|g4B66YqPaa	awww....! well you can have: chocolate, pizza, fast food, candy, ice cream, chip, bread, pasta, and carbs r good 2 gain weight! hope i helped n dont gain 2much weight!
fM3rUTzEaa	There are a lot of people who firmly believe conditions like autism are simply a difference and not a disease or disability- it's just a different personality. Groups have picketed autism clinics where children have been brought to be "cured". It comes down to how you view it personally. Interesting to think about- there is so much research done to find cures for these things, but is it even something that we want to cure? A lot of these conditions didn't exist until very recently. Of course people still had them in the past, but they weren't diagnosed and therefore weren't labelled as such. A notable example is Einstein, said to have been mildly autistic, and also Bill Gates is thought to have a form of aspergers.|`|ZaLrtSd7aa	It's not difference they're concerned about, it's disability. For instance Asperger's or autism lite as I like to think of it, can function but may need extra resources.

3sszFQd5aa	Do not change the amount of Wellbutrin you are taking without consulting your doctor. If he was the one to prescribe it, he knows how much you are on and has already factored that into his decision of what dose of Lorezapan to prescribe.<br>  <br>  That said, Lorezapam is a very good anti-anxiety medication; it will "bring me back" when ever I fly off the handle or have severe anxiety. I am prescribed to take it as-needed and do not always take the pills daily. I do always take it when I fly as I hate being at airports and on airplanes. One pill normally last six - eight hours for me, and I have been told I can take up to four pills a day. Usually, a half pill is enough to curb my anxiety; a whole pill normally knocks me out.<br>  <br>  There are days I need to take a pill every four - six hours if things are bothering me enough. Then there are weeks where I don't open the pill bottle. It all depends on what is going on with my life.<br>  <br>  I would start by taking a half pill before your trip to see how it effects you. That may be plenty and then you won't "zombify" yourself when you travel. Explain your concern to your doctor and ask what is the largest amount you can safely take in a day (I know you said 2-3 per day, but depending on your body size, it may be safe to take more in extremely stressful situations). I have included a link for more information on the drug and its interactions.|`|hNaT2PRqaa	G'day,<br>  <br>  How rare, I bloody well take Lorazepam & Wellbutrin SR, 450 MG Daily. I did not like the XL, so I asked my doctor to put me back on the SR Version. I take 1 MG 4 times daily and 1 mG at night of Lorazepam (Generic for Ativan) .... .05 is such a low dose, did not help me. I am a combat veteran with PTSD & Depression. I have been on these medications long term, and they both work great, the secret, if you want to call it that is to try and take the Lorazepam at the same times every day, that way your blood level will have a steady level of the meds, don't give up, see your doctor for advice, but it works for me, stops anxiety attacks ... good look|`|bvoZZY3uaa	Lorazepam is very good for anxiety, the tablets do take an hour or two to work, most people take 1 or 2mg, they do stop working if you take them every day, but they should be fine for what you need them for, they make some people feel tired and sleepy.|`|EIrdLq6Zaa	You are taking the wellbutrin for either recently quitting smoking or most likely depression. Lorazepam is a great drug to to combat anxiety. It is in the same group as xanax and klonopin. It will calm you down and possibly help you to fall asleep. I take clonazepam (klonopin) for anxiety attacks and for sleeping when I need to really chill down. It works great. I would suggest taking one the night before you fly out to calm your nerves and another in the morning or when you get on the plane. Make sure you leave them in the original bottle!! Bring them with you so that if you need it while you're away you'll have them. Put them in your carry on not in your suitcase. Also-<br>  if you are staying in the states and your prescription has refills, any pharmacy can call where you had the original filled to get a copy of the rx to have it refilled.  Relax and enjoy- it will definitely help, hope I did.
qV8bM94Taa	No your eyes won't get crossed if you don't wear your prescription glasses. All that may happen to your eyes is that your vision gets worse. So I would still recommend wearing your prescription glasses even though you can't get unfocused or crossed eyes. Glasses can also help if you already have crossed eyes. But people usually get crossed eyes by the muscles in your eye not working correctly.

If you don't have any other major complaints besides your moods, and no one else has other complaints about your behavior, you probably shouldn't obsess about it too much. It's quirky, but people have episodes of stuff like that and it goes away and you might never know what it was about. If you are seeing someone already though, you should definitely bring it up.

2qPtGTNcaa	Acne is caused by bacteria in combination with oil. First, open the pores of your skin with a medium hot shower. Then, dry off and apply a clay mask to bring the impurities closer to the surface. Then, after it dries, go back into the shower to open the pores back up again. Now, here's the part that works. Apply lemon juice to each outbreak. This is what kills the bacteria that causes acne. Rinse with warm, then cold water.|`|WjESRTiKaa	Acne and its treatment<br>  <br>  Acne is a menace. However, it’s not something that cannot be tackled. There are loads of acne skin care <br>  <br>  products around. We can classify acne skin care products into 3 broad categories – <br>  * Preventive or general acne skin care products<br>  * Over-the-counter, specialised acne skin care products <br>  * On-prescription acne skin care products. <br>  <br>  The general acne skin care products are the ones that are used as acne-prevention measure. These include <br>  <br>  cleansers, make-up removers and similar products that help prevent acne. In the real sense, these acne <br>  <br>  skin care products are just those that should anyway be part of your daily routine. However, some of <br>  <br>  these are more oriented to act like an acne skin care product. These acne skin care products act against <br>  <br>  the causes of acne e.g. limiting the production of sebum/oil and preventing clogging of skin pores. <br>  <br>  Basically, these acne skin care products prevent the oil from getting trapped in pores and hence hamper <br>  <br>  the growth of bacteria that lead to acne. The general acne skin care products also include exfoliation <br>  <br>  products like skin peels. These work towards removing dead skin cells, hence reducing the possibility of <br>  <br>  pore-clogging and bacteria development.<br>  <br>  Then there are specialised acne skin care products that are available over-the-counter i.e. without the <br>  <br>  need of a prescription. These include products like vanishing creams which extract the extra oil from the <br>  <br>  skin. Most of these acne skin care products are based on benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid, both of <br>  <br>  which are the enemies of bacteria (and hence acne). You should start with a product that has lower <br>  <br>  concentration of benzoyl peroxide (e.g. 5%) and see how your skin responds to it.  Alpha-hydroxy-acid <br>  <br>  based moisturizers are also popular as acne skin care products. You might have to try a few, before you <br>  <br>  zero-in on the acne skin care product that is effective for you. If nothing seems to work, you should <br>  <br>  contact a dermatologist. <br>  <br>  On-prescription acne skin care products are the ones that are prescribed by a dermatologist. This can <br>  <br>  include ointments that can be applied on the affected area or oral antibiotics or just any topical treatment. <br>  <br>  Dermatologist could also suggest a minor surgical procedure to remove the contents of pustules.  <br>  <br>  However, never try to squeeze or do this by yourself, it can lead to permanent damage of your skin.  Your <br>  <br>  doctor could also prescribe a hormone-based treatment (since hormonal changes are also known to cause <br>  <br>  acne). Such acne skin care products are known to be very effective in some cases.<br>  So, with all those acne skin care products, tackling acne is not that difficult.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.lifespecial.com/noacneforever.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lifespecial.com/noacneforever...</a>|`|iSq59UJqaa	You should use 'Clindamycin phosphate tropical solution 1%'.

There's no evidence at all of this, other than unsubstantiated claims.  I'm sure you can find volumes of pseudoscience on the topic, but why bother?  This is just something that sort of sounds like a neat idea and some people want to believe in it.  No harm in it.  But what's the point?  think about it, there's 6 billion people on the planet now, when 2000 years ago there were maybe a few hundred million.  So not everyone today could be reincarnated, which means that "souls" can be created.  If that's the case, what's the need for reincarnation?  It's nonsense.

I had that kind of painful joints once also.  It went away on it's own.

It's a personal choice really. try both and see what you find more comfortable to use. <br>  <br>  but if you find it difficult inserting them, your better off with the cardboard ones, they are softer than the plastic (obviously) so i'd say the cardboard has a few more up sides than plastic applicators... but again as ive already said... its a personal choice, whatever your more comfortable with :)|`|QAN5OxWIaa	plastic!!!|`|1d9TrIKCaa	omg plastic....cardboard is annoying, and plastico is easier to slide in and out....have fun with ur peroid!|`|vSKmRuOeaa	it really is a personal choice.<br>  <br>  I would choose plastic its easiest to learn with and it smooth and in my opinion more comfy.<br>  <br>  put cardboard has its pros like being flush-able<br>  <br>  either works fine though.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!

Also, drink lots of water, and eat meat. it could be that your body is missing some minerals like iron and that could be making you feel sleepy. but see a doctor, you could have anemia, hypoglycemia, Epstein-Barr virus, mononucleosis, Lyme disease because they all make you feel tired.|`|UFYOzP41aa	SEE A DOC!|`|WxoZrTPlaa	Yes, that's too much sleeping.

See the following link.  <a href="http://www.foreskin.org/frenulum.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.foreskin.org/frenulum.htm</a><br>  <br>  If a small part of your foreskin seems to be still attached and does not look like it will ever detach go back to your doctor for advice.<br>  <br>  It's normal for your penis head to look purplish and for it to be very sensitive at first.  The sensitivity should reduce over time.|`|OWOtKZmgaa	stretch the skin when you shower and its more soft and supple,you can get more of that cream and try it again and of course masturbating and moving it as much as you can is a good thing to do.there is a little tool on the internet that stretches it as well google it you should get a world wide dealer who sells it.|`|Ldy7mNHKaa	Everyones penis head is purple-ish.

9735d5833f65114f4de1c4472750fa51aa	I am so sorry to hear about your nephew.  The others are right, that it could be anything (RSV, pneumonia, infection, asthma, the list goes on and on), but I wanted to throw another option out there anyway.  <br>  <br>  I was in your shoes a few years ago only with my own baby daughter.  Only 8 days old at the time, she was initially hospitalized for not wanting to eat, weight loss, and dehydration.  Two days later, weird labs (extremely low sodium and severe anemia) showed up, so she was transferred to a children's hospital.  Within days, she was on complete life support, and nobody knew why.  They did test after test after test, and nothing showed up.  At first, they did not even know which body system was causing her trouble, just that it was getting worse each day.  It wasn't until she had progressed to severe respiratory failure and CT showed that her lungs were dense as liver that they even knew it was her lungs.  Her x-rays were not that bad at first but eventually progressed to complete white-out.  I was also told repeatedly that her lungs did not sound bad, only a little diminished and that it did not make sense for her to be as sick as she was.  At almost 3 weeks old, based on her condition, blood gases, and continued decline despite everything  they were doing, her doctors had "the talk" with me, and I was told that she was doing very poorly and that her survival was unlikely.  She had been considered even for ECMO (heart-lung bypass machine), but they had decided that even it would not be able to save her.  She ended up having an open lung biopsy as a last ditch effort to save her at 3 weeks old, and she was diagnosed with interstitial lung disease.  I was not given very hopeful information about her future, but thankfully they were able to start treatment, and at a month old, she got off the ventilator.  At a year old, she got off oxygen during the day.  And at 2 1/2 years old, she got off entirely.  At 3 1/2 years, she has recently been put back on oxygen at night, but overall, she is doing alright.  <br>  <br>  I tell you this not to scare you, but to hopefully give you at least some shred of hope.  Hang in there.  You and your family are in my thoughts.

It depends on what happened before this.|`|DtG4zpM2aa	Sorry to hear about this...I can't imagine how upsetting and worrying this must be for you and the rest of your family.  <br>  <br>  There a couple of possibilities that I can think of as to what may have caused your nephew's illness.   Either it could be some form of severe infection, the medical term for this is sepsis - where the results of an infection can affect many of the systems in the body including the breathing and circulation...sometimes with this someone can get very unwell very rapidly.   Or it could be caused by a endocrine or metabolic condition - this can cause imbalances in the normal chemicals the body needs to function, and sometimes these conditions can present like dehydration initially, until a blood test picks up on the abnormality.  But without knowing further information, these are really just guesses. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately it does happen sometimes that a patient can obviously be very unwell, and it isn't quite clear what caused the illness to begin with.  I'm sure the doctors and nurses involved are doing the best they can for your nephew.|`|wLkNfc2xaa	Cant help to diagnose the problem as this happened to my baby when he was four months old.............he'd dehydrated n became very limp, weak and motionless.

Nobody, even a qualified MD, can make a diagnosis on YA. I'm a Paramedic and I know what emergency treatment to initiate whilst we get the child to hospital, and I also know that no Doctor will give a diagnosis until he or she is certain - this has to do with professional ethics, not potential lawsuits.<br>  <br>  If an MD gave you a list of possible illnesses that the child could have, all you could do is sit and worry about it, and spend the night asking 'what if? what if?'<br>  <br>  Your nephew is in good hands. No medical professional will neglect him. <br>  <br>  Have a gin, and sleep if you can.|`|Y4ogWjHOaa	Hi Whitewave,<br>  <br>  There are 218 different causes of dehydration. It would be pointless trying to just guess what the cause is in this case so until all the necessary tests have been done it is impossible to know. <br>  <br>  There is no way that a doctor would guess at a diagnosis because that could well lead to the patient being given the totally wrong treatment and possibly worsen the condition.<br>  <br>  I know it is hard when you are waiting to know but they do know what they are doing and everything they are doing or not doing at this time is forr a very good reason.<br>  <br>  I do hope he is better soon.<br>  <br>  love Mel.X
syC3uQpjaa	Determine your daily calorie intake . Losing weight is simply a matter of expending more calories than you take in, through exercise and your daily activities. To win the battle, it helps to know how many calories you are consuming in a day. <br>  Write down all the things you eat on a typical day. Carry a small notebook with you and write down every snack, every drink, and the contents of every meal. There are also great websites that you can use to keep track of calories, get recipes, and help achieve your goal. Don't forget to include the pats of butter or the spoonful of sugar in your coffee. It's best to do this for at least a couple weekdays and a weekend; it's even better if you can go a full week. There are also calorie tracking websites that can help you to do this, for example the US government website, My Pyramid Tracker. <br>  Do an itemized calorie count. When possible, write down the number of calories in each thing you eat as you eat it. Keep in mind that the recommended serving size is often considerably smaller than the serving you actually eat. Look up the calorie count on the internet for foods that don't have calories listed on the container or for fast food meals. You don't have to be 100% accurate, but you do want a good estimate of the number of calories you're taking in. There is an idea that multiplying your own weight by ten will produce a rough estimate of the number of calories you need to eat per day to maintain your weight. This is NOT true, you may wind up grossly under (or perhaps over) estimating the number of calories you should be eating. Use a scientific or health website to determine the number of calories you should eat a day or consult your doctor. Everyone has different metabolisms and there is no blanket rule that covers everyone's recommended calorie intake. Reducing 500 calories per day from the calories you eat to maintain your weight can help you lose a pound of fat per week.[2] <br>  Go over the list and decide which foods to cut out or reduce. Cutting calories is usually a lot easier than you might think. For example, that daily tall latte in the morning may pack 500 calories. Since a pound of flab (lost or gained) is roughly equivalent to 3,500 calories, replacing that rich beverage with black coffee can help you lose a pound a week. Other easy cuts include salad dressing (salad dressing is the number one source of fat in the average American woman's diet) soda pop, candy, and butter. Look at the nutritional information for the foods you eat, pay special attention to your intake of saturated fats and empty calories (high-sugar foods). You don't need to cut these things out entirely, but if you reduce your intake of high-fat, high-calorie foods you'll lose weight faster. <br>  Seek out alternatives to the unhealthy foods you've identified. You can simply reduce the amount of soda you drink or mayonnaise you put on your sandwiches, or you can substitute healthier choices. Drink water instead of soda, for example, or use mustard instead of mayo. Low-fat and low-calorie options are also available for most foods, and many of these are natural, (although some are made with strange chemicals), and tasty. Start trying to eat healthy in most meals:<br>  <br>  <br>  Choose lean meats. Chicken and fish are both very low in fat (and certain fish like salmon, sardines, and fresh tuna are an excellent source of antioxidants, which are also beneficial to your health), so aim to replace some or all of the beef or pork in your diet with these foods. <br>  Replace high-calorie side dishes with healthier alternatives. Many people get a ton of calories from side dishes such as macaroni and cheese, French fries, or potato salad. You can eat healthier and lose weight by replacing these with fresh vegetables and salads. Pre-made salads are practically effortless, and when accompanied by a reduced-calorie dressing or no dressing at all, they're weight-loss gold. <br>  Start your days off right. A fattening breakfast of bacon and eggs or a pastry can be replaced with yogurt, oatmeal, high-fiber, low-sugar cereals; or fresh fruit for fruit smoothies. However, for those on a low carb diet bacon and eggs are a great combo for breakfast, since neither have carbs. But don't fall into the trap of skipping breakfast. Eating a healthy breakfast increases your rest metabolic rate earlier in the day, and reduces snacking before lunch. <br>  Plan your meals. Look for healthy, delicious meals online or in your cookbooks, and create a menu for the week. Make sure that your meal plan reduces your total calorie intake: you're not going to lose weight if you consume the same amount of calories by eating different foods. Make a list of what you'll need for these meals, and -- except for a few snacks, of course -- don't stray from your list when you get to the market. Planning your meals helps ensure you get a balanced diet and reduces the temptation to stop off for fast food or order a pizza. Remember, it's easier to stick to your shopping|`|GiYVrmI3aa	Eat 4 small meals a day that limit sugar and carb intake and exercise 3 to 5 days a week. You can't do one or the other you have to do both or you won't see as good results.
YbEQ8Wv5aa	It's spelled schizophrenia and if you google it, you'll get tons of websites with information, symptoms and things like that.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure if you're just saying you hear things IN your head, but that's normal. Schizophrenic people hear voices as if they were actual people talking, not just in their heads. Hallucinations, like seeing people that aren't there or having a distorted view of reality is also a symptom of schizophrenia.|`|29e999153715416dcc6bab042f16f0c4aa	If these "voices," are just your inner monolouge then there is nothing to to be worried about. If these voices sound real as if someone was in the same room talking to you then that may be a sign that something is wrong. <br>  <br>  I on the other hand do hear voices. Sometimes they insult me, sometimes they order me to do things, sometimes they are just mumbling and I cannot understand them at all. It gets bad when you have no control over your own mind. However, if you are concerned you should still see someone about it anyways. You never know what it could be.|`|jXwHiAaWaa	hey<br>  <br>  well, what you describe could be the start of it, however you can't just say you have it now as schizophrenia can't be diagnosed till 6 months of symptoms have occured. there are also other symptoms.<br>  <br>  a great site which i use a lot to learn about the illness is <a href="http://www.schizophrenia.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.schizophrenia.com</a><br>  <br>  what you describe might actually be psychosis or stress-induced or because of something else, perhaps along with a mood disorder. you'll find all the info on that link i gave you.<br>  <br>  honestly click it, it's so informative.<br>  <br>  if you're really worried i'd go and see a doctor if it's not bothering you that much (but they seem to say positive things so maybe it isn't!) and especially if they make you do things to harm yourself or others.<br>  <br>  hope that helped x
6dQzmsXuaa	Yes good for health but not more than 3 cups in a day, I think.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	check the water you drink .mate .. its got stuff in it .. not the tea or coffee .. i can tell you ....|`|g7uMKvEzaa	I am not sure , but I think the only way it will hurt you is if you are allergic to it.. I know many  people that lived past 90 yrs old and still have their cups of coffee daily.<br>  I actually get rapid heart beat from it,,,So I don't do coffee. I feel like a heart attack brewing if I do. It does keep ya awake..but it might give ya the jitters...GOOD LUCK!|`|dUj7rP2haa	All things in moderation.  If you are having one or two cups as day then  it's fine. But if the tea isn't helping the coffee probably won't either.  You might have hyper-sonmina (the proper name for the opposite of insomnia).   My husband was treated for it a couple of years ago.  You need to speak to your doctor and likely go though a sleep study to be properly diagnosed.|`|JRKJ1w3Zaa	2-3 cups a day I recommend.<br>  <br>  coffee can be beneficial but harming if used wrong.<br>  <br>  don't frequently sleep like 5-6 hours a night and then go out and drink loads of coffee.<br>  <br>  it can be bad for your body and energy level come the end of the day.|`|Lqy9Lc9Oaa	I am the opposite of insomnia too LOL I know what you mean.  You should mention it to your doctor.  You could have a low vitamin like B12 (I did and it felt awful)<br>  <br>  p.s.  anything in moderation - 2 or 3 cups a day?  not bad.|`|UtRjy7Isaa	There have been pesticide problems with coffee since the 60's so drinking coffee every day is not a good idea unless it is certified organic and fair trade certified.<br>  <br>  "Fair Trade Certified, Shade Grown, and Certified Organic is what I look for on the label.  If just certified organic, then it is fine.  If it has all three on the label,then I have a high quality product for everyone's benefit.<br>  <br>  Then, and only then, is it safe to drink every day, but you must drink it after you have had your breakfast or the bulk of our breakfast.  That's because you don't want to cause adrenal exhaustion from the caffeine on an empty stomach.   Adrenal exhaustion is over exertion from adrenal glands that produce an excess of adrenalin from caffein and can cause weight gain.<br>  <br>  Just one satisfying rich cup from coffee beans you grind on your own is so satisfying that you don't want anymore throughout the day.  <br>  <br>  Certified Organic can of coffee beans 8.99 at the least and a coffee grinder, about 10 dollars at the least, costs less than a weeks worth of Star Bucks, which is about 35 to 50 dollars, and your own coffee lasts one person 2 to 3 weeks for less than 20 bucks.|`|IGYa2yF6aa	Coffee isn't unhealthy, but this doesn't sound like a problem that coffee can cure. Something is going on with your body that you should probably check out. Getting 8 hours of sleep at night is optimum, so that part's fine. But sleeping 4 hours in the afternoon and then feeling sleepy again early at night isn't good. It's some type of sleep disturbance which could be caused by a variety of things like anemia or stress. Before trying to self-medicate with coffee, see your doctor. There may be a better way to fix this.|`|LfhgqgYuaa	I wish i had your problem! lol<br>  <br>  What i would recomend is drinking the coffee when you are starting to get tired.<br>  But make sure it has caffene in it!|`|cv3IZnMiaa	I would recomend 2-3 cups a day but it is very unhealthy  :(|`|M5oDWsLPaa	i don't think it is healthy it is full of caffeine and too much can make you mentally disorder|`|RGG30rbkaa	Is that a trick question ...

First of these foods is often chocolate. Chocolate fights depression and give us a peaceful sensation almost immediately. It’s rich in minerals and vitamins but very caloric. The chocolate diet includes some controlled absorptions during the day that will help you to have that delicious feeling and lose weight at the same time.<br>  <br>  There is no question here of taking chocolate, pasta and pop corns every day but of healthy balanced menus for two weeks containing an unstopping variety of foods: dairy products, fruits and vegetables, starchy foods, meat and fish, etc.<br>  <br>  The principle is to play on the light but by agreeing chocolate and a small pleasure sometimes to hold over the duration and not to feel frustrations. It promises between 2 and 6 pounds a week according to the weight to lose.
2ndiCI2qaa	The rule of thumb is 30 days to pass no matter the amount you intake. I think you would pass today to be honest with you, but, the day of the test Id recommend you drink lotsa water or cranberry juice and make sure you start early in am so you go a few times before test time!

ParFJxnSaa	Possible rapid cycling bipolar disorder: A previous answer follows: See section 10, on bipolar disorder, at ezy build, below, and take the quiz, if unsure, and if the results are positive, ensure you get an expert diagnosis from a mental health professional, not doctors, who are much better dealing with physical ailments, and don't diagnose complex disorders like bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and borderline personality disorder often enough to develop any real expertise. <br>  <br>            Bipolar disorder usually involves major mood swings, which occur without apparent cause, and often over many months, or a matter of years, rather than days, as with most people (unless rapid cycling). Take 4 Omega 3 fish oil supplements, daily: (certified free of mercury) it is best if consumed with an antioxidant, such as an orange, or grapefruit, or their FRESHLY SQUEEZED juice. If vitamin E is added, it should be certified as being 100% from natural sources, or it may be synthetic: avoid it. More about this on page R, in section 2.<br>  <br>           If you decide to use allopathy, (modern Western medicine) I recommend trying Lithium Carbonate, or Lithium Citrate. (regular tests are necessary, for these) before trying the other mood stabilisers, but if you aren't good at taking medications regularly, drinking adequate water, and keeping up your salt intake, something else, such as  Lamictal,  or Depakote, may suit you better. Check out "lithium"  at <a href="http://www.drugs.com/," rel="nofollow">http://www.drugs.com/,</a> and <a href="http://crazymeds.us/" rel="nofollow">http://crazymeds.us/</a> and always research medications first, there, and at <a href="http://www.rxlist.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rxlist.com/</a> & <a href="http://www.askapatient.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.askapatient.com/</a> (read, and keep the labels/information sheets) so you will be aware of the risks, and on the lookout for side effects. Personally, if I wasn't bipolar type 1, and didn't experience hallucinations, or serious delusional states, I know I'd first try the orthomolecular, and Omega 3 fish oil supplements, vitamins, minerals; a herbal remedy, and a mostly raw food diet, for several months. Note: St. John's wort, and also antidepressants, may trigger mania, or hypomania, in people with bipolar disorder. I'd aso eat in accordance with my "nutritional type". Enter that term in the searchbar at <a href="http://www.mercola.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mercola.com/</a>  <br>  <br>           If not considerably improved, after a maximum of 6 months trial period, consult your primary mental health care provider: you may be one of those who need medications to prevent this serious disorder from worsening.  If you have bipolar type 1, an antipsychotic medication will probably be required. Everyone should take the Omega 3 supplements, or preferably "krill oil" for its other health benefits: use the searchbar at <a href="http://www.mercola.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mercola.com/</a> (also enter "diabetes; type 2") Some people refuse medication, using supplements, and a selective, mostly raw food diet (I do not recommended trying this, if bipolar 1, unless you aren't troubled by hallucinations, or delusional states). There are various types, and degrees of severity with bipolar disorder, and although many people with the milder versions can get by without medication, using the alternative treatments, those whose disorder in more serious, really would benefit from taking it.

Probably because of my sex drive.<br>  <br>  However, I tried exercising and dieting but nothing seemed to be working.  I thought I was screwed.  I then found something just as amazing as the vibrator.<br>  <br>  My friend at work told me about this stuff she took to raise her sex drive.  It was a natural herbal supplement and was I lucky to of found it.  Theres no side effects and the sex drive is just tremendous along with orgasms that are blasting.  The stuff is called Hersolution pills.  At the time I saved money on them at herenhancement.com<br>  <br>  What I did was tried out for 3 months and that was really it.  I found taking them every other day or so was the best to stretch it out. After the months were up, I was back to normal with a beating sex drive and my orgasm strength in increased so much.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and I hope this helps.|`|1gnNDagMaa	yes, it sounds like u have depression.|`|TilqqjNMaa	I would see a doctor.<br>  Fatigue is a common sympthom for many, many things.<br>  Some not so serious but some are very serious.<br>  Only a doctor can find out the real reason behind your lack of energy.<br>  Get in to make sure it is nothing serious!<br>  Plus, don't you want to feel yourself again already?!|`|ivo8MqLZaa	No it might be just your way of handling stress and you're probably in a new phase of your life and maybe confused.

If that is not you,maybe you are sick, maybe mentally of physically. I am not calling you crazy by saying mentally,but I know after watching this woman who was like speed eating hot dogs on tv I could not eat for two whole days, it was so gross I threw up and couldn't eat, So maybe in your mind something happened and it made you think food is nasty. I know when I get sick I cannot eat for days because my stomach just won't take it. When I go to school in the morning something as simple as toast can make me throw up and this is why I can't eat breakfast. You might want to go to a doctor, maybe they can help you out because I know I am not a doctor ( : You might have something wrong with your tummy and really should get it checked out. I don't know your history but if there was that anorexic and or bulimic thing you had, maybe it is coming back, or maybe if you think about it maybe it is now forming in your mind to do it. When it comes to something like your body I would always recommend to go to the doctor because who knows? it just might be something serious.

2aqB52Q8aa	feeling good... haha|`|ot0WW8lZaa	Depends how many milligrams and your tolerance. But three of any type of Xanny shouldn't be dangerous. I would hardly consider 3 pills a large amount though. In fact, I'm pretty sure that that might even be prescribed in some cases.|`|7Vi8k2TMaa	Depends on the dosage. Since you're asking a question like this, I imagine it's probably either a .25 or a .50 mg x how many times a day.<br>  <br>  <br>  Taking three wouldn't hurt you, and you're feel pretty relaxed and maybe even a little careless. However, be extremely careful about taking high doses and having to stop due to running out. <br>  <br>  I take xanax for social phobia, 1mg three times a day. For awhile, I was taking up to 6mg  because I liked the feeling and I was enjoying the ease of being around people. But, I obviously ran out before I could refill and had a seizure within 3 days off coming off of it. <br>  <br>  6mg is a big difference from 1.5 as you described, but just beware of the potential withdrawal problems. I take 4mg of Xanax XR now and it's not as quick, but it lasts all day and easier to resists taking more than needed.
M59kqWKhaa	Go to the drugstore and get some "moleskin".  It is a protective type bandaid kind of covering which will protect the blisters and keep them from breaking open.  If they do open, use something like Neosporin on them to avoid infection.  There is another product I really like -- Chae Organics Thera-P Relief Gel.  (See reference)  It's kinda pricey but worth it.<br>  <br>  Using the moleskin when you first notice someplace rubbing will keep blisters from forming in the future.|`|be52fc0d175d76bbbfd17b8117a2d632aa	I know everyone says you shouldn't pop them but I always do. I've tried leaving them and they just hurt for days. If I pop them they heal and the pain is gone by the next day. Taking some painkillers and putting some antiseptic cream on them may help. Put some plasters on them if you have to walk as this will stop them rubbing and will pad them a bit. Try to walk as little as possible and wear loose shoes and socks.|`|onySROuhaa	Once you've got them theres not much you can do but let them heal.  Try and avoid any rubbing or chaffing of the area because that will prevent them from healing and keep breaking them open.  When you aren't walking and are at home let them air out so that they can heal and form scabs.<br>  As for the pain, take some advil.

bmWKETgWaa	There are little lubrication glands just inside your vagina.  Evidently they are becoming active now that you're becoming mature.  <br>  <br>  What to do?  You can trim some of the hair down underneath a bit shorter with scissors, so it won't hold moisture.  You can tuck some folded toilet paper (three or four squares altogether) between the inner lips of your vaginal opening.  When you urinate, it will drop away, and after you wipe, you can start with new paper.  (Don't use Kleenex -- it can clog up plumbing because it isn't designed to dissolve.)  You can wear a thin pad with wings inside your panties. <br>  <br>  Pay particular attention to that area when you bathe or shower.|`|xHxUCs1Haa	its nothing to look forward to a period lol<br>  ermm.<br>  well i got this for about 2 years before i started my period and i still get it now!<br>  just make sure you have some pads ready in the house<br>  you could start now or when your 18 nobody knows and theres no way to predict it.<br>  <br>  just keep yourself clean.<br>  id reccommend aqous cream<br>  its meant to just be rubbed on dry skin <br>  but you can use it as soap for you bits :)<br>  its really good and gets rid of any uneasy smells.<br>  <br>  change your underwear like when you get home from school before you go out and like before you go to bed.<br>  :)<br>  this'll stop it smelling ?|`|EnYLhQajaa	Discharge is the way of cleaning the vagina.

But in some cases, your doctor may prescribe an antiviral medication such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) or zanamivir (Relenza).<br>  <br>  These drugs, which treat both influenza A and B, work by deactivating an enzyme the virus needs to grow and spread. If taken soon after you notice symptoms, they may shorten your illness by a day or so. Oseltamivir is an oral medication, but zanamivir is inhaled through a device similar to an asthma inhaler and shouldn't be used by anyone with respiratory conditions, such as asthma and lung disease.<br>  <br>  Both medications can cause side effects, including lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite and trouble breathing. They can also lead to the development of antiviral-resistant viruses.<br>  <br>  In November 2006, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the maker of Tamiflu to include a warning that people with the flu, particularly children, may be at increased risk of self-injury and confusion after taking Tamiflu. The FDA recommends that individuals with the flu who take Tamiflu be closely monitored for signs of unusual behavior. Discuss possible side effects with your doctor before starting any antiviral medication.<br>  Lifestyle and home remedies<br>  <br>  If you do come down with the flu, these measures may help ease your symptoms:<br>  <br>      * Drink plenty of liquids. Choose water, juice and warm soups to prevent dehydration. Drink enough so that your urine is clear or pale yellow.<br>      * Rest. Get more sleep to help your immune system fight infection.<br>      * Try chicken soup. It's not just good for your soul — it really can help relieve flu symptoms by breaking up congestion.<br>      * Consider pain relievers. Use an over-the-counter pain reliever such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others) cautiously, as needed. Remember, pain relievers may make you more comfortable, but they won't make your symptoms go away any faster and may have side effects. Ibuprofen may cause stomach pain, bleeding and ulcers. If taken for a long period or in higher than recommended doses, acetaminophen can be toxic to your liver. Talk to your doctor before giving acetaminophen to children. And don't give aspirin to children or teens because of the risk of Reye's syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal disease.<br>  <br>  Prevention<br>  <br>  These steps can help you stay healthy, even at the height of flu season:<br>  <br>      *<br>  <br>        Get an annual flu vaccination. The best time to be vaccinated is October or November. This allows your body time to develop antibodies to the flu virus before peak flu season, which in the Northern Hemisphere is usually December through March. However, getting a flu shot later in the flu season may still protect you. It takes up to two weeks to build immunity following a flu shot.<br>  <br>        Keep in mind that the flu vaccine doesn't offer complete protection, especially for older adults, but it can reduce the risk and severity of illness. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), when the match between flu vaccine and circulating strains of flu virus is close, a flu shot is between 70 and 90 percent effective in warding off illness in healthy people under age 65. It is less effective in older adults. Health experts recommend vaccinations for people over 50 because the flu shot may reduce the risk of flu-related complications, hospitalizations and deaths.<br>  <br>        Healthy people ages 2 to 49 alternatively may receive the flu vaccine via a nasal spray called FluMist. It protects against the same strains of influenza that the flu shot does. Like the flu shot, FluMist is given every year. Because FluMist contains live, but weakened, flu viruses, it shouldn't be given to pregnant women, people with weakened immune systems and those with chronic illnesses. A study published in 2006 found that FluMist was only between 30 and 57 percent effective in preventing the flu in adults. However, another study in 2006 found that giving nasal spray vaccine to school-age children helped to reduce the spread of flu in the community. And in 2007, researchers compared the effectiveness of FluMist with the flu shot in children ages 6 months to 5 years. The children treated with FluMist experienced about half as many cases of flu as did those treated with the shot. However, FluMist increases the risk of wheezing in this age group — especially in those who already have asthma or recurrent wheezing and in all children under age 2. In 2007, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) therefore approved FluMist for children older than 2 years who don't have asthma or recurrent wheezing. Consult with your doctor about which form of vaccination may be best for you or your child.<br>  <br>        You can get the flu vaccine from your doctor, at public health centers and many pharmacies. In some areas, flu vaccines are also available at senior or community centers and at supermarkets.<br>      * Wash your|`|3asVGB3eaa	Take extra vitamin C. Stay away from him. Wash hands!!!!ALOT!!!

UZJ7wVc8aa	Getting a nice set of abs is such a misunderstood process. It's actually a lot easier than most people think which is why most people are in a never ending quest to get that perfect six pack - it's because they're doing all the wrong things.<br>  <br>  When you eat more calories than you burn, your body takes those extra calories and stores them as fat somewhere on your body. For some people, the #1 fat storage area is around the thighs and for others it might be around the stomach - it differs from person to person. Sometimes the fat is perfectly distributed around the body so it's not as big of a concern. <br>  <br>  If an excessive amount of fat is stored around your stomach, the reason that you're not seeing your abs is because your body fat percentage is too high. What you need to do is create a calorie deficit (take in less calories than you burn) so that your body is forced to use its fat stores for energy. After a few weeks of doing this, you'll notice that your abs will start to show.<br>  <br>  You first step is to figure out how many calories you burn each day. Use this calculator <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a> for an estimate. Now you need to increase the amount of calories you burn by exercising more and decreasing the amount of calories you eat. Cut out junk food such as fast food, candy and sugar. Eat foods that are high in fiber: bread and pasta made from 100% whole wheat, brown rice, oats, fruits and vegetables.<br>  <br>  You shouldn't ignore targeting your abs with sit ups, leg raises and twists but doing hundreds of sit ups won't do anything about the layer of fat that is covering them. Cardio and calorie restriction should be your main focus. If you need more details on getting a six pack, visit The Guide to Getting Nice Abs - <a href="http://www.straightabs.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.straightabs.com</a>|`|3oYOXc0Xaa	first thing are you fat? chubby? or just not muscular? if you are fat or chubby u need to run to both increase metabolism and burn that extra energy stored as fat.  you should run for a decent amount of time but if you aren't used to it try for 30 minutes or so and you can stretch it out.  do this everyday if possible.  Also you need to eat healthy 1200-1800 calories a day, but if you are active you may need more calories. once that fat is off you need to do ab exercises 3 times a week.  you should do planks both front and side, bicycle kicks, and situps with a 25 pound weight.  all of these exercises should be reps of 20-30 and the planks start out doing them for a minute and work your way up from there.|`|0aWzzoDlaa	Proper nutrition is everything!  <br>  <br>  Nutrition and a good work out routine will get you there, and more importantly, keep you there. <br>  <br>  Read books, do some research, but taking supplements to achieve this goal is definitely the wrong approach.
CgQBzsrbaa	I know exactly how you feel! I also am youngish and suffer from hypothyroidism. I gained weight like crazy and could not get rid of it no matter what I did. Plus, the side effects are you're tired all the time and it leads to depression.<br>  <br>  I've been losing weight recently (20 lbs over the past year) through a combination of ways to break the metabolism curse that is hypothyroidism. Firstly, you need to see an endocrinologist to see what replacement thyroid drug you need, they come out with new ones every so often. I'm on Synthroid and it works, but it takes at least two weeks to kick in. You take those every morning before you eat! This is important because anything you eat/take will interfere with thyroid pills! <br>  <br>  Also, you may be deficient in vitamins, most of us are. I take a multivitamin and vitamin D, and trust me IT HELPS. Just take them 2-4 hours after your pills because they will block absorption. <br>  <br>  I suggest seeing a nutritionist as well, a lot of endo offices have one or two that work with the patients. Once you get the vitamins and the thyroid pills right, it should be easier to lose weight. Unfortunately, losing weight for us is not just a numbers game (calories in vs calories out), it's a chemical equation. <br>  <br>  As for exercise, try earlier in the morning right after you take your pill. Aim for 30-60 minutes of moderate-to-high intensity cardio four times a week. Normal people can get away with less, but for us it takes more effort. I would suggest going most days and alternating days of weight training. The weight training is just as important as the cardio because muscles will burn 20X more calories than fat tissue does, thus revving the saggy metabolism. <br>  <br>  As for type of cardio, just make sure you crosstrain to avoid muscle memory. Try jogging one day, the bike the next. It's important to keep your body guessing because if you can't adjust, you'll burn more calories with effort.<br>  <br>  And finally, water. Drink lots of water to keep your body flushing out the toxins.|`|3b43628da17fa39fdf0695aa42cc5afdaa	To lose weight (fat), include more fibrous slow digesting carbs, as opp. to the fast digesting ones. <br>  <br>  No white breads, fast foods, sodas (not even diet) no ketchups, sugar, only skim milk, not 2%, skim and whole grain non sweet (sugary) cereal, whole wheat bread, maybe buy some soy or whey protein.<br>  <br>  Include lean meats like ham, and other sources of protein. Avoid red meats. Take a multivitamin, calcium and vitamin d every 2 days, one or two V8s a day (or every other day). <br>  <br>  Don't starve, eat small healthy meals. A lot of small meals opposed to a few bigger ones-- make sure is has at least 8-10 or more g of protein, not too much protein because the body can only digest a certain amount at a time; and avoid too many fruits, carbs and sugars. Fibrous veggies, greens (no starches or potatoes) are good, and no BBQ sauce (unless used sparingly) and not too much (if any) salad dressing. <br>  <br>  Before bed (2 hrs), eat something with protein, don't<br>  eat many carbs before bed. Eat some of that good cereal in the morning, you need quality carbs, just not too much, and the slow digesting ones.<br>  <br>  Do slow crunches until you can not do anymore, jog stairs (be safe though), warm up first and do sprints, short bursts of intense activity is very effective compared to long weak activity, just don't over do it. Also include some slow but long endurance jogging. Be active!<br>  <br>  Jog stairs ;and also do some lunges until it burns, do this every day or 2 days, keep going and don't give up, same with eating, you need some fat, so one or two fish oils daily.<br>  <br>  Eat fish (not fried, be careful, very careful for bones) Peanut butter on whole wheat (no jelly), which has protein, and don’t worry about the fat in that. Avocados, has fat, good fat; eat it when your hunger cravings get you. <br>  <br>  When you do crunches, also twist on some to work your sides, keep tension on your abs. <br>  <br>  <br>  Need more info, go to <a href="http://www.bodybuilding.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bodybuilding.com</a>|`|dUj7rP2haa	You should ask your doctor for a referral to a dietitian...preferable one that specializes in hypothyroidism.|`|EYRlLHwLaa	First of all, eat less and exercise more.  It's as simple as that.  If you consume less calories than you burn, you will lose weight.  It's a physiologic certainty.  Second, if you are truly hypothyroid, then you need to be on thyroid replacement therapy.  Thyroid hormone has other functions in your body than just metabolism.  It affects many organ systems.

ygGr1nX7aa	I don't really know anything about prana, but I understand it to be a spiritual energy-type force, comparable to ki/chi.  I don't know how it 'works'.  However, endorphins are chemicals produced in the body that can be isolated and observed in laboratory conditions, which act on the brain to reduce sensations of pain and provide a mild euphoria as a survival tactic.  I'm fairly sure most of that cannot be said about prana.
df6e5b1a8d31db24d73d45f4db076d71aa	I agree with you!  I have been reading that 8 glasses of water is just a guideline!  Many foods we eat give you a lot of the required water intake (vegetables, soups, fruits, berries).  Also, drinking herbal teas, juices and milk supply you with liquids.  The body doesn't recognize milk vs water - just that it's liquid, and it'll either use it or eliminate it.  The only thing that you should be conscious about is your caffeine intake.  Caffeine will cause your kidneys to eliminate water from your body, whether you need to or not.  <br>  <br>  Every day, I usually drink 2 cups of herbal tea, a glass of juice, and a cup of (caffeinated) coffee.  I also eat a lot of veggies and if I feel thirsty, I'll drink something more. <br>  Cheers!|`|bcI9zBDwaa	try and drink as much water as you can it will make your skin feel better and your hole body in general!|`|3jFm0rWdaa	I think the benefits of drinking mega water has been vastly overrated - and you get it anyway in normal drinks.|`|KhGkc2QGaa	that's kinda weird.

A 5'5, 300lb body builder has no fat, but he does have bone density and muscle mass to add to his weight. While 220lbs does sound like a bit much for your height, it might not be as bad as you think. Ask a personal trainer to factor in different things and tell you if you need to lose weight or if you are actually healthy.

What you have to be worried about is if your system has below the allowed amount of Cannabinoids in your system.  In a few days, you may not have burned off enough fat to lower the level of Cannabinoids.  See, your body produces Cannabinoids, but not TetraHydraCannabinoid, but they can't tell the difference so they set a safe level for their test.<br>  If you hurt yourself in some way before the test and you have smoked a little pot, your system will have produced a lot of Cannabinoids to reduce the swelling and that will probably push the limit.|`|iNkOiNC7aa	30 days depending on your size..go to GNC, they have stuff for that, it works for my son in law everytime...|`|3tiH3rEZaa	GET OFF THE WEED<br>  your life is at stake<br>  do ur family and friends a favor<br>  <br>  ps, it stays in your system forever|`|d1431527582f8f414e0e05855712ef5faa	It can last in your system up to six weeks.|`|5nCCwq1naa	marijuana is illegal.<br>  <br>  your a criminal.|`|J5BBZLhRaa	uhhmm it usually stayy in theree for a monthh.<br>  uhhmm.also urine helpps take awyy the smokee thingg.<br>  so tht wayy if teyy habb like somedectorss or wutverr theyy wontt get yuoo caughtt:]<br>  <br>  oh and by the wayy.that first girl upp therr iss lieennnn.!<br>  dontt trustt thtt byotchh.Lol|`|GvHX5v9eaa	I don't want to be bossy or anything, but marijuana is NOT a good thing especially if your young.

C2FKne6taa	You can learn breathing exercises and using relaxation techniques.  Also consider asking your GP for cognitive behaviour therapy.|`|ParFJxnSaa	View the techniques for control of anxiety/panic attacks, in section 8, at ezy build, below. Begin, on this first occasion, only, by holding your breath for 5, or 10 seconds: this will give you the confidence to realise that YOU CAN CONTROL YOUR BREATHING, but not pass out, or die (your autonomic nervous system resumes breathing, if you become unconscious). Advice from a published psychiatrist on controlled breathing: (1.) Get a clock, or watch with a second timer. (2.) Practise for 5 minutes, 4 times daily, until proficient. (3.) Take a small breath in, and hold it, for 6 seconds. (4.) Think to yourself: "RELAX", just before breathing out. (5.) Try to feel a sense of releasing tension, as you breathe out. (6.) Breathe in for 3 seconds, then out, for 3 seconds. Try to make your breathing very smooth, and light, as you breathe in through your nose, and out through your mouth, or nose. (7.) For the next minute, continue to breathe in, and out, every 3 seconds. (8.) Go back to step 3, at the end of the minute, and proceed through to step 7, doing this for 5 minutes. Use this at the very first sign of a panic attack starting, or any time you feel anxious, or tense. Similar, but simpler advice, from a clinical psychologist is to breathe in to the count of 3: (one thousand one; one thousand two; one thousand three) each takes around a second to say to yourself, in your mind. Then breathe out to the count of 3. Repeat, until it begins to take effect. Understand panic attacks, and what triggers them, in your life (if it is unresolved anxiety, or stress, see sections 6*, [page N first*] or 42, [page i first] respectively). <br>  <br>  The paper bag method also works for most people, but is not suited to all circumstances, such as driving, or playing sport. Another alternative is psychotherapy, to address its fundamental cause, which is usually anxiety; read section 1, and examine the <a href="http://1-800-therapist.com/" rel="nofollow">http://1-800-therapist.com/</a> & <a href="http://www.metanoia.org/choose/" rel="nofollow">http://www.metanoia.org/choose/</a> websites, and use the locators to find a therapist, (and phone book, but only if necessary). I used to suffer from panic attacks, until I questioned what had changed in my life, at, or just before that time, to trigger them, which is enough for some people. Visualise as vividly as possible, a large, red, flashing, "STOP!" sign, and/or possibly a stern faced person wagging an index finger at you in a negative manner, then say to yourself as forcefully as you can, even aloud in a big voice, if alone: "I know this tactic: GO AWAY FOR A WHILE !!!" You may want to us either: "ruse", "ploy", "game", or "trick", instead of "tactic". It usually takes 30 - 40 repetitions, for most people, to establish a new habit. I also suggest that you learn, then practise the controlled breathing technique, until competent, then employ it, at the very first sign of a panic attack.<br>  <br>  Practice one of the relaxation methods in sections 11, 2, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed. Also, give the EFT a good tryout, to see if it helps you. There is also a version for use in public places, (if you like, you can claim to have a headache, as you massage/lightly tap your temples, but you would then be restricted to subvocalising - saying it to yourself in your mind). Sections 53, and 2, 2.q and 2.o at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> also refer: "Even though I sometimes suffer from panic attacks, I deeply and completely accept myself." Note: the controlled breathing only helps with the symptoms (as do medications/herbal remedies): you need to address the underlying cause, which requires some form of therapy, and Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy has been shown to be effective. Imagine that the cause of your panic; your anxieties, fears, your self doubts, self recriminations, all the agonizing "I'm-so-Stupids"; every painful "I-can't-do-it" are huge raging, hurtful bulls snorting and charging at you. You see them coming at you and you hold out your red matador's cape at arms length and simply let them charge right by.|`|2xpzhN5faa	St.Johns Wart is a good one.<br>  Can be quite expensive though.|`|syARUNBDaa	Over 40 million adult Americans suffer from anxiety and/or panic attacks, usually brought on by stress.<br>  <br>  Deep breathing and relaxation techniques are very useful.

I find this really helps.<br>  <br>  Also, don't do anything to stimulate your brain for an hour or so before you go to bed - I mean stuff such as computer games or exercise. <br>  <br>  When you lie down and close your eyes, try and make your breathing regular and concentrate on your breathing, in - out - in - out............<br>  <br>  Or try counting backwards from 100 down.............<br>  <br>  Imagine your friends yawning and you will find you want to join in.<br>  <br>  Hope some of this helps.|`|wUQ51VBdaa	i got one of those applications for my i pod called IDream and it has relaxing sounds and music on there and it makes your screen kind of turn into a glowing changing colour night light, its really soothing and i have trouble sleeping too. <br>  <br>  and i have lavender and all other kinds of sleepy smells haha .<br>  <br>  x|`|8P6MmLv0aa	I always sleep well after sex|`|orcLWRp7aa	From reading this its because you have too much on your mind ... a bit before you go to bed close your eyes and jus think about the things that are in your head and sleep then as you would normal.Hope this helps!|`|WeAhr8g5aa	Well I know many people who do this: spray lavender on your pillow before you go to sleep at night.

AA10350894	The pic at the link you provided is a classic depiction of an UNcircumcised penis. If your penis works normally, meaning it gets hard when you are aroused and the foreskin is not tight or restrictive, you are normal and DO NOT necessarily need a circumcision.|`|SltEwVX7aa	well, if you're uncircumcised, that's what it should look like.<br>  <br>  If your knob (the glans or head) is bare all the time, then you're circumcised, and your penis will never look like that;  you don't have any foreskin left.|`|vsaaaSsAaa	It probably looks different than porn videos, because most of those men are circumcised.  The picture is an uncircumcised penis.   Totally normal.  Nothing wrong with it.  You don't need to get circumcised, unless you would like to.  It's quite painful and requires lots of healing time.|`|lCvJHS13aa	Normal intact penis, every guy should look like this if they haven't been mutilated.<br>  <br>  NO, you don't need to be circumcised.  Outside the USA, 80% of the men in the world look like the picture, and the percentage in the US is getting higher every year.|`|AA11522944	Bud... that is a perfectly normal intact (uncircumcised) penis.<br>  <br>  What you are seeing in porn is probably circumcised penises which are NOT natural.  They have had the foreskin cut off.<br>  <br>  You are lucky to be intact so you DON'T need to be circumcised.|`|a5rInHwjaa	hey<br>  thats normal<br>  mine looks like that and im 14<br>  wot u worried about?|`|Ldy7mNHKaa	It doesn't look like there is anything wrong with it.

HraW4VaYaa	from gymnastics ive had pains like that<br>  ive chipped bones in that area so you might want to see a doctor, get an x-ray and go to physio or sumthin,<br>  it may jus be irrated and inflamed, best thing for this is advil,<br>  other then that, all you can do is rest it up with no vigorous activity for a couple days
9pLdhuBnaa	Because of the popping sound that you noticed it could have been a dislocation (an example only).<br>  <br>  However, because this pain is getting worse I would recommend seeing your doctor for further evaluation of the situation to see what they say.
QAN5OxWIaa	i think tht it is kinda wrong because even if you were raped the baby is still have wayy made from you an you should still love it  unless you are wayy to young to have a baby then you should most likely have abortion. personally i am against abortions!!!|`|E0eZguk3aa	I would get an abortion if I was raped because I could not stand the person child that raped me inside me.|`|bmhnXEsVaa	No. I find abortion to be one more step in an entire culture that despises life & favors death, animals (save the planet & going green) & generally causes us to view humanity as something less than a total miracle & blessing. All in the name of Womens' Liberation & her "right" to choose. What about the babys' right to exist? <br>  The womb is the only safe place a baby has in this world. Once it leaves the safety & security of Momma's belly, it is thrust into a harsh existence that brings pain.<br>  In days past, women & families learned how to handle the gift of a Special Needs child. Nowadays, we simply get genetic testing, rip it out & throw it away...as if it's life is anything less that a wonder of creation!<br>  We've chosen to "save the whales" & "hug a tree" but babies have become disposable. When did human life become less than a tree? God have mercy on us.|`|yDJiiqcsaa	Isn't it strange that those 2 examples are used to gauge whether abortion is ok when in reality rape/abuse/women/babies health is TOTAL only about 5% of abortions,  and 95% is because of failing to prepare with contraception/convenience for the mother.  If a woman felt confident that she couldn't obtain a legal abortion what percentage of that 95% would then be eliminated by more conscientious contraception ?   So in 1000 abortions if 50 represents health considerations and/or rape then 950 are from failing to use adequate contraception and if even 75% of those were prevented by a more conscientious approach to contraception that could prevent 712 abortions. In money that is the difference between the cost of 9 months of contraceptives versus $350-500 abortion and in moral considerations - 712 dead babies.|`|cf5961a316debfb7203fffd630bd740caa	i think abortion is acceptable in all cases. a woman's reason is her own and she has every right to get an abortion within the legal time-frame that is established. it shouldn't matter how the fetus came into existance. if the woman no longer wishes to remain pregnant, she doesn't have to do so.|`|8ZmjIYORaa	If they have a disease, I would abort the unborn child, or it would suffer when it's born. But if I had a baby, and I didn't want it, I wouldn't kill a life for no reason. Hope I helped =]|`|OgaJqkSQaa	I think abortion is acceptable in many situations. It's a shame some people abuse it (by having too many and/or neglecting contraception), but I'm glad it's legal because I would hate women to end up using coathangers and having back street abortions again.<br>  <br>  There'll be loads of kids chiming in to say how wrong it is, but young people often think it's wrong because of their lack of life experience. Half of them will probably go on to have one eventually.|`|AoUUfzXgaa	I think that abortion is acceptable in all instances. Not everyone is ready or prepared to raise a child, and it's better to not give a child a chance at a life where they would probably be neglected, abused, starved, and mistreated. I also think that all teenage mothers should get abortions unless they have the support of an adult during and after their pregnancy...at least so they can finish school and stay off welfare. Abortion isn't a legal debate, it's a personal decision,and if you can't trust us with a choice, how can you trust us with a child?<br>  <br>  And for all the people who say adoption, how many unborn babies are YOU willing to adopt?|`|DozD8lTGaa	in my opinion i think that if a woman was raped then abortion is acceptable.<br>  <br>  i do not agree that any baby should be aborted otherwise UNLESS, the Mother and baby had no chance of surviving or the Mother would die if she went the full pregnancy.<br>  <br>  i think all babies should be given a chance and no one should be able to play God to them.<br>  <br>  this is only my opinion; don't be offended.X|`|tjTbkxkzaa	I think it should be the woman's choice.  Where do the prolifer's draw the line?  Isn't washing with antibacterial soap killing too?  You're still taking life so does that conflict with one of the commandments?  I certainly feel it's legitimate after rape.|`|Vzzc6mATaa	In cases of rape it is needed or if the woman''s health is being put at risk as for congenital disease this is more difficult to say how would you say what /which ones ? should be and which ones not ?|`|p6XPhIxnaa	I don't know, that's really hard, I would just have to say that what ever the mother decides but there is always the adoption option put the option in adopiton|`|1oNi2v38aa	I think everyone should get abortions, the world can only hold so many.|`|p2pE0Fpwaa	It's murder, plain and simple.|`|GuepqoYKaa	abortion is wrong no matter what the circumstances are. even if the woman was raped, why would you punish the baby? just because the child's father is a terrible person, doesn't mean the baby should be killed. <br>  <br>  why would you kill the baby because s/he has a disease? would you kill the baby if you found out about the disease after birth? or would you kill a 3 year old that has a disease, because you don't want them to suffer? why should it be any different if the baby hasn't been born yet?<br>  <br>  i think that abortion is worse than killing an adult, because the child has no way whatsoever to defend themself. if you wouldn't kill a person that has been born, why would you kill a person that hasn't been born? there is no difference. nobody can argue that an embryo is not a person, because they were an embryo once.<br>  <br>  not having money for a child, or being too young to raise a child is no excuse. that's what adoption is for. there are so many couples that want a child but can't have one, the child can be adopted into a loving home.<br>  <br>  having an abortion because the woman's health is in danger is just like pulling an innocent child in front of you if you are about to get shot, and letting the child take the bullet instead. it is incredibly selfish.<br>  <br>  it is the woman's fault she got pregnant in the first place. if she didn't want a child, maybe she should have thought about that before she had sex.|`|w9QFN9gJaa	I think its up to the individual person, if you feel its the right thing to do, then you should not listen to anyone else.  If the child was going to have something wrong all its life, then i think you should think about what type of life it would have, and would you want that child to live like that. What ever the reason nobody should judge you if you have done what you feel is for the best.|`|qEPr0FOCaa	I feel soooo strongly opinionated about this topic, so I'll try not to rant and rave and keep it short.<br>  <br>  <br>  100% against it. No matter the circumstances. <br>  <br>  <br>  Keep in mind...would you kill a newborn baby?<br>  It's the same thing (:|`|5fuFXlyIaa	It really depends on the moral / religious beliefs of the person. Adoption is always another option.
BlA60kDVaa	I feel like this sometimes... I don't mean to be though.  I guess i could describe myself as being quite an introvert at times, even though I'm a different person on stage.  I've so much love, happiness and goodness to give - but I feel people do get the wrong impression about me simply by the way I look sometimes or with what expressions my face holds.  After all, no one really wants to be disliked, do they...?<br>  <br>  You know what? It's hard bloody work being a human-being at the best of times.  The hardest part is that no one will ever really know what it will truly be like to be someone else.  And that's the hardest part, even though some people think they know what other people are like and what they are feeling and thinking.<br>  <br>  I hate fake people.

No idea how much longer than that though :(<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: Maybe I should point out that it wasn't the "GIMME A CIG BEFORE I RIP OUT MY OWN EYEBALLS!" kind of craving... more like when you see really gooey brownies and you cant resist a taste<br>   <br>  the freak out fiend cravings went away for me after about 4 days|`|wb8WwWMNaa	Well depends on how much you've smoked and for how long.

OPokTPataa	Hi have used chinese herbal remedies for years for various different ailments and they have all worked.  You can get pill formulas which are easier to take than the boiling of the herbs, which often taste digusting believe me, but they work quicker.<br>  <br>  acupuncture I had several times but the greatest results I had was when I damaged my shoulder and unable to raise my arm.  despite all the physio I had which did no good the acupuncture fixed it right away and never had any more problems since.  I only use herbal remedies now because they work better with fewer side effects.  good luck

4xedmCmCaa	Hi, You definitely shouldn't jog straight after a meal, for sure!<br>  It will make you sick!  As a Personal Trainer and keen runner, if you have you main meal at lunch time, wait until about 4pm, then run.  You can take fruit and water during the time leading up to running.  If you have your main meal in the evening, then eat little and often throughout the day.

AA11286455	Ask him who gave him (or where did he earn certification).  <br>  <br>  The state has an office that should be able to verify whether or not he has a *license* and whether they even offer such licenses.  Try the Department of Health.  <br>  <br>  The word certification is a different kettle of fish--he could have gotten it from a school or college or private training program.|`|bjcjQ4zfaa	I'd rather have a good counselor without a certificate than a bad counselor with one.

If you experience any pain,  or you lose red blood or large clots(unlikely) , dial for am ambulance immediatly. Good luck.|`|l7GjBVvhaa	I it normal to spot during pregnancy and usually the color will be as you discussed. You can always feel free to call your doctor and find out more information. Don't hesitate on seeking medical advice from the doctors either that is why they are there! <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Be seeing you......
Jswomud7aa	it's weird that your out of pocket co-pay is $804. <br>  <br>  Call your insurance and verify that the office is giving you the correct cost. If you have a PPO then a PFM (porcelain fused to metal crown) should be about $450 (in Southern California, every area has diff prices), if you have a HMO you could pay as little as $200 to as much as $700.<br>  <br>  The price could be the area where you live is more expensive, but still call your insurance and double check.<br>  <br>  You can always ask your dentist to re-do the composite. If there isn't enough tooth structure left to re-do it then a crown is your only option.<br>  <br>  There isn't any time-line on how long you can wait. Everybody is different. Some times patients come in with a broken tooth saying that all they were doing was eating soup! So it's really difficult to say how long your teeth will last before something like that happens if it does at all.|`|UL3XOKJxaa	On a front tooth the crown would obviously be best..have you considered replacing the composite to buy some time? There is really no other acceptable alternative that would be less expensive. Good Luck|`|XUCER5Vcaa	here is a route to go but you need to talk to a dental lab- you could get a temporary crown- there are composite materials for temporary dental crowns that can last in the mouth for years.  it is not widely marketed because you are better off with a permanent crown in metal, gold, or zirconia.....a larger dental lab that provides different solutions can share with you what options are out there.  also in this day and age a dental lab crown in metal (not gold) should run the doc about $100+ or so the dentist has plenty of markup...
i6RlYFo7aa	it's normal for it to curve<br>  <br>  no connection with sexuality|`|W2z5dCrmaa	Hey <Luke boi><br>  <br>  Your gear can bend, but it isn't really what you want. During growth time of your gear, nature kicks in spontaneous hard on's...some times from what you see, ans sometimes for no reason at all.<br>  <br>  Nature is spiking your testosterone to make this happen so that new hollow bodies and new growth addition to your penis gets filled out and stretched to max. to keep adding on for healthy additional length and diameter.<br>  <br>  If during this time, you keep wearing tight pouch type underwear, your gear can't expand and straighten right out to complete that purpose. Us Dudes either fall on one side or the other..means noting at all, but your gear will keep getting bent the same way because of it in tight underwear. It will start to develop an unwanted cure in your gear. If you are growing a long penis, the curve becomes more because your gear is struggling to extend and keeps getting bent without the hollow bodies on one side being allowed to ever get expanded properly.<br>  <br>  The best way to help is to wear looser boxers during this growth stage, even if you hate the way that they look. Some things are just more important.<br>  <br>  If you get a hard on at school in these, it's really easy just to slip your hand in and move your gear up under the waste band of these underwear, pointed toward your belly button. Nature can then do the needed work and nobody can see you condition because the not too tight waste band keeps it there Until it goes back to rest.<br>  <br>  Sleeping in the nude during this time of growing is really good for you, or good at any time. Haha! Best sleep that you will ever get Man.<br>  <br>  After dong the above for a while, the curve will go away, and you can push max. growth of your gear. <br>  <br>  If you are with your Lady or wife, you can always put on some briefs or boxer briefs as a show piece for her while doing the preliminaries, and go back to the healthy fit boxers after. For the preliminaries, I always wear some briefs for my lay with lots of expansion give in the front pouch...seeing the changes happening really turns her on and makes her want to rescue me out from them. Haha! <br>  <br>  Hope I helped you Dude<br>  <br>  Me! :- )|`|q0ce9dEnaa	Every penis bends either left or right, AND either forwards or backwards. They are simple unavoidable human imperfections that have no connection to sexuality, penis size, number of mates, etc. Good luck!|`|CC6dSdJmaa	Lots of guys penis curves one way or another.

BNAzjSO1aa	I think you need to go back to the doctor soon  and ask him to check your iron levels again and ask as you are bruising a lot could he check you platelet levels as well. You should have felt better taking the iron supplements but they often cause the problems you mentioned.(Try taking vit b group and vit c as well to help with the absorbtion) You would have to ask the doctor why he is not classing you as anemic. One food that is rich in iron and suggested to me by my doctor when I was pregnant and my levels were starting to drop was dark chocolate over about 70% cocoa content. It is not often you can say you are eating chocolate on a doctors orders lol|`|xE8orz6Daa	Lack of B vitamins could be the answer too, such as fruits and vegetables.<br>  <br>  You could try using supplements, but it's best getting from the source - actual food.<br>  <br>  You say you only take Iron supplements, but that could be an indication of the problem, since your only taking one type of vitamin, rather than say taking a multivitamin tablet with a range of different supplications in.<br>  <br>  As I said, take a look at your diet, check your getting the right foods.|`|UOybpxsfaa	I know it is slightly different but when I was pregnant I could not take the iron tablets they gave me they made me feel so sick I stopped taking then and ate lots of greens and high iron foods and I also drank a bottle of Guinness daily I had trouble with this at first but then added lemonade to it to make a shandy and got to enjoy it in the end  I got my iron level back to normal, Hope this helps|`|551d897f0abf6a9c090f9e8bea28b76daa	talk to your doctor about these issues...you cannot just eat iron rich foods you also have to eat foods that help the body absorb that iron...which is why spinach is not a good iron rich food to eat...it is high in iron but your body has a hard time absorbing that iron....good luck!!!|`|7PbJWEo1aa	iron tablets are horrid and will screw up you tummy, how are you with your greens? I overdose on spinach (I eat lots and lots and lots!) and also lots of red meat too. Try cutting down on your exersise - see if it makes a difference.<br>  <br>  hope you feel better soon.|`|MmRDzhaHaa	You need to eat foods containing vitamin c + d for iron to be absorbed,but try to eat iron rich foods, such as eggs, liver, lentil soups treacle,and green veg, in the mean time ask to see the practise nurse at your surgery to discuss these side affects, and to check your blood pressure.|`|HugRTUPsaa	It might not be iron that's the problem, at least not on it's own. Try a vitamin b12 supplement too, as it helps your body absorb and metabolise iron into useful stuff like haem (as in haemoglobin).|`|6qwN9HCFaa	This is a pubic forum and NOT a place to seek medical advice.<br>  <br>  If Your are not happy with your doctor, get a second opinion.|`|FrugDmPzaa	i think anaemic is where you bleed alot n dont stop you might be eatin the wrong stuff go n get a blood test|`|teFKJflZaa	VIT helps your body absorb iron, so you could try and get more in your diet|`|od5b8GMUaa	you may have a problem get a better doctor|`|A8fdgVzQaa	As said already Vit. C & D are supposed to help with the absorption of iron and taking a multi and extra B12 could help. I take a great iron sup. called Slow Fe. It is time released so it doesn't hurt the stomach so much. I couldn't handle the regular iron tablets either. Keep doing your best to eat fresh fruits and veggies. Don't forget some seafoods and nuts are great too. Remember some of us just don't absorb iron easily....you may be one now. But for sure go back to the Dr. and/or get a second opinion if things don't improve soon. Good Luck!|`|df089a1d7acdbf674fc91dddc4748277aa	Firstly supplement iron in the form of tablets are no match for a good diet, read the iron contents of food and eat accordingly, I believe liver which I personally adore is very rich in iron and also broccoli which I hate is similar, I'm certain there must be more food with iron, without wanting to sound ridiculous are all your symptoms iron related because the symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning are very similar, sickness, headaches, depression, lifeless, tiredness, your symptoms sound close to poison I would have your gas appliances tested if you have them, good luck and I hope you solve your problem.
5LJUiqOUaa	if it fits good and you don't feel any discomfort, it's probably on right . but if your not always sure, it's better to leave it off than to put it on incorrectly . that way you don't make your teeth move in an unwanted position . good luck :)

Sometimes it has to do with dreams. Your brain transfers information to some of your organs since a dream might be so lucid that it might think you really needed to go the restroom.

eDKSKqcSaa	Hello<br>  Sounds like a good story and well done for researching it so thoroughly! Some people find that smoking cannibis helps with hallucinations but it tends to make it worse in the long run and is often thought to be the trigger that starts the  first episode of psychosis so if the guy in your story was already smoking weed and that started off the schizophrenia that would be very believable. <br>  <br>  Another one would be heroin but thats a big big deal so the guy would quickly become dependent and the school would react in a HUGE way to finding that on a screen! Cannabis is more likely as lots of kids do it at school - although, kids, it can be very bad for your mental health!<br>  <br>  Hope that helps :)<br>  <br>  PS ET down below (and a few others) seems to have quite a black and white view of schizophrenia. Many people manage the symptoms without medication. And lots of people have auditory hallucinations and live very normal lives. The main thing is to have good relationships with people who support you and can help you make decisions about when you definately need to take medication. Sorry - probably not necessary to your story bit of a favourate rant coming out there!|`|cI6vT8yJaa	LSD was once used by psychiatrists to understand the symptoms of schizophrenia. Unfortunately, unless the character is buying prescription drugs illegally, I do not know of an illegal "street drug" that would help with schizophrenia. In fact, it would do far more harm.|`|0aBlpLvsaa	Hi;<br>  <br>  no it isn't.  Why should he pay for illegal drugs when he can got<br>  his medication for free?<br>  The other alternatives he may have are all worse.<br>  Think: if he has auditory hallucinations  he can not make plans and have a real life.|`|70sjdbzyaa	no i wouldn't believe any drug would balance out his chemical inbalances in the brain except marijuana could help.|`|AA11626362	street drugs usually make it worse, wouldnt suggest it, get on real meds!|`|bO2rzfISaa	No. Actually, marijuana has a statistical association with schizophrenia (it seems to cause it), so that wouldn't be a good idea.<br>  <br>  Schizophrenia is really hard to hide.<br>  <br>  EDIT: If you use illegal drugs as many here suggest, who will monitor your progress? I't's a terrile idea, likely to make you less controlled than more. Please think this through. Do you want to be psychotic more than you are? I'm afaaid that you will be. Your dr can give you free samples if you can't pay. Ask for help and use studied, proven meds. Good luck.|`|bjcjQ4zfaa	There is some anecdotal evidence of psychedelics being used to cure schizophrenia and other mental illnesses.<br>  <br>  In tribal societies, a shaman/medicine man may give a person exhibiting problems akin to mental illness a psychoactive mixture to induce a psychedelic state where he can preform his healing.<br>  <br>  Prescription drugs aimed to cure schizophrenia are usually operating on a level where the fear/delusion is either dulled in intensity, or the emotions resulting from the fear/delusion are felt in a much more disconnected and "unimportant" way.<br>  <br>  The stories/testimonies I've read about illegal drugs and mental illness are a result of the fear/delusion being seen from a different perspective, or manifested in a strange vision or experience, or being exposed as irrational to the person and therefore removed as it is seen for what it is: not real. The drug didn't cure them, they cured themselves, but the drug aided in allowing them to see in a way they could not before.<br>  <br>  There have been many western doctors who have cited the potential that psychedelics could have in psychotherapy. Of course Dr. Timothy Leary made this stance near infamous and now a days the thought of this is not even looked into, unfortunately.<br>  <br>  Your story sounds like a great story.
q0ce9dEnaa	It's just your body's natural way of saying "I'm exited" to you. It's something that you, as well as others I'm sure, have to deal with. If this happens, try slipping away to the bathroom and put some warm water on the area, or take deep breaths, or blame it on a drafty window :)|`|34XawAUJaa	If you ask me i think thats hotttt!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  its your way of being excited!! just as long as you act calm who cares!|`|IzwoSZGYaa	That's called extreme premature ejaculation.

You can seem to eat a ton and not put on anything.<br>  <br>   First of all, make sure you are eating the right stuff. Protein is your friend. Eat lots of it.<br>   You also need to do the right kind of exercise, as you won't build muscle without work.<br>   If you are doing all of that already, I'd start looking at supplements. I'd start with a good protein powder. Then maybe look at a 'weight gainer'.

Colds are caused by viruses, not by a messy room.  They are easy to catch, and they go away after 3-4 days.  They can be avoided by keeping away from sick people and by near-compulsive hand washing. <br>  <br>  Second - you enable your 18 year old to remain a child.

q0ce9dEnaa	Although I have never taken that test, it sounds like it has irritated your rectal area, and that some form of cream is necessary. I would see another doctor for a second opinion on what to do.|`|TsjqzanQaa	First of all, the reason that you probably have hemorrhoids is that your diet is lacking in fiber.<br>  <br>  You should have disclosed this to the one giving the test.<br>  <br>  As you had to be "cleaned out" before the test, obviously, going back to the same diet would have exacerbated the hemorrhoids.<br>  <br>  If it's hard for you to defecate, you should take some stool softeners, and adjust your diet to make elimination less difficult, which should also help your situation with the hemorrhoids.<br>  <br>  I get constipated rather easily, because of medication, and I have to eat a diet high in fiber to help alleviate this.<br>  <br>  Oatmeal and oat bran cereals help, fresh fruits and veggies, and also drink plenty of water.     All of these combine to soften the stool and make elimination easier.<br>  <br>  You should go back to the doctor, and get the hemorrhoids taken care of as soon as possible, and learn to eat a better diet.<br>  <br>  Fast foods and convenience foods have most of the fiber processed out of them, and will irritate your hemorrhoids.<br>  <br>  It sounds like they should have indeed asked you about them, but conversely, you should have told them.<br>  <br>  But finally, perhaps you can get your situation sorted out for once and for all, and maybe reduce or eliminate your problem.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.|`|1htCWW7waa	go to the hospital Now

Sometimes us guys will use too much weight and not get the technique correct. This does not yield results. You might want to invest in a personal trainer for 1-2 sessions so that you can develop new techniques for your chest.

0bff81ed3d62dee95cf8cc2a3daa55a4aa	Dim all your lights about an hour before you want to go to bed, and play some relaxing music or sound effects.  Turn the thermostat in your bedroom down to about 16C (61F).  About half an hour before you go to bed, take a 3mg tablet of melatonin, a natural hormone that promotes sleep (your body produces it in response to low light and low activity).  Melatonin is available over the counter at any pharmacy.  When you go to bed, lie on your back and mentally relax all the parts of your body, starting at your toes and slowly working up.  Think only relaxing thoughts.  When you are completely relaxed, move into your usual sleeping position.  You may find that as you get used to this routine, you can cut the melatonin tablets in half.  That's how it worked for me.  (Hot chocolate doesn't, probably because it contains caffeine.  However, warm milk might.)|`|IARYnu6zaa	Take sleeping pills for a few days when you want to go to sleep and set a alarm for when you wanted to get up.<br>  Then after a few days try going to bed at the same time but without the pills and your body should adjust to that being the time its meant to sleep.|`|GO46i2l9aa	You need to get into a routine before you go to bed. I just recently got over that problem. I woke up every night at 3:30 and wouldnt fall back asleep til 6 or 7. But the key is to not sleep in. You should still get up at a normal time, like 8 or 9. that way you will be tired at a normal time. Then before you go to sleep have a cup of hot chocolate. It will relax you and once you do it regularly you body will know that once you have this cup of hot chocolate its bed time.|`|3y9AlP6Raa	Very common.<br>  Regulate your day.<br>  Set markers to achieve.<br>  Exercise.<br>  Kill Television.<br>  Go to bed early.anywhere between 8 and 9.30<br>  When you wake up, get up and go for a run.<br>  Get used to and enjoy the start of the day.<br>  Eat well.....what your body tells you<br>  Be a leader...not a follower.<br>  You`ll be healthier,more confident.<br>  The ladies will notice it....and I promise you...<br>  Life will be much,much better.<br>  <br>  Other than that....get a night job.|`|AEmgc6IRaa	Try doing a lot during the day.

M59kqWKhaa	As a Mom and Grandma, and for myself when needed too I use a soapy water enema.  Run warm water into a stopped sink or bowl.  Add just a little hand soap to this and mix it around.  Use a bulb syringe (the kind they use to clear out a baby's nose), fill with the warm soapy water.    Press the bottom of the syringe in, then place the tip into the water which will suck up some of the soapy water.  Do this a couple of times to fill the syringe.  You can apply some petroleum jelly to the tip of the syringe if you like.<br>  <br>  While sitting on the toilet, very gently insert the tip of the syringe just into the rectum and gently press the bulb to get the water into the colon.  The warm water will help soften the stool and the soap provides a lubricant to help it come out.<br>  <br>  I've also used the little waxy suppositories, but the soapy water enema works faster.<br>  <br>  To avoid constipation remember these three <br>  Fluid -- drink lots of water.<br>  Fiber  -- eat oatmeal, whole grain breads, lots of veggies and some fruit<br>  Exercies -- sounds like you are doing good in this area but be sure to keep well hydrated.|`|688c403afa0715767110cfa7a696a616aa	Thank you Geek for the best answer so far.<br>  When you've got a long-standing case of constipation, that enema is really what you need.|`|29ac9fee05b21177fd88bbe2729adf76aa	Enema first.

Constipation is a major symptom along with associated pain in adjacent areas.<br>  <br>  IBS is often triggered by eating a lot of heavy and/or fatty foods and shows itself in an episode that can last a couple of weeks.

Jwk7Ib2vaa	You'll be fine. Although your right to be concerned regarding pain medication, tylenol, if taken moderately and only when necessary, should not cause your body to plateau with such a mild form of medication.<br>  Just don't take it too often and you'll be fine.|`|be52fc0d175d76bbbfd17b8117a2d632aa	You would have to take loads of tablets over a long time for your body to become accustomed to the dose. If you are that worried buy the regular kind and take those and just use the extra strength ones for emergencies or bigger pain.|`|nAp688tZaa	It is physically impossible to develop a tolerance to any medication, including tylenol, after only one dose.  Your problem may be that you are very ill and the ES Tylenol is what you need to control the fever and an body aches or pain that are associated with your illness.  You do need to be careful with the consumption of this pain reliever and never take more than 2400 mg in a 24 hour period.  That is no more than 1000 mg per 6 hours.  Another good fever reducer and minor pain reliever is Ibuprofen (Advil or Motrin in the brand name).  This can not be taken more than 3 times per day at 800 mg doses since the max amount that is safe is 2400 mg in a 24 hour period.  If your fever does not subside within 48 hours, you will need to see your family doctor as you may have developed a bacterial infection and will need antibiotics.  There is a medication that is called a Z-Pack and it only has to be taken 1 time per day for 5 days, but it works for ten days like a traditional antibiotic.  If the infection is viral, then there is not much to do other than get plenty of rest, keep the fever down, and male sure to drink lots of fluids, including Gatorade or Pedialyte.  This will keep your electrolyte levels in balance, where only straight water can cause them to become diluted or flushed out completely.  Good luck, don't worry and see the doc in 48 hours if you are still running a fever and feeling crummy.|`|BG8vMyZjaa	You would have to take tylenol for quite a long period of time to develop a tolerance for it.<br>  I shouldn't worry many of us have taken regular doses through the period of an illness with no problems developing, nor has it become less effective, extra strength or not.<br>  The danger with Tylenol is overdose, ie exceeding the recommended dose.|`|AcHXnSDbaa	If you took Tylenol once it won't kill you. You have to take large amounts to have any problems. It is very hard to find the non extra strength pill. Its just over the counter. Now if it was tyleonl with codine than i would worry but don't worry you will be fine.|`|0Y2HH0FEaa	Taking Tylonol regularly gets the body used to it. If you just take it when you need to and use a regular dose, you'll be fine.  If you find you need to take the extra strength dose for it to work for you then this is fine, too - as long as you only take it when you need to. I mean when there is pain that you need to be rid of.<br>  <br>  As with all this stuff, if you need to take it regularly or it's no longer doing what it used to or if you are still taking it after 3 days with little or no effect, then you need to chat to your pharmacist or doctor.

l7GjBVvhaa	You need to pick a time that you can stick to and take it at that time. It will help you to never forget about it. 30 - 45 mins is fine for a variation in daily times. If you forget to take it, just take it as soon as possible, unless its closer to the time of your NEXT dose. In that case wait off till the next one is due. If you are closer to your next does then the missed one remember to use a condom at all times and spermicide next time you have sex.

Usually the ear starts to feel better around day 3 or 4, so you should be seeing improvement very soon. If you're so worried that you need a sleeping aid, might I suggest you phone up your doctor. Perhaps you need a different type of antibiotic, or perhaps you have a sinus infection, or you have a wax build-up as a result of your ear infection.<br>  You might want to try applying warm compresses to your ear. That may help with the plugged feeling, and it will help relieve any pain or discomfort you may be experiencing.|`|Ruifi0GSaa	And if that don't work after taking all the antibiotics.<br>  Try to clear stopped-up ears, put a few drops of lukewarm olive oil in the affected ear. Lie for 5 min. on the opposite side, then turn over, so that the olive oil can flow out again. (Do not put any liquid in your ear if you think you may have a perforated eardrum!) For earaches, soak a cotton pad in olive oil, then add 5 drops of lavender oil. Place it loosely in your outer ear until the pain abates.<br>  Hope that helps, take care. :)

Exertion headaches: also called the "weight lifters headache" which is usuallly of sudden onset of lifting something heavy and is described as sharp and piercing and it usually subsides within a few minutes of cessation of the lift.  <br>  <br>  2. Effort headaches: Usually induced by strenous cardiovascular activity. It can occur between minutes or hours after exercises and can last up to two days. It can have migranous feastures such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness, etc.  <br>  <br>  I, am a PT myself and found a helpful article in JOSPT (i've lost the reference, but I think you could probably find it on CINAHL by doing a search for "effort headaches" and JOSPT ( I think). <br>  <br>  I get effort headaches myself...to the point where I used to vomit.  It took a long time for me to understand the triggers...which for me are: dehydration/hyponatremia (taking gatorade and a magnesium supplment help), warm temperatures, hypoglycemia and watching out for my heart rate. Taking an anti-inflammatory prophylactically has been helpful when I know I"m subject to one (ie, if it's hot out or I exercise in the morning).<br>  <br>  Through careful training, I've been able to increase my tolerance for increased heart rate. HIIT has been helpful.  The short bursts of high intensity heart rate up to 90-100% max for 30-45 seconds followed by30-45 seconds or even up to a couple minutes walking for 9 reps (rather than working prolonged at 75% for 30-40 minutes) has been beneficial. Not only have I increased my speed, but my tolerance for prolonged cardiovascular activity has been increased.  <br>  <br>  If it IS an effort or exertion headache, they are usually benign and anti-inflammatories are the standard of treatment.<br>  <br>  Make sure all the nasties are ruled out, but if everything turns out fine, consider what I have mentioned above|`|7obFZ2Gyaa	I am not totally sure what is wrong with you but I would suggest  not working out at all till you see a doctor.

Gt9PsLr4aa	I only occasionally got pain.<br>  Lots of people go many years undiagnosed because they go without symptoms. So, you dont necessarily need to feel pain to have it. If you tested positive the biopsy will most likely confirm the results.<br>  <br>  The severity can vary not only day to day but person to person.<br>  The damage done is inside in your large intestines/bowels and its dangerous to continue eating it even if you dont have pain.<br>  <br>  Also theres a difference between allergy and intolerance. Normally if you have an actual allergy you react more severe and intolerance makes you more sick in the long run.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  You're welcome.<br>  And that is true, I would keep it in your diet for a little while longer.

I smoked for almost 15 years & I stopped doing that choking cough when I quit.  Seriously, it makes such a difference.  I had an uncle who smoked reads for over 30 yrs, had a heart attack & quit, and started back from doing that "i only puff the cigarette dont inhale thing".  he smokes reds all the time again & went back to coughing all the time.

Has the size of your ear canal shrunk?  Have you noticed any dry discharge?  If so, it's likely you have an ear infection.  This is most likely if you are or are around smokers, or if you get water in your ear on a regular basis.  If it's been going on for more than a week and you can't even stick a q-tip in your ear, you need to get some anti-biotics FAST.  Wal-greens sometimes has urgent care clinics open late and on weekends, and if there's no 24 hour clinic near you, I'm afraid it's the ER.  Only if necessary because they charge an arm and a leg.  If it just started you'll probably be okay for at least the concert tonight if not for the whole weekend.  I hate to recommend it, but if it's just barely started, load yourself up with painkillers (be very careful and follow all the directions of course, checking up on warnings for drug interactions.), Don't drink or do drugs while you're on the painkillers, please, you have to keep yourself safe.  Keep the ear iced whenever possible, and sleep on the other side so the blood flow stays away from it, which will decrease the pain.<br>  <br>  If it's not an ear infection, I'm afraid I can't be of much help, sorry.

OLXv3DEAaa	The organ transplant groups won't accept them at all. And I don't think the prisoners have the option legally. The laws cover the way they're supposed to die and practically speaking none of the options allow for organ donation to take place before the heart stops beating. Once their heart isn't beating anymore the organs are useless. <br>  And prisoners aren't good candidates for donation of blood or organs anyway because they have such high risk for HIV, hepatitis, etc. <br>  <br>  Also ethically speaking they can never be sure if the prisoner is making the decision rationally and of their own free will, and doctors aren't allowed to just take the organs without consent because of ethics laws/rules. Plus I expect a lot of victims families would freak out- they don't want the guy to look good at all when he's dying, they want him to be punished. <br>  Yeah, anyway, its not really legal, its not practical and they won't ever allow it. Also its creepy/disgusting, thats what they do in China. Ughh. I think a better option is to try to increase the rate of donation in the rest of the population- its actually very low and there are a lot more people who could donate but it doesn't happen because they never discussed it with their families, etc.|`|13k2WKx8aa	With lethal injection I don't think so considering that the toxins would flow through the bloodstream.<br>  <br>  That's a good point though. Might as well put them down quietly and then harvest their organs (if they're eligible).|`|M3T4bosnaa	No the courts dont allow organ donation after the death penalty has been carried through with. Certain executions leave the organs unusable anyways.|`|0BcUdhnUaa	Well.. Umm... That's a good question. I would think they would give you the option. I'm starring, so if anyone knows the correct answer please post it.
T3OGT4Ntaa	Sounds like heartburn/acid reflux.  I've had this when I have really acidic foods, and even with vitamins.  I have 4 ounces of yogurt every day when I take my vitamin and I never have any problems.  Try it!  Yogurt is very good for you.|`|uJKTR4d2aa	Do you have acid reflux disease? Also called G.E.R.D.? I have that disease and feel that way sometimes after certain foods, or any foods.|`|Dw8eSSkGaa	this is called food poising.If you read below this will tell you all the facts abot food poising.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Food poisoning is a common, yet distressing and sometimes life-threatening problem for millions of people in the U.S., and throughout the world. People infected with foodborne organisms may be symptom-free or may have symptoms ranging from mild intestinal discomfort to severe dehydration and bloody diarrhea. Depending on the type of infection, people can even die as a result of food poisoning.<br>  <br>  More than 250 different diseases can cause food poisoning. Some of the most common diseases are infections caused by bacteria, such as Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, E. coli O157:H7, Listeria, and botulism.<br>  <br>  What Is Campylobacter Infection?<br>  Campylobacter is a bacterium that causes acute diarrhea. Transmission usually occurs through ingestion of contaminated food, water, or unpasteurized milk, or through contact with infected infants, pets, or wild animals.<br>  <br>  Symptoms of campylobacter include:<br>  <br>  Diarrhea (sometimes bloody) <br>  Nausea and vomiting <br>  Abdominal pain and/or cramping <br>  Malaise (general uneasiness) <br>  Fever <br>  Is Campylobacter Infection a Serious Health Concern?<br>  Campylobacter infection can be serious, especially in those with weakened immune systems. In rare cases, campylobacter infection can cause additional problems such as arthritis or brain and nerve problems. Occasionally, these problems occur after the diarrhea has stopped.<br>  <br>  How Is Campylobacter Infection Diagnosed and Treated?<br>  If you think you may have been exposed to campylobacter infection, see your doctor. By testing a sample of your stool, the bacteria can be identified.<br>  <br>  If you are found to have the infection, you will likely recover on your own without treatment within 2-5 days. Drink plenty of fluids to prevent becoming dehydrated.<br>  <br>  In more severe cases, antibiotics (such as Cipro), if given early in the illness, can be used to shorten the length of time you are sick.<br>  <br>  What Is Salmonella?<br>  Salmonella is a bacterial infection that can be passed on to humans from domestic and wild animals, including poultry, pigs, cattle, and pets. But most often, it is caused by drinking unpasteurized milk or by eating undercooked poultry and poultry products such as eggs. Any food prepared on surfaces contaminated by raw chicken or turkey can also become tainted with salmonella. Less often, the illness may stem from food contaminated by a food worker.<br>  <br>  Salmonella can escape from the intestine and go into the blood and travel to other organs. It may become a chronic infection in some people, who can be symptom-free yet capable of spreading the disease to others.<br>  <br>  Salmonella infections occur worldwide, but it is most extensively reported in North America and Europe.<br>  <br>  Symptoms of salmonella include acute onset of:<br>  <br>  Fever <br>  Abdominal pain <br>  Diarrhea <br>  Nausea <br>  Vomiting (sometimes) <br>  These symptoms, along with loss of appetite, can persist for several days.<br>  <br>  Can Salmonella Infection Cause Serious Health Problems?<br>  Although most people recover completely (which sometimes can take several months), salmonella infection may cause a condition known as Reiter's syndrome in a small percentage of people. Symptoms of Reiter's syndrome include joint pain, eye irritation, and pain when urinating. The joint pain of Reiter's syndrome may develop into a chronic arthritis.<br>  <br>  Salmonella infection rarely causes death, although it can occur in the very young, very old, or among those who have compromised immune systems.
u8CFwtyMaa	As neither of your parents are particularly tall, you may not get over the 6 foot mark.<br>  I think that a lot of the height potential is increased due to better nutrition in early life, so you'll probably be taller than your dad.<br>  My son was shorter than me at 17, but he's around 2 to 3 inches taller than me now, he stopped growing at about 22, I think.<br>  Hope this helps|`|6lmFyr2maa	well my neighbour is 19 and hes barely 5'0<br>  he has no pubic, armpit or facial hair and his voice hasnt broken.<br>  hes been diagnosed with a thyroid problem.<br>  <br>  um so yeah if you dont mind me asking do you have pubic hair?<br>  <br>  because if not i'd go and see your doctor, there are tablets you can take to help speed things up (as far as im aware thats what the medications do, but im not 100% sure).<br>  <br>  xxx|`|eCTSonKraa	wow my friend has the same problem hes 14 n it like 5'1''  but he kute so yea (in the 8th grade)<br>  welll get a 6 pack like he did lol<br>  umm make sure u have a nice dick idk wat 2 tell u
bxxwhP04aa	Try applying  Vicks Vaporub several times a day.|`|CtgBMZewaa	You can't have over 90 thats almost impossible.  Go to the dermatologist.|`|EYRlLHwLaa	Warts are just really nasty to try to get rid of sometimes.  You have to keep at it and at it.  See a dermatologist if you haven't already.  If you have seen one already, see another one.  Every one will have different techniques for recalcitrant warts.  They may try some injections into the warts that are very effective in some people.  Keep after it.  You will win eventually.|`|cI6vT8yJaa	As bad as this sounds, go to a dermatologists and have them freeze it. Once they do that, take an emery board and file it down, put a band aid over it, and repeat. I had a really bad one on my thumb and that worked great.

It doesn't provide pregnancy prevention. Start so many days after the beginning of your period as your dr told you. Using bc improperly can result in pregnancy.

TORBP6QIaa	D...she needs this surgery 5.3 is big enough...I had mine fixed at 5.0 and I also had my aortic valve replaced at the same time.  Do you guys have Bicuspid aortic valves...its a common occurence to have these 2 things together.  The bicuspid foundation has a lot of info about ascending aortic aneurysms.<br>  <br>  Here are a couple of web sites that will give you a lot of info you can trust.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bicuspidfoundation.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bicuspidfoundation.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.valvereplacement.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.valvereplacement.com/</a><br>  <br>  A valve replacement may not be actually what she is needing at the moment but many people on there had both surgeries done (like me) at the same time to save another surgery in 10 yrs time to fix the valve.  It will give you both a lot of useful info to think about.  <br>  <br>  I was not at all scared when I went for my surgery, I was actually excited to get that aneurysm gone so I wasnt in danger from it.|`|vsaaaSsAaa	She really needs to have surgery on it.  If she hasn't lost the weight by now, she won't lose it.  Aneurysms are just ticking time bombs.  Tell her how much you want her to be around.  If an aortic aneurysm ruptures, hardly anyone survives from it because you bleed internally so fast.|`|Pld2h24Aaa	Tell her to go to her doctor and ask to get a minimally invasive endovascular graft put her aorta.  Its a procedure where a catheter is put through the femoral artery in the leg all the way up the aorta.  It is done with real time x-rays and contrast fluid so the Doctor doing the procedure will know the right place to the stent graft.  It should completely solve her problem and the aneurysm will stop growing.|`|rqW2JjiCaa	I dont know what the size limit is where you are from, but here (Australia), any aneurysm larger than 5cm is for surgery ASAP.
grm23kvjaa	I had the same problem and went thru tons of testing and all were normal/negative....UNTIL they did what is called a hida scan.  that was the only test that showed there was something wrong. It was my gall bladder and they had to remove it.  Dont let them try and tell you that you are not a canidate for gall bladder problems cuz that is what they told me.  Just tell them to run that test.  they put an iv in you and take pictures of ur gall bladder then give you a medication to cause a gall bladder attack which they watch on the screen to see how much fluid it is producing.  They measure it by numbers. they told me that in the thirties is normal, but mine was around 19 and that is really bad.|`|RxHb1P4Faa	I had something kind of like yours? I'm not sure though. Don't stomach ulcers take time to develop? <br>  <br>  Uh, I think what I had was a lot of acid. It stopped after I realized it was from when I get nervous and if I ate certain foods or something. <br>  <br>  I don't know too much, so I'm not sure if I can help you, but i'll try. What kind of pain is it? Is it a sharp pain? Do you ever taste a bitter taste in your mouth/throat? When does it go away?|`|rqW2JjiCaa	I would always like to do serology for H.pylori and also a urease breath test. If positive, then treat the bug... hopefully no more reflux!<br>  The definitive investigation (for H.Pylori and also ulcers) would be endoscopy with biopsies from the stomach, but I dont know how your doc would feel about doing it for you!
Zt6eh6VRaa	So it sounds like you had some clearing with Proactiv - and probably your skin adapted to it and now you need something stronger.<br>  <br>  Try to find a benzoyl peroxide solution that is 5% (Proactiv is 2.5%) and wear it all over your face all night. <br>  <br>  That will help your acne alot, but it usually takes more than that to get clear. We give our clients some kind of exfoliating serum along with benzoyl to get them all the way clear. And we change up how they use their homecare about every two weeks to keep up with the skin's ability to adapt to products. <br>  <br>  I would love to help you with your skin problems. We do have a great long-distance program. Check out the website below if you want more info on that. If you want more help with your skin, email me at info@facerealityacneclinic.com<br>  <br>  Mineral makeup (like Bare Minerals) is good for covering up acne. You want to make sure that you are not using makeup that has pore clogging ingredients in it. Go here for a list of pore cloggers:<br>  <a href="http://www.facerealityacneclinic.com/img/Pore%20Clogging%20Ingredients%20in%20Skin%20Care.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.facerealityacneclinic.com/img...</a>|`|WjESRTiKaa	Skin care is not a topic of recent times; it has been in practice since ancient times, when herbal skin care was probably the only way to take care of skin. However, skin care has transformed in a big way. Herbal skin care routines have been replaced by synthetic/chemical-based skin care routines. The herbal skin care recipes which once used to be common place are not so popular today (and even unknown to a large population). This transformation from herbal skin care to synthetic, can probably be attributed to two things – our laziness (or just the fast pace of lives) and the commercialisation of skin care. Even herbal skin care products have been commercialised. These commercial herbal skin care products have to be mixed with preservatives in order to increase their shelf-life, hence making them less effective than the fresh ones made at home. However, it seems that things are changing fast and more people are now opting for natural and herbal skin care routines. But still, none want to make them at home and hence the commercial market of herbal skin care products is on the rise.<br>  <br>  So what are these herbs or herbal skin care mechanisms?<br>  <br>  Aloe vera, which is an extract from Aloe plant, is one of the best examples of herbal skin care product. Freshly extracted aloe vera is a natural hydrant that helps in soothing skin. It also helps in healing cuts and treating sun burns.  <br>  <br>  A number of herbs are known to possess cleansing properties. Dandelion, chamomile, lime flowers and rosemary herbs, are a few examples of such cleansers. Their herbal skin care properties get invoked when they are combined with other herbs like tea. <br>  <br>  Antiseptics are another important part of Herbal skin care. Lavender, marigold, thyme and fennel are good examples of herbs that are known to possess antiseptic properties. Lavender water and rose water also form good toners.  <br>  <br>  Tea plays an important part in herbal skin care.  Tea extracts are used for treatment of skin that has been damaged by UV radiation. <br>  <br>  Oils prepared from herbal extracts present another means of herbal skin care.  Tea tree oil, Lavender oil, borage oil and primrose oil are some popular oils used in herbal skin care.  Some fruit oils (e.g. extracts from fruits like banana, apple and melon) find use in shower gels (as a hydrating mix)<br>  <br>  Homeopathic treatments and aromatherapies also come under the umbrella of herbal skin care remedies. <br>  <br>  Herbal skin care is good not only for the routine nourishing of skin but also for treatment of skin disorders like eczema and psorasis. Most herbal skin care products don’t have any side effects (the most important reason for preferring them over synthetic products) Moreover, herbal skin care products can be easily made at home, hence making them even more attractive. So, herbal skin care is the way to go. However, this does not mean that you totally discard the synthetic products. Some people go to the extent of debating with their dermatologist, if he/she suggests a synthetic product. You should accept the fact that some skin orders might need usage of clinically proven non-herbal skin care products.|`|4ew4ogH8aa	well, you're probably going through puberty, in which case it'll clear up a LOT in the next 2-4 years. If not, I would suggest using facewash with either microbeads or some sort of rouh small things in them. Like Apricot face scrub or something. Wash your face every day. It'll keep it free-er of oils and so, less zits. <br>  <br>  I tend to pop zits. I can't stand having a pus pocket on my face. And everyone can see it. I'd rather they saw a cleaned cut and feel cleaner at the same time. Ew...festering
fQgG62SRaa	Your sub-concious has control. There are thoughts of what others will say IF you change religions. Have you told those closest to you that you want to change? What do they think? Are you afraid of being banished from the family and friends? <br>  <br>  To change, you must be honest with yourself as well as to others. Don't be afraid to of what you don't know (what others may think). And, if you truly want to be a Mormon, talk with those in the Mormon church about how you feel.<br>  <br>  By the way, you think the temple is something to see from the outside, wait till you've seen it on the inside!!!|`|688a7b812dded24c0867e947aee9d86aaa	That is because Joseph Smith is a lunatic and a fraud.  There are plenty of other Christian religions that are much better.  Try some of those if you are interested in Christianity.<br>  <br>  It's probably your gut telling you not to get into this cult.|`|mC4mnvGFaa	nothing, its the way you were raised. you have been told from birth that any other religion is evil and your brain is reacting to that. perhaps you should consider reading the bible first, since your religion is supposed to be based on its teachings.|`|OLnmXeWDaa	Muslim or Mormon, what a choice. So sorry you can't open your eyes.
EbYroyhsaa	The redness will naturally go away in say 6 weeks, 3 months + depends how bad the scarring is. The skin tissue below the surface of the skin needs to heal- this part is aggravated with acne. So nothing you really do will get rid of the redness, as we are dealing with skin tissue below the surface of the skin. Sometimes gycolic acid in md formulations will help the skin tissue replenish faster, it depends how deep below the surface it is. <br>  If you are prepared to pay the money, you can get laser treatment from a DR who specialises in dermatology. It costs about 300 per session and you may need 1-3 sessions. Laser gets to the skin tissue below the surface of the skin and heals it. It is the quickest way to get rid of it. You have to weigh up the benefits and costs of doing this, as it might be worth just waiting until it naturally heals, if it is not bothering you that much. it is on your back- you probably notice more than other ppl.|`|tWeDGLg4aa	i don't know how to make the redness go AWAY, normally any acne redness i get goes away on its own.  but if you're going to have your shirt off and you're embarrassed, you can use a green based powder to mask it.  it may sound weird, but the green counteracts the redness. try it.|`|vvVrbB4Daa	have you tried massage? it might sound stupid but it might work!!!! my back has alotta pimples and i just wash it everynight. that doesnt really work, lol but im pretty sure in a few years it'll calm down. ask a dermotologist :)<br>  <br>  good luck
kMIzNpEsaa	it can happen if you have dry mouth. or a medication side effect like pepto bismol. sometimes it can even happen  if you have heartburn. but it is only very dangerous if you have an almond taste or almond smelling breath with no cause ( like eating almonds...no duh) along with this taste, as that can mean cyanide poisoning.|`|O0VQqIkDaa	Are you taking antibiotics?

It will most likely be brown discharge at first, so be prepared. A sign you will get it in a few days is that yoyr discharge will come out more stringy and there will be more of it.

1LaWDd7Eaa	Okay you can make yourself stronger.. . with exercise and weights or even without weights. you can jump the skipping rope for cardiovascular ! or do Jogging, <br>  <br>  however Firstly dodging and learning to get out the way is the most important thing in self-defense. then either run or be in control of you attacker so that you can place them under Citizen's arrest.  then you can Call the Police and whatnot !! <br>  <br>  Attacking is not necessary. <br>  <br>  Safety first <br>  <br>  Let them make the first move,  otherwise the Police will be after you. <br>  and you don't want that do you...   <br>  <br>  If they attack hard and you move out of the way they'll loose their balance and fall only to hurt themselves. <br>  <br>  Violence is never the answer. <br>  <br>  the only way to deal with such people is to use self-defense and trick them so that they fall hard and they'll learn at Karma works negatively on them ! <br>  <br>  I do not recommend you to draw first blood..   Karma is a B***, <br>  and if you do bad Karma will get you..   <br>  <br>  If you do good Karma will reward you.<br>  <br>  So its up to you on what action you take. <br>  <br>  Just heed my warning and think about what I've said. <br>  <br>  good luck and remember Safety first !|`|9SSO454taa	you dont need to be a body builder to be tuff look at bruce lee you need self defence classes, if you want a stronger upper body press ups and a punch bag plus sit ups.|`|h3VqVwbQaa	do stuff like push up, pull ups etc|`|Cfuy2fHSaa	go to your schools weight room
tXmu16Niaa	Water is key...it flushes out your system of all the bad toxins.  Take your current body weight and half it.  Half of your body weight is how many ounces of water you should be drinking a day.  It might be frustrating in the beginning, because you feel like a baby going to the bathroom all the time, but that is just because your body is getting used to the water.  After a while it will begin flushing out the stored water in your body because it knows that you are going to provide it with the right amount of water.  It helps you drop the pounds faster.  Couple that with better eating and a 20-30 minute walk a day, you should see results.  Good luck!<br>  <br>  All a laxative will do is dehydrate your body, causing you to retain more fluids in the end, which means more weight.|`|72hMibsVaa	none.  this is a dangerous way to lose weight. <br>  <br>  tips to help lose weight healthy<br>  <br>  eat high fiber ie.. shredded wheat, whole grain, fresh fruits and veggies, <br>  <br>  lay off the fat... no butter, no fried foods, <br>  <br>  no fast food.  quit eating at mcdonalds so much  or if you do get a salad and lite vinegerette dressing. <br>  <br>  drink more water.  cut out the sodas and energy drinks. <br>  <br>  excercise 3 times a week for 30 minutes to an hour.   <br>  <br>  watch biggest loser and do what they do each night.  some have lost up to 17 pounds in one week on that show.|`|p0D4dxEqaa	Taking laxatives to lose weight is a very dangerous thing.

In fact it can make you look a lot worse.<br>  <br>  Reduce your calorie intake and exercise and keep a food diary.

nAp688tZaa	There are two options, one is a prescription and the other is natural.  The first is call Valerian Root.  It is natural and can be used for a muscle relaxant and also as a sleep aid. It smells a bit like a stinky foot, but it does work, usually within about 45 minutes of taking it.  The second is a non narcotic drug that was initially developed as an antidepressant, but is now used for migraine prevention and insomnia. You usually get sleepy and go to sleep within 30 minutes of taking your dose.  You do not get that groggy feeling that is so common with other narcotic sleep aids.  The drug is called Amitriptyline and can be started as low as 10 mg per night and slowly increased to find the dose that is the most effective for you.  I use it for migraine prevention, but it also makes me sleep very soundly.  If needed, and i wake up in the middle of the night, I have the ability, from my doctor, to take another 25 mg.  I am usually back to sleep within 30 minutes, and am able to wake at my normal time with no grogginess the next day.  It is not habit forming and when you feel that you no longer need it, you can wean off without any side effects. Since you have such a stressful job, the use of this type of sleep aid is very effective.  Good luck getting some sleep.  Try the Valerian Root first and if that does not work, try the Amitriptyline.|`|CtgBMZewaa	lunesta <br>  ambien<br>  zoloft<br>  and more...<br>  <a href="http://www.coreynahman.com/11_25_sleeping_pills.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.coreynahman.com/11_25_sleepin...</a>
syC3uQpjaa	Eat a lot of protein. Your hair depends partially on protein because protein builds your hair and keeps it strong. Eat fruits and veggies, meat, and low fat milk. <br>  Cut your split ends and hair tips. Trim your hair at least three times a month and your hair will grow even more. <br>  Eat carnitine. This will stimulate hair follicles in your head. As tests in labs show, canitine in meats, especially red meat, has a number of carnitine in it.|`|q0ce9dEnaa	Unfortunately, though many product claim you'll regrow hair, the truth is that mose just preserve hair.

AA12190953	When i was in forth grade i had a gap in between my two front teeth that was big enough that i could put a quarter in between them .  A the time i also had a friend who had braces and she gave me some of her little rubber bands that they use for braces.

I don't even think they could figure out who because so many people ended up with it.  Even though they are tested regularly, HIV isn't detected right away.  So if a guy gets it, say today, it won't show up for months.  Meanwhile, he's having all different types of unprotected sex with so many people by the time it's detected, it's too late.  You'd think porn stars would be scared but most aren't because they have a false sense of security.

ParFJxnSaa	See stress treatments, at ezy build, below, in section 42, and getting organised, in section 26. A certain level of stress is unavoidable, in modern society, so it is a good idea to develop effective coping methods. Light to moderate daily exercise helps fight stress. For some people, it helps to visualise a quiet, relaxing scene (imagine, as vividly as you can, that you are on a tropical beach, reclining comfortably; you luxuriate, as the the sun warms you, and a gentle breeze caresses your skin lightly, inhaling the tangy, sea scented, salt laden spray from the sparkling, translucent, aqua waves, crashing on the white, coral beach sand, and feeling the hot sand slip through your fingers in one hand, sipping your favorite drink with the other; all the while, the seagulls call, swoop and cavort playfully overhead in a cloudless, azure sky: you feel just like one of them, free to soar and cartwheel, or just glide in the moist, heavy air, and that this moment will last forever ... ). <br>  <br>  Options: Try: <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/meditat..." rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/meditat...</a>  & <a href="http://www.healthjourneys.com/free_audio.asp?f=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthjourneys.com/free_audio...</a> & <a href="http://www.meditainment.com/free-meditation-content/" rel="nofollow">http://www.meditainment.com/free-meditat...</a> & <a href="http://www.freehypnosistreatment.com/hypnosistreatment.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.freehypnosistreatment.com/hyp...</a>  Relaxation Hypnosis  Take 4 Omega 3 fish oil supplements, daily: (certified free of mercury) it is best if consumed with an antioxidant, such as an orange, or grapefruit, or their FRESHLY SQUEEZED juice. If vitamin E is added, it should be certified as being 100% from natural sources, or it may be synthetic: avoid it. The supplement DHEA is thought to counter the stress hormone, Cortisol. Ginseng & Lady's Slipper are recommended herbal remedies: see section 55, at ezy build, below. Practise daily, one of the relaxation techniques in sections 11, 2, 2c, or 2i; whichever works best for you, but the mindfulness breathing for 15 - 20 mns is ideal, although the progressive muscle relaxation can be learned quickly, and takes only several minutes, if pressed for time.

Employ the EFT version for use in public, for which you can reasonably claim that you have a headache, as you massage/tap your temples, but it may be advisable to restrict yourself to subvocalising (saying it to yourself, in your mind, not aloud). Section 53, and pages 2, 2.q and 2.o refer. "Even though I sometimes suffer from stress, I deeply and completely accept myself". A variant of EMDR: Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing therapy, which has been used successfully for those people suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, insomnia, and anxiety, is shown in section 42, on page i, at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> I have found that the 2 - 3 minutes spent using the EMDR markedly reduces distractions to the relaxation process, and is well worthwhile. You can also multitask, using the gazing technique, as you walk/jog or exercise, by focusing on a distant object, or just focus awareness on how each step feels, noting any thoughts which flash across your mind, without pursuing any particular train of thought, just gently redirect your focus to the task at hand.

Why don't you get some books from the library or the bookstore, and find out more about sex via the printed page?  Sex is a powerful thing, a great thing, and it would be a shame to treat it as recreational, or just following an urge.

Trust you mom, she seems like a good parent, and before long, that uncomfortable feeling will go away.|`|3sriJtSkaa	Don't stress about it. Even though getting your period is new and wierd to you, just think about the fact that half the people in the world are women and whether we like it or not, almost every single one of us has to deal with having our peroid. yes it's gross, yes it seems wierd at first, but your mom understands and she's there to help. <br>  Just think, pee is gross but the point is everybody does it.  You're not embarassed about telling your mom that you have to go to the bathroom, so try to think of it like that. having your peroid is a sign that your body is healthy and happy so if you don't want to have a big long discussion with her about it just yet, that's fine, but you should defintely tell her!|`|KOj8XOHPaa	You should tell her.

You should tell her so that she's aware of what's going on in case there is some sort of medical emergency or some other reason that she would need to know. Just do the mature thing. It's not a big deal. Well, I take that back, it IS a big deal. You're now a woman! You've earned your wings (maxi pad with wings, lol). But telling her doesn't have to be a big deal.

Technique For Re-Programming Negative Thoughts: When you notice something negative, such as: "I can't do this/ am never going to get over this!" or: "Why am I always so pathetic/useless/such a loser?" or even an image, emotion, or a memory; recognise that it is being generated from the negative part of your mind. Having identified and labelled it, visualise a large, red, flashing, "STOP!" sign, and/or possibly a stern faced person wagging an index finger at you in a negative manner, then say to yourself as forcefully as you can, even aloud in a big voice, if alone: "I know this tactic: GO AWAY FOR A WHILE !!!" You may want to use either: "ruse", "ploy", "game", or "trick". In the case of an image, visualise a large "STOP" sign, or your preferred version. <br>  <br>  Some people go so far as to keep a wide rubber band in their pocket, then put it around their wrist, when they catch themselves backsliding, stretch and release it, as a method of reprogramming their mind sooner, but I don't regard it as being strictly necessary. Remember to remove it, afterwards, if you use this method. Try replacing a negative thought with a positive affirmation of your choice, like: "I am a unique individual, with my own set of skills, and good points", or "I may not be perfect, but I'm doing the best I can, right now". Practice one of the relaxation methods in sections 2, 11, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed. Tai Chi, or yoga suits others better. Give the EFT a good tryout, to see if it helps you. There is a version for use in public places, (you can claim to have a headache, as you massage/lightly tap your temples, but you would then be restricted to subvocalising: saying it to yourself in your mind). Section 53, at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> refers: "Even though I sometimes lash out unfairly, I deeply and completely accept myself."|`|ZaLrtSd7aa	Walk away and don't deal with the situation for at least 3-4 hours until you've had time to cool down - it'll still be there when you get back. <br>  <br>  Oh unless the bad situation is a mate being beaten up - maybe you should attend to that right away, but otherwise take a little time|`|aRkYiXtGaa	just a question, have you smoked cannabis in the past?<br>  I was just asking as it can make you paranoid, in that case then, you have to think before you speak, deliberately think, make yourself think, otherwise you will lose your friends, try it, you m ight find it works, good luck to you|`|02965963da3f0165b81bd488737cfad3aa	Go and see a Doctor of Medicine - it sound as if you are suffering from Depression - a clinical disease.<br>  <br>  I suffered from it and I was given tools to deal with it.

Turn thy head, sweepea, and sort thy **** out because thou art not getting away with it!  <br>  <br>  Low mood, restless, stressed, paranoid.  You're not allowed.  That's 'emotionally insecure' and everyone gets it: but not everyone dishes it out.  There is a mile of difference between it occuring to you that someone might be out to get you, and them actually being out to get you.<br>  <br>  I left a boyfriend who really, really loved me because he did this to me:  he thought that the fact that he felt love for me was enough: but was always accusing me of sleeping with this guy, flirting with that guy, etc, etc.  I couldn't defend myself against it because he was accusing me of THINKING things and how can you prove you didn't do that?<br>  <br>  If you don't want to be the person left all alone, you'd better realise that the fact that you care for your friends is not a get out of jail free card.  You can still hurt them.  You can still betray them even if you care about them.  Watch yourself and grow out of htis as a matter of supreme urgency.  If you can't prove someone is out to get you, suck it up because the violence you commit when you treat them like they're doing it is so utterly cruel, you can shatter their lives and hurt them beyond compare.  If you knew how bad it was on the receiving end, you simply would not be able to do it to them.
BRFkc8pBaa	Yeah, you have a yeast infection. Go see your gyno.<br>  <br>  It should get better though. A lot of things cause them. It doesn't necessarily mean that you don't clean well enough. Antibiotics can cause them, in fact that's the most prevalent cause. After that its sperm, diabetes, menstruation, and some times birth control pills. <br>  <br>  Its not because you're gross or dirty though necessarily. Babies get them all the time and it could just be that you are extremely prone to getting them hereditarily. Tight clothing in that area can also trap bacteria in the area and cause them. But since your mom said she's had one its probably hereditary. <br>  <br>  Just keep using your cream and if after a week it doesn't go away, or it gets worse go see the doctor. Yogurt is definitely a good way to prevent them in the future but it wont get rid of the one you have right now.|`|GwWiaWI7aa	I would clean better down there and if your shavind down there than stop cuz that might be whats causing it.|`|2O9gM8KKaa	Yeaas .|`|8y24H37Maa	that happened too me too, and i just had sex and it went away!|`|p73oMCV8aa	It should|`|eqsIIuydaa	ooooook mmmm ,,, you should use PROACTIVE!

24mub7pHaa	like anything else, some are real and many are not, so be careful and check out the sites you are interested in. We have been using <a href="http://the-drug-store.com" rel="nofollow">http://the-drug-store.com</a> for a few years now and the quality and prices have been very good.|`|BHacM0GTaa	I can sympathize with your situation. I have been without health insurance for about 2 years now, as I am self employed and I can't afford the $500/month for private health insurance. I tend to get bronchitis every single time I get sick, which is often since I work with children. Needless to say, being out of work for weeks at a time to let me body naturally recover wasn't an option, as I don't get sick leave either. No work = no pay. I took a risk and ordered from a online pharmacy, and was actually surprised at how easy it was and I had my antibiotic the next day. They are a US pharmacy,and I got a prescription from a doctor using an online form. Pretty Easy, saved a lot of money over having to pay several hundred up front to see a doctor, and then having to pay full price for the prescription on top of that. The website I ordered from is called WithoutAPrescription.info|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	Most are, if they don't require a actual prescription then don't but often these are based in places like here in Canada were the Government has imposed limits on prescription medicine costs, that's why they are up to 1/2 the cost for the same drugs up here as compared to our American neighbours.|`|5c40baa93c7ba8164e45f151f1878025aa	Can you get any of your meds in generic  form?  My daughter uses WalMart and gets 90 days for $10.  I know what you are talking about but be very careful who you order from. Check them out thoroughly before sending any money.|`|LIlYZnJQaa	Online pharmacies are great.  I don't have health insurance and I use them once a month for my meds like my high blood pressure meds and my high cholesterol meds.  My friend gave me the site and I have been using them for over a year.  The one I use has U.S. licensed pharmacies and U.S. licensed doctors.  You don't need a prior prescription as you fill out a short form and if approved they fill and send your meds overnight.  <br>  <br>  The site I use is www.cheapestpharmacyonline.net<br>  <br>  Good luck and hope the job loss situation works out!
T3OGT4Ntaa	Stretch.  Like, REALLY stretch.  I exercise a lot and I try to stretch at least 3 times a day for 15-20 minutes.|`|M7LlQ2CBaa	Do stretching exercises and practice flexible things.. start small and work your way up, it takes time to become really flexible..<br>  <br>  if you exercise (something you should be doing if you want to dance) then remember to stretch well after practice.. try doing flexible  training exercises as well... :)
GiYVrmI3aa	You won't need to get them removed if they aren't crowding your mouth.|`|6c7e9e289fd5db36cd934c29dca6003eaa	Getting them pulled is way better than getting braces.  If you can just have it done.  Then you don't even have to worry about them causing problems later or making your teeth crooked.|`|CKW4PPJLaa	If they're fully grown in, then you're ok.
gNM35w7Raa	The physician pays particular attention to the heart rate, blood pressure, changes in the EKG pattern, irregular heart rhythm, and the patient's appearance and symptoms. The treadmill is stopped when the patient achieves a target heart rate (this is 85% of the maximal heart rate predicted for the patient's age). However, if the patient is doing extremely well at peak exercise, the treadmill test may be continued further. The test may be stopped prior to achievement of the target heart rate if the patient develops significant chest discomfort, shortness of breath, dizziness, unsteady gait, etc., or if the EKG shows alarming changes or serious irregular heart beats. It may also be stopped if the blood pressure (BP) rises or falls beyond acceptable limits. Please note that the systolic BP (upper number) may normally rise to 200 at peak exercise. At the same time, the diastolic BP (lower number) remains unchanged or falls to a slight degree. In contrast, the BP of patients with hypertension or high BP will show a rise of both systolic and diastolic readings. The latter may rise above 90 - 100.|`|Pld2h24Aaa	Well, that means that he may have something wrong with his heart.  Perhaps there is something blocking the some of the blood flow into his heart that is going to eventually give him a heart attack.  He better start taking care of himself ASAP.

Since when you smell you can taste things on your taste buds. But when you can't smell you can't breathe in the aromas. So when your nose is clogged food will probably taste like nothing.|`|kDab6zpTaa	yeah.and if your nose if plugged.|`|AA10267825	maybe|`|cn91FeWcaa	yes|`|kbxkkOYVaa	That's the same thing that happened to my cousin.

I might be wrong, but  from what I know, it's normal...
e5VUwaRsaa	Were you nervous?<br>  Had you been exercising beforehand?<br>  Had you had any caffeine?<br>  <br>  If the answer to these is no, then you should probably go and see a doctor. I had the same problem when I was 19 and it ended up being vitamin B12 deficiency!<br>  <br>  edit: Yes, a heart murmur can play a role. I had one too, but it has since gone away.|`|jibCx9Pmaa	Well,if it is your resting heart rate, you should probably see a cardiologist to make sure everything is ok. Mine is 90,but I drink a lot of caffeine.|`|sDfBDXpXaa	Most likely you just need magnesium.  This helps to regulate the heart rate.<br>  The modern medical community would slice you open and stick in a pacemaker.<br>  Muscle testing or kenisiologists would find out the real reason for your problem and give you a real solution.|`|216ef6efd780221df4689eda5ca350e9aa	So either you weren't really at rest, or you're suffering hypertension or something like that. It might pay to visit your doctor.|`|ZpltzTIfaa	No...normal is actually around 60-80. Mine is always in the 120's.|`|TiX5Z4Zbaa	Eat low fat food.|`|ICtwYntuaa	The average normal resting heart rate is usually given as 60-100 bpm.  People who run a lot tend to have lower rates in the 40s and 50s.  A rate of 120 is a bit high for rest, although it may be enhanced by stress or anxiety.  If this is something consistent, it may be a good idea to get it checked out, especially if you have any heart-related symptoms like shortness of breath or chest pain.|`|ymqL0Zeoaa	I'd say its something to be concern about. Normal heart rate for adults resting is 50-80. 100> is what we call Tachycardia which means your heart is beating too fast. Retake your HR and see where it is again. The time you did it in class did you have coffee or soda or anything with caffeine? If you did, how long ago was the intake prior to taking you HR? Is you blood pressure also elevated? If this continues on as your regular HR, you need to visit your doc so he/she can treat it.<br>  History of heart Murmur. Do you have a pacer? if you just woke up and your HR is still high and you felt like your heart skipped a beat, you definitely need to go to the E.R. get and EKG done and dont forget to mention about your heart murmur. A heart skipping a beat is not normal and requires immediate attention.|`|QjZrg2h4aa	its not really bad but it is high.keep an eye on it and please dont freak out because that will only make it go faster.if you feel your heart going fast for no reason that is,time it.<br>  find a watch or a wall clock thats not digital and count your heart rate for 15 seconds.after youve counted for 15 seconds mulitply your heart rate by 4.if its over 140 thats not normal and get to a hospital but stay clam 140 is not really really bad its just something not to ignore.<br>  <br>  take care.|`|a766661bb7dbb13127569416a3fd110eaa	yes you might want to go to the doctor or figure out if maybe you did it wrong and try again.
df6e5b1a8d31db24d73d45f4db076d71aa	My friend's mom (a doctor) told me  to start going for PAPs when I either started having sex or by the time you are 23.  If however you have genital-to-genital contact with a partner, it's a good idea to starting going for paps.  This is because the virus (HPV: Human Papilloma Virus) that causes abnormal cervical cell changes, can be transmitted even without having intercourse!  Abnormal cell changes is what the PAP is monitoring for.<br>  If you are still a virgin, there is a possibility that the hymen will break during a internal pelvic exam BUT it doesn't happen all the time (since they will be very gentle, knowing you are a virgin).  Also, be aware that most active girls (i.e. girls that play sports, exercise, horseback ride...etc) no longer have an intact hymen - this is actually quite normal!!<br>  <br>  I had to have an internal exam before I had ever had sex and although it was slightly uncomfortable, it didn't hurt!  If you need to go for an exam, tell your doctor about your situation and they will be very gentle.  Also, you can ask to have your mom, or friend or the nurse be in there with you.  I had a nurse hold my hand the first time and I am sure that helped me calm down a lot (the more scared your are, the more uncomfortable it is).<br>  <br>  Cheers|`|8y24H37Maa	Well, a woman should get her first PAP when she becomes sexually active but you can go there if your period is off in any major way. Your obgyn might want to do perform one if you want to go on the pill..<br>  <br>  <br>  It hurts like a mother if you have not had sex. No, the only way to detect if something is wrong is by looking in your vag. It will def break your hymen and your obgyn will laugh.|`|qitXGd0qaa	Most doctors recommend a yearly pap once you're 18 or sexually active, whichever comes first.<br>  <br>  I don't know about it tearing your hymen though I think it probably would.<br>  <br>  And no, there isn't a way for other tests to check for the same things as a pelvic exam and pap test. Your doctor is checking the size and position of your ovaries and uterus as well as cervical abnormalities, that can't be done without a physical exam.
rZyTDm9Waa	Better discuss with qualified doctor than going with answers from here. Too risky to get your own medication... Humudifier, keeping room temp low and wearing warm, light clothes will help.

sp4CifVSaa	ive been in ur position before, but my friend knows that i kick so he knew it was coming (didnt help him though) <br>  guys are really sensitive when it comes to their nuts.. and a tap can hurt.. <br>  if he deserved it and u feel like u did nothing wrong then dont apologize<br>  <br>  if he started crying then it must have hurt alot, and he may have overreacted with the whole cursing you out thing.. <br>   <br>  its ur call.. u can always be the better person and apologize (so he feels like he got his masculunity back- its a really big issue with guys- they dont like looking weak)|`|ICtwYntuaa	Yeah...not only is it so psychologically detrimental to be put into such a position of weakness and vulnerability (especially by a girl), it hurts like bloody hell.  There is really only one justifiable scenario for kicking a guy below the belt, and that's if your life is on the line.  <br>  <br>  An apology is definitely in order if you intend to stay on speaking terms.|`|ZEitfScGaa	I doubt that he is over reacting at all. <br>  It doesn't take much to cause serious pain down there. And believe me, for a guy it is some of the worst pain you can feel. Its hard to even describe. You get dizzy, everything gets bright. Weird and very painful.<br>  Actually, the slightest of "taps" can cause the most pain. So yes, apologize.|`|PpgJUpINaa	You should apologise because a kick in the groin is the worst pain a guy can experience. He probably wasn't over-reacting. Some guys cry, some guys bottle up their emotions. To let out his emotions and pain, he yelled those things. <br>  It was just an impulsive reaction, he might not have meant what he said. From now on, don't kick a guy in the nuts, slap him across the face.|`|XWrojqwQaa	It actually hurts more if you miss slightly and to be honest he is probably still unable to sit down without writhing in pain.|`|887cdB42aa	Never kick a guy in the balls. It feels like getting punched in the stomach but lasts 3 times as long and makes you throw up sometimes.|`|hyr3xylLaa	It's the after pain that fúcks you over the most. So yes, I would apologize.|`|I2Hh3kRQaa	it does hurt|`|rFUqIakAaa	I don't know why girls think that you have to KICK a guys balls for them to hurt. All it takes is a TAP and they hurt. You have no idea how sensitive they are. You probably did hurt him pretty good even if it didn't appear that way to you. You should NEVER kick a guy in the balls. Doing so could make him sterile and he might not be able to have kids if you did that. It's nothing more than assault! That should only be done if some guy is attacking you and you need to get away from him. So YES you should apologize because that's a really f*#ked up thing to do,  I don't care how much he was "pissing you off".|`|zOIgzIy4aa	any place in that area is very sensitive.|`|AA11522944	DON'T kick guys in the nuts... unless they are bashing you or something.  it's just dumb and you could make him infertile.<br>  <br>  Hope he's ok or you could get sued.|`|lCvJHS13aa	It probably did really hurt, in the wrong pace or hard enough, he could be damaged permanently. <br>  <br>  He should file assault charges against you.|`|vQmO3N6Raa	NEVER kick a guy in the balls. that;s just morally messed up.<br>  apologize. haha.|`|cDKkKEgvaa	I think he should appologize for what he did to you......and you appologize for kicking him in the balls....that's never cool<br>  <br>  Just settle your differences|`|47l1Sumeaa	That's not ....right...|`|RSBufJHUaa	What you did is called ASSAULT AND BATTERY. A 7th grade girl in a local school was dared to kick a 9th grade boy in the testicles.  She did and kicked him so hard he fell to the floor moaning and crying, vomited and urinated on himself.  She and her 'friends' stood around and laughed at him.  The boys parents took out a warrant for her arrest.  She was suspended from school for 10 days (no make ups), she got a fine and  20 hours of community service.  <br>  How'd you like if someone kicked YOU in 'that place' between YOUR legs?  <br>  You're lucky he didn't beat the crap out of you.|`|q0ce9dEnaa	Actually, odds are he's not overreacting at all. Pain in the groin can occur from just sitting down wrong; a "tap" could certainly lead to a lot of pain, although screaming those words was a bit unnecesary in my opinion.|`|u15hauUCaa	Being grazed can hurt just as much, if not more than a full on kick.<br>  <br>  But don't apologize if he had it coming.|`|EiB6GNxlaa	ummmmm dont do that again to anyone.. ever!<br>  <br>  it is the most painful thing ever & the pain lingers.|`|Dv1UMYqUaa	you need to apologise to him with a kiss to the balls|`|kU66m5QRaa	OVERREACTED!!!!!!! how do you know!! are you a guy?THAT iz the most painful **** you could ever do to a MAN!!!|`|i5hio2Anaa	dude<br>  that's so fuccckked up.<br>  big time|`|l7GjBVvhaa	You're pretty immature to be kicking a man in is balls. You do understand that many guys can become infertile that way?! How dare you stoop to a level like that and do such a thing. The balls of a man are very sensitive and are not to be treated that way. I would def call him and apologize for what you did. Let him know you did it out of anger and was because he was irritating you. Grow up and find a different way to express your anger, minus kicking a guy in the balls. There is no way a girl can every understand how painful it is. Why do youthink they were cups during sports? Hello.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Be seeing you.....
DYUfnPzhaa	I hope these excerpts help!<br>  <br>  Even if all of the structures of the eye work perfectly, what we know as vision cannot happen without the brain's interpretation of the electrical impulses sent by the retina.  The optic nerve is the bundle of retinal fibers that exits the back of the eye and transports electrical impulses to the brain where they are interpreted in the primary visual cortex.<br>  <br>  When all parts of the visual system are working, the eyes can move together, can adapt to light and dark, perceive color and accurately evaluate an object's location in space.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  VISION--HOW WE SEE THINGS<br>  <br>  Information from our eyes goes to areas at the very back of the brain. We've all seen cartoons where the rabbit gets hit on the head and the rabbit sees stars. This can actually happen in human beings (trust me, not a good thing to do at home!). If you take a hard enough blow to the back of the head, this brain area bangs against back of your skull. This stimulates it and you can see stars and flashing lights. Remember those two hemispheres? Each hemisphere processes half the visual information. Visual information that we see on the left gets processed by the right hemisphere. Information on the right gets processed by the left hemisphere. Remember, wires that bring in information to the brain are "crossed"--visual information from the left goes to the right brain.
B3TMhN6Aaa	You may need a different style of "temples".<br>  <a href="http://www.visionrx.com/Library/enc/enc_eyeframes.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.visionrx.com/Library/enc/enc_...</a><br>  <br>  Never knew that was what the "arms" were called.<br>  <br>  The hooked over style may be more secure than those with a single angle.<br>  <br>  A different bridge style may be better as well, and definitely go for the highest index plastic lenses possible, to keep the weight to a minimum.<br>  <br>  If you're talking about "transitions" photochromic, you CAN get photochromic in plastic now, more expensive, of course.

xFv6LirIaa	Have you tried closed toe, backless shoes?  Also they make the kind that has an elastic back strap.  Its an idea for a dressy shoe.|`|VpU4Aludaa	Your feet are pretty.<br>  I think it's NOT bad when you wear size 9.<br>  thanks.<br>  lovely weekend.
697ae04db2502a1d77e3c8fb84237406aa	if you don't want a mark & you want the scab to dry out, put 8 drops of fresh lemon on a cotton ball and put it on the scab.  It will sting but it won't leave a scar and it will shorten the length of the scab without you picking at it.|`|CtgBMZewaa	If you take it off prematurely it will give you a scar.|`|DFwvcUnhaa	The scab is a protective cover that keeps the wound moist enough to heal. If you pick it off the healing will be slowed and the scar will be deeper.
8NZC6LsRaa	they are flipping SEXY! <br>  I love men with beards..heck yeah!|`|AW96nSpUaa	well it depends<br>  <br>  i like the whole 5 oclock shadow thing, thats a major turn on for me, but a full out santa beard is such a turn off<br>  <br>  :D peace|`|Iw3ot1oDaa	as long as they are maintained they are sexy|`|UzFWLTquaa	None, beards are gross and they make you look old and like Grizzly Adams.|`|JeQZf8Inaa	definetely sexy!! not too much though|`|e85fe4bdb9a336b03f84f561231135f2aa	sexy? ha maybe if you're into the homeless type. gross, no thank you.|`|Y1avZXOfaa	they get a little irritating when<br>  ur trying to kiss someone.|`|l7GjBVvhaa	Depend on the guy. I love them when the look right and suit the person sporting them...<br>  <br>  I like the 5 o clock shadow look but dating a guy now with a full on beard that is so sexy and soft. He is 27 and damn hot wit it. Love digging my fingers in there while we kiss. Always smells so good.

ICtwYntuaa	Well, corn dogs explode because the water that heats up turns gaseous and exerts a lot of pressure from the inside of the corn dog.<br>  <br>  Theoretically, if you got a person hot enough without burning or melting their bodies, they probably would explode as well.  The human body has various orifices that can expel gases, and as the skin bursts more pressure will be relieved, but if it's fast enough, it should be possible.  Although the person would die way before it happened.|`|1oNi2v38aa	......|`|RhXugkTtaa	they would hav a heat stroke...i think and then die?|`|bjcjQ4zfaa	You'd get way better answers if you posted this in the chemistry or biology section instead of the health section|`|Lft0y0bhaa	wouldnt they melt?
563ad9f2bfae6966af447edf77ed7800aa	I seriously doubt that you'd get in trouble; I've never heard of any school policies not allowing contacts. <br>  And it's entirely appropriate. =)|`|zBhwEbUkaa	I wore colored contacts in high school and none of the school staff every said anything. Go ahead and wear them.|`|lBWSqyCGaa	As long as they're a natural honey color...who's gonna know? I doubt anyone in authority would notice.|`|P8xN2IzIaa	You should just wear them and say they are prescription.  What can they do?|`|rgTsbp0iaa	YES|`|quiFJfEtaa	I guess u can, just say they are your natural colour!!!|`|CtgBMZewaa	lol that is weird...why would you wear contacts just to change the color of your eyes...
T3OGT4Ntaa	Sometimes.|`|KAnEq8Laaa	Sometimes yes, and sometimes no.<br>  <br>  People gain weight for a number of reasons, but it usually works out something like this: person does not burn off the calories they consume = person gains weight. But what you must remember is that there are as many reasons that people consume more calories than they burn off as there are people. <br>  <br>  In my case, I live with a disability which prevented me from moving or really getting out of bed for nearly seven years, which is a very long time. In addition, I was for long stretches of time treated with steroids, and other medications that are known to help a person gain weight. Therefore, weak and immobile, and taking such medication, I had two causes for weight gain--and gain it I did.<br>  <br>  Now that I have had, and recovered from, surgery to assist in correcting one of my mobility problems, which previously my insurance would not pay for, my mobility issue is working toward resolution. In addition, now that I no longer need steroidal medication, I feel a lot better and have been able to be upright, and thus, aggressive about losing weight and getting in the best shape that a person with a disability can--and this week I have lost 52 pounds, with just a couple more to go. <br>  <br>  Were I still confined to bed, and still taking steroidal medication, I am pretty sure I would still be much heavier than I am.<br>  <br>  Many people have problems like mine--and even so, weight loss and general fitness are not impossible. But before you judge anyone--ANYONE--for their size, their color, their clothes...ask yourself if you know their story. If you don't, then please withhold judgment.|`|4f46a3ab367e69b76b30e6290112ed68aa	It can be, but there is an abundance of fast food that is cheap. There are even some fast food restaurants that refuse to post their nutrition information. There is an abundance of ignorance and not enough education on diet and exercise early enough. Our society moves way too fast and this is the fallout. People don't stop long enough to think about what they're putting in their mouths.|`|TYYI6T91aa	Yes. All it takes is some self-control to be skinny. Fat people have little self-control or they just don't care and have no will power. I don't know whats worse. Yuck.
QxIhMHwAaa	That happens to a lot of people, and it has to do a bit with blood pressure. It can happen when you haven't been moving a lot so your heart rate slows to a relaxed level. When you get up suddenly your blood has to circulate more quickly to keep your muscles working...therefore it routes blood away from the brain for a few seconds which can cause you to feel a bit dizzy for those few seconds before enough blood can get back up to your brain. <br>  <br>  Try just getting up slower. If you're sitting with your legs all bent up, straighten them first and just move to the end of the seat for a few seconds, the just stand up slowly/normally.<br>  <br>  Of course if you are very concerned, see your doctor about it. Only they can tell you for sure what it is.|`|P8xN2IzIaa	I get like that too if I stretch and stand up I feel like I have to fall and I lose my balance for a sec, but it's only if I stretch while standing.  It's so weird.
lgWHpbuEaa	healthquotes.awardspace.info - here is my health insurance plan. As I remember they can provide such a service.
qYCeR1fKaa	For the blood test u need to wait at least 3 months to get an accurate test. It takes from a month to 6 months to build up antibodies. It really depends on your immune system how quick u will get herpes. I would say 50% of people get them within the first 5 to 15 days. The rest either later on down the line or they don't show no systems at all. <br>  <br>  I was diagnosed with type 2 herpes about a month ago. I had a few signs & symtems but nothing noticeable. Around my period i had 1 bump down below. After my period was done i treated it with lip balm & within about 6 hours or so the pimple was gone. I had that pimple pretty much the whole time i had my period. Other then that i had no other signs or symtems. Usually when u have an outbreak you will get a temperature of 102, muscle aches, & headaches. It sorta mimicks the flue actually. So with me 1 pimple didnt signify an outbreak. At this time when i found the pimple i hadnt takin the blood test yet cause i had no idea i needed even to take a blood test. Even though i tested positive on jan 16 i think ive had it sense around nov of 08. Its pretty scary. Thats why i said your blood test is safe to take at about 3 months. So take that date u slept with this dude & add 3 months to it & then call your doctor. If u would like to chat hit me up. Tracypatzold99@yahoo.com|`|ZIOLl00xaa	you can get tested while there are no signs or symptoms... herpes antibodies will be in your blood and show up in a blood test and herpes could be oral or genital. get tested asap i got tested three weeks after i had sex with my partner and it showed up. I never heard of no 3 month waiting period. consult your doctor because herpes is serious and not curable. good luck
nN2pIykfaa	varnish the cat? only joking lol have you tried anti-histimine tablets?|`|xIowgWL7aa	You might want to consider allergy shots if you don't want to get rid of the cat.<br>  <br>  An allergist can test to see if you really are allergic to cats and what would be the best course of action (shots or medication).|`|3sriJtSkaa	dude, it will NEVER get better. <br>  I'm sorry, I know you don't want to hear that... everyone's  body is different but I know in my case I took every prescription imaginable, i washed her, took her to the vet to try to find a solution, I evene had allergy shots for 2 years and i still couldn't hold her without being completely miserable. my best advice is to either try to get rid of him while he's still young or try all these remedies ASAP to see if they work for you and maybe you can keep him. it's much harder to get rid of an adult cat. <br>  in the end, I kept my cat but I can never hold her or let her sleep in bed with me. it kinda sucks. <br>  best of luck|`|bd12e48132951f215b7fe910f10580d4aa	Is he long-hair or short-hair domestic?  I have 2 shorthair and 1 long haired, so have a bad problem with shedding.  If you will use something like the Furminator (got mine at Petco for about $40) and brush him every day or every 2 days, this should help a lot.  I also got 1 of those sponges to clean the hair off the furniture.|`|cR15v6DTaa	You will have to go to the<br>  doctor and see if he/she <br>  can help.<br>  or the cat goes, sorry.
vEVtXftTaa	If she says it's okay, she can have whomever she wants in the room with her.  My mom came in with me once... I know she's a woman also, but it really doesn't matter as long as your girlfriend says it's all right.|`|6NA2MXNPaa	As long as your gf says it's ok for you to go in you should be able to, unless the doctor says she'd rather not have you in there. Why would you want to go in with her?|`|CtgBMZewaa	exactly what the above person said.|`|BvHRriEyaa	I don't see why not, i would have thought it's upto her who does or doesn't come in the room and if you being there would help her feel more comfortable then I definitely can't see them having any sort of problem with it.<br>  <br>  (I haven't been to one yet so I wouldn't really know from experience)|`|DkVofG9paa	Yes you will be able to.  i used to bring mine all the time when i was young and dating.  now, i wonder to myself why did i do that!  It is much more comfortable going in the room alone and not being watched by your boyfriend getting looked at. just personal opinion|`|qitXGd0qaa	If she's alright with it you can. But be sure she really wants you there, that's something I prefer to do alone.|`|bmWKETgWaa	It seems awfully controlling to me.  If you have questions or concerns, have her write them down ahead of time and ask the doctor while she's being examined and interviewed.  They usually do say, "Any questions?"<br>  <br>  Let's allow the girl some modesty, OK?|`|8NZC6LsRaa	yeah but most guys don't.
8SRjELNBaa	You can still bulk up, just make sure you keep your body-fat % in check.

[e.g people of different ages, height, weight.] if you decide how much to take yourself it could be fatal.|`|ZaLrtSd7aa	You mean - like an antidepressant? That your doctor is probably been trying to get you to take?<br>  Nope can't think of anything|`|ZTRakv6maa	when ya get a bottle....send me some! i could use a pick me up.|`|G0QugnQ8aa	I wish
8HOdQMivaa	..go back to the doctors and tell them to sort you out!! they cant just leave you lazy bastards!!!|`|ahf98Vahaa	Have they sent you to the hospital to see a specialist in chest diseases.  If not, ask them to refer you, for your own peace of mind.  If they won't, get another GP who will refer you.  I won't speculate on the causes, there are too many of them, but a chest x-ray and seeing a specialist is the next step.  It's your health, insist on it.|`|AA10454278	You always have the right to get a 2nd opinion. If I were in your shoes I'd go to another doc!  I have had to do that before and I am glad I did.|`|0oOx1p5daa	well just go to a&e they cant dismiss this case and change gp if i was you|`|ur5wDhkMaa	It's simple enough babe.<br>  <br>  It has to come from your lungs, stomach or soft tissues.<br>  <br>  Cancer scan - sorry.|`|8y24H37Maa	your gonna die...... sorry to break it too you.

S5ZYHiFaaa	the so called "legal buds" are just scams that are directed to gullible people who have no common sense. they look like weed, but nothing else, they don't get you high, hell they don't even taste or smell like weed.<br>  <br>  the reason it's legal is because it contains 0.0% THC.<br>  <br>  anyways, if you're trying to quit smoking pot, the best way to go about it is cold turkey.|`|5KjvNg2oaa	no such thing
ZEitfScGaa	Don't waste your money. <br>  There is nothing that will enhance your "manhood".

Dv1UMYqUaa	Become a gigolo for nursing home patients
W46PN3eUaa	Drink more water. No really, most people don't drink NEARLY enough water. Something like 95% of headaches are caused by dehydration. 3 litres a day for guys, 2.5 for girls. Things like caffeine count as negative water because they're diuretics.<br>  <br>  Also, fruit is good for something tasty and (most importantly) easy. It would be really hard to eat too much fruit. Especially tomoatoes.<br>  <br>  Eat less meat. The average North American's diet includes FAR more meat than necessary.<br>  <br>  Hope this little bit helps.|`|0Pkup44haa	Exercise by running or walking, some sort of moving around. Fruit is always good to eat, I like frozen blueberries with some yogurt.
9yPEjN4Xaa	Those in authoritative positions love to use scare tactics. Get used to it.  The virus is transmitted only by the blood, semen, vaginal fluid or breast milk of an HIV-infected person. It is not transmitted by sweat, tears, urine, saliva or casual contact. That being said, it is still very disgusting to cause someone to drink someone else's urine. Urine can be very sterile, but it can also carry diseases like namely strains of Hepatitis which can vastly alter a persons life, how they live it and can cause a person to get very sick and die.<br>  <br>  So no HIV/AIDS, but yes to other illnesses.|`|zhk8o514aa	No. HIV, the virus that causes AIDS (SIDA in Spanish), is transmitted via blood, semen, vaginal fluids, and breast milk. There have been no documented cases of HIV contraction from urine, sweat, and saliva.<br>  <br>  In my point of view, he should have gotten more then 5 day suspension.|`|gSo4dR7oaa	HIV (virus that can lead to AIDS) can not be transmitted that way.  However, the student's behavior was atrocious.|`|0kXlNWcMaa	you can't get HIV from pee unless there was blood in it, but there's a whole list of other diseases that you can get.<br>  that kid shoud've gotten a lot more than a 5 day suspension!!<br>  he should've been expelled!<br>  the justice system these days...|`|d922d8a0409a4a04d2023991a654551aaa	Urine counts as body fluids. At the very least, it transfers bacteria into another person. Not very nice if the other person has a medical problem the pee-er doesn't know about.|`|vEVtXftTaa	Yes it is.|`|HKyQhBPlaa	probably, because its a body fluid. but, then it wouldnt be an std...|`|3fV6zRlJaa	certain Std's yeah but that is straight up digusting! He just be expelled on just that!!
LGidAYDwaa	(Read full answer. I do address your home remedies further down.)<br>  <br>  You need an expectorant to help thin the phlegm.  Mucinex makes one, but Robitussin's liquid is cheaper.  (You can even use the store brand to save even more.)  Look for Robitussin DM or Mucinex DM since you're coughing as well.  The active ingredient that is the expectorant is called "guaifenesen" and it's what you'll want to see on the label.<br>  <br>  If you can't get actual medication, you'd be better off just admitting you're sicker than you thought. Coughing the way you're doing, where the phlegm actually goes into your windpipe, can cause bronchitis or pneumonia.<br>  <br>  Home remedies that can help the medications work:<br>  <br>  a steamy shower<br>  hot tea<br>  spicy food<br>  a thin slice of ginger on the tongue<br>  drinking plenty of water (about 6 ounces per hour)<br>  and resting<br>  <br>  Try to avoid caffeine, since it will make your heart race. Making your body do extra work it doesn't have to will only prolong your cold/illness.|`|n6IBfiDPaa	Mucinex!!!<br>  <br>  I LOVE it.<br>  It will clear ya right up.<br>  <br>  But, have tissue ready, cuz for a lot of people, everything starts drainin out. lol kinda gross...but you will feel much better.|`|Ay7Fkvd4aa	Mucinex it works|`|Vw0cxAIDaa	any decongestent will workk =D

PpgJUpINaa	i work out a lot myself and i know what you're going through. i just do sit ups and bicycle cruches.<br>   <br>  Bicycle crunches: <br>  1) Lie on your lower back and lift your knees until your thighs are perpendicular to the floor<br>  2)Keep your hands behind your head<br>  3)Kick your right leg out and touch your left knee with your right elbow<br>  4)Do the same for the opposite limbs<br>  5)Continue this motion until your abs hurt and dont stop until you feel a 'burning' sensation<br>  <br>  REMEMBER: keep your upper back and head raised off the floor during the exercise; your weight should be concentrated on your lower back<br>  <br>  I hope this helped! Good luck with the ladies!!|`|1oNi2v38aa	When you get there you can hang upside down on a bar and do sit-ups. That's pretty cool and I'm sure they will be impressed...|`|2nsNvIanaa	get over yourself. if yr attitude is crap u will get no where.
kLN5hx6paa	Try drinking peppermint tea.<br>  <br>  Eat a more balanced meals try to advoid acid food like tomatoes, lemons etc. <br>  <br>  peppermint tea's can be found at most stores it helps the stomach and settles it. Try that if that doesn't help to much email and i can offer more information. I want to start off with smaller thingsm.<br>  <br>  Goodluck.|`|525m5qrTaa	Your story sounds familiar so I'll tell you a story and you tell me...  I went to Tijuana over the week a few years ago and after a night of beers, margaritas (ice?).  On the way walking back across the border we stopped at a little taco stand (pulled by an actual donkey).  Anyway, the next morning I got a little grubble which as the day progressed turned from a slight discomfort to a full on cramp.  By afternoon, I couldn't get up off the toilet and it lasted a whole week before I went to the doctor which prescribed antibiotics...  The moral of the story - stay hydrated
sWUAvk4vaa	Just put a little ice on it. There's not too much you can do. It takes time to heal. also, just eat softer foods, so its gentler on your tongue. good luck.|`|U4xcxvrhaa	suckk on a piece of ice|`|U3qTwOOIaa	bonjela is good if you have any (if is for baby's teething but works well on sore mouths) if not ice is good.  Also eat a bag of crisps, the salt in it will heal but will sting a bit.  Your own saliva has healing properties in it also, that's why dogs and cats lick their wounds (not that I am suggesting you are a dog or cat) but you get the picture!|`|6Btmg7Tcaa	I once heard that rubbing sugar on it is meant to help. I've never tried it so dont know if it works or not, no harm in trying i suppose|`|974f0b5b6385aa54a25619cd68541a47aa	mango juice is refreshing, cool and good for a burnt tongue!<br>  my personal favourite!

IMPvzBk1aa	It would not be an egg, but probably a tiny collction of blood or serous fluid that never was absorbed, and formed a little bump,  You can try applying warm moist compresses over it a few times a day to get it to resolve.  The other thing it might be is a foreign body embedded, especially if it was not actually a mosquito bite in the first place.  Or it could just be a lump of scar tissue.|`|Y32zA5Mfaa	Mosquitoes do not lay eggs when they bite you.  They lay eggs in water (preferably stagnant water).  You might be feeling scar tissue.  Did you scratch it when it was fresh?  <br>  <br>  If it annoys you to the point of wanting to remove it (like you can't leave it alone, picking at it), I would suggest going to the doctor.  They might remove it for you.  My mom had a big mole on the back of her neck that she WOULD NOT leave alone, so eventually they gave her some local anesthetic and cut it off.  Perhaps they'd do that for you too?  Just a suggestion.
