Include what it did or tried to do for the people of that time period.       How do you see the topic reflected in the 21st century? why has it continued today and if so why do you think it is still popular and important in the 21st century?      Expand please? It's supposed to be a essay about nickelodeon and how the silent films impacted the 1900s and still affects the 2000s?? Any help is appreciated!! Thanks! :0)

A typical example of this is underlined  a local council agreed a council tax for the coming year that puts an Extra   .￡45 per year on the current tax burden in an area that is swamped with loss of jobs, loss of homes etc. on top of that increase  has been advised that water rates are to increase by 5.3 % Just how do they expect all people who are under financial stress to meet this increase or, is there a sinister motive for more repossession's=.we are in the hands of complete Numpties=

KANSAS CITY, Mo. – Other than having a bit of a headache, a Kansas City woman was uninjured after a bullet fired at her ended up tangled in her hair weave. Police said the 20-year-old woman was in a convenience store parking lot late Wednesday when a man flagged her down and told her that her ex-boyfriend still loved her. She replied, "Well I dont love him," then heard gunshots.       She said she looked behind the vehicle and saw her ex-boyfriend firing a handgun at her. She stomped her accelerator and fled, then turned into another parking lot and called police.       Police arrested the ex-boyfriend and his friend in a car.        http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090220/ap_o...

Shortly after class, an economics student approaches his economics professor and says, "I don't understand this stimulus bill. Can you explain it to me?"       The professor replied, "I don't have any time to explain it at my office, but if you come over to my house on Saturday and help me with my weekend project, I'll be glad to explain it to you."       The student agreed.       At the agreed-upon time, the student showed up at the professor's house.      The professor stated that the weekend project involved his backyard pool.      They both went out back to the pool, and the professor handed the student a bucket.       Demonstrating with his own bucket, the professor said, "First, go over to the deep end, and fill your bucket with as much water as you can."      The student did as he was instructed.       The professor then continued, "Follow me over to the shallow end, and then dump all the water from your bucket into it." The student was naturally confused, but did as he was told.       The professor then explained they were going to do this many more times, and began walking back to the deep end of the pool.       The confused student asked, "Excuse me, but why are we doing this?"          The professor matter-of-factly stated that he was trying to make the shallow end much deeper.       The student didn't think the economics professor was serious, but figured that he would find out the real story soon enough.       However, after the 6th trip between the shallow end and the deep end, the student began to become worried that his economics professor had gone mad.      The student finally replied, "All we're doing is wasting valuable time and effort on unproductive pursuits. Even worse, when this process is all over, everything will be at the same level it was before, so all you'll really have accomplished is the destruction of what could have    been truly productive action!"       The professor put down his bucket and replied with a smile, "Congratulations. You now understand the stimulus bill."       Dick Johnson

By Matti Friedman, The Associated Press         JERUSALEM - Hawkish politician Benjamin Netanyahu urged his centrist rivals to join him in a unity coalition after Israel's ceremonial president formally tapped him Friday to assemble Israel's next government.      Tzipi Livni, the moderate foreign minister also vying for Israel's top job, appeared to leave the door open Friday to teaming up with Netanyahu. However, her price for doing so may well be too high for Netanyahu: a rotation arrangement in which both she and Netanyahu would serve as prime minister.    http://ca.news.yahoo.com/s/capress/09022...          "The current Jewish population of Iran is about 25,000,[3][4][5] though estimates vary. Notable population centers include Tehran, Isfahan, and Shiraz. Historically, Jews maintained a presence in many more Iranian cities, and Jews are protected in the Iranian constitution.[3] Iran supports one of the two largest Jewish populations of any Muslim-majority country (the other being Turkey),[6]."

People are protesting the NY POst for a cartoon depicting police officers standing over the dead body of a chimpanzee, with the caption "Looks like we are going to have to find someone else to write the stimulus bill."       The cartoon is obviously a crack at the political machine that has generate the stimulus bill, which is full of pork-barrel projects and other extremely wasteful spending measures in the time of a financial emergency. It was not meant to be a direct attack on Obama, but for the sake of argument, lets just say it WAS a direct attack on him...       The Post has been forced to issue an apology - you can read about it here:  http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090220/ap_o...        My question is, why are people so up in arms about this?? Because they misinterpreted the cartoon to be a stab at our new God, President Obama?? (And God forbid anyone says anything negative about him, it is considered blasphemous!)       I just wish to point out that, for the last 8 years, GW Bush has been mocked and compared to a chimpanzee over and over. There are pictures all over the net of Dubya next to a chimp, asking if they are separated at birth.       So what is the big deal about comparing Obama to a chimp, if we have done the same for the last President?      To me, this says more about the condition of racism in America than it does about the media. Both men are Presidents, both men are compared to chimps - in the case of Dubya, its all gravy, but when it is done to a black man, it is racist and should be punished??? Why the double standard?
