20090128133552AAJ3zj9	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	A question about making multi teared sculpted cakes?	my girl watches the food network challenge where they make the big crazy cakes with multi levels and extreme designs-my question.....is there any type of food product that has the strength of...lets say ..wood?   the reason i wonder is because they put all this stuff together but have no framework under the cakes(they use pvc pipe/wire ect just to hold the different tears together) i figured there was some kind of little rods(made out of sugar maybe,like a hard candy or something)that you could make a framework out of to make the cake stay together and have stability(kind of like rebar in concrete or a framework for a sculpture),but still have everything edible-my girl gets into these shows but i think its kinda funny that you would have to eat around plastic pipes-maybe the willy wonka movie spoiled me but i think everything should be edible and look  good lol

20080704225517AAkL5uE	Food & Drink;Vegetarian & Vegan	C'est quoi au juste pour vous "la chaine alimentaire"?	Un Q/Riste a réagit à une de mes tentatives à peine masquée de convaincre les gens au végétarisme dans une question  humoristique ( http://fr.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...  Il prétend que je ne comprend pas la "chaine alimentaire". Il a surement raison, car pour moi c'est une grande foutaise. La chaine alimentaire, c'est juste une manière de décrire une réalité observable, mais ce n'est  certainement pas une règle immuable que l'on devrait suivre. La chaine alimentaire c'est un moyen de dire que certains mangent les plantes (les humains par exemple), que d'autres mangent les mangeurs de plantes, que d'autres mangent les mangeurs de mangeurs de plantes et qu'enfin des bactéries finissent par tous nous bouffer. Le sommet de la chaine alimentaire ?a n'a jamais été (et ne sera jamais) l'homme. Ce sont les bactéries. Donc cette chaine alimentaire, n'est-ce pas finalement encore une tentative de l'homme de se croire au dessus des autres
