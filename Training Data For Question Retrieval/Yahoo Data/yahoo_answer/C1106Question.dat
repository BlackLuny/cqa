I'm not over weight, but I'm not exactly where I want to be. I'm 15 years old, 5'6 and about 125 pounds. I use to dance but due to knee injuries I had to quit. (so sad) So I don't exercise every single day like I use too. When I danced I was about 115-120. Since I'm tall it doesn't look too bad, but i have slight love handles (hate them!) That is the main thing that I want to get rid of. Everything else I want to tone. I run every day with my dog, and walk him everyday. And just about every other day I ride my bike 2 miles (lots of hills) So I got my legs under control. What can I do for my love handles and my butt? I want to tone by butt very badly. And loose a little weight in my butt.  What exercises can I do? What should my daily meals be like? I don't want to be anorexic thin, but I want to be a healthy weight. I need motivation to eat right. How can I be motivated? We usually don't have allot of junk food in the house, so I don't eat too bad when I'm at home. But when I go out its like "oh my gosh! I'm so hungry!" And then i eat everything in site. (not like I have a problem, i just really like sweets) Who doesn't though? Thank you SO much for your help! I really want to be healthy and have a great looking body. : )

Vous vous en souvenez certainement, elles étaient très populaires dans les années 80.   Il me semblait qu'elles avaient totalement disparu, mais rien qu'aujourd'hui (certes il faisait très beau et il y avait beaucoup de monde dans Paris) j'ai vu 3 gamins qui en avaient une et 2 adultes !    Ce qui m'a particulièrement étonné, c'est que les parents de l'un des enfants étaient très "bobos" et que l'un des adultes avait une trentaine d'années et semblait très "fashion-victim"...   Est-ce que cette mode reviendrait, un peu comme les "mullets" qui ont refait leur apparition ces dernières années ? Avez-vous remarqué quelque chose ?

HOW DO I EXPLAIN MY EYE TO TEH GIRL I LIKE? help?	i see this girl twice a week and i think she is real something. today in the morning me and my friend skipped first period to hang out and at the back parking lot of the school he decided to go talk to two other guys as he told me and i went inside the school just watching him from the door cause he said he’d come in after and i noticed they were getting in one another’s face and my friend threw a punch and knocked out the other guy, went on top of him and started beating him up i ran out the door grabbed my friend and aggressively pulled him off the guy with no intention of fighting the other guy out of no where threw a punch at me hitting me blank point on my mouth I fell on my a.ss and my friend quickly started punching the other guy and the first guy got up to beat up my friend so I punched him we had a little stand up but I tackled him in the snow and beat him senseless there and I looked behind my friend had done the same we got up and left. I only fought because this guy always refers to me as his younger brother in the school he always tells people I’m black even though I’m not he simply is, and we go to a black dominated school. So as a duty I did it. We went inside I went to the washroom and looked my lip was bashed and bleeding inside and out. And now 12 hours later my eye is starting to go black and my lips have already gone purple.      Im going to see this girl tomorrow and I don’t know if the face I have is a good one to see her with. I told my friend but he’s theory was “hey shes gunna think ur a tough guy all girls digg that no one likes a soft pus.sy! it shows character of a man that ur willing to get down and dirty” but my other friend said it was bad because she would think im abusive and violent. U have to understand I have a baby or boyish look to my I’m 5’8 130 lbs and people say still look the same as i did in grade 5.      What’s your take on this. What should I do? Is it a good thing or bad? If good how and what do I say or tell her, if bad well then how do I explain myself “I got beat up for my lunch money” this girl is older than me which really puts me in a position where I feel I have to really impress her. I mean bad enuff I look and have the body of a 12 year old where i can be replaced my a manlier figure easily but to have her think negatively of me because of it will just drown me.      Sorry for my spelling and length of it but I felt I needed to explain it as best as possible to get the best input from you guys.

20080313111347AALbBeW	Beauty & Style;Hair	Is there any way I can go back to my natural hair color?	Without growing my hair out (it's already super long, I don't want to cut it and wait for the nasty roots to grow out...plus that'd take too long).      What I have it dyed as isn't a HUGE difference from my natural hair color. They're both brown...but when my roots start to grow in, you can still tell there's definately a difference (and it looks nasty).      I'm just tired of not having the money to get it dyed when needed (I don't do the at home dying for many reasons), and it's a hassle...I just want my natural hair color back.       My cousin bought some at home kit for getting rid of highlights once. I don't know exactly how that works...or what it was...but it'd be nice if there was something I could do...other than grow it out.

The thing is, she's kind of goth and I'd love to send her something a little more her style than just a cutesey little bouquet.  However, I don't want it to be too "deathly" in a hospital setting.  Does anyone have any ideas for a classy yet gothy bouquet?  Please keep ideas to stuff that one would normally find in a floral shop.  Thanks in advance!!

20090203081846AA6opA5	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Kilt jackets - are Montrose and Sherrifmuir jackets always worn with Jabot collars?	I'm planning to wear a traditional Scottish outfit for my wedding.  The more formal, the better.  I really like the look of Montrose and Sherrifmuir jackets, but I'm not big on the poofy Jabot collar shirts.  Is it considered improper to wear these jackets with any other type of dress shirt?  Instead of the Jabot collar, will either of these jackets work with a shirt and tie or shirt and ascot?  Also, if you know where I can find pictures of these jackets being worn with something other than a Jabot collar shirt, I would love to see that.  Thanks!

I use an electric razor, and all is good, but about 8 hours after the shave, I get a good amount of tiny zits. Its not razorburn, they are actually very small zits that look like they are ready to pop.

20090203083414AAW85lz	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	How come my nose piercing keeps getting infected ?	I have had my nose pierced since, sometime in June, of 2008.   i was cleaning it for the six, weeks, and nothing went wrong , no infections or pain.   I knew 3 other girls, you got it pierced before me, they said it feel out, and really hurt to put back in, my feel out, and it did hurt to put back in at all ..   So now lately , started around october, it would randomly get infected, and bleed. It would also be painful to take it out, and put it back in.   someone told me i am supposed to take it out and clean it ever day, but it hurts my nose to much.   would it be better if i took it out and got it re-pierced ?
