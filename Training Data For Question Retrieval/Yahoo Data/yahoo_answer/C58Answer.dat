fdd66a0264611ab1286c9261b903a931aa	The States rights over the federal government is what the founders of our nation had in mind.  Over the years, the federal government stole power away from the states.  Even if it resulted in what most would consider to be a good thing, it was done illegally as the constitution does not give that power to the federal government.<br>  The constitution only gives limited power to the federal government.  For this to change, an amendment to the constitution is necessary.  In the majority of cases however, either over zealous judges or congress ignore the basic governing laws for the "greater good" and dictate law to the states.  Although sometimes this can be a good thing (in the case of certain civil liberties), it was done inappropriately and is thus, unconstitutional.  There is a proper way to do things and an improper way.  Sadly, many of our citizens, judges, and politicians choose to overlook the laws of this country to do whatever they "feel" is in our best interest.  Jefferson is rolling in his grave...|`|DB9QbZoQaa	Yes!|`|Q7ovix19aa	That makes you an anti-Federalist.  They were the people among the nations founders who opposed the "federalizing" of the United States so each state would no longer be autonomous.  They opposed the Federalist Party drive for a tighter federal authority.<br>  <br>  The anti-Federalists demanded our Bill of Rights be included with the new constitution (today's) the Federalists pushed.  The Bill of Rights has a provision that the then-new formal militias would be dedicated first to defending their states against federal domination.  It also declares that the people will keep military arms to help that effort, or to fight against the formal militia if that is called to abuse us.<br>  <br>  None of that matters much anymore anyway.  Citizens are now lazy cowards and they wouldn't risk anything, let alone their lives, to keep their states, or even themselves free.|`|e68ed70654e71ea7f425cc92736a0d51aa	You mean "Live under Constitutional Law"  That would be marvelous.  <br>  <br>  As I stated before, I would much rather give the state the bulk of my taxes, the are easier to hold accountable than the Feds.|`|axHyoVqGaa	Without a doubt.  Our federal government was never to have this much power.|`|9cbd33d2161007ec93c0593d77c8434faa	Yes although here in Wisconsin we have an idiot  as Governor|`|3lur9XHOaa	At least we could go to another state if it goes bad in our current one.

VpXrsxGGaa	if its free then no|`|RFlZ4bBnaa	well i get it from lime wire<br>  <br>  LimeWire says it is legal because technically it's just a "file sharing" service and it is not held responsible for the files that are downloaded onto the system. Only the users are responsible. That's why, when you download songs from LimeWire, it's legal for them, but NOT for you. <br>  <br>  Don't be fooled by the fee you pay to use the PRO version of LimeWire. The artists of the songs you download don't get a penny of that! ("LimeWire offers two versions of the software: LimeWire Basic which is free of charge; the other is LimeWire PRO which costs a small fee, features faster download speeds and better search results, including up to 6 months of free updates and customer support via email.") <br>  <br>  Even if you download a coyrighted song for your own personal use, it's still illegal. Perhaps one could skate around the issue if they already own a legal copy on a CD, but then why download it if that's the case. Any fees paid to LimeWire are for purchasing the software and that's it. <br>  <br>  LimeWire is not illegal software. All it is is file sharing. However, many people abuse this by sharing songs without the copyright. For example, if you have produced a song and then share it on LimeWire, anyone else can legally have it for free. But when you haven't made it, but an artist has, who has copyright on that song (which they all do) downloading that song without permission from the producer is totally illegal. <br>  <br>  Downloading songs and other copyrighted material is illegal, but if you wanted to share a music file of you singing or playing an instrument, then that is perfectly legal. <br>  <br>  LIMEWIRE IS ILLEGAL! Although, with LimeWire, you will probably never get caught, if you as much as bring your computer in for a repair and a worker sees the program or any music you downloaded from LimeWire, he is ordered BY LAW to tell his boss, and you will get a fine (I had to pay approximately $200.) It's not pretty. Although we all want LimeWire to be legal, it isn't. <br>  <br>  The LimeWire software itself is not illegal -- that is why the site is still up and why you can still download it. However, if you download a song from the program and you do not pay copyright on it, that is illegal. Songs from the 1950's (or before that date) are legal to download because their copyright has expired. Anything from after that is illegal to download. However... You are all going to do it anyway, so this is just to make you aware of the legal situation! <br>  <br>  Is LimeWire illegal? No, it is not. It CAN'T legally be held accountable for what its users do. Let's put it like this: A major virus takes out the whole of the Internet. But when they trace the source, it leads to Runescape servers, for example. Runescape is an online game that gives its users access to its servers, kind of like LimeWire. Now are the people who own Runescape responsible? Nope, but its users ARE. Same thing with LimeWire. My advice to you is this: Do not use it to access "free" music, or "free" programs... images... and so on and so forth. I have had my fair share of songs I got from LimeWire. And if I could, I would return them to the artists and companies that worked hard to make them. <br>  <br>  Here is some info regarding P2P software and file-sharing. If only people would just take the time to read the fine print. I've visited the websites of a few popular file-sharing software distributors and looked for disclaimers, TOS, End User Licenses, etc. I have only quoted bits of relevant information to give you an idea of what to expect. For more detailed info, follow the links I've provided or visit the sites yourself for the full text. Continue reading to see what I found. <br>  <br>  LimeWire itself is legal. Downloading any copyrighted song that you do not pay a royalty fee on is illegal and is stealing, unless the artist has given his/her permission to do so. The legality of most P2P sites is questionable, at best. Will you be prosecuted? More than likely not, but the question of legality is another matter. This entire issue has not been resolved as of yet. Could you be prosecuted? Possibly. It is your choice. <br>  <br>  It's been said again and again. Yes, LimeWire is legal. But not everything you choose to do with it is.|`|s1tfLnDXaa	Even if it is, you will never get caught. Ever. The only people that get caught are the ones with like 100,000 songs on their computer.

TYGgRjqDaa	I can't tell you because I agree with it and don't find it immoral in any way.  A person should have the right to die.|`|1469145fbc54553729532a83a0ba1985aa	Because it's not natural. It's ending someone's life, even if it was going to end anyway.|`|GgEr3geeaa	That is true. I don't believe suicide is immoral either.|`|944e2748d03e1efff042dce931e63f28aa	dying|`|f1006988bdbdd7ae5e5276623f046308aa	Because the Bible says so. God will take you when he feels the time is right or you mess up Gods plan. That is also 1 reason why suicide, assisted or not,is illegal, and or, considered immoral.<br>  I am not saying I believe any of this, but it is a answer to your question in Christian America.<br>  Also the rules can get very complicated to between what is assisted suicide and what is murder.<br>  Like what if some one kills you, even fakes a suicide note, then claims he did not kill you , he just assisted in your suicide?|`|YCL50xgnaa	Some people think it is immoral because they want their God to decide when it is time, despite that fact that it is man keeping them alive on machines.  I, for one, want and plan to have a say in when I go and don't want someone else to decide I can't because of their personal beliefs.  If they don't want assisted suicide, then they don't have to do it.  In states where assisted suicide is legal, like Washington state and Oregon, there are strict guidelines/laws on how it is to be done.  It's all very humane.<br>  <br>  Jason F, that's factually incorrect.|`|6YbxTlDCaa	to Fazizzle, it may not be natural, but neither is living well beyond our natural life spans as modern medicine has allowed us to.<br>  I think it is just another form of control. perhaps the medical field would lose a lot of money by not having all the extreme cases to prolong and bill the insurance companies. In turn this drives up the cost of insurance, and they want the cash too. Just think, this could possibly lower the cost of health insurance! But NO! this would be a bad thing! right? <br>  You can be sure that there's a financial connection to it and you know who that points to.<br>  I believe if a person falls within a certain criteria they should be allowed to go if they choose. Some ****** called it liberal but I call it freedom vs control...FREEDOM TO CHOOSE!|`|PefglUNaaa	being born is a gift. its like getting a bad gift from someone you love. you dont just stomp on it in front of them. you make the best of it. and it husrts your loved ones.|`|2VsmOU7zaa	Technically suicide is illegal, so therefore assisted suicide is illegal as well.|`|LiGWTLpSaa	Try cutting off your food and water in order to slowly starve to death over a period of nine days (like with Terri Schiavo).<br>  <br>  I guarantee you'll have a much different opinion.|`|vhy0k2dtaa	No. That's God choice, not ours.|`|00390bee0bdfb56e0334bd2845fadd9aaa	that IS the ?<br>  isn't it????????|`|noTfs29oaa	Life is precious. Who says the person isn't going to get better. Doctors say that all the time, and people surprise them. You are taking away the person's chances or possibility of getting better and getting to finish living their life. Even if they don't get better they could still live for a long time. <br>  Ex: HIV patients ae dying, but they can live for a long time, and who says a cure won't be found before they die? You don't know what may happen, and you are taking away their chances ad their life, which is also murder.|`|LOfZNNdfaa	If you gave me a gun and told me to shoot you in the head I wouldn't do it, I couldn't do it.  Even though you want to die I don't want to be any part of it.  For one it goes against what I stand for and I couldn't bare to watch someone take their own life.  If someone has lost their will to live then they need help, they don't need a pill that will kill them.  I believe you should live out your life because you never know whats going to happen next.  Things could turn around and even if they don't it was still worth a shot. You only got one life, you should live it out till the end.|`|2EHDf6BEaa	Killing yourself if like killing someone else. It is an act of murder upon yourself. Don't we have the choice of killing somebody? Yes, we do. But that is not a right chose. There are bad choices in life that we as humans have to overcome.|`|YdwwHv8haa	People say that being born is a gift and so is living. But sometimes, when people are going to die anyway, living can become a curse, and death the cure.|`|2vidb5ZAaa	Well, if you kill yourself <br>  its MURDER|`|i2qQrXgiaa	because the stupid idiots who make a big deal about **** like this are really just jealous cause theyd love to have an assisted suicide. i mean who doesnt want to die to die when we live in this hell|`|VpXrsxGGaa	beacuse atleast 99 percent of the people who want to have assisted suicide done are not in a mental state that they can make that decision|`|3x1tJRmOaa	..........|`|OeQY9SXKaa	It sounds like you are an extremely liberal person.  Silly, silly liberal...|`|lQR9fYGhaa	its illegal|`|65lTdKNgaa	because life is a gift ans death is never the answer|`|PCVJg5ieaa	By this logic I could shoot someone and then claim that he was dying anyway so I was just assisting.  Or just go to the cancer ward at the hospital and open fire, because the people are dying anyway.  <br>  <br>  People have the choice about whether to live or die...people do not have the right to assist in that choice.  And that seems right to me deep down.|`|KZh3x4g9aa	revisit this question when you are 82 and feeling not too well. you should also ask your mom and dad.
EuGsGfuJaa	That type of knife called an "assisted opening" knife.  They exploit a loophole in switchblade law because, simply put, they don't have a "switch" located in the handle.  They are legal as of this writing in Texas as long as the blade us less than 5.5 inches long.<br>  <br>  In the interest of disclosure, there is currently a lawsuit that was just filed trying to make these knives illegal in Texas.

9XJLlPaEaa	They are two separate actions.<br>  <br>  You can file a continuance, and you can most likely get one, but just so you know civil and criminal cases are never intertwined, meaning the result of one does not, in the eyes of the law have an affect on the other.|`|fgIbNRHfaa	Generally, you can file motions to continue.  You can ask to continue a hearing or a court date or a trial.  However, you usually cannot file a motion to continue an appeal.  Appeal deadlines are very strict.  You usually have to file a "notice of appeal" within a certain time frame, then file the briefs on a date set by the Court.  You may be able to continue the filing of the brief, but generally not the filing of the notice of appeal.  However, criminal law is a creature of state law, so it depends on the rules of your state.  You need to check with the criminal clerk of court before the deadline to ask about the possibility of filing a motion to continue.  However, remember that ASKING for a continuance does not upset any filing deadlines.  The judge has to actually GRANT the continuance.  So good luck, and hurry!

Small claims court judges do not have to deal with attorneys.  they can dispense with formalities.  And they will hammer you for filing a case with no merit.<br>  <br>   However, they are also scrupulously fair because they are not dealing with attorneys.  As to what constitutes proof? that is for the judge to decide.|`|D1i4zdpgaa	The answer is more complex than the question.<br>  <br>  The reason is that the jurisdictional and legal authority of a small claims court varies from state to state.<br>  <br>  Usually, a small claims court is limited in the amount of damages it can reward, and sometimes the types of cases it can hear. <br>  <br>  Most small claims courts are based on a "preponderance of the evidence", versus strict legal procedures. This means that they tend to act as an arbitrator, hearing both sides of the story, and trying to find a compromise. However, this isn't always the case; again, this depends on the state you live in.|`|Ut2ouMRKaa	You need some kind of proof  or you need to get the other person to admit it to the judge|`|a03a43bb5a9fa8406b5e2c0effe464beaa	no|`|oFcrglxzaa	yes if you get a judge that's just as ridicules as the claimant

He took this country from a creditor nation to a debtor nation, increased the scope of government and started the whole problem of federal deficits which took Clinton 8 years to fix until Bush screwed that up.|`|AA11042510	Obama haas copied Reagan and Lincoln in his recent speeches.

It restricts the Government and says those rights can not be taken away from the people. <br>  Our founders recognized the need for government but set our government up to be one where no one individual or group could become powerful enough to become tyrants. They understood the fact that power corrupts. <br>  Since money is power, the sudden grab for such huge sums of money at the expense of your children and grand children will most certainly create a group of elitist tyrants (Lords) and future generations will serve as slavish serfs to satisfy their whims. <br>  Their actions are unconstitutional, are in violation of their Oaths of Office, and they deserve to be impeached.|`|O1jigUYSaa	I surely do...with all my heart I do.

Almost every single problem we have in this country is because of the government. A conservative recognizes this and says that government needs to be reduced.

Bush was in office.<br>  <br>  Bush junior was a fiscal liberal and doubled the federal defecit to 2.1 trillion dollars...and left office with a 530 billion dollar budget defecit....Since taking office two months ago Obama has tripled the budget defecit and has added another trillion to our Federal defecit...<br>  <br>  That is the problem that conservatived have with Obama...as much as people like to clown on Clinton he was a responsible spender...his tax policy caused America to grow rather sluggishly...but he inherited a robust economy to do it in...Obama has inherited a crisis economy and he is implemting the same tax policy that slowed down a robust economy and ended up sending it into a recession in 2001...Now if that tax policy cause a robust economy to go into recession....what does the same tax policy do to a crisis economy.<br>  <br>  You can't take 1.5 trillion dollars out of the private sector and say it is going to be a good thing.....Obama is making a terrible mistake under the guise of fairness...he doesn't have the same room to work with that Clinton did...and he doesn't have the same fiscal discipline that Clinton had...<br>  <br>  He has tripled our budget defecit and added another 33% to our federal defecit in two months...and he has another 4 trillion on the table....and he plans on paying for it with the CAPITAL from the private sector that could be the only money that will revive the economy.<br>  <br>  The government will not solve this recession....they will take credit for it when it gets better...but the market has to correct....Obama draining the trillions that is out of the private sector to channel through Washinton is going to be a terribly crippling act on this economy.<br>  <br>  If robust consumption is the key to moving out of recession...and the government precedes to take 20% of the gross domestic product out of the private sector....that doesn't go into consumption....how is that going to fix anything?<br>  <br>  Lower ALL taxes....Spend Less in Washington....Let the Market Correct....|`|v0PY0UDAaa	Whether or not there was an actual surplus, the 90s were the most fiscally conservative government we had since JFK.

Hence why you have Blue Dog Democrats!  Conservatism is still very much alive in this country because you haven't won ANY points on liberal ideals....just got the Democrats in.

I see people making fun of Rush  but come on. True he didn't go to High School but.. Look how successful he became. He was addicted to drugs but he went to therapy and got straightened around now he is back bigger than ever. Why isn't that considered a success story.   <br>  Like Chi Guy and others make fun of him but that's because they could not hope to even come close to debating him in the arena of ideas. So they throw insults. Listen to his speech. Rush has it on his website along with the transcripts. Its about Life Liberty , Pursuit of Happiness. How could you disagree with that?|`|Tgk7Fh1Jaa	They are afraid of what people would be talking about if they were not talking about Rush.<br>  <br>  This is a diversion from Obama's massive spending plans that will destroy the country.

We need to make Obama a TV show lampooning him daily and have all the news and shows lying about him and running him down constantly.

He has the potential to shape the hearts and minds of millions.  Not to mention Rush and Hannity are critics of Obama.  Both have been attacked by the Obamania media/administration.

Maybe you don't care for him, that is up to you, but the White House is making a talk radio person into an issue when the retirements of everyone have dropped about 50% since the Inauguration.  Meanwhile, the Congress has spent almost as money as the country has ever spent and people are losing their jobs everywhere and it's only getting worse.  Who cares what Rush says? Is Obama so vain that he only acts when he feels insulted? <br>  <br>  The gist of the story you linked to is that the president's top advisors are using an unusual amount of time to vilify a radio entertainer and doing nothing to stop the business community from crashing and burning.  I find this situation very scary with an administration that does nothing but get offended by offensive people on the radio.|`|dLVoWjwOaa	He's an idiot who likes to hear himself talk.

He's greeted by Saint Peter at the gates. Saint Peter says, "Welcome, Mr. King, it's great to have you here. I want to show you around, give you an idea of what's here, maybe you can pick a place that you'd like to reside." King says, "I just have one question: Is Rush Limbaugh here?" "No, he's got a lot of time yet, Mr. King." So Saint Peter begins the tour. Larry King sees the various places and it's beyond anything we can imagine in terms of beauty. Finally, he gets to the biggest room of all, with this giant throne. And over the throne is a flashing beautiful angelic neon sign that says "Rush Limbaugh." <br>  <br>  And Larry King looks at Saint Peter and says: "I thought you said he wasn't here." <br>  <br>  "Saint Peter says, he's not, he's not. This is God's room. He just thinks he's Rush Limbaugh."|`|AA10757358	Rush Limbaugh is a very welcome Conservative.  One thing you can say about him is that he is honest and is not afraid to Speak the truth. We need more people like him instead of those that do not know how to speak the truth.  What is wrong with being fat and has anyone told you how perfect you are lately (sorry I don't remember the name of the icon that called him fat like it a was a sin).  So the man enjoys eating what do you enjoy doing besides making fun of others?  None of us have a talk show and is know around the world  Rush L. does and is know.  Don't be criticizing someone that works everyday and is heard from coast to coast.   He may be fat and ugly but he is honest and talks straight.  I had rather have someone like him having a talk show than someone who is swave and  the truth is not in him.  I have never heard him compare himself to God.  I am not saying that he did not mention God in some way I just never heard it and this is time I have even read anything about it. Do I have my neck in the sand?  If he said it he didn't;t mean it.  Have you ever said anything that you wish you could take back?  I know I have so I don't judge others for making a comment that I know they didn't mean in the way others might have conceived it.  Yes I am defending Rush Limbaugh because he is getting some bad comments that he does not deserve.<br>  <br>  Edit:  I'm sorry I didn't mean that you called Rush Fat and ugly it was I believe "Ventage" the second or third person that answered your question.|`|aVEVchFxaa	C'mon now.

jRtQTN24aa	Simple really. The government forced several banks to take money the<br>  bank said they didn't need. This gave the government a say in how the bank was run. It's the "strings attached" thing. When a given company<br>  accepts the government money, the government assumes "part ownership of that company. When the government "assumes" control of enough of the free market businesses, it gives government the means to control the creation of wealth, and there by the distribution<br>  of wealth. <br>  This is old Soviet style Socialism on the march.|`|1219d6000cca01c9f3c4489d1c7b4a16aa	They don't really, this is what happens: they get money for those companies, and then those companies donate to the political campaigns of the politicians that got that money for them.  It's a great way for them to scratch each other's back and ensure that both entities stick around.|`|FCY3lwnoaa	So that, like the Communists they aspire to be, the government will own everything.|`|wEOJyEw0aa	Because its the Republican thing to do|`|nlwJlHpdaa	You mean the companies that are going bankrupt and tanking the economy?  If those companies shut down, the country goes into a depression.  It's a very serious situation with no easy answers, although I do agree that giving companies any money from the government is a bad thing....you have to consider the current situation.  Would it be worse to just let the companies close down and see what happens?  Basically we are in a bad situation and some tough decisions are going to be made.  Those decisions don't involve any good choices.  It isn't possible to turn around an economic recession by just wishing really hard...it takes money and better government policies.|`|Oj5oZYJ4aa	I find it amusing that people talk about these big companies going under if they don't get stimulus money but then why in the world is Obama taxing them? maybe if you lowered their taxes they wouldn't need so much stimulus money? <br>  <br>  To answer the question it's all about paybacks.|`|2C4AnP8yaa	Who knows.

Beyond that, when you went to the hospital, the hospital should have notified the police or animal control that you were bitten by a dog and an investigation should have taken place which would determine if the dog is violent enough to be put down.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, the dog's owner has strict liability on the dog and MUST recompense you for your medical bills.<br>  <br>  You can also sue his for civil assault and battery, because you saw the dog coming and feared for your safety.<br>  <br>  Contact the police and file a complaint if one hasn't already been made and then contact a lawyer.

Obama has done nothing but make mistakes since he took over so hello pot, meet the kettle.|`|0ff2304aa58946a2151ca64e5d9e7cd9aa	Not dumb at all if you look honestly back at what caused our current economic problems.  As far back as the Clinton administration (and supported by that administration) there were warnings and a push to have more regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac, overmatched by a push to leave them unregulated by praising them for putting low income families into homes as if that was the be-all and end-all.  Nobody ever considered whether people could actually pay off these mortgages, but they artificially drove up home values.  These shaky mortgages were bundled and sold on the market as safe investments on the basis that they were "insured" by the federal government.  Opposition to this way of doing business and warnings about the potential harm to the economy go back over ten years.  Obama is not facing this problem.  He simply wants to get by it so things can return to business as usual.  But that can't be done without having the same problems smack us in the face once again, unless the socialist unregulated way things have been done are changed.<br>  <br>  The real problem that Obama supporters aren't willing to face is that HE IS BUSINESS AS USUAL!!!  So, no problems get solved.<br>  <br>  This problem was not created by Fox, not by Republicans, and certainly not by the Bush administration (since the warnings were years old when he took office, and he tried to get these agencies regulated).  You can go and blame liberal Democrats for an unrealistic push to put minorities into homeownership, whether they could afford it or not.|`|f283615ebe5370643054773229eb05d5aa	If we want to "contribute our efforts into fixing damages made to this country" we need to remove a hell of a lot of the Dems in Congress who created this economical disaster!

Anyone who disagrees can look up the definition of slander and look up the penalties.  People are free to argue and say whatever they want about Obama, as long as they aren't intentionally lying. <br>  <br>  Of course, to bring every case of lies against Obama up in court would not be possible.

It is a false notion that Bush somehow ruined the country and the mighty Obama who wants to "change" everything, will fix it by taxing spending and reinventing via his socialist agenda.

Also, since America is in need of military personnel, I'm sure that they would put you on a program or make you come back in the next couple of months. Just go to your nearest recruiting station and ask someone there.|`|rpGgwg2Iaa	Depends on the branch.  I know with the Army you can have your recruiter conduct a height, weight and tape test to see if you are considered over weight to our standards.  They have pretty lack standards, and as long as you pass the tape test, and the physical fitness test you can come in.  And pretty much once you're in it's hard not to get in shape.<br>  <br>  But as for while you're in, you have access to a nutrition specialist and of course free gyms.|`|wuR48sKsaa	Many times the recruiter will weigh you and keep telling you to come back when you meet the weight requirements.

UvzKiis0aa	Highly processed, high fat food is the cheapest and easiest to prepare.  A bag of Cheetos is cheaper than a bag of carrots or a bunch of grapes.  Poor people eat what they can afford and have time to make.<br>  <br>  Governor Patterson is attempting a sin tax like the ones against alcohol and tobacco which tries to slow down its use by making it more expensive.  In this case, I agree that it is a stupid way to curb obesity.  Food companies need to cut out the high fructose corn syrup, salt, fat, and other poisons they put in food to increase their profit margins and make food more healthy.|`|YDlfu6AUaa	For one reason cheap food is not healthy food it is riddled with fat and preservatives and artificial flavorings and colors and ingredients you can't even pronounce.<br>  The poor cannot afford to eat healthy and that is one reason why they gain so much weight.<br>  Fruits and fresh vegetables alone are extremely expensive when your on a tight budget so those items are considered a luxury because it's a rare occasion when they can sink their teeth into something nourishing instead of a bag of potato chips or something from McDonald's.<br>  Also, in impoverished area's there's usually high crime so people cannot hang out at the parks and play or run around and walking around even during the daytime isn't safe so they stay home and watch TV or play video games.<br>  They also cannot afford to join a gym or go anywhere because everything costs money you just don't realize it until your broke and living from paycheck to paycheck.<br>  <br>  I used to be one of those who couldn't understand the plight of the poor until I became poor myself and now I understand, I sympathize with them.<br>  <br>  It's because of 'usury' that allot of people are poor and maybe why God despises usury as much as he does.<br>  All throughout the Holy Bible God speaks about usury and what he does to people who take advantage of people in this way.<br>  Like the credt card company's etc. all of them create poverty while they themselves remain rich.<br>  One day they will ask for a drop of water to quench their thirst as they're roasting in the fires of hell and Jesus will remind them of what they did to us.<br>  <br>  But that's why so many poor people are overweight.|`|iPZWtRYkaa	They are not eating well. They are actually malnourished. The cost of calorie dense food is lower than foods with relatively little calories but high in essential mineral and vitamin content.

So in poverty stricken neighborhoods, family's spend money on calories dense foods like Mac&Cheese, Spam, Etc. rather on more expensive fruits and vegetables that are essential to a healthy diet. The kids may be fat but they are malnourished.

otYOxmnuaa	The bill is supposed to be "stimulus" of which it's not.  <br>  <br>  It's about 2/3 pork counting the tax-credits and 1/3 direct stimulus.  The pork includes an orgy of Democratic program expansion and paybacks for their constituency (the tax-credits being one such "bribe" -- I mean piece of pork)<br>  <br>  Understand the difference b/n tax-cuts and tax-credits is actually paying the tax first.  A tax-cut implies you paid -- a tax-credit doesn't (read: redistribution of wealth)<br>  <br>  It was supposed to help jump start the economy and instead came out looking like a Democrats wet dream....spend spend spend.<br>  <br>  The Republicans offered their own plan which included help for business, keeping Bush tax-cuts, etc. etc.. and when they ran it through Obama's economic model, it actually returned twice the number of jobs at half the cost.<br>  <br>  The Dems shot it down.  The true nature of the bill is to expand the size,scope and power of government. <br>  <br>  The CBO (Congressional Budget Office) analyzed Obama's plan and decided it did more harm in the long run than any good in the short run.  He pushed through on "hope".<br>  <br>  I think that's the gist.  You can check the CBO report and charts:<br>  <br>  www.cbo.gov.<br>  <br>  This site is fun too -- has a spreadsheet of all of the spending (not stimulus), the CBO reports/charts and some other stuff:<br>  www.readthestimulus.com<br>  <br>  The bottom line is Obama and his Administration are being reckless in a time when we can't afford to experiment.  The Housing Bill they just passed was also analyzed by the CBO.  They stated that even with the bill, 50+% of people receiving some money will still default on their mortgages (even if rates were renegotiated to 2%...which won't happen).  They jammed it through Congress on "hope".<br>  <br>  You can't ignore your analyst in favor of "hope" and "change".  This is going to get expensive.  <br>  <br>  As a side note:<br>  -Cap and Trade hurts business (Just passed this legislation)<br>  -Farm Subsidies keep American farmers competitive (Just removed them)<br>  <br>  Prices will go up on consumer-goods (cap/trade) and food (subsidies).  <br>  <br>  That ultimately hurts the lower classes.  Seems counter-intuitive, don't it?<br>  <br>  Good luck w/ your paper.

a8e1KcS2aa	Some agencies have a cadet program or a citizen's police academy.  Also, as a college student you can do an internship at a local department.  You can also contact the brass at the department (if it's a smaller department) or a desk sergeant and ask if you can get involved in a ride-along program.  Mind you, most of these programs are for 18+ years old because of the liabilities involved, but some departments allow ride-alongs with a parental waiver, so you'd have to have your parents in tow.<br>  <br>  I actually used to be a police explorer though, and often help out with our local post.  It's quite beneficial and you make a lot of contacts that will help you out later on in life.  I'd suggest becoming involved in that program if you hadn't already.|`|1waI9ygVaa	unfortunately explorers suck these days. in the early 90's I was in explorers. you could get out on traffic stops on ur ride alongs and everything...now days u just sit in the car like a chump
JIwbiE8kaa	The Army will treat him and you like family.  If he has medical issues that the Army can help with, they will.  If not, they will authorize you to see a medical professional off post.  As for the baby, you can have a baby at the expense of the Army...as long as you are in the Army when it is born.  You will have medical and dental care provided by the Army, or nearest military installation.  The Army does not say how many you can have, one is fine.  10...if you are him are up to it is an option as well.

He'll have insurance through you to be seen by the MTF (military treatment facility) or possibly other doctor who takes your insurance.

But I'm not sure how pleasant that will be for a man who's using hearing loss as a reason he can't or won't support a family.  Sorry, I have friends and family with hearing loss varying from severe to total and lifelong that still manage to hold jobs and be productive members of society.|`|AA10709853	the military doesn't care that he's deaf.   as for having kids.. well frankly you need to time that.   no getting pregnant when you KNOW your unit is about to deploy.. because you can get into a lot of trouble for doing so.|`|K8qAniReaa	Your husband will be treated like any other dependent.  He will have access to the same medical and dental benefits.  You will get the same BAH as anyone else.  Same benefits for the baby. You could get knocked up immediately after basic training if you want to.  I wouldn't recommend it though because of AIT (where you learn your MOS).  The military does not dictate when women get knocked up except in combat zones.<br>  <br>  You will certainly be able to provide for your family if you join the Army.|`|5ItOGyVHaa	the military doesn't recognize a boyfriend of fiance. only husbands and wives. so once you get married your husband will be like any other military spouse. free medical and may even get that special sign outside your house. <br>  <br>  now as far as kids. you can have kids in the army. however the  military is full of deployments so be prepared to leave that child with your husband for a year.|`|n2oEhdZiaa	After you get done with AIT and you and your husband move to your permanent duty station, you should talk to your unit about having kids.  If they have a deployment coming up, they will probably want you to go on that rather than get pregnant.  I don't think there is a minimum wait, but if you start popping out babies with deploying, you're going to be regarding as one of "those girls" and that will be detrimental to your career.  Knock out a deployment and then make a baby, in my opinion.|`|6c02d02bf857232422a679628b4b9402aa	visit your nearest base.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://thearmywifelife.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">http://thearmywifelife.wordpress.com/</a>

a8e1KcS2aa	Ipods help people.  They help me keep my sanity.  Honestly, if you're scared for your life, go out, get a concealed carry permit, take the necessary gun classes, obtain a handgun (I'd recommend anything made by Sig-Sauer or Heckler & Koch), and strap.  Mind you, that's a mighty big privilege and an even greater responsibility.  Also, if we had full body armor, that would greatly decrease mobility.  I'm happy with my second chance vest.  I know that if I get struck, anywhere in my torso, that's all the second chance I need, because I'm hitting center mass and then T-band.<br>  Also, again, your ideas are expensive, but my force's SWAT team has ballistic resistant helmets and what-not.

They have nearly zero mobility.

I think you are asking two different questions there was the planes hitting the buildings and then there was the buildings collapsing. IT wasn't an inside job.

F.D.R. had the responsibility and luxury of putting to work a farming class of people that went through an enormous drought that shut down the farming industry and put the back bone of this country into a tail spin.  He was a smart man that new that people (at that time) would work for a dollar and enjoy and respect what they earned.  Being the conservative republican that I am I do not agree with Obama's stimulus plan but I do know what he is trying to accomplish and can only hope that it works even though I disagree.<br>       If I opened a business, weather it be a bank or auto industry I could except the fact that it might fail.  I'm not God and it's not a perfect world.  Even in America.  I think it's a sad fact of the times that a business can grow so big that it expects or depends on the government for bail out.  Henry Ford would be appalled I'm sure.  If not roll over in his grave.  Hard working people go through this every day of the year in this country.  Forced to sell a business, close, or file for  bankruptcy.  Most move on, learn from their mistakes and open other business that thrive.<br>       So to answer your question in my opinion.  There are no similarities.  I do know that it's not a bad thing to fail if you learn from your mistakes.  Cheers mate and good question.

The ACLU has taken away many rights in the last few years of the hard working American for the sake of liberalism. May God have mercy on this nation if the democrats gain full power, and may He have mercy on us all.

Great! Send me your address and I will do my best to give it to a few good child molesters.

That is even true of most liberals-that is why certain kinds of actions and activities are illegal.<br>  <br>  Check you history hotshot-it was the Republicans that were responsible for demolishing Jim Crow laws and slavery.<br>  <br>  When you learn a little about history, economics, political sciences and just WHAT a Conservative is-then you can talk.

ALL YOU DID WAS USE SEMANTICS WHEN YOU SAID THIS:<br>  LIBERALS ARE NOT TRYING TO PRESERVE ABORTION; THEY'RE ALLOWING CHOICE.<br>  Correction:  the current law allows choice, but if it was about to be taken away, liberals would want to preserve it.  And thus they would be conservative as you described it.<br>  <br>  So if the law allows people to murder because it allows choice, then would it be a liberal law?<br>  <br>  These are issues that are important.  Conservatives view unborn children as those who have the right to a life they already have.  You liberals just arbitrarily say they don't have rights becaue they're inside somebody else's body.  That's a very cruel law and you know it.  You choose not to accept the reality of it.|`|WYPEG8l7aa	If thats what Liberals are the who are those morons that keep yelling ignorant crap and calling themselves liberals?<br>  <br>  Note the guy above me.|`|YQOT68xFaa	Way to generalize.

All that wonderful tolerance and acceptance they claim to feel was gone like yesterday when they were faced with something they didn't agree with.<br>  <br>   Liberals are closed-minded as well, they are just closed to different things. Everyone is a bigot. Everyone is intolerant of something. Everyone has a line that they will not cross.

Abraham Lincoln was instrumental in starting the Republican party. <br>  <br>  Political affiliations aside, isn't your question itself very narrow-minded?

Many qualified people are not getting jobs/college acceptances just because someone is getting accepted based on their race.<br>  <br>  -They want "social justice" in the economic system.  WHAT?<br>  I prefer Economic Freedom, thank you very much.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  By the way, Liberal does mean free.  However those were real liberals....those were CLASSIC LIBERALS!

GHPZlhAwaa	The lawyer gave a worst case scenario, he did not state that that is what WOULD happen or is most likely to happen.  <br>  <br>  What would happen would be determined by the actual facts of the case, but if a person is running at you and about to strike, then you have the right to the reasonable use of self-defense, no matter the persons age as compared to yours.  The question would be as to the reasonableness of your response.  If he is coming at you with his fist, you can't shoot him, but it is reasonable to knock him down and THEN when the situation is defused, to depart the area. <br>  <br>  Ignore Peter, at 17 you are still just a minor and it is not the persons age that needs to be judged, it is the imminent threat.  If the 15 year old comes at you with a gun, you certainly wouldn't MAN UP and "cop it on the chin"!   It is the specific threat that you are defending yourself against and the right to self-defense would be determined by, if your response to that threat was reasonable or not.<br>  <br>  If you swept the legs of an attacker, thus causing him to fall on the street, sidewalk, or driveway and he broke his nose, bloody lip or scalp, then when the parents took him to the hospital to be taken care of, the ER would inform the police of the incident and the police would come and question you.<br>  <br>  Part of the police investigation as to whether or not it was a fight, or self-defense, would be BOTH of your past history and eyewitness testimony.  If you started the fight, or if you provoked the fight, then you may not be able to claim self-defense and you would be charged with a crime.<br>  <br>  whale|`|za7rzcEeaa	It depends whether physical repercussions worry you more than jail time.

Socialism believes that investing in society is the only answer to rising humanity to its full potential. Family must not be compromise or negleted for capital interest. It also believes that industries must be socially and environmentally responsible.  Labors are reward by their boses according to earned value based on their knowledge, talents, skills, experience and quality of their work.<br>  <br>  Communism as an economic system build upon the belief that a nation as a nation benefit equally from the output of the entire nation. <br>  Regardless of the individual contribution all work for one end. And as such its people are its greatest investment and resource. All resources, buildings and property are owned by the government. It leaves little to aspire to in form monetary compensation other then social recognition.<br>  <br>  Capitalism is an economic system that is at the opposite side of communism. where communism rations the spoils to an entire nation minus expenses, investment and securities. Capitalism is control by the few and the people live and work for the purpose of labor of their bosses with little regards to family.

It could be some kid who just got out of boot camp and is very high on the Marine Corps right now.  That is my guess.  Just an immature 18 year old fresh out of boot camp.  Just loves the USMC and wants the world to know about it.  Isnt thinking about right or wrong.  Could also be a 16-17 year old who is thinking about joining and is running around plastering bumper stickers because he wants to join some day and feels a part of the military but isnt yet.  Who knows.  On behalf of the USMC, I would like to apologize to you for this act of vandalism.|`|sgEloO1Jaa	it costs tax payers to have those removed also. get some friends together and some razorblades and get to scraping. like the other poster said you can get some community service to put on your resume. let your community know its great to be patriotic practice it legally|`|AA10179458	Semper Fi|`|HVMX90Ijaa	What he said ^ ^ ^ <br>  <br>  haha<br>  <br>  stated oh so perfectly<br>  <br>  :]|`|200416208f6ad103a9e8e22b4202c849aa	Bravo and Scuba said it pretty much.<br>  <br>  But I also wanted to add that I seen other stickers around from radio shows to just random weird ones.<br>  <br>  I never fully understood it. One time I asked a young man (I judged him to be about 14. I was about 17 back then) why he was putting a radio sticker on people's cars (randomly).  His answer "It is fun!".<br>  <br>  Umm....yeah. As I said, I never understood their reasoning's. I too think it is a form of vandalism and defacing property no matter what reason it is. If someone said "Hey put it on my car" is one thing. But these situations are completely a different situation. <br>  <br>  Last year when we was stationed at Camp Pendleton, we didn't see any of this.  Now that we are stationed near a Army base (hubby works on base as the Marine's school house is located here for his MOS), we see it often of Army stickers different places.  The town here pretty much stated they have other priorities than to peal those off.  So if you are faced with that issue, do put it on your resume as community service in a respectful manner for our service men.  <br>  <br>  Not all service member's support these actions.

AA11993638	What about the bus where a woman died and was on the bus for hours? there is no control over this and a company cannot afford to decommission every bus where someone died. the only time this might happen is if the vehicle cannot be cleaned and is part of an investigation. after all seats are a lot cheaper to replace than an entire bus.|`|wg78UkxFaa	I'm sure that it would be way too costly for a company to have to retire a bus or other mode of transportation if some one were to die when they were seated in it.  Just imagine how many buses or even airplanes etc  there must be where people may have died while riding in them.  Companies would go broke doing some thing such as that.<br>  <br>  Yes it would be nice if they could do that,  but its not possible for them to replace a bus every time that happens.  It's just way too expensive!|`|bc830b1601cd7380ec1f17c83fef3a4eaa	I think that they should put it back in order. <br>  <br>  This society is too obsessive about issues. Do you honestly think that no one has died on a bus before? If the companies decommissioned every single piece of equipment that someone died on, we would effectively have no public transportation. This instance is being made a big deal because the tabloids on cable had a slow news day. Let it go. Let his family deal with it and let the rest of us move on. The more we let it bother us, the more power we give to things like this and the more influence we allow the media to have on us.|`|QQsIPlV2aa	You mean the kid lost his life while sitting in this particular seat?

lvBUl3Zdaa	I wouldn't say there's no system, but it is pretty piecemeal. ∠°)|`|QI74CxD0aa	Health care or health insurance?   There is a difference between the two.<br>  <br>  The U.S. has a very expensive health care system that takes 16 percent of our GNP, but our mortality rates and the health of our newborns are  nothing to brag about.  <br>  <br>  There is health insurance, mainly through some employers.  Government employees at levels have health insurance, paid by the taxpayers.   Consumers pay through higher prices for the health insurance given by employers in the private sector.   Many who pay taxes and higher prices to provide health insurance for others cannot afford it for themselves.|`|caadc4c6c2aeb4e1700443d888e152c1aa	If you mean there's no nationalized health care system, then you are partially correct.  We already have stop gaps through medicare, medicaid, and our mandatory treatment laws. The good news is that we don't have to wait 40 weeks to see an orthopedic specialist like they do in Canada, and don't have to wait 60 weeks to get an MRI like they do in Canada.  The funniest and saddest things is that one of the elected proponents of the Canadian socialized medicine plan contracted breast cancer and was caught secretly flying to California for treatment.  Unfortunately for the US, our Congressmen would be able to get their excellent healthcare provided by their private, government hospitals in Maryland, while the rest of us will have to start flying to Belize and the Bahamas.|`|Nejnh1Bqaa	Yes the U.S. is one of the few developed nations that doesn't have government controlled health care.  That doesn't mean that health care doesn't exist, it just means that it's under private, not government control.  Knock it if you will, but our privately controlled health care system produces more innovations and more improvements in the area of health care than any socialized medical system.|`|WDVyEpRNaa	*sigh... <br>  <br>  "just watched it on BBC news, which means it's most probably accurate" <br>  <br>  news=agenda... <br>  <br>  don't care what Chanel or network... <br>  <br>  is health care a right? no. <br>  <br>  and that's the bottom line. <br>  <br>  Complicate it all you want..if you inject a health care system into our country you are changing the rules for which we govern ourselves and what the duty of the government is. <br>  <br>  probably falling on deaf ears..but i will try none the less.. <br>  <br>  my personal belief..we need to get rid of health care as an idea all together.. <br>  <br>  it's simply middle man that need not be there. <br>  <br>  that and get rid of all the frivolous lawsuits against the medical field and prices will be affordable to the average person..no more middle men. <br>  <br>  but..it would never happen..so..that's pie in the sky. <br>  <br>  socialized health care may happen unfortunately.<br>  <br>  o ya..and as another said..we have a health care system...<br>  <br>  every country has a health care system of some kind or another...|`|7BT7XYeuaa	its an abomination and speaks volumes as to what lurks in the hearts of our people.

NO HEALTH CARE SYSTEM?<br>  <br>  Hey dude, we have the greatest health care system in the world! Over 80% of the new medications that are developed are created in the US by US companies.<br>  <br>  What YOU want is socialized medicine. But you need to realize what your are asking for. Socialized medicine is a system that develops very few, if any, new treatments for disease. Instead they let the US do it for them. <br>  <br>  Why do you think that people from all over the world come here for health care. Leaders from dozens of countries come HERE to get health care that is not available in other countries.<br>  <br>  There are places in the world where over 50% of adults over 30 are HIV+ and are unable to get any treatment. Where anywhere from 30-50% of the kids born will never reach 21 years of age.<br>  <br>  If you want to cut down out health care system, then next time you or your family get sick, try doing without our health care system!|`|97797ba9147d118ff799dabba9ac3649aa	Well, there are no developed countries with a nationalized health care system.

They are posting 70% popularity figures today.<br>  <br>  Romney was rejected by fundamentalist Christians.  He was leading the race last year, early on.  Then he made a speech about religion in which he said all the things Christians like to hear.  Immediately his numbers tanked and he was out of the race.  Nobody was really sure why this happened, but my guess is that since it was very early in the race, people didn't realize he was Mormon.  As soon as that was out in the open, his ratings crashed.  Christians see Mormonism as a -cult-!<br>  <br>  Steele is popular but the GOP today is divided into two factions and Steele represents only one. The other is represented by Rush Limbaugh.

Bush at number 1).  He raised taxes on everyone (except the top 1%) for the last 7 of his 8 years in office.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Unless you want to count George W. Bush.  Bush also did a stimulus package, totaling $500 billion; but he did it for Iraq.<br>  <br>  And while Iraq is a political nightmare, now being under the control of Iran (PM Nouri al Maliki is allied to Iran), it is a near economic powerhouse now.  Iraq's economy is producing multi-billion dollar surpluses.<br>  <br>  Obama is spending $787 billion for 300 million people; as compared to Bush's stimulus for Iraq, which totaled $500 billion for 12 million people.  And that is not including the money we paid the various tribes to stop killing our soldiers.

wl1wVZ4Haa	Russia invaded Afghanistan in Dec of 1979. And that war began Russia's own little Vietnam War. The United States in turn, began funding Afghan soldiers called the mujaheddin. Many people believe that the remnants of that group, later formed the base of the Al-Qaeda of today. Records show that the US contributed over 600 million dollars per year. Plus, the US generously supplied them with assault rifles and Stinger Missiles (surface to air antiaircraft weapon). The was all under the presidency of the top contributor of terror in the last forty years: Ronny Reagan. Now, the US is paying the price of  Reagan's contribution to radical Islam. And radical Conservatives and Neocons try to hide the facts of what happens when you fail to look down the political road.|`|WYPEG8l7aa	Who were they fighting? That should answer pretty much most of your questions.|`|TFdKrkP2aa	Ronald Reagan was one of the worst Presidents of all time. He was involved in drug trafficing using the CIA.

George W Bush is the only one who come close to being as bad as Reagan and Bush is the only convicted criminal to ever be elected President.|`|hcc8fq7jaa	You obviously weren't alive back then. You sound like you're in junior high.<br>  We supplied arms to the Afghans who were defending themselves from the Soviet Army, which invaded in 1979. The Soviets were our enemies back then, not the Afghans. The Taliban didn't come to power in Afghanistan until 1996. So, he didn't give "a bunch of money and guns to terrorists".<br>  It certainly wasn't treason. It wasn't stupid.|`|DEaIiT79aa	Why is Obama sending nearly a billion to Palestine to get forwarded to Hamas which are terrorists??   So in your attempt to bash Reagan.. you remind people that Obama is sending money to Hamas.

They were resisting the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and they were not attacking civilians but military targets. <br>  After the USSR withdrew from Afghanistan, there was a power vacuum, and that is when the Taliban came to power and when bin Laden set up in Afghanistan. Those events might have been prevented if the US had been more active in Afghanistan during the 90's, (well after Reagan's  presidency)  but we can't change the past. <br>  <br>  FYI- Obama is sending 900 million dollars to Gaza, most of which will probably be used by Hamas to support terrrorism. I think it shows poor judgement and will create problems for the US and her allies, but I would not try to label it as treason. Presidents need not be evil to be wrong.|`|SZvJVM2yaa	thats because the muslims were rippin ussr a new asshole but remember 1979 to 1989 when iran and iraq were at war usa was giving iraq weapons and then come 1990 when iraq invaded quwait usa said no no no way stop to iraq  and now this war they claimed iraq had WMD since 1990 on uhhhhhh stop one min who gave it to them its all politics my dear watson all politics politics = you build ---> when you build you need material -----> when you get material -------> you will spend money-----> when you spend money you will buy new material-------> get rid of the old one------> the cycle goes on thats why war's  bring in money in the long run|`|v0PY0UDAaa	Those Muslim terrorists in the 80s were handing the USSR their behind in the Soviet Union's own little Vietnam War in Afghanistan.

97797ba9147d118ff799dabba9ac3649aa	Well anarchism by its definition is a solitary political view....however, there are similar philosophies. The one that comes to my mind is Minarchism. Minarchist believe that the government should be as small as possible, and have no interference with markets or individuals. However, a Minarchist recognizes that there are certain necessary entities (without profit motive) that need a government to be stable....roadways and military are the main two. You should note that Anarchism is actually an incredibly American viewpoint. One could argue that the founders were in fact Minarchist/Anarchist. Not all Anarchist are spraying A's with circles around them on buildings...in fact if they are, they prob aren't anarchist but rather closet socialist who use terms like "Big Business" and don't realize that so called big business is a fundamental view of Anarchism.

nfXbqCgZaa	Because a domestic violence assault is a criminal offense, you need to talk to the police.  Crimes are handled by the district attorney, not private attorneys.  What you need to do is contact the police and make a complaint.  The police will take your information and begin an investigation.

PxsvbvETaa	dude... IM in the army as Infantry and i asked the same question.. you can on some cases... you can be a Police officer without a degree, with Infantry as your back round, it'll be easier for you to get into them jobs just as long as you as your not asking to be a paper pusher or some ****... Black water will accept some one who has just an infantry back round..|`|IBNPbOV1aa	through my personal experience ive found that with the civilian sector or even federal jobs the fact that your infantry doesnt count for much, most law enforcement and federal jobs see only that you did serve while a technical job in the service would go alot further on a resume for a technical job in the civie world. i can also tell you that with a crystal clean background, some college and 2x combat vet ive applied to all the above as well as secret service, blackwater and triple canopy and got no replies and am now after being unemployed for 6 months am not even having any luck with fast food in my hometown and wish i never picked infantry, however if your local PD is hiring that would be your best start point but it is a long proccess, best of luck to you|`|l6EO5pDDaa	for federal enforcement you NEED a degree or two. <br>  <br>  like fbi and cia require police experience, and a law or crim justice degree.|`|a7IuQoUfaa	I can't fully answer your question, but I have a little advice. Just got out of the Army from a 3.5 year contract. When you sign you will have to sign another reserve obligation that will give your total military time 8 years. The recruiters hide tons from you to keep you from asking questions or backing out, but it's not what they say, no matter how cool they might seem. After your active component you will have that reserve obligastion kick in. That means that after 30 days of being out of the military you could very-well be in Iraq with a reserve unit no matter if you just came back from Iraq..I know (but I also have medical conditions which got me out of it), but they did try to tell me that I had to go even after knowing my medical conditions which is insanly illegal. The military will lie about everything. Researching regulations helped me with a LOT of battles with my leadership. There were so many negatives, but I did take the positive from it & now have the stepping stones I need for a great future, starting with the new GI bill for college! I do know in Colorado (I don't know about other states, youd have to google it?) there is a cadet program that prior military automatically qualify for which has you work with the Sherriff's Department, Fire Station, & Police Station depending on where your needed, they provide the uniforms, great benifits & pay 100% for college in whatever field you choose. It doesn't have to be in law enforcement if you don't want. & after you done with school, they offer you a fuul-time job if youd like it or you can go your way no other obligations. Only fall-back is it pays $7.50 an hour which stinks for CO living, but its enough to pay the bills. It's good cuz there may be books & supplies the GI Bill doesn't cover that there program would cover. I was considering this program for a while, but I ended up finding another offer I took.<br>  I have 0 credited hours from the military in my time..my goal was a 2 year degree. Why, cuz my leadership refused to let me go cuz I was a wheel mechanic & they said our job was too demanding. Even during my lunch hour & after work. It was my own time, but they didn't "FEEL" I could handle it. They let their own beliefs make their choice which has made my process difficult & you'll see that your entire military career, there is no getting around it.<br>  & if you do join make sure you get a bonus no matter your education you qualify. I had a GED & was told I didn't qualify for a bonus so I believed it. While in AIT (job training) I met a guy with the excact same time on his contract with a GED & 10k. That's a big difference from 0! Then the guy did crack & got kicked out go figure. Anyway, no matter what they say DEMAND a bonus of 10k or more! & if you sign up for jump school on your original contract you get an extra 2k for a bonus, but if they try to get you after you signed your original contract don't! You get nothing extra.<br>  I'd say you have a better chance of signing up with a civilian contract company that works in Iraq. You still get good experience that relates to law enforcement, only it pay about 100k per year instead of 20k or less. I made about 30k in Iraq for 15 months..thats garbage! Your away from family, friends, & every single normal thing you know & love. I have changed into a person I don't like & am going through some tough times trying to change which makes it harder for me now. The Army is its own world even when your state-side. People talk different & act different then the real world which effects you over-time & you end up changing..no matter what anyone says it happens. Especially with you going infantry, nothing but guys. I'd go clerical if I were you. I know it sounds whooseor whatever, but your safer when in combat, you get paid the same as somebody on the front lines, & you go on few convoys only if you have to go to outpost like some finance guys did. 42Alpha I think is human resources. I think the whole 42 series is good. I went on tons of convoys cuz I was a vehicle covery specialist. ALso if you plan on getting out in 2 years Im sure they'll try to call you back with you being infantry so be careful bro. I hope this helps you some. I just don't like how recruiters suck people in & lie so I try to help when I can.<br>  Also, you will need a bachelors or higher for a job with the agencies you want to work with.|`|AA10709853	any and all of the Three Letter Agencies require a Bachelor's degree at minimum.   so use the GI Bill after you are discharged to get a degree.   although you have to serve 3 years before you are eligible.   do they even HAVE 2 year AD contracts any more?  I thought they did away with those.  <br>  <br>  BTW.. you pretty much need a degree for the Police force too.|`|NPWc3Ej7aa	They always need janitors, check it out....<br>  You want a job, but your just too lazy to prepare for it... You should go far...|`|BMkVOR0caa	Places like the FBI, Secret Service or CIA require a 4 year degree for special agent.  Yet, federal law enforcement agencies such as CIA Police, FBI Police, Capital Police, US Park Police, Amtrak Police and Secret Service Uniform Division how ever do not require a degree.  It is preferred, but not required.  You military experience will really make you stand out.  I used to work for Amtrak Police and went to the academy with FBI Police, US Mint Police, Pentagon Police, and SSUD.|`|7idyT7Obaa	only federal job along that line that you dont need a degree for is border patrol.

HJaVcUGwaa	Wikipedia gives you the answers to your questions (links below).  Basically the story goes: britain convinced the Arabs (Sherif Hussein) that if they support the British during WWI against the Ottoman Empire, then Britain will let the Arabs have their independence from the Ottomans.  That was the McMahon-Hussein Correspondence.<br>  <br>  At the same time, Britain and France were backstabbing the Arabs by making their own agreements to split the Arab region between them (Sykes-Picot Agreement), in which France got Syria and Lebanon and Britain got Palestine, Jordan and Iraq.<br>  <br>  Britain did another backstab to the Arabs by giving the Balfour declaration to the World Zionist Organization to give Palestine to the Jews for a homeland.

Ey7ocWajaa	Mira no se si es correcto o no, el problema es que todos conocemos al respecto pero no creo que hagamos mucho por evitarlo. Tu sabes la globalizacion nos conecta con todo y todos y para muestra un botón, tu estas preguntando y te contesta gente de todos lados, creo que lo importante no es que nos invadan con sus productos, el problema es que nos gustan los productos y a veces pagamos lo que sea por obtenerlos...no crees? además  el gobierno de estados unidos hace lo que quiere y  no solo en  E.U. sino lo hace en cualquier país que le de su gana., y los gobiernos correspondientes no hacen gran cosa por ser '''auto-suficientes e independientes'' en sus decisiones....en fin somos capitalistas y aunque no nos guste saberlo así  es.      (este tipo de preguntas me gusta porque me hacen pensar en cosas que pasan y a veces no nos damos cuenta de lo que repercuten en el mundo.)|`|0722d3fcb4138bb5903a3f90b49fde45aa	Si como intuyo tu eres mexicano, la invacion de productos y capitales americanos tiene relacion directa con el tratado de libre comercio para america latina (ALCA) que oportunamente tu gobierno (creo que fox) firmara con EEUU.<br>  Por este tratado se pone en "igualdad" de condiciones comerciales al paises firmante con EEUU, como si cualquier pais de latinoamerica pudiera competir en igualdad de condiciones a la economia de EEUU.<br>  Es una trampa que atenta contra la soberania de los pueblos al igual que lo fue oportunamente el famoso endeudamiento externo a que se empujo en la decada del 70, aunque por ahora no se a volteado a los gobiernos que lo han rechazado (Argentina, Brasil, Venezuela entre otros), como si se hizo en el 70.<br>  Claro que en Mexico, por su cercania territorial esto debe sentirse mucho mas.|`|01cb74f86d0e16f6bc3ab182ddae3a50aa	Es verdad todo lo que están planteando pero aveces la calidad de los productos importados son superiores a los nacionales lamentablemente es un realidad y los costos muchas veces son menores|`|213576ba9ef90513cf49f0cf1511baeeaa	no es que nos esten ivadiendo .<br>  <br>  Estados Unidos es el pais con mayor tecnologia y poder economico en el mundo <br>  en nuestro continente no contamos con la tecnologia que tienen en estados unidos y  eso nos deberia de preocupar mas que pensar en vender si no tenemos la capacidad de pensar y actuar para resolver.<br>  <br>  saludos|`|5d2c64f9d19dce846c0c91243616d9efaa	Claro que no me parece correcto, pero es que no sólo nos invaden con productos. NOS INVADEN POR COMPLETO, sea invasión económica, territorial,cultural, periodística, militar( cantidades de bases en países de América Latina, con inmunidad total de sus miembros en naciones ajenas).<br>  Lamento no poder aportar soluciones posibles, ya que el entramado de este poder se ha extendido como una red infiltrando y parasitándonos.<br>  Puedo tolerar sus espantosas hamburguesas, pero no las invasiones sólo justificadas por disponer algo enterrado que ellos necesitan.<br>  La ONU, lejos de hacer algo al respecto, es otro pseudópodo de este monstruo.|`|79a39820c3a7bd0214dbd7a8c2ca8edaaa	No es problema que nos invadan....si no que los dejamos por la desidia de no producir o confiar en la capacidad de quienes tenemos proximos.<br>  En EU un plan de servicio de telefono celular es de 40 dls llamadas ILIMITADAS larga distancia nacional incluida...Cuanto pagan alla?

Por qué no?<br>  Creo que no debemos tener una actitud derrotista y aceptar el mundo en el que estamos incertos. Mejor aprender de todos esos productos y tecnologías que llegan, y mejorarlas.<br>  <br>  El capitalismo está hecho para crear competencia, y aunque a muchos les duela, es muy democrático pues nadie tiene garantizado ningún poder a laro plazo. Digamos porción de mercado.<br>  <br>  Se debe estar innovando constantemente y en eso ganan los trabajadores, y el consumidor.<br>  <br>  Si no somos buenos en productos industriales, entonces buscamos segmentos en los que lo seamos mientras aprendemos o compramos esa tecnología.<br>  <br>  Estas usando Yahoo, internet, si esos productos gringos, como le dices , no llegaran libremente a ti no podrías dar estos pensamientos.<br>  <br>  Lo bueno del capitalismo es que el único que muere es el ineficiente y el mediocre.

Posibles soluciones por ejemplo que todos nos resistieramos a comprar sus productos, pero no lo veo realizable.|`|b600f6fb43984ec6c109e94e2436ce7faa	Que ellos traten de vendernos no sólo sus productos sino su cultura (quieras o no quieras)... pues olé por ellos. <br>  Lo que no me parece bien es que nosotros nos dejemos. <br>  ?Soluciones reales? La primera hacer zaping cada vez que pongan una película yanki (especialmente si se trata de una cadena estatal o autonómica, que es el colmo que nuestros impuestos sirvan para subvencionar las películas infumables con las que nos obsequian, especialmente los domingos). <br>  Y la segunda no comprar productos yankis, entre otras cosas porque muchas de esas grandes multinacionales tienen unos métodos empresariales que entran de lleno dentro de la delincuencia internacional (emplear a ni?os, apoyar dictaduras, etc.). <br>  No es muy difícil.... lo difícil es que la gente ponga el interés general por encima la satisfacción momentánea de sus caprichos (por usar unas determinadas zapatillas de deporte, estar a la última en filmografía o beber caca-cola).
AA10138269	Yes, because he is showing some transparency by having daily briefing with the media thru his white house sec. He wants to be open to all who wants to work with him in this bad economic crisis. I believe he's doing his best and he's only human if he makes mistakes but for some reason I doubt that he trying to make any that's why he has his opposition with him for example hillary clinton and Joe biden. he is family oriented which is wonderful because it keeps him grounded. He is for all americans not just some.|`|be5d02d1dc7db03c5839affa5d0d722faa	yes I do<br>  <br>  but if need others opinion on the why and why nots this sure is NOT the place to ask<br>  <br>  lol<br>  <br>  I followed him from the start and what I like about him is his consistent and forward looking stance of things, he is well read,watches people, with a smile, studies and thinks before he acts. is a planner and knows what he wants, he listens is very down to earth and easy going, yet would not cross the man because he is leader who will use the velvet glove treatment...encased in fist of steel<br>  and would not hesitate to smash our enemies should they decide to harm his country and people<br>  <br>  Strong silent, well spoken...teleprompter champ...but in this case writes his own speeches....family man and loving father with deep convictions<br>  <br>  that is why I like him , support him and stand behind him as we go through this crisis and glad he is the leader|`|eFXD3Qzcaa	No because of all this excessive spending!!!|`|SkOALXv9aa	I truly tried to give him the benefit of the doubt and support him as our elected president.

Follow political news and decide for yourself.  Everyday the AP or Associated Press has updates on the recession.  I read at least 3 or more articles of political news from my laptop.  Yahoo "Buzz up" is an interesting place to blog about politics.  The bottom line?  Don't take anybody's word for it.  Read for yourself and "you" decide from there.|`|IzHfbWtiaa	I don't dislike him, but most of what he is trying to do, I dislike very much! There are many Democrats who are not especially pleased with what Obama is trying to accomplish either! With that being said,I also believe that we should all pray for our leaders to make right decisions and be objective in some areas and supportive in others!|`|MsnVIjbnaa	This is really weird. I don't agree with him or trust him but I like him. I guess because it is different to have a younger president.

I'd take Ron Paul over Obama any day.|`|AA11421041	Not a big fan, but I am an open, acting and voting conservative.  I despise our democratic leaders with all my heart and soul.

I don't agree with his policies, his format, or his beliefs, or his world views. <br>  <br>  He's a product of a dysfunctional family, he's been a drug abuser, and he  without doubt holds the most Anti-American  Pro-Communist views I have seen.  He is in charge while this nation is being sold for CHANGE.|`|2C4AnP8yaa	Not really. We'll see how well he helps the economy.I personally prefer Ron Paul, even Nadar. Alot of people are ignorant to the war crimes of Israel. How does this effect us? Obama is economically tied with Israel, we send them 6.3 million a day! If and when Israel attacks Iran, you can rest assure that our troops will be sent in to fight in WW3 against Iran,Syria,China,France,Russia,etc. Its definitely a touchy topic for many but facts are facts. <br>  <br>  P.S.

"There's a report today that from 2003 to 2006, millionaire farmers received $49 million in crop subsidies even though they were earning more than the $2.5 million cutoff for such subsidies.

The farmers receive all kinds of benefits already. They get special loans that only have to be paid once a year. They get special tax breaks because they are farmers. They get special services from the local utility companies. If a farmer in my community has problem with the electrical at his barn and at the same time an elderly lady has no power at her home, the barn is the priority. They also get different rates and discounts from local shops because they are farmers. And most of these farmers are tobacco farmers. <br>  <br>  As for the susidies they receive, here is what they do. They plant a majority tobacco in their field. Then they look to see what the government is handing out subsidies for. The highest subsidized crop gets planted on the rest of the farm. At the end of the season, the sell their tobacco for big money. The crops that they planted for the subsidies get turned into the government for the money. Most don't even try to sell the legitimate crop unless there was something wrong with their tobacco that season. Then they take all of that money and go buy new Z71 pick-ups and ATV's. <br>  <br>  Also, if the tourism or other industry were to have a down year, the government would not supplement any of it. If we made $10,000 less this year than we did last year, we would have to sell off some of our property or risk losing it. With all of the discounts and specials that the farmers get anyway, why should they be different? WHy should I have to pay someone that admittedly only plants certain crops for the government hand-outs year after year when the fact is that he is still making more money than me?|`|be5d02d1dc7db03c5839affa5d0d722faa	Need some syrup on the pancakes<br>  that is whitehouse.gov<br>  recovery.gov<br>  <br>  The cuts are for a very small number of mega rich farmers that have been getting extra bucks for nothing and as they need funds to supplement the poor ones...the extra is taking away from the ultra rich ones <br>  <br>  Rural voter|`|otYOxmnuaa	He's working on it:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/us_obama_farm;_ylt=AlxvpMS4eGZ9EJfpfS_heSnZn414">http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/us_obama_farm...</a><br>  <br>  And he enacted Cap and Trade policies on top of that (or it's in the pipes).<br>  <br>  He's not to bright for a Harvard man.<br>  <br>  He'll devastate the farming industry and push prices up on food and consumer-goods...further hurting those who need the help; lower/middle classes.|`|63e413147f262ec68d5946ef36ffb354aa	The farm subsidies are one of the few areas where I might agree with Obama.  The program is one good definition of earmarks.  There were started to help struggling farmers but have become the cash crop for may farmers.  They were also used to cut the acreage of certain crops to support prices.  But now we are also subsidizing corn for ethanol. While there may still be some need to provide subsidies to conserve land and help subsistence farmers, the million dollar subsidies should be eliminated.|`|8rvXwx7Qaa	I'm not an Obama supporter, but he is addressing a ripoff by huge conglomerates who farm, partly, because of the subsidies.

You shouldnt fail... just dont give up and if you do fail at something, i mean not the school, but anything in there just keep trying and do it again... Really man... its not hard at all...  If the cadre are like Drill Sergeants, then it might be a lil intense, if its runned by the Air Force it shouldnt be lol
AA10709853	not easily no.   it is very difficult to add parents as a dependent.  you pretty much have to provide more than 51% of ALL their living expenses for a year( be able to declare them on your taxes) before you can even start the process.  and then all the ID card would be good for is access to the base.. NOT necessarily all the  facilities.. for instance.. medical.. they cannot be seen off base at all under Tricare and can only be seen on base Space A.. and they are BELOW retirees in category.|`|ABmZYbDZaa	You would need to be providing more than 51% of his income and claiming him on your taxes before you can even begin to try and claim him as a dependent for the Military.|`|9tcv3TiWaa	Only if you are listing your father as a dependent on your page 2.

hDOBfBZeaa	No they don't, that's why they have to ask. Now you refusing gives them reasonable suspicion that you may be trying to occult something so they call the dog out. If a dog "alerts" it is all they need to presume there are drugs or any other type of contraband in the car. Most dogs now are taught passive alerts where they will most likely just sit instead of "scratching". They can now search without consent or a warrant because of probable cause - at this point it may be a search incident to arrest. If you truly feel wronged, file a formal complaint at the department. They have a legal obligation to review and investigate all complaints of misconduct. Just to clear things...the dog was not interested in chex or jerky, and he can walk past as many times before he alerts it does not matter. I know this just from experience.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|JDltTREfaa	Yes.  The police have to right to search even when you refuse permission if they have probable cause.<br>  <br>  A drug dog is essentially an expert witness.  If the dog "hits" on the vehicle, the officer has probable cause to conduct a search.  You have the right to refuse to give your permission - but they still have the right to conduct the search.  There is absolutely nothing you can do to stop the officer from searching and frankly, you shouldn't try when the decision to search has been made because arguing and protesting won't do any good but it'll make the officer more suspicious.  <br>  <br>  (I once saw a drug dog hit on a broom handle.  The janitor had purchased and used marijuana on his break and had transferred the scent to the broom he used.  If this guy had touched your door handle, it stands to reason the same result would have occurred.)|`|CZlUhRfkaa	As long as there is probable cause the officer can search your car.  If you know there is nothing in your car, let them search.  If you refuse and they bring in a dog, the dog can potentially damage your car.  I've seen scratches on the hood of cars from the dog's claws.  Finding the odor of drugs on a door handle like you mentioned is nothing they can charge you with.  They have to locate a certain amount of the drug to either issue you a citation or arrest you.  The dog is trained to not get side tracked by food odors or other distractions.  You can say all day to the officer that you do not do drugs but how many "druggies" say that to them as well?  Point being, if you know you are innocent and there is nothing to hide...then let them look.|`|a8e1KcS2aa	The dog hitting on the car is probable cause for a search of the vehicle.  You cannot refuse when there's probable cause for the search.  Remember, these dogs are specially trained and can hit on the slightest bit of drugs... could you have been carrying a passenger who at one point may have had drug residue on their hands?  We used to take our dogs to a junkyard, hide a dimebag of weak-odored weed in various places (often the wheel wells of junked cars, or gloveboxes, the smellier the better) and the dogs would still hit on the drugs.  These dogs don't really make mistakes.|`|AA11250547	"I understand sir,but it's not me it's the dog" right! unfortunately the"dog" can give them "probable cause"so the search is on.Now knowing that they will hold you and make you wait for the dog anyway,to save your own time let them search the car.<br>  If someone had dope on their hand and touched your handle(huh?)its not your fault (how much can you stash on a door handle) bull****!|`|AsBDCnYJaa	yes because a vehicle is movable|`|xLm6tO7Zaa	Again, the police ultimately can do whatever they want. Sure, it may be found that what they did was improper after the fact but then again that is`after the fact.

If you only see them as normal human beings and not as cops then that starts to take power away from them. If you refuse to recognize their authority then they start to loose it. If you get other people behind you then it starts growing into a movement and hopefully it keeps growing until the police feel really disempowered and you start feeling more empowered.<br>  <br>  The government wants the police to have power and so do the corporations and the wealthy but the people don't really like the police so you have to organize the people.<br>  <br>  Look at a cop, they are really just a naked person in a blue uniform with a shiny metal thing and a gun, you can wear blue and carry a gun and wear a shiny metal thing what makes you different from a cop? Start thinking more like that and you start on the path towards enlightenment
n2oEhdZiaa	An employer cannot force someone to use their vacation time.  I find it ironic that people who work at "professional" employers such as law firms are not more aware of the regulations in order to defend themselves legally.  Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve is a good organization with employer information so they can understand their obligations.  USERRA, I think, is the actual law/policy.  Often times, communication with an employer or teacher is key.  If they know you are going to be out well in advance, they can be more accomodating.

As soon as he managed to "take power and rule," he began to transform the country into a war machine and opened up the concentration camps to appease his Warburg/Rothschild/Rockefeller creditors who wanted to reduce the world's population, and he promised them the wealth of his victims as repayment for the loans.<br>  Had the Japanese not bombed Pearl Harbor (with a little help from our administrative staff) and Britain not carried out false flag submarine attacks on our coasts, we would have stayed out and Germany would have conquered Europe then come for us.<br>  Hitler was insane, probably from Syphillus and whatever else he picked up in the brothels where he met Roehm, Goering and Goebbels.

T8nap2Pnaa	There are no US nonimmigrant visas that would prevent you from getting married. Certainly, you could get married. The only question is whether you are subject to the 212e 2 year residency requirementt or  not. If you are not subject to the requirement, which would be marked on your visa and the DS-2019, then you could be  processed for a green card based on your marriage without leaving the US as well. If you are subject to the residency requirement, then you would need to get a waiver through the Department of State, or you would have to live in your home country for 2 years before you could get an immigrant visa and return for a green card.|`|c89e8a8d2f01012dab70c75ef596258daa	Usually you can get married in any country you choose, but if your visa restricts marriage then you can't...you need to check your visa conditions.

The Democrats promote free trade, numerous welfare programs and more liberal policies. Sometimes the two parties agree on issues such as social security, unemployment insurance, foreign policy and civil rights<br>  Members of a political party should have many of the same views as their colleagues, and are expected to vote in a manner that would be advantageous to their party. The idea behind this is that there is strength in numbers, and to gain political backing and money, they must advance their colleagues as their colleagues advance them<br>  In American history there have been many cases of third parties in addition to the major two parties. These are permitted by the US constitution. Some examples of these parties include the Green Party, the Libertarian Party, and the Reform Party. Often when they run for office, they do not have enough support to win, however they can leave their mark on the election by removing enough votes from a more popular candidate to allow a less popular candidate to win. This was the case in the presidential elections of 1912 and 1968 when the Democrat Woodrow Wilson and the Republican Richard Nixon became president, respectively!|`|sf7lOcIiaa	Because the two major ones we have at the moment are too damn similar.|`|97797ba9147d118ff799dabba9ac3649aa	1.)

YupMCYHlaa	The real difference is that liberals believe in people, working people, families, kids, etc. while conservatives believe in business.  Conservatives believe in 'trickle down' economics--make the rich richer and they will invest, hire people, and raise the standard of living for everyone.  Liberals believe in 'trickle up'--empower people and give them a decent standard of living and let the rich compete for their dollars.<br>  <br>  Over the years it's been liberals who gave us the 8 hour day, the 40 hour week, rights for blacks and women, public education, medicare and Social Security, unemployment insurance, OSHA and the EPA,  the 'social safety net'.<br>  <br>  But in the last few decades, the Republicans have made a bad word of 'liberal'.  They've used it as a negative word to dismiss people--'Oh, don't listen to him, he's just a liberal'.<br>  <br>  In fact in 30 years they've worn the word out, it doesn't mean anything at all anymore.  So in this last election they use stronger words--socialist, communist, marxist.  How often here on Y/A do you hear Obama called a 'socialist'?  But anyone who says that either doesn't understand Obama or doesn't really know what socialism is.  It's just a bad-sounding word and they don't like him so they call him that.|`|E9XL5x3Paa	Fiscal liberals are willing to spend government money (tax money).  Fiscal Conservatives try to save as much money as possible.<br>  <br>  <br>  Social Liberals are for leaving most people in charge of their own decisions.

It's the same old tactic being employed, "Divide and Conquer".<br>  <br>  Allow me to demonstrate by examining one specific area.  Supposedly, a Conservative is pro life.  Yet when it comes to War, their fear comes to play and they claim it's okay to kill  because they have been told by "The Powers"  that it's a necessary evil.   They comfort themsleves with the idea that it's much worse to kill ones OWN  poor helpless defenseless little baby that never hurt anyone and has never seen the light of day.  Keep in mind, war kills all; adults, children and unborn.<br>  <br>  Now the Liberal is suppose to hate killing people in wars, especially if their is no real need for it.  Many can smell that we are just being set up to fight and kill innocent humans by "The Powers".  Yet in their personal lives, they find it okay to kill unborn children if it interferes with the parent's liberties (If the parents don't want the baby).  They can't even see an unborn child as alive so they're convince that they are not evolved in murder.<br>  <br>  What we term a Liberal or Conservative are in reality one in the same, Hypocrites;  humans that kill when they deem it necessary or convenient for them to do so, while claiming their poop don't stink as bad as the others.  The label is just there in an effort to divide them up by the condition that they are most willing to kill for.<br>  <br>  This is but just one example, you can do the same for most every other issue used to culturally separate one from the other; be it spending preference, size of government, type of government, etc.<br>  <br>  Edit:  3-5-09<br>  Liberals are supposedly for government paid education.<br>  Conservative supposedly would prefer it paid out of pocket.<br>  Who cares, if we pay for it out of pocket that means less taxes need to be paid.  The important issue is who is in control of our schools and what are they teaching our kids.<br>  <br>  Liberals are said to want big government; government in everything.<br>  Conservatives supposedly would have it smaller or non existent.<br>  I say what difference does it make;  government is bought and paid for by "The Powers".  It's not as if "our" government actually works for us, we just pay their bills.<br>  <br>  Liberals are suppose to be a bit relaxed with the words in the bible, daring to try to "FREE think" an understanding.<br>  Conservatives supposedly try to strickly adhere to the words of THEIR bible.<br>  I say, there is one message from God:  "Love one another";  any writing that trys to deviate from this message is surely written from a lesser god.<br>  <br>  The Youngbloods - Get Together (1967)<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4fWN6VvgKQ&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4fWN6Vvg...</a>|`|AA12020119	For the most part it is trash talk for the Democratic party, which does have some liberals. They are not Socialist, who have their own party!<br>  <br>  Those on the far right, commonly known as Fascists, do not understand the meaning of the word Liberal!<br>  <br>  "Liberalism has its roots in the Age of Enlightenment and rejects many foundational assumptions that dominated most earlier theories of government, such as the Divine Right of Kings, hereditary status, established religion, and economic protectionism. Liberals argued that economic systems based on free markets are more efficient and generate more prosperity.<br>  <br>  The first modern liberal state was the United States of America, founded on the principle that "all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that to insure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed."

They tend to be Christians and nationalists.  They are usually pro-capitalism and against taxation for providing social programs to the poor and indigent.  They tend to be Republicans.<br>  <br>  If you heard anything about Libs or Liberals in a derrogatoy sense, it would be attributable to a Republican conservative.

GHPZlhAwaa	Use of force is justified when a person reasonably believes that it is necessary for the defense of oneself or another against the immediate use of unlawful force. However, a person must use no more force than appears reasonably necessary in the circumstances.<br>  <br>  Force likely to cause death or great bodily harm is justified in self-defense only if a person reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent death or great bodily harm.<br>  <br>  If someone breaks into your home and is threatening you, you have the right to defend yourself period.  However, if the person sees you with the gun and flees the house, you do NOT have the right to chase the person down and harm him(capture yes, harm no, kill absolutely no).<br>  <br>  As to someone bike-jacking you, you would be able to defend yourself with sufficient force to defend yourself.  The difficult question is what is sufficient force?  If he attacked you and you stabbed him, it would probably be considered excessive force.  Usually, anyplace but the home, you are legally required to attempt to get away from an attacker before resorting to lethal force, so using a knife or gun on a person trying to knock you off the bike and steal it would be excessive.<br>  <br>  whale<br>  <br>  Doesn't bother me, happens all the time and with two similar answers you know that it is more likely to be accurate.|`|MnECjJ00aa	california...eh probably attack him,but i doubt you would be able to kill him and get away with it. if it was texas or southern states you can shoot someone if they step on your property.|`|gjfq633caa	the house one, yeah you probably could kill him, its self defense. but you would only get away with it if he had a weapon.<br>  <br>  the bike one, you probably couldn'y kill him, but stabbing is a good possiblity|`|d60812b54bd94ed9b890bbc6003e6400aa	In California, statutes on self-defense are vague, and not very comprehensive.  Most of them were enacted at the turn of the last century (not this one).  The current standards of self-defense in California are based mainly on the precedents set by previous court rulings.<br>  <br>  A person in California would generally be justified in using force sufficient to cause death or great bodily injury only when their attacker is already using such force and the defending person "reasonably" believes that he or she is in immanent danger of being killed or severely injured.<br>  <br>  However, what legally constitutes such a "reasonable" belief would be determined by a jury and not by the person who acted in self-defense.<br>  <br>  California's "castle" statute only applies when the person taking defensive action is within his or her own residence.  In other words, within your own home, you have more of a presumption of self-defense than anywhere else.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Sorry, William, I wasn't copying you.

v7Wflu78aa	It is true that taxing the top 2% and increasing the government services for the poorest actually increases overall wealth.<br>  <br>  A society in which wealth is redistributed to the wealthy (Bush, Reagan policies) has proven less healthy - less growth, poorer stock market performance - than an equitable distribution of wealth (under Democratic administrations).<br>  <br>  In the abstract, equitable distribution has proven to be the most beneficial for ALL.  And, of course, increasing the concentration of wealth with the existing top few percent  results in a weaker economy.<br>  <br>  I am not sure that is due to the poor become more capitalistic, but that's an interesting idea.|`|A90SRsTxaa	I agree that if taxes are going to be cut, they should be for the under advantaged.

YHPYg7pWaa	Let us be honest here;When it comes to gross incompetence, Harriet Harman and Gordon Incompetent Brown have no right to criticise anyone.<br>  From the very date they took office it has been just one disaster after another and the point I am trying to make is it  could have been avoidable with a bit of thought.<br>  We started with the usual Labour University and College undergraduate headliners such as.<br>  Getting British Banks to write off  billions of pounds of debt by South American Dictators.Need I say that money these British Banks can do with now.<br>  Then there was the usual appeasement to the 'lefties' or veiled 'commie's'In this case the slogan was;Squeeze the rich 'until the pips squeak.But this time Gordon Brown dips his fingers into the Private Insurance Pension Funds.Now this incompetent  manoeuvre does not affect the rich;But directly affects the  ordinary pensioner;literally placing some pensioners on the 'starvation'  line. The very people Labour of old have pledged to protect.<br>  Finally;Who could forget Gordon Brown's master stroke!What was that?Selling our gold reserves for a pittance of $240 an ounce that is now worth $940 an ounce.<br>  Not only should they stop Fred Goodwin's pension for good;But someone should be asking.Should we also be asking this question.Should we be also looking into ways of stopping Gordon Brown's and Harriet Harman's  Parliamentary pension as well, for the very same reason:Gross incompetence.|`|44AkhdRnaa	looking at this new labour government their monthly pay cheque is a reward for incompetence.<br>  <br>  It is certainly not based upon performance!|`|0b04c7a0c2d6347def6134f6598d75d4aa	No. Civil servants are not accountable in the slightest.

K1h9x0s5aa	not true at all... never go in under open contract! it may take you a little longer to go in but make sure it is what you want to go in for. remember you will be in this for atleast 4 years.|`|3caq6SFxaa	Open contract is just that you go where the Marine Corps needs you and they think you fit best. Some positions in the technical fields are left open for people going open; in other words they do not fill every slot in the schools with guaranteed people.  Not knowing your score or what your degree is in makes a judgment pretty hard but the recruiter is probably making a guess on it.  I was a recruiter and put some impatient kids in on open and was pretty good at figuring out where they would end up though it was a guess and I did miss.  If possible sign up in delayed entry and get the field you want and ship out later on or go now and take your chances-the DEP route might work also of they can ship you early so should chweck on that also..|`|3Z9npp2maa	They will assign you as a ground pounder, no questions asked.<br>  <br>  If you have a college degree the best option would be to go to OCS and become a combat commander.|`|K8qAniReaa	Your recruiter does not have access to basic training openings.  Only your career counselor does.  You will meet your career counselor at MEPS after taking the physical and the ASVAB.  If you do go in on an open contract you will be placed in a crappy MOS that no one else wants because everyone else was smart enough to get the good jobs in their contract.  You are guaranteed to get a relatively early ship date with an open contract. You may be able to get a relatively early ship date with a specific MOS.  But you won't know till you get to MEPS.<br>  <br>  The fact that you have a college degree means nothing after you enlist unless you want to become an officer.|`|kTITkIgmaa	Not true.<br>  A complete lie.<br>  Open contract means open contract.  They'll stick you in whatever they need but they'll also consider your scores to see if you might be good at a noncrappy MOS that needs good scores.  Don't count on it though.  A lot of people get good scores.<br>  Be patient and pick the MOS you want.  You are young; there's no rush.  This is a big decision and once you're in it you can't get out of it.  Trust me on this.  You can't **** around with the military.|`|7idyT7Obaa	1: if your recruiter opened his mouth, he's lied to you atlesat once<br>  2: if its not in writing, it wont happen|`|AA11119758	He's lying-they will tell you anything to make an enlistment. Take your time and get the MOS you want.|`|knmxq1o4aa	not true. The needs of the marine corps dictate what MOS an open contract recruit will end up with. It may be more likely that you be placed in a more technical MOS with high ASVAB score, but you can end up as anything. This includes infantry or (god forbid) something like cook.|`|LcAiHBsaaa	Ask the classifier at MEPS when you sit down to talk about your MOS (I believe the Marines is the same as the other branches when it comes to this) and see what jobs are available.

GL240ih0aa	Well, i'm not associated with any party, just an well informed citizen. But I'll tell you sure fire way to get your economy back on track is to abolish the Federal Reserve banking system. They are the very reason our country is in debt to begin with. Everyone thinks their government cause they have "federal" in the name, but their no more federal than Federal Express. Just a handful of greedy bankers who loan our government money at interest causing never ending inflation and debt/slavery. An idiot system that we let take over the U.S. cause politicians will sell their soul for a dollar. If the Government would start printing its own money, our economy would we excellent. But we let this Federal Reserve system cheat its way into America and ruin it.|`|LCpOh9OCaa	Tax cuts and investment incentives. That is how the economy is always stimulated.<br>  <br>  It's pretty basic..when people have more money they invest and/or spend it.<br>  <br>  The lower taxes are on investments the bigger the return..the bigger the return the more people are willing to invest.<br>  <br>  Tax cuts are the only proven way to get the economy moving.|`|bfe4ad38e28ddda61b321173866c1f9aaa	The best thing to fix this economy is to have the people who can not afford their bills to file for bankruptcy.  This way all of the banks will know what is toxic and what is not.  This economy will not be fixed until people have more money to spend.  The down fall was caused by over spending and no matter what the Government does, most people can not afford to borrow more to continue to live beyond their means.|`|xHZaGHPnaa	I am an outsider...a Canadian.<br>  I saw the film made during your election process when this crew was reporting audio-video on the comments of Republicans on <br>  Mr. Barack Obama. <br>  If there is someone else you would like in the "Oval Office" as your President please let the Country know about it.<br>  The perception of the USA abroad is shifting in the right direction.<br>  Your President is going to have a very positive impact on this world we live in.

I wouldn't expect it to rise above 8000 again anytime soon, which will hurt us in the long run as well.  It won't get any better with what we have in office right now.  They know as well as anyone who can add 2 and 2... that with the tax increases we all will see, in one form or another it will cripple us as a whole.  <br>  <br>  The only thing we have had benefit us, with Obama thus far is gas prices... as you saw when it became more and more apparent, he would become president, the speculators got out of the market, causing it to drop off.  However, it will be a sour offset, when it costs double to turn on a light in the coming months.  <br>  <br>  It's sad to see so many folks, uneducated in the facts... do some research and look at the trends.  It's plain to see.|`|zUZRPmYAaa	Not till Obama the nothing is out of office!|`|A90SRsTxaa	Not a republican. Somewhat of a conservative. Probably best labeled under classical liberalism. <br>  <br>  We are in real bad shape. This is not 8 years of bad decisions happening. It is every thing trying to fold. The whole world is facing this. It isn't just us and some partisan talking points. <br>  <br>  If you look at the history of banking, the fractional reserve banking system, study history way past the revolutionary war and take a look around you, you will see that we are in some deep ****.<br>  <br>  What we are doing now can only put a bandage on an arterial wound. The fall of the money system is inevitable. The framers built a whole new system because of this very thing we are facing. The Federal Reserve Act and the 16'th amendment(1913) put us right back into it.  Progressives have good intentions, but they want to progress in a system that is destined for failure.<br>  <br>   A debt based money system, where only principal is created, and the money needed to pay interest is never created, can not last. It is impossible. Regular people get squashed, and the bank owners end up with every thing. This is just a simple concept of minor mathematics.<br>  <br>  We are in for it. Every one wants to progress into the future, but our past is unreconciled. There is no choice but to go back to somewhere in the late 1800's and start again.<br>  <br>  The current banking system is doomed. There is no way to get around it.

No.  Reagan got us out of a worse economic situation by doing the exact opposite, cutting taxes, and let the wealth trickle down to everybody.  As a result of that, the living standard of all in the nation risen and people had the money to spend out of the bad economy.<br>  <br>  Is it a smart strategy to bring our great nation closer to his socialist ideology?  Guess so.  Punish those (including all the small business owners)  that create jobs and wealth for our nation, and jobs and wealth will slowly disappear.  As a result of that, rather than raising the living standard of our poor and middle class, everybody's living standard will be driven down to those of the poorer folks of today.

The United States before WW 2 were isolationist, they didn't care what happened in the rest of the world as long as we weren't involved. After WW 2 the govt changed there stance on world affairs. With the rise of communism in parts of the world the U.S. became seen as the big brother to the world. The U.S. had became one of the biggest of the major powers in the world. That the U.S. would step in and try to fix what was wrong. Look at the reasons why the United States went into Korea, and Vietnam. A lot of the conflicts that the U.S. had gone into wasn't because we wanted to, it was because they were asked to. Like Operation Desert Storm. What has hurt the country the most was former President G.W. Bush. The country was upset after 9/11, and wanted the people who were responsible for it to answer for what they did.

Afterwards, a man in Pakistan gave the secrets to Iran. Chinese nuclear bomb plans were also found in Libya.<br>  <br>  The Cuban missile crisis would have never happened if American born spies did not give nuclear secrets to Russia.

5axNEp8jaa	For a Population of 3% of the US population  Jews represent a huge chunk of the media and Government, I believe 5 Members of the Bush administration were Jews, Objectively speaking a distinction must be made between the Zionist and the Jew. Jews own nearly every media outlet in the USA . One must accept editorial bias as a part media practise even in the BBC one could arguably claim it is biased but it has little or no Jewish influence, therefore whoever controls the Media or Government dictates its intellectual framework and ideals and ideas.<br>  If one looks at US shows Comedy and Drama it always includes a Jewish Character therefore instilling the Jewish identity in the minds of the Goyim. I believe that Hollywood churns out countless Holocaust movies, in films such as indiana Jones the culprits are always Nazis in this respect Hollywood instills Jewish culture of victimhood god v bad into the minds of the mainstream population this does nothing but acclimatise the mainstream to the acceptance of control of a minority with an overwhelming monopoly of power. in effect whoever holds the mainstream Media and most influence on government will hold the most power. That power is thus used to shape the moral direction of the country in the direction the power holders want usually it is the moral decline of that nation and more importantly the sustaining and emboldening of the state of Israel..|`|d0f93ace5169bf1fc1696345cdb101c2aa	We are so in control of *everything* that you don't even suspect how much.<br>  <br>  OK, satisfied with that answer?

Vu7kCPesaa	Because we have the Eighth Amendment to prevent that.

Perhaps. But under the justice system here in the U.S, it's considered more acceptable for 10 guilty people to go free than for one innocent person to get punished.|`|bc830b1601cd7380ec1f17c83fef3a4eaa	A couple of reasons. First, we are the ones who backed and enforced the Geneva Conventions. By torturing people we would be viewed as hypocrites and would lose credibility. <br>  <br>  Secondly, can you really trust anything someone with bamboo shoots shoved up their orifices? After a while, these guys would tell you anything just to get the torture to stop. It has been proven time and time again that information obtained through torture is not always reliable. What would you do if someone had you tied down while shoving a catheter into you without any gel to help? How about someone breaking your fingers one by one at each of the knuckles? I am sure you would just want them to stop and would tell them whatever they wanted to hear to get it done.|`|BWvIllhKaa	Because it is unconstituational. it is wrong and you know it.|`|XVMxuADtaa	Haha.<br>  <br>  Nice try.<br>  <br>  How good is evidence that is obtained by someone wanting a beating to stop?|`|27a6064141149e4c067b229800e7b9ffaa	Because torture does not extract confessions, it persuades people to be culprits. If someone arrested you and said "we know you assassinated JFK. We know you did it, confess" you can carry on denying it as long as it took to get you to court and for your denials to be proven. If someone was flaying you alive saying "we know you did it, and we're not going to stop torturing you until you prove us right" I doubt you'd rather die a wickedly painful death for the sake of your innocence.<br>  <br>  So essentially torture is only good if you want culprits - and you can assure the majority of your supporters that none of them will ever be accused. Essentially if you can find a minority (reads 'Muslims and Arabs' today, go back 70 years and it read 'Jews and Blacks') who you can torture and who doesn't have a voice to speak against it then the majority will seldom complain.|`|fAaLjlI0aa	Because we have enough problems with false confessions as it is. Confessions brought forth through torture aren't the most accurate, as anyone with half a brain can figure out. If you hurt someone enough, they will confess to whatever you tell them to in order to make the pain stop. What purpose does that serve? It's of no evidentiary benefit whatsoever. A conviction based on such methods is as likely, or more likely, to result in the incarceration of an innocent person as a guilty one. <br>  <br>  Now you can say they would only use torture against the guilty, but that assumption would be false on so many levels. First of all, law enforcement has many times over been shown to coerce confessions from people who they *thought* were guilty, but were not. So you'd be advocating for the torture of innocent people; are you sure you want to live with that? You could be suspected of something yourself, because you fit a vague description given at a crime scene near you. Are you willing to get your bones crushed because it's an acceptable method of questioning a suspect? <br>  <br>  Also, there is no way for them to know for certain that a suspect is guilty unless they already have hard evidence indicating as much...and if that is the case, what would they need the confession for?<br>  <br>  No, there is no way to justify using torture to obtain confessions. We've spent the better part of our last president's two terms in a war that was based at least in part on false confessions obtained through this very type of coercion.|`|PWPLrUFZaa	The person being tortured will say anything to stop the torture and even an innocent citizen will incriminate themselves. So you must depend on the infallibility of the Police to always arrest the guilty party, which is obviously impossible.<br>  Suppose you were in a car crash and the other driver said you were at fault, would you then be happy for the Police to beat you with "rubber hoses" and so on until they got a conviction?<br>  Justice and truth are already estranged within court system, why would you wish to make this estrangement worse?<br>  <br>  I'll say one more thing: my uncle had dark hair and a full beard and during the Yorkshire Ripper hunt he was detained for questioning because of this similarity to the Ripper's photo-fit. Under your suggestion he would have been tortured until he confessed to crimes that he had not committed and would be now doing 30 years while the Ripper would still be free.|`|ZHNnDu1Faa	Because we live in the U.S. where are our rights are respected.

AA12087731	Too many do goodies and misfits! <br>  <br>  The death penalty should be automatic enforcement for rape, murder, arson, armed robbery or like crimes that result in death, killing police, law enforcement officers, security, military personnel, kidnapping, all terrorism and like crimes + drug trafficking, child abuse, prostitution control, illicit selling smuggling arms etc and many others <br>  <br>  And sentence carried out immediately following a guilty verdict - i.e. taken outside the court and publicly shot, hung, poisoned, gassed or whatever! <br>  <br>  No hanging around for years on death row<br>  <br>  And all the bent, corrupt lawyers and their kind duly punished as well!<br>  <br>  + corporal punishment should be reinstated as well!  <br>  <br>  What a transformation there would be - the long lost freedom and safety to be alone, walk alone, with any impediments whatsoever!|`|anfhcnWeaa	i'm all for the death penalty but i think that when they give the death penalty that they should execute them immediately instead of waiting all the time that they actually wait. so for example they sentence some one to death they should take that person right then and there and execute them. hell they should do group executions it would be more cost effective. <br>              hell i wish they'd bring back the Electric chair at least it'd be more amusing to watch and more painful for the SoB who's being executed. Or even better bring back public executions so that would'be criminals would think twice about doing whatever crime they are about to commit. bring back the guillotine chop some heads off in public hey it worked in the dark ages. <br>  <br>  or even better still bring back capitol punishment so you'd still have the death penalty but then for the lesser crimes like theft,etc,<br>  they could cut off the thieves hand.<br>  if its a rapist they could cut off his 11th digit.<br>  burn an arsonist.<br>  murder a murderer.<br>  bankrupt an embezzler.<br>  attempt to murder an attempted murderer. <br>  <br>  see where i am going with this.|`|J7ZZL1bCaa	I agree 100%...Compare the number of stabbings/shootings in the 1950s (when hanging was a deterrent) to today, when the worst the killers can expect is a stint (not even life) in one of HM's holiday camps (er, sorry..prisons), with state of the art gymnasia, flat-screen TVs, DVDs, pool tables, computers etc.<br>  There are now more stabbings/shootings in a week than there were in a year in the 1950s......a sobering thought.<br>  To the namby-pambies who state that 'innocent people may be killed by mistake'....give the death penalty only to the ones who have been proven guilty.....caught red-handed, in the act, overwhelming forensic/DNA evidence (it's MUCH more reliable nowadays).<br>  Criminals now carry knives and guns safe in the knowledge that even if they murdered 20 children in a crèche and waited there for the police to arrive, that they would not hear that dreaded sentence..."...to hang by the neck until you are dead".<br>  There are hundreds of young people who are dead because some namby-pamby 'human rights' prats decided that it was 'uncivilised' to execute murderers.

I supported capital punishment for a long time, but the more I learned about it, the more I came to oppose it.  In the end, several factors changed my mind:<br>  <br>  1. By far the most compelling is this: Sometimes the legal system gets it wrong. In the last 35 years in the U.S., 130 people have been released from death row because they were exonerated by DNA evidence. These are ALL people who were found guilty “beyond a reasonable doubt.”  Unfortunately, DNA evidence is not available in most cases.  So, as long as the death penalty is in place, you are pretty much GUARANTEED to occasionally execute an innocent person.<br>  <br>  Really, that should be reason enough for most people to oppose it. If you need more, read on:<br>  <br>  2. Cost: Because of higher pre-trial expenses, longer trials, jury sequestration, extra expenses associated with prosecuting & defending a DP case, and the appeals process (which is necessary - see reason #1), it costs taxpayers MUCH more to execute prisoners than to imprison them for life.<br>  <br>  3. The deterrent effect is questionable at best. Violent crime rates are actually HIGHER in death penalty jurisdictions. This may seem counterintuitive, and there are many theories about why this is (Ted Bundy saw it as a challenge, so he chose Florida – the most active execution state at the time – to carry out his final murder spree).  It is probably due, at least in part, to the high cost (see #2), which drains resources from police departments, drug treatment programs, education, and other government services that help prevent crime.  Personally, I think it also has to do with the hypocrisy of taking a stand against murder…by killing people. The government fosters a culture of violence by saying, ‘do as I say, not as I do.’<br>  <br>  4. There’s also an argument to be made that death is too good for the worst criminals. Let them wake up and go to bed every day of their lives in a prison cell, and think about the freedom they DON’T have, until they rot of old age. When Ted Bundy was finally arrested in 1978, he told the police officer, “I wish you had killed me.”  Khalid Shaikh Mohammed (the architect of the 9/11 attacks) would love nothing better than to be put to death.  In his words, "I have been looking to be a martyr [for a] long time."<br>  <br>  5. Most governments are supposed to be secular, but for those who invoke Christian law in this debate, you can find arguments both for AND against the death penalty in the Bible.  The New Testament (starring Jesus) is primarily ANTI-death penalty.  For example, in the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus praises mercy (Matthew 5:7) and rejects “an eye for an eye” (Matthew 5:38-39).  James 4:12 says that GOD is the only one who can take a life in the name of justice.  In John 8:7, Jesus himself says, "let he who is without sin cast the first stone."|`|cf6BdTYUaa	in case you kill the wrong person... don't get me wrong I am in favour of it all the way especially for drug dealers who are parasites who suck the blood of life from their victims...but you have to make very sure you get the right person...|`|W7l1awFPaa	I'm with you, I don't really understand why people don't go for it.

OLXv3DEAaa	Kind of? But in order to be extortion in terms of criminal charges the threat has to be believable- it doesn't sound like even you believe that she would really have done it. <br>  <br>  Judging from the circumstances (you want the baby, furniture and you have a lawyer) this is some kind of contentious situation. I really doubt they would press charges and its highly unlikely she would go to prison. And the furniture and the baby don't really come into the equation (unless she's in jail but even then you'd only get the baby temporarily and no effect on the furniture sorry). <br>  <br>  If you had the tape AND she had actually called the police then you might have something on her, but even then I think they would only charge her with filing a false report.

At the end of the day, we look at the job that the recent president has done. we looked at Bush's job, and he got a bad report. We r going to do the same thing to Obama, and right now it is way too early to determine what kind of report he is going to get, but it looks like he (and anybody else who would've been president if Obama wasn't) would be getting a much better report than Bush got.|`|PaLJ4pU8aa	Bush did a pretty good job.

UWqDr0Klaa	Be careful about assuming that the Democrats are not rich or that they care about the poor.  The only thing they care about is funneling as many of the poor to the polls to vote for them.  If you look at where the party began, they were the Confederacy that opposed Abraham Lincoln's Republican party.  These are the wealthy "old money" people that inherited their wealth rather than earned it themselves.  <br>  <br>  In my opinion, the main difference is that the Republicans want to use the smart people to help them become more wealthy and will throw them a bone by giving them the illusion of being wealthy themselves.  Democrats tend to prefer a clear line between the wealthy and poor.  That's why they keep reminding us that the middle class is someone earning minimum wage at Walmart.  Anyone that has a professional career should be taxed as if they are wealthy even though they aren't invited to the same country clubs or elite organizations.  Someone making a $150K salary appears wealthy to the public, but after the massive taxes and lack of net worth without a trust fund, they are closer to a homeless bum on the street than a wealthy Democrat.|`|hwHDgGjpaa	Your party definitions may be skewed. Republicans aren't necessarily the party of the rich and democrats the party of the poor. Republicans tend to lean towards more fiscally restrained governments while democrats lean toward expanding government and its role in our day to day lives. <br>  <br>  President Obama wasn't elected by a majority of "welfare folks". He was elected by a majority of the country. The democratic majority in congress and the senate wasn't elected by "welfare folks" but by a majority. The shape the country was in as the last 8 years of republican leadership left office could not be made much worse no matter who was elected. <br>  <br>  Republicans have deregulated to the point of economic collapse and the majority of the country was tired of seeing executives enjoy multimillion dollar bonuses while their job was outsourced to cheaper foreign labor. The democrats are trying to bring a balance back to the country.|`|epYoxyU1aa	Have you ever seen a 'Poor" Democrat run for a National office? I think not!

f4Yec6iNaa	Do you realize who we owe most of our debt to? It is not China or Japan. It is in fact the Federal Reserve who holds most of our debt, who simply printed up the money and "lent" it to the government with interest. <br>  <br>  The only way to end the government debt is the end the Federal Reserve.<br>  <br>  Also the only way to constrain the government is to follow the constitution which says only gold and silver can be legal tender. As long as the Federal Reserve can print money government spending cannot be stopped.|`|AA11815233	It would be great if government spent no more than revenues.

The streets would be teeming with poor people, just like Charles Dickens' England.|`|AA11086243	if you say so...<br>  <br>  but you're going to have to cut something to the bone to make that budget...<br>  <br>  and the dems have control... <br>  <br>  one guess where they're going to start cutting...<br>  <br>  (hint: you're not going to like it)|`|h2LmAM0Baa	The dems tried to pass PAYGO when Bush was in office and the repubs voted against it.

The problem is that they don't do it responsibly.<br>  <br>  We did have a law that Congress had to balance the budget.  Gramm Ruddman Hollings.  It was passed with great fanfare in the Reagan years.  The law was to be in effect for ten years, and it included a provision that in an EMERGENCY, Congress could vote to suspend it for one year and go into debt.  Congress voted to suspend it every single year it was in effect!<br>  <br>  Congressional pay raises are sort of a red herring.  Whenever they pass a law like this they include provisions to get around it, just as they did with the balanced budget law.  They don't really cost all that much in the whole scheme of things.  Congressmen and senators already spend many times the amount of the salary just to get elected.|`|DLvHWOo7aa	It's GREAT to say that but it just won't happen.<br>  <br>  Republicans would claim it would be done by cutting welfare benefits - and they are half right, if we cut government subsidies to corporations this would be in sight. If we cut the Iraq War, Afghanistan War and downsized military while simultaneously cutting their budget it might JUST be possible but we would most likely miss out on a lot of education benefits that we have which in the long run would hurt us as a college education is like a 20,000 investment from the government for a 300,000 return down the line.<br>  <br>  <br>  And Clinton did pay down on the debt - He didn't bring us out of debt though like so many people here seem to think. He had the yearly budget at a surplus which was bringing us out of debt. <br>  <br>  To date Andrew Jackson is the only President to zero out national debt.<br>  <br>  Honestly I don't have too big a problem with China buying our debt right now - bear with me. The biggest advantage to that is that China basically has to continue buying our debt because even if they did say "Hey we aren't buying it anymore" they will have lost so much money it would seriously set them back. They are basically attached to our economy right now and the more debt they buy the stronger that attachment and to me that isn't too bad a spot to be - The world's largest rising super power effectively forced to carry us when we're down.

The Republican party is a disgrace cause it would burn the Constitution for a vote.<br>  <br>  The Republican party is a disgrace because it stopped serving the people, in favor of monied interests....long ago.<br>  <br>  Limbaugh is the appropriate figurehead for a party that has sold its soul.|`|AA10382849	The democratic party has always been a disgrace.|`|E9XL5x3Paa	Rush Limbaugh is now called your leader mostly because you guys are not putting up anyone else.<br>  <br>  The truth is that Rush Limbaugh has lost quite a bit as of late in the popularity dept.; it would appear not even Rush's fame can beat Obama right now.  He is far too polarizing at a time when the people are tired of polarization.  They won't always be, but for now they are; and it is costing Rush Limbaugh in popularity.<br>  <br>  Democrats picked up on that, and pounced.  They made him the leader because it does hurt the Republican Party.  It makes them look like they are wandering in the wilderness without a real leader when Rush is the one who has to take up the mantle of leadership.  <br>  <br>  Now it wouldn't work a lick if Republicans actually put up a leader; problem is, they haven't.  Sarah Palin and Bobby Jindal have serious image problems right now, Mitt Romney and Mike Huckabee have been relegated to the background, you guys are not picking up on John McCain for some reason (when he'd actually be a good choice being so anti-earmark), and Michael Steele threw away his leadership standing by apologizing to Rush.<br>  <br>  Rush Limbaugh is all you've got left.  I personally suggest you guys go to John McCain as your new leader.  There are no other good choices, really.|`|NqNbIp2caa	It is interesting you have caught on - the majority of Republicans evidently haven't.<br>  Yep - this is all just a very simple trick by the Dems.<br>  We call Limbaugh a disgrace. Then we call him the Republican Party Leader.<br>  Republicans are forced to dispute one claim of the other. Steele (who is supposed to be the Republicans leader) said it was ridiculous. The following day he was sent cap in hand to apologize to Commander Rush.<br>  So now everyone is instead trying to defend the indefensible and tell us Rush is not a disgrace.<br>  Given his record for driving moderate voters away from the Republican Party this of course represents a major win for Democrats.<br>  So congratulations for being the first Republican to see through the plan. The easiest solution is of course to just admit that Rush is an extremist blowhard and move on.|`|aVEVchFxaa	Yes, pretty much so.|`|AK4Iw118aa	The reason he now is called the leader of your party is because no Republican politician of prominence is willing to denounce him for his outrageous opinions and then stand by what they say. And yes, that is a disgrace.<br>  Republican leaders are all scared of Rush because Rush's constitutes threaten Republican politicians that criticize him with punishment on election day.He will continue to be your leader until your leaders get backbone and put Rush in his place.|`|NTBbZ7ITaa	its just a strategy by the left to get the GOP to silence their opposition for them.  <br>  <br>  They cant shut him up so they try to embarrass and shame the GOP ( pricking their pride by suggesting he is in charge ) into doing their dirty work for them.......anyone with half a brain knows that Rush is nothing more than a radio personality.  <br>  <br>  By apologizing to Rush...Micheal Steele lost all credibility as a leader.....he proved to be too weak minded to run the party by drinking liberal kool-aid.  How could anyone fall for such a transparent strategy?<br>  <br>  I don't trust anyone that can be so easily manipulated by morons.....the appropriate action would be to just ignore all the propaganda and strategy concerning Rush...any response to these attacks gives them credence.<br>  <br>  Oh, and I doubt you are really a Republican.......the wording of your question suggests...Troll|`|SGwkPy62aa	I would not say that.  I would question why your party is supporting terrorists.  They are sending Hamas tons of money.  They stopped the prosecution of terrorists and those that attacked America and Americans.  They are closing Gitmo.  They have already started sending terrorist back to their countries to continue the terrorism against America.  All this is going on, and you think Rush makes our party a disgrace?  Now if that don't take the cake.|`|Lq4306a5aa	Yeah it does.  Your leaders a radio host with tons of corporate sponsors.  He speaks the so called truth about how Obama is stealing the hard earned money from Americans and then plugs "LifeLock" and how that is helping him protect his money.  He plugs sponsors in the middle of his rants and people hang on and believe every word he says.  Some people at least.|`|AA10307482	You are correct. The GOP are having a hard time finding a leader who is acceptable to the right wing of the Party and who also is appealing to Independents and the Center.<br>  Sarah Palin looks great when standing next to Rush Limbaugh!|`|81Iglngeaa	Rush Limbaugh is in no way the leader of the political party, i dont hate him or anything but to say he is the voice of all republicans is laughable|`|FZRWMc3Baa	I could call him the first man to land on the moon but it wouldn't make it true.  Just like this bs.  With Bush gone, the left needs a new villain.  It's Rush's turn.|`|JBK0I9aGaa	nope.  RINOs make the party a disgrace.|`|eR4S8e0Waa	Limbaugh has long associated himself with "conservative" (actually corporatist) Republicans, lending them support when they support his rigid ideology.  But Limbaugh will tolerate no one who questions what he says--including Republicans.  He places himself above the party and the nation; from his perspective, people agree with him or they are wrong.<br>  <br>  To some 30 million Americans, he does appear to them to be their political leader.  The percentage of these who are Republicans, by definition, have made him their party leader by default.<br>  <br>  He also stirs up passions that motivate people to place phone calls and denounce bitterly and sometimes hatefully all who question their fealty to his pronouncements.  Republicans who must run for office must take into account such enthusiasm; if they offend Limbaugh, they risk losing far too many votes to win an election. <br>  <br>  Finally, it is the Obama spin machine that has actually tagged Limbaugh as the Republican leader.  It is now up to Republicans to show the rest of the nation who their leader(s) really is (are).  So far, the huge numbers of Republicans who have rallied to Limbaugh's defense suggest that he is at least one of their most prominent leaders, regardless of what the Obama spin machine may say.|`|s8cZsSX0aa	As a Republican myself, If you believe Rush id the Leader of the GOP, then you must either be a democrat, or are brainwashed by the current administration. Democrats have made the claim he is leader, not the people that count.|`|54BNjxBqaa	Yes. It reduces your party to a showman's party.

Mp9Q9An4aa	YES! And it's nothing to do with republicans, democrats, communists or fascists... It's down to political corruption & secrecy on all sides. To state an example, the president of the USA has entered office with fewer papers than a regular born & bred citizen of the USA requires for re-entry after a foreign vacation.<br>  <br>  It's gotten so bad that I'm close to losing my faith in science because it's been corrupted by it's paymasters [ie: government].<br>  <br>  The level of conspiracy theorists we have now is damaging to society as a whole and I lay blame entirely on politicians.<br>  <br>  I don't know how we can rectify things but I sure as hell know that we need to.|`|5d9pCmjyaa	Yes, but it's mainly because the Republican mind is naturally suspicious of others.  A study was done using a generic image of a persons face.  People were asked to describe the expression on the face.  Most self ascribed conservatives saw it as menacing, or angry while most self ascribed liberals saw it as surprised or simply dumb looking.  It was reported in "Scientific American - Mind" a few months back.<br>  <br>  Now that Republicans are no longer in control, a lot of them have let their paranoia out big time.  Their preferred method of expression has gone from seeing the world as the enemy to seeing their govt. as the enemy.  If Republicans regain control of the Govt. they will return to seeing the world as the enemy again.<br>  <br>  It's a classsic "Us Vs. Them / Friend or Foe" mentality|`|Vu7kCPesaa	The government is the greatest producer of conspiracy theories. They are always feeding us theories about some "terrorist" or another conspiring to attack us. And look what it's doing for them; they are increasingly convincing people to give up their rights and gaining more power for themselves.<br>  <br>  A "conspiracy theory" does not have to be, and most of the time is not, a guy locked up in his house with a tinfoil hat. A conspiracy theory is nothing more than an idea that someone may be planning to do something based on some sort of evidence. The media and the generally ignorant public have attached negative connotations to the words to try to scare anyone away from thinking differently.<br>  <br>  More conspiracy theories and secretive behaviour from the government provides more opportunity for theories of the government conspiring to do a variety of different things. Personally, I see nothing wrong with this. If the government is going to hide from us, we should be thinking about what they are doing.|`|NqNbIp2caa	I am not convinced there are. I just think that the internet gives them both a forum and an opportunity to gather more conspiracy theories. There were always nutcases - now they can just share their looney thoughts and tell the rest of us about them as well.<br>  As for your theory - with freedom of information and the electronic media - the government is actually more transparent than it has ever been. The only difference is now you see them being secretive - before we didn't.<br>  <br>  While we are on it - what happened to the one about Bush declaring martial law and cancelling the 2008 election - how did that one pan out?|`|m3ThrbDMaa	Ha!<br>  <br>  (And if you go by "Q Continuum's" logic, he's HELPING promote that by claiming a whole "other" government conspiracy that is hell-bent on promoting conspiracies...)<br>  <br>  The irony of his answer is killing me...<br>  <br>  (And now I believe he "conspired" to make me laugh...hee hee...it just never ends!  hee hee again...)|`|yL7ODtuYaa	I would say yes ,cause if the government is more secretive,as you said, people will lose trust, and suspicion create conspiracies, which make the person speculate on official explanations of major events.Like it happened on 9/11|`|AA10755943	I think that "suspicion" was largely being fed by folks wanting to break down our nation's trust in government, to foment angst and rebellious feelings, so that the guy promising "change" will seem most appealing.

1KGXts5Daa	From the California DMV website:<br>  <br>  If you are a visitor in California over 18 and have a valid driver license from your home state or country, you may drive in this state without getting a California driver license as long as your home state or country license remains valid.<br>  <br>  If you take a job here or become a resident, you must get a California driver license within 10 days. Residency is established by voting in a California election, paying resident tuition, filing for a homeowner’s property tax exemption, or any other privilege or benefit not ordinarily extended to nonresidents.|`|YSbCVt3Uaa	Go to your local DMV and wait in the information line.

All other aides must be paid for out of the pocket of the Congressman or Senator and health insurance and tax payments must be taken out of their pay in the same manner as all other employees of small businesses.  2) All laws which apply to the people will also apply to Congress.<br>  <br>  Passage of laws: 1) Bills presented in either house MUST consist solely of topics of similar background.  If you have an Agriculture bill, you may not include amendments on abortion rights or on transportation.  2) Any Federal court may on application of any US citizen declare those portions in violation of this amendment null and void immediately. 3) Any amendment to any spending bill must have the authors name and must be approved individually by each house.<br>  4) No earmarks for special, unapproved funding by members.<br>  <br>  Elections:  1)  Elections will start on Jan 1st of the calendar year of the election.  Primaries will be from March to June, with the general elections being held in November(thus limiting campaigns to no more than 11 months instead of the constant campaigning and raising money for never-ending campaigns)  2) Only US citizens are allowed to vote and the showing of legal ID is required.  3) All donated funds used for campaigning will be carefully kept and both the records and any excess funds will be turned over to the Treasury Dept 90 days after being sworn in to office. <br>  <br>  Constitutional rights: Any new right, that is to be guarded and cherished, must be approved by the people through the amendment process.

The Court does not give advisory opinions; rather, its function is limited only to deciding specific cases."<br>  <br>  Zeitgeist:<br>  <br>  You state "Bring the IRS into the federal government and shrink it because I would get rid of income tax."  Well, first of all, the IRS is already in the government, it is part of the Treasury Department.  Second,  as President, you would have NO AUTHORITY to get rid of the Income Tax as you have no ability to overturn a constitutional amendment.<br>  <br>  You also state "Pass a law that would clarify the 2nd Ammendment "  You CAN'T pass a law that clarifies ANY amendment, a law would have no effect on an amendment as the amendment trumps the law.<br>  <br>  To bad you haven't read the USC or you would realize that most of your ideas are unconstitutional.|`|AA12020119	I would unclassified every document I could unclassify!

E9XL5x3Paa	The first answer would be correct, it would most be placed under treason and war crimes.<br>  <br>  <br>  As to punishment, that would depend on how it is found out.  Some members of Congress want to investigate; but so far none of them want a criminal inquiry.<br>  <br>  In other words, they just want to find out what happened so that they can hang it over the heads of the Republicans.  If what is being proposed right now is the way Congress chooses to go, there would be no punishment.<br>  <br>  If there was a criminal inquiry and actual charges brought against either Bush or his Administration (and of course IF they were found guilty), it could be anywhere from a few months in jail all the way to execution.  But even if they ever did choose to go to criminal charges, I doubt execution would be the verdict.  It would be allowed, but I doubt anyone would actually give that.|`|c3be98a378a7f478cc0867a107078db7aa	as no crimes were committed, nothing will happen unless the pelosi/reid regime does an excellent job of fabrication.|`|Wn0Hj7H4aa	Wait a second--as much as i would love to see this come to pass--and life at hard labor would be nice--for some reason  i keep waiting for hell to freeze over..................................|`|LCpOh9OCaa	They would be imprisoned in the Phantom Zone.|`|Q3aZkl9zaa	Yes every war was a war crime.

20226e6187d57d2742c7b865538fa529aa	That's a pretty broad statement: you start learning about atomic physics in high school, and I'm pretty sure they don't weed out Iranians, North Koreans and so on from high school science classes.<br>  <br>  However it is true that there are restrictions on what certain foreign nationals, including Iranians, are allowed to do. It comes under the general category of export controls: the US, in common with many other countries, has some regulations which restrict exports of certain items to certain foreign countries. For example if you manufacture weapons systems in the US you're not allowed to sell them to just anyone - the US government has to approve who you sell what to - this is pretty much common sense, as you wouldn't want to find yourself fighting against a foreign army equipped with better versions of your own weapons.<br>  <br>  However the export controls apply to lots of other things, and in particular to advanced technologies such as mircoelectronics and nuclear technology. Although most technologies can be exported to most countries with perhaps some restrictions over the most advanced technology, there are certain technologies which can't be exported to anywhere, and there are certain countries to which even very low-grade technology can't be exported. Iran is one of the countries with lots of restrictions.<br>  <br>  The export controls don't just apply to physical products, they also apply to documents and information. They also don't just apply to physical exports - giving a foreign national access to a document counts as an export, even if both are on US soil, and even if the foreign national has a green card, etc. Therefore Iranians in the USA are not allowed to study certain technologies if doing so would count as an export of restricted technology.|`|lrS8UXnYaa	Honestly the way the world works and the way the USA operates its foreign policy its more likely that Iranians would be begged to study at Ivy League colleges and sent back as spies to Iran. CIA would probaly consider this wise on the face of it remember the CIA trained and armed the Taleban who are killing our troops today. MORONS who have caused a lot of problems in the world today and then send in the ordinary soldier when things go wrong.|`|JJgnJlYFaa	yes it is true that iranians are not allowed to study atomic physics in USA because Iran is one of the biggest enemy of USA. so USA doesn't want that iranians learn atomic physics.|`|YJZ8W4QBaa	i dont know but that wouldnt be fair would it................|`|81e525d2b0af9f7090cd857fd7b2095baa	They're sitting on top of one giant lake of oil but need atomic energy.

IVEanAo0aa	I have been there three times myself and didnt realize I even had a problem till my family told me....I did some self assessment and realized that yes I may have become overtly aggressive and aware of my surroundings if you will.<br>  <br>  It took alot of swallowing my pride but I finally broke down and found a counselor that I really liked and she and I have been dealing with this for about 2 yrs now.<br>  <br>  I went the initial invasion 2003-2004....then waited a year and went back 2005-2006....there were alot of things covered in that amount of time that I dont know if I could ever talk about to anyone....I am just glad I found the right counselor.<br>  <br>  Even though you are civilians now there are two things that come to mind for you and your crisis....<br>  <br>  Army One Source....they are civilians that can or may be able to help you and they give you six counseling sessions for free...I did that...and as I said I have  a great counselor through them.  If you want their number you can email me and I will give it to you...right now its 0545 a few minutes before PT and I dont carry my cell phone with me.<br>  <br>  The second place that I could think of is the VA.  They may be able to help you but just like anything else there is going to be alot of redtape and patience on your parts.<br>  <br>  The main thing is and you may not have been told this is....you are appreciated...even if you arent told or havent felt that way lately....we know who Loves us and who doesnt...and we dont always find the words in out hurt to reach out and say that to someone.  That same Love and Support you gave him when he was gone in Iraq is that same Love and Support he needs now even though he lays next to you everynight and not out in some tent.<br>  <br>  This topic is huge and it to me is pandemic.  But just like in generations past very little is going to be done about much less admitted to and there are going to be more casualities of this sort than there are healers unfortunately.<br>  <br>  I wish I could say more but I have and am dealing with the same thing you are...I am the soldier/husband in this and believe me I feel your pain...my wifes...as well as my own.  All I can say is SLOWLY things will get better.  They may not go back to whom you are used to....some changes are permanent...but you will get some semblance of the man you Love back....please be patient.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you.  Have a great day!|`|7idyT7Obaa	get him to go to the va, he'll get a monthly paycheck for PTSD that could help with ur bills and he can see a shrink. does he still hang with his old army buddies? if not, thats probably what he needs is a night or 2 of drinkig with them|`|EPpBl2Fraa	I had the same problem and a lot of other vets that I know at my school. I went to the V.A. and I took some class, saw a counselor once a week and got medication for sleeping and also for my anxiety. Things have gotten a lot better for me and I have to say that the V.A. helped. It was also all for free. One thing that can help your financial situation is Vocational Rehab. If your husband has was diagnosed by the V.A. he should claim disability. Also Voc Rehab pays for school, and you get a stipend. I would ask your husband to go to the V.A. Things should get better. Its really the ptsd that is consuming your husband. I know, it used to consume me too. I learned to deal with it, and life is much better. Good luck|`|Nzm0O9UOaa	I was in almost the exact same situation. My ex was 11B and half way through the tour in Iraq he started screaming at me over the phone. After he was shot and I moved over to Germany to be with him, things went even more south. We had great days and really bad ones. By the Time we moved to Hood he was completely intolerable. I told him counseling was no longer an option and now we both needed it. That caused some damage to his ego and he went but didn't put any effort into it. I ended up moving back home for the remainder of his enlistment. When he got out jobs were hard to come by and things got even worse. The yelling and mental abuse was too much. I filed for divorce. In the end, losing me was too much for him to cope with. He tried suicide, but was caught. He eventually got the help he needed and the meds. He is now living life as normally as he can and is engaged to be married. I have also moved on and am engaged to one of our friends we met while stationed in Germany. My ex-husband knows now that he was at fault and we are good friends. We are even inviting each other to our weddings. lol<br>  Bottom line is he has to get help. Get to the nearest vet hospital or clinic. Without help things can get worse for both of you.|`|014NXPfFaa	He can see someone at the VA - mental disorders dont usually heal themselves.  Don't make excuses, ask him to schedule an evaluation at the VA (btw, if there are no VAs  near you, they will even pick him up/arrange a shuttle)|`|Q7ovix19aa	The last paragraph explains the problem.  You are under terrible stress.  There is help available for you.  Start with the country health department and crisis centers.  They should be able to give you direction.  The VA can help also.<br>  <br>  Was it his idea to leave the army, or yours?  If he wants to go back, it will give you income at least.  Iraq is settled down a lot now but I don't know about Afghanistan.  That might still be a risk.

It reflects a deep crisis of American democracy. The existing institutions and political framework are impervious to the democratic expression of the popular will. Whether a Democrat or a Republican is in office does not impact the basic direction of government policy. The “two-party” system functions ever more crassly as the instrument through which the ruling financial oligarchy exercises its political power and controls the state. It flows from this essential political fact that the direction of the Obama administration will not be altered by popular pressure from the “left,” as claimed by the myriad left-liberal and petty-bourgeois protest organizations oriented to the Democratic Party. The end to war and inequality, and a settling of accounts with the crimes of American imperialism, cannot be realized within the framework of a degenerated capitalist-imperialist regime. What is required is not “change”—the hollow mantra of the Obama campaign—but social revolution.<br>  If there is one salutary impact of Obama’s election, it is that it will discredit the Democratic Party and its use of “identity politics” as a means of diverting attention from the class struggle and the oppressive and exploitative nature of capitalist society. The fight for social equality, which requires the unity of the working class, was replaced with the allocation of social privileges to small sections of various minority and/or oppressed groups. For decades, the proponents of American liberalism, backed by the various petty-bourgeois radical groups, have sought to elevate race, gender and sexual orientation as the essential categories of American society, while deliberately obscuring the significance of class. The rise of identity politics has coincided with a sharp move to the right by the Democratic Party. The promotion of affirmative action and similar policies has been accompanied, however, by deepening social inequality, including an enormous growth of social inequality within the black population. With the election of Obama, racial politics will be put to the test. The decisive social category in the United States and in every country remains class. And as class struggles erupt, they will sooner rather than later be directed against the new Obama government.<br>  <br>  These facts rip to shreds the ongoing efforts of liberals like the Nation magazine to present the new government as an expression of popular opposition to Bush and the right wing. The Obama administration constitutes an effort, on the part of key sections of the ruling class, shaken by the failures of the Bush administration and the financial debacle, to delude the American people with vague rhetoric while the most intense efforts are made to safeguard the position of the financial oligarchy, both at home and abroad.<br>  The Obama administration demonstrates the impossibility of effecting any significant change within the existing political institutions and the two-party system. These are wholly dominated by two forces: the military-intelligence apparatus and big financial interests.<br>  <a href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2009/feb2009/pers-f23.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.wsws.org/articles/2009/feb200...</a>
83d5248d76f28c690a7472da78fca428aa	I was in the 0311 field during the mid 90's and the standerd pattern is a 18 month cycle. The first 6 month is spent getting the unit up to combat shape. Then a 6 month delpoyement be it sitting on the rock, or in a ship.<br>  <br>  Day to day life is basiclly monday thru friday gig with PT in the morning and classes during the afternoon. With weapon cleaning/Maintance being done. Also lot of working parties to repair or do odd jobs. Basiclly it work out, Clean your gear, DO your chores type stuff, then turn to for the days. Generally the CO will have you run on monday and wensday, with platoon sports on tuesday and thur, While friday is generally a company/ battilion run /hike.<br>  <br>  While if you in the field IT monday morning grab all you stuff and head out for a nice 10-18 mile hike (2-4 hours) then your working about a 18 hour day while in the field with some down time. But during down time you have to keep your weapon clean and hold fire team level training.<br>  <br>  During deployment it more training unless you in a combat zone. But i was in the field for training maybe every 3rd week.<br>  <br>  As for the future prepare to spend alot of time cold, wet and hungary. There where time i sleep sitting up because of all the rain. ANd other times it was almost to cold to sleep. That if you gett to sleep, One week korea during training my company maybe got 15 hours of sleep from monday morning to friday at noon.On wensday at noon we woke up and marched throu the night to attack a target thursday morning, After the attack we where graded and got about 2 hours of down time, before we had another attack to complete, Then around thursday night at 6 we had squad size completion to see which squad can get back to base the fastest. we had 28 miles to cover with 50 lbs of gear.|`|zPCvI7dvaa	I'm not in the military but my husband is, when we were first dating i used to sneak into his barracks on days he worked. Hes stationed at Camp Pendleton basically this was his daily life: Wake up, pt, eat, watch tv, sleep, formation and etc, hikes. Classes or ranges sometimes. He went to the field for about 1-2 weeks each month. He also went to Mojave Viper for a month to train for his deployment to Iraq. He went on mue for his first deployment to okinawa, austraila, cambodia, china, and i forgot where else. One time the guys in the armory miscounted the pyro they had to turn in from the field and his entire company had to come in friday night so they could look through everyones rooms. Then they all had to work on saturday and had classes on how to fold sheets. Also when he had to go to the moutain warfare place in bridgeport their lt. told them to drink water from this creek and half of them got sick. you will probably eventually go to afghanistan, if my husband reenlist thats where hes going next. He's in Iraq right now, and hes told me he goes to the gym alot. He also said when he first joined he was very "motivated" but after about a year it wasn't what he expected.|`|rpGgwg2Iaa	I am in the Army Infantry, which is almost the same.  But I did see some things while working with marines in kuwait and ramadi that I liked better.  I also saw some things I didn't like.<br>  <br>  As far as deployment.  Expect to deploy at least once a year (marines) for around 6 to 8 months (i like this better than 15)!  And when you're not deployed, you are training to deploy!<br>  <br>  One thing I really liked about the marine infantry is their fitness.  The Army stresses physical fitness, and even though our infantry is more hardcore with it, you still see a lot of fatties runnin around.<br>  <br>  The marines really stay fit, and most importantly; a lot of their workouts are "combat oriented."  For example: 4 guys carrying one of their buddies on a litter (stretcher) for hundreds of meters, all wearing full combat gear.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps

One of my very best friends went over there 3 times, and was one of the first there in 2003... but I only get bits and pieces of what happened... I think with everything she had to go through and everything she saw, its just one of those things she wants to forget.  I don't know!  <br>  <br>  Also, a lot of people pick and choose what they want to hear...<br>  <br>  So get out there, tell your story and make sure its in YOUR own words.

Lots of mixed reviews an a lot more negative response.

I think a lot of people know what is going on over there and many know it needs to be stopped, with well over 4000 soldiers dead, many thousands more wounded and close to 100,000 Iraqi civilians dead it is pretty clear what is happening. The best care for a solider is too bring them all home too their families and friends and loved ones and give them the care they need, give them all the education they were promised and all the benefits promised. As well as a place to live so you or your buddies or any other soldiers are not thrown onto the street or going from shelter too shelter which happened big time after Vietnam. What also needs to happen is Walter Reed needs to be fixed up not just moved to another location but actually fixed and cleaned up.|`|117ba8dee6d7175b6b3f5e2480ad6007aa	I personally care VERY much about our soldiers.

The vast majority of Americans (well over 90% of us) already have private health insurance that is far SUPERIOR to ANYTHING the Government can provide/control. (indisputable fact)<br>  <br>  3.

People could prosper and were free to achieve. That means a lot to Americans.  If people really want to live under Socialism, how about they move to a Socialist nation, leaving this one as a haven for folks who want to be free?<br>  <br>  A big problem with Socialized medicine is that government decides how much it wants to spend on you.  If you will be too expensive, they let you die.  Folks are dying like crazy in the Socialized nations just waiting and hoping for life-saving treatments.  Under that system, nobody (but the party Elite) have a shot at improving their situation by working harder.  Oh, but the Party Elite improve their situation by just taking more of other people's money.

6cSZV759aa	Veteran here to answer your question.  The new G.I. Bill dubbed the post 9/11 G.I. Bill will pay for 100% of the highest tuition college in the state where you want to go to school.  In addition to that you are given an E5 BAH rate with dependents for the zip code of the school you will be attending.  You are given a $1000 a year stipend for books and are allowed a one time additional $3600 for pursuit of a cerification.  This new benefit has not been finalized and the VA has until August of this year to work out the exact details.  The only drawback to this new G.I. Bill is that you must attend a regular college, since online colleges are currently not support by this new benefit.  Hope that this information helps you out, good luck to you, and most importantly thank you for your service.
6nf42wjcaa	That's something we could "what-if" to death and we're really better off not going down that road.<br>  <br>  The attacks on the WTC, the Pentagon, and the high jacking of United 93 were a well planned and orchestrated event that required a level of planning and thought beyond the level of a few Arabs with a chip on their shoulders. They had to be funded, trained, and directed by a higher authority to pull it off in the way that they did. Whether Bin Laden was truly that acting authority or not is a moot point. The attacks happened, Bin laden accepted responsibility, and the US military brought the pain to his front doorstep.|`|41f250e890923fedf85e19be6b82cb3faa	He never took responsibility.<br>  <br>  You surely don't still believe the confession video.<br>  <br>  I thought that even the outrageous conspiracy theorists, Bush etc, had disowned that one.

If you think it is bad with 300 million people just imagine 400 million.

GHPZlhAwaa	The superpower itself?  NO!  The specific super heroes and the likeness of the super heroes, then yes.<br>  <br>  If you have a super hero from a far away planet whose appearance and powers so closely resemble Superman's that a reasonable person may believe that you are referring to Superman, then you would most likely be getting a letter from DC Comics.  But, if your super hero doesn't look like, resemble or have the same backstory as Superman, then your hero can have similar powers.<br>  <br>  ALSO, if you are making a parody, then you can use the likeness without permission according to the USSC. <br>  <br>  whale|`|45b4a58e2c83e63ef13b0588cebc511aaa	No.  They can copyright characters though.<br>  <br>  You'll notice DC Comics and Marvel have some characters with very similar powers.|`|vUiUoamVaa	that would be an infringment on what they already did - that is, you are copying them...you better not do that|`|AA11327241	No they can not copyright powers.

This is the question that terrorizes humanity since the beginning of time... And only man made constructs bring an answer to it. (see philosophy, religion, science etc) <br>  Why on Earth would you ask such a question? It's pointless! There is no real answer! Or there are 6.76 billion different answers. So that would make my variant and my word kinda pointless...<br>  Eh, I'll give it a shot!<br>  I think people have no meaning or purpose upon this Earth more than any other creature. There is no higher motive, just the natural flow of instincts we have been 'programmed' with that we must fulfill, for we are not independent creatures, but driven by our will and our environment. I don't believe in free will, everything we do is perfectly justified by one's environment, needs, fears, passions, principles. We're all the same and work the same, yet we are the sum of all experiences we've lived in an environment we don't control. Freedom and choice are illusions, for we are slaves to our own predictability. Moral values stem from one's fears and weaknesses. And we are going where we are predestined to go by our physical and psychological structure. Not by a higher power, but by our own nature. People don't change in normal conditions. People change drastically if they are profoundly frustrated by something, or after trauma - a mixture of survival instinct and adapting.<br>  We give meaning to ourselves because of fear of death. We think we're going somewhere because we are the most intelligent species here and we cannot communicate rationally with other species. This is just the result of our adaptation to this environment more based on intellect, than strength, or agility.<br>  It's up to you what you regard yourself as. And what meaning you offer your own life.<br>  How about you start studying ontology and teleology? I'll leave you some wiki links to these subjects. And then you can start studying whatever you like.

GHPZlhAwaa	It is a sticky situation since his brother is a friend of yours.  However, in answering the brother's inquiry that you would be willing to meet with this man at your lawyers office to discuss dropping the issue would not USUALLY be considered violating the order.

Generally, any discussion should be conducted by your attorney through his attorney to insure that no party is breaking the law.<br>  <br>  Service should have been instituted on this guys attorney who filed for the order against you.

When a unit loses a soldier overseas, the unit goes immediately into communications lock down and the CAO is notified. The Casualty Affairs Office works with the Rear detachment of the unit, as well as US Army HRC, and determines who the Next of Kin is, and where they are. As soon as the location of the Next of Kin is confirmed, a Casualty Assistance Officer, along with a Chaplain and (usually) a unit representative will be dispatched to the Next of Kin's residence to deliver the news and aid him or her in their grief.<br>  After that, the Casualty Assistance officer will remain with the Next of Kin in order to assist him or her with the final affairs of the deceased, meanwhile, the CAO back at the post will brief and dispatch the funeral detail, which is usually a full compliment of pall bearers, bugler, firing party, firing party NCO, and NCOIC, to arrange for full military honors for the deceased soldier's funeral.|`|Vw1GzleKaa	i've seen a case on the local news ,and some people come to your door and deliver the bad news,but if he/she the soldier has been disapeared and they dont have a clue of where or he/she is still alive ,they wait to deliver the news until they are completely sure/certain .a basd y knowlegde on this one hour local news case i watched on tv,about a local guy that was lost for close to 2years and the family never received any news ,until the troops found the remains ,then they delivered the news...|`|ANLbWyMeaa	My cousin's best friend's marine husband was killed a couple years ago.

fAaLjlI0aa	If you ever needed a demonstration into law enforcement mentality, you need only look at Trooper's answer. Assumption of guilt, right off the bat! lol<br>  <br>  To answer your question: What will happen next is that he will go before the judge, who will ask him if he pleads guilty or not guilty. Hopefully he has the sense to say "NOT guilty!" At that time the judge will ask him if he has retained counsel, and if not, if he will be hiring an attorney or (if he cannot afford one) if he would like the court to appoint one for him. This is pretty much the only thing that will happen at this court date. The way it happens from there depends on a lot of variables, including how strong the case is, how he pleads, what kind of record he has, etc. The fact that he has no record will help, because believe me once you have a record, it doesn't matter if it was petty theft from 20 years before, they will try to throw it in your face and use it to say you're just a flat out criminal, whether it's true or not. <br>  <br>  Unless they have a slam dunk case (and usually even when they do), they will offer him some kind of deal. Again, his lack of priors will go a long way here. So will his having a disabled spouse to take care of. Many DA's act heartless, but some of them are actually decent people. His attorney will be in contact with the DA. He will find out what evidence they have, and if they are offering a plea, and then he will talk to his client (your brother in law), and ask him what he wants to do from there. Your BIL will either take the plea, or tell them he wants to go to trial. I'm guessing if he really does have a clean record and this is his first offense, they will likely offer him probation and restitution, and possibly community service, with or without a small amount of jail time. While it's possible to get 6 months to 3 years for a Class D Felony in Indiana, I just don't see that happening in this case, given what you've said here. If he has a good attorney, he may even get it lowered to a misdemeanor under AMS, which would certainly be a good thing. <br>  <br>  Good luck, and tell your sister to hang in there.|`|AA11494150	He will have the opportunity to enter a plea and contest the charges in court. <br>  <br>  If convicted, there are a lot of factors that will affect what happens.

fAaLjlI0aa	No. On so many levels. <br>  <br>  First of all, where on earth can you justify murdering someone for an accident, regardless of if it was their fault or not? That's disgusting. <br>  <br>  Second, the death penalty is not a deterrent. In some cases, it raises the violence levels of specific crimes when it's listed as a possible consequence.   <br>  <br>  Third, what do you mean it should be acceptable without punishment? Your argument makes no sense. Drunk drivers should only be held accountable when they hurt themselves or someone else? What kind of logic is that? Should kidnappers only be charged with a crime if they physically injure the victim? If anything, most state laws are too lenient. Drunk drivers should never make it into court with their 4th or 5th DUI, still having had a license and never been remanded to a court ordered alcohol abuse program...yet I've seen it happen. Yes, alcoholism is a disease. So is drug addiction. I don't believe people who drink or do drugs necessarily need incarceration, but they do need to stop being treated with kid gloves in the courts, and they need to have real consequences that will matter. Treatment programs, community service that involves their crime, follow up, etc. It shouldn't take someone being maimed or killed before someone intervenes.|`|zTj6bnIlaa	No , the state shouldn't be allowed to murder and don't you think its a bit much if only a bumper got damaged.<br>  The truth is no one knows how many accidents are caused by drink drivers, the statistics are designed to affect public opinion not reflect the truth. If someone in an accident has had a drink then that accident is recorded for stats as alcohol related regardless of how it was caused and who is the victim. In all the figures released for dd we have to in fairness consider this. If for example (i don't know exact figure) alcohol is involved in 50% of accidents then we we have to assume that in at least half these the drinker was the victim, so its really 25%.<br>  Because of the punishments we never hear the drinkers side on tv ,only the views of people with vested interests or who are grief stricken.<br>  Personally i would be more worried about the 75% of people who  cause accidents while sober.|`|2fGHF3RQaa	I heard recently of a 19 yr old kid that was driving under the influence and a car coming in the opposite direction lost control and hit him head on.

But it isn't ok is it?  I'd rather the person wasn't driving around risking lives in the first place.<br>  <br>  It won't deter people, people are risking their own lives first by drink driving, so why will the risk of a death penalty then be a deterrent?  The drunk driver assumes wrongly that he won't crash, so the plan is deeply flawed.<br>  <br>  BTW alcohol IS known to cause a huge number of accidents, people involved in accidents fail breath tests at a much higher rate than other drivers tested.  Saying that in a crash between a drunk and a sober driver there is a 50% chance that the sober driver caused it is a fallacy, it is much more likely to be the drunk driver.|`|8567eea50ee05006e45298c8a269c261aa	No.<br>  <br>  As it is, only about one in every TWO THOUSAND drunk driver's get caught, and most of them have no accidents first.<br>  <br>  Even if we gave all of them the death penalty, people would still do it because the odds of getting caught are so slim.<br>  <br>  Reducing it even further will only weaken the deterrent effect.|`|AA11203798	Drunken driving is impaired driving that puts everyone at risk. people drink by choice, therefore drink drivers are acting selfishly.

fAaLjlI0aa	First, talk to your parents, because for the best outcome here you will need an attorney. You are a minor, so you are not legally able to sign any contractual agreements to pay it back. You can tell them that you do not agree with the number they came up with, and that you will not stand by the statement they coerced you into making. Do not speak to any of them again without a parent or attorney present. You may want to try letting your parents speak with them, but hopefully not without consulting an attorney first. <br>  <br>  Should they decide to attempt to press charges, then you will get brought into court and the judge can appoint an attorney for you from the public defenders office. More than likely, any statements you made will be thrown out because you are a minor, there was no parent or lawyer present, and you were coerced into signing papers that did not coincide with what you said happened. If you do end up in court, plead not guilty. They will have to provide proof of the amount they claim. The DA will likely offer a deal, because, really, that's what court is about these days: making deals. You may get a little time in juvie, but more likely you will get probation and community service coupled with restitution in whatever amount the judge deems you should pay. <br>  <br>  It is important to tell your attorney what happened that day. Tell them how you were led to an office where you felt claustrophobic and intimidated. Explain that you'd asked to call your parents or a lawyer and they refused. Explain that you were coerced to not only give a statement but ordered to rewrite that statement until it suited their own version of events, rather than the facts of the case. Let the attorney take it from there.|`|AA11203798	as you've pled guilty and been convicted the court will assess whether or not it's in the int erst of A, the state<br>   B, yourself,<br>  C, justice, to issue a custodial sentence.

In most states there is an amount that you can steal and not get in to to much trouble, but anything over that amount ($350) is called grand larceny which is a felony and can mess up the rest of your life.  You are only seventeen so don't worry to much about that because when you turn eighteen if you have a juvenile record it will be expunged or erased, that is the law in the US.<br>  Okay you should have denied any and all allegations even if they were true and that is only because admitting to a crime without an attorney or your parents being there was a violation of you civil rights, no one has the right to question a minor of a crime without their parents being there.  If the store has suspicions of you committing a crime then they should have called the cops and let them take from there, remember you want to do the right thing now, but you don't want to be blamed for something you didn't do.  If the company wants to work with you in paying back the alleged amount of lost then tell them yes, but they must have a detail list of items that your are to pay for and not just a made up number after that ask them if they can take out a little from ever check until it is paid in full, has this been going on for a long time?  They can not make you pay for something if they don't no what it is, they must have proof and that is the law.  <br>  If they decide to call the cops, do not admit to any wrong doing, they will say that you were questioned and signed a statement stateting that you admitted to the alleged crime, you just tell them that your boss made you sign that paper and told you what to write down.  Your statement can not be use against you because it was co-oursed and you were questioned without a parent being there which again is a violation of your civil rights as a minor.<br>  If they decide to fire you, they can not put in your permanent work history, dimissed because of theft without proof or prosecution, they must have factual proof to fire you for theft as well as record it.<br>  I know this is a long answer, but it was not an easy question to answer, but I hope I have given you something to think about.<br>  Remeber you are a minor in the eyes of the law and your employer has to follow the law when it comes to thing like this or you can sue him for violating your civil rights as a minor.<br>  Good luck to you and I hope it all works out for you, and stop giving away the stores merchandise. <br>  ....cya....Peace.....|`|DZzBfzVeaa	Well where i live anything over $500 is a felony!

DTSUJe2oaa	feudalism<br>   [fyOO'dulizum]<br>  Pronunciation Key<br>   <br>  <br>  feudalism , form of political and social organization typical of Western Europe from the dissolution of Charlemagne's empire to the rise of the absolute monarchies. The term feudalism is derived from the Latin feodum, for “fief,” and ultimately from a Germanic word meaning “cow,” generalized to denote valuable movable property. Although analogous social systems have appeared in other civilizations, the feudalism of Europe in the Middle Ages remains the common model of feudal society.<br>  <br>  Characteristics of European Feudalism<br>  The evolution of highly diverse forms, customs, and institutions makes it almost impossible to accurately depict feudalism as a whole, but certain components of the system may be regarded as characteristic: strict division into social classes, i.e., nobility, clergy, peasantry, and, in the later Middle Ages, burgesses; private jurisdiction based on local custom; and the landholding system dependent upon the fief or fee. Feudalism was based on contracts made among nobles, and although it was intricately connected with the manorial system, it must be considered as distinct from it. Although some men held their land in alod, without obligation to any person, they were exceptions to the rule in the Middle Ages.<br>  <br>  In an ideal feudal society (a legal fiction, most nearly realized in the Crusaders' Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem), the ownership of all land was vested in the king. Beneath him was a hierarchy of nobles, the most important nobles holding land directly from the king, and the lesser from them, down to the seigneur who held a single manor. The political economy of the system was local and agricultural, and at its base was the manorial system. Under the manorial system the peasants, laborers, or serfs, held the land they worked from the seigneur, who granted them use of the land and his protection in return for personal services (especially on the demesne, the land he retained for his own use) and for dues (especially payment in kind).<br>  <br>  Australia’s system of government<br>  Australia’s system of government is founded in the liberal democratic tradition. Based on the values of religious tolerance, freedom of speech and association, and the rule of law, Australia’s institutions and practices of government reflect British and North American models. At the same time, they are uniquely Australian.<br>  <br>  Responsible government<br>  One of the oldest continuous democracies in the world, the Commonwealth of Australia was created in 1901 when the former British colonies—now the six states—agreed to federate. The democratic practices and principles that shaped the pre-federation colonial parliaments (such as ‘one man, one vote’ and women’s suffrage) were adopted by Australia’s first federal government.<br>  <br>  The Australian colonies had inherited an electoral tradition from Britain that included limited franchise and public and plural voting. Abuses such as bribery and intimidation of voters stimulated electoral change. Australia pioneered reforms that underpin the electoral practices of modern democracies.<br>  <br>  In 1855, Victoria introduced the secret ballot, which became known throughout the world as ‘the Australian ballot’. In 1856, South Australia eliminated professional and property qualifications and gave the vote to all adult men, and in 1892 gave adult women the vote. In the 1890s the colonies adopted the principle of one vote per person, stopping the practice of plural voting.<br>  <br>  Australia’s government is based on a popularly elected parliament with two chambers: the House of Representatives and the Senate. Ministers appointed from these chambers conduct executive government, and policy decisions are made in Cabinet meetings. Apart from the announcement of decisions, Cabinet discussions are not disclosed. Ministers are bound by the principle of Cabinet solidarity, which closely mirrors the British model of Cabinet government responsible to parliament.<br>  <br>  Although Australia is an independent nation, Queen Elizabeth II of Great Britain is also formally Queen of Australia. The Queen appoints a Governor-General (on the advice of the elected Australian Government) to represent her. The Governor-General has wide powers, but by convention acts only on the advice of ministers on virtually all matters.~

HJaVcUGwaa	This is one of the biggest misconceptions about the Palestine-Israel conflict.  This conflict is neither ancient nor religious.  The conflict started in the 20th Century.

I would say that's pretty ancient.|`|E9XL5x3Paa	Depends, but one would consider it fairly recent.<br>  <br>  <br>  According to the Bible, one might consider their rivalry to have started with Sarah (Abraham's wife) and Hagar (Abraham's concubine and mother to his son Ishmael).  Hagar started getting a little "uppity" when she gave Abraham a son when Sarah could not.  Sarah told Abraham to send her away, along with Ishmael, and Abraham sent the two away.<br>  <br>  It is believed that Arabs descended from Ishmael, and Jews descended from Isaac (the son Sarah would eventually have).<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The modern conflict began in 1948.  That is when the United Nations, or more specifically the five charter members (America, Britain, France, China, Soviet Union and now Russia) created the country of modern Israel on what was mostly Palestinian land.<br>  <br>  They did this without consulting either the Jews or the Palestinians.  But since it was the Israelis on the land, the Palestinians blamed them.  They wanted their land back, so they attacked.  Israel defended itself.<br>  <br>  So in essence, both groups are defending themselves, and both have legitimate claims to the land.|`|4G78oKVTaa	3000 years, all told. it proves the human ego and religious zeal often demonstrates that evolution has not gone all that far. a visitor from another galazy would study th situation and chuckle. absurd zealot like netanyahu and a few radical muslims are still in the bronze age or worse. pride and foolishness and very annoying to outsiders. little more than gangstas in the hoods. just don't want any part of  their raging bonfire of the vanities. there ancient fued is a threat to the rest of the world and they should both get an ultimatum, if you ask me. just shut and get along or else! end of story.|`|nr96BgWfaa	like so many other wars, this is a religious war dating back to Biblical times.<br>  <br>  everything else is a smoke screen.  it's not about land.  it's not about civil rights & its not about forming an independent state for palestine.<br>  <br>  if the muslims were at our borders, we would have the same problems the Israelis have had.|`|6ebf3f6b7aeae458efe62269f5d71120aa	ancient and a waste of space, these tribal nations will never be civilised|`|rgPmkqwXaa	It started in 1947, at the creation of the state of Israel (before that the land was called 'Palestine'), when Israeli commando's started carrying out terrorist raids on Arab villages, which resulted in Arab retaliations....in 1967 there was an all out war between Israel, Jordan and Egypt, which was won by Israel, and as a result millions of Palestinians were chased off their homeland and forced into exile in Jordan, the West Bank and Gaza|`|AA10755943	Islamist - Israeli conflict is ancient.

fAaLjlI0aa	It doesn't take much to arrest someone. Probable cause has been reduced to "ah well, he looks guilty to me" pretty much. So, the short answer is yes, it's probably sufficient for arrest. <br>  <br>  Prosecution and conviction, not so much. There would need to be more evidence. Depending on the people involved (say, if the complainant was a senator and the suspect had a record of prior break-ins), it may not take much...but likely more than just the word of a single person.|`|AA11494150	The burden of proof for arrest is probable cause. If the complainant was credible, then it is possible an arrest could be made on their statement. <br>  <br>  A conviction requires a higher burden of proof, and could be more difficult without other evidence.|`|zTj6bnIlaa	You can be arrested for nothing, I've had fascists try and arrest me for walking up my own driveway, so yes <br>  If a jury was involved then no there would be no conviction, however if its a magistrate then its basically whatever their warped view of the law and their opinion says, so yes in theory they could get 6 months.<br>  A really good excuse by the burglar would have been that he was only knocking his heroin dealers window, lol.|`|AA11203798	being arrested is not the same as being convicted, therefore, it's reasonable to be arrested on suspicion, but if your innocent then sufficient evidence must be produced to justify a conviction. As well as that the hearsay rules of evidence require another evidential factor to be sustainable to quantify the hearsay allegation, and even then it's doubtful if a conviction would result from such slight allegation unless it was considered by the prosecution to be in the public int erst to pursue the allegation.|`|qKdQpZ5Kaa	you can be arrested due to loads of accusations, rape for example.|`|2fGHF3RQaa	You forgot to mention that he was holding a crowbar.|`|z8u8qFJeaa	In our WONDERFULLY FREE country, you can be arrested for anything that the police FEEL like arresting you for, that is why we have the highest incarceration rate and the BIGGEST prison population in the entire WORLD!!!   <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20090302/us_nm/us_usa_prisons_1">http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20090302/us_n...</a>   see this page it should make you want to get involved with reclaiming the rights that we do NOT have anymore!!!|`|lQcdYkz7aa	No, but it would probably be insufficient reason to prosecute the suspect.
59GymH27aa	They are doing the exact same to me and me partner.  They gave us ￡900 in rent benefit when we weren't working and now saying that because the property was above a shop...they are reclaiming the money back because it was a commercial property! They are taking ￡60 a week from my partners incapacity benefit.<br>  <br>  You need to write them a letter and tell them that you simply cannot afford the amount they are asking and you want the arrest suspended with immediate effect while you challenge the decision. We are still waiting on the decision on wether they will suspend it or not so I can't say whether it will work.

That improves the look of photographs shot under direct sunlight.<br>  <br>  [addendum] - it is most definitely not a teleprompter.  It is not in position for the President to read it while standing at the podium unless he constantly turns his head to the right.  It is positioned so that direct sunlight is hitting the face of it that is towards GW, which would make a teleprompter impossible to read.  It is not an electronic screen of any sort and is only held by the flimsiest clamp at the bottom, meaning it is a very lightweight item.

HJaVcUGwaa	You might be surprised to know that the Palestine-Israel conflict is not really that old. Israel itself is only 60 years old. This conflict is not about religion either, as Muslims, Christians and Jews lived in peace and harmony in Palestine for hundreds of years before Israel's establishment in 1948. The conflict was really started during European colonialist times by European Zionists (a group of non-religious Eastern European Jews). I suggest you read the best answer to this question, which gives you a simple and factual history of the conflict:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AjjzX3H.oD0HuZXX.NbnJDjty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090208102834AApxDtI">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  The reason you are hearing more about Gaza recently is because Israel broke a ceasefire with the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip after blockading them for more than 2 years. Israel launched a major offensive on Gaza from Dec. 27th to Jan. 18. During that offensive, Israel killed 1330 Palestinians (80% civilians, half of which were women and children). In the offensive, Israel also destroyed most Palestinian government civilian buildings, 24 mosques, several schools and hospitals, most police stations, 14,000 houses and used banned weapons on civilian areas (such as white phosphorus). In that war, Israel lost 10 soldiers and 3 civilians.  The major hostilities have now stopped, but Israeli blockade of Gaza continues till today.<br>  <br>  I have written the detailed answer in the following link during the first week of the war.

In 1947, the United Nations decided to give Israel the "title" to the land and the state was officially started. <br>  The Arabs living there whined and cried but received NO help from their Arab neighbors and when the Arabs got their  butts handed to them on two separate occassions the terror strikes began.<br>  Now Israel is under constant attack by terrorists and those in the world that want to support the terrosist thru the media. No matter what Israel does, even in self defense, it is protrayed as acting aggressively towards the Arabs living in Israel. You know, like Gaza, where the towel heads were dancing in the street on 9-11.|`|4BPYNiKVaa	in few words, before 1914 the middle east is under ottoman occupation, by the end of 1914 france occupies LEBANON and SYRIA, and great britain occupied palestine and jordan and the rest of the gulf, in 1943 LEBANON achieves Independence, and in 1948 the european israelis take hold of the land of PALESTINE and kill hundreds of thousands of PALESTINIANS, many of them flee to LEBANON, in 1967 the israeli occupy much more of the PALESTINE land and the PALESTINIANS are FORCED to leave their home most of them to LEBANON, actually there is 500 000 PALESTINIAN in LEBANON and the israelis refuse to let them go back to their homes in PALESTINE and LEBANON cannot support them , on the other hand the  israelis invaded LEBANON in 1978 then in 1982 and stayed there for 22 years steeling the food and the crops of LEBANON and committed all kinds of crimes until LEBANON freed himself in 2000 and in 2006 the israelis tried again to destroy LEBANON and failed as state the venograde commission, GAZA strip is a resistant PALESTINIAN land in the south of PALESTINE that is still fighting to free the land and to survive and we have seen the crimes the israelis committed there live on TV 2 months ago|`|ymXlF9Rnaa	<a href="http://www.terrorismawareness.org/what-really-happened/" rel="nofollow">http://www.terrorismawareness.org/what-r...</a>|`|ECbyFWLCaa	The Arab countries has to accept Israel exists, and treat the Palestinians like other arabs. As it is now, they are held in poverty so everybody is to see how mean Israel is. But if you understand it's the Arab nations not accepting their loss - or "loss", Israel belonged to the jews before the arabs took it, so the arabs have just lost land they had stolen, like Spain was taken back from them- this will not work on you. Imaging all the arabs expelled from Spain living in eternal and miserable camps in the northern Morocco while everybody tried to make it look like the Spaniards was incredible evil to have retaken their land- it would have been the same thing. The only reason this is happening, is the Arab nations think they can convince the world into thinking Israel should be destroyed. The solution is to make the arabs accepting their loss, and accepting the palestinians into Saudi-Arabia, Jordan and Egypt as citizens. As it is now, there are laws against giving the palestinians citizenship in those countries, because it would harm their claim of getting "back" Palestine! So the arabs hates Israel more than they love their own people. No other tribe has ever treated their own people this bad.|`|XTLN8D2Qaa	arab israeli conflict? don't think so.these guys love each other,they're like a family,its all rumours,don't believe the media,they eat homous and falafel together,

Secondarily because he never finished the Afghan war, let Bin Laden escape to Pakistan and let Pakistan build a pile of nukes.

Garfield, 20th US President  (1831-1881)<br>  <br>  <br>  War was declared on the United States of America<br>  2,732 days, 1 hour, 3 minutes and 51 seconds ago.<br>  Get this message on your website! <br>   <br>  Communism/Socialism/Democrat Party… No Difference in Their Platforms! <br>  <br>  Does it burn you up that so many conservatives refer to the Democrat Party as Socialist? Then you are probably a Democrat/Liberal and, most likely, you have not taken the time to see if there is anything to the accusations, from the Right, that the Democrat Party has, over time, become a socialist party. Well calm yourself! We are here to help!<br>  <br>  Recently, I received a “heads-up” from Alan Caruba of “The National Anxiety Center” and “Facts Not Fiction” concerning an article written by Henry Lamb entitled: “Are the Communists Coming?”. You’ll find the article, in it’s entirety over at:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.freedom.org/news/200710/06/lamb.phtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.freedom.org/news/200710/06/la...</a><br>  <br>  We urge you to take the few minutes to read Mr. Lamb’s enlightening article. Here’s a snippet form the article:<br>  <br>  “Should the 2008 elections go to the Democrats, as the Communist Party USA is working to accomplish, the direction of the nation will change dramatically. The direction will not be toward individual freedom, free enterprise, private property rights, and the pursuit of individual happiness. The direction will be toward the values of communism, which holds the state as the grantor of all rights, including socialized medicine through universal health care; amnesty for all illegal aliens who want to come to America; cradle-to-grave education by the state; surrender in Iraq; and acquiescence to all threats of violence; no right to own guns; and a state-assigned job for everyone.”<br>  <br>  Mr. Lamb says the Communist Party, USA is working to get the Democrat party elected in America. Why? Because the Communist Party’s platform and the Democrat Party’s platform are almost indistinguishable from each other! If that doesn’t scare you half to death… nothing will! <br>  <br>  We here at INSIGHT on Freedom have been preaching this for years now and it feels as though I’m standing in a corner shouting at myself. The words just bounce back with no impact on anyone else. Why is that? Simple: The American electorate has been so dumbed down by our American public education system that they simply don’t understand American politics, American law, the foundation of American freedom, namely the US Constitution, and they have not been taught the evils of Socialism and Communism, which for all intents and purposes, is the same thing. In other words, they have no fear of Communism! None! They will embrace Communism/socialism with open arms… and be crushed to death by those inviting arms of Communism and Socialism!<br>  <br>  If the election indicators can be believed… America has just over a year of freedom left. The Democrat candidates tell us, unashamedly; they intend to impose socialism on America. Oh, they don’t call it that, but those of us who grew up with worldwide socialism recognize it when we see it. Not to mention the 40, or so, years we actively fought it militarily and otherwise. That’s what the Cold War was about! And here… we thought we won that war! <br>  <br>  It would seem we have, indeed, lost the Cold War from within… just as our old socialist enemies said we would. They told us over and over that they would win by taking over American from the inside! And if we elect a democrat majority and a democrat president in 2008, they will, indeed, have won… and America will be finished. Our Freedom will be lost! Why, because we will have given it away as a direct result of ignorance and apathy! <br>  <br>  Again, if you do not believe the Democrat Party and the Communist Party want the same things… then we urge you to read this article and do a tiny bit of research, on your own, and you will see the truth. <br>  <br>  The plain truth is: the 2008 election will determine if America remains free or goes over to socialism and communism. It is as simple, and clear cut, as that!|`|56ee2b80889254372942af362f9b659daa	Cshs1960 said it as well as it can be said.  As the post says it will always fall on deaf ears.  The U S electorate is the dumbest it has ever been.  Yes I'm talking to you.
KKH9y0ECaa	I think you mean Canada not the UK, and the letter found was<br>  linked to LTTE chief Velupillai Prabhakaran.<br>  <br>  <br>  The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) counterterrorism investigators in Toronto seized a letter signed by the LTTE chief Velupillai Prabhakaran directing Canadian Tamils to send him Canadian $3-million, according to police files released on May 6 by the Federal Court.<br>  <br>   The letter, found during a search of the Toronto office of the World Tamil Movement, discusses the need to "intensify the struggle" and ensure that Tamils are "strong enough" to fight "with our full breath," according to the newly unsealed files. Prabhakaran also said that he looks "forward to receiving substantial contribution from the displaced people of Tamil Eelam" and advises the "Canadian office" to provide 15 of the 100 "crores" he needs.<br>  <br>  Scotland Yard in the UK have arrested several LTTE supporters in the past and takes any terrorist related information very seriously.

oi6eHkPzaa	Gordon's a trier. He works very, very hard there can be no doubt about that. As far as i can tell, his biggest weakness (in the modern political arena) is that he lacks charisma. This shouldn't matter but, unfortunately, it does. He was chancellor of the exchequer before he was PM and he did an excellent job at that. I used to feel that he was a guy you could trust to stick to his guns, no matter what, but it seems to me that he's given up alot of his political dignity by listening too much to what spin doctors have to say. In the end though, he's going to do and say whatever he has to to stay in America's good books, just like Blair did. I'm not saying we shouldn't try to get along, far from it, but it would be nice if we could come to our own conclusions.|`|XSXdMu0caa	we never like our primeministers lol <br>  i live in wales everything is always given to england first so im not happy anyway, they even get vacciantions first <br>  <br>  we didnt vote for gordon brown the last primeminister left, with the current economic crisis i dont think anyone likes him but i dont like the governemnt anywasy theyseem to spend more time argunig about things than doing anything|`|EpT4pSMeaa	He's a socialist EU lapdog.

HLHHM4Mtaa	Most who voted for Obama are void of superlatives as to why except for the color of his skin and the word "change."  Had his mantra been "insert word," they would have latched onto that as the reason.  Which brings it all down to the color of his skin as the only honest reason.  For years I have listened to blacks scream "racist" at every opportunity and having worked and lived around blacks for many years I knew they were proving that, indeed, the ones most likely to be racist are the very ones who hurl the name at those who are not.  He was elected because of the color of his skin.  He had nothing more to offer.|`|0nZHAaQDaa	nice clip, Obama was elected by ACORN, the dead, doble voting and the liberal media slqnting things for him, and he wasnt a mandate or landslide victory so if you took awaay the fraud he may have actually lost|`|SahUDTLnaa	Yes, this was the mind-set of the people. and now we have a peon for a so- called president.May God have mercy  on the innocent.|`|YsQQ30YJaa	He got elected because he is as far from Bush as you can get and still be considered to be human.|`|ERVib5gYaa	YES!<br>  Obama's disciples are the most annoying people I have ever encountered.<br>  The first guy just embarrassed himself.|`|5bYpbodUaa	OMG!  Just as I thought too. NO ONE could offer INTELLIGENT reasons as to WHY he was the best candidate. All they wanted was the uh..hm...CHANGE...I knew no one picked him because of his ABILITY to run this Country. What change were they thinking he could offer other than the obvious???? Seems to me NO ONE paid any attention during the Election.<br>  <br>  GITS!!!!!  LOL<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: Know what my hubby just said?  He used the UNpopularity of Bush to his advantage of this Election and stressed the word CHANGE and that's all everyone remembered...is that single word!!!!|`|ezQ44NqAaa	It really was fun listening to all the Obamites during the Election wasn't it?It was kind of like listening to some five year old,they really have a lot of hope for the future,but not the foggiest clue how things work in the real world.<br>  <br>  And listening to them now isn't much better,only now they sound more like a bunch of supporters of some tin-horn Dictator."Barack Obama Won,Get over it!!"

A de facto raising of taxes on the mostly middle class because Max Baucus (D) finds the limiting of charity contributions is unfair.<br>  <br>  It is painfully obvious that Obama's commitment to his promises is both low, and negotiable.  What is "hope and change?"  In Obama's own words, "they're words, just words."|`|imtw3gNwaa	Yes, his followers, as a whole, are very uninformed, and willingly so... they were led like sheep.<br>  <br>  NOPE.. he isn't rising in popularity..<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/president_obama_job_approval-1044.html#chart" rel="nofollow">http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/...</a><br>  <br>  Look at this graph... it shows he is dropping, like a stone... and before you call it biased, look at where it is from, and how it was configured...|`|bc830b1601cd7380ec1f17c83fef3a4eaa	I will tel you why Obama got elected.<br>  <br>  Are you ready?<br>  <br>  It really isn't difficult.<br>  <br>  George W.

Of course, what is bad for the Republicans is good for the Dems, and that's why they love to cast Rush as the leader of the Repubs.|`|aVEVchFxaa	LOL. I hadn't really thought of it that way.|`|PaLJ4pU8aa	The only thing Rush has united is the plumber's unit of jerks operating out of the White House Chief of Staff's office.

Sheesh.|`|SJTD3Ocxaa	I think Rush appeals to the 'dumb' ones.......real Republicans aren't like him, and he knows it.........<br>  but then he sure does know how to push democrats buttons in getting them riled up (like me, i don't like him)|`|Q7ovix19aa	Because the neo-Marxist faux-liberals in the Democratic Party use him for a straw man ploy.  Then they rally around the fraudulent claims about him and others.|`|A90SRsTxaa	Pseudo-Lib/Neo-Libs  whine and complain in their hatred while the rest of us don't give a shite.|`|1FkYHLXDaa	Oh please. One in three Republicans actually listen to Rush. I think his audience is mostly Liberals as they seem to know much more about him.<br>  <br>  Funny that Rush is suddenly making noises that the Democrats are complaining about. The guy has been around for a few decades. I guess the Liberals are hoodwinking people........and it is not Republicans.|`|1d3c4c995b23e27b80d92cbbbf32dba7aa	Look at it this Way.. First they gave us Bush,the only standing President in recent history that his own party was embarrassed about<br>  nominating their candidate McCain,than they gave us Palin who in retrospect got them thinking maybe a Bush nomination wouldn't have been that bad after all, and now they have rush who their all afraid to say<br>   anything to as they fear they will insult the 45% of those Republicans who look at him favorably,but the fact is they only count for 23% of the electorate..so support rush and the democrats are in for the next 8 years!|`|jVUEohsNaa	I find Rush articulates everything I have been thinking and feeling for a long time now.<br>  <br>  I can't stand Obama or his socialist policies.<br>  <br>  Keep getting the word out Rush!<br>  <br>  NOBAMA!|`|ygGr1nX7aa	Simply because he's so extreme, immoderate and divisive in his voicing of opinions that it's far easier for reasonable people (on both sides of the divide) to disagree than agree with him.|`|iia5857maa	more details  please
39e478f7414d720b5bfa453f2467ceddaa	No, but he inspired you to nit pick and quote out of context. YOU know what he was talking about, and you probably also know that the source of some of the softness and volatility in the markets is stock that has been overvalued.<br>  <br>  "the common ration is the price to earnings ration, of course." LOL, please tell me what is a common ration -- potatoes, spam or something else.|`|1FkYHLXDaa	Do you actually think Obama understands market profit to earnings ratio? I think the answer to that is quite apparent.|`|Ocyrox5baa	Haven't heard a thing about this on network news.   So I guess it's forgotten like all the other errors and lies.|`|t8JlnuqFaa	ohh yeah..right..good one|`|LCCz5xJtaa	Actually, from a business and finance background, I find it funny that he was trying to explain how P/E ratios are attractive and means people should be buying stocks.  Too bad he was stuttering and said Profit-to-Earnings ratios when in fact, P/E ratio stands for Price-to-Earnings ratios.  Major difference and shows another reason why a President with no experience in the market and the economy should not be raising the taxes on those people who actually understand how the economy works.  Not saying Obama specifically, but rather than no politicians should be making economic decisions when in fact their specialty is in public policy/sociology and sucking up to their constituents.|`|UDGBrOqaaa	Obama,Obama..! What he has done yet?<br>  Yelling from the podium and promising smth.<br>  He is unable man. There are more powerful people in USA. So he is just a puppet.|`|Wqsd6J07aa	If George Bush had said this, NBC/CBS/ABC would have done a 5 minute segment on it, and on how stupid Bush is.<br>  <br>  Still believe the media is unbiased?|`|pAYzU2ykaa	Yes, he inspired the short sellers to short everything.|`|i790R5DXaa	He lost me in Philadelphia debate with Hillary( about 8-9 months ago), when they had to explain to him what Capital Gains were...<br>  <br>  A:~)|`|SkWzsnuxaa	While I have no doubt President Obama and I completely disagree on how to stimulate the economy, I do put this down as a slip of the tongue.

I don't need to be any more confused than I already am!!!|`|YSuc7L8taa	Mainstream media is in bed with the Democrats so that is why the double standard in reporting.<br>  And this is why you never see Obama's approval ratings while Bush's were reported about every day!|`|1FkYHLXDaa	Same crap, different day.

AA11106660	Well, i'm a pakistani living in the middle east and one thing that connects me to the arab world is my religion - Islam.<br>  <br>  What Iran wants is to walk on the paths of religion. It dislikes the US form of politics and govermental rules. Iran has never been a threat to the arab world but to the U.S.<br>  <br>  The whole world knows that muslims never went to war on their own - only when they were oppressed for too long. And since there are so many muslim countries in the world, there should be a seperate UN kind of sitting of the muslim countries.<br>  <br>  But unfortunately, all muslim countries including my own has shaken hands with US. I'm proud of Iran for standing up for what it is and not being scared of the US. Cuz US is not the "Super-Power", Allah is. and soon everyone will find out.|`|e8a31089aa49138c1b4af72645345c52aa	huda is right imo ... the only thing that is threatened by iran is the US plans to dominate the entire middle east ... and a nuclear armed iran would be a major hindrance ... hence, iran must either be brought into line with US policy either by cooperation and treaty with the US, which is unlikely, or the US will have to continue to villify possibly to the point of staging another false-flag terror attack on its own citizens thereby implicating iran, to justify a full-scale attack.|`|AA12310886	What bounds us is islam, even if they are not arabs, so the answer to your question is no, i dont see a threat in Iran.|`|AA11092488	USA can bomb Iran, together with her nuclear ambitions, into oblivion in an instant with Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs). The only thing stopping her is the civilian casualties and the immorality of launching them.<br>  <br>  If you notice more closely, Israel only attacks when provoked (eg. the recent Israel-Lebanon war), therefore, it is not a threat. Arabs think that Israel is a threat because they relate Israel's wars of defence to that of a religious one. Similiarly, people in the Western countries think Iran is a threat to Israel and world stability because Mr. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had expressed his desire to see Israel being 'wiped off the ...' and that he had, reportedly, obtained fuel for enriching uranium, which could, in turn, be used to create either energy or deadly nuclear weapons.<br>  <br>  To Huda Alee: If the Muslims pride themselves on standing up to USA and Israel, they will never prosper and be always on the edge of development! Look at Lebanon. If the Hizbollah had not kidnapped Israeli soldiers, none of the **** would had happened in Lebanon.<br>  <br>  (Though I must admit, I despise USA's crappy foreign policies)

AA10749385	Given that the last two presidential elections were stolen - would you not conclude that it already has. Democracy in this country is the competitive challenge between politicians to see who can call in enough markers and earn enough buy or steal votes, preferentially distort the truth and the electoral process and slander the opponent, the best. And we hold this up to the world as an illuminating example of what the US has to offer. It is barely if ever a debate over principles or platforms beyond slogans.

When people are forced at Best Buy to NOT say Merry Christmas because they are afraid they will offend someone, but on the 26th, they hold their after X-mas (carefully not saying Christ mind you) sale, people are giving in. MERRY CHRISTMAS. That in mind Pelosi is messing with CSPAN cameras, something that has never been done. The Imams are morons, and yet the left thinks they are freedom warriors. A radical Rabbi got the airport to take down Christmas trees in Seattle, becuase he threated to sue.

Elle ressemble beaucoup à un suicide par société interposée... C’est peut-être psychologiquement un moyen de se réapproprier sa mort et de ne pas être comme un mouton qu’on mène à l’abattoir. Mais s’il veut mourir, pourquoi ne se suicide-t-il pas ? En exigeant que la société le tue, il demande à ce que, lui, qui est criminel, devienne victime et qu’elle devienne criminelle. On peut résumer l'argumentation de la fa?on suivante : la peine de mort ne saurait être justifiée par la vengeance. Par contre, elle peut l'être par la logique de la dissuasion. Si l'existence de la peine de mort dissuade les meurtres, elle peut être justifiée. Le débat économétrique sur le sujet, pour constater ensuite que même en l'absence de preuves formelles de cet effet dissuasif, son existence est plausible : personne, même un meurtrier potentiel, n'a envie de mourir. Dans ces conditions, même si une exécution sauve une seule vie, elle est à recommander, dès lors que cette vie est "meilleure" que celle du meurtrier. Justifions  ensuite cette comparaison, et justifions le fait de réserver la peine de mort aux seuls meurtres par le principe de la peine marginale|`|c7e22e1d3cd7b33f11708cfc5dd5f7acaa	Oui c''est un crime de tuer quelqu'un sauf si tu te trouves en état de légitime défense.La condamnation à mort est abolie en France, et c'est bien là le problème car certains crimes mériteraient d'y avoir recours.|`|1263b9724a038cff617e4fb259696393aa	Assasiner un enfant après l'avoir violé, oui, c'est un crime.

As far as the military following their so called leader that will be a personal choice as when such a situation arose there would be no longer an allegiance to any tyrannical government. The second amendment was designed for this situation and considering the amount of trampling the constitution has withstood in the last few weeks a highly possible scenario. However, this would not be a fight between repubs and dems. Dems, the 70% silent majority which includes dems and repubs libs and conservatives, will be the largest amount of protectors of the constitution leaving the far left out on a limb and easily overwhelmed and routed and destroyed within days or even hours. The Pelosi's, Obama's, Reid's and other extremist  are the enemies of the constitution and the country. The fact that the silent 70% majority has allowed this possibility of a scenario such as this happening is is an indicator that we all have become so lazy and detached from our ruling class that we have allowed them to abuse the entire system and that is what needs to stop. We no longer demand accountability. We sit back and allow ourselves to be abused and for the most part as long as we sit on our asses and do nothing we deserve what ever happens to us all. These tax evaders in Washington serving within Obama's cabinet are a perfect example. They flaunt their ability to be criminals in all of our faces and proclaim that we all will suffer the consequences they are able to avoid. If you love this country and want to defend it you can be either dem or repub as they are not the destructors. We simply like fighting among ourselves but compile a strong force against anyone who would destroy it in a mutual unsaid alliance against foes such as are in Washington presently. Dems, however slow their thought processes are, will soon wake to the threat we now face.|`|xJmDP5NGaa	The dems would lose as they would bring their purses to the fight.....|`|0f0dac4f4bfb6a4b2d01df90fd84b3ffaa	We've had this fight before, the north won, and the north was made up of left-wingers.

The south wanted to break from the existing tyranny of the federal govt. and form their own govt and country.  Most refer to the war in 1861 - 1865 as a "civil" war, but a more correct term would be the war of northern aggression.  My God, I am surprised that Americans are so dumb sometimes.

Marriage has never been between a man and a man or betwen women. Everyone knows that marriage is a union of man and woman....its a tradition of our species..going back thousands of years.  The only reason gays today are bold enough to want gay marriage allowed is a testament to the fact that our society has gotten to be so free to them that their rights are so protected that they have been given so many inches that they want the mile.  Gays are citizens, they have all rights that citizens enjoy...except marrying the same gender....that is not discrimination because society has defined marriage and everyone knows what it is...if someone wants to be married they find someone of the opposite sex and they marry.  Its not any more complicated than that.<br>  <br>  Now I do believe that gays can have their civil unions so that they can have as many contractual and legal rights vis a vis each other s possible..inheritance, benefits etc.....|`|Mp9Q9An4aa	I'm sure Americans had a vote on the gay marriage issue [definitely in CA] which makes them a damn sight more free than us poor bastards in the UK.

However, this is not consistent with the values we have laid down for ourselves in our social structure – values of personal autonomy and individual decision-making, values and codes structured to mitigate the tyranny of the majority. As Justice Kennedy wrote in Romer (517 U.S. 620; 1996), “The Constitution neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens,” but today we are tolerating a group of citizens to be denied a fundamental right – the right to marry the person of individual choice.<br>  <br>  We know from Loving v. Virginia (388 U.S. 1; 1967) that preventing marriage solely on the basis of such superficial and insignificant classifications as race violated the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. Chief Justice Warren wrote, “There is patently no legitimate overriding purpose independent of invidious racial discrimination which justifies this classification.” Mass Supreme Court 2003 finding in Goodridge v. Dept of Public Health wrote, “As both Perez and Loving makes clear, the right to marry means little if it does not include the right to marry the person of one’s choice … in this case, as in Perez and Loving, a statue deprives individuals of access to an institution of marriage – because of a single trait – skin color in Perez and Loving, sexual orientation here. As it did in Perez and Loving, history must yield to a more fully developed understanding of the invidious quality of the discrimination.<br>  The question now before us is whether the current ban on gay marriage qualifies as invidious discrimination. In his dissent, Justice Scalia illustrates the invidious discrimination that has so invaded U.S. culture that a Supreme Court Justice feels it appropriate to print and publish his anti-gay opinion as a part of our nation’s most sacred judicial proceedings. “I had thought one could consider certain conduct reprehensible -- murder, for example, or polygamy, or cruelty to animals -- and could exhibit even ‘animus' toward such conduct. Surely that is the only sort of ‘animus' at issue here: moral disapproval of homosexual conduct, the same sort of moral disapproval that produced the centuries-old criminal laws that we held constitutional in Bowers.” Bowers, of course, was overturned precisely because it was a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. The justice’s comparison between consensual adult intimacy and “cruelty” or murder fairly clearly illustrates invidious discrimination.<br>  <br>  We know from McCleskey v. Kemp (481 U.S. 279; 1987) that those who allege an equal protection violation have the burden of proving “the existence of purposeful discrimination.” Given the history of American culture with regard to the homosexual community, it should seem obvious that there is a clear cultural bias against gays. Their long exclusion from military service, only partially mitigated by President Clinton’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell Policy,” the Bowers and Lawrence cases which show unequal enforcement of sodomy laws against gays and the plethora of hate crimes including the highly publicized October 1998 murder of 21-year-old college student Matthew Shepard in an anti-gay hate crime in Wyoming.<br>  <br>  So far the justifications for excluding homosexuals from the protected class of suspect category have been due to their per capita income and their ability to be “discrete,” i.e., to blend into society. Duncan reasons in Notre Dame Law that gays have not proven their case that they have been economically impoverished by discrimination. J. Ely in Democracy and Distrust and Sunstein in Homosexuality and the Constitution argue that because homosexuals have the option of obscuring their membership in a category of invidious discrimination, they are often anonymous.<br>  <br>  The Constitution’s original writing on discrimination did not comment on economic advantages. It commented on the intangible, and more significant attribute of being singled out of the group. Justice Warren noted in Brown, “To separate them from others of similar qualifications generates a feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone.” Gays have a right to Equal Protection under the law not to be singled out in a way that generates a feeling of inferiority. There is no justification other than invidious discrimination to deny them the right to marry.|`|GU1i931Xaa	I would say not. Abortion is always going to be a touchy issue, where every case needs to be considered individually, but I can say with no grey areas that I think outlawing gay marriage is disgusting. Essentially, they're denying two people who love each other the chance to be married. How is that freedom?
S5H0NmEWaa	Assuming that you are talking about a probationary period with a new employer, then the answer is almost certainly yes, you will be paid.<br>  <br>  A probationary period of, say, ten weeks simply means that during or at the end of the ten weeks (usually at the end you will have a probationary review with your manager) they can ask you to leave, or you can leave, without the full notice period if you aren't working well in the new job. In most cases it's simply a formality to allow a little flexibility - taking on a new permanent job is a big commitment (although it's also a prize worth having at the moment).<br>  <br>  Whether you get a reference after the probation period would depend on your conduct and how well-disposed your employer felt towards you. If you did really badly and, at the end of the probation period, told them to stick their job up their a****, then they would probably not wish to give you a glowing reference. If you reach a mutual agreement that the job isn't for you, and explain your reasons in a sensible and respectful way which makes sense, then they would have no reason to give you a bad reference. (Having said that, if they hated you they wouldn't want to scupper your chances of getting a different job by providing a bad reference, but that's another matter...!)<br>  <br>  Having said all that you haven't given much detail, so you must check your contract, or ask your prospective employer if you haven't yet got one. Rules on probationary periods are set by individual employers so terms and conditions could vary widely depending on who you work for.|`|MTF0Rz90aa	During a probation period (Typically 6 months) you are entitled to full employment rights (Leave/sick leave/pay etc) and at the end of the probation period you should be offered a full time contract. You can leave any time during either the probation period or after the completion of the probation period.<br>  It is not unheard of some employers to offer a 6 month probation period and then at the end of the 6 months to say that they are unsure about offering a full time contact but they are ready to offer a further 6 month probation period. This is illegal and after a 6 month probation you will automatically get full time terms and conditions of employment. Please also bear in mind that the in the UK you need to work for a company for a full 12 months to get "Protected employment status" in law.<br>  Ja.

c6ebe357519ace6e71836544a66fad55aa	Hola y saludos desde la isla del encanto Puerto Rico!<br>  <br>  Gobierno Socialista<br>  <br>  Socialismo, término que, desde principios del siglo XIX, designa aquellas teorías y acciones políticas que defienden un sistema económico y político basado en la socialización de los sistemas de producción y en el control estatal (parcial o completo) de los sectores económicos, lo que se oponía frontalmente a los principios del capitalismo. Aunque el objetivo final de los socialistas era establecer una sociedad comunista o sin clases, se han centrado cada vez más en reformas sociales realizadas en el seno del capitalismo. A medida que el movimiento evolucionó y creció, el concepto de socialismo fue adquiriendo diversos significados en función del lugar y la época donde arraigara.<br>  <br>  Si bien sus inicios se remontan a la época de la Revolución Francesa y los discursos de Fran?ois N?el Babeuf, el término comenzó a ser utilizado de forma habitual en la primera mitad del siglo XIX por los intelectuales radicales, que se consideraban los verdaderos herederos de la Ilustración tras comprobar los efectos sociales que trajo consigo la Revolución Industrial. Entre sus primeros teóricos se encontraban el aristócrata francés conde de Saint-Simon, Charles Fourier y el empresario británico y doctrinario utópico Robert Owen. Como otros pensadores, se oponían al capitalismo por razones éticas y prácticas. Según ellos, el capitalismo constituía una injusticia: explotaba a los trabajadores, los degradaba, transformándolos en máquinas o bestias, y permitía a los ricos incrementar sus rentas y fortunas aún más mientras los trabajadores se hundían en la miseria. Mantenían también que el capitalismo era un sistema ineficaz e irracional para desarrollar las fuerzas productivas de la sociedad, que atravesaba crisis cíclicas causadas por periodos de superproducción o escasez de consumo, no proporcionaba trabajo a toda la población (con lo que permitía que los recursos humanos no fueran aprovechados o quedaran infrautilizados) y generaba lujos, en vez de satisfacer necesidades. El socialismo suponía una reacción al extremado valor que el liberalismo concedía a los logros individuales y a los derechos privados, a expensas del bienestar colectivo.<br>  <br>  Sin embargo, era también un descendiente directo de los ideales del liberalismo político y económico. Los socialistas compartían con los liberales el compromiso con la idea de progreso y la abolición de los privilegios aristocráticos aunque, a diferencia de ellos, denunciaban al liberalismo por considerarlo una fachada tras la que la avaricia capitalista podía florecer sin obstáculos.|`|2004f423550077cda336d6a901880621aa	Existen las mismas libertades que en cualquier lado, solo que hay justicia social e igualda por medio de varios mecanismos:<br>  <br>  - No hay propiedad privada, por lo que el dinero generado se va al pueblo y no a los acaudalados bolsillos de los capitalistas obesos y millonarios<br>  <br>  - Al  no haber propiedad privada, todos gozan de los beneficios de las empresas propiedad de ellos mismos manejadas a travez de inversion gubernamental<br>  <br>  - Abolicion de las clases sociales dandonos igualdad a todos y los mismos privilegios y obligaciones por igual<br>  <br>  - Sin clases sociales se evita la violencia y la inseguridad, propiciando un ambiente de paz y justicia social<br>  <br>  - Ser autosuficientes en cuanto a recursos y solamente explotar nuestra propia tierra para obtener nuestros propios insumos para nuestra propia gente, sin comprar a capitalistas extranjeros<br>  <br>  - Al no comprar al extranjero nos quedamos con el dinero en el mismo pais para asi reinviertirlo con co-nacionales en mas empresas que darian empleo al mas pobre y necesitado<br>  <br>  - Al dar empleo a todos, cada quien produciria lo que luego el gobierno le regresa en subsidios y pensiones deacuerdo a lo que trabaje y su familia<br>  <br>  - El dinero pierde la importancia que le dan en el capitalismo, por lo tanto todos somos iguales y nadie esclaviza, mata o roba a nadie mas por el inmundo dinero.<br>  <br>  Socialismo o Muerte !!|`|BWgwcpLoaa	fundamentalmente es una forma que maneja la propiedad pùblica sobre los medios de producciòn, en la filosofìa comunista, el que se encarga de otorgar a cada quien segùn su necesidad, ya a cada cual segùn su capacidad, considero que es una de las formas històricamente màs avanzadas de organizaciòn social, desde el punto de vista de la convivencia humana y requiere de integrantes superiores en cuanto a convicciòn polìtica, valores y solidadridad humana<br>  <br>  los ciudadanos deben propiciar el alto nivel de producciòn, de tipo racional, capacitarse, trabajar en bien de todos y promover la solidadridad humana para enfrentar los problemas tanto a nivel individual como social

We must not stay quiet...we must speak out and loudly to anyone who will listen.<br>  <br>  It is true however, that the real true issues why our country's economy are in decline have been brought to us by both Republicans and a good chunk of Democrats as well.  Case in point  is watch how many democrats are going to oppose obama when he tries to raise taxes on the rich...watch how many times you will hear even democrats talking about how thats punishing the rich.

Its a psychological certainty that the Brit police use methods of the mind to perpetuate crime. They feed a load of bullshit to the general public about wanting to stop crime ect ect in fact they need and produce criminals by getting them into the penal justice system as early as they can? Its a method parralell to the Americanof polarisation. i.e. declaring a person as Bi- polar disordered. Its deep and never ending subject.

Anyway the thing is my understanding is that the U.K. was a NANNY State. The difference is that the people of the U.K. let it fall in to the State it is in. They never tried to argue with any of it. They wanted most of what they got, they just didn't realize how exaggerated things would get. In that case it can't be a Police State, because it is what the people requested.

QQsIPlV2aa	It tickles me when when I see the cars the manufacturers are showing the Public for 2009-2010 seasons!  Who can afford them, OH! I forgot! the CEO's who have just got bailed out!! What are these guys going to do when the oil runs dry? I think I will start investing in a horse and buggy! The Amish have the right idea, and they aren't hurting any!  As far as public transportation goes, we all used to travel by train. or bus. They have the lines to run the trains on, do we HAVE to have bullet trains to get around in?  Why is speed so necessary? Maybe we would all be a lot healthier if we used bicycles to go to work! We would have cleaner air to breathe and a lot less noisier! Countries should become self sufficient for the most part. Keep our noses out of other peoples affairs. If they want to argue and fight each other within their borders, let them do so, cos they don't want US interferring! They have their own way of life, as we do, and NOTHING will ever change that! If they want to ride camels, so be it, the more techology we put in their hands, the more we are putting ourselves and the whole world in danger of extinction!|`|1f5996779efb6a4589f7767428fbc708aa	Only to save massive unemployment.|`|URZeQfQCaa	i say **** em, they never did me any favours. all i get from cars is a bad chest from inhaling the fumes.|`|jMkWH4MGaa	I'd argue that public transport probably improves when people use cars because it means less people are crammed in like sardines onto trains and buses. <br>  <br>  You say that cars are noisy, cause accidents and pollution and disturb pedestrians and cyclists. Yet trains and buses give out much more pollution and you often see buses with just 1 passenger on. I'd also argue that buses are much more of a menace to cyclists than cars. <br>  <br>  Also don't you recall Paddington and the numerous other serious train acccidents over the last decade and a half or so? My sister was working in London at the time and missed catching that very train by 5 minutes so she may not have been alive today had she been on it.<br>  <br>  Having said all that I actually agree with you that our taxes should not go to bail out car manufacturers in this country (what little we have left of them) or any private company for that matter including those operating train and bus services. <br>  <br>  The last time I checked the eurozone had a lot higher interest rates than the UK and US and that is what is killing a lot of eurozone countries. <br>  <br>  If you think things are bad here then just be glad we were not in the euro during this economic downturn because it would have been a heck of a lot worse not having control of your own currency and being able to adjust interest rates to suit our unique economy. <br>  <br>  We would have been suffering the same fate as Spain, Italy and Greece had we been in the failed euro. Over here its not as if we have an auto industry to bail out like they have in the US with GM, Ford and Crysler.<br>  <br>  I agree with you about the government having lost all authority to govern. Hopefully the EU will allow us to have an election and kick the present lot out including Gordon "Boom and Bust" Brown, but they could just abolish our parliament altogether now we have been signed away with the Lisbon Treaty.|`|JLPoeGdqaa	because the world sort of revolves around the automobile industry<br>  <br>  and we have used them for so long its hard to go back to the horse and carriage|`|c9c21b842bc0967b25ee1f5620157edfaa	It shouldn't, but the Democrats are in control and they want to make the unions happy.

AA11632370	I got the following from internet search. I have my suspicion that it was masterminded by the power who thought that we must kill two birds with one stone. This can be either the ISI of Pakistan or RAW of India. Other than these two we can not see the CIA of America doing these types of nasty dealings when they are already into lots of trouble of their own making. This is my personal view and we hope that the enquiry commissions already working to unearth the motives and the perpetrators would enlighten us with their findings soon.<br>  <br>  --<br>  <br>  Conspiracy theory in BDR mutiny<br>  <br>  Dhaka: As the full horrors of Bangladesh Rifles mutiny unravel, a conspiracy theory is gradually taking shape with survivors and security analysts saying it was a “planned killing” aimed at “crippling” the army and BDR in a country that has just returned to democracy.<br>  <br>  “It was a planned killing,” Army doctor Lt. Col. Abdus Salam, who survived the massacre, told reporters at the Army headquarters at a special briefing. He also asserted that only a section of the rebel soldiers was involved in the massacre.<br>  <br>  “Never ... definitely not all of them [the rebels] were culprits. Many BDR soldiers tried to protect us [Army officers serving in BDR] risking their own lives,” he said. The 33-hour mutiny is feared to have claimed the lives of at least 135 officers.<br>  <br>  Most security analysts, including former chiefs and Generals in unison also declined to call the massacre inside BDR headquarters “a mere mutiny”, putting their weight behind the growing fears about a conspiracy.<br>  <br>  The analysts feared that a particular quarter chalked out the plan to kill all senior Army officers serving in the BDR as they gathered at the paramilitary force’s headquarters to celebrate the annual BDR Week. — PTI

fAaLjlI0aa	This varies by jurisdiction, but the general answer is, yes... to an extent. They can search outer garments for weapons if there is a reasonable cause for suspicion. Any more intimate searching will generally require a female officer. Strip searches in particular.|`|AA11494150	We are taught to search males and females exactly the same way.

Usually a male officer will wait on a female officer if one is available.  There is no law and females do not have special rights not to be searched.  Because of the fear of getting sued and having his whole career thrown out the door because some money hungry tramp who wants money, there are different alternatives the male officer can practice to avoid a law suit.  Doing the Pat down in front of the dash cam, having several other unbiased witnesses present, or possibly having a female officer to do the search (if available which is prob not likely in small depts).  Its sad really because officers put thier life on the line to serve the citizens of their city/town/county/state and they have to worry about getting sued in every move they make.  Hence why soooo many officers get killed because they second guess their survival response because if they arent half dead and shot three times then they are getting sued because the perp was shot and lost his finger!!  SAD SAD SAD!!!!  Women kill, old people kill, and so will everyone else!|`|hDOBfBZeaa	Yes. A male officer can search a female subject without the presence of a female officer the same way a male can search another male. Searches are done for contraband / weapons with consent, with a warrant or incident to arrest.The female officer being present or conducting a search is usually there for the protection of the officer / department.|`|XLSfTnISaa	Yes. A pat down for weapons is a must, regardless of gender.  A male officer isn't NOT going to pat down a female just because another officer is not present. Its a safety issue.|`|Sbo3IqLlaa	It all depends on where you live. But yeah, they could probably search you, they just can't try anything sexual.|`|FgNoD8Qkaa	He can pad her down with the back of his hands.(Opposite side of the palm). He can't in anyway feel for anything if thats what your asking|`|AA11203798	depends how liberal the station commander is!!
sUSfQ9AZaa	It may be the officer wanted to check on you, rather than write you a ticket. That was just a reason to stop you to actually check you for other things like, valid drivers license, outstanding warrants, or drugs and alcohol in the car.<br>  <br>  Once he checked you, and you were ok, he just decided to let you go. Lot of times when you are stopped for minor things, it is just for them to dig and see if they can find major things. If they can't, then the officer really does not want to deal with it.|`|zokJMPBAaa	yes, faulty maintenance of your car|`|VoQN7ADvaa	Not necessarily. A lot of times, they'll let you off with a written warning and simply tell you to get it fixed. My friend had one of his headlights busted out and got pulled over 8 times in a 2 month period for having only one headlight. Each time, he got a written warning.|`|AA10850613	Can you: yes.<br>  Should you: Maybe|`|ZmuxaJYpaa	yes
B1mEwSXWaa	My dear Pete...<br>  <br>  Those are really some ****stupid replies...I have to agree with you !!! I don't know, why people answer to something they have absolutely NO knowledge about.....Oh well....<br>  <br>  However...to your issue...Since it's a "renewal", one has to assume, that the person had a british passport before and IS a british citizen...(not like above, where they were thinking....one applies for something like "asylum"....) That's a whole different thing and yes...on visa's and permits to stay in a "foreign" country, they do NOT wish to"import criminals"...-smile-<br>  <br>  But, if the person IS already a british citizen and simply wishes to renew, it would NOT matter, if any charges are against him/her !!! Sure, the passport WILL BE RENEWED !!!#<br>  <br>  As a matter of fact, my passport expired while I was serving a sentence and they even renewed it in prison ! What do you think they should "do" with all the people, who became "culpable"??? Put them on a "separate island" for "Stateless criminals"?-ha-ha-ha-ha- Our justice system doesn't go "THAT FAR"...Sure, she'll get a renewal, Pete !!<br>  <br>  Send you all my bets wishes and all my love..your friend....Annette***|`|34f58d193a1c27340e8401a3848c8c53aa	It should have been. It would look like they are trying to flee the country. It could be the fact that the issuing state didn't want to pay for the charges to expedite them back for it.|`|Sbo3IqLlaa	Thats confusing, but yeah, they can be denied. They probably wouldn't want someone like that in there country.

wg78UkxFaa	If there were a ban on smoking then cigarettes would be like street drugs, they would be sold on the black market.  People would be paying a high price just to be able to get them, because there are those people that are hooked on them.  <br>  <br>  So there would be those people dealing cigarettes just like there are people dealing drugs, it would become just as bad as the drug trade in some ways.<br>  <br>  Yes, it would be better for people if no one smoked, but it would just create another black market of sorts.  So we would have people going to prison for selling cigarettes as well as drugs, it would be an even worse mess since we already have enough people going to prisons as it is.<br>  <br>  BTW:  With all the junk that's in our air from cars and the major industries  from foreign countries were still going to become sick.   It was determined that the air pollution from China is entering into our country, it is starting to enter into California already.  So we are not going to get totally healthy from people just quitting smoking.  We'd have to stop all the  other pollution from other things as well to have that happen.  Let's all be real just stopping smoking won't make it all better.  It won't make all lung disease go away, if only it were that simple!!|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	Public House (pubs) closure springs to mind.|`|27ca791e37b603a94b96a9f5e401b245aa	Although we know smoking is bad for health it is nevertheless a mean of exit from isolation for many people. Smoker is never alone was the message of one of commercials promoting one of the best known trade marks in the tobacco industry !|`|bc830b1601cd7380ec1f17c83fef3a4eaa	Society would be affected because it would lessen the strain it puts on our medical resources. Less people would be contracting lung cancer and emphysema. Less would be getting bronchitis on an annual basis. That means less trips to the doctor and hospital. That means less money spent by Medicaid and Medicare. That means more money for other programs and more medical resources to fight other diseases.|`|h2LmAM0Baa	People would be healthier, so healthcare would be cheaper. Our air would be cleaner. There would be trees where there are now tobacco farms. We wouldnt see disgusting cigarette butts everywhere. Smokers would be more accurately called junkies buying their butts from a dealer. Wouldnt have those taxes coming in, but healthcare would be cheaper after awhile. There'd be fewer forest fires. Fewer kids with asthma because of their abusive parents. Let's be honest though, parents who would smoke around their kids today are going to have unhealthy kids no matter what, if they dont care they dont care.|`|k5P8XK62aa	It would result in more people using or trading in contraband than at any time since the 21st amendment put an end to the prohibition of alcohol, and I dare say organized crime would rise to levels not seen since the days of Al Capone.|`|GHPZlhAwaa	As the government, Federal, state and local governments gain a large % of their operating funds through SIN TAXES, most governments would go bankrupt, that is, those that aren't already by ludicrous spending.<br>  <br>  whale|`|jPYCrstVaa	People would become healthier, and doctor visits would go way down, (save money).. loss of huge tax dollars on SIN taxes (lose money) MANY CRABBY PEOPLE FOR A YEAR OR SO!|`|F1igZsMXaa	if they banned smoking, i would initiate a ban on them living. my campaign would be very aggressive.

IW3jmnKbaa	There is no justice in Amerika.Yesterday, a judge in Californistan sent attorney Richard Fine to jail,without bail, or a court date. Just for background sake, Richard Fine has some Superior court judges in serious trouble using their own court records to nail them for conflict of interest in many cases they presided over, and it was one of those judges that sent him to jail, another conflict,since that judge should have dismissed himself from that case.

No one should have to spend time in jail waiting on someone else to prove their case.|`|xusxs5rcaa	I feel that justice delayed is absolutely justice denied. I was assaulted 17 mo ago by a co-worker. He is 6' and 280-300lbs. I'm 5'3" and 140. We both worked at the local Country Club/ Golf Course. I was attacked three times on the course and three more times in front of our supervisor and mechanic. On the first four attacks he mostly threw me into service vehicles or slammed my head into the ground. The fifth attack he threw me down and cut me above the eye. The final attack he kicked me in the ribs. He was bound over on four felonies. The case was continued three times before finally being heard. His attorney claimed he had a good job and a felony would cause him to lose it. He plead to one count of misdemeanor assault w/deadly weapon and was ordered to serve 90 days and pay restitution. He did less than 60 and appealed the restitution order. Four continuances and five months later he was again ordered to pay restitution. In the year that had passed it went from $6000 to over $17000. I owe $14000 just to the doctors and therapist. He has paid around $750 so far but not a cent has come my way. His PO says he lost his job and can only pay $50/mo. They want to give me half and keep the other half. Without interest, it will take him 58 yrs and 8 mo to pay his restitution. The probation dept told me that I did have $75 owed to me but a clerical error gave it all to the probation dept. Supposedly, nothing can be done to rectify the error. He signed his Harley over to his father and still lives at home at 44 years old. His life hasn't been affected a bit save for the 60 he did in county jail. I have had to deal with what happened every day for the past 17 mo. I've been evicted and, even though I finally landed a good job, $275-$300/wk for a hotel will still leave me barely surviving until I can save enough to rent a new place. Three months of delays to get to trial, five months of delays after his release, the probation departments indifference and the total disregard for the new provisions in the victims bill of rights pertaining to restitution. From where I sit, justice delayed is, in my case, no justice at all.|`|ge5x9NHxaa	Justice delayed is not justice denied.  Before justice is done, process has to be followed.  Evidences has to be gathered in order to prove the case for  justice beyond reason doubt.  During these process justice has only be delayed and not denied.

cWuumdy7aa	Andhra Pradesh is the fifth largest state in India, both in area and population. <br>  <br>  Location <br>  <br>  It is bounded by Tamil Nadu, Orissa, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka and the Bay of Bengal.( with 23 Districts)<br>  <br>  Geography <br>  <br>  The northern area of AP is mountainous. The highest peak Mahendragiri rises 1500 m (4920 ft.) above the sea level. The climate is generally hot and humid. Annual rainfall: 125cm. The Krishna and the Godavari are the major river systems in the state. <br>  <br>  On Nov.1, 1956 in accordance with the recommendations of the State Reorganization Commission, the Andhra State was enlarged by the addition of nine districts formerly in the Nizam’s Domination. Hyderabad, the former capital of the Nizam, was made the capital of the enlarged Andhra State.<br>  <br>  History <br>  <br>  Centuries ago, Andhra Pradesh was a major Buddhist center and part of Emperor Ashoka's sprawling kingdom.  Not surprisingly, traces of early Buddhist influence are still visible in several places in and around the state.  After the death of Emperor Ashoka, the Satavahanas established their kingdom in this region. <br>  <br>  During the 7th century, the Chalukyas held sway over Andhra Pradesh until the 10th century, when the Cholas seized power.  In the 14th century, Muslim power reached this southern state and for centuries ruled over this princely state and finally was taken over by a General of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb in 1713.  The successors of the General, known as Nizams, ruled the state till Indian Independence. <br>  <br>  Successive dynasties from the Ikshvakus, Pallavas, Chalukyas, Kakatiyas, Vijayanagaram kings, Qutb Shahis, Mughals and the Asaf Jahis, have contributed significantly to the State's rich cultural tapestry and have left behind a heritage studded with spectacular monuments, temples, mosques, palaces all vibrant with arts, crafts, dance and literature. <br>  <br>  Andhra Pradesh was constituted as a separate State on October 1, 1953 on the partition of Madras Presidency and consisted of the undisputed Telugu-speaking area of that State.  On November 1, 1956, this region was expanded with the Telengana area of the former Hyderabad State, comprising the districts of Hyderabad, Medak, Nizamabad, Karimnagar, Warrangal, Khammam, Nalgonda, and Mahaboobnagar, parts of Adilabad district, and some taluks of the Raichur, Gulbarga and Bidar districts, and some revenue circles of the Nanded district. <br>  <br>  On April 1, 1960, 573.43 sq km (221.4 sq miles) in the Chingleput and Salem districts of Madras were transferred to Andhra Pradesh in exchange for 1062 sq km (410 sq miles) from Chittoor district. The district of Prakasam was formed on February 2, 1970. Hyderabad was split into two districts on August 15, 1978. A new district, Vizianagaram, was formed in 1979.|`|AQrjyQZzaa	26|`|e5F9zjtcaa	there are 23 districts in Andhrapradesh.

1KGXts5Daa	The Patriot Act: An act to deter and punish terrorist acts in the United States and around the world, to enhance law enforcement investigatory tools, and for other purposes.  (H. R. 3162 IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES October 24, 2001)  <a href="http://epic.org/privacy/terrorism/hr3162.html" rel="nofollow">http://epic.org/privacy/terrorism/hr3162...</a><br>  <br>  On October 26, 2001, President Bush signed the Patriot Act  into law.  The bill is 342 pages long and makes changes, some large and some small, to over 15 different statutes.<br>  <br>  The civil liberties of ordinary Americans have taken a tremendous blow with this law, especially the right to privacy in our online communications and activities.  <a href="http://w2.eff.org/Privacy/Surveillance/Terrorism/20011031_eff_usa_patriot_analysis.php" rel="nofollow">http://w2.eff.org/Privacy/Surveillance/T...</a><br>  <br>  The Act gives federal officials greater authority to track and intercept communications, both for law enforcement and foreign intelligence gathering purposes. It vests the Secretary of the Treasury with regulatory powers to combat corruption of U.S. financial institutions for foreign money laundering purposes. <br>  <br>  It seeks to further close our borders to foreign terrorists and to detain and remove those within our borders. It creates new crimes, new penalties, and new procedural efficiencies for use against domestic and international terrorists. <br>  <br>  Although it is not without safeguards, critics contend some of its provisions go too far. Although it grants many of the enhancements sought by the Department of Justice, others are concerned that it does not go far enough.|`|84H5R5ywaa	DEFINITION - The Patriot Act (the full name is the USA Patriot Act, or "Uniting and Strengthening America Act by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001") was enacted by the U.S. Congress on October 26, 2001, at the request of President George Bush in response to the terrorist acts of September 11. It gives controversial new powers to the Justice Department in terms of domestic and international surveillance of American citizens and others within its jurisdiction. According to its sponsors, the Act was needed to address a situation that had not existed before - the presence of terrorists within national borders - and the need to apprehend and prosecute them, hopefully before rather than after they acted. Opponents of the Act, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the American Civil Liberties Union, say that the Act has undone previous checks on civil liberty abuses of the past and unnecessarily endangers privacy and discourages free speech.<br>  <br>  Among the Act's provisions, flowing out of the government's ability to legally tap telephone lines in certain cases, is the ability to intercept Internet messages through its Carnivore program. Theoretically, the government has the ability to intercept all messages that are "relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation," a lower standard than the previous one in which a crime had to have been committed. The Act allows the guidelines to apply to all surveillance cases, not just those of suspected terrorists.<br>  <br>  Some opponents allege that the Act was on the drawing boards prior to September 11. Many parties agree that the Act was rushed through Congress with a minimum of study and discussion. In addition to the surveillance provisions, the Act includes sections related to money-laundering and immigration and also contains a section that condemns discrimination against Muslims and Arab-Americans.|`|jPYCrstVaa	to be simply put, it takes away your your civil rights if you are under investigation of being a terrorist. they can imprison you indefinetly, and arrest you for no reason. tap your phone.. etc..its actually pretty scary stuff.|`|70e9d9eee37ee3f1f4008f4ae6b92dc8aa	It really makes more sense to read it yourself rather than have someone explain it...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_PATRIOT_Act" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_PATRIOT...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.lifescript.com/Soul/Self/Growth/USA_Patriot_Act_Pros_And_Cons.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.lifescript.com/Soul/Self/Grow...</a>

She also had to be in quarantine  upon entering the country. <br>  <br>  Make sure when you get ready for the military to come move your things they are all in 1 place since you will be staying with people and probably storing some things. They will only move you from 1 location.<br>  <br>  Just remember military moves are generally only as stressful as you make them. Just utilize all the resources available to you.

They will tell you what your weight allowance is (and it isn't much...but the military will store anything you can't/aren't bringing with you), what items can and can't go (firearms are not allowed, etc) and when to set up the pack outs, etc.  Don't be afraid to ask tons of questions..keep a list of them in a notebook and write down all the answers as well as the name of the person who gave them to you.<br>  <br>  As for the animals, base housing will only allow two pets max and in Japan, there are types of housing (basically apartment buildings called Towers) that are pet free.  Additionally, if you live off base, very few Japanese landlords will let you have that many animals.  You would have to pay the costs of transporting the animals yourself and many airlines have limited times of year for moving animals.

AA10451400	I received my B.A. and after endless job searching I decided to  join the Army active duty for 4 years at the age of 27.  I initially joined to pay back my college loans and to receive tuition assistance for my masters.  Of course I'm patriotic and wanted to serve my country but for the most part it was to "do" something with my life, gain more confidence, be a strongER more independent woman and be proud of myself for all my accomplishments.  I enlisted as a specialist, E4, Firefighter and only 2 years of service I was promoted to Sergeant.  Joining the Army was the best decision I ever made to better myself and now I still have 7 months in the IRR (inactive ready reserve) but am a civilian firefighter on a military installation making great money and doing what I love.  I am now 34.<br>  My advice to you, don't sign anything until you get what YOU want in your contract.  The Army will bend over backwards for you so make sure you get everything you want.  That means the job you want, your deserving rank, GI Bill or College Loan Repayment Program, special schooling and duty locations.  Although duty locations, once you finished boot camp and AIT, are not always want you want because of your job or MOS.  Fore example:  as a firefighter I was only able to go to Ft. Rucker, AL, Ft. Wainwright, AK and Goodfellow AFB, TX as duty locations because those were the only places for Army firefighters.  Make sure you do your homework and research all your options.  If you don't want to be deployed over-seas I hightly suggest to join active duty rather than reserves or guard.  There's always the chance of being sent "somewhere" regardless of your enlistment but the chances are less in active duty Army.  Again, it depends on your MOS.  By the way, boot camp is not that bad.  Just do what you're told and don't draw attention to yourself.  Don't be a loud mouth know-it-all.  The most difficult part of basic training is dealing with 50 other women in the same bay sharing a bathroom of 6 showers and toilets.  Putting up with different women from all walks of life, parts of the country, ages and attitudes.  In the end, YOU need to make the decision not your parents who lived off their trust fund of your friends who work at McD's.  It's your life and your future.  Do what's best for you.  Be all that you can be.  Good luck kid.|`|AA11458153	If your young enough, I would suggest ROTC in college. Of course I'm not a female, but I do share a very high interest in the military. I can only guess some hippie is going to say dont join, but dont listen to them, hippies smell and dont go to school- they dont know anything. I hope you continue your quest to join the army|`|AA11943596	OK YOUNG LADY.. Joining any branch of the armed service is good if for the right reason..To tick someone off (NO) To get out of school (NO).. To have my friends look up to me (NO).. To try and make something out of myself,( YES) Service life for both men and ladys is just what you want it to be.. It can be so hard you cant stand it, or so easy you love it..You'll have the chance to get all the schooling you'll ever need along with on the job training.. uncle sam will pay for all of it.. I just told this to someone else.about bootcamp..,1000's have done it before you with out probluns so why cant you..Dont worry you'll do just fine..... I put over 20 in the Navy and loved every minute, except missing my wife...By the way my retirement pay, Well you would need to retire from two 20 year jobs to match itt..

1cb630e22cf712d81a067ddde9ea384caa	Why you believe what you believe<br>  <br>  Experts on the human mind say that humans are convinced to believe things for four principal reasons:<br>  <br>  1. You tend to believe most strongly that which you hear first.<br>  <br>  2. If you change, it will most likely be to that which you hear repeated many times.<br>  <br>  3. You next tend to believe that which you want to believe or that which fits your already conceived ideas or notions.<br>  <br>  4. Lastly, humans are least likely to believe that which is logical and makes sense, especially if it contradicts what they hear most!<br>  <br>  Interesting, isn’t it? Since the truth serves no one’s purpose and is seldom repeated, most people are left believing only that which serves someone’s purpose. By definition, that means they are left believing a lie. Unless you understand this and guard against it, you will be endlessly confused for most of your life. <br>  <br>  And just to keep you happy, hear for your entertainment is <br>  <br>  The biggest conspiracy theory of them all<br>  <br>  <br>  The biggest conspiracy theory is that 19 Arabs, who had been under surveillance, conspired together, walked onto four commercial aircraft without being detected, and without having their names appear on a passenger list. Then that they could overcome over 250 people with plastic box-cutters. And not only that, but with no previous experience of flying large jets, they could navigate from 30,000 feet and hit three out of four targets precisely, meantime conducting flying manoeuvres that fighter pilots would find difficult. Then, the amazing thing is that 7 of them survived the events and are known to be alive today.<br>  Also for the first time ever in history, three, not two, but three steel framed buildings collapsed as a result of fire which could not possibly have burned hot enough to melt steel, and caused the buildings not to topple over, as one might expect, or to fall a little at a time, but to fall within their own footprint at the speed of gravity. And one of those buildings (WTC7) was not even hit by a plane.<br>  Not only that, but the four aircraft disappeared completely without a trace of their 16 large engines, or any of the black boxes. This has also never before happened in history.<br>  <br>  <br>  This theory is so amazingly full of holes that it is impossible for any sane thinking person to believe, yet that is what the official 9/11 commission report.says.<br>  <br>  <br>  "We'll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the American public believes is false."<br>  -- William Casey, CIA Director (from first staff meeting, 1981)|`|4940e80bc9dc7c02af4ee0f3ffb61d31aa	a good conspiracy can never be proven as fact. with all the media surrounding us, the government has pounded into our heads that it couldn't have been us. thats just absured, right? well, people have done unthinkable things for money and power.

VnGu66Lnaa	nei paesi che hanno rapporto di reciprocita' con l'Italia su temi fiscali,se paghi le tasse dove risiedi non le paghi in Italia.Purche non hai in Italia i tuoi interessi prevalenti e sei iscritto all'AIRE (anagrafe Italiani Residenti all'Estero).Che non ti da nulla anzi ti leva,ma ti certifica come residente all'estero.La residenza all'estero si ottiene con un regolare permesso di lavoro,sia esso dipendente che autonomo e devi dimostrare di trascorrere la maggior parte del tuo tempo in uno stato estero.Purtroppo i soliti furbi hanno cercato di strumentalizzare a proprio vantaggio questo discorso,(Pavarotti docet,e non soltanto) cercando di evitare laiertassazione Italiana con una residenza estera di comodo.E lo stato cerca di proteggere i suoi interessi.Non ci trovo nulla di strano.Se proprio non vuoi avere nulla a che fare con il tuo paese natale e ti ti piace tanto la Tequila,cerca di ottenere la cittadinanza Messicana ed il problema e' risolto.Io non mi lamenterei troppo dell'Italia,avendo una certa conoscenza di paesi diversi piu' o meno evoluti.Abbiamo una delle assistenze sanitarie piu' belle del mondo,e se una buona parte dello stanziamento non andasse perso per strada potrebbe sicuramente essere il migliore,istruzione di base per tutti,gratis, che poi non funzioni a dovere e' un'altro problema,assistenze per gli anziani, assegni di solidarieta' per gli indigenti, anche non nativi,sicuramente si puo' far meglio.Ma dove pensi che lo stato debba prelevare le risorse? Tieni inoltre presente che quando vai a chiedere un intervento sanitario,anche del costo di diverse migliaia di Euro,non ti si chiede di certo di esibire la tua ultima dichiarazione dei redditi. Sopratutto se e' un intervento di urgenza. E questo e' un grosso errore secondo me.<br>  Sono stasto ricoverato d'urgenza a Miami per due notti in terapia intensiva per uno sbalzo di pressione, (230 la massima) e mi e' stato presentato un conto di 20,000.00 Us.$ (ho ancora la nota). Sono riusciti a togliermi solo 3,000.00 $ , quello che avevo in cash e che ho dovuto dare al momento del ricovero e poi sono scappato come un ladro.Ma il ladro in questo caso non ero io.Probabilmente non potrei piu' rientrare negli USA senza passare qualche giorno in un carcere locale,ma,non mi sembra una grande perdita.Il tuo caso,per poterlo commentare con proprieta' e non superficialita'tipo "governo ladro" dovrebbe essere piu' documentato. A proposito di Tremaglia, si e' trattato di un tragico errore che gli e' costato,oltre a perdere le elezioni,anche un bel pacco di Euro.Il mio voto gli e' costato per l'esattezza 1,200.00 E , cioe' l'80% del costo del biglietto aereo. Tanto erano sicuri di avere il voto favorevole deggli emigrati che,con il danaro pubblico,non hanno badato a spese. Adesso piangono ma, se fosse andato a loro vantaggio avrebbero perlomeno dedicato a Tremaglia almeno un francobollo se non addirittura il profilo su una moneta da due Euro. Se teniamo al nostro paese,collaboriamo a farlo stare in piedi, ..tutti, anche noi all'estero, se no, cambiamo passaporto.Io,con tutto l'amore per il mio paese l'ho considerato piu' volte e seriamente.|`|4MFEqeoaaa	io sono italiano all`estero ma non pago le tasse italiane|`|bBAAriY6aa	Paghi le tasse perchè la residenza ce l' hai ancora in Italia pur lavorando all'estero.<br>  poi non penso che in un anno prendi 3000 € lordi.<br>  ciao|`|jElJmx3jaa	Perchè la società è ridicola, basata su tristi mediocrità.|`|p8xVtoFraa	Come al solito l'Italia e' il paese dei balocchi !<br>  nn so cosa dirti,ma la cosa certa e' che in un sondaggio fatto in tutta l'Europa ,il nostro paese e' uno dei piu' rovinati dell'UE.mi spiace amico...ma e' cosi!|`|c4e7aa903fff003aa3241f81526e4813aa	Dovrebbero aumentarvele ulteriormente, voi che dopo aver sdegnosamente lasciato l'Italia avete anche mandato al governo una banda di mentecatti con il vostro voto consentitovi dal maledetto Tremaglia<br>  <br>  Bye|`|xEo1I42waa	se hai la residenza nello stato estero, a regola non dovresti pagarle...è un fatto strano|`|43a648b5d5144c285a815ac59a467869aa	io ho vissuto 2 anni in Spagna fino a 6 mesi fa e non ho pagato tasse italiane. strano.|`|6a95e90cf67f93e21906c661ca2863d6aa	anche io abito in belgio e questa di pagare le tasse mi é nuova ,in 12 anni non ho avuto mai richieste del genere ,e poi anche se fosse..................ma figurati se pago le tasse ad uno stato dove non risiedo e sopratutto non ottengo niente in cambio .Credo che tu abbia cattive informazioni oppure sei stato preso in un raggiro .Documentati bene <br>  ciaooooooooooooo|`|e12c67db8c244ff5b5e6be751e314998aa	Devi iscriverti all'AIRE (archivio italiani residenti all'estero), cosí perdi l'assistenza sanitaria ma non paghi piú le tasse.|`|ede6f6eae4d3e255d0776039414df9b7aa	La fiscalità italiana - giusta o sbagliata che sia - è chiara.<br>  <br>  Se hai la residenza all'estero NON paghi le tasse, se la conservi in Italia le paghi.<br>  Se hai conservato la residenza italiana pur lavorando all'estero (ognuno può avere o non avere motivi per farlo) e se sei già tassato all'estero, e le tasse applicateti all'estero sono superiori a quelle che pagheresti in Italia, il fisco italiano può chiederti NULLA. Se sono inferiori può chiederti la differenza.<br>  <br>  Poichè l'Italia è uno dei paesi con le + alte aliquote, quasi sempre all'estero paghi di meno di quanto pagheresti in Italia e l'Italia - questo bel paese - ti chiede la differenza.<br>  <br>  Ma la cosa non è vessativa: basta chiedere la residenza - anche solo per il periodo che ti interessa - all'estero ed ogni problema è risolto.

The problem is, you can only assign certain inmates to do these jobs.  Inmates are assigned different classifications.  You cannot put high risk inmates in shops with tools.  It's a security nightmare. You put staff at risk, as well as other inmates.  <br>  <br>  Confinement does one thing........it segregates the prisoner from the public.  That's the intention.  Making them work is good, if you can do so effectively.  If not , then lockdown is the best bet.

AA10881156	There are some factors to consider; your age when it was committed and how long ago was that (statute of limitations may come into play).<br>  <br>  In Illinois, 15 year olds can be tried as an adult (for non-violent crimes the court has to be petitioned to allow it).<br>  <br>  Here's an example: "...As a result of the case, Illinois state law was changed. Now a 12 year old cannot be charged as an adult. Prosecutors can seek to have a 13 year old charged with murder and tried as an adult. 15 year olds and up are automatically tried as adults in Illinois murder cases."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=news&id=3649075" rel="nofollow">http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|44b6eb8d0714d007115130c3b9057f5aaa	it all depends on the court system on an 18 year old. give or take a few months.  some times its stays on your adult record but its like a slap on the wrist.|`|RpH0i3c3aa	yes|`|AA11595346	Depends on the circumstances.  Were you almost 18, or were you 4?  Did you steal a piece of candy, or did you steal a car and take it across state lines?<br>  Regardless of your age at the time of the arrest or trial, if you committed a crime as a child, you can sometimes be charged as an adult, even if you are still not over 18.|`|Dgqvtvrmaa	You can be charged as an adult depending on the crime.  Once you turn 17 you are automatically charged as an adult.|`|a400efb33672011549b47bbb0d18ccc7aa	Sorry but yes honey, they can|`|0YixG5CAaa	No, they will try you based on the age of when the crime was committed.|`|2tYvZYKWaa	That answer is yes and no. <br>  <br>  If you committed a crime say, four years ago when you were seventeen - you're twenty-one now and  finally being charged with it - you must be charged according to the laws in practice *at the time you committed the crime.*<br>  <br>  However, you have to remember that depending on the crime itself (and your location/jurisdiction) you may or may not be charged as an adult. Some places see it fit to charge you as an adult at seventeen. Depending on the crime, some will even choose sixteen. <br>  <br>  If the laws have become more strict since the time you committed the crime, this is in your favor. However, if they have become more lax since then, not so much in your favor. <br>  <br>  Then there's the whole fact of evidence - some evidence might have been excluded had you been charged at the time you committed the crime because it might have been considered 'inflamatory' whereas today it might be used on a daily basis in the court system. <br>  <br>  The best thing to do is to compare the law and procedures used at the time the crime was committed and in today's court rooms. Also, any cases that were similar (or perhaps even exactly the same) which might help your case is always a bonus. (For example if someone was able to 'get off' because an eyewitness was unsure given the amount of time had lapsed, etc., etc. and your eyewitness is unsure, bringing up the other case might help yours.)<br>  <br>  Of course the best thing is to admit to what you've done and take responsibility for it. In my opinion that is where you can tell if someone is truly 'Sorry' or just looking out for their own skin.|`|bxTGSTF2aa	Every jurisdiction is different. I know if you are very close to turning 18 they can decide to try you as an adult. And the severity of the crime also goes into that decision.
VHnVBZhVaa	The problem you will have is that she does not appear to have broken a law.  It appears that the two never even met in person and were simply writing back and fourth.  What would be your grounds for suing her?  Your emails of these transactions will be beneficial to you in your divorce proceedings against your husband but I think that is all.  The cost to hire an attorney and attempt to pursue this other matter is going to be much more than any potential benefit.

PiOslkvHaa	It depends what state you are in.  In California, you may cash the check (it will be deducted from the 3 times salary).  But you must be able to prove that you did not receive the check within the allowed time.|`|u0IodZtYaa	If they pay you...you have to accept...you can't deny the check just to get more money in court...the court would throw the suit out before you made it to a jury.<br>  <br>  And the triple ot treble damages...not liquidated damages as they misquoted to you...have to be found by the jury...the jury can decide to give them to you or not...they are given when there is punishable damages...the job did something wrong.<br>  <br>  here they paid you 9 days after you were fired...I am not sure that is unreasonable...unless it can be shown that they withheld your check on purpose...but aren't many checks paid 2 weeks after the date of work...so it is possible....if you desire...consult an attorney in your area.|`|Lq0PvJ3haa	Usually, liquidated damages are something in a contract. check your employment contract. If you cash a check that is marked "for full satisfaction" or something similar, then that means you can't sue them for more. However you may reject their checks and still sue them in court, provided that you show actual damages (bills, costs, etc) Then the damages would be up to the judge or jury.
AA12041697	it will take 1-3 months to fill out the paperwork, get your police certificates (one needed from the federal level and one from the state level) and get your medical stuff in order.

In fact they are really like the Boy Scouts. In boot camp they ask you to do things. For example. In the Marines they yell "ATTEEEENNN-OIN!!!!" In the Coast Guard they say "Will you "PLEASE" stand at attention". And when you do the Coast Guard Drill Instructors will say "Oh thanks you so much.....Now go and eat some ice cream".
