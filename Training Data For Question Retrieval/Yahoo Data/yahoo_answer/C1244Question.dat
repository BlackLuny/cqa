20090223074640AA44gAb	Science & Mathematics;Weather	Check my answers, please?	Am I correct?   1. The curving of these planetary winds (Prevailing Southwesterlies, NE trades, SE Trades, Prevailing Northwesterlies) is a result of   ? Earth's rotation on it's axis   ((or would it be the unequal heating of the Earth's atmosphere))      2.  The climatic conditions where tradewinds converge are    ? warm and wet      and one more..      It says to describe two factors that contribute to the climate of a region   would it be temperate of atmosphere and temperature of Earth's surface (I'm going to describe them later) or would it be something else?      Thanks, I got stumped by those three questions later.

Having said all that our thoughts are part of the universe so its has to spring from reality or something simply possible.

20090223085515AAWze4j	Science & Mathematics;Astronomy & Space	Is big bang a religious belief?	Scientific observation leads us to conclude the presence of four physical principles. From those four physical principles, we arrive at generally accepted material realities such as the conversion of material mass to energy always conforms to a uniform equation, or that every motion is the product of a causal impetus. Based on observable material reality in the present state of the universe, I theorize that causal impetus precedes the big bang and in addition, I contend this is arguably a scientifically credible theory supported by observation and experiment. THEREFORE: Is causal impetus that precedes the big bang not MORE scientifc theory than belief, while conversely, NO casual impetus that precedes the big bang accounts as scientifically unfounded and thus, arbitrary presumptive superstitious belief?      Note: (Notice how I never used the words, 'god' or 'creation'? Let's see if the scientists can maintain the same level of discipline...)

20090223085323AAe28bJ	Science & Mathematics;Astronomy & Space	What source do use for distances to stars and objects beyond 1000 light-years?	I find the Hipparcos distance estimate to most stars beyond 1000 light-years pretty erroneous? Like for example Betelgeuse, Deneb, Naos (Zeta Puppis), Hadar (Beta Centauri), Regor (Gamma Velorum) All of these stars have their distance changed since 2006. How do you deal with this? Do you have any other comprehensive catalog where I can use for comparing the distances? Aside from OB group distances of course. Surely that's what astronomers do, they compare a lot of sources to get a better estimate of an object's true distance.., All help will be greatly appreciated! Thanks!

I made 25% of the total amount for week #2      Do I subtract or do I divide to find the percentage difference?  In other words, is the percentage difference equal to 25% (50%-25%) or 50% (25% / 50%).      This is for an accounting database I am designing for the company I work at and nobody here is sure either.

Hello, i graduated high school about 2 years ago and since then i've been working full time to help out my family and in about 6 months i'm finally going to go to school. The thing is, it feels as if though i forgot mostly everything. The reason i want to relearn math is because i want to major in either computer science or engineer, personally i don't know the difference but i know i'll like both lol. Anyways, i'm really good with math and i was one of those kids in school who never tried and always got B's, but never A's because i never did my homework :p.      Anyways, i really want to relearn everything. In high school i took geometry, algebra 2, math analysis and  ap calculus in my senior year. Math was always really fun and came easy to me so hopefully teaching my self over again won't be too much of a problem. My real question is, are there any sites that can guide me so i can relearn all this stuff? Sites with tests and stuff to make sure i know it.

20090223082339AAgLH18	Science & Mathematics;Zoology	1 yellow and black butterfly in dream...what does this mean?	I saw a yellow and black butterfly in my dream. In the dream, I was mad at my fiance because we didn't realize that our wedding date passed and nothing happened!  It's suppose to be on May 2, and he said it was already May 7 or 8 in the dream!  I was frustrated because this meant we both would have to reschedule another day to get married, and it would take 6 or more months before we get another venue!        I blamed it on him because he was too busy to help, and because everything I asked him to do for the wedding he failed to do!  So I ran to my room...and for some reason it was the room in our old house (5 or 6 yrs ago) before we moved into this new one.  In most of my dreams, I don't know why, but I often find myself going to this room.  But what was weird is that the room had 2 doors.  The main one, and one on the side that supposedly led to a nearby room.  I locked both of them because I know my fiance would run after me and try to apologize, and I didn't want to hear it.  I sat on the bed and just saw this small yellow and black butterfly just flying around in my room.  I didn't know how it got there.  After awhile, my fiance ended up figuring out how to open the door with a belt or bobby pin.  And that was the end of my dream.        Please help me figure out what this means?  Thanks!

He then cracked the egg and it was still completely raw on the inside!

20090223102939AAB9bYC	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Question about odds/probability?	You'll have to excuse me as math is my weakest function... but I will do my best to explain and ask this question. I had an arguement with a friend about Odds and how odds change with changes in the situation, using the game show ' deal or no deal' . basically, he said that if you picked one case, and picked the 28 cases other cases (or whatever it is) and of the two left, one still contained a million dollars, the odds were greater that the case you didn't pick had the million dollars. I told him this wasen't the case because there is no reason to beleive that your case or the other case has or does not have the million over the other. he said the fact that you picked 28 other cases without losing the million made the odds worse in your favor.       I tried to show him using this exampe. I am going to randomly pick one man out of a line of four. let's call them a, b, c, and d. Pick one of them. For example, he picks a.  He agree thats you have a 1/4 chace of being picked, and a 3/4 chance of not being picked. good. Now I pick D. What are the odds of you getting picked now? 1/3. Now I pick c., and we are left with a and b. He would argue that 'because you picked a and haven't got got eliminated yet that the odds will still be worse for you. I told him this is totally illogical, but he says its 'just the way things work'   It drives me nuts! How can I explain this to him ? I tried with the example above, using cups with chips under them, etc... but he doesn't get it. He thinks the fact that you pick something would leave you with a worse chance, but it doesn't! It drives me nuts!

20090223074421AAWAd5z	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Really need help with this math.?	1. Suppose you are an event coordinator for a large performance theater. One of the hottest new Broadway musicals has started to tour, and your city is the first stop on the tour. You need to supply information about projected ticket sales to the box office manager. The box office manager uses this information to anticipate staffing needs until the tickets sell out. You provide the manager with a quadratic equation that models the expected number of ticket sales for each day x. (  is the day tickets go on sale).                  a. Does the graph of this equation open up or down? How did you determine this?        b. Describe what happens to the tickets sales as time passes?       c. Use the quadratic equation to determine the last day that tickets will be sold. (Note: Write your answer in terms of the number of days after ticket sales begin.)       d. Will tickets peak or be at a low during the middle of the sale? How do you know?        e. After how many days will the peak or low occur?        f. How many tickets will be sold on the day when the peak or low occurs?        g. What is the point of the vertex? How does this number relate to your answers in parts e and f?        h. How many solutions are there to the equation ? How do you know?        i. What do the solutions represent? Is there a solution that does not make sense? If so, in what ways does the solution not make sense?

MY QUESTION:   is it right that the initiator protein and the helicase have the same function??why cant we use one of them.   2-aren't we suppose to have the gyrase negatively supercoil the strand so that it would be easier for the helicase to do its work.

20090223110625AAc5Wy7	Science & Mathematics;Weather	Why do people live in snow storms?	There are always severe snow storms and blizzards during the winter in the north. Every year power goes out, school and work are canceled for weeks, and people are literally frozen to death. I never hear of evacuations, because, at least, in the south, the residents are given a warning to evacuate to somewhere safe such as with hurricanes. Tornadoes do not seem to happen as often as severe snow storms. There hasn't been a major earthquake in decades in the west.       So my question is why do so many people enjoy this weather more than hot weather? Is it true that they live in houses with no power for weeks and have no where to go? Is it true that lots of people are dying because of the weather? If so, how many and aren't you scared? Are they just well-prepared for this weather?

20090223111652AAFTI3C	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Volume of Bubble Rising to Surface?	An air bubble of 28 cm3 volume is at the bottom of a lake 53 m deep where the temperature is 4.0°C. The bubble rises to the surface, which is at a temperature of 19.0°C. Take the temperature of the bubble's air to be the same as that of the surrounding water. Just as the bubble reaches the surface, what is its volume, in cubic cm?      I tried; V2 = P1V1T2/P2T1   = (1.013 x 10^5 + 28000(9.8)(53)) (0.001L)(277.15) /  (1.013 x 10^5)(292.15)   .. but it didn't work?      Help please?
20090223111751AAkDvnV	Science & Mathematics;Chemistry	How many grams of Benzene, C6H6 must be mixed with toluene to produce a solution of 61.61 torr?	The exact question given:   How many grams of benzene, C6H6 must be mixed with 26.32 g of toluene, C6H5O4, at 20.0 degrees Celsius to produce a solution with a vapor pressure above the solution of 61.61 torr? The vapor pressures of benzene and toluene at 20.0 degrees Celsius are 75.00torr and 22.00torr, respectively. These compounds form nearly ideal solutions when mixed together.      I've been trying to figure this problem out for at least an hour. I've attempted to use Raoult's Law, but for some reason i just can't figure it out. Help needed please!
20090223111849AAMbnGi	Science & Mathematics;Biology	Question about genetic crosses....?	In snapdragons, variation in flower color determined by a single gene. RR individuals are red, Rr individuals are pink, and rr individuals are white. In a cross between heterozygous individuals, the expected ratio of red flowered:pink flowered:white flowered off-spring is 1:2:1.      a) The results of such a cross were 10red-, 21pink-, and 9 white-flowered offspring. Do these results differ significantly from the expected frequencies, which is 1:2:1?   b) In another, larger experiment, you could 100 times as many flowers as in the experiment in part(a) and 1000 red, 2100 pink, and 900 white. Do these results differ significantly from the expected 1:2:1 ratio?   c) Do the proportions observed in the two experiments(parts a and b) differ? Did the results of the two hypothesis tests differ? Why or why not?

20090223112145AA1ufaG	Science & Mathematics;Chemistry	Catalysts homework help?	1.) There is a reaction between hydrogen peroxide and manganese dioxide catalyst which makes water and hydrogen. How could you tell that the manganese dioxide is not simply reacting with the hydrogen peroxide to give oxygen?      2.) Iron Oxide is at 760 degrees celsius, Nickel oxide is at 630 degrees celsius. Which would be a better catalyst to make reactions run at lower temperatures and why?
