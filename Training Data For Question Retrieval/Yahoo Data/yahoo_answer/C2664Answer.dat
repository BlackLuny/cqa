e67e5dfc74c396a718533bd7b4a5f8fbaa	hi there the only thing you can do is get your family to spend more time with him, he is so used to you doing everything for him that he has your scent everywhere and he has learnt to trust you totally.<br>  Get the other members of the family to feed him little treats, and let him out of his hutch and let the rabbit come to them rather than them go to him, he will when he is comfortable approach them and investigate them he is just nervous and rabbits need to totally trust people before they let them near them. Hope this information helps it will take a while for him to trust them, and this shouldbe done by food treats or toys, but the main thing is let him make friends with them not them make friends with him hes clever.|`|40EotGSlaa	i think this rabbit trusts you, but nobody else, your the one that takes care of the rabbit so it will completly trust just you|`|G3Xf0i0Eaa	Just on the off chance - could you change his feeding time to the evening, say after school, instead of in the morning?<br>  <br>  <br>  If not, introduce your family members to Jet everytime you go out to him, so he knows you trust them, and he wont be so nervous with you about?|`|nVoz9g1daa	You are the one always doing things for it so it trusts you but no one else has gained the bunnies trust yet|`|felwUhU3aa	u do everything for him so he loves u|`|nU0dLVD9aa	You don't have to get him to like your family because animals should be stuck in there own ways especially in three years. Maybe you should hold him while your family pets him so he will feel safe knowing that you are there with him. Do this often so that he'll know he can trust everyone in the house and not just you. if this doesn't work then I'm assuming nothing will because most animals are family pets but there are also animals that only like one owner. That's most likely the rabbit it sounds like you have. But try this first, if it works then you will know for sure it works.<br>  <br>  GoOd LuCk!!
Mcf33eLbaa	I doubt anything will be passed to your cat.<br>  For the other sit by the phone and be patient they will call and let you know about your dogs condition.<br>  I know your husband probably over estimated the blood loss so stay calm and put in a good word with the BIG DAWG upstairs, I will for him as well.<br>  everything you have done was right on now it`s just the waiting unfortunately.<br>  Good Luck and God Bless your dog.|`|4c53bf469dfe96ac19d353f625f2d1daaa	Could he have eaten something he wasn't suppose to. Hang in there the Vet is the best place I just hope you caught it soon enough. If someone poisoned him it might be to late. Good Luck hope you can keep us posted.|`|7x9lvbhAaa	do you leave your dog outside alone? because some one could of rat poison him|`|5bWYjqO9aa	i stroungly suggest you take him to the vet.|`|iOgfROfNaa	It could be variety of things, unfortunately, as you may know this is a serious situation.  It could be parvo, poisoning of some kind, worm, cancer, or a bacterial infection.  Parvo can be transmitted at any age in animals, if your dog is up to date on his shots then he would have received the parvo shot.  The vet will be able to determine what is going on.  I don't want you to lose hope but I lost a dog to them same symptoms, she had cancer, one of the tumors exploded inside of her and basically nothing that they could do at that point.<br>  I wish you luck and prayers.<br>  My thoughts will be with you.|`|o93EwErKaa	Does he have access to bones that he may have swallowed?  I would guess it is more likely to be a bowel perforation from a swallowed foreign object so it wouldn't be contagious to other animals.  Hope the dog is better soon.|`|AA10412922	It could be many things,including parvo,hemorrhagic gastroenteritis or poisoning.Just pray for the best and wait for more info.

Nt7exGYAaa	This would be almost impossible to answer because all cats stretch literally hundreds of times in a day. They do it when they wake up, after sitting, lying down, playing - it's an ongoing thing.|`|KLMo9jbzaa	They stretch a lot especially since most cats sleep about 18+ every day. we have 3 and it's about 2:30 pm and they're fast asleep and they won't get up unless they get hungry or need to use the box and they will stretch about 4-6 times before they get there going and don't forget about all the yawning too. one of our cat is always yawning even when he meows for some thing he gets a yawn in right in the middle of his meow, I even saw him yawn well he was sleeping.  I some times call him yawny.|`|GmbeNHNgaa	That's just too tough to answer! they scrath all the time.|`|Rw7gi86Naa	A lot. It depends on how stiff they are and how many cat naps they have taken.|`|teFKJflZaa	oh man they do it like all day long, even it they just happen to be walking along they have a little stretch. it think it has something to do with keeping their mussels in good shape
24CFl7sjaa	Personally id contact a breed rescue and see if you can get a dog that has some known history, got nothing against shelter dogs, but I prefer some background/history on any dog I have as I have kids and other dogs to juggle into the equation. The breed rescues will often also rescue urgent cases from the shelter and assess them according to their breed which can be more accurate than a general shelter assessment. If you take one from breed rescue you are still freeing up a vital space for the next deserving dog, plus if they have had some time fostered with bully experienced homes they wont be as traumatised as shelter dogs can be..|`|d5YcH69Paa	I would look more towards a group that does mainly Bull breed rescue.  They are always looking for great homes, their dogs are in a home environment so any problems would be well known.  They can also tell you about the dogs temperament with other dogs and animals, what type of exercise it will require.  Stuff that your local pound just won't know about their dogs.<br>  <br>  Thank You for considering adoption before purchasing!!|`|FQmZLqMdaa	I would bide my time & investigate all practical possibilities before making a final decision.  It could be that they wouldn't like someone to own 2 APBT.  In the UK we have a website called Gumtree & you can often find this type of dog on there.|`|5bWYjqO9aa	a good idea may be to ask someone there.|`|4f4e2db09d8269e64253ffc63202cb21aa	if you are looking to adopt i did some internet searching and found my dog. I went to a lot of animal shelters. They did offer an adoption program for you but some will take weeks to approve you. What i did i went to <a href="https://www.craigslist.com" rel="nofollow">https://www.craigslist.com</a> and posted an ad under animal/shelter saying what i was looking for and well a couple days later i had an animal rescue contact me with a dog that i fell in love with. but you have to be careful there are some people on there that will sell anything on the streets for over 400.00. So stick to the animal shelters or rescues.. good luck. I found my dog missy and i love her. she was only 8 weeks old when i got her and i didnt have to pay anything for her.. she is so spoiled ...lol good luck finding your dog

Rabbits make great pets if you put in the time and effort to make them great.  Here are some of my opinions:<br>      - don't make too much noise<br>      - once potty-trained, are very clean<br>     - are very lovable if treated correctly<br>     - have cute mannerisms<br>     - can be taught to do some pretty impressive tricks<br>     - don't require a lot of grooming<br>     - the food is fairly inexpensive<br>     - toys can be made from household items<br>     - will lounge around with you<br>     - soooo cute!! :)<br>  <br>  I had had two male lop rabbits.

TTLIp8Beaa	a baby hunter is a hunter horse is his first year of showing.<br>  they are also called 'pea green hunter', 'baby/green hunters' or just plain old 'green hunters'<br>  <br>  after their first year of showing, they are eligible to show with seasoned hunters. although green hunters can show against seasoned hunters, may owners choose not to. they show their green hunters only against other green hunters so that the playing field is more even. (so you don't have a horse in it's first year of showing competing against a horse that has been in the show ring for 7 years) a green hunter can be any age (from 3 to 20+) as long as that horse has never been shown before. most affiliated and non affiliated shows offer green hunter classes. <br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|Y07hleOzaa	The term 'baby hunter' means a young/inexperienced (also known as 'green') horse that is training to become a hunter.  A hunter horse is a horse that hunters use, along with dogs, to get animals.  The horses are trained in fields usually.  They learn to jump over streams/brooks, logs, fences, etc. to prepare them for the woods.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped.  :)|`|penuzN8jaa	a 'beginner horse' which is training to be a hunter if that makes sense!<br>  lol|`|Q8Sv4V48aa	It is a hunter class that is only for young, green horses.|`|n2dUmfcQaa	young horse|`|RO5OFXbUaa	do not send me no more emill ok  and r you on|`|pUpPXNzLaa	It means like Hunter Prospect.<br>  <br>  Hunter- A type of jumping<br>  Prospect- In the future they could be....<br>  <br>  So he will be a good jumper in the future.
cURFUJRRaa	I wouldn't go straight to calling animal control because that will definitely lose a friendship, maybe she just doesn't know how to discipline the puppy properly. A light smack on the nose can be okay every once in a while but this has obviously gone WAY too far. If you know how to, let her know how to properly discipline the puppy, letting her know that what they are doing can seriously hurt the puppy and cause him to act out more. If you do not know all the ins and outs of discipline, or just do not want to get into it suggest her and her fiance take the puppy to classes such as at petsmart. I've taken my dog there before and they really do help! Not only do they teach you how to discipline and teach the dog tricks, but it also socializes the dog.|`|WxbrZnKdaa	learn some proper puppy training techniques and then when your visiting, say that youve heard "this" works better. or there's a show called "its me or the dogs" and its this lady that goes to houses and trains the dogs and the owners. maybe tell her to check it out some day while its on tv, by saying there puppy might learn faster. there pup is going to grow up skid-dish because of the abuse, and might become mean..|`|ANnz3Kpdaa	if you can not be honest with them they are not true friends and you don't need friends like that call animal control right now|`|7vJNHaskaa	Wow, call animal control on them. That's not right at all.|`|onRK9kenaa	use your best judgment|`|d5YcH69Paa	Go about it in a non-confrontational way.  Tell her about how you trained your own dog to do XX by using positive methods, how you got a much better response and she learned much quicker doing it with positive training.  Make your dog into the ultimate example of positive training so that your friend will WANT to do anything possible to make HER dog act that way.<br>  <br>  Offer to give her some books that detail positive training methods and put her in touch with a positive trainer.  If your friend gets defensive about it, just back off a bit a try again later.|`|01vMpHkWaa	i thought you ment just a smack on the nose<br>  <br>  but THROWING ACROSS THE ROOM?! OMG!!<br>  <br>  screw the friendship..save the dog<br>  call animal control!!!|`|AA11828439	Personally, this is NOT the type of person I would want to be friends with. You should report them to the ASPCA.|`|4c53bf469dfe96ac19d353f625f2d1daaa	That dog will grow up to fear them only and fear isn't good. Please say something friends tend to listen to each other. If the right person see's it they will get arrested. You have seen it so please say something like the damage they are doing to there impressionable puppy. Ask who treated them like that? Its Sad!|`|bx7qmKbGaa	Throwing across the room??? I feel awful when I push them off the couch!<br>  <br>  <br>  You need to talk to animal control to see if you can do anything.|`|Jb9FBLe3aa	You can always give her an idea she likes better than that. Explain to her that its more effecient to reward the dog when it is good than to punish it when it is bad. The dog will start to be good to get the reward. You can start out with treats, then half the treat + a head scratch and a "good dog!", then slowly make it just good dog +head scratch. You can also use a clicker. Show your friend how first, then if she sees that its working better, she will most likely do the same. After all, if you're just punishing the dog, the dog just knows what NOT to do. It doesn't know what TO do. If you reward it, it knows exactly what to do.|`|Mcf33eLbaa	Friends don`t hit friends even if their dogs.<br>  It doesn`t sound to me like i would want to keep these folks as friends.<br>  DO THE RIGHT THING and call the humane society on these folks.<br>  Poor dog, heck I`d like to throw him across a room and see the expression on his face!!!!!<br>  To heck with worrying about losing them as friends, ok, think about this, what will they do if they ever had a child? I doubt it would be any different, abuse is abuse and needs to be reported.<br>  Heck give me their address and I`ll report them for you.<br>  Good Luck and God Bless
miOEIis1aa	no , its not necessary to get their teeth clipped.  If you provide them with enough things to (safely) chew on like wood, bark or fruits and vegetables then the rabbit won't have a problem. When they chew on hard objects, it wears their teeth down so you don't have to worry about them getting too long.|`|u94F7YDkaa	no they dont anasetic and u shound get them done by a vet to be safe because if u do them your self the teeth may crack and split apart but if u dnt have then done the teeth could grow up in till it goes up its nose to its brain .|`|nVoz9g1daa	Maybe you should try a salt wheel, that would file the teeth down and it gives the nutrients to the rabbit it needs|`|05805cd7f8ba800b6b1e4c9525a624bcaa	If your bunnies teeth are not overgrown it is not necessary to have them clipped. <br>  <br>  And if the vet is experienced enough the rabbit does not have to be put under to clip the teeth it takes about 10 seconds.|`|40EotGSlaa	your bunnies teeth will be bighting into woods to file them down, they will never sstop growing
I4vPxh3jaa	do....<br>  *daily walk<br>  *through a ball or frisbee around with her.<br>  *get a treadmill! one for you and her! dogs love it.<br>  *get her an all natural dog food with out fillers<br>  *give her healthy treats like fresh fruit anr meat.<br>  *try not to feed her table scraps. in doing this they can be over fed and gain weight faster.<br>  *take her to the dog park! socializing and fun!<br>  *go on a trail or hike with her, start small because she is over weight and it could hurt her, as she loses it, make the walks a bit longer.<br>  Good luck.|`|MpNCNQU5aa	start simple. get her on a treadmill for 10 min a day or go out and walk around. Labs love fetching so throw a ball and let her go get it. or have a rope and have fun and run around the yard with her. If you have a swimming pool let her go swimming with you (little mess afterwards but its really fun especially when you are in the pool with her)<br>  <br>  i am working on the same thing with my dog. In the summers i dont just walk her but i get in my roller blades and jog her a bit. try this. its really fun. just take it slow at first and build it up.|`|8YrqeCPQaa	Swimming is the best excersize for dogs, If she likes the water it will do miracles fir her weight problem. Play ball or frisbee with her in a lake or pool.  At first she may not be able to swim for very long but if you do it a couple times a week, she will be able to go longer and longer! Also running is good for them, but the only thing about running is it puts a lot of stress on the joints. Also remember that a dog who excersizes needs a lot of protein so in your case, I would cut back her food consumption to about 3 1/2 cups every day once a day, and excersize her and give her 2 raw eggs in her food a week (only two a week to help with muscle build). This is the schedual I have my dogs on and they are looking really good! Also swimming and the eggs will do wonders for her coat as well!|`|FQmZLqMdaa	I have a Whippet who was spayed & got FAT she should weigh 10-15KGS but got to 20KGS.  I was advised to exercise her more & feed her a little less by the vet.  It didn't work.  Last year she got very depressed & so I adopted a 9 month old Whippet puppy from a lovely lady who had chchronicrthritis the result being Bella has lost all the excess & is a very happy dog who has a playmate she can take out on long lelead lessalks & chase after like a loony.  Everyone is happy.|`|u12yrUI2aa	i would off with a half hr walk everyday plus at least an hr of high paced play and a good quality diet food they should have a recomnendation of how much to feed but i would make sure that its less then what you are feeding now and once she starts to lose weight and gain more energy she will need more and more exercise|`|kvHqnR5Haa	Just take her for daily walks.  My cousin has a lab and we live in Wisconsin where it is too cold to take walks in the winter (their paws freeze) so she walks her dog on the treadmill for a bit each day!  It sounds funny but Sadie loves it and it really helps to get rid of some of her energy :)

XpKY04Tnaa	I've owned dogs now for thirty years and this is how I train them. <br>  <br>  Starting the first day with a puppy. I start taking them out for a walk around the yard every two hours. They will follow you and when they stop to potty you stop and wait for them so finish. Then praise and pet them giving your approval. At night I let them sleep in a locked cage. Trust me when I say they'll wake you up to go outside. Then you have to get up just like if you had a baby and take them outside. Do the same routine. <br>  As time goes by your involvement gets less and less until one day they just go outside on their own. Same goes for the night time trips. They'll start sleeping through the night after a couple of months. <br>  <br>  Now they just come up to me and scratch on my leg and I go let them out. <br>  <br>  P.S. If you have to go to work and leave the puppy by them selves during the day. Get a dogging play pin at PetsMart and use the little pee pads. I used those for the first year until they could hold it while we were out.|`|01vMpHkWaa	lol you mean house train?<br>  and just watch her actions before she uses the bathroom so you can find out when she needs to go<br>  since she is so tiny she must go often so keep an eye out<br>  when she goes in the house do something to make sure she knows that was bad..like show her it and yell NO!

When he pees/poops inside the house, take him directly out. (Or try and catch him when he is about too. That works better.) Shoving the nose in the poop dosnt work, from personal experiances. But, make sure he is in a crate at night, and block out places you dont want him to go. He will poop and pee for a while. But, right now just take him/her out often, after he/she goes inside, or before. And make sure he/she goes out three or more times a day.|`|c2c3a447ca6a35c94ffed12e17bf8913aa	I suggest you purchase a book on puppy training or talk to a trainer.<br>  If you are this unknowledgable about dog training - no one here could possibly type enough for you.  Potty training is the very very basic!!!<br>  You need to educate yourself about a lot more training than just house breaking!|`|OtfSP7kHaa	It'll never happen without a set of stairs.

sBsFK2h5aa	Im sure its perfectly normal. My cat adores climbing and hates climbing down. (But she always does.) Im sure nothing is wrong at all. Especially if she likes to climb. But if anything is wrong, it may be her tail. Tails help cats balance. Try looking at it. If nothing is wrong there, dont worry. Five years is a while, and you would notice if it was a big problem =3|`|Jb9FBLe3aa	My cats sort of like that. She'll only play if no one's looking, or if you keep poking her and annoying her with something. Try driving your cat crazy with a toy. get one of those long ones and poke her till she's interested, then start jerking it up and down. that works with my cat. BTW, tigger? a tigger that doesn't like to jump. seriously.|`|25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	i would guess something hurts. as adults, cats prefer jumping to climbing.<br>  <br>  as long as she seems ok, i would not worry, just her way of adapting.|`|Uek2TNLMaa	mayby she has a depth perception problem.|`|KLMo9jbzaa	My 8 year old cat Milo doesn't jump either unless she can climb up where ever she needs to get, I think being 18lbs. might have something to do with it and I do have her on a diet she already lost 2 lbs. and I am feeding her very little on a prescription diet food from our Veterinarian and I hope she will become more active as she loses weight.|`|Nt7exGYAaa	It could be something just as simple as a fear of jumping but have you checked her out for what could have been a previous injury that may be stopping her doing this?  Often cats don't show pain as humans do. Might be an idea to have a vet check her over next time she goes in.|`|GmbeNHNgaa	My cat does the same thing!

JREyMH4zaa	Nothing on your own..set up payments if you have to..an eye infection, untreated or treated improperly can cause loss of sight..|`|aCqSF87Raa	If you can afford the internet, your phone, your clothes, or anything else you want... you should be able to afford vet care for your dog. If not, talk to your vet about payment plans OR surrender your dog to someone who CAN provide the proper care. <br>  <br>  You cannot use ANYTHING on your own as it could make the problem worse. Only a vet should diagnose and treat. If you do not provide proper care, you may be reported by someone: then you will face fines and other legal fees (which will, in the end, be more expensive than a trip to the vet for a check up and some eye drops.)<br>  <br>  Next time be sure you have money BEFORE getting the pet. They need the same quality care a human child or YOU would get, which means expense.|`|3zv2bbolaa	Because you don't know the cause of the infection, it would be difficult to treat at home. I would see if your family can't rearrange the budget for a month (eat Ramen noodles for a few evenings or forego a special outing) to pay for a visit to the vet for a proper diagnosis.|`|ulUEq4uraa	I think, if available, it's important that you take out pet insurance.  Dogs will need several trips to a vet over a lifetime which can of course work out quite costly, and insurance shouldn't be too expensive on a monthly basis.<br>  <br>  That said, is there some sort of animal clinic you could try, as in not a private practise?|`|GmbeNHNgaa	Often times pet store run vet clinics cheap.

I entered her in a contest if you'd like to help her win by voting for her?  <a href="http://www.BISSELL.com/MVP09/Week06/Vote6.aspx?ImageName=Lady+Camilla+Von+Fluffinpuff&FileName=870.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.BISSELL.com/MVP09/Week06/Vote...</a>|`|Jb9FBLe3aa	Well my cats don't do anything that weird when they're asleep, except if we throw something at 'em they'll jump about six feet high. But my dog, when she starts sleeping really well, will just start this little bark kinda like a hiccup. Its like she's barking with her mouth closed.<br>  But my cats were so funny yesterday. OK, I better explain this first. About a year and a half ago, this boy kitten (now full grown, obviously) showed up at my dad's work. Then a few monthes later, a female (not quite full grown) shows up. Next thing we know, she's pregnant. We got people to take all the kittens from that litter. Next thing we know, shes pregnant again. So after she has this litter, we get her fixed so we can bring her home. Then we catch one of her kittens and bring her home a few weeks later. But when we bring her home, the mama cat has either a) forgotten its her kitten, or b)decided hey, you've been gettin' along fine without me lately, and heck, you don't need me.<br>  So now the mama cat doesn't like the kitten, but the kitten doesn't really get it.<br>  So anyway, yesterday, both the cats were in the house. (They aren't really outside cats except for at night. they don't have a litter box or anything.) The kitten likes to hide under stuff, and so does the mama when the kitten's inside too. So we were in my mom's room, and the kitten was under the bed, and the mama was under the dresser. I was trying to get the big one out, so I grabbed this fake pussywillow branch and was bugging her with it so she would play, and all of a sudden the kitten jumps out and attacks it, and the mama starts hissing. I couldn't tell if she was more mad at the branch or the kitten, but then she started popping at the kitten, which ran back under the bed. But then once I started trying to get the big one out again, she'd jump back out at it, and it kept going over and over. It probably doesn't sound that funny, but it was hilarious to watch. Sorry this was so long.|`|UNFxjNHkaa	haha!  my maine coon, Luigi - when he sleeps he twitches his ears and kicks his back legs and then all of a sudden out of nowhere will jump 5 feet high!

They too, are created by the same loving hand of God which Created us...It is our duty to Protect Them and to promote their well-being.”—Mother Teresa. <br>  <br>  “Animals possess a soul and men must love and feel solidarity with our smaller brethren…the fruit of the creative action of the Holy Spirit and merit respect…as near to God as men are.” He reminded people that all living beings came into being because of the “breath” of God.

It is both an extraordinary financial and emotional commitment, that even at my (much older) age, is still daunting. I'd recommend starting with a partial lease. During that period, you need to pretend you own a horse and put money away monthly at the rate you'd be spending. Assume some numbers like $800 / mth for board, 200 / mth for farrier, 100-200 / mth for vet, 100 / month for "unexpecteds". Do this for 6 months to a year. That accumulates 7-15k in the 6 months to a year. You can use this money to purchase the horse and do an extensive prepurchase. You will also know you have the discipline and the income.<br>  <br>  You need to also think about how to sustain the outlays in the event you lose your job. So you want probably 4-5 months of expenses in the bank when you finish the purchase and you want to maintain that going forward.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, a half lease doesn't cost nearly as much as ownership, but it will feel like a very similar commitment. Pledge to be there when the vet comes or the farrier comes. Ask to be allowed to arrange those appointments. All this will get you a feel for real horse ownership.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps. I learned a lot about this commitment in the six months I saved to get horses for myself and my wife. And with the economy as tough as it is, I'm learning more now.<br>  <br>  Best wishes, and I hope you realize your dream!

3giaPYe8aa	3 times per day, and then change him to 2 times per day when he is six months old.|`|c2c3a447ca6a35c94ffed12e17bf8913aa	There should be a chart on your dog food based on weight and age.  also what did the breeder or vet say.<br>  <br>  i find twice a day to be fine for my dogs.   labs are very food oriented.|`|LSMrAfzYaa	3 times a day.<br>  <br>  Should be about 7:00am, 14:00pm and 18:00pm<br>  <br>  About 6 months you should reduce him to 2 a day.<br>  <br>  At about 10:00am and 18:00pm<br>  <br>  Thats what i do with mine. <br>  <br>  He is a yellow lab. :)|`|vwGSTzHYaa	Maybe try 3 times a day.<br>  <br>  Just experiment a bit.<br>  <br>  Next time you go to the vet, which should be soon cause he's a puppy, ask the vet.<br>  <br>  Good Luck! :D|`|ym6pyUfIaa	Feed him 1 time in the morning, and 1 time before you go to bed. every time you take him out side, when he goes in give him a treat|`|bRmAUPmkaa	three times or more, add some wet food if you can but at least a cup of dry too|`|Y07hleOzaa	For puppies, it is better to eat small meals three times a day than two or even one large meal.  However, it's not good to leave a lot of food in the bowl for him to eat all day.  Most dogs will eat it all...right now.  That's not healthy and could make them sick.  However, don't be fooled.  Don't keep feeding and feeding him if he begs or finishes quickly.  If you are giving him good amounts, he is done eating.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped.  :)|`|GGjjtHmHaa	no, they will do that but it's just like children they always want too much. i would only feed him i can of wet dog food or if you feed him dry food only one of those red plastic cups that you always see people drink beer out of...(i know that's not a good way to recognize anything like that but...:P)|`|ySBKzNb6aa	Three times a day. You can easily add more to his dish and you can predict when you have to walk him.
zqVDJxUIaa	There aren't many tetras that grow that big. I'd recommend getting perhaps a small school of serpae tetras. These are very fast swimming and lively tetras which will not get eaten by your other fish.

VkFDAQ46aa	simply put ABSOLUTELY NOT!!!|`|0pVXLyGhaa	Unless the temperature is around 70 degrees Fahrenheit all year round, that is a dangerous thing to do with a dog.<br>  <br>  Cars can easily become overheated in summer, even with the window cracked open.  And cars freeze in winter.<br>  <br>  This man doesn't know much about responsible dog ownership.  <br>  <br>  If it is summertime (over 80 degrees outside), then you could call the police animal control to check on the dog.|`|OrvTG44laa	No, it is very hot.  The dog has a lack of circulating air and is stuck in what can become an oven.  They can't just open the door and get out.  On a hot day, you might find a dead dog in your car if you do this.|`|TXmAx8jwaa	No. I dont think thats fair on the dog being cooped up for hours inside a car.|`|b5QWb0Fgaa	he should be shot and shouldn't try to influence any one with his ideas if he doesn't even know that could kill his dog|`|GmbeNHNgaa	NO!!! Dogs often die from heat exhaustion in cars!|`|7vJNHaskaa	NO.|`|RwQmN7Reaa	Not at all! Especially not during the hot summer months and extremely cold winter months. Dogs are very social animals and need to be in a pack environment but that does not mean you should ever bring a dog with to work and leave it in a parked car. Even with the windows open the dog probably didn't have water available throughout the day and it had to deal with the sun beating down through the windows on it along with being in a hot car. It really shocks me that no one called the police, there is actually a very hefty fine and possibly even jail time if there is evidence of abuse which it could be considered.|`|GGjjtHmHaa	i think it's cruel, he should either leave him at home, take him into the class room with him! i mean...he's right, if you leave the window open for a little it's ok and all but i really dont like the idea of a dog being in a car for more than 1 hour at a time....that's just me....|`|LHrJp83Uaa	NO!

In fact, it is called cruelty to animals and is a punishable offence. Even with the windows cracked, a car in the summer can reach well over 100 degrees (even if it isn't too bad outside). The car works like an oven and starts to cook the dog alive. If you ever see this again, call the cops or the humane society asap!|`|bIaywrBCaa	no, it's okay for a quick run into the store but not for hours, NO!|`|n8jrLDblaa	Yup...that would be cruel.<br>  <br>  Small dog or large...a car is not enough space for an animal. And the boredom a dog would experience in such a situation could lead to destructive behaviors.|`|JiCKFTuIaa	Depends on where the car is.<br>  If out in the sun it will cook a dog in short order.<br>  When I'm out training all day, there is only one dog out at a time.<br>  The rest are sleeping comfortably in this.<br>  <a href="http://i396.photobucket.com/albums/pp43/blunderpic/dogs/6-dog-D.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i396.photobucket.com/albums/pp43/...</a><br>  or this<br>  <a href="http://i396.photobucket.com/albums/pp43/blunderpic/dogs/Picture010.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i396.photobucket.com/albums/pp43/...</a><br>  <br>  I do believe the back seat of a car could be a bit more comfortable tho'|`|24CFl7sjaa	It would be dangerous to leave any living thing in a car in the summer, it doesnt take long for the temperature inside a car to escalate if its a hot day and even with a window open you can end up with a dead dog on your return.|`|KxjUim7yaa	In summer a car can get very hot, and quickly even if the windows are open. It is cruel to leave a dog in the car and many places it is illegal.|`|8jd2AHJdaa	No way, he would suffocate!!
Gr6Xe1gGaa	I think those are two great birds. If you want a cheap bird I suggest getting a parakeet. You can get then from a breeder, Pets mart or Petco. They are about 15 to 25 dollars. They can be very playful if you bond with them they can learn to play with you. You can get a male parakeet. Male parakeets tend to sing more and may get a little noisy, but because they sing more you can teach them to talk! Although, that takes a while but if you really want to try always say simple words to them. Words like, "hi" and "bye" and their names. You can get a female they don't sing much and bite harder than males, but are easier to train. Or you can just get both since parakeets like having friends in their cages. If you want more information you can try finding this book at your local library or bookstore. The book is called, "Your happy Healthy Parakeet 2nd edition." Here is a picture of it.....<a href="https://www3814.ssldomain.com/avianenrichment/store/pc/catalog/products/150300.jpg." rel="nofollow">https://www3814.ssldomain.com/avianenric...</a> I hope this helps!|`|XA5Zo8Zaaa	well first off no bird is cheap i have a cockatiel and also a macaw my teil was about 250 all put together my macaw was about 4000 dallors and a parakeet is a good starter bird but a cockateil is not and do not go the cheap rt because if you don't have the money that you don't need to get a bird im sorry if you are not financially fit to do so than do not get a bird but a good bird is a cockateil if you like that not a parakeet if you can get a conure thay are one gooood bird look into a sun conure and if the deal looks to good to be true it is. hope i could help<br>  <br>  sincerely.<br>  seth|`|b5QWb0Fgaa	if it is popular chances are its not original|`|Z9kCzIkyaa	I'd go with a Tiel, but try to find a young one|`|enC9TvxUaa	-First of all, any bird will NOT be cheap!

It will take some time but he will start to associate the table with being ignored and will eventually give up.|`|AbRfd29Haa	You (and anyone else) feeding him from the table has reinforced in him the idea that begging works. Table food is fine (in general, as long its not excessive and not a sort of food dogs should avoid), but it needs to be fed to him in his normal place of eating. <br>  <br>  You have to break his bad habit the way you do any other bad habit.. when he's begging, every single time, tell him "no!" It doesn't have to be mean, but it has to be decisive and immediate. You may also have to ban him from your dining area if he persists, after being told "no". And you need everyone involved to do likewise... if you're trying to stop him, but others are still feeding him from the table or even encouraging him while you're eating, his behavior is unlikely to change.|`|24CFl7sjaa	get a child safety gate and seperate him to the otherside of it. he can still see you but cant get to you.

Over time she will get use to the fact that it isn't hers and she can just lay in the same room as you while you eat but only after she has learned the first step.  <br>  Good luck.|`|G4hCoeWoaa	Try putting a dog treat in his dish while you are eating.

pRa9VFTtaa	As with most fear issues, you need to employ something called "Classical Conditioning." It takes the fear of water and turns the fear into anticipation.<br>  <br>  What you need to do is start with a puddle. Don't start with a full bath. Make a puddle on concrete somewhere and get some treats. Encourage your dog to get near the puddle. If pooch even gets near the puddle, give a treat. If your dog even looks at the puddle, tell pooch how good she is and give a treat. When your dog is comfortable standing by the puddle, move on.<br>  <br>  Then, gently try to encourage your dog to walk through the puddle. This would work best if the puddle were large, and the only way to get to you was to walk through (not jump) the puddle. If pooch does it, treats and lots of praise. Continue this until your dog is happily walking through the puddle.<br>  <br>  Then, find a new puddle or stream and repeat. Repeat again and again until there's no hesitancy to walk through a shallow body of water.<br>  <br>  Now, move on to the hose and a bath. Get your hose out and get your dog near it. Give a treat. Praise. If your dog even looks at the hose, treat and praise. When you can get your pooch comfortabley standing next to the hose without water coming out of it, then move to the next step.<br>  <br>  Turn the hose on. Again, if your dog even gets near the hose, treat and praise. If your dog looks at the hose, same thing. Continue with the similar steps above until fido is standing next to the hose. <br>  <br>  Then, hold the hose - treats and praise. When your dog puts up with that - gently dribble some water from the hose on your dog's back. Treats/praise. When your dog handles that, increase the water pressure a hair. You slowly build up to getting pooch used to the water.<br>  <br>  All of this should take you weeks if not months to progress through. Do not expect to get your dog classically conditioned in a few days or a few sessions. Slow. Slow. Slow. If your dog is balking to much, you're moving too fast.<br>  <br>  If during this time pooch needs a bath, then give one. During the bath, have someone doing the bath part and someone handing out treats the ENTIRE bath. You may want to just feed your dog his kibble dinner during the bath.  If your dog is really not a food hound and doesn't particularly care one way or another about dinner then skip a meal and get pooch very hungry before the bath. Then your dog will be more excited about getting some kibble with the bath.<br>  <br>  Another option is just to build portable steps into your bathtub for your dog to climb in and out of the tub easily. If your dog really doesn't mind the tub, than this would be a good option.<br>  <br>  What Classical Conditioning does is take your dog's fear of water and turns it into anticipation. Your dog will see water and think, "treats!" It turns a bad into a good.<br>  <br>  Also, you can use a clicker to do this much more easily. Get a book on clicker training and learn how to use a clicker with classical conditioning. You can find several books on clicker training at any bookstore or on-line at Amazon.com or at jandjdogs.com or cleanrun.com<br>  <br>  If you follow these suggestions slowly and with a positive attitude, I think that you can turn your dog's attitude around so that you can both enjoy your water experiences.|`|24CFl7sjaa	take him paddling!<br>  No seriously, take him to a shallow bit of water and see if he will step into it to retrieve a ball or toy. You might have to get in too!|`|FQmZLqMdaa	Was he a rescue?  If so he could have been abused at some point.<br>  Just because a breed is meant to love something not all dogs do.<br>  Most dogs love water but my 8 year old Whippet hates it.  We walk around a large lake & she runs into the wood away from it, I leave her to it when it is a warm sunny day she will often come back sopping wet with a smirk on her face where she has been in a stream but she will not go in a lake, nor will she have a bath.<br>  <br>  Do you bath him?  You could try putting him in the bathroom & putting an inch of water in the bottom of the bath then get him to go in, you could end up very wet but if he does it willingly you will appreciate the the time & effort spent.  Get him to sit in the water & gently scoop it onto him.  He will probably stand up & shake it off but if you persevere all will be well.  He may take a long time to get used to water but it will happen.|`|5CvocInQaa	The only thing that I can think of it to get him used to water. Introduce water to him alittle bit at a time. After awhile add little more water and so on. Sooner or later he should be ok with it. <br>  If this does not work, then he is just one of those dogs that hates water. I have a dog that hates water and I can't give her a bath myself or she will bite me. I have to take her to a doggie wash.

550KYFj5aa	All reptiles and amphibians need calcium though their needs change with age. You can buy calcium powders that have D3 added at the right concentration. If you were 100% sure that your pets were getting a perfectly balanced diet then probably not but I believe that the vit D3 enables the uptake of the calcium for the frgos.<br>  It would be best to speak with the person/shop you bought them from or have a look at the ARC website frogs.org.au which gives you heaps of qualified information specifically related to amphibians.

Talk to the vet about flea and tick once a month drops.|`|uhlPVTdkaa	get some dog toys and maybe a harness for walks.|`|hKVOw1Sjaa	How wonderful to see someone so well prepared.Re the tick and flea spray they do not work you n eed the drops on the back of the neck which have different names in diff countries whether Frontline or what ever.When you say shampoo and conditioner make sure these are for your breed as if you buy a pupy which has a wiry harsh coat you do not want to soften it at all.Make sure you have the pup microchipped or if getting a pure breed dog the breeder will or should have done this but you have to transfer it into your name.Having a Council tag is fine it means it is registered in your county but the microchip proves you own the dog.When you say bed,what kind if cane or  material it will chew it the best is a fold down crate bigger than the puppy so you can use it when it gets older too and it is invaluable for house training and pup will know that is its sleeping place and will not wander around your house at night.Get a stack of newspapers as you will need them to house train our puppy.You forgot to make an appointment with the vet for its shots which start at 8 weeks,then 12,16weeks and include the kennel cough in this last one..Another thing you have forgottem is worm tablets obtainable at the vet and it must be an all wormer.Do not forget to check if you are in a heart worm area if so you will have to organize this with the vet.<br>  l do not know what kind of puppy you areghetting so really it seems you have covered everything but you really do not need the toothpaste as if you give our dog raw meaty bones not sharp ones these will clean the pups and then adult dog's teeth.You can also buy denta bones which they love and clean their teeth.By the way what happened to a good comb not the cheap ones but one that is stainless steel or what is called the whippet comb,it comes in different sizes so you know your breed adapt to that.<br>  What sort of food have you stocked up with?if it is a pure breed the Breeder will give you a diet sheet if not try to include in its diet some raw food like chicken wings and chicken necks and mince beef.<br>  Okay that is all.l wish most of my puppy people were as well  prepared.Full marks to you for being prepared exceept have you found a reliable vet in your area you can trust in case of emrgencies?Remember if you clip the nails a s a pup do it gently but firmly and cut a little off at a time and if by chance it does bleed do not panic get a bar of soap and press it against the nail for a few minutes it will stop the bleeding.Good luck|`|FQmZLqMdaa	If it is a puppy I would buy him a crate so he can be contained when you are out of the house or in bed.  It is easier to train them this way.  I would also buy a blanket to cover the top of the crate so he can see all around but not be stressed by things coming at him from above.  I would also give him something of mine to make hime remember me & so he can snuggle up with it. Water bowl & feeding bowl.  I would also book a trip to the vet to get him checked out & micro chipped just in case he escapes.  Enjoy the experience & remember a small puppy has a small bladder & will need to go out every 2 or 3 hours until he is around 6 months old then it will be less often.|`|Y07hleOzaa	All of that is good, and necessary.  Impressive list.  However, absolutely do not forget heartworm medicine that the dog takes monthly.  I have had a dog die from heartworms.  It's not very fun, for the dog or for you. Also, and this is not necessary, but treats are highly appreciated, especially by the dog.  Get healthy ones that won't make him sick, though.  They can help you train the dog and also, there are treats that clean their teeth or have mints built in!  Also, where are the toys?  Toys are extremely beneficial for dogs because play exercises and is good for the dog.  Do not forget toys.  Each dog is different, and has preferred toys.  You just have to find it.  :)<br>  <br>  Hope I helped.  :)|`|GmbeNHNgaa	You may want a crate for when your not home. Puppies get in to all sorts of mischief!

Also, make sure the puppy is the required age before you put flea/tick ANYTHING on them (shampoo, collars, spray, liquid) because it can cause your new baby to get a rash. Also, if and when you do watch your puppies coat and scratching because some dogs can be allergic to the chemicals. (mine was and the vet told me to give her children's benadryl when I give her flea stuff. I really don't have a flea problem so I don't use it anymore at all) Also, depending on the breed you get I would ask your vet which type of nail clippers to get and what size. If you're going to be getting a large breed dog I would wait until your pup is full sized to buy the appropriate size and let your vet clip their nails until then, unless of coarse you want to buy two. Personally I feel more comfortable letting my vet/groomer doing it because my dachshund has black toenails and I can't see the quick. However, that's your own personal opinion and comfort zone. I would also research what kind of food you plan on feeding your puppy. I personally like Chicken Soup for the Dog Lovers Soul. I would also find out what kind the breeder is feeding before you bring your new baby home so if they don't give you a little to bring home (most will though) you can buy a little bag so their tummy has time to adjust to the change. (My vet reccomended letting the change last 10 days for the least amount of upset tummy, diarreah, etc.)  I don't know how you feel about the subject but you could also get "puppy panties" if you plan on getting a stubborn to housebreak dog. (It's like changing a babies diaper) Plus, they're really cute!! You might also want to get a kennel/crate (whatever you wanna call it) they help cut down on housetraining and if you put another dog bed in it it's more comfortable. Toys also, chew toys especially. I like to occasionally look in the baby isle for toys too, esp if you're going to be getting a small breed dog!|`|xQycRRQdaa	1-Crate to sleep in, every dog needs a safe place to sleep or nap.<br>  2-Airline carry kennel for trips to the vet or around town.<br>  3-Baby gate(s) to contain your puppy to areas that are allowed.<br>  4-Exercise pen for providing an area to play safely outside the crate or kennel to learn housebreaking habits.<br>  5-Soft towels or baby blankets as they are the right size to start.<br>  6-Newspapers or puppy housebreaking pads if you so choose.<br>  7-Bowls for food and water, heavy pottery so they don't tip over.<br>  Stainless steel bowls tip easily but are easy to clean with clorox.<br>  8-Puppy No-tears shampoo, or Dial anti-bacterial liquid hand soap to start.

YnCUyvK7aa	Thumbs up for vegan4life.  The breeding tubercles are the most reliable way to tell, but you'll only see them on mature males in breeding condition.  You can also be able to tell by looking at their vent [anus].  <a href="http://www.bristol-aquarists.org.uk/goldfish/info/sexing-fs.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bristol-aquarists.org.uk/gold...</a>  But the fish should be around a year old, at least 2-3 inches long before you try.  <br>  <br>  I also wanted to comment on your other question, that using a conditioner won't affect your fish's scales.  It might get him to produce more of a slime coat, so whatever you're seeing is less noticeable, but it won't change things if the scales are normal or if he's got a parasite  [another possibility that wasn't mentioned].  Or maybe what was weird was that you were seeing the breeding tubercles, although these only appear on the gill covers and edges of the fins.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	there is no way to tell on gold fish males tend to be thinner|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	the girls are fatter with eggs sac bulges on the belly ..boys are smaller thin no puffyness|`|oG5HNFUOaa	If you aren't looking to breed them, I don't think it matters.

KxjUim7yaa	I think the collar would be chewed off by the other puppies. Wait on a collar until your pup comes home. The breeder should be able to know which one is yours and keep it for you. I like Hannah,Axel, and Rio
3zUqcLauaa	If you are getting a first dog, I would suggest a lab. German Shephards and Rottweilers are NOT for the first time owner. Both need a great deal of socialization and both are very protective and can try to dominate their owner. However, labs can also be very rambunctious...if you've ever read "Marley & Me" they behavior displayed by Marley is typical of many labs. However, if this is your first time owning a dog, i would STRONGLY advise against a German Shephard or a Rottweiler. They take a great deal of work and require an experienced dog owner.<br>  Because of puppy mills and laborador popularity, they are greatly overbred and I would suggest not buying a lab puppy from a store. They best place and the best thing you could do is to get your lab from a shelter, help save a life. They usually behave very well, too. But if you don't want to adopt a dog from a shelter, try a reputable breeder. And don't forget, adult dogs need love too, not just puppies! You can find adult labs at a shelter. Check petfinder.com|`|6RqjxUTnaa	Labs are great i have 6 they are awesome and really allot of work though<br>  <br>  german shepherds are great protective Dogs i have 1.<br>  <br>  Rottweilers are Cool they can be dangerous if raised wrong though.<br>  <br>  theese sites will help Out more.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/germanshepherd.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/germanshephe...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/labrador.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/labrador.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/rottweiler.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/rottweiler.h...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.seefido.com/html/first_time_dog_owner_tip.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.seefido.com/html/first_time_d...</a>|`|2u8teJkJaa	I would choose the Rott.

G. Shepherds and Rott's are ... what I call unforgiving type dogs.  If you're not a confident dog handler and you don't socialize these dogs really well you can mess them up pretty quicky and have aggression issues.<br>  <br>  Labs are very forgiving dogs.  You can do almost everything wrong and your lab will still be a pretty gentle soul.  <br>  <br>  So that's where I'd start.  Get a lab, go through raising puppy and some teaching of obedience and things and get used to working with a dog before you try one of the tougher breeds.  Make sure you find a good breeder though.  These days, everyone is breeding labs and not all of them are doing a good job with it.  Research your breeder and their breeding program before commiting to a puppy.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|KxjUim7yaa	I think the lab would be the easiest for you.

Ask friends who have dogs for recommendations, check the phone book, then drop in and check the kennels out for yourself.|`|eZDoQPg8aa	What we have done (the whole family has dogs including my daughter in law's family) is we keep all the dogs "acquainted" and rotate watching each others pets if the need arises.  <br>  <br>  We watched our daughter in law's brother's dog this past summer, my sister in law's dogs and are preparing the new baby of the clan for a visit in July.  My daughter in law brings the pup over every couple of weeks for a couple of hours and the "hounds" have a play date!  We have three of our own so one more isn't too bad or two small ones.  <br>  <br>  I personally don't like putting my animals in a kennel because they just put them in the cages and leave them there.  Imagine how terrifying that must be!  If we can't make arrangements, we take them with us or we don't go.....|`|AA11617586	I don't know where you are but you should look and see if there is a Camp Bow Wow in your area. They keep the dogs together and they get a lot of group play time. It's a doggy day care and overnight camp. They include some stuff for free and even do bathing (for extra).|`|2u8teJkJaa	What a mess. We have decided that if we can't take our dog then we don't go. I can understand that you want to keep them together but if you find two people that you trust to watch them separately then that is probably the best you can' do. I would not board my dog at a vets, you don't know what they may come home with and you don't know the person who is taking care of them.There are times when its a little inconvenient but I don't have any one that I can trust to take care of her properly. Since I am the Mommy then she is my responsibility.<br>  Good luck and have a nice trip.|`|6RqjxUTnaa	No dont go with Boarding thats Bad they can catch diseases and Stuff. They will be fine get the automatic feeders and waters.Also have a friend or neighbor to stop by Once a day and let out and Check up on them. When we go on Vacations we put out Food and extra water then either have a nieghbor or friend Check on them since we live in a small town if anything happens They most likley know were to reach Us. Our pets our outdoor Pets and we live in the country So i dont know about over where you live. thats the best thing to Do though.

It is someone who comes to your house to care for you dogs while you are away. They will feed, walk, and play with your dogs. The disadvantage is that they are usually only there for about 30 min to 1 hour a day, and they might be able to come twice a day. There are live in pet sitters, but they are more expensive. <br>  <br>  Find someone who will take both dogs into their home. It is like boarding, but the number of dogs is limited and it is a home environment. To find one, try posting an ad on Kijiji or cragislist. <br>  <br>  You could ask people about boarding kennels they have used and their experiences. Visit the kennel before you go. A vet or humane society may be able to offer their services or recommend someone.|`|7vJNHaskaa	There are some good boarding places where they will keep your dogs together, you just have to look around some more. Also, keep looking for someone who will take both of your dogs.<br>  <br>  If all else fails, maybe when you find a person for each of your dogs, you can ask if they will get together everyday to let the dogs enjoy each others company while you're gone.|`|BDRIeLqUaa	try another kennel- tour and ask other folks for rcmds.<br>  we love where we take ours- <br>  you just need to find a good one|`|J2G6ebThaa	i think you should just take it to a good kennel! and hope its having fun while you are away!|`|689974ada7bde2f5215c9931047f0747aa	I suggest a kennel like where we take my dog when we go out of town.  During the day they are a doggie daycare.  The dogs are outside in a big group running around all day.  Now, I live in Texas so they are outside, if you live up North they may be in an indoor play area.  I don't know where you live but Camp Bow Wow is always a good choice.<br>  <br>  Oh yea and they also have webcams so you can see your dogs over the internet!
sgr01OCkaa	Its good that you stay relaxed when he acts up. What you have to do is just sit deep in the saddle when he does this and sit it out. when he calms down enough ask him to walk up to what ever he is afraid of and let him have a good hard look at it and sniff it etc etc, until he is satisfied that it is not going to jump out and bite him and is relaxed enough to try and take a bite of grass or seems disinterested in it. Your problem is that he is still quite young and everything seems new and scary to him. You really just need to give him time to look at anything that scares him and let him work it out that these things aren't going to hurt him. You may also want to work on getting him to trust you more. The fact that you stay calm and this doesn't reassure him suggests that he doesn't fully trust you.|`|AA10986942	You are never going to get him to stop, it is just in his nature.  But DO NOT comfort him and pet him when he does it or when you are showing him something scary... that is just the opposite of what you should do.  You want him to have confidence in you as his leader.. just be firm and move on... if leading him and he spooks, pay no attention and just confidently keep walking, if you were to stop and baby him he will not look at you as his leader, he will think you are scared too.  When riding him, keep him busy so he does not have time to look around at scary things... try half passes at the walk, trot and canter, make him bend to the left for 3 or 4 strides then bend to the right for 3 or 4... just make stuff up, never just let him go forward without keeping his mind busy trying to do things for you..... if you do this he will spend a lot less time jumping at stupid things and concentrating on his work..  remember dont poo poo him or baby him over anything... walk him confidently past scary things, dont walk him up to something then stand there trying to convince him its harmless.... If you pet him and baby him when he reacts this way you are in fact rewarding him for this unwanted behavior.  My gelding would turn and bolt (which is pretty scary) when something scared him... I started making him work and concentrate when I was on him and he didnt have as much time to look around.  After a few years of this treatment he now will just spook in place.  Meaning he will just jump but not move his feet, when he does this I make him move and go to work right away... Trying to reasure him wont work, it will just make matters worse.  And I do not think 6 years old is so young either...  he is not a baby anymore...|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	Oh i hate when horses do this.<br>  I found out after buying my horse, that it was never sacked out as a young horse.  You have to do that.  Take a lunging whip, cut off the stringy, not hard part, and tie a plastic bag to that, you start touching it at the ground near the horse (someone experienced holding your horse if possible!) and work your way up the legs, then up to the withers, up the neck, up to the ears, back down to the tail, and keep going slowly until your horse is calm.  I find that the horses need consitancy, so when it spooks, urge it forward, keep circling it in that spot until it has no reaction to the thing it spooks at.  It doesnt matter what it spooks at.  Also, when it stops reacting, start petting it, in reassurance.  Hope I helped.|`|KeQOHakpaa	what i did with my spooky gelding was keep contact with one rein in particular. of course i had contact with both reins (english riding), but every couple of strides i would just wiggle my fingers in order to keep my horses attention so he was more focused on me and what we were doing rather than spooking. plus, keep a nice firm leg on your horse to keep him forward moving.|`|RloOJ43haa	1. He is still pretty young at 6. Some time may help.<br>  2. It's possible that there is something wrong with his eyesight so that things appear scary to him that might not otherwise be scary.|`|AA12048299	You've gotten some good advice on training/ behavioural help. I'm going to suggest you start by examining his physical being first, though.<br>  <br>  Check his diet. Cut the carbohydrates. Get him OFF grains, especially corn and oats. Put him on alfalfa pellets & beet pulp, with vegetable oil for fat. Google EPSM diet and you'll see a difference in 3 weeks.<br>  <br>  Supplement with a supplement that contains Vitamin B. I like This-Cal from Finish Line. Trust me, it will make a huge difference in 2 weeks if your horse was deficient. If not, you've only lost $19 to find out.<br>  <br>  Have his vision checked by an equine opthalmologist.<br>  <br>  Have him scoped for ulcers. Ulcers can be very painful. When horses are in pain, especially pain they can't escape from, they become very spooky, irritable, unresponsive to training, etc. If your horse wind sucks or cribs, bolts his feed, or is a picky eater , these also could be signs of ulcers. Only your veterinarian can tell you for sure by scoping him. Typically, the horse is fasted for 24 hours, then a scope is passed down into his empty stomach and they look for lesions or abrasions on the stomach.<br>  <br>  Have the vet do a full CBC/ Chem screen bloodwork. And check for Selenium deficiency. If deficient, the muscles will likely be sore, hard, and add to the horse acting 'spooky'. Supplement with vitamin E, as well. <br>  <br>  Lastly, have a saddle fitter professional check your saddle. Don't go by a trainer. Make it clear to the saddle fitter that you are NOT in the market to buy a new saddle (so they know they're not going to make a big sale by giving you their advice; you'll likely get a more honest opinion). If the saddle fits poorly, you'll get a spooky ride; see the above comment about the horse not being able to escape pain.<br>  <br>  Good luck and keep us posted.|`|iiNAJfGCaa	All horses are born with the "fight or flight" reflex. It sounds like your Morgan is really relying on his flight mechanism. It seems natural for him to spook at things that are scary, because that is what he has been programmed to do through evolution. He is not doing this to be naughty or to try to hurt you. <br>  <br>  You need to take the time to build up his confidence. A horse who would rather "fight" (ie face their fears) then "flight" (spook and run away) will be much easier to ride. Before you get on for a ride take your horse in hand and lead him all around the arena. If he spooks or looks at something make him walk right up to it. When he reaches out to sniff it, tell how how brave he is with a big pat or a treat. The same training applies under saddle. As soon as he spooks at something turn him back and make him walk up to it. If he refuses, hop down and lead him by hand... but don't let him go away until he has touched his nose to the thing that was scaring him. Then reward with a pat or a treat. <br>  <br>  This may seem time consuming, but it is a nearly foolproof way to de-spook your horse. Eventually he will come to realize that all of these scary things will not hurt him and if something DOES spook him he will have to face his fear before he can doing anything else. Good luck!|`|yjGuG33oaa	See a horse can sense what you are feeling ... you have already got it in your head he will spook so he will ...<br>  <br>  Just pretend its not there, don't look at it and pay no attention to it, act like it doesn't matter and your horse will sense your confidence and you will be fine ..|`|zI3Y7Pz5aa	like people, some horses just have very timid personalities.<br>  <br>  the only thing i can suggest is involve him in more situations that might scare him so he gets used to it. i have also heard that teaching them tricks and other obedience things can increase their confidence, hence making them less timid.|`|ZTCspx5saa	i did my animal report on morgan horses.... it means that maybe you need to walk by it alout and lunge him everywhere before you ride.. if he spooks get off and walk him up to it and tell him theres nothing to be afraid of..

Pretend like you don't notice what he is looking at and try and get his attention back to where it's supposed to be.  After you push him past the "big scary monster" it's helpful to circle past it again a few times.|`|EghHVkHEaa	I'm not sure there is such a thing as a totally spook-proof horse. I'm sure there are many horses who spook so infrequently that for all intents and purposes they are relatively spook-proof, but all horses certainly are spookable to some degree. I believe spooking has its roots in insecurity (DUH!). When we have a horse that trusts its human (or rather, its leader) it is far less likely to spook. By increasing the horse's trust in its human (or rather, its leader), you can tremendously lessen its tendency to spook. <br>  <br>  Some horses have vision problems which may cause excessive spookiness. Vision problems may come from things other than the eyes.. For instance, a sore back can cause vision problems by causing the head to be held at an exaggerated height. Too much dish in the face, roman nose, exaggerated quirk bumps, eyes located too far from the points of the face or located too close together, unusual colored eyes (perceive light reflections differently), you name it, all affect a horse's vision. When a horse's vision is affected it perceives things differently than normal visioned horses. I have ridden many white, and blue, eyed horses who reacted more strongly to very light-colored discarded appliances and furniture off the trail than brown-eyed ones do. It is almost as if the lighter colored objects appear bigger than life to them. <br>  <br>  Check this site out: <a href="http://marvwalker.com/despook.htm" rel="nofollow">http://marvwalker.com/despook.htm</a>|`|ecf159d9c2d48432e189d0cac81882e2aa	My horse is the same way - but by the sounds of it, mine is much less dramatic about it. <br>  <br>  We have a "bridge" made out of plywood and 2 x 4s leaning against the wall in our arena. It's been there, literally, for years. Always in the same spot unless it's pulled out so we can use it. 90% of the time we pass it, he stares at it like it might jump out and attack him. I usually bend him towards the inside of the arena so he can't look at it and he's fine. <br>  <br>  With your horse, if you haven't been in the same place for very long, give him a little time to adjust. <br>  <br>  He's also young. Lead him around and get him exposed to everything that's around. Desensitize him to his surroundings before you ride him.<br>  <br>  If you stay calm and ingore everything, he'll be more likely to do so too. With my horse, if he's in a particularly spooky mood, I find myself seeing something up ahead and thinking "Oh crap, here we go again." and then he does spook at it. But I eventually calm myself down and focus on my horse, stay calm and relaxed and pretend he's the calmest, most reliable horse ever - and he's usually calm and relaxed too.<br>  <br>  Play around with him - do a little bit of what everyone tells you - and see what works the best to calm him down. <br>  <br>  Maybe it's just extra energy, and if you lunge him before you ride he'll be better. Or maybe he really is spooky, and you should desensitize him to everything until he's calm about it on the ground before you ride him.<br>  <br>  Good luck. :)|`|1lp47N9aaa	I don't own a horse myself however, I have trained with them for a while.<br>  I've worked with a few horses that spook exactly the way your horse does. A few tips that I recommend to you are to give your horse more of an experience. You should lay out a bunch of completely different things that spook out your horse. Side walk your horse and encourage him/her to come closer. When your horse starts getting a little more comfortably approaching these items, walk. Repeat this step until you move to it's regular level of speed. By then your horse will most likely be adapted to the simple items of everyday life.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work.<br>  just surround your horse with these items as often as you can.<br>  (If your horse gets aggressive I recommend that you give it time before you continue training with this again)<br>  For example, lay out leaves and sticks (anything that spooks your horse) out where it sleeps. Or maybe where it eats. This will help your horse learn to deal with the things around it. Note that it is normal for your horse to freak out in the beginning a little. After a few minutes alone with these things that spook your horse he/she will be more comfortable having these things around.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped! Good Luck!|`|6bZXa0Reaa	When I got my horse he was around 6 or 7. And He wasn't fully trained. But i trained him myself and I am not a trainer or anything I just ride. But with your situatuation I would do the same as I did:<br>  1.Let your horse lose in the riding arena and let him sniff around. Keep a lunge whip with you to get him started.<br>  2. Once he has calmed down put a tarp on the ground(in the same arena) make sure the tarp is secure and not able to move. Then get your horse to run around again. and see what he does if he totally goes over there and walks over it or even sniffs it. Hook him up to a lead and walk him over it. Talk to him to keep him calm.<br>  3. Then if he succedd in that. You can then saddle him and then walk him over the tarp a couple of times. If he succedds over that then ride him over it.<br>  <br>  You can also do that 3 step process with speed poles.  BEcasue they are so tall just like trees. <br>  <br>  To keep him calm I just whistle outloud to keep him calm. My horses ears are always back when I do this but its okay becasue that means he is listening to it. Once in while too, rubb him on the neck or mane and tell him that he is a good boy, this helps a lot when you are going near stuff that you know he spooks around.<br>  <br>  To get him used to the stuff you ride around you also may want to walk him through it without a saddle on him and let him sniff it and if he doesnt get scareed or run away then you can saddle him and then walk him that same path way until he gets used to it once he is used to it then ride him near it.|`|NevKx5fzaa	haha i used to have the same ptomblem.... r u feeding him food that is high in protien??? that might be it.... or is he spooking just to try to scare you so you'll get off his back. never get off when he spooks show him ur NOT afraid and u WON"T get off.  u have to remember that horses are prey their only weapon is to run.. all there thinking is suriviol untill tommorrow... i also think he is tring to protect you from anything that might hurt you.. good luck i hope i could help!|`|zBT6Y0zgaa	What you need to do is get him used to all of the "scary" stuff.

JGq9rKBOaa	I've heard of all sorts of methods - listerine, witch hazel...here's a "recipe" from a Hamsterific member who has hamsters and gerbils.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hamsterific.com/MiteTreatment.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hamsterific.com/MiteTreatment...</a><br>  <br>  I've never tried that - I always use ivermectin drops from a vet, which for me has been 100% effective on small animals.<br>  <br>  Of course, neither of those things - the home remedy or the ivermectin - will work if the problem isn't really mites. All sorts of things can cause skin problems in critters - reactions to bedding, fungal infections, even food sensitivity. If you try the "home remedy" and there are no results, I'd definitely get to a vet at that point, since you either need a stronger treatment or you're not looking at mites.

NHs3LxlLaa	Okay. First off, great that you're going to heat your Betta's new home, too bad it's a bit small. I'd consider upgrading him but as long as you perform regular partial water changes, it might be okay.<br>  <br>  You can "cycle" a small tank but it's pointless, you just remove most of the water anyway.<br>  There's two ways you can change the water. <br>  <br>  The easier but more stressful for your fish way is to take out your Betta (put him in a cup) remove 95% of the water weekly and replace it with dechlorinated (leave it out for at least one hour) that's the same temperature as your Betta's old water.<br>  <br>  The harder but less stressful for your fish is to remove 15% of the water every two days and replace with clean water.<br>  <br>  Use a thermometer (a couple of bucks at your Local Fish Store [LFS]) as this will be far more accurate.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|asXq2cFDaa	You can cycle a 2 gallon tank, I have a fully cycled one with a male betta in it! Do a fishless cycle- <a href="http://www.cichlid-forum.com/articles/fishless_cycling.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.cichlid-forum.com/articles/fi...</a><br>  25% water changes once a week after the fish is in and cycled.|`|dJs2s9pfaa	No but I'd recommend 50% being that it is so small. I'm sure that it won't fully cycle but atleast you can save some of the beneficial bacteria. Just do these changes once a week and you'll be fine. They make a special water for bettas or you can just get betta conditioner. It sure helps alot!<br>  <br>  Oh and to answer your intial question on changing the water. I'd use a large cup or you can get a siphon hose with a bucket if you prefer. If you have substrate then definitely a small siphon hose to rid the deitrus from the substrate. <br>  <br>  As far as using warmer water I'd be very careful with that as sudden temp changes can be devastating to them. Just luke warm or room temp will be perfect.|`|wD9sdGhZaa	Changing the water is intimidating the first time you do it, but it's one of those things where you just have to do it once and after that it's very easy.  Bettas are pretty hardy and forgiving.<br>  <br>  Whenever I do water changes I put a little Stress Coat in there (they sell this at every pet store, lot of people use seachem prime as well) and wait for the water to approximate the temperature of the aquarium.  <br>  <br>  You can even buy pre-mixed "betta water" which is basically just tap water already-mixed with water conditioner and sold as a large water bottle.  If you didn't mind buying this every time, that would be one very easy solution here.<br>  <br>  Don't do full water changes though, just weekly partials...you could do 25%, a little tidying up, and that's that.<br>  <br>  Whatever you do...don't just put tap water in there.  You have to use water conditioner to remove chlorine/chloramine/heavy metals.|`|oTb67zNYaa	1/4 water changes use water as close to the temp of the tank as you can also I recommend that  you use aquasafe to get rid of chlorine|`|AtLdnZd5aa	just change 25% every week or two and remember a betta can almost live in a cup of stagnate water its whole life. it would be cruel to make one do that but they can.|`|zqVDJxUIaa	NEVER DO FULL WATER CHANGES! This will definitely harm your aquarium because it will kill all of the beneficial bacteria that convert harmful chemicals (such as ammonia) into harmless ones. For the first two weeks, I'd recommend removing and replacing 20% of the water. Before you add water, you must condition it with a tap water conditioner such as Aqua Plus to remove harmful chemicals such as chlorine. Also, ANY SIZE AQUARIUM GOES THROUGH THE CYCLING PROCESS! Since ammonia is given off of fish excretions, all aquariums with fish will experience the cycling process. Since your aquarium is new, I'd recommend using a product such as Hagen's Cycle, which introduces beneficial bacteria into your aquarium. <br>  Remember: NEVER change more than 40% of the water at a time.<br>  P.S. If you changed 100% of the water, I'd expect your betta to die within one week :(|`|H9Nvo2gxaa	you should get a thermometer for your tank. they cost about $1.50, then when you do a water change you see the temp of the tank before you remove water then when you get water from the tap try to get it as close to the original temp as possible. <br>  <br>  You should clean the 2 gallon every 4-5 days|`|7KxQXHzOaa	i'd take out about 3-4 cups to clean the tank also to prevent stress buy a bottle of stress coat<br>   good luck!!!

Rw7gi86Naa	You need to go back to what was working originally. Use a brand of litter that you know she has liked before--not something new. Cat's don't like it when we change their routine, and you've made many different changes recently. <br>  <br>  Make sure you scoop each box twice a day. Once a week the box needs to be empty and cleaned with a mild detergent (NO bleach or ammonia!), then rinse with very hot water. <br>  <br>  You might want to try two litter boxes in different places. Some older cats have trouble making it there in time. Is the box too deep? Sometimes older cats can have trouble getting into some boxes, also.<br>  <br>  Odor removing tips for accidents:<br>  Remember, a cat’s sense of smell is fourteen times stronger than that of a human. This is why it is so important for you to thoroughly clean the urine spots. Even if you can’t smell it, your cat probably still smells the urine in the carpet, and this can make them want to “re-mark” that spot over and over.<br>  <br>  To remove the smell of urine from just about anything, first clean it with some sort of soap or kitchen cleaner. Then clean it with lemon juice. If you don’t like the smell of lemon juice follow it up with a little bit of vanilla extract. One of the most effective formulas I’ve found for removing ANY odor was from Popular Science Magazine. Mix 1 quart of Hydrogen Peroxide, with 1/4 cup of Baking Soda, and one tablespoon of liquid dishwashing soap. Saturate the affected area, rinse thoroughly with clean water, and the smell is gone. This is non-toxic and safe for your animals and children, and those with allergies. This is especially helpful for removing skunk odor from your outdoor animals. As always, test a small portion of fabric for color fastness, before treating a large area. <br>  <br>  What Won’t Work… There are many home remedies for treating pet stains and odors, and let me stress that most of them are not too bad as far as removing odors for humans’ noses. Vinegar, ammonia, baking soda, laundry detergents, lemon juice, fabric softeners, and commercial strength pet stain removers are all great for removing the odors that humans can smell. However; you will need more to remove the odor for your cat’s nose. An enzymatic cleaner is the best answer, but it is slow and may take more than one application, (Nature’s Miracle is one of them). The Hydrogen Peroxide/Baking Soda combo is fast, but can alter the colors of some fabrics. In the end, you must decide which application is best for your situation. <br>  <br>  Even if you clean a pet stain with soap and water certain micro-organisms remain behind and your pet can smell them. Enzymatic Cleaners are designed to completely eliminate the source of the odor by using enzymes to eat away the micro-organisms that cause the odor. The one drawback to these cleaners is that they are slow; it could take several weeks for them to completely eliminate an odor. Enzymantic Cleaners are available at most pet stores, organic/natural/health food stores, and even some hardware stores. You can also ask your vet for suppliers.<br>  <br>  **Never steam clean a stain. That will only make the stain worse!**|`|tL73W0VZaa	Cats will frequently refuse to use the litter box if the litter is scented or perfumed. Make sure that your litter is unscented. Also, changing the litter once a week is fine, but you need to sift the box at least once or twice a day. Remember: cats have a sense of smell that is many, many times more sensitive than ours, odors that are barely noticeable to us can be nearly unbearable to them.|`|0Gyrecxxaa	The first thing you suspected was a UTI, good for you!!  The next thing I'd be looking at is whether or not here have been any recent changes in your household that could have created stress for her, ie: new pet...someone moved out, etc. The slightest things can sometimes set them off. Is she peeing on all articles of clothing or certain ones that would have certain scents?<br>    Try locking her in a small, confined space such as a bathroom and see if she still refuses to use the box. You've ruled out pretty much everything else..cat litter, etc...so if confining her doesn't work I would really wonder if there is a more serious problem internally and more testing should be done.|`|KLMo9jbzaa	Try changing the litter daily. they don't like a dirty litter box.|`|0kiYeWA8aa	yea i would suggest cleaning it more often than once a week|`|gYLkvAnjaa	Cats are definately strange little animals.  I've had cats all my life an currently own three.  I've worked for a veterinarian before and we did a lot of boarding, so you're not the only one with this issue.  It's hard to say why cats won't use a litter box, but it could be a lot of reasons why.  I would try using a fine grain clumping litter or a clay, big grain litter, depending on which you haven't used before.  Sometimes cats don't like the fine grain litter because it sticks to their feet.  And on the other side, sometimes they don't like the larger grain litter because it has a lot of dust.  Either way, try one you haven't used before.  Also, don't use scented litter.  Cats don't necessarily like the smell of flowers and perfumes where they pee.  I wouldn't change the location of the litter box around too much, because cats like to pee and poop in the same spot.  Try keeping the basement floor clean of any clothing, blankets, etc.  Also, check the litter box several times throughout the day and clean it whenever you see pee or poop.  A lot of cats won't use the litterbox if it has even the slightest amount of waste.  Other than that, I really don't know what else to recommend.    It could be one of countless reasons why she won't go.  Keep trying different things though, you're sure to get it.

If you go to www.google.com and type in the local largest city name and the word "aquarium club", you'll get a whole list of all the local fish clubs.

If under the tail, there is only the cat's bum, then it is a female. <br>  <br>  If it's a female, you will have no way of knowing if it is spayed until you take it to the vet, so if your cat isn't neutored, definitely keep them separate. Even if the cat is a male, I would still keep the two cats apart. Feral cats can carry a whole host of illnesses that, while they don't pose a threat to humans, can easily infect other cats.

iVQULHqYaa	Separation Anxiety.<br>  <br>  If your dog suffers from separation anxiety, or if you anticipate this don’t give him free access to every room in your house when you leave him. . If you allow him free access you are doubling his burden. As well as having separation anxiety he will think that he has to guard every room in your house. <br>  <br>  If he is restricted to one room he will not see you leave. You could also con him into thinking that you are always at home by carrying out the following procedure.<br>  <br>  Try to do this when you are at home all day, or in the evening when you are there. After your dog has had a long walk, put him in a room with his comfortable bed, this should be a room where you will leave him if you need to go out and where your dog will sleep at night. <br>  <br>  Walk out of the room and close the door.  Open the door immediately and go back into his room, close the door behind you and try to ignore him.  Pretend or actually do something which excludes your dog, for example if he is in the bathroom you could do a bit a cleaning for a couple of minutes. Then walk out of the room, go back again immediately and continue with the pretence. Keep doing this to ensure that your dog won’t feel isolated and eventually leave a small gap before you go into his room again. Over a period of days increase the gap before going back into his room. When you know that your dog is asleep stop going into the room, however you MUST try to go onto the room before he wakes up and starts to cry. If you carry out this procedure for a couple of days, your dog will always think that you are at the other side of the door. I do this when I get a new puppy and this PREVENTS separation anxiety.<br>  Don’t neglect his long walks and playtime in the garden whilst you are re-training him, he needs his fun<br>  When you are leaving your dog on his own please don’t make a dramatic exit, or this will give the game away. Simply put him into his room and walk out. When you come home don’t give him a big hello, just walk into his room and let him out for a pee. You can then play with him and give him cuddles.<br>  <br>  Please don’t get a dog if it has to be left alone all day. Try to get a friend or a professional to take him out for pees and poos, if you need to leave him for any length of time...|`|Cx0IAMGVaa	The humane society has a great article regarding separation anxiety.

B6zl0AJDaa	Some people are just distructive by nature.  Doing this makes them think that they did something that pissed somebody off and it did, YOU!<br>  <br>  Cameras or a good watch dog works wonders!|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	how can you be sure that people snuck in?  Maybe the horses did something foolish?<br>  If someone did, then I am guessing that they are either just drunk and wanted to go do something, or they just wanted to bug you, or they maybe wanted to put horse hair on their zippers...?<br>  Wierd situation!|`|8bTder08aa	If these were show horses, I would think that the most likely explanations were show-ring rivals or possibly a disgruntled ex-employee.  Has anyone who works at the barn been fired or suddenly quit?<br>  <br>  Otherwise...might be someone wanting to throw a scare into the barn management;  just curious, has whoever is in charge been looking into buying a video security system recently?  If someone has, it might be that this is an attempt to panic your barn manager or owner into buying a system or subscribing to a security service.<br>  <br>  Or it might just be mischief.  Somebody doing it on a dare, someone drunk, who knows. <br>  <br>  Just be glad it wasn't worse.  At one barn I was at, someone went in and let three of the horses out one night.  I found them wandering around when I arrived at 5:00 AM to ride my horse.|`|RloOJ43haa	Did you report this to the local sheriff?<br>  <br>  Something similar happened to me many years ago at a boarding stable. Not knowing what else to do, we reported it to the sheriff as a break in. As the sheriff investigated, he discovered that interfering with someone else's livestock is a FELONY. (There is a legal term, but I have forgotten now what it was.) Since he now had a felony crime, he started questioning the people around the neighborhood. It turns out that it was just some bored kids who got into the barn. We decided not to prosecute if they cleaned every stall in the barn. After stripping 20 stalls, I think they learned their lesson. <br>  <br>  Also, you probably need to install a security system, or at least a webcam.|`|Xobbmd7Saa	Was it a rival barn? That is slimy and you can press charges. It may have been to spook your horses.<br>  <br>  Put surveillance cameras up and lock the barn when nobody is around. I hope you find out and press charges for trespassing.|`|Awo7g1K4aa	Keep a security camera in your barn.  And who knows why they want it.|`|T6d1NOwMaa	Some kind of Wiccan ritual?|`|DLxh9CANaa	Try locking your barn doors at night, and install dusk to dawn security lights ( we have one on both ends of our barn, and they work great), and if necessary, put in a closed circuit camera. You can also get a watch dog, and let him or her loose in the barnyard at night. Put up some signs, too, ones which warn people about trespassing and about horses which bite or kick. " Enter at YOUR OWN RISK" signs are also a good investment in a case like this. <br>  <br>  As for why someone wants tail hair, there are lots of reasons. It can be used to make ropes, to make bracelets, and as part of religious rituals.|`|bI7wMCJXaa	Sounds like some punk kids that did it because they could, or possibly someone who doesn't like you or your horse's.<br>  <br>  I am going to guess that the person who claimed Wiccan ritual isn't a Wiccan otherwise s/he would know the rede stating "Harm none and do what ye will" and it's taken seriously by serious practitioners. Like me.<br>  <br>  When my horse had to be put down I cut the long hair off his tail beneath and muscle and bone and used some of it to make jewelry so I had something to remember him by other than pictures. Since there is no connection between the people cutting the tails and the horses I would say that this is not the case.|`|bdwjN1MKaa	wow i would be mad too, first of all get a security camera in your barn, or sleep out in the barn until you can get it, keep a gun in case i know it sounds crazy but just do it. this happened to me only the people cut the mane almost all the way off, just one horse though, we don't know completely why but we think it was because they were some kind of religion or something that thought horse hair was very sacred. hope this helps  and i hope you catch them. good luck!|`|iiNAJfGCaa	This is an act of vandalism. You need to contact your local police department and file a report. It sounds like these people where being intentionally cruel. It also sounds like they may have known these horses if they where able to get in so easily and cut their tails in the first place.|`|GsnchSsmaa	people use horse hair for alot of things like bracelets, fake tails, and even wigs for humans. Maybe they wanted to sell it for some extra cash or maybe they were just pranksters who thought it would be funny. Its not of course|`|F0nRMmmlaa	This is happening where I live- in Colorado! It is so mean and they take so long to grow! Horses tails can sell for a lot of money so they probably are using it to sell them :( I am so sorry :(|`|xLNzdxsOaa	My friend had that happen to her, it turns out it was a rival from another barn who wanted to get back at her. Hope you catch them!|`|AC0aZd3saa	Wow i've had my horses mane hacked of before(grr) but i knew who did it and confronted them about it, long story short she owned the horse a few owners b4 me and never had any of it i was so cranky.<br>  <br>  Any who, They've done quiet well to get into the stalls with theses "wild horses" and being "wild horses" why would you go and hack of there tails, there spose to be crazy but yet a few people or a person have managed to suceed in hackoing there tails? Maybe you should re-consider the "wild, crazy" prefixes for these horses because either you nor anyone at your stable is capable of handiling them or you nor anyone at your stable is confident in handiling the horses.<br>  <br>  EDIT:::: Why is everyone missing the point of these so called "WILD HORSES"???????????????|`|RUxRNsf4aa	That EXACT same thing happened to me, and trust me, its no laughing matter.<br>  <br>  After the incident at my barn, I asked around and found out that people cut off long tails and make them into horse show tails. (like the ones that you attach to your horses tail for a show to make it appear thicker and more full). Actually our horses manes were cut too, but I dont even think that people wear fake manes for shows, so I dont know what they wanted that for. I guess its a compliment that your horses had good tails! but it really does suck, and they can make a ton of money off of those tails. Sorry about the situation. I hope your horses dont have a show anytime soon.<br>  <br>  P.S. Whats worse is that at the local tack shop about two months later their were 4 tails (all the ones cut off) and they looked IDENTICAL to our horses tail. One was even uniquely colored - brown with silver and tan hairs in it - just like our arabian. They costed 100 bucks each. Needless to say, I was p*ssed. But I wasnt really sure what to do about it.<br>  <br>  Edit-------<br>  Wow Greg B., a felony?! I should have done something...|`|xYyPDyrVaa	horse hair to Native Americans(like me), is very sacred.<br>  taking the hair, a little bit and braiding it into your own hair bonds YOU with the horse. cutting off a little bit of your hair and braiding it in the horse's mane bonds THE HORSE with you.<br>  but thats what we think.<br>  <br>  some people do that just to pull a prank.<br>  so, you can get a dog called a Great Pyrenees, raise it as a puppy inside the barn with the horses, they will defend the horses with their life if need be. you could put a padlock on your barn, or you can install a security system. or surveilance.<br>  good luck!|`|cZbRmV5raa	Im not sure they could be from a rival barn and it could just be some kids wanting to mess with people. i really dont know why they would want the hair but i cant belive people would do this is like i said it could be a rival barn or the kids from a rival barn just trying to prove that they are better than you i would suggeast having a camera installed or a motion detector like they had at my barn so that if anyone tried to sneak in the alarm would go off and also lock the doors and any way in is all that i can tell you|`|1MBf5yeoaa	Could just be some punk kids being stupid. Could be another horse person jealous of those horses. Or someone made someone else really mad. I would hide a camera in the barn for a few days. But dont tell anyone you're doing it. Or if you dont have a camera hide like a mini DVR (Digital Voice Recorder) thats what we did at our barn when someone was stealing our hay|`|LOH6UVh7aa	WoW! That sucks!! I'm very sorry! People are nuttsss!!!!!  Just food for thought  Guineas are a GREAT watch bird!! They are a little bigger then a chicken. They are very friendly & you can eat their eggs. They are quite good!  But they will make a weird sound when something, anything comes in your yard! You can get one rather cheap from  Murry McMurry hatchery.  Good luck!|`|MtmpOqZ7aa	No ideas but we have had several horses over the past year that have come in wither with banged tails, or half of their tails missing.|`|1lE3FLqOaa	wow that sucks i would be mad too.|`|n2dUmfcQaa	to put on there horses tails for show season!

kUlLTVR0aa	From what I've read previously they only bark coming in and going out. Perhaps you should tell them 'no' when they begin to bark as they go out and not let them out until until they stop and are calm. Eventually they will get the message. Letting them out one at a time, as opposed to together might help during this time. You can try the same method for them to come back in although your neighbor may get angry again as they might be barking longer while trying this. I don't know much about shock collars so I can't help much there but possibly you could just try it only when they go in and out then switch to a normal collar that might work. Good luck.|`|ZSXstSXBaa	my dog has an adjustable shock collar that has a remote and a beep, too. If you beep then shock after a few times they will get the point. Beeping- I'm doing something bad, Shocking- I have to stop. I barely ever have to shock her because she knows that if she doesn't stop then there are consequences. I wouldn't get the collars that spray though because it can irritate your dogs nose and/or they could be allergic to the chemicals. For all the people that are against shock collars you also have to think that a dogs skin is thicker and they are more resistant to pain! When you were a child your parents disciplined you through spankings, right. Same concept only your dog is not scared of you because you're beating them. As long as you don't put it at a voltage too high for their weight/size then you are okay. You can also ask your vet the proper amount of voltage to use and they can suggest a brand also. Just make sure you get one with the adjustable strength. You can also look into training if you ultimately decide that you are against shocking.  If you do decide to use a shock collar make sure that you put it on but don't make it do anything for like a week so your dog can get used to having the collar on and so that when you do start using it your dog doesn't know that it's the collar that is the cause.|`|kvHqnR5Haa	If this is happening when you are not at home it may be beneficial to crate your dogs.  I know my little guy barks for a few minutes after I leave but he quiets down after a few minutes, and I don't have neighbors quite close enough to be bothered by it.  But maybe they will calm down a bit if you put them in a crate.  Also, instead of the shock collars they have citronella collars than spray them when they bark, but I have heard they are bery bulky so if you have small dogs they might be too uncomfortable.  Good luck!|`|ndHL0IJpaa	Our neighbours have complained too, we have asked them what their childrens bed time is and we kept the dog in during that time, and only let him out once after, late at night we go out with him and tell him off every time he barks at anything. During the day, when he is out by himself, our neighbours don't mind, but seeing as yours do, I would every time he barks, bang on the window and shout no. I do this during the day, it shocks my dog because he didn't know I was watching him, let alone being told off through the window!! So, there are definitely ways around a shock collar. Talk to your neighbours though, I took round some chocolates and asked what times was it worse, is it ok during the day and that they should be patient because training my dog not to bark outside will take a while. Also, on the plus side, the neighbours can't really complain unless your dogs are barking during the hours of 11 at night and 7 am. Although if it is highly excessive barking, they can complain during the day, but probably won't get very far. Good Luck!|`|k5mUMLJPaa	I have never had this problem as I live in the country but I see where you are coming from.  There are a few things I would try first before the shock collar a squirt bottle can help but you must be there to use it.  A pop can that is empty can be fill with a small amount of pocket change and duct tape over the top can be shaken to distract to dogs. If these things do not work try only letting your dogs out when you are there to supervise and crating them when you are gone to work or are out so they do not run wild in the house.  dog crates are less costly than a shock collar any way|`|NmtuxgYcaa	We have a shock collar on our beagle becuase he howls very loudly and we live in an apt it only shocks when he barks and they dont hurt them it just scares them. Ask your vet about it or go to your local petstore like petsmart (THE BEST!)|`|okAYAGvXaa	Who wouldn't be furious with dogs barking for nothing?<br>  Anyway, the use of "shock" collar is NOT appropriate.<br>  Shock yourself, first.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	The dogs don't need shock collars, they need training and a lot more exercise than they're currently getting.|`|Fyx3gS1Kaa	Most dogs that are subjected to these collars do not make the connection between their action and the punishment. It simply masks that problem during the times the collar is in place. Also some dogs tend to develop aggressive behaviors due to the confusion of the circumstances. I would advise you to do training techniques (consult a professional or watch videos. "Its me or the Dog" is a great show with an outstanding trainer.)<br>  <br>  You would never put a shock device on your children for yelling so i dont believe its appropriate for your furry children.|`|32b5862608cd641eff2b289e3a95ca58aa	I don't agree with shock collars either because a dog doesn't deserve to be punished for doing what comes naturally.  But excessive barking is due to lack of training...and maybe even boredom or neglect.|`|n8jrLDblaa	Does this happen when you're home? <br>  <br>  E-collars can be helpful, but only in the more extreme situations IMO. You need to do some studying. WHAT do they bark at? WHEN do they bark? <br>  <br>  Try a citronella collar first...or just some adequate training.<br>  <br>  And just for the record, e-collars do not cause aggressive behaviors. It's a quick zap...not like a damn tazer. Not so much a correction as a distraction (depending on the level used)|`|AoSeHXeQaa	Senseless barking bugs me, too :o)<br>  Which is why I have always taught my dogs to stop barking when I tell them to.  Do you tell your dogs to stop?<br>  <br>  First, when your dogs bark, you need to get up and see why they are barking.  They may have a good reason to bark, and dogs can learn when it is acceptable to bark, and when it is not.<br>  <br>  If they do not have a good reason to bark, tell them to stop. <br>  <br>  If they ignore you, and continue barking, walk over to them and give them a firm touch, and tell them to stop, again.<br>  <br>  If they still wont listen to you, then put a leash on them, and take them inside.<br>  <br>  That should be the end of the barking....no shocking required.|`|YLYAo2zmaa	I have seen the effects of a shock collar on a friends dog and I have never felt so sorry for any animal in my life, it happened to be a beagle, and the poor thing was a nervous wreck. I think he was affected for life.( not one he got from me either, I would never let him have one of mine) They are cruel.<br>  <br>  Edit: Princess Sarah I did not mean to give you a thumbs up. I meant to give you aTD|`|T8OFsBUUaa	Honestly, if you use a shock collar, you will have dogs that bark and that are aggressive, too.<br>  <br>  consult with a trainer near you on solutions that aren't painful and terrifying.|`|nmercOm7aa	Have you tried training your dog? What about bringing them inside when you are not home? <br>  Your dogs are probably bored. Pay attention to them, walk them, bring them inside to spend time with you.

6KxBqnstaa	the best thing you can do for this bird is to call a wildlife rehabber in your area. Get number from local vet or the DEC. The rehabber may come and get it or ask you to catch it with a net. The wing could be broken especially if it hangs lower than the other. Some can be fixed some cannot. Could have a bb in it or received a bite from a cat or other animal. they will evaluate and get the bird the help it needs. This is free for all wildlife. They will rehab if able and release into wild when ready. If to injured may be used as a teaching bird or put to sleep. Another option is to make a safe place for it outside if possible with all the needs met and keep in there. Best to get to rehabber though. Good luck and so good of you to help it.|`|4iGs4zUkaa	I think you should catch it and take care of it. I certainly do all the time.   That I can remember I have saved a total of four little brown birds, a baby blue jay, a love bird and a baby owl. Oh and a baby eagle fell on our backyard once and we picked it up and took it to the veterinarian because its wing was hurt. Anyways after you nurse it back to health you feel a great sense of accomplishment and the birds I saved always turned out okay! :)|`|hHAdA9V9aa	I'm afraid of it's wing is broken the best thing to do would be to put it out of it's misery but it sounds like the little guy hasn't given up yet! If he's doing ok I wouldn't interfere just make sure you keep an eye on his comings and goings. It would be better if he wasn't left stranded on the floor to suffer a painful death.|`|9696d265a6939e3f0b0d367627909159aa	It sounds like he's doing well on his own.  I'm sure you are providing a huge help just by providing him with the feeder.|`|enC9TvxUaa	-Call around for a shelter who can deal with wild animals.  They will normally come right to the house and get the bird in the safest way possible.  They may 'request' a small donation to help with expenses, so please be prepared to help them help out the little guy.  I am just outside of Houston, and I know we found just such an organization by calling the homane society when we found a baby squirrell.  The humane sopciety could not help, but referred us to them.  Ususllay a family that cares so much it hurts!|`|EJpiaCMQaa	It would be best to take the bird to a licensed wildlife rehabilitator or a vet for treatment.  You can call your local animal shelter to find wildlife rehabilitators.  Find a cardboard box to keep the bird in and poke holes in the box so the bird can breathe.  As for catching the bird, I would suggest approaching the bird slowly and gently dropping a towel over it.  Once you have caught the bird, place it in the cardboard box.  Keep the bird in a warm place.  Don't try and feed the bird or care for it.  Take it to the vet or wildlife rehabilitator in a warm car.  Rehabbers usually release the bird once it is well where it was found.  Good luck to you and your feathered friend.
bIaywrBCaa	I am a lifetime owner and lover of Chihuahuas. I have never seen this.

I think it is just her.|`|6y8Of7fkaa	I don't have a chihuahua but my mother's oldest dog does this because he competes for his food. I had a dog when I lived there and when i moved my Mom was sad so she bought a female dog so he has always had to compete. He's not as extreme as your chihuahua. It's kind of funny but I wouldn't worry about it as long as she is in good shape she's fine with her silliness.|`|bodEnkESaa	hi, one of my chihuahua's(simba) has the same problem. he will not take food out of someones hand very often, and even sometimes when the food is dropped on the floor. hes always been like this. His brothers and parents who belong to my brother are all energetic chihuahuas unlike simba. He is very scared of everything, sleeps all the time and is very mopey lol. When he is outside he can be happy but inside he acts very sluggish. but he seems fine. i dont know about the water vs. food problem but i think they will be fine.
WAOkgdj6aa	Bloody stools in cats can be attributable to a variety of underlying causes. While red blood in small quantities, sometimes mixed with mucous, is fairly common in cats, it is always best to consult your veterinarian to pursue a diagnosis.<br>  <br>  Some things to consider:<br>  <br>  1. Blood in a cat's stool can often times be indicative of the cat having ingested Warfarin which is used in mouse and rat poison. If you suspect this is the case, take your cat to the Vet immediately. Depression is generally evident when a cat ingests enough of the toxin to cause bleeding.<br>  <br>  2. Is the cat on a medication which may be the cause.<br>  <br>  3. Dietary - Blood in a cat's stool is not uncommon when bowel movements are hard or dry, which may be attributable diet. Consider changing to a low fat/moderate fiber food or one that is highly digestible.|`|ELkswWpCaa	Well it's a he- so it could be urinary tract infection. Take him to the vet immediately. My cat had this and we almost lost him. Also if it continues happening make sure it isn't urinary tract disease or an internal infection.

If it's STILL happening next week- take Him to the Vet...|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	Bloody stool = trip to the vet.  It could be nothing but it could be something.  I couldn't rest until I knew what was going on.  There are several reasons it could be happening and only a vet exam will uncover the problem.
VwxX8kDRaa	How does she react when she's separated from you in other situations?  It sounds like an attachment issue rather than just a door one.  If that's the case, you'll need to train her that it's alright to be away from you as well.<br>  <br>  <br>  As for the door:<br>  <br>  Scratching has become a signal that she wants to come back in.  She does the behavior and you succumb.  The way to train her not to scratch is simply to refuse to let her back in while she's doing it.  The moment she stops to take a break, you open the door and praise her.  Then put her back outside, close the door, and repeat the procedure.  At the end on the lesson, go outside together and come back in together.<br>  <br>  <br>  As for going away from you when you're outside:<br>  <br>  Try treats.  Put one on the end of a pole and train her to go further and further away from you to retrieve it, praising her each time.  Then try balls and other such things that you can throw and she can go get.  One trick is to put a treat inside a hole in a dog toy (like peanut butter) and use that as an added incentive.<br>  <br>  As she gets older and more comfortable being away from you, she'll be ok with being left outside without you.|`|1WmDOPGtaa	It seems to me this might be a bit of an insecurity issue; she doesn't feel confident out there without you.  How long were you leaving her out before she picked up this habit?  It may not have been "too long" for a dog in general, but too long for a pup her age.  <br>  <br>  If it were me, I would start going out there with her.  As she builds confidence and begins to roam on her own, sneak inside for just a few seconds (at first, slowly build up).  Then open the door and invite her and the other dog in.

Did you know that it takes hours to train a pup to do what yours does naturally? Please don't discourage her in this practice, in fact praise her up to the hilt - then start training her other tricks - she's obviously a keen and eager pupil!!! As for your door, there are clear, plastic or metal panels you can buy from any D.I.Y.,stores that are meant to be screwed onto an inside door just above the door handle to prevent hand marks from pushing the door open but you can use them outside. Before you put the panel on i'd make good the scratch marks she's already left in case water or moisture destroys the whole door - sand the bit of door down, fill in deep scratches with a good wood filler then paint over with the original door colour then once thats dry apply the new panel exactly where she's scratching now but can i give you a tip? If she's going to grow up to be a tall lady, don't glue the panel on because as she grow's up, her scratch marks will get higher - its better to screw the panel on so that it can be moved up as she grows up! All you'll have to do as she grows is remove the panel, fill in the little screw holes and repaint then move the panel up a bit! Well done for picking the cleverest pup in the litter ha ha, best of luck.|`|5M0FBU89aa	They make pet doors for sliding class doors. They're  about 8" wide and just slip in the door frame.

KEYgd73saa	I agree with you-- you absolutely can keep the Bala alone.  However, you will find it to be far more stressed, making it far more nippy, making it far more problematic with docile fish like Angels and Brown Knives.  In a 55 gallon tank, I'd not keep more than 5 Angels plus your other fish, and if you plan to keep a decent school of Bala Sharks, I'd really not recommend you keep more than 3 Angels.  Make sure you've got a new home for the Bala by the time it's about 7-8", as it will be so hyperactive that it will need absurd amounts of space (upwards of 5 horizontal feet of swimming space).
3bf821ff353c216ffc93ff7a91b60828aa	That's part of their "defect", they're mouths don't close.  But, as you said, it doesn't hamper them eating, nor biting you if they want to.  Mine can deliver a pretty good pinch when they want to.<br>  <br>  The black spot is nothing to worry about.  They will get what's commonly called "black spot disease", or it used to be called that anyway.  Black marks can show up if their stressed-from being bullied, poor water quality, etc.  or it sometimes shows up during breeding/spawning time.  Generally nothing to worry about, it'll go away on it's own.  But, do be sure to check the water quality-make sure ammonia and nitrites are at 0 ppm, nitrates under 20 ppm.  And, make sure it's not being picked on by other fish.  Other then that, I wouldn't worry about it.<br>  <br>  Doesn't sound like it was dyed.  And, I don't believe Petsmart sells dyed fish-though could be wrong on that one.  I DO know they seriously overcharge for their blood parrots though.  They charge 25.00 for ones that are already in their orange color, and only 8.00 for the smaller ones that still have their juvenile color and spots.  It really annoys me, because they will all eventually turn that orange color.....hopefully you didn't buy the more expensive one......<br>  .|`|QrjjiOgTaa	ya they are some sort of lab created hybrid so their mouths don't close and it looks like a beak, like a parrot ::people do crazy things in the sake of cuteness:: all the parrots i have sceen have mouths like that. i believe fish change color. i got a parrot that was dyed with the words "i love you" from a friend who was moving away. my parrot is now all white with a pinkish tinge, no dye visible. sometimes she gets black spots on her tail and then they go away. fish change color. i think maybe feeding her color enhanceing pellets will change her color too, they change color when stressed too. or.......maybe thats just her natural coloration. i have sceen parrots with black spots all over them and they never go away. i think if shes eating, shes fine.
F3FrZ7eAaa	For a Children's Python, he will be sufficient in a 20 gallon long tank. And they do not get as big as the first people are saying-- they are the second smallest breed of python. Yes, you can use a fish tank for reptiles, but never a reptile tank for fish.|`|c4d63478f0175c245353b6222ab7a81eaa	No you need a reptile tank with a heat lamp and you need the right supplies for it, Pythons do not stay small and they live for many many years. I recommend you look into them and how to care for them before you buy one. They also have to eat small newborn baby mice called pinkies when they are small and it is better to feed them frozen mice that have been thawed out. Never give it a live mouse because the mouse could harm the snake in some way. Snakes do not always make a good pet, it depends on the personality of the snake and pythons are more apt to bite than say a red tailed boa. Please do your research on how to care for a snake before you buy one.|`|xr1n9bMUaa	You will need a minimum of a 20 gallon tank for a baby, but it will get really BIG so maybe a 40 gallon tank which get into the $100 range and you probably can use a fish tank, but you should make sure with your local petstore or where ever you plan to get it for them.|`|6j9EZXGWaa	A 30 gallon tank would house either of these snakes well.

aCqSF87Raa	I would first introduce them to one another in a neutral area, like a park. See how they do on lead there for a walk. Watch for stiffness in the body, high stiff tails, pinned or highly perked ears, bared teeth, ruffled fur. Once they're comfortable around one another (IE don't seem as interested) try taking them to your house.<br>  <br>  I would schedule several "sleep overs" to see if you can "for sure" handle both dogs. See how they do during that initial meet day, then a few days later have the new dog spend the night. Do it about three times and lengthen each stay to see how your dog reacts.<br>  <br>  Some dogs do fine with occasional visitors or park play mates, but when the other dog stays the night or longer than a day or two you start to see behaviors. If that's the case, talk to a trainer. But i wouldn't commit just yet until you know what your dog will do.<br>  <br>  When you have both dogs, pay them equal attention. Feed them separately to avoid food aggression or possession. Offer a few toys to each dog and watch for any possessive behaviors. There may be a few scuffles but as long as they don't latch on, there's no blood, or drag the scuffle on i wouldn't get in between them. They will need to work out who's boss.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://leerburg.com/introducingdogs.htm" rel="nofollow">http://leerburg.com/introducingdogs.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://www.paw-rescue.org/dog_guide.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.paw-rescue.org/dog_guide.php</a><br>  <a href="http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_care/our_pets_for_life_program/dog_behavior_tip_sheets/introducing_pets_to_a_new_dog.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_care/our_pe...</a>|`|G4N7cSOYaa	It depends. Is your dog good around other dogs? I just got a new puppy a few months ago and had no problems at all. It took them a couple of hours to get used to each other (actually, my dog was fine, the puppy was just nervous) but I also know people who the dogs don't like each other at frist. I would just keep an eye on them and don't leave them alone for a while until you are sure they are fine together!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|3zUqcLauaa	Yes! we just got a  new dog two days ago. The first thing you need to do is set up a room for the new dog with an expandable gate and keep it in their for a couple of days so your old dog and new dog can sniff each other out with the safety of the gate. I know it sounds harsh, but we tried letting our new dog and old dog meet each other without doing that and the results were disastrous! Also, give your old dog lots and lots of attention or he will grow jealous and grow to resent the new dog.|`|D1beU6MPaa	If they are the same sex, you may be in for problems. And since your Retriever is twelve-years-old, you may still have problems even if they are opposite sexed. The Retriever is used to being the only dog and the Alpha. Putting a new dog in the mix may not be well received. Take time and socialize them and see if they are going to get along. Sometimes it works, and other times it doesn't. But be careful with the introductions. Good luck

Ow6lKFXiaa	Don't change until 12 months.  Then mix the adult food with the kitten food at a ratio of about 1 part adult to 3 parts kitten.  After 2-3 days up it to half and half, 2-3 days later up it again to 3 parts adult to one part kitten, and then 2-3 later to full adult.  Do this over a 1-1/2 to 2 week period to give his/her taste buds, sense of smell, and digestive system a chance to acclimate to the new diet.<br>  <br>  This is exactly what I've done with my many cats throughout my life.  Kittens are babies and must stay on baby food until they reach physical maturity to ensure proper nutrients required for growth. A 9-month old is considered the beginning of kitty teenage phase.  By 12 months your little love will be a young adult ready to take on the world...and what's left of your curtains, and your dog, and your furniture, and your bed, and your sleep...oh wait, she's been doing that since the day your brought her home.

Notice that rats living in enclosed environments typically defecate in a corner even if you do not potty train them. However, they do tend to urinate indiscriminately in their bedding. <br>  Step 2:<br>  Find the spots in the cage where your rat is eliminating. Set aside some of the droppings and wet litter. <br>  Step3:<br>   Replace all the old bedding with fresh. <br>  Step 4:<br>  Fill the litter box with fresh litter and place it in the part of the cage where you noticed the most droppings. Add the saved droppings and wet litter. The location of the litter box and the familiar scent of his urine and droppings help cue your rat to "go" in the litter box. <br>  Step 5:<br>   Move your rat into the litter box whenever you see her starting to "go" outside the box. Get her to finish the job there. <br>  Step 6:<br>   Tell your rat "No" if you see her "go" outside the litter box but you can't move her into the litter box in time. <br>  Step 7:<br>  Move any droppings and wet litter you find in the cage into the litter box. <br>  Step 8:<br>   Praise and pet your rat whenever he uses the littler box Reward him with his favorite treats every time he uses the litter box. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps!!|`|oR0inhGFaa	I'm sure someone will give you an extensive method for litter-training, but I've always found my rats like to go in a certain place in the cage every time, rather than pooping just anywhere. So observe your rats in the cage, locate their designated area (shouldn't be too hard to find!) and place your potty there. Rats are very clever, and will work it out in no time. Good luck!|`|PaVyuYVUaa	best answer i have for you is to do this:<br>  <br>  First, you need a litter box made for rodents.<br>  Next, take all the "droppings" and put them in the litter box.<br>  Keep doing that until the rat gets the idea and starts doing its business in there.<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|PY8twFmoaa	Step 1:<br>  <br>  Clean your cage. Set aside some used bedding, but the cage needs to be cleaned really well. Use an enzyme product to clean the urine and deodorize, or you can use stuff you have around the house. (Wash it thoroughly. Then spray down with hydrogen peroxide. Let that air dry. Spray down with white vinegar and let that air dry.) Once the cage is thoroughly clean, sanitized, and deodorized, put fresh bedding in the cage.<br>  <br>   <br>  Step 2:<br>  <br>  Set up your potty. If you have multiple pet rats, you will want a good-sized potty so that more than one rat can use it at a time. The litter or bedding you use should be very different from the bedding in the cage. If you use chips for bedding, then use a paper product for litter, or vise versa. Either way, it should be very different. Top it with the dirty bedding that you set aside from cleaning.<br>  Step 3:<br>  <br>  Clean your rat cage. Clean the cage often, but leave the litter pan dirty. This will help your rats to realize that they aren't supposed to use their bedding, but they are supposed to use the potty. You must sanatize and deodorize the cage each time you clean it. The more you clean it, the easier it will be to potty train your pet rats.<br>  Step 4:<br>  <br>  After four or five months, clean the potty. After your pet rats have gotten a good handle on using the potty you can then clean it. At first, just dump it and add clean litter. Then you can dump it and wash it. After awhile you will be able to sanitize it and deodorize it as well, but you want to wait a long time to make sure that your rats have the hang of it. If it doesn't look like a good place to go and doesn't smell like a place to go, then they won't go there, so don't be too clean!<br>  hope this was helpful :P<br>  have fun<br>  x
nFANuZUmaa	Without either confining your dog and/or training them you cannot stop this from happening.<br>  <br>  A word of note, if your dog has not been neutered it will be much more difficult to control wandering behavior.  Intact male dogs will go to amazing lengths to wander since their instincts drive  them to go in search of females to mate with and mark their territories.<br>  <br>  You can confine your dog in a kennel or fenced area when you are not home and when you are with him train him to understand boundaries.  Some people use "invisible fences" that shock dogs but often a dog (if the reward means more to them than the shock) have still been known to go through them.<br>  <br>  Training always helps to solidify your control so if you haven't done training I suggest you go the the association of pet dog trainer's site and look up a trainer in your area.|`|ArKT9O7Maa	Either put up a fence or tie it with a leash to a pole or other object that will anchor him to the ground away from the street.<br>  <br>  Yes, this is the simplest way to keep a dog out of the street.

They have to be eaten or your puppy could give them to you by biting a flea and then licking you in the mouth. Other types of worms can be contracted by exposure to the eggs. My son once got roundworms, but we got medicine from his doctor and the problem was solved. It is quite easy to get rid of.|`|G6w8Kym4aa	dont be worried u just do NOT kiss your dog on the lips or on the nose area then you might have a chance of getting them if he licks you on your hand then before you eat somethin you just wash your hand no need to be worried you will be fine!|`|6SeWCfUfaa	You know, I feel for you.  I'd be a little freaked if I found tapeworms in my dog too.<br>  <br>  How to say this without sounding gross ... to get the tapeworms, you would have had to ingest some of the tapeworms eggs.  Which would have been passed in your dogs poo.  So if the dog plays in the yard and the kids play in the yard then lick fingers and all .. yea, there's a possibility there for your kids getting tapeworms.  That usually doesn't happen, but it's not unheard of.<br>  <br>  Tapeworms gross me out.  I'm a biologist and not much grosses me out, but these do.  One of the few things I'm squeamish about, but if I found my dog had tapeworms, I'd mention it to the doctor and get something for it BEFORE I started pooping rice  (Lovely thought ... )  I can't think of a doctor that would be shocked by that.|`|sTXN70eWaa	as long as you dont eat the infected poo, you'll be fine.<br>  wash your hands after handling the puppy and especially before you eat.|`|3giaPYe8aa	I don't think that you or your kids plan on eating the segments or any poop, so don't worry about it.  Just wash your hands regularly like you should, anyway.  The worm itself, or any eggs, have to be ingested!  Also, tapeworm originates from fleas.  Make sure you treat the dog for fleas, as well.|`|n8jrLDblaa	It CAN happen, but it's rare.<br>  <br>  Tapeworms come from contaminated fleas....so to minimize the chances:<br>  -Keep the kiddies out of sandboxes<br>  -Keep the pup free of fleas<br>  -Make the kids wash their hands after handling the pup<br>  -Don't allow pup to lick the children's faces until the infection is clear<br>  <br>  Otherwise, not to worry. If you or the kids were infected, there'd be pretty severe abdominal cramping.
LxUX3TdLaa	Yeah hamsters are weird, EVERY single one of my hamsters has done that. What I tried to do what every time they took all of their bedding up there, I'd dump it back out into the bottom of the cage. Eventually they got tired of toting it up to the ball and took it somewhere else, lol. I would suggest that you get the small roller balls from petco (for mice and dwarfs) to let them roll around your room in for exercise. <br>  <br>  Hamsters are hard headed sometimes! There's no way I'd make bed in a ball and then try to exercise in it, lol. Idk what they are thinking!!<br>  <br>  Just keep dumping their bedding back in the bottom of the cage and wash the  ball out then reattach it. <br>  <br>  GOod luck!

I have many owl feathers that I have collected from the bottom of our Horned Owl enclosure at work (I work at an animal sanctuary). Occasionally we get a visitor to the sanctuary asking for feathers from various types of birds or bits of hair from other animals (for crafts or spiritual reasons or school projects, etc.). We are always happy to oblige them and they usually give us a small donation to contribute to the care of the animal whose hair/feathers they needed.<br>  I imagine that a zoo or sanctuary could help you out. Maybe even a farm. If all else fails search some of the Pagan sites on the internet and see if you can order feathers.<br>  :)
fCD8o0oTaa	Hi <br>  well rabbits are great pets.They live up to 8ish years old.<br>  To take care of them you need to have a hutch and a area for the rabbit to run around and get some fresh air.<br>  For feeding you need to give it rabbit pellets and water once in the morning.<br>  In side the hatch you should have a area for the rabbit to sleep(put hay down in this area.And underneath the hay put some newspaper down for the rabbit so its easier to clean its hutch.then another area for the rabbit to eat.<br>  Hope I Helped:D|`|8ym4ypABaa	Depending on your breed of dog some do like other dogs around. I see you got it from a shelter, so its probably a mix. I know a lot about dogs, and while its nice to get them a friend, one of another species isn't always the best option. If your dog seems lonely or bored, that means you aren't fulfilling the needs of the animal. You can easily fill in the spot of another animal by just playing with your dog more!! (its not like that's hard to do, they are soo cute!!!)<br>  <br>  As far as getting a rabbit, like others said, they live just as long as a cat. In my opinion, they are also a lot more work then a cat. It is much harder finding a vet for a rabbit as they are considered exotics. You have to buy them a cage, proper food, toys, rabbit proof your house, get them neutered (yes, its much better to get them neutered/spayed for health reasons and behavior reasons), you have to play with them everyday, they cant be kept in hot hot climates, you have to clean the cage every day, brush them everyday...etc. Its a lot of work!!!!<br>  <br>  So if I was in your position---Just spend more time with the dog!!!!|`|xdzn5ib5aa	A rabbit will live about as long as a cat. In addition, certain breeds of dogs will instinctually track small pets like rabbits (not all, of course, but there's always a chance).

First, rabbits can live 8-12 years. Second, what if your dog doesn't like the rabbit? if he's a big dog, he could kill the rabbit in a fraction of a second. Third, you are buying a rabbit to be a pet's pet-bad idea. Fourth, you don't know how to care for a rabbit.<br>  Please don't do this-it can only end badly.

Dogs bark for many different reasons so its important to understand triggers for the barking to address the problem.<br>  <br>  1) Most dogs bark when playing or being excited.  Either calm her down or stop the paying when she barks.<br>  <br>  2) If you are giving her attention when se barks, either good or bad, she will keep barking at you to get that attention.<br>  <br>  It is impossible to get a dog to not bark at all, especially when it is excited or warning you about something, the trick is to train her so that you have the "on and off" button for the bark.   Do this by rewarding her for the silence after the bark "marking" that behavior with a word like "quiet".  This way she learns that quiet means "stop barking" and will stop when you give the command.  Be  consistent with the word and the reward (food, praise, a favorite toy) when she is quiet and not when she barks.  If she starts to bark turn away from her and ignore her.|`|ArKT9O7Maa	...

UC9Wjjscaa	German Shepherds are very smart loyal dogs.  If he has not been mistreated and developed any super bad habits I would say he is very trainable.  He is still not considered full grown.  Larger breed dogs continue growing sometimes up to 18 months old.  If you don't have alot of experience training dogs though I would consider atleast consulting with a pro.  German Shepherds can be hard to train if you don't let them know right of that you are the pack leader.  If you present yourself as the leader he will do anything to make you happy, but he has to be taught what you want.  Any way I say go for it. I think he will make a wonderful pet and he is definitaly not too old to train, one year is actually a pretty young dog or an older puppy.  Good luck|`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	Of course they can. 10 year old dogs can learn and adjust to a new environment, so a 1 year old will certainly have no problem.|`|AM7CgQ4daa	Yes, at this age thy are still easy to teach, in some ways they are a bit more sensible and learn somethings easier.  dogs that do obedience continue to train and learn new things until they are older than this, so no problem at all.<br>  doing obedience with a class would be a really good idea,  but give it at least 2 weeks so you and your dog can bond.

IRaIxWJKaa	A LOT of new carpets use a chemical backing on them that smells like urine, which confuses dogs and cats quite a bit.<br>  <br>  You can try to disguise the odor till it dissipates.  That Arm & Hammer carpet freshener may be enough to stop the cat, you sprinkle it on the carpet and vacuum it up.  (This is after you've cleaned up any urine with soap and water of course).|`|tL73W0VZaa	Was the carpet new, or did you get it from someone else? If it belonged to someone before you then it probably isn't your cat's fault. If an animal that belonged to the previous owner peed on the carpet, then your cat will smell it and do the same. If it is new, then I would recommend washing it several times, as it is probably the smell of the carpet that is bothering her. Don't let your parents get rid of her, it's ridiculous. If you can solve this one problem, then she will be a devoted pet for at least a decade. If you get rid of her now, then there is no knowing what will happen to her, and what abuse she will suffer.|`|KLMo9jbzaa	She's marking her territory, put her in your room and if she is not fix then have her spaded.|`|GHpcc5iKaa	sometimes they do this when they are stressed, which sometimes happens if you just recently moved?

6j9EZXGWaa	Ball pythons are the most naturally timid snakes on the planet. You will need no capture equipment. You will need a hygrometer to measure the humidity. A dial style that you can stick in the center of the back glass of the cage will do fine. Digital thermometers with probes are best but, the stick on strips are okay. Place these on both sides about 3-4 inches above the bedding. The bedding can be your choice of fir bark chips, repti-bark, cypress bed, aspen shavings, orchid bark or cypress mulch. If you are using a heat lamp to heat the tank, you will not need a heating pad as your primary heat source. A heating pad is good to have as a secondary heat source if it is needed. I recommend a 60 watt bulb for a 20 gallon long. You can get a red bulb or a moon glow for nights that are a bit too chilly. If you decide to use a heating pad, as your only heating source, elevate the tank bottom from the surface that you have it placed on about 3-4 inches to allow air to pass.This will help prevent a fire. Speaking of fires, it is good to have a smoke alarm in the room where you keep your snake. A rheostat or a thermostat is good to have connected to your heat source because they help to regulate the amount of heat that your heating device puts out. Misting is done when the humidity becomes too low. 50-60% is good and bump it up to 75% when your snake is shedding. Remove the old shed skin right after your snake has finished shedding it. Feed your snake rodents that are equal in size to your snake's mid-section at it's widest margin. Feed every 5-7 days. Temperatures for your ball python are 90-92 during the day on the hotside, and mid-low 80's for the cool end. Allow for a 4-5 degree drop at night for both sides. Handle your ball python 3 times a week for about 15-20 minutes each session. Always let it know you are coming. Just don't reach in and swipe it from it's hide because you will scare it and it will defend itself at times. Always wash your hands before and after you handle your snake. Especially if you have the scent of it's food on your hands. Spot clean the tank when ever it needs it and do a complete clean out once a month. Oh, Julius Squeezer is also a decent snake name.|`|iB22RWkGaa	Ball Pythons are great snakes!<br>  <br>  You should probably get 2 thermometers (yes, you can get the cheap ones) one for each side of the tank.<br>  <br>  You can measure the humidity with a hydrometer. You can buy thermometers and hydrometers together.<br>  <br>  Yes, you'll need an under tank heater. They're probably more important than a heat lamp. You can put a towel under it to protect the stand, but I've never had any problems. <br>  <br>  The water bowl doesn't necessarily need to be on the cool side, it can be anywhere really. <br>  <br>  Ball pythons need to be fed mice bigger than pinkies. It depends how big they are. If you're getting a baby, you should probably start with fuzzies and work your way up as the snake gets bigger. They need to be fed about every 7 to 10 days. You can also feed it rats if you want. You can buy frozen mice also, then you won't have to run out to the store whenever you need a mouse. To thaw them out, I put them in a cup of hot water for about a half and hour, then use a blow dryer for a little extra heat. NEVER use a microwave. <br>  <br>  Edit: If you decide to feed frozen, make sure the little baggy the mouse is in is closed. I always forget and up with a soaked mouse. <br>  <br>  In my tank, I have one of those white logs that you get at the beach. It's not very decorative, but my snake loves it. <br>  <br>  For misting, I use a spray bottle that has an adjustable nozzle. I do it a couple times a day, depending on the humidity levels in the tank.<br>  <br>  You can take the shedded skin out of the tank right away. *If your snake is having a hard time getting the skin off (most ball pythons do) you can give him a bath in the sink with luke warm water. I always use a product called Shed Ease by Zilla in the bath. It really helps them get the skin off.*<br>  <br>  For substrate, I recommend using the green repti-carpet. You can use repti bark, it looks cooler, I think. Also, newspaper or papertowels. But just make sure you change it after the snake poops. <br>  <br>  Im so bad with names. lol. I've had my snake for a couple months and it still doesn't have a name. I'm waiting til I find out if its a boy or a girl.<br>  <br>  You can get the pole thing if you want, but I don't think its really necessary. When I get mine out, I always make sure he sees my hand and then I pet it a little bit then take it out.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck! Email me if you have any questions.<br>  foofyhoopka@yahoo.com

Toddlers are grabby and can easily topple or handle them roughly, which could hurt the dog. This in turn can cause the dog to react fearfully or aggressively (nipping or biting.)<br>  <br>  What about energy level and exercise needs? While all dogs need to be walked, some need more than others. Do you want a dog that will be active or inactive indoors? Daily walks or every other day? Running partner or slow walker?<br>  <br>  And what about grooming needs and coat type? Soft or smooth, wiry, long, short? Daily grooming or weekly? What about trips for professional clipping?<br>  <br>  I usually suggest medium sized dogs (15-30 lbs) with short fur and medium indoor/outdoor energy levels. Not so small so they feel vulnerable but no so big that they could knock a toddler over. Short fur so there is less for a toddler to grab. Medium energy so the child can have fun playing fetch or tugs, but only needs one or two short slow paced walks per day.<br>  <br>  Remember any dog needs to be supervised with kids, and kids should NEVER be allowed to pull, tug, pinch, or rough house with the dog.

gvGjrGheaa	If you can honestly answer yes to the following questions, then maybe.<br>  <br>  1. can you afford a pair of sugar gliders? They need the company of their own kind.<br>  <br>  2. Do you have room for a 2X3 cage that is at least four foot tall?<br>  <br>  3. Does you or your son mind cleaning splattered fruit and pee off the floor and walls around the cage every day? Do  you mind the sometimes strong smell of sugar gliders?<br>  <br>  4. Do you have the money to spend up to ￡15 or $30 USD a week feeding your sugar glider correctly, and the time to visit the supermarket, reptile shop and online stores to get the supplies you need? To say nothing of the huge vet fees that vet surgeons charge for exotic animals, and the travelling (possibly hours) you might need to do to reach a suitable vet?<br>  <br>  5. Do you mind having live insects in your house? Sugar gliders eat them.<br>  <br>  6. Does your son mind spending 15 minutes a day blending and preparing a variety of fruits and vegetables, supplements and protein sources to create a healthy glider diet, and then cleaning up the massive amount of waste they produce?<br>  <br>  7. Do you mind a hissing, crabbing, aggressive animal that may never become tame, or may take years to tame? Does your son mind being bitten and crabbed at daily until his animals are tamed?<br>  <br>  8/ Does your son mind being urinated and pooed on by these animals? They have no bladder control and cannot be trained out of this.<br>  <br>  9. Do you have a room you can "sugar glider proof" to let your sugar gliders out to play every day? Sugar glider proofing is time consuming and will require many modifications to your home.<br>  <br>  10. Does your son have three or four hours a day to spend bonding and playing with his animals, EVERY DAY, for up to 15 years?<br>  <br>  11. If he cannot take his gliders to college, will you continue caring for them?<br>  <br>  This is just the beginning of a long list of questions you need to ask yourself before committing yourself to sugar gliders as pets.|`|LEFRVZH7aa	Though they are very cute I'm not sure how good of a pet it would be for a young teen. I was looking into getting one and I was told that because they are nocturnal if you disrupt them during their sleep(which is all day) they can be aggressive sometimes. I remember getting a new pet at that age... All you want to do is hold it and play with it all day. It might not be so easy with a Sugar Glider. Unless you son is going to begin to sleep during the day and then he can be up all night to play with him. Obviously, that's not going to happen. So, you should talk to someone at your local Pet Store and see what info they have for you. Good Luck!!|`|qmFpYwppaa	If he is responsible, then it is a good a pet as any other.  Soft, yet don't seem to bite as often as a hamster.  However, sugar gliders are nocturnal.  Since they are awake at night, it might keep your son awake too.  One thing I found quite annoying with the sugar glider is their high pitch scream.  It's like nails on a chalk board.|`|JGq9rKBOaa	Not if your son is planning on going to college. You'll have that sugar glider in your house for years after your son moves out.<br>  <br>  I'm always wary of recommending ANY pets for teenagers. Sure, they might be responsible enough to care for an animal, unlike younger children, but there's too much uncertainty about the future. If you get any animal, make it a family pet.<br>  <br>  And this is coming from a 20 year old! I have always been very into animals, working in a rescue and taking in lots of animals of my own, but this wouldn't have been possible if I didn't have a family who was as dedicated to the animals as I was. I no longer live at home, but a lot of the animals I got when I was younger do. I don't even live in the same country as my parents right now - and whenever I speak to my father, he's usually got a funny story about the rabbit or the cats for me. They're just as much his pets as they were mine when I was 13. <br>  <br>  So, I don't doubt that your son would be able to care for a sugar glider, or that he'd enjoy having one around. Just make sure that it's a family commitment! And obviously, do lots of research first, and look into rescues and breeders before you resort to pet shops.|`|jyGTlpzTaa	No. First of all, if you think you can keep sugar gliders alone you dont know enough about them to keep them. They are very social animals that can die of depression if kept alone. They also have an extremely complex diet that requires an exact 2:1 calcium:phosphorus ratio, working out the correct sugar glider diet is extremely difficult. I wouldnt say most 16 year olds are up to the job, let alone 13 year olds. Also, sugar gliders can be aggressive and temperamental, they need careful handling and quite often never become tame even with it.

f29a1b4c4d4b5350753e0bc6415f239aaa	It depends...my the first egg my budgie laid hatched on the 17 th day and all the other ones hatched on day 18.|`|UC9Wjjscaa	Fertile eggs will begin to hatch about 18 days from the date the female BEGINS incubating the eggs, which usually occurs with the second egg laid. Incubation is when the female sits on the eggs most of 24/7 (she'll come out of the nesting box to defecate, drink, and maybe eat, although the male feeds the female most of the time while she incubates the eggs/cares for the babies).<br>  <br>  Since it's past 18 days for the first and second eggs laid (they probably aren't fertile), you don't start counting 18 days for the last egg until the last egg is laid. In other words, 18 days for the last egg laid isn't up until around 24 Sep, so there's still a chance the 3-5th eggs might hatch. It could be that none of the eggs laid are fertile/will hatch. Once any eggs hatch, the parents will care for the babies. What happens next depends on what your intentions are for the babies. If you hope to sell them or give them away, you'll need to handfeed them with baby parrot handfeeding formula and a handfeeding syringe in order to make them tame enough to make good pets.Any fertile eggs will hatch in the order laid, usually one every other day. Some adult birds push an emerging baby to the side to facilitate hatching, some keep the emerging baby under them while still sitting on the other eggs, some birds will keep an emerging baby half under them/half not under (a baby still has to be kept warm through the hatching process, which takes 24-48 hours). You should let her abandon any unhatched eggs on her own. If you remove eggs before she abandons them, she may continue to lay and lay, which isn't good for her health. When she realizes they won't hatch, she'll abandon them...you can then remove the eggs and destroy them. <br>  I found this in search and thought it was very informative so I can't take all the credit.|`|AA11640918	18 days.

My Oreo though has a flab of skin that hangs down on the sides by her back legs but she is not fat, you can feel her ribs and her tummy is not fat so she just has that little extra pouch as I call it.

It all depends on if you want a single, double or triple door crate, personally id go with the triple door crate but thats my preference. All you have to do is remember to lock all the doors    It also depends on where you want to buy it. I personally think you should check out shows in your area and buy a couple crates there you get show discounts.     Definitely go with the life stages ultima series they have.      The biggest size that cherrybrook sells online is about 124.99 but like i said check out shows they will gladly help you out and you will get a discount.    I would ad6 the dividers they are not stable and can easily fall on your dog.
eDySIDPQaa	You don't react to them,.just let them rant on, they ar ignorant    Some people at shows can be standoffish, and that makes them seem like snobs.....the ones that do not want to answer questions and walks around with their noses in the air.....ignore them,....not all of us are like that....    and most will be happy to answer all questions and to help beginners..    just don't react, because if you do, then you will get a reputation for arguing back, and you do not want that to start.....because then the other handlers and show folk will label you as being rude.    Just smile and say oh okay...let it go...do not comment back, do not argue back at all.    The cropping of ears if your showinig and your breed standard calls for it, then it has to be done...if the show standards say you do not have to crop that breed, then don't, its up to the breeder.....    Only breed standards regulate the ear cropping and tail docking...    Most are now trying to show without cropping, again its up to the breeder alone....    If the pup gets it done young, when its suppose to be done, there is not that much pain, if people wait till the dog is older, I say its cruel and very painful and od not do it..    All my Min Schnauzers tails were docked by 3-5 days old and ear 3-4 weeks old....no cartiliage and no pain.....

It's the ones that push their opinions on other that you have to  worry about.  When you come across someone like this, just tell them that you have your opinion and they have theirs.|`|Cfk1kr8Daa	This is your first big lesson in showing dogs - and it will continue as long as you are in it.  TJ's right - say nothing, and do what you need to do to take care of your dog, and do the best job you can handling it.     There are very strong opinions about everything on both sides of the fence, and you will find that if anyone notices you bending your behavior after hearing their comments, they will use it against you as part of the game.  Learn to pick and choose what you really need to listen to, and tune out the rest.      Showing dogs started as a stock show - to compare the various animals that were available to breed.  It still should be, in theory, but it's not.  While there is a lot of good information you should learn about structure and movement, there is a lot of hanky panky that goes on behind (and not so behind) the scenes that effects the outcome - it's the process and the ingredients that you should watch most closely.      By seeing the dogs constantly, you will soon learn what is a sound animal, and why the gait works.  Keep in mind that you are working in a small ring, and 'form follows function'... the dogs used for show very soon conform to the ring, not necessary their original use, and many dogs that could perform the things they should outside of showing will not gait properly in the confines of the ring.      As for ear cropping and other modifications, they are falling out of favor.  You may soon find that even the show dogs are no longer cropped, as the internet and air travel make it possible to trade dogs and show them in other countries.  Germany, for instance, forbids anything to be cropped or trimmed - I know someone who flew her dogs there to show on a day she was not judging, and was blocked because she had trimmed their whiskers!       Go into this to learn, and observe both the good and the bad.  You are the future of dog showing, and changes come from within.  Even if there are instances of outright cheating and underhanded manouevres (there will be plenty), there are hundreds of years of experience in those halls from which to learn - the important stuff that will in fact improve the lives of the dogs you handle and produce.      Don't take sides, just go, watch, and learn.  You may win a ribbon, but you won't win most of the arguments, and you don't have to.      Good luck!|`|ohKOucliaa	I've been to several shows, and I hope to soon be showing my own dogs.  My husband is also showing his dog.  I've met many really nice people that are willing to help with advice.  I've also met the other type, many of whom or in the breeds that my husband and I are doing.      You have to remember that there is a political side to most everything.  Dog shows are no exception.  One woman even got so mad that my husband's dog beat hers one day that she went to the breeder we got our dog from and told him several lies about us.  The breeder was ready to take our dog back, until I straightened everything out.  She had also told us a lot of lies about the breeder.    As far as the comments, remember everyone has theie own opinions.  As far as the showing, simply say something like, "These dogs at the shows are extremely loved and pampered.  The dogs enjoy the sport just as much as the owners and handlers.  If they didn't, then they wouldn't do well, and they wouldn't continue showing."    For the docking and cropping maybe something like, "Many of these dogs are used in their original sports as well as confirmation.  A lot of the docking and cropping is to prevent injuries in the field.  Would you rather dock a tail at a couple of days old when they barely feel it, or amputating due to injury at an adult age when they aould be in pain and have a longer recovery time?"    In the end, just use my favorite quote.  Opinions are like buttholes.  Everyone has one.  Then smile and go beat them in the show ring to shut them up.  Good luck.|`|wrUsMG4Jaa	The people that think 'Show People" are snobs have no idea what they're talking about.

They keep you totally down to earth."    Good luck!|`|LGFa6CKsaa	I don't get it why that is a snob thing. That's just one sport among others. Dog breeding is really challenging and life long hobby, it's true it takes money too but mostly patience.   From my own personal view, dog shows should pay much more attention to healthy and natural look of dogs. Dogs suffering from diseases and mental problems should not be in the show. Like for example those people who made german shepard look like frog, the low back that is defiantly not natural, many pedigree show dogs have it, with old working dogs that the race is made to be, that would be a serious handicap.|`|zWFJBlJZaa	Congratulation on your new PROFESSION.    When people razz you about how dog show people are snobs, you can tell them, "Yes, some of them are, but most of the ones I have met have been more than willing to give me encouragement and some very good advice."    And when they say that ear cropping and tail docking are evil --- Tell them they are evidently uninformed, because ear cropping and tail docking are done for the comfort and well-being of the dog when it is doing the job that it was bred to do.    Tails are docked so that they do not get all cut up when racing through the brush.  Ears are cropped to keep them from being ripped off their heads by other animals.  If I recall properly the Dane was bred to hunt boars, which are extremely ferocious animals.  If the Dane's long, floppy ears were to get hooked by a tusk or grabbed in the boar's mouth, a considerable amount of damage would be done to the dog.      People have forgotten the dog's heritage and what they were meant to do and so, because we don't necessarily use the dog for the work they were meant for, they frown upon croppings and dockings as being cosmetic and unnecessary surgery, which by rights, it is not.|`|Os6VjLH0aa	Do what the rest of us have been doing for years, ignore the naysayers that don't have a clue about the whole thing, they are usually in the minority.

On the other hand, some people know far too much about dog shows to get involved- it all depends on what breed you're talking about.      Most working breeds have two groups- the group who show, and the group who work.  Ideally, the two should be meshed together, but 99% of the time a show dog would win over a working dog in the ring and a working dog would win over the show dog in the sport.    And you are always going to get the type who don't "get" ear cropping.  Granted, for some breeds, I see it as nonsensical, but who am I to judge?  Not my dog, not my choice.    Your real issue is going to be between rescues and breeders.  The all-rescue people tend to have a lower tolerance of breeders than the all-breeder people (or those who do both).    There isn't anything you can do to sway someone else's opinion other than prove them wrong.  So get out there, show and work your dog, and breed responsibly!  Good luck!|`|P8Q39vA4aa	Id say excuse me but uh obviously you have never been to a show to see how much of a wonderful sport this is. And you have never seen how busy these people are.    honestly i run from ring to ring sometimes. i cant stop to talk to everyone. does that make me a snob.     People who say this are the ones that come up to people while they are grooming which is a big no no unless you are in that area too, or you know the person personally. like i go up to my mentor all the time when shes grooming but thats cause im helping but if anyone else like a spectator did she'd be furious.    I started doing this when i was 9 years old and it was hard to get into it at that age cause most of the juniors had been around this all their lives. Your lucky you have a mentor from the start.

Sure hope you are going to take advantage of the junior showmanship program, and good for you for finding a breeder to work with. Sounds like you are going about it the right way.  Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but most of the time their ignorance about the subject doesn't deserve a response, and quite frankly I have found that their comments don't effect my life in any way. So a "whatever" is response enough. Otherwise it becomes kinda like feeding the trolls.|`|kWwgWSSgaa	I have come across many instances back stabbing, pettiness, jealously & self glorification among the various breeders/handlers, but snobbery? No.    People from the top show kennels are proud of their achievements, but pride isn't snobbery. Prior to a dog going in ring, the handler is usually focused on the dog with last minute practising or grooming & may appear aloof. {I was usually absorbed with the thought, I hope she doesn't pace today!}    How would I react?    If I dignified the remarks with a comment at all it would be something like "It's my choice of hobby, you don't have to like or approve of it."    "The pup was professionally docked in line with the breed standard"    {You are very lucky as a novice handler to be handling dogs for a good breeder.} Good luck & enjoy it!
djmqoFSTaa	stirrups<br>  <br>  And my horses winter outside to 20 below zero without rugs.  They do have a shelter that blocks the wind and they can get inside it if they want to avoid moisture.  Most of the time...they stand outside of it.<br>  <br>  It's detrimental to put a blanket on a horse that would be outside...because it effects the growth of the winter coat.  It also lays the hair down flat...again causing the horse to not be as warm.  The winter hair on a horse is 'lifted' off the body with air pockets all through it.  This traps warm air next to the skin.  When you blanket them...you ruin the air pockets.<br>  <br>  If it's a show horse and stabled and coddled...by all means...by the blankets.  With all the clipping and bathing that goes with show horses...they need them.<br>  <br>  I own a couple of blankets...but they are rarely used.

Looks like a string vest.<br>  Summer sheet - simply to keep the coat clean and dust free, also flies cannot get on to where the horse is covered.<br>  Stable rug - different weights for different temperatures.  Can be made warmer by a stable blanket which goes under the rug and is secured by the surcingle (the strap that goes around the middle of the horse to prevent it slipping.<br>  New Zealand or turn out rug - to keep horse dry and warm while out in winter.  So many types now that can cover the horse almost completely.  Also useful to keep the mud off him.<br>  There are also travelling rugs which can be put on over the sweat sheet for travelling horses in horse-boxes and keeps them a bit warmer.<br>  Stirrups are the things that you put your feet in when riding.

What you are describing is by-products, /not/ meat meals. By-products are bad to have in your dog food. Meat meals are good.<br>  <br>  "Contrary to what many people believe, meat sources in "meal" form (as long as they are from a specified type of animal, such as chicken meal, lamb meal, salmon meal etc.) are not inferior to whole, fresh meats. Meals consist of meat and skin, with or without the bones, but exclusive of feathers/hair, heads, feet, horns, entrails etc. and have the proper calcium/phosphorus ratio required for a balanced diet. They have had most of the moisture removed, but meats in their original, "wet" form still contain up to 75% water. Once the food reaches its final moisture content of about 9-12%, the meat will have shrunk to sometimes as little as 1/4 of the original amount, while the already dehydrated meal form remains the same and you get more concentrated protein per pound of finished product. This means that in the worst case you are left with only 4 ounces of actual meat content per pound of fresh meat included in a dry kibble, many of which contain less than one pound of meat per 2-3 pounds of grain to begin with.

Some of it may be because she is bored.|`|AdIrjmV7aa	She is gathering the cardboard to build a nest to have her babies.|`|0fKQhIX0aa	rabbits naturally dig in the wild... we domesticated them.  she digs at it probably bc she gets no where in her cage.  it is very normal for them to chew .  this helps keep the teeth filed down.  if they do not have anything to chew they can have serious dental problems.  <br>  <br>  there is nothing wrong with putting cardboard in for them.  also try toilet paper or paper towel rolls (without the paper of course). empty tissue boxes.  drink carriers from fast food places.  etc.  they love it.  you can also purchase hard plastic cat toys (i like the ones with the bells inside) that she can roll around and play with.<br>  <br>  also see rabbitwise.org|`|OdDJv5ouaa	Its is a cats nature to dig and claw at things. It is best to get here a cat board. It is pretty much cardboard slabs mixed with cat nip. It is much better that having your ca dig on furniture too.
gBgSMgClaa	They are very beautiful. I always wanted one but was told by someone who owned two they are very high maintenance, because of the wrinkles they can tend to need surgeries and stuff like that. I would talk to a breeder before buying one and make sure you set to own a dog of such high maintenance.|`|AA11244754	then go to <a href="http://www.wikipedia.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikipedia.com</a> and type in shar-pei, that is how you can do your own research but you should have done that BEFORE you decided to get one, not after.|`|4V4m2uZ5aa	Please don't think I'm preaching but before I bought any dog I would definitely do my research. You want to educate yourself about any breed you get.<br>  <br>  I can tell you what I know about that breed. I'm no expert on Shar-Pei's but I have had alot of contact with them from the vets office I worked at and dog training. I think the main thing is health issues. When I worked for a vet in the early 90's we saw alot of health issues. One was some joint issues and the other was their skin. I believe these were both hereditary conditions. Now this was a long time ago so some of these issues may have been "bred out" so to speak. <br>  As for their training here's what I have noticed. They seem to be a one person dog. I think if you raise them with your family it will be ok. If you try to introduce children or a spouse later on you may encounter some jealousy or dominance issues. They seem to be a dominate dog so I would start obedience immediately. You want to let this breed know who the boss is from the start. Now with your training they are a smart dog but they can be a bit stubborn. Like I said just start early and let them know your boss.<br>  <br>  As with an breed go to a reputable breeder. Ask to see the mom and dad. If they do not own the dad ask for the owners name and number and call them. A good breeder will have no problem providing you with this info.<br>  <br>  Every breed has their "quirks" the key is to make sure you can live with those "quirks"<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Answer to your second question:<br>  If I were picking a dog for my children I just don't think I would pick a Shar-Pei.  They can be aggressive dogs. Another thing to think about is this; say your dog is good with your kids but they are going to have friends over and personally I think this is an aggressive breed. There are some exceptions to that but do you want to chance that. If you are dead set on this breed just make sure you see the mom and dad. Check out their personality. That will tell you alot about your pup.<br>  Sorry if I offended any Shar-Pei owners.
z33hxpHJaa	Parelli is good, but i tend to mix my training with other methods because my horse trains differently.
3BMBZtDxaa	Okay, well first off, congradulations on your newest edition!<br>  <br>  There are plenty of ways to reward dogs without stuffing them full of treats. First off would be the clicker. Just look online about clicker training. This is a way to show them the behavior is good, and it doesn't include treats. Also, by you just petting them re-enforces good behavior. Anything pleasurable for them is a reward! So if your dog stays or something and you're pleased, you can just get excited and send off happy energy and give them pats. You also can give them nonfatty treats so you can reward without them getting sick or fat. You can try cooked carrots. Boil them in water without anything added and then cool them and put them in pieces. Dogs usually love carrots and respond well to them, and carrots are mainly water so no fat value! You can also try using plain cheerios, frozen dollops of plain yogurt, and small pieces of fruit. But no seeds or cores! Those are all great alternatives to training treats that can cause your dog to get fat.<br>  <br>  Potty training takes patience and time. You need to crate your dog whenever you're gone, at night, and when you're home keep your dog on an extended leash around you so you can always keep a close eye on your dog. No punishing for going inside, only redirection. If you see her sniffing, time to go out! If she starts to go, pick up her hind legs (if you pull them up it's impossible for her to pee) and place her outside. Clean the spot with good pet cleaner that will eliminate the odor. Make a schedule, too. 20 minutes after eating take her out, after playing take her out, and every few hours (depending on her age) give her a potty break. If she isn't going, take her on a short walk. Walking stimulates them to go to the bathroom. It'll just take time and patience!<br>  <br>  I would suggest getting Victoria Stillwell's book, Dog Training for Dummies, and maybe a Puppies for Dummies book depending on your dog's age. Also, I would highly recommend a book talking about dog behavior and body signals, because that will help you in the future. Look into getting a book about German Shepherd Dogs as well, since you want to know everything about them and what to expect in the future. <br>  <br>  I don't know any recipes off the top of my head, but there are TON of recipes online. You also can look into a dog nutricion book, which will help you with what foods you should feed and ways to make your dog healthier. You can usually pick one up for $15 on average. <br>  <br>  If you're wanting to mix wet and dry, you should put in about 2-3 cups of kibble and then 1/2-3/4 of a can of wet in one serving. Then adjust from there. Watch your dog's weight and if he gains, cut back some. If he looses, add some on. If you have a vet appointment soon, you can ask your vet the recommended feeding amount for your dog. It shouldn't upset her stomach, but I don't see why you'd want to feed wet. She'll be just as fine on only dry and it'll save you money.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your dog!|`|Gl03SVARaa	Potty training- Take your dog outside. If she pees then tell her good dog and praise.(You can give her praise whenever she does good.) Whenever she uses the bathroom inside sternly say NO! Bad Dog! Make sure she has eye contact. Pretty soon she'll catch on.<br>  Sitting & Stay- Once you get her to sit, say stay slowly as possible walk backward while saying stay the whole time. If she follows NO! Take her back and start over. Pat your legs as signal to come.<br>  <br>  Remember to give praise if not treats. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!

That's because you can't put more then one in a tank without disaster.  <br>  <br>  Occasionally I've seen them in breeding traps like you said, I think it's more along the lines of ignorance on the pet store.  So many people think that bettas are man eating killers, that will stop at nothing to kill lol.  In reality, they will usually get along just fine with most other community fish, and vice versa.  Of course, there's always the exception, but again, usually they're fine.  But as far as them in breeding traps, it's probably better then a bowl, assuming the tanks are heated.  Just another way to house them.<br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|nZno3cMEaa	they are also kept in jam jars as they can breathe the air so live fine till you take them home and put them in your tank
MfcTIdlraa	I see Jen's answer right on the nail except they aren't strictly "guard dogs", I would classify them more as "Alarm System" dogs.|`|AE7W7Jspaa	This is a very hard question, it all depends on the the dog itsself, a soft dog might run, a stronger personality might stay and defend.  Border Collies as a breed are not protection or guardian type dogs.  As others have pointed out though they would raise the alarm if someone were breaking in, or you were getting attacked.  Dogs as a species will defend territory and members of its pack against a threat.  Play fighting is no example of whether a dog will defend or run.  People/animals give off phermones (sp?)/scent when frightened or angry this might encourage the dog to stand and fight vs a flight reaction.  In the world of fight or flight, a preditor is more likely to fight than flee|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Most border collies are pretty protective of their owners and a pretty good judge of when the owner actually needs protecting.  It's one of the neat things about the breed.  <br>  <br>  They will for sure, make enough noise to rouse the dead if someone comes onto your property uninvited.  (And sometimes, invited .. )  To me, they're great "guard dogs."  They'll deter without any specialized training.<br>  <br>  (I see things differently than moocow ... I see his dog not knowing the difference between play and a real threat and the BC knowing what's play and what's not.)|`|7174c4ea9bfe32174e16648f0cbd8d39aa	i have a boxer that is very protective of me. especially if someone pushes me or hits me (just joking around) and i make a big deal out of it for fun, the dog will perk up and growl at whoever did it. but my girlfriends border collie just thinks it's play time and comes a licks both people involved in the play fight. so... i'm gonna go with no. they just like licking people too much i guess.<br>  <br>  however, the border collie definitely "raises all kinds of hell" when someone walks by the front windows of the house, like out in the street. she doesn't like other people around the house unless they have been introduced. so they might be protective... just not very aggressively.|`|ou0sh511aa	Dogs feel that they are a part of the family and can sense when something is wrong. If somebody breaks in they will defend you and attack when the sense fear from the family. All dogs will do this even a little Chihuahua will attack if he feels the family is fearing somebody so yes they will attack its thier instinct
w1lh1INHaa	Fish oil for pets is Salmon oil.  It contains a lot of Omega 3 fatty acids which are good for general health, bowel health, and coat and skin.  Fish Oil for humans is generally Cod  or Cod Liver Oil, which isn't good for pets.  <br>  <br>  <br>  No, it is not raw, but sterilized with heat so it won't spoil or go rancid.|`|Vp83Fuakaa	i think it is a suppository|`|7qr2GprBaa	There is fat in fish, just like there is fat in all animals.

PE0oyIWtaa	I keep him on a leash and don't let his nose near the ground when there is poop, otherwise my guy would gobble it down too.   I don't know why he does it either because I feed him very expensive food that is supposed to be very nutritious, so I too doubt it is a vitamin deficiency.   I hope he out grows it because it really grosses me out.|`|7EwViF5faa	my dog does that too n i dont knw y?     can anyone help!!!|`|3p6wp7DYaa	From what I've seen around the dog park here, lots of dogs like poop, but not that much.    I also read that sometimes foods that are too rich, like Innova, may add to the problem because the dog does not absorb all of the nutrients in the food (there is just too much of everything) and so the poop smells and tastes too good to pass up. If your dog eats really fast, that might add to the issue of the food not being fully digested. He also may have some specific difficulty digesting one or two specific ingredients in this food.     Have you tried feeding him something a little less rich to see if he will lose interest in it? Try something with a little less protein, say Merick's Before Grain, or Wellness Super 5 Mix, or California Natural.    Good luck!|`|LMUwz5y8aa	Feed him with good stuff|`|2996d23436c6aa8341c01f9d61c163a3aa	Yeah I know so gross aye. My dog sits behind my cat and eats his poo while hes going!

The only success we had is when we brought her to obedience class they taught her the word "LEAVE IT" which we use when she bends down to eat the poop and it works!    GOOD LUCK! "Labs can be a handful but I still love them!"  EDIT: I saw this on a it's me or the dog and it was a choc. lab! The trainer said it was because the dogs poop smelled like the dogs poop!

nSPZQ6i5aa	Yes, he/she is very likely a bit stressed out. It looks like you're now keeping him/her in a bowl. That's fine for now. You should dechlorinate the water, and in the meantime, if you have the original tank, try getting it cleaned up to put the fish back in it later. The more room a goldfish has, the happier it will be. Goldfish can live for a very long time. Do you have any idea how old it might be? Natural death is probably a long way off. <br>  <br>  Now if that's a new bowl it's uncycled. That means it doesn't have the bacteria built up to balance the ammonia and nitrites and such. Ideally, you'll want to clean up the old tank -preferably it's a 20 gallon one, but at his size a 10 gallon will likely suit (better than a fishbowl anyways)- and if it doesn't have a filter, get one. If it does, clean it up with dechlorinated water, and bottle brushes to clean the tubes and intake thingie (impellor). Get the old tank cleaned up and running again, and let it run for a day or two. Once you return the goldfish, be sure to do 15 to 20% water changes every week, at least, and get a gravel vacuum. If you can't find one small enough, you can cut them down to size. <br>  <br>  Goldfish produce alot of waste. They say that goldfish are the dirtiest of the hobby fish. This polutes their water. So, you need to change part of the water in that bowl you're keeping him/her in every day. Try for like 35 to 40%, would be my guess. If you're new fish is sickly now, it is probably because of the improper water he/she has been kept in. <br>  <br>  No, he/she does not need any friends. Friends will make it worse. Later, if you should upgrade to like a 30 gallon tank, then you might get him/her a friend. <br>  <br>  Good luck! Gold fish, by the way, live for decades, and can get to be over a foot long.<br>  <br>  Oh yeah, don't feed it anything for a day or so. Then only a little bit, once a day is fine. It should eat what you give it in like 3 minutes. If it doesn't, you're feeding it too much, or it just isn't hungry enough yet.|`|Rp3QC8WDaa	No, your fish looks like it had been roasted but it should be fine after a couple of days.|`|DU7iO8EHaa	Ya its a goldfish.

(dlm satu tahun) tahun berikutnya 1thn sekali...<br>  4.positif= hewan yang bisa multi fungsi (penjaga, anjing sahabat (baik untuk anak yang sedang berkembang untuk belajar merawat hal yang dia cintai, tanggung jawab), hewan yang bisa menemani kita mencari keringat (olah raga jalan2 atau lari2 atau sekedar bermain dengannya)<br>  negatif= bisa membuat tamu anda takut datang ke rumah anda, kemungkinan berisik dengan gonggongannya (tp hal ini msh bisa diatasi jika dilatih dari kecil agar anjing itu dapat menghentikan gonggongannya atas perintah anda).<br>  5. anjing condong mengejar apa saja yang lari, spt kita liat anjing suka mengejar orang yg lari ketakutan (klo orang itu tidak lari maka anjing itu pun ga akan ngejar)<br>  6. 2x2 cukup untuk labrador, terlalu besar untuk anjing kecil (shih tzu, pom) terlalu kecil untuk anjing besar (great dane, st.bernad). asalkan di tempat itu anjing masih dapat bergerak bebas, itu sdh cukup...<br>  7. saran: ajukan perjanjian dengan anak anda agar mau berkomitmen untuk memelihara anjing dengan kasih sayang...klo dia tidak menyanggupi jangan belikan anjing...<br>  8. semoga membantu...|`|Bs69bQaEaa	anjing cihua hua aja<br>

anjing ras lebih susah perawatannya daripada yg bukan ras.. yg bukan ras biasanya lebih kuat daya tahan tubuhnya..<br>  <br>  cara pemeliharaan anjing pada umumnya siapkan tempat tinggal/kandang yg baik(terhindar dari panas saat matahari sedang terik atau angin dan air saat hujan, hal ini bisa menyebabkan anjing menjadi sakit).. beri makanan yang sesuai dengan kebutuhannya(bisa dilihat di belakang kemasan dogfood atau kosultasikan dgn dokter hewan).. beri suntikan vaksin di dokter hewan agar anjing sehat dan pemeliharanya juga aman dari penyakit yg mungkin ditimbulkan dari hewan yang sakit(minta penjelasan pada dokter hewan).. bersihkan kotorannya dengan baik agar anjing tetap sehat dan anda sekeluarga juga sehat.. mandikan seminggu sekali atau tergantung kebutuhan(kalau musim hujan bisa dikurangi frekuensinya, gantikan dengan bedak).. dan yang tidak kalah penting, luangkan waktu anda bersama anjing anda(bermain atau mengajak jalan2), karena anjing adalah hewan yang membutuhkan perjatian dan kasih sayang..<br>  itu prosedur yg umum.. untuk lebih jelas bisa tanyakan pada dokter hewan..<br>  <br>  untuk biaya, saya kira relatif.. makanan anjing ada yg berupa dryfood atau canned(kalengan)..<br>  untuk dryfood bisa diberikan langsung atau diberi air supaya agak lembek(jangan air panas, bisa merusak vitamin nya).. <br>  kalo yg canned/kalengan bisa langsung diberikan atau dicampur nasi..<br>  ada juga yang memberikan anjingnya makanans segar yg diolah sendiri, misalnya hati ayam, telur ayam, dll.. tapi anda harus konsultasikan dahulu dengan drh untuk mengetahui kebutuhan nutrisi anjing anda..<br>  saya bisa sedikit informasikan utk harga dogfood pedigree dryfood di ace hardware jakarta sekitar Rp 216.000 utk yg 10kg, biasanya semakin berat ukuruannya harga per kg nya lebih murah(ada yg 30kg)..<br>  mungkin kalo ada mencari di pengecer or petshop tertentu bisa lebih murah..<br>  kalo utk veterinary biasanya pas sakit atau vaksin saja.. atau mungkin anda ingin jasa memandikan anjing juga bisa.. untuk harga bisa tanya langsung ke drh di dekat tempat anda tinggal..<br>  <br>  berhubung yg anda mau pelihara anjing labrador(termasuk jenis anjing besar), saya rasa anda perlu siapkan space/tempat yg cukup untuk dia bergerak.. harus diajak jalan/olahraga supaya pembentukan tulangnya sempurna.. <br>  <br>  posoitf negatifnya punya anjing , kalo menurut saya sejauh ini lebih banyak positifnya.. ^_^<br>  saya sendiri sudah pelihara anjing sejak masih kecil(sebenernya dari saya belum lahir di rumah sudah ada anjing).. saya mulai merawat anjing sendiri waktu saya smp.. jadi saya mulai memberi makan anjing saya dan memandikan anjing saya sendiri.. buat saya secara pribadi, ini melatih kedisiplinan dan tanggung jawab saya.. dan ini dgn cara yg menyenangkan.. mungkin kalo saya disuruh latihan disiplin dgn cara yg lain akan terasa membosankan, tapi berhubung yg saya urus itu anjing yg hidup, bisa berinteraksi dan bermain, jadi lebih terasa menyenangkannya.. satu lagi, karena sejak kecil sudah ada anjing di rumah, saya dibiasakan untuk selalu mencuci tangan sebelum makan(orangtua saya bilang kalo saya tidak bisa menjaga kebersihan nanti anjing saya harus dikasih orang) dan kebiasaan itu masih terbawa sampai sekarang.. waktu saya sekolah/kuliah, teman2 saya suka bingung kalo melihat saya mencuci tangan sebelum makan karena mereka sepertinya sudah lupa dengan tradisi itu.. sampai hari ini saya selalu mencuci tangan saya kalo mau makan.. jadi menurut saya memelihara anjing bisa membawa pengaruh yg positif untuk perkembangan anak.. untuk belajar disiplin, tanggung jawab, dan menjaga kebersihan.. <br>  biasanya setiap orang akan lebih ceria saat berinteraksi dengan anjing peliharaanya.. selain itu bermain/menghabiskan waktu bersama anjing bisa meredakan stress.. di luar negeri sendiri ada organisai yg mendidik anjing untuk mengunjungi pasien2 di rumah sakit.. jadi mereka bekerja sama dengan pihak rumah sakit untuk meangadakan kunjungan ke pasien2 mereka.. mereka percaya dengan meluangkan waktu untuk bermain atau berinteraksi dengan anjing membuat pasien2 terhibur dan mengurangi stress..<br>  kalau negatifnya selain waktu yang harus anda korbankan juga uang untuk biaya perawatan.. <br>  untuk saya sendiri yg paling merepotkan kalau harus bepergian keluar kota.. biarpun di rumah sudah ada yg menjaga, perasaan tetep engga tenang.. kalo mereka sakit saya juga engga tenang.. pas anjing saya ada yg meninggal sedihnya bisa berminggu-minggu.. <br>  <br>  untuk mengusir tikus, memang biasanya tikus takut dgn anjing/kucing.. pada sebagian anjing, mereka akan menangkap/mengejar tikus dan menggigit  tikus itu sampai mati(biasanya tidak dimakan).. tapi tergantung dari sifat anjing nya sendiri, sebagian besar sih seperti itu.. <br>  <br>  untuk tempat tinggal anjing sebaiknya dibuatkan yg beratap baik, jadi bisa tahan panas dan angin(supaya anjing engga kepanasan or kedinginan).. kalo bisa berikan akses menuju rerumputan(rumput bisa mengurangi stress pada anjing).. <br>  <br>  saya rasa untuk anak ibu yg sudah sma utk mengurus anjing sehar|`|SXNrFTE8aa	anjing

WAOkgdj6aa	My cat does it too.<br>  <br>  It's perfectly normal and has nothing to do with whether she has been spayed or not. Obviously your cat feels safe under your bed and makes it their home (also because cats like dark places) and likes to find things that find them comfort to bring to their 'home', some cats attach themselves to toys, bags, treats, blankets, towels, etc and bring all those kinds of things into their home|`|f19c8f60e4f00e1419d732994fddb327aa	It's very likely that she's pregnant. Try pressing your hand against her tummy. If it's round and hard, she's either pregnant or has worms (worms are more tennis ball shaped, pregnant is more like taking a deep breath and holding it type shape). Either way, she should go to a vet. (They will not spay her if she's pregnant, but can give her and abortion.)<br>  <br>  If she's not pregnant, then it could be a false pregnancy. I had a cat who, after she was fixed, began collecting the neighbor's cloth napkins, and would try nursing them. She ended up becoming seriously pathological. If it's a false pregnancy, she should still go to the vet.|`|U00iZcvVaa	Cats are like that. you will never understand them never.

w9aR8ymGaa	Before anything can be guessed, get the dog checked out by the vet.  I know you are thinking that it will be a waste because she is only behaving that way to one dog, but you'd be surprised how dogs act out behaviorally because of an illness.  They do not behave the same as humans do when they are ill or hurt, please, take her to the vet.|`|8oAlBL91aa	Usually when a dog goes from it's normal sweetness to in a rare mood it's usually a sign that something is bothering it wither it's pain or just as simple as and change in the air he is breathing anything can trigger that bitterness. It's def a time to call the vet because you don't want someone else to get hurt especially with a baby on the way. <br>  <br>  Also 14 years old getting up there for a dog. Painful joints also comes to mind.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Sudden behavior changes in dogs is usually a sign that it's time to see the vet.  Rule out any possible illnesses or injuries before you start trying to "train" your trained dog.|`|E3SKXPF1aa	Even though they say you shouldn't hit a dog, you should lightly hit it on the nose every time she snaps. Have you had any changes? If so this could be the reason. Good luck with finding whats wrong!!!
cN0RPwH7aa	When you urge her into a canter, use your right leg more strongly than your left, even just using the right leg on it's own.<br>  If that dosen't walk, you could try trotting as fast as possible and hopefully she'll fall off balance on the right leg :).|`|TZw34Rz9aa	First, don't get frustrated some horses just aren't naturals at changing leads.<br>  <br>  At a trot, try posting for the lead you want her on.  It'll force her to follow your lead or be off-balance.<br>  <br>  You should also have a vet, farrier check her out for any physical/medical problems she may be dealing with that you aren't aware of.  Then have a trainer/instructor watch you work with her, you may be unaware of throwing mixed signals.|`|VxN4tnJtaa	I would still try to work on the lounge line with her going to the right, to build that muscle up.  some horses are naturally left or right lead horses.  to get and keep that right lead, use more pressure from right foot just behind her right side on the girth area to make her want to stretch her right leg up further to pick up that right lead, put a little more pressure down on that right stirrup as well, and keep left food just behind the girth area as compared to the right side.  |`|0efe43c88dbe3f09246d65d290936ed3aa	There's alot of good answers here on correction.  One thing that stands out for me here is the possibility that perhaps Twinkles, at this stage may be physically incapable of cantering on her right lead.<br>  I realise that she's an older pony with lots of experience under her belt.<br>  <br>  My suggestion here is to perhaps consider getting your vet to examine her.  There may be an underlying problem that you aren't aware of.  Often horses with back injuries are reluctant to canter on certain leads.  <br>  Back injuries can, in some cases, go for years without really being noticable, unless you've had the horse it's whole life and know absolutely everything there is to know about it.  Back injuries can be caused by many things, and can have recurring effects.<br>  This is, of course, just a thought, and actually is the first thing that popped into my mind when I read your question.  So yeah, vet/chiro/physio eliminate all possibility of injury before you continue with your schooling.<br>  <br>  All the best,<br>  <br>  Kismet:)|`|AmOzwEKaaa	Outside leg Short outside rein and support inside leg and hand!! it works every time!|`|0eSDKab6aa	You really need to try and get her to lounge. Also try doing some bending exercises with her. For example, sit on her back in the middle of the arena. Pull on one rain or the other. It will be hard on her at first if she is not use to it and she will want to turn in a circle. Let her do it. If you bend her everyday she will become more flexible. Eventually she will be able to walk a Straight line with her nose almost touching the saddle. It take a lot of work so I recommend that you find a book or something on bending. It really dose make things easier on you. Sometimes a horse won't pick up the lead because they are sore or just stiff that way.  |`|nh6OAH6laa	Have you tried strengthening her by lunging her to the right at the canter? And how long have you had her? is this problem new?<br>  Horses will almost always have one side that's stronger than the other, it's your job as the rider to help her strengthen the weak side. <br>  Maybe you're giving her a confusing cue. If you haven't already, try putting your whip in your outside hand. Ride her on a circle or ask in a corner so that she's already bending to the inside, press with your outside leg, and tap behind your leg with the whip.<br>  This may be basic, but you didn't specify you or your horse's level of schooling...|`|AA11498082	The cue is right leg at girth, left heel behind girth, touch, canter right lead.|`|9biWjSweaa	My horse has the exact same problem - just the other way around. <br>  <br>  I find it is easier if you work on a 20 meter circle. That way, the flexion, bend and balance of the horse on the circle can help encourage them to pick up the right lead. It's just about persistence and giving totally clear aid. Make sure the horse knows exactly what you want. Also, are you putting your outside leg back behind the girth when you give the leg aid to canter? This encourages the horse to strike off with the outside hind leg - the correct lead. You probably are, but you didn't mention it when you were explaining what you go through to ask for canter. <br>  <br>  I really really recommend you read this article:<br>  <a href="http://www.equisearch.com/horses_riding_training/english/dressage/less_is_more_052708/" rel="nofollow">http://www.equisearch.com/horses_riding_...</a><br>  It doesn't talk about cantering in particular, but I think it explains really well how you can achieve a clear aid to your horse and dramatically improve your dressage.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
0efe43c88dbe3f09246d65d290936ed3aa	I think, as has already been said, it's got alot to do with physical maturity.  I happen to agree with you though, and it's something I actually put into practice with the racehorses I start.  They arrive in the yard from sales - usually as 2 year olds - I get them backed and trotting, and then 9 times out of 10 they get sent back to the farm for up to a year in some cases, to be brought in to training as 3 year olds.<br>  <br>  I think that each horse must be treated as an individual in terms of training, no matter what discipline you're training them for, whether showjumping, dressage, racing, etc...each horse is going to mature at a different pace, and it's not just about physical maturity, you have to take into account emotional/mental maturity as well.  It's no good to push a physically mature horse if mentally they're not there yet, all you're going to do is blow their minds and you end up with a maniac on your hands.<br>  <br>  My sister had an Arab (pure breed) pony when she was a kid, the pony was a Children's A grade jumper by the time she (the pony) was 9 years old.  By the same token, it took my sister's other pony almost 10 years to get to the same level, simply because he matured at a different rate, even though he was also a pure breed Arab.<br>  <br>  Edited to respond to this statement:<br>  <br>  "I think that trainers who start a horse at 2 or three are using the advantage they have of training a weaker, less comprehensive horse to more easily "bully" them into obeying rather than teaching them solid lessons."<br>  <br>  Rubbish.  A 2 year old horse is NOT easier to bully into doing anything.  It's just as easy to 'bully' a horse that's 7 or 10 or 18 years old, I know because I've seen it alot. Unfortunately. <br>  <br>  Also, inresponse to some of the other answers that mentioned it:-  Knee plates are usually closed by the time a horse is a late 2 year old, early 3 year old.  I know this because ALL our young stock have their knees X-rayed before they begin anything even resembling serious training.|`|EW4zX8lnaa	I think that a horse should not be ridden until age four at the earliest, and jumped at 4 1/2 or 5 at the earliest because i think that in order to establish mutual respect between horse/rider you ALL those preceding years to establish a strong relationship as horse/handler--that cannot be rushed. Also most vets agree that horses are neither mentally or physically mature until age 5 or 6. I think that trainers who start a horse at 2 or three are using the advantage they have of training a weaker, less comprehensive horse to more easily "bully" them into obeying rather than teaching them solid lessons. A horse s also not going to comprehend what you are teaching as completely or as quickly if you start earlier. And of course there is the grave possibility that you could create any one of a myriad of health problems associated with working a horse too hard, when they are aged 2 or 3. While it doesn't happen to all horses started young,  it raises the odds that the horse may develop some problems. I am proud to say that no one got on my horses back until he was four, and he was never jumped until age 5. At 6, he is an excellent jumper with huge potential. My trainer claims that he is one of the quickest learning horses she has ever worked with. |`|KSal2Mnqaa	because of the growth plates in the knees, if they are not closed enough even one jump can damage them causing a life time of lameness.  5 is safe, but if you want to jump a horse before then you can have them x-rayed.  I have known several jumpers who where started before they where five and as long as those growth plates are closed you are fine.  |`|ZcVkqwkcaa	well you have your opinions and other people have theirs.<br>  <br>  personally my opinon is why hurry up and rush training? the faster you train a horse and ride em harder ect the faster they are going to go lame later in life. that's just my views on the matter. A horse can live up to 30+ years, a 5 year old is not to old to still be working with and training. . . how do you expect they train wild mustangs?  think they only catch 2 year olds to work with? I'm sure a few 3,4 even 5 year olds get mixed into the training bunches. . . <br>  <br>  so your thought that a 5 year old is too old to train is alittle silly to me, but I'll let ya have your opinion, I have mine. good luck.|`|udAoP6R1aa	The horse needs to be mature mentally as well as physically before you start riding them, let alone throwing them in a show, which can be really stressful. Training is not about you, its about the horse, so if they need more time to learn something, they get more time. A few months or even years won't kill you.|`|zywy6vOGaa	I agree with, the Show-Jumping stud and pre- training stable that i work at we free jump at three and four and start being ridden over jumps and competing as a late four year old young five year old.|`|IUwfdjQCaa	Hmmm. I think it has to do with the growth of the horse... I honestly don;t know. Probably just personal opinion, maybe to play it safe?|`|yTLHXvpxaa	possibly week bones in the hind legs ? leave it until the horse is fully matured  or get a bike ,|`|IMPvzBk1aa	Any horse should be xrayed for epiphyseal closure if you intend to begin jumping at an early age.  Horses mature at different rates, and the only way to know for sure is via xray.  Jumping adds considerable stress and concussion to the front legs and conformation is also an issue in whether or not to begin jumping.  the hocks and hind pasterns are also stressed during push off.  Pastern length and angle should be considered, as well as shoulder slope and muscular development before deciding to begin jumping.  The supportive structures are more vulnerable to injury in a young horse, and must be conditioned over a prolonged period of time before jumping should be started.|`|QMl4ELhGaa	There is logic behind that train of thought. Some breeds of horses mature slower than others. For example, my friend has an Egyptian Arabian that she bought as a 3 year old. Him being Arabian, he will physically mature slower than, say, a quarter horse. So she waited until he was 4 to back him. She lunged him and what not before then, but avoided anything overly strenuous. There are many horse's whose epiphyseal plates do not close until 4 or later, so there is a school of thought that those horses should not be pushed until that time to reduce risk of arthritis later in life. I, personally, would not jump a 3 year old. I would start jumping at 4. But that is my personal opinion.<br>  <br>  ADD: and what is up with all of the thumbs down for the people answering???|`|7OBgjOaMaa	i was always told that their bones are not mature enough to work that much untill they are at least 4. again, i was also told they can not be jumped higher then 3 foot untill they are 6 or you risk actually crippling them in the future.|`|LOH6UVh7aa	Personally I think it is ridiculous to  think it is OK to jump a 4yr old!!!! Horses do not full finish growing at least 5yrs.|`|at7LXbEfaa	i think the just dont want to disturb the growth of there bones..|`|5i8lDbXfaa	Some people like to wait until horse's bones and muscles are done growing before teaching them.  Horses are better coordinated to jump when they have completed ground work and such training, also they develop at different rates individually.  It's a judgment call on who is doing the training.  For me horses shouldn't be have a rider on their back till 2 and that's after they completed ground manners and are used to a bridle, saddle etc. Only can you progress to jumping once the horse seems fit and has mastered walking, trotting, cantering, basic lead work and such with a rider. Horses shouldn't be rushed to something when they are not ready, if it takes them till their 5 then that's just how its goes.<br>  <br>  I agree with you horseluver!
45b08ca1dc880690ca7764657e05b376aa	Get him a few toys. There are these little fur covered mice that would be small enough for his little mouth. Cats love these toys.|`|707gOCvbaa	I recommended corrugated cardboard -- a small box opened at one end is ideal. She chews on the corners of the flaps and leaves other stuff alone. Just remember to take off any sealing tape, because they can swallow bits of it and it's not good for them.Just place her in the box and let her go nuts Once she starts chewing on it she will stay there as needed. Sometimes, a kitten will gnaw on a raw-hide stick (for dogs), a frozen bagel, or a small rubber chew toy to relieve discomfort from teething. good luck|`|X40Ww89qaa	there are babies in africa without teething toys|`|nPfCmp2Faa	take a rag, wet it, put it in the freezer and voila. (usually used for teething puppies but don't see why it wouldn't work for kitties) its cold so it'll numb the pain for them also :)|`|3pZJYpu3aa	Take the teeth out
UNFxjNHkaa	cats never forget!  They are very intelligent creatures - its not like you're going away forever - you'll still see them on the weekends!  Im sure they'll still let you cuddle with them.<br>  <br>  I moved out of my parents house about 2 years ago - they have a cat named Lacey- I was nervous that when I moved out the cat wouldnt remember me anymore but thats not the case at all!  I go to my parents once a month and the cat still loves to cuddle with me!|`|zpwJR60baa	Are you leaving your cat behind?  If yes, sorry to hear this. But nevertheless, cats does not forget the people who care for them.  They have a very good instinct... They will be all over you when you come over to visit.|`|AA12017987	I had a cat that I left in my old house while in the process of moving for atleast a month. When I came back to get her she remembered me! <br>  <br>  Dag, now you got me all sad. I miss my cat!!<br>  <br>  Anyway, it depends on your cat.|`|V1u1PwyRaa	yes they will<br>  as long as there still taken care of and have contact with people they still will <br>  they will probably want to cuddle more from not seeing you it will be fine|`|XMSf3ZPiaa	yes im sure they will they will remember your face. They will miss you but that just means that when they see you they will show even more affection when they see you. <br>  <br>  Jack|`|AA11637099	Cats remain affectionate to people they know as long as they are still being treated properly.
JGq9rKBOaa	Here are my opinions on your proposed stocking - <br>  <br>  1 dwarf gourami - should be fine. <br>  <br>  6 zebra dianios - again, should be fine, but I personally wouldn't get any danios and instead get a larger school of tetras.<br>  <br>  3 cory catfish - get more than 3. You're not overstocked, so I'd go for about 6.<br>  <br>  and 6 neon tetras - I'd recommend against the neons...they're pretty fragile these days, think it's just "bad breeding" or something. Cardinal tetras look about the same and are hardier. If you don't get any danios, I'd say you could get about 12 cardinals (or other brightly colored tetras). In a tank as small as 20 gallons, I wouldn't recommend try to have two different schools of small fish...it looks better to have one larger school, and the fish seem a little happier.<br>  <br>  So, a revised list:<br>  1 dwarf gourami<br>  6 corydoras<br>  12 cardinal tetras|`|asXq2cFDaa	The list of fish you have sounds good. Maybe a few more cories. Make sure to do a fishless cycle before adding fish- <a href="http://www.cichlid-forum.com/articles/fishless_cycling.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.cichlid-forum.com/articles/fi...</a><br>  Add the fish 3 at a time so after the cycle you will not overload the bio load on the tank.|`|v4YxLX9Daa	There a rule: one inch per gallon for fish that reach 3". Zebra dianos are very hardy, also dwarf gourami are just as hardy as zebra diano. But remember you can only keep one dwarf gourami in a tank (when they are small tanks) for yours you might be able to have two. Just make sure you have a fair amount of hiding spaces. You could get some guppies, love them, or a small school of tetras. They are pretty hardy. Also, some bottom feeders. Cory catfish (at least three), A small personel pleco, (bristenose pleco, pitbull, clown). Though they aren't really hardy, and should only be added to a fully cycled tank.  You could keep a 5 maybe 6 zebra dianos, they are schooling fish, and tend to get a little fin nippy when alone. :P So there you go, but why do you want only hardy fish anyway, just wait for your tank to cycle and you can keep hardy fish and more.|`|eZUmtyhNaa	Danios, imo, get boring very fast unfortunately. Dwarf gouramis are considered pretty fragile, since many are imported with some internal problems. I've had luck with them though.<br>  <br>  Regular gouramis (Blue, Gold, Pearl etc) are very hardy fish.<br>  <br>  most catfish are hardy as well<br>  <br>  Female bettas are really neat in a community tank<br>  <br>  Golden wonder killies have cool personalities<br>  <br>  Swordtails have many colors. maybe a tank with 3 black ones and 3 velvets?<br>  <br>  Just look around for inspiration...|`|fBGq6BL6aa	I think the rule is 1 inch of fish for every gallon of water you have. So if you're going to get a big fish then I'd only get a couple. I've read before that zebra fish, tetra, and gourami are the most hardy of fish. I prefer the loaches because I just like how they are. Plus I've trained my dojo loaches to eat out of my hand.|`|MJbXxrjXaa	Angels|`|fB6Vz7gTaa	<a href="http://www.aquariumfish.net/information/how_to_choose_fish.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.aquariumfish.net/information/...</a><br>  go here, it should have all the info you need!<br>  ggod luck! hope i helped!
5KKW7LMBaa	swollen udder is a pretty good indicator, but according to my vet waxed over teats is not too accurate an indicator....<br>   <br>  i have my mare in foal for the first time, and while i'm not expert in this matter i've asked my vet a heap of questions! <br>  <br>  my vet said a really good indicator of when they are about to foal is the muscles around their backside/rump and around the vaginal area. it all tends to "loosen up" around there, as a result of the hormones that are released when they are about to foal. this loosening up is the body getting prepared to give birth. <br>  <br>  a similar thing happens to women when they are about to give birth and their bellies "drop" , as the body sends out hormonal messages for the muscles to relax, especially the muscles around the pelvic area.<br>  <br>  so if her muscles are loose and floppy when you press around her rump region and if her tail is floppy when you lift it up apparently this is a good way to predict she will foal soon.<br>  <br>  i hope this helps!|`|UIM8X38Oaa	Sounds like she is ready to go at anytime.  From my experience it could be within 24 hours or up to a week.  Keep an eye on her.  <br>  Good Luck<br>  Jenny|`|CuGT5X6eaa	it looks to me like she should be due very soon,I have never had a prego mare,but I know that those are very large and you can see the waxation,so I would say quite soon,I may be wrong,but I would guess within the week...maybe a few days...very soon...
BMri9tITaa	Bettas are known for being a slower fish.  Goldfish can be tempermental and would die in that condition, even with an aerator.<br>  <br>  Some nice zippy fish would be zebra danios, tiger barbs, praecox rainbows, and cherry barbs.  Of those, I would most recommend the zebra danios.  After you're done racing them you should put them in a heated, filtered tank that holds at least 15 gallons, with at least five of them in there.|`|45YOCtufaa	If its minnow racing then you would obviously need a minnow.....|`|H9Nvo2gxaa	no fish can live in a bowl. <br>  <br>  You shouldn't send fish home with party-goers, they are not prepared for a fish and likely do not want a fish. The fish will die very quickly if you give them to friends as they will likely put them in unsuitable environments.

W67WGs8Gaa	I can understand not wanting to leave her in a kennel for long periods of time but you may want to at least try it for a week or so if she only does when you are not at home. Give her something to chew on. That way she will not be practicing the bad habit while you are not there to correct her. It may seem harsh but sometimes learning is hard and I assure you she will love you none the less. While you are at home put her straight in the kennel after the bad behavior to show her that it is not acceptable. Leave her there for about 20 minutes or so, paying NO attention to her and then let her out. If she abandons the behavior for a while, play with her and praise her. If she continues, try it all over again until she wants to stop. If this doesn't help, you can try taking her to obedience training which doesn't usually cost a whole lot. You can also catch her in the act and put mustard on her tongue or some other substance she hates. Hope this helps.|`|Vp83Fuakaa	we have a puggle she ate her poop at first she is 6 now howls like a beagle at every thing will eat until she chokes we have tried many things but nothing has worked either she is smart but only thinks of her self . but she doesn't chew on anything that's not food .we put her in the kennel when we work for 5 hours or so.|`|RHMNWifQaa	There is this product that worked for us:<br>  bitter apple:  <a href="http://www.atouchoflove.ca/shop/images/Bitter-Apple.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.atouchoflove.ca/shop/images/B...</a><br>  <br>  and u spray it where ever she is chewing.<br>  My dog ripped out WALLS!<br>  Yeah, intense I know.

Hopefully she will grow out of it. I bought kongs for my dogs and fill them with peanut butter, then i put it in the freezer.  It seems to keep them occupied for awhile and the kongs are very hard to chew up, even my pit hasn't destroyed one yet. The thing about puggles is that although cute, they have the worse traits from the 2 breeds.  Most puggle owners complain about how obnoxious they are.|`|gwUMipsUaa	Put stuff up and see about either getting her a playmate or doggy daycare.|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	The only answer is crate her when you can't watch her. If you aren't there to correct her when she chews, the only thing you can do is keep her safe and crate her so she can't chew.
6SeWCfUfaa	Because he does feel left out.  Why can't the dog go in the basement with the kids?<br>  <br>  So, he's whining when he's sent to him room for bad behavior.  lol ... They're like 3 year old kids.  You have to set the rules, make it clear, and make the punsihment fit the crime.  A 5-10 min time out is plenty long for a dog.

gwUMipsUaa	There's really nothing to keep dogs know for shedding from shedding.  Liquid B complex will only help if there's a deficiency in that area.  Talk to your vet.|`|vPde97E2aa	There's absolutely NOTHING you can put IN or ON any dog to stop shedding.|`|RZAjrv8Xaa	You can not control shedding from any type of dog. You can only control  by how much you groom and brush your animal. Any type of "pill" or shampoo or things such as that would be in my opinion a joke and a way to steal your money. Dogs shed b/c of the season and for different type of coats they get during cold or hot weather. They also shed for stress or nerves. Give your dogs a bath once a week or once every two weeks. Scrub nice into their skin and rinse completely. Then brush the coat with a good de-shedding brush. This is the best you are going to be able to do for you dog.
zWFJBlJZaa	She will probably by OK, but you can help things out by putting a teaspoon of corn oil in her food for the next couple of days.  This will help to make things in her digestive tract a little slippery and will help her to eliminate the rubber band if the stomach acids don't disintegrate it.  The problem with foreign objects in the stomach/intestines is that they can cause blockage or can cause the intestines to get tied up (which requires surgery).    If for some reason she starts to act sickly and refuses to eat or does not eliminate stool -- get her to the Vet quick!|`|gwUMipsUaa	Keep an eye out for bowel obstruction.

He should be kept as quiet as possible for a couple of days.....sometimes impossible, I know!<br>  <br>  Even though he's "mounting" your female, he's not going to be able to impregnate her, so don't worry about that!  At least now, you don't have to worry about him developing testicular cancer, in later years!<br>  <br>  Are you going to have your female spayed, soon?  Spayed cats have a decreased risk of developing Uterus and Mammary CANCER in later years.

Try to eliminate anything in the home that emits a certain smell and you might find your problem. 9 times out of 10 this is the problem. Don't take the cat to the vet unless you start noticing a sluggish, droopy behavior in your cat... then it could be a sign of slight constipation.|`|MZbQ5MPdaa	I would say one of two things...either he isn't able to digest because of age(maybe smaller pellets would better for him) OR, he is shedding  more because of his age and licking himself more and getting hairballs.Hairballs will upset his tummy therefore throwing up .I had a cat that threw up every day and the vet said her digestive tract was bad.|`|OCMSTxYfaa	Maybe a trip to the vet is on order.

bab98853150b199df79ea228be16f757aa	Your cat is not blind.  The things you described show your cat has normal vision.  If you are truly worried, look for 'cloudiness' in the eye or on the cornea (the outside of the eyeball) and if you see that, take your cat to the vet for further examination.|`|UNFxjNHkaa	normally when they start to go blind, you can see a tint of blue in their pupils -<br>  <br>  its happening to my doggy =(|`|U00iZcvVaa	The first thing you must have to do is to take your cat to the veterinary.

Mine squints when it's happy or content. Maybe it's not blind if it never encounters the typical difficulties associated with  blindness. Also for her to be sensitive to light would explain some parts of her behavior. A vet probably won't be able to do vision correction surgery, especially if it's hereditary,which it seems it is if she's been that way since a kitten. and even if they could, it would be very expensive|`|7dRRkmObaa	You may think this is stupid but it will work trust me! Get a newspaper and swing it at your cats face, but stop just before you hit it. If the cat flinches it's not blind, but if the cat doesn't move a muscle he is.
GSf09ALBaa	Gretel is to die for.  And yes, blood work and fluids during the spay.  <br>  <br>  Does anybody else find this odd that the shelter isn't spaying the dog? <br>  Eon, recheck with the shelter about this.  I have never heard of a shelter not spaying and neutering before adopting.<br>  <br>  Hey, you adopted!!!  That is all that matters and it sound to me like you are doing a wonderful job. Bless you.|`|pvgwJwxvaa	absolutely do the blood work and have her on fluids!<br>  <br>  the blood work is self explanatory and fluids not only help her recover faster but they also help maintain her blood pressure during the surgery.  all f or surgery patient receive an iv catheter and iv fluids during surgery.|`|5tHqpR5haa	Wow $400 for shots and to be micro chipped?  That's pretty expensive (at least for around here, Maine).  You could look into seeing if there are any local vet or vet tech programs in your area (or within a reasonable drive).  They usually offer low cost spaying and neutering to give their students practice.  Everything is supervised by an experienced vet and completely safe for your dog.  I had my two kittens neutered this way.<br>  <br>  I would also consider shopping around to see what other vets charge because your vet seems quite costly, but that may be the norm for your area.<br>  <br>  BTW - she's adorable!|`|AA11244754	okay, you spent $400 on a dog that wasn't vetted, am I understanding you correctly??? You do need to get the bloodwork done because that will tell you if she's infected with heartworms, if she has any medical issues that will be an ongoing expense, but I wouldn't spent that much money on her for just her adoption fee!  I refused to pay $120 for a dog that wasn't vetted when I was able to adopt one for $125 that was up on all of his shots, neutered, was on heartworm preventative and had a clean bill of health!   Also most shelters give you a certificate for the shots and all as well as the surgery.  If not they will adopt the dog out at a lower price or even give the dog to you for free as long as you agree to spay/neuter the dog and take the prove to them then you don't have to pay for the dog at all.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	What was the $400 for??<br>  <br>  Almost every shelter I know it is mandatory for dog to be fixed by them or within 30 days of adoption & the fee is much lower than $400. Unless you are paying the $400 for her adoption, shots & spay by their vet then they want to charge you additional fee of $120 for bloodwork & fluids. Normally I don't suggest doing bloodwork but with shelter dogs you don't know usually any history & then I suggest bloodwork to be certain. I can't give any answer on the fluids - I never have been asked about fluids & would assume them should be part of the spay.  But often vets doing the cheap work for shelters will charge anything extra they can get to make up the difference. ( Sorry vets but I have seen this done many times)
1gDTiPVyaa	Keep and eye on him and watch for any unusual behavior. Did it sound like a wet sneeze or a dry sneeze? Go to www.birds-online.de and check out the "droppings as indicators of illness" link and see if his poops look normal.  It's a budgie specific site, but it can give you a pretty good idea of what to look for and what the difference is between normal and healthy and early signs of illness. Watch him and see if he's breathing normally, not making any whistling noises or breathing heavily, not panting or looking like he's gasping for air. If you don't see anything else unusual then probably everything is okay. <br>  <br>  The tossing feathers out of the cage is probably just his particular little quirk.

snJUxopcaa	I'm so sorry to hear about your fish. That's a horrible position to be put in, but I can understand wanting him out of pain and in peace.  I did some research, and I become very attached to animals, so even though some "humane" ways are listed as approved by top organizations, I still think of the animal first and how it would feel.<br>  <br>  I found a website which had a paragraph about one way I thought was particularly easy and painless.  Here it is:<br>  <br>  Buy pure clove oil. You can get it at a health food store for under $10 for a ? ounce bottle. Put the fish in a medium sized mixing bowl in his own water from his tank. In a small jar or something with a lid (I use a cleaned out jelly jar) mix the clove oil with tank water. Put the lid on and shake it like crazy over and over until the liquid in it is white. Then pour a little into the mixing bowl with the fish. Swirl it with your hand. The fish might fight it just a little bit and then slow down. Then pour a little more in and swirl again. He should just go to sleep and appear dead. If he doesn't, try a little more of the clove solution, always shaking very well before an addition to the bowl. When he goes to sleep, leave him in the solution for a good 10 minutes and then put him in a small cup or zip-lock baggie and put him in the freezer. Pain free death. Very humane. We should all go so easily.<br>  <br>  Again, so sorry.  Good luck ):|`|QrjjiOgTaa	please don't put your fish in the dark or the cold. clove oil is what they use at a vets office to put a fish down or "relax" them for surgey. petsmart advocates baking soda, i tried this once and it took the fish a long time to die. not nice. drs fosters and smith online sells a product called euthanze, you can try that. i heard vodka works well, i used rubbing alochol and it wasn't that successful|`|GmzxBW7Caa	Maybe you could put either way too hot water or way too cold water in his tank.You could also let him out of the water for a while,suffocating him. :(<br>  I think the best thing to do is to contact a vet. Maybe, just maybe, they could cure him or something. If not.....<br>  <br>                              Good Luck   ; (<br>      maybe you could get a new betta fish?|`|MGfBOuUNaa	my fish was like that, he does eat the pices of food at the bottem his time will come soon, dont kill it, it feels no pain, he is just dying slowely so dont disturb him, put him in a box and burry him when he does pass though PLEASE?! in your back or front yard, so he can rest peacfully. and its much more humane to let the fish die on its own so he dosnt go through stress with the cold water thing, if he has a favorite toy than it may die peacefully under there, also he may one day look like he dyed dont be fooled he maybe pretending, touch him first to make sure he did die, and REST IN PEACE LITTLE FISHY!|`|JsBb732Maa	I read in a gold fish book that the humane way to euthanize a fish is to put him in a wet paper towel, then in a plastic baggie and then in your freezer. They will die of the cold, their metabolism will slow down placing them in a comatose state prier to final expiration. So sorry to hear about your Betta. :-(|`|JGq9rKBOaa	I'm assuming you don't have any clove oil lying around, I'd say decapitation is the fastest, surest way. <br>  <br>  If you do happen to have some clove oil, you can use that to anesthetize the fish before killing him.<br>  <br>  This article deals with the clove oil/vodka methods:<br>  <a href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-the-most-humane-way-to-euthanize-a-fish.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-the-most...</a><br>  <br>  It advocates against decapitation - and anything except vodka - but the AVMA does list decapitation as a humane method.
pvgwJwxvaa	if you are feeding a good, high quality food you dont need a vitamin supplement unless your vet says otherwise.|`|c94cb8f580bda5a5570def6aaaf5c33eaa	Yes they are.  No food can give a pet exactly what is needed to maintain great health.  Just like the food we eat, processing food takes away vitamins, minerals, and nutrition's that is necessary to maintain the body's functions.  NuVet Plus is just not a vitamin, it is an immune system builder.  Read about NuVet Plus at the following source, and use the order code 42299 to save 50% off resale prices.  It's great!
Js5w44uraa	sorry, but you should NOT have put them in the same cage immediately because your new bird could be sick and therefore infect your older bird. Here's what you need to do: bring your new bird to an avian vet to make sure that his eye wasn't injured and to just make sure that he is healthy. Then when you get home you need to keep the birds in different rooms just to make sure that the new bird doesn't have any hidden illness that they vet might not have caught. Keep them in different rooms for a few weeks (they will probably call to each other, this is totally normal). After the quarantine  period is up, bring the bird in his cage to the room where you have the old bird and put the cages next to each other. This way they can see and hear each other and the new bird can get used to his new surroundings, do this for a week or so. Finally, i would slowly introduce them to each other by letting them play out of their cages so that if one of them gets bullied he can escape and won't get hurt. If all goes well, then you may be able to keep them in the same cage if it is big enough (24x18x18 at the minimum for two birds)  As a side note, the good thing about having a quarantine period, is it will give you one on one time to tame your new parakeet because once you put two birds together they are harder to tame.|`|EJpiaCMQaa	Sounds like the older budgie is territorial towards the new one.  He is saying to the new budgie, "This is my home and you're not welcome."  The new budgie sounds nervous and scared.  Keep a close eye on the pair and see if they are really fighting.  One sure sign of a fight is a squawking parakeet (usually the one getting picked on).  You may have to separate the two budgies.  They may have to separated indefinitely.  I keep my three male budgies all in separate cages.  That way I have no fighting problems.  I have two out of the three that will fight for sure if they are housed together.  Birds are like people, some get along, while others don't.  You have to adapt to the birds unique personalities.  About the budgie having one eye open and one closed, my budgies do that often.  It's very normal.  I think it's so cute.  He may be trying to rest part of his brain, while keeping the other part of his brain active.  I've observed this many times in my budgies.  I hope I've helped you out.|`|AA11640918	First off you definatly shoudlnt have put him in the cage. You need to put them in separate cages but also separate rooms.<br>  <br>  Wait a couple weeks to make sure the new one isnt sick. <br>  <br>  After you need to then bring the new one and his cage in the same roomk and another week to leave them close to each other not in same cage b/c they ill sow territorial behavior.<br>  <br>  After a week put them together. They may go nose to nose it isnt fighting unless they dont stop or one pushes te otehr and screetches loudly.<br>  <br>  If you have the budgie you already have tame you need to trame the new one too.<br>  <br>  Goodluk|`|Gr6Xe1gGaa	You must separate the two for about a week. Try letting both of them out of the cage so they can somehow interact.|`|tsCsNDIsaa	Everyone gave you good answers. here's more. You need seperate cages, seperate rooms, for AT LEAST 2-3wks. During that time, work on training the new bird (assuming the old one is tame already) finger/shoulder train, etc. After you are sure the new bird is not sick, put the cages side by side, cage doors closed. Let them get use to each other. They will both be curious. Put on some soothing music, talk to them, etc. After a couple of days, you should be able to put them together, but I suggest you TOTALLY clean out the biggest cage, rearrange toys, perches and whatnot so it will feel like a new cage for BOTH of them, and that way, the old bird won't be so protective. Get new toys if you can so he won't be possessive of that too. Personally, my Budgies are free roaming, and only go in their cage to eat and sleep at night, but I'm home all day, and I have that luxury. Even when I do leave, they are well trained, and don't get into anything while I'm gone, and my house is 'birdproofed'. They have perches and branches all around, fly around all day in a certain areas. Keep them in an area of the house that gets a lot of traffic, actvity, and normal noise. Play music for them when you are away. This keeps them calm and content.  If you let them out, please be responsible, they are just like having a small child, and MUST be looked after every moment. If you keep them caged they MUST have enough room to fly around in the cage. They are social flocking birds, and should eventually enjoy each other's company. remeber, Budgies need AT LEAST TWO hours of flying time EACH DAY. Do some research, and good luck!!
Ow6lKFXiaa	With a milky texture it's probably something that required refrigeration, in which case it most likely has a short shelf life and needs to be disposed of.

Uigfp5uOaa	when you first get a tank it needs  to cycle (freshwater- then introduce fish and food waste-bacteria grows and breaks that down into ammonia-then bacteria begin to grow to break ammonia down into nitrites-then more bacteria grows to break nitrite into nitrates, which is why you change 25% water every week/ every couple of weeks.)<br>  your tank is cycling. <br>  <br>  call the fish store and ask what they recommend, but il learned the hard way you just have to let it cycle. buy ammonia tests and nitrate tests. once the ammonia is at 0 and the nitrate is higher, your tank is cycled.|`|BMri9tITaa	It sounds like you didn't cycle your tank before you added your kissing fish (kissing gouramis, I'm assuming? <a href="http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/Kissing_gourami)." rel="nofollow">http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/Kissing_g...</a>  Your fish are probably sad because they're slowly being burned and poisoned.  They can't breathe.<br>  <br>  The cloudiness was caused by ammonia, which your fish pooped out.  This is part of the cycling process.<br>  <br>  The cycling process, the nitrogen cycle, is how your filter breaks down the ammonia your fish expel.  It turns the toxic ammonia into toxic nitrite, and then into the less-toxic nitrate.  Your water changes remove the nitrate from the water and prevent it from building up.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/Nitrogen_cycle" rel="nofollow">http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/Nitrogen_...</a><br>  <br>  You kicked off the nitrogen cycle by adding the fish in there.<br>  <br>  What you can do now is add a chemical that can nullify the toxins in your water.

Thats how their mothers carry them when they are kittens.  But like Cherie said, if you pick them up like that, it is best to put support on their bottoms with another hand.  I usually dont like to do it because it annoys them - (probably because they're not in control.. haha)..  I think it looks mean, but really, its not mean at all - you and you're brother are fine!|`|XavY3fiWaa	It's only safe for a mom cat to pick up her kittens like that, unless your supporting her bottom when you pick her up like that.

If the edges of a wound aren't brought together soon enough, they may have to "debride" the wound (make fresh edges) for it to heal properly.  It needs to be taken care of asap, and it's essential to keep not only the wounded dog's mouth off it, but also the other dog.  It will keep it wet & irritated, inhibiting healing.<br>  Anything bleeding should be considered an emergency.|`|gwUMipsUaa	I would probably take her now to the emergency vet.

If so, why not ask them if they will help you by introducing you to the families they sit for? This allows you to babysit a few times in their place so that you can earn money.  (If you ask several friends instead of one, no one friend will bear the burden of losing too much income to you). Plus, you can become a back-up babysitter when you friends are busy or sick or something.<br>  <br>  3) Are you allowed to pet sit? People may be willing to pay you to walk their dogs or care for their pets while they are out of town.<br>  <br>  4) Depending on where you live, an outdoor job might work.Shoveling snow, Mowing grass, Raking leaves, cleaning dog poop out of someone's back yard (yucky, but if you realllllly want that kitten...). <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|GjeEbxkzaa	hmm why dont you ask for ￡10 a week or summin to do more chores and get a kitteh from the RSPCA for ￡50. they're fully vaccinated there. <br>  <br>  (sorry if you dont live in the UK)|`|huXBAulFaa	i have no idea but you should get a munchkin cat.|`|w1lh1INHaa	Can you be a pooper-scooper?

73f4817c9af75121ee93853e03437fc1aa	She's too young yet - puppies have the attention span of a toddler.  Keep working with her on coming when she's called and teaching the stay command wouldn't hurt either, although that one is tougher.  The problem with the dog parks is that other dogs may not be as well behaved as your dog and minor things can escalate out of control very quickly.  We have a fox terrier (talk about high energy levels!) and when we take him to the park - ALWAYS on lead - my grandson likes to hold the leash and he lets Toby literally run around him in circles.  Grandson gets dizzy and the dog gets exercise - they both love it!  Of course we're right there in case he drops the lead, but we've never had a problem - just be sure the lead is good and long.  We use a retractable leash attached to a regular leash so he's got a good 10 foot length for "circle time" lol.|`|gwUMipsUaa	When it's in a fence.<br>  <br>  Our dog parks are both fenced.

Also you will learn how to teach her what come means and what to do if she ignores the command.  On the come command, many dogs learn that they have a choice whether or not to come.  You want her to learn that come means go to you and not run the other direction.  The best way to teach her is to use your leash and many treats.  Do not give her the opportunity to have a choice in the matter.  Many dogs are ruined to the come command because the owners did not establish a good foundation or understanding of the command before removing the leash.|`|t78DA6Dpaa	I never let my dogs off leash without being in a fenced in environment. Cavaliers are hunting dogs and will chase things in an instant and will be totally oblivious to your calls. I have 6 Cavaliers. All are obedience trained but i will never trust them off leash. I have even read in the books about the Cavalier breed that they should never be let off leash in public because they are known to chase a butterfly and run directly into traffic. <br>  <br>  if i were you i wouldn't risk my dogs life like that.

0rRkRAnJaa	You'll need to go down anyway to skip out his stable. You can't have him standing in 24hours of muck!<br>  <br>  Yes he needs hay, and fresh water too. He will need to be exercised too; even if it's only leading him out in hand. <br>  Horses have a physical and physcological need to chew for 16-20 hours a day. They only produce saliva when they chew and it is the saliva that neutralizes the stomach acid, reducing the risk of gastric ulcers. Also, without any hay to chew he will become stressed and upset.<br>  <br>  In short - YES you have to go and see to him.|`|IMPvzBk1aa	First of all, if you are stalling him because he was wormed, you are supposed to be watching the manure for worms...most horses are not kept in after worming unless a major infestation is suspected, in which case the horse may colic or develop laminitis following the deworming.  Any manure passed should be promptly removed from the stall so he isn't re-ingesting the worms and eggs right off the bat.  I would definitely go down and keep watch, and give him hay to keep him occupied.  Hand walk him for exercise, and if he passes manure, inspect it for worms, and dispose of it accordingly.  When you are with him, observe him for any signs of colic.|`|0efe43c88dbe3f09246d65d290936ed3aa	Firstly I find it odd that your horse had to stay in all day just because he was wormed, but to each their own.<br>  <br>  Secondly, yes, you should go down and at least check on him.  He may have enough hay to last him the night, but you should still go, because he may have eaten all his hay.  A horse can never have enough roughage, it's the most important part of a horse's diet.<br>  <br>  So, go check :)|`|5kUxkun3aa	firstly it is recommended to leave a horse in when you worm so that if any are passed you take them away when you muck out.instead of them dropping them on your grasses. i would pop bk and check him.even if its just to make sure he hasn't had a reaction to the wormer.skip him off and check his hay.|`|0sZTvae8aa	I don't  imagine that he will starve without one hay feeding, but if you can't go can you get someone else to do it for you.  then sometime you can repay the favor|`|ff42beaeb7a8ee5d3b32dd2655c08c36aa	he needs hay tonite,<br>  yes he could survive without it, but he is going to be very unhappy and bored with not only being forced to stay in but with nothing to eat.  |`|9SLfahVpaa	well if you gave it to him this morning then yea... u can give it to him again, but nt to much.

I keep one on hand all the time.|`|lNJgpiAYaa	My horse would eat around it in his feed.

Just make sure to keep the ants off the molasses.

Mg8zk1n7aa	Can you catch the dog (safely)? If no one will admit to owning the dog then I would try and catch him and take him to a shelter. Please don't poison the dog - I'm sorry for the loss of your cats and I understand your anger, but it is the owner (whoever that is) of the dog that should be blamed. Is there anyone else you can call beside Animal Control? I'm thinking the SPCA or local pound or something...<br>  <br>  Hope it can be resolved.|`|jyGTlpzTaa	I would keep harassing animal control until they get it sorted . You wont get toxins that wont hurt the cat, and harming the dog could cause some nasty neighbourly disputes.<br>  <br>  <br>  Btw, did you know that the vast majority of people cannot tell a pit bull from other breeds? See if you can pick the pit bull out from the following:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pitbullsontheweb.com/petbull/findpit.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pitbullsontheweb.com/petbull/...</a><br>  <br>  Unless you know the breed standards really well, that dog could be any number of breeds, its not really fair to just assume its a pit bull. Of course, you may know loads about bull breeds and be able to tell the difference, and if so I apologise.|`|Lqy9Lc9Oaa	A gun...LOL - Just KIDDING.  Animal control should do something!

5GZxWrxAaa	Cavaliers can have from 1 - 6 although there have been more reported but not usually.  The number of pups also depends on if it is a natural breeding or AI, as natural breeding statistically have a higher number.  It also depends on the age of the mom and dad...and the mom usually has a larger number the second litter, so if she has 3 the first time, she will probably have 4 the next  Nothing is for sure, Cavaliers are also...great at having false pregnancies.  I had 1 girl who actually delivered a water sack with no pups at all.|`|t78DA6Dpaa	Depends on how many eggs the female drops. They have an average of 4. My first one had 3 and tied 3 times.

Knew of a Cavalier that had 8 but that is really unheard of.|`|uMyMHDPDaa	Usually a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel has about 4 to 6 puppies.|`|4KTmiQ0paa	Usually 2-6, though more is not unheard of.|`|3giaPYe8aa	However many eggs are shed and fertilized.

vYeS5mYnaa	my friends have two siamese cats and one is totally bald on her belly from the other cat grooming her. is it possible that the third cat is stressed out and is not bald b/c is over grooming the other 2?|`|x0WZE0i4aa	May I just say LOL to AOK's answer!  Could be true...<br>  <br>  If it's just a bald spot, with no redness or inflammation, I think it could be they've both had a minor wound (maybe from a fight?) which has been hidden under the fur.  Finally it heals, the scab comes off, taking the hair with it...  <br>  <br>  I also had a cat used to get little scabs every now and again (ended up like I've described above).  I thought maybe my other cat was nipping her when they had playfights.  Vet checked them and wasn't worried.  She stopped getting them after we found out she had a food allergy... Bad luck if it's 2 out of 3, but if you've changed food, or they've had an unusual treat lately, maybe it's worth considering.<br>  <br>  I'd watch it for a while and see what happens.  If they get more, I guess a trip to the vet would be in order.
nPdKJyK4aa	O' my guinea pigs should NEVER be housed outside. There are too many dangers and they require specific temperatures. They need lots of care and tend to not get that when they are outside. THey love being involved with your family and become wild when not included.

YQfEOeStaa	There are a couple options for you to try.<br>  <br>  1. Dental work -- a good mouth cleaning can do wonders. This is expensive and usually requires sedation of the dog.<br>  <br>  2. Give him acidophilus with his food. This helps his digestion so not only does he fart less (yay) his breath will be cleaner (kind of a breath mint for his digestive system).<br>  <br>  3. This is the easiest thing and the least expensive thing to do. Get some pure essential oil of peppermint. Put a drop in the water dish every morning. Make sure it is pure peppermint oil, not some imitation. It should cost less than $10 at GNC. This is not harmful for your dog at all, and in fact, you can use it, too. But remember it is POTENT. Not sweet like a peppermint candy. It is a cleansing agent as well as a breath freshener. You will have a great time getting kisses from your dog after this.<br>  <br>  Our dog went from having death breath (her breath was MUCH worse than her farts) to having wonderful smelling breath. And, a bottle of peppermint oil lasts months.|`|L22hVXTIaa	Could it be that he needs a dental?  The usual cause of very bad breath in dogs is their teeth.  If you're not brushing them and having regular dental cleanings for him, that could be the reason.  Also, I noticed that when I changed dog foods some years ago from Royal Canin to Wellness, my dogs stopped having stinky farts and burps (sorry to be so blunt) and improved their breath.  Honestly, my dogs do not have bad breath anymore.|`|zWFJBlJZaa	I use Dental Fresh by Synergy Labs in the water bowl.  It does work to freshen breath and remove plaque and tartar.  It contains stabilized Chlorine Dioxide, sodium bicarbonate,, and Chlorophyll.<br>  <br>  Or if you want to be totally organic -- try parsley in his food!!!|`|DU0F48B3aa	bad breath is often caused by bad teeth and gums have you had it checked|`|PCNYIhtyaa	I'm not a vet, but if it's beyond the usual "dog breath," they could have a rotting back tooth, which smells terrible.  Check to see if your dog has trouble chewing hard things, because they won't want to use the rotting tooth.  If so, you should consider taking your dog to the vet.|`|zKyy1gE2aa	If your dog is not a puppy and has bad breath, chances are they are getting dental disease if it's so bad you can't stand it. You may want to take them to the vet to get their teeth cleaned or at least some antibiotics for some infection that may be present.|`|knFrwCxcaa	um i think you will just to have to live with it i have four dogs and they all got bad breath but i don't think you can change it|`|yMRY5cgxaa	If it is a continual thing he may be sick.<br>  OR get him to stop licking places that the sun don't shine!|`|TYZMvMrqaa	Maybe a rotten tooth|`|92mVvHIuaa	because they dont brush their teeth|`|BdlGBdE5aa	Dogs bad breath is caused by the same things that causes human bad breath, the bacteria on the top of the tongue.  To cure bad breath you must remove this bacteria.

8owlj2xHaa	Add more food. Take some flake or pellets and smash them up real small and feed more than the fish can eat. Bury some food in the substrate or put it directly in the filter. Ammonia is the FIRST stage of the cycle.|`|hWLO2br7aa	you could add more fish food. that will speed up the cycle. the ammonia is the last component of the cycle though. you'll have to bring up the nitrites and nitrates first and then the ammonia will show up. if you only have the two in there it'll be at least a month, probably more. good luck!
hIyjdXr9aa	Larger angelfish eat tetras.  Smaller angelfish get their fins nipped by tetras.  So mixing tetras and angelfish of any size is a bad idea.  Angelfish are cichlids, which means they like their space and yours is probably feeling overcrowded with just the fish already in your tank.  <br>  Conclusion:  Nope, don't add tetras, unless your purpose for them is as a live food treat for your other fish.  <br>  Idea:  If you want live food, buy feeder guppies.  They're cheaper than tetras.|`|QrjjiOgTaa	if you get the bigger "chubbier" kind i think you'll be alright. i think if you keep them in a school they won't bother the angel fish, but im not psychic when it comes to fish behavior so good luck!!!
iXijnCxOaa	Most vets know squat about nutrition.<br>  <br>  Keep doing what you are doing.<br>  <br>  I find it interesting that you have fewer allergy issues with a higher quality food.  I've found that myself... and yes, dirty dogs make me sneeze.|`|687852ecae21fabd1dfd4f89a2eefd48aa	My mini- Schnauzer likes Iams blue bag and Science Diet.  Neither one is cheap.<br>  <br>  The BIG thing is not to feed him/her table scraps other than veggies, (some raw - some cooked), or raw fruits, pieces of apple, and others. <br>  <br>  Must be careful since Schnauzers are prone to diabetes.|`|nFANuZUmaa	Ultimately you are the one who should decide on what your dog eats and there are good and bad holistic and commerical brands.<br>  <br>  1) Holistic<br>  <br>  Learn to read labels and get a basic understanding of dog nutrition.  Often a food labeled Weltstarcks certain nutrients and only claclanis because they use "fresh" ingingredientsd should be supplemented with vitmins etc.<br>  <br>  2) "Grocery Store"<br>  <br>  Grocery store brands are different than specialty store brands.   Grocery store are absolutely no good generally and are sold for cheap in Vons etc.  Even if labeled holistic ingrediintermentst good.  Examples of such brands are Purina and such.<br>  <br>  3) "Specialty"<br>  <br>  These brands, while more expensive, are sold in only Vets offices and specialty stores like Pet Co or Pet Smart.  These include "wholeistic" and "Commerical".<br>  <br>  The important thing to look for is that the number one listed ingredient is a meat.  Not a meat by product or grain.  I have no experience with the brands you mention but suggest you read the label, pick up a good book on nutrition,  find out if there are any breed considerations and then start reading labels.|`|PM23RDycaa	That's what he gets paid to recommend.

I know for a fact that that dental hygienist doesn't give a **** about gum, but I'm sure the office appreciates the money they get for pushing it.|`|B8Gwxo1laa	Unless your dog has a health issue I can't see why it would help him (or You) to change.|`|2be14aaeddfaa187fb19a7f9392bf657aa	Most vets don't know much about dog food ingredients and tend to recommend those foods they hear the most about...those that are pushed by reps and are heavily advertised. Continue to feed a good quality food like you are. <br>  <br>  Nutrition is most definitely a mandatory class in vet school, however it is general and covers everything from cats to rats, dog to hogs. Also classes are NOT taught or sponsored by Hill's or any other food company. Vets do NOT get paid or sponsored to sell any pet foods.Vets like all other pet businesses must pay wholesale prices and sell at retail. Selling food is really not worth a vets time, space aggravation since money made is very, very minimal.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Raw is not good for your dog.  You and your dog can get sick eating it.  Vets see it all the time.  There's a whole fad towards feeding raw food these days, but in my opinion, it's very misguided.  (Don't believe me though, get on one of the many raw food groups on yahoo group and see how many people a day talk about their dogs yarking up the raw stuff they've been fed.)<br>  <br>  As far as the dogfood, I don't think he was bashing on the kibble.  He was bashing on the raw.
wD9sdGhZaa	At my LFS, they aren't in those petco/petsmart cups, they're in rectangular acrylic containers that are a much larger, and I have seen them changing the water when I've been there.<br>  <br>  Obviously it's not as good as a real filtered tank long-term, but if they have a high enough turnover and sell them quickly, that's not as much of an issue.<br>  <br>  When you think about it, how do bettas end up at the stores?  They're shipped...the betta was able to survive during shipping when not in a filtered tank.  So for short periods of time before sale, I think this is less of an issue than people make it out to be.|`|jyGTlpzTaa	In Britain pet store keep bettas the way they should be kept...in spacious, aerated tanks. Usually with other fish, sometimes not. We dont have problems keeping them properly, our pet shops still make plenty of money, so why should you guys have a problem with it????|`|ta3wiCvtaa	There have been places that set up long regular tanks with many dividers in them and one betta in each space. Female bettas can also be housed together normally. They could also simply be put in one gallon bowls on heat mats and customers could be given proper care sheets. None of the fish that pet stores sell are in proper sized tanks. It's up to the customer to provide permanent homes. <br>  A fish is a living breathing animal. Why is mistreating a fish so different from mistreating a dog? People are horrified at the condition puppy mills are in, but when it comes to bettas they put them in those conditions themselves. Fish feel just as much pain as dogs and cats.|`|ur5wDhkMaa	:o) The assumption is bad husbandry promotes bad husbandry. I agree with the British statement on Betta care, if you kept fish like that in the UK you would be prosecuted for animal abuse and a certain DIY store was forced to stop selling fish that were kept in better conditions than what is the American norm. We however treat goldfish with the same contempt and you often see questions about tanks sold for goldfish in the UK that would be too small for a Betta never mind a goldfish. This is swings and roundabouts, Betta's are more popular in America, Goldfish in Britain, both get abused because of their commercial appeal.<br>  <br>  Oscars tend to be the one we both abuse with equal venom, because like Betta and Goldfish they are cheap to buy. When you say false impression you're right up to a point, the information is there, you know it and I know it, but we didn't find it out under a gooseberry bush on a Friday night; we researched it.<br>  <br>  Too cheap, too easy is the problem. My solution would be a welfare tax on all pets or a simple husbandry questionnaire set by a vet on all over the counter pets.|`|coNh8flQaa	Bettas can be stored in cups if the pet store remembers to give them two water changes per day.  The problem is most pet store workers don't know to do this.  As for a filtered and heated tank being too expensive, that is what the fish needs to live a full healthy life.  Its still cheaper than what you would pay for any other pet, and if you can't afford it, you shouldn't be buying to Betta.|`|oTb67zNYaa	I disagree I believe that they can be kept in bowls it is just harder and requires more careful watching of levels yes A tank would be better however it is not possible for some people|`|86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	No aquatics store I go to keeps their Bettas in cups. They are either in the community tanks with carefully selected tankmates such as Corys, or they are in specially made betta tanks which are tiny, about 1 to 1/2 gallons  BUT are in the same centralised filtration system as the rest of the tanks, like mini Betta walls.<br>  <br>  I've also seen some pet stores use those small holders that stick in on the inside of the tank, fine temporarily but too small for a permanent home, but again still in maintained and filtered water.|`|a2cjwMKcaa	Many shops will just keep their betta in a normal tank with other small community fish, just one per tank. So that lets them house 10 or 20 that way. <br>  <br>  Another option is little baskets that hang on the side of a tank, like live bearer breeding traps. The fish in is a small space, but has the same water conditions as the rest of the tank, so it should stay healthy.<br>  <br>  Yes it's more work and expense for the shop, but isn't it better to pay a couple more dollars and actually get a healthy fish? <br>  <br>  Chances are they actually make up the extra costs becasue they have less fish die in the shop.<br>  <br>  Ian
CgEjK7NGaa	In my opinion, Parelli is nothing special or unique. He breaks things up into areas that are easier for some people to understand, and I do think that's a good thing. However, it's basically the same training guidelines that other trainers have been using for years (even those who are not considered "natural" horsemen). <br>  <br>  Doing your research on training methods is extremely important. People tend to go for the most famous trainers because they are well advertised and become "household" names. But remember, that doesn't always mean that they are a cut above the rest.<br>  <br>  You are doing your training research before you even have a horse.......You're going to be a fantastic horse owner ! :) :)|`|hmInq83qaa	"Smile" is completely right. Horse training is serious business. These animals can seriously harm you and respect for humans is paramount for the safety of everyone. <br>  Parelli students are often not very educated on horsemanship and often treat them as they would their dogs (trust them as they do their dogs), but horses are a completely different situation. <br>  Yes trust is veryvery important, but respect (read a little healthy fear) for humans is utmost important and Parelli doesn't emphasize that.|`|TTLIp8Beaa	i personally don't like the parelli's.<br>  if you've ever watched them ride, they flop all over the place.<br>  that would NEVER win at a show. <br>  personally, i think they're a gimmick.<br>  although some of their training methods seem half way decent i would never use them. although it may be an efficient way to communicate with your horse, if you can't use it in the show ring then it's of no use to me.|`|brVS3Pg0aa	My ex-instructer uses pat parelli and I think it is all right, but i prefer John Lyons, I agree with his methods more. But nonetheless they are both experienced horsemen, so i guess its a matter of opinion.|`|wmVmNEBOaa	I'm not a fan of Parelli. I have heard awful things about it, but just experienced what it can do to a horse recently. I board with a woman who has been using Parelli methods on her horse for the past couple of years. Just a few weeks ago I was in our barn's arena teaching my horse what side reins feel like when the fellow boarder came in with her mare. At this point I was lunging my filly when I noticed out of the corner of my eye that her horse was rearing at her. I looked over and she was moving the "carrot stick" (which is basically a short, orange lunge whip) frantically around the mare's head. I think this is one of the Seven Games Pat suggests playing with your horse. Well the mare was rearing and striking at her when finally she pulled loose and came barrelling toward my mare. I swung my lunge rope around towrds the mare and she went the other direction. Moral of the story is, if your training methods are making your horse rear and strike out at you, and she is trying to get away from you, it's probably not good.|`|OXA9s57Uaa	Personally, i use it as fundamentals for starting horse. The way i see it though is that it's an expensive form of common sense. And anyone that is in any way aware of how to train horses would more than likely agree with me. I do wish i could point at a trailer and just load them all up though. Wouldnt it make life so much easier?|`|ij3fQSmlaa	My mum is SUPER into it. I'm not so keen, I think its a bit of a circus act to be honest.<br>  <br>  Plus his stuff costs a fortune.<br>  <br>  Edit: We just had one of ours broken Parelli style. I'm kind of terrified to ride him. As I have said to my Mum, they are horses not dogs, not people...|`|mpgGfrBFaa	Oh brother.<br>  Parelli will not turn a horse into a maniac that will try to kill you. sheesh.  <br>  I'm not that into it though.|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	Oh me oh my.<br>  parelli...<br>  i dont like his methods... I tried it out on one of my horses (i know, just one..) and it was a sweetie for the first.. month?  we had a parelli expert helping us out with this , so we weren't doing it wrong....<br>  but after the first month of training, she started bucking, dragging our trainer, just being an a-hole. I didn't just give her up right there, but we kept her going, but then we had to sell her- she almost killed me, and the new owner/owner we bought her from (traded her for an older mare who was a better starter horse) and without parelli, she is winning jumping, cross country, and eventing competitions.  I miss her, but I love my older mare, too.<br>  Did my story help?  hope so!|`|u1HahCoqaa	It's a total scam, IMO. Besides, have you seen the guy? Athlete he is not- and real horse professionals, they are athletes. <br>  <br>  I have heard of it not working in many cases, although by the time people figure that out, they have already bought all of his expensive "special" equipment/supplies, so what does the Parelli company care? And the people I know who still do it, and it has "worked" for them, well, they cannot ride at all, and their horse is usually a fright as well. So much for natural horsemanship.<br>  <br>  Don't bother

Mine is 25 sq feet with a loft, but it can be any size you choose. Here is a site for one (scroll down to the bottom).<br>  <br>  <a href="http://princessblackie.homestead.com/" rel="nofollow">http://princessblackie.homestead.com/</a>|`|oGVWdnHraa	Because they are such big rabbits when they are fully grown, I would say at least 2 square metres, maybe 2.5..... :)
0S27EvfFaa	I understand, the people that say those things are stupid, dogs love to be outside in any weather, they are decendant from wolves after all! You can try finding a spot in the shade to set up a kiddie pool. Lay down a wet towel for your dog to lie on. Or simply set up a fan in front of a pan of ice. Also when you spray her make sure to spray the paws and stomach, not just the top of the dog, when spraying it with water. A wet towel does more good on the bottom of your dog than when laid on the top of its coat. Also your dog may resort to finding his own way to avoid the heat. Dogs in nature dig their dens not out of frustration but to find food, hide, give birth--or keep cool! If it’s possible, locate a shady area where it’s okay for your dog to dig.<br>  Hope i helped! :]|`|hoDvh61waa	I have a little shih-tzu and we have her fur cut short to keep her cool...im sure it's the same for labs (not that their hair grows that long to begin with). also we have a little kiddie pool and when we take her outside we fill it. we'll play ball with her and when she gets hot and/or tired she plops right down in the pool. also lots of water and ice is good and if there's a decent amount of shade your dog will be fine. if there's not enough shade a dog house is good to block the sun.|`|IWbFqtQ3aa	I had a Lab that was primarily an outside dog. I bought him a kiddy swimming pool. He loved it.|`|Gjyd1W5Waa	give him lots of cold water and keep  him cool by the air condioner and lots of shade|`|kpXRhoTvaa	If you want your dog to look cool just give him a smoke and some sunglasses, maybe throw in a leather jacket and some hair gel. Like all greaser style. your dog would be the coolest dog on the block|`|AA11776611	Does she have a dog house? She HAS to have some shelter to be able to get out of the sun. Freeze some bottles of water and put them in her dog house with her.|`|EB4Y7b9raa	Try freezing some bones, like beef bones from the meat dep. It's a good treat, good for the teeth, and like a giant ice cube.|`|X1tawExBaa	what your doing now is fine
w1lh1INHaa	11 years old is not old, and way too young for senility.  You don't start looking for feline dementia until a cat is at least 16-18.<br>  <br>  He just sounds like a normal, rotund, I'm-the-boss cat if you ask me.<br>  <br>  Arthritis, that I could accept.  You can get supplements to help with joint health, and it probably wouldn't hurt to have him lose a little weight.<br>  <br>  When was the last time he had a full blood work?  That is something that should be done yearly once a cat reaches 10 years old (in human years).  Any issues he might have can be caught early, giving a much better chance at a long, long, life.|`|U00iZcvVaa	They are like us when we are getting more age more grumpy we become to.  let it be the way he wants to be and enjoy all the time he have left. Do not worry about it too much.|`|Pkxcu8zOaa	Cats have a tendency to behave like little children.Don't worry about it.Just take good care of it and U will  see time will fix everything.
U00iZcvVaa	You must to take her to your animal doctor and have a complete check out could be kidneys problems or diabetes but only the veterinary can say the right thing.  Good luck to you.|`|rLDf1gGGaa	Some cats just prefer from drinking from a tap, rather then a bowl.<br>  <br>  Just individual cat personality. Sometimes drinking too much though can be related to health problems such as diabeties but other symptoms such as frequent urination.<br>  <a href="http://www.sniksnak.com/cathealth/diabetes.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sniksnak.com/cathealth/diabet...</a><br>  <br>  but with cats a dibetic cat with proper treatment and food may end up eventual not needing diabetic treatment.|`|IRaIxWJKaa	If she's also soaking the litter box, get her in to a vet and have her urine checked, she's possibly turning diabetic. If you wait too long you won't be able to control it via food, you'll be looking at giving insulin for the rest of her life.<br>  <br>  There could also be a kidney issue going on.  It really would be a good idea to get her a checkup and have the vet focus on the increased drinking, to try to get the problem stopped before it goes too far.|`|dmfdqKovaa	she might have a kidney problem i know animals drink alot when their kidney isnt working as well as it should be if your worried go to the vet and get a check up they will probaly do a blodd test to find out but if it is an indoor cat i recomend checking how much of the water she/he is letting out(peeing)|`|OCMSTxYfaa	no unusual...it is just the way it prefers to drink, and if you have done this for awhile, it is trained for it.
5a30eb5b89b12b5040c830a843bda7d6aa	I am a cat breeder and when people pose that question to me, I tell them to wait until the older cat goes to the rainbow bridge.  He is not going to like the new addition at all.  He may learn to tolerate him eventually but.......Frankly if you really like your 12 year old kitty leave his life style as it is.<br>  <br>  You said it yourself you're not sure that it is a good idea.  I agree.  Don't do it!|`|HjMbOgvqaa	If you are going to get another make sure that your cats and the new cat have up to date shots and that the new cat visits the vet before coming into your house.If you get one around 2 to 3 months it will be able to with stand a few scraps and leave the new cat in its cage for an hour so that the king of the house can sniff the cage and check out the intruder without feeling he has to defend him self .then open the cage and allow the new one to venture out on it,s own Have the cage close to it,s own litter box so that he does not use the exsisting box you can put the litter together in one box the next day.They will scrap but they will get to know each other and it will be fine maybe get a female.|`|ELkswWpCaa	They all eventually get along, or ignore each other. it may take time and patience but it'll happen. try slowly introducing them to each other. keep the little one in a room for a week, then take her out for visits with the adult making each visit (supervised of course) longer and longer until it no longer needs to be kept in a room. Also try bringing some of kitten's toys and adults toys/blankets etc.. into the kitten room (and vise verse) so they get used to each others smell.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	Kittens can stress older cats to the point of sickness.  I would get an older neutered male. Maybe ask the shelter to show you ones who have proven tolerant of other cats.  You need to go through slow,  proper introductions with the cats and hope for the best.  They may become friends or they may merely tolerate each other.  it's really a toss up.|`|t1cVVbGMaa	totaly just keep kitten protected for awhile because the other my not be happy. let get used to each other.at first the old cat may hiss spray scratch or growl|`|DaxHTmNTaa	I gave my boyfriend a kitten that was only a few months old. His other cat was roughly the same age as the cat you already had. Both the cat and the kitten were female, and from the start, the kitten wanted to play, but the cat was not interested. The kitten was too hyper for the cat, so they would constantly get into fights. After the kitten was old enough to get fixed and actually WAS fixed, she mellowed out, and now - while it is still hectic from time to time (for instance, when the cat gets fed up with the playing and bats at the kitten) - they generally get along just fine. Even so much as recently, they have even been curling up and sleeping together. <br>  <br>  We found in the beginning that if they were having a really bad day, if we separated them into different closed rooms for a few hours, they would be just fine. They just needed a little "away from each other" time. Also, in the beginning, you might need to watch them if their dishes are close together to make sure there was no food aggression. The kitten was food aggressive, so we had to teach her how not to be.|`|rLDf1gGGaa	Not a good idea to have a very old cat with a very young kitten.<br>  <br>  If you have an older cat in your home and are looking for a friend for him or her, another adult cat may be the best choice. Kittens can be too playful and may upset your cat instead of providing companionship. A kitten may cause your resident cat to be more annoyed than amused.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://fanciers.com/cat-faqs/getting-a-cat.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://fanciers.com/cat-faqs/getting-a-c...</a><br>  <br>  Also Two male cats can be extremely  territorial, its better to have the cats of opposite sex. Say 1 male and the other then female.|`|wxRPKEeYaa	At the first few days (maybe even a week,) you should really keep them in seperate rooms. Then, after that week, let them smell each other and see if they like each other. (And yes, my cat was very territorial.) It hissed and then fought with the other cat.(they then curled into a ball and rolled around the house,) But I'm sure your cat will eventually get along well with your new kitten. If they do fight, just keep them in seperate rooms again for another week untill they get along better. :)
3a8d8200494dea80c8e22d328cd4879aaa	"Does Maggie think she is a higher rank than the other dogs?"<br>  <br>  Yep. Submissive dogs are not allowed to hump dominant dogs.<br>  <br>  "How do I show her she isn't?"<br>  <br>  When she tries to mount, correct her either by sound or touch.<br>  <br>  "If anything I would rather the smaller dog be of higher rank, is this something I can decide or should I just allow Maggie to be higher?"<br>  <br>  No. Don't allow them to form a pecking order. You will have plenty of dominance issues. Keep them all at the same level, it's easier that way.<br>  <br>  "If I did allow her to be of higher status would this stop of the fights? I'm worried it would encourage her to do what she is doing."<br>  <br>  No, the fights would continue because you're giving her the power to dominate.<br>  <br>  Hi Jen. Good to see you again LOL.<br>  <br>  All packs will have a pecking order IF the pack leader allows it. If you let a pack of dogs decide who gets to be more dominant, don't be surprised when some get hurt or are covered with blood. If you have kids, do you allow them to determine who gets to be the boss? You try to treat them all evenly, yes? The same can be done for dogs.<br>  <br>  Besides, isn't it more of a pain to try to keep track of who can hump who? I hope you're keeping a list. =)|`|GaL66jbQaa	You need to be the boss of all of them when she humps isolate her in another room for a while keep doing it until she stops. Alphas don't let their pack bicker.|`|U1RcZjqJaa	I think the best thing to do is just let the dogs work it out. They have to establish rank among themselves. I don't think you will be able to choose which one of your dogs is dominant.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Maggie doesn't think she's higher ranking, she knows.  And you don't want to go about changing that.  It will confuse the dogs if you start trying to assign rank other than your own.  Your top dog, the dogs work out the rest between themselves.  <br>  <br>  The best you can do is control the behaviors.  When you catch her humping, tell her eh-eh, and make her stop.  If you catch the dogs playing rougher than you want, distract them from it with a clap of the hands or a "eh-eh" and start walking out of the room or away from the area.  The dogs will usually follow.  <br>  <br>  Contacting a behaviorist is a good idea.  It will help you start to understand what behaviors are appropriate and which are not.<br>  <br>  G. your wrong.  A pack will always have a pecking order.  The only thing you can change is how they display that.  Period.
qgeI6Chxaa	Just look for a local dairy farm. They'll probably be more than happy to sell you a bull calf. Bulls are worthless to dairy farmers, so they sell them extremely cheaply.|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	Contact a dairy farm in your area. The ones around here are anywhere from $50 to 100.00. Dairy farms have no use for a bull.|`|PPoCaJEEaa	Dairy farms are a good place to look. They're happy to sell young calves so I'm sure you could get them cheap too.<br>  Contact your local sale barn too, they might know of someone else who has some.<br>  Or you could talk to your local 4-H's beef club. You could talk to the dairy leader and they'd know where you could buy one.
4rwouQHOaa	You answered your own question, she is *English*, therefore needs someone with that charming British accent to work their magic. You have 2 options;<br>  i) Send her to England,<br>  ii) Book yourself a elocution & accent coaching lesson... <br>  <br>  It's the only way to train a English Labrabadger.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Biting has to do with age. They will grow out of it. If she bite you say "no" and give her a toy to bite. She may be doing the submissive pee, or there may be a bladder infection. Not coming when called:do you give lots of praise and a treat. I trained 2 Dachshunds to come on command. Dachshunds are willful dogs. A treat for coming works wonders (praise too). She is thinking of the crate as punishment. You are going to have redo crate training.|`|JtZfTiEEaa	Cindy,  I had the same problem with my first poodle.  She just would NOT listen.  I had her hearing checked, I had her eyes checked, I even got her a bone scan just in case.  Then, I did some more research.  Poodles are GERMAN dogs, and she didn't understand English.  So, I went and took an intensive German language class, and started from scratch.  It worked! <br>  <br>  I'm not sure where Labs are from, but maybe you're speaking the wrong language?|`|qioH81tiaa	Cindy, have you learned NOTHING from the feminist movement?  You expect her to be pretty AND smart?  Don't you know a girl only needs to be pretty to get by?  Geesh, some people!|`|KOtMicRKaa	Maybe she hasent associated her classes into home life maybe she only feels she has to do them in class. The biting could just be that she hasent matured yet but if she continues acting the same more training is necessary. With the crate she is probably scared of it. Work with her slowly and show her its a good thing not a bad thing.|`|okAYAGvXaa	Hello Cindy!!!<br>  Often a strong "NO" with a heavy german accent help to reform such dogs. I have experience only with wolf hybrids (despite my early age and low grades in primary school)<br>  but it helps as well to tell a girl dog she is very pretty. BTW, even cute female dogs do not appreciate flowers. <br>  Best of luck and god bless you!!!|`|kvHqnR5Haa	I think the problem is that your puppy is only 10 weeks old.  They need time to learn these things.  How could you possibly get her in that many classes when she is only 10 weeks old?|`|2724e8c32a9de71dca3f16697d9d6ebbaa	You need to consistently train her at home too.  Many kids do great school and then are horrible at home because there is not any consistency.  Same with puppies.|`|JREyMH4zaa	Badger? we don''t need no skinkin' badgers!<br>  <br>  at least you have good fashion sense and not sending your labrbadger out into the world improperly dressed....|`|yKdrOYEoaa	it tacks time|`|FQmZLqMdaa	She is still a tiny baby.<br>  They need to toilet every 2 or 3 hours morning, noon & night because they have tiny bladders/bowels.  As they grow up they need the toilet less.  <br>  <br>  She is probably teething so give her some nice hard chewy bones or rag bone toys.<br>  <br>  You need to spend more time playing with her & give her lots of love & attention.  Reward her for good behaviour.<br>  <br>  The crate thing is not unusual.  Might be a silly thing to say but is the top of the crate covered up?  If not try it because they think things are coming from out of sight, if they can see all around  them it is good.  Also give her something of yours to remind her of you.<br>  <br>  You must not give in to her cries when she is in the crate, YOU are the alpha not her.<br>  <br>  You have done nothing wrong but perhaps you have tried too much too soon with the training.<br>  <br>  You have obviously never had a puppy before.  It is all a matter of time & patience.  <br>  <br>  I have an 8 year old Whippet who is the perfect lady. I also have a 15 month old Whippet puppy who I adopted last October her manners are improving rapidly but it drives me crazy.  We all sleep through the night now although if I forget to put her out at bedtime I often find a little parcel on the living room floor, but she is getting better day y day & I will not be swapping her for another model.|`|GLDZz7aWaa	No.<br>  <br>  You may be expecting too much too quickly. The first priorities should be getting her trained to pee/poop outside or on newspapers, and to train yourself a little, so that you can be stern with her if she needs it.<br>  <br>  By that, I mean, "If you put her into her crate and she screams, ignore her. She'll quit after a while."<br>  <br>  She may be biting because she's teething. It's a habit you'll want to discourage, but don't get too frustrated over it. Dogs tend to become better about it with age.<br>  <br>  As for not coming when you call her, sometimes puppies do that. Again, with patience and time, she'll become more mature and more responsive to your commands. Keep working with her and practicing "come," "sit," "heel," "stay" and whatever other tricks you want her to learn. You'll be amazed at how well trained she'll be after two or three months.|`|AdgKikjaaa	C'mon now Cindy... A labrabadger can only be trained in KENYA!!! Pssh, you knew that.|`|vORwcxhkaa	Okay well puppy classes teach her the basic stuff (sit and lie down like you said) but they don't teach her how not to bite and pee etc.<br>  <br>  That stuff you need to teach her yourself. It shouldn't be THAT difficult. Show the puppy that your the boss but in a gentle way. When she bites you say "NO" but don't yell it, just sound strong and big.<br>  <br>  For the peeing, you could use pee pads, or this urine spray stuff that you can spray on your lawn (or wherever you want her to pee) and she will smell it and go pee there. Once that's done you reward her and stuff.<br>  <br>  For the crate, all puppies do that at one time. Mine did too. They just need to get used to you not being there with them all the time. When she whines, DO NOT let her out. If you do, she will think its okay to whine.<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|n8jrLDblaa	Cindy Cindy Cindy.<br>  <br>  Have you enrolled her in her first Puppy Pageant yet? HMMMM????<br>  <br>  Then clearly her self esteem is in the shitter. Until you dress her up like an adult Labrabadger, douse her with make up and self tanner, and she WINS that goddam tiara, the behavior will continue.<br>  <br>  And do you tell her she's "pretty"? OR do you tell her she's "pwetty"? Baby talk and training go hand in hand, you silly goose.|`|nmercOm7aa	10 week old puppies pee, poop, bite, chew and act like puppies. You have obviously never had a puppy before. There is no way a 10 weeks old puppy would even be allowed to attend an obedience class, let alone the once you claim to have attended. <br>  <br>  You have to put effort into training a dog. You can't just take them to a class and hope they learn something.
uLslm1b6aa	i got a pit bull puppy too! anyway, put her nose in the pee or poop (not necessarily in).<br>  <br>  use a rolled up newspaper to lightly spank her on the nose. <br>  <br>  if she runs away like after the second time or so, then don't spank her, she'll know what she did was bad. oh and if you have a kennel, lock her in for a while, that way she'll really know not to use it indoors.<br>  <br>  my puppy older sister runs in her kennel everytime she pees inside the house because she know what she did was bad.<br>  <br>  (a puppy's intestines is only 4 feet long, so you should take her out regularly, and feed her twice a day. feed her smaller portions of food if you feed her more than twice a day.|`|LXMbUx2Jaa	buy some puppy pads and leave them in her spots she usually uses. and then make sure that you take her out every hour, even if she doesnt go...puppys have small blatters. so as she gets older you can go from every hour to every couple hours and she will by then know how to alert you when she needs to go out.|`|VBtAERBaaa	Well she is just a puppy so you cant expect her to ask every time she needs to go and surprised that shes already learned so young.  You also should be watching her for signs that she needs to go or take her out after meals and every so often.|`|91f956efb63a51bcca06586fcc2fe99aaa	put a few puppy pads  by the front door so in case the puppy does go potty in the house it hopefully will go on the pad and not the floor|`|WDnpaCe1aa	It probably was that she was not familiar with the house. To make her go on track again bring her to the place she peed and hit her on the nose(dont hit too hard!) while saying no in your "mad" voice. This should make her realize this is bad and she should not do that.|`|n8jrLDblaa	First off....punctuate.<br>  <br>  Secondly, she's 11 weeks. That means she needs to go out often and at regular intervals. You can't expect perfection from a pup that young that possesses barely any sphincter control.<br>  <br>  Devise a strict feeding/elimination schedule and stick to it. Take her out often.

e719520f54f13fc32dec12cdf5c36075aa	You might want to try volunteering at your local animal shelter (if they'll let you).  The best Animal Cruelty organization (in my humble opinion) is the ASPCA.  They address Animal Cruelty cases in a legal and punitive way (watch Animal Cops on Animal Planet for some examples of what I mean).  PETA, though they mean well, can be a little extreme in the way they address these situations sometimes.  If you have a local community center with a Nature Center, I would spend time there.  Just try starting and keeping an open dialogue on the subject.  Remember, the best method of prevention is education.  You might want to talk to your school about starting an after school club directed at preventing animal cruelty.  Get in contact with your local shelters, pet stores, police stations, dog wardens, anything to get as much information as you can about preventing animal cruelty.  Many times, even zoos will have staff bring animals to schools to teach them about animals in an effort to prevent animal cruelty and promote awareness.|`|uSwtMWb7aa	you can start by making an account on piczo, which is a free website, but no one would really see it unless you could advertise it. <br>  and, uhm, seriously everyone wants to stop animal cruelty. the best thing you could do at your age is donate to a foundation doing the exact thing you want to do|`|Yf1Ig8E9aa	i also hate animal cruelty :(<br>  if you have bebo or face book or any other look for groups or bands for animal cruelty some of them have links to pertitions and stuff like that.<br>  i am in the same situation as you and would love to start a campaign but iv only just turned 15.|`|zkxYnQJaaa	I'd back you up all the way, it breaks my heart seeing animal cruelty.

hIyjdXr9aa	Place a nylon (like a panty hose) over the intake for your filter.  This will prevent the fish from being sucked in.  If the filter is still pulling the fish in, try several layers of nylon.  Each layer of nylon will reduce the suction, and will protect your fish. <br>  A lot of people actually do this on purpose.  They happen to have a filter laying around the house that is rated for a tank larger than the one they have.  So they stick nylon over the intake valve, and it secure the nylon with a rubber band.  It turns out that this nylon works as a great Pre-Filter, and that putting nylon over your filter intake parts will increase the quality of filtration.  You catch all the bits of stuff on the nylon before it ever reaches the filter.  <br>  <br>  :)  Try nylon.  It should do wonders.  Or buy a cubical sponge, rinse it well, and then cut a slit in it and fit it over the filter intake end.|`|tShDXmgbaa	The filter system may not be the right size for the tank.

v6Ka4gwbaa	Hello,<br>  <br>   I've dealt with this situation many many times. You have to be extremely patient. Feral cats are very afraid until they can get used to their new surroundings.<br>  <br>   You have to gain their trust, and that is difficult but it can happen with time and patience. That's the biggest thing to why so many people give up on feral cats, is because they expect them to come around within a day or so. That just is not going to happen, especially for feral kitties. Kitties that have been taken care of, and lost their way from home, they will tend to come around as they are used to human contact and touch.<br>  <br>   Feral kitties can take up to weeks, months, and even in the worst cases, two years. I know, as I've had that happen.<br>  <br>   The best thing you can do is continue to feed him/her, and don't try and run after him/her or walk towards them. Here are a few steps that will help.<br>  <br>   1-If the kitty is around while you are feeding your other animals, let him observe that for a few minutes, and then get him a plate of food, but don't walk straight up towards him. Talk calmly and in a quiet voice to him, and slowly put the food down as close as you can for him, and walk away. And never look him in the eyes directly. That makes them feel threatened.<br>  <br>   2-Once the kitty knows you are feeding him, he will slowly start to gain some trust. He will know you are the provider of food and he will continue to come back. After a few times with doing the above, even weeks, he will start to come closer and closer, but even if he does, do not try and pet him. The key is, let him come to you on his terms. That gains trust.<br>  <br>   3- Once he becomes able to get closer to you, he will still be slightly afraid, but that's OK, he will get better. If and when he does get to the point to where you can sit close by him while he eats, when he is done eating, slowly put your hand down and let him sniff your fingers. Don't try and pet him, just let him observe you and smell. He will probably run or walk away after he does this, but that's OK. That's a good sign. After he passes this point after a while, he will eventually let you pet him, but you have to let him get comfortable with you first. If not, you will blow all of your efforts, and he will resort back to the beginning. That's what I meant when I said it's all about time and patience.  <br>  <br>   4- All the while you are feeding him to gain his trust, feed him the best smelly foods you can. Fish, sardines, chicken, tuna, etc. This will help him to continue to come back, and you will be able to slowly work with him. He will come back to the house that gives him the best foods. LOL....It's true!<br>  <br>   5-Once you are able to gain his trust, things will be much easier, but you can't force it. If you are planning on keeping him, do what I stated above over and over until you can his trust, it will work, and you will eventually be able to welcome him into your home.<br>  <br>   6- If you are not planning on keeping him, you will have to capture him with a safe cat trap. Get the ones that are safe and won't come slamming down. What you do is, you first wash the trap to get rid of any other animal smells. You cover it in some trees, bushes, or if that's no available, cover it will a blanket after you have set it out in the yard somewhere. Rub catnip all over the inside and outside of it. Put fish or sardines, or even wet food in the back of the trap after you have set it. Cover the outside of the trap with the blanket, but leave a small opening (big enough) open to where the cat can walk in, and then sit back and wait for him to take the bait.<br>  <br>   7- You may have to set the trap and do this a few times, as some cats are smart and don't always step on the floor piece that makes the door shut. You may want to practice setting the trap up, and dropping something in it to see how it closes, and if all is OK before you try it. I say this because it's best if you can get him on the first try. Some cats will get scared and avoid the trap for a few days, but they will come back as long as there is food. That's why smelly food for the back of the trap and a blanket to cover the trap is your key! The smellier the food the better! And if you set the blanket just right, when the door shuts it will fall over the trap and cover him completely so he won't be as scared.<br>  <br>   8- When you capture him, check to be sure he is OK in there by peeking slightly, but don't take the blanket off. Leave it on, and take him straight to your vet. Of course leave a tiny opening so he can breathe. This will help calm him down, as well as the catnip that you previously put in there. Catnip is a natural calming method for cats. You could also dump a few pieces sparingly around your yard to help him feel not so scared whether you are keeping him or not, this will help either way.<br>  <br>   Hope this helps. It does take a lot of time and patience, but the rewards in the end are so worth it. One thing you also have to remember about feral cats, is they have never experienced humans or their touch so they will be scared until they know all is safe and sound. Some take longer than others, so there is really no knowing of how this cat will react to things or take. Just show him you are safe.<br>  <br>   There also are sedatives to put in cats foods, but I don't like that idea as you don't know how it will affect them, so the way I mention above is much longer to do, but it is better as it is non harmful.|`|IPFCtyvQaa	get a gun... (jk) or...<br>  <br>  You can go to your local hardware store and buy a small animal (humane) trap. You can bait it with food to catch it. After that, it takes a lot of time and patience to tame it. You'd want to always speak in a low voice, and give it plenty of treats.|`|IRaIxWJKaa	I really hate it when people say get a gun or get a dog.<br>  <br>  Ferals and strays can learn to trust you if you stay consistent with them.  Offering food is the fastest way to get them to trust, but it'll take time. They've learned the hard way that people = danger or death.  It takes a lot to overcome that.<br>  <br>  Take food out for him, some special thing like half a can of cat food or some baked chicken or part of a hamburger. Give a food call, put the food down and back away.  Use the same call every time. They like consistency.  It goes a long way to getting them to make you the exception in their opinion of humans.
20ccea7fa7f3ddbfe3a11c22cf8097ddaa	A kitten does not understand that moving thing is not a squeaky toy.Any cat scratch or bite is a medical emergency. I have written many times about how my bird got scratched by a kitten I almost lost my bird by a tiniest fraction of an inch hitting an artery. The vet bill was $245 and it was 2 weeks of flushing the wound and giving meds. If you are putting the cage on a table I presume it will be a small bird like a keet . That will drive the cat nuts and you will have to watch the bird day and night, A determined kitten will keep jumping at the cage no matter where it is. I vote no to a bird right now. Get another kitten instead|`|pvosPN40aa	The bird can most likely take care of itself against your cat. I had a pet rat and a cat and never had any problems. At first my cat would come up to the cage and stick it's paw through the bars of the rat cage. The rat bit my cats paw and ever since then has never bothered or even come near my rat again.|`|NIYYN6tpaa	Your pets will know that they are both loved by you and won't mess with each other just like you see on TV where a cat is cuddling with a mouse|`|jHHVkKQvaa	PET BIRDS ARE ONE WORD<br>  <br>  CRUEL!<br>  <br>  IT IS MEANT 2 FLY U SILLY SAUSAGE<br>  <br>  <br>  I HOPE I WILL NEVER BUMP IN2 U AT A BIRD STORE<br>  THANKYOU AND GOOD NITE|`|bPcTYfcHaa	yes|`|pYF9KnNeaa	Although some people do successfully have both birds and cats, generally speaking, it's not a good idea.  They are prey and predator and to expect them to live in the same house with no problems is being unrealistic.  Whatever you do, ignore what "hollywood" said.  Even if you hang a cage from the ceiling or no matter what you do with the cage, that will not stop the kitten from making the attempt.  To expect him not to try for the bird is to ask him to go against every instinct nature has given him.  You may be able to keep the kitten away from the cage but, you will not ever be able to allow the bird outside the  cage and that is truly cruel for a bird.  They are flock animals and when they have no bird flock, we must be the replacement.  A pet birds needs to be able to spend time with it's owner.  Also, the cat will cause a lot of stress on the bird, even if it never gets close.  A bird under stress is a bird just waiting to get sick and need a vet.  I'd really advise against having both at the same time.|`|9696d265a6939e3f0b0d367627909159aa	It's very easy to let the kitten know that messing with your pet bird is not appropriate.  It's like letting the kitten know that climbing up the curtains is inappropriate.  <br>  You do need to be aware that there is a bacteria that is in kitten saliva and can be in kitten hair and dander.  This bacteria can be harmful to your new bird.<br>  I have two male cats and a lot of birds. To help keep stress low, my house is kind of divided into territories.  The basement is the older cat's home.  The kitten has the kitchen, the living room, the bathroom.  When I'm not home, he is locked out of the birdroom and bedroom (I have a waterbed).  When I am home, I can hear if he's being naughty...my birds are great big tattletails.  They let me know as soon as one lets himself out of the cage or if the kitten is doing something naughty.|`|WDGPrlEUaa	i would advise...dont get a bird when you have a kitten..<br>  but still if u r interested in having a bird then hang the cage up high somewhere in your house..<br>  the kitten wont jump so high!!<br>  <br>  answer this plz <a href="http://in.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AsN84wrjvENOjGrXpV7ShByRHQx.;_ylv=3?qid=20090220123612AA0DLbY">http://in.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|9haTWuHsaa	buy a birdcage that can hang from your ceiling.<br>  aside from looking nice, it would also prevent your cat from trying to get it or tipping it over.

I don;t like when animals are put down.|`|3YHZUuhyaa	I think it's great to rescue. you can sometimes even find purebred dogs that need to be rescued. <br>  <br>  you might get more answers in the dog section<br>  <br>  =D|`|9696d265a6939e3f0b0d367627909159aa	There are pros and cons from both points of view. <br>  If you are buying directly from the breeder, purebred puppies have many benefits.  You know how the puppy has been raised.  You know if his parents or grandparents have any problems.  (For an example, pug dogs can have genetic heart conditions that run in families).  <br>  However, a mixed dog can be cheaper.  But if he's not a very young puppy, and he's from a shelter, you have no idea on his background.  He's more likely to have behavior problems that could cause you to pull out all your hair.  Training is going to be harder. <br>  I love purebreds, but I also have a soft spot in my heart for an abandoned animal.|`|b5QWb0Fgaa	i would save an animals life that's more precious than having a "brand name " dog think of all the animals paris hilton could have helped|`|mQw7JfCAaa	i would rather rescue a dog that was a mixed breed.|`|Wtn8Tdkpaa	I would choose the rescue, mixed-breed dog.<br>  <br>  I would be saving a dog, and mixed-breeds live longer healthier lives (because of mixed genetics) than pure bred dogs
JGq9rKBOaa	What the heck kind of science project is that?<br>  <br>  If they live in the wild in your part of the country, I'd say the back yard is your best bet.<br>  <br>  If they don't, you might have to settle for some crickets instead. Most pet shops sell them for food. You can also get some pretty funky looking creepy crawlies at bait shops...<br>  <br>  Not sure if there's anywhere you could procure a stick bug.

You can do things to show that you are responsible, and in the process, you will mature and get ready for a pet.  you can also save money for a hamster and cage and food, etc.  Do research on how to take care of one and how much money it will cost a month and figure out who is paying for all that and who will be taking care of it.<br>  good luck|`|XI2iylR4aa	You might not be able to get one right away, but if you are serious about getting a hamster, you can start by getting a job around the neighborhood or doing some extra chores to earn some money.  If you can pay for it the hamster, (and supplies) and have extra saved for vet care, your mom might be more inclined to allow you to buy the hamster.<br>  <br>  Also, while you're earning all of your money do as much research as you can about taking care of hamsters.  Pets are a lot of work, and they can be expensive.  You might find that you don't really want a hamster at this point.|`|XzjNsij2aa	Yeah hampsters aren't a very good pet, they smell and bite, and if they get loose, are impossible to catch. Instead, I recommend Guinea pigs. They are a bit bigger, but are much more manageable. For responsibilities, you need to: feed it and give it fresh water daily, and clean its cage once or twice a week. A guinea pig costs around 20 dollars, and requires a cage, some litter (newspaper works fine), a little bowl for food, a water bottle, and a little wooden or plastic house for the cage. Altogether, it costs around $60 to get started, but after that, hard food is pretty cheap, 10 dollars will last a month or so, and will eat lettuce and carrots too. Cleaning the cage is easy, just take out your pig, throw out the litter, put in new litter, and put your pig back.You can show this to your mom|`|d8685cdfce57268f3ec5dca715629f2caa	By the way you type, I would have to say you are definitely not responsible enough...<br>  <br>  You can always show how responsible you are by starting small. Try an ant first, then a spider, then a roach, etc... Soon your mom will see how you have mastered the skills of having a pet without it being dead on the second day.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|ta3wiCvtaa	If according to her you're not responsible and you can't even actually pay for the animals and what it needs then you shouldn't have one anyway.|`|ZH4N6Xdtaa	learn to spell.

My vet charged $45 for a full trim and a reset on the fronts. Thats every 6-8 weeks. Vet bills are un-known because you never know when a horse needs a vet out. Depending on if the horse is boarded or not. Just split the board. If not, Hay is about $5-$6 a bale. They usually eat a bale or 3/4 of the bale a day, depending on how much you feed them. In the winter they usually eat a whole bale (need more hay in winter to keep warm). De-worming twice a year; $17 a tube. Grain is depending on how much you feed and what kind of grain. I would say about $250-$300 a month at your own barn, if it is half pay, then divide it by two. If you board then anywhere between $400-$800 also depending on how much board would cost.|`|46eedfcc0d431f5086b7b4cfa950eb57aa	I'm not sure about stable cost but you should always plan high. I have my own land but I geed hay year round, I plan on  $1500 per horse per year for feed, vet work and shoes of course .|`|iiNAJfGCaa	I would steer your sister away from anything that even resembles a half lease.

AXcCyoo8aa	"It's Me or the Dog: How to Have a Perfect Pet" by Victoria Stilwell. <br>  She uses positive methods that are very easy for anyone with any level of dog experience to execute. For example, you don't want your dog to jump on you? Turn around and face the opposite direction when the dog is jumping, fold your arms over your chest, and completely ignore the dog and be totally BORING. When a dog is jumping it usually wants attention so if you show the dog that jumping gets him exactly the opposite of what he wants, he'll stop.<br>  <br>  Easy, right? :)<br>  <br>  Plus, positive methods are much better for a dog's mental health and help to build a dogs self confidence.<br>  <br>  Another one I highly recommend: "Before and After You Get Your Puppy: The Positive Approach to Raising a Happy, Healthy, and Well-Behaved Dog" by Ian Dunbar. Not quite as accessible as the Victoria Stilwell book, but this guy is one of the top professionals in the dog training world and has a PhD in animal behavior. He is also the guy who is the father of the concept of puppy obedience class.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and good for you for actually wanting to train your Yorkie, rather than treat it like a fashion accessory :)|`|amJ7EcD1aa	Well, you don't need something just for Yorkshire terriers. Your dog will be part of the pack, and you're alpha, so you just need to look up Cesar Millan on the internet. Read his book, 'Cesar's Way'.

61KgH2z5aa	A friend of mine's a dog walker.  He does up to 6 or 7 dogs at a time with car, probably 3 or 4 without a car.  Goes to a place where he knows he can let them off leash, a let's them off one at a time.  <br>  I think he charges per walk, something like $6-10, depending on the person/how busy...<br>  <br>  It isn't hard to do if you can start out with a few dogs, in a 'pet heavy' area of the city, and use sign postings at grocery stores/park posts to gain new business.<br>  Good luck.
hHAdA9V9aa	Dogs are very clever; they know, just like us, whether a dog is younger or older than them.<br>  <br>  I have two adult dogs, a boy and a girl, and we recently got a boy pup. The adult female often mothers him, growls or pins him to the floor but never to hurt, just to show him where his place is. The adult male however allows him to take his toys and often they both play where the adult male will put his paw on the pup then pin him by the back of the neck, then he lets him u and they continue this sort of wrestling. There's no growling, the only time the pup growls is when he's playing with the female at tug of war and even then they're wagging their tails.<br>  <br>  We only occasionally intervene to calm them down because they can get carried away just like kids. What you've got to look for is if the older dog pins the younger one by the back of the neck for a long period of time (over 10 seconds) or if his hackles or tail stand upright. This means he's in an aggressive mode.|`|eK4p8BmGaa	it all depends you need to pay attention to their body language. just because they wag their tails doesnt mean that they are palying,. If the hair on the back standing up? that would be fighting, but your original dog will teach the puppy what he can or cant do|`|ogFPGxpXaa	they gotta get use to each other|`|G3Xf0i0Eaa	Bailey is definatly showing his dominance - which is a right of passage with dogs. But if it gets too dangerous, Zoe yelps or cuts are involved, you need to show your dominance over Bailey so he knows when enough is enough with Zoe. The Zoe biting Bailey playfully for the toy is just her being young, and Bailey understanding - if she stepped out of line, he'll tell her, but its nice she can be boistrous too - just shows she's not terrified of him!|`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	My dogs often sound like they are going to kill each other when they play.....and they bite each other, wrestle with each other, it's all fun and games. It sounds like your dogs are just goofing off. <br>  You can tell when they are fighting.....trust me.<br>  <br>  Are you sure your male is the dominant one? I have 5 dogs and the smallest, youngest female is the alpha.|`|enC9TvxUaa	-Sounds like the play is fine.  as long as there is no broken skin, they are just playing.  You may think one is dominant, but that may not end up being the case.  Our 73 lb bulldog plays with a little daschound- and he is the submissive one of the two.  The little guy chews on our dog, or so it appears, but never breaks the skin.  When they have had enough of one another for that play time, they will nip a little harder, or growl- that's says lay off for a while!|`|KxjUim7yaa	It sounds like a dominance battle rather than play. Play is if they are running together to chase a ball. She is more aggressive because she is smaller. He is trying to be dominant because he was there first and is bigger. Eventually they should work it out. Watch that they don't injure each other.|`|6Nj5VZQ8aa	Normally male and female never fight or would not go serious fights. The further the age difference is the better of course, and your new dog is only a puppy. They are more likely playing. The size is not the issue here either.

OFpl236faa	Westies have a lot of energy! They need to be exercised quite a bit. They aren't just going to sit on your lap. Depends on the individual dog if it'll get along with other dogs. Terriers in general are not best to live with a cat. Fits right into their pray drive. Terriers can also be difficult to train and take a lot of patience. I would ask your parents to help you research for a different breed.|`|GaL66jbQaa	This is just my opinion but I think westies smell funny and I think their coat is too wiry.

tY3hKEFkaa	Female ferrets MUST be spayed if they are not already and you don't breed her. And its just irresponsible with all the homeless ferrets out there to keep breeding her just so she doesn't die because you didnt get her spayed. If she is 6 months or older most vets will do that. It is smart to do. If you don't breed them they do stay in heat, and will die with out hormone therapy from a licensed ferret-savy vet. I would probably bet that over the years raising litter after litter and having to find them all responsible homes (not to mention allowing many ferrets in shelters to NOT find home) it will be a lot more expensive than a one time fee of having her spayed. Id get her spayed save yourself the trouble and possible heartache. ITs just irresponsible to allow any animal dog cat ferret rabbit to go unaltered and reproduce. If you didn't know this about ferrets you should have gotten a rescue already spayed. Very irresponsible|`|4Sc3FAwUaa	Unless you plan on regularly breeding your ferret you must get her fixed as soon as possible. When female ferrets go into heat the will stay in a constant heat until they are bred. That definitely will kill her. So your two choices are either to buy and unaltered male ferret and breed the two of them (of course you have to find a boy that's compatible, not just anyone), or have her fixed. I bred ferrets for a couple of years after owning them for quite awhile and let me tell you it's almost like having a full time job. I don't recommend it unless you have plenty of money, time, and space. So I suggest taking her to get fixed. I hope this is of some help to you.

ixFbNr4taa	OK - two problems.......<br>  <br>  House-breaking.  You need to start from scratch.  She may NOT be loose in the house going forward.  You have to treat her like a puppy.  She is to be crated when you can not actively watch her.  When you can watch her -- she is to be limited to a certain area (let's say the kitchen) - so you need to be able to block her ability to go into and out of the room.  Get a couple of baby gates from the discount store or Goodwill shop.  If you can not block a doorway -- then you need to leash her to your belt - REALLY!!!!<br>  <br>  I've attached a good set of schedules - you and your family need to pick the one that best suits your lifestyle and STICK TO IT absolutely.  24/7, Days, Evenings and WEEKENDS!!!  Write out a big schedule and post it on your refrigerator - everyone in your family takes a turn and then must actively walk her outside.  <br>  <br>  You can not just "let her out".  You need to teach a potty command.  Decide what words to use such as "Go Potty".  The family must use that phrase consistently.  She needs to be on leash during this entire training period.  Take her outside, give the Go Potty command.  Walk her for 10 minutes.  If she goes, PRAISE!!!.  If not, she goes back inside - either into her crate for the next 30 minutes or leashed to you so she cannot escape and pee somewhere in the house.  Then try again.  You must see her pee or poop before she is allowed to be loose in a room with you.  She still does not get to roam free but she can be off leash for 30 minutes in a restricted room if she is "empty".  So - the family has to escorrt her out each time and give the potty command (AM, PM, Rain or Shine)  I love clicker-training and would encourage you to learn how to do it and then incorporate it into the hosue-breaking routine.  <br>  <br>  She will be VERY UNHAPPY for the next few weeks because you are going to greatly restrict her ability to run freely around the house.  Sorry, but she will whine, cry, whimper -- BE TOUGH!!  BE STRONG!!  The family gave in too easily before and so now 2 years later your family has got to present a united front and stick to the program.  <br>  <br>  Housetraining for Dummies by Susan McCullough (Paperback)<br>  <br>  PROBLEM TWO -- Submissive Urination.  A submissive wetting dog is not deliberately misbehaving but is responding due to excitement, apprehension or even fear. The dog is reacting on an emotional level to something in the immediate situation that produces extreme feelings of submission. It is a confidence problem. Submissive wetting can also occur when the dog becomes very excited, when first greeting his owners after a period of separation or when first welcoming guests into the household. <br>  <br>  HOW DO I KNOW THAT IT IS NOT JUST A HOUSE TRAINING PROBLEM? <br>  The key here is that submissive urination occurs when you or someone else or another dog is interacting with your dog, (such as petting, scolding, picking up, etc.). If it were a house training problem the dog would be urinating whether you are interacting with him or not. Submissive urination is usually small amounts, little squirts or tiny puddles. House training is usually large amounts that may be done when you are not watching the dog. The exception to this may be an un-neutered male dog who is marking territory (lifting his leg in the house, depositing small amounts of urine to say this is mine and this and this; again it may be done when the dog is out of sight and not interacting with you). <br>  <br>  WHAT CAUSES THIS PROBLEM? <br>  Some dogs develop it when they were not socialized well as young puppies to all different types of experiences, people and other dogs. If not socialized enough, dogs become fearful and unsure. Some dogs develop it because they were severely or inappropriately punished. Some develop it when the owner unintentionally reinforces it (e.g. owner stops doing something to the dog or comforts/reassures it in response to urination). Puppies often will urinate when excited, but they can grow out of it with proper positive handling and training. <br>  <br>  HOW CAN I HELP MY DOG WITH THIS PROBLEM? <br>  <br>  TAKE YOUR DOG TO YOUR VETERINARY DOCTOR FOR A FULL MEDICAL CHECK UP. Some types of infections can cause a dog to lose his bladder easily and thus deposit small amounts of urine about the house. It is always very wise to have your veterinary doctor do a full medical check up to make sure something physically isn't causing the problem. <br>    <br>  DO NOT BECOME ANGRY OR PUNISH YOUR DOG FOR WETTING. This will only erode your dog’s confidence and increase the frequency of wetting. Submissive wetting is not a punishable offense. Remember that it is an involuntary response to a situation, person or another dog. He is not doing it to "get even" with you or to annoy you. Be calm and do not yell. Simply ignore your dog for two or three minutes if he piddles; stop all petting, eye contact and verbal contact. <br>    <br>  IDENTIFY ALL SITUATIONS THAT YOUR DOG WETS IN. Is it when you first come home or when a guest comes in|`|XPSIn3wxaa	I have two. The best way is to crate train. It is hard because you want to let them out but you have to do it for them and your own well being.<br>  <br>  It takes about three weeks.|`|UBgX3cf2aa	When I house broke my two daschunds, it wasn't that hard to do. The female though was a little more difficult to do but it did work. She also had an excitable bladder, but that is problem is gone now. What I did was take her outside every morning to go to the bathroom & at night to do the same. For the next two weeks she was done this way & when she came inside the house she was put in a kennel  with just enough room to be a little comfortable, lay down & turn around in. Dogs don't like to use the bathroom in the same area that they lay in. They can be let out to eat & drink, but by all means make sure that when they come out of the kennel at night & first thing in the mornings to take her directly outside. She should get used to this pretty quickly. Hope that it works for you. I've passed this on to a few people on how to house break a dog & it worked with them. Something like using a baby gate is ok, but you have to remember also that they can move around freely & that will give them the freedom to go to the bathroom easily.

K45ZTwryaa	I use a bonded petcare service to walk my dog and provide pet sitting services.  That means they do background checks on all their walkers/sitters to ensure that they are trustworthy and reliable.  I only mention this because the added comfort of knowing this means I am willing to pay a bit more for services rendered. (Also, I know they can cover a walking session with a subsititute dog walker if the regular dog walker is not available for whatever reason (e.g. illness).<br>  <br>  I live in New York City and pay my dog walker $15 per walk for a 15-20 minute walk for my dog but because I have her walked 5 days a week the agency gives me a discount and charges $60 per week for an afternoon walk each weekday.<br>  <br>  For pet sitting services, they charge $60 per day not including food for meals and treats which I have to supply (which is preferrable to me anyway so I can maintain control of my dog's diet and eating habits).  Depending on who is available, they can either stay at my place while I am away or host at their place.  I suggest you find out how much local kennels charge per day because as a pet sitter, you should charge at least that much because pet sitting is generally much prefered over boarding one's dog at a kennel for most compassionate dog owners if that option is available.<br>  <br>  I would say these rates for walking and sitting seems pretty standard as I also paid about the same amounts for the same services in New Jersey and Florida.|`|MGfBOuUNaa	5$ for walking, $5 for bathing (the owners should bring own shampoo, or charged $2 extra), and $10 pet sitting, are very reasonable prices.
KEYgd73saa	The Cichlids will do fine.  However, you should really reconsider the Iridescent Sharks-- they're only about a third of their adult size, at the moment.  Also, your "Pictus Cats" aren't true Pictus Cats (Pimelodus pictus), which top out at around 5", but are more likely Hexanematichthys seemanni ( <a href="http://www.planetcatfish.com/cotm/cotm.php?article_id=63" rel="nofollow">http://www.planetcatfish.com/cotm/cotm.p...</a> ), which actually need full saltwater as adults.

This same thing happened to my dog when he was a puppy. I had to feed him Eukanuba Low Residue. I could only buy it at the vet.

3BMBZtDxaa	It may sounds stupid but it's very true.<br>  <br>  You need to think dog. You're thinking human right now. So what if someone is walking in front of you? You don't see them as you leader! So dogs should think the same way, right? WRONG!<br>  <br>  Dogs believe that the leader goes first. When they walk as a pack, their leader is in front and then the rest of the pack follows. The leader decides when they stop, when they go, and where they go. That's why you shouldn't let them mark their territory or go unless YOU say. It's okay for them to walk beside you, as long as you do have your feet in front. Having them behind is more ideal. This way you're actually walking your dog and they aren't walking you! If you're in front, it means you're the leader.<br>  <br>  You also shouldn't let the dog go through doorways before you, even inside the house. This is also a sign of disrespect and to them it says that they are the leader. You should always go through a doorway first. This says you are the leader.<br>  <br>  So while walking, make sure your dog is behind you or beside you, but not in front!|`|GSf09ALBaa	Okay, this is how I see it.  If you start the walk with the dog heeling (that is what it is called when a dog walks beside you) and end the walk in control (the dog heels) if you would like to give your dog some loose leash I can't see anything wrong.

Everything your friend said is true.  This goes as far as when leaving for walk you should exit house or gate first, then allow dog to follow. The only time the dog should have free roam access is when you allow it, such as stopping the walk to allow them to sniff or go potty. But it has to be because you stopped and allowed it not because dog stopped and wanted to.|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	She's right, you're wrong.

Check out the possible allergys an look up what to do for asthma in a dog before you go back to the vet, it may be something you can deal with on your own.

3ybVdfMEaa	Bettas often get stressed after a move to a new environment. She might not eat for a few days, since you just brought her home. It takes time for them to adjust. I wouldn't worry unless she goes over a week without eating.<br>   Just keep offering food every day, and if she shows no interest in a couple minutes, remove the food so it doesn't pollute the water. If she's still not eating the pellets or the flakes in a week, you can try tempting her with bloodworms or brine shrimp. But most bettas will eat pellets or flakes. <br>  Again, just give her some time.|`|HRHPmjtVaa	Bettas do do this. Your betta should start eating the pellets in a couple of days when it settles down.

nwMBfgcdaa	For reference, it is German SHEPHERDs (GSD people are touchy about the spelling) They are awesome dogs, however, like any dog, they are a huge responsibility.  Its hard to give you all the information on here as to what to do.  I suggest getting a book.  The Monks of New Sketes, How to Be Your Dogs Best Friend, has alot of information specifically about GSDs, but any dog book will do.  <br>  There is a great forum I go to that has a ton of information on any problem you may run into<br>  <a href="http://www.germanshepherds.com/forum/ubbthreads.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.germanshepherds.com/forum/ubb...</a><br>  <br>  Socialization is important for any dogs, but especially so for GSDs.  You do have to wait until your puppy has all their needles before bringing them around other dogs though.  They are very susceptable to diseases.  <br>  GSDs are very smart, so it may be a bit easier to train than others.  On the other hand, they require mental stimualtion along with physical.   They also tend to have alot of energy which requires more than just a short walk to burn off.  Extra energy combined with their high intelligence means they can be pretty destructive when not given an outlet for it.  You have to be ready to committ time every day. These aren't the type of dogs that do well sitting around the house all day everyday.  There are a ton of fun things you can do with a GSD, like agility, to excercise them both mentally and physically.  <br>  GSDs are also very social animals.  They like to be a part of the family and not tied out all the time.  <br>  Also, do your research before getting your GSD.  GSDs are overbred.  As a result, there are many genetic diseases (along with nerve issues) they are prone to.  Make sure you get her from a reputable breeder.  The parents should both be titled and have proper health checks.  Just being a purebred GSD with papers does not mean the dog should be bred.  <br>  Good luck.|`|syT3XUAraa	You are correct when you mentioned socializing. All dogs, especially large dogs, need to be introduced to many different sorts of people, other dogs, and places to properly socialize them. Here's a site explaining that in greater detail: <a href="http://www.paw-rescue.org/PAW/PETTIPS/DogTip_SocializationPup.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.paw-rescue.org/PAW/PETTIPS/Do...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.paw-rescue.org/PAW/PETTIPS/DogTip_SocializationAdultDog.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.paw-rescue.org/PAW/PETTIPS/Do...</a><br>  <br>  Puppies will start teething at about 4-5 months and usually stop at about 6-8 months. During this time, some furniture and personal possessions will get torn up, but with teething, patience is the key. Reprimanding a puppy for chewing will usually do more harm than good, but you should encourage your puppy gnaw on healthier things. Here's some more info on teething:<br>  <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/38930/puppy_teething_training_tips.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.dog-supplies-advisor.com/puppy-teething-toys.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dog-supplies-advisor.com/pupp...</a><br>  <br>  How successful potty training is varies from dog to dog, but you will first need to decide where you will want her to eliminate (pee/poo): puppy pads (which I use) or outside. The whole process is long and difficult, and there will be accidents, but never scold your puppy when she does it. Puppies' bladders are small, so you will need to keep your puppy near the place you want her to go on within 10-15 minutes after eating or drinking. She will begin to show signs before she does it (sniffing, whining, turning in a circle, and squatting). When she does this, place her in the spot you want her to eliminate on. If she uses it in the appropriate place, let her finish and then praise and treat her. Again, there will be accidents, so prepare for that. When she makes one, don't scold her, and show her the right potty. Eventually she will begin to associate getting praised with going in the right spot. This will take time, so be patient. Here's some more information on potty training:<br>  <a href="http://life.familyeducation.com/dogs/pets/45660.html" rel="nofollow">http://life.familyeducation.com/dogs/pet...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?c=2+2085&aid=157" rel="nofollow">http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?...</a><br>  Some GSD (German Shepherd Dog) puppy info:<br>  <a href="http://dogs.about.com/od/beforeyougetadog/a/GSD_puppy.htm" rel="nofollow">http://dogs.about.com/od/beforeyougetado...</a><br>  Some nutrition and wellness info:<br>  <a href="http://www.thedogbowl.com/PPF/category_ID/64/dogbowl.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.thedogbowl.com/PPF/category_I...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.thedogbowl.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thedogbowl.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/</a>  (Look for a 4-6 star rating)<br>  <br>  German Shepherds are very smart and easily trained. They need plenty of exercise and stimulation, so take your dog on long walks if space is limited, and be sure to buy plenty of toys. I hope all of this helps, and good luck with your puppy and new best friend!  : )|`|SnAsZapMaa	I don't think you are ready to be thinking about a GSD, you should be thinking about paying attention to your English lessons at school, plus (I'm assuming that you are a Yank) accepting that Yahoo's spell-checker is correct & your spelling is wrong every time a red line appears under a word.<br>  <br>  And I wonder why you changed from wanting "boy dog" names to wanting a "girl pup"?<br>  <br>  Anyone who wants a pup from me has to show me a door leading straight into a yard fenced to not just keep their dog home but also to keep stray dogs & stray brats OUT.<br>  And they have to agree to book into a training class that starts as close as possible to 2 weeks after the booster shot given at 16 weeks.<br>  <br>  I PREFER them to build a roofed security run in that yard, at least 12 feet long between the gate and the raised sleeping box, so that when no-one can supervise the pup it is in there with water and a gnaw bone and has room to exercise itself and go toilet when it wants without having to lie in it. In there it can choose between sunshine & shade, and can experience the scents, sights & sounds of the environment.<br>  <br>  If you read more carefully than you write, <a href="http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/The_GSD_Source/">http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/The_G...</a> will give you most of the information you need. Start from its Links => Vaccination. Then Teeth. Then Neutering.<br>  <br>  You must certainly MUST allow your pup to experience all sorts of things from a safe distance (it's called socialisation & confidence building), but until 2 weeks after that 16 weeks booster shot your puppy should NOT be anywhere that dogs run free, NOT anywhere that dogs piddle/poo/vomit on.<br>  <br>  If you are adequate at paying attention and recognising your pup's little signal (usually head-down sniffing in a circle, usually 1 minute after waking and 3 minutes after eating) you can toilet train your pup in 1 day. But forget about a potty! And DON'T crate a pup overnight or even for more than a few minutes at a time. Those who DO crate pups for hours end up needing 8+ months to get a pet that stops messing in its crate - or they themselves have to wake up every 2 hours to take the pup outside, in case THEN is when it feels the need to go toilet. <br>  <br>  NEVER give a pup a reward (such as toy) after it misbehaves (such as biting/chewing). Ideally you pay attention so you can distract her BEFORE she bites (eg, bounce a ball or offer a knotted towel for a tug-o-war or pick her up for a cuddle), but once she latches on for a bite you hold her there so that she cannot get that thing out of her mouth. And hold her there. And hold her there, until long after she is sick of the taste/feel of your leg/hand/shoe. No need to reprimand her for it, unless she is out of reach when she starts chewing.<br>  <br>  When you have to reprimand her, always follow it by commanding something she knows (obviously you need to reward-TRAIN her to something easy, like Sit or Come On during the first day) so that you can then praise her and reward her (rub her chest or croup or ear bases, or give a tidbit such as: a tiny taste of hard cheese or baked liver or crisped bacon or a peanut) for obeying, and thus leaving her happy about you.<br>  <br>  Unless you are getting a pup from a rescue group, NEVER give money to someone who doesn't supply a printed & signed Guarantee with each pup - and take a superb reader with you, to make sure that that Guarantee is worth having, not just a series of cop-outs to protect the unscrupulous breeder.<br>  <br>  To discuss GSDs and find out the things a breeder SHOULD have done before letting a stud & brood mate, join some of the 300+ YahooGroups dedicated to various aspects of living with a GSD.

You wanna introduce the puppy to different things while she is young so that these different things won't trigger aggression over time.She will be teathing at about six weeks of age until 1 year of age. You should have some chew toys even if she is younger than that.Potty Training takes lots of patience.Pick her up in the middle of peeing/pooping on the floor(do not worry she'll stop going when you pick her up)Run her outside and praise her for going outside.This may take a while.But it worked with my Lab. I hope I was of your help! Congrats on the new puppy! I'll be happy to answer any other questions.|`|8YrqeCPQaa	Great choice in breed. German shepherds are awesome! <br>  <br>  When she is a pup, you MUST socialize her with people and other dogs every day! German Shepherds especially need this training! When she is little, take a trip to the pet store, or dog park, or soccer practice or whatever every day! If you don't take her somwhere every day then she will not be properly socialized and you could have a big problem with her biting people, dogs, kids, you name it because she is afraid. <br>  <br>  As for teething, you should get her a cage to keep her in when you are not watching her because she could chew everything up and eat something she is not supposed to. In the cage keep lots of teething toys and bones (I reccommend a nylabone, and a puppy teething kong, along with whatever else you get her) this is to keep her occupied in there. also keep at least one toy in every room she is allowed to go in, make sure it is a toy she is interested in! <br>  <br>  It is extremely easy to potty train a German Shepherd. Like I said earlier, get her a crate. Keep her in the crate when you cannot keep both eyes on her at all times. take her out regularly to teach her that she has to do her business outside (also take some treats out with you and as soon as she is done doing her thing give her the treat that way she will associate the treat with peeing outside). Make sure you take her out every 3 hours or so. <br>  <br>  Other tips. between 8 and 24 weeks of age is when they bond the best with their owner so keep her close to you and give her lots of love between this time period, and dont be too harsh on her when she does something wrong, she is only a puppy and doesnt know any better, thats why you must teach her.
ErSbeRlzaa	No its fine to add it whilst there in the tank it just takes time to dissolve in the water were as if it was in a bucket you could stir it. But asides from that your not supposed to just add the aqua safe your supposed to do a water change, and then treat the new tap water with the recommended dosage. Adding aqua safe won't clean the water it will only remove the heavy metal, chlorine etc from the water.<br>  Good luck|`|JGq9rKBOaa	Adding water treatment drops won't make the water any cleaner - those things just neutralize chlorine and other chemicals from tap water.<br>  <br>  The only thing that really makes water cleaner is a filter - it sounds like you either don't have adequate filtration or you're overstocked, since generally fish tanks shouldn't be getting noticeably "dirty."<br>  <br>  At this point, the best thing to do is a water change - maybe about 50% for now. Treat the water first and make sure it's the same temperature as the rest of the tank before adding the new water.<br>  <br>  How big is the tank? What sort of filtration do you use? What fish do you have? How often do you clean it? Those are a few things that might help other users give you clearer advice on how to keep the water in good condition.|`|kKSpHtDWaa	Well you always need your filter.<br>  Then you should always have a bottom feeder.

JGq9rKBOaa	Absolutely. I one raised a "baby" koi who was about 2 inches into a nice 14-incher. Started him off in a 29 gallon tank, now he needs a pond. <br>  <br>  Of course, if you don't upgrade the living quarters as necessary...no, he won't grow as big or live as long because he'll get sick and die....but if you take good care of him, you'll end up with one big fish.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	sure will|`|0e51HkpHaa	yes|`|kKSpHtDWaa	Oh yeah.

3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	That behavior has nothing to do with being house trained.  That is submissive urination.  In dog-language, he is simply trying to communicate to your wife that he veiws her as the leader...this pleases a dog higher up in the pack, not so pleasant for humans.<br>  <br>  The only solution here is to ignore it.  Do not punish, scold, coddle, praise, etc.  Just ignore.  Most dogs will "grow out" of this behavior...so just give it some time and he should realize it's not a necessary display and stop.|`|G3Xf0i0Eaa	Aww, he's just really happy she's giving him attention. He'll grow out of it, until then, follow what your vet said in this case too - it'll make him jump out of being excited, and if your squirt him everytime he does something wrong, it'll be easy to train him right from wrong.
NmSP12b2aa	If your parents won't let it sleep in a garage or other room, then I strongly suggest you don't get a bunny unless you live in fairly mild conditions. Very cold or hot heats can result in the bunny dying of the cold or heatstroke. <br>  <br>  If you really want the bunny but it can't sleep in side then a good idea is to get a big enclosed hutch/pen which has an indoor side and a cage side. Make sure it is safe from predators and then fill the indoor part of the hutch with appropriate bedding to keep it warm as it is very important to have a warm side and a cool side of the hutch. Then make sure the rabbit has access to plenty fresh water and food every day. <br>  <br>  If you live in a particularly cold area, then getting two bunnies would be beneficial for their warmth as they enjoy will cuddling together and sharing body warmth. Just make sure you get two of the same gender or they'll breed like...rabbits.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|3sB49YNnaa	Folks who insist that a rabbit cannot live outside don't have a lot of experience with rabbits!  Ours are in the garage but we know of many that live outside. Housed in a proper hutch with protection from the elements, an enclosed sleeping compartment and good security from dogs, cats and hawks/owls, a rabbit can live out doors quite safely in all but the most extreme climates.  You do need to be sure that it is protected from the wind and rain (and snow) in the winter and the sun in the summer.<br>  <br>  The one problem with out doors living for a pet rabbit is that out of sight is often out of mind so you need to make the extra effort to be sure that your bunny has lots of contact time with you.|`|4yFDVPhQaa	Ask if it can at least sleep in the garage. The outdoors is hell for rabbits. There is so many ways they can die out there. Any ways get a book about rabbits, show your parents how hard life is for them out there. Plus you need to be educated on how to take care of it. They are way harder then what any one would expect. Also pleas try and adopt one, go to your local shelter or rabbit haven. If they don't have any you shouldn't buy one form Petco, because many of those rabbits are very ill and miss treated. In order to show we don't support this behavior form companies we need to keep from buying form them. <br>  <br>  Best of Luck!|`|EmJ6x7ftaa	OK. It's not going to die if you leave it outside, as long as its in a good cage, if it rains just get something to cover it up that won't let rain in... Oh and be sure to put it in a cage that won't let anything else in.|`|uJGMmSEraa	Depends on where you live. And where it would sleep outside. If you have a covered hutch, and you can keep the elements away from it, it might be okay. But I would pretty much advise against it. It's much better that it be inside and payed attention to.|`|DvjbTNXvaa	Its a baby bunny, so try and persuade ur parents to let it stay in until it's older.If that'ss not possible,make sure u buy a cage that's covered mostly or a hutch that is comfy and warm. put lots of hay in the night and try to add anything that can keep it warm(usually nights are quite cold almost everywhere) please remember that there are predators who hunt at night and even if they cant reach the bunny, it can get frightened and stressed.secure the cage from all predators and from the climate<br>  <br>  The point is to keep ur bunny comfy and safe if its outside...thats all!!!!<br>  <br>  I hope this helps! :)
hHAdA9V9aa	The informal rules normally are that the owner of the female gets all the money due to the fact they paid for the vets bills.<br>  <br>  This is after the owner of the stud gets the pick of the litter. This includes all dogs hence first pick.|`|enC9TvxUaa	-Normally, yes.  but in this case, the breeding was by mistake, so no rules set out in the beginning.  Sounds like a sad way to end a friendship to me!  There is not a real answer as there was no agreement before the breeding.  <br>  <br>  Good luck- hope you all can figure it out for the good of you, your friends, AND the dog!|`|AA10412922	There are no rules that I am aware of for the uninformed breeding.|`|iXijnCxOaa	1. Usually a responsible breeder has a contract that says who gets what... whether its money or pick of the litter.<br>  <br>  2. If there is no contract the owner of the b*tch decides which pups go where.<br>  <br>  3. Biggest puppy means NOTHING.  I have never had the biggest pup end up being the largest adult... and frankly, most of the time the biggest pup didn't have the best structure or temperament.|`|PM23RDycaa	I'm a little offended. Normally doesn't the "male" owner get 1st pick? If there is a contract stating that they get pick of the litter instead of stud fee (the cost of one puppy)<br>  <br>  and most the time they pick the biggest pup? Not always. They pick the pup they think will best fit what they are looking for. Largest of the litter as a puppy doesn't mean largest when they are all grown.|`|oGVWdnHraa	That was so hard to read....but what I got from it is that you wanted one of the pups, and someone else took him? Well if he was microchipped in your name, then he is your dog, if not, then there really is no case....
LAXxaxAZaa	I love the second one. I'm not a fan of pink skin and white faces.|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	the buckskin-<br>  The pinto is much too expensive.  A nice horse there, but it would be hard to keep clean (not much of a trouble, but still) and again, too expensive.<br>  The buckskin seems gentle, but obviously get the vet check, and go to see it, make sure it's what they are saying it is.  I like the color on the buckskin- LOTS!<br>  EDIT<br>  oh right you said you already have seen her- if you liked what you saw, I say go for it.  If you weren't a big fan of it, I think you should keep looking, the price just isnt right.|`|C6Ozw9draa	Dandyyouroutstanding really would stick out in a ring, she would atract the judges eye, so that might be good, but I'm not such a fan of her coloring, <br>  Sheza brickhouse is both attractive and cheaper, I would go with her!|`|4U93EoUtaa	I heard gray horses are more prone to melanoma.

(Small world, huh?) And both the fillies are in MN. :) <br>  If you got the first one, you could also show in Pinto shows. I know there are quite a few Pinto shows around here. I like the sound of her better, she'll be tall. :) They say she'll be a good english horse, but that doesn't mean she'll be bad at western. I have a 17.1 hand Appendix gelding, bred for Racing, and we show in WSCA pleasure and he's phenominal in the Western ring. He's a tad better at English, but I don't have the apparel for it, so we work more on Western. <br>  <br>  I love the second filly's color, and her conformation better then the first. But it could just be the picture. She looks like she'll be shorter and much stockier then the other filly. I also like the buckskin filly's bloodlines better. <br>  <br>  It obviously comes down to what YOU think and which one you like more. It's a hard choice. Think about the small things - the first filly will be more work before a show with bathing, etc. Is the second filly going to be too small for your liking? etc. <br>  I'd have to meet them and see them in person, or at least videos, if I were to tell you which one I definately liked more.<br>  <br>  Good luck. :)
XurYYreBaa	1.  This may be true in some cases but we've never had a problem keeping guinea pigs & cats.  Our pig *loves* our youngest cat & they often relax side by side in the guinea pig's playpen.<br>  2. Do it yourself C & C cage.<br>  3. Ours doesn't chew on much besides his food & toys but that's probably just his own personality.  Of course, we're always careful about everything he has access to, just in case.<br>  4.  As long as the toys are non-toxic & the piggies can't choke on them or chew them into sharp shards it should be fine.  Ours has several toys from the pet shop, including sturdy parrot toys & we let him have a couple @ a time so he doesn't get bored.<br>  5. They'll knock over their food dish unless it's really heavy or attached to the cage.  Ours plays with his water bottle in warm weather too.<br>  6.  A friend of ours has some in a hutch on their patio (we're in Southern CA) but I think they'd be happier inside with their family.<br>  7.  It's difficult if not impossible to litter train them but ours will give a 2-second warning if he's on someone's lap.  If he suddenly gets wiggly & wants to back up, we know he's gonna "go," so we get out of his way.<br>  8.  Two is better b/c they're herd animals & desire companionship.  We only have 1 b/c he was over 2 yrs old when we adopted him & he'd been on his own in his previous home.  He does get *lots* of attention.<br>  9.  They're all good names but I especially like Delilah.|`|5iDp1uVMaa	1. yes they do, do not get a guinea pig if you have a cat.<br>  2. build your own cage, as guinea pigs need a 3' cage at least, they are cheap to make and piggies love them <a href="http://www.guineapigcages.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.guineapigcages.com</a><br>  3. it depends on the piggy, do not give your piggy cedar shavings, it causes resporatory infection.<br>  4. home made toys are fine<br>  5. they are not messy or stinky, they are the best pets<br>  6. no, dont keep them outside, you run the risk of other peoples cats getting them, or hawks. And piggies dont do very well with temperature changes, it will make them sick.<br>  7. they only pee in their corner<br>  8.they are social animals, they like to be in pairs, but the more you get the bigger the cage needs to be.<br>  9. i like hope.<br>  <br>  Ive boarded guinea pigs for 10 years, if you have any other questions just message me =)|`|ngZvHw5vaa	Aww, call your Guinea pig Delilah!|`|fhYKzuMJaa	1.) It depends on the cats personalty. If you do have a cat watch them while there together.<br>  2.)If you mean by company than Super pet or Petco Products.<br>  3.)They chew. It depends on what their chewing on.<br>  4.)Instead of toilet paper rolls what about paper towels roll their a bit bigger and longer. And it depends on what toy. I think a shoebox for a house is just a temporary house.<br>  5.)Mine they kick some bedding off the sides off the cage. So if they start to do that put some window screen around the outside of the cage.<br>  6.) I am not sure. Mine are in regular Guinea Pig cages inside my room.<br>  7.)They pee i their cages. I remember like they have to pee every 15 min or so.<br>  8.)Two guinea pigs. They won't get lonely and MAKE SURE THEIR BOTH THE SAME GENDER.

Any line is ok as long as they have a solid bottom and they fasten well so they can't get out and are large enough.<br>  3. they eat everything! i got mine a porcelain bowl, we had a plastic one until they ate it. just make  sure things that are not designed for them are left out or around the cage is gone.<br>  4. some good yeah just make sure when using a toilet paper rolls to cut it down the long side middle so they don't get stuck in them.<br>  5. not really but after a while their cage gets messy change it often.<br>  6.yes and no, i wouldn't because on unexpected cold days they could freeze. <br>  7. yes! sometimes but when you hold them put a towel under them just in case!<br>  8. two always they are always happier with more than one! just make sure to get the same gender in case of unexpected babies.<br>  9.peaches! :D

Wg1ZTdUYaa	Does only nurse their litters once or twice a day, and only for about 5 minutes, so it is possible she is feeding the litter and you haven't seen her. Litters which are being nursed have bellies at least as large as the rib cage, if not larger. These litters are warm and covered with hair, and the babies seem comfortable. When the litter is not being fed, the abdomens are smaller than the rib cage, the litters may seem the same temperature or cooler than your hand, and are very active when you touch the nest as they know they only have a couple of minutes to nurse. If truly the doe is not nursing, holding her on her back to let the babies find a teat is the most common practice. Milk letdown can be improved with shots of oxytocin which is a prescription drug. Bottle feeding baby rabbits carries a 90% mortality and is not recommended.|`|JGq9rKBOaa	If they're alive, she's feeding them. Rabbits that aren't being fed will go downhill very quickly. In the wild, mother rabbits might only visit the nest 2 times a day or so, so don't worry if you don't see her spending a lot of time there.|`|MvisyrRVaa	You must watch them constantly. If you don't want to take time out like that, find a new owner for it|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	Can you tell if they are alive? Most likely she is feeding them. If you need to check, put some vaseline on her nose to try and keep her from being able to smell if her babies smell like you, then pet her so that your hands smell like her. Then check the nest.
iVQULHqYaa	This is probably caused by his food. Change to grain free dog food and you will resolve the problem.<br>  I have learnt by my mistakes. My present dog had dreadful problems because of the food which I gave her, I experimented with dog food, I tried raw diets, cooked diets and over the years I tried various dog foods. She did not like the raw diets and the dog food that I gave her resulted in diarrhoea. As an experienced dog owner I introduced any changes gradually. Nevertheless my dog still had problems. She was eight years old before I resolved her problem. <br>  Eventually, because of my researches on the Internet I found that the experts have discovered that GRAIN in our dog’s diet causes many problems. I now know that grain creates acidity in the blood. This causes skin problems, digestive issues, allergies, sickness, diarrhoea, anal gland problems etc., <br>  <br>  if your dog has skin problems or any of the above problems PLEASE CHANGE THE DIET. Avoid Grain, rice, beef derivatives and dairy food <br>  <br>  I now give my dog a dried food which uses beet for fibre and fish. It’s called Fish4Dogs and I buy it on the Internet. Look on the Internet and investigate yourself. Gluten free dog food is not enough to help our dogs, it MUST BE GRAIN FREE.<br>  <br>  A rapid change of diet will upset your dog; any change of diet must be done gradually. Do please change to a grain free diet. I have had sixteen dogs throughout the years and they have had various problems. Perhaps if I had known about the dangers of GRAIN they would have had fewer problems. .|`|9kTejB0uaa	Good skin comes from the inside.  Look at the quality food you are using.

But I think she should be fine my moms dog ate a whole butterfingers bar and she's still alive. <br>  I hope she gets well soon.|`|c7f42dca10585b7c08b39d06131b82a9aa	your dog is very small so just time will tell if shell be alright. she already got sick so dont be surprised if theres more where that came from. my dog has eaten a whole bowl of m&ms before and she didnt even throw up, but then again shes 65 pounds. if theres any way you could call your vet, you should do so. but if you cant do that then just wait until it all gets out of her system.|`|yM7fnXMIaa	Honestly if it was only 3-4 pieces I think she will be OK. I know she is little but I think she would have had to consume more than that to become at risk. Just keep an eye on her. If she starts acting different in anyway then you would have no choice but to get her to a Vet!  Normally it is Semi-sweet chocolate that can kill them if they eat to much. So Im hoping it was milk chocolate she got hold of. Hope everything turns out OK.|`|SkvogzLMaa	yes it can be fatal, my friends dog died after finding a few chocolates that were left over from a easter egg hunt in the back yard. It was also a bigger dog, potentially any amount of chocolate can be fatal! There is no excuse for not taking your pet to the vet, don't be a cheap ***!|`|G4N7cSOYaa	Honestly, you need to take you dog to the vet because it can kill her, especially since she is so young. If you think she threw most of it up, then just call and ask what is best. But if I were in your shoes, I wouldn't want to risk my puppy dying.

OWi8rvn6aa	This is perfectly normal and there's nothing to worry about. <br>  <br>  Over a period of time when goldfish's are exposed to alot of lighting what happens is the lighting will cause the natural colours of the fish to fade usually green or white. <br>  <br>  This is basically caused by too much lighting<br>  <br>  It usually wouldnt go back to orange but feeding the a mixture of foods will help increase the chances as they contain more nutrients <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|snJUxopcaa	Don't worry!<br>  <br>  I'm not going to lie and pull out a scientific explanation from nowhere, but I do know that some healthy, nurtured goldfish turn white.

Leukemia cats sometimes have lesions inside their mouths, like ulcers, that attract bacteria and make their saliva stinky. Then they groom themselves and the whole coat smells like it.|`|rLDf1gGGaa	Clumping litter tends to make things smell stronger. Try a litter such as Silcon crystals.

sbB0TpGXaa	No.  You can not.  At least not if you want the floor to last.<br>  <br>  Some composites like OSB will last perhaps a year or so, but those like particle board will not last at all and the horse will put their feet through it after it gets wet a few times.<br>  <br>  The best to use is yellow pine.  Followed by hardwoods such as oak.  If you can pull the cash for those white pine will work but make sure it is fair quality and no large knots or other weak spots in critical areas.<br>  <br>  Another option is plywood.  especially if it is on top of another wood.  However you can use two layers of 5/8 or 3/4 (preferable) inches.<br>  <br>  You could I guess use the new plastic composite wood that never rots and is very strong but the added weight and expense would make it a poor choice.  It is three times more expensive than oak and at least twice as heavy.  I am uncertain how it would hold up under the constant flexing that would be applied by the horse's weight.  I am assuming that is not the composite you were talking about.|`|bI7wMCJXaa	No. Spend the money and get wood that you know is going to hold up under 1000 lbs of weight. In the long run you'll save money and you won't risk your horse's feet going through the floor. That's a nasty injury when they can't get out of the hole and get dragged down the road.|`|QpElKY8Kaa	Minimum for safety, 2"x6"s  Two inches thick, 6 inches wide. Pressure treated.  <br>  You can't have much thought for your horse' safety if you're willing to consider this for a trailer floor.  Do a thorough inspection of the frame and cross members before you install any floor.<br>  Do the horse a favor, sell it before you cripple it.|`|hmInq83qaa	I wouldn't. Even with stall mats on it, the urine will find a way to the wood material and the acidity of the urine will dissolve the binding agent in the composite wood. <br>  It's just not worth the savings. I saw a picture of a horse that had fallen through the floor and it's an image that will love with me forever.<br>  <br>  Use only hardwood along with a rubber mat on top for comfort. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|C4rVwbi7aa	may not be strong enough guna say no|`|AA12048299	...Frightening.

If it's for pottying in the house, the way to stop that is by just cleaning it up and pretending nothing happened.  When she potties outside, really praise her and pet her.  She'll eventually start associating going potty outside with fun, and inside is boring.<br>  <br>  Most of the time when a dog potties inside, it's because sometimes people like me don't take them out right when they need to go, so it's 99% of the time not the dog's fault.|`|y39iNwFjaa	buy a plant mister (water spray) and spray her - the spray will get where you can't.

GaL66jbQaa	Any person can take care of any dog as long as they have the means and commitment to do so.  Shepherds are freaky smart and need diligent training for the first couple of years.  They also grow very fast so you need to be on top of it from the very start .  They also need a high quality large breed puppy food so they don't develop preventable bone disorders.  Only buy from a reputable breeder.  Buying and Raising a German Shepherd properly is not cheap.<br>  <br>  here are a couple of links that you should check out before getting any dog.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_adoption_information/how_to_find_a_good_dog_breeder/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_adoption_in...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.siriuspup.com/beforebook.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.siriuspup.com/beforebook.html</a>|`|GSf09ALBaa	Do your research.  Learn everything you can about the breed.  Know what you are getting into. Know you have to obedience train.  Exercise etc.  The best way for you to fight the battle of "you don't have the experience" is to make yourself an expert on the breed.|`|c2c3a447ca6a35c94ffed12e17bf8913aa	I wouldn't get this dog as a first time owner due to needing good strong training.  SO  if you can afford to go to training classes or get a trainer to help you OR have a mentor that is experienced with training dogs - then OK..|`|6SeWCfUfaa	German Shepherds are not the easiest breed to train and handle.  They need very firm, fair and consistent training and proper socialization.  The ones that don't get that tend to have aggression issues.  They're smart dogs, they're trainable dogs but in the wrong hands they are dangerous dogs.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, there are breeds like labs and goldens, that are bred to be more people loving.  So while a lab that's not trained and not socialized will have problems, bad aggression problems are usually not one of them.  <br>  <br>  It's not black and white.  There can be german shepherds that are mellow and labs that are aggressive, but the trend would be what I've pointed out.<br>  <br>  For a first dog, I think it's a good idea to get a dog that will train easily, be on the naturally obedient side (as opposed to independent) and not be a breed that's prone to aggression issues.  <br>  <br>  And thus, the labs and golden retreivers are my first choices for poeple who have never owned a dog before.  What I like to say about them is they are forgiving dogs.  You can make mistakes and they'll usually come out ok anyway.|`|aYZXi6ffaa	Very intelligent dogs.  Wonderful at guarding and protecting the home.  This dog needs a consistent owner and TONS of exercise.  They thrive on doing jobs and are total people pleasing.

Please go and buy some bedding..<br>  <br>  <br>  ?Hamtser lover?|`|378b13982f38188afccdf2a26222cf1eaa	If you put a LOT of the shredded paper-hopefully it's white, then she should be ok, but it is not ideal. And whoever wrote it will last one day is right. Paper is not that absorbent and urine will soak right through.<br>  Carefresh is a good choice and I'd recommend it for your piggy. My guinea pigs are on carefresh too. There is also carefresh Ultra which is white in color and is more absorbent.<br>  If you want her to be extra comfy until you get carefresh, put extra grass hay in her cage with the paper.<br>  You could add a soft towel as well, but please don't use one with loose ends or strings. Those have been known to trap or tangle a small animal's foot, nail, or limb. Keep it trimmed and dry and she should be fine until you buy bedding.|`|bEQn0Vrtaa	Ripped up paper is not good for them as they have a tendency to eat it and will at times eat enough to of set the amount of food they need. I do understand in a pinch we at times have to make due for a day or to, but no longer than that OK. What you can do with paper and it greatly decreased the amount of bedding you use is to line the bottom of the cage with it when changing the bedding. It will absorb a lot of the urine thus saving the amount bedding used, so you can get buy just changing the potty spot every 3 days of so and the entire cage weekly or even up to 10 days as long as you keep up with changing he potty spot.Best of luck and enjoy your guinea pig.|`|S7XXjUdwaa	No.  Not soft enough go back to carefresh.|`|AwOi6U2Taa	no back to carefreash
6GehblM3aa	It's one of those things that you can't just teach a horse.

A dark fish stands out more in light colored gravel and vice versa (Black+light fish) I would get a few of those pretty smooth glass stones too I have a few blue ones in My tank and they look great.<br>  <br>  Plants-since you just have a small betta tank I don't know if plants are a correct choice but if you were to add a plant I would recommend a Java fern. But make sure there are no snails on them, I usually just get the plants that come in tubes.<br>  <br>   to save space if you have a simple fish bowl I would not get any plastic decorations. I also don't believe you'll need a filter just one of those cleaning tube/Siphon.But if your tank does need a filter (if its 5+ gallons) I would get a simple filter that hooks on to the side of your tank.<br>  <br>  as for other fish I would have to know how big your tank is how big your tank is.|`|37kGM11xaa	Decor: Maybe a fake treasure chest...I always keep my money in that and put it into my betta bowl...<br>  <br>  Gravel:I don't put gravel and what is gravel?<br>  <br>  Filter:I usually don't put filter because I have a very good plant that is beautiful and good for betta....<br>  <br>  Plants:I put a very good plant but don't know its name in english..I only know its name only malay...its called 'keladi air' because it is a type of a 'keladi' and only survive in water that is 'air'...It also give my betta oxygen and it works as a filter for my betta...It uses the betta's dirt and foods to make its fertilizer...and thats why my betta tank is always clean even i haven't change it for 3 months....<br>  <br>  Fishes:If you want to put fishy,you must NOT put colourful fishes because your betta will attack the colourful one...Maybe all bettas has a deep jealousy?<br>  <br>  My betta live for plenty of years!!!And it gets too big!!!Because it do my betta like what I say above...Good luck!|`|HUIo1fQaaa	I have gravel and a live plant with my betta.

o93EwErKaa	I only know one Beagle, my daughter's dog.  She is very intelligent, doesn't ever bark (not normal), loves children, loves to go for car rides and walks.  She was training her on pads because of the long hours she works, but started giving her treats if she came home and the dog hadn't gone on the pad.  I was amazed at how quickly she connected the dots and now will wait almost every day until my daughter gets home so she can have a treat when she goes outside.  They are very food motivated to learn tricks.  I told my daughter that dogs could not associate a reward unless it was immediate, but this smart little beagle proved me wrong.  When I kept her for a week, I needed to put her in a crate at night because my Yorkies did not want to share our bed with her and she went right in and slept through the night even though my daughter doesn't use a crate.  She also had never used a doggy door and I pushed her through it once and she knew right where it was located when she needed to go outside without being told and never had an accident in my house.|`|RA3p25Qoaa	They are the opposite to stupid they are really smart. This can be a problem because it can make them harder to train. They will try to get away with anything so you need to stick to your training methods. <br>  <br>  My parents keep two and they are the most loving dogs but can be quite a handful. They are escape artists, so be sure you have a good fence. My parents dogs break out at least once a year but they're brought back pretty quickly. <br>  <br>  They are a sent driven animal so expect them to follow any interesting scents. This also means they sometimes like to eat poop because they smell the food.  beagle puppies can be ikky sometimes.<br>  <br>  They are barkers, learn to love it.  They have a beautiful hunting dog bark but not everyone loves it. <br>  <br>  They need lots of attention lots of praise love. And they love to run around outside and be walked.|`|3BMBZtDxaa	NO! They are highly intellegent dogs who are usually easy to train, if you can keep their attention!<br>  <br>  I think people call them stupid because it's hard to get them to focus on you, which makes training difficult. But if you can get your Beagle to focus, they're extremely smart pups.<br>  <br>  I love it how Snoopy was a Beagle which made the Beagle an American icon!|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	No,they are NOT stupid.My Beagle,Otis,was one of the smartest dogs I ever had.He was housebroken in three days,he could do many tricks,he could find anything or anyone by tracking them and he could figure out how to push a chair over to the counter so he could jump up on it to reach food.These adorable little hounds are stubborn,but they are certainly not stupid!!|`|JiCKFTuIaa	Who is "everyone"?<br>  <br>  Sure could have fooled me.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUe5Xsn7heU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUe5Xsn7h...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TR65xU8tn-Q&NR=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TR65xU8tn...</a>|`|YLYAo2zmaa	No they are not stupid, they are highly intelligent dogs, I don't feel they are stubborn either. Nor do they bark incessantly like lots of people claim. I have a lot of beagles.|`|ZfKDp7IXaa	Yes they are n fact, very stupid. Now, beagles are an adorable dog breed, simply impossible to say no to. However, they love to dig, ALOT. So if you keep him inside, he'll shred your furniture, if not, he'll escape under the fence. That happened repeatedly with my cousin's beagle. They would just be driving to school and spot him in the middle of the road. So I wouldn't suggest a beagle. I think German shepherds are a good breed, extremely smart, energetic and protective of their family. If you want a genious for a dog though, try a bloodhound. My brother told me over lunch about their intelligence.|`|mpb07ADUaa	Untrue. Beagles aren't for everyone, and those who failed to thoroughly research the breed prior to getting one are the kind of people who would label the breed as being "stupid". Beagles are stubborn, headstrong and independent thinkers that have no desire to please you or anyone else, very-very much unlike a Border Collie or a Labrador Retriever, which may be linked to the reason why so many people believe these dogs are unintelligent; although, stubbornness and stupidity are two completely different things.<br>  <br>  Beagles are hunting dogs that require mental and physical stimulation, otherwise lack of stimulation will lead to boredom, destruction and obesity.  The problem with Beagles is that they have cute faces, which lures in impulsive buyers who are unaware of the true working dog beneath the adorable exterior - too many people mistake this breed as lap dogs, which they most certainly are not. Beagles need exercise, as they are very prone to obesity, but exercise is needed regardless. If bored, a Beagle may become very destructive, by digging up the garden or tearing up the sofa, whatever the dog has easy access to - or if given the freedom, a Beagle will follow its nose to the end of the earth.<br>  <br>  A Beagle can be a very intelligent dog, but this depends upon if the owner is willing to train and teach the dog or not. <br>  <br>  Here are some websites if you're interested:<br>  <a href="http://www.yourpurebredpuppy.com/reviews/beagles.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.yourpurebredpuppy.com/reviews...</a><br>  <a href="http://clubs.akc.org/NBC/NBC_FAQs.html" rel="nofollow">http://clubs.akc.org/NBC/NBC_FAQs.html</a><br>  <a href="http://www.canismajor.com/dog/beagle.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.canismajor.com/dog/beagle.htm...</a>|`|GaL66jbQaa	They are not stupid they are stubborn.

VwxX8kDRaa	Fair to me would be to include the extra dog walk at 3pm, but charge by the hour that you're there, awake - and charge something extra for staying there all night.  What you're doing is more like baby-sitting than house-sitting.  It's not like you're only there doing what needs done for an hour or two - you're on call & unable to leave.  Baby-sitting runs around $10 per hour.  $50 per day sounds generous.  If she were to hire a professional, I'm thinking it would be at least $100.<br>  <br>  It doesn't sound like you're in it for the money, though.  A conversation about how much they can actually afford to pay would be best.|`|8dCnoh1qaa	I have a similar job careing for peoples pets and homes while they are at vacation and i pay around $20 a night, and the owners dont seem to mind.

Healthy dogs should not have a strong odor. True, some hounds and specific breeds have more odor than others, but typically a loud, foul smell is an indicator of a health issue such as full anal glands, ear infections and dental problems.<br>  <br>  Now, just because a terrier might fit your desire for lower shed and lower odor, doesn't mean these dogs won't have negatives. Research any breed you are considering. Terriers are notorious diggers and barkers.|`|gwUMipsUaa	The smell mostly has to do with the care of the dog.  Overbathed and underbathed dogs stink.  Once a month is plenty to bathe a dog.  <br>  <br>  It could also have to do with the health of a dog.  Or if a dog has food allergies.<br>  <br>  All dogs shed.  Some more than others.  Of the ones that don't shed as much, you need to be very diligent in grooming, plucking fur out of the ear canals, etc.

If you feed your dog twice a day and take him outside right after he eats; then wait with him to see that he did his business outside you shouldn't have an issue.  Take the water away from him prior to his last time out at night so that he doesn't have a full bladder during the night.  A schedule will help both him and you figure out when he will need to go out.      I think the trick is to be smarter than your dog.  THINK.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	Ok- he is a puppy.  Stop rubbing his nose in it and hitting him.  He can't be expected to hold it more than 4 or 5 hours at a time.  You can'[t teach him to hold it- his bladder is only so big.  You need to get up in the middle of the night and take him out if he is pooping and peeing all over his crate.  Take him out on a leash and walk him for at least 30 minutes before bed.  I have a pup that is a year old and still needs a 2 AM potty break.  Have some patience.|`|q1Swxe3qaa	first off, smacking him and rubbing his nose in it isn't going to work. its just going to make your puppy scared of you. If he pees in the house and you see it, then quick say NO NO NO NO and pick him up and take him outside. If you don't see him going potty in the house, then that is your fault and he shouldn't be punished. Take him to the same spot every time you take him outside. That was he can smell where he has gone before. Make sure that if he goes outside and praise him. Pet him and say good boy good boy all excited. Give him a treat. If he is going in the cage, then it is too big. The right size kennel should be just big enough for him to turn around in. If it's too big then he will find a spot to go potty in it.|`|0muoNffmaa	Dogs, especially when they are babies, can't hold their pee/poo for a long time, so until you move him out of the cage i think you will have to wake up(when he barks/yelps)and take him out.|`|oNQeg4xWaa	pet smart has a class for this maybe you could enroll him or call and just ask the trainer what to do.you definately should not smack it or put his nose in his poop if you dont catch him at the time he is having the accident he doesn't know what he is in trouble for.|`|zWFJBlJZaa	Please go to:    http://www.dogstardaily.com-train-aft    it's a FREE download on how to raise a puppy by a very famous dog trainer Dr. Ian Dunbar|`|au2fea9jaa	start him off with the whole of the floor of his cage with newspaper. then in a few nights take a piece away, and slowly take all the pieces away in the next month or so and he should get used to it! lab puppy awww! their so sweet :)
