What I mean is like here in England you have 7 years in primary school and then you have to apply for the high school you want to go to and you all go your seperate ways, and loads of people from all different primary schools go to high school with you.   So like is it the same in America? Or is there like a junior high and then a high school that follows on straight from that with all the same people, if you get me?   Ah, I don't think that makes sense at all.   But yeah I'd appreciate some help if you understand at all what I'm talking about lol

How to raise a spoiled child                      Raising a spoiled child is very easy it gets easier if you were spoiled yourself. Any parents can raise a spoiled child, having a lot of money isn’t required to spoil a child. Even if you weren’t spoiled when you were a child it’s still doable to you. Here are the steps to raise a spoiled child.                  First of all saying no to the child is a no to you. A 7 years old child doesn’t like to be told no even if he or she was playing with knives you still shouldn’t say no to her or him , but instead say “ this isn’t what pretty/handsome girls/boys do “ . If the child wanted to be the boss in the house and give you orders then you should do them with a big smile on your face, also you should tell yourself that this what being a parent is all about. A Cell phone and an I-pod are a must and you shouldn’t get them a fake cell phone because they can tell, 7 years old child wants a cell phone that can take pictures and if you can’t buy it then just give them yours.      Second, the child doesn’t get blamed for anything. If one day you think the spoiled child is just being too much of a spoiled brat and should be sent to a religious strict school. Then you should stop that negative thinking and start thinking positive by giving yourself positive thoughts saying that you deserve this because you are the one who got that child in life in the first place. If the child broke a jar in the living room its not his fault, its your fault as a parent that you put it there according to Murphy’s law anything that can go wrong, it will. The child shouldn’t get the blame for this because at the end of the day he or she is just a child.       Third, the child should always be invited to other’s parties and birthdays. It is your responsibility as a parent to socialize your child with the kids in the block. You should be informed about all the parties that go on around your area and get your child inside those parties. However if you weren’t informed about a party in advanced then just crush in, and just before drive your child to the party ,at the car tell the child that this party is actually for him or her but the people lost the address so they put it here. And if somehow he found out that was not invited to any birthday parties it’s still not his fault that all kids are mean. After that all what you can do is to throw him or her a birthday with the excuse that its his or her older brother’s birthday but you forgot about it because you are too busy looking for a cell phone that takes pictures. And no matter what people say, Santa is    real.      In conclusion, if the child grows up and reaches 40 years old with social, financial, mantel, psychical problems. It’s still not his fault it is your. Remember?! You spoiled him/her!

20060913222135AAfGc9O	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Electrical Engineering Problem from Basic Circuit Theory class. Can you solve it?	Electrical Engineering Question?  I am taking a circuit theory class at UMD. Any EE in the house?    So suppose you have a voltage source Vs which has some internal resistance, Rv, running DC power connected in series with a single resistor, R1.    The questions my professor is asking are the following:  1) what should the load resistance be in order for the power to be maximized? and 2) what is that maximum value of that power?    The professor says we can use numbers for "partial credit". I'm thinking this question involves some type of trick. I mean, I suspect the power on the resistor is going to be P = (V^2)/Req, where Req is the sum of the resistances of the internal resistance of the voltage source, Rv, and the resistance of the resistor, R1.

O Brasil  o pas que tem tido maior sucesso nocombate  AIDS e outras doen?as sexualmente transmissveis, e vem sendo exemplo mundial.2. O Brasil  o nico pas do hemisfrio sul que estparticipando do Projeto Genoma.3. Numa pesquisa envolvendo 50 cidades de diversos pases, a cidade do Rio de Janeiro foi considerada a mais solidria.4. Nas elei??es de 2000, o sistema do TribunalRegional Eleitoral (TRE) estava informatizado em todas as regi?es do Brasil, com resultados em menos de 24 horas depois do incio das apura??es. O modelo chamou a aten??ode uma das maiores potncias mundiais: os Estados Unidos, onde a apura??o dos votos teve que ser refeita vrias vezes, atrasando o resultado e colocando em xeque a credibilidade do processo. 5. Mesmo sendo um pas em desenvolvimento, os internautas brasileiros representam uma fatia de 40% do mercado na Amrica Latina.6. No Brasil, h 14 fbricas de veculos instaladas eoutras 4 se instalando, enquanto alguns pases vizinhos n?opossuem nenhuma.7. Das crian?as e adolescentes entre 7 a 14 anos, 97,3% est?o estudando.8. O mercado de telefones celulares do Brasil  o segundo do mundo, com 650mil novas habilita??es a cada ms.9. Na telefonia fixa, o pas ocupa a quinta posi??o emnmero de linhas instaladas.10. Das empresas brasileiras, 6.890 possuem certificado de qualidade ISO 9000, maior nmero entre os pases em desenvolvimento. No Mxico, s?o apenas 300 empresas e 265 na Argentina.11. O Brasil  o segundo maior mercado de jatos ehelicpteros executivos.12. Por que nao se orgulhar em dizer que o mercadoeditorial de livros  maior do que o da Itlia, com mais de 50 mil ttulos novos a cada ano?13. Que o Brasil tem o mais moderno sistema bancriodo planeta?14. Que as agncias de publicidade ganham os melhorese maiores prmiosmundiais?15. Por que n?o se fala que o Brasil  o pas maisempreendedor do mundo e que mais de 70% dos brasileiros, pobres e ricos, dedicam considervel partede seu tempo em trabalhos voluntrios?16. Por que n?o dizer que o Brasil  hoje a terceiramaior democracia do mundo?17. Que apesar de todas as mazelas, o Congresso estpunindo seus prprios membros, o que raramente ocorre em outros pases ditos civilizados?18. Por que n?o lembrar que o povo brasileiro  umpovo hospitaleiro, que se esfor?a para falar a lngua dos turistas, gesticulae n?o mede esfor?ospara atend-los bem?19. Por que n?o se orgulhar de ser um povo que fazpiada da prpria desgra?a e que enfrenta os desgostos sambando. ! O Brasil  um pasaben?oado de fato.20. Que os brasileiros s?o considerados os maioresamantes do mundo, enquanto que os ingleses e os rabes s?o os piores?21. Que os brasileiros tomam banho todos os dias, svezes mais de um pordia enquanto que os europeus tomam em mdia um porsemana? O pas do mundoonde a Gessy Lever mais vende sabonetes  o Brasil.Bendito este povo, que possui a magia de unir todas asra?as, de todos oscredos. Bendito este povo, que sabe entender todos os sotaques. Bendito este povo, que oferece todos os tipos declimas para contentar toda gente. Por que o brasileiro tem a mania de s ser nacionalista e patriota durante a Copa do Mundo?Se fosse assim todos os dias, vibrador como  durante a Copa, talvez hoje o Brasil seria uma super potncia...Bendita seja, querida ptria chamada Brasil!Divulgue esta mensagem para o mximo de pessoas quevoc puder. Com essa atitude, talvez n?o consigamos mudar o modo de pensar de cada brasileiro, mas ao ler estas palavras todos ir?o, pelo menos por alguns momentos,refletir e sentir orgulho de ser BRASILEIRO!!!

Je souhaiterais pouvoir bosser plus tard  (pas forcément en france) dans la police scientifique, dans u service informatique de préférence (lutte contre l'intelligence économique et les pédophiles, ca me botte ;) mais le mieux pour faire ca est d'avoir une formation en forensic science ( science de l'investigation ) qui est une formation pluridisciplinaire, assez axée sur la biochimie qd mm.

So this is a paragraph reasonse to a short story called ''The Sniper''       The Sniper      This short story by Liam O’Flaherty is called ‘’The Sniper’’. The genre of this story is drama, war. The story takes place in Dublin, Ireland during the Civil War around 1919 to the early twenties on a day in June. The main character of this story is The Sniper he is described as having ‘’a face of a student, thin and ascetic’’. In the beginning of the story he is described as a cold man who has seen ‘’death many of times.’ ’Later he is described as feeling remorseful for shooting the Republican Sniper. ‘’ He took a steady aim. His hand trembled with eagerness. Pressing his lips together, he took a deep breathe through his nostril’s and fired’’. He uttered a cry of joy’’. ‘’His enemy had been hit.’’ The other character of this story is the Republican sniper, his enemy. The Sniper then walks over to the body. ‘’He threw himself face downward beside the corpse’’. The Sniper turned over the body to see the face of his brother. This last quote describes him as feeling upset and obviously shaken to have killed his own brother. The theme the author is trying to tell people is war is a horrible thing it can turn good people into monsters and separate families.       PS i know i am not the best writer   don't make fun oh and i am in grade 9      i will choose best answer.

I'll admit, I completely forgot about it. So I was rushing to do it in homeroom because I have it 3rd period and I have no time in 1st and 2nd period. The bell rings, and my homeroom teacher walks in and looks at what I'm doing, then walks away. I had my test out, and my notes were next to it. Then comes 3rd hour and my teacher says my homeroom teacher said I was cheating on a test. I said it was my notes, and my teacher just gave me a look. My teacher said, "I need to ask him more questions before i say anything else. We'll talk about this tomorrow." What sucks is, they both don't like me. I have no idea why. So now I'm freaking out because I'm scared I'm going to get in trouble for something I didn't even do. Who's he going to listen to? A kid or another teacher? =/ I'm thinking of telling him, "Honestly, I wasn't cheating. They were my notes. My homeroom teacher must of thought wrong. I'll admit, I completely forgot about it, but I wasn't cheating." So, yeah.....I'm just freaking out right now! Do you think he'll think I'm lying? =/

Yes, doctors make a lot, and even though that salary is apparently decreasing, it's still nothing to sneeze at.       I asked myself, "Would I still want to go through all of that if they only made 1/4 as much as they really do?". To my surprise...I found myself thinking, "Yes."

20090205182129AAnBdXI	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	Is there anything really we can do to this teacher?	I'm in high school, and in my higher placement algebra 2 class our teacher does not teach us anything. We never get anything done in class and then it reflects on our tests and quizzes and while she's grading them she tells us out loud how bad we are and how "shameful" it is. It's not our fault that we can't do good becuase every here tries to learn it on their own but she just can't teach it to us. She has a lot of other classes and we're her only higher placement class so she dosen't have a lot of expirience on how to teach higher classes. She also treats us like preschoolers by reapeating everything and showing us prealgebra things when she should be sticking to our curriculum. But the worst part is how she calls us all dumb or stupid, or by telling the whole class out loud what we did wrong indivudually on our quizzes or tests. In my friend's class, she is in normal algebra, she told out loud to the class everybody their grades (most of them were F's) and called them all stupid too. There's one other teacher of this course and when this teacher was sick she came in to teach and we really saw the difference. She was able to teach, check anwers, and give us time for hw all in one class peropd when this would have taken our other teacher 3 days to do.     Is there really anything we can do? Filing a compaint probably won't do much. And it's not like she broke a big rule but we're not getting ready for any higher level math and want to do better which we really can't do with this teacher.

There is such a thing as a nation being so right that it does not need to convince others by force that it is right."         These are the questions:         33.How did Wilson's statement reflect the position of the United States Government at the outbreak of World War I in Europe?       34. Political opponents of President Wilson used the above statement against him. What feelings existed in the United States at the time that would have worked to the advantage of Wilson's opponents?

So now, he bugs me about how I must be a computer genius, and some of my friends, though less, bring it up sometimes and bug my about it. How do I get them all to forget about it. It was so dumb, and I only know as much as the next guy about computers...

20090205185722AAAcHDu	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Can someone edit my essay because I think it lacks an introduction and clarity?	Diversity is about learning from others who are not the same, about dignity and respect for all, and about being open to learning about our differences. I know that for myself that I treat everyone that I serve with dignity and respect, regardless of our differences. For example, I am biracial: my mother is Mexican and my father is Black. I was raised in a community where most of the population was Latino.I grew up in the Latino community for over twenty five years so eventually I learned how to speak Spanish fluently. This community is part of my heritage  that is important to me as a Black woman. Because I want to do research in the area of Latino community, I want to be able to help improve the lives of the Latinos. My cultural background has provided me with the capacity to work effectively with individuals from diverse backgrounds.   When I moved to California, my viewpoints were broadened by other cultures and I was more open to learning from people of other cultures.I started working at a residential treatment facility as a counselor and one of my friends I met while working there was from the Philippines. To me, learning about her culture was interesting because I even though our language spoken was different most of the words in the Philipine language sounded the same in Spanish. I embraced this moment that I got to appreciate and respect our differences. Diversity can make working with people from diverse backgrounds a dynamic environment to be a part of. I learned during working with individuals of different backgrounds that we all just have different ways of looking at things, views, and different ways of solving problems. On the one hand, we need to be open to learning from people of different cultures to understand that diversity can enrich our lives. So, I could never imagine working in a place where everyone did and liked the same things. I believe that diversity opens the doors to learning.    I am culturally competent in my language ability to relate to individuals who speak Spanish. Because I can meet their needs and assist them in however they need help whether it is with helping them overcome ther problems or emotionally. Thus, it is important to have some knowledge and awareness of individuals culture and background to have some positive affect on helping them cope better with their problems.
