It kind of looks like I'm having a seizure. The thing is only sometimes I can control it, like if I think about something else or I just roll my wrist around. I usually get it when something unexpected happens. For example if it's my stop at the train station and I didn't know, or when my cellphone rings and I'm in another room. Now all the time I have to think before I get up from my seat to even walk across the room and throw out something! It's very embarrassing and when I do it in front of friends, I always have to make up some lie to cover it. When and how can this stop?

20090205192435AAp23rK	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Do you know anything about hearing loss/deafness caused by Meniere's Disease?	Over the last two years or so, I've been very gradually losing my hearing. As it stands now, I will probably be completely deaf within the next six months. I have been going to doctors, of course, and have ruled out brain tumor just recently. I am going back in a couple weeks, but in the meantime, I've been doing some of my own research and my symptoms sound, to me, like Mienere's. (Vertigo, oscillating hearing loss, over-all balancing issues). My question is, if you have been diagnosed with Meneire's (or know something about it), does it seem likely that this is what I have, and is there anything that can be done to at least save what little hearing I have left? I've had all kinds of blood-tests and such and I really can't imagine what else it would be. I'm a little scared and lonely, having never been around many hearing-impaired people. I have a five month old daughter and I worry about being able to take care of her. Do you have any insight or suggestions?

A few weeks ago my nose started gushing blood, and it took about 15 minutes to get it to stop. After that I had a sinus infection for about a week. My nose has been killing me, anytime I blow my nose, blood comes out and I can't even touch my nose without cringing.  My boyfriend is going through the same thing.    We live in North Carolina... could the air be the issue?  We don't pick our noses (ew), or do drugs, and we're not vegetarians.  I just moved to NC from Ohio.

20090205192938AAtqHnj	Health;Dental	Wisdom Teeth Dilemma?	for several months now, i have neglected my dentist's advice for me to go and have my wisdom teeth removed. Well, 5 months later, i've found myself in a terrible situation...the aforementioned wisdom teeth has now pushed one side of my bottom jaw to arch out toward the front (sort of like pushing it out so that they're party crooked). Then , on the other side of my bottom jaw, i have this excruciating pain from my gun. After inspection, i noticed the tell-tale sign of a tooth - something white and small on my gum. It hasn't bled yet, but i have ridiculous pain 24.7.   Now here's my dilemma. I am a wuss when it comes to blood, but i have now persuaded myself that a surgery has to be the answer. However, the thing is, i'm right smack in the middle of the school season...Summer is 5 months away and my safest bet is spring break which is 2 months away. so now here's my question: can i afford to wait 2 months? or do i have to get the surgery right away, as to not cause any more collateral damage? if so, what will the recovery time be, for i'd hate to go to school looking like a chipmunk and feeling so dizzy so that i can't do anything constructive....so any advice as to what i should do would be heavenly, and some advice as to how to prepare for the surgery would also be great, because try as i might, i know i won't be able to stomach the thought of being put under the knife, anesthesia or no anesthesia       cheers

I've had laryngitis for 3 days now and I still don't know the cause of it. The only info that might help is lots of people at school being sick (although none of them lost their voice and all of them exhibited other cold type symptoms) and the phlegm that I cough up being cloudy and white. I can't tell if it's just the bubbles in the phlegm or dead cells or maybe bacteria? What do you think is causing this - some kind of bacterial infection or a rhinovirus?   Also, I don't have any other symptoms besides barely being able to talk and a sore throat. Other than that, I feel absolutely healthy - not even fatigue or headaches or anything. And I don't think it's due to vocal abuse, since I haven't been talking/screaming/singing more than usual lately.   Any advice would help, I'm kind of puzzled here...

I'm past 13 (not too comfortable posting my real age) and I've never had a crush, I don't think I've ever masturbated, I don't blush around boys (I'm a girl, btw), and I have no desire to attract attention from them either.   Everyone in my class, plus everyone else in the world I'm aware of, has gone through this ever since they were at least 11. But I'm past 13, and I've had none of these 'symptoms'. (improper usage, forgive me) Is something wrong? Here's more things that may help your answer:   1) I don't feel attraction to the same gender   2) I avoid my parents' cigarette smoke, but sometimes I can't escape it.   3) I'm a bit more serious than some other people sometimes.   4) I was attacked by a dog when I was 2 and suffered brain damage.      I think the only thing closest to the attraction I think I should feel is that I'm curious about sex (though I still haven't masturbated, I don't think, unless you call squealing when characters on a favorite book or show start getting lovey-dovey masturbating, which I'm sure you don't), and the strange longing to live a fairy-tale life, where me and the 'prince charming' are some sort of heroes o.O AND he uses guns. I have no idea why.      *headdesk* Please help.

I'm not sexually active, so I know it can't be that I'm pregnant. I've had a few of my usual PMS symptoms over the last few months (To a lesser degree than usual), but there hasn't been any bleeding whatsoever. This month, my PMS symptoms have returned full force (They began at the very end of last month), but now they're beginning to dwindle away like I've already had my period, only, again, there's been no bleeding. For the last few days I've had a heavy white discharge that I usually don't get until AFTER my period's gone, and today I just started to have a little bit of internal pain in my vaginal area when I sit down. I do plan to visit my doctor soon, but I'm really worried right now, and totally stressing. Does anyone have any idea on what could possibly be wrong with me? Any help will be greatly appreciated!

I don't know what to do if it swells up bigger tonight! I haven't been to the doctors in years, and I would probably have to change doctors since I am now an adult. If it gets worse, like swells up more, should I call 911? I think it will be nothing, but I am not sure. Help please!

20090205195236AAgPr0l	Health;Other - Health	Are relationships necessary in life?	Right now I'm a 21 year old college student. My major is International Economics/Business, and I'm not really that happy with it. Yeah, I am semi-interested in it, but it's not what I want I want to do with my life. The problem is, I don't really know what I do want to do. I just don't know that I'm not doing what I want to be doing. Honestly, I don't get enjoyment out of many activities. Part of me actually wants to drop out of college, but I only have a year left, so it's not an option. I just don't know what I want to do. I feel that even if I do get a great job...so what? I'm going to be a wage-slave my whole life and then die. We're all going to die, so what's the point. But it's sort of reassuring that we're all going to die, because it leaves us more freedom to do whatever the hell we want.   Another issue is that I've never been in a relationship, which doesn't bother me so much. I also have no desire for sex. So perhaps I'm asexual. I think society puts way too much emphasis on relationships. People think that if they don't have someone they are incomplete or a loser. Why can't people just be happy alone? Why can't people be happy with themselves? I think there's more to life than relationships and love. What's with society's obsession over love. Because when it comes down to it, if you're not happy with yourself, and don't love yourself, you're not gong to be happy in a relationship. Relationships are not a cure to make yourself happy.   Between school and relationships, I'm just at a very confused point in my life. Society's typical path of good career, marriage, white picket fence, kids is not for me..   On top of everything, I have an extremely overbearing mother who won't stop telling me what jobs to apply for and what to do with my life.

I'm a 27 year old female, who started having seizures about 4 years ago.   I've had 4 or 5 grand mal seizures, last one was in March of 08. And about 2 or 3 petite mal seizures a month (dizziness, tremors, loss of sight or tunnel vision, loss of memory...) they vary in strength everytime.   Full blown Epilepsy is VERY heavy on my mothers side, so the doctors just claim thats my problem. I've had EVERY neurological test done & the results are all normal.   BUT, EVERY grand mal seizure i've had, the E.M.T tell me I have EXTREMELY LOW potassium. Then I go to my doctor for blood work, and all my levels are fine.   I've tried just about EVERY seizure medication there is, from depakote to tegrotol, & am currently taking Lyrica, 200mg 3 times a day. And if I feel a seizure coming on, I am supposed to take a Klonopin, which is chewable. That calms ME down but does not always prevent the seizures.   I can drink SmartWater (which contains electrolytes & potassium) and it makes the "seizure sickness" go away (for the most part)   IF I miss a dose of the Lyrica, or am late on it, i have a seizure.   but i think this is a potassium problem.... Or is it really epilepsy?

20090205192843AADSuqZ	Health;Alternative Medicine	Could Ketamin be a solution?	I have headaches evey single day, for about 4 months. I have also been depressed for about 5 or 6 months. I was looking up on Google 'fast acting anti-depressants' I clicked on the second one down, and said how "Ketamin" can be used to treat depression fast (within 2 hours of taking it) AND helps with headaches. To me this seems to-good-to-be-true, But maybe it's not. It also mentioned that people 15 and under and peopleover 65 have Way fewer side effects. I am 14, which is under 15, so there is less of a risk for serious side effects. Should I ask my mom and/or doctor about this, or is there anyway, other than buying over the internet, to try it and see if helps my headaches and depression? Like over the counter? Or should I just forget the whole idea?

I have been thin my whole life and very recently I picked up a gym membership and I have legitimately starting going to the gym. I changed my diet (all whole grains, whey proteins, more calories and carbs, more veggies, only lean meats etc). I worked out my biceps on monday, and then my triceps on tuesday (along with other muscle groups, but these are the most prominent to my question) and my god! My arms have been sore sine, and today is thursday. It is painful to stretch my arm out, or even to get it straight! Most of the pain/soreness is right near the elbow, I feel it mostly at the end of my bicep. It's not my elbow though. I know I'm doing my workouts correctly, I've seen a personal trainer. My question comes down to this: is it normal to be this sore? How long should I expect this to play out? I have a workout plan made up, and in order to keep with it after today (which was my rest day) I need to start on my biceps again tomorrow. Should I wait another day for the soreness to clear up? Should I tough it out? Would motrin/IB Profen help?  Thanks for your help!

20090205200555AAh7n3w	Health;Diet & Fitness	Why am I not losing weight?	First off I am going to tell you that I'm not lying about anything I say I'm doing. I know i've read atricles that said most women lie about what they eat and how they work out, but if I was lying I wouldn't even bother asking this embarrassing q.      Okay so I'm 15 and no matter what I cant lose weight. I try to eat so lean. We haven't had cheese or juices in the house for years, all I drink is water and skim milk with cereal. The only cereal I allow myself is plain puffed wheat (leanest you can get), it takes us 4 months to go through oe stick of butter, I have drank maybe 3 pops in my entire life (it hurts in my throat), I've had one hamburger in my entire life when I was three, I havent had fries, breaded chicken, or anything like that in years. I have never bought from a vending machine. Cookies and chocolate bars dont even exist to me, I don't eat red meat, haven't had pasta in over a month and it just goes on. I eat mostly fruits and veggies         For working out, first thing in the morning I do 30 min. of jump rope and 10 -15 minutes strength training, then I walk to school for a half hour, back from school for a half hour, another 30 min. of jump rope with 30 min strength training and a late night walk or run. And I often go hiking on my free time. At weekends I hike for at least 3 hours on at least one day. I do that routine 7 days a week no matter how crappy I feel.         Its just not fair. I think I work at east as hard as all the skinny girls in my school. I see them eating friggin fries and that and I'm like "what the hell?" you work hard in school, you get good grades. You wark hard at your body, arent you supposed to see results??
20090205194911AAi73VB	Health;Dental	Weird Yellow Mass in My Sons New Molar?	My son who just turned 3 has a weird mass in his back left molar. I thought it was skin from his tooth not being all the way through the gum but on further inspection it looks like his tooth is all the way through and no amount of brushing will get the stuff out.  His molar is also very bowl shaped and it is like it is holding the yellow stuff in the bowl.  I hope that makes sense but it is the only way I know to describe it.  It kinda looks like he has eaten something and there is bread or something stuck in his tooth... but it isn't food.  It has been there for a while and like I said, it won't come out at all!  Does anyone have any idea what this might be? I  am making him a dental apt but it is worrying me.

I was so dumbfounded I couldn't think of any questions to ask the doctor. I had a severe fall from a horse I was breaking a few years back and I've been in a lot of car wrecks, but I'm only just about to turn 30 and I can't believe I already have arthritis. I had an MRI and so my doctor is certain about the diagnosis, and has made a treatment plan.    Does it ever heal up and go away? Am I still going to be able to continue with my horses? Yea I hope I don't get in anymore car wrecks haha but I'm scared that I'm not going to be able to continue an active life.    Besides the pain medications and the steroid shots I'll be getting in my neck, what else can I do to fix it/slow it down/live with it?

It's hard for me to get in the shower, to get something to eat for myself, forget cleaning the house. I am not okay with being on antidepressants and breastfeeding, but I don't want to stop breastfeeding the baby. I always make sure that the one thing I do do is play with the baby, keep her entertained, make sure she is happy. So I know I'm still a good mom, but the rest of my life is really taking a backseat. I feel bad for my husband. Not that bad, because he never helps me, but kind of bad because I never look nice anymore, the house is dirty, etc. I tried to make an appointment for myself to see someone but I have no insurance and they wouldn't see me. UGH... In the back of my head I am always thinking "god i am such a lazy fcuk." It's horrible. Maybe I am, it's not depression I'm just so lazy and pathetic. I definitely am not having another child, it's far too much work for me. Do you think I'm a scumbag or do you think it's depression?       ~sad on the couch

I contracted an STD from the attacker and was treated at Planned Parenthood. They put acid on my entire vulva.....It caused severe disfigurationa and I am having corrective surgery this coming spring.      Anyways, the whole thing was a nightmare. However, the worst part after going thru the hell of the assault was how I was treated by the nurse.....I read my medical file and she checked off "safer sex, STI Risk Reduction, HIV Risk Reduction, Emergency Contraception Offered, Smoking risks." She completely lied. She never told me any of those things. Also, I am not even a smoker so why would I need to know the risks of smoking?      I hate how mean they were there. Why did they have to check of "safer sex". It just made me sick. I had no control over whether it was "safe" I didn't ask for the guy to attack me.       How do I get over this? My surgery is in three months. However, the surgeon said I can only expect a 50% improvemnt. Do you thinkt he man I marry won't care if I am disfigured down there? I am so ashamed

I took her a bath around 10:00pm again to make her feel more comfortable. I just changed her diaper again around 20 minutes ago, it was diarrhea. And the rash looks worst. I put rash creme and she started screaming, am guessing it burned, so I took her a bath again. I asked her what hurts she touches her rash spot and her right ear. She has had 3 ear infections already. But I am more concerned about the rash. She has ate things that she usually eats except some honey maid cookies that her grandma gave her. What can it be?

I'm all in favor of being friendly, and taking the time to stop and visit with others, whether it be at work or home or elsewhere.      What I don't understand though, is people who spend EVERY SINGLE MOMENT of their lives in a non-stop frenzy of gossipping and giggling and texting and hysterics and "he said she said" and blah blah blah. In some cases, they literally spend more time talking than breathing. I'm not kidding.      And they talk about the most meaningless things . . . every thought in their head is blurted out, no matter how trivial. It's like a twisted form of "thinking out loud", although, I don't think they actually think before they speak. "I'm hot. I'm cold. I like gum. Purple is a pretty color. I like shoes. I took a dump this morning, and it was in the shape of Elvis."      What is it with these people? Is it simply severe immaturity, or is it some sort of personality disorder?

20090205200915AAOMjUv	Health;Men's Health	Do italian men in America get circumcised?	I was having a discussion with a friend of mine about the dropping rate of circumcisions in the US. Then we got into culture and tradition, but we couldn't decipher the myth of boys born to Italian families mainly in New York. Do European families migrating to the US change stance on circumcision? Europe has a 10% surgery rate while the US rate is 65%. I personally am against circumcision but I fascinated by the obsession on the male penis. There is no strong argument for circumcision that doesn't require STDs to be brought up. Solution to that: Wear a Rubber!

20090205201804AAia5Sg	Health;Mental Health	Feeling suicidal :(....?	'm failing college and don't know what to do. If I'm lucky, I'll finish up the semester with a 1.5 gpa. I had such high hopes for college, but now I feel like everything is hopeless. I started out strong, going to all my classes and studying, but after getting lower than expected grades and being completely unable to make friends, depression hit me hard. The familiar feelings of inadequacy and hopelessness came back so my schoolwork suffered. I started missing classes, stopped going to the library, and gave up on life. I have thought about suicide everyday for the past 2 months. And even though I don't do my work due to lack of motivation and pessimism, I am overwhelmed by stress. I've started to have panic attacks and frequently feel like throwing up. Every time I try to do something right, I either quit immediately from fear, or it turns out to be fruitless and my self-worth and confidence plummet again. I now feel like even if I did somehow miraculously pass, I would never get away from it. It would just happen next semester, or next year, or when I go to grad school, or when I get a job. It just doesn't seem like I'm meant to be on this earth. I should also mention that these feelings are compounded significantly by my suffering from avoidant personality disorder and dependent personality disorder. I have not been officially diagnosed with either, but I figure it's a pretty good sign when you suffer from every symptom. I can't even seek help because I'm afraid of talking to the receptionist at my school's counseling center to schedule an appointment. I can’t go anywhere else because I don't want anyone I know to find out I'm having these issues. I feel trapped in a world that doesn't want me.

I don't remember this ever happening before, but for 2 days now, I've been eating about 2 lbs of strawberries a day. The first day, there was no reaction, but tonight, there are very many unnoticeable (borderline invisible-flesh colored, non painful but irritable, when look very carefully you can see slight pink) tiny bumps on chin and jaw line. Are these hives? Are these just a reaction of eating too many strawberries? I didnt think i was allergic to anything...my tummy is a little cramped which i heard is a sign of allergies, but i think thats irrelevant.

I'm a marijuana smoker I have been smoking weed for about 2 years I roll it up in cigars (blunts), I have never had any lung problems before but yesterday I was smoking a perfectly normal blunt with normal weed and on one of my hits while I was inhaling deep I felt a sharp pain in my upper right lung. I stopped smoking after that but a dull pain has persisted in my upper right lung ever since its not a bad pain I can barely feel it but its there, it doesn't get worse when I breathe in deep or anything and my breathing seems completely normal, The only thing I can think of is maybe there was a marijuana seed in the blunt and that's what I inhaled that caused the sharp pain but i'm not sure, has this happened to anyone before what could have caused this and could i have caused serious, permanent lung damage?

20090205202912AA6HwhI	Health;Other - Health	Eye and leg twitching?	Well, about five days ago, my right eyelid started twitching. I didn't really think anything of it, I had looked online after a few days and said that it could come from lack of sleep, or allergies, and I was experiencing both. So I was like, oh, no big deal. And when it was finally easing up a little bit, today, my right knee started twitching some. I don't know if it was more of a spasm, because it lasted for a while. But when I moved my leg, it stopped.   Could that just be that blood flow wasn't going through my leg the proper way because I was sitting weird?   I'm really kinda starting to worry that things will get worse, because I keep thinking other things are twitching, but I don't know if I'm just worrying myself.  It doesn't hurt when it does that, but does anyone have any advice to what's going on and what could help (if anything)?

20090203070806AAwy6Gj	Health;General Health Care;Injuries	Can trapped or pinched nerve prevent muscle growth?	Hi - I have been doing good intense workout for 6 months now and on a proper diet with atleast 100 gms protein intake each day ( I weigh 140 lbs). However, I do not see progress. Have tried it all - change of exercises, weight increment, reps increment. I have been having nerve issue right from the start and it gets aggravated on the second day following my workout day.    Now my muscle strength has infact reduced due to nerve pain. My sleep is disturbed and I wake up with numbness and pain in arms. Is it possible that my muscle growth is halted due to trapped nerve ? (something like Insufficient oxygen to tissues etc )

The doctor said he didn't have to perform surgery as long as i can rehabilitate it and get it strong again. Well and the hard head i have, as soon as i stopped feeling pain i stopped doing my physical therapy. Now in 09 im feeling a very uncomfortable feeling in my knee and sometimes when i walk i feel like something in there is rubbing on something (sort of like a grinding type feeling but not really) i did gain a little weight since then, maybe 5lbs. I don't want surgery but i want it to get better. I was told i should exercise and have it drained every once in a while because there might be fluid build up.... what should i do?

I am doing this program to get my foot in the door of the dental school.  Right now i dont have a high enough GPA for dental school, but under the advise of the director of admissions i applied to this program.  I sat down with a associate of the dental hygiene program, she looked over my application and items and told me i had a good chance of getting in.  she seemed impressed; however i am really nervous.  Waiting a month to hear back is killing me.  I feel my application was good, letters of recommendation were good, and i have adequate background.  Has anyone gotten accepted or graduated from this program that can tell me what they are looking for, and what was your cummulative undergraduate GPA and etc.  thanks  i just need to ease my mind.

Anyway I have this really bad cough that isn't from a cold. (i.e. no signs of a cold) My doctor prescribed a nasal spray, an inhaler and an antihistamine because he says it looks a lot like allergies but it might be something other than allergies. I think it might be something different. The reason I think this is because I cough so hard that I throw up. I have even thrown up blood a couple of times. I am a little worried because I really don't know what is going on. I have to reschedule my doctors appointment because I haven't gotten any better. Is it possible to have an ulcer and not know it or have acid reflux or heartburn and not know it?

From this info, what is it that I am doing that is helping keep my appitite at bay? I love it but hope it lasts.

I am 20 years old and I have been having pain on the medial (inside) part of my knee for the past year...it went away for a while and now its back, worse than ever.  I did not have any specifiic injury however I wear high heels for my job and I am on my feet almost all day and I used to do dance.  I am guessing it is from one or both of those two.  I have been to 2 different doctors and had x-rays as well as 2 MRIs done.  They still dont really know what is wrong.  They keep saying it "might be" pes anserinus bursitis/tendinitis or plica syndrome.  They said there was some fluid in the bursa based on the MRI, but there is always a small amount of fluid in a bursa isnt there?  Anyway, I have had a cortizone shot in the bursa and it did nothing...typically that cures bursitis, or atleast relieves it.  I dont really think it is bursitis since the pain is constant and it is like a very sore ache...also, the pain is not really in the right spot to be an inflammed bursa.  Where I am experiencing pain is right below the medial(inside) joint line of the knee...the knee is slightly swollen in that area, also.  I have tried physical therapy and stretching and it has been to no evail.  They also said it could be plica syndrome, however, I do not have any problems going up and down stairs and my knee does not click...2 classic signs of plica.  I have no idea what is wrong with my knee and the doctors dont seem to either.  please offer any help you can.  I am going insane here.

The first month I started the pill, a year ago, I had a very light, almost non-existent period. Since then, it has been regular and normal.       This week, it's been another veryyy light period - if it even counts as a period. I had a day of usual period body aches/cramping. I had one or two small brown discharges, one teensy bit of red, and some clear mucus.      I took the whole month of pills as usual. Didn't miss any. Two days, the pills were taken at 11 a.m. instead of 7 a.m. but that's normal for other months as well.       I have also been very stressed this past month, more stressed than I can remember being in a VERY long time. We went through the process of buying our first home, renting out our mobile home and moving us and our toddler into this home. Money has been tight because of the transitions, down payment etc. I have been doing lots of heavy lifting, physical exercise and also general working out-type exercise, more than I've done in two years due to a lingering back injury.      What are your thoughts? Is this a light period due to stress? Does this count as a period?

20090205210215AALHlBq	Health;Diet & Fitness	Question for all women about your butt!!?	I know this sounds a bit stupid at first but this is serious cos I wanted to ask this to see what other women's experience was!!!    I'm 17, I always used to have a really flat butt. Before I had no curves to my body and since by booty was so thin and flat, my butt used to ache when I used to sit on it for more than 15minutes.   However now I've developed more curves  and a womanly shape, so  more fat goes to my butt, so I got a bit of a bubble booty going on!  I've noticed now when I sit down it feels a lot more cushioned and soft than it did before!   Have other women with rounder butts felt this! Does your butt make it feel comfy for you when you sit on it?   Just wanted honestly to kno whether other girls felt this?x  Thanks,  Liz

20090205210251AABOsol	Health;Other - Health	Ingrown Pubic Hair? How long to heal? and How to treat?	Ok so, my pubic region is dry, which I think is in part from tanning regularly.  And I noticed tiny bumps which I was unaware what they were, and shaved over it, and now there are more.  I'm pretty positive it's ingrown hair because I shaved quick before going out one night and dry shaved, clearly a big mistake, and now besides being dry, my hair has also grown in at different lengths, which pretty much proves the ingrown hair diagnosis I wduld say.  It only itches time to time, but it's been about 3 weeks now and most of my hair has grown out pretty far, but im still having difficulties with some.. this is my first time experiencing this, and I've read on here about pulling them out, I dont want to pull out like 20 ingrown hairs, I dont want scars.  Is this infact ingrown hairs? and how would I go about healing this?  I've been avoiding shaving for about 2 weeks now because I don't want to shave over it, it only seems to make it worse.. and could tanning have anything to do with this? Any suggestions are appreciated. Im also going to the beach on vacation in 3 weeks, I would really like to have this cleared up as much as possible by then (it's already been about 3, Im hoping it's pretty much ran it's course).. Thank you!
20090205210418AAyc5WE	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Diabetes	Am I too young to develop Diabetes?	I just turned 20 and I'm exhibiting an early symptom of diabetes which is constant thirst.  All I drink is water, and no matter how much I drink it just doesn't seem to be enough.  Also, my face always feels really hot, not to the touch, but just in general.  idk if that has anything to do with diabetes, but it worries me.

20090205210504AAGC8KZ	Health;Other - Health	.........refusal to sleep, problematic?	Yeah, question name is really lame, I can't put all that I'd like to because I don't know quite how to put it into words. I'm aware I've posted a similar question to this before, but, yup.   I dislike sleep immensly. To the point, it is now 2 minutes from 5am, and I still don't want to sleep. I dislike it because it takes away my time, and having little time stresses me out, and becuase I get so tired when I wake up afterwards. In general, I don't feel tired for hours anyway; I wasn't tired until about 1am onwards this morning. I'm exhausted right now but I just really can't bring myself to sleep. [[[Is there a term for this, and should I ask for some help about it or something?]]] Sometimes I get loads of sleep, but other times like this, and increasingly frequently, I get no sleep. On average I probably get about 5-6 hours sleep if I sleep at all. My thoughts at night are sometimes incredibly morbid and/or depressing.   Please don't say anything like 'just go to sleep' as it's not quite that simple and that is not what I am asking. If you need a recap, questions are in the [ and ]'s. Feel free to add additional information.

Well, I FINALLY got in to the psyciatrist today. They said the anxiety attacks were because I stopped the Klonopin. It was withdrawl. I tried asking them to change the med as even the Dr admitted that I was very senitive to it.  I have been on it since Feb (except for the last 2 weeks or so). Every single dose has made me very sleepy. At one point I was doing 1/2 of a .5 @ bed & morn and I was so tired I couldn't walk straight! So today they INCREASED the dose to a FULL .5 @ bed & morn and they think I WON"T be so sleepy! I have not seen the Klonopin do anything at all for anxiety. It DOES help to control my appetite and better bladder control but otherwise nothing. When I StOPPED the Klonopin, I wasn't tired. Fri my primary Dr put be back on Klonopin the 1/2  of .5 @ bed & that is is fine. Also have Lexapro 20 mg that works wonders. I tried to get them to increase w/o luck! I don't know if I want to be fat or sleepy! Give the Dr one more chance or go somewhere else NOW! I don't know.

Is it possible in this case a regular filling is the best option for me after a root canal or is it in general a bad idea? An answer from a dentist would be highly appreciated! THANKS.

I dont want to seem like a freak with abunch of jellies and creams to make it fit - but my doctor told me that most women can accomodate me and that its just  kinda  intimidating and i should just be patient and the right girl will come along.  Whats next - Im tired of masturbating- I want real intimacy- and im not a porn star freak just a regular guy
