There was a big snow storm here this past week and a lot of people are still without power, and my college just reopened Monday. Well today the electric company had my alley blocked off and were working on fixing peoples electric along with moving some of the trees/power lines that fell. Well I get up to go to school and the electric company says I can't leave because its a fire hazard.    So I email my teacher telling him the details of why I can't make it to class, he responds to me saying I missed a in class quiz a double lab along with telling me we have a review and another in class quiz Thursday. He tells me I can make up the lab on my own time but the quiz I cannot.     Is there anything I can do about this seeing as it wasn't my fault? Also I don't understand why the teacher would throw this much work out knowing some people are without electric and cannot make it to class because of it.  This is my lab course Geology if you need to know.

The debate was, give your life for an individual you could indeed live without, or watch that person’s life dissolve because of you, because you did nothing to prevent it. The affliction would scar you forever, not visible to others but sketched into your head and heart, something that would wake you before dawn regularly.     My brain throbbing as though slammed against a brick wall and my heart accelerating, it seemed time had slowed almost to a cut off.       What do you think will happen next? If your right easy 10 points    I'm only 16, and I wrote the story out of bordom.

I go to one of the GA institutional universities (to be technical, Valdosta State University) and don't pay much money for it. It's very cheap and I have a scholarship.

I think it'll be really cool to be able to graduate from those universities but the tuition over there is very expensive and I wonder it's really worth it. My parents told me if I really wanna go then they wouldn't mind paying. But again, is it really gonna be worth it? Is it really gonna help when I get a job?

It is a wonderful way to advance your career opportunities. College provides a wealth of knowledge. I believe being in college you become more responsible. It brings about more independence and it helps you mature in ways you never thought possible. However, college is becoming more and more expensive. There are grants, loans, and scholarships but tuition should still be lowered. College really pays off in the end. It takes a while to feel as if you have accomplished anything because there are so many classes unrelated to your major but staying focused you will see that there is a bigger picture. College is very challenging and demanding you have to stay focus and more importantly you have to be very optimistic otherwise you will give up.

I have trees there that bear me many apples.   Of every sort:      Clear, streaked; red and russet; green and golden;   Sour and sweet.   This apple’s from a tree yet unbeholden,   Where two kinds meet, -      So that this side is red without a dapple,   And this side’s hue    Is clear and snowy. It’s a lovely apple.   It is for you.      Within are five black pips as big as peas,   As you will find,   Potent to breed you five great apple trees   Of varying kind:      To breed you wood for fire, leaves for shade,   Apples for sauce.   Oh, this is a good apple for a maid,   It is a cross,      Fine on the finer, so the flesh is tight,   And grained like silk.   Sweet Burning gave the red side, and the white   Is Meadow Milk.      Eat it, and you will taste more than the fruit:   The blossom, too,   The sun, the air, the darkness at the root,   The rain, the dew,      The earth we came to, and the time we flee,   The fire and the breast.

20090203161216AAtW892	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	How much would a second degree help me?	Hi, I'm currently in my second year of a four year program for software engineering at Mcmaster university. I do enjoy software and would not even consider switching out of it, however I have other interests and my engineering degree does not allow for many electives. I am interested in other study areas, such as political science. If I were to take an extra year I would be able to take political science classes in with my engineering ones and graduate with a BA in political science and my software engineering B.Eng.    I'm wondering how much this would actually help me after I graduate? I also have the option of switching into a Software Engineering and Society program, which would also add exactly one year. The problem there is that it has a few less electives and those are for courses that I don't necessarily want to take that would make me graduate with a B.Eng.Society, what would the benefits of this be? The B.Eng.Society route would also leave me with a minor in political science, how useful is that compared with the full BA?     Please don't just say "you should do what you like" because I do still keep up with political science type stuff but a lot of it I could just read/learn on my own without devoting another year to school. Please just let me know your thoughts on how it would actually help me after school! Thanks.

I have passed the SAE in elementary education K-6, the General Knowledge Test, and am planning to take the Professional Test soon. Right now I hold a temporary certificate and have until June 2010 to finish the requirements listed on the Statement of Eligibility. I still have to take two classes and teach full-time for a year. The problem is that I have not been able to find a teaching job in Miami and I do not have the money to take two college courses. Will the Department of Education  take this teaching and economic crisis into account or will I have to do everything all over again come June 2010. I have subbed since 2002 and  was a 3100 for 6 months. Also, I have a Bachelors in English and Psych, and a Masters in Clinical Psychology. I live in Miami and would love to start teaching ASAP, but am very afraid that there will not be any positions open next year either, and I really don't want to have to go through the whole certification process AGAIN. Thank you in advance for your answers.

20090304175238AA3z0es	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	How hard would it be NOT to drop a course in college?	I don't know about other states, but here in Texas in 2008 they passed a bill that made it to where you are only allowed to withdraw from 6 classes your entire college career. Now me being as dumb as I was, decided that I was going to move in the middle of last semester, so I had to drop 4 classes. Now this semester I am looking at dropping 2 other classes, because I have not been attending them (yes I know), and I am heading out to another college next semester and my GPA can not drop below a 2.5 (which it will if I don't drop these 2 classes) or I will not be able to get into the university I am headed to. My question to you is, how many classes did you or have you dropped throughout your whole college career? And how hard do you think it would be not to drop any? Does your state have a withdraw limit? Can it be done if I watch CAREFULLY what classes I enroll in? Any advise you could give me would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!   P.S: By the way when I say drop I mean withdraw, just in case you were confused.

20090225070947AAdn0gM	Education & Reference;Special Education	Is there different degrees of dyslexia?	Since I was a little girl I have written some of my letters backward. I have trouble spelling (thank goodness for spell check) and I look at words and think they are spelled wrong even when they are right, they just look wrong. I was wondering if I could be dyslexic. I have always done well in reading comprehension but if I am trying to remember things like dates for a test I have to have someone read to me so I can remember. It is frustrating sometimes but I manage. I am in college now and I have trouble spelling so I get points taken off. I try to practice my spelling but when I see it and it doesn't look right I change it and it is usually wrong. I am not dumb, I do very well in school but I just have trouble with my spelling and writing letters backward. I know that people with dyslexia write their letters backward but can't read very well. I can read just fine which is why my question is are there different degrees of dyslexia.       I am also bad at math if that means anything. I also write numbers backward.

20090304175931AAw63kv	Education & Reference;Standards & Testing	My math skills are pretty good, but I keep scoring low on Practice Tests?	I've been through the entire GED Math Book, and I did a test in the book and only got 9 wrong out of 50 questions.      However, I'm not so good at timed tests at my school. Whenever I take a timed test, I keep scoring around 440 and can't seem to get higher. The reason why is because on a timed test, you only get about 1 min. 30 seconds to answer each question. And with math, I always take my time.      What should I do? Should I keep taking practice tests and try to get a higher score? I mean, it's starting to get boring and it feels like I'm going in circles. If I keep doing timed tests, I might start getting higher scores, I'm not sure what to do at this point. I'm trying to decide if I should just go take the real test or keep practicing.      For me, it's hard for me to answer a math question in 1 min 30 seconds.

20090304183130AAAlvsp	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Gay Rights English Paper Intro. Proofread?	America is a country based on the principle of equality for all of its citizens, save for one group of Americans who still struggle for the civil liberties that everyone else enjoys. Homosexuals continue to receive the leper treatment in America, from attempts in the 1970’s to ban all gay teachers from public schools, to the early days of the AIDS hysteria in the 1980’s, to the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” rule of the 1990’s. This discrimination stems from America’s Puritanical roots. Many religious organizations protest the granting of these equalities based on the grounds of immorality and like Newt Gingrich, former speaker of the house, think that gay values are “the opposite of what you’re taught in Sunday school” (Hertzberg). Bob Davies, a former President of Exodus International Church vigorously asserts that “the Bible's condemnation of homosexuality is as clear and plain as the Bible's condemnation of murder, adultery, premarital sex, kidnapping, lying and idolatry” (Exodus Standard.) Mormons and Evangelicals use bible verses such as: "if a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them shall be put to death for their abominable deed; they have forfeited their lives." (Lev 20:13) to justify their homophobic beliefs and deem that the rehabilitation of gays can lead to salvation and help former gays become functioning members of Christian society (Rev. Tom Benz.) In November, California passed Proposition 8 (Prop. 8), banning gay marriage. Supporters of Prop 8 have stated that gay relationships lack the basic principle of monogamy, which they site as a large factor in the AIDS epidemic faced by California, and allowing gays to marry would be an enormous insult to married, faithful, heterosexual couples (Christian Newswire.) However of the 18,000 same-sex couples married in California, some have been in monogamous relationships for over half a century and the new absurd illegal status they are facing is tearing apart families. In addition to the legality of the marriages, gay couples face prejudice when attempting to adopt children. The opposition believes that have homosexual parents is detrimental to a child’s development, however most research has shown that it does not matter whether a  child has homosexual or heterosexual parents as along as they are placed in a stable and loving home. With the recent election of President Obama action has already been taken to eliminate the U.S military’s anti-gay policy often referred to as the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” rule. Veterans and active duty soldiers feel that the repealing of this rule would cause problems, and clash with their Christian beliefs. Other feel that if a man or woman, straight or gay, is willing to give up their life for our country, then they have every right to serve in the military. Despite America’s strongly religious ancestry, it is a country of many freedoms. Gay Americans have the right to the same freedoms as straight Americans in every regard, including marriage, adoption, and military service.

But ever since she started going out with this guy she has changed completely. She has started to cut herself, she listens to completely different and rather disturbing and depressing music, she is now "bi" and is possibly going out with my other friend. (btw I have no problem with people who are homosexual I'm not judgemental) And the thing his, her boyfriend is bi, he listens to the same music, and he also cuts himself. She also went and got high with her girlfriend(I dont know if they are officially going out.. it's confusing) and that is not something she would usually do. She's just different and she is lying to me and her other friends. When I found out she was cutting herself, she told me she has doen it since 6th grade, but I spent the entire summer together with her last year and I would have definatly noticed the scars. I know her and she would have told me. She's told me that "I'm more of a friend than her girlfriend" or whatever but then she turns right around and is a  completely different person with her "gf". Its like she is trying to please both of us. I'm not jealous and its not like I am the only person who can  be her friend, but I'm really worried about her. She is really convinced she loves her boyfriend. The good thing is, is that he is a really sweet guy and really cares about her and her family. You see she has been going through alot of ****! She has four siblings and lives in a foster home with a mom who doesn't give a **** about her. I guess she is crazy for him, because he makes her really happy. I don't know.. I really need HELP!

Really this is at school, unlike home where I'm a completely person. In school I'm really quiet and shy, and have no clue what to say. I want to say things and be a very loud sociable around people my own age. But, I can't think of anything to say and if I do it makes me look bad. Where as, at home I'm always talking and have a welcoming personality. I don't really know why I just do.    My friend says she's noticed that I don't have very good people skills. Since then I've tried to become more sociable but have trouble doing it. It wasn't always like this; I used to always be very lively around people, but somehow that's changed. Please help me out, give me advice on how my people skills can improve, something! And if so thanks.

I am planning on finishing up my schooling in the next 2 years.  I am turning 20 soon, and my boyfriend is 20 now.  I want to be able to live with him off campus.  We already are saving up, but i still need to convince my dad.  I have 2 years of college under my belt already, and i have done very well.  I also have talked to him about staying off campus, and he seemed fine with it, just haven't mentioned maybe living with my boyfriend.        We have been best friends for awhile before dating, and now we just cant be apart.  We are both responsible, and do not plan on having sex until we are both out of school and most likely married. (dont need a baby on top of school)  I currently work fulltime and go to school fulltime, and since we both live about 30 min away from eachother, it gives us less time to see eachother.      We are both responsible people, and his parents know that, how do i convince my father of the same?      (my mother passed away a couple years ago, and i live with just my dad and older brother)

"From this square he built his empire,   and from this stone that commemorates his REIN so pure,   Go somberly to that place where,   'Only those who wish to pray may enter,'   A pace to mark each day in that 10th month   he waited for his narcissus crown.   Since this journey is one to make in solitude,   REIGN Tencendur a score's pace toward the rising round. "      So I believe the square is St. Peter's Square. The quote in the riddle is from the Chapel of the Sacrament which is inside St. Peter's Basilica. Tencendur is Roland's horse. Obviously "toward the rising round" means East. Note that (i think purposefully) the reign and rein are switched around.       The answer to this clue will lead me to a medallion. It is hidden on my school's ground. The school is called Trinity and the mural in the chapel of the Blessed Sacrament is of the Trinity, so that might have something to do with it.      Thank you!!
