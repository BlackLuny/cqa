Se qualcuno dei due è interessato all’altro, o tutti e due reciprocamente, chi deve dare il primo passo?   Credo che le ragazze abbiano ancora certi pregiudizi su questo, ma non sono sicuro che abbiano torto, forse è normale che sia l’uomo ad avvicinarsi per primo. Cosa ne pensate?

Llevo divorciada dos a?os, aún no los supero aún amo a mi ex. El me fue infiel con su recepcionista, y ahora sigue con ella. Yo siempre tuve la esperanza de que el volviera, tenemos hijos peque?os, el los ve todos los domingos. Y pues de verdad yo lo amo, de verdad yo sí quería criar a mis hijos al lado de él, yo si quería compartir el resto de mi vida juntos, pero me fue infiel, lo perdoné pero luego de un a?o continuó con el enga?o, y no tuve más remedio que pedirle que se fuera. Creyendo que se iba arrepentir y pondríamos entonces intentarlo de nuevo. La cosa es que es que sigue con la misma mujer, ella fue parte causante de que mi matrimonio se derrumbara, el sabía que yo estaba embarazada y tenía otros dos hijos, sabía perfectamente que mi ex estaba casado conmigo y tenía una familia. No obstante se enamoraron y ahora ya yo no soy nada para mi ex esposo, solo le causo lástima. y hoy por primera vez el se atrevió a salir con esta mujer y mis hijos. Me molesté mucho,

20080318234031AAfJ3rW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why don't shy boys make a move 'til the last minute?	It seems like a shy boy will love a girl for a long time (as long as it's mutual) but will never really "show interest" or even give a little hint until she gives him the idea, she "doesn't care" (even if she does care). It seems that once a girl "plays it off" that she doesn't have any time for him or gives him the idea she doesn't "think of him", he'll start to make a move.       Why?   (and i also noticed w. an average "nice guy", there will be one factor that will motivate him to make a move - maybe she's hot, she did something cute, sex but w. shy boys it seems he'll ALWAYS love her but won't show her 'til later)

20080306155248AA26AbV	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Todo comenzó en internet?	gracias por lerme:      Tengo 40 a?os, una hija de 12 que vive con su padre desde hace uno porque decidí que era lo mejor para ella y para mi, mi trabajo es inestable, a veces por mi culpa a veces por culpa del empresario (hablo de contratos) vivo en Espa?a, llevo divorciada 8 a?os y desde entonces he tenido un sinnumero de parejas, la mayoría han acabado siendo sólamente parejas sexuales porque la cosa no iba para más, en este tiempo me he quedado embarazada dos veces y he abortado las dos.      Vivo lejos de mi familia, y a veces no me siento tan bien como quisiera, mi trabajo no me desagrada del todo, pero siento que es algo mecánico por lo que paso diariamente sin pena ni gloria, el dinero apenas me dura, tengo excesivos gastos sin razones y siempre tengo alguna deuda pendiente. Mi contrato termina el mes que viene y quedaré una vez más en el desmpleo.      En noviembre conoci a un hombre en una web internacional de encuentros, seria y respetable, empezamos a chatear y a intimar de algun modo, habalamos por chat y telefono a menudo, el es inglés y vive en Alemania, yo en Espa?a, recientemente he viajado alli a conocele, me quedé cuatro días, el encuentro fue cordial y muy hermoso pronto intimamos, ambos tenemos la misma edad, culturalmente andamos en la misma onda y tenemos conceptos de la vida similares, desdences mis sentimientos por él han ido creciendo y él pienso que también siente algo por mi, sin embargo prudentemente o no sé porqué, ninguno de los dos hace o dice nada, algún comentario velado tal vez, solemos hablar prácticamente a diario, sin embargo nos veremos de nuevo en Mayo, que es cuando yo puedo viajar, él es profesor en una escuela y no puede viajar de momento tal vez hasta verano, yo no deseo esperar tampoco.      Siento un grado de intimidad muy grande con esta persona pero sin embargo no quisiera hacerme ninguna ilusión, si algun dia no está en linea,  sufro muchisimo pensando que tal vez ya no quiera hablarme nunca más, si me dice que está ocupado con su trabajo tengo la sensación de que se cansó de mi, aunque luego hablemos y todo sea igual. Yo sinceramente he estado haciendo balance de qué tengo o qué no tengo, me siento completamente estancada y atrapada donde estoy, hace tiempo que siento que estoy envuelta en un círculo vicioso de fracasos, caídas y ya apenas levantamientos, siento que el tiempo ya no juega a mi favor y deseo con toda el alma intentar algo con este hombre,  pero siento un miedo horrible a ser rechazada y tengo un concepto algo distorsionado de acerca de quien debiera de dar los primeros pasos para qintentar algo más serio, o buscarlo. No se como proponerselo, o ni siquiera preguntárselo. Gracias de antemano por su  tiempo

Ive got an uncle who has a speech impedement and walks up the street doing a funny dance singing: 'come aboard on the double decker bus' whenever he sees a bus, a kid who keeps coming round askin me what ive got for him. And a bloke who comes round and wont shut the hell up about his 'girlfriend'. he lives in dudley and she lives in bristol and he has to keep travelling to her whenever he wants to see her. and when he does he makes himself skint buying stuff for her. his mom and dad cant stand her. Ive decided to ditch all of them. I think ive made a good choice. i always thought friends were people you can relate to. but theres no way i can relate to those guys!
20080504052437AACCSQ1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	She's coming back and I don't know how/what to feel/do...?	I have a girlfriend who I've been going out for 4 years.  She was my love of my life and I wanted to marry her and have children.  But my trust and love for her died as soon as she left me... My girlfriend left a few days ago to meet a guy she never met before over the internet.  It was evident that she wanted to do stuff with him (clubbing, having sex, going to the beach) from her myspace, emails, text messages... Now she's coming back today and I don't know how to feel, or what to do.  I feel more crappier everyday because the whole fact that she is with this guy and not with me hurts me physically, emotionally, and mentally.  What kills me the most is that she texted me saying she misses me... but never saying I love you.  I have a feeling so found someone new, someone who is more outgoing, more playful, more everything.  If you listen to John Mayer, listen to "Man of the Side," or "Comfortable."  My heart is crushed, dead, and sometimes I want to kill myself since I'm not worth it.

Quanti di voi la pensate come me? Oppure quanti riposte aggressive avrò ? sono de quelli che ancora credo nella forza del Amore, della no violenza , credo che ci possiamo farla ….

20080319155950AApDgsP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need you help with this guy who won't leave me alone?	There is this guy that lives in the same apartment building as me and also works at the same place as me. He introduced himself and came over one night to watch TV which was fine. But acouple of days later at work he followed me into the employee bathroom to say "Hi"  and just stared at me while I was tucking my shirt which really creeped me out. He came over again acouple of nights later and told me I had a "beautiful smile." I don't think he's gay and even if he is I'm not. I think he is just trying too hard to be friend and I dont' feel comfortable around him.       So how do I politely give him the brush without being rude but I don't want to be too social to where he thinks he can come over and hang out. I tried once to reach out to someone in the name of friendship and was rudely brushed off and I don't want to do the same thing to him.      Any advice you can give me would be great as I'm at a lost.

I mean, my ex decided it wast time for her to move on and find greener pastures, now she's trying to get me back, when this whole thing was HER decision in the first place.      I must have at least 6 friends right now that are going through the same thing. Their wives/girlfriends decide to break up, then after no time at all, they want to reestablish contact and get back together?      Even here on YA, there seems to be guys every day, asking why their ex girlfriends are contacting them after the girlfriends wanted to breakup.      Do people not realize what they've got until its gone? Do people only want what they cant have? When are people going to stop playing games and realize that relationships take work and the grass is not always greener? Why are only GUYS "mean" when they don't want to talk to their ex after a breakup? Seriously, do people have any clue how many women stop talking to their ex boyfriends and noone seems to think that is mean! I don't get it!

He says that if we do he feels like it will make our relationship much stronger and it will be almost like a promise to eachother that even when we are apart we will remain faithful. I don't buy any of it. I think that he just wants sex. I am not ready for it. He is obviously ready. I know that he will wait for me, but...   How do I know if he is making all of this up for sex or if he really feels like he needs it to be apart from me?

Ok, so a high percentage of women hate their bums. infact, according to a survey, it is the most hated part of a woman's body (from a womans point of view). However, men love them! Men adore bums and it is joint-first with boobs as a mans favourite body-part on a woman. How come men love 'em but women hate 'em? Men, whats so good about a womans butt?   =]

20080608193441AAmLBMA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I break up with a guy I have only been seeing for a month?	I have been dating a guy for a little over a month....but I have decided I want to work things out with my ex. I know this guy is really into me, and I actually feel a little bad, because had I thought that there was any chance with the ex, I would have never gotten involved with the new guy. Should I tell him why I am breaking up with him or just use something general, like I don't think things are going to work out? Is it acceptable to do it over the phone? I suck at breaking up with people. Help

20081006215145AAwivoS	Family & Relationships;Friends	Something bothering me? ?	I met these two new friends a couple of weeks ago while playing squash. On that day, both said that I can join in and play along. Today when I ran into one of them, I asked him when he will be playing again, he told me that he can't, he's really busy these days and he wouldn't be playing anytime soon. Then I got discouraged. Well, it's just the way that he said those words.  I like to ignore it but Ijust can't for some reason. But his friend said that I can join in whenever either of them are playing.    The thing is that sometimes I feel I cannot trust anyone. And I also don't have a lot of friends either. What should I do in a situation like this? It's bothering me a lot. Did I take what he said the wrong way?       Oh and should I talk to his other friend and tell him that this guy is just not interested, doesn't like me at all or hate my guts?

20081010094809AAaFSrK	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Men's point of view:  what does he really want?	My ex boyfriend and I split because he wasn't getting enough free time (time to play video games), and I felt semi neglected.  This was the root of all our bickering.  It is obvious that I should have been more understanding to his needs and that he needed his time alone.  He's a sweet, funny, and very smart guy so, of course, I miss him like crazy.      I've run into him and he'll tell me how he thinks about me every day and even goes out of his way to make small talk (if he see's I'm online).  I've asked him out to coffee just as friends and he said "Maybe, but I don't know if I'm ready...we'll see."  I can't tell what message he's trying to send me.        I know he's not seeing anyone else, because of what his friends have told me and his alone time was a symptom of our break up.  Men, can you impart your knowledge on me?
20081007133727AAEM2YS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Cooincidence or fate?	Now I have always been the guy that believes there is a reason everything happens, not everything happens for a reason. But this is weird.      I dated this girl my senior year in HS and my freshman year in college. 2.5 years total. We had a great relationship but I ended it because I was young and just wanted to be single entering my 20's. Fast forward to 10 years later. I have become recently single and haven't heard from or seen my HS ex in 10 years. Than just weeks after my ex and I broke up I was looking around on myspace and my HS ex popped into my head. So I looked around and tried to see if she had a page and she didn't. Then later that night, I get on myspace again and I have a friend request from her, and I am her second friend so I know she must have just made her page. So we get to talking over the next few days and I find out that she is married but things aren't going well and even though they have tried counseling, it isn't working. She says that her and her husband aren't even friends, they are only trying to make it work because they have a son together. She basically said that she is going to leave, she just can't bring herself to do it yet.       She has made comments to me about how crushed she was when we broke up and how she has never cared about anyone as much as she cared about me. Now we have both decided not to see eachother because she is still married and she needs to focus on that before anything else.       Now like I said, I don't really believe in fate but how the timing has played out with this is just weird. So do you think I am thinking too much into this or does it seem that our paths were supposed to cross again once we grew up?

20080926121503AA66Ezt	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Living with partner and sharing money/assets?	My partner and I are going to be setting up home together and need some ideas on how to share assets and money.   I will be putting 60k, plus a 70k mortgage toward the purchase of a house and he will be putting 20k into the purchase (total house price 150k).   I will be earning about 35k and he about 16 to 20k a year.      What is the best way for us to share our income. Should we consider the house as jointly owned (meaning I lose my equity and assets) or does he just own 13% of the property?   How do we share out living costs, do we both pay a percentage of our income, say 20% into a joint account, or do we both pay a fixed amount, which means he would be worse off as his income is less than mine.   If he only owns 13% of the property, does this mean he should only pay 13% of any repairs and maintenance and insurances for the property?!   What about my monthly mortgage payments, if he pays towards the mortgage, does his share of the property go up?      Thanks for any advice, we've been discussing it all day and dont really know the best way about it.

20080707152337AAUcyP1	Family & Relationships;Friends	Am I doing the right thing?	I have a friend "Steve" whose been my friend for almost ten years. He's like a brother to me. When its just me and him he's great but when he gets around other people, mainly my other friends, he tries to impress them by putting me down. Nothing blatant but little cutting remarks and name calling.He doesn't have many friends - one other person outside me - so he tries to impress my friends hoping they'll become his.       Case in point, a few days ago I was seeing off my friends from Kansas City and I invited Steve again because he doesn't have many friends. Again he tried too hard to impress them and called me a "douche bag". Forgive my language. It pissed me off and my friends think he's a jerk now.      I talked to him multiple times about this and he said he's sorry and he'll try harder next time but I'm thinking there won't be a next time and I'm not going to invite to hang out with my friends anymore.      Am I doing the right thing? I need your guys imput. Thanks.

20081006093113AAmXA7Y	Family & Relationships;Family	What do I do about a parent who is a moocher? ?	I am in a well paying profession, early 30's, but I live in an expensive city and am swimming in  student loans. However, to people where I grew up, my salary makes me wealthy because they have no concept!   My Dad has been a moocher his whole life and has been asking for money since college from me.   After my parents divorced he gave us no money, he never gave a cent towards my schooling or helped at all.  He works, but in a sales position where he makes little to no money and spends all his money on lottery tickets and other useless things.   He used to mooch off his mom (grandma) but since she passed he is now moving onto me. The problem is that he now has a genuine illness, but he has asked so many times before I feel that the welcome is warn out and I don't want to help him at all.    I could send a few $100 a month but it would mean not paying some of my own bills or getting behind on my debt which is very large.  I live alone, am unmarried and pay for everything myself.   I live about 4 hours away from my family and have now stopped wanting to go home at all because all I do is get asked for money everytime I do.   What should I do?  Thanks.

20080706132927AAOUgku	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does my bestfiend like me back, leading me on, or are we just good friends?	He and I have been good friends since summer of soph. year of high school and now we will be soph. in separate colleges. I started to like him my senior year when he and I started hanging out; just the two of us rather than the whole group. I believe he knows I like him. If both of our mutual guy friends know, he would know. right? Anyway, first year away from home was tough, however he and I kept in touch throughout. He even came and visited my school during his break. And during breaks from college we hung out a lot and when we did he paid. He never paid before. And for some reason he doesn't like me paying. (unlike our other mutual guy friends, when I offer they are super excited :D) And this summer we've been hanging out more like feeding ducks, the typical dinner and a movie, and so forth. I like him more than just a good friend, but I have no clue if he likes me back. How do I know without asking him lol? What are we?         He is very private. Does not tell guy friends anything.

Lucky he said he'd love to...but we never talked in real life. We're in a musical together right now, but we're not even in the same cast. We participated in these summer games at the company which hosts the musicals in the same group, and only talked a bit after he sent me a friend request on facebook. I'm a sucker at this, and only I have been asked out but never did it myself! I'm so nervous, what can I do??

20080820102649AA6ll86	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls.... is this forgivable?? I need advice ?	I was dating my GF for 7 months, we are 20 and in college.... as our relationship grew she insisted on spending more and more time together. We spent time with each others families, we planned our future, she wanted a promise ring which I gave her etc... For the summer she was going to nyc and i was staying back at home.... Anyway, as we got closer to summer it seems like all she would talk about was new york and how she couldnt wait to get there and leave school etc. I'm not going to lie it kind of hurt my feelings. After she left I was having a hard time and we got into a few arguments... I missed her and was really having a hard time adjusting, I know I messed up.... She then decides to break up with me...we still talked etc and I called her everyday to talk...sent her letters, would call to talk about her day, made her a build-a-bear relevant to her internship, sent her starbucks giftcards for to have for the morning etc... That when on for a month but the better I got the worse she got, she would yell at me and be short with me.... Finally she called and said she never wanted to talk to me again, wanted nothing to do with me, we had no chance of getting back together etc. So I then started to talk/date another girl ...when she found out she flipped out, cried, said it was not definitely over etc. That was 2 months ago .... we will be back at school in 4 days.... she has agreed to dinner but says she does not have feelings anymore ... Was all this my fault?, did i drive her to dump me?

If things don't go his way, he throws things and breaks things, although he does not hit me.  Recently he has made threats to me "saying he will kill me if I leave"  I have thought of moving out and cutting off the utilities to get him to leave.  If I call the police, I think it will make a bad situation worse.  The funny crazy thing is I still love him.  I pay 90% of the bills and am a professional business woman.  I want things to be over.

I can't tell if he actually likes me or hes just mad I have a boyfriend. i dont know if its worth losing my boyfriend for something I dont know if its going to last!

(causing you to have a different personality because of your inner emotions)         is that worth having?..      ....unless you're type of a person who is desperate of looking for someone because you're tired of not having a relationship, then i can understand. but if you're satisfied with your life that you're currently living?.. would you trade that for love?...      because love has its own foundation of controlling your emotions...   it just depends on people how they react on the situation...

20081008083650AAtNYyP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I call him back first?	I've not been dating anyone with serious intent for at least a year and a half now and I feel like I am floundering around.      I went on a spontaneous date... we both said we were hungry and he suggested going out to eat... we went to a bar, ate, drank, and talked till 2 am (that was when the bar closed) we walked out, talked more, he asked for my number and kissed me before the date ended.      The kiss was a peck, but I was too surprised with the action to really react to it and hastily said good bye, got in my car, and left dazed.       I felt like I gave him the wrong message because I really do like him. He texted me afterwards but I didn't get to text him back till the following day because I fell asleep for work. I hate text messaged because it's hard to tell the tone of someone voice through it.      Should I call him back first? Today will be day 2, or should I wait?      I'm hesitant in calling, but I really enjoyed the date more than I feel like I let on.       Should I call him first or wait to see if he is still interested?

He left for college this year, and sometimes i can deal with it fine, but sometimes (like right now) i miss him really bad. He hasnt been online recently because hes so busy, and doesnt have time to call home or respond to emails (he's taking a lot of hard classes).

20081012191451AAOZaxS	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Coping with loneliness in a marriage from a male's point of view?	I have been with my wife since I was 16. I am now 32. We have one child who we both adore. We have good jobs and from the outside it looks like we have everything going for us. However, I feel neglected. I am one of those few guys who actually think marriage is 50/50. I cook 90% of the meals, I do laundry 80% of the time, clean up after dinner, take out the trash, mow the yard 100% of the time, iron the wife's uniforms for work when she is running late. Plus I am very active in my child's life.    My wife has gotten to the point where she no longer thanks me for dinner or any of the other chores I do. She has come to expect it. Rarely does she kiss me when she leaves for work, sex is damn near out of the question and a hug would be great on occasion too.    I am just so fed up with being her maid. I thought maybe it was because I gained weight after an injury. I have dropped a lot of weight and totally changed my lifestyle to make sure that I am healthy for my family and myself.    I am really at my wits end with this because this has been going on for the last 9 years since we had our child.    I don't want to have an affair and for that matter I do not know of any other women who would want me. I don't want a divorce because it would tear my child apart plus kill me financially. I have tried talking to my wife about it. We have fought about it. Any form of communication one can have about this issue we have had. All she ever tells me is that she does not make me feel that way. She totally discounts my feelings.      I guess I should have been like most other guys in the world and took the "women are here for me approach" because being a nice guy has really bit me in the ***.

How should I convince them she is ready to go on her own? Help me please!

20090227171223AAxPrCR	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why do people always do this....?	Okay, so someone asks a question in Marriage and Divorce about who is right and who is wrong -- them or their spouse.  Let's say for argument's sake it is one of those really cut and dry things where it is OBVIOUS that 99% of people are going to say, for example, that the wife is wrong (she is the one who asked the question.)      So, say 99% of people think the wife is DEAD WRONG and they make it very clear.  Most of them even type a few paragraphs about WHY they think the wife is wrong, and they completely explain and prove their reasoning.        The wife gets 20 answers.  19 of them say she's wrong, with explanations.  ONE PERSON says "Oh you're totally right he's a jerk!"  And know what, low and behold, that person gets best answer and 5 stars and a "Oh I know, right?!" comment.      So, why do people ask for advice if what they REALLY want is just to be told whatever they want to hear -- that they're right?  Why bother asking for the public's opinion if you aren't going to take the advice of the LARGE majority of people?

20090221124740AA8VS8M	Family & Relationships;Friends	I'm being phone bullied - Ideas on how to get them back?	For the last 3 days I've been getting 'Withheld Number' calls on my mobile which are either cut off as soon as I answer or I'm deafened by giggling and shrieking.      One of my friends knows who it is and it is actually a girl I thought didn't mind me. Obviously not. We guess that one of my 'friends' must have given her my number.   (We'll call the caller S for now)   So far I've been playing along with S and pretending I still don't know who it is until I can get some advice.      Tonight, S drew the last straw - She called me up and started to sing my name at the top of her voice and asking me about my ex. She then started to call me a "Dog" "Bird" "Fish" etc (my last name is an animal name)    It seems someone must have told her who I used to fancy because she started to go on about him.    I feel really hurt and upset but before I go off and report them to someone I wanna get my own back >:D      Any ideas? Things like "Beat her up" wont work because S is bigger than me and I don't want to physically confront her - just mess with her head a little!   ~points to the best advice~

So there's a guy who i have been talking to for about 2 months. The first two months were maginificent and he would call me every night etc. He has even made little jokes about me being his wife etc. Well just about a week ago, he has been somewhat distant. Now his distance doesn't have anything to do with sex bc we've never done that. So i texted him and asked what happened to you lol? (referring to how he has changed and what not) he texts back nada. Then I say well if you want me to leave you alone, I will. I won't bother you and he says quote unquote.. "ease up, i got some things going on." So i assumed that he doesn't wanna continue what we have so i text him back and say well i wish you the best of luck and he responds by saying hahahahaha. So I simply texted him that "why is that funny, lol u told me to back up and leave you alone. I am still waiting on his response. Should I just assumed that it's over. I don't want to be in a long drawed relationship. What do you think.      By the way, this guy is 31

20081028122243AAGt33x	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Ladies: would you mind if your husband did this?	I stay home with 2 babies, my husband works. He has a little project he wants to make a machine on the side and he can use the materials at work and their machines to do it. I am alone all day with the 2 babies. I like being a stay at home mom, but I do get lonely therefore I like when he comes home from work. He calls me sometimes at around the time he is due to leave work & asks if it's o.k. that he stay late and work on his project (unpaid of course) I always say yes, but I am a little annoyed b/c I generally have dinner started by the time he calls and says he is going to stay late. Also I want him to be home & so does my older child. He never knows when he'll be done either, sometimes he stays an hour sometimes 2-3 hours. Would you mind if you were me? I am not going to tell him no, and I don't think it is wrong of him to do it, I was just curious of other's opinions. BTW, he is not cheating, I know that for a fact b/c he brings home the things that he makes. Also, I've told him to let me know earlier if he is gonna stay so I don't already have dinner started but he doesn't know until the end of the day if there is going to be a machine available.

20090227172155AAtGuNp	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I Cought My Husband Cheating Last Night...I Need Help!!?	We've been married for 8 yrs. We have a 4 yr old. and a home.  On Dec. of 2007, he went to visit his family in TX bec. his grandma was dying.  He went by himself.  Last night, for some ODD reason, I went to his cellphone bill back in Dec-Feb, 2998 & I found out that his been calling a particular number in TX constantly, everyday, and many many times!!! He would call this number up to 2,3,or 4 a.m. I confronted him and he said, it was his sisters old number and that he called his sister and brother for some advise (bec. we're having arguments at that time).  So, I called his sister & asked her if she knows the number that I saw on the bill.  His sister no, she did not have that number before.  So, I cought him lying & cheating right there!  I kept asking him if he cheated but he keeps saying he didn't and he will not cheat and have a long distance relationship all the way to TX.  I know my husband cheated on me bec. the phonebill was $710.86 for the month of Feb. when he used to call her.  At this point,  I know he cheated on me, he batrayed me. No way I'll forgive him.  He hasn't talked to me and apologize for what he did. He will NEVER admit that he cheated and he got caught!   I want to leave him so bad but we have a son.  I don't know if I still be able to trust him.  I want out but we have a son.  I NEED HELP!!  He cheated on me and he still have not talked me to explain himself.  What do I need to do?  I don't deserve any of this!!

20090227172202AA4TjNZ	Family & Relationships;Friends	Will my childhood in some way affect the way I will be when I am older?	While I have had a better than a lot of people in this world... I am not complaining...      I am 17 ( soon 18 ) , I have moved a bunch of times, changed schools 8 times. At the age of 14 or around that ( I found out all ages club ) and I am addicted to going there. Al thought for the fact that I move a lot...from time to time I cant go ( not too many ppl like going on a weekly basis :P ). I make friends easily, I am a funny guy. Never had something serious with a girl ( the club thing...) and I dont really want to. I grew up in South America till the age of 12 then moved to North America and moved around a bit till we ( parents and brother ) bought a house...and I never really lived in the "good part" of town lol...While my parents provided all that I need it ( I still feel that I was deprived of certain things...that occur when you move a lot and are not rich ). As a result of moving I can speak 3 languages...   I am a cool guy...but I feel angry ( like inside...you know like sad mixed with anger ) I don't show it ( I have become really good at not feeling anything ). Like when I talk to people I use to know and they tell me how they are still hanging out with the same friends.. I feel sad and angry..Like " why not me? "   Next year I am hoping to go into university for physics ( so I am smart guy as well ) but right now I am living in this area "high middle class" and well when this kids they get 80's or marks like that...their parents give them prizes and **** like that ( cars... ).... I know not a lot of people get cars but still it makes me feel pissed as hell. When I do great in school..my parents tell me "good job"   while I do appreciate the fact that I have parents ( because I am lucky just because of that ) I still wonder why not me? how come I cant get a 09 car when I do well in school ? how come I have had to make new friends every year?   why dont I really care for ppl except my family?   why am I so angry and sad inside yet I am normal on the outside?   Why do I like girls that I meet at clubs more than girls that I meet at school and such?
20090227171432AADePKm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What would YOU do!!!?!1?	ok, so right now I'm 16 years old. Recently, I just friended one of my old friends on myspace. The last time I saw her was a couple years ago.      Back then, I sort of liked her and she knew it. I don't really know if that affects anything now, I just want to put as much info as possible.      so my question is, do you think it would be weird if I asked her out after all this time? Do you think that she would still think of me as the same person I was two years ago, or would she realize that I have changed and matured as a person?      thanks.

I have no problem with asking her to have sex but the problem is we are hardly  ever alone, so should I ask her?  Then we could plan a time or should I just wait till we are alone and just start in on her? Oh and if I do ask her how do I not sound like I'm pressuring her because she doesn't do well under pressure and I want to make it clear to her that if she doesn't want to then I can wait? It would be both are first times.

I have been dating my girlfriend for about 5 months now, and she is like nobody I have ever met before.  I have fallen in love with her, and we have both talked about getting married after college.  The thing is, I am a junior in high school.  I would do anything for her, and we are both willing to wait. She doesn't want to get married while still in college, though.  She says that education is more important.  We plan on trying hard to go to the same college.      My question is, is it odd to have been dating for that long before getting married?

20090227173019AAyA6am	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I like this guy...but there are some problems.?	First of all, we go to different schools. I see him maybe twice a year if I'm lucky.       I met him about four years ago, but we're basically just acquaintances.      We started texting about a month ago. He got my number from one of his friends...who just happens to have an enormous crush on him. I can't tell her that I like him because she'll pretty much kill me.       He is involved in so many activities, and it's hard to find the right time to text him because he's hardly ever free. When we do talk, the conversations seem to be repetitive because we talk about the same stuff over and over.       He doesn't know I like him, but that's probably a good thing for now.       So basically, my question is how do I get to the good friend stage with him so I have a shot at a relationship with him in the near future? I'm also gonna see him in two weeks, so what should I say and how should I act? Should I give him a subtle hint that I like him? And if so, HOW do I give him a subtle hint?       Thanks in advance! :)

20090227171721AARCZHx	Family & Relationships;Family	Why is my mam still controlling me?	Im 19, living 100miles away from home, studying at university.      Me and my mam have never gotten on well as i got older.  She has always been very strict, and always made most of my descisions for me.      We argue all the time because she says i dont do enough to help around the house, and it hasnt stopped sinced i moved away, when i come home for a week she'll be angry that i havnt done something.      I set the table, clean the dishes away, help with tidying, is this not enough?      Ive been seeing my boyfriend a year, and whenever i ask to stay over at his house she gets angry, and tells me i'm not allowed.  im 19!!!!!!  He comes and visits me every week at uni and stays in my room (she is fully aware of this) yet when i come home she wont let me stay at his house (he lives just next to my mams house)      She shouts at me because i dont ring her enough whilst at uni... She shouts that im not doing enough extra curricular activities at uni, blah blah blah      i understand every stoy has two sides, and ill not lie - i can be selfish sometimes, but all in all i think im a good person.  I know i dont do LOADS around the house, but i do more than alot of people my age.      Why can't i get on with my mam, moving to uni has been the best thing ever, giving me space and freedom.  If i had stayed at home i would have cracked.  When i was at home i was crying every other night, and going crazy with the arguments and not being allowed out.        Im alot less stressed at uni, but when i go home it starts all over again, how can i make my trips home better for me and my mam?

20081121201442AAL3Fvd	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why is my guy friend ignoring me?	I've known him for four years now, and I THOUGHT we were pretty good friends. (We talk a lot online, and that's pretty much how our friendship grew.) And when we see each others in the halls, he'd always yell "KIMMY! HEY!" at the top of his lungs. (Quite embarrassing, but hey, you've gotta accept a friend who they are.. heh.) And when I say he always would, I mean it. That's just the way it is with us. Our greetings are pretty enthusiastic. If it's not an obnoxious hello, it's a poke on the shoulder and a friendly smile or a high-five ready hand put so high up that I can't reach it.. But lately I feel like he's been avoiding me? He avoids my gaze in the halls and replies to my messages briefly and coldly. Even yesterday, when I was in the halls, I practically RAN into him and I could tell he was avoiding my gaze and all I got was a "Hey Kim" and then sulked off through the halls too quickly for me to reply back. Super unusual. We've never fought much, and especially not recently. I'm not sure what's going on with him? Does anyone have any (vague) ideas?

20081102211326AAp07dm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Wow, This is VERY VERY Awkward and Confusing... ?	Some initial facts - We are both 21 and juniors in college      The question - Last year this girl and I dated from October of 2007 till May of this year.... things were really serious ie. meeting families, giving of a promise ring, things of that nature.... basically it was like we were married. For the summer she went to New York for an internship and we ended up breaking up in June because she said I was being to overbearing etc.... we still talked over the summer but everyday she seemed to hate me more and more and I had no idea why. She would say things like the never wanted to see me again and that she never wanted to get back together etc. So we get back to school in August and we tried to hang out but she would get so angry and act like I ruined her life so I left her alone and moved on ... We do have 3 classes together this semester and we see each other every few days... but since August we had not talked to each other, we did not sit together .. there has been no acknowledgment or anything. I have been with other girls this semester and had completely forgotten about her. However, yesterday she calls me and says that for some reason she has been thinking about me lately and misses me and wants to hang out again etc. and today she texts me today just to say "hi" ... I dont know what to think or why she is doing this, does anyone have any ideas? Its been 2 plus months and we have not even made eye contact

Well I ate a bunch of spicy food like tacos and burritos before going out and well I was sorta poll dancing and then I got a really upset stomach. But I ignored it because my boyfriend was watching and was having a good time. Well everyone in the club was watching me and I couldn't take it anymore and I accidentally sharted all over the pole and my boyfriend and his friends. I ran out so fast and I haven't called him yet. He didn't call me either. What do I do? I'm mortified.      I was wearing a mini-skirt so it was extremely messy.

There have been 2 times in the past during a very heated argument when I wanted to go somewhere or exert some independence, 1st time was about school, I forgot the 2nd time, that what my hubby said and did hurt me beyond belief. Both times he got angry, shoved our marriage license in my face and yelled, see this, it means i f'ing own you, b*tch! you will f'ing obey me! Right afterwards both times he immediately dropped it, grabbed his keys and went to a buddies house for the night, and came back the next day and apologized and bought me teddy bears and said, let's forget it ever happened. I've tried to forget, I truly have, but I just can't, and even now it keeps replaying in my head. I hate feeling petty about things, and I do about this.

One day my class was leaving and he was walking in with his friends he looked at me and said "i want to, but i can never see her face" Summer school ended. then i heard he got back with his x-girlfriend.   It was fall the school year had begun, my friends said everytime we passed him he would stare at me( lol even over his girlfriends head, which broke up) I would see him around in school like always. i then forgot about him.

Febuary 1st to be exact (ha. ima nerd. lol) i was just sitting in homeroom when i look outside the door for no apprent reason i just see a girl in my class, and a guy that looks like cute guy. then a second later i relize its him. i look at him hes talking to the girl in my class and just looking at me. 5 minutes later she comes in and shes like "ey you know (name with held) said he wants me to say hi to you for him. He said hes always been trying to say hi and getting to know you, but he said he seem kind of shy, then he was just asking questions about you" i just laugh and call him a lozer. i saw him all the time all the sudden. Wendesday this guy that sits behind me in algrebras like " you know _____" and i said yea " well, he wants me to put a word in for you" i laughed and said wow he such a lozer and he laughs "he's like yea he pointed you out asking if i knew you in stuff and im like yea" the next day hes like so have u've guys talked yet, i said kno and if he really wants to meet me he can get his a$$ to come talk to me. So he did, im walking with my friend to my locker laughing about cute guy, then who do i see, cute guy. We laugh we start to pass and cute guys just like "hey" im like hello. he says "wutz up" we start to talk and he's like i like your shirt, then starts to like examine my locker. then i ment to hang my bag on my locker but i was nervous and dropped it, me and my friend just start cracking up. he just looks at us and is like your dropped that and picks it up. He then says ' your hairs so shiny", touches it and is like "OMG! its so freakin soft as hell" lol he walks me to were i was going and says bye and gives me a hug. The next day i see him going to homeroom and he's just like "hey, and smiles" after algerbra he was already outside my class he walks me to my locker. He asked for my numer i said "we'll see" he's like your bogus were walking and just talking and he looks at my folder which has like little wierd owl things. lol we point out out favorites. he asked me stuff like my fav music n stuff too. were at my locker and then he goes to the library to "tutor" me. we open my book and hes trying to help me. we go through two problems, i start to get it. i look away for like 2 seconds and i look back and theres like a tic- tac- toe set up. he does this trick, but he still me win. i turn away again and there a hang- man game set up. i took one look, i knew what it said.

20090227172025AAu4plD	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Is it okay to renew vows for 5th anniversary? or would people find that weird/too early?	so basically, and i know its terrible to say, i really didnt like my wedding. just about everything ended up wrong. i ended up pregnant so we had to move our wedding date a lot sooner (i had already bought my dress and needed to fit into it). so i was 4mos pregnant and 8lbs heavier. i had an allergic reaction to face cream i used the night before so my face was puffy/blotchy. my hair and makeup came out terrible as did my veil someone made for me, the food was not good, i was sick all day, the pictures are completely terrible (we never even ordered one single print they were so bad. coloring was way off, blury, almost none with the wedding party). we had to invite so many distant relatives we werent able to invite any of our friends.      so anyway you get the point.  i really want to renew our vows so i can have the day i always dreamed of having and look beautiful, have lots of pics with everyone, invite just close family and friends, have good food, etc.  our 5th anniversary is coming up and i would love to having a "wedding re-do" lol. we dont want people to bring gifts or anything, just to do it the way we wanted (only scaled back obviously).  i'm afraid though that people will think its ridiculous since its just our 5th anniversary (we have been together for 8yrs though). but i dont know if i want to wait til our 10th because i want to do it while we are still younger haha. and our kids are 4 and 2 so they could be ring bearer/flower girl which would be so neat.  does it seem odd to do this for our 5th?
20090227172149AAux9q3	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I'm dating someone and my mother doesn't agree with the relationship. Should I continue to see him?	I need to clarify why my mother disagrees. The man I'm going out with is much older than me. I'm 19 and he's 39, although the age difference is big but I honestly see the two of us in a long term relationship. Marriage, family the whole nine yards. And I know that I'm not just some delusional teenager falling for the wiles of an older man. This relationship has substance. It's not just about sex as my mom thinks.         She feels that he is just using me for sex and just wants a thrill. But his type of man is very hard to find, not only in my age bracket but in general. He's sweet, caring, considerate, affectionate and forgiving. He loves me for me. My flaws and my (imagined) imperfections. He feels that I'm gorgeous the way I am, no surgery, no weight loss/gain. He loves me. My mother doesn't see any of that. All she thinks is that I'm being used for *** and cheap thrills. But our relationship is so much deeper than that.        Yes, our age gap is big, but we find something in each other that we don't see in anyone else. I love my mother and respect her guidance and her worries about me, but I feel that I sincerely love this man. How can I go about making my mom more at ease with the situation? I'd like nice sensible advice please.

20090227175854AAp33d9	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Question for victims of sexual abuse?	When did you realize you had actually suffered abuse?  Did it just dawn on you one day and memories came flooding back, or did you just know?  I know sometimes the abuse is obvious, but for me I had no idea that what had happened to be was abuse until I turned 11 or 12 years old.      How did you get past it (or have you)?  I'm going to counseling and am in a support group that meets weekly, but I'm still having a hard time coming to terms with it and the flood of emotions that come with it.

20090227180249AAIGwP6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls dont seem to notice me... help?	Now, i posted a similar question yesterday, and got answers, but not exactly what i expected. Now, im a dude who is social, likes to talk about life, and stuff like that. A lot of girls though say that im nothing but a selfish bastard. Of course i dont mean all of them, but some of them do. I also dont see any girls noticing me. I mean, 14 years turning 15 soon, never had a gf. My confidence has nothing to do with it, ok? I dont need a psychology lesson. I just simply dont get it. I also get teased a lot because im too tall 6'1 for my age, im not a Jock or Prep, Ugly, considered a loser by many (im not saying it against myself, just speaking the truth or in other words - repeating their words. Yet again, it has nothing to do with my confidence. Honestly) and never had been in a serious relationship before. I do realize that i might act stupid sometimes, i admit that. But what can i do to get their attention? You know, i cant just  come up to them and say "Hey, lets talk" and stuff like that.  Is it me? Do i just think that? Do i need to change something in me or what? Thanks in Advance
20090227174206AAmmAtr	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	A good way to reject a guy?	If someone you don't like as a date/boyfriend, but like as in as a general person, how do you reject him? i don't think that made much sense, but just wondering how you would tell someone, "no" in a nice way after they'd asked you out on a date?   thanks :] this is a sad question, but i dont want to flat out say no...unless that is a good way?   haha...im confused thanx
20090227180359AA8G1qc	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Gift Registry?  Wait till they ask?	Do you just tell people where you are registered or do you just wait until they ask?  Someone said to put it on the invitation, wouldn't that be rude?         We are going to register online, its like an all in one registry that you can list whatever store you want.  But it wouldn't be through the store itself.    How would we go about telling people, through an e-mail?
20090227175916AAqWfqI	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Husband promises but doesn't fulfill...?	My husband drives truck and is out for 2-3 weeks, maybe more. He has promised me that he would be coming home this weekend so we could go to the Strawberry Festival together (we live in FL... we've never been to this festival). I was almost buying the ticket when he sends me a text message saying he would not be coming home. He said his dispatch sent him back to Michigan. He keeps saying that he wants to find another job, blah blah blah... which, I know, it's hard because of the economy, etc. But I am not asking him to quit his job. I wish he would keep his promises with me. Many drivers are re-routed and do not get to go home when they want, but later they wind up getting other benefits (more days off, or bonuses, etc), to compensate for not being home the requested days. My husband never gets anything. They play him like they want, and he just bows to them, and tells me all these promises and doesn't fulfill. I get really tired of being alone on the weekends (I work weekdays). Sometimes it's good to be alone, but after being told that you will have company, you build your castle around that, and when the dream is over, it's hard. I really think he doesn't want to come home, I think he doesn't/never really loved me. We don't have any kids, in our mid 30s. I am trying to live my life independent of him. When he comes home, he stays maybe for a day, maybe 2. His job calls and wants him back, and he doesn't object. Even though for every week he works he gets a day off, he winds up working 3 weeks and only having one full day off, which he sleeps all day and watches tv or plays video games. I feel like I'm a decorative object in the house to suit his needs. I feel awful... What can I think? What can I do? I'm hopeless...Thanks....

20070418012934AA8Yh4s	Family & Relationships;Friends	Nos robaron anoche....!!!!?	Ayer vinieron a casa dos grupos de personas.   Los que vivirán en el apartamento de abajo, tres jovencitos amigos de mis hijos (solo vinieron 2 ayer) de 15 y 23 a?os y un grupo de 4 personas, hombres los 4, el padre y los tres hijos, a colocar el techo de la casa, manto asfáltico, etc.   No terminaron el trabajo, por lo que me desperté a las 3 am mojándome con la lluvia que caía directamente encima de nosotros.    Al  levantarnos notamos el robo, el laptop de mi marido y tres carteras que yo tenía tras la puerta. La puerta principal estaba cerrada pero sin llave y encontramos arriba un cuchillo.   La casa es bien vulnerable, porque tiene un muro de 100 metros y se puede subir a la planta alta por los diferentes niveles de techos. Por unos minutos presté las llaves a uno de los trabajadores. El resto del tiempo, las llaves las tuvo el jovencito mayor del grupo de amigos de mi hijo.   No tocaron mas nada, laptop y carteras, celulares.      QUIEN PIENSAN  QUE NOS ROBó...???
20090227180602AA18sZw	Family & Relationships;Friends	My friend is jealous of my talking to her friend?	One of my friend's friends sent me a friend request over Myspace. My friend advised me not to talk to her, but she wouldn't give me a straight reason. But I still added her friend anyways. So we'd been talking for a few days over IM and she tells our friend that we've been talking. My friend got mad at both of us. When I tried to talk to her the next day she said that it was fine, but I knew that it was just the way people say it, and she was giving me a "How could you?" look. But she still won't tell me why she wouldn't like me talking to her friend. She just says that she's territorial. Do you think that there's actually a secret motive?

20070401212231AA13Ysb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Una verdad sobre el amor ...?	En la vida, el amor es la base principal en la relación de pareja ya que comparten sus sentimientos entre ambos. Sin embargo, a veces amar a alguien se vuelve díficil ya que tenemos miedo a que dicha persona que nos gusta no sienta lo mismo por uno y nos quedamos con la incertidumbre que hubiera pasado si le hubiera dicho lo que sentia por ella o talvez ella no sea la persona indicada. Existen ocasiones en que las mujeres no se declaran a los hombres porque luego uno piensa mal de ellas o por la sociedad. Algunas esperan que su principe azul les de una se?al para llamar su atención de ella. Otras tienen miedo de que esa persona no sea la persona indicada para ellas. A veces las personas tenemos miedo de quedarnos solos y no poder amar a alguien de verdad. Hay que tratar de vencer nuestro miedos y tratar de agarrar valor para poder decir a la persona lo que uno siente. Todo es cuestión de voluntad y si te pones a pensar bien talvez tu pareja se encuentra a tu alrededor ...
20070614073808AAvhcXK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please help?	I know a guy that has many good friends that are girls. He pays a lot of attention to me whenever I see him, but recently he asked another girl out. She said no, but I don't understand why he asked her out and not me. One time when I see him, he'll flirt with me. The next time I see him, he'll treat me like his best friend. I don't know why he does that if he likes another girl. Like I said, he has a lot of close friends that are girls. Why do boys do that? I can't tell if he likes me or not cause I'm getting mixed messages.

I thought he really liked me but I found out he really liked this other girl. he's been really flirty since the beginning of the school year but now he's been rather cold and he never shows any affection anymore. the truth is, I kinda miss it but i don't want it to seem like i like him esp since lots of girls hang all over him ALL the time. should i be flirty? cold in return? neutral? polite? and what's wrong w/ him?!

Okay, so there's this guy I've liked for basically ever since I've remembered,and he's also my best friend. I hang out with him all the time, but never really came to ask him out. Last night, t was about 9:00pm, and I was just sitting around. He called and asked me to come over, when I got there, we went to his room. I thought he might do somthing romantic, (it just seemed like that sort of moment) and then just when I thought he might say somthing really nice, he told me he was gay and just came out of the closet. I'm happy that he's fine with who he is, but not sure what to say or do. The whole time he was excited for coming out, I just stood there shell shocked, and didn't know what to say. What should I do?

Her dad is very strict and doesn't let her out unless she calls him every place she goes. So he said he'd pick her up at 3. They are in 7th grade (13 years old). My parents were going to pick me up around the same time too. He came earlier and she said goodbye and left my daughter standing in a busy parking lot. When I came I just see my daughter by herself with a bunch of high school kids near her smoking. How .. DISRESPECTFUL is that. I am very annoyed. I came at 3 it's not like I was late. I would of waited for anyones child even if they're parents came late. Thats just what you do.

20090227180606AA6IzS6	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Serious dilemma. I need some advice?	So as some of you know I am mad because my boyfriend looks at porn and then deleted a kinky picture of my *****.  He now texted me and said that do whatever I want-he doesn't give a crap. Yes, it was a text fight. Told me if I want to just leave.  I supported him when he wasn't working.  Now I am in the predicament. He is just being a jerk.      I have two guys coming after me.  One has been a friend for years, the other for almost a year.  One told me I could move in with him.  I like both these men but I feel like I would be using them.      I won't cheat.      It gets worse, before I was laid off I got a DUI.  In Arizona with Joe Are-Pot-Hole you have to go into jail.  I have no idea how long I will be in there.  This case has been going on for more then a year.  I have been laid off for 1 week.  When he was it was for 2 months and all he did was play video games and look at porn.      Its really complicated.  Should I get out or should I ride him like he did me?  Should I turn to one of these guys, which ever one I pick.

20090227180540AAFPrIl	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Colorado state common law marriage?	I want to make sure I'm right, so I'm looking for confirmation.   According to Colorado the credentials for common law marriage are:   You have to be cohabiting (living together)   You and your "spouse" file for taxes and insurance jointly   You have to have joint bank accounts   3rd party members know you and your boyfriend/girlfriend are together   And you anticipate on getting married   The woman uses the mans surname.      So... my boyfriend and I have lived together for over a year now   We don't need to file for taxes this year, but I'm currently pregnant with his baby, so next year we're filing for taxes together   He's a joint member on ALL my bank accounts   I already planned on getting him on medicaid under my name.   Everyone knows we're a couple   A collection agency calls for him on my cell phone asking about "my husband"   We do plan on getting married this May, but we don't have the money.   We're living with his parents too. And we filed for WIC together.   But I still use my maiden last name.   That's the only thing we haven't already done.

Every time they see each other they have to go somewhere where no one who knows them will see them.  In short, they have to hide.  Now, the guy moved out of State, my friend helped him with everything financially and all. Now, he is telling my friend that he met someone and that they have the blessings of his new girlfriend's Mom to get married but he still wants to continue seeing my friend. That he wants to keep them both.  Because he says he doesn't want to lose my friend.  I told my friend that he only doesn't want to lose her because he is just after her money.  My friend has been helping him, giving him money ever since she had a relationship with him.  I told her that he is only using her emotionally, physically and financially. Do I need to mention that he ask her to have an abortion when my friend was pregnant?  I am so furious with the way she is letting him treat her that I told her all this. Was what I have done wrong?

20090227173858AAt8Z2z	Family & Relationships;Family	Could he be my father, details?	My mom was murdered by my father thirteen years ago, and until a couple weeks ago, I did not know that she ever cheated on my dad. I met the man she cheated on my dad with a couple weeks ago, he is a highschool substitute teacher. He was looking at me a little different, and at the end of class, he asked me what my mothers name is. I told him what her first name was, and right after, he said he full name. He did not know that she had been murdered. The thing that I noticed about him, was that we had the exact same eyes. Both our eyes are green around the edge, then blue, and tints of yellow around the pupil. I look identical to my mom though, other than that. The other thing is, is that my mom got pregnant with me, when she was cheating with him. I am wondering a lot, if the man she cheated with is my father, and not the one who murdered my mom. I look nothing like my "birthfather", I have the EXACT same eyes as the man she cheated with, other than that, I am identical to my mom.

Her and I like each other very much and have had alot of romantic times together, even just last week... but shes feeling herself doing it again. She said that a few months back she realized she was the problem... that it wasnt that she was meeting the wrong people it was just, but that she had a problem and didnt know how to fix it. She knows I care about her very much... Id do anything for her and its clear that I have strong feelings for her... she also admits to having very strong feelings for me. I want her to know Im there for her and I still want to see where our relationship will go. She said she hopes im the one that can break her out of this funk, but feels like its not fair to me with the hot and cold treatment she gives.      I dont mind the hot/cold... Im used to it, i've learned to embrace the fluctuations and have accepted it as a part of who she is and I love it.       Alot of the aforementioned information came to light in a conversation I had with her last night when she said she wanted to explain why she had been acting weird... said she had been really busy and stressed and burnt out, but also addressed the things I listed above.      I want to see her and dont want to pressure her. How do I help her get over her problem? I want her to get used to the idea of being with me... and I feel like at the beginning of a relationship she shouldnt feel obligated to give me 100% of her attention and that I'm happy with the attention I get when I get it... I think we'll grow together and eventually dedicate more time to one another. How do I help my friend and, in turn, help our relationship move forward and hopefully turn into something great?

20090227173948AA0YR6X	Family & Relationships;Family	Should we say this to our parents?	If one of our parents does something really bad and the person he or she wronged says your parent is a bad character, a rogue or something like that, should we tell our parent we agree with that person and he or she really acted like that? Or should we say we think our parent is wrong but without offending him or her? What's the right thing to do in this situation?

20090227174017AAu5kge	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Why does my mom think I'm a bad kid?	My mom seriously thinks im a bad kid. Im 13 im in 8th grade, i dont have a myspace or a facebook. I dont do drugs and i dont smoke. I have good friends, and i get good grades. But for some reason she thinks i am like the spawn of the devil. I have a laptop and i am on aim alot. But im not doing anything bad. She comes over to me randomly and wants to read my conversations with my friends, and some of them i dont want her to read because they may be about boys or conversations with boys or anything else that 13 year olds talk about. I got a digital camera for christmas and like she never lets me use it because she thinks i am taking "naughty" pictures of myself and putting them on the internet. I mean what am i doing wrong. She thinks im on drugs and sexually active and im not and when i say im not she doesnt believe me. How can i convince her im not a bad kid...   Heres a picture of me, just incase it helps. do i look like a bad kid?    http://s304.photobucket.com/albums/nn187...

(2008) and im still talking to him now.. thing is.. he lives in ireland.. and i live in england... there is no way of us possibly ever meeting... but the thing is i feel so close to him for some reason.. i just want to be the girl in his arms.. when i hardly know him.... do you guys think this is weird.. or?   i feel so strongly about him and always wish i was with him... sometimes more than my real boyfriend.. do you think telling this guy in ireland how i feel is a good idea or... do you think it might freak him out that i feel so strongly about him... anyway thanks.
20090227174238AADNg5H	Family & Relationships;Friends	I am a female who hates other females, is that wrong?	I don't like females at all, not even little girls, or baby girls. They all make me cringe. I think that girls are very weak, mentally, physically, and emotionally. I think that it's not fair how girls treat boys, they treat them horrible, and most girls are never faithful to their men. I also think that men have it a lot more harder than women in like. Menstruation doesn't hurt, and it's not an inconvenience, and childbirth is very simple and painless, look at all of the drugs we have now! Even without drugs, it's NOT that bad, women are just weaklings about it is all. I think that females are very ignorant and males surpass them in everything. I do believe that women should be in the kitchen because they're SO weak. Has no one heard the saying "You hit like a girl ""You throw like a girl " or "you're such a girl"well, it's all true!

20090227174855AAVq7b0	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Why am I acting this way? I need help.?	i have this problem. I've been with my boyfriend for 3yrs and i love him very much. I live with him and we have 3 lil cats i love so much. I met him in highschool. and wen were in highschool he put me through a lot. he flirted a lot with other girls, he tried getting with one or 2. There was a time he broke up with me a week later he started dating a girl 4 a month. And i cried my *** out. That was the worst feeling i ever felt in my life. I was so depressed. It was really hard for me. I forgave him for everything but I didnt forget it. and until this day it hurts me when i think about it. everytime we mention highschool i get flashbacks to those horrible days. We go through our problems now but for some reason wat happened in highschool  still stays with me. I've always had a low self esteem because I'm very skinny. And where I'm from, girls with thick bodies are the ****. I'm just scared he's gonna leave me. But there are times..he kisses me and tells me I'm beautiful. And he says he doesnt like thick girls..he like skinny girls like me or whatever..but he looks at girls....is that normal?? do guys look at other girls even if they have a girl at home? am i being stupid??? is it because i dont have a father and im insecure..??? but plz dont judge me..im just looking for closure. What you think i should do.

20090227175448AAEhaIy	Family & Relationships;Friends	Help me with my friend?	Okay, so, my best friend and I are growing apart. I don't know what to do. Ever since she's had a boyfriend, he has been number one. She is always with him. Always. I don't feel like I am her best friend anymore. And whenever I ask her if she has any plans, she always avoids telling me what they are if she's hanging out with him. If she is hanging out with him, who cares?! It's like she thinks I'll be jealous or something. It's just irritating. We've gotten into some fights, which is rare, and now I'm not nearly as close to her. :( We've been hanging out more lately, but sometimes, like today, the way she acts drives me insane. HELP!
20090227175504AAyQ7kB	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What is your opinion on his behavior?	I was gone to my moms for a week while she had surgery.  I flew out on the 14th and when I returned the 21st I found these text messages in my husbands phone.  Starting on the 17th he would call her and she would call him all day, she texted him things like "so its a no to doing it on camera" and "we will still have to do it because I know you still want to feel my mouth" and texting back and forth in the mornings to see how eachother slept and he texted her asking if she wanted to go to diner.  When I confronted him he says he met her the 18th at pool league and she said she was good at pool so they exchanged numbers so they could play sometime.  I know that is a lie because the correspondence started the 17th.  He says he doesnt know her name and when I called her number the woman who answered said she had lost her phone and 'just' found it and never even met my husband and never leaves her house because she doesnt have a baby sitter.......  He wont tell me the truth and doesn't see anything wrong with a married man talking like that with some other woman.  I know he is very outgoing but cant see this as innocent just to play pool aquaintances.

20090227180930AAWHhqb	Family & Relationships;Family	Do you think it's fair how my parents are taking this situation?	Sorry for how long this is it was basically what ever came to mind.       Ok, so in school we are going on a two week trip to Canada. We are supposed to follow all these requirements, and if we don't we end up on a contract. Well I ended up on a minor contract meaning I didn't have to have parent meeting, and I'm still not quite sure why I'm on it, since I keep up on my work and never get in trouble. My mom found out about that and freaked out and now is taking away all my stuff, like my computer, TV, going to try to take away my i Pod, and anything else she thinks will be a "distraction". The part she doesn't get is that there is a very very very high chance that I'm ADHD(which neither of my parents believe) and so I can never focus and I have problems just getting my assignments in the day that they are supposed to, since I'll either lose my paper or forget it at home. So she finds out starts yelling at me, is going to take everything away, make me sit at home all day, and expect me to still like her, I don't even know what my dad will do. They like to freak out on the simplest things, and piss me off in the process. They are set on me being what they want me to be, and how it was for them to live there child hood. They don't take in to consideration of my feelings and what I want to do, and they don't at all know how it is to live in the world today as a teenager. On the ride home today she started yelling at me and I just tried to stay silent but I am also extremely compulsive and so as hard as I tried to not start screaming at her I failed, and just started crying and yelling at her. When she found out by accident about my BF all she did was mock me and make stupid coments. Oh another thing she does alot; mock me, I can try to be serious and she'll just start trying to be funny. Neither of my parents have seen how I really act, they've just seen how I act around them. Or the couple times I lost my act and started to act like myself she started yelling at me, and then I got in a ton of trouble. I'm just so sick and I don't know what to do, I don't think how they treat me is fair either.       How they treat me:   Mock   Yell   Take away stuff   Act like I'm not there   And much much more

When I went to some of those sites it say's at the bottom that they're all legal, yet some of them look around 10 and when u keep clicking you get to little little kids. and whats worse about it is Mcafee shows the sites as safe. I don't think child porn is safe, do you? How do I get Mcafee's attention to get these sites blocked? I posted this in a different section a few mins ago but no one responded. I wouldn't mind if these girls just looked young, but some of these girls looked around age 5?

20090225072650AAgG1RO	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why is my best friend doing this? Or am I just being to sensitive?	Well for a brief backround we've been friends since 2nd grade and are juniors now. And shes pretty much always been the outgoing one, and I'm kind of shy. I've had a couple guys into me here and there, but she always has guys drolling over her. which doesn't bother me at all, she has fun with it so I'm happy for her. But it is kinda nice to hear when a guy is into me....so heres what happened.    Her boyfriend was walking with his friend and usually pass her boyfriend on the way to my physics class. Well I guess his friend was with him one day and took notice to me. Because my friend (katie) came up to me the next day and said she knew someone who liked me. She then told me me the story, jeff (her bf) and this new friend of his (james) were walking and i guess as i walked by james told jeff "wow did you see the girl with the curly blonde hair?" and jeff pointed to me and said "yeah thats april" and then james said "wow she gorgeous" and he started asking about me.    So I was pretty flattered and considered trying to make conversation with this boy sometime, and he smiled at me yesterday.    back to my friend katie....well she suddenly started talking to james. And she keeps telling me stories like how she was playing with his hair...or he winked at her, stuff like that. Then she always goes "but has anything happened with you two yet?"    Lol i'm like ...what.....its just kinda of mean I think. And its not like she even noticed this guy before....and she already has so many!    I don't really know if I can say anything about it either....without sounding....I don't know how to explain it. Its not like were even dating but I just don't see why she has to go out of her way to do that.    How should I handle this.....   I'm not even saying I really want to date this guy, its more about why shes doing this when I could want to date him.    Thanks :-/
20090225071928AAjDeZV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I get him out of my mind and stop thinking about him?	I keep thinking about this guy that I used to be in love with. We were sleeping together but then I stopped when I found out he had a girlfriend, which hurt really bad. So then we don't see each other for two years (with the exception of talking once every now and then) and then he starts going to my college. So he's kinda back in my life, but not really. We slept together one time before school started but then I told him that I couldn't do that anymore. He was cool with that and he still calls. But its like...I don't want to start having strong feelings for him anymore. I don't want to be on that emotional rollercoaster. How can I stop thinking about him? Especially, if I'm not really seeing anyone right now? I try to get out there and meet new ppl but its not easy, especially when all the guys that talk to me aren't what I want or need. How can I get over this loser? I know it'll never go anywhere and I just can't trust him...its a dead end relationship. For sure I don't call him, but when he calls me I mostly pick up the phone. How can I fully drop him?

20090225072753AAsemYf	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Can I get some experienced advice on my situation please?	My Ex and I are best friends. We dated for 8 months, but she called it off about 4 months ago. She said she didn't want a serious relationship. Though I was trying to get back together with her, she made it clear she only wants to be friends. We got in a big fight recently, she said mean thing to me, but I said some stupid stuff too, and in my anger, they really hurt her feelings. I didn't mean any of it but, I know what i did was wrong. But I apologized, and will do what I can to make up for it. For now she is still mad, I think she just needs space and time to let go of her anger for me. When she's calmed down, I will apologize again, and ask her what we can both do to maintain a happy, healthy, trusting friendship, and learn from the experience. To me it doesn't matter which of us is at fault, as long as we know we did wrong, and are willing to both do better in the future, and be honest with each other and communicate. I still love her very much, but she has made it clear that she just wants to be friends, so I will stop trying to date her. I respect her wishes, I don't want to become a creepy stalker. But, I'm just asking is that a good mentality? I may not be able to date her, but I do love her very much, and she is the most valuable friend I have, And I will always be there for her, and Love her. I know living like thats not easy, but with time, I think we can get a better understanding of things. I wont chase her, she doesn't want a romantic relationship. She wants to be just friends, and move on from what happened, so thats what I'll do. But I want to stay her friend. The best way to fix that I think, is to give each other alittle space for now, so we cool off. Then apologize for it, and work hard in the future to not repeat our mistakes. I  just want to know if I have the right idea? your advice please.

20090225071503AADEvZF	Family & Relationships;Friends	My girlfriend on the side is getting serious?	She's starting to get frustrated with the situation because she keeps talking about leaving me alone. She know I have a gf but I told her even though I live with someone I'm still single. My gf calls alot when we are together and it ruins our time.       My gf on the side is saying that she needs to get a man of her own, that she's tired of the booty call thing and she's tired of living alone. I've told her that I was going to leave my gf soon and move in with a friend. I told her it was ok if she decided to have a dip if she wants to feel the time that I can't be there, she no that's not what she wants. I'm afraid I'm going to call her one day and she's going to tell me I can't come over anymore because she's moved someone else in. Is she crazy? Or is she trying to send me hints about something? Is she thinking that maybe I'll dump my gf to be with her or something? But she seems unhappy and claims that she cries herself to sleep at night because she's tired of being alone.

20090225072625AAQcK0e	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Was this a rebound relationship?	My friend dated a man for nearly a year...he was in the process of a divorce.  This guy had been seperated from his wife for nearly 2 years but he was reluctant to get a divorce due to financial reasons.      My friend, holds high moral and ethical standards.   This man was active in his church, his community, and was very devoted to his children....all were admirable traits.      They started a friendship at first and things went well.   My friend had to take several stands with this man.   The first one she stated that if he didn't file for divorce by a certain date she would have to leave as she was not into dating married men.   4 days prior to that date...he filed.   Things went well for a bit...then he said something very nasty.   She went out with him on Valentine's Day and she spoke to him about setting some boundaries with his stbx...as she was coming over to his house to hang out with the 16 year old.   My friend was not comfortable with the hanging out situation.   So she talked about boundaries with her man.   He didn't see anything wrong with it and when she pushed the issue...he retorted with - I am not married to you nor engaged to you...it is my house I will do whatever the hell I want.   This of course devastated her....as she put it...it took every ounce of grace in her not to throw her glass of water in his face as they were dining out that evening.   She behaved like a lady but was hurt.  She started to cry in her car and he did nothing to come over and see if she was ok...he just left her there.   ( JERK)      A week after that incident he wants her to move her stuff into his house....I told her bad move.  He isn't even divorced and made it clear he isn't married nor engaged to you.   She did the smart thing and did not move her stuff in      He was never available for dates like in the beginning.  He just slowly started making up reasons not to be with her.   He stood her up a couple of times.   When she asked about spending more quality time together...he wanted to break up.   I couldn't believe what I was hearing?   He showed her a house that I think he wanted her to buy...but she didn't go for it and it just seemed after she rejected the idea of buying a house he started treating her badly as if to get her to leave without guilt.      He stopped doing nice things for her and started really acting crappy to her.   He would text people during their dates, never cared to be with her if at all except for his physical needs, he let women come on to him...yet if a man hugged her at church she was sending wrong signals.      He rarely spent a dime on her...even though she did not care about that.   Her birthday dinner was put on the company credit card as a business transaction.- He didn't even buy her a gift.      He lied to her repeatedly throughout the relationship but put it back on her that she wasn't patient nor loving enough.   When she addressed his divorce getting finalized his answer was when do I have the damb time?   She decided it was best to leave the relationship till he could tie up the loose ends of his pending divorce.      She was patient, loving, and kind to him through the whole break-up then out of no where he sent her an email stating that she blew it and they were over.   She hurt him and he was angry.  He was in a fragile place in his life and got dumped.      He hooked up with another girl who was going through a divorce and remarried her within a year.      Was my friend the rebound?

Has anyone ever had a deep relationship with someone and if failed and you craved to still have a friendship with that person? Also, if you both still want to be friends and the spouse has serious jealousy issues what do you do about it.

20090225072623AAGQQZ1	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How can my estranged hubby say he wants to work it out w/ me, but continue to see someone else?	We've only been separated for 5-6 months, after 2-3 months apart he started seeing this party girl, who goes out drinking and partying every weekend and is like 7 years younger than him.  He says he loves me and wants to make it work, but he 'needs time' b/c "I really hurt him by initiating the separation" He was not blameless in this by the way, and he admits it, but at the same time seems to be enjoying being the wounded party.  I asked him if he never planned on reconciling w/ me at all, point blank, told him to be honest and he quickly said "no no no I''m not saying that at all".  Why would he start seeing someone else so soon afterwards anyways, he was 'devastated' when we separated and then outta nowhere he started seeing this girl that he picked up at the bar one night.

I called her a couple days ago to see if anything was wrong, no answer.. she called be back 5 min later apologized she said the phone was in the other room... then she said nothing was wrong...      During the class she sits in her chair with her legs crossed and 1 arm across her stomach and another hand resting on her thigh closest to me... also something i tried... she had her hand on her thigh right? So i did the same thing.. then i started flicking my fingers up and down... few seconds later she does the same... i stop.. she stopped.. i go... she went... it was sorta fun to do.

20090225104535AARbZFx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you get back on a jealous guy that you never went out with anyway?	OKay, this guy I really liked asked me out. I said NO in a harsh way. (But I said it to his friends fantasizing about me and him) and he took it as a no. Anyway one of my good (VERY) good guy-friends has a crush on me. My good-guy friend got jealous I know because he stomped away angry. So I kicked my guy-friend in the shin hard enough to make him fall. I was upset, he's not my boyfriend he has no right to feel that way about me. I want everything to go back to normal.   Anyway...   I need some revenge ideas. I was thinking of sitting next to that guy I liked and being all over him. Hurting my good-guy friend physicly isn't enough, I need it mentaly. He did the same to this girl he liked. I promised him I'd do the same in any situation. Don't tell me revenge isn't sweet or not to do it. It's more of a test. Don't judge me on this, just give me ideas. Ideas only.

So I was with my friend nd I was cold he asked if I wanted to be in his jacket with his arms held out and I said yes. So he was holding me in his jacket. All of a sudden my Ex bestfriend came up and grabed me away.    "Do you still like me"He said.   "No"I said.   "But you said you loved me before"he said.   "Things change"I said   "But you said you meant it"He said.   "I thought I meant it at the time too"I said.   "But But I love you"He said.   "Your a little too late! You wait a year, when all of my feelings for you have qone away!"I said.   "Oh, well..."He said.   "Yeah and when I said I loved you, you would say I love you AS A FRIEND"I said.   ....... He didn't say anything[At that Time I was crying].   And I was Pissed !    Then the guy I recently liked came up to me from behind and held me.   He looks at me crying then at him and then he asks "Are you alright?"   "I'm fine I'll be over there in a bit okay?"I said.   "Okay"He says and then smiles. Then he wipes my tears and kisses my forehead.   I turn back around to my EX bestfriend and say "Are you done now?"   "Yeah we're done"He said.   "Alright then, bye"and I walk away.   He grabs my arm and says "Wait!"   In my head I'm cussing him out.   But I say"What Now?!"   "So you and 'Him' huh?"   "Its none of your buisness"I reply.   Then I shake off his hand and run to the guy I recently like.   He holds me real tight and wipes the tears away :]      SO WHAT DOES IT MEAN !?

20090225104618AAENLyj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is being a virgin such a problem?	Ok I'm 18 and a virgin by choice. I've been offered sex numerous times and been in positions where things have gotten to that point but I never fully went through with it out of fear of getting the girl pregnant or catching something even though I know how to use a condom. But recently me and my current girlfriend of 7 months had a discussion about sex. I didn't want to tell her I was a virgin because she assumed I wasn't and I thought she would think I'm lame but she told me she's inexperienced and really doesn't know what to do so I just opened up and told her. I told her the reason why I never told her is because every time I tell a girl I'm with that, they never give me a chance because I have no experience. I then asked her if we ever went that far would she give me a chance and she said just what I was afraid of: "I wouldn't know to tell you the truth, as weird as it sounds I don't even like sex but im still a sexual person." That confused me a hell of a lot. How can you be sexual and not like sex. But anyways I feel depressed now because I'm with somebody I love for once and she loves me too and I was hoping she would take my virginity, but it looks like it's not going to happen. Now I regret telling her that I was a virgin and I feel that I blew my chances with her sexually. Is being a virgin really that bad?

20090225074057AAKztM1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is she a potential stalker? - I'm serious.?	I'll try and make this short, I live on my own (well with my dog) and the other evening i had a knock at the door, an 18 year old girl was standing there and asked me if I was (my full name) I said I was and she said that she knew my dad (who lives in the same town) and he thought we might make nice "friends" (relevance, i'm a single lesbian - please no stupid comments) anyway after a couple of minutes of pure awkwardness I invited her in for a cup of tea...and after a few minutes of conversation it was quite clear to me she was not the full ticket, she kept repeating herself saying "I couldn't wait to see you" (never even seen this girl in my life), so that freaked me out a bit, I made some  excuse that I had to go out and she left - hugging me on the way out! Thought nothing more of it, got up the other morning and posted through my letter box was her number and a note saying she'd like to meet up with me. I put the number in the bin, then last night I had my friends 'round and one of them answered the door to her and let her in, she had the front to come in and act like we'd known each other for years, and kept being tactile with me, like touching my arm if she laughed and stuff, it just made my skin crawl, THEN as she was leaving she said "Make sure you do call me because I worry about you!"

20090225072359AA7ofbM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Women: Did this guy deserve what he got?	I recently heard of a case where a man who had a history since adolescence of molesting, raping, and torturing little girls, was the focus of revenge by two sisters, one of whom had a 5 year old daughter who was repeatedly raped and tortured by the man.   In addition to other acts, the women covered his erect wiener with honey or cheese or something, and his wiener was then inserted into a cage containing several rats. The rats then proceeded to slowly eat the man's wiener.   The man later confessed to the crimes, and several other related crimes.      I don't know whether or not this really happened, but if it did, do you think he would deserve such a punishment? Obviously it would be very painful and even humiliating for him.      I simply want to know what other women think. Is this a fitting punishment for a man who raped and tortured several little girls?   Do you feel sympathy for the man, or do you take some satisfaction in how he was punished?

20090225105149AA85WA6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Emotional Boyfriend!? help!?	I Have a bf who is amazing! The only little problem is that he is a bit emotional. Well ALOT emotional. About a month ago i wasn't really wanting to fall into the trend of reading the twilight books. But after a while i decided to change my mind since my friend recommended it actually being a good read. So i bought it and bf flips. He says that i'm gonna turn into one of those girls who's obsessed with one of the main characters, Edward. All the girls love him because he's suppose to be the perfect bf and everything, and he is. And my bf whines to me and actually cried to me over the phone making me feel bad because he says I'm gonna fall 4 him and i don't want to compair to this edward guy. I tell him that i'm not all goo goo over him but he doesn't listen to me. This also happened when i mentioned to my friend at the lunch table that orlando bloom was cute. He got so upset saying stuff like, "You know that if you had a chance to be with him, that you would leave me and be with him." i tell him that's not true and that i love him way more than a fictional character or orlando bloom. But he refuses to listen. When i tell him he's being ridiculous, he gets more upset saying i'm being mean and calling him stupid. I try to be sensitive to his needs but its like i'm walking on eggshells around him.

20070806204133AAOOEmc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I tell?	I know this guy at my work. He has told me he likes me and he has been open and honest with me from day one (3 months ago). He confides in me, jokes with me, makes me laugh, gives me advice. He is very comfortable with me and likewise. however, he has called me once but he never seems to have the initiative to call me.  He writes to me regularly. He never talks to me about work but personal things. He is very vocal when we are alone together. I was a little late to realize that i like him quite a bit! I have never really told him I like him till today when I wrote to him that I am glad he is a part of my life. I can tell he wants to be close to me. I don't know what he has been through. I am in a failing relationship. Please help. Do I see him in my future? Can I hope? I completely melt when I see him. He is handsome, smart, sweet and affectionate.

20090225071710AAGAfFG	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Getting over the pain of being cheated on.?	I recently found out my husband of 16 years cheated on me. He swears nothing sexually happened between them. It never got that far he says. And that it had already ended before I found out. That the relationship lasted about 6 weeks. He swears he sorry and says he never meant to hurt me this why. I have decided to stay with him and try to work things out, but some days I question if its worth it. It is like I have two different people inside me. One that is so angry and wants to throw and hit something and the other that loves him so much. I don't know how to bring the two together to be able to forgive him and trust him again. He has never in the total of 20 years of us being together done anything like this. So, my question is how do I get over the pain to move on?

20090225104858AAryjO2	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do I decide to continue my marriage?	With my husband since 19 years old, he is 6 years older than me. Two children. His job has had him away from the family for than 50% of the time. Over the last 5 years I talked to him alot about my concerns that we were not connected, not friends, were not spending time together.  He does not know how to communicate ( by his own admission ) avoiding stressful conversations, was not very involved with the running of the household or raising the children.  Over the last two years we have moved to a differnet city and the above issues continued to get worse and really take it's toll on me as I had moved away from my support group.  His hobby (fishing) and work continued to take priority and it began to really take it's toll on the children as well. I continued to try and tell him that we needed help and started going to counsolling myself.  He was away for work for a month last fall and when he returned something was different.  I searched through his email ( I had never done that before ) and found out he had an affair with someone that he was a casual friend with before he met me.  He cheated one time with this one person.  Upon discovery of this it was really bad for several months...he did everything he was "not" supposed to do...blame me, continue to hid things, ect.  One day about 2 mths after it happened I said I am not going to try and fix the relationship anymore. This was the first time he apologized.      We are both going to counsolling together and seperate.   He has greatly improved his relationship with the kids and is now very helpful and participates with household stuff.  He says he loves me, he lost his way, he wants to make it work, he thinks it can be better, he would never cheat again, realizes we were disconnected and knows he should have talked to me.      Because we were so disconeted I am having a very difficult time getting past all of the previous years of resentment and bad feellings and his choice to selfishly fulfill his needs by cheating instead of dealing with the issues with me.  His job has training him to not feel and though I do see he is trying, he is not always sharing his feelings with me and would prefer to just move forward and try to make things better.  How many chances to change should someone be given?  How many emotional hurts big and small do I have to swallow in the hopes that one day he will 'get it'   Any advice would be appreciated, after everything that has happened I don't know what is fair to expect

20090225105232AAoJIuN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Relationship problem? Does he still care?	My boyfriend & I have been dating for 11 months going on 12. We're going through a very difficult time & I can not seem to understand. We're currently in a 1 wk fight...longest fight we've been in.       One of the main reasons why we began our fight.   (months ago)He & I cleaned his room. He had a picture of his ex that he did not know was there. So I felt very uncomfortable...therefore he threw it away. Thank god. I was glad he had done that it reassured me he was letting the past go. So now his room is free from the past.    I took a 2wk vacation over seas.    He promised me he would not touch another girl. He would be loyal. We've had problems in the past regarding strip clubs & porn. He said he will TRY not to watch porn & strip club ( I thought he wouldn't go to)   The next day I was gone to Asia first thing he done...went to a strip club. I didn't find out till a few days till I was coming back home. I was very disappointed in him. He didn't ask for forgiveness...But I forgot about it & carried on our relationship.    When I returned home everything was great for 2wks.    I decided on cleaning his closet. SUPPER messy & I could tell he was unhappy...(still jet lagged) I was cleaning his closet at 1-2 a.m. A bag from the right corner came out. Everything fell out of the bag...Pop comes out another picture of his ex & cards she had sent him.  (I didn't confront him till 3days later) I said I felt uncomfortable. HOPING he would through it all away...He had gotten VERY upset said he was over his ex but he wants to keep them cause they are his things. The reason why I was so upset...His room was free from her & how did she end up back in his room!?    I've been trying to let this go...But I do believe that he hasn't.         fight 2: He's been a little touchy. (meaning any little thing I do he gets angry) One of our little out of town fight.    Our day started off like this:   His Mother wanted us to go to la to get a baby ring. Traditional thing. So we had gone to Chinatown to get the gold ring. I'm pretty literate when it comes to gold. I purchase it all the time. His mother wanted a moon ring cause they are Korean. They said that Korean & Chinese baby ring are different. (keep in mind I'm Chinese, Vietnamese, Mexican, & Italian. I some what know.)End up at the store they had the rings but not the moon thing. They said they NEVER heard of it. So we have to go to Korea town ( keep in mind we're travelling back & forth with my parents..I felt so sorry. & sometimes I feel uncomfortable going to ktown. I never knew that some Koreans are very prejudice towards other Asian races.) So we're at koreatown went to the gold store. LMAO...same ****!!! Funny thing was there was NO MOON!!! & ever more ridiculous....they had the same CHINESE characters on the ring. I felt so bad cause it was in my father face cause he had some input.    We get the ring. Then we end up going to the supermarket, electric store & finally last stop pet store!!! :) So I go into the first pet store...I was very nice. Done got out. Second store....Smelt dirty, unkept dogs...I go in I'm looking for a Yorkie so I was just looking. I was having a conversation with my mother about my teacup Yorkie. I had said OMG that one looks like mine...& then my mom said what about this one I said no Its a little larger. The young girl about our age pops in and says **** referring as to me not knowing what I am talking about or not having one. So I got angry & instead of me yelling at her..I waited a few minutes & said Lets go I'm done. He was so angry. I felt like he hasn't really been caring about me & He doesn't protect me. Keep in mind the girl that was there look very similar to his ex! LMAO!       So yes we do have many little problems!    I may have problems as well. So if you believe I do please let me know kindly I would be gladly to accept & do my best to change!       --------------------------------------...      Separate dilemma.       Since my ex & I have been fighting I was very horny. I do have this pretty big toy 9-12'' toy. I used it. My ex was furious when I told him. He said he may not be able to sleep with me till he gets over it....but to me its like get over what its a toy!!! Compared to him going to strip clubs and touching girls boobs & vagina's I don't think mines as bad as his.    I said I would throw it away & no longer use it. So today I'll be throwing it away in front of his face.    But I would like to know Does it even compare the toy to Virtual ( physical touching)    I do feel like he is taking me for-granted & I would like to know how to fix the problem.    p.s. He's not cheating on me...He said he would tell me! That I do believe to a certain extent!       Thank you very much for reading this long blog!!! Any advice, help, or negative things towards me may even help as long as I am able to learn to fix it! Thank you again!!!

I said yes and he smiled and said that that was pretty cool. He told me that he was taking ROTC after class and thought he saw me in the cheerleading squad. I said yea, you probably did.          THEN HE SAYS DO YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND.....      I had said yes but i really didnt want to because i was getting fed up with the lazy slacker i was with already and this guy is really cute and when isay cute all you girls would just drop to floor just at the sight of him.         So what do i do,      do i break up with my old boyfrined and see what this new guy is like or what, I kinda screwed myself already because i said i HAD a boyfreind. wat can i do

20070909221905AAwzczk	Family & Relationships;Friends	?Porque hay "hombres" que despues del coito se levantan de la cama o se acuestan a ver television o dormir en-	vez de abrazar y hacerle cari?itos a su esposa o a su novia?.      Yo siempre trato con cari?o a mi Diosa y mucho mas despues del coito,    la abrazo, la le doy de besitos en la mejilla  le acaricion su cara y la mimo (consiento o achecho).      Pero un dia estaba con mis amigos echandonos unas cervezas y salio el tema de que hacemos despues del coito, y pues cuando me toco el turno de hablar me dijeron lo siguiente: no mames eso es de put0s, despues de sacarsela de la vagina se la deberias dejar ir por dictroi, para eso se hicieron las mujeres y pues tu novia tiene unas nalguitas que hasta te va a deslechar con unos sentones.   Nomas termino de hablar no conte ni hasta 5 para darle uan golpiza como la que jamas le dieron,   los demas se quisieron meter a agarrarme para que me golpeara el otro wey pero de suerte mi hermano llego en ese momento con unos primos y pues le rompieron su mandarina en gajos a los otros.      Desde esa ocasion no me hablo con ninguno de ellos.      ?Ustesdes que opinan?.
