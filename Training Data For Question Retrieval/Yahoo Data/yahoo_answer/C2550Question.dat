20090219170013AAozhNq	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	A good first car for a 16 year old?	I'm sixteen, I have a job, I have little money, and I need a car, because my job requires it, and just to have a car for daily uses. I saw a 1999 cavalier for about a grand, a 2005 cobalt ss for 5 grand, or a 1992 corolla for about 800$. I like the cavalier because its reliable, doesnt have much mileage, and has looks, but doesnt seat many people, i like the cobalt because it has no miles, seats 5, a bit uncomfortabally, but still does, has looks, but still has some speed so I dont seem like a total loser, and I like the corolla because ive always liked the car, has good mileage, seats 4, can be fixed easy, and is cheapest. Please help, im stuck! Oh, and my budget is 5,500$. If you have any suggestions, I would love to know some. Thank you

I'm very attached to it - nothing serious has ever gone wrong - it's like my lucky charm. I love the color, it has a ten-disk CD player, gets great gas mileage, is very comfortable, etc. My only complaint is that it has no air conditioning, which can be almost unbearable during the summer.       My parents are trying to be proactive, as they are afraid that considering the age of my car, something can and will go wrong, plus it is a very small car with no airbags. They found a really great deal on an '06 Nissan and would like to buy it for me. It's a special edition, also gets great gas mileage, etc. It's not quite as comfortable as my car and it's not the greatest color, but not terrible either.       I don't know what to do and I need to make a decision now. I love my little car and would hate to part with it. So undecided.

Hi,      I have a Maryland driver's license and I recently got 2 violation tickets.      one was a speed ticket and the other one was for not putting the seat belt on for my 3 year old daughter.          So, back to the main point      I heard that the Maryland doesn't charge me for the child seat-belt violation. And the penalty for the speed in Maryland is less than that of New York.      So, I wanted to know if I have to follow the New York State rules for these violations or I can follow the ones of Maryland, since I have the Maryland license.         And It would be really convenient to know where I can find the informations about the driving violatons.

My familly needed a car about 5 months ago but they dont have good credit. We had to put the car under my name because luckily, i found a dealer that finance college students. Two weeks later, i needed to buy my own car. i went to a dealership and they agreed to sell me a 2008 dodge charger for $18000-3800 for my monte carlo trade -$1500 down payment. Now it s been 4 months already, they are still giving me temporary paper tags.They say that they can t get me financed through any bank. i told them clearly that i just purchased a car for my people under my name.Why did they let me drive off with the car??? I ask them for my trade back but they already sold it. one of the mangers said that he was going to help me by awarding me more money for my trade but when i went to see him, the CEO of the company fired him and a couple more employees that was selling people cars even though they are not too sure about the deal just in their own benefits. (this is a complete mess))) even the finace guy at the dealer can t beleive it. can i take a lawyer for my this case.I want to get an attorney , what do you think? because i want my trade back, they can't even track it cause they sold it through wholesale. I was just at the dealership today and the finance guy told me that he s still tring to get me approve..When i told him that im going to take a lawyer, he went to go get on of the managers to talk to me. the manager told me that he found a bank for me which i don t beleive...he told me that if i can t sign the contract to finance $13665, i can t drive the charger back home? why would you sell my trade for Mr manager? he told me that he wasn t hired when that happened. i remember a month a go, the fince guy gave me a buyers order for 10,000 to see if i can get a bank to approve me on my own but it didn t work...can i still use this buyers order in my advantage to get a better deal just in cause he got me apporoved for $13665 for real?       Please help me if you have any experience with this matter. i m a really young college kid, i don t know too much.

20090220234055AA0DAc2	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	Houston TX accident/citations/and insurance...?	I was in an accident about a week ago. A guy in front of me braked out of nowhere, I tried to stop, but it was raining that day and the tires slid and I ended up hitting him. I had never been in an accident so I was more scared than anything. Nobody was hurt and I do believe the car was totaled (the hood was crushed in) but my question is: The car was not mine nor my husbands...it was his brothers car. He was the only one on the insurance. Since I have been the one to be in the accident...how would that work? Will the insurance cover everything even though I was not on that insurance? I also got two citations: One for failure to control speed and the other for failure to have documents...or something like that cause the insurance card was not inside the car. I have heard from 3 people that the citation for the insurance would be removed as long as I can show the court proof of insurance. But can anybody give me an estimate of how much the citation for failure to control speed would be? I'm supposed to give them a call on Monday, but before then...can anybody tell me if I would be able to work out a payment plan if the citation exceeds my budget? Thank you for your time and answers.

I also have an alpine m-450 amp. I have seen the amp work fine on other cars so I know the amp is fine. For some reason every time I hook up a subwoofer to this amp, it will take about a week and then blow the sub. I have went through five sub-woofers in the past few months and I really want to have a good sounding sub but I don't want to keep losing money on this.      I know it could sound like a wiring problem but I have wired many sub-woofers before and they have all worked perfectly. I even got a new wiring kit to make sure it's not the wiring. I have a stock deck and I had to slice wires in the back by the stock amps to make it work. Can anybody help me find a way to not blow my subs anymore. Oh and btw   I dont crank them loud and the subwoofers I buy can take more power than I feed to them.

The truck fires up normally and runs great until it warms up and then the transmission kinda just quits. It's almost like driving in neutral and then I lose reverse. After it cools down, it seems to be ok again...until today. I was visiting my sister who lives 100 miles away from me and on the way there, the truck was doing the same thing only this time I let it cool down and the same was still happening. I checked the fluid level and it seems full but very burnt. It is a 4x4 if that helps. I am stuck 60 miles from home and don't have the money to tow it home. Is there anything I could try just so I can make it home so I can have someone look at it? Please help, I am stuck spending the night in a hotel over this and just really need to get home.

20090221005947AADBCL2	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	Can Car Insurance Co. charge a percentage for not using their collision center?	I was rear ended by a drunk driver while i was sitting in my car parked at a curb.    My car was to be taken to a collision center that is contracted through my insurance.    I chose to use an independent collision center so I could get a fair and unbiased assessment of the damage.   The contracted collision center said that if I was to take my car to another collsion center I would be responsible for 20% of the repairs, if the car is not deemed a total loss. So if the repairs are $10,000, I would have to pay $2,000.      Are insurance companies and their contracted collsion centers allowed to basically bully and blackmail their own insurers like this?   Also, if I would have to pay this if the car is repairable, would the other drivers insurance cover this 20%? Thanks
