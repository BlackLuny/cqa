tPPZ0QDmaa	I have good news for you, and some bad news.<br>  <br>  First the good.  September isn't a busy time for tourists on the island and deals can be had everywhere.  Since there are less people, you will have more beaches to yourself and you will spend less time waiting to do things such as snorkeling, parasailing, jet skiing, etc.  <br>  <br>  Now for the bad.  Its still technically hurricane season and you might not want to take a chance getting caught in something really potentially life ending.  Since its slow at hotel's, some of them take that time to renovate units.  Meaning you'll contend with hammers pounding away at 6am or saws buzzing at 8pm.  There's also less staff available at most hotels, so service may be less than spectacular.  <br>  <br>  The not-so-bad.  If you don't mind some minor distractions and inconveniences, watch the weather and you might have a great vacation while saving tons!|`|UO2yyZneaa	Yes, September is part of the hurricane season for the Caribbean including Jamaica. The truth is that there are a fairly small number of hurricanes and tropical storms, and the odds that you will face one are relatively small. But it's still enough of a possibility to make quite a few people avoid the area.<br>  <br>  If you want to go to the Caribbean during September, you would be better off going farther south to islands including Trinidad, Aruba, Bonaire and Curacao. They rarely get bad weather, although it's not a sure thing.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, check out the weather chart below for Jamica. September is the second worst month of the year for both rain days and total rainfall.|`|NBHiHDl0aa	technically september is hurricane season.  but i was there during that time and it was fine.  the rain comes fast and hard. but leaves quick. you can still have a great time.|`|rO97Pso1aa	No it is a bad idea visiting Jamaica.You should visit Trinidad&Tobago instead.T&T has no Hurricanes.
sHBe8gDXaa	Costa Rica has a population of 4,133,884. The combined white and Mestizo groups constitute 94% of the population, while 3% are Black/Afro-Caribbean, 1% Amerindian, 1% Chinese and 1% are of other ethnic groups. The exact breakdown, however, is not known because the Costa Rican census combines whites and Mestizos in one category. The white population is primarily of Spaniard ancestry with significant numbers of Costa Ricans of Italian, German, Jewish and Polish descent.<br>  <br>  Just under 3% of the population is of black African descent. The majority of the Afro-Costa Ricans are Creole English-speaking descendants of nineteenth century black Jamaican immigrant workers, as well as slaves who were brought during the Atlantic slave trade.<br>  <br>  The indigenous or Amerindian population numbers around 1%, or over 41,000 individuals. A significant portion of the population descends from a bi-racial mix of local Amerindians and Spaniards, most live in secluded Indian reservations in the Cordillera de Talamanca or Guanacaste.<br>  <br>  There is also an expatriate community of people of all ages from the United States, Canada, Germany, Netherlands, Britain, and other countries.<br>  <br>  Costa Rica hosts many refugees, mainly from Colombia and Nicaragua. As a result, an estimated 10% of the Costa Rican population is made up of Nicaraguans, most of whom migrate for seasonal work opportunities and then return to their country. Moreover, Costa Rica took in many refugees from a range of other Latin American countries fleeing civil wars and dictatorships during the 1970s and 80s - notably from Chile and Argentina, as well as those from El Salvador who fled from guerrillas and government death squads.|`|93992d20fdf6a4d501f390ba5e88e230aa	Most of Costa Rica is Hispanic maybe 20% is american|`|AA10287830	I could give you all the history but it really boils down to being Cost Rican.  The same is true of Peurto Ricans.  The races have combined into one so it has become one wih the country.|`|330718658afa202c6c1e35e1fbc8785faa	Costa Rica doesn't have a "race". Most of the people there are of mixed amerindian/spanish descent. There are people with some african heritage on the carribean side, and there are lots of white expatriots from the US, canada, and some european countries too. <br>  <br>  The "average" person in costa rica has dark brown or black hair, brown eyes, and tan skin. However, costa ricans come in all colors, from the palest blonde, to very dark skin! It's a beautiful country, with beautiful, friendly people!|`|um0Ezo5raa	Costa Rica has several races, the majority are  white, decendants of spaniards and other europeans.<br>  Their is a minority of carribean blacks mainly on the east coast, some indigenous population in a couple in the east and southern mountains and a few orientals that descended from immigrants.<br>  <br>  Lic.Gregory Kearney Lawson.|`|mDYsr62maa	Primarily of Spanish descent with very little co-minglingg with other races.  there is a very small native population in the south and black population on the Caribbean side.|`|QLbiAcspaa	●77% of people in Costa Rica are of either European (mostly Spanish) but there are significant numbers of Costa Ricans descentof Italian, German, English, Dutch, French, Portuguese and Polish.<br>  <br>  ●Together, whites and castizos make up a full 94% of the population ancestry or are white, <br>  <br>  ●17 % are mestizos (white people mixed with amerindian people).|`|92d9c02022141063084719e3977eef9caa	Well here is a little history. Over 10 thousand years ago people migrated from Alaska to Costa Rica and they are the ones we call indians, or native americans, then in 1502 Christopher Columbus came with a bunch of Spaniards and Costa Rica became a Spanish colony a few years later. Then during the 1880′s a US business man named Minor C. Keith came to CR and brought the company called  United Fruit Co which today is known as <a href="http://www.chiquita.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.chiquita.com/</a> and he brought African americans from the Carribean Islands to work on the railroads that transported the fruits also Chinese immigrants worked on the railroads. <br>  <br>   So we call ourselves Hispanics but really, we are a mix of Native American, Spain, African and Chinese.|`|ijAYexvnaa	they are of European ancestry......most don't look like people from Mexico......i would consider most to look more Caucasian....if gringo's dressed like them it would be hard to tell which was which

AA10471679	The politicians are equally trustworthy.<br>  <br>  Had to get that in there.<br>  <br>  Ukraine is actually figuring it out as they go, whereas the U-S has had 200-years to fiddle with the system.  Their legislature is unicameral; ours bicameral.  Their equivalent to our states are "oblasts" (which don't carry the traditions - or illusions - of Independence that our states have.)  They have a presidency and a supreme court.  <br>  <br>  But like I said, everybody's trying to figure out who has what power; and since everybody else is an idiot, only "our guys" should have power.

rLiyrhCdaa	since your a student, im assuming that your relatively young. A great place to consider is Jersey city. Down Town Jersey City is awesome. Very safe. Many young ppl, I would say its filled with yupies. Many things to do. and affordable living. there is alot of great shopping, resterants and bars. your also very close to the train. <br>  <br>  Nowadays, New York is pretty safe. were ever you chose to live, you cant go wrong.|`|41ERg1Gvaa	There are many safe neighborhoods in NYC and many safe ones in NJ, but there are also unsavory areas in NJ as well as in NYC.  Based on your need to get to two different campuses in Manhattan regularly, it might make sense for you to live in Manhattan, in Brooklyn, in Queens, or in the near suburbs of New Jersey.  It does not make sense for you to try to commute daily from Mercer County, as that's way down in NJ, near Trenton, so the trip would be over an hour each way. It's hard to recommend specific neighborhoods without knowing what your price range is like.  If you need a furnished apartment, you might want to look for a sublet on Craigslist.|`|847a6e5aa5c40606588dea148698eed2aa	i hear these questions  A LOT.  and here's the real answer.<br>  <br>  it is naive to think that you can simply dismiss entire neighborhoods as either "good" or "bad" based on some numbers on a map. the fact of the matter is that new york city is a very compact city, and people have to be neighbors whether they like it or not.  living in such a dense urban area means you mix in the good with the bad..... one street may be considered "good" while the one right next to it is "bad" etc. <br>  <br>  this isn't the rest of the usa. this is nyc.<br>  <br>  the question you should be asking instead is "which neighborhood feature good restaurants, shopping, amenities, and entertainment"  those are more important criteria.<br>  <br>  if you really want the safest neighborhood, try either bayside, douglaston, or little neck. they are in nyc.|`|AA10002035	New York City is very safe these days, and especially in the neighborhoods you listed.

Mi2w3lvEaa	I'd ask you to clarify your question.  You mention a "container" and something about velocity.  Do you mean a shipping container that will travel by truck at perhaps 50 km/hr?  Travel time aside it would have to pass customs twice - first at the Burkina Faso border, then again at the Mali border.  Difficult to estimate how much time this could take but if I had to guess I'd say allow 4 days total..|`|av3vmWSHaa	just 1 day|`|NvOTvzEMaa	Great Question!

The interstate system from LA to Detroit-Windsor is great and then you have 8 lane expressways (Hwy#401)  from Windsor thru to Montreal.  <br>  <br>  Would advise considering route back to be heading west from Montreal along Trans-Canada highway north of Superior west all the way to the Pacific ( Vancouver) and then I-5 south back to LA. <br>  Yes its all paved. <br>  (if you really want to see the continent) <br>  Montreal to Vancouver is about 60 hours of drivetime. Vancouver to LA is about 19 hours of drive time|`|b7jq1tfRaa	well its all paved roads in Canada and lots of gas stops so it should be fine, I'm not sure about the states I've heard that they don't have that many paved roads there and you have to watch out for bandits and cut throats along the way.

However, such a place just doesn’t exist; the two terms are mutually exclusive. It's all about supply and demand: If it's in SoCal, then it's not going to be cheap to begin with. If it's a safe area, then it's more expensive. If you need good schools, add a couple hundred bucks a month on top of it.<br>  <br>  If you want to live here and enjoy the weather, then you have to pay for it. You put up with the smog and the traffic, enjoy the weather and pay your rent or mortgage. My advice is to start checking out craigslist, rent.com, and apartments.com if you are looking to rent. You’ll quickly see that the minimum rent for a non-war zone is about $1,000-$1,200 per month for a studio or 1BR. Really nice areas (like the West LA area) easily run $3,000 or more. Want to live near the beach? Expect to pay a premium.

It's almost as if there's the notion that if they can get here, it's such a great place, they'll stay," said Chris Robinson.<br>  <br>  Immigration isn't a permanent phenomenon and Canada needs to approach it as a firm would approach retaining an employee, he said. "We don't want to take it as a given that just because somebody's come here that they're going to stay."<br>  <br>  One-third of young male immigrants leave Canada within 20 years of arriving and more than 60 per cent of those who leave do so in the first year, according to Return and Onward Migration among Working Age Men, a recent Statistics Canada report co-authored by Robinson.<br>  <br>  The report, a study of male immigrants aged 25 to 45 at the time they arrived in Canada, found that over the past two decades business professionals and skilled workers, the most desirable immigrants, are the most likely to leave, with 40 per cent of them leaving the country within 5 years of arrival.<br>  <br>  Because there are no exit interviews when an immigrant leaves Canada, the study made inferences about why they left based on landing records, census data and income tax filings. Immigrants who arrived during poor economic climates (in 1980 and 1990) were more likely to leave than those who arrived during boom times (1986 and 1996). Therefore, it's likely immigrants are leaving for better opportunities elsewhere, said Robinson.<br>  <br>  The best way to keep these immigrants is to ensure they get jobs that match their skills and experiences, said the director of operations at the Toronto Region Immigrant Employment Council.<br>  <br>  "We know that good employment is the number one indicator of successful integration for immigrants," said Elizabeth McIsaac. "A key element in all this is having employers involved in the development of programs that are intended to bring immigrants into the labour market."<br>  <br>  One such program is Toronto's Career Bridge, a non-profit internship program that matches qualified immigrants with appropriate jobs. Since the program started three years ago, 270 immigrants have found full-time work in their fields, but there are still 1,500 skilled immigrants, more than half with university degrees, on the waiting list. So far only 115 of the city's 2,760 businesses with more than 100 employees have signed up for the program.<br>  <br>  HR professionals need to begin looking at international credentials and education as an asset, said McIsaac. There are tools available to help HR understand international credentials and agencies that can connect employers with immigrants, so employers have no excuse not to consider immigrants for job openings, she said.<br>  <br>  "Once you begin to have more experience working with immigrant communities, it becomes a lot easier and you can do it a lot better," she said.<br>  <br>  If Canadian employers aren't willing to take advantage of these immigrants, the Statistics Canada report proves they'll go elsewhere to find jobs, said Robinson.<br>  <br>  "If a better opportunity comes up somewhere else and it happens to come up across an international border, then they're quite likely to move," he said.<br>  <br>  Over the next 10 years, immigration will represent all of the growth in Canada's workforce because there simply won't be enough young Canadians to replace retiring baby boomers. However, Canada isn't the only country facing a looming labour shortage and other countries that haven't typically gone after immigrants, such as Japan and India, are now doing so, said McIsaac.<br>  <br>  "We are in a global economy and we are competing for a high level of talent in other countries," she said. "We have to do a better job of receiving that talent."|`|CLjiev9Xaa	Moving to a new country is always a big gamble.   First you must be completely committed to the move and not half hearted.    This goes for all members of the group as one unsatisfied visitor can kill it for all the others.    You must remember that you are leaving your own culture and way of life and choosing another, so research is a must.    Homesickness is a big thing but that will disappear with time as you meet new people.     Do it young and keep an open mind and you have to adapt to us, not the other way around.

QoVL5cDHaa	Probably the weather we have had this winter, except the word should be cold!<br>  I don't think "cool Cornwall" is a term generally used for our Cornwall. To an extent it is trendy, with the surfing (mainly at Newquay), and all the Hooray Henrys spending summers at Rock/Polzeath. Rick Stein attracts a lot of visitors to Padstow. Otherwise it is more of a place for the elderly retired than young people. Housing is expensive, wages are low. Main employment available is in the tourist trade or agriculture, usually at minimum wage, so few young people can afford to live here.<br>  If by "cool" it is meant that Cornwall has attractions, there are the moors, the towering cliffs of the North Coast, ancient castles, quaint villages, and a laid-back way of life. But public transport is poor, socialising is difficult without a car.<br>  I suggest you Google some of the tourism sites for Cornish towns, and see what you can pick up on. Those sites are always optimistic!|`|d2yvR0Ruaa	Geographically speaking it is the cool weather and cool sea.
SLFt8eHEaa	I'm afraid there are many problems with your plan.  To be able to live and work in the UK you will require a visa and these are very hard to get if you do not come from the European Union (EU).  You will have to find an employer willing to sponsor you and that employer will then have to prove to the immigration officials that they can't source your particular form of labour from anywhere else in the EU.  Obviously, at 16 you won't have any sort of specialised labour skills and so it will be pretty much impossible for you to get a visa.<br>  <br>  Even if you came over here without the requisite visa, it is very unlikely that you would be let into the country in the first place.  Immigration (at the airport) will see you have a one way ticket, that you have no visas to work and that you won't have any money to support yourself.  They'll almost certainly put you on the first plane back home without even letting you in the country.<br>  <br>  Even if you did, by some miracle, move over here, things would be very tough as a 16 year old.  It's unlikely that any landlord will rent you property when you're under 18 as a) it's too much of a risk to let people so young look after a property and b) it's very unlikely that you will have the financial means to keep up with your rent.  Getting a good job will be hard as the lack of qualifications will mean you'll end up doing something like stacking shelves.  This country is a lot more expensive than the US (petrol, or 'gas' as you call it is three times the price, to rent a two bed flat, or 'apartment' as you would say, somewhere like London costs roughly $2500 a month) and so financially it will be a struggle if not totally impossible.  And of course, there are practical things like you won't be able to drive here (you have to be 17 regardless of your nationality) and you may have experience something of a culture shock.<br>  <br>  Sorry if this all sounds a bit negative, but it's better that you know now before you start spending too much money or making too many plans.  The best thing for you to do would be to stay at home, get a good education and gain all of the skills you need to come over here, both practically and legally.   It might also be worth joining a study abroad programme at university to see if you even like the country in the first place, or at least come over here to visit first.|`|rKGOtM7naa	hon don't you think you should finish up high school first? what is the rush to go? are your parents going to be ok with you living in a foreign country at such a young age? i'm not saying it's not a great idea since i, too am looking to get over to england for a bit. but i am 23! <br>  <br>  my opinion -- you're too young to move there. you should visit there with your friend this summer or sometime soon so you go and get a feel for things. but be smart about it. stay in the states until you graduate high school. if you decide to go to college there are a lot of great study abroad programs that are offered in england that u could do. if not college, then at 18 you are better apt to handle yourself abroad than at 16. it's a lot safer, too! people see young kids on their own and take advantage right away. <br>  <br>  good luck hon and i wish ud take my advice!|`|NARiXGNDaa	well how old is ur friend, you could rent out an apartment and work full time...16 would restict you from some things, but not alot....try get ur parents to settle you in first and then they could go....<br>  Ask the British embassy in america<br>  <br>  xx|`|rZWEFz4Qaa	haha.<br>  i want to be there when you order<br>  french fries, and they have no idea<br>  what the hell you're talking about<br>  and they bring you<br>  a deep fried french man.|`|lttxIcfvaa	I think you have to be meeting someone in England if your under 16 but not 100% sure.|`|10cnKUpxaa	Legal enough for certain british pastimes

Miller for providing us with this information...<br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  6404.5. (a) The Legislature finds and declares that regulation of<br>  smoking in the workplace is a matter of statewide interest and<br>  concern. It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this<br>  section to prohibit the smoking of tobacco products in all (100<br>  percent of) enclosed places of employment in this state, as covered<br>  by this section, thereby eliminating the need of local governments to<br>  enact workplace smoking restrictions within their respective<br>  jurisdictions. It is further the intent of the Legislature to create<br>  a uniform statewide standard to restrict and prohibit the smoking of<br>  tobacco products in enclosed places of employment, as specified in<br>  this section, in order to reduce employee exposure to environmental<br>  tobacco smoke to a level that will prevent anything other than<br>  insignificantly harmful effects to exposed employees, and also to<br>  eliminate the confusion and hardship that can result from enactment<br>  or enforcement of disparate local workplace smoking restrictions.<br>  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, it is the intent<br>  of the Legislature that any area not defined as a "place of<br>  employment" pursuant to subdivision (d) or in which the smoking of<br>  tobacco products is not regulated pursuant to subdivision (e) shall<br>  be subject to local regulation of smoking of tobacco products.<br>  (b) No employer shall knowingly or intentionally permit, and no<br>  person shall engage in, the smoking of tobacco products in an<br>  enclosed space at a place of employment.<br>  (c) For purposes of this section, an employer who permits any<br>  nonemployee access to his or her place of employment on a regular<br>  basis has not acted knowingly or intentionally if he or she has taken<br>  the following reasonable steps to prevent smoking by a nonemployee:<br>  <br>  (1) Posted clear and prominent signs, as follows:<br>  (A) Where smoking is prohibited throughout the building or<br>  structure, a sign stating "No smoking" shall be posted at each<br>  entrance to the building or structure.<br>  (B) Where smoking is permitted in designated areas of the building<br>  or structure, a sign stating "Smoking is prohibited except in<br>  designated areas" shall be posted at each entrance to the building or<br>  structure.<br>  (2) Has requested, when appropriate, that a nonemployee who is<br>  smoking refrain from smoking in the enclosed workplace.<br>  For purposes of this subdivision, "reasonable steps" does not<br>  include (A) the physical ejection of a nonemployee from the place of<br>  employment or (B) any requirement for making a request to a<br>  nonemployee to refrain from smoking, under circumstances involving a<br>  risk of physical harm to the employer or any employee.<br>  (d) For purposes of this section, "place of employment" does not<br>  include any of the following:<br>  (1) Sixty-five percent of the guest room accommodations in a<br>  hotel, motel, or similar transient lodging establishment.<br>  (2) Areas of the lobby in a hotel, motel, or other similar<br>  transient lodging establishment designated for smoking by the<br>  establishment. Such an establishment may permit smoking in a<br>  designated lobby area that does not exceed 25 percent of the total<br>  floor area of the lobby or, if the total area of the lobby is 2,000<br>  square feet or less, that does not exceed 50 percent of the total<br>  floor area of the lobby. For purposes of this paragraph, "lobby"<br>  means the common public area of such an establishment in which<br>  registration and other similar or related transactions, or both, are<br>  conducted and in which the establishment's guests and members of the<br>  public typically congregate.<br>  (3) Meeting and banquet rooms in a hotel, motel, other transient<br>  lodging establishment similar to a hotel or motel, restaurant, or<br>  public convention center, except while food or beverage functions are<br>  taking place, including setup, service, and cleanup activities, or<br>  when the room is being used for exhibit purposes. At times when<br>  smoking is not permitted in such a meeting or banquet room pursuant<br>  to this paragraph, the establishment may permit smoking in corridors<br>  and prefunction areas adjacent to and serving the meeting or banquet<br>  room if no employee is stationed in that corridor or area on other<br>  than a passing basis.<br>  (4) Retail or wholesale tobacco shops and private smokers'<br>  lounges. For purposes of this paragraph:<br>  (A) "Private smokers' lounge" means any enclosed area in or<br>  attached to a retail or wholesale tobacco shop that is dedicated to<br>  the use of tobacco products, including, but not limited to, cigars<br>  and pipes.<br>  (B) "Retail or wholesale tobacco shop" means any business<br>  establishment the main purpose of which is the sale of tobacco<br>  products, including, but not limited to, cigars, pipe tobacco, and<br>  smoking accessories.<br>  (5) Cabs of motortrucks, as defined in Section 410 of the Vehicle<br>  Code, or truck tractors, as defined in Section 65

The Perito Moreno glacier is justifiably famous.  Simply spectacular.<br>  <br>  I loved all of Ushuaia.  I thought it was a funky town, with lots of charm.

It was not too cold at all, and there were almost no other tourists.  So, accomodations were not expensive, and when I went for a hike in the national park outside Ushuaia, I had been the only visitor for the past 5 days (based on no other footprints in 5-day-old snow).  No idea how crowded it gets during their winter, so your mileage may vary.|`|W5VqTPQRaa	There are so many things to see all over the south of Argentina.<br>  I'd recommend:<br>  Bariloche- great ski town, lots of national parks<br>  Ushuaia- penguins! and you can see antarctica<br>  El Calafate- life changing, really an incredible place to go<br>  Rio Gallega- i think you get the point...GO THERE!!!!<br>  <br>  From BA, it is possible to take busses, but, especially if you go to Ushuaia, you'd be better off taking a plane.

RQ4h0ltuaa	The weather is always good down here, but it tends to get a little cool at night. Especially in march, that's when we start to heat back up. So I would say plan on it being hot but pack some stuff for when it cools down at night.|`|hLohtlPEaa	If you are going the first two weeks of march, be prepared to be rubbing elbows with a lot of bikers. You'll have a great time. Oh, the weather. Sometimes it is hotter than 6 hells in march and sometimes it's chilly. Be prepared. Take your sunscreen.|`|AA10855383	Well bike week is still going on the first week of march (it gets crazy down there.. more like a spring break version for bikers) And after bike week is spring break. Weather?? If early march it will be in the 70's, maybe 60's..(i checked weather, too cuz im trying to go to the beach too) bring a jacket cuz it gets windy at night and cold still. <br>  Late march is more for beach time it will be in the 80's by then. People beach all year around, i was just at the beach the other day and it was like 48 degrees and there were tons of surfers in the water. just dress like its spring/summer during the say and at night it gets cool near the beach so wear jeans/capris....<br>  <br>  just be prepared.. cuz in march 2008 it was still a little cool to go to the beach.. i didn't start going again til it was almost april (i live in jacksonville of course we are like 8 degrees cooller than daytona and orlando)|`|CpTQagJOaa	Are you coming here for Bike Week? If not, you should probably know about it. It is the first week in March and the city is filled with almost a 100,000 bikers from all over the US..so they take over the area during that time, the traffic is awful, lots of detours and biker events. If that's what you are coming here for then you will Love it! If not then it will definently hinder whatever you are trying to do in the area, so you would want to wait until the 2nd week of March to come. The weather here is really weird, super hot one day and the chilly the next. So bring your bathing suit and shorts...and atleast a light jacket and jeans.You'll love it here! Have fun!...oh and take a drive down A1A about 20 miles north of Daytona to Flager Beach for a more quiet peaceful day at the beach, it's a sleepy little queit beachy town with beachy cafes and super friendly people. Have fun! :)|`|XzLUA7ataa	You'll get some sun, so bring your sunscreen.  It's expected to warm up for this weekend, and the daytime temperatures are warm and pleasant.  You can bring your bikini and short shorts, but pack a sweatshirt or light jacket for the evenings because it drops down after sunset and sometimes the wind picks up giving a chill. Enjoy!|`|c7992d905ee1715cf5c3ed1c09c6ee98aa	It's so hot over here make sure you bring sum sun block.|`|96fTygalaa	Bring shorts, flip flops that are comfortable, tanks, tees, sunglasses, sunscreen, and a spray bottle.

5q7uPqVmaa	At the risk of sounding obvious, have you considered Williamsburg, Virginia?  It's definately historic, there's lots to do in the area, and has lots of opportunities for romantic dining.  You could make sidetrips to Virginia Beach or Richmond, which would allow more variety in what you could do.  You might also want to try Charlottesville---no beaches nearby if that's what you want but it definately has romantic, relaxing and history.|`|AA12086491	Try Savannah or Charleston.  They aren't small but they are romantic and relaxing with history.  If you definitely want small try Annapolis or St. Michaels, MD or Yorktown, VA

fZjgIE9Baa	Instead of taking the Amtrak to Newark airport, why don't you take a direct flight with US Airways from PHL to Orlando?<br>  <br>  I'm sorry, this question is hard to understand.|`|IBMDQpmRaa	Continental and Amtrak have a deal so that CO's "flights" from Phila to Newark are actually trains, and the fare is often less than a nonstop from EWR on CO or from PHL on US. For those of us who live in New Jersey, it'd be quicker to go straight to Newark rather than going down to Phila and coming back.<br>  <br>  This question comes up a lot in frequent flyer fora, where the consensus is that you can skip the train. If you live in central NJ, you can also get on in Trenton, Princeton Jct, or Metropark and take the train to the airport.

West coast is nice as well.|`|EMYImof1aa	i'd say scotland, i really want to see Glasgow, and Edinburgh :D|`|T5DbLLgQaa	Do a combined trip to both Ireland & Wales if you can!! I highly recommend you to visit the wonderful Tabhairne Leo in Meenaleck, Gweedore, co. Donegal as well as the Poisoned Glen nearby!

You could stay in Killarney which is in Co. Kerry. Lots of places to stay, lots of restaurants and pubs..really lively little town. The lots to do there that a whole family would enjoy - torc waterfall, the lakes -you can take a boat out on the lake, pony trekking or horse and carts, gap of dunloe, muckross house..<br>  Also if your parents have a car, you should do the Ring of Kerry road trip..its a really scenic drive, part by the coast and you pass through some lovely villages such as Kenmare, which has some amazing restaurants. It has a street full of restaurants, and every single one has loads of people in it so you know theyre good. <br>  Also on another day you could drive to Dingle - seaside resort and you can take boat trips out to see Fungi the dolphin. There is a pretty good chance to see him, he's always around the bay - money back tho if you dont see him.<br>  And you may need to book in advance, depends on when your going, but you can take a boat out to Skellig Michael, which is a small island of the coast. Its a UNESCO world heritage site - def worth a visit, tho the boat ride over can be choppy.<br>  <br>  anyway have a look at this site, it will tell you more and theres photos:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.killarney.ie/" rel="nofollow">http://www.killarney.ie/</a>|`|89ff4d66abc41fa64f9e0ff2d5b6ffd4aa	I don't know why they are spending so long in England.

fM7CwTwzaa	Depends on what the pass gives you and what they're charging for it. It MIGHT be a good deal if they have discounts for clubs, restaurants, or activities you'd want to go to anyway. Might be a bad deal if all their discounts are for boring places or have too many exclusions.<br>  <br>  There are some web sites out there that have coupons for various places in Cancun, plus, when you get off the plane in Cancun, there are always lots of annoying little twits shoving discouint coupon books in your face --- grab some of these, they might be just as good as the discount pass you paid money for. There's also a site on the web called entertainment-plus that has a discount card for $15 (good for 2 people). Might be worth looking at theirs too.<br>  <br>  Hard to know if it's REALLY worth buying any specific pass unless you 1) see the deals they have, and 2) know what other deals are out there for free or cheap.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

4tFuosueaa	Sure!  Mine has locks too, but they will randomly open suitcases anyway. Best not to lock them.|`|Ry8oAQ7Laa	You don't have to lock your luggage, but lets say you do, if TSA has to search you're bag they'll just cut it open.  Or, you can buy TSA approved locks, and that way they won't cut the locks off.  I think that if you go to TSA.gov they can give you more info. about those locks because I don't know how much they are.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	You are not allowed to have a lock due to 9/11 security updates. If they have a reason to search your bag,which they will because it's locked, they will break the lock and look through your bag.|`|3UB7mSNwaa	Yes you can use the luggage you have just don't lock it and you will be fine.|`|7D44tO9Daa	yes you can use it, but DO NOT LOCK IT! <br>  <br>  i locked my luggage once (like an idiot) and the airport broke my lock to get into my bag.
lcj1AKt1aa	You can bring electronics on the plane but you should not be using them when the plane is lifting off or landing.  This will probably affect the system.  Many people use laptops on the flight. Normally, you will be able to watch TV on the plane. You can only bring the required weight on the plane as hand luggage and this can include a handbag, umbrella and hand luggage that can fit to their specifications. You might be able to bring a laptop as well.|`|c93ea3c8cf1c3dd9a0e3b461289096d9aa	I don't think there is a limit to electronics in your carry-on, however, security may ask to look more closely at some or all of them when you go through check points. Have them all easily accessable so you can easily get them out of the bag/case. You may also want to check the carry-on restrictions of the airline. Most will allow a regular carry-on bag and a purse or a computer bag, but maybe not all three.<br>  I don't know how a LOT plane is different than regular planes, but I'm sure there is no WiFi once you are in flight (in fact most airlines make you turn your cellphone off or to "airplane mode" before take off).|`|PwfS4T74aa	Several airlines currently offer inflight Wi-Fi, it depends on who you're flying with.<br>  <br>  <br>  There is no limit to how many you bring, but chances are you'll end up only using about 2 of them<br>  <br>  Airplanes have an entertainment system which is composed of several small TV's. Each screen serves 3 rows of seats, and plays either TV shows (if your flight  is 1 hr or less), 1 movie and a TV show (1:30-2 hours), or 2+ movies and TV shows(3:30 hours or more)<br>  <br>  <br>  Don't bring your laptop as a carryon-you can't use the internet on it, it will be heavy, and you'll risk damaging it in the rush of the gate/flight/arrival tango...
1NPVVxW0aa	Bring your own entertainment - an iPod or whatever MP3 player. Maybe an MP4 player, PSP or portable DVD/DIVX player. Load it with your favourite short TV stuff - it's impossible to concentrate long enough on a feature film on a 4inch screen but short comedt TV shows really fill the time.<br>  <br>  Use the weird little blanket you get to cover your head complately - it blanks out the stressful environment and helps you to relax and sleep (if you can sleep on a plane). No-one will think you're weird, it's quite common.<br>  <br>  Get ear plugs and put them in on take off and when approaching your destination to combat the rapid climb/drop in altitude - you won't look weird, just like a professional traveller!. I always do this as I have spent days almost deaf/unable to hear myself speaking on landing. <br>  <br>  Drink water frequently on the flight - US airports allow you to buy water and soft drinks in the 'safe zone' before boarding.<br>  <br>  Loosen your shoelaces when you are seated - lace them up again before visiting the toilet!<br>  <br>  If you think you'll sleep, ask for a window seat on check in or when booking your flight. If you don't, or think you'll need the toilet a lot, ask for an aisle seat.<br>  <br>  If you have a choice of seats when booking your flight look for free rows and book a seat on the edge as far back in the plane as possible - you're more likely to get a free seat next to you. Similarly, seats at the back are less popular - at the very back, sometimes they have less foot room or luggage space due to being used by the flight crew - in my experience the flight crew will go out of their way to find storage for you in these seats.<br>  <br>  Good luck and hope you have a survivable flight! <br>  <br>  If it's really bad, remember it'll all be over in hours and you'll be in Greece or home! :)|`|AA11496012	Sleeping is the best way to pass the time and you will arrive at your destination more refreshed.  The airline should show a movie but it is always best to bring a book or magazine in case what is being shown is not to your liking.<br>  <br>  As for clothes, do wear something loose and comfortable.  Also dress in layers as it can get chilly on the airplane.<br>  <br>  Bring some food with you in case you don't like what is served.|`|OJIXRFxMaa	Bring stuff to entertain yourself, magazines, puzzles, your laptop. Ect. <br>  <br>  wear comfortable clothes.<br>  <br>  sleep.<br>  <br>  bring your ipod.<br>  <br>  watch movies.|`|WlYknD5Vaa	just watch movies, they are usually pretty good ones on the AVOD systems. they make the time pass by. dont wear a ton of jewelery or belts or anything metal on the plane because security is a hassle. get up and walk around on the plane to keep up your circulation|`|cc90d2a591e25825c1e6d529e9d6de8daa	sleep if u can the flight will go by quicker|`|vITZgKthaa	i agree there is nothing better than to sleep and once arrive you could be awake and happy :]
fZjgIE9Baa	Absolutely, but it counts as a carry on. Most airlines allow 1 or 2 carry ons|`|7D44tO9Daa	yes you can; although sometimes there may be problems: <br>  <br>  depending on what kind of laptop you have, sometimes the x-ray machine can think that there is something in your laptop.... it happened to me (i have a mac)|`|9RtdvLEKaa	Yes, you can use it and there shouldn't be a problem but I'm pretty sure there won't be wifi and there will be no place to plug it in and charge it.|`|AA10614356	Sometimes you can and sometimes you can't.
EtvOXf31aa	According to my grandfather who does the family's taxes, about six to eight weeks. Probably have it by first week of April.
