20090202105027AAMYFk9	Education & Reference;Teaching	As a middle school teacher of mathematics (former HOD) am I obliged to take direction from LEA Consultants?	I am a teacher with more than 20 years classroom experience at University, Grammar and High School in USA, Europe and England.  A former Senior Teacher and Head of Department I now find myself working for a Head-teacher that has taken a personal dislike to me.  He relieved me of my post as Head of Department shortly after I returned from a period of illness and since that time has taken every opportunity to slight me.  He appointed a new Head of Department but she only worked one day and then went off on the sick and has not returned.  He has therefore called in the LEA Secondary Mathematics Consultant to meet with me each week to review and direct my planning etc.  The consultant has informed me that she is to "team teach" with me next week.  Am I obliged to cooperate with her?  She is directing me on what she wants taught and how it is to be taught even though I would prefer to deliver the syllabus using a textbook based scheme.  What are my options?  The LEA is a small one and is cut off from the mainland therefore it is their way or the highway. How can I get out of this mess?

20090202111106AAWef0V	Education & Reference;Standards & Testing	Does this synthesis essay topic for AP Language and Composition make any sense?!?!?	We've been analyzing essays over photography for AP Language and Composition lately. But today we had a sub, and our actual teacher left in her first class because of her sick kid. She typed up an assignment for us that had tons of typos in it, leading me to think she was rushed and not thinking very coherently.     And in the assignment, it says to take a stand on whether television has had a positive impact on presidential politics (??). And it also says to synthesize and cite three of the six photography essays we analyzed, none of which involved politics.    My question is, does this make any sense for a synthesis essay??? I have never done one, but I don't think this is right. I think my teacher meant to say "how does PHOTOGRAPHY affect presidential politics."     Am I wrong though? Do synthesis essays really relate weakly related topics such as photography and televised presidential elections???    any advice is appreciated. Thanks in advance

20090202112232AAbaHyr	Education & Reference;Financial Aid	Pell Grant  - Tuition Question?	Hi all,      I received the Pell Grant at $2600 for the 2008 - 2009 school year, $1300 per semester.  In the first semester, I used all of it, but then withdrew from one class.  So they took that class ($300) back.      Now, on my financial aid summary, it shows the following:      20091 ($1000)   20092 ($1300)   20093 ($300)      If I'm reading tis correctly, that means I can use the $300 for the summer semester, right?  I assume the 1, 2, and 3 are referring to semesters.  Anyone ever had this come up before?      (I'm waiting on the Finan Aid office to get back to me, but thought someone else might know.)      Also, anyone have an idea what the PELL awards are for 09-10??

20090203170455AAyQrcF	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Can someone correct the punctuation in this homework?(long)?	“An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.” Mahatma Gandhi, (attributed).          This quote said by Gandhi is meant to be interpreted that if we respond to any sort of violence the other will respond with equivalent or more violence. You take his eye, he takes your eye; she takes my tooth I take her tooth, etc. When this sort of revenge happens everyone continues to wound each other till we are all wounded. If the world goes on like this everyone will be ‘blind’ because almost everyone seeks revenge when they are harmed, in order to not feel inferior to others. Yet this is how our world works; if someone bombs a country, it is only right to bomb them back. If a religion kills some of ‘your’ people, you kill some of theirs back. It is also present in smaller situations, he punches her, and she punches him back. This leaves us all blind because people are consumed with hatred and revenge for those who have done them wrong. Feeling this hatred people become blind, and not able to see that there are other ways out of the situation like to forgive. Not seeing this, people are left in a continuous circle of revenge and hate not being able to see a way out, no body wins and everybody continues to lose. This quote is similar to “two wrongs don’t make a right”. I am interested with this quote because it is an interesting double layer play on words. No one can see when everyone takes an eye for every eye they lose.       Although I do not go to church every often my sisters and I use to sit down and read parts of the bible out loud together before we went to bed. When reading the quote “An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind” it stirred a memory of my sister once explaining a story in the bible that was quite similar. In the bible it is stating how if a neighbour blinds another neighbour, the family has the right to blind them back, because revenge is said to set them back as equals.

20090202151102AA007rn	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	GPA requirements suck!?	I take all honors classes and one AP class as a sophomore. At my high school there are 3 levels of classes you can take. College prep being the easiest, then advanced, and then honors. If you are doing really well then you are able to take 1 AP class as a sophomore. Anyway, last year I took all honors classes and am doing the same this year. However, if you get an A in an advanced or honors class it is weighted as a 5.0 gpa for that class even though you do twice as much work for the honors class. It totally sucks and I feel as if I am being screwed over. I have a 4.1 gpa and am not eligible for NHS because you need a 4.2 gpa. However there are people who have taken all advanced classes and are in NHS. I don't even have bad grades they are all a's and high b's. Does this seem really unfair?

20090202150641AALFlAI	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	How do I choose between two high schools ?	Hi , I am in the eighth grade , so moving onto ninth next year. I've narrowed down my high school choices into two public schools. Once I choose, it is almost certain I will attend that school for the next 4 years.      School A: has an exclusive program that guarantees a spot for me, closer to my curent home than School B, specializes in Math/Science/Technology (so plenty of post-secondary opportunities), the school facilities are brand-new, and the program only accepted 10% of those who tried out. HOWEVER, none of my friends are going here, it is in a questionable neighbourhood, I'm unsure if the sciences are what I'm going to pursue post-secondary, and I'm not sure if the program is suited for me.      School B: I would stay in the current "enriched" program I am in, but it is not guarenteed I have a spot at this school; focuses equally on almost all strands of the curriculum, a bit closer to the heart of my city (further from my home), is one of the largest, oldest, and most well known schools in the city, and nearly all my friends are going. HOWEVER, the school is rather old and shabby looking, if I were to take AP classes they would be after school, it is extremely competitive, with 2000 students, and it is known for its drug usage.      I only have 3 days to decide where I want to go; so far, its about equal either way. I wish to pursue perhaps something in law, or the sciences, in my future...again, very unsure. In a way , leaving my friends would be "starting over" again...which is good in some senses , terrible in others.      Could I have some insight on what to do please?   Thanks in advance.

And I really do not like this school at all and I feel like I'm smarter then everyone here. I'm actually missing Minnesota alot, it was just too far but everything else was awesome and I regret leaving. I'm only here for a transition school, I figured it was better to go to school then take a semester off no matter where I was. I can't relate too much to anyone here and they're known for Business and Teaching but I am a Chemistry major. Would it be so bad to transfer again to either UW Madison or Marquette University where I feel more my level? How do employers look at transferring 3 times? I would definitely stay put at my next school. I know I'm not going to stay here I just want opinions on how to get through the semester of boredom and wondering if it matters cause its only my freshman year. Thanks.

That aside , My Mom went to pick up my little brother from school , and he wasn't there ... my mom had an idea of who may have picked him up , but to assure herself she asked the teacher who had picked up my little brother , and she dryly replied " I don't know " and goes about her Business .     Now , I would think that after class is out , the teacher would come out to check if the kids are getting picked up by familiar people ...

Imagine you've called the parents 5 times, and you never see them during report card pick-up, how does it make you feel when the blame is put on the teachers for having to lower the standards because the kids cannot do the work? Or how about the fact that you don't lower the standards... but imagine you have an entire class who does not do homework and maybe 4 out of 30 kids constantly do the work... do you move ahead or do you force feed the kids who can't get their act together?    What do you say to the critics who blame the teacher and not the parents?

It's my first year teaching, and I've been battling the problem with getting my students to read at home and staying engaged when reading in class. If they aren't interested in it, forget it. (My 8th graders are reading Call of the Wild, and hating every minute of it). What ends up happening is I just read everything aloud to them in class to make up for what they didn't read at home, clarify what they don't understand, and we end up having less time to do some fun activities with the book. I'll have students read aloud too, they have writing prompts, double entry journals, open book questions, etc.... but I'm struggling to come up with ways to keep them engaged. I don't want them to think of reading as a boring, grueling task. I have a book on this but none of these strategies have really worked. Some advice would be appreciated! Especially if you've taught this book before.

20090202153506AArV0hb	Education & Reference;Teaching	Was my ELA teacher wrong in doing this???!!?	Ok so 2 years ago when i was in the 9th grade i was trying really hard to pass school so i wouldn't have to go to summer school or get kept back. But i had ALOT of absence's so i had to make up all the work in all my classes that i had missed (including ELA) wich was never the less ALOT of work to do. But i still put a great deal of effort into doing as much as i could. But i honestly dont know if everything i had done for my make up work was correct or not. But other then that everything in my ELA class that i was doing at the same time as other students i was doing really good,always getting good grades on my tests and doing my home work good and all that. Even the make work i was getting back were showing that i was getting really good grades. And i even asked my ELA teacher b4 the grades came out what she thought i might get. And she told me probably a "B" or "C" wich might let me be able to pass. And right when she was giving us our grades for the last semester i had really thought i had done all my make up work cause she never told me i had anymore. Then i see that i got an "F"!!!. On my report card not even a D or something. And i confronted her about that. And she told me "Oh well, you didnt do all ur make up work thats why". And you didnt get everything correct on your make up work as well. But i told her then if i did have more work left y didnt u tell me i did and why were u saying i was going to get good grades b4 u gave me my report card,and y did u give me good grades on all my makeup work if i didnt get them all "correct"?. She didnt say nothing and just got defensive and thought i was getting to upset?. and because of her i had to go to summer school and even my teacher in summer school said u got the highest score on ur ELA exam so y are u here?. lol so was what she did right or wrong??? please be honest...   Because that 2 face bitc* really ****** up my school life,and the screwed up part is that my mom believes the teacher over me no matter what i say!!.

20090202160055AAvhN5i	Education & Reference;Special Education	My speech needs to be 5 min and its only 4 1/2 min...i really need help with my conclusion!?	Each year 100 million animals are used worldwide in experiments.  They are used mainly to test the toxicity levels of anything from cleaning products to medications.  There are many arguments for and against this practice, but for many people one fact remains the same, using animals in a cruel manor is wrong.  There are two main reasons for conducting animal experimentation, first, to find out more about the animals themselves, and, secondly, to test substances and procedures to see if they are harmful to humans.  There is a growing consensus that it is not acceptable to test cosmetic products on animals. The debate is about whether we should experiment on animals for scientific and medical purposes.     Past experience has shown what invaluable advances can be made in medicine by experimenting on animals, and that live animals are the most reliable subjects for testing medicines and other products for toxicity.  Testing on animals has helped develop vaccines for many life threatening diseases and viruss related to organ transplantation rejection.  In addition to this, animal testing has also helped in the improvement of procedures related to measuring the blood pressure, and pacemaker technology.  In fact, many of the medications vaccines and surgical techniques used today would not be around if it were not for animal testing.  Supporters for animal testing argue that research is justified because it assists in discovering ways to help people and other animals for the future. Animal testing has also helped other animals, for example the heartworm medication that was devised from research on animals has assisted many dogs. Cat nutrition has been better understood through animal research and has assisted cats to live longer and healthier lives.  The major problem most people have with animal testing is that in many cases it is not carried out humanely.  Many of the animals used are kept in terrible conditions with little care, and when they are not needed anymore they are killed.  The critics of animal testing base their argument on the grounds of morality, the necessity these procedures, and whether it is being carried out by people with proper authority to perform such tests.  Deaths through research are considered unnecessary and are morally not different from murder.  Others argue that the reaction of an animal to a drug is quite different than that of a human being. In the United States there are products that are required by law to be tested on animals before becoming available for Human use.  For example the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency requires by law that pesticides be tested on dogs, who are shoved into inhalation chambers where they are exposed to deadly poisons being pumped into their chambers, the FDA requires that companies marketing fluoride products, such as toothpaste, swab the teeth of 200 rats with the test substance for two weeks, at which time the animals are killed.  It is seen by many people as unfair to the animals, they have the right to life just as any human does, and there are alternatives to these practices.  In many cases it would, however, be difficult to test new drugs or chemicals on anything but animals.  When testing on animals has the possibility of curing a disease, or preventing toxic chemicals from entering the shelves for the public to ingest, it becomes seemingly impossible to find a way to put an end to this practice.  There are other ways animals can be tested.  In many cases it is not necessary for the animal to be euthanized after their research period is over but in almost all of these cases they are killed.  Without getting to deep into the science of it there are ways to test new drugs and medical advances that are harmless to humans and animals, with the technological advances of todays society there are some research firms which use only human tissues and advanced computer technology in the process of drug development and testing, in some cases this method has proven to be more effective than the tests used on animals. Now and in the future computer models can be used to devise the reaction of a drug to the animal; as a result it would eliminate the necessity for live animal experimentations.  The development to the extensive application of substitutes to animal experimentation will persistently gain momentum as people become more aware about the problem.   Though it is hard to eliminate animal testing completely, consumers can prevent the unnecessary animal testing by boycotting certain products that dont necessary require animal testing. To conclude, all we as humans can do now is to try to reduce the number of animals being harmed in these experiments aimed at benefiting society.

20090202164751AAcJIHP	Education & Reference;Teaching	Is this problem the teachers or students? 3/4 of the students failed the first test. I HATE CHEMISTRY!?	Our class is Monday, Wednesday & Friday.  We have a 2 hour lecture on monday, 2 hour lab on Wednesday, and a 1 hour lecture on Fridays.  She breezed through 4 chapters and when she finished the 4th last Monday she said ok..test Friday!  We had to memorize conversions and the periodic table and a few other things for this test that she didn't give a review on nor even help with a few things of would be on the test.  She uses an online power point presentation to go over the chapters and somewhat explains how to do some of the things.  We got our tests back today and 3/4 of the students failed the test.  When a student asked if we could have a retake of it she said no, so the student asked whose rule that was, hers or the science department.  She said that it was the science departments rule, so the girl said well obviously there is something wrong with over half of the class failing and the teacher came back with, "yes and most of the mistakes were math mistakes and I am not a math teacher I am a chemistry teacher." I personally think that if math is involved, she needs to teach us how to do it regardless because that is how you solve the problems and if you can't do the math part then you can't pass the class.  Also, when asked for a test review before a test she told us that we are limited to days to go over a number of chapters and that there is no time for a review!  Is it me or is she just a terrible teacher?  Should she not be going over the "math" part and giving reviews if that is what it takes, because it's making her look bad as a teacher as well!  Should I go to student services and speak with a counselor about a solution for this whether it be possibly changing classes or even a refund if the teacher is unwilling to help the students when we are the ones who pay for it and need it for our degrees?! (this is a college class)  What do you think?        NO SMART/RUDE REMARKS OR COMMENTS!

20090202160544AAicWze	Education & Reference;Home Schooling	Is un-schooling a good idea in this case?	I’m not sure what to do because I really can’t stand school anymore. Its not that I’m to “lazy” to do the work or I am to “unintelligent” its just that I simply feel very unhappy whenever I step foot inside a school. I have never been home schooled to any sort; I have always gone to pubic school, and right now I am in grade 10 and I still hate it very much. I have social anxiety which is a huge part of the problem. However I notice that I can interact with people normally anywhere but in school. I have around 5+ panic attacks a day and that’s just in the halls. Today I started a new semester and my English teacher said “We will be doing a lot of group work and debates” and I just started freaking out inside my head. I find it completely useless when teachers make me do “group work or presentations or debates” because I do not ever learn anything from it and in fact become completely angry. And I’m sure this will get a lot of comments saying “Its just because of your anxiety you will get used to it, if you stop school now you will interact with people even worse”, but I never get used to it. It makes me unbelievably frustrated and very unhappy, and it only happens in school. I also find a lot of what I learn completely useless except for the basics in Math, science, English ect. And I feel the need to learn what I want and need to learn rather then what people think I need to learn for me. For this reason I was thinking of any other forms of education. I know my mom won’t “unschool” me because she is too busy, so I was thinking of schooling myself. I live in Canada and am in grade 10. I feel very mature for my age, and I do want to become successful. Is this a good idea or do you have any other suggestions?   Thanks!

20090202162710AA4gfLY	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	How different is college from High School for dating?	In High School, either people have really clicked in their relationships or only certain people date, some really good guys and girls never actually date while in High School, and for me, I'd love to, but I came into this High School being the new kid in the middle of freshman year and so I have a reputation for being the quiet kid that I just can't seem to break out of. I'm actually pretty sociable but it's hard to be when people think that you don't want to be talked to, so in College, for those who have gone through the transfer, how much can your reputation really change? Because obviously there's some reason for you getting a lasting impression in the first place.      So what I'm asking, is how much can your reputation change and does pretty much everyone date? How likely is it that someone is interested in a real relationship, because I know the college kid stereotype of dating for sex, wild parties, etc., I know it's a lot of Hollywood in that, but even Hollywood has a basis for it's assumptions.

I'm getting ready to enter college because I've finally decided what I want to be. I've always known I loved criminal justice and helping figure out what to do when people find themselves in the hands of justice. I was a juvenile corrections officer for several years and I love criminal justice, but I found that I enjoyed helping the kids and trying to find out what/why things happened and how to prevent it from happening again, or to get these kids some sort of help if they were looking for it. That led me to realize that what I'm wanting to do is criminal psychology, but I can't seem to find what I would take to become one. I know that I can get a bachelor's degree in psychology, but how do I get the emphasis to be into the criminal side of it? Do I need a minor in criminal justice?
