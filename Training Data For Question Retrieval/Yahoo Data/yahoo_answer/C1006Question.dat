20090223132752AArwsXx	Sports;Football (Soccer);Men's Premiere Leagues (UK)	Can you please help save Weymouth Football Club?	In all honesty, I'm not a massive Weymouth fan and I haven't been to one of their games. Although, I have been to the area on holiday and I take a strong interest in their results and have done for many years. I would go to a few of their games but I live in London.       However, as you may already know, the club are on the brink of going into administration which could result in them eventually going out of existence. They are offering one million shares at just 50p each. I know times are tough at the minute with the recession and everything but I, on behalf of all Weymouth supporters, would really appreciate it if you could make any contribution. Even the smallest donation would help the club.      If you would like to read more then please visit  http://www.theterras.co.uk  or  http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football...       If you would like to make a donation then please go to  http://www.theterras.co.uk/sharerequest....       Thank you very much.

I done s Survey before to who people here think was The Greatest WWE Superstar for what they done for The Business rather than they're popularity asking to name Top 5 and working on a PTS system. The outcome was Stone Cold in 1st followed by The Undertaker, Hulk Hogan, Ric Flair and HBK.      Now I want to know who is evryone's alltime Favs. Pick from WWE/F, TNA, WCW or The Old ECW. As most people have more than 1 fav I would like you to pick 5 listing them from 1st to 5th then I will count up the scores and find out who is The Most Popular and The People's faviorte of All Time.      For Each Superstar and Diva in each Answer the PTS will work like this   1st receives 10 PTS   2nd 7 PTS   3rd 5 PTS   4th 3 PTS   5th 1 PTS      Please do a Top 5 for Superstars and Diva's      I have only asked for thoose certain Brands as there are many people here including myself who do not have a Full Knowledge of other Promotions i.e Japanesse or ROH etc and this would not be justified in the scores, but if you would like to give a Special Mention then you can. Also if you wish you can say why you have choosen each Superstar and Diva, but these parts are optional.      Thanks for you opinions

20090223141845AA5ZGQ7	Sports;Football (Soccer);Scottish Football (Soccer)	Is it inevitable that bigots will try to spoil the forum if their rivals overtake their team in the league ?	Sadly, I expected no less from the likes of Greenbrigade, Hun Slayer, Caine etc, as soon as the Celtic game finished yesterday and Rangers remained at the top of the league as a result.  They did not dissapoint.  The same people who just a few short weeks ago were gleefully cracking jokes about Rangers being bankrupt, the league being over, etc now revert back to the knuckle-scraping stuff.        It would have been exactly the same from the other side if the roles were reversed.  I would imagine that real fans of Celtic will be dissapointed and embarrassed by this behaviour, there would be Rangers fans doing the same I have no doubt.      Don't these people know where to draw the line ?        Why don't they realise they have a problem ?      Can you imagine what it will be like at the end of the season, if they are acting like that when goal difference seperates the teams with loads of games left ?      Will the sheer amount of violations received result in accounts being suspended, to the mercy of one and all ?

See, the thing about our coach is that he takes points! We've had like three drills that he took points on, and i hate pressure, so i ended up sucking butt, and failed misserably. With no pressure, i'm pretty okay, but with pressure i look soccer illiterate. Our tryouts have been like 3 weeks long, and i'm f-ing bombing them. I'm really good when i've actually made the team, but tryouts are like a huge exam to me, and i just hate pressure, and that's what tryouts are to me-'pure pressure'. Any tips, should i just stop, because i think i'm already too low to pull myself up. I'm so agrivated.

20090223142453AAqZCfb	Sports;Wrestling	Why are you so upset about wrestling going to pg now?	Here is my point.   Before the attitude era was what a lot of people has referred to as a good wrestling time period.The era when we had all the greats in their prime such as:hogan,steamboat,flair,and most of the current hall of famers came from that time.There was a lot of good matches in those days that are considered classics now.I know I have been people on here ask why do they not go back to the way it was when they started watching it.That is what they are slowly getting back to doing.      So what is wrong with them doing that if they are trying to recapture what made wrestling good in the first place.You wanted the women wrestlers to wrestle more and not being just eye candy.That's what we are seeing with beth phoenix,gail kim,and many of the other female wrestlers.
20090223141005AABvslC	Sports;Baseball	Become a stronger catcher.?	Right now I am 5'10 160, and a 15 year old freshman in high school. I love playing baseball, though it is my second sport behind hockey. I play straight up the middle. catcher, pitcher, shortstop, second base. When pitching i throw around 83-84, and back it up with a 70mph changeup, while mixing in a curve occassionally. I love playing catcher and short, and i throw out 45% of runners from behind the plate. I was wondering what some good weight routines were to make sure that i am prepared to tryout for varsity, or at least give it a strong shot. Just give me some tips on how to become better, all around.. Also my speed is not very good, its average, but i'd love to become a five tool player instead of like a four. thanks.

20090223144456AAQpmXe	Sports;Wrestling	Just a random Question, but DID or DO your parents ever stop you from Watching Wrestling?	Mine did, when I was younger. I used to watch a bit of WCW years ago when I was about 6 or 7, maybe a little older, but my mum would not allow me to watch it and I completely missed the whole Take over of WCW and ECW plus The Attitude Era. I then forgot about it all and became one of those who went around saying 'Wrestling is Fake' etc, I'm ashamed to say it, but I guess it was because all my friends at school could watch it and I couldn't. I then started watching it because of a friend, we were bored and decided to try out a Wrestling Game for the Xbox, then we started watching it. First show I really watched was Unforgiven 2007 only because they had a thing about The Undertaker returning and he was someone I had heard of and liked back when I did watch it. I then changed my opinion on it all and started watching full time.      And my mother still doesn't like it and tells me not to watch it even tho I'm nearly 24. lol Have a girlfriend who sounds just like her as well and says if we have kids they'll not be watching it.      This brings me to my sceond Question Would you or do you let your children watch Wrestling what ever age they are?

Say for the money in the bank matches they didn't tell you who was in it and it was left as a surprise.Then it would be so hard to predict the winner of the matches because a lot of people wouldn't even know who was going to be in the match.   You wouldn't know who undertakers opponent was until there music hit and they came out.

I was at work this morning and overheard some older customers who had watched the race say that "Jr is losing a lot of fans, and he's already lost me" and so I wondered if Jr had lost anymore fans on here due to his very poor results the last few seasons as his chances for a championship are very low once drivers are this deep into their career.      I mean right now there is a very good chance that he will have to race his way into the shows within the next few races because he's a very bad 35th place in points. I just dont understand why he is that popular right now with NO results backing it up in the last few years. Has he lost any fans on here since his career started? If not why? he certainly isn't even one of the best racers currently out there and seems to have many other distractions and continously doesn't produce and lets his fans down in my opinion.

Sources also tell TSN that the blessing has yet to be granted, but the NHL's head office is now involved in an attempt to resolve the situation.          Also, this doesn't bode well for Avery as we learned from him being an analyst that he HATES Sean Avery.........an interesting twist!
