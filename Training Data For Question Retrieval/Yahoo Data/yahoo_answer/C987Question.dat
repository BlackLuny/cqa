Felicidades a mis cuates (y a los que me aborrecen) por el gran resultado de su equipo, al final confiar en la gente de casa da mejores resultados que traer al mejor tecnico del mundo solo porque es Argentino o solo porque cobra muy caro.      Me da gusto por Juan Antonio Luna.
20080508120133AA6wQ3m	Sports;Football (Soccer);Mexican Football (Soccer)	?Es una gran haza?a irrepetible?	Si seguimos pensando que esto de ayer fue una gran haza?a y que es historico, a lo mejor va a pasar mucho tiempo para que se repitan estos resultados en Mexico.      Que tal si mejor pensamos que es un buen triunfo y que como esos en Mexico podemos dar muchos mas.      En lugar de considerarlo como una haza?a de nuestro deporte y nosotros mismos frenarnos pensando que nunca se volvera a hacer.      Cuando la Sub17 gano su mundial la calificamos de haza?a y luego ya ni se califico al siguiente mundial.      Dejemoslo en un muy buen triunfo, y un paso mas, ganar la Copa Libertadores esa si seria una gran haza?a.      Mucha suerte.

El Maracanazo uruguayo (algunos descerebrados lo comparan con lo de ayer) sirvió para ganar una Copa del Mundo, ?El Mariconazo del América para que servira?       ?Para avanzar a Cuartos y quedar eliminados otra vez por el Santos?      Ojalá que el América tuviera mejor plantel para en serio pelear por la Copa, pero vamos a ser sinceros, lo de ayer fue un golpe de suerte que no creo que alcance para que ganen la Copa (lo unico que al final de cuentas importa).       Saludos.

I accidently made one bad pass, and i said sorry, my bad, and she gave me a really mean look and said yeah it was. Then told the group that if you couldn't take care of the ball you'd be sitting on the bench with her. I am trying as hard as I can, and she can't see that at all, she thinks I'm dumb (because i messed up tiny little details on two drills) It's driving me crazy that can not get her approvial because I am trying sooo hard!

Em 19 de novembro de 1969, em um Santos x Vasco no Maracan?, Pelé marcou seu milésimo gol ao vencer o goleiro Andrada em uma cobran?a de pênalti que entrou para a história do futebol. Pela primeira vez, um jogador profissional alcan?ava, comprovadamente, a marca dos mil gols. àquela altura, Pelé tinha 29 anos e participara das conquistas das copas de 1958 e 1962 pela sele??o brasileira. Por seu clube, o Santos, já tinha se sagrado bicampe?o da Libertadores da América e do Mundial Interclubes em 1962 e 1963. A história pode se repetir neste domingo (1o/4), no mesmo Maracan?, quando o atacante vascaíno Romário, aos 41 anos, tem a chance de marcar seu milésimo gol em uma partida contra o Botafogo. ídolo nos anos 80 e 90 em todos os clubes que jogou e na sele??o, o "Baixinho" foi fundamental para tirar o Brasil de 40 anos de "fila" na Copa América de 1989 e do jejum de 24 anos sem títulos mundiais em 1994. Ao longo de sua carreira, Romário colecionou gols, títulos e polêmicas. A última delas diz respeito justamente ao número vezes que balan?ou as redes. Segundo seus críticos, Romário n?o  poderia incluir na contabilidade os 98 gols que marcou antes de se tornar profissional e em partidas festivas. Para você, os mil gols de Romário valem tanto quanto os de Pelé?

Aujourd hui je ne supporte plus le proprio, il se met a pretendre que chasue fois qu il recupere le cheval apres que je l ai monté, il doit se facher grave pour obtenir qq chose de lui. (meme les jours ou je n ai pas monté je suis mise en cause).(alor qu il y a 1 semaine il disait que le cheval n avait jamais eté aussi bien, a tel point qu il ne savait plus quoi faire ! )        Mon mono me propose une dp sur une jument de club, une 5 ans, contrairement a mon cheval actuel qui en a 10. Mais comme je ne fais que du dress, il la voit bien pour moi car tout le monde dit qu elle dress super bien mais bon elle a 5 ans et bcp de travail reste a faire. Neanmoins il me voit bien dessus et pense qu en plus son caractere me conviendra. De plus ?a l arrange car cette jument saute comme une quiche alors il aime autant la filer a qqun qui veut dresser.

He put so much effort into the tournament, his hero (Laver) was right behind him, he came so close to his 14th slam which was taken away just because of a small lapse in concentration.    The hardest thing overall for him to take was that even thouigh Nadal beat him the previous 4 times.. Most people including Fed still believed that Fed is currently the best in the game.. But that 4th game in the 5th when he was 30-0 up and then lost concentration is after truining his world. Most people now believe Nadal is the best right now (heartbreaking for Fed) and he knew there would be so many people questioning him - like the people on here who hide behind their computers all day making fun of somebody who has actually done something in their life as opposed to those worthless idiots with no friends.    And guess what.. NADAL SAID IN 2007 THAT WHEN HE LOST THE WIMBLEDON FINAL AND WENT BACK TO THE LOCKER ROOM HE (you guessed it) CRIED!!!    It just so happens that Fed cried 10 minutes earlier than any other tennis player (including himself) usually would..    So get over it..

20090203091040AAaVBs4	Sports;Football (Soccer);Men's Premiere Leagues (UK)	Shouldn't loyalty go both ways?	It seems like us fans are only concerned with player loyalty to their clubs, but never club loyalty to the players.  We're OK with the fact a club can throw around their players like pieces of meat, but we're quick to criticize a player that wants to move from his club.   Arsenal fans are a prime example of this, throwing around the term "Cashly Cole" because Cole decided to move to Chelsea.  But would they turn on Arsenal if the had sold Cole out of nowhere? Never.  Another example was C. Ronaldo's desire to play for Real Madrid, so all ManU fans turned on him.  But would you ever turn on ManU if they decide to sell Ronaldo even if Ronaldo desires to stay in Manchester?  Never.

I'm going to be buying myself  A gun when I'm 18 and I only plan on shooting it at ranges and maybe at some events, but not hunting, in any case, I wanted to know if I would need any kind of license just to take the gun to a local range and shoot it.  I'm located in California (L.A.) and I already know of rifle ranges I would be going to.  I was told you need a special license to carry the gun, but I don't know if "carrying" the gun simply means to take it to the local range, sorry if my question is hard to understand, but thanks for the help.
