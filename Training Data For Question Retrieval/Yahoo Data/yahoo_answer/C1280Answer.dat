It has to do with your skin and exposure to humid air. New York or Florida or where-ever makes no matter. If the temperature is the same and the relative humidity is the same, YOU will feel the same. Now, you have expectations, which can psychologically affect how you feel, so you may imagine you feel colder when the conditions are the same in both places simply you expect one place to be colder than the other. Now, as to how humidity affects YOU, humidity affects the rate sweat evaporates off the surface of your skin. Regardless of the temperature, you sweat ALL the time. You are losing water every minute of every day. What changes is the rate of loss. Exercise a lot and you sweat a lot. Sit on a couch and you sweat little until the temperature in the room rises to near your body temperature and then even doing virtually nothing and you can sweat profusely. The more humid the air, and the less air flow around you, the harder it is to evaporate the sweat and the hotter you feel. I'm betting the humidity was higher in New York than it was where you were in Florida, which would mean you would feel warmer in NY than FL with the same temperature in each place. It only takes a few percent difference for you to feel the difference in evaporation rate and feel warmer in one place relative to another.

Especially as I am aware that sometimes they're worse than placebos.<br>  <br>  Prozac can cause interactions with other drugs, which can nullify the drug or even create more problems.<br>  <br>  GPs prefer not to prescribe prozac because of the serious problems associated with it, and counselling can often be of more benefit to the patient.<br>  <br>  A common misconception is that prozac is a 'happy pill'. It doesn't however make you happy, it actually takes away the extremes of emotion. So you don't get depressed but you also don't get ecstatically happy.<br>  <br>  Just thought you should know some of the problems associated with prozac, there'll be more documented on the internet.|`|bc672f6eb9191dfc00d1b8146c3ccbbfaa	prozac is an adictive drug that when its time to come of them u have ti ween of them slowly...can take months or even yrs i have been told..<br>  and also some pppl have to take a counter drug to avoid some of the side affects that can occour......<br>  <br>  put it this way if my wife was adviced to take them from the doctor id tell the wife not to take them.....<br>  <br>  good luck|`|AA11884807	Possibly:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A42930-2002May6?language=printer" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn...</a><br>  <br>  The Article:<br>  <br>  Against Depression, a Sugar Pill Is Hard to Beat<br>  <br>  Placebos Improve Mood, Change Brain Chemistry in Majority of Trials of Antidepressants<br>  <br>  By Shankar Vedantam<br>  <br>  Washington Post Staff Writer<br>  <br>  Tuesday, May 7, 2002; Page A01<br>  <br>  After thousands of studies, hundreds of millions of prescriptions and tens of billions of dollars in sales, two things are certain about pills that treat depression: Antidepressants like Prozac, Paxil and Zoloft work. And so do sugar pills.<br>  <br>  A new analysis has found that in the majority of trials conducted by drug companies in recent decades, sugar pills have done as well as -- or better than -- antidepressants. Companies have had to conduct numerous trials to get two that show a positive result, which is the Food and Drug Administration's minimum for approval.<br>  <br>  What's more, the sugar pills, or placebos, cause profound changes in the same areas of the brain affected by the medicines, according to research published last week. One researcher has ruefully concluded that a higher percentage of depressed patients get better on placebos today than 20 years ago.<br>  <br>  Placebos -- or dud pills -- have long been used to help scientists separate the "real" effectiveness of medicines from the "illusory" feelings of patients. The placebo effect -- the phenomenon of patients feeling better after they've been treated with dud pills -- is seen throughout the field of medicine. But new research suggests that the placebo may play an extraordinary role in the treatment of depression -- where how people feel spells the difference between sickness and health.<br>  <br>  The new research may shed light on findings such as those from a trial last month that compared the herbal remedy St. John's wort against Zoloft. St. John's wort fully cured 24 percent of the depressed people who received it, and Zoloft cured 25 percent -- but the placebo fully cured 32 percent.<br>  <br>  The confounding and controversial findings do not mean that antidepressants do not work. But clinicians and researchers say the results do suggest that Americans may be overestimating the power of the drugs, and that the medicines' greatest benefits may come from the care and concern shown to patients during a clinical trial -- a context that does not exist for millions of patients using the drugs in the real world.<br>  <br>  "The drugs work, and I prescribe them, but they are not what they are cracked up to be," said Wayne Blackmon, a Washington psychiatrist whose practice largely comprises patients who suffer from depression. "I know from clinical experience the drugs alone don't do the job."|`|zFsTSrOcaa	Prozac works for me, with no serious side effects, and it is not addictive.  If I run out, I gradually return to my baseline depression over several weeks.  Everyone is different, though, so see your doctor or therapist.  Some people may need to try several antidepressants before finding one that works well without side effects, and mild depression may respond to counseling without the need for medication.<br>  <br>  Also, if you're depressed for good reason, because of something that's happened in your life, it means you're normal.

AWPaPV4Eaa	Things like ambient lighting and spot lighting are ways to cast light on an object or scene.  You could accomplish each with a number of different light sources, so I don't really see how you could give cost information for these topics.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you could approach the topic in at least two ways: as you have, by listing ways that light can illuminate something, or by listing light sources such as incandescent bulbs, fluorescent bulbs, candles, LEDs, etc.  With the latter method, you could give cost; with the former, you could talk about how it is used in art and design (as it seems you have done already).  So I would say your answer works, unless your teacher wanted you to do light sources specifically.

FY4cCjsOaa	1) If there are 4 points on a straight line and other 10 points no three of which are collinear, what is the greatest possible number of triangles that can be formed with these points as vertices?<br>  <br>  I assume that none of the "other 10" are on that straight line with the 4 collinear points.<br>  <br>  Each of the other 10 can form a triangle with any pair of the collinear points. There are <br>  4C2 = 4! / (2! 2!) = 6 ways to pick a pair from the collinear points, so there are<br>  10 * 6 = 60 such triangles.<br>  <br>  Any three of the other 10 can also form a triangle. There are <br>  10C3 = 10! / (7! 3!) = 120 such triangles.<br>  <br>  Any of the 4 collinear points can form a triangle with any 2 of the other 10. There are<br>  10C2 = 10! / (8! 2!) = 45 ways to choose those 2 points, so there are<br>  4 * 45 = 180 such triangles.<br>  <br>  60 + 120 + 180 = 360 triangles<br>  <br>  2) Four letters are written and four envelopes addressed. In how many ways can all the letters be placed in the wrong envelopes?<br>  <br>  There are 4! = 24 ways to match letters to envelopes. Of these,<br>  <br>  1 way is with all letters in the correct envelopes;<br>  <br>  4C2 = 6 ways have two letters in correct envelopes and the other two in each others' envelopes;<br>  <br>  4 * 2 = 8 ways have one letter in the correct envelope and the other three in wrong ones. (There are four choices for the one in the correct envelope. There are only two ways to swap envelopes among the other three: once you have chosen from the two possible wrong envelopes for one letter, you have only one choice for the letter that belonged in that envelope that avoids putting the last one in the correct envelope.)<br>  <br>  There is no way to get three letters in the correct envelopes and one in the wrong one.<br>  <br>  So the number of ways to get all of them in the wrong envelopes is<br>  24 - (1 + 6 + 8) = 9<br>  <br>  3) A committee of 6 is chosen from 8 women and 5 men so as to contain at least 3 women and 2 men. In how many different ways can this be done if 2 particular men refuse to serve on the same committee.<br>  <br>  The committee can be 4 women and 2 men or it can be 3 of each gender.<br>  <br>  There are <br>  8C4 = 8! / (4! 4!) = 70 ways to choose 4 women.<br>  There are<br>  5C2 = 5! / (3! 2!) = 20 ways to choose 2 men, one of which we have to exclude because the two won't serve together.<br>  <br>  There are <br>  8C3 = 8! / (5! 3!) = 56 ways to choose 3 women.<br>  There are <br>  5C3 = 20 ways to choose 3 men, 3 of which we have to exclude (any combination of the two who won't serve together, plus one of the other three).<br>  <br>  So there are a total of<br>  70 * 19 + 56 * 17 = 1330 + 952 = 2282 possible committees.

Gnfc4wRlaa	It depends on what your instructor and/or the author of your textbook define as immediate.  It appears that the move to eliminate CFC's from aerosols was immediate, but interest declined, then was renewed.  The Montreal Protocol wasn't until 11-13 years after the 1976 report.  I would say there was a limited immediate response by the U.S.  You can check out these sites and your textbook to see whether the answer should be True or False because it is kind of a gray area.<br>  <br>  After a 1976 report by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences concluded that credible scientific evidence supported the ozone depletion hypothesis, a few countries, including the United States, Canada, Sweden, and Norway, moved to eliminate the use of CFCs in aerosol spray cans. At the time this was widely regarded as a first step towards a more comprehensive regulation policy, but progress in this direction slowed in subsequent years, due to a combination of political factors (continued resistance from the halocarbon industry and a general change in attitude towards environmental regulation during the first two years of the Reagan administration) and scientific developments (subsequent National Academy assessments which indicated that the first estimates of the magnitude of ozone depletion had been overly large). The European Community rejected proposals to ban CFCs in aerosol sprays while even in the U.S., CFCs continued to be used as refrigerants and for cleaning circuit boards. Worldwide CFC production fell sharply after the U.S. aerosol ban, but by 1986 had returned nearly to its 1976 level. In 1980, DuPont closed down its research program into halocarbon alternatives.<br>  <br>  The US Government's attitude began to change again in 1983, when William Ruckelshaus replaced Anne M. Burford as Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Under Ruckelshaus and his successor, Lee Thomas, the EPA pushed for an international approach to halocarbon regulations. In 1985 20 nations, including most of the major CFC producers, signed the Vienna Convention which established a framework for negotiating international regulations on ozone-depleting substances. That same year, the discovery of the Antarctic ozone hole was announced, causing a revival in public attention to the issue. In 1987, representatives from 43 nations signed the Montreal Protocol.<br>  <br>  Due to scientific evidence that CFCs and other chemicals destroy ozone in the upper atmosphere, the United States, the country which has traditionally been the largest emitter of CFCs worldwide, is rapidly scaling back the use of these chemicals and phasing out their production.<br>  <br>  Long predicted, the degradation of the ozone layer was dramatically confirmed when a large hole  in the layer over Antarctica was reported in 1985. Smaller but significant stratospheric decreases have been seen over more populated regions of the Earth. Subsequent research established that industrial chemicals are responsible for the observed depletions of ozone over Antarctica and play a major role in global ozone losses.<br>  <br>  Reacting to the environmental threat of ozone depletion, the nations of the world came together to create a global treaty, the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer. The agreement entered into force in 1988 and the subsequent Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer entered into force in 1989.<br>  <br>  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA), under authority of the U.S. Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, issued regulations for the phaseout of production and importation of ozone-depleting chemicals controlled under the Protocol through a marketable permit program. In addition, EPA established controls on refrigerant recycling to prevent emissions in both motor vehicle and stationary systems , a ban on nonessential products, labeling requirements, a program to review safe alternative substances, and requirements to revise federal procurement specifications. Under the regulations, surplus or recycled substances can in general be stored to service existing machinery.

If you take two real numbers, and dig deep enough between them, you will find an irrational number. Likewise, if you take two irrational numbers and dig deep enough between them, you will find a rational number. <br>  <br>  Thus, the function is continuous for no values of x.|`|Sn9KZ8ANaa	None.  For f to be continuous at any point x, for any ε, the difference between f(x+δ) and f(x) has to be less than ε.  But you can always find both rational and irrational numbers less than δ.<br>  <br>  Thanks to the answerer who recognized the function.|`|buLqy1b3aa	f is continuous for irrational numbers of x.<br>  <br>  When x is a rational number, f is never continuous.  This is because, if you convert the number to decimal form, the adjacent value of x is the current value plus 0.0000...1.  Only, the 1 approaches an infinite point.  In other words, the adjacent numbers must be irrational.<br>  <br>  Generally, when x is irrational, the adjacent numbers will also be irrational.
UtaNIzQUaa	water is necessary for a few reasons, and it will not dilute medication. Water helps the medicine get into the digestive tract where the medicine is absorbed. If you don't get the medicine into the stomach, some medicines can actually injure the throat above the stomach. Water helps medicine to dissolve - it has to dissolve to be absorbed in the stomach and the small intestines. PH isn't really an issue with most medicines.<br>  Here's a few tidbits: <br>  -tylenol(acetaminophen) is broken down quicker if you drink something acidy - OJ - for example, and it will give you relief sooner.<br>  -motrin(ibuprofen) should not be taken with something acid - they recommend milk or food - to avoid stomach upset<br>  -robitussin(guiafenessin) should be taken with a full 8 ounces of water in order for it to work properly. Before or after you take it doesn't really matter all that much -some people like the feeling of the cough medicine coating their throat, so are reluctant to drink after taking it. Robitussin works by pulling fluid from your system and putting it in the respiratory tract - thus coating irritated areas and thinning out secretions so you can cough them out! Good luck!

SYZQZGesaa	It isn't really. Back in the early days of radio and radar when large antennas were being installed to communicate with satellites, the theory of the Big Bang started. There was an unexplained back ground noise. When the back ground nose was further studied, it was concluded that it was uniform in that it was a single wave of signals originating from a single spot. MANY years later, it was found that - in fact - there were several different patterns coming from various different points. It is now thought that perhaps this is because of black holes, gamma ray bursts, etc. <br>  <br>  The only true supporting data of the certainty of a big bang is not data at all. It is more like logical theory. It all must have started somewhere so why not via a big bang. We are limited by how far we can look back in time because of the speed of light. This speed limit is why we reckon how old the universe is. <br>  <br>  Furthermore, it appears that we may not be expanding after all. Galaxies are colliding and it is not certain if this because of their gravity impression or that they are being propelled toward one another. In either case, the findings do not support expansion - in some cases.|`|a1VK1L64aa	Another set of evidence of the big bang came through studying the Doppler effect. This can be experienced by hearing a car drive past you and is represented is the change of pitch that the car makes from where you are standing. Analyzing this effect from the light that is received from the stars in our visible sky an origin point for the big bang has been deduced.<br>  <br>  While all are technology we have is pretty cool, we are yet to see the edge of the universe and know for certainty what exactly happened. We are getting closer though.|`|VYGViBb6aa	Well what happens when a bomb goes off or something explodes it goes outward expanding until it has consumed all energy available when the two thing a me bobs crashed they were going VERY VERY FAST so they kept expanding or at least thats what i think

AA10259042	There is specifically at least two things you require--a pair of binoculars, the most popular among bird watchers being 8x40 preferably roof prism and a copy of a birding guide book.  The National Geographic "Field Guide to Birds of North America" is a decent one if you live in North America.  There are guides published to the birds of other parts of the world also.  Most birders also have a spotting scope and tripod, but it is not absolutely necessary but very convenient and is of great use with shore birds and ducks especially. <br>  <br>  There are special areas where birds are very abundant during certain times of the year.  Crane Creek, Oh about 20 miles east of Toledo is one during the month of May.  It is common to see at least 50 different species of birds there during May as they stop there to rest before flying across Lake Erie.   There are other very popular locations where birders tend to go.  You can buy birding guides that tell you those places.  "Where the Birds Are" is one that I have.  I have many others besides.  Ecuador is a very popular destination for birders as is Costa Rica and Peru.  Each of those locations has many beautiful birds to see.  A special technique is to get up a the crack of dawn. That is when the birds are most active and easiest to find because the tend to sing from exposed perches then.|`|5iv8axUsaa	Well, basically, you need binoculars and a camera.<br>  You go to a place where there are lots of birds.<br>  You need to be quiet.<br>  Sometimes you can leave food out for them.<br>  I've never tried it, whenever i go to my backyard, the birds just fly away, the most interesting birds i've seen in my yard are a parrot and a cockatoo and a galah.<br>  I live in Australia, by the way.<br>  Cyas!|`|VSQYLWt6aa	There are special equipment/places/techniques, yes, but you learn those over time.<br>  It mainly consists of taking pictures of birds, and studying them in their natural environments.|`|lPfRzEKEaa	You use binoculars and a camera and you just look at them lol|`|PvV0aNvfaa	watchin birds|`|5nfqY9T7aa	It's about watching birds.

But if I were to guess its cause the water makes them lighter and easier to move?<br>  Despite their size, elephants are among the most gentle lovers in the animal kingdom. Every 3 to 6 months, both males and females experience a period of musth, during which they seek out a mate. Musth is an emotional state brought on by the temporal gland, located just beneath the skin midway between the car and the eye. The gland becomes swollen and secretes a dark strong-smelling substance which stains the lower part of the face. Once an elephant has found a suitable mate, the 2 will begin to flirt. The male offers the female food or squirts water over her back as she looks on nonchalantly. Finally, usually after a month, the female gives in and the male mounts her from the rear, gradually rising to an almost vertical position as he achieves full penetration. Afterward, the pair entwine trunks and swish their tails. <br>  <a href="http://www.hickerphoto.com/elephants-mating-205-pictures.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.hickerphoto.com/elephants-mat...</a>|`|De4vgWXPaa	They generally don't.

I don't know if I can give you a 1,2, 3 answer but the marketing strategy for the kiwi in the US well planed and successful. First they had a great product for sale, a delicious, attractive, and nutritious, fruit. Next they grew very well under the conditions in Southern California. They grew them in very large numbers. The growers realized that if they hit the market with this many kiwis that the price would drop to near zero, and it would likely be the end of the kiwi market. The growers organized and marketed only about the top ten percent of the biggest most perfect kiwis. The rest were sold as cattle and pig feed. The kiwis were marketed as a specialty, high priced, and rare fruit. The growers could sell the top 10% of their crop for far more than they could have sold the whole crop.|`|e04025e23b950e2f3fe00c64e34a3bf1aa	Kiwi's have come a long way.

15mbP1hqaa	After the Spanish colonization of the Americas, the Spanish distributed the tomato throughout their colonies in the Caribbean. They also took it to the Philippines, whence it moved to southeast Asia and then the entire Asian continent. The Spanish also brought the tomato to Europe. It grew easily in Mediterranean climates, and cultivation began in the 1540s. It was probably eaten shortly after it was introduced, and was certainly being used as food by the early 1600s in Spain. The earliest discovered cookbook with tomato recipes was published in Naples in 1692, though the author had apparently obtained these recipes from Spanish sources. However, in certain areas of Italy, such as Florence, the fruit was used solely as tabletop decoration before it was incorporated into the local cuisine in the late 17th or early 18th century.|`|e04025e23b950e2f3fe00c64e34a3bf1aa	early explorers brought them back together with beans and potatoes.

9v31wUz1aa	No - not at all. The Earth is rotating but the atmosphere is also rotating along with it. This means that everything that is flying in that atmosphere is also being pulled around too, so no matter what speed the object is travelling at it will still move relative to Earth's surface and not be affected by its rotation.|`|BWXZf6j4aa	It's all relative: What reference point do you chose.<br>  The earth is spinning at up to about 1000mph, if you jump up, you land back where you were because you (and the air) are also travelling at the same speed.  Similarly the helicopter is in the air so it is still travelling at the same relative speed to the ground.<br>  <br>  Also:<br>  the earth is travelling around the sun, the sun is travelling around the galaxy and the galaxy is also rotating- and moving away from other galaxies.<br>  <br>  If an object could truly stay in the same place with respect to the universe it would be millions of miles from earth within hours.|`|XiMQLv8Oaa	The Helicopter will stay in place... But...<br>  <br>  the orientation of the Helicopter will change relative to the Earth points of reference.  It will not stay fixed relative to North or South orientation.  What this means is this:<br>  <br>  Like the Foucalt Pendulum, the spinning tail  blades of the Helicopter will retain its orientation because of its Rotational inertia. If say, the Helicopter has its length aligned to point to a star in the horizon, provided that it becomes steady in hovering, it will stay pointed to the star, even if the Earth turns on its axis. If the Helicopter could sustain such hovering for half a day, then you will find that it will have reversed its orientation.|`|vUakEIWWaa	Very interesting question!!<br>  <br>  I'm guessing that perhaps the pull of the Earth's gravity will keep the chopper hovering above the same piece of land...<br>  But thats only a guess, I'm looking forward to seeing other answers! ^_^|`|AA11724052	If the question is will the helicopter continue to hover over one spot as the earth rotates on it's axis, the answer is yes.

gzLKVZJ3aa	Shantay is correct. A group of physicists at Weizmann Institute have actually demonstrated the existence of 'quasi particles' with one quarter the charge of an electron. The 'quantum Hall effect' predicted the existence of these quasi particles. or at least the fractional electron charges, over two decades ago. The Weizmann group found them about ten years ago.Electrons are indivisible...but if you confine them to a two-dimensional layer inside a semiconductor, lower their temperature to a fraction of a degree above absolute zero; and then  expose them to a strong magnetic field that is perpendicular to the layer, they effectively behave as independent particles. These are called quasi particles and they have charges smaller than that of an electron. Until very recently, these charges had always been found in fractions with odd denominators like 1/3 1/5, 1/7...but research student Merav Dolev in Prof. Moty Heiblum’s group, in collaboration with Drs. Vladimir Umansky and Diana Mahalu, and Prof. Ady Stern, all of the Condensed Matter Physics Department, at Weizmann Institute, changed that last year. There is an excellent article in the 6/5/2008 edition of ScienceDaily.

I know my answer is a bit sparse, but the research is still developing. The hope is that this discovery will actually get us one large step closer to the quantum computer. That's a  currently theoretical device that will make use of quantum mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement for computation. (Wikipedia has a good  and relatively concise explanation of the quantum computer at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computer" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_com...</a>  So much physics and so little time,eh?)|`|92f97d29e3d55f3219cc25dfabd347c7aa	I've never heard of a quasi particle.

It can be roughly defined as the combination of a particle and its influence on the local environment

X0e6p9Ilaa	The issue of the structure of the sulfate ion, and in particular the possibility of using single bonds vs double bonds comes up every year or two on the AP chemistry test.<br>  <br>  So I always cover the structure of sulfate with my AP chem students.  The bottom line is that sulfate is tetrahedral with 109.5 degree bond angles.  This tells us that it has sp3 hybridization.  <br>  <br>  Look at:<br>  <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Sulphat.png" rel="nofollow">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/co...</a><br>  <br>  If there were double bonds in SO4^2- then there must be unhybridized p-orbitals forming the double bonds.  This would change the structure of the of the sulfate ion and it would no longer agree with the experimentally measured bond angles.<br>  <br>  Therefore the best structure for SO4^- consists of four SINGLE bonds to each of the oxygen atoms.  In H2SO4, you will have two oxygen atoms with three lone pairs, and two oxygen atoms with two lone pairs and two bonds to hydrogen atoms.|`|UFGLgXLbaa	that is because sulfur can  accumulate electrons in the 3d orbitals as well apart from 3p and 3s/

XiMQLv8Oaa	It has been discovered that individual electron themselves behave like miniature magnets and are aligned by external magnetic forces or electric current to unify their magnetic properties. There is  this angular momentum that keeps them aligned. The angular momentum of the electrons are both due to orbital movement and the "spin" of particles theorized to be additional modes of their motion. It has been found also that certain transistory magnets or temporary magnets would not retain their magnetism and the temperature of the object affects its magnetic retention capabilities. For one thing, the motion of electrons increase with the thermal energy the object absorbs. And heat increases their motion that will make them misaligned.|`|FD8I4zthaa	randomises the direction of electron spin which causes the magnetism when they are aligned|`|9v31wUz1aa	Magnetism on a simple level is caused by domains within the magnet ( these domains are created by electron spin etc - but that is another story). The domains in an unmagentised material will be scattered in randon directions. When the material becomes magnetised, the domains become lined up in approx one direction. When a metal is heated the energy input causes atoms to vibrate. This atomic vibration causes the domains to move out of position. So the regular alignment of the magnetised domains becomes scattered out of alignment and so the material is demagnetised.|`|OatLZ0sXaa	Very a few.For electrons move faster but in counter sides.You really princecca?

The first one is the highest rainfall in one year, which was 904.9 inches between August 1860 and July 1861. It also holds the record for the highest rainfall within one month, which was 366 inches in July 1861.

Here, it rains about 472 inches in an average year, but once again, the majority of this rainfall comes during the monsoon season. The Khasi Hills is what causes it to rain so much in Mawsynram as well, and the continual uplift of air over the hills makes the rainfall continuous during the monsoon season.<br>  <br>  Mount Waialeale, Hawaii<br>  <br>  Mount Waialeale is clearly not a place you would want to honeymoon, since it rains up to 350 days a year here.

It is definitely the rainiest place in the United States, but it also claims to be the rainiest place in the world.<br>  <br>  The rain here is caused by the location and shape of the island. Because of where it is located, it is more exposed to frontal systems in the Pacific Ocean during winter. The island also has a circular shape, which allows all sides to be hit by clouds of moisture and moisture itself. Mount Waialeale is also known for its steep cliffs, which cause clouds to rapidly rise and then drop a lot of rain in one area.|`|HJTs6qppaa	Here in the U.S.A. it has to be Seattle, world wide I would say Viet Nam or maybe just South East Asia in general with the Monsoon Season.

Gnfc4wRlaa	Slab rollback is a geologic term which refers to the process where a sinking tectonic slab subducts at a steep angle and sweeps back through the mantle like a paddle.  This causes the hinge to migrate away from the arc region. The upper plate is pulled along in the process and may lead to backarc spreading. <br>  <br>  This is not about Etna, but it gives an explanation of "slab window."<br>  "A view brought forward by Dickinson and Snyder ( 1979 ) suggests that as the spreading center approaches North America and stalls, the slab breaks at some point to form an area of no slab beneath the continent or a ‘slab window’."<br>  <br>  The formation of Mount Etna as the consequence of slab rollback<br>  Zohar Gvirtzman1,2 & Amos Nur:<br>  <br>  Mount Etna, the largest volcano in Europe, lies close to the subduction-related Aeolian magmatic arc but shows no trace of subducted material in its magmas. Mount Etna is also situated on continental crust yet shows oceanic basalt affinities1, 2, 3, with isotopic ratios of helium and carbon suggesting that it is fed by the same type of mantle source as are mid-ocean ridge basalts4, 5. Here we propose that although this giant volcano is not subduction-related—in the sense that it is not part of the magmatic arc—its formation is strongly related to the nearby subduction process. Based on a three-dimensional model of the tectonic plates in this region, we propose that the voluminous melting under Mount Etna results from 'suction' of asthenospheric material from under the neighbouring African plate. Such lateral flow is expected when descending slabs migrate backwards in the mantle (rollback) leaving low-pressure regions behind6, 7 them. This was previously identified at the northern end of the Tonga arc (southwest Pacific Ocean) where such flow feeds arc8 or backarc9 magmatism. Here we show that in the south Tyrrhenian subduction zone, slab rollback pulls asthenospheric material much farther along the plate contact, reaching the base of the crust in the forearc region. This explains the voluminous melting under Mount Etna and also the recent uplift of the forearc region (the Calabrian peninsula)."<br>  <br>  Tonarini, Sonia; Armienti, Pietro; D'Orazio, Massimo; Innocenti, Fabrizio<br>  Earth and Planetary Science Letters, Volume 192, Issue 4, p. 471-483.<br>  <br>  "We argue that the slab window generated by differential roll-back of subducting Ionian lithosphere (with respect to Sicily) allows the upwelling of asthenosphere from below the subduction system and provides a suitable path of rise for subduction-related fluids. The increasing geochemical signature of fluid mobile elements enrichment to Mt. Etna lavas is considered a consequence of the progressive opening of slab window through time."

DhLIo8nbaa	No you cannot.  When you go to give blood they ask you a series of questions before they let you do anything.  When you go in you either have to fill out a form or you sit down with someone and they ask you if you have had any tatoos or piercings in the past year.  They ask you if you have used any IV drugs, if you have been involved in prostitution.  If you are a man they ask if you have had homosexual sexual intercourse.  They also ask if you have any reason to believe that you have came in contact with the HIV virus.  If you answer yes to any of those questions then they do not take the blood.  Since obviously there is no way that they can tell if you are telling the truth because anyone can go and lie they go through a very rigorous testing process once they get the blood from the doners and they make sure that it is not infected with anything, and uually if it is they will ask you previously to your donation if you would like to be notified if you have anything wrong with your blood, and then if you do they will give you a call and let you know.|`|JcwjDpY8aa	I am not sure.  I know you are required to provide any information on any new piercings or tats and I think they need to be at least a year old.  Sometimes it can take this long for Hepatitis to show up in a blood test and that is a disease that can be contracted through piercing, even if you had it done at a very reputable place.  The blood alliance doesn't care if the best shop in town did it- they just want to make sure the recipient doesn't get sick from your blood.|`|z9st8cLvaa	I think it depends on if it was done with a gun or a needle.

22vd3xXDaa	No, but the two are related.  PACS, or picture archiving and communication system, serves as a digital storage medium for medical imaging versus traditional film records. PACS systems can be USED in teleradiology, as medical images can be taken in one located and interpreted by a radiologist in a completely separate location.  <br>  <br>  Teleradiology simply describes the practice of having digital medical images sent from one location to a radiologist elsewhere, in cases where a staff radiologist might not be readily available (off hours, rural location, etc.).
OuOxpteraa	parallel to the xy plane means that it's x and y coordinates don't matter because it contains all the points in x and in y; hence a plane int he xy plane.  since your z value is 7, it's just a plane at z = 7.  think of it in 2 dimensions.  a line parallel to the x axis that goes through (-4, -2) would be a horizontal line that goes through -2; so y = -2 is the only option.  then expand it to 3 dimensions like your problem here and you get z = 7.
acbqsZZbaa	I never used the AVR, but normally in a program you would have an initialisation section at the start. This is where you set the initial values of all the variables, set up the hardware and write the default values to the output ports. In your case that would probably just be:<br>  <br>  Init:<br>  Out & h38, &h00<br>  .<br>  .<br>  ...and then the rest of the program<br>  <br>  So somewhere in your loop you want to have something like:<br>  <br>  Test switch bit<br>  If bit set, jump to Init<br>  <br>  You should actually put that in your delay loops, since the program is spending most of its time in the delay loops. Or a much more elegant way is to use an externally triggered interrupt. Using a hardware timed interrupt for the delays is much better programming as well (assuming the AVR has a timer that can generate an interrupt).
2vRXS29iaa	D. The Moon Revolves Once And Rotates Once In The Same period Of Time.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The moon is 'tidally locked' with earth. Planets and moons are not made of purely smoothe, evenly distributed material. They have lots of bumps and bulges, even if their over-all shape is spherical. The side of the moon that faces earth represents the more massive side of the moon. Over a very long time, the mutual tidal and gravitational forces between the earth and moon caused the more massive chunk of the moon to always face earth. All orbiting bodies have a tendency toward this tidal locking, but again, it takes an enormous amount of time and depends also on the rate of rotation of the body.|`|mBsL0azYaa	D. This is because the moon is slightly denser on one side, so it is always attracted to the Earth more than the other side.|`|ZbnppWIGaa	the moon rotates about its axis in the about the same time it takes to orbit the Earth.

e9b8d9a2dcb7d7a40bd5c28a9ae6306daa	'Fascinating question; one which addresses more than Biology alone, especially respective of Economics and Systemology, and we should add Psychology, oddly enough or not.  Who can be sure that your answer can be explained efficiently using this medium: Yahoo Answers?  There requires many varying fields and professions to give you explanations on this -- in particular in that of Public Health and Ecology. <br>  <br>  Pelagius gives an excellent answer, however, with respect to the physio-anatomy itself.  <br>  <br>  Plants and human adaptations both, are outrageously and efficient and proximal where resolved to their own natural devices.  Plants, however, do not aggress to destroy themselves but are subject to and no less have to adapt to environmental assaults brought to bear from the exploits of human beings; whereas human adaptation is an aggression itself, a made condition, an unnatural condition, in that the human digestive and respiratory systems, for example, are having to contend with materials whose compositions are no longer at all natural.<br>  <br>  Hence there exists the high morbidity rates in particular in the western hemisphere wherein all manner of pathogenic substances are imported and infused into the soils, the air, and thereby the human system for which the human body did not evolve over the course of millions of years to contend with.  <br>  <br>  Both plants and human beings have evolved alongside each other; they are siblings but now are required to adjust genetically to conditions totally alien and foreign to them, all inside of barely 100 years.  <br>  <br>  To the genome of either plant or human being, this assault is tantamount to a biological Big Bang  -- sudden.  Natural systems are not set to withstand this, for nature typically moves by deliberation, that is, slow and steady.  It 'can' adapt to certain brusque changes, this is true; but not as nature has had to undergo such radical changes since the turn of the 19th to 20th Century.|`|MUWy20NVaa	The main key is increasing surface area.

We can see, smell, and hear what is around us.  Having our two eyes set as they are gives us depth perception.  But an alien life form might have these functions in a completely different way.  They might have tentacles and still have dexterity.  They might sense vibrations, forms, and movement, rather than seeing or hearing.  Then there was the Horta on Star Trek.

AWPaPV4Eaa	The difference between soy ink and petroleum ink is only in the carrier for the dyes - the dyes and pigments are actually the same for both.  Soy ink uses soybean oil to make the pigments and dyes into a paste that can be printed.<br>  <br>  Soybean oil contains unsaturated fats - this means that the fat molecules have a double bond in them.  I would expect petroleum to contain mostly saturated organic compounds - no double bonds.<br>  <br>  There is an easy test for a C=C double bond (that is not part of an aromatic system like a benzene ring) - bromine will add across the double bond.  Mix the ink with a small amount of bromine dissolved in an organic solvent - if the reddish color of the bromine disappears, the compound contained double bonds.  This method might not work if the pigments will react with bromine - in this case, both types of ink might decolorize the bromine.<br>  <br>  Bromine is a pretty dangerous chemical, and somewhat hard to obtain unless you make it yourself, so your best bet would probably be to take the newsletter to a university and see if someone can test it for you.<br>  <br>  There's also the forensic route: see if you can find out who printed the newsletters and ask them.

H is typically used for enthalpic energy; S is typically used for entropic.  Q = H + S is the high-level general equation for total heat energy where total heat Q consists of both enthalpic and entropic heat energy.<br>  <br>  The triangle indicates a change in...if you have triangle H + that is exothermic because the change is to a higher heat level (i.e., heat is produced).  If the sign is negative, that is endothermic because the change is to a lower level (i.e., heat is absorbed).<br>  <br>  BTW the triangle is "delta" the Greek letter meaning change in.  We abbreviate delta as "del."  For example, del V = V1 - V0 which is the change in velocity.  Thus del H = H1 - H0 > 0 (i.e., plus) where the end heat H1 > H0 the starting heat before the chemical reaction takes place...it's exothermic.<br>  <br>  Here's an example:  2H2 + O2 + q ---> 2H2O + Q; where Q > q; so the reaction is exothermic.  In this case we assume no entropy so Q = H and q = h therefore H > h which is del H +, as in your problem.|`|AA11668123	The triangle is actually a Greek delta, meaning 'change in'.<br>  <br>  So, ?H+ probably means 'change in heat expelled'.

The term derives from the fact that absorption of visible light renders the hole's interior invisible, and indistinguishable from the black space around it.<br>  Despite its invisible interior, a black hole may reveal its presence through interaction with matter orbiting the event horizon. For example, a black hole may be perceived by tracking the movement of a group of stars that orbit its center. Alternatively, one may observe gas (from a nearby star, for instance) that has been drawn into the black hole. The gas spirals inward, heating up to very high temperatures and emitting large amounts of radiation that can be detected from earthbound and earth-orbiting telescopes.[2][3] Such observations have resulted in the general scientific consensus that—barring a breakdown in our understanding of nature—black holes do exist in our universe.[4]<br>  The idea of an object with gravity strong enough to prevent light from escaping was proposed in 1783 by John Michell,[5] an amateur British astronomer. In 1795, Pierre-Simon Laplace, a French physicist independently came to the same conclusion.[6][7] However, such "Newtonian black holes" are very different from black holes in general relativity. They prevent only light from escaping (not, for example, a rocket ship) and only in certain Newtonian models of light (such as an emission theory).<br>  Black holes, as currently understood, are described by the general theory of relativity. This theory predicts that when a large enough amount of mass is present in a sufficiently small region of space, all paths through space are warped inwards towards the center of the volume, preventing all matter and radiation within it from escaping.<br>  While general relativity describes a black hole as a region of empty space with a point-like singularity at the center and an event horizon at the outer edge, the description changes when the effects of quantum mechanics are taken into account. Research indicates that, rather than holding captured matter forever, black holes may slowly leak a form of thermal energy called Hawking radiation and may well have a finite life.[8][9][10] The as yet unknown theory of quantum gravity is believed to give the fully correct|`|m09snBrEaa	anything that has a gravitational pull big enough so that the escape velocity(the speed needed to overcome that gravity) is above the speed of light would be a black hole, what its made of doesn't matter, what does matter is density.|`|d6bb91335d2d467b86fe9b280c4c812eaa	Nothing.

It's like asking what kind of fabric the hole in a basketball hoop is made out of. <br>  <br>  According to theoretical predictions, A black hole occurs when gravity is sufficiently strong to overpower the strong interaction force and cause the point in space to collapse to the point where the laws of physics break down. This takes a tremendous amount of energy, as the Strong Interaction Force is nearly 10 trillion times stronger than Gravity. The Strong force is a force that dictates elementary particles, but for our purposes, one of the "side" effects of the Strong force is what we are interested in; the force which "glues" atoms together and keeping them from flying apart due to electromagnetism (if you've ever played with magnets before, you know what happens when you start playing with like charged and opposite charged poles). Ever notice how a simple magnet can hold a nail despite the entire combined gravitational force of the planet? That's because gravity is far weaker than electromagnetism, and electromagnetism is 100 times weaker than the strong force. <br>  <br>  So when a sufficiently massive star goes supernova, the collapsing material becomes so gravitationally dense that only the strong interaction force is capable of resisting it. If the Strong Interaction Force successfully resists gravitational collapse, it becomes a neutron star. In Neutron Stars, electrons and protons fuse to become neutrons, and is probably the most dense phenomenon that exists in our universe. <br>  <br>  If gravity overpowers the Strong Interaction Force, the matter collapses into an infinitely dense state. Because infinities can not exist in nature, it means that the laws of physics breaks down and are unable to explain what is happening in the heart of a black hole. <br>  <br>  As you probably know, black holes are so dense that not even light can escape from them. However, right as the black hole forms, a certain amount of light photons get "stuck" right at the right distance from the core of the black hole where they are neither being sucked into the hole nor escaping into space. This is the outer shell of the black hole; the event horizon. The event horizon is a shell of light photons which is the absolute last point before the black hole's gravity becomes too strong to resist. Of course, light is the interaction of light photons with your eyes, therefore you wouldn't be able to see the event horizon; it would just appear as a completely black sphere, because there is nothing for which the light photons to interact with.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	As somple as I can Make it:<br>  Ordinary matter cannot survive it's entry into a black hole.<br>  The best answer to your question in english is 'mass', <br>  and it's not a very good one.<br>  A 'collapsed star' would be a neutron star.<br>  A Black Hole is something else, formed by the load of matter <br>  higher than space can support, that comes with the collapse of <br>  more massive stars.<br>  In effect, the mass is still there, but the matter/energy isn't.<br>  I know it doesn't seem to make sense, but that's how it seems to be.

a86HbDIZaa	The Cascade Range is volcanic, and the volcanoes are there because of the nearby subduction zone.<br>  <br>  As the Juan de Fuca plate is subducted some of it melts, and this hot magma rises up through the overlying continental rocks. Most of this melting seems to happen at a depth of around 100km, this is the same for all subduction zones!<br>  <br>  After passing through 100km of continental crust the magma is rich in silica and gases, just the things that make for explosive eruptions. As it rises the pressure decreases, but the difference in pressure between the magma and the surrounding rock increases. At some point the combined weight and strength of the rock above is no longer enough to hold the pressure, and an eruption happens.<br>  <br>  So Mt. St. Helens is where it is because of plate tectonics, and it erupted when it did because the pressure in the magma chamber rose until it was higher than the mountain could take.|`|j4OBEeAlaa	volcanics dont give you reasons for erupting lol yes it is because of tectonic plates under ground.look it up on wikipedia|`|pyHF4eYJaa	It erupted maybe because the volcano spirit wanted to express itself.|`|Gnfc4wRlaa	The quick and simple answer is that the Juan de Fuca Plate is subducting beneath the North American Plate.  <br>  <br>  The Juan de Fuca Plate, named after the explorer, is a tectonic plate arising from the Juan de Fuca Ridge, and subducting under the northerly portion of the western side of the North American Plate at the Cascadia subduction zone.<br>  <br>  The fury of the Mount St. Helen blast was attributed to the complex interactions between the Pacific Plate, North American Plate, and tiny Juan de Fuca plate, an area known as a triple plate junction.<br>  <br>  Subduction zones involve an oceanic plate sliding beneath either a continental plate or another oceanic plate. Subduction zones are often noted for their high rates of volcanism, earthquakes, and mountain building.<br>  <br>  In the case of the subduction zone off the coasts of western Canada and the western United States the Juan De Fuca oceanic plate is being forced beneath the Cascadian plate. As the Juan De Fuca plate continualy advances it cuts off huge reserviors of magma and then squeezes them like a baker squeezing decorative icing onto a cake. As the Juan De Fuca plate continues its advance the Occluded magma is then subjected to the same extreme pressures and energies that formed and pushed up the coastal mountains. The Jan De Fuca plate pushes up beneath the magma dikes forcing the Cascade Mountains upward. This upward preasure drives the magma upward and as it advances into the base of the mountains gasses including water vapor and sulpher are desolved into the magma chamber. The isolated dike of magma has nowhere to go but up and is manifested to us as a volcano. An eruption only temporarily releives the preassure. As the Jaun De Fuca plate continues its advance the preasures rebuild. A very small advance of the Jaun De Fuca plate will increase the preassures on the isolated magma reseervoirs subatantialy. As long as the magma dike is molten the volcano lives but when the magma cools the volcano becomes extinct and dies. It may be possible that several volcanoes could share the same magma reservoir which would explain why nieghbing volcanoes became restless when Mount St. Helens erupted. The bear Tribe Indians have a saying about Mount St. Helens and Mount Rainier that says, "When sister calls big brother soon answers". If magma chambers are shared by two or more volcanoes, and intolerable pressures develop the weakest link in the volcano chain will be the one to burst.<br>  <br>  Subduction-zone volcanoes like Mount St. Helens (in Washington State) and Mount Pinatubo (Luzon, Philippines), are called composite cones and typically erupt with explosive force, because the magma is too stiff to allow easy escape of volcanic gases. As a consequence, tremendous internal pressures mount as the trapped gases expand during ascent, before the pent-up pressure is suddenly released in a violent eruption. Such an explosive process can be compared to putting your thumb over an opened bottle of a carbonated drink, shaking it vigorously, and then quickly removing the thumb. The shaking action separates the gases from the liquid to form bubbles, increasing the internal pressure. Quick release of the thumb allows the gases and liquid to gush out with explosive speed and force.

X0e6p9Ilaa	Perhaps you mean aluminum, Al.  The symbol is not Ai nor is it A1.<br>  <br>  Interestingly enough, there is only one naturally occurring isotope of aluminum, Al-27.  Therefore it actually possible to tell the number of neutrons as well as protons and electrons.  Protons and neutrons are easy because the number equals the atomic number, 13.  It's the number of protons that is more difficult since the number of neutrons can vary from one isotope to the next.  But since there is only one isotope of Al, and it has a mass number of 27, then there are 14 neutrons in the naturally occurring isotope. <br>  <br>  By the way, you CANNOT use the atomic wieght as the mass number.

2vRXS29iaa	In the broadest sense, the term impact crater can be applied to any depression, natural or manmade, resulting from the high velocity impact of a projectile with larger body. In most common usage, the term is used for the approximately circular depression in the surface of a planet, moon or other solid body in the Solar System, formed by the hyper-velocity impact of a smaller body with the surface. This is in contrast to the pit crater which results from an internal collapse. Impact craters typically have raised rims, and they range from small, simple, bowl-shaped depressions to large, complex, multi-ringed impact basins. Meteor Crater is perhaps the best-known example of a small impact crater on the Earth.<br>  The depth of an impact crater can usually be estimated using Hunt's Impact Theorem, assuming that the radius of the impact body is negligible to the size of the crater.<br>  <br>  <br>  A volcanic crater is a circular depression in the ground caused by volcanic activity.[1] It is typically a basin, circular in form within which occurs a vent (or vents) from which magma erupts as gases, lava, and ejecta. A crater can be of large dimensions, and sometimes of great depth. During certain types of climactic eruptions, the volcano's magma chamber may empty enough for an area above it to subside, forming what may appear to be a crater but is actually known as a caldera.<br>  The impacting body generally melts and mixes with the rocks at the impact site. Sometimes the impact site reveals an abundance of siderophile elements such as iridium, osmium, platinum, and palladium. Other tell-tale signs of an impact are products of shock metamorphism such as shatter cones, planar features in quartz and feldspar, diaplectic glass, and a high-pressure form of quartz called stishovite. Stishovite has never been found anywhere else but impact sites.|`|KHSOVxViaa	Volcanic eruptions have outflow of lava.  Over time, this builds up to a conical or mound-shaped volcano.<br>  <br>  Impacts from a crater are depressed below ground level, often surrounded with a raised ring of debris which was thrown up and outwards by the impact.

The apparent north-south motion is caused by the earth's axial tilt, and the east-west motion is the result of the earth's orbit around the sun being elliptical instead of round.|`|MUWy20NVaa	Thank you for Analema.

In this case, adding the alum first would be better, but it, may not make a difference.  It rarely works better to add the aid first since what it is aiding is the removal of the alum species formed.  If they are not there, it may react with other things first, making the alum not work as well.

GoWoGKyQaa	With a 2ltr - use at least 1/3 of water in there to begin with - you should be able to get to 60 feet +<br>  <br>  Use a band cut from another bottle about 3" wide, and use 3 thin wood canes to attatch this band a good 8" behind the main bottle. This ring is the best "tail-fin" design.<br>  <br>  Go to a tyre depot - and ask for a tyre valve - complete. Remove the inner core.<br>  You should be able to rig this to the top of a solid pipe for launching - using a tyre pump on the valve. Use a length of solid pipe just pushed inside the rubber valve top. Make a hole in the cap of your rocket to fit this pipe EXACTLY.<br>  <br>  The next bit is crucial - the release mechanism. The best method seems to be a number of nylon zip-ties arranged pointing inwards, and holding onto the neck of the bottle. A pipe-ring then slips over this, and this acts like a collet. The free ends of the zip-ties are then clamped securely to the launch pipe with a jubilee clip. <br>  <br>  The bottle (with water) is slipped over the stiff pipe, and slid down to the rubber valve - providing a seal. The zipties go over the neck - and the small pipe ring holds them there.<br>  <br>  Attatch string to the release ring, and feed through a ring at the base of the launch base. Pump- up - then pull string.<br>  <br>  4 Bar is fine - that's 60 PSI.

l5O6CTzJaa	I've been a petroleum geologist for >30years.  Most if not all people entering the oil business these days have at least a masters degree in geology or geophysics - preferably from a university noted for its petroleum geology/geophysics like Texas, Texas A&M, U of Oklahoma, LSU, Colorado School of Mines and many others.  A BS degree is about 4 years and if you are a fast track and ambitious you can get your masters is 2 years (because I did it).  Starting salaries are ~70-80k/year.|`|a86HbDIZaa	Getting a job as a petroleum geologist without a relevant MSc is virtually impossible today.

Let's take a look at this. One whole dollar would be 100/100. In this case, it is 12/100. <br>  <br>  You can half it all to make it 6/50. But let's see if there are any more correct answers. B isn't correct, because 6/25 =/= 12/100. C is also correct, because 12/100 = 12/100. Now, the last one, D, is correct, too. 3/25 = 6/50 = 9/75 = 12/100. As you can see there, 3/25 is the most simplified, as 6/50 can also be simplified to 3/25. Sorry for being vague, but to sum it up, D is correct, and it is because it is in lowest terms.

PsCCd63yaa	You really don't have to do anything more to your answer if you don't want to...<br>  (x-2)^3 + (x-6)*3*(x-2)^2 is a perfectly acceptable form for your answer.<br>  <br>  If you wanted to, you could expand out (x-2)(x-2)(x-2) + 3(x-6)(x-2)(x-2) and use FOIL on two factors at a time.  That would give a nasty cubic.  A shortcut is using your binomial theorem/pascal's triangle for the <br>  (x-2)^3 part.  Either way, though, it's still a tedious algebra problem.<br>  <br>  Or, alternately, you could "factor out" an (x-2)^2 from each term to get:<br>  <br>  (x-2)^2 * [(x-2) + 3(x-6)]<br>  <br>  "Simplest form" is a matter of taste - sometimes a cubic in the form Ax^3 + Bx^2 + Cx + D is simplest...for example, if you wanted to find the product of all the roots of the cubic (It's -D/A, by the way.)  The factored form is simplest if you're trying to find all the actual roots of the cubic.<br>  <br>  The factored form is probably a little more useful.  If you want to find when your original function had a slope of zero (i.e. possible max/min points), the factored form of f ' (x) can be seen to have a double root at (x-2)=0 and a another root at (x-2)+3(x-6) = 0.  Simplifying, the tangent line is flat at x=2 and x=5.  <br>  <br>  You can also use these points as "boundary" points to test when the ORIGINAL function is increasing or decreasing...test x=0 for the region x<2, x=3 for the region 2<x<5, and x=6 for the region x>5.<br>  <br>  Of note, the derivative you got is cubic.  This should at least tell you that your answer is plausible, since your original equation was of degree 4.  Polynomials lose a degree when differentiated.|`|dX4Dll0yaa	derivative of (x-2)^3 = 3(x-2)^2 * 1 (since derivative of x-2 is 1)<br>  derivative of 3(x-6)*(x-2)^2 = derivative of first* second + first * derivative of second = 3(1)(x-2)^2 + 2*3(x-6)*(x-2)*1 = 3(x-2)^2 + 6(x-6)*(x-2)<br>  So<br>  derivative =  3(x-2)^2 + 3(x-2)^2 + 6(x-6)*(x-2)
XiMQLv8Oaa	Land heat up much faster. This might have to do with the movements of molecules in the process of heat transfer known as convection and conduction.<br>  <br>  In land, the heated surface is solid, which if it has to dissipate the heat, it must do so by means of conduction. And soil or rocks have low conductive capacities.<br>  <br>  Water on the other hand, being liquid, has more molecular mobility compared to solids. The water current could make exchanges of molecules in the water surface, thereby continiously changing hot molecules with cold ones. In this way, the heat absorbed by the surface is dissipated throughout the volume of water near the surface and carried by currents in wave action to deeper parts.|`|AA11668123	On average, the land has a much smaller heat capacity.  So, when they both receive the same amount of energy from the sun, the temperature rises more on land than water.|`|4441985f202bc7f8afcd244e4af70623aa	Because land doesn't reflect as much light as water. If light isn't being reflected then it's being absorbed and that absorbed energy is heat. Water reflects a good deal of the sunlight that hits it therefore it doesn't heat up as fast as land does. If you sprinkle some fireplace ashes on the snow during the winter the snow will melt even on a cold day if the sun is shining because the darkened area is absorbing light rather than reflecting it.

At the center is a metallic core, probably made of iron and iron sulfide, about 560 miles in radius, which is overlain by a mantle of partially molten rock and crust, according to JPL's Dr. John Anderson, team leader of Galileo's celestial mechanics experiment and principal author of the paper published in Science today. The core was probably formed from heating in the interior of the moon, either when it originally formed or as a result of the perpetual tidal heating driving its volcanoes.<br>  <br>  Galileo scientists also are trying to determine the cause of the hole they found in Jupiter's magnetic field when the spacecraft was closest to Io. "Instead of increasing continuously as the spacecraft neared Jupiter, the magnetic field strength took a sudden drop of about 30 percent," Johnson said.<br>  <br>  "The data suggest that something around Io -- possibly a magnetic field generated by Io itself -- is creating a bubble or hole in Jupiter's own powerful magnetic field," Kivelson said. "But it's not clear to us just how Io can dig such a deep and wide magnetic hole."<br>  <br>  If analysis of this data eventually proves that Io indeed has a magnetic field of its own, it would be the first moon shown to have one. Io would join the Earth, planet Mercury and the outer giant planets as bodies in our Solar System that generate their own magnetic fields."<br>  <br>  "Ganymede's liquid iron core is still generating a magnetic field.

2vRXS29iaa	When it comes to fruit flies in our homes, the idea of spontaneous generation seems to be in play. Fruit flies seem to magically appear around fruit and other foods quickly and without fail in an otherwise insect-free kitchen. Of course, modern science has proven that spontaneous generation is impossible, so the question remains; where do fruit flies come from?<br>  <br>  Fruit flies are tiny winged insects that boast a meager length of 0.2 inches (3mm). They are brownish in color, with striped bodies and relatively large red eyes. They are perfectly adept in smelling food from great distances. With their great sense of smell and tiny bodies, fruit flies can maneuver into your kitchen through window screens, door jams, or any other crack in your home. Occasionally, they may catch a ride in your grocery bags or hatch from eggs laid in less than fresh food brought home from a grocery store.<br>  <br>  A congregation of fruit flies can become a nuisance. Fruit flies feed on alcohol, which is produced when fruits and vegetables begin to ferment. The alcohol in wine, beer, and other alcoholic beverages is also appealing to fruit flies. Fruit flies not only feed on these foods, but also lay eggs in them that hatch into larvae in a matter of hours. In almost the blink of an eye, fruit flies can infest any kitchen.

Water's melting point is 0 degrees celsius, and its  boiling point is 100 degrees celsius. <br>      While in water, sulphur dioxide is seperated into sulfur and oxygen, each with a much higher boiling point than water.

1c25f0773926f8cde3f71d5867bbbc1eaa	No, because to a stationary observer that sees the bus moving at the speed of light, the bus is contracted to 0 length, so that for me to walk to the front of the bus, it looks like I'm also going at the speed of light.<br>  <br>  What is very confusing about special relativity for most people is the distinction between clocks and rulers for different moving observers.  The rule is that each observer is supposed to use his OWN clocks and rulers, and not rely on the clocks and rulers of that being observed.  Likewise, if the stationary observer wants to make statements about what the moving observer computes, the stationary observer must only use the moving observer's own clock and ruler.  In this fashion, the staionary observer, using the clock and ruler in the moving bus, will see that the occupants of the bus will compute my speed as normal walking speed.<br>  <br>  Edit:  If we were to hypothesize "things going faster than the speed of light", then, yes, conventional physics would suggest that if the object was moving away from me, no light shined from my direction would reach it to be reflected.  It would be as if, figuratively speaking, it had passed through the event horizon.  However, if the object were to emit its OWN light, then I would see it!  A good example (well, analogy) of this would be Chrenekov Radiation, where particles travelling faster than the speed of light in a medium (where light would be expected to be travelling slower than it would in a vacuum), can make the presence visible by such radiation.  <br>  <br>  As for whether or not anything can be "travelling faster than the speed of light", it should be noted the deBroglie matter waves do travel faster than the speed of light. As a matter of fact, the slowest they can travel is at the speed of light.|`|a7a7d61d2304fa70769870fad1171da0aa	There is an assumption in your question.  The assumption is that a person would have the ability to move at all.  There is a difinitive answer to your question, and it is found in the physics trilogy.  It states: e=mc2, m=e/c2, and c2=e/m.  The first two deal with mass and energy in the normal way we understand them, the last is that of a field of physical time, or that of a field of gravity.<br>  <br>  Notice in the first two equations that the basis of each is that of the value "c2".  Mass and energy are able to change in value but the value of c2 does not change.  This means that this value determines the most basic value of mass and energy.  The value of c2 is that of physical time.  It is a period of duration, which duration is that of the value "h" - Planck's constant.  This value determines "reality" for all creation.  It gives the actual time period for "present time" after which period of existence all creation changes value from present time to that of past time.  This value "h" is a composite for all energy and mass, and were all forms of mass and energy reduced to their lowest forms, they would become that of a graviton "c=h".  The third equation in the trilogy being that for a field of gravity, which is also a field of physical time.<br>  <br>  When considering the trilogy along with that of the graviton, c=h, notice how all forms of our universe were brought into existence at the exact same moment - equal to 6.626196  -34 Joules per sec. duration.  It is impossible by any means for c=h to have formed into energy, and then this energy into mass apart from the action of being created into these values.<br>  <br>  What this means to your question is: when a person reaches the speed of light there is nothing else in existence other than the value of c=h.  Our entire universe at that time would have become one-dimensional and there would exist no such thing as time or light.  Time could not exist, for time to exist it requires the presence of mass.|`|daQ5aoOoaa	No.<br>  <br>  When adding velocities, you actually don't simply add them together, the formula is:   w = (u + v)/(1 + uv/c^2)<br>  where w is the new velocity, u and v are the old velocities and c is the speed of light.<br>  <br>  When u and v are small, 1+small/(speedoflight squared) is about 1, which leads to the simplified equation you know, w=u+v<br>  <br>  however, when u and v get large, the 1+large/(speedoflight squared) means you must use the equation.<br>  <br>  Lets say you walk at 5 miles per hour.<br>  <br>  According to google, that's 7.45582462 × 10^-9 times the speed of light, or about .00000000745582462c<br>  <br>   w = (u + v)/(1 + uv/c^2)<br>   w= (.00000000745582462c+c)/(1+.000000007455...<br>   w=1.00000000745582462c/(1+.0000000074558...<br>  w= 1.00000000745582462c/1.00000000745582462...<br>  w=1c<br>  w=c<br>  <br>  So you'd be going at the speed of light exactly.<br>  <br>  It seems like a jump in logic, but if you were on a bus going at the speed of light, you would NOT be able to go forward at all. Even if you could go the speed of light forward with respect to the bus, the total w would be 2c/2 = c.<br>  <br>  <br>  Another example.<br>  <br>  Lets say the bus is going at .9c and you can run at .9c<br>  Basic addition gives you 1.8c but the correct answer is<br>   w = (u + v)/(1 + uv/c^2)<br>   w = (.9c + .9c)/(1 + .81c^2/c^2)<br>  w= 1.8c/1.81<br>  w=  0.994475138c<br>  <br>  So by this logic, you can't get anything to even go the speed of light, because adding anything less than the speed of light to a velocity will always result in a velocity that is less than the speed of light.<br>  <br>  Ex:<br>  Adding .994475c to itself results in 0.999984653c<br>  Adding that to itself results in 0.99999999988c<br>  and so on.<br>  <br>  Therefore, <br>  You can never really be going at the speed of light at all.

F5GyrdQfaa	Current thinking states that after the "Big Bang"-- or whatever cosmic origin started our space-time--there was nothing but a hot quark-gluon plasma. Quarks and gluons are kinda precursor particles--they go on to make protons and neutrons and such--and at the extreme temps of creation were too energetic to form atoms.<br>    Gradually they cooled as space-time expanded, and small fluctuations began to form, like ripples on a lake during a windy day. These fluctuations pushed newly minted atoms (initially only Hydrogen, Helium, and Lithium) toward each other, where their tiny gravitational pulls started the process of accumulation. This eventually led to areas of greater and greater density, as when a snowball is rolled downhill, and gathers more mass. These areas became the earliest galactic masses. On a smaller scale, great densities gave birth to the first stars, which were giant blues. These incredibly hot, but short lived stars were the furnaces in which all other materials/elements of our universe were forged, and when they died, they spread forth the heavier elements across the heavens.<br>    Modern galaxies are the result of billions of years of galactic collisions and absorbtion of smaller galaxies. Hubble Deep Field photos show ancient galaxies from Billions of years ago that do not greatly resemble modern/nearby galaxies. The ancient galaxies were probably mostly stars, and are strage swirling globs of stellar goo. Very few resemble the elegant spiral galaxies we are now familiar with.

The energy vs gravity dyanamics of stars mean that massive stars can create so much energy in one of these phases that it can explode as a supernova, or have a series of smaller explosions as a nova.<br>  <br>  All these stages will have a different place on the H-R diagram.  Stars in the long-life phase of hydrogen fusion are in the main-sequence, but later life stars tend to move off into branches as their luminosity, temperature and colour changes.|`|8AX6CxTgaa	See also: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-R_diagram" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-R_diagram</a><br>                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stars" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stars</a><br>                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_sequence" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_sequen...</a><br>                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_giant" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_giant</a><br>                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf</a><br>                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_dwarf" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_dwarf</a><br>                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_dwarf" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_dwarf</a>

2lQ8DJAcaa	In June 1991, the second largest volcanic eruption of the twentieth century* took place on the island of Luzon in the Philippines, a mere 90 kilometers (55 miles) northwest of the capital city Manila. Up to 800 people were killed and 100,000 became homeless following the Mount Pinatubo eruption, which climaxed with nine hours of eruption on June 15, 1991. On June 15, millions of tons of sulfur dioxide were discharged into the atmosphere, resulting in a decrease in the temperature worldwide over the next few years.<br>  Mount Pinatubo is part of a chain of composite volcanoes along the Luzon arc on the west coast of the island (area map). The arc of volcanoes is due to the subduction of the Manila trench to the west. The volcano experienced major eruptions approximately 500, 3000, and 5500 years ago.<br>  <br>  The events of the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption began in July 1990, when a magnitude 7.8 earthquake occurred 100 kilometers (62 miles) northeast of the Pinatubo region, determined to be a result of the reawakening of Mount Pinatubo.|`|2vRXS29iaa	Mount Pinatubo is an active stratovolcano located on the island of Luzon, at the intersection of the borders of the Philippine provinces of Zambales, Tarlac, and Pampanga. It is located in the Cabusilan Mountain range separating the west coast of Luzon from the central plains, and is 42 km (26 mi) west of the dormant and more prominent Mount Arayat[2], occasionally mistaken for Pinatubo. Ancestral Pinatubo was a stratovolcano made of andesite and dacite. Before 1991, the mountain was inconspicuous and heavily eroded. It was covered in dense forest which supported a population of several thousand indigenous people, the Aeta, who had fled to the mountains from the lowlands during the protracted Spanish conquest of the Philippines which first commenced in 1565.<br>  The volcano's ultra-Plinian eruption in June 1991 produced the second largest terrestrial eruption of the 20th century (after the 1912 eruption of Novarupta) and the largest eruption in living memory.[3] The colossal 1991 eruption had a Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) of 6, and came some 450–500 years after the volcano's last known eruptive activity (estimated as VEI 5, the level of the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens), and some 1000 years after previous VEI 6 eruptive activity.[4] Successful predictions of the onset of the climactic eruption led to the evacuation of tens of thousands of people from the surrounding areas, saving many lives, but surrounding areas were severely damaged by pyroclastic flows, ash deposits, and later by lahars caused by rainwater remobilizing earlier volcanic deposits: thousands of houses and other buildings were destroyed.[3]<br>  The effects of the eruption were felt worldwide. It ejected roughly 10 billion metric tonnes (10 cubic kilometres) of magma, and 20 million tons of SO2, bringing vast quantities of minerals and metals to the surface environment. It injected large amounts of aerosols into the stratosphere—more than any eruption since that of Krakatoa in 1883. Over the following months, the aerosols formed a global layer of sulfuric acid haze. Global temperatures dropped by about 0.5 °C (0.9 °F), and ozone depletion temporarily increased substantially.

Water is given off as that is what makes the copper sulphate blue.If it turned black and carbon dioxide was given off then i'm unsure what you did as carbon dioxide can't be given off because copper sulphate contains only copper and sulpher. To extract copper metal from it you would maake it into a solution with water and then add a metal more reactive than the copper as it will displace the copper and leave it behind as a solid precipitate.|`|183e7c6d5f269f588b38bdcaf80d8110aa	Just for the record, you cannot produce anyhdrous copper sulphate by heating up hydrated copper sulphate.

What do you intend to use it for?|`|79529314dfb5ac7be366558924c3393baa	No. The amount of antimatter in the center of our galaxy is about the same as the amount of antimatter in any other place you choose to look, which is to say, pretty darn small. It appears that pretty much all the antimatter that formed in the early stages of the Universe was simply annihilated by coming in contact with normal matter. The interesting question is, why did the early Universe produce more normal matter than it did antimatter? Some theories have been put forward, but so far physicists don't know the exact answer...all they DO know is that if you want antimatter, you have to make it, and that's not very easy to do.|`|mBsL0azYaa	No, if there was anti-matter and matter in the centre of the Milky Way, it would spontaneously annihilate into energy.<br>  <br>  If there was anti-matter, we couldn't go and collect it. The second it comes into contact with... well, ANYTHING we send out there to carry it, it'll annihilate into energy.<br>  <br>  We've just about gotten out of the Solar System, and even then the things that are heading outwards are now of no use to us as they cannot turn round and come back, and they are so far away we can get no responses from them, even if they were still working.

O7rMKLEMaa	A fly flies by moving its wings back and forth very fast. When the wing goes forward, the top of the wing is tilted foreward; when it goes back the top is tilted back. The wings push the air down, so the air pushes the wings up. A fly lives its life many times faster than a human; so to the fly, the wings seem to be moving slowly, the air seems very thick, and flying seems like swimming. <br>  <br>  Actually, a fly has four wings, and the way it moves them is much more complicated than just back and forth. The article cited below explains it more fully.|`|qaMPEdL2aa	The air in the car is moving with the car.  The fly is just flying through the still air in the car.  The fly would have a terrible surprise if it were to fly out a slightly open window while the car was speeding along.|`|74952ed678a6ad90560f5a699c221b7caa	Yep, physics is a good place for your question.  Physics deals with mass and energy; your fly has mass and by dint of it being where it was in front of you there is energy there.<br>  <br>  The answer is this, when the car started up, the fly picked up the same velocity the car reached.  So you, the fly, the air around it, all those packages in the trunk, etc. are moving at the same basic velocity...that of the car.  As everything inside is going at the same velocity, the relative velocities of everything inside are zero.  That is, everything inside is stationary relative to each other.  <br>  <br>  This is why the fly is in one spot in front of your eyes.  To be sure, it flits to and fro, but on average, it remains in front of you until it decides to fly off to the food you have in the grocery sacks in the back seat.  In which case the relative velocity is no longer zero even though the fly still is going, on average, whatever speed the car is going relative to the ground outside.

Melted iron (Fe) is also a liquid...etc.  <br>  <br>  Simply put, a liquid is any material that conforms to the shape of its open container (as opposed to gas which does not stay in an open container).  Both liquid and gas come under the heading of fluid because their molecules are not tightly bound to each other like in a solid.<br>  <br>  There are lots of liquids that do contain water...all those sodas you drink for example.  And your body does use the contained water as though it were just water you drank.  You could live off root beer for example, wouldn't do much for your figure with all those calories, but your need for water would be satisfied.<br>  <br>  And the Earth is about 70% surface water we call oceans and seas.

That means you've got to emphasize the benefits of space science and exploration, while avoiding talking at length about the money issue (conversely, of course, if you were arguing against space exploration, you'd emphasize its monetary costs as much as possible). Possible tactics include mentioning scientific and technological benefits of space exploration in the past, and comparing space missions to the voyages of 15th and 16th century explorers like Christopher Columbus and John Cabot. Furthermore, if you do have to talk about the funding, you could try an appeal to JFK: 'We choose to do these things not because they are easy, but because they are hard!'

As I hope you know, wind flows from high to low pressure.<br>  So the atmosphere tries to send the cold air toward the equator at the surface and send warm air northward toward the pole at higher levels.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, the spin of the earth prevents this from being a direct route, and the flow in the atmosphere breaks into three zones between the equator and each pole.<br>  These form the six global wind belts: 3 in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and 3 in the Southern (SH). They are generally known as:<br>  <br>  The Tradewinds, which blow from the northeast (NH) and southeast SH), are found in the subtropic regions from about 30 degrees latitude to the equator.<br>  <br>  The Prevailing Westerlies (SW in NH and NW in SH) which blow in the middle latitudes. Most of North America fits into this belt and that is why our weather usually comes from west.<br>  <br>   The Polar Easterlies which blow from the east in the polar regions.

People here certainly have some strong opinions on this subject which, if the big media is to be believed, is silly and benign.<br>  <br>  Whenever you see strong emotional responses which are far out of balance with the presented reality, then it means the subconscious is aware that something is out of kilter and thus is fighting to protect what is perceived to be a vulnerable aspect of itself in order to remain feeling safe and calm.

You'd never know that from the popular media, though.<br>  <br>  I've complained loudly and often about how teachers give students assignments like this, supposedly for their "entertainment" or "motivational" or "fun" value. Sure, they're popular, but they are almost always grossly misinformative and handled in an utterly uncritical, academically irresponsible manner. They like to do stuff on the "paranormal" and astrology and conspiracy theories, too. Unfortunately, most teachers who give these air-headed assignments don't have a clue about the facts themselves. In fact, most of what they know probably comes from students, who get their information from tabloids, junk books, and totally bogus Internet sources. And, of course, it is almost always presented with the sadly naive notion that one person's opinion is just as good as anyone else's. <br>  <br>  These UFO and abduction stories are myths, misunderstandings, and outright lies. People like John Mack don't help the situation any with their grossly credulous indulgence in such claims, fortified in the media by their supposedly impeccable credentials.<br>  <br>  The UFO phenomenon is nothing more than a modern day adaptation of the superstition and ignorance about monsters and supernatural beings of the past. Philip Klass wrote several great, detailed, and honest books on UFOs and abductions. His careful research revealed the boring truth in every case he investigated. Of course, his books are not nearly so popular and are likely *never* to be referenced in such assignments. After all, classrooms are here to indulge students, not educate them, these days, aren't they? That's one of the reasons why the US has dropped to the bottom of the heap among industrialized countries, when it comes to education.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your assignment. I am pleased that at least you thought to come here and try to learn the truth. No doubt, the woo-woos will give you plenty of links to all sorts of alien BS.<br>  <br>  Edit: Sis, the kid's not an idiot. The teacher is. At least he had some skepticism. Give him enough English teachers with assignments like this, and enough TV like Fox and the History Channel, and he might become one by the time he graduates.<br>  <br>  (Hey, Nate, that was meant to put the system down, not you.)<br>  <br>  OR... if you're the one going down the list giving thumbs down to all the people who know the facts on this, then you came to the wrong forum.

Travis Walton. Whitley Streiber. The Allagash four. Those are very compelling cases.<br>  <br>  An look into the writings of Dr. John Mack, a Harvard professor who stuied abductions and found them to be real. Another great author is Bud Hopkins, his book "Witnessed" was an amazing look at an abduction involving even the Secretary General of The United Nations.<br>  <br>  I'm shocked at how many idiots are still unaware that alien abductions are a common occurrence worldwide, and have been for decades, if not millennia. I must adress one of the other respondents in particular.<br>  <br>  BRANT "TOP CONTRIBUTOR". <br>  <br>  This guy is so full of ..it. I'll quote him directly.<br>  <br>  "Sorry, but there is not one single credible UFO/alien encounter story". Really, Brant? Not one? Credible according to who, exactly? You? Because these cases are taken quite seriously by those involved and those who investigated, an they cannot be explained away. Betty Hill detailed a star map that wasn't discovered until twenty years later. Brant must not know much about the case, I guess, because the facts make the Hill abductions very credible. Travis Walton was taken by a flying saucer in front of ten co-workers in broad daylight. The police investigation was quite serious. Brant ought to spend less time answering questions on topics he doesn't understand, and more time doing a little research into the facts. I guess that "TOP CONTRIBUTOR" is a synonym for "bullshirt artist".<br>  <br>  50 million Americans have seen an alien ship, from Presidents to Astronauts, Senators, intelligence officials, military personnel, pilots both military and commercial, police officers, college professors, even astronomers. The US Air Force spent 40 years publicly investigating sightings, and their lead investigator, J. Allen Hyneck, concluded that many sightings were actually alien ships.<br>  <br>  Yet, Brant assures us, not one credible sighting. I wonder if Ol' Brant is aware that a fleet of flying saucers hovered over the U.S. Capitol building for THREE DAYS, July 21-23, 1953, it was witnessed by thousands, and reported in every major news outlet. Don't believe me? Fine, now go go look it up. You can check the front page of the Washington Post of the day, it will tell you I'm completely correct. Sorry, Brant.<br>  <br>  Brant rants, "These UFO and abduction stories are myths, misunderstandings, and outright lies." See folks, denial ain't just a river. It's almost funny, Brant here is basically saying to all these millions of people " I know they're all wrong or lying because...well, just because! Oh, and, um,  no, I wasn't there!" LOL Brants opinion is worthless regarding any of these sightings, individually or as a whole. He wasn't there. <br>  <br>  Here's a revealing quote "People like John Mack don't help the situation any with their grossly credulous indulgence in such claims." Folks, John Mack was a Harvard Professor of Psychiatry and a pulitzer prize winner, held in high academic esteem, who spent years treating alien abductees and came to the learned conclusion that alien abductions were real. Harvard gave him a lot of heat for his controversial findings, but eventually supported his work. What does Brant mean Dr. Mack's findings "don't help the situation any"? They certainly helped the abuctees involved, and it helps shed light on the reality of alien abductions. It just doesn't help Brant's irrational denial. Sorry, Brant.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your paper, dude. Remember the words of Ken Kesey, "There will always be more stupid people than there are smart people." The responses to your question show that to be true.
sEoB4TVIaa	I live in a small town in Oklahoma.Annually there are too many tornado watches to count.A tornado watch means that conditions are favorable for the development of supercells capable of producing a tornado.If rotation is indicated either on dopplar radar or a reported "Wall" cloud by the public or a Spotter,the national weather service will issue a tornado warning.The tornado usually develops on the southwest side of the supercell and shows its face in what they call a "Hook echo"which would look like a backwards J because tornados rotate counter clockwise.Most of the time tornados travel in a northeasterly direction,can travel east or south or even west but usually NE.Many many times my county has been put in a tornado watch and no tornado developed but you must watch for development cause if you let your guard down you might be sorry.Follow the rules and your likely to survive.IF YOU ARE IN A TORNADO "WATCH" AND YOU NOTICE THAT THE SKY TOOK ON A KINDA FUNNY GREEN COLOR AND IT STARTS TO HAIL,TAKE SHELTER!

That doesn't mean there will be any tornadoes at all. Some watches are issued and there are dozens of them. I would be more on the watch for actual tornado warnings. A warning is issued when there is an individual storm that is either rotating or there is already a tornado on the ground. I have heard that storms that rotate produce tornadoes about half the time, although I would image that that number is a little lower. But even when a tornado watch is issued for your area, the chances of actually getting a tornado over your exact location is very slim. It's the tail end of the storm you have to watch for the most, or the hook, where the storm is rotating

RRFiy9CAaa	You probably know already that the set M(R) of matrices over R forms a ring under the usual matrix operations. So it suffices to prove that S is a subring of M(R). This involves considerably less work than proving a ring from scratch; all you need to do is show that S is closed under matrix addition, subtraction and multiplication i.e. that when you perform these operations on members of S, they result again in members of S.<br>  <br>  So given two matrices<br>  (a1 b1)<br>  (-b1 a1)<br>  <br>  and<br>  <br>  (a2 b2)<br>  (-b2 a2)<br>  <br>  their addition would be<br>  <br>  ((a1 + a2) (b1 + b2))<br>  (-(b1 + b2) (a1 + a2))<br>  <br>  So clearly S is closed under addition. Subtraction is similar so I won't show that.<br>  <br>  Their multiplication would be<br>  <br>  ((a1^2 - b1^2) 2a1b1)<br>  (-2a1b1 (a1^2 - b1^2)<br>  <br>  So again S is closed under multiplication. Hence S is a subring of M(R) and so S is a ring.

CYtMRC4eaa	Leukocytopenia (or leukopenia;  "penia" is from the Greek meaning a "lack of") can be caused by any number of factors, such as certain drugs or exposure to certain forms of radiation.  It can even be an indicator of leukemia.  Leukopenia is sometimes called neutropenia; since neutrophils are the most common leukocytes, when they start disappearing, the white cell count goes down.<br>  <br>  Someone who is diagnosed as having a lower than normal white cell count is open to infection.  That's why people who have their white cell counts intentionally reduced to prevent rejection of a transplant wear masks and pay careful attention to their overall health.<br>  <br>  The treatment and prevention is dependent on the cause.|`|aZXnW6AUaa	lack of iron|`|cddOgI5uaa	* LEUKOPENIA IS low WBC count*<br>  <br>  Low white cell counts are associated with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, leukemia (as malignant cells overwhelm the bone marrow), myelofibrosis and aplastic anemia (failure of white and red cell creation, along with poor platelet production). In addition, many common medications can cause leukopenia (eg. minocyclen, a commonly prescribed antibiotic).<br>  <br>  Other causes of low white blood cell count include: Influenza, systemic lupus erythematosus, Hodgkin's lymphoma, some types of cancer, typhoid, malaria, tuberculosis, dengue, Rickettsial infections, enlargement of the spleen, folate deficiencies, psittacosis and sepsis. Many other causes exist, such as a deficiency in certain minerals such as copper and zinc.<br>  <br>  Pseudoleukopenia can develop upon the onset of infection. The leukocytes (predominately Neutrophils, responding to injury first) are marginalized in the blood vessels so that they can scan for the site of infection. This means that even though there is increased WBC production, it will appear as though it is low from a blood sample, since the blood sample is of core blood and does not include the marginalized leukocytes.<br>  <br>  There are also reports of Leukopenia caused by Depakote (Divalproex Sodium or Valproic Acid), a drug used for epilepsy (seizures), mania (with bipolar disorder) and migraine.<br>  <br>  ^^ Straight from Wikipedia|`|ZTTdm4dWaa	Low white cell counts are a sign of HIV virus. <br>  <br>  White cells recognize the foreign objects in blood, and determine if they are good or bad.

QPWjtDzcaa	Science is indifferent to that which it cannot observe.  What a person beleives has nothing to do with how the universe operates.|`|5KaDHt5jaa	Yes.  You cannot follow a scientific reasoning and arrive at atheism.  Scientific reasoning arrives at agnosticism, because the scientific method doesn't allow you to say that something is not true, just because you have not observed it.  <br>  <br>  And being agnostic certainly doesn't mean that you believe the existence of god or not is 50/50.  Even a coin toss is not quite 50/50, but it still wouldn't make any sense to take a firm stance that it is going to be heads or tails.  Agnosticism means taking a firm stance that you cannot know without some information.  Atheism on the other hand, requires faith much as any religion does.  That doesn't mean it is wrong, but it might be.  It takes quite a bit of faith, in fact, since there is no way to prove that there is no omnipotent being.  <br>  <br>  So, by scientific reasoning, agnosticism makes sense.  But, it only makes sense scientifically.  Faith is completely different.  You don't choose faith.  You either have it or don't.  So it is entirely possible to be scientifically agnostic and an atheist in faith.|`|70503caf06f4695beca81e8a95fd439aaa	I'll let the experts speak for themselves<br>  <br>  From "Black Holes and Baby Universes", a series of lectures by Stephen Hawkins.<br>  <br>  ...There is a real problem here...the philosophers, have mostly not had enough mathematical background to keep up with modern developments in theoretical physics...the philosophers of science, who should be better equipped. But many of them are failed physicists who found it too hard to invent new theories and so took to writing about the philosophy of physics instead....they are not in touch with the present frontier of physics. <br>  <br>  Maybe I'm being too harsh on philosophers, but they have not been very kind to me. My approach has been described as naive and simpleminded. I have been variously called a nominalist, instrumentalist, a positivist, a realist, and several other ists...<br>  <br>  The people who actually make the advances in theoretical physics don't think in the categories that the philosophers and historians of science invent for them.

They chose that because that is how they feel (they have that right), and there is no solid evidence to make them think otherwise. The only evidence they have to work with, is bible, and Earth. The bible is contradictory, and was written by people who did not know Jesus (you can't assume it is true if they were not witnesses). Then the bible was re-written a bunch of times, to get what we have today, so it is not reliable. And the Earth could have been made without a God. We have science now, and the big bang theory fills in quite a bit of gaps that the bible had. Religion used to be something to keep you happy when you had a question that could never be answered, but Galileo (whim the church killed) proved them wrong about a lot of things. Knowing the scientific method is no substitute for in-depth research.|`|V1r0jN80aa	To those who say agnosticism is the natural result of Scientific thinking, I would ask this: would you consider it scientific to say, "I will continue to allow for the possibility of Santa Claus, since no one has ever shown absolute proof of his non-existence."?<br>  <br>  Once a kid gets old enough to understand a little bit about reality and to understand that his *parents* are the ones who put the presents under the tree, that jolly guy at the mall was an actor, reindeer can't fly, nobody lives at the North Pole, and fat men don't fit down most chimneys, then he will no longer believe in Santa Claus. The position is not equivocal and it does not require some kind of faith. People who don't believe in God are atheists and they arrived at that position in much the same way that a kid does, with reference to Santa Claus. To me, that is in NO way contradictory to rational or scientific thinking.|`|WPPIaLORaa	I think that you should consider the position of an atheist as one who rejects the deities because there is no physical evidence supporting them.   Atheists would clearly change their minds if there were strong evidence for one or more gods.  Atheists are not people who have faith that the gods do not exist.<br>  <br>  An agnostic is typically used for a person who is wishy-washy on the subject.  While it is in fact intellectually more correct to take a position of not knowing (agnostic), it is not the case that there is an even chance that there are gods or there are none.  That is, just because there are two choices does not imply that either are equally probable.   For example, what is the probability that there is a large pink elephant in my living room?  While there are two choices, the probability is not 50%.  <br>  <br>  From an external point of view, the agnostic is treated as someone for whom the probability of gods is 50%, while the atheist is treated as if he thinks it is just slightly more than 0%.|`|cKzfxE0Zaa	I used to think so, but I changed my mind when I learned that I had misunderstood what atheism means.<br>  <br>  Atheism is formed by the Latin prefix a-, which means simply either "not" or "without." It does not mean "opposed to." When you want to say (in Latin) that you are opposed to theism, you would call yourself an anti-theist, not an atheist.<br>  <br>  To be sure, there's nothing illogical about being both an anti-theist and an atheist, and there are lots of atheists who go the extra step of becoming anti-theists as well. These folks assert that god(s) don't exist in precisely the same way that theists assert that certain god(s) do exist.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, there are atheists who don't take that extra step. These atheists are simply "not theists" and are "without theism." Which means that they lack the belief that any gods exist. As to the existence of gods, they've reserved judgment on the matter.<br>  <br>  This is what most people think agnostics are. But in fact an agnostic has a belief that the atheist doesn't have. The agnostic believes that there isn't any way to tell whether gods exist or not. The non-dogmatic atheist doesn't even claim that much. As far as a non-dogmatic atheist is concerned, there might be a way to tell; he just hasn't found it yet.<br>  <br>  So non-dogmatic atheism, not agnosticism, is the philosophy pertaining to god-belief that is most consistent with the scientific method.

apJqvd1eaa	Congratulations, you have found an example where the terms "definite integral" and "indefinite integral" part ways.<br>  <br>  Note that these are two very different math concepts which are just bound tightly together by some theorems. However, these theorems have their assumptions and when these are not met, the relation can be lost.<br>  <br>  Your function has a definite integral of zero (**) on any interval but it does not have an indefinite integral (antiderivative). That is, you can formally make a function F(x) as<br>  F(x) = F(x) - F(0) + F(0) = F(0) + integral from 0 to x = F(0) = const.,<br>  but this is not the antiderivative of f(x) because f(x) is not its derivative. The mistake was made when claiming that such the antiderivative exists, that is, in the second = sign.<br>  <br>  <br>  More formally, the theorem you would need says:<br>  Let f is integrable on the interval <a,b>. The function F: <a,b> -> R, defined by<br>  F(x) = integral of f(x) from a to x,<br>  is continuous on <a,b>. If f is continuous in x0 in (a,b), then F is differentiable in x0 and it holds that F'(x0) = f(x0).<br>  <br>  See what prevents us from claiming that f(x) = 0 for all x? You already said that f is not continuous anywhere, but it is an assumption in this theorem. Thus we can't use it to claim that f(x) is the derivative of F(x) in any x.<br>  <br>  <br>  (**) The others are right that you need Lebesgue theory for this one, but it makes no difference in what I want to say. Moreover, the definition can be altered slightly (see the Riemann function below) to make it integrable in the Riemann theory while preserving its basic properties.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomae%27s_function" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomae%27s_...</a>|`|qaMPEdL2aa	I don't see how you get from the idea that there are more irrational numbers than rational numbers, to the idea that the integral must be zero.|`|Iw9YK558aa	This function is called Dirichlet's function.<br>  It isn't Riemann integrable, but I believe it is Lebesgue integrable (although I don't know how to do that!)<br>  <br>  I will return if I find anything useful :)<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  The idea of Riemann integration is that you "draw" rectangles under the function by partitioning the x-axis. If you have 1 rectangle, obviously the approximation isn't very good. As you increase the number of rectangles, the approximation becomes more accurate. So Riemann integration is the limit of the area as the number of recangles tends to infinity along the x-axis.<br>  Lebesgue integration is similar, but you divide the function up along the y-axis instead. Apparently this is much better... but I don't suppose I'll ever know why :(<br>  <br>  I don't think that there are more irrationals than rationals. I'm pretty sure that there is a rational between every irrational and an irrational between every rational. If there were more irrationals than rationals, then there would be at least one place where two irrational numbers were consectutive and hence there would exist at least one interval at which this function is continuous, which just isn't true.<br>  Anyway, will continue to look for useful things now :)<br>  <br>  Concerning the number of irrational numbers, I have included a link for Wikipedia (which is my bible!) about Dirichlet's function. It doesn't say much, but it does say that "...between any two irrationals, there is a rational, and vice versa."<br>  This is the reason that Dirichlet's function isn't Riemann integrable!!!!<br>  If there were intervals containing only irrational numbers, the function would be piece-wise continuous and hence Riemann integrable :)<br>  <br>  Oh yeah, I know about Cantor's theory. It's about differrent types of infinity. It claims that there are different types of infinity. So the infinity of the natural numbers is a smaller infinity than the infinity of the real numbers. That isn't to say that there are more irrational numbers than rational numbers in a finite interval though :)

tNnekUTIaa	There are really millions of factors that go into why a dog might do that.<br>  1.  Exercise -- dogs need a LOT of exercise.  If they don't get it, it can make them feel very frustrated and it takes very little to set them off.  It is good your dog goes to dog parks to play.   <br>  2.  Pack dynamics -- what was happening when they fought?  Was it over a toy?  Food?  Did the playing just get out of hand?   There are so many different kinds of aggression, it is important understand what the dog was actually being aggressive about.  Is someone in the family treating the dogs differently?    <br>  <br>  Some dogs do not have very good temperaments towards other dogs and may have to be moved to a home without other dogs.  The same goes for cats, kids, men, etc.  I hope that is not the case, but you never know.  I also disagree with trying to be the BOSS of the dog.  This can make it worse a lot of times.  Dogs are our partners and our friends.   Positive, fun TRAINING and attention will focus them on us and what we want.  I am very involved with dog training and dog agility and there is no way I could get the dogs to do what I can by having a domineering attitude!    Good luck!!|`|AUD1wZ5Kaa	If you have an aggressive dog, it's probably because it thinks it's the dominant one in the family (or whatever). So you should teach it that YOU are the boss of it, so that way they won't attack you because it thinks it's the boss. Lock it in a cage for a while if it does something bad so you can teach it a lesson. You should keep it away from other dogs, babies, and little kids. Since it's attacked, it's probably afraid that other dogs might attack it, and for it's own safety (it thinks), it might attack other dogs as well as humans on impulse.

GaEF8k3haa	The human body is a good conductor of electricity. There are several charged ions all over the body, and when an electric field is applied, they align in the direction of the field.<br>  <br>  I'm assuming you have never had an electric shock. In that case, the electricity finds your body as a nice, continuous path to reach ground.<br>  <br>  The reason mild shocks work in hospitals is due to this.|`|Fmo4ZgYjaa	Yes, they are all right , the human body conducts electricity.<br>  <br>  We had an electrified fence when I was younger, to keep the horses in, If you grabbed your friends arm with one hand and then the fence with the other, your friend would get the shock, not you.  Your body would conduct it right into them.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|2bHacnMBaa	Yes.  That is also why it is also possible to be struck by lightning.

It would not do to taser a perp while other cops were holding her down for example.<br>  <br>  Further, when people get electrocuted it's because the conducted current goes through their bodies and, typically, arrests their hearts and/or burns some vital organs...resulting in death.|`|WPPIaLORaa	Certainly the human body can conduct electricity.  That conduction allows for electrocardiograms which read the electrical activity of the heart through electrodes placed on the skin.  Electroencephalograms and peripheral nerve conduction tests also rely on such conductivity.

NbdTgyLPaa	As the first answer pointed out, rounding will certainly make a difference.  But as long as your intermediate figures all have at least one more significant digit than your final answer, then rounding has a minimal effect on the final result.<br>  <br>  However, my guess is more likely that your calculator used an algorithm that didn't work well at the values you wanted.  While calculators (and computers) are very fast, they typically do not calculate things like a human would.  They use algorithms for fast, accurate approximations.  Unfortunately, these algorithms can have ranges where their values are less accurate.<br>  <br>  I studied these in numerical analysis back in my college days, and we actually compared a couple of different calculators with certain using specific inputs for certain functions.  The professor used to work for HP to help them with their algorithms, so he had several examples where HP calculator algorithms were better than TI calculators, and vice versa.  I no longer recall any specific examples, but the second source I list has many brief examples of how calculators make mistakes.<br>  <br>  As a test to see if this is the case, you could try a different brand of calculator and see the result.  Or perhaps try a spreadsheet or some other math program.  (Of course the other source might use the same algorithm, but often they will use different ones and make mistakes at different values.)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|wBbasieQaa	Rounding to significant figures is always going to reduce the accuracy of the final result because you are discarding information. If you rounded at more than one stage of the calculation, the discrepancy would tend to get larger.<br>  <br>  A calculator has rounding error too, but since it doesn't care about significant digits it will use as much accuracy as it can.

oVz6sPsIaa	What is important is the number of turns per unit length and not the total number of turns.  This is somewhat of an idealization since it assumes the coil is sufficiently long to create a uniform magnetic field inside (ie, no fringing effects) and the coils are reasonably close together.
tsjLHXzUaa	I dont believe he was a mathematician... could be wrong though.  As I understand the hearsay, he wasnt particularly good at math.<br>  <br>  His contribution was strictly in the world of physics.  And the math of his most famous equation is pretty trivial from a purely mathematic perspective.|`|iTLutsayaa	He was a theoretical physicist.<br>  Tensor analysis was full of summation signs. The Einstein summation convention is that a summation sign is assumed whenever two indices are repeated. This was more of a mathematical simplification, than a new theory. But it greatly simplified tensor analysis, visually. His use of tensors was in a beautiful equivalence of gravity and geometry. In three dimensional geometry (~differential geometry) tensors are also used. He also came up with the Einstein tensor. Geometry is mathematics, physics is applied mathematics, and the line between what is physics and what is mathematics is not a clear one; they overlap. His theory of general relativity greatly increased the popularity of tensors. So his contributions to mathematics are minor, in a way, but his contributions to physics was phenomenal.|`|3tXYE7KHaa	Einstein explains his famous formula E=mc2
He2WsvBcaa	The line spectrum of an element would always be the same, because of the wavelengths of the spectra. Hydrogen atoms give off light in the form of line spectra when viewed through a spectrascope. The only difference would be how much brighter or dimmer the light appears to be depending on how much energy was absorbed by the element's electrons.
