They should be listed in your telephone book under government services. You could also check with the state unemployment office if you can't find something in the telephone book. I believe some states have training programs for which they will pay if you are out of work. That may not be something you will need but the food stamps and SSI are fairly easy to qualify I would think, especially when children are involved.
NrOg2hrZaa	They have the same problem as every business owner right now.  Costs of our supplies go up, but we can't pass it on to the consumer because they don't want to or don't have the resources to pay more for the product.  So, they lower portions and keep the price the same and hope the consumers don't notice.    This happens at the grocery store also.  Example:  A box of cereal has 2 less ounces in it, at the same price as before.  You just don't notice because the size of the box is the same as always.    I read an article on how the food you buy looks the same package wise, but has less in it.  You'd be surprised at how many companies are doing this.    It's the old saying... what you don't know won't hurt you.    Companies are making up for higher costs by passing it on to the consumer but letting us believe that we are getting the same quantity as always.|`|544d4d22efd48630201dfea5769def24aa	The financial crisis is something that affects most every aspect of our consumer lives. Basically, it's a domino effect. Your salary is lowered or you're laid off and so you start saving more money and spending less on luxury items, like Starbucks or other unnecessary treats.     With people cutting back and food prices soaring, restaurants are having to cut back the best way they know how, or make price changes to keep their food at the level their customers expect.     Retailers are suffering the same fate, with many like Circuit City selling products or services that aren't considered a necessity in our lives. Sure we can't live without our laptops, digital cameras, but in a money crisis, new technology or upgrades are usually the first thing to go.     Hopefully this helps!

mNjjSPdVaa	The reason people tell you to avoid get rich quick schemes, is because they are usually that... schemes.  There are ways to earn income quickly, but they all require that you do your homework first.  There's a lot involved.  It also depends on your age and how much experience/knowledge you have already.  You're on the right track, you can make far more income by running your own business or working from home but it's important that you learn how first.  There are excellent books out there to teach you how to do things the right way.  Usually when you get your information from a book, it's a little more believable because the author has taken the time to either do it or gathered a lot of valuable information.  One book I recommend is called "Your Portable Empire" by Pat O'Bryan.  You can pick it up fairly cheap on Amazon.

mwkfirjRaa	No, not if you are doing a rollover.  You will have to pay regular income tax but not the penalty.  However, there is such a thing as a Roth 401k, and you can roll over from that kind of 401k directly into a Roth IRA without paying taxes on the distribution.    Until recently, you had to first rollover the funds from a 401k into a traditional IRA and then later convert the traditional IRA into a Roth IRA.  You no longer need to take this additional step.    Make sure you request a direct rollover, so that the administrator of your 401k does not take withholding.

This will give you all the lender info too. The hardest part, is getting the people to vacate the properties. Be prepared to go to court, and file evictions, etc. If the homes have squatters occupying them.....they are even tougher to kick out.

oS1TBzL6aa	Speculation: Buying an asset that you expect to go up in value.  (colloquially: buying a very risky asset one that has a high likelihood of loosing value but is expected by the buyer to have huge growth)    Hedging: taking a contrary position to your main investment to offset any down side risk.  The simplest example is a trucking company buying oil futures.  In this case if the price of oil goes up the trucking company has thinner margins, but by buying Oil futures the cost is (to varying degrees based on the sizes of the positions) offset by the gain in the value of the oil futures.    Cheers,  A.T. Cunningham|`|3IfBUUH0aa	Hedging -     Mr Bloggs own 1000 shares in BakeyBiscuits outright, and they are 20p each on the market.    Mr Jones (the hedgefund guy) BORROWS Mr Bloggs 1000 shares for a period of time (1 Month) and 'sells' them when they rise, he must then buy them back when they fall and give them back to Mr Bloggs at the end of the Month. (remember Jones only borrows the shares he never owns them)    If Mr Jones is successful then he will have sold BakeyBiscuits at 35p and bought them back at say 15p before the time period (month) expires.  (in this instance he is 'hedging' that the price will rise, it can also work in reverse where he hedges that the price will fall - basically it's all a gamble as to which way the price goes)    If the price falls below 20p then Mr Jones has to still buy the shares back and then he takes the loss.    Edit:  Yep! I stand corrected!|`|qWaYbxcxaa	Speculating:    Taking higher risks beyond reason in anticipation of a future (forward) event(s).    Hedging:     Seeking to protect existing position(s) by taking an offsetting position.|`|HxBhOZjZaa	That's not exactly right.    What the person above described was the process of Short selling. Hedging is simply taking multiple positions to mitigate risk. Short selling is of course a common technique used to mitigate risk and going long is also the same.     Speculation is the term used to describe qualitative means of changing the prices of securities.|`|AA10007793	Hedging - non-correlated or off-setting investments to minimize risk    Speculation - : assumption of risk in hopes of obtaining commensurate gain|`|28Pz8nt7aa	Hedging is a way of reducing your potential risk. Let's say you own a call option on the FTSE100 and you are worried that if the FTSE100 may drop suddenly by 10% in one day, you could sell the FTSE100 future (the right amount, obviously) so that if it happens you lose 10% on the option but gain 10% on the future.  It's a bit like a bookmaking who has too many bets on one horse. He will lay-off bets with another bookmaker just in case that horse wins and wipes him out which is the same as hedging.Hedging will reduce your potential profit but also reduce your potential loss.  Speculating is just laying out money in the hope that it will make you more money. Another word for gambling really, but usually apply to assets that you believe will rise in value (or go down if your are shorting)  NOT what hedge funds do, well not entirely anyway.

ZeDjn4cVaa	The IRS will only withhold your refund if they have reason to believe that you should have filed and their computer are tagged that a prior year tax return is missing from you.  Many people do not file every year  because in some  years they do not  make enough to need  to file or are  due a refund of a small amount and do not  bother to file.  So depending upon the  situation  you may get  your refund for 2008 even though  you have not yet filed for 2007.    If you have received a letter from the IRS requesting you to file for 2007, then you probably won't  receive you refund for 2008 until you they receive and process  your 2007 return.    Richard K  Master Tax Advisor  Enrolled Agent    This advice was based upon my understanding of the tax law in effect at the time it was written as it applies to the facts described by you.  See my profile for more information.|`|dd3cf2065a180ccacbe77ef40493ab96aa	This is what will happen, you didn't file 2007 so IRS will hold your 2008 Refund and send you a letter telling you that since you have not filed they are holding the refund until your 2007 tax return is received and process.  Processing previous years takes up to 12 weeks to process.  File now,  Refund hold return need to be  mailed to Internal Revenue Service PO Box 149338 Austin TX 78714-9338  Then when IRS process your return and you owe your refund for 2008 will be offset to your 2007 debt and if any remaining it will be issued to you.      FYI: IRS can't can't offset you refund if you have not filed and IRS has not filed for you yet.
tw44fqCpaa	The net profit of the non-employee compensation gets taxed.  That means the income left after the business expenses have been entered.      If you're asking how to calculate how much on a specific amount then you take the net amount, multiply by .9235, then multiply that by .153.  So roughly it amounts to 14%.  That is just the self employment tax portion.  Then it's also subject to income tax at whatever your marginal tax rate is (5%, 10%, 15%...)    Edit:  Ok you received a 1099 (you don't submit it).  So you file a 1040, Schedule C Profit or Loss from Business, and Schedule SE Self Employment Tax.      On the Schedule C you enter the 1099 income and expenses.  The net profit of that goes on the Schedule SE to figure the self employment tax.  Those numbers are entered on to your main 1040 form.  You should have been making estimated payments and yes you will have to pay an underpayment penalty.|`|0frJH1zKaa	It depends on what tax bracket you're in. You also have SE tax.

Reality is otherwise.|`|e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	State Case Law, determines liability.    Several comments, though:     1.  The other insurance company has NO duty of good faith towards you, legally.    2.  Just because there is a policy, does NOT mean that the driver is covered - if they are an excluded operator, even though there is a valid policy, coverage would not apply.    3.  They will NEVER pay out more than the policy limit - which might have all gone to the other party.    4.  Regardless of the ticket, if their policyholder says that YOU had the red light, they have to take their policyholder's word for it, unless proven otherwise.     They could be waiting for the police report.  If the cop wrote him up for running a red light, that's one thing - and in your favor.  But if it was too fast for conditions, or something else, they have to take thier guy's word over yours.     If they only have $10K to work with, and there are TWO damaged cars, you can pretty much bet that you won't get enough to even fix your car - let alone pay for a rental.     The limit of liabiltiy for the INSURANCE company - which means, the MOST they have to pay - is the policy limit.  $10,000 PER ACCIDENT, for all damages.  If the other guy is paid the whole $10,000 for their car, then there's nothing left to pay you.  You'll have to sue the driver directly.      Your best bet, is to file this claim under YOUR insurance.  Because clearly, you're going to be out of pocket on this claim, due to the limit issue, if nothing else.|`|9k4d7Kytaa	I'm sorry to hear about your situation, it sounds like it's not going to work out too well for you.  You're right that it's not fair that you may be out of pocket for any of the costs, but that's the reality.  Each state sets their own minimum liability requirements and it sounds like that limit is $10k for property damage in your state...my state is the same way and it's far too low.  It's ridiculous that states continue to allow drivers to carry that small amount of insurance.  These laws were typically written in the 70's at the latest and some states are too stuborn or lazy to update them.    Now on to your situation.  I understand your frustration that it appears that Century is dragging their feet...but it's justified.  You are not their client, the red-light runner is their client (assuming he's the policy owner).  Their responsibility is to him, not you.  It's common for insurance companies to refuse to accept fault until they have at least had the opportunity to question their client about the incident.  Sometimes, this can take a long time.  Sounds like the red-light runner is in no hurry to talk to his insurance company.  Normally, if the insurance company has not been able to contact their client within 30 days of the date the claim was reported, they will make a liability decision based upon the information that they were able to gather up to that time.    Normally I do not immediately advise people to go through their own insurance.  This is usually costly and inefficient, but you do have the right to do so.  In your case, since the red-light runner damaged two vehicles, isn't communicating with his insurance company and apparently only has $10k in property damage libiality, it may be a good idea to go through your own insurance if you have the coverage to do so.    If you have underinsured motorist property damage coverage (not available in all states) than this will cover the cost to repair your vehicle and typically does not have a deductible.  If you don't have this coverage, you'd have to file a collision claim and you'd be subject to your deductible.  Your insurance company would attempt to recooperate your deductible for you, but only after they recooperate all of the money they paid out for the claim.  It's also unlikely they'll be able to do this since there probably won't be enough insurance to cover it and most companies won't bother trying to subrogate from an individual.  If you don't have collision coverage or underinsured motorist PD, then you're out of luck.    Also, you may have rental reimbursement coverage on your policy to help pay to put you in a rental car.    I'm very sorry to hear about your predicament.  Unfortunately this is very common when people are too irresponsible to purchase sufficient limits of liability.  Now you know why your agent has always tried to get you to buy high limits.  Good luck.

11926215c18b5fc901a2223155a0eb17aa	It's really frustrating when you are all ready to leave your job and you have to still deal with your boss whilst you are working your notice.  Your boss also may think he can get away with whatever he likes because you are leaving. <br>  <br>  The most important thing you can do is to rise above it all because it would be far to easy for him to make things difficult for you when you move on if you do give him a piece of your mind.  <br>  <br>  I would also strongly suggest that you document everything that he is doing and when you have compiled the things which he has done you can report him for his unprofessional behaviour and it should be investigated - if you are from the UK I would advise that you raise a grievance and say that he is making your notice period untenable, if you make a good enough case you may end up being paid your notice without having to work it! <br>  <br>  Just realise that you are being the better person here and you will be leaving and getting on somewhere else and he is stuck where he is.  Whatever you do don't let him get to you and end up doing something you regret.  it's his responsibility to act in a professional manner and if you don't respond to his pathetic behaviour now it should embarass him and he may stop.  <br>  <br>  Good luck with it all.|`|5369a74f50b6f584a3f86ff630992da1aa	i too have been having similar issues with my boss recently. No matter what I do she manages to find some fault or other and often just moves the goal posts so that I never really know what she's going to expect next. One day out of the blue she said I wasn't entitled to a tea break anymore even though I was 7 month pregnant at the time. She was just always finding something to make herself feel powerful & in control.<br>  Eventually we had a massive row! Several infact!<br>  I don't care that she's my boss - she's not a better or more important person than me just because she's a Head Teacher.<br>  Anyway, things were getting really bad and she was threatening all sorts of things like disiplinarys etc even though her problem with me was personnal and not related to how I actually did my job. So I decided to take things above her head - even bosses have bosses.<br>  It's the best thing I could've done. We had a meeting with senior  folk in education & personnel and she was told on several issues that she was out of line.<br>  It hasn't changed the fact that we still don't like each other but she now knows I won't be bullied or pushed around just because she's my line manager. Very often these people allow the smallest bit of power or control go to their heads.<br>  Say your peace is my advice!<br>  Take no sh!t off anybody!<br>  Good luck!|`|7339815b97efee0862e9b9ad4ce3eeb3aa	I just wanna say mate your recent answer about Man Utd fans was top class.

According to her: You have to type around 220 words per minute on a special typewriter that only has about 20 keys.  So there is not a single key for each letter, some letters you have to hold down up to 5 keys at once.  Apparently you can make really good money at this and it's on a freelance basis.  Sometimes even $1000 per day if you are working a lot.  You get paid by the page rather than the hour so if you get a very chatty trial you make more money than if people talk less.

Since most legitimate brokerages with good spreads are basically the same, concentrate on the system you'll be using once you sign up.<br>  <br>  Sure, you can use all of the references given here to supplement any broker, but PremiereTrade gives it all to you at your fingertips in one place.

There are also international associations bringing the businessmen of different countries together. These associations are helpful for getting meaningful information. <br>  My recommendations are:<br>  1-) Contact the Chinese embassy in your country asking for information about the chinese manufacturers of the products you want to import! Contact by e-mail, mail or phone. From my experiences, none of my inquries returned empty. Embassies are quiete helpful to potential importers.<br>  2-) If you know any major manufacturer of the products you want to import, contact its agent/representative or distributer. Major firms would probably not sell directly to you but through intermediaries they may be contacted.<br>  3-) Stay away from sites like alibaba.com. They are just rubbish.<br>  4-) Golf products manufacturers may have their own association.

Most small businesses go under!<br>  But, if you still want to loan money to a small business, I would think you would want to see some sort of business plan.  Most businesses don't plan to fail, they fail to plan.<br>  <br>  Negotiate what your money is worth.  If you invested it elsewhere, what would be it's return on investment. Use that as your base.  Remember, investing in a small business is really risky, the returns should be higher than normal, just don't may it too high, you can be charged with Usery charges.  What are they willing to put up as collateral for the loan.  Caution, check with your local athorities, if you receive % of profits, you might be considered part owner even though you have nothing to do with the day-2-day operation.  That might leave you liable in some way...|`|2e7edc32a8153e41fff68023c059d81baa	It depends on the type of business and the amount of money borrowed.

TwqIpHJLaa	I'm not sure I understand the question but if you're being paid weekly, your deductions for federal and state taxes ought to be pretty close to 1/52 of your annual tax liability...assuming your pay is essentially level throughout the year.    So if your total annual federal tax obligation = $2000, you'd divide that figure by 52 to get a weekly average of about $38.46.  You'd do the same calculation for the state taxes.  Hope this helps.

Take the survey. $1.00<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  You just simple do what it says. You take the survey and then click "Done". After that the offer will go into your pending funds. When the company verifies that you have completed the offer it will then go into your approved funds and you receive the money. <br>  <br>  <br>  Mabutu's Hut <br>  Now for the fun part. This is what makes Treasure Trooper stand out from the rest. <br>  <br>  You can actually play a side game with the site. <br>  <br>  When you complete an offer and click "Done" you will automatically be given a gold cluster. Then after that you can play the side game. The side game will display 3 clams.

This adds up quick. So far this month I have made about $40.00 from what my referrals have done with the site. If you find yourself having trouble getting referrals then just purchase the pearl bracelet. This item will give you 2 referrals. So when someone signs up but didnt register under another member they automatically become yours and you start earning money off of what they do with the site.

Intuit, IRS delays rile online tax filers  As record numbers of people get online to file their tax returns, an Intuit power outage and Internal Revenue Service backlogs have coincided to delay confirmations of those returns, leaving some electronic filers in limbo.    The delays have frustrated electronic filers, who are accustomed to speedier confirmations. A thread on Excite's TurboTax message board has logged more than 100 messages dating back to February 4 on the topic of the delays.    Intuit blamed the IRS for the trouble earlier this month, and partially for more recent delays as well. The IRS acknowledged that confirmations for electronic return filings were slower than usual this year because of high traffic. Last week there was trouble with a "major filer" and a subsequent glut of filings over the holiday weekend.    But the IRS stressed that none of its confirmations exceeded its self-imposed 48-hour window for turning around confirmations.    The IRS has 10 service centers around the country, five of which process electronic filings. The service has started diverting 40 percent of its traffic from the Cincinnati center to the Memphis center, which uses more modern equipment. Next year, the IRS plans to process all of its electronic filings out of Memphis.      Intuit has also contributed to the delays, suffering an internal power outage Monday afternoon. Though the outage lasted just 10 minutes, it took the company more than 24 hours to double check the system prior to bringing the power back up, hobbling the TurboTax online services until last night.    Intuit is investigating the cause of the outage.    Both the IRS and Intuit blamed the longer-than-usual turnarounds for confirmations on an increase in electronic filings this year. As of Friday, the IRS had handled 13.3 million returns so far this year, 11 percent more than the same period last year.     Reliability and customer service are twin challenges facing e-commerce and other Web-based services. A recent pricing debacle at Buy.com cost that Web site more than $60,000 and considerable customer service credibility.    Those filing electronically using TurboTax griped about the delays, but the delays have not turned them off online filing.    "Using Quicken and Intuit has saved me hundreds of dollars, maybe thousands," noted one News.com reader. "But it's still irritating that a company that makes such fine software can't do a little better on customer service basics."   By the way I filed and was accepted 1/17/09 and originally said expect by 2/03/09 now changed to expect by 2/10/09.|`|viGqMW1Xaa	IRS Offers Tips to Avoid Recovery Rebate Credit Confusion  "Some individuals who did not get the economic stimulus payment, and a smaller number of those who did, may be eligible for the recovery rebate credit."  (EMAILWIRE.COM, January 30, 2009 ) WASHINGTON  In response to errors showing up on early tax filings, the Internal Revenue Service today urged taxpayers and tax preparers to make sure they properly determine eligibility for the recovery rebate credit before they file their 2008 federal tax returns.    Some individuals who did not get the economic stimulus payment, and a smaller number of those who did, may be eligible for the recovery rebate credit. However, most taxpayers who received the economic stimulus payment last year will not qualify for the recovery rebate credit on their 2008 federal income tax return.    An early sampling of tax returns shows about 15 percent have errors involving the recovery rebate credit. Some tax returns erroneously claim the credit, do not claim the proper amount of recovery rebate credit or mistakenly enter the amount of the stimulus payment they received on the recovery rebate credit line.    To avoid delays in tax refunds, it is critical that taxpayers know the correct amount of the stimulus payment they received last year, if any, to help determine whether they qualify for the recovery rebate credit now.    The amount of the stimulus payment will not be entered directly on the tax return. For people using a paper tax return, the stimulus payment amount will be required when completing a related worksheet. For people using tax software, the stimulus payment amount will be needed as part of the return preparation process.    How to Get the Recovery Rebate Credit Right    The IRS sent taxpayers nearly 119 million stimulus payments last year. There are three ways individuals can find out how much they received:    Check the amount listed on Notice 1378, which the IRS mailed last year to individuals who received the economic stimulus payment.  Go to the How Much Was My Stimulus Payment? tool that is available on the IRS Web site, IRS.gov. This can provide the correct amount in a matter of a few seconds.  Individuals can call the IRS at 1-866-234-2942. After a brief recorded announcement they can select option one to find out the amount of their economic stimulus payment. They will need to provide their filing status, Social Security Number and number of exemptions.  With the amount of last years economic stimulus payment in hand, the taxpayer can then enter the figure on the recovery rebate credit worksheet or in the appropriate location when tax preparation software requests it.    If the taxpayer or preparer is using tax software, the amount of the rebate recovery credit will automatically be calculated and reported properly. If the taxpayer is using the paper method, the rebate recovery credit, as determined through the worksheet, should be reported on Line 70 of Form 1040, Line 42 of Form 1040A or Line 9 of Form 1040EZ.    For most taxpayers, the correct entry for the recovery rebate credit will either be blank or zero.    If there is any question at all as to the amount that should be reported for the recovery rebate credit, the taxpayer or preparer should enter a zero on the appropriate line above, and the IRS will determine whether a recovery rebate credit is due, and, if so, how much.    Some of the major factors that could qualify you for the recovery rebate credit include:    Your financial situation changed dramatically from 2007 to 2008.  You did not file a 2007 tax return.  Your family gained an additional qualifying child in 2008.  You were claimed as a dependent on someone elses return in 2007 but cannot be claimed as dependent by someone else in 2008.  Stimulus Payments Not Taxable; Reports of Extensive Refund Delays False    The IRS has received a number of recurring questions involving stimulus payments and the recovery rebate credit. Here are some important tips to keep in mind:    Taxability. The economic stimulus payment is not taxable and it should not be reported as income on the 2008 Form 1040, 1040A or 1040EZ.    Refund delays. IRS personnel are aware of reports that errors in claiming the recovery rebate credit could delay tax refunds for as much as eight to 12 weeks. These reports are false. As the IRS detects and corrects return errors concerning the recovery rebate credit, refund delays are currently no longer than about one week.    One payment. In addition, the IRS notes taxpayers will receive a single refund that includes any recovery rebate credit to which they are entitled. The IRS will not be issuing separate recovery rebate credit payments.    Refund amounts. The IRS reminds taxpayers they should not use their regular refund from last year in calculating the recovery rebate credit. Some taxpayers may be confusing their regular tax refunds with the economic stimulus payment they received when completing their 2008 tax return.|`|y46FXf62aa	Really, I will like to help but what exactly is your question?

I had not changed anything either, I have a cousin who use to work in processing the Customer Service People are given pat answers to give to you, but the reality is that ever year a select number of returns claiming EITC are pulled for Quality Control and gone over manually if nothing has changed  then they will go ahead and finish processing it.

DDYwnut6aa	You can rest assured that they will take their money out of your refund.   You'll get the remainder about the time they say you will.|`|LOrFtSCHaa	Yes, definitely you will be deducted the amount owed.|`|AA10469473	They'll deduct the amount owed, and it will almost surely delay your refund or the balance, but maybe by only a week.
0frJH1zKaa	See 1040 instructions page 17. As you can see, you can't be claimed as a dependent if you provided more than half your own support.

See the link below.|`|AA10469473	If you are not a dependent, you can get a credit for some of your tuition and fees if you have any tax liability.  If you are a dependent, your parents or whoever you are dependent on gets the credit.

rKpstdUcaa	Bid price is the amount people are willing to buy shares for, if you are trying to sell this is the price you will get for them.  The ask price or offer price is the amount people are willing to sell for, if you are buying this is the price you will get.|`|5dXsErAaaa	In the markets orders to buy and sell stock are made The BID is the highest price someone is willing to buy and the ASK is the lowest price someone is willing to sell,|`|AA10007793	http://www.sec.gov/answers/bid.htm    The bid is the price at which you can sell a stock and the ask is what you can buy a stock from a market maker.|`|q8vILEpfaa	A bid price is what someone has bid (or pledged ) to buy.    Ask price is what the seller is asking for what they are selling.|`|L8iYlaAuaa	Ask price is what you will pay  Bid price is what you will get when you sell.    Can get complex is sometimes a method of charging.  Remember Bid to get rid.|`|28Pz8nt7aa	Yes it can be confusing, especially when we have two systems (at least in UK). One is called market driven. Here Market Makers are setting prices so you take the terms from their point of view; the MMs are BIDding for stock so they buy at that price and you are selling. Or they are ASKing a price for stock. I would say BID & OFFER, less confusing.  However on an order driven system like SETS the orders are setting the prices so you could put your sale order on at the offer price.  Have a look at http://www.shareworld.co.uk where there is an article about Level2 and you can ask questions there after reading the article.  Maybe a simple way not to get confused is that the price that you can sell at is always a little bit lower than the price you can buy at, so th bid is the lower price and the ask or offer is always the higher price (except in a backwardation!!)
LOrFtSCHaa	One thing does not affect the other, he should go back to single and zero in his paystub, because then they will take as much money for taxes as they can and you will get a nice refund when filing.|`|AA10469473	It has no effect on how you can file.  They probably took out more than they had to, so your refund would be larger than if he had gotten it changed earlier.|`|uRqlSq6caa	The W4 that he filled out as being single will only affect how much is being withheld.  He is just withholding more, it will not affect your tax filing.      You should adjust your withholding to roughly the amount that you owe.  Don't let the government use your money for free.|`|1H7aNVT3aa	Not at all, it doesn't matter what's on the W-4, that just determines how much they withheld.  So they withheld from his check as if he were single, which means that he probably had too much taken out (if you don't work or earn significantly less), meaning a bigger refund.|`|81wShS3taa	All that means is his employer withheld taxes from his wages at a slightly higher rate.  It has no affect on your tax return.  You will file married filing jointly as you normally would.  His W2 will reflect how much taxes were withheld.  Your tax liability is based on income received.  You should actually received a larger refund, since more taxes were withheld.

AA11284831	The support test does NOT require you to provide more than half of his support.  The support test is met as long as he doesn't provide more than half of his OWN support.    You don't compare your income to his.  You compare the support that he provides for himself to the total cost of supporting him.  That includes the rental value of your home, all utilities, food, clothing, medical care, education, etc.  The money that he spends on "booze and broads" does not count as "support" that he provides for himself.|`|0frJH1zKaa	See IRS Pub 501, page 9. If you are providing a home for him chances are you are providing more than half his support. By the way the rule is not that you provide more than half, it's that he not provide more than half his own support. So if he doesn't have his own house or apartment he probably isn't.    http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p501.pdf    TaxRef  http://www.pdftax.com/    P.S. Bostonian has it right.

In fact, they are usually much faster than the 5-6 days for ground shipping that they suggest.  I have ordered DVDs and Books and seen them arrive in 2-3 days (with free shipping).<br>  <br>  One last note, just keep in mind that if you don't live close to a major metro area you will probably have to wait a little longer for shipping.

If you're perfectly healthy, and a healthy weight, at your age, $200 a month for a low/no deductible HMO style plan, is a fair price.      But you're absolutely wrong about not being able to work full time.  You CAN work full time, and go to school full time.  LOTS of people do it.|`|eXTOmPLsaa	Here is a great site that will give you multiple quotes on health insurance.     http://www.HealthQuote.gkenter.com|`|SLSX6QQsaa	If you are going to college, they usually have special health care plans for students only.  At my school, we have one for $1000 per year which only covers emergencies (like hospital visits and surgeries) as well as doctor visits and treatment at a specific doctors office near campus.  The community college I use to go to had one for $200 per semester which covered emergency costs only, like surgeries, etc...nothing else.  Also depending on what your state has available, you may be eligible for some programs for inexpensive insurance.  In Michigan, we have Blue Care Network HMO for single women under age 30 who are at least part time students. You can buy that for around $90 per mo. and dental for about $10 more.  Maybe your state has something state funded or similar.|`|AA11985435	If your friend is working u may be able to get on his/her insurance for domestic partnership. Otherwise talk to an independent insurance agent that deals with an insurance broker. They represent many companies, therefore u can get multiple quotes from which to choose. Then research the companies and look for their ratings...A+ is best, but a bit less rating is ok.............good luck.
AA10469473	With your added details, it sounds like at least it was legal for her to claim your son, and she doesn't need your permission.  And if the dad is a dependent, she doesn't need his permission either.    No way to know how much she'd get from claiming your son - could be anywhere from zero to several thousand dollars, depending among other things on her income.  What your brother would have gotten has no bearing on what his sister would get unless their incomes and other circumstances are identical.    And if the child didn't live with your brother, it would have been illegal for him to claim your son|`|39c2446b919f263832a80ca402b9f06eaa	Sounds like tax fraud to me...

QgXN2kB6aa	yes,  increases unemployment taxes.|`|gxw1fP2aaa	Of course ... they've spent money and time training and educating an employee and lose that when someone is laid off.  No business wants to lay employees off, but labor is the highest cost in most businesses, so it comes down to laying people off or letting the business fail.|`|b1be56f41a1af65af89a7fabde24526aaa	No. It's bad for the employer. The people who say who maybe adamant about this do not know the reality or the cause, or reasons. Nor do they it's business and employer can hire someone else. Remember, recession, credit crunch and plenty of people looking for jobs.    Doesn't mean, that firing someone for nothing, for being some boss who likes making people lives bad is...right. It's wrong.    But if the employer needs to make a decision, based on the future of his or her company, the stability of the company, the team, then this person must make hard decisions that normal, average, people don't make and won't because they want to save the world but cant't pay their own bills.    If the employer does let go of a worker, like I did in past, then I would make it easy for him or her. What I did, is made sure the person knew, and then helped them by giving them three months salary advance on top of their wages they got.    They have a family and one must look after those who gave time to their company with respect.    Then I got agency to help find the person find work. So relationship between me and the worker is good.     Then when business grew, I called him and if he is happy where he is. He was but if he wasn't, or still unemployed, I would have hired him back.    When one cares for the their business and also the workers, they will make a hard decision. Sometimes it's a decision that even I didn't like to make in those times but I rather not hurt the rest of the team, and the worker themself by lying.    Best that honesty and transparency is there.    No, an employer does not get affected except, if he has to let someone go and the boss has no finances to hire someone in place. Then difficulty and work load may arise.    Finally, if its a big company and the company did not have good relationship with their workers, then it be bad. It is only bad when company do not treat their workers from day one, with respect.    If they did the workers would understand and that relationship will be there.    The problem is, we do not find such ethics that easy with many companies and with many workers doing a honest job of the day.    Many companies are in a recession and credit but some companies just didn't look further ahead as most|`|Pjm9pg7iaa	Yes, very bad, You have an employee trained and ready to work; and you have to send them home. Knowing that they may be long-gone when business picks up and you wish you could have her back at work..
AA10072911	Part of your credit score is the length of your credit.  If you close the account that has been open the longest it will lower the average age of your account significantly and definitely hurt your credit score.  As long as they aren't charging you an annual fee I would say leave the account open.|`|VSpqYAabaa	Sometimes cancelling a card does effect your credit rating.  I don't know that from personal experience, but I read it somewhere.  It may be best to just pay it off and put it away and not use that one.  Use the one with the lowest finance rating.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	Even if you close your Chase account it will still show on your credit report as an account closed by the user and closed   in good standing (if you had no  lates ).  It will also reflect the date the account was opened and the date it was closed. So your credit report will still reflect it as your oldest account. I would advise you to pay off and  cancel Chase, 25% interest rate is close to usury.   Personally I think two credit cards are sufficient for your credit score and personal use. I make it a habit to use only one card for all charges, that way I only have one charge card bill to pay not 2. If  you pay your balance in full every time it doesn't matter but if you don't pay in full, use the card with the lower rate for everything.|`|s5Oa83sYaa	if oyu always pay on time kepp em no harm done|`|Sozc3MyFaa	Yes, you need to keep it--just don't use it.  Closing the oldest card will hurt you and will decreasing your available credit.  Ratings are also based upon the credit availability to actual credit used --"people" want to see a wide span between avail credit & actual credit used.  Closing the card will lower your avail credit.  Just don't use it & let it sit there.  It won't harm you.

prv0iuNDaa	The previous answer is not correct.  It is not just like buying any other house!<br>  <br>  First of all you are dealing with a bank and not an individual Seller.  It takes time to get a response from a bank and during the wait other offers may arise. <br>  <br>  If you are the initial offer that is accepted by the bank, it will usually be accepted "subject to court approval".  You will do all your due diligence (mortgage approval, home inspection, etc.) and spend the money on these.<br>  <br>  At court there may appear competing offers and all potential Buyers will be made aware of your offer with instructions to re-submit all offers and that they must be higher than yours.  Offers at this time will all have to be "subject free".  If you are submitting an offer at this time it will be "subject free".<br>  <br>  If you were the initial offer that brought the property to court you may lose out to another offer at this stage, lose the money you invested to this stage on inspections, and have to start all over again.  This could be traumatic if you were planning to move in on the date of your original offer.  It can be very stressful.  In the frenzy of the sealed bid process, the price the house sells for, if there is multiple offers, is often much higher than the list price and the original offer.<br>  <br>  This doesn't seem to be much like buying a usual house from an individual now does it.|`|AA11313325	Well for one you can buy them cheap and the bad part is you buy as is.

The rest is the  same as buying the house.

The book Civil Disobedience another of his books, is an analysis of the individuals relationship to the state that focuses on why men obey governmental law even when they believe it to be unjust.    There are no ways that you can get around paying your taxes legally even if you object with what the government does and I agree with you many of the things that the government does is unjust.|`|fSlZQzS4aa	You do not have the right as an individual to withhold payment of money that is used to pay for governmental activities you disapprove of.

Some only require a good credit score while others will require full financial underwriting of your finances.    If you don't know a surety agent, start with whomever you have your personal insurance with. If they can't take care of the bond they will have a relationship with an agent that can.    Good luck|`|e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	The one that does the rest of your business insurance.    You're going to need an agent, anyway - you can't usually buy a bond directly.
lbR1IoiSaa	$10,000 of med-pay is NOT overkill, even with a HSA that has a $5,000 deductible, with coverage of 100% after that, because most all policies have lifetime limits, and most all policies have exclusions (things they will absolutely NOT pay for).   Even if you don't see yourself ever using all of your benefits, you just NEVER know!     Case in point:  My daughter was almost killed in a car accident in October 08, by a woman who ran a stop sign.  My daughter had a HSA through her employer, with OUTSTANDING coverage, to include a $1000 deductible for the year, and 100% coverage after that.  She also had $5,000 med-pay coverage on her auto insurance.      She's almost maxed out the med-pay coverage because some things related to her injury, are 'exclusions' (uncovered items) in the HSA policy provided by her employer.  Also, now with the new year, her employer changed healthcare plans, and now my daughter's plan is quite different, with not near the same benefits and coverages, the bills and 'uncovered' expenses keep coming and she's nowhere near being close to recovered.      She's hoping to get the green light to drive again, just purchased another car, and upped her med pay coverage to $10k, because she wants to be sure she's got the max.       We always thought that something like this would never happen to us, our family etc, but you just NEVER know.      The difference in med-pay coverage costs you literally pennies on the dollar, I'd rather have as much as I can get in my time of need.     Rest easy, you're doing everything you can to protect your assets.  When you're involved in an accident, the last thing you want to do is have to worry about how you'll be able to "pay to get better."  Especially if your accident happens close to the end of the year and your HSA changes :(.|`|UDxL7lPqaa	It isn't for your medical coverage.  Read the auto policy.|`|e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	Are you SURE?  In some states, health insurance isn't required to cover medical bills from an auto accident.  Additionally, med pay will cover some things that health insurance doesn't - like modifications to your house or car, if you lose a limb.  Additionally, in your case, with a $5,000 deductible, I'd carry at least $5,000 of med pay - to cover that deductible.     You should discuss this with your agent, to get state - and case - specific information.|`|daf31a0f11d6dd2ff61a771f182635ddaa	It is for medical bills of anyone injured as result of you having an accident.|`|8e538b9bb8f84abf92c4ce7f0c5b2240aa	Finding ways to save on your auto insurance is a good thing. Too many companies are charging too much for the coverage they provide (and most of the time it is the "discount" insureres).    With that being said, this is not where you want to cut your coverage.  This coverage is cheap but VERY important to be able to pay the medical bills of others for the damage you caused.
bru2xnlRaa	Any work you do and earn money is a JOB.   Your options are limited. Most businesses want you to be 16 to hire you for gainful employment.     Time to be inventive,   My suggestions to you:    Make up fliers and pass them around in your neighborhood.   Offer to do whatever work it is you want to do, such as :    Computer work, Babysit, Clean Garages, Organize Cupboards, File Papers, Wash Cars, Mow Lawns, Pull Weeds, Tutor the neighbors kids, wash Dogs, Dog sit, Clean the Pool, Assist the elderly, whatever...       Post first whatever it is you want to do or are good at ...  However, You should keep your options open and make a decision after the persons call you instead of not giving them many reasons to call.     Say you are a student and available to work on weekends|`|vV0v3TcEaa	http://www.dietzel.com/partner/idevaffil...|`|603B45B2aa	I don't know about NZ but in the US you have to be 15 or 16 to work almost all jobs. You have very few options available to you, but you might be able to mow lawns, or there might be neighbors or family friends that would hire you to clean, garden, etc.    FYI for the answer above me regarding some website, you have to be 18 for pretty much all sites like that, including that one, so that is a BAD idea.|`|Y7dgRyJAaa	Lemonade stand!
w4OGnyn8aa	Turn the stuff off when he leaves. After he comes home to total darkness a couple of times he might get the hint. Remind him that rent is due the day that it's due or he will be gone 30 days after and then in court to collect unpaid rent. You can't really increase the rent with a verbal agreement right off the bat. I believe you have to give him 30 days notice to do so. As for the music, ask him to please turn it down. If he was a good tenant I would leave it alone, but this guy sounds like a dick, so I would go ahead and start the eviction process.|`|RZzMse3Haa	Having power included does NOT give you any right to regulate how much is used.      You legally can raise the rent but you MUST legally give him 30 days notice.  You cannot just tell him it is higher for Feb, that is illegal.  He could fight you in court over that.    Making an issue out of the loud music for that short of time is just being a petty jerk.  It is NOT that big of a deal.    If you hate him that much and just want him out, then give him 30 days notice.  You have a month to month agreement with him, so you do not have to have a reason.|`|AA11993638	Is this a room mate or is he renting an apartment?  If he is a room mate, turn the lights and such off when he leaves or you return. The music is not really all that late under normal conditions. If there is no contract, then you will have a difficult time evicting him, your best bet is to increase the rent, or consider making him sign a tenant agreement. Why would you rent a place with everything included?|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	Can you say EVICTION? even though he isn't on a lease, you still have a right to tell him to vacant the premises. If he asks why, failure to pay rent in a timely manner, loud music disrupting neighbors etc. Give him 30 days to leave. If in that time he doesn't leave, begin eviction process on him. Also be sure to charge late fees for every day he is late. Say $25.oo per day after the 3rd of the month.|`|AA11966821	In the absence of a written lease agreement, he is on a month-to-month tenancy.  Therefore, you must give him a written 30-day notice before the first of the month to vacate by the last day of the month.  You need not give a reason, just that you want to terminate tenancy.  He has to leave or you commence eviction proceedings.  Give him notice this wekend to be out by February 28th.    Get another tenant since this clearly is not working for you.  Write a proper lease agreement in proper legal form for your state.  And write up proper rules for tenants!|`|77700ae60cac2abd41d7a7f8bd98336aaa	If he isn't paying rent now, raising it isn't going to make him pay on time. You need to cut your losses and evict now.

Z3YL5UY1aa	Congratulations for trying to start up your own business.    You will want to check with your State Department of Revenue and the IRS.  You can do this online.  For NC the state would be http://www.dor.state.nc.us and for the federal (IRS) it would be http://www.irs.gov.    They will both have a business section you will want to read about to determine what types of forms will need to be filled out.  You will probably want a tax ID to use.    To register the name of your business in your county, you must contact the county register of deeds office.    To make sure if you need to get a license to operate your business or not you should contact your Secretary of State at http://www.secretary.state.nc.us and phone number 919-807-7556.     To get information about sale tax you need to collect, reach Taxpayer Information at 336-334-5656.

ZeDjn4cVaa	Job search expenses in your present occupation are deductible on Schedule A as miscellaneous deductions subject to the 2% limit.    If an overnight stay away from your tax home is required, then it would be reasonable to include either actual cost of meals or a per diem for the location where the job search took place.  If you choose the per diem you do not need to keep receipts for your meals. The per diem will be considered all meals and needs to be entered as such.  Remember that only 50% of the cost of meals is deductible, so if you don't use a software program that divides the meals' cost in half, then do it yourself.  Keep good records of whom you met with, which company they work for, what job it was in relation, and dates of travel. Receipts are required for travel (airplane, train, bus)|`|AA11966821	Job hunting expenses are not tax deductible.

dC6A5R5Saa	We are at the bottom and your observation is absolutely correct.  Ive been watching the Dows behavior in real time and on daily, weekly and monthly charts..  Its more likely to go up on Monday (2/2/2009).  Theres no negative US macroeconomic data on Monday and there are a lot of bullish flag patterns on daily charts of S&P500 Stocks.    Somewhere between 9/11/2001 and the beginning of the sub-prime crisis during August 2007, I went to the state library to study the October 1929 New York Times on microfilm and more recent newspapers during October 1987.      What I discovered is after October 2008 when the market crashed, many people are in the same state of mind they were in after the 87 crash.  They fear and visualize a downtrend similar to that of the early 1930s, when they should really be buying.    During rare years in history when markets crash people are irrational.  In all the panic people sell anything and everything.  In 2008, not only did people sell banks and automaker shares, but also companies like Coca Cola and IBM got mixed up in the selling frenzy.  Already IBM is on an up trend and we will soon find out what Coke (KO) does on February 12 when Coca Cola announces its results to the market: http://www.thecoca-colacompany.com/press...    I noticed on the Bloomberg website after the market dived last year that Warren Buffet came along and bought General Electric and Goldman Sachs shares.     General Electric (GE) is an interesting stock.  I wouldnt buy GE now while its down trending, but its definitely worth putting on the watch list.  I can understand why Warren bought it.  He saw late last year what Im noticing now.  GE is heavily undervalued.  Last time I checked, its P/E ratio was 6.96 and its dividend yield was almost 10%.     The reason why the market is going more sideways than down is negative macro economic data is putting downward pressure on the market and opportunist investors buying undervalued stocks is putting upward pressure on the market.  This is causing the DJIA to stall around 8000.    As for unemployment, theres a lot of companies that profited in 2008 that are using this recession as smoke screen to cut staff and be more efficient, rather than those avoiding bankruptcy. Theyre doing this now to avoid union strikes, poor reputation etc. when the economy picks up.  This is absolutely exaggerating monthly unemployment figures.  Have a look at this article to see what mean:    http://www.reuters.com/article/managemen...    Theyre all racing to cut jobs before Obamas job creating stimulus plan passes through the US senate, and the media are swooping in on the action while they can.  The rate of increasing monthly unemployment isnt sustainable and neither is the recession.|`|VZPvTKZOaa	We are nowhere near rock bottom. 2009 can be the start of the beginning of this catastrophe. As long as unemployment rises, the stockmarket will continue to decline. Just a few days ago 70,000 jobs were lost, that is unheard of. There is still no solution to the housing market. As long as these key measure is still a headache, the economy and stock market will continue to deteriorate.|`|ow56lumPaa	Some think it will dip to 7,000 later this year.

But, later this year, if the economy doesn't pick up, definitely a chance to slide to 7,000.|`|ymqWa8GNaa	I think there is no way to know.  I am not comfortable telling anyone that we have reached the bottom. You could see it go lower, or stay in the 8000 - 9000 DOW range we've been bounded by.  I trade stocks every day for a living and am not "all in" for that reason.      My personal belief is that once you see bank deposit rates back up in the 5% range, then you'll know it's safe to be fully invested.  Until that time, a trading philosophy is more practical for me, and with the present volatility, very profitable.    When 'experts' tell you this recession is just like all the others, don't you believe it. We have nothing to assure us that it is "just like" - but plenty to tell us this is going to be prolonged and global.

How much? depends on how complex your return is. They charge extra in January and February. (I know, it's not right, IMO)    How much for a RAL? Too much, wait the extra 10 days or so.    Can you go to any office? Yes, but if you go out of state, it might cause problems with the preparers that are unfamiliar, or having to pick up a paper return    Disclosure: I do not work for H&R Block. There are several people responding to these questions that do, they might have a better (or more diplomatic) answer.
vUiUoamVaa	I really don't quite understand the question.      If you received too much on a State refund = more than you expected = there was a reason for that, and that is usually because you made an error on the return and they corrected it.      If you made no income in 2008, then that is correct you do not have to file.      However, be advised that if the State realizes it gave you too large a refund in 2007, it will demand part of it back, and if the reason for the rather large refund was due to the figures you gave them and they show that these figures were false or misleading...tax fraud...which means interest and penalties, at the least.      I believe they have five years to question a return.  It sounds sort of unlikely that they will question it if they have not done so by now, but one never knows.

OacSIfSiaa	A credit union is an organization that takes deposits and makes loans. Credit unions are non-profit and run as a co-operative by the depositors of the union.    A Bank is a financial institution chartered by a state or federal agency that accepts demand deposits and offers commercial loans. Other types of financial services usually are provided as well.    Hope this helps answer your question|`|Kwywmcs8aa	There is basically no difference except who insures the money.  FDIC for banks NCUA for credit unions.

It isn't set up to make a profit like banks are. They offer checking that pay interest. Loan and credit card rates are lower because of this. For example my credit union's interest rate on credit cards is 7.9% apr. Because I have been with them a long time my rate is 5.9% on my credit cards.  Their current interest rate on 30 year mortgage with no points is 5.0%.  36 month auto loan is 3.5%. 60 month auto loan is 5%.  It pays 4% on savings with a 50.00 per mo deposit into the account.  Try to find those rates at any bank.|`|eGXLCP4waa	Credit Unions are non profit and are member owned.  All members have a share in the credit union.

DAMZKbpDaa	Big question: did you make more that $3500 for the year?    If you did, print out the return you prepared from Turbo Tax and MAIL it in. You will not be allowed to efile your return (this is a computer thing) but you are eligible for your personal exemption (if, as you say, you are 20, not a student, and made more than $3500, implied from your statement that it made a difference in your tax).

Since you took care of yourself for more than 7 mths and made $22,000 for the year. Because your mother claimed you she should have been asked if you made any income. If you made over your personal exemption of $3400 then you couldnt be claimed because you are no longer a student and you paid her rent when you moved back in. But seeing how she did:    You have two options.      Your mom can file an amendment and remove you as a dependant, leaving her to pay back to the irs the the difference in her refund for losing your dependency.      If it doesnt change her refund for taking you off of her return then file your amendment and claim your dependency.  She will also need to file an amendment if you do this.    Filing an amendment will not bring down an audit on your mother.  The IRS will make the proper corrections based on the information provided. IF they need more information from you they will send a REQUEST.  It is nothing to worry about.|`|1P3usILUaa	This is a conversation with your Mother.

Here I have three tips you need to know when starting an online business.    Understanding Your Market    You have to think like the customer to succeed. When people type something into a search engine, they are expecting to find the answer to there problem. Guess what, your product should provide the solution. If you understand how and where your customers search for answers on the internet youll be ahead of the competition.

Use youtube and blogging to promote other peoples products and you get a commission out of it. GDI or global domains international is a big one at the moment. They sell a package for 10 dollars a month that give you a website ending in .ws instead of .com . For this if you promote their product, the 10 dollars a month hosting they will pay you 1 dollar a month for that person and a dollar a month off every single person you reffer that goes down 5 levels from your first recruit. Its a great side job to earn a little bit of extra dollars in the bad times the worlds finances are in at the moment.      If you want to have a look at GDI i made a short video about them and what they do here -> http://au.youtube.com/watch?v=Qi8RImCOne...

I was like you when I was 16... haha good to find someone who has the same thinking as I was 16. It's not easy to put up a company    you must have the CAPITAL.  the number capital in putting up your own company is your HEART.  You may not get what you want as fast as you wish for it. But a strong heart will keep the desire to make you move and work for what you dreamed for! With a heart to succeed, you can surpass all the trials that may came in your quest to put up your own company and be at the top someday.    Number 2 element in making your dreams come true is you have to invest some "money" i say "some" you don't have to be rich to be richer. You must have a capital where you can start trying for you luck.  I want to help you, because we have the same dreams of putting up a company someday.      i've answered the same questions several times this day, perhaps I should just copy my previous answer to the asker several minutes ago.    I should say that the internet is the most powerful market yet. Billions and billions of people use the internet everyday. Therefor, all of those are potential customers. The potentiality of getting customers online is thousand times of the likelihood in getting customers in the traditional businesses.    There are variety of ways to earn online, you want me to introduce them to you. I had been on the online business for almost 2 years now, so I can say what works and what doesn't.    Here are the most popular and legal businesses I know.    1. adsense- google is gonna pay you everytime ads are clicked in your website. ($0.10- $0.5) each click. (just imagine how many people are using the internet and can click your ads) Average people earn about $600-$1000 as an estimate.    2. click bank- you choose a product on lists, there are thousands of products to sell, companies pay commissions to retailers who were able to sell their product using the link located on your website. 10-25% commissions. Average people can earn $1000-$2000 monthly.    3. HD publishings and reunion- These 2 companies pay their referers $30 each time a person conducts are research of their people search page. Whenever one gets an info and avail it from their site (which will be you site after franchising from them) you'll be honored to get the commissions. (have you ever been to a website where you can search people on the web? like their age, name, location, relatives, email address etc.) that's it. It's a big business!    4. Tissa - he owns the company called "acme-people search" He pays $30 for each referal an affiliate makes. The commissions start from $5 each for the first 30 days, if you referal stays more than 45 days, you get paid $10 additional and if they stayed more than 65  days, you get anouther $15. ( i get 20-30 people weekly)    5. GDI - they offer website hosting and domains. You can franchise their website and use it as a website of you own. You get $1 for each person you refer to get a website, and not only that, if you get like 10 people in a week, you get $200 bonus aside from the $10 commissions, say if those 10 people got 10 people each, you get a pretty $100 monthly income. If those 100 people get 10 each, you get an beautiful $1,000 monthly. If those 1000 get 1 each you get a gorgeous $10,000 monthly.    Most people earn from Gdi, $3000- $6000 monthly.  I am one of them.    i want to help you.  investment is here TIME  (2-4 hours a day), and very little money.  Just 10 usd for your website  30 usd for advertisements and you are set!
OacSIfSiaa	The time runs from the date of the delinquency, plus 180 days. If a payment was due on an account on January 1, 2000, but the debtor defaulted, and never caught up to become current again, and the account is eventually declared a charge-off by the creditor, then the seven year reporting time limit starts running on July 1, 2000, with the item scheduled to expire from his/her credit reports on July 1, 2007.    Hope this helps answer your question.
56e0c9100938aa4d8b2095f98f69a5e2aa	I heard that as long as the state processes the refund before Jan. 27th, you should be ok. Beyond that and you'll have to wait for 30 days to find out what happens.

But what do I know, I'm just the 800lb gorilla in the room.|`|ZeDjn4cVaa	When you and your father buy a home together, the home qualifies for a potential credit of 10% of the purchase price but not more than $7,500.  The credit must be allocated between you and your father in a reasonable way.  Allocating on the basis of ownership share (50/50), cash contribution to down payment, etc would all be reasonable methods.    Let's say you choose the down payment method and your father put up 40% and you put up 60% and the price of the home was $100,000.   The potential credit is $7,500 and your father could get $3,000 (40%) and you could get $4,500.  Your father is not a first time home buyer so he would not get the $3,000 credit allocated to him.  You are a first time home buyer so you would get the $4,500 allocated to you.

EzrdyxAiaa	after tax!!!
Pjm9pg7iaa	I went to the bank to see if a 14 year old could have her own account. It used to be legal. They said no. The only account the minor could open was with the parent. So the parent would have access to the money. The one good thing was that the teenager could get a debit card that linked to the account. The teen could be the only one who had the debit card; not the parent (if that was the agreement between you and your parents); so you could buy stuff on the internet and in stores and gas stations with that card.   You would not legally have to tell them the PIN, but the parents could change the PIN by going to the bank and providing their ID. So you are not protected in that way.  I think this is all part of the 2001 Homeland Security laws that tightened up the banking system.

OacSIfSiaa	Closing any credit card simply reduces the amount of your total available credit and you loose the accounts history.    IF there are no fees, just let them stay open.  If they want to close them for lack of use (which is becoming popular lately) then let them close it.  You report will simply show "paid as agreed/account in good standing" and "closed by grantor".    Either way as long as you keep your total balances owed under 30% of total available credit you will be OK. score wise.    As to paying the balance in full every month well once again that does not make ones credit report look that great as the creditor only reports that payment was made on time and your current balance.    To quote FICO "Even if you pay off your credit cards in full every month, your credit report may show a balance on those cards. The total balance on your last statement is generally the amount that will show in your credit report.    Hope this helps answer your question.|`|x8qomwGwaa	Close the recent one.  It will show on the report it was closed by you.  However, keep the one from 3 yrs. ago so you still have lengthy credit history...unless of course your car and home go back farther.      In this day and age, it's actually good to have at least one CC for travel arrangements.  Hotels, rental cars, etc...require a credit card.  If you are afraid of getting into trouble with it, call the CC company and have them lower your limit to something you're comfortable with.|`|5Af6j1qsaa	Why do you want to close them?  You can't close them without affecting your credit score; after all, your credit score takes into account the number of credit accounts you have and how long they've been open.  What you're asking is like pulling a cheerleader from the bottom of a pyramid and wanting the pyramid to stay up.    If you're not going to be using your credit for anything in the near future (like 1 or 2 years), and you really want to close the accounts, go ahead.  By the time you need your credit again, it'll recoup itself.    By the way, not using your credit cards won't help your credit score.  You need to use it so you can pay it off.  That way, the creditors can report you as paying on time.  On my credit report, I can see which months I didn't use my credit cards because there is no data for those months.  I usually use my card to buy lunch, and then I pay it off in full at the end of the month so I won't pay interest.  Another bonus to using my cards is that I get reward points, and I can use my statements to itemize my expenditures.
bru2xnlRaa	Any work you do and earn money is a JOB.   Your options are limited. Most businesses want you to be 16 to hire you for gainful employment.

The bad news is: some employers will view the limited hours you can work as a disadvantage of hiring younger workers...    But, some employers will see your youthful energy and willingness to learn as a PLUS - so, don't get discouraged.    Check out opportunities at movie theaters, bowling alleys, skating rinks, ice cream shops, etc.    Also, ask around in your family... you may even have a distant relative who owns a small business and is willing to bring you on.|`|T14hLcE1aa	I work for my dad in the summers.

RhEhzGbraa	You can file an appeal with the state insurance commissioner.  You will need to provide evidence showing that you are now rehabilitated, that you are not likely to re-offend, etc.  This will not necessarily be a cake walk but it is very possible that you can get your license.  I would suggest that you start getting reference/recommendation letters from the people who helped you overcome the situation, i.e. therapist, attorney, parole officer, etc.  Also reference letters from teachers and or anyone you have helped such as neighbors--anyone who can attest to the fact that you realized the seriousness of your mistake and have made amends.    Once you obtain the license, you will have to wage the same campaign, i.e. use the same evidence/materials, to convince an insurance company to appoint you.    While this is not an easy process, if you are serious it is totally doable.  Yes the mistake you made through your prior experience will always be coming back to haunt you at the most inopportune times but you can overcome it and hopefully will be more compassionate towards others by having had this experience.  Do not give up!    By the way, I know that you can overcome it because one of my employees had a felony conviction for something he did years before he came to work with me and I not only helped him get his license but he is also appointed with all the companies we represent and we do have quite a few and the charge was a lot more serious than a DUI!

And by some strange miracle, if the insurance commissioner SHOULD make an exception for you, no company will APPOINT you.  And you can't get E&O insurance, with that felony.     Sorry.

viGqMW1Xaa	IRS Offers Tips to Avoid Recovery Rebate Credit Confusion  "Some individuals who did not get the economic stimulus payment, and a smaller number of those who did, may be eligible for the recovery rebate credit."      (EMAILWIRE.COM, January 30, 2009 ) WASHINGTON  In response to errors showing up on early tax filings, the Internal Revenue Service today urged taxpayers and tax preparers to make sure they properly determine eligibility for the recovery rebate credit before they file their 2008 federal tax returns.    Some individuals who did not get the economic stimulus payment, and a smaller number of those who did, may be eligible for the recovery rebate credit. However, most taxpayers who received the economic stimulus payment last year will not qualify for the recovery rebate credit on their 2008 federal income tax return.    An early sampling of tax returns shows about 15 percent have errors involving the recovery rebate credit. Some tax returns erroneously claim the credit, do not claim the proper amount of recovery rebate credit or mistakenly enter the amount of the stimulus payment they received on the recovery rebate credit line.    To avoid delays in tax refunds, it is critical that taxpayers know the correct amount of the stimulus payment they received last year, if any, to help determine whether they qualify for the recovery rebate credit now.    The amount of the stimulus payment will not be entered directly on the tax return. For people using a paper tax return, the stimulus payment amount will be required when completing a related worksheet. For people using tax software, the stimulus payment amount will be needed as part of the return preparation process.    How to Get the Recovery Rebate Credit Right    The IRS sent taxpayers nearly 119 million stimulus payments last year. There are three ways individuals can find out how much they received:    Check the amount listed on Notice 1378, which the IRS mailed last year to individuals who received the economic stimulus payment.  Go to the How Much Was My Stimulus Payment? tool that is available on the IRS Web site, IRS.gov. This can provide the correct amount in a matter of a few seconds.  Individuals can call the IRS at 1-866-234-2942. After a brief recorded announcement they can select option one to find out the amount of their economic stimulus payment. They will need to provide their filing status, Social Security Number and number of exemptions.  With the amount of last years economic stimulus payment in hand, the taxpayer can then enter the figure on the recovery rebate credit worksheet or in the appropriate location when tax preparation software requests it.    If the taxpayer or preparer is using tax software, the amount of the rebate recovery credit will automatically be calculated and reported properly. If the taxpayer is using the paper method, the rebate recovery credit, as determined through the worksheet, should be reported on Line 70 of Form 1040, Line 42 of Form 1040A or Line 9 of Form 1040EZ.    For most taxpayers, the correct entry for the recovery rebate credit will either be blank or zero.    If there is any question at all as to the amount that should be reported for the recovery rebate credit, the taxpayer or preparer should enter a zero on the appropriate line above, and the IRS will determine whether a recovery rebate credit is due, and, if so, how much.    Some of the major factors that could qualify you for the recovery rebate credit include:    Your financial situation changed dramatically from 2007 to 2008.  You did not file a 2007 tax return.  Your family gained an additional qualifying child in 2008.  You were claimed as a dependent on someone elses return in 2007 but cannot be claimed as dependent by someone else in 2008.  Stimulus Payments Not Taxable; Reports of Extensive Refund Delays False    The IRS has received a number of recurring questions involving stimulus payments and the recovery rebate credit. Here are some important tips to keep in mind:    Taxability. The economic stimulus payment is not taxable and it should not be reported as income on the 2008 Form 1040, 1040A or 1040EZ.    Refund delays. IRS personnel are aware of reports that errors in claiming the recovery rebate credit could delay tax refunds for as much as eight to 12 weeks. These reports are false. As the IRS detects and corrects return errors concerning the recovery rebate credit, refund delays are currently no longer than about one week.    One payment. In addition, the IRS notes taxpayers will receive a single refund that includes any recovery rebate credit to which they are entitled. The IRS will not be issuing separate recovery rebate credit payments.    Refund amounts. The IRS reminds taxpayers they should not use their regular refund from last year in calculating the recovery rebate credit. Some taxpayers may be confusing their regular tax refunds with the economic stimulus payment they received when completing their 2008 tax retu|`|znr8SBiWaa	I should have gotten mine today, but didn't, and was really counting on it.    No, I did not have anything on the recovery rebate line.  Nothing at all.  So that was not the error.    As of Monday 1/26, Where's My Refund? was telling me that I should expect my refund by 2/3, which is a Tuesday.  They say this to add a buffer because some banks will hold a direct deposit received on Friday for a few days.  I've never had this happen in the years that I've been efiling, when it's scheduled for direct deposit, that's when it goes in my account.    On Tuesday, 1/27, the Where's My Refund? began alternating between telling me to expect my return by 2/10, or not being able to determine at all that I had a return.  It's still doing that.    Thursday, I called the IRS, sat on hold for an hour and a half, and was finally told (after having to confirm previous address, filing status, AGI, etc. for 2007) that my return was received, is being processed, and that it was delayed because of an error that was confirmed and corrected by the IRS, and that I would have it by 2/10, as stated on the website.    I think the IRS is full of **** this year, and stringing people along with useless answers because they screwed up.  They were not ready for efiling by the 1/16 date, though they should have been, and they were not counting on so many people filing so early, though, again, they should have been, considering the state of the economy and how desperately people need their refunds this year.    I too qualified for the first time homebuyer credit, so I don't know if that was what caused the delay or not.    But no, you aren't the only one getting dicked around with direct deposit by the IRS.|`|dda9b45340cb38441ce4ab6fdfed3179aa	i and some friends also were expecting our refunds to be direct deposited today and were very disappointed to find out that we had been pushed back a week and will not see anything until next friday (if we are lucky). the big problem is with the rebates. we did our taxes on TaxAct and did not realize we had to keep going back and adjusting the rebate amount every time we entered a dependent, etc. so, the IRS had to fix our returns due to this and now we have to sit and wait. it would have been nice if the IRS had sent out some sort of rebate reminder for tax filing or if TaxAct had listed that we had to manually adjust the rebate credit before e-filing.|`|a5b6eaf1e6e065c5886203f517c6f330aa	this about my 100th reply to one of these posts. I TOO HAVE NOT RECIEVED my refund. Just like many others i had date for the 30th , then for the 3rd then now the 10th. WMR site is still telling me the 10th after checking it a trillion times since the beginning of this week. No pending deposits or anything. I just dont get it, might as well have filed later then maybe  i could have recieved it already. the irs is pushing everyone to efile but yet their system seems like it cant handle any of it.|`|BiOalkPGaa	Just like many others i had date for the 30th , checked today and now it says the 10th, which of course, is a Tuesday.

It also stating what yours says on Feb 10th I should receive refund.|`|PD0XcLyEaa	I have used TaxAct for 4 years, and have not had any problems until this year.  As with everyone else, TaxAct said my refund would be deposited on the 30th.  I checked irs.gov and they said Feb. 3, then a few days later, it said Feb 10.  I did change the amount of the Stimulus Payment in TaxAct, because the automatic amount was wrong.  I re-entered all my tax information to double check that there weren't any errors, and as far as I can tell, there are not.      As far as the IRS stating the 10th, it is a Tuesday, but so was the original date they gave me of the 3rd.  I have noticed in the past, that the IRS cushions the refund date by a few days.  I know this helps no one, because we all want/need our money now.  Just expressing my frustration along with all of you!|`|UwrVK72aaa	I went through turbotax.com. Have gone through them for years and never had a problem. I filed on 1/16.  And had a date of Jan. 30th on the wheres my refund website. Infact it still says Jan. 30th (I am confused that mine did not change)  But no funds yet. We finally called the IRS and they said that we had been delayed until Feb. 9th which is a monday. So who knows. They would not give us a reason why.  We ended up having to take out a payday loan because we had bills that had to be paid that day. I might as well have gone to H&R block and paid all that money to get my tax refund that day for the amount of fees I am paying now anyway.  I have no trust in the system now. I don't even trust that we are getting our money this next week.   Speaking of tuesday deposits though. A few of my husbands co-workers had their deposit come in on Tuesday Jan. 27th. So maybe they will do deposits on this coming Tues. for those of us who got pushed off.    BTW-I did have a recovery rebate. But when we called the IRS they said there was nothing wrong with our tax return, but would not give us a reason otherwise that we had been pushed to the next week.
TYzNTT7caa	It depends, as you say, on what state you live in and what its rates are--and, more importantly, how much has already been deducted from your earnings for this purpose. Some companies or firms take out enough in state taxes to cover; some don't. You can control this, usually, through the payroll office where you work. It is not by any means a sure thing that because you receive a refund from federal taxes that you will therefore also receive a refund from the state.|`|DAMZKbpDaa	Some states are easy to figure. Illinois, for example, 41000 - 2000 = 39000 * .03 = about 1200 tax. You would get about a 200 refund.    In Wisconsin nearby, you would owe quite a bit, and there would be no way to figure it in your head.    I'm not saying you live in Illinois or Wisconsin, I'm just trying to say that there is no way anyone can give an accurate answer to your question without knowing what state you are living in.    Edit:  Just a quick inspection of the form, it looks like you will get about a $40 refund. (1400-1360)
4c8ab139bf95dbc97c7afe8fa56e034daa	Go to salary.com and payscale.com  They have some salary information.  It's not so much the degree, it's the industry.  Pharmaceuticals and Finance have traditionally paid much higher, than say, Agricultural companies.     It's also important what school you go to.  Getting a MBA can be very lucrative, but it does involve considerable expense.
AA10671142	I agree with you. I heard about this from my neighbor. the electric company should get sued. many times older people forget to send out the bill. I am younger than that man and I may forget to mail out something also. they could of called him or have someone from the company go to his house before they shut the electric off. I only hope his family sues that company, but that will not bring that poor man back. my neighbor also told me that the man had the check all made out with the bill to be mailed out. companies are only out for money not the customer.|`|e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	No.  His children are, because they should be making sure that dad has heat.
K4H70kYZaa	You don't say if the 2 jobs are with the same employer or with different employers.  I'm going to assume they're with 2 different employers because if it was one employer, he would have to pay you OT after 40 hours and most employers are not going to allow that kind of OT being paid out every week.   So since I'm assuming you've got 2 jobs with 2 different employers, then no, there's no OT unless you work more than 40 hours with one of the employers (that employer would pay you the OT).   You can legally have as many jobs as you can handle and fit into your schedule, and you won't get any OT from any of them even if you're working 100 hours a week but not more than 40 at any one of them.|`|77700ae60cac2abd41d7a7f8bd98336aaa	If you are in the US you can work as many jobs and hours as you want or can get|`|63e413147f262ec68d5946ef36ffb354aa	Overtime only applies for the hours you work on one job unless you are union and work in a job shop.  If you work 39 hours on one job and 41 hours on another you will get just the one hour overtime. If you worked for a plumber, as an example, and are sent out to do a number of jobs for that one plumber, you would get overtime for all hours over the 40 hours no matter how many jobs you were sent on.

4VsUKjQGaa	Yes, the acknowledgment just means the IRS has received your return, and there weren't any glaring errors--like incorrect social security number, or two people claiming the same child.  There are several reasons that the refund can be delayed for up to a week or two.  One that I've seen is claiming earned income credit with zero withholding on your W-2.  I've read that this year, if the rebate recovery credit (additional stimulus payment) that you claim is different from the one that the IRS had figured you would claim, a living person needs to look at the return to see who is correct.  And that can take up to a week.  I'm sure there are others.      If they can't resolve the issue within a few weeks, they'll let you know.|`|EPc8Wvkpaa	Yes, when they say they accepted it, it just means they have received it.

To avoid delays in tax refunds, it is critical that taxpayers know the correct amount of the stimulus payment they received last year, if any, to help determine whether they qualify for the recovery rebate credit now.    The amount of the stimulus payment will not be entered directly on the tax return. For people using a paper tax return, the stimulus payment amount will be required when completing a related worksheet. For people using tax software, the stimulus payment amount will be needed as part of the return preparation process.    How to Get the Recovery Rebate Credit Right    The IRS sent taxpayers nearly 119 million stimulus payments last year. There are three ways individuals can find out how much they received:    Check the amount listed on Notice 1378, which the IRS mailed last year to individuals who received the economic stimulus payment.  Go to the How Much Was My Stimulus Payment? tool that is available on the IRS Web site, IRS.gov. This can provide the correct amount in a matter of a few seconds.  Individuals can call the IRS at 1-866-234-2942. After a brief recorded announcement they can select option one to find out the amount of their economic stimulus payment. They will need to provide their filing status, Social Security Number and number of exemptions.  With the amount of last years economic stimulus payment in hand, the taxpayer can then enter the figure on the recovery rebate credit worksheet or in the appropriate location when tax preparation software requests it.    If the taxpayer or preparer is using tax software, the amount of the rebate recovery credit will automatically be calculated and reported properly. If the taxpayer is using the paper method, the rebate recovery credit, as determined through the worksheet, should be reported on Line 70 of Form 1040, Line 42 of Form 1040A or Line 9 of Form 1040EZ.    For most taxpayers, the correct entry for the recovery rebate credit will either be blank or zero.    If there is any question at all as to the amount that should be reported for the recovery rebate credit, the taxpayer or preparer should enter a zero on the appropriate line above, and the IRS will determine whether a recovery rebate credit is due, and, if so, how much.    Some of the major factors that could qualify you for the recovery rebate credit include:    Your financial situation changed dramatically from 2007 to 2008.  You did not file a 2007 tax return.  Your family gained an additional qualifying child in 2008.  You were claimed as a dependent on someone elses return in 2007 but cannot be claimed as dependent by someone else in 2008.  Stimulus Payments Not Taxable; Reports of Extensive Refund Delays False    The IRS has received a number of recurring questions involving stimulus payments and the recovery rebate credit. Here are some important tips to keep in mind:    Taxability. The economic stimulus payment is not taxable and it should not be reported as income on the 2008 Form 1040, 1040A or 1040EZ.    Refund delays. IRS personnel are aware of reports that errors in claiming the recovery rebate credit could delay tax refunds for as much as eight to 12 weeks. These reports are false. As the IRS detects and corrects return errors concerning the recovery rebate credit, refund delays are currently no longer than about one week.    One payment. In addition, the IRS notes taxpayers will receive a single refund that includes any recovery rebate credit to which they are entitled. The IRS will not be issuing separate recovery rebate credit payments.    Refund amounts. The IRS reminds taxpayers they should not use their regular refund from last year in calculating the recovery rebate credit. Some taxpayers may be confusing their regular tax refunds with the economic stimulus payment they received when completing their 2008 tax return.

This is mostly to keep felons from moving in after their spouses are approved, but the law applies to everyone.    Your wife can not force the landlord to let her live there.

I don't think I agree that if the manager does not exercise their authority they are more likely to engage in unethical behaviors, but I have not done any research to back my idea. There are  solutions to the dilemma of micromanaging: weekly manager meetings that include solutions to any problems that may be occurring, review of hand books and policies, people need to be reminded no matter their position within the company.

ClqGz7Veaa	Greetings! I have worked for New York Life for a short time now. I love the company and the people that I work with. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a position with a Financial Advising/Insurance Agent company. To answer some of your questions... there is no starting salary. Everything is commission based. For the first few months I was working there I had to go take classes and take the state exam for my insurance license. You do need to be able to pay for that yourself. The company will reimburse you once you become a contracted and have 'triggered to a full time' agent (in order to trigger you must get five policies signed and $5000 commission I believe... not positive if those are the precise numbers but it is around there) All in all, New York Life is a great company; as long as you have the finances to make it a couple months without any income while you are going through certifications and licensing requirements, I would definitely recommend them. Good luck in your decisions you have ahead of you. You can reach me by email at baybefaced@yahoo.com for anything else.

e83c5229e243a4223beeb3c6e55aac65aa	How to Sell on eBay    Selling on eBay is as easy as going through a few steps. It's user friendly and can always be edited. Here's how you can sell on eBay. If there are any questions you can always go to the "Help" section of the site.    Instructions:    Step 1. Sign up. Assuming you haven't yet signed up yet, go to eBay's Main Pageand then click on register at the very top of the page to create an eBay account.   You will also need to sign up for a PayPal account.  Sign up for PayPal first, as it will take a day or so to complete the registration process for PayPal.    Step 2. Build your account. It's a very good idea to buy a few things and pay immediately so that you will get some feedback ratings. (Don't buy things to resell, just buy things you'd buy anyway.) This will give you experience with the site and start to build up your "site cred".     -Search eBay for items like those you want to sell. Read the listings. What sort of information or photos do you find most helpful to you as a potential buyer? What makes you think a seller is trustworthy?     Step 3. Assemble the information you will need to place the listing. Usually this includes measuring the item, weighing the item so you can estimate shipping costs, and having your photos ready.     Step 4. Log in and go to Sell either in My eBay or on the Main Page at the top.     Step 5. Enter the title and description, after choosing a category. Be very detailed about your product, and include as many pictures as possible.  The more pictures, the better your item will sell.  Not including one will deter a lot of buyers from your item.     Step 6. Continue to go through the options, and be sure to look everything over very carefully. There's a lot to look through and you'll want to make sure everything is correct.  Do not waste your money by opting for the "upgrades" for your listing.  In 10 years of selling, I have never upgraded any of my listings and have done great.     Step 7. Double check everything before saving. Be sure that when you're done with everything at the end (you're at the overview page) to double check and press submit. If you don't press submit it won't be entered. You'll then get an e-mail confirming that your product was placed on eBay.     Step 8. Watch the auction. Once the item has been shipped, and they have left feedback for you, you should leave feedback for that person.     *Tips*    -Consider using a photo hosting service to add extra pictures to your listing for free.  If you use the ebay photo hosting service, the first photo is free, each additional picture is .15 cents.  I use Seller's Sourcebook for all of my listings.  I can choose from over 1000 different auction templates, add as many pictures as I want and I can even upload my listings to ebay from the Seller Sourcebook site.   Every one of my listings look very professional and I am proud to show my items using a professionally designed template.  Other photo hosting sites are Inkfrog and Photobucket.  There is a charge for Inkfrog, but Photobucket is free.  -You need to have excellent feedback to sell well on eBay.     -Sell inexpensive items to build up your feedback first.    -As long as you follow the directions and press submit at the end, your product will be viewable to everyone.   It can take up to 12 hours for your item to show up under the general search.    -Always answer a customer's questions promptly. Be clear, direct, and friendly.     -Be sure to choose the correct category and keywords... the easier it is for your customer to find you, the better it will sell!     -You will have to ship the product out on your own, so you're going to have to add shipping into the price; there's a section where you set the shipping.     -You can always go back and edit it if you don't like something. Just go into "My eBay" and go from there.   Once a bid in placed on  your item, you cannot edit any information in your listing.  You can add to the description, you just cannot edit the main body of your description.    -Keep good communication with your customer - they're interested in your product and you want to be ranked as a good seller in the end, so be a good seller!     -Try and have it so your auction ends on a Sunday. Avoid ending auctions on Friday or Saturday when people are not home to bid.     -Avoid using "reserve price" auctions. These auctions are a form of shill bidding where the bidders are bidding against the seller himself. A reserve auction makes some buyers angry because they have no idea what the seller wants. Instead, set the opening bid at the lowest amount of money you would be willing to sell the item for.     -Help keep the feedback system honest by only placing honest feedback and avoiding the "trading" of positive feedback. A seller should leave positive feedback if the buyer pays promptly. A buyer should leave positive feedback if the item arrives in a reasonable time and is as advertised. A seller who waits for a buyer to leave positive feedback is really trading feedback. Such a practice skews feedback ratings.  Also, realize that a seller cannot leave a negative feedback for buyers any more.  So, ensuring that your description in your listing is honest and you ship on time, will help you maintain a positive feedback rating and keep your 30 day DSR stars in good standing.    -People will look at things that have cheap or free shipping, so include the shipping price in the total price (or min bid) and people will be more inclined to buy. If you offer it, make sure they know that you're offering it.     -Packaging is also important. If items are fragile, improper packaging can result in broken items and unhappy customers! Also keep in mind the price you pay for shipping: the box, padding, etc., to decide on a reas|`|eIYcPhuJaa	If you are getting involved with selling on Ebay, take a look at this site.

I agree that you should buy a few things first to see how things work and to see what it feels like to be the buyer. Then I would suggest reading everything you can -- there are some excellent books.

7vK3pXu9aa	Contesting an inaccuracy on your credit report may seem like David fighting Goliath, but the result - a clean and accurate credit history - is worth the battle. Here's how you do it.    Step 1: Request a copy of your credit report from one of the major credit bureau companies or another provider. These are all typically accessible through the Internet.    Step 2: Read the report carefully. Highlight any items you don't recognize or that appear to be incorrect.    Step 3: Call the credit bureau company reporting the information in question. It will provide you with the appropriate credit card company phone numbers.    Step 4: Call the credit card companies and ask them to research the situation. If they made an error, request that they send a written correction to the major credit bureau companies and a copy to you as well.    Step 5:  You can write your side of the story and ask that it be posted on your credit report, if the credit card company is unwilling to correct the reporting on your credit bureau.    Step 6: Request a copy of your credit report annually to keep on top of the situation.    I hope that the above information will be of good use to you.    All the best.............

AA11865529	I'm someone who gave up being a lawyer to become a librarian. Trust me, doing what you love is the important thing, more so than title or money.     Tell them you appreciate their interest in your future, but if you really don't want to be a lawyer, you won't be good at it and you will spend your life unhappy. Ask them if that's what they want.    Law is for very specific kinds of people and if you don't have a passion for it, you will end up unhappy. (The vast majority of lawyers in the US are unhappy and there are depression and alcohol and drug abuse rates.)    There is a demand for hotel management and you could end up in exotic locations and traveling. Ask them what their concerns are about you becoming a hotel manager and see if you can meet those concerns with facts. The links below are helpful.    There is also an overabundance of lawyers in many areas and the  job outlook isn't as good as hotel management.    If it's a matter of prestige and money, remind them that you can work hard and end up at the top of the corporate ladder making lots of money. If that's what you want.

If you are fairly confident in your ability to correctly read the forms, there is nothing wrong with doing it yourself.     I do mine every year, but I use an online tax service, such as hr block.com, although this year I went through turbo tax.com, because after figuring it on both I found turbo tax figured a bigger refund.    Sometimes it is better to have someone do them for you because you might miss a credit you would qualify for.  But if you use an online service, you can choose to answer each and every little question, which is pretty thorough.      If you are self employed, or have some questionable situations that you might need clarification on, or that you may need help figuring out what portion of specific things are deductible (mileage and usage on a car that is both for business and personal, for example) then having a tax agent is a good idea.|`|WuDXQGBgaa	to be quite honest with you,you're better off doing them yourself than going to a so-called pro because their expensive and they really don't know no more than what you know about filing taxes (well most of them don't,not all)but if you have a simple return try doing them yourself on turbotax.com for free and save yourself 150-200 bucks by not going to a so-called pro.if you don't understand how to do it yourself,then get some help from somebody who does understand taxes,but turbotax.com is very easy to use and they helps you through the process also.

Yes, you are sort of supposed to do the worksheet on the form, but that does not go anywhere except to you.  On line 5, just enter "1" and it will be fine or you can enter "0" and that will be fine.  The only difference it makes is the amount of tax being withheld from you pay.  In either case, if you check the withhold at higher single rate, you should certainly have paid in more than enough taxes at the end of '09.|`|AA11757270	If you filled it out as single, then they are going to be holding more of your paycheck for taxes, as single is a higher rate.  The more withholdings you select, the more money you get to keep out of each of your checks.  (ie-if you have 3 kids, and you don't make enough, they won't take taxes out at all, but if you only select 1 dependent, then they are going to take taxes).      Now if your husband isn't having enough taken out of his check, then this is ok.  It really just depends on the amount of money you both make, and if you would end up owing taxes at the end of the year, then you would want more taken out.|`|AA10420446	All that does is lower the amount of tax withholding in your check.

AA11284831	Just file your return.  If you e-file and he's already claimed her your return will reject so you'll have to file a paper return by mail claiming the child.  The IRS will then contact you both and ask for proof of your claim to the exemption.    The custodial parent get the exemption by law so you will need to prove that the child lived with you for more than half of the near.  Medical records, school records, and statements from persons with knowledge of your living situation will normally suffice as proof.    Assuming that you win, the IRS will process your return as filed and he will get a bill for any tax that he owes due to the denial of the exemption claim on his return.  If it's past the filing deadline that will include penalties and interest as well.|`|WJDJ2vIoaa	You may be able to file even if he has already done it.

When you get a card, you are served with the terms and conditions along with the credit card itself saying you are deemed to submit to the terms once you start using it.    It's a great way to go with cards and engage in cashless transactions.. but you should be careful not to lose your limits for repayment.. and never accumulate arrears as the interest rates would be higher than usual bank loans..!|`|b00ba3d721ffac4d935c0a5f7cf8bd76aa	YES.  It may vary from civil to criminal suits, if not paid.  If you cannot pay and if you are in real great trouble, consult an advocate, if you do not have any property, assets, bank deposits, and if the credit card and other liabilities are more, file an insolvency petition.  None of the Banks, Credit Card companies or creditors can do any harm to you.    The official liquidator will dissolve all your liabilities with your existing assets and the problem is solved.  If the loans are more than your assets, you can opt for this procedure.|`|w59m2anKaa	Short answer is yes.  Banks legally have 7 months to collect on a debt.  Every month you fall past due there are penalties (late fees + higher interest rates and of course the reporting to the credit bureau).  After 7 months of insufficient monthly minimum payments the debt gets "charged off," IE the bank has to write your debt off as a loss.  Once it gets written off as a loss it stays on your credit report for 7-10 years as a bad debt (destroying your credit report depending on the balance) and from there the debt either leaves their hand for a third party collection agency who will hassle you for the debt or it goes over to the banks legal team for litigation.  If it goes to litigation they can garnish wages, put liens on houses, etc.|`|1BbnyTfBaa	Can you say, "garnishment?"  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garnishment|`|7vK3pXu9aa	Its always been my understanding that your creditor can take you to civil court and obtain a judgment against you saying that you owe the debt.  Through the judgment the collector can then garnish your wages or even get liens against your assets. But getting to this point of wage garnishment or liens against assets is time consuming and usually never occurs.  Thats because the collector has to go through a process that is very tedious and time consuming.    All the best..........

The police would NEVER get involved unless you took someones money and never sent them their merchandise.    If you bid and don't pay, you're theoretically breaching a contract.  The seller would have to take you to court and sue you (or to small claims court and sue you).  The judge would make the decision whether you have to pay or not and whether or not you owe damages.    Filing a lawsuit involves hiring an attorney.  This is EXPENSIVE and a seller isn't going to that extreme unless you caused him to lose a lot of money due to your careless action.    That said, NOBODY can hack your ebay account. You had to give your "friend" your password or leave it somewhere that he could obtain access to it.    What kind of friend is that?

AA12066778	I don't sell herbalife, but I am a marketing specialist.    Here are a few things to help you on your way:    1 - Believe in your product.  You have to really understand what it is you are trying to sell.    2 - Make connections.  Especially in a MLM/direct sales business, you need to meet as many people as you can... you never know who will turn out to be your best customer.    3 - Be confident.  You don't have to be aggressive in your sales, but you do need to believe in yourself as much as the product.  Despite the old saying "the product sells itself", most sales are made because the customer is buying the person, not the product.    4 - Use your support system.  Most MLM/direct sales organizations have tools to help you sell - business cards, magnets, car wraps, etc.  They are available because they work.  Use them.  Network with your upline/downline.  Host a small party and brainstorm.  You never know what great ideas will come out of it.    If you need more feedback about any specifics, drop me a line and I'll see what I can do.

You need to use the products yourself so you can have a story to tell.      They also stress not to 'sell' the product but to tell it's story.  Your entheuasim for the product and how it has helped you and others around you will show through and will get you sales.

a2a2dec5f3ddc38d1bcc91cfc6123dffaa	One of your other answers suggested a university degree in Journalism, 4 years.  Excellent choice.  ANY university degree is good but you'll obviously learn very important things in Journalism courses you'll use every day in your career.  Many Community Colleges also offer Journalism courses, a possible alternative to university.    You needn't stop at one degree, and you SHOULD NOT limit your courses to Journalism.  Many journalists develop a specialty (politics, business, medicine, sports, environmental issues, etc.) and can significantly enhance their careers by taking related courses, and almost any education can be an advantage.    Journalism is one of the few professions where it is POSSIBLE to succeed with minimal formal education, but degrees and other evidence of education and training will often open opportunities that would otherwise be inaccessible.    You can get an early start in your career, don't wait until after graduation.  Write for your school newspaper or yearbook.  Submit unsolicited articles to community newspapers.  Contact local organizations - charities, community associations, hospitals, businesses - and offer to write short articles about their activities.  Whenever you have spare time:  make lists and notes about story ideas, and outlines and research plans for those ideas, and actually write some stories as samples of your work - a start on your portfolio.|`|AA11942550	I was a journalism major and I did it in four years of college...Good Luck|`|AA11649602	Im pretty sure you need at least a bachelors degree (4 or 5 years it usually takes most people)|`|AA11098414	4 years to get a journalism degree - a degree doesn't make you a journalist.  It will, however, give you an edge and help you to find a path.  Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana has a nice journalism and communications department.  Check it out at www.bsu.edu

AA12066778	Market America is simply another "get-rich-quick" MLM scheme.  Is it bad?  Take a look at the following:  "The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a Complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against Gilbert A. Zwetsch ("Zwetsch"), 59, a former stockbroker from Spokane, Washington, and James H. Ridinger ("Ridinger"), 47, of Greensboro, North Carolina. Ridinger is president and CEO of Market America, Inc. ("Market America"), a North Carolina direct marketing company. The Complaint alleges that the two defendants violated the antifraud and other provisions of the federal securities laws in connection with an unregistered distribution of Market America stock and other activities. "    Gee... is fraud a bad thing?    Hope this helps!

AA11769158	In Illinois and Iowa this is a no-no.... Ohio, being a red-state (yes, I know, Iowa is too, the fools), might be able to do this.  You'll have to check further. Call your state department of employment (you know, the people you would call if you had to apply for unemployment).... They should be able to tell you.... What city in Ohio do you live in? -beaver (Rock Island, Illinois)    Another thing you could do is MOVE HERE! Less people, nicer people, more farmland... More open spaces, good jobs...  you can email me if you are interested.|`|AA10811401	The employer isn't raising your rates.  The insurance company is.  The employer simply passes these costs to you in accordance with the policy they have in effect (likely that they pay so much and the rest is yours).    Yes, this is legal.  As far as opting out, you can drop your health coverage any time you like.  But you need a reality check.  Health insurance is expensive, and costs continue to go up.  These costs will likely continue to climb.      More and more employers are going to a system that requires the employee to cover anything over a fixed amount because the businesses cannot take the unending increase in costs.  You may not like it, but that's how it is.  Life isn't always fair.  You may need to re evaluate your health coverage and swap out for a high deductable plan if you can't afford the one you currently have.  Most people on employer plans choose cadillac plans when they need the much less expensive high deductable plans.  But this also means you have to cover doctor's office visits out of your own pocket, etc.  It's part of the cost of being alive.  Get used to it.  Life isn't fair.|`|AA10055477	i would speak to your HR person about it. or call local dept. of labor
