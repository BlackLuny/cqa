20090307075729AAkTQ4V	Social Science;Psychology	I'm feeling depressed for no reason?	Okay, here's the deal; i'm 14 years old and a freshman in high school. I can say i'm an average joe in sports. I play volleyball (varsity, so i guess not THAT average joe) and lacrosse, which I'm standard level in.      I play the instrument the oboe in my schools band. I'm pretty average at that too, but both of my sisters had been in the higher level band, and i now feel like I am obliged to. I think that if i really try, i could get into that higher level band, but really, i have no desire to. I'm perfectly content with staying in regular level band and play for fun, but the pressure my sisters put on me (not intentionally) makes me feel not so content with it      I am an A+ student, and have been all during my life (I'm not trying to brag, I am just giving you the details). I am in every single honors class possible. I have ranging from 98 to 100 averages in all of my classes...except for social studies. I have an 87 as a social studies average right now, and i cannot get higher than a 90 on any given test. This really is the thing that is depressing me most. I study harder than i have had for any other class in the past, and going to extra help does not help me. I just cannot retain all of the information that we need to know. And i do not have the money to get a personal tutor, and i dont think that would help me much either. I understand the material, i just cant remember it all.      I worry incessantly about getting into college, even though its far off. I've been feeling unaccomplished and depressed lately for no reason at all. I feel like i'm not great in anything--that i'm just okay in a lot of things. Most people have that one thing that theyre really good at, but i cant seem to find it.      Sorry if i went off on a tangent there, i just really want to stop feeling depressed all of the time and just be happy.

Why is it that men are always paying child support but many women don't? I am starting to question everything, the feminism of today is not fair! It's not feminism anymore! The guys on this forum have a valid point, how is it fair that marx lost his little girl?? How is it fair that Cassius is screwed over? We need to think about everyone! Greer ruined the meaning, now it is just seen as a hate group because so many of the leaders are part of a hate group.
20090307081831AA2o9eX	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	What does this dream mean?	I had a dream that we went Vegas on a school trip to watch some show, but before people would get drunk and throw up and I wanted to join them but I couldn't bring myself to get drunk, for some reason! Then the people who got drunk got told off and got kicked out!      What does this dream mean?
20090307081544AAh8pqP	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Dream Interpretation Time! Holocaust dream...?	Well, last night, or this morning, I had a dream that really stuck in my head. Me and three other girls (soldiers, I guess) were representing the US army in a meeting with Hitler, but his soldiers kidnapped us (surprise surprise...), and we were put in Auschwitz. (It didn't look anything like Auschwitz, just a small prison in the middle of the country, which was really rather pretty and mountainous.) One of the four of us, who was now my friend, was able to escape into the woods, but only when I told her to. Then, I was in a room with Hitler but he fell asleep and I got out through a hole in the wall, and walked back along a pipe system. The whole dream had been sunny up to this point where I got into the town. Apparently I was one of the four daughters this family had, and 3 of us had been taken to Auschwitz, and they had one boy and one girl left with them. Since they had thought we were dead for a while, I was wondering whether to go back to them, since they had started over with the two children, but then I decided I should. I also went back to Auschwitz where my younger sister had replaced me in the room with Hitler, and took her out the same hole in the wall. There was something really sad about it because she hadn't realized she could leave for a long, long time (like a couple decades). Somehow, she was red and white and i was purple and white. Our third sister must have died, because we knew it was impossible to get her out. So we went back to our family, and we were getting ready to leave the crowded sort of shanty-town by train. On the way it was really uncomfortable, because everyone was very pro-Hitler or too scared to say anything else. Then the dream sort of transitioned to North Korea being in my house's studio, and I was wondering how it fit. That's pretty much it.      Extra info: I'm 17 years old, and none of my family that I know was ever in the Holocaust. I am, however, 1/4 Jewish from my father's father, but converted to Catholicism when he was young. My family is Catholic too. And since I mentioned this family in my dream, my real family has two boys and two girls.... (and three miscarried girls, which I wasn't intending to bring up but I realized the connection with all the sisters in the dream family). Thanks for taking the time to read this!

20090307080833AAqe2VC	Social Science;Psychology	Mother's intuition is supposed to be the only type? Male with intuition?	I have read this morning about a study on Mother's Intuition in the newspaper. It is said to happen within mothers, with isolated occurrences in other adult females. Males intuition, however, has been defined as putting someone into the dark. However, I am a young, 13-year old male, and I experience visions of events happening to those I know. Only a few weeks ago, I had a dream that we would stop to pick up some food and a guest we were taking home would break my sisters finger playing a game in the car. The next day, the events happened EXACTLY like I dreamed, with not the slightest detail off. I most commonly dream of something that happens the next day in school, not off at all. I've even seen the questions of a TCAP test once in my dreams, only for them to appear in the booklet in front of me. I would like to know if there are any other cases of visions like this amongst the youth population, and if so, are there any studies about it?

20090307083333AAZYS9X	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	The similarity of the male and female birth control debate?	I often read things like 'women can do what they like, they can abort, keep it, etc - men have no say but have to pay either way'.      This really strongly reminds me of pre-birth control arguments - 'a man can have sex and walk away, if a woman gets pregnant, she's stuck with it, she has to raise it' etc.      So it seems to me that calls for men's financial reproductive rights, is actually a call for the same control over their fertility that women currently enjoy.      Would a male pill drastically reduce the anger of some men towards 'oops' pregnancies, being 'trapped' etc?      Or would some men still want the right to 'financially abort' even if it was their own birth control that had failed?  :-)

She kept postponing the work and delaying and i had to do everything on my own because i wasnt like her. I do everything on time and i am very responsible. All she did was the printing which anyone can do. Even that when i call her and tell her to print something she would say things like oh its too late now and that i should have told her earlier (when there is like an hour left for her to print one page).         Anyway, i did everything and it was now time for the lecturer to asess us where the lecturer would ask questions and we would be graded according to how much we answered. Before the assessment i sent every document to my friend. And she had memorized everything. I was nervous during the assessment so didnt know what i was talking and even the words didnt fit into a sentence.       Before the assessment i had talked with my lecturer many a times to clear my doubts about the assignment and answered many of her questions.          The reason i didnt com[plain to her about my friend was because i didnt want to ruin my friendship.

It got pretty heated, we almost had sex but I wanted to wait a little longer. Anyways, the last ex I had sex with, we've been broken up for 11 months now, and while our breakup was very dramatic and hard for both of us, we finally got over each other and have moved on. I used to have dreams about him all the time, but last night was the first one I've had in 2-3 months. It went like this:   I gave him a ride home and he wanted me to go into his house and talk to his mom, when we got to his house(which in real life is a 4 million dollar estate in a gated comm.) it was small, old, and the grass in the yard was dead. I found that very strange. When we got into the house, his mom looked way different than in real life, and she liked me a lot more than in real life. She made me a sweater for my birthday ?? She was giving me hugs and boasting about me to her friends etc. Then he made it clear to me that he wanted to get back with me...& I wanted to as well..      Theres more, but thats the just of it.   So can anyone help me figure out why I had this dream/what it means?

So here' the deal. I had an issue w/ the owners of the store where I am going to work because they are from Pakistan( y'all helped me solve that thanks by the way :).I also had some smaller concerns that I needed to resolve and so asked the manager if I could have a word w/ her.      We went through the smaller concerns without a problem but when it came to talking about the owners,she told me " Well then you are working in the wrong Company" No joke , and she is supposed to be an ordained minister and this was her answer. That is why I asked the question here because I couldn't get her to help me through it.   BUT what really got me was as I was trying to talk to her about this she was slowly trying to leave the room as if the conversation was over. I really needed to get her to help me and I felt like she really didn't want to talk about it.    I am not too keen on female managers that act more like insensitive guys and who also look like a  guy. I know that sounds really prejudice but she really seems more like a guy.    Her attitude and how she handled this really upset me and I am not sure I can work w/a woman that has the sensitivity of a rock at the bottom of the ocean. Am I being too harsh ? If you can imagine the situation , what would you do and could you work for a boos that was like this.    Please , be serious when answering and think your answers through. I have gone over it in my mind and really don't think I can work for this woman but anyone that has a good way to accept or handle this could change my view point.

I don' know who I am, only wat I presume myself to be, if I act nice, I think I'm nice, if I talk t much, perhaps I am annoying, but if you tell these things to a therapist, would they give you a honest answer. No matter what I do, the therapist finds a way to some how make my actions be that of a normal person, like no matter what I do, I am not mentally crazy or dumb in my decisions. Are therapists honest on their behalf of what personality I fall into and should I take their word for it, even if not 100% correct?

He flirts with everyone else, including this woman.   1. One day he is in the office, he calls me over and offers me a biscuit in front of everyone. She is also there. I take it. Then he offers her one as well. 20 minutes later in another room, in front of loads of people, she announces that he is giving out biscuits, then singles me out and says 'didn't you take one?'   2. He and I were ignoring each other so much that people noticed on a particular occasion and the situation was awkward. Next day, she comes into the room where I was and says what a fab job he has, she just saw all these beautiful young girls all over him and kissing him. I say well yeah, he is a nice man and she agrees, but sits down beside me, is acting weird and when I meet her later in passing I catch her looking at me smiling to herself.Even when I talk to her, she keeps this grin on her face.

She aid she talked to some of her friends at work and their daughters do the same thing.   This is horrible for me because she refuses to let me stay over at anyones house now because she is afraid I might sleepwalk and go outside and hurt myself.

20090307075413AAidDEu	Social Science;Psychology	This weird inner personality of mine. I HATE it. What can I do?	I have this really annoying and weird inner personality of me. When I do something, it silently tempts me to do more and more untill I can barely stop. For example:      I eat some patato chips but I don't want to get fat. Then, something inside me says, nah, you're not fat, take a few bites. So I do. Then, after taking em, I say, more won;t harm! I;m not fat! And I keep eating and eating till the whole pack is gone and my diet is ruined.      Example 2: I play video games during my exam. I come back from school and obviously, I'm supposed to study, but again, something inside me says, HEY, YOU'RE HAD A TENSE AND STRESSFUL DAY, go play some video games. So I do it then when it's time to study, I say, 5 more minutes! And then 10 more minutes then I say to myself, I'll study extra hard! Then 20 more minutes, I'll study very very hard!  In the end I end up with barely 30 minutes of studying time and nothing but a disspointed me.       Someone who understands what I'm going through, please answer. I really hate to tempt myelf with something I just can't stop doing or resist.

"The CSA's figures show that in the three months to the end of last year some 30% of nonresident parents failed to pay. Of women, 31% were nonpayers, while 30% of men did not pay."      Does this challenge anyone's ideas about the perceived bias against men in the CSA?      I was also quite impressed that 70% of parents paid, I'd been led to believe the whole system was in a shambles, and barely any payments were collected.

John: (now he noticed ted eyebrows and puzzled look) so he try to make him really uneased. that shirt is so outdated or something of that nature, keeps picking on ted.

How can ppl do that too someone and make them second guess their thoughts. Sometimes it's done subcounciously sometimes it isn't. What kind of sick pleasure does they get from that.

20090307091129AAAZJtu	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	What does this dream tell me?	I had a dream recently that incest was absolutely fine, yet I was not aware of this.   Parents kept telling me it was fine, and tried to get me with my sister.   My sister is 4 years older than me, blonde, good figure.   Now in the dream I refused, and in the dream I saw my dad giving my sister, (honest now. pretty much a good shag from behind).   Then in the dream, may have been  like a day later in the dream I'm not sure. My parents kept telling me it's fine.   So I stood there, thinking about it, then called my sister's name.   She came into the room, I sat down, she smiled and winked, and kneeled down between my legs.      You can guess the rest really. I woke up after like a minute of her giving me oral.          Now. When I woke up, I felt really weird. Sick almost, yet extremely turned on.  I felt so bad though.   I had to, "relieve", myself 5 times that day just to satisfy those thoughts.         What is this dream telling me?            BTW. Please don't go on about, "you're sick. get help"   This is serious.      Thanks.

20090307101628AAdkApa	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Why do modern Feminists feel that Rosalind Franklin did not receive sufficient recognition...?	*Long question.  Please do not waste your time with it if you're not interested.  Neither reading nor responding to a question is required.  There are plenty of other questions which merit your attention.   ______________________________________...      For her role in the characterization of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)?      Wikipedia has a superb discussion of Rosalind Franklin:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosalind_Fr...       Her methods for x-ray diffraction photography of DNA were largely the work of Raymond Gosling at King's College and their paper was published in the same issue of Nature as was Watson & Crick's:       http://www.nature.com/nature/dna50/frank...     http://www.nature.com/nature/dna50/watso...       Franklin was highly conservative and was reluctant to submit her data for publication until she felt there was sufficient evidence to prove her model, but as a result of this, Watson & Crick simply by chance submitted their model first based on their own x-ray crystallographic methods.      These sorts of races to beat the clock occur all the time in science and if anyone got screwed out of not receiving his due attention for suggesting the true structure of DNA, it's Raymond Gosling (a name it's doubtful many have heard), but this man had conceived a double-alpha helix structure for DNA as early as 1950 (three years prior to Watson & Crick's publication).      In terms of the Nobel Prize, the rules forbid posthumous nominations and since Franklin had died in 1958, she was ineligible.  The award was split 3 ways b/wn Watson, Crick and Franklin's student, Maurice Wilkins.  Had she been alive, she'd have certainly received the prize in conjunction with Watson & Crick.    http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medic...       Why do modern Feminists continue to dwell on some baseless notion that Rosalind Franklin was somehow slighted by the scientific community on the basis of her gender?   ______________________________________...      Clarification of the term "modern Feminism:"  This refers to Feminism in the context of what the movement stands for, de facto, in contemporary times as opposed to classical Feminism which is based on the old dictionary definition.  It is critical to make this distinction since modern Feminist is predicated on hatred of men, Supremacy and a sense that revenge against living men is rational and appropriate.
20090307101213AAkqKWD	Social Science;Psychology	What to do if my ex is a child molester?	A month after my husband and I got married, I was out of town at my grandmother's funeral and we had his 15-year-old neice stay at our home to babysit for a few days. After that time, she accused my husband of "rape" saying he came home drunk from a bar one of the nights and forced her to have sex with him. I didn't believe it and neither did her parents, since she was on some antidepressants and had lied about other things in the past (not as serious as this, however).       So, since this happened, he is now my ex-husband due to other reasons. Since then, I found out that long before we met, he was working as a janitor in a middle school and was accused of molesting a middle school girl. His father molested two of his sisters, and then both told me about it. AND, a few months after our divorce was final, my 13-year-old daughter (his step daughter) told me he was talking to her about how to rub her nipples while she masterbated, orgasms, etc., and asked to hold her hand (which he never did before) and she did. She knew this was wrong, but didn't feel comfortable telling me until after he and I broke up because she was afraid to make him mad. Although what he did to my daughter was not molestation, the psychologists I've talked to said it is "grooming", getting her ready for it by touching/talking, etc. When my daughter told me about this, I realized what happened with his neice was probably true and that he obviously has a BIG problem with 3 incidents in the past already.      Now, my ex-husband and i have 2 daughters in common, ages 6 and 1 right now. I don't think they are in danger now, but do believe something may happen when they are early teens, as that seems to be the age he preys on. My attorney says I can likely get the court to force him into some kind of treatment based on his history (which includes this rape/molestation stuff, suicide threats, and abuse of me and my children). I'm afraid if he is forced into treatment, it won't help anyway because he will never admit he has a problem or want to get help for himself so any treatment will be lost on him. I plan to educate my daughters on good touch/bad touch, etc., and watch very carefully over the years, especially when they become teenagers. The sad thing is this guy is a police officer, out there with a gun and authority, and is also a child molester & abuser; it's crazy.      I'm just looking for some advice, hoping there's an expert out there or somebody who has been through this before and would like to learn what may have happened with them or just any advice on what anyone thinks I should do.       Thanks!      I'm not sure what to do since he's never been convicted in the past, but obviously has a problem. Instead of pursuing through the Court, I was thinking about writing him a letter letting him know that I will make sure the girls know to tell me if he touches them or tries anything, so he knows everyone is watching. I'm hoping that will be a big deterrent. With everything else that's on the record, I think he will not take any chances. Should I do that?

I'm trapped in a situation in which I can't escape(i won't elaborate). No one talks to me at home and I lost my interest going outside.      Spending all my time alone, I find myself excessively daydreaming. I began creating a NEW ME that is way lot different from who I am now(like having different and happy family, being rich, studying photography and other scope of arts, etc.) I have actually made up my whole life, all in which my fantasies are fulfilled. I even created a plot, like when will this event happen, what am I going to do on that event..perfectly plotted.      Now, I'm afraid that I won't be able to get away from my fantasy and carry this in reality, so I could deny to myself that this misery isn't occuring. This fantasy is the life I really wanted, but so impossible to happen. Is this still normal?      I wanted to see a shrink so could talk about my situation(and it's really hard to keep it to myself), but I can't afford such expenses .. Am I prone to dissociative identity disorder??      HELP!!!
