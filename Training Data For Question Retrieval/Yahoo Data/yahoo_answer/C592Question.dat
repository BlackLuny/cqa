They are HORRIBLY painful. She has tried stretching and all that, potassium seems to make it worse. Everytime a cramp takes over her, I run to her with a heating pad, many fleece blankets, warm water, a brown bag for her to breathe into, and a pain relieving pill. It's become a routine. It's a VERY serious thing. A few times in her life, she had cramps while walking in the street. Once, she stopped right in the middle of a big city crosswalk just because of her cramp. Boy, she held up traffic. Is there any condition that describes this? My brother gets frequent cramps too, but not me... Is it genetic? My dad doesn't get cramps.

I fluctuate through the week by about 2-4 pounds, but I would really like to stay somewhere in the 168 range. I am an avid rock climber and have a body fat percentage of under 10%, probably closer to 8%. I used to have a 6 pack, and now I don't... you can still sort of see my abs, but not as well as you used to be able to.       I still climb like 10 hours a week... sometimes more, and I run 3-4 days a week. After my climbing time, I usually do push ups and sit ups.      How can I loose that last couple pounds (like 4-5 pounds)      I know of exercised called High Intensity Interval training, and I've done a couple and they are insane... they really work good. Since I am in really good shape, is this the only way???

Once this starting happening i cleaned them and it still doesnt seem to be working. I think it needs to be retightened because its not tight on my teeth as much as it used to be. Also to throw this out there when my teeth started separating faster is when i started to take animal pak which is a multivitamin and i started using listerine.

I went off due to weight gain. Since jan i went off paxil, weaned off slowly and onto lexapro, didnt work after a lil over a month went to buspar, didnt work. I was crippled by fear, i paniced everday, anxiety everyday, didnt want to leave my house. after a mo of that they put me on zoloft and i felt alot better. Not completely though. i still have panic attacks when driving alone, i cant breath, and i feel like im dying.  I feel so scared i can stand it. I freak out. im on 25 mg of zoloft and ive been on it since march 10 after two wks the script upped it to 50 and i felt worse, so they put it back down. Some days i feel great and others i want to be isolated and never leave the house. Paxil helped me achieve goals and dreamed i never thought i could do.
20070112214147AA3HxJA	Health;Diet & Fitness	I can't decide between Lap-Band and Gastric Bypass. Help?	After being obese since age 9 and just about every other diet and exercise program on this planet, I have finally decided to get a little more serious about bariatric surgery.      My insurance will cover a Roux en Y gastric bypass, but not a Lap Band. The gastric bypass seems a little extreme for me, but I can't afford any other options yet. Can anyone who has gotten the procedure and is a year or more post-op give me their perspectives?       Another reason I may want to hold back on something irreversible: I am only 22 and would like to have kids some day, but not soon. Is there anyone here who has had the procedure and became pregnant post-op?      Thanks in advance!
20090225160505AAiAsFG	Health;Diet & Fitness	I think i need steroids. Im so tired and mad, and i want muscle! Should I? Im really confused.?	I think this story would help to understand where i am:       At track practice today, we were throwing the shot outside. All my friends were throwing 35ft and above, but im stuck at 20 feet. Now, this is my first year, and not as strong as the rest, since i only recently got into sport. Im 15, a freshman, and i have a body build of a muscular person, too bad it's hardly muscle.       The second reason i want to take them is because of a kid named Justin. This guy is the strongest freshman we have, and he's benching 210. He allways pushes me around and says i suck, making fun of me before, during, and after practice. He even took my spot during football, and made it known that i suck at sports all over the school. Today a kid made a joke saying that i was going to come back in a year after using steroids, and kick his ***. Usually i would just chuckle and fantasized about it, but i really took it to heart. Im tired of competing to be as strong as him, and im tired of being weak, and feeling intimidated every time i walk into the weight room with the other athletes.      During football, the choaches even made fun of me, and i'm sure that our track coach is allready cracking jokes. Yeah, i know steroids are illegal, and its the "Wussy way to get strong", but im tired, so damn tired of being weak. I want to get big. Now.      Questions i want to know about steroids:      1. When should I take them? (10 min before practice, ect...)   2. What are the short term and long term effects?   3. Could i be allergic?   4. How long do i have to stay off for them to pass through my system, so i can pass a urine test? (we havent done any yet, and doubt we will)   5. How long before i start seeying results?   6. Addictive?   7. Any legal ways to get them/get working alternatives?      Thanks.      Keep in mind that i'll probably use them about 1-3 times a week, for about 2 weeks. Maybe less.

She didn't swallow them as i managed to make her spit them out, but they had begun to dissolve so she may have swallowed some of the chalky coating. The thing is, since then she has been having some pain in her lower back, mostly on the left side, i know that overdosing can cause liver/kidney problems and i am concerned. Could the pain be because of that or is it possibly co-incidence?   She must've had around 21 tablets in her mouth (judging by the packaging), could this have done her any harm? Or do you have to actually swallow tablets to overdose?   Please help, as i don't want to lose her.

20070318205529AAKLyZ0	Health;Alternative Medicine	Sealing up a wound?	So, I'm the person who posted this morning, asking rather desperately if garlic would stem the infection in my toe.      I have since then used a crushed clove of garlic applied directly to the wound and wrapped in gauze every few hours. The redness and swelling (so bad I could barely move my foot) are gone. The heat creeping slowly up my leg has all but disappeared. My boyfriend is very impressed (though, not so much with the smell I'm trailing around the apartment!) Garlic has done in a few hours what Neosporin failed at for over a week.       So, these are my questions: is there a point where, when the infection has entirely gone, and the cut is just a cut, that I should switch to some other healing agent? Something that will just mend it, a cream? I'm afraid that the garlic itself, if used too long, will inflame my skin. Also, I didn't use any olive oil before applying the garlic - mainly cause it was awfully expensive. Will this do me damage in the future?

20090225160003AA95le7	Health;Mental Health	Do I have OCD? And how bad?	For the past 2 weeks go, I've been having a few OCD symptoms. Here's a bit of info, ever since I was small I would have these obsessive symptoms now and then, which I thought I was normal. The only time before that my obsessiveness was concern to me was when 2 years a go. Every time I read a novel, I'd had to read each line it "properly" or until it feels right. End Result: I don't finish the book.      Now all of a sudden, it has come back in weird and more severe form. After a stressful event that happened with my friend ("a mean girl" thing). Before this event, I would get maybe obsessed with repeating in my head language phrases that I THOUGHT kind of made no sense/confused me. The thing is most of the time I do understand it from context, it's just my brain telling me I don't feel right. Well after, that event it escalated. Like overtime I read or listen to something that my brain almost like tells myself "This is confusing" I would get anxious and begin repeating the phrase in my head (ritualizing) until it feels right (thought we all know it never does). I have learned to stop ritualizing. However, in that place is anxiety and depression. I mean every morning for the last few days, I've been waking and feeling anxious/depressed/nautious and constantly thinking about an intrusive thought. Though I have stopped ritualizing which is good, the thoughts of "You won't understand that phrase in the future" and "You will never read a book again without feeling anxious and uncertain about it" It's very depressing. I feel more calm and relaxed in the evening, but mornings are awful =/.      Anyhow, what do you guys think? Is it just me being overactive (I'm a natrual at that) and stressed, or do I have some sort of OCD?

I just got results that I have breast cancer on my right breast Level 2, and the cancer is a little bit bigger than 2 centimeters. I told the doctor that I will like to get a mastectomy and then get some radiation just in case there where any cancer cells left which this is what the doctor recommended.    Ok, so I don't have insurance or anything. The total is coming up so far to $45,000 around there for the surgery.   Anybody know anything where I can call for help. I called a cancer place like a office for cancer patients they told me that they have a Financial Assistance. That's how far I have gone in this situation...   I will be more than happy to read every ones comments any suggestions or if you have gone thru this let me know what you did.    I'm in Florida.   Thank you so much for everyone for your support.

My mom used to be an alcoholic but she stopped drinking after a long talk with my dad. Recently my parents got divorced and my mom started dating the first guy that gave her any attention. He's a major alcoholic too, and my mom started drinking with him. Now she's passed out from drinking before 8:00 each day.       I'm far enough away from it all  (I'm in college 2000 miles away) for it to affect me directly, but my brothers are another story.       My mom is a wreck and we can't even talk to her about any of it for a fear that she might do something crazy. Her mother committed suicide and I'm very worried about depression leading to the same thing, her drinking, the sleeping medicine she takes when she doesn't pass out, and the man she's with. I'm not sure who to go to that can help her without pushing her over the edge. Its been a year and a half since my parents separation, but she's still just as hurt as the day they separated. What do I do?

Pensez vous que je suis sur la bonne voit (je cherche à ré-équilibrer mon alimentation et non à maigrir en 3 mois de 10 Kilos)    J'envisage de m'autoriser des bons petits plats 1 à 2 fois par semaine mais que le midi.       PS : je bois 1,5 litre d'eau / jours, je grignote pas entre les repas. Je suis pas une grande sportive mais je monte mes 5 étages à pieds tous les jours et essaye de faire un peu de step.       Merci de toutes vos suggestions.

Les mots font mal à entendre, mais c'est pourtant le cas.      Après m'être terrée longtemps sans parler à personne, j'ai décider d'aller en parler à mon médecin, car mon comportement commence à nuire à mon travail et à mon entourage.      Mon médecin, après avoir vaguement discuté avec moi deux minutes, m'a prescrit du "diclofenac" et du "prozac", avec pour toute explication : "c'est pour arreter le ptit vélo dans la tête" (selon ses propres termes)      Seulement voilà, j'hésite beaucoup à les prendre. J'ai peur de rentrer dans un cycle sans fin, de me crééer une dépendance et d'endormir mes problèmes plut?t que de les affronter...   D'autant que je suis une fille assez lente, qui dort beaucoup, et j'ai peur que ?a me rende complètement amorphe...      Que faire?      Que me conseillez vous?      Avez vous déjà eu recours à ces traitements, et quelles en ont été les réels bénéfices?      Merci!

Pues esto es para hablarles un poco sobre una sustancia llamada "monóxido de dihidrógeno" que se suele considerar útil. Hasta el momento esta sustancia es legal y muy comúnmente utilizada y no se han tomado acciones contra ella. Esta sustancia se le conoce también como "acido hidroxílico" y es el principal componente de la lluvia ácida. Es una sustancia tan potente capaz de acelerar la corrosión de los instrumentos eléctricos además de que disuelve muchos materiales. El contacto prolongado con ella en estado sólido provoca da?o a los tejidos mientras que su estado sólido es capaz de provocar quemaduras graves. Ingerirla al grado de llegar a una sobredosis puede provocar un paro cardíaco y su inhalación en peque?as cantidades es capaz de provocar la muerte. Se ha encontrado en tumores además de que al retirarla de alguien adicto a ella puede provocarle la muerte en 168 hrs.   Sin embargo su uso es industrial y legal hasta ahora. ?Qué opinan que se debería hacer con ella?

20070726200838AAVXuWG	Health;Women's Health	What is going on, positive hpt, followed by negative hpts and negative blood test?	I am a little confused, my last period was June 18th, cycles are regular, 28 days, I took an early home pregnancy test last Friday, it was positive (though very faint, but still positive within the time limit) then over the next couple days they were negative, had a blood test on Monday it was negative. I've had pregnancy symptoms and there's no sign of my period coming. Is it possible the negative results are wrong and I am pregnant? The reason I really need to know for sure is I have an appointment next Thursday to get an IUD, and I know that would be a bad idea if I am indeed pregnant. Should I ask for an ultrasound before they do this? I have looked online and there are instances of negative tests when the woman was indeed pregnant.

I have never really taken note if those times were rougher than others, but I doubt it, as we usually are at the same magnitude each time. What I think I have noticed however is that it occurs after my period (I am on Yaz birth control) about 5 or so days after my period. Could the soreness be a result of the birth control and normal sensitivity? There is no itching, it just feels sore, inside and out really. I have never been on birth control before, so I was curious.

I have noticed over the course of the past couple Months (yes months) that I have these small spots of skin that has peeled off.   Each spot is about 3/4" to 1/2" in diameter, all are almost perfectly round.    At first I noticed them on my back and shoulders as if I was peeling from a sunburn although I haven't had any sun exposure and the spots have since spread to my abdomen and above my pubic region.    The spots do not itch, no redness or any other signs.  I've seen cases of ezema and I dont think that it looks the same, although i'm not a physician by any means.    In my experience, when my skin peels after sun damage etc, it peels and then recovers over the course of a week or two.  I've noticed these spots for approx 2-3 months and they seem to be spreading.  Please help
