The thought that us little humans can drastically effect an entire planet is counterintuitive.  The idea that just warming up a  couple degrees over a hundred years can greatly harm us is counterintuitive.  The thought that we will have ice storms and record cold days on a warmed planet is counterintuitive.  So many of their arguments are appeals to intuition.

By making products from recycled materials rather than virgin materials, the natural resources are saved and fragile land is conserved.     Reduce environmental pollution   Making products from recycled material in most cases creates less air and water pollution than if products were made from virgin material because, in a majority of cases, it is easier to re-manufacture recycled products.     Save energy  Using recycled products to make new products usually uses much less energy than starting from scratch with raw materials. This in turn reduces acid rain, global warming and air pollution.     Save space   When the recycled items are made into new products, this means there is one less item that has ended up in landfill. The more we recycle, the more landfill space is conserved and this helps to reduce the problem of waste disposal.

J0bqxozSaa	Overpopulation in China    China and overpopulation are two words that have become synonymous over the years. Overpopulation in China has become a global issue as China is the most populous country in the world and its contribution to the international community is extremely significant. However it doesnt necessarily mean that a country with a high population is an overpopulated country. To clarify the meaning of overpopulation, here is a little description. Overpopulation in a country occurs when the number of people in an area is far greater than the countrys available resources (China Studies). The Peoples Republic of China has had this problem for many years and still the government hasnt come up with an effective solution. The Chinese government has to quickly alter its old population controlling policies because it is disturbing the countrys social and economic life, and if it continues, China could face a huge crisis in the future.    Chinas population started to increase dramatically after World War II. In 1949, Mao encouraged Chinese families to have as many children as possible. This is because the government thought the population increase would bring money to the country and help China produce more food, build a better army, develop water control, and establish communication systems (Chinese Population). For the next ten years Chinas population increased in millions every year. In 1949 the population was around 118 million, which increased to 540 million in 1960s. In 1970 the population increased again by 290 million, making it a massive increase of 712 million in just 20 years (Issue of Overpopulation).    The population increase largely depends on the fertility of a country. In the past 30 years Chinas fertility trend changed many times, making a great impact on the population increase. The fertility trend changed from about six children per woman to two children per woman. This was a result of policies introduced by the government under unfavorable social, economic, and demographic conditions (The Overpopulation Issue). China also joined some of the western countries like U.S.A into promoting this program. Now lets look at the fertility trends introduced in China since 1949 (Chinese Economics).    Chinas fertility transition can be distributed into six main steps. The first step was called the Initial High Fertility period, which took place from 1949 to 1957. In this period Chinas fertility was high and the death rate declined making a total fertility of 6.0 children per woman. The next period, also known as Great Leap Forward, occurred from 1958 to 1961. This period consisted of policy errors by the government and the fertility decreased from 6.0 to 3.3 making an increase in death rate. The period of Post-Famine Recovery happened from 1962 to 1979. (China) This was the period in which China reached its peak and the fertility increased from 3.3 to 7.4. The fourth period of Rapid Fertility Decline occurred from 1971 to 1979 and in this period the fertility decreased from 7.4 to 2.8. From 1980 to 1989, it was the Stagnation period, the one-child policy was introduced and the fertility decreased to 2.5. The last fertility period or Below-Replacement Fertility period which started in 1990 saw the fertility drop to 2.1 children per woman. We can infer from these statistics that although Chinas birth rate kept increasing and decreasing the population continued to grow steadily (China).    Population distribution of China is very unique in its style; if we look at it closely then we can figure out which areas of the country are contributing the most to the increasing population. Chinas population density of 126 people per square kilometer is very high (Overpopulation). However we have to understand that China is not divided into equal parts; there arent the same number of people living in a particular area. Some regions consist of mountains, some have farms, and some are metropolitan cities. The mountainous area does not support much of the inhabitants of the country. However there is booming population in metropolitan cities (The Overpopulation Situation). The stats basically show that China population is not proportionally distributed, some areas are have a high population density and some areas have a low population density.    Now lets look at some of the interesting statistics about the countrys population distribution at present. The population density in coastal areas is around 400 people per square kilometer compared to mountainous regions of 10 people per square kilometer. The population distributed by gender is composed such as males make about 52% and females make 48% of the whole country. The population distribution by area is, cities have 29% of population and the countryside consists of 71% of the total population. The distribution of population by age is as follows, population under 14 years makes 27%, 15-64 years make 67%, and above 65 years old people make about 6% of China (The Overpopulation Situation).    Analyzing these statistics, we can make some interesting conclusions. China doesnt have a balanced male and female proportion which could result in future problems. There are many people living in rural areas where there is not as much law enforcement as in urban areas, making it difficult for the government to force its population controlling policies. By age, at the moment, it is looking balanced as there are more people who are in the age to do jobs and make money for their young ones and old parents; however, the government still has to keep an eye on this and make sure it stays that way (China Studies).    Another major reason to eliminate the overpopulation problem is because it is hurting the countrys economy. To support such a big population the country needs more money to feed the people and to establish its new programs. However, if we see some |`|6f3238ea1c2231dd8623ab92761fcab4aa	too  many people= less food= wars and disputes|`|vX87DPRFaa	Inadequate fresh water for drinking water use as well as sewage treatment and effluent discharge   Depletion of natural resources, especially fossil fuels   Increased levels of air pollution, water pollution, soil contamination and noise pollution   Deforestation and loss of ecosystems that sustain global atmospheric oxygen and carbon dioxide balance; about eight million hectares of forest are lost each year   Changes in atmospheric composition and consequent global warming   Irreversible loss of arable land and increases in desertification  Mass species extinctions from reduced habitat in tropical forests due to slash-and-burn techniques that sometimes are practiced by shifting cultivators, especially in countries with rapidly expanding rural populations; present extinction rates may be as high as 140,000 species lost per year.

Those that don't have money allow illegal logging/mining because they are offered money.    Or those that don't have money need to make money and do so by logging and mining and selling to those with money.    In case you haven't figured it out, the recurring issue is MONEY.    The only thing developed nations can do is to boycott these products (that is ensure they buy only from certified timber, gold from mining companies with reputable business).

It always gets below freezing there in the winter, so the only thing that determines the amount of snow is the amount of precipitation.

Also, there's no reason an attractive car can't be lightweight.    The top end high-mpg cars do tend to be built to be more aerodynamic, and the rounded edges are intended to help with that issue.

AA11525891	Please don't. As an emergency services worker for most of my life, I can tell you that untrained and unsupervised volunteers are extremely dangerous and often cause more problems. You will get in the way and possibly endanger yourself and/others.     What you can do  NOW is to contact the red cross and join their disaster assistance program. You can also see if your municipality has some type of Office of Emergency Services or Civil Preparedness and talk to them about what you can do to to be ready to help when needed.     You can also look into joining search and rescue groups or animal rescue organizations like Noah's Ark before an emergency happens.    Oh and congrats on your marriage and thanks for supporting what your husband does and wanting to help.|`|pZmdGcf7aa	check with your local Emergency Management Agency, they will be able to tell you what their needs are. You may have to take some courses to qualify but would be worth it.|`|a5IodNYVaa	cooking. I guess people need to eat in disasters. baking flatbread is quite easy and they are yummy!
I38WF5aFaa	As an American who lives and works in a tourist town  I ask myself this question:  "How likely is someone from the Chinese factory to spend money in my town?"  On the other hand its much more likely that someone from the American factory will visit here to go fishing,  snowmobiling,  skiing,  moose hunting,  etc.  But only if he has a job.  That's why I buy American as long as the quality is as good and the price difference doesn't put it out of reach.|`|badeb4e509edbe31e00e0cf98a9ad4f3aa	Two years ago I was Christmas shopping and noticed many products were "Made in China."  From that point on I made an effort to buy products made in North America or by countries with a stronger environmental track record than China.    If a product is made in Mexico -- we've found this to be a good alternative in buying tools, for instance -- we are helping to provide jobs south of the border, and lessen the time and expense to ship a product to the U.S.  And products made in India, for example, help support an economy trampled by the rampant expansion of the Chinese government.  The Chinese expansion came at a huge expense to their own environment, present and future.    And finally:  Look at all the recalls of products produced in China.  There's bribery and a blatant disregard for human and pet health and safety.  When China acts as if it's merely one nation on a planet of many, I'll consider buying their products as a matter of course.  For now, given their environmental, human rights, and safety record, I avoid Chinese products whenever possible.    All that said, I have studied Chinese culture, and it's incredible.  They're a wonderful people guided by a government that has chosen a path unworthy of those who live there.  |`|aWTo9K22aa	Really, it depends on how much more. 1-5% more, I'll buy US just because most Chinese products I've bought are s**t. More than 5% difference?...well, maybe the Chinese one won't be THAT bad ^^|`|AA11525891	Because I own a small business that is affected by outsourcing and I am see the effects companies moving over seas I try to by American if I can. The other reason that particularlyly  buy American over chinese is because I do not trust chinese products and even though it is difficult, I avoid them when ever possible. Especially food products.|`|Cju2DvkSaa	 Where do you live? If you live near China, buy the Chinese heater because it saves mile of importing. If you live near the US, buy the US heater for the same reason. If you live somewhere in between, buy on made near your area.|`|Pexub6AUaa	When I buy DVDs of movies, if the price from Chinese are 10% lower, I will buy them.     Here, I recommend http://c2c-china.com, it's a good place to buy DVDs of movies, Kung fu, martial arts, massage.|`|6nb8ti6zaa	If we had more choices, I would buy more products made in USA, but the sad fact is, so much of our choices are made elsewhere.|`|fDSLiivIaa	if it is identical as you said, and it is not a food,   i have no problem with the chinese products.

xbgCwmbdaa	Maybe you should start a fuss with your school district. Start a petition and get the people to demand the end of this waste. Point out the fact that the styrofoam they are eating off today will be there when their children get old and that we need to be setting an example for the future by addressing the issue now. This is a GREAT site for bulk items that are biodegradable and also give discounts to schools....They offer 25% off to ALL SCHOOLS! Check it out, maybe even request some information from them or print it off yourself. Change happens because people like you want it to. Trust me, I've helped influence change before - and it is always the most rewarding experience.    PS, if you happen to like this idea and need any guidence - contact me @ willow_moonspirit@yahoo.com and I will do whatever I can.|`|YLkTpKI8aa	i would talk to the school board ( or get a parent to ) but i don't think there is much you can do.
