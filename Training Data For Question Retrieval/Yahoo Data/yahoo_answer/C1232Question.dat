20090203100722AAr2cdJ	Science & Mathematics;Astronomy & Space	Question about the origin of the universe and galactic collisions...?	On CNN the other day, they did a story detailing new discoveries involving galactic collisions.  However, while introducing the story, they mentioned (in passing) galactic collisions as a possible origin for the universe.  Yes, you read that right.  I missed most of the rest of the story because I was yelling at the TV.      My question is this:  was I right to yell, or is there anything at all of merit in what I heard on CNN?  It seemed like absolute nonsense to me, but I'd like to know what other people think as well.

20090203101716AAzfQLm	Science & Mathematics;Other - Science	In which situation will you bounce higher on a trampoline? and why?	the scenario is the comparison between bouncing on a trampoline in cold conditions (like snow) and normal conditions (normal weather conditions, probably overcast).    I say cold conditions would allow for more bounce, because:    -the fibres of material that make up the trampoline would be more taught  -therefore less likely to adsorb as much energy from the downward force applied, as in normal conditions   also - due to the restriction of their (fibrous material which makes up trampoline) movement, as a result of the cold environment   - a higher height would be reached in colder conditions    this is a simple explanation, however, im not sure if its enough detail or even if im right    please confirm if this is correct if you can, and offer other suggestions    *assuming persons of similar mass, size, height and weight, applying the same downward force, with no variation in other conditions- other than the temperature of the surroundings (with its effect on the trampoline).

20090219181118AABsJfh	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Please help with physics problem with friction!?	A ski that is placed on snow will stick to the snow. However, when the ski is moved along the snow, the rubbing warms and partially melts the snow, reducing the coefficient of friction and promoting sliding. Waxing the ski makes it water repellent and reduces friction with the resulting layer of water. A magazine reports that a new type of plastic ski is especially water repellent and that, on a gentle 200 m slope in the Alps, a skier reduced his top-to-bottom time from 61.60 s with standard skis to 37.11 s with the new skis. Determine the magnitudes of his average acceleration with each pair of skis.       A) Acceleration with old model ski?      B) Acceleration with new model ski?

20090219185142AAGS63V	Science & Mathematics;Alternative;Paranormal Phenomena	What do you think it is?	Ok, so a few years back my friend bought a brand new 3 bedroom town house and moved in.  It wasn’t the greatest place (badly designed), and not in the best area either, but it was his.   After he settled, I moved into the room down the hall from him.      From the first night I stayed there I noticed a few weird things;   Hearing someone walking up the stairs and around the second floor.   Hearing people talking coming from the third bedroom (which was the study).   People seemingly appearing, then disappearing in the front room.   When he bought a brand new stereo, it worked fine for a few months, then all of a sudden it would switch on and the volume would turn right up, for no apparent reason (even the remote was sitting on the coffee table).      What are your thoughts on these phenomena?      Edit:  We have investigated it and known what it is, but I'm interested in what you guys think...

When we eat food, chewing is endergonic, therefore, energy is released in the form of heat.    B. When we break down the sugars in our food, this is endergonic, therefore, energy is released in the form of heat.    C. Producing ATP from ADP is exergonic, therefore, energy is released in the form of heat.    D. When we break down our food in exergonic reactions, the reactions are not 100% efficient, therefore, energy is lost as heat.    E. None of the above describes why we produce heat when we eat.

I have a pharmacology (not pharmacy) graduate school interview soon.  The dress code is casual nice and the weather will probably be hot.  Is a dress like this ok?  I’m planning on wearing the blue one.       http://bananarepublic.gap.com/browse/pro...       I figure since it’s from Banana Republic, it’s probably conservative enough.  However I’m worried the dress length might be too short, specifically the slit in the middle (as displayed in the picture).  When I wear the dress and stand, the hem is 1 inch above the knee and the slit is 4 inches above the knee.  The slit is not noticeable standing, except when I walk.  However when I sit, the hem and slit hit my mid-thigh (5 inches above my knee).      Inputs anyone?  (Also, please comment if you’ve been on a graduate school’s interview panel before or if you’re a grad student or whichever walk of life your experience/ input is based on.) Thanks!

20090219192546AAd2jfO	Science & Mathematics;Physics	In striking the Earth, how large would an asteroid need to be to alter the Earth's orbit around the sun?	I'm not talking about a complete dislodging such that the Earth no longer orbited the Sun, but enough of a bump to alter the Earth's orbit by one or more degrees.  How large would that asteroid need to be?  And since F=ma (Force equals to mass times acceleration), how fast would this asteroid need to be traveling?  I'm guessing the answer could be found by estimating the force necessary to cause 1 degree of alteration in the Earth's orbit, then working backwards with an assumption of either mass or acceleration.        There may be an average speed for asteroids or some limit based upon friction from Earth's atmosphere.  I don't know the constants but am looking for some approximations based on one or more known variables, constants or reasonable assumptions.      For bonus points, what would the Earth be like in the aftermath of such a strike?  All life immediately fries?   Earth becomes clouded such that no sunlight enters and plant life dies resulting in all (or most) of life forms dieing?  Would any land be arable after this?  A new Ice Age descends?

20090219191334AA3kUe6	Science & Mathematics;Medicine	Is this dress/ outfit acceptable for a pharmacology graduate school interview (with a casual nice dress code)?	I have a pharmacology (not pharmacy) graduate school interview soon.  The dress code is casual nice and the weather will probably be hot.  Is a dress like this ok?  I’m planning on wearing the blue one.       http://bananarepublic.gap.com/browse/pro...       I figure since it’s from Banana Republic, it’s probably conservative enough.  However I’m worried the dress length might be too short, specifically the slit in the middle (as displayed in the picture).  When I wear the dress and stand, the hem is 1 inch above the knee and the slit is 4 inches above the knee.  The slit is not noticeable standing, except when I walk.  However when I sit, the hem and slit hit my mid-thigh (5 inches above my knee).      Inputs anyone?  (Also, please comment if you’ve been on a graduate school’s interview panel before or if you’re a grad student or whichever walk of life your experience/ input is based on.) Thanks!

Complete combustion assumes there is enough oxygen (O2) available to turn all of the carbon to carbon dioxide and all the hydrogen to water. So your chemical equation is:      CH4 + 3O2 ---> CO2 + 2H2O      So for each mole of methane combusted you have one mole of carbon dioxide and 2 moles of water. Since there is no change in T and P...the volume produced is proportional to the number of moles produced.      So you would have 29L of carbon dioxide.        i need help figuring out the water.
20090219181656AAB6Ijk	Science & Mathematics;Chemistry	Does sulfuric acid count as a reactant?	For the nitration of methyl benzoate to prepare methyl m-nitrobenzoate (C8H8O2 + HNO3 [(H2SO4)/----->] C8H7NO4 + H2O - sulfuric acid is above the arrow), is sulfuric acid part of the reactants? I  need to know because I'm trying to find the limiting reactant to find the percentage yield. Additionally, for my lab, .45 mL of sulfuric acid was added to the methyl benzoate and then a mixture of .15 mL nitric acid and .15 mL sulfuric acid was added later. If sulfuric acid is a reactant, to find the limiting reagent, would I just assume that I used .15 mL of nitric acid and .60 mL of sulfuric acid? I hope you understand what I mean. Let me know if you don't. Thank you.

Hi all,      I am currently looking into options for 'weather proofing' a section of a grass airstrip (recriational - gliders mostly). A section (about 800m long) has very black soil that appears to be very high in clay.       When it rains, it very quickly is unusable (anything more than about 10mm). We are looking at ways of firstly building the area up - as it's in a natural "drain" and water pools there, but also at how we can either put gravel over it, or if it is simpler/cheaper to add other soil types such as sand to it to change the properties of the soil, so it does not sponge up the water so easily.      Any ideas?      Thanks in advance.      Luke

20090219193611AAWSNnk	Science & Mathematics;Physics	What happens when you reach absolute zero...?	I've pondered this for quite some time, but never came across anyone who knew **** about science. Ponder this yahoooo answerer's...      In gasses, the colder the temperature, the less kinetic energy the gas has, also, the colder it gets, the molecules start slowing down more and more as it gets colder, alsooooo the colder the gas gets the smaller the mass (area taken up) gets... so my theory is, ( and i know 'absolute zero' is just a theory currently, because it hasn't been achieved yet)  if you bring the temperature of something, gas, solid, liquid, whatever, at absolute zero the molecules will stop moving completely and by that time the mass would be much less, if you were to reach absolute zero what do you think would happen???      my theory is, since the molecules stop moving, there's no kinetic energy to hold them in place, theoretically even the electrons stop moving... i think since the mass would be so little and everything stops moving, that it would be like disintegrating something, the molecules and electrons would fly away and bond with others since there's no energy to hold them in their places....       tell me what you guys think, and... tell me if i dont make sense i didnt double check my grammar.

Then, create a matrix of y values using the cosine equation y=vs+amp(cos(freq(x)-ps)) where vs is the vertical shift, ps is the phase shift, amp is the amplitude and freq is the frequency. Plot these x and y values using a red line.       Here is what i have so far.       clear   load sp09prog1.dat;   x = sp09prog1(:,1);   y = sp09prog1(:,2);   plot(x,y,'.');   hold on;   vs = -4;   amp = 2.99;   freq = 1.9;   ps = 1.52;   % Tried to create the matrix of X values like this but it didn't work   xval = (1:(2*pi):(pi/100)         the load data works and it plots the x and y values in the ap09prog1.dat file. just need help creating the x value matrix from 1 to 2pi incremented by pi/100. and the also the second y value matrix. and plotting that in red.      Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks!

It was maybe an inch or an inch and a half long. It had legs all around it's body. It was really weird. The body was like a circle or ovalish and the legs were kindof like a plume if that makes sense. Anyone know what it is? It's been a while since I have seen it so I am trying to remember as much as I can what it looked like.

20090203102640AAITzPo	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	What is the probability?	A computer software company has developed several grades and levels of sophistication of CAD software programs for the international market that are password protected for obvious reasons. The lead software engineer has developed 8 master password codes that would enable  access to any of the CAD software programs. Only one password code/string will provide access to any of the programs. The programs are designed in such a way that 40% of the programs are already  unlocked once a purchase is concluded and so those will not need the password. That means that 60% of the programs will still require the password in other to gain access. A call comes in to the software company from one of the overseas clients, and the software engineer for security reasons, selects 3 of the software codes at random to take with him to help the client turn on the program.    What is the probability that the engineer can gain access to the program without returning to make another selection?    Hint: Consider using the hypergeometric probability approach to this problem to determine the probability of the password working.
