Women should be especially cautious, but for men it isn't as dangerous.  Yes, my lips practically came off, and I got pink eye a lot, but the thing that bothered me the most was my hair falling out.  Even once I stopped the emds, it continued for almost a year.    I would talk to your dermotologist, and if no other treatments (topically have your tried various meds and orally antibiotics can be used, as well) have worked, I would consider this as a final resort.|`|330883b9b30f25516f912db0c9029de6aa	It's called ROACCUTANE in Singapore (generic name is ISOTRETINOIN). You'll have to see a doc to make sure you need it and he will decide how much is needed.   For mild to moderate acne, you really shouldn't use it because it's got side effects (Liver/ Cholesterol/ Depression).   A safer option is taking antibiotics (you can take virtually forever with no side effects) and/or apply effective medication given by your doc.   Don't go to Beauticians (all they do is squeeze your pimples!) or use over the counter stuff. Unqualified treatment can cause heaps of scars if you are not careful. But like any treatment, it takes 2 mths to work for any form of treatment.|`|f4eaf1917372946b0e5243e9feddf5caaa	I used accutane. I started it Jan. of 2005 and ended it that June. I had cystic acne--It was awful, my face was always covered with acne and it was always really red in pictures. Accutane worked really well for me. There are some side effects though. The dry skin was the worst for me, the dry lips are killer, but it is worth it. You have to get blood tested once a month while you are on it, but if you are scared of that it is really simple. I say if you have tried everything else, go for it. It worked for me!|`|df30abc4f34c9659385687bf4b56afafaa	Man, Accutane is awesome. I had the worst acne ever, I couldn't stand to look at myself in pics. I took accutane and it cleared my face up like magic. But make sure you buy plenty of chapstick (I reccomend Carmex) because it will dry your lips out bad. Its definitely worth it though.

The German philosopher, Shopenhauer, suggested that human beings should stop reproducing and let our species die out. There is one other solution proposed, and that is a spiritual one.

AA11370541	&^&^&^    Take your choice dookter.  Or for a  consult ...    Did you know you can tell a lot about a person by looking at their nails? Not just what their shade of polish is, or whether they do heavy housework or not by the nail length. We're not just looking at cosmetics here, but rather at unpolished nails and seeing if they have anything to say about health.    (As always, it is important to note that this is provided to be purely informative, and under no circumstances should one take this information and use it for self-diagnosis. If you are concerned or suspect you may have any condition, see your doctor immediately.)    Nails are our protection for the nerves in our fingertips, while toenails protect toes from damage or injury. They are part of the skin layer and are made up of a protein called keratin.    A healthy blood supply will create a peachy-pink nail bed. If there is a deficiency or physical problem within our bodies, the fingernails can show it.    What are some of the problems that an show up on the nails, and what are the signs?    Discolored nails: Diabetes, stress, allergies and simple illness can cause your nails to appear discolored. A greenish nail color, however, can be a sign of infection, either in the nail bed or in your system.    Bluish nail beds can be a sign of lung trouble, such as emphysema or even asthma. A simple dark blue line in the nail can be a sign of skin cancer. Tiny black streaks can indicate a heart problem, while reddish-brown spots can indicate a deficiency of folic acid, protein or vitamin C.    Yellowing nails are early signals of various internal disorders, such as diabetes, respiratory or liver problems. White lines in or across the nail can signal fever, liver or heart disease, kidney disorders or, more likely, a lack of iron or zinc in your diet.    We see what the color of our nails has to say, but what about the shape, texture and overall condition?    Nail shapes: Nails that tend to curl under at the tips can signify respiratory or heart problems, while nails that are raised at the base can also signal respiratory trouble. Square, wide nails can be a result of a hormonal disorder while flat, thin nails can be from insufficient vitamin B12.    The texture of fingernails can tell as much about a persons general health as the color can. Below are some common texture abnormalities and what they can possibly indicate.    Nail textures: Vertical ridges that appear on the nail can indicate disorders as simple as iron deficiency, poor absorption of vitamins and nutrients, overall poor health or they could indicate something as serious as kidney trouble. (So, you see why consulting your physician is so important.) These vertical ridges, as well as bumpy nails, can also suggest that one is prone to developing arthritis. Ridges running horizontally across the nail can indicate physical or mental stress.    Nutrition plays an extremely important role in every function of our bodies, right down to the tips of our fingers and toes, literally. As well as signs of other possible disorders, nails can let us know how we add up when it comes to getting all of our required nutrients.    Since nails are mainly made up of protein, they can immediately alert us to a lack of it in our diet. White lined bands across the nail beds can signal a protein dificiency. You can get protein from beans, oats, seeds, nuts, eggs and lean meats.    Calcium is also important for healthy nails. Without it, the nails lose their strength and become brittle and dry. You can find calcium in green leafy vegetables, dairy products, sesame seeds or even a daily supplement.    As mentioned before, ridges in the nails can be a result of vitamin deficiency, one of which is the B vitamins. Vitamin B is needed for strengthening, while vitamin B12 also strengthens while promoting normal nail growth and healthy coloring.    Vitamin C is another necessary vitamin. Adequate intake can help prevent hang nails and swelling of nail tissue, and a frequent occurance of either of these symptoms is a good indication of a deficiency.    Probably the most common sight on the nails is the "white spot". Although it has been noted that white lines can be symptoms of a serious disorder, their presence is more than likely a result of iron or zinc deficiency. Before worrying about any severe disease, your first step should be to see your doctor and have him/her test your levels of iron and zinc. Zinc supplements are easily found in any pharmacy while additional iron intake needs to be monitored by your physician.    The best way to assure yourself of healthy nails is to eat a well balanced diet. You'll need plenty of protein as well as fresh fruits and vegetables. Sufficient water intake is also important, for as well as keeping the rest of you healthy it provides moisture for nails. If you feel you are still not getting enough essential vitamins and minerals it is recommended that you take a comprehensive supplement.      Hindsight is 20/20 but Foresight is 20/13|`|AA12274374	Are you talking about the dirt underneath your fingernails? You can remove it effectively with a nail file.|`|8400c6b4e2def833eefb5fcd5f87ff6aaa	I've never heard of or seen such a thing.|`|AA12195034	Discoloration in the fingernails can be caused by many things. There is a chemotherapy drug that causes red/pink lines! Injuries can cause changes. Eczema and other skin problems can cause pitting and deep ridges.    Changes in nails can be a symptom, and your doc probably looks at them every time he or she examines you. So, if it's something that started recently, ask your doc to take a look.  It may be nothing, but it might have to do with a nutritional problem or something you're system is absorbing that it shouldn't be. (Chemicals usually cause a horizontal line though.)

AA10790287	Krista says: "Lots of water, 3-4 liters a day, not all at once, but spread it out. Its really easy to down a liter or two while your watching tv or on the computer. Also drink some after you eat the bigger meals of the day, it helps your body pick out the nutrients in food when your food is more spread apart. "    ROTFLMAO!!    There's no proof that anyone needs that much water.  NONE. Just folklore, urban myth, old wives' tale. (See references)  And the belief that "it helps your body pick out the nutrients" is just plain unfounded.  Your body does a fine job "picking out" nutrients with or without excess fluids.    Bottom line: Drink when you're thirsty.  Period.  Do not obsess over or worry about getting some arbitrary amount of water as a daily "goal".  You already get most of the water your body needs from the food you consume.  The rest of Krista's advice is reasonable.  But she's got some crazy ideas about physiology.

Get a fitness calculator that you can put on your cell phone and computer. This will allow you to easily calculate this formula, log your daily calorie consumption, and register your physical activities.    *2) Eat natural and organic foods found on earth versus something created by a corporation to make money. Eat meals in small portions throughout the day and take a good multi-vitamin supplement.     Avoid High Glycemic Load Carbs (sugar, pastries, desserts, refined starches such as breads, pasta, refined grains like white rice; high starch vegetables such as white potatoes) and drink lots of water.     Do not try fad diets or diet pills. Here is an excellent food pyramid that anyone can follow: http://www.rayandterry.com/html/images/P...    *3) Exercise on most days by doing cardiovascular training and/or resistance training activities.     Read a book or find a certified trainer to make sure your doing all resistance training exercises correctly. A great book to buy that teaches you the resistance training basics is Weight Training for Dummies. A superb magazine to buy with excellent resistance training routines that will not get you bored is "Muscle and Fitness". Signup for the free newsletter.    A good book to buy that teaches you the cardiovascular training basics is Fitness for Dummies.     *4) Get plenty of sleep. Sleep experts say most adults need between seven and nine hours of sleep each night for optimum performance, health, and safety.     *5) Educate yourself continually on health issues and make a life long commitment to good health. A great free publication is Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005. A superb book to read is You The Owners Manual. An excellent periodic publication is the Nutrition Action Health Letter. A reputable test you can take to measure your biological age is at http://realage.com    Look at all areas where you can enhance your health.

Did your mom always make homemade meals with lots of veggies and now you're on your own and eating lots of tv dinners and takeout?    Are you at college?  The freshman 15 is real thing, because the quality of college food is not the best, and it tends be greasy and pre-cooked.  You don't sleep as much, which can be bad for weight gain, and there's lots of beer at college, and that has some calories as well.  I obviously don't know what you're doing wrong more than anyone else.  Your metabolism might just be beginning to slow down.  I would go to the food pyramid website (I don't know if you're in the US but you could check it out even if you are not).  You can put in your age and height and weight and it gives a guide of how many calories should come from carbs or fats or proteins.  You could write down what you eat and compare it to what they say.  It might help you!    If you find that even with exercise and diet change you still are gaining weight, go to a doctor and explain what's happening.  Sometimes these things can be caused by thyroid disorders or other easily treatable physical ailments.|`|8b2cac696b4c7db5e585dd951e29f0ffaa	Eat 6 small meals per day, balanced 50-50 protein and carbs, add a small salad to two of those meals. Drink at least two cups of water with each meal. Alternate cardio and weight-training every other day (preferably in the mornings). This will help you to build muscle. Muscle is a fat burner that revs up your metabolism, and it takes up less space than fat so you'll look much more svelte.    Following this program diligently will help you to see amazing (and lasting) results in as little as three months.|`|AA12086491	Be your own trainer and nutritionist, the basic rules to losing weight are no soda, no fast food, lots of chicken, fish, fresh (not canned thats bad) fruits and vegies, whole wheat stuff, yogurt. Not so many cakes and donuts and cookies. Basic common sense for eating, you just need to enforce it. Get all the bad stuff out of the house right away, just toss it or give it away while your still motivated. No alcohol and no smoking  if that applies. Lots of water, 3-4 liters a day, not all at once, but spread it out. Its really easy to down a liter or two while your watching tv or on the computer. Also drink some after you eat the bigger meals of the day, it helps your body pick out the nutrients in food when your food is more spread apart.  Dont think that sports drinks can replace water, the only time you need to drink them right after a workout, besides that just stick with water. These rules may be hard to adapt to at first so start with cutting out the things you know you can live without.  Then work from there.  Remember these are  perfect eating habits, it can take you a while to work into it.  If you know you cant live without your one treat a day, dont fight it by trying to eat something else, just eat it and make sure thats the only one you cheat on a day.  Otherwise youll get depressed and quit.  Another important point is getting the right amount of sleep every night.  You need 8-9 hours of sleep each night for your body to function correctly.  This is an important factor of losing weight.  Set up a routine for yourself and go to bed at about the same time each night.    As for exercise, lots of cardio. Find something you like. If you have never exercised much before, start with walking 30 minutes a day at a brisk pace. Move on to different terrains that include hills and increase the time spent. After a week or two, try jogging the route. No matter what find an activity you enjoy. Walking to jogging is just an example, try hiking, rollerblading, biking. Once you get into a regular routine, if your not happy with the level of difficulty, try signing up with a gym. Spinning, pilates or kickboxing classes are great. It will also introduce you to working with weights. Talk to a trainer for instruction before using any weights. A cheap investment is a balance ball, it works you stomach while your just sitting on it, like at your computer and its great for posture. There are hundreds of exercises you can use it for for your entire body. I can give you some ideas if you want, just email me.

Milk actually helps keep weight down as does yogurt.|`|35fe5b9a4d147cd95b69a68eb9c0ad00aa	If you become vegan, make sure you get some of the things you need that comes from those food (fat, dairy etc) someplace else.

Second, if you don't get one food group, your body will compensate for it. so it wont change anything.  but if you exercise you will lose weight.|`|80c796ec07bcc591db9225e12f192ce7aa	There is no such thing as a diet that lets you eat however much you want of anything. Take it easy on the pasta (lots of carbs) but eat lots of fresh fruits and vegetables and nuts for protein, and be carefuly not to overcook your veggies, the longer you cook them, the less nutritional value they have. Vegan is the best way to go, but you always have to be aware of portion sizes. If you must eat out, order off the child's menu, or ask the waitor to only bring out half the meal, and put the rest in a to-go container. And of course lots of water, thirst can often be mistaken for hunger. (And a little tip about water: Drink it w/out ice, room temperature water is much easier for the body to metabolize)  Well good luck!!!|`|88f4d234d5926cca8f2bb2aa3ad2526baa	It really depends, sugar is the biggest factor in weight gain because when it is present your body will always choose sugar as fuel and store any fat you eat, because only a small amount of sugar can be stored in the form of glycogen in the liver, but fat can be stored all throughout the body. Not eating animal products means you won't be eating long chain saturated fatty acids which has been shown to contribute to weight gain much more than unsaturated or medium chain saturated fatty acids that is in plants. Pasta contains a lot of starch which is converted into sugar so you might not want to eat loads of it. Just get a balance of protein from seeds, nuts, grains, legumes, etc. , and fat from coconut oil, palm oil, olive oil, etc. and carbs from fruit, starch, etc. Keep it balanced and exercise alot and you will lose weight.
AA11107363	My knees crack when I go up and down stairs, when I crouch, when I sit, when I stand, when I do anything that involves bending my knees.  It's happened my entire life, and my father has the same thing.  It has never caused me any trouble at all, except that I get strange looks sometimes when I need a library book from the bottom shelf.    If the cracking is accompanied by pain, or if it started at a time when thought you might have hurt your knee, then see a doctor.  If not, you'll be fine.

e1066e3c0b6057fc82ed41e457bb21c3aa	You could have some inflammation in your chest that is causing the discomfort.  Its possible you bruised a muscle and didnt realize it.  The best thing to do would really be to get things checked out.  You can never be too safe, and perhaps the pain is continuing because you're focused on it.  Get it checked out.|`|xFgMqDN6aa	YOU NEED TO GO TO THE DOCTOR. it could be something with your heart.|`|6203c5b02e0ca7e58d24d428421af0dfaa	You should go to our doctor if it doesn't get better soon.  That could be a lot of things.  My first thought is GERDs or gall bladder since you don't think it could be your heart.  Another possibility could be bronchitis and/or sinusitis.  This is a rare one, but if you have endometrioses it could be related to that.
AA12008160	I'm not quite sure what you're getting at here.  Do you know that yeast infection are NOT typically an STI?  That's probably why you have been getting them from a young age.  Yeast infections are related to imbalances in the bacteria and fungi that normally live in your vagina.  Yes, yeast infections can be passed on to partners, but that is not where you got it from, so don't worry about that.    As for treating it, you need to have a close look at your diet, lifestyle and hygiene.  Diets high in refined sugars and carbohydrates can contribute to thrush (another name for yeast infections).  Try to eat plenty of fresh veges, fruit, whole grains and especially live culture yogurt.  These natural bugs help to stop overgrowth of the candida bugs that cause all your woes.  Wear cotton undies and avoid tight fitting clothes in that area.  Go commando occasionally (when appropriate) to air the area.  Don't use perfumes or creams down there, just keep it clean with water (soap can cause irritation too) and be careful to wipe front to back always.    You should also mention this next time you see your doctor, as it sounds as though there could be some sort of imbalance in your system to cause so many outbreaks.  With your doctor, explore the possibility of irritation caused by latex (condoms) or even semen, which does happen in some women.    Good luck!|`|AA11107363	It's a yeast infection and your doctors are giving you antibiotics?  That's the problem, honey.  Yeast infections are aggravated, not healed, by antibiotics.  Any doctor who prescribes antibiotics for a yeast infection isn't worth the air he or she is breathing.    Since it seems your doctors are not too smart, try natural cures instead.  The best one (works for me!) is to get some unflavored yogurt.  Before you go to bed, ladle a few teaspoons of the yogurt into your snatch.  Then go to bed in loose, white cotton panties.  repeat until infection subsides.  Since you seem to be so prone to yeast infections, you might want to use a spoonful once a week, just to keep things in balance.    Good Luck!|`|de0afa73251e409430a9d19b5156ec33aa	Wear loose fitting jeans and cotton panties. Or buy panties with a white cotton sheild inside. Colored panties can cause a yeast infection. Also avoid scented tampons and colored or scented toilet paper.|`|AA12365491	Start wiping your bottom from front to back.|`|f8e7da1057e7d0ccf366adb441fadd64aa	Chronic yeast infections can also be a sign of diabetes....you can also have recurrent ones from a staph infection....only found with the PROPER culture test.  The constant antibiotics are putting you in a Catch-22 circle, too.   You need to change doctors, for starters.|`|AA11538258	its sounds like a hormonal imbalance that needs correcting love|`|8a145c1b06b12ffabe2daee9ad9fbed9aa	Have some blooodwork done. Taking antibiotics can actually bring on Thrush as it is commonly know .Antibiotics are not routinely used for this. The ph in your vagina is out of whack it becomes too alkali instead of acid this allows the yeast too multiply and cause the symptoms you explain. Naturopaths have very good success at dealing with problems like these, although I have not had to go to one myself but as you have had many courses of antifungals and antibiotics i think you should broaden your horizons on different treatments available.

Eat meals in small portions throughout the day and take a good multi-vitamin supplement.

iZmZKRSjaa	DO NOT TAKE DIET PILLS! They are dangerous!!<br>  <br>  Last year I was visiting my parents and took diet pills (Leptopril -does not contain ephedra) on top on my exercise routine and normal diet. I was 26 at the time, 5'11, 180 lbs. By week three I was sick. I had diarrhea, dry heaves, dizziness, headaches, and a general feeling of being sick. I thought I had caught the flu or something. I had lost 13 lbs in 4 days. One morning I told my mom I didn't feel good. My vision kept blacking out and I felt (for lack of a better way to say it) stoned. Later that afternoon I was walking from the bathroom to my bedroom (a 5 foot walk) and I passed out. I was rushed to the hospital emergency where they did a bunch of tests on me.<br>  <br>  My pulse was up to 120, My blood pressure was 150/40, they had to start me on an IV, the did an EKG on me, took blood and urine samples, and a whole barrage of other tests.<br>  <br>  They finally got me stabilized and said that I was dehydrated and malnutritioned. I told him that I took diet pills. When I mentioned diet pill, the doctors face lit up and said that's why. He said they can cause a whole bunch of health problems, including death. He told me to toss the diet pills or next time I might not be so lucky.<br>  <br>  I was kept in the hospital for almost 10 hours, given 3 or 4 IVs, potassium, juices, and monitored (by the EKG, blood pressure, and heart rate machines) every 15 minutes.<br>  <br>  Please take my story as a warning. If you seriously want to loose weight there are better ways (I know because I've lost weight after this)<br>  <br>  The quickest way is to cut out red meats, starches, breads, sugars, alcohol, and sodas.<br>  <br>  Eat veggies (salads are good), soups, and drink TONS of water. If you get hungry between a meal, drink water to fill up.<br>  <br>  In moderation eat white meats, and fruits (fruits contain natural sugars, and that can put on weight)<br>  <br>  Practice portion control. Yes, you'll feel hungry at first, but think of your goal, and soon your stomach will start shrinking and you won't have that feeling anymore.

FHobffifaa	Hi! I have the perfect solution. P.S im on it right now! You need to set a goal for yourself. My goal is 6 weeks to have a better body. Throughout this time you need to write a food journal. What you are trying to stay away from is fatty (unhealthy) foods such as chips, chocolate, sodas and even fruit juices. If you feel the need for sugar grab a handful of grapes. Its like having a lolypop and or juice. Also try soup. It fills up just like a meal except with fewer calories and fat! (preferably veggie or chicken soup) If you are the person who eats when you are bored, try sugar free gum. (not trident sugar free it's proven to be BAD). My meals consist of Mint green Tea in the morning (no caffeine) with 1 egg, a snack of grapes, lunch is soup, apple, banana and yougurt, then dinner of soup and desert strawberries. As for the excersise take 10-15 minutes of your daily schedule and jog on the spot, march with your knees up high, or dance to a couple of your fav. songs. Oh by the way 8 mins of skipping burns 100 calories or 2 rams of fat! GOOD LUCK!!!!!|`|yp1PSWNdaa	Dance to your favorite songs or you can do sit -ups|`|AA11090334	eat slightly less, drink more water, and do exercise (walk/run)|`|f4c231a6e0293d940a2c4bf552f1c3f6aa	Hey sweetheart, don't panic.  13 years old is when it will naturally begin to fall off into your real woman's shape. <br>  <br>  Here is the simple way to loose 10 lbs.

Sit up are mainly just for guys to do, but its your choice. If you want to get your arm in shapes and dont have any access to any weights, push-ups are good to do. As for your legs, you can do many things including running, walking, jumping rope, or bunny hops. Im not sure how you can work your thighs out without any kind of equipment, though.<br>  Dont forget to eat well, you dont have to eat all vegetables, but do watch what you eat. And make sure you drink PLENTY of water!!

nSUXcETWaa	Reflexes are difficult to improve drastically because they aren't just dependent on muscle conditioning. They are also borne out of your body's nervous system; and in that case, for the most part, you either have exceptional reflexes, or you don't.<br>  <br>  There are exercises to help improve the muscle-bound portion of reflex action. Throwing a ball off a wall and fielding it is one example of working reflexes and muscle memory, for instance, if you are a baseball player. A generic answer is all I can offer, considering the general nature of the question. <br>  <br>  If you search on the internet, try searching for reflex tests where you press a key after seeing a flashing color, for instance. That will help "map" the nerve synapses in your brain and spinal column to improve your mental reflex.<br>  <br>  The rest is simply to get in better shape, and your muscles will react quicker as a whole on their own.|`|nR1fyUzqaa	a lot of practice and those weights that yoiu strap on your wrist and ankles use those to do punches and stuff. it works cuz i don it.

If it wasn't for mydeathspace, I am sure her profile would have been difficult to find.

SOmetimes they just want someone to listen to them and don't want to be preached to. Many people who want to end thier lives, do not want to kill themselves, they just want the darkness to stop... they want an end to thier pain. and talking to them about God inapropriately can sometimes have a negative effect. <br>  <br>  Talking to someone about how and when, contrary to popular myth, will not cause one to commit suicide. in fact it puts it in better perspective for them and again, nothing you say or do would change thier minds, or alter thier decision.

It works, but doesn't remove fiber from your body, I think.|`|nQ2BA03laa	Yes it does, but not as much as some people make it out to be.<br>  <br>  Green tea helps you lose weight because it contains catechins, caffeine and theanine. These compounds interact with each other when consumed and promotes weight loss, more than individually alone.<br>  <br>  Any high quality green tea will have an optimum level of these chemicals. In fact, loose-leaf green harvested using very young tea shoots have the most of these beneficial chemicals.<br>  <br>  Taiwanese Population study (first link)<br>  <br>  Green tea is especially useful in burning fat.<br>  <br>  A medium scale Taiwanese study provides the best evidence yet that green tea and oolong tea help lose weight. <br>  <br>  1,103 participated in the questionaire over 10 years. Researchers found that long term regular drinkers of green tea and oolong tea have significantly less fat.<br>  <br>  The study found that it is not just the amount you drink; the longer you drink, the more evident the tea weight loss effect.

Losing 50 pounds in 6 months is a lot of weight and i don't know what your starting weight is. From what you said you seem to be on the right track. Eating healthy and exercising regularly is the only way I've ever seen someone lose weight. Know that weight loss takes a lot of time, and most of the people that fail at it fail because they burn out with it. The thought of weight loss consumes their thoughts and they just simply get tired of it. Or, people try to lose weight so fast that they never really change their lifestyle, and they gain the weight back as soon as they get off of the diet. A half of a year of trying to lose a lot of weight, like you are doing, is hard to keep up. Instead of focusing on weight loss try focusing on living a healthy lifestyle. Over time I'm sure you will get to the point you want and be able to stay there.|`|9ed8995fa7e503403c73fff6813c33c7aa	Checkout SparkPeople.com.

For someone who hasn't worked out in a while, I suggest that you start out light and work your way up, like with a light cardio such as a crosstrainer, elliptical, walking or jogging, and then burn some more fat by keeping your heart rate up while working your way up weights, a comfortable weight  for you and higher reps, such as 3 sets of 8 or 10.|`|NG3adUFRaa	I love to eat food ( *v* ) so I do yoga everyday!

39e46128b8ea5a82c45af42790e8132daa	If you've only had sex a few times before, it could possibly be your hymen tearing a bit each time. For some girls, the hymen doesn't just tear completely with one sexual encounter (if they even make it to their first sexual encounter with an intact hymen), but rather stretches and tears a bit more the first few times she has sex. However, bleeding or pain during sex after the first time is a sign of other serious female health issues and you SHOULD absolutely see a doctor about it, regardless of whether you're embarrassed about it or not. <br>  <br>  In fact, once you become sexually active, you should start seeing a gynecologist, anyway, so my advice to you is to make a doctor's appointment and get this checked out.|`|7rex79GLaa	i bleed a little for the first times to <br>  its from brekign tissues and stuff<br>  it will eventually go away<br>  mine did after like 6 times|`|cLDEnLgCaa	hopefully your old enough to be having sex, though I would think if you were, you wouldn't be afraid to tell anyone.

I highly recommend going to Planned Parenthood, though, to reduce the potential stress you could go through from going to a local pharmacy and getting it (I'm sure you're familiar with rediculous pharmacists refusing women EC). <br>  You might also want to try a women's health clinic/abortion clinic. If you go that way, PLEASE make sure you're going to an ACTUAL women's reproductive health clinic and not a fake one (also called "crisis pregnancy center") as they give you misleading information and will end up not giving you any.

Be careful, because you can actually faint. Your blood pressure should stabilize within a very few minutes, or less, and should be within a normal range when you're lying down. It isn't a specific disease or anything, but can be the result of some cardiovascular problems. Sometimes it can be caused by anemia, diabetes, some RX's, tiredness, over-eating, and other reasons. Most of the time, you just need to get up from a sitting or lying position really slowly, in order to give your blood pressure time to stabilize. I used to have to grab walls, or whatever was around, in order not to fall to the floor, when I was younger, and skinnier. Once I got older and fatter, (LOL!) the orthostatic hypotension went away! You probably should go to the doc and get it properly diagnosed though.

wXcO4jM5aa	I was 105 before I had my daughter and like 140 after. It's really difficult to try to figure out how to lose weight when you have never had to worry about it before. I cut out as much white flour and sugar that I could and just made healthier choices about food (fresh fruits and veggies, whole grains, cut out the junk food and high fat foods). I also started running. This worked wonders for me. I am now still like 125, but I am about the same size I was before I had my daughter and I'm in much better shape, I just have muscle weight now. You might never get back to 115, because your body structure has changed and that's normal. You can still be at a healthy weight and be lean without reaching that weight again. It took me a while to figure that out. <br>  In other words, it may take time, but a healthy diet and good exercise is the only healthy way to lose the weight.|`|AA11303176	I was 5ft 4in 120lbs before I had my baby and after I had her I was 148.  I breastfeed too.  I had the same problem but, around the time she started crawling and walking(8mos ish) I noticed the weight just seemed to fall off on it's own.  I asked my doc and she said some of it is just hormones.  She said remember it took 9 mos to put it on and it'll take 9 mos to take it off b/c your body needs to re adjust itself.    Also if you aren't eating much your body won't let you lose weight b/c it's trying to survive.  I had a friend who got fat from being anorexic.  I also do the self challenge.  It's free.  Here's the link.|`|XEyDdVO3aa	Hi my name is Sharon, <br>  <br>  Your problem is different your are right.  While you are breast feeding you will not lose weight by dieting.  Your body knows that you are supporting two people. Yourself and Baby.  When you deprive yourself your body stores everything to make sure you can feed the baby.<br>  <br>  The best thing to do is eat a good breakfast have fruit as a snack and a good lunch and a afternoon snack and a good dinner.  Then you will notice that your body will level its self out and you will lose weight.  Take the baby for walks.<br>  <br>  When you are done breast feeding I have an excellent program.  <br>  <br>  But remember diets will mke you gain weight when your breast feeding.  Eat well and you will lose.<br>  <br>  I have been helping people lose weight for a long time. <br>  <br>  I currently have 6 ladies on my program. The first week results in lbs are Jamie 6.5, Lou 7, Cecelia 9, Tammy 7 and Jessica 6. Their ages are 18 - 47. This program uses a great combination of foods that will give you results and I show you what to eat. You choose the things you like. <br>  <br>  The program is a 3 week program and you can lose up to 24 lbs if that is your goal or stay on week 3 until you meet your goal.<br>  <br>  I usually help girls that are getting married and want to lose before the wedding. I have also helped girls before spring break and currently prom. <br>  <br>  The program does not use drugs of any kind. If you want to reach me by phone let me know and I will provide my number. I am in Arkansas<br>  <br>  I have a website that I am building to market the diet. You can see the program at www.bellaviadiet.com.<br>  <br>  Send me an e-mail if you have other questions or decide to use my program. That way I can send it to your email and you can get started when you are ready.<br>  <br>  Thanks and remember you need to eat a good balanced diet to lose weight right now.

I lost 12 pounds in 9 days and then 28 pounds in less than a month. I also lost a lot of inches too!   I learned that cleansing will help the body get rid of toxins.  Toxins come from a lot of things like fast food, pollution, food additives and preservatives and lots of other things.  The toxins get stored in the fat in our body.  To get rid of the fat, we have to get rid of the toxins by cleansing the body.  This made sense to me and I decided to try a cleanse program and it worked.  The weight came off fast and this kept me motivated to keep going, not like other diets where the weight loss it too slow. I did Jenny Craig, and Medifast.  If you want to learn more call the toll free number 1-877-587-4647 or check out the website.  This was the first time I ever did a cleanse, it was easy and I feel better.

a3b8333cbb384f9455df98942d25b65faa	Scrub with Strawberries. One member of the berry family, the strawberry, contains an enzyme (malic acid) that actually whitens your teeth. Mash a large strawberry and then rub it on your teeth with your finger for about a minute. Rinse, and then floss to remove seeds.<br>  <br>  Note: If your teeth appear to be an abnormal color without ready explanation, the abnormal tooth color lasts despite following good oral hygiene practices, and if other symptoms are also present, make an appointment to see your dentist.|`|7355ad702ae490769df9563b4fb4bed6aa	Hydrogen peroxide|`|4rCsSXCDaa	A tooth brush,|`|HqpZOxEZaa	i would try those aquafresh white trays. they really work. my teeth are supa white! :)|`|YmqDqro2aa	Use Crest tooth paste and any ordinary tooth brush...also if you want brihter teeth use crest whitening strips.|`|omaScJBXaa	It depends on how white you want to get them. Brushing with a whitening toothpaste will whiten them a little bit - but most whitening toothpastes only scrub away at surface stains. So you're essentially just buffing your enamel to make it look whiter. <br>  <br>  The best way to whiten is to use a product that has hydrogen peroxide in it. The hydrogen peroxide penetrates into your teeth and dissolves the organic material in your teeth that is causing the staining. Using hydrogen peroxide is completely safe and it's really effective. (Don't just swish around hydrogen peroxide in your mouth though - you could swallow it (it's toxic!) or you could burn your mouth if you use too high of a percentage.)<br>  <br>  Some recommendations from my own experience (I work in a dental clinic):<br>  <br>  In-office power whitening: These treatments are usually 30 minutes and use a high concentration of hydrogen peroxide. You have to do this at a dental office - so the price is a little high (we charge $450 for the treatment). But the results are instant and you're in and out in 45 minutes tops. My personal favorite and the one we use in our clinic is Beyond - they're a really new company, but their products are outstanding.<br>  <br>  Take-home whitening: These treatments use a lower concentration of hydrogen peroxide so you can do it yourself at home. And they're cheaper - so if you're on a budget, these are a good option for you to consider. You have two options here - whitening trays or the newer LED technology. Whitening trays are made by your dentist and are formed to fit your teeth. You then wear these at night or during the day for several weeks. The better option (at least in my opinion because I personally hate the idea of having to wear whitening trays for days on end) is the newer LED units. The best one that we've tried out so far is the e-Bright Tooth Whitening Accelerator Home Edition. You only have to use it for three, 20 minute sessions to get the same results that you would see after two weeks with the take-home tray system.<br>  <br>  Personally, I wouldn't recommend using any fruit like someone else has suggested. There have been studies done that show that using any kind of acidic fruit will erode your tooth enamel. You'd be better off just using toothpaste.<br>  <br>  Do your research! You want to be safe and not harm your teeth - you only get one set!

Well...generally...I doubt it will cause toxication unless in large dosage. And, also depends on what supplement is taht. If they are water soluble than there should not be any problem. But as for vitamins like iron, vitamin E, etc. then it may become toxic if overdose but that also depends on to what extent is the overdosage. However, if you are worried, then the best would be to consult a doctor bringing the supplement there to show him/her. From there you will know whether it's ok or not. Your doctor will be able to help you prevent possible complications if it is found to be toxic due to overdose or otherwise at least you will a peace of kind knowing that nothing will happen. <br>  Just a little sharing...

AA12081817	I have lost a total of 120 pounds so far.<br>  I lost 105 pounds in my first 6 months.  Here is how I did it.<br>  1. Every morning get up and walk for 45 minutes.  You can start with less time, but you want to get up to 45 minutes, and it must be fast walk. You want your heart rate to go up.  It must be in the morning, it kick starts your metabolism.<br>  2. I cut out Red Meat, and fatty foods.  Boneless skinnless chicken breast, baked, or grilled, rice and vegetables (steamed).<br>  3. Eat half.  Just eat half of what you normally eat.  Put 1/2 on your plate, and put the rest away.  Cook less.  When you go to fast food, get salads only.  Or grilled chicken.  No fries,  only diet soda. Or water.<br>  <br>  It will work, once you get into a routine, you will get hooked on the results, and you will keep the routine.  It has been over a year for me.  <br>  <br>  Also start counting your calories.  Write them down.  You would be amazed as to how much more aware you are of your caloric intake, if you actually write it down.  We recently discovered a site that offers a great program that counts calories, as well as keeps track of everything.  It allows multiple users, so everyone in the family can keep track.  They offer a free 7 day trial, and so far I am very impressed with the product.  Try the 7 days and see.  It allows you to add the exercise that you do during the day, which increases the amount of calories you can take in.

1b41331da1c77e849a5352b56d9e3f4eaa	Losing love Handles<br>  By know all of us know what are love handles. Love handles are created because of the extra fat build up in the body. Now we have to find out how to lose love handles.<br>  If you really want to get rid of love handles, you should understand that there is no magical cure for love handles. The only solution is by the use of healthy diet and using regular exercise programs. I will never recommend you to go for any kind of pills for gets rid of love handles.<br>  <br>  So here I am listing some of the best ways to get rid of love handles:<br>  <br>  <br>  · Healthy diet<br>  Going on a healthy diet can be really helpful in getting rid of love handles. You can go for low carb diets and low calorie diet. While using these diets, you have to some of your favorite stuff like sweets. Your diet should include proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals required for body to function properly.<br>  <br>  <br>  · Cut the salt<br>  The amount of too much salt in your diet is responsible for around 80% of love handles. High amount of sodium in your body will direct to "water retention," which makes love handles more prominent. So reduce the amount of salt in all kind of food you use.<br>  <br>  <br>  · Cardio Training<br>  The key to having great abs is burning more calories than you take in. Aerobic training combined with the tips above does just that. If you want to get rid of love handles then get up off the couch and go for a walk, take a bike ride, or play some hoops. Find something you like to do and keep doing it.|`|7ba3c343bc74708a2ba9da790b6274a5aa	I weighed about 150 lbs a month and a half ago and now im down to about 141.

Congrats on trying to be healthy without starving yourself! There need to be more people like us in this world!|`|AA11211125	Well if you want to be healthy the most important thing to do is get 7-8 hours of sleep in a regular pattern each night.  Many people don't realize that this is the foundation of good health.  Next is nutrition.  This is where you lose your love handles through a high fiber diet which also follows along the guidelines of the nutritional pyramid.  Also, try to give yourself 2-3 hours before bed without eating (or something small like a piece of fruit).  Finally, exercise... this, contrary to popular belief, will not help you lose your love handles.<br>  <br>  Let me repeat that for anyone who happens to be reading this...  YOU CANNOT LOSE WEIGHT JUST BY EXERCISING.  Exercising is excellent for good health, especially the heart, BUT IT WILL NOT HELP YOU LOSE WEIGHT UNLESS YOU ARE EATING A BALANCED DIET.<br>  <br>  <br>  I agree with the response above, if all we're talking about is losing weight.  However, I believe the quesion included the premise that the person wanted to be healthy.  If someone eats junk all day there is NO WAY they are in "top condition".  There is a big difference between looking fit and being fit.<br>  <br>  We can't just eat anything we want and then go to the gym and "burn it off".  If one is going exercise then the proper nutrition is needed to supplement it.  Our body uses COMPLEX carbohydrates as the primary energy source during exercise.  That doesn't mean that any old carboydrate is good to consume before exercising.  Simple carbs digest too quickly and refined carbs (like candy and soda) lead to lower blood sugar after insulin is secreted.  Complex carbohydrates are most efficient in preserving glycogen stores and make it possible to burn body fat.  If a person is eating the wrong kinds of foods, like the above posters brother, when going to workout the person will be using their body's protein stores as a form of energy which is extremely inefficient and will lead to a breakdown in lean muscle mass.<br>  <br>  So, NO, I AM NOT BEING OVERLY DRAMATIC, we can't just eat anything we want, go to the gym, and expect to be in good health.|`|TfxGL1luaa	There are a few good ways to get rid of those love handles.<br>  <br>  You can do side crunches, lay on your left side and crunch up toward the ceiling.  You can also stand (or sit on an excercise ball) with 5 pound weights in each hand, twist from side to side.  You can also do cross over crunches.  Crunch up and touch your left knee with your right elbow and switch.  Get an 8 minute ab workout to help with this.  Running also helps tone all over.  Most people think of it as a leg workout, but all that impact and movement uses alot of your abs, too.  Most importantly, make sure you get your heart rate up.<br>  <br>  As for losing weight fast, I wouldn't suggest that.  Losing weight quickly is not an effective way to keep weight off.  Typically, the faster you lose it, the faster you'll put it back on.  Concentrate on the big picture.  You want to look good and still be able to enjoy food.  The best way to do that is to eat small meals all day long.  My daily food intake is 1000-1200/day.  this is typically what I eat.<br>  <br>  1 cup of coffee with 2 T. of non-fat creamer.<br>  .5 c. of low fat cottage cheese for breakfast<br>  <br>  Around noon, I eat a fruit.  either a half a grapefruit or a cup of grapes.<br>  <br>  For lunch I pack in all the veggies I can.  Spinach, tomatos, onion, green pepper, green beans with a low fat dressing.<br>  <br>  Then I eat another 2 oz. snack at around 3pm.  It's usually something high in fiber.  Black beans mixed with celery, green pepper, tomatoes, corn.  It's a great little mixture.  <br>  <br>  Then I work out for an hour when I get home.  Either running, weights, or with a tape.  As long as I get my heart rate up for 1 hour, I'm good.<br>  <br>  For dinner, I first drink 8oz of skim milk 15 minutes before eating.  Skim milk helps lose weight in 2 ways.  First, it fills you up so you don't over eat when eating dinner.  Second, it has an enzyme in it that makes your body think it's full and thus, preventing you from over eating again!  Then I load up on the protein.  My favorite thing to eat is grilled chicken in a romaine leaf.  It's a lettuce wrap and it's delicious.  Make sure you eat slowly.  It takes your stomach about 20 minutes to recognize it's full (this is why I drink the milk 15 minutes prior to dinner).<br>  <br>  Drink LOTS of water throughout the day!<br>   <br>  This diet keeps me full all day long.  I'm never hungry and you should never allow yourself to get too hungry.  That's how you can over eat.<br>  <br>  The guy below is being a bit dramatic.  Yes, overall health is a balance of good diet and exercise, but you CAN lose weight by working out and not eating the best foods.  It's plain and simple math, burn more calories than calories consumed, you WILL lose weight.  So yes, someone COULD eat McDonald's all day (yuck) and work out alot and still lose weight, although I wouldn't suggest it.  My teeage brother is in top shape but eats like a teenager (junk).  So do all his athlete friends.  They burn all the fat and calories at the gym and they all are in GREAT condition.

I don't know who told you that. You should keep them trimmed neatly so they don't protrude beyond the toe and clean. Some people's nails grow faster than others, but I would think twice a week for cutting  might be too  much. If you cut them too much the pressure of your shoes might cause the big toe  nails to become  ingrown, which means the corners  of the nails start to  protrude into the skin on the corners and will  grow inwards causing you lots of trouble later on. Let them grow beyond the skin line in the corners and always trim them straight across never rounded. Good  luck and don't pay any attention to the person who told you  about cutting them according to your height.
QTUPvRq0aa	Hi WandaD! Good for you for weighing yourself first thing in the morning. That's the best time. I would continue doing that everytime you weigh yourself to eliminate as many error causing variables as you can. <br>  I would be a bit cautious with the accuracy of the scale. 4-5 lbs are some large variations in weight in such a small amount of time.<br>  Also, I would be sure that the scale is placed on a hard surface (like tile) rather than on carpet. If it's on carpet when you weigh yourself, the scale won't read accurately and can potentially give you errors (like the ones you're getting).<br>  If you've been weighing yourself on a hard surface, I would take the scale back and exchange it for another one. A scaled giving such large variations in measurement shouldn't be used, and the store that sold you the scale should be happy to give you an exchange.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  Justin Brink<br>  B.S. Kinesiology, CPT<br>  <a href="http://www.acclaimedfitness.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.acclaimedfitness.com</a>|`|cc35735cbf0dba61bdbc142d991ab28baa	i think your obsessed with weighing yourself...... why are you getting on the scale 5 minutes apart????? thats crazy... i wouldn't worry about it too much....maybe just say your somewhere in the middle of those numbers???? don't sweat the small stuff my friend.....
AA12329430	I think it's easier to heat up, simply because you have more options to do it. For example...if it's hot you would have to remove clothing to cool off. Eventually you will be naked, and probably still hot. If it's cold...you can continue to layer clothing and use blankets and cuddle, etc. So, about your hot-blooded problem....maybe you just need to take more cold showers.|`|14f53352fc04cbea0f998cc9a2f760b5aa	heating up is easy you just move around get fustrated or exercise|`|AA11604508	There is no difference in the facility of your body temperature.

NyMs320Yaa	I have a female friend who had stomach stapling which resulted in her hair getting really thin: the drop in protein her body was receiving made her hair fall out.  She tried rogaine for women, but it didn't have too much of an effect because it couldn't counterbalance the surgery she had.  The thing that made the most difference and improved the appearance of her hair the most was a change in her hairstyle.  She had always worn her hair below her shoulders and when it started to thin it was very noticeable.  After a significant amount of hair loss she cut her hair so that it just nicely framed and shaped her head.  The difference was remarkable.  If you wear your hair longer, you might try a shorter cut, or even shave it.  For men, the "bald" look is considered very sexy, particularly matched with some facial hair.|`|AA10104805	what's the big deal about thinning hair?|`|dE9NLOGnaa	If you are losing hair the only product My husband uses is Just For Men and that product helps you regrow hair where you have lost it.|`|26EFlW6Faa	Yes I have a salon..The only product that I carry is called DHT SENSOR...It neutralized the dy-Hydro_testostarone that causes your hair to fall out and not grow back...I have very thin fine hair and I use it, and It works..|`|nRg7Rl7Daa	The reason I like prescription medicine is that because it needs to be proven, and propecia has been proven. Its prescription, its expensive, and it slows down hair loss. It doesnt work for everyone, but for many people it does. You can also try rogain, its over the counter and its been proven, but also doesnt work for everyone.<br>  <br>  Another thing is, these take time to work, and it takes even longer to see results. So dont expect anything overnight, if you "see" a change, its all in your head. Truth is, that its going to be around 6 months to notice anything.

Just try to rest, drink plenty of fluids and let your body take care of it.|`|08decfc03cc2d3621212f615e16e290eaa	just take some natural herbs/spices such as ginger.add hot water and drink as a tea.ull never get colds or allergies again.|`|f62e65d47f0d80f6e084736b3421d45aaa	There is this very old saying in medicine:  the average cold lasts for about a week, with medical treatment it can be shortened to seven days.   Sorry, but there are no quick remedies for the common cold.  The best things to do are to stay well hydrated, rest, and take over the counter medications to counter specific symptoms.  Drink as much water as you can...normally you should be drinking eight 8oz glasses of water a day, double it.  This will increase your body's ability to fight off the infection and will liquify your secretions so that they are less likely to clog up inside of you.  Rest a bit, but don't just lounge around.  Get up, go for short walks, do some stuff...but don't exert yourself.  If you lie in bed all of the time you are more likely to develop bronchitis and pneumonia.  Take over the counter medications for cough, runny nose, aches and pains, congestion, etc.  Take these regularly, just as prescribed.  Personally, I avoid taking to many combination drugs (like Tylenol sinus and Actifed) because a lot of them contain the same active drugs, and I would rather not take too much of any one.  Also, I stick with generics generally, it is the same medication, is just as effective, and is much cheaper.  Whatever you take, make sure that you stick with it.  I work in an ER and see people daily coming in with "colds" complaining that decongestants and such are not working...only to find out that they last took a dose of the med a day or more before.       If you have any questions or concerns please consult your doctor. Keep in mind that if you have a preexisiting condition you will have to consider it.  For example, if you have been put on a fluid restriction, you will have to follow it stil.  Also, some over the counter medications may interact with other medications that you are already taking, and many (not all) decongestants and other cold remedies may elevate your blood pressure.  Good luck.|`|AA10671142	chicken soup, rest and liquids|`|AA11850523	Zicam  Zinc Lozenges  Extra Vit C  home made chicken soup|`|ee1c0c1d4321045630054dc29dc543a6aa	I like to combine tylenol/advil cold with mucinex to clear it out faster.

9fa62ef3515e55e8fa1dc9050016a100aa	I know it's a pain and sometimes hard to remember to take the pill every day, but after this shot wears off in a couple of months, I would recommend switching over.     I was on Depo for about a year & a half, and while the symptoms didn't kick in right away (I think I really started having problems after the second or third shot), I had the depression, weight gain, fatigue...it sucked.  But it was convenient, and I wasn't sure if it was the Depo causing the problem (this was when it was relatively new...) or if it was something else.  So it took me a while to make the decision to switch.    So I finally stopped getting the shot, and switched over to the pill, and it's solved all the problems I was having.    You should probably also have your thyroid tested, though if you stop the Depo and the symptoms go away, you won't need to.     Good luck!|`|6132fc71a44641419e91331108688834aa	I was really young when I got pregnant with my 1st son. (14yrs) I had him when I was 15! Depo was the next step. From age 15 to 22, I was on depo. 7 years!!  Of HELL!! and Still counting!! From the time I was on it I had either NO period, or it was so heavy I couldnt stand up. I gained weight like crazy. My hips, back, breast, lower tummy, hurt all the time. After about 2 years of being on it, my period was gone! Around that time, I really started putting on the pounds! I lost interest in sex all together, I had alot of discharge. My mood was changing by the minute. For the next 5 years, it just got worse!! At 20, I had cycsts all the time. My uteris was enlarged, pap test was coming back, adnormal. Then I was that I couldn't have any more kids, so I just came off of it. They say it takes about 3 months after your shot is due, for it to get out of your system. That's not so true, A month later, I was pregnant with the child I was told I couldn't have. After I had my baby, I choose to try depo again. The side effects were still the same. I'm 26 now, I still cant lose weight. My period is Still not right. I still have sex problems. I got my tubes tied in may 2005, thinking that would help my body to heal. It's been a year since that, I have so many female problems now, that was caused by depo. Honey, if you can find another kind of birth control DO IT!!! NOW!!! because the after math is even worse. As for you gaining weight. It could be THYRIOD disease.I've learned to never put it past depo, beingthe cause of something wrong. And yes depression is also a big thing!! That like's to stay around too.

AA11215103	Yes, I love it when a guy stares at my body when I am naked and about to have sex with him!     Otherwise, I would rather a guy admire my body without being too obvious about it.  I have large breasts so I am used to guys staring at them, but I think the men I have a conversation with already know that staring at my breasts while talking to me is awkward. My brain is figuratively "bigger" than my boobs.    The women with the implants want their breasts to be noticed, so in my opinion they shouldn't complain--mine are natural, and I got them at 14, and I have over 20 years experience of male staring, so it doesn't bother me anymore.    What irritates me the most--is the car honks, that startles me, that's worse than the whistles, and woos, and "whoa look at those t*ts!", "you have very big breasteseses"  and grunts that I have heard. All of that "woo" crap makes me laugh, and doesn't really bother me that much.    As long as men make a sincere effort to look at my face, I am fine with the boob staring.  Women also stare at my boobs, that's how big they are. Maybe they are wondering if they are real, or they probably wonder why I don't get a breast reduction, who knows or cares.     As far as my butt is concerned, well I don't wear very tight pants, or thong bikinis due to fashion taste, however if a guy stares at my butt, I won't see him do it.  My puss----well no one sees that unless I want that person to see it, no camel toe--ever--over here.|`|AA10991881	It's ok.

Here's the thing.  I don't mind so much when guys look at me, really I don't.  But when a guy talks, and he's looking below my face, or when he stares only at my butt in an obvious way like I'm a piece of meat, or when guys like what they see, so they think they can catcall or "hollah" or shout nasty things at me, it pisses me off.  I know I look good, but I'm more than that, and just because I look good is no reason to disrespect me.|`|AA12321692	Not at all. In my case,  It actually makes me feel like a piece of meat...Down here where I live, guys not only stare, they make a weird sound, kind of like when you eat something really spicy and it burns your mouth...Watch, try making that sound...   See? It makes me feel so uncomfortable... So as advice to you, don't make girls feel uncomfortable...    What I love is when a guy walks up to a girl and tells them a nice remark like " I could get lost in those pretty eyes" or the kind of lines that flatter a girl without making her feel offended or compromised to follow up on the comment...

Very happy with the results!! Still to this day. However, they will offer you a prescription for a numbing cream TAKE IT. It's just a lotion you put on about 1 hour prior to treatment, I didn't & it hurt like needles in my skin and afterwards my skin was on fire, used lots of ice packs.....but it was worth it not to have to shave ever again. (RESULTS VARY FROM PERSON TO PERSON) Make sure the technician knows what he/she is doing because if you get someone who passed a class and it not an esthetician or dermatology trained you can end up with some really bad scarring. BE AWARE & RESEARCH.|`|afd55636bf2fc29fa738a5a2d58ac619aa	Yes it does work, but for some people the hair grows back anyway.  I think it is less painfull than waxing, although if you have darker and courser hair, they have to use a higher laser setting, and the more intense the laser, the more it stings. Also, the thicker and darker the hair, the more treatments you will require to rid the hair. And you can only shave the afflicted area during treatment, no waxing or epilating.  The laser is slowing killing the hair root and if you pull the root out, a new hair will just start to grow, thus defeating the purpose of laser.   It's also very expensive.  But other than that...it's great!|`|e6326d9cd2bfa7bb4052cb870b4e2465aa	I havent but my aunt has had it and she said tha tit hurt for a little while but then the pain goes a wa and she loves it.  she also said that it was verly x-pensive

jVa0vlnYaa	If you have been raped, I am sorry for what happened to you.  Above all else, remember that it wasn't your fault.  I want you to know that things will get better.  Hang in there.<br>  <br>  If the assault happened recently, please check out this link for helpful suggestions:  <a href="http://www.pandys.org/ifyouhavejustbeenraped.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pandys.org/ifyouhavejustbeenr...</a><br>  <br>  I disagree with people who've said that you must tell your parents.  I've been working with rape victims for ten years, and sometimes telling parents is a great choice and sometimes it's a terrible choice.  Sometimes parents are supportive and kind, sometimes they are cruel.  Only you best know your parents.  If you can rely on them, do consider sharing with them so you can get their support and not have to deal with this in silence.  I know that being a victim of rape can be embarassing and you might feel ashamed and you might never want your parents to know.  I didn't.  I eventually told them and it worked out fine, but I was really scared and I understand what you're going through.  Remember that you can also reach out to your friends for support.  You don't have to be all alone in this.  When I wanted to tell a friend but didn't know how, sometimes I would write them an email or letter to break the ice. <br>  <br>  If you want truly anonymous help and you live in the US, check out RAINN - <a href="http://www.rainn.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.rainn.org</a><br>  They have a free hotline you can call and also an online hotline during certain hours of the day.

They may also come to the hospital to be there with you during your exam.<br>  <br>  Its really important for YOU to get looked at. I know that being touched or having to talk about it is very difficult, but you will find comfort in doing whatever you can to nail the person who did this to you. <br>  <br>  I hope you do get looked at and I hope you can find someone you trust to talk to.

It was a sexual assault by her boyfriends stepfather. As close as we are, she never told us. I still cannot believe it. This man did this to several girls and rumors started going around her school. We found out because the police came to our house to ask her questions. She denied everything. Within an hour, something told me she was lying. I walked into her bedroom and she was crying. She finally told me the truth. She felt like maybe she asked for it or something. We had the guy arrested and we are still waiting for trial. If you can't tell your parents, tell another adult that you trust. Someone has to know. We found another vicitim of this idiot and she was also scared to tell her parents. I went to her house and sat down with them to tell them what happened. There are so many kids that are afraid to tell. I don't understand that. It makes me sad. Please find someone, an aunt, teacher, friends mother. Man or woman it doesnt matter. Have them go with you to tell your parents if that makes you feel better. It's not your fault no matter what.

Things like bruising and swelling are unreliable as to extent of injury. Sometimes a ligament injury is more severe than a mild fracture.

67c2e364f67b92b3f2b531a97c03312caa	I would firmly suggest that you go to JCPenney and have one of the fitting experts in the lingerie department help you pick the right bra for you. There are other stores that will do the same, but Penney's is the least expensive and has a great assortment.     My breasts are the same size as yours and I understand how you feel. The most important thing is to find the style that lifts your breasts and with wide padded straps that take the pressure off your shoulders. They will be very happy to fit you properly at Penney's or Macy's.      BTW, there are also custom undergarment shops that will make you a bathing suit that will give you the support you want and make you feel less self-conscious about your body. You might want to check them out and put that on your Christmas wish list. The suits are a little expensive, but they really are worth it.      And FWIW, the guys aren't turned off by your breasts at all. It's just the fact that they're paying attention to them at all that makes it uncomfortable. In 10 years you'll understand that it's a good thing and that you can be comfortable in your own body.|`|39f577cd3b2bd9185999b5c2c3898078aa	Um, a push up bra? or maybe breast reduction surgery or soemthing along those lines.|`|AA11732315	if you dont have a lot of money to spend i like the bras at target aim for one with push up pads.

I may seem a bit embarrassing, but it will be well worth your while to go.    Oprah did a show about how some significant number of women do not have the correct bra size.    The fitters should also be able to help you find a swim suit that flatters your figure and gives you the support you need.    I would suggest that you consider talking to your physician. I have two friends who have had breast reduction surgery and they are very pleased with their results. This is a procedure you might want to consider when you are a little older. And, if you have health issues because of your size the procedure may be covered by your insurance.    best,    cez|`|AA11107363	Now, I have small breasts, so this is not from personal experience, but I have a friend who has something like 36DDD, and the only bras she buys are Olga brand bras, because she said they were the most supporting, and they had a lot of "lift".  They also are very pretty, I've seen that for myself, so try that brand next time you buy a bra!    I know a lot of people are pushing reduction surgery, and if you have back problems, you might want to look into it, but if you are self-conscious without physiological difficulties, than I urge you not to do it.  Any surgery on your breast can cause loss of feeling in nipples and breast tissue, making your breasts numb, and ensuring that you won't be able to get sexual pleasure from them when you do find a boyfriend.  (that's why I, with 32A breasts, am avoiding breast enlargement surgery!)  I hope that instead of going to extreme measures, you will be able to begin to love your breasts and your body for what it is!  Large breasts are not cute and perky like Cameron Diaz's, but they are shapely and beautiful like Scarlett Johansen's.  Just think of yourself as extra-womanly! Talk to your friends or your Mom (if you're close to her)about how you feel about your breasts and your body, and try your hardest to love them and think positive things about them.  It's important to make the effort to love your body in today's world where women are supposed to always be exchanging their natural features for something "better", and I hope you'll be able to gain confidence in what you look like naturally!  (As an added bonus, to address your fears that men won't like them, as someone who has been unceremoniously dumped for a woman with big boobs, I can assure you men will not have an issue youth your large breasts.)  Good luck!|`|AA11334210	well first of all your probably not a 38D, i thought i wore a 38D and then i saw oprah's amazing show on how to find the right bra....appearently i wear a 32 DD....this all comes from oprah.com    All women lose firmness as they get olderso do their bras. "When you buy a bra," Susan says, "make sure it fits you in the loosest hook. That way you can tighten the bra to the second and third hook as the bra ages and retain the firmness and the lift."      Where to Wear Your Bra    According to Susan, the perfect position for your breasts is midway between your shoulders and your elbows. And your bra should be level front to back. Susan says most women wear their bra bands too high on their torsos and throw their measurements off. "Most women," Susan says, "keep going up in the back [increasing their band size] instead of getting a deeper cup. We want to keep the back lean and small so we can lift the bust. [The bra band is] like a bridge, if it's properly planted at the base, it can lift."    Susan says there are obvious clues your bra is the wrong size:        If your cups runneth over, it's time to go up a cup size.    If your cups dimple, it's time to go down a cup size.    If you have the dreaded back fat, you probably think your bra is too tight, but you're wrongyour bra is too big. Wearing the bra lower on your back with a smaller band size will completely eliminate the back fat.    If your strap falls down, that means your bra band is riding up and you probably need to go down a band size.     its a REALLY easy concept, try this before you try anything drastic. trust me, boys just like boobs in general. my boobs are droopy too and my boyfriend LOVES them! no worries :)|`|a83cb3675981dd77d61d3776861a8302aa	i'm 15 and going through the same thing. i refuse to wear a swimsuit and have never slept through the night without a bra.     i wear a 36DD and am going for a consultation for breast reduction surgery next week. think about whether surgery is right for you or if you just need a better bra. if deemed medically necessary, insurance will cover most of the expenses for surgery. if you never stop grwing like my mom did, you could end up paying for expensive custom bras and suffer from intense back pain. whatever you decide to do, think about your health, future and your future children.

Then one day i was doing my daily cleaning ritual after breakfast and she asked if we could go to the park and have ice cream.  I told her when I was through cleaning and she said never mind well never get to go.  I put my mop down and got a hold of myself and realized I wasn't enjoying my child.

But my biggest obsession was with his toys.

Eventually I sought help as a friend discovered what I was doing.  I am not cured but I have moved my obsessions to something less harmful. I now clean the fridge every night and sort out the cupboards but I leave the toys alone!

You really need to wait a few months or more before you swap to metal brackets because of the fact that you just got braces & the cement holding the brackets on is to new.  The cement will eventually break down given some time.......so be patient & drink alot of Coca-cola  ; )  HINT: the acid in Coca-cola breaks the cement down quicker. That's why the dentist say "do not drink sodas!"  On a personal note, I think you will be happier with the metal brackets on top anyway considering that the clear brackets tend to turn yellow over a period of time which looks real ridiculous.|`|ef433c0c7fa10640ccfa34d15d5261d0aa	It's possible but you may get charged for it.|`|AA11626547	You probably can get it done, but it will cost more money.|`|AA11405229	Just went to the dentist with somebody that needs braces.

Why did you get half and half anyway?|`|e7dad42b55fb7942effec3883a6799b3aa	Well, ask your orthodontist to change them.  I don't know about clear, mine were metal, and I had to have them switched around because they were put on crooked.  It will most likely cost a LOT of money though.|`|AA11723482	You can ask your dentist that put them on and I am sure that he/she would be glad to change them.

Best exercises for pectoral muscles are push-ups, bench presses, and dumbbell flys.  You need to work the other muscle groups as well though.  If you're not doing strength training right now, you should start by doing strength training every other day.  To accelerate the process, you need to get your diet in order.

Get a skipping rope or something and do some serious aerobic exercise.  It sounds really stupid I know but if you need to feel pain please try to inflict it another way, like eg exercise.  It does something to your brain, releases feel-good chemicals which might ease what you're feeling a bit.  One thing I normally use when I feel that way is I go to wax my legs or something.  I actually find that more painful than anything else.  And that way you're keeping away from anything dodgy.  Get out of the house if you can do you have anyone else you can go to and even stay over without telling them why? Anything you can to stop yourself from thinking this stuff.  I went through a few years of being that way.  I've just come out of it and feel like one of the strongest people in the world.  Things are getting back on track slowly.  It takes a lot of hard work and effort, but honestly trust me it's soooo worth it in the end.  In a few years you'll be in a completely different situation and look back in horror that you used to think those things.  You'll have found happiness, probably in the small things that other people take for granted everyday, but because of where you've been the happiness you get from these small everyday things will be so intense and you will be so grateful you stuck it out.

Let the knowledge of that caring and love give you strength to face your current problems and determination to build a new and happier future.  I wish you well.

y4SUDnpaaa	I used to take Seroquel and I believe it now comes in a generic form, maybe they will cover that. My daughter is in the same position you are and gets her health care and meds from a government funded facility. It happens a lot to her that drugs the doctor prescribed are not covered so she has to go back to the doctor and they prescribe the closet drug to the one prescribed.....Lexapro was one not covered. The substitute they gave her (can't remember the name) worked very well for her. It is a good idea that you've asked your doctor for samples. At one time my own meds added  up to $970 a month and the prescribing doctor supplied me with samples for the most expensive which saved me $670. I asked every doctor I went to, no matter their specialty, for samples and they often had them and gave them to me. Most pharmaceutical companies have a program  for low income or indigent people and will supply the drugs free of charge. Just look up the pharmaceutical company on the internet and you will find the information you need.  Good luck. Hang in there until Monday.
AA11788494	Yes it is the hospital's fault.  They should have asked what insurance you have or they could have looked it up since they charged you.    This happens a lot.  Doctors don't really care most of the time.  The best thing to do is to call the doctor's office.  Someone should be on call.|`|3iBsBtn9aa	they probably cover the generic.|`|okiJdlheaa	I loved Seroquel, but It made me gain too much weight. I miss it though.

TPP0p13faa	ok first off you need to open up to someone like you said you needed to type this.  this means that you want someone to hear you. you need to stop cutting by all means necessary its going to be hard but cutting is not the answer. get a hobby or a journal. write your feelings down don't keep them bottled up that's the worst thing you can do.  you can always email or IM me wen ever you need to talk =)|`|f89b5d7a38dec22f6966866a8ce0af7faa	you do seem to be more mature than most 15 year olds just by the way you wrote this.    saying you needed to type this makes me want to tell you to start a journal right away. this well help you to get your feelings out, sort through your thoughts and remember feelings you've had (when you feel bad it can help you remember good times so you don't feel hopeless). i kept an online journal (livejournal.com) for a few years and it really helped me, especially when i felt alone.    another thing i'd like to share with you, you say people see you as the 'popular ditz'. you also said you don't really care for the majority of friends you have. i would not worry about all of those people and the way they see you. you should live your life for yourself. you're still young, you should investigate your interests (or possible interests) and join a club or sports team at your school. there you can gain an activity that you enjoy and identify with other people who also enjoy that. because you'll share common ground it may be easier to find people you actually care for as friends as well.    but also - i talk to about 4 people i went to high school with (i'm now in college). so don't worry about it so much. just enjoy your life and do what you want to do. don't lay on the ground staring at the ceiling, do something, exercise.
mZlcmbDtaa	been there done that!  put some Vaseline on your lips and 1% Hydrocortisone cream on the rash (you can buy it at any drug store on the shelf). try to avoid putting makeup on it or using harsh products on your face this week. mine wasn't to bad and cleared up the next day. i would guess you should be fine by this weekend. best of luck!

You have brush burns. I'd put cold cloths on it. If you wear makeup it might bother it but take it right off when you go home. It's going to be red for awhile. I wouldn't put anything on it.  Good luck.|`|6HBlHO8Faa	gurl i know how ya feel..i've been through the same situation except it was on my lips...what i usually do is put carmex to relieve some of the rash but in your case since its ur chin...dont put makeup because you want it to heal faster and it might cause more irriation. Try baby poweder or vaseline around the areas that are affected...that will also relieve it from feeling itchy and raw..

You must be devastated.     I think that if your husband has any heart at all, expressing your honest feelings about how hurt you feel should be enough to make him feel bad, without having to do anything extra. I mean purposely trying to make him feel bad would be almost like game playing. Also, "punishing" him is not going to help you get to the bottom of WHY he cheated...it's only going to make him feel worse and worse and if he does it again he will hide it better.     Just be honest and expect the same from him. Tell him that when you got married, you expected him to be faithful, and if he can't do that then you have to rethink the marriage. Maybe he's too young, maybe he wanted to date around more? I mean, was this just a one-time horrible mistake or is it a symptom that he is just not really fully committed to your marriage? I would try to find that out.     But don't end it unless you're sure it can't work. A lot of marriages go through rough spots and things could work out.|`|qMu6Tdrhaa	Aww I'm soo sorry!

kTxYJQPoaa	You should adopt an egoistic view to deal with this. If you think that you will be happier dead, then kill yourself. However, if you think you have a chance to turn it around, you should give life another go.    If I were in your shoes, I would try and find WHY you're failing at everything in your life.

Gfu1Nm0Gaa	As a smoker of 4 packs a day who quit cold turkey, I can honestly tell you it is not low will power, it is an addiction and very hard to quit. I quit 17 times before I finally 'stopped' smoking after 25 year addiction.  Your Mom will not die from quitting, but she will die from continuing. She may feel like she will die the first few days, but as the days go by it gets easier.  Tell her to drink gallons of water - just water, not coffee, tea or soda, just plain clear water.  The front of your brain that controls your need for nicotine is full of water and needs to be constantly cleansed when you quit smoking.  It helps a great deal - also have handy some celery sticks, carrot sticks, cheese sticks - anything that feels like a cigarette in her hand. Part of the addiction is the opening of the cigarette pack, pulling out of the cigarette, lighting and hold the cig in your hand - these items like celery etc., replace that need for something in the hand.  I also used a pencil which I carried everywhere and once I even found myself ready to put it in my mouth (yuck) like a cigarette.  Keep your mom occupied, too, talk to her, play cards, or checkers or go for a walk (be sure to take along a bottle of water for her to constantly sip on the first few days).  Good luck to you and your Mom - also be prepared for her to be snappy as she overcomes this addiction, you will need patience - just as she does.|`|ehBPus3Zaa	I don't think she will die of the withdrawal symptoms, but she may think she is! Her body is used to the nicotine and when you stop, the body will react to not having it.|`|6ELSwKKvaa	One is not likely to die from Cigarette withdrawal but it can make you wish you were dead. Emotionally she is likely to have fits of anger, depression and other emotional outburst that she does not mean. She just will not be able to help herself. I have also experienced shakiness when quitting. Nothing feels right and all you want to do is feel normal again. You feel like you will NEVER feel normal again. She may sleep more than normal or she might not be able to sleep when she wants to.      It is NOT low will power. Cigarettes are harder to quit than most other addictive drugs and has been ranked up there with Heroine as far as addictive nature. I quit doing drugs and drinking and let me tell you, quitting cigarettes has proven to be a much harder task than any of them. The physical aspects of withdrawal will most likely be gone in 3 days if she doesn't smoke at all but the mental aspect and urges can last much longer. I know of at least 2 ex-smokers who still have urges after years of having been quit.     Be patient with her, it is not low will power. It is one of the most difficult things your mother will ever do.|`|ESwPIkfkaa	no you cant die|`|dMcpULcdaa	no your mother cant die from nicotine withdrawl. When quitting smoking the physical withdrawl can last for a week or two, after that its all mental.  I assure you having your mother quit cold turkey will be ok, but make sure she has plenty of exercises to keep her busy and her mind off of smoking|`|onbwN4csaa	No but the hardest is the first 3 weeks.  To me it's only way to quite is cold turkey.  Don't have that first one in the morning.|`|pUvEmPrCaa	Cigarette withdrawal does not kill you.  It can give you very serious symptoms that make you feel like you're going to die, but it cannot kill you.  Trying to quit cold turkey is very hard.  It doesn't have to do with a low amount of will power.      She should try nicotine gum or patches and start weening off of them slowly like that.  They even make some medicines that you can take to help decrease the withdrawal symptoms.|`|y43XQwUuaa	You can't DIE. It can make you depressed, which may give you suicidal thoughts. But it won't kill you.    Better yet, how about you just call Loveline and ask? Dr. Drew probably knows more about the topic than I do ;D|`|iHMu4Jtoaa	It is horrible...complaining is not the answer. She needs to talk to her doctor, she needs a support system.     No she can not die from lack of cigarettes.|`|eda699c69fc8eaff0f10239e82b318d9aa	No. She should seek outside help to stop quitting though. Nicotine addiction can be serious and I doubt after 30 years she could just quit cold turkey.|`|0hRTaqJCaa	i know a guy that quit and he had a heart attack..he doctor told him to keep smoking..sounds crazy but its true...so anything is possible really...maybe she should get the help of a doctor before trying cold turkey|`|YOrTdbeZaa	Nooooo lol i havent had a tab now sinceee this morning and ive been smoking for ages. But it is hard when ya just go cold turkey i did it for 6 weeks butt as soon as i started school again i started smoking again :o/|`|TGPqMxuaaa	it doesnt uasuall happen but its possible but only if she kills herself from depression or sum thing|`|b548e7d83e76abff190cad24e43b0ecaaa	Have her go to the doctor, there is no one here in yahoo answers who can tell you exactly how she will react to withdrawal. But whatever your doctor can prescribe to make her feel better will be one step more towards getting rid of the habit. Your mom needs all the help she can get. Everybody has an addiction, imagine going "cold turkey" and not eating any sugar or splenda for a month, no fruits, no juice, nothing sugary, you will feel extreme cravings, it is exactly the same but worse because unlike sugar nicotine is extremely dangerous.   Help your mom, remember she is going to feel awful for a long time until her body adjusts to the no nicotine regime.|`|An0UeP0Iaa	Your mother may be very uncomfortable with breaking the habit but the main answer to your question is no, I have a grandmother who is 70 years old and smoked 3 packs an evening, she couldn't stop so we had to get her hypnotized by a therapist she did not die, not even close, it nearly saved her life.    If you ask me I think your should definitley stop now before it's too late and the longer you wait the harder it is to stop.

Borborygmus: Bowel sounds, the gurgling, rumbling, or growling noise from the abdomen caused by the muscular contractions of peristalsis, the process that moves the contents of the stomach and intestines downward. The plural is borborygmi.     Bowel sounds are normal. Their absence can indicate intestinal obstruction. Bowel sounds may also be temporarily absent after abdominal surgery.     The word "borborygmus" has been rumbling around the English language for some 200 years. Its earliest known use in English dates to 1796. The word arrived from New Latin, but traces its way back to the Greek "borboryzein," which means "to rumble."    Feel free to consult with your personal physician if there are other symptoms along with the noises.

tGUTJM7Gaa	Here you go  Black Pepper    In America, black pepper is one of the most commonly used spices. In fact, it is not uncommon for a person to use pepper with every meal  a little on his eggs, a bit on his sandwich and salad, a lot on his steak and corn Fortunately, as it turns out, this is a good thing. Why? Because black pepper is good for us!    Black pepper improves digestion by stimulating the taste buds and thereby alerting the stomach to increase hydrochloric secretion. Black pepper is also an antioxidant, and it has antibacterial effects. But wait  theres more! You will be very happy to know that the outermost layer of the peppercorn actually helps stimulate the breakdown of fat cells!    Black pepper also helps prevent the formation of intestinal gas, promotes urination, and promotes sweating. It is full of manganese, and it also has a good amount of iron and dietary fiber, as well.|`|c8a8d53094ea569509766a4e7f84f96baa	These people who reply to questions thinking they know it all about pepper just because they are Indian...bully on you..YES BLACK PEPPER IS BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH..in small amounts pepper is ok..but your body cannot process to much of it so it sits in your colon and if you eat to much can cause problems to you digestive system..|`|MvFHGgUwaa	no actually its good for you|`|k4RS2gYVaa	I heard that pepper is good for you. Just avoid salt for it is not good for you. Salt makes you retain water and raise your blood pressure.|`|14f53352fc04cbea0f998cc9a2f760b5aa	Black pepper is an important part of the Indian diet. Being an Indian, I am quite aware of the medicinal properties of black pepper. It is carminative i.e. helps digestion, heats up the body (used more in winter here) and helps avert nausea. So the more you eat it the better.    If you were to find a connection between black pepper and coffee, black pepper is grown alongwith coffee in India because the creeper provides shade to coffee plants from the harsh sunlight in Indian summer. :-)

In general I'm pleasant except when it comes to smoking and drugs and heavy drinkers.|`|oJ0p2Ietaa	self harming, smokers think "it`ll never happen to me", people who self harm seem to be wishing it would happen,cos they are hurting them selves cos their unhappy, smoking has nothing to do with state of mind its peer pressure and wanting to look cool as a kid then you get addicted|`|hNCiw6Laaa	Interesting Q... I myself do smoke and i guess with the endless damage it can cause then i think smoking is worse?

Whilst it hurts you, it also saves you, as it helps you cope with things the only way you know how. Whereas smoking doesn't effect your mental health, apart from addiction, but the physical effects are often worse than that from self harming. So i would say smoking is worse.|`|3qjKxuibaa	I smoke Myvic electronic cigarette. It's much healthier and has no impact to others whatsoever. It's cheaper and I can use it absolutely anywhere, cause it doesn't have tobacco, or burning process. The 'smoke' which is produced is actually a vapour, which is harmless to others around. And keeps my lungs safe from tar and other chemicals :)|`|MIgwYj5uaa	In my opinion i think its a terrible way of destroying beautiful people. Scars are usually inversable as well as long cancer and throat problems from smoking. Is it really worth it?  The body is an amazing thing and its sad people destroy it.      Try music as an alternative :)|`|ntbSfSmGaa	As  an old lady pf 74 years I would like to urge all youngsters to give up smoking if possible.  I remember I used to hate smoking when I was young but was persuaded to try it by my friends as it was definitely the fashion in the 1950's.  Like a complete idiot I agreed to join in and became totally hooked.  I have  now been smoking for 50 years almost.  What  tragic mistake it is to start in the first place.  Although I have managed to stay cancer free (just luck) my throat is very problematic. I used to have a lovely singing voice but over the years it has been destroyed by smoking too much - I even have trouble talking most of the time which definitely destroys social life also I now suffer from emphesyma which is a breathing problem generally caused by smoking.  Please don't imagine I am some miserable old woman who doesn't want youngsters to enjoy life - nothing could be further from the truth but I would ask you to please, please stop smoking if you possibly can.  Sorry to nag but it's the truth....|`|ERHpAgVWaa	They're both really bad for you. I think it could go either way.

But I think keeping a pet cat or dog more effective. In USA, there are therapy dogs in hospitals to lift its patients spirits and help them recover faster.
AA10833391	Not really if you like feeling scruffy and have dead skin all over you.  The people of 100 years  or so ago thought that having baths weakened you, and instead of washing their hair they powdered their wigs, but I don't think you could go without washing/showering for very long as it would probably upset your family and friends, unless you live in a cave or similar.|`|APrvPTsNaa	Hmm. Well, apart from social ostracisation, you could potentially not notice suspicious lumps/ growths etc, as these things tend to be discovered when people bathe.

AA11899313	You are asking a question with ALL the potential to generate one hell of a HUGE response ~ or not, given the age range.      Age 61  Sex  Male    What are important attributes in a doctor/nurse?  To Observe and to actually Listen.    Do you see any health professionals other than a doctor, if so how often?  Pharmacist: Osteopath:  Podiatrist:  At least once a month.    What is it that makes a good experience of health care?  That the person attending you does just that, Attends you    Do you feel that your doctor takes your ideas and concerns into account and includes you in the decision making progress?  Given that I have to REMIND  my GP. and  others who attend me that I am somewhat hard of hearing (and have Tinnitus), it ticks me off.      Give the current state of the NHS a mark of 10: 10 being fantastic, 1 dismal.   Answer:  2.5  ~ & ~ 10    True tales:  Around 2000, I returned fro a holiday in Cyprus where I had (unintentionally) gained a fairly deep tan ~ having used all of the lotions + factors.    I went to my local Health Centre to see a Doctor as I felt unwell and had the suspicion Id contracted pneumonia.  I saw a female Doctor (1 of  6 who shared the practice and whom Id not seen previously) and said that I thought I had pneumonia.    At that time there was a lot of heavy WARNINGS in the national press and media about Suntans and the inherent Dangers of them  .Burnt skin is Burnt skin.  So, she took me by complete surprise on hearing my announcement by saying, Pneumonia!  Thats strange, you look so healthy.       I have to visit a mix of 6 different Hospitals and Medical / Health Centres during the course of a year.  Given the amount of WARNINGS there related to being Over Weight ~ Obesity and the controversial BMI index, it is therefores somewhat surprising the number of over weight medical Professionals I come into contact with / or am observing.    In my GPs practice, there are 10 staff full time, and only 1 person is slim, and one is about the right weight for her height (at a guess), and everyone else (including 3 Doctors) are Over Weight.     Having worked amongst Medical Professionals for over 25 years ~ and having been a Polio victim for 59 years, I could fill a fair few more feet with tales, observations and likely apocryphal tales too.    Sash.|`|vgkHZSTPaa	female  37yrs  Attributes- Able to listen and understand without being judgemental  I see a diabetic doctor every 6 months who is very supportive and thorough who listens to my concerns and provides honest solutions  I also see an optician yearly and a eye specialist every 6 months both are very supportive and able to advise without being judgemental    I feel I am very lucky where I live (i live in london) as i have lived in other places in the uk and had dismal health-care services I do think it depends on where you live. As to where i live I would rate it 9-10|`|OgaJqkSQaa	26  Female  Compassion. Being humble and not starting to think they're a god.  No.  Not being treated like a hypochondriac.  My GP is excellent, but it was difficult and time consuming to find a good GP.  Yes.  5/10. Too much arrogance in the profession. Too many of my health problems were dismissed for too long. I've now got a kidney which is covered in scar tissue because my kidney infections were dismissed as "stress."
Lj0xwPmraa	He may not have autism at all, but what is called Asperger's Syndrome.     Asperger's is close to autism, but those with Asperger's function a lot better than those with Autism.     Some symptoms of Asperger's include problems with social skills (not a lot of friends, difficulty relating to others), eccentric or repetitive behaviours (coughing, finger picking, etc.) unusual preoccupations or rituals (kinda like OCD in that they have to have their rituals) LIMITED RANGE OF INTERESTS (can be taken as an obsession with certain things, like airplanes, or phone books, or video games, etc. )     There are other symptoms but mostly I wouldn't worry about it. For the most part, most people with high-functioning autism or Asperger's Syndrome can live normal lives. They are very intelligent, lovely people.     He may not even have any of those. Hope it all works out for you    Good luck!|`|q5I0IqB9aa	Yes, he could possibly have autism. I would tell him to go and see a doctor, and have the doctor see if he has autism. There really isn't too much for you to do, unless he is suffering about this problem. Just be there for him. Maybe drive him to his doctor appointment?|`|94NYYq5Haa	NOT autism.  You would know something was very wrong if it were autism.  Think about asperger's disorder maybe, or schizoid personality disorder.    Most people with autism (over 2/3 of them) are also intellectually disabled.    He may just be odd.  If he is not experiencing distress, then you don't really need to help him.  Just because he is different doesn't mean something is wrong with him.  If he does something that bugs you, talk to him about it.  Just tell him to work on his posture, bring it up by joking about it and tell him he's going to be a hunchback old man one day or something.  When he hums, tell him what he's doing.  Don't go trying to diagnose someone that there is nothing wrong with.  If he does have symptoms of one of these disorders but they don't affect his life, then there is no treatment needed.    Not everyone who is different is disordered.  In order for treatment to be needed, there has to actually be a problem.
tSi10jneaa	I think you are blushing a lot which is causing the redness over your ears. Also do your ears remain covered with your hair.  Winter also can be blamed due to constant variation in temperature when you move in and out of the house.  Did you drink alcohol a lot or maybe ate plenty beef / pork or you have difficult bowel movements lately.|`|4cFYbySCaa	You could have an allergy to something outside.

Kidney Stone Removal is a serious surgery, and you should be there for him if at all possible.     That said, it does sound like you both have some issues that need dealt with and are probably very depressed. You should try marriage counseling. Having a professional, unbiased third party walk you through these difficult times could be very helpful in saving your marriage. Really please consider that, and if finances are a problem they do have public-aid therapists for little or no cost.    And as for the friends- tell them you don't feel well and today isn't a good day to stop by. That one is simple.    Good luck, really :)|`|UVdviQMPaa	A clear and definite sign.

You cant really control the things happening around you now. I cant comment on the situation with hubby, cuz there is obviously alot to the story besides what we know. Call your mom, do whatever, just don't let yourself sit there and be miserable. and maybe your friends are nosy, but maybe they care about you too. so, tell them to bring a bottle of whatever and don't let things eat you up inside.
AA10098742	I don't know that the condition of your teeth and effect your weight. i do know that you should get your teeth dealt with. breaks and infections can cause serious damage.    an abcesed tooths puss can bore its way down the root channeling a tunnel through your tooth and into your jaw bone. it wont stop there until it finds a place to drain.

Also, since you  are concerned with the cost, consider the eHealthPlus   membership, that could save you considerably if you  want to fix your teeth and not lose them.|`|8e3b674b6d222b69888295d275438787aa	Wow!! I am so sorry to hear about all of that. You are the 70% of people who don't have any health insurance. I do have one suggestion.    There is a company that offers dental benefits for only $11.95 a month for an individual and $19.95 a month for an entire household. They save you up to 80% on your dental needs.  Along with the dental you get Free vision, Free Presciption Drugs and Free Ciropractic benefits.     I would be careful though when looking into a health benefits company. A lot of them do not save you money and they have very few providers. The company I am talking about has been in business for 14yrs, BBB members and have over 1.5 million customers.    Below is the site if you would like to check it out.  Good luck with everything.    Christy|`|3a479fdc0531755707dc7f0aaa7ebca8aa	You do need to see a dentist, but make sure you use mouthwash with fluoride in it to protect your teeth and much as you can until you can get it fixed.  As mentioned before, you may be able to find deals with dentists, and you could explain your situation to different dentists to see if they will agree to help you for a very low cost that you could afford.
duVTqRM4aa	Yes, I love this stuff.  It's a bark that is extremely anti microbial.  The tea is great for everything from digestion to yeast.      FYI, this is NOT a cancer cure, it's a good support though for people with cancer.  Less is more with Pao d'Arco and the drug companies have found they cannot ISOLATE the properties for cancer treatments because it become toxic.

01x55AbOaa	shrooms are the best thing that has happened to me.before them i was self destructive and on a path to hell.they open your eyes to the beauty of life.one thing i must stress is that you prepare.make sure you have a nice peacefull setting with a good friend or family member without anything that may interrupt or disturb you(parents,work,kids angry spouses could all lead to a bad trip)i have tripped many a times and have never had a bad trip.as long as you dont freak out and stay in control you will have the time of your life.theres no way to od on shrooms, youll start feeling funny and then its like a 2 week vacation around the world after that.it only lasts about 3-4 hours.maybe a bed and some chill music.the best is pink floyd!glow sticks,trippy pics or posters, ive heard reading a good fiction book is pretty cool too,anyways e-mail me and i can help you some more...........btw psilocybes do not mess with your brain chemistry lol.and the deformed baby thing wtf|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	they are ok ..but remember this a male increases his risk of making deformed babies .. up to 3 months after taking psylocibes|`|SmVwFTpgaa	shrooms are beyond words|`|HT2oxntZaa	they like distort all ur senses, i remember being in a field one day on shrooms and it was like i was kind of in a another world, all the treees around me had my face in them. i grabbed an ounce of weed and i was eyballin my sack and all the little nugs had faces forming in them and then the faces had like big jaws with teeth sort of like trying to chomp on me .. if ur havin a good high u'll feel mellowed out and ull know that ur tripping but if u have a bad high its kinda scary **** why did i even answer this post i cant even explain this **** in detail peace|`|IMvg8zajaa	Shrooms are safer than pot, Pot is only harmful because of the smoke.

If you are going to use them understand that they are something that needs to be respected and prepared for.  You don't just do shrooms for fun at the spur of the moment.  They are best used when you are in a stable and positive state of mind and only when you can be in a comfortable safe environment for at least 8 hours.  The experience differs for everyone but is typically very inward oriented.  You will do a lot of reflecting on things.  Your senses will be thrown off and you may experience visual or auditory hallucinations based on your dosage.  Make sure you have a trip sitter if you have never done them before.  Basically  just have someone that isn't on shrooms there to watch you.  In most cases nothing bad will happen, but in the event of a bad trip it will be pretty crappy until they wear off after 5-7 hours.  Mushrooms are not addictive but aren't for everyone.  If you don't enjoy doing them the first time you will not want to do them again.  Its as simple as that really.  Good luck and happy shrooming.|`|s3yP7IoOaa	They make everything look really colorful and bright. They also make you see crazy things. I wouldn't do them though, they mess with your brain chemistry and you'll never be the same, even if you only do them once. Trust me.
mfC7b6tgaa	I'm a stay at home mom and getting the kids to school and helping with their homework is a big deal so don't sell yourself short on that. At this point in time everyone is having a hard time finding jobs. With our economy so bad and people getting laid off. About the fiance's  parents, they will be gone soon then you'll probably be the one cooking so enjoy it for awhile. Why won't he let you cook breakfast or lunch? Just get up and do it. :-)  I went through a period of depression a few years ago and starting seeing a counselor and got on a medication called effexor it really helped a lot. Not just the pills but also being able to talk to someone. You need to try to get through this not only for you but for the kids as well. Good luck and I hope you feel better.|`|kgdVgHeqaa	if your unemployed are you at least in come sort of club?  i dont know your personal life but maybe you need a feeling of belonging someone esp if your not a student/ employee|`|MIgwYj5uaa	Keep looking for jobs   You can also post things around town saying that you'll be able to do house work, babysitting, painting and other things.  The good thing about that is you can manage your own hours and how much you want to be paid. This is a last resort.  See if you can get into other activities at the school with your kids  And talk to your husband about how you feel.      -Good luck :)
pzTXnh0maa	Si la puede consumir siempre y cuando no sea en exceso y que consuma aparte la cantidad de agua natural indicada entre 1 litro y medio o dos, te recomiendo mas la coca light ya que actualmente los estudios demuestran que han encontrado algunos detalles no muy buenos en la coca zero, recuerda que para las personas diabticas es indicado consumir sustitutos de azcar NO BAJOS EN AZUCAR cualquier cantidad de azucar por minima que sea afecta a la grucosa, debes checar las etiquetas de los alimentos y fijarte que no contengan fructosa, miel o azcar ya que cualquiera de estas incrementan la glucosa en sangre.    Espero te sirva|`|KceyGVnIaa	Te comento lo que me recomend mi nutriloga, no ingerir ningn refresco obscuro( estos suben el nivel de glucosa) y preferentemente el de la marca Pe?afiel que se llama Naturel de cualquier sabor o tehuacan que diga mineral (es agua natural, no procesada y viene directo del manantial ),NO mineralizado (estos hacen da?o) porque estn procesados.

EEpXZGu5aa	Honestly, it's not that big of a deal. That information is in your mind, it's just that you'd need a hypnotist to concentrate and figure out those memories.    Don't worry about it, I can' remember before 5ish. I kind of remember 6. Hardly.    It's pretty normal and varies from person to person.|`|5YVfVhRUaa	haha i cant remember ANYTHING when i was 7.except for a school play but thats it.and im 15.im hopin its not bad but im pretty sure its not.i actually remember very small things like talkin to my parents but not big things.WEIRD!|`|ikm8hJYZaa	If you think you do not have bad memory wait untill you improve it and you will think otherwise about you past memory because your ability to absorb and recall information will be amazing.    I remember the happiest and the sadest moments of my childhood and there were not many of them.    Yes it is normal or acceptable and not a sign of mental retardation.    You have the memories in your mind.Many of them are just lost because you have not accessed them in a long time so the roads leading to these memories have deteriorated.It happens to everyone who do not give their mind what it needs,how much it needs and when it needs it.    Your mind can maintain the strong connection to all your memories and you can have a life long memory of even the most insignificant information if you change your dietary habbits.Speaking from personal experience.    When you start giving your mind what it needs you will find what you have lost and much much more.       Start the omega 3 diet.I have researched omega 3 acids for 2 years and performed a very successful experiment on myself and few of my volunteer friends.Few months of the omega 3 diet it significantly reduced stress[and/or cured depression] problems permanently and significantly raised my intelligence,improved memory,gave me high emotional and muscle control,sight,reflexes[and many other known and unknown benefits]and without any drugs or supplements in the form of pills.    http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/heal...    http://www.nature.com/npp/journal/v32/n3...    http://www.naturalnews.com/021119.html    http://www.buzzle.com/articles/omega3-de...      Take two table spoons of grinded flaxseed[rich with omega 3 and cheap]a day[with a glass of water] and in a few months you will start to notice significant improvement in your mental health[you will become more psychologically stable,among other things].Use a coffee grinder.Whole seeds cannot be digested by the hydrochloric acid in our stomach only grinded seeds.A fact and not a assumption.There are many articles on the internet about the omega 3 fatty acids.    Flax is the best source of ALA omega 3 fatty acid which our body converts to more important fatty acids called DHA and EPA.For the efficient conversion to take place,foods containing a large amount of the following nutrients must be consumed along with the flaxseed:C,B3,B6 [vitamins],zink and Magnesium [minerals].I recommend 3 table spoons of flax with 100 grams[or more if to your liking] of almonds and/or 250g of green peas,1 kiwi every day.[do not take more then 3 table spoons of flax because large amounts can cause intestinal gases which can cause abdominal pain and/or constipation.If three spoons causes abdominal discomfort lower the dosage to 2 table spoons of grinded flax and elevate it to 3 table spoons after your body adapts to high fiber content].

I still have the scar from the stitches to this day.|`|ERHpAgVWaa	I remember a LOT of pointless memories when I was like 3, but I can't even remember the names of my kidergarden or first grade teachers!

Like, I'll remember the car ride to see my dad(when he was in jail) but I won't remember the fact I started choking on that ride! Or I'll remember visting my dad, but not the fact that we were actually at the jail! Sometimes, I'll remember small covos. with people, but I won't remember why.

When people put others down, it's to feel better about themselves - to pick out imperfections of others instead of themself.     So now that that's clear, rise yourself above them! As if you are better and won't fall under the trap of them trying to dictate your emotions. Don't give people the control they don't have. Only you are in control - nobody else. If you go around and act confident, soon you will FEEL confident. Do not even consider what other people are thinking about you for they are powerless against your free will. Accept and be who you know you have inside you and anyone who doesn't like it - brush them off and be unbelievably confident and on top of the world. Try to excel at a hobby/set goals for yourself and do not let people come between that. You have potential - nobody can take that away from you.|`|uYbwxlqBaa	show other ppl that they r wrong  stand up 4 urself and try diss them back  but dont say anything stupid like "ur face"  or smthin like that  that only works like once in a while    good luck!

There are several cures for that, but the most effective is to give you some serious spanking by your parents until you start to study instead sitting all day online!|`|v7Wflu78aa	Part of depressions is thoughts which lead to depression.  For example, if you think your are a loser, then you might feel depressed.  Or, if you think that you have no future, or things always go wrong, those thoughts also lead to depression.    But, those thoughts are irrational.    Example of rational thoughts:   If I don't do well on this test, there's always the opportunity to do better the next time.  And, I do well on some tests, not on others.  Like all humans, I have many weaknesses and a few strengths.      Example of an irrational thoughts that lead to depression:  All my classmates think I'm stupid because I did poorly.  If they think I'm stupid, they'll be mean to me.  The teacher will think I didn't study, and will be made at me.  I'm going to do bad on tests for the rest of my life, and I'll always be a failure.    Examples of irrational thoughts that don't help:  I'm really the best in the class in this subject, it's just that the teacher doesn't understand how brilliant my answers were.  I'll show the class, I'm going to be a famous race car driver some day, then they'll realize how smart I really am.    There is a method for learning how to quiet the harmful thoughts and strengthen rational, helpful thoughts.    It's call "Rational Emotive Therapy."  You really can learn to think more clearly, just like you can learn the if it's cold you can put on warm clothing or go to a warmer place.    So, I highly recommend that you seek treatment now so that in twenty years you can look back on a happy childhood.|`|MTpABOwnaa	look hon you have no reason to be depressed your in fourth grade grades really don't matter you may be upset but your not depressed i don't know if your Christan or not but i used to think i was trash till i found him u don't really need to worry you will be fine and maybe if ur depressed spend time with friends doing stuff you want to do

be5b6f02c20b23ba0ebd00d8685794a0aa	I had a vasectomy at 21.  I have no children.  I am not the only man I know that did so.  It is not a big deal.  It was the best thing I ever done.    Yes a doctor would perform one.|`|yj3GT7jOaa	In some states a male will need to be married and have the wife's consent.  Check with a doctor or local health department.  Some vasectomies are reversible and some are not.  That is a big step.|`|KlkUj6uFaa	He has the right to do whatever he wants with his own body. I personally think it would be foolish to get one so young, but that would be his decision to make.|`|vdIXzX4naa	I think it is too young for him to make a decision like that. He may be wild now and will settle down later. And even though a vasectomy can be reversed, it is always best to avoid surgery.    He just needs to remember to wear a condom and for women he is around to use protection as well. It is called being responsible.|`|RoR3o6iQaa	i think the doctor will do whatever asked just simply for money but honestly you may not want everyones oppinion bcuz they could really give you and him mixed feelings about this. just remember its HIS choice he will do what he wants hes a man lol.|`|W2z5dCrmaa	Women find it easy to suggest just using a condom, because they don't realize how much a condom degrades the sense of feel for a male.    She doesn't have that problem because her man and the condom slides over her parts and feels the same almost with or without a condom. For the male, the condom moves with him, so the condom is a barrier between what he contacts and his nerve receptors. If the condom stayed still inside of her and he slid in and out of the condom, then the disadvantage would be trading places.    The risk for having awesome Love Making for a Dude by not using a condom is too high, even with a vasectomy because of std's and HIV being on that same list. No risk would look like a committed relationship as in marriage with an std free woman Whom he loves with hopes of spending a life time with her.  Pregnancy is the secondary concern today.    If you are encouraging him to have a vasectomy so that the two of you can have best possible experience, try a device known as an IUD.    It is a small platinum shaped Y that is placed in the womb, through the cervix by a doctor or gynecologist. It does nothing other than sit there will no chemical or effects on your body. When you ovulate, the egg will not attach to the wall of the womb and start growing a fetus, just because there is a foreign object present with a particular negative electrical valence to it, meaning rich in electrons.    Platinum is an inert, noncorrosive and completely safe material. Plastic has been used, but plastic is a chemically synthesized compound which I wouldn't personally trust for my Lady. If you wish to have children, the device is extracted back up into a tiny tube and removed. Nothing has changed and away you go.    With your Man getting a vasectomy, the reversal success rate is really low, even shortly after the procedure.       After five years, most guys don't realize that chances of a reversal to have children are really slim. Too much can happen between him being 21 years old, and a few years down the road. I'm 24 now and wanting children in about two more years. At age 21, the only thing on my mind was good Love Making with my Lady with little much more on my mind. Now I'm ready for more, as in having babies along with good Love Making with my Lady.    What you two want, or maybe you in particular, is unfair to him for his future, especially in a non-committed relationship. If you two go separate ways in the future, it's no skin off your *** if he can't have a family with the one to whom he commits himself.    He may not be in a place in life yet to view the whole picture, so a vasectomy is so not the right thing for your Dude!    Hope that makes a bit of sense for you?    Me! :- )|`|K4zsztkRaa	I don't think a doctor will preform it.  It's like a female getting her tubes tied almost.  I think it's stupid too at this age.  He just needs to be more careful.  Wear condoms and make sure you are on birth control. Condoms aren't a good form of birth control. They are only 75% effective.    also keep in mind that all a vasectomy does is lower your sperm count. You can still have kids. Especialy a 21 year old. He will be so firtle that it wouldn't matter. He could still have those pregnancy scares.  It just reduces the chance that a man will get a woman pregnant, but he could still get her pregnant.    The problem it does pose is that it's will hurt like hell to get it reversed and to have kids as he get's older will be more difficult.

I am fourteen and as soon as I am old enough I want to get a vasectomy.|`|6ce30766a545694d9f60976802874a8baa	No. A vasectomy isn't something to get so you can freely have sex without having to worry about getting a girl pregnant. If he doesn't want to bring a child into the world, then he shouldn't be having sex. But 21 is too young to be making such a big and important decision as that, that you have to live with the rest of your life.

My friends mom has really bad acne, and guess what she smokes like a chimney.... but my mom has no acne at all and she smokes quite heavily.. (just talking about cigarettes and tobacco here)    Saying that, one of my friends smokes so much weed he would turn into a weed plant soon, and his skin is amazingly clear....

94NYYq5Haa	Well, your definition of MPD (now called Dissociative identity disorder) and schizophrenia are much simplified.  But you are right, the tell tale sign of dissociation (if it actually exists--which there is debate about) is periods of amnesia.  Schizophrenia is characterized by a number of symptoms, only one of which is auditory hallucinations, many people with schizophrenia don't hear voices, and these are by far not the most debilitating symptoms.   "Personalities" in people with DID generally don't talk to each other.  voices conversing is more associated with schizophrenia, yes.  Hollywood is not so great at portraying mental illness most of the time.  They hardly ever get it right.|`|3187cafaa9313c5c6575c8397c98a79eaa	Hi, I have copied and pasted my answer to almost the exact same question from another user. I have DID, and have been in the mental health system since 1995. I hope your interest continues on this subject. the other answerer is correct there is not a total consensus in the psychiatric community over the actual existence of DID. Unfortunately, i can attest to the fact that it does exist.    Sorry this answer is long, but it is an education for anyone interested in the subject, and honestly only scratches the surface of both of these disorders.    Best Answer - Chosen by Asker  The best answer i have read so far is from mentel junkie. usually if i see an answer that i think sufficiently address the the question, i do not answer it myself.   But as someone with DID, i believe i can offer the most definitive answer.  In a person with DID, they may and most often do experience many symptoms associated with a wide variety of other disorders. that leads me to the first part of my answer, and as i can personally attest, a very important part.  Schizophrenia is a pretty straight forward diagnosis to receive. it's symptoms, or the combination of them are not commonly associated with other disorders. That being the case, they are diagnosed much more quickly with the correct diagnosis. As such, they are able to receive treatment that targets their specific problem.  DID on the other hand is very difficult to diagnose, furthermore it is not even fully accepted by the psychiatric community, making diagnosis even more difficult.   Because a person with DID posseses a multitue of "alters", often times the doctor will recieve different information from the patient on different visits.   I will use myself, hopefully as a useful example.   I was initially diagnosed with depression after a nervous breakdown in 1995.   In 2002, after a suicide attempt, i was diagnosed with deep recurrent depression with psychotic features,and PTSD, along with GAD.  In 2004-5 my diagnosis was changed to add Bi-Polar 1 with psychotic features  In 2006, Panic attacks were added  In 2007, after having been on heavy doses of anti-psychotics for years, i happend across an artical on webMD about DID. After reading it, it was clear to me that this was the actual problem i suffered from.  In 2007, after presenting the information to my doctor i was finally correctly diagnosed. I had DID.    Number 2. Schizophrenics are unaware that the voices they hear, and the hallucinations they have are not real. Further, they tend to shun help. they will have delusions, paranoia as well as other things which are in their unreal worlds. They are usually unaware they have a problem.    People with DID most often realize they have a problem, have been seeking help for years to figure out what it is. Persons with DID often struggle with great amounts of emotion pain, often leading to suicide. The voices we here, we know are NOT real, but rather are the converations taking place within the confines of our own minds. In the mass majority of cases, persons with DID never have visual hallucinations.  We are coherent to what is "really" going on in the world around us, though most of us do suffer from pychosis.     If you need any more details please email me, and dont forget my ten points :) I am on Y/A's while back in the states waiting for a bed to open up at Sheppard Pratts trauma ward. I live in the Philipippines cuz life is more simple for me there and people there dont notice my "quirkyness"  3 days ago   Source(s):  My brain

H0aiDO9Paa	Ulcerative colitis: Physicians still don't know what causes ulcerative colitis, an inflammatory disease of the colon that leads to diarrhea and rectal bleeding. (It can also affect the skin, eyes, joints and liver.) However, various drugs can suppress the inflammation and control the symptoms. Those medications include mesalamine (Asacol) and sulfasalazine (Azulfidine), corticosteroid drugs such as prednisone (Deltasone), and in resistant cases, immunosuppressant drugs such as mercaptopurine (Purinethol). People who have had extensive ulcerative colitis for a long time are at increased risk of colon cancer. Those people should undergo annual colonoscopy (inspection of the entire colon through a flexible lighted tube) to check for cancer or precancerous changes. And good luck.|`|AA10436595	If your bowel movement is red, you may have an internal hemmorhoid which is bleeding.  The "shock of pain" sounds like your sciatic nerve may be pinched.

SLoCe1wcaa	Well, this kinda sounds like good news.  You don't have a personality at the moment so you can create one however you want.  It is always easier to start from scratch than to try to revise one.       Bravo!    Let's get started.      Go to the store or library and pick out your favorite magazine - if you don't have a favorite, just pick one with pretty colours and a glossy finish.  Sit down and start reading.  What do you see in there that appeals to you.  Start writing a list of interesting people and things to do.    Once you have got a page full of ideas you can start on your journey.    Pick 3 ideas.  Either because they appeal to you more than the others or randoming put your finger on three.  Underline them.    Here is an example.  Perhaps you have just read identified Princess Diana, Brad Pitt and an article about dogs.   Something about those three items appealed to you.  What were they?  Make a list.      For me I would say that I liked Princess D's style and caring for people.  I liked that she was a classy lady and she was a 'do-gooder'.  Brad Pitt is just plain sexy and is very competent in his work and is making a difference in the world by helping out all these little children he is adopting.   Dogs always love you and they are fun.   Right there I am beginning to see what I like about life and what I would also like to be doing.   I like helping people, acting classy, being good at what I do and I like to be loved unconditionally.  I like to have fun.    Yes, I got all that out of thinking about why I liked the things I listed!    You can do that too.    Then you have to think about ways that you could become that person you have written or thought about.  So, in my case, I could read up on who needs help in my community and get involved.  Then I would probably make friends and I would have something to talk to other people about because I have been doing something.  I know that I love dogs and perhaps I might even volunteer at a dog shelter.  Or maybe just find other people who like dogs and talk to them about dogs.      Do you see what I mean?  You can create a whole new wonderful personality and I don't think you will be bored for a minute.    Good luck and have fun!   Go out and shine!!!!   Whooo Hooooo!!!!!|`|0II2e6I9aa	As a psychiatrist, I strongly consider you seek help from a qualified mental health care provider.  Your symptoms certainly sound consistent with a chronic depressive condition called dysthymia.  Many people who have been depressed to a mild to moderate level most of their lives aren't even aware they have this condition.  Many of the things you state are often seen in this condition, including low self-esteem, negative self-image, hopelessness, feeling emotionally empty or numb, difficulty experiencing and/or expressing positive feelings, feelings of inadequacy and bordeom, isolation from other people, difficulty making social contacts, friendships, romantic relationships (all because your brain makes you think you're unworthy of being cared for or loved), believing nothing will change and that your life is how it's going to be forever.  There is also a risk for substance abuse and even suidical thinking or actions.      This is a treatable condition, often responding to a combination of psychotherapy and anti-depressant medications.  Also, depending on the length of time you have been experiencing these symptoms, medical conditons must also be ruled out, such as thyroid problems, chronic infectious illnesses, undiagnosed hypertension or diabetes, Lyme disease, fibromyalgia, type C hepatitis, etc.      So my first suggestion is that you see your general physician for a complete physical and any recommended laboratory tests.  If these are all normal, then ask your doctor to refer you to a qualified psychiatrist for an assessment and treatment options.  This person may then recommend a therapist or counselor to help you work on your self-esteem, how to make necessary life changes to improve your social skills, and any other help you need and want.  I wish you good luck and hope you feel better.|`|tg92pXDUaa	I suggest you go to your doctor, you have very low self-esteem.
AAgX0SDcaa	Could be pleurisy, an inflammation of the lining of the lungs. I have had it off and on since I was 14. It happens more after I've been sick with the flu or other virus, and I don't smoke. It also happens when I change from warm air to cold air (wintertime outside) or if I laugh really hard. Feels like a knife cutting and it is helpful to calm down and breathe slowly for awhile (hard to do when you want to double over with pain) and it finally eases up.

To many people, a dental visit is about getting their teeth cleaned, having a tooth pulled or having a filling placed. However, a dental visit is not just about teeth. It is also about your overall health. What goes on in your mouth can affect the rest of your body, and what goes on in the rest of your body can have an effect on your mouth.   Many diseases and conditions can affect your oral health. For example, people with weakened immune systems may be more likely to get fungal and viral infections in the mouth. The immune system (the system that protects the body from illness and infection) can be weakened by disease or as a side effect of cancer chemotherapy drugs or by drugs that are taken to prevent the rejection of transplanted organs or bone marrow. Medications taken for other conditions also can affect the health of your mouth. For example, many drugs cause dry mouth, which can increase your risk of dental decay, oral yeast infections and other oral infections.   During your dental exam, your dentist might see something in your mouth that is a sign or symptom of an illness or disease that you might not even know you have. You can then be referred to a specialist for treatment. Your dentist also can make sure you get specialized oral and dental care if you have a chronic condition that requires it. If necessary, he or she can refer you to an expert in oral medicine.   Your oral health also can affect other medical conditions. For example, if you are diabetic, an infection in your mouth can disrupt your blood-sugar levels and make your diabetes harder to control. Researchers also are exploring the role of periodontal (gum) disease as a potential risk factor for various medical conditions, including heart disease.      Mouth-healthy eating  If you want to prevent cavities, how often you eat can be just as important as what you eat. That's because food affects your teeth and mouth long after you swallow. Eating cookies with dinner will do less harm to your teeth than eating them in the middle of the afternoon as a separate snack. Of course, overall poor nutrition can contribute to periodontal (gum) disease and can have other long-term effects on your mouth. Learning how food affects your oral health  long-term and short-term  is the first step toward mouth-healthy eating.    Immediate Effects of Food   Changes begin in your mouth the minute you start to eat certain foods. Bacteria in your mouth make dental plaque become more acidic, and the acid starts the process that can lead to cavities.   How does this happen?  All carbohydrate foods eventually break down into simple sugars: glucose, fructose, maltose and lactose. Some foods, called fermentable carbohydrates, break down in the mouth, whereas others don't break down until they move further down the digestive tract.  It's the fermentable carbohydrates that work with bacteria to begin the decay process and eventually destroy teeth. They include the obvious sugary foods, such as cookies, cakes, soft drinks and candy, but they also include less obvious food, such as bread, crackers, bananas and breakfast cereals.  Certain bacteria on your teeth use the sugars from these foods and produce acids. These acids dissolve minerals inside the tooth enamel in a process called demineralization. Teeth also regain minerals in a natural process called remineralization. Saliva helps this process, as does fluoride and some foods.  Dental decay begins inside the tooth enamel when minerals are being lost faster than they are being regained.  The longer food stays near the bacteria on the tooth, the more acids will be produced. So sticky carbohydrates, such as raisins, can do more acid damage. But other foods that pack into crevices can also cause decay. Potato chips are a terrific example. Eat a handful of chips and see how long you have to work to get all the stuck bits out from between your teeth. Teeth with a lot of nooks and crannies, such as molars, are more likely to trap food and are more susceptible to decay.  To make matters worse, tooth-unhealthy foods don't create acids on your teeth only while they are being eaten. The acids stick around for the next half-hour.  People who sip soft drinks or sweetened coffee throughout the day or who eat many small sweet or carbohydrate snacks provide a sugar source for the bacteria to produce acid almost constantly. And because acid damage is cumulative, decay is more likely. Studies have shown that those who eat sweets as snacks between meals have higher incidences of decay than those who eat the same amount of sweets with their meals.  On the brighter side, some foods actually help to protect teeth from decay because they increase saliva flow and neutralize the acids produced by bacteria, making the enamel less likely to be demineralized. For example, aged cheese eaten immediately after other food helps buffer the acid. That's another reason why eating sweets between meals causes more cavities. Between-meal snackers not only have an overall longer period when their teeth are exposed to acid, they don't eat other foods with the snack to moderate the effects of the sugar.  Chewing sugarless gums also can help protect your teeth against cavities. Xylitol, an ingredient in some sugarless gums, has been shown to reduce the amount of bacteria in the mouth and help buffer the teeth against the effect of acid. Most sugarless gums and sugarless candies increase the flow of saliva, which has natural antibacterial properties.    Long-Term Effects   Like the rest of your body, your mouth depends on overall good nutrition to stay healthy. In fact, your mouth is highly sensitive to poor nutrition, which can lead to premature tooth loss, serious periodontal (gum) disease and bad breath. Many nutritiona
AuL6U51caa	Regular chapstick or carmex should work just fine. Just remember to keep applying it often, and drink lots of water & tea. Try to do this as often as you can, more like once before you go to school, once during school, after you get home, and every 2-3 hours after, or whenever you notice dryness. But 3 should do OK.

Good luck & Good job for caring about your brother :)|`|AA10046659	You will have to confront your parents about this.  Tell them basically what you have told us, that you're worried about his health & that it may make him gain weight eventually.  Plus the fact it is so unhealthy.  Give them suggestions of things to give him in place of all this junk like fruits.  Your brother has become addicted to the sugar he's eating & that's why he has a fit when he doesn't get it...plus the fact that your parents are obviously spoiling him & letting him have control over THEM instead of the way it should be.  It sounds like you're not going to be able to do it alone since everytime you take something away from him he runs to your parents & they give in.  You could try to do what I said above & try to convince your brother to eat fruit instead of what he's after.  I'm sorry you have such a hard battle on your hands.  I think speaking to your parents without arguing with them about it is about the only thing you can really do.  Make suggestions to them on how to make your brother's life more healthy.  Good luck~|`|7831e589508db928daee38b65c04534aaa	Don't give. find websites supporting wat your saying and show your parents. He'll thank you later on!

Try introducing healthy foods to him that he's never tried and find out what he likes. As for all the other junk he eats, all I can say is that you need to put your foot down with him. He is only 4 and it's for his own good! Show your parents how terribly this could affect him if he continues eating the way he does.|`|AA11867833	your parents need to start taking more responsibility for your brother's diet. that is way too much sugar for a 4 year old to be consuming. You don't die from obesity, but from the complications eg. Diabetes, heart disease, some cancers. At the moment you only need to worry about diabetes but also tooth decay. Try finding brochures or websites about the problems caused by obesity and show them to your parents. It is far more important to look after his long term health than the temporary satisfaction that the junk he eats gives him. If your parents stand their ground and don't give in to his tantrums he will eventually learn that his behaviour is inappropriate and wont get him anywhere, if they give up he will never learn this and the situation will never improve, and your brother will grow up overweight and feeling constantly unwell due to inadequate nutrition.|`|6c38980990dbbdd5710814e57bc1a234aa	he's not fat probably because he is active..but try giving him fruits and veggies.....convince your parents to buy him healthy snacks..even if it is fruit snacks...they are great for in between meals, but only give him one package..  also for dessert offer him fat free jello.   for breakfast let him eat eggs and a slice of toast with a little bit of jelly...no butter though. lunch im assuming he eats at school so he should be good there..but on the weekend *this goes for dinner too* give him pineapple with the 2 meals, pineapple absorbs the fat in foods.   cut him off soda..he is too young for soda...have him drink more water, milk, and give him juicy juice when you think he deserves it.   all 4 year olds are brats...trust me..    ..also tell your parents they need to discipline him more...

tRLCftVGaa	The chances of you getting pregnant from the bodily fluid around the rim of the vagina are pretty slim.  The sperm would certainly have a long way to travel and the sperm was already ejaculated before it touched the rim of your vagina.  The longer the sperm has left the body, the less of a chance that the sperm can travel up the falobian tubes successfully.  The only worry you should have is if there was a tear in the condom before he pulled out.  For the future, also be careful of the types and kinds of condoms that you buy.

GMgsaFFBaa	Here's an excellent link that discusses the neurotransmitters in detail and explains how irregularities lead to various diseases. The question is more complicated than I can answer briefly here and has more to do with dopmine receptors versus production of dopamine.    http://www.benbest.com/science/anatmind/...|`|AA11608496	i dont know for sure, but generally i think neurons can only release 1 type of neurotransmitter, and when they say dopiminergic neuron that means that the transmitter that neuron releases is dopamine, cholinergic neurons release acetylcholine, etc. so my guess to your question is that yes they are the only neurons that release dopamine but im not extremely confident with that answer, i might be wrong|`|I05WnOPiaa	ther are only four types:cholinergic neuron aminergic neuron aminoacidnergic neuron peptidergic neuron peptidergic neuron  only aminergic neuron could release that.  you could go and buy some medical book if you like it

4bcikmesaa	Start of talking about something that happened to someone becuase of diet pills.  Like, "It was just a usual day for (lets just call her Judy) Judy.  She would go to the store, then go work out.  Little did she know that she would be late to pick up her son from school though.  In (a date) Nov. of 2005 Judy started taking diet pills....." Maybe something like that.    Good Luck with your paper!|`|671SwG7Raa	Nausea. Vomiting. Anal Leakage. Increased heartrate. Anxiety.  Is losing weight quickly worth all of that?|`|IqWE1NHraa	Well, first you have to decide which side of the argument you're on.  Choose a side and then brainstorm three reasons to support your argument.  Use those three reasons in your thesis statement as the last sentence in your introductory paragraph.  Let each reason be a paragraph.  Then add a conclusion where you restate your thesis in a different way as your final sentence.      So, for example, if you were in favor of diet pills, you might write an introduction like...    In 1960, one out of nine Americans were obese.  By 2007, those statistics jumped to one out of three!  No one can argue that America is in the midst of an obesity epidemic.  What is the solution?  One possible solution could be effective diet pills.  Diet pills should be manufactured and widely distributed because they can help curb childhood obesity, they can save the government billions of dollars in health care costs, and they can allow people to get their weight off and lead happier, more productive lives.    Then of course, paragraph 2 would be about childhood obesity. Paragraph 3 about the billions that the government spends on obesity-related health care, and paragraph 3 about helping people get thinner to lead happier lives.  Just add a conclusion and you're golden!  Good luck!|`|AA10833391	Start by saying just that "Diet pills should be banned", then expand on your opinion.  Give scientific evidence from medical journals and results of surveys in both pro and con terms.  Good luck
o2FJIXS9aa	Yes, it's possible, especially if the condom breaks. Around 8 years ago I had a bf that didn't tell me he was HIV positive and it fell off and he continued to have sex with me. He also let me perform oral sex on him without a condom. It was only when he ejaculated on my face did he bother to tell me about it. I went through hell for about a year, got tested every three months and I was always negative. I still get tested every year and I am negative. I have been told that the more frequently you have sex with someone who's infected, condom or not, the more likely you are to get it. I just think I am very lucky. I think if you are going to have sex with someone, the best way to prevent HIV is to both get tested and use a latex condom. A good talk would help too. I feel that if I had really discussed stds with him I wouldn't have been through all the hell I have been through - that he might have been more honest with me.|`|gzaXHcweaa	yes|`|t2YUn4FYaa	Well theres a chance that it can break|`|XWdc2qk4aa	yes you do...|`|F0uLexezaa	there's always a chance but a condom is very effective|`|s34GP3Ioaa	Only if they flip you over and don't bother to wear a rubber.

The only thing is that it can take from 1 month to 4 months to get a positive blood test done for herpes! If you test now it may show up as a negative! I would test now & then in another month or two.  If you have any questions please feel free to hit me up. I was just diagnosed with herpes type 2 a week ago. I have learned alot of info on this.

xb7ey8c0aa	We all need a pep talk from time to time.  Don't focus so much on your physical aspects, instead start the day with a pep talk about how hard you are going to work, how much you are going to do for others and end it with DAMN I LOOK GOOD.

hmsMpECkaa	It gets detailed and it is called Cymatics.  But, I don't know that you can call it addiction, like being addicted to sex.  Cymatics can be used to addict a population to certain thing by the activation of the pleasure centers of the brain by sound.  That's where backward masking is found out; also subliminal messages.    Old Church Hymns are based on he pleasure centers of the brain being activated by the tones in the music.  Loud Rap Music with bass tones do not cause addiction of rappers, but it is a result of feelings.  The being drawn to listen to a certain sound is like your body is trying to match vibrations.    Sound vibrations can cause your body to produce hormones and enzymes and peptides, but then again it could be the same as sex addiction.|`|hoI9CwWLaa	Same here.. I cant go a day without music..

I just LOVE the sound of my favourite music.  And I like musicals...It's kind of worrying actually.  I'm TERRIFIED of going deaf someday...It's quite a big fear of mine actually.    Try (purposefully, deliberately) going a week without your I-Pod, and see how that goes for you.  Like, hide it, or get someone like a friend or sibling or parent to take it from you for a while, and see how you get on.    Tell someone like a parent about it.

AA10531094	How does salmonella get into peanut butter?    Feces from some animal is a strong possibility. A leak in the roof, for example, caused one of the early outbreaks. How salmonella got into the water that was on the roof, no one knows for sure. Maybe birds, for instance, which accumulate around peanut butter processing plants.    The roasting of peanuts is the only step that will kill the salmonella. If contamination occurs after the roasting process, the game is over and salmonella is going to survive. Studies have shown that salmonella can survive for many months in peanut butter once it's present. Fatty foods are also more protective of salmonella, so when it gets into the acid of the stomach -- which is our first line of defense -- it may not get destroyed.  Peanut butter, being a highly fatty food, could survive better.|`|e2HW9iQ5aa	salmonella  is a bacteria that can infect any food. It has nothing to do with eggs.

3156c54d8f966e51776af0486120bb1daa	Whilst most girls of your age know all there is to know about their own bodies, most are as ignorant as you boys are about the workings of the male body.    If this is the first time she will have had sex, it is doubtful that she will know that your foreskin ought to be able to be retracted when erect.  She will be unaware that sex would be many times more pleasurable if the foreskin didn't get in the way and prevent the rim of the glans from directly contacting the walls of the vagina.    From your point of view, however, you need to be aware that during the thrusting of sex your foreskin might be forced back over the rim of the glans and tear with painful, bloody and embarrassing consequences.  If it does not tear then it might contract behind the erect glans and be unable to be replaced over the glans (paraphimosis).  This becomes an emergency situation and needs to be resolved rapidly if gangrene of the glans is to be avoided.|`|s65op1hGaa	If you tell her the situation i'm sure she will understand, it's fine to do it now but she may be curious as to why it doesn't do the same thing as shes probably seen on the internet or porn or whatever.

But my advice is tell her.|`|6cf45f1e4b4887d9df5323037a43c464aa	Yes, many men go through life never retracting their foreskin. It doesn't affect sex. But it's better if you can stretch it out sufficiently to pull back all the way.|`|yH8ZlwpTaa	It's ok. Keep stretching. Push it back prior to sex. And keep it clean under there so she isn't grossed out by bacteria.|`|qzpQdJ44aa	Yes it is possible to have sexual activity without a retracted foreskin.  However this is not a very good habit.  You should stretch the foreskin daily so that you can pull it off even when you are erect.  And also, it is the exposed glans that feels better during sex.|`|u8CFwtyMaa	It should be OK to have sex, but take it easy. If you are stretching it daily, and it's only a problem when erect, then you shouldn't take too long before it retracts fully when erect.  Once this happens, sex will be much more pleasurable.  Hope this helps|`|TYQOafA8aa	For thousands of years men (like me) had been having sex without pulling back the foreskin, cause it is there to give your penis extra sensitivity, did you know that your foreskin had an average of 30,000 nerve terminals?

9d60a294b6864b585406ddb61a14d757aa	Starbursting is a common post op complaint associated with laser vison correction.  It tends to be more noticeable with 1) higher amounts of correction 2) smaller optical zones created during the procedure (that's why most surgeons now create the largest optical zone possible) 3) tear quality problems caused by the laser procedure 4) optical effects of the laser changing the architecture of the cornea.    The good thing is that most people do see significant improvement in strabursting over time.  How much time?  It varies from patient to patient and some patients (such as myself -- I had PRK about 15 years ago) will always have some amount of starbursting.  For most patients (such as myself) this starbursting is not disabling nor a real problem.  In my experience, starbursting does improve for 3 - 6 months.  After six months you will probably not notice much more change in your amount of starbursting although I have seen improvement occur later than six months.|`|un0C52G8aa	This is what scared me away from having this procedure years ago.

Rk46lIBwaa	I try to post an answer to all questions that involve people thinking of using anabolic steroids, in the hope that I might convince one or two of you lunatics not to do it! In the UK at least no steroids can or should be available without a doctor's prescription. They may not be illegal to take, but they do indicate a head in the sand mentality!    It is fascinating to read the reassurances that there are no risks from anabolic steroids, displayed on sites that sell them. They have presumably never had a relative have an early stroke or heart attack.    Side effects of anabolic steroids include : raising blood pressure,raising cholesterol, (both of which increase cardiovascular disease), physical damage to the heart itself, premature baldness, liver damage, the formation of breast tissue in males, liver damage, impotence, shrinking of the testicles and infertility. Women can become hairy, develop a deep voice, and growth can be stunted in adolescents. They also increase both aggression and depression.    So if you would like to spend your life as a depressed, short bald guy with small testicles,boobs and impotence who has an heart attack, this is the way for you!|`|Z6ZJTj8laa	these drugs vital to some people they reduce inflammation in a lot of chronic conditions, but taken wrongly they can be dangerous|`|M2II7hPNaa	steroids should only be taken under medical supervision and not just for body building as they can have side effects like agression etc|`|duVTqRM4aa	Even under medical supervision I have seen steroids destroy people's health.

Instead of boosting a person's adrenals they unnaturally flog them with steroids, often making adrenal recovery impossible.  My aunt is a mess from steroids and so is my cousin.

Steroids are of importance to be approved for treatment diseases. and steroids are numerous, some are anabolic, some others are hormones as testosterone and estrogen, some others semisynthetic and others are purely synthetic as Dexamethasone and Prednisone.  sometimes steroid using is life saving if there is an organ transplant or symptomatically used to compensate natural steroids in defficiency diseases. but side effects of any broad acting substance or drug is also broad, so steroids have many undesired side effects mainlly elevation of blood pressure and blood suger, also inducing peptic ulcer and its immunodepressive effect (if used in large doses for long time) that may make the patient very vulnerable to infections and diseases.

QjwBMQbjaa	You need to go and get an x-ray to see if the break is healed at all, you shouldn't have walked on it. The doctor wasn't telling you if for a joke. I broke my ankle in 2 places just 2 days before you and because it wasn't healing right i had to have an operation to insert a metal plate and 7 pins to make it heal in place. You may have done permanent damage by walking on a broken joint and it is worrying that it now hurts more so you need to get it checked and be honest about what you have done.     Other than that you need crutches to take complete weight of the ankle/leg and to keep the leg elevated as much as possible to reduce swelling and encourage good blood flow.|`|IQ3YqAIZaa	U could use crutches to keep the weight off your injured ankle...they are a bit cumbersome but probably the easiest solution. Try to rest as much as possible to ease the pain too. To improve joint mobility when your cast comes off my friend used these compressive joint supports too. A wheelchair will work too but is a pain on public transport.|`|vdIXzX4naa	If it hurts more, then please start using crutches and fast. Keep your cast leg above ground at all times. It will be hard at first but when you get used to it you will do fine and even have fun on crutches.  And have the doctor check it to make sure your bones have not shifted in the cast.    I know how hard it is to deal with casts and crutches and I hope you get well really soon. Love, Kari.|`|So0UXvzyaa	ur going to cause permanant pain if the fracture is set in wrong place now

duVTqRM4aa	Ha ha!  "IF it was, Dr.s would recommend it".    Well Dr.s DO recommend it all the time actually (I've known 2 MDs who have recommended it for a decade).      If you find someone who knows what they are doing, how to prep the water, etc. it can be a miracle therapy.  Overweight people and people with a lot of toxins have outstanding results with this when done properly.  This is a therapy that has been around since ancient times actually.    I agree, excessive use of this is not a good idea.  Once a month is usually the maximum I will recommend.  But I disagree as it DOES NOT take all the good bacteria out.  Many of the practitioners put good bacteria in the water or give it orally afterward.|`|bdc0c1d1aead267282553512169a9932aa	no..if it was Dr's would recommend it.|`|3hrivCvnaa	i think so its just water they use. call a doctor and find out about it.|`|i7oGjwJBaa	if you are not doing it too frequently, yes.  once in a while is a good cleanse to rid some toxins and built up yucky stuff in the colon... but each time you do it you are also destroying some good bacteria in there that your body really needs.  if you do hydro therapy too much you are going to actually do more harm than good because of all the good stuff you're removing along with the bad.|`|1D8tMCYIaa	Some people say that it is not safe because it can cause water toxicity in the body.    I have a friend who works at a colonic center and she hasn't ever seen any medical issues, but that doesn't mean you can rule them out all together.    Some also say that with a trained professional doing the colonic, there will be no issue and you will feel great afterward.     Check out the link.. It states the pros and cons of hydrotherapy.|`|7SmHY4o4aa	It is safe and painless, my ND (Naturopath) recommends it, but not more than once a month. More than that and your colon can't regulate it's flora and fauna as well because it is interrupted. Probiotics are used in the procedure to reintroduce good bacteria into the colon.     It's painless and doesn't require the use of drugs or chemicals.     Here's how the procedure goes:     The patient lies upon a comfortable table. While the patient lies comfortably, the therapist inserts a speculum into the patients rectum. Controlled warm water is infused into the speculum and into the colon. The gentle warm water flows through the colon system cleansing it. This flush of warm water, with internal debris, is then discreetly eliminated. The entire procedure is approximately forty-five minutes.     Sorry if that is too much info..............|`|S6sLOrzWaa	I had hydro colon therapy several months ago, and I didn't feel comfortable during the treatment. It cost me to much and eventually I had to stop because I had polyps in my colon. It could popping or break with a water pressure.    My opinion: Home colon cleansing with natural supplement like   Bowtrol is better and safer option.

When I was younger my parents couldnt leave me alone cus I got panics and that stuff I couldnt even stay in a car or market for a minitue! How I killed my fears? Well one day when I was like 9-10 or maybe 11 I was sleeping and nothing could make me wake up lol (I'm a big sleep lover xD ) so my parents asked me to stay and I was like ok go away and let me sleep lol I dont know how but I didnt care then I got up cooked some food for me played some comp chatted with friends just cuddleing my pets and I didnt EVEN think about something wrong, if ur younger then 11 its ok I think if ur older I still think it will go by age well if ur older then me then I think visit psychiatrist so he/she can tell u more.

You can get the water in the United States too - place a add in your local http://craigslist.com and place a wanted add for 8.5 PH alkaline drinking water.  They can also make the 2.5 PH acidic water used in this video at the Hospital in Japan.    Drinking the alkaline water is one key, the other is the 2.5 PH water applied to the skin disease, and it will go away in around 5 months.    Good Luck !|`|SwKPJRNvaa	much of the itching is dehydration  use coconut butter, or a vitamin E moisturiser to keep your skin cool and hydrated, and the itching should go down.  If will also help the skin stay soft and not break so easily when you scratch it (though you should try not to- its very important)    Vitamin E cream can also help reduce scarring, so the ones you've given yourself will subside|`|6cBca7Rfaa	Try to keep your skin hydrated properly. This will help greatly. If you check out the link below it will show you exactly how to get rid of eczema in as little as 14 days.

AA12385489	Call and ask the Social Security office for information.  They can help you better than anyone on here.|`|t93CQekvaa	my ex boyfriend did get ssi for the same thing. You have to have your doctor fill out the correct paperwork. They will set a court date,but most of the people are turned down the first time. You then have to go back to court. If you get approved they do back pay you. But It takes a few years from what I was told to get your money,because you have to go to court two times. I think they also have you go to there doctors.  But keep in mind ssi is not much. Maybe $600.00 a month or less. Have you ever thought about working from home? Some hotels and airline companies hire people who work from home to make reservations online. 20 20 just did a story on it last week. This way you can stay home,wont have to be around people. And will make more then $600.00 a month.|`|xrm7SKudaa	Let Social Security people determine that by applying.|`|goSI2nAEaa	I would go to my local Soc Security Admin office and talk with them.  I would also look online @ www.socialsecurity.gov and see what the rules/regs have to say.  If they deny, you can also get an atty and apply for benefits through them, you always see the ad's on television for SS Disability Attnys.|`|AA10698898	SSI is an option and they will retro pay back to your application date if you are approved but there is a very long waiting list and it took my son almost 3 years to be approved and you will be turned down at least 3 times before approval. also depending on what state you live in there will be an automatic review of your case and it is possible to be turned down after receiving approval at the state level good luck.|`|fN074HTlaa	I believe you do qualify for SSI checks. If you apply and get turned down, re-apply with your mental health physician's diagnosis as well as all information of the medications prescribed to you.  If you qualify, the back money you recieve dates back to the very first time you applied and was turned down.  The amount of that check for back payments would total the amount that you're awarded each month.  So let's say you are awarded $700.00 each month, and you applied back on January of 2008.  Your back payment check will be  approximately $8,400.|`|3187cafaa9313c5c6575c8397c98a79eaa	This is exactly what you need to do from someone who is collecting SSI, after paying into the system for 21 years. First thing you need to do is to get with your doctor who recommended you file for SSI. He knows you, and your history. He has to write a letter saying that you are unable to work due to your mental illnesses. After you have that letter in hand, then you call Binder&Binder law firm. No BS intended, they did my case and made it easy for me. If you are like me   you will need their help, because you will be required to get alot of paperwork together. Things i was unable to do on my own. they will help you.    BUT, there are guidelines with SSI. If you have not paid in enough or for long enough you may not qualify. In that case you may still qualify for SSDI.     Get your letter, then call Binder & Binder.   If you want help, that's what you will do.    If you qualify, they will back pay you to the date of your original application. It took over a year for my claim to be settled. Listen very carefully. DO NOT FOLLOW THE ADVISE OF THE PEOPLE ON HERE TELLING YOU TO TALK TO SOCIAL SECURITY YOURSELF!!!!!!!!  THEY ARE CLUELES!!!!!  I went that route myself at first and waste over 2 years getting turned down. The evidence i presented using a lawyer was approved the first time. SS is not in the business of approving claims, they will make it as hard as possible to weed out the fakes and liars, which is good. But, if you have a legit claim, you will just spin your wheels trying to get them to "help" you. It's up to you from here!

OGaLQyCWaa	If she has no vision loss, no irritation or pain, she likely has something called a Subconjunctival hemorrhage.  This is essentially a bruise on the white part of the eye.  Usually people get these when they do something called "valsalva."  Anything that causes a strain, coughing, lifting heavy objects, straining while going to the bathroom, etc can cause it.  Make sure her blood pressure is okay.  It will usually resolve on its own like any other bruise.  The speed of healing depends on how much blood leaked.  If things worsen or if her vision decreases, call an eye doctor immediately.  Hope this helps.

fCZKGBjBaa	Removing whatever is causing the allergic reaction is the easiest and most effective treatment. This may be as simple as changing your laundry detergent or as difficult as moving to a new climate or changing jobs.    Prevent dry skin by taking warm (not hot) showers rather than baths. Use a mild soap or body cleanser. Dry yourself very carefully and apply moisturizing skin lotions all over your body. Avoid lotions with fragrances or other irritating substances.    Avoid wearing tight-fitting, rough, or scratchy clothing.    Avoid scratching the rash. If you can't stop yourself from scratching, cover the area with a dressing. Wear gloves at night to minimize skin damage from scratching.    Anything that causes sweating can irritate the rash. Avoid strenuous exercise during a flare.    If the allergy-causing agent cannot be removed or identified, the next step is to lessen the allergic inflammatory response.        * Apply an nonprescription steroid cream (hydrocortisone) along with anti-itching lotion (menthol/camphor, such as calamine). The cream must be applied as often as possible without skipping days until the rash is gone.        * Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) in pill form may be taken for the itching. Caution - this medication may make you too drowsy to drive a car or operate machinery safely.        * Clean the area with a hypoallergenic soap every day. Apply lubricating cream or lotion after washing.    Avoid physical and mental stress. Eating right, light activity, and adequate sleep will help you stay healthy, which can help prevent flares.    Do not expect a quick response. Eczema is easier to control than cure.|`|tDaU7eYXaa	Vaseline (petroleum jelly) REALLY helps. The same stuff happens to me and lotion DOES NOT help. You should put it on before bed. On ure face, hands, body. My skin is bad because I don't like lotion. So put on petroleum jelly as a quick fix. Then find the right lotion for u. Not all lotion is for everybody. If ure REALLY desperate, there is skin cream that can get prescribed.    And just for the record, Vick's (the stuff u put on ure chest for congestion) is great for bug bites.|`|BVqCcqOGaa	Try herbal remedies from serenaskin.com, it's natural, no steroids. I used ointment and spray on the skin and now just take anti-eczema extract to prevent flare-ups. It works very well for me. My skin is clean for more than 9 mo now.|`|6ZmiuwWDaa	Another great way to control your eczema through diet is by adopting a healthy skin eating plan. A diet rich in nutrients, antioxidants, and water will definitely help support optimal skin function. And when your overall skin health is good your eczema outbreaks will naturally lessen, however, you must understand which foods are causing the flare ups, in order to avoid future irritations, you can't cure Eczema, it will always be there (I have it, and no rashes or anything left, but I still feel it when I choose the wrong foods, the need to itch, it is the Eczema, an allergic reaction that causes chemistry in the blood to an outcome for the individual to itch), but you can identify the food that is causing the outbreaks, and evade them. Have you considered stopping to eat Dairy? such as cheeses, for me these have been the cornerstone to my itching, I avoided them, and find myself somewhat cured now, however my Eczema is still present, as from time to time I find myself having the need to itch whenever I eat too much of the Dairy foods like I said before.  Sugary foods can also cause flare ups, and stress is another main factor, the cold weather will not help with the Eczema rashes indeed, This is where *you* may actually need to use skin products to assist with the rash, as it is harsh times to have it.   You need to let the flare ups you have now, heal and lessen by both avoiding those foods which cause the reactions, this supported by a skin healthy diet, will prevent future outbreaks of the Eczema.    I do not want to give you any other advice, as the user Nicole P, her advice is helpful enough.  However, I can add that I did not use any products to get rid of my rash, (On my legs, calves, thighs) but merely identifying the source which causes the outbreaks, avoiding it, adopting a change in diet, and the rash itself healed, it was that easy, no skin products, just a new diet, time, and it went away, the problem I have now however, is that stress can still cause it for me, other than that, I am fine with avoiding those darn cheeses.

If the little paper is missing completely you may have been given a placebo, although that sounds unlikely if you're given this medicine as an anti-seizure means.    However, Lamotrigine is also a mood stabilizer. In that case I can imagine that a confusion may have occured on the doctors side. It's not uncommon for mood stabilizers to be replaced with placebos. A placebo is a 'hoax' medicine to make people with psychological problems 'think' they have the real medicine.    If you want to be sure, take it to a different doctor (prefebly a different clinic as a doctor always denies a placebo) or a phramacy to have it identified. In that case you can be sure.    Again, I'd find it unlikely they give placebos to an epileptic patient unless they confused you for needing mood stabilizers. It's probably another brand or a different medicine altogether. There's usually more then one medicine for a same problem.|`|rApLHbmWaa	Our lamictal is the peach color but that doesn't mean there is no white.

Because of this our pharmacy is no longer aloud to identify any drug unless you got it filled at our store. We have to tell everyone to call poison control for identification of a drug.  If your pharmacy is closed that may be a quick solution. the nationwide toll free   for poison control is 1-800-222-1222.  Also Look every paper that you got from the drug store to see if they have put a sticker somewhere that says it may be a different color than you normally get.  If you wait until your drug store is open, they will quickly be able to tell you if this is the brand the have gotten in this time.

8VEEihaqaa	UTI's are precursors to a much more serious problem.  UTI is used to describe any kind of infection of the urinary tract, whether it's a bladder infection or a kidney infection.  And yes, it does sound like you have a UTI.    UTI's usually start off as bladder infections, but if left untreated for some time it can travel all the way to your kidneys which could be the persistent pain you feel (is it in your lower back?  If so, then it's probably your kidneys.  Since you said it's in your side, it's more likely a bladder infection).    The most common cause of UTI's is not properly cleaning yourself after sex, or not properly wiping after using the bathroom.  To help prevent future UTI's, always empty your bladder (pee) before bed and after sex, always wipe yourself from front to back, and as an extra precaution, either drink some cranberry juice on a regular basis (it's good for your kidneys) or take some cranberry tablets.    In order to get rid of it now, you have to go to the doctor.  They'll ask you to pee in a cup, possibly do a culture swab, and in the end should send you home with about a weeks worth of antibiotics.  Don't worry about the short med time, it should start to feel better after a few days, but it's very important that you take ALL medication prescribed to you, to lessen the risk of relapse so soon.|`|bbn2YvrKaa	Urinary tract infections (UTI's) are caused by bacteria getting into your urinary tract (usually the bladder). The bacteria usually gets in through your urethra (tube that the urine exits your bladder through.    It's possible to get a kidney infection if the bacteria travels up the ureters (tubes that connect your kidney to your bladder).    Usually they are treated with antibiotics. Sometimes they can go away on their own. Some people are more prone to UTI's than others. Some people say that drinking cranberry juice helps to limit the number of infections.    If you think you have a UTI then you should see your doctor.|`|tZx0FPVtaa	I just had UTI recently, and your symptoms sound a lot like what I had. I highly suggest you go to your doctor and get medication as soon as possible; it can get very serious if not treated, and does not go away on it's own.    From what I understand, UTI is bacteria in you urinary tract. It's often caused by not eating enough vegetables or drinking enough water, as well as wiping from the back to the front after you urinate, which according to my doctor 'brings bacteria into the urethra.'    Evidently, the bacteria can get in through either your bladder or your kidney. There is also another type of UTI called a kidney infection, though wikipedia is not clear on the difference in symptoms. Your doctor can tell you more about this.|`|duCCmCMxaa	you have to go to the doctor and get mdedication. they help alot.
IgztWp0uaa	It is usually a wheat ALLERGY, not intolerance. Allergies are histamine mediated and you can react to any part of the wheat plant itself, not just the protein, which is what gluten in wheat is. That means you react to wheat sugars and starches as well as the gluten.    Gluten intolerance or celiac disease is an autoimmune reaction to the sticky protein that is found in the grain/seed of all members of the tribe Triticeae. This includes wheat, barley, rye, spelt, triticale, durhum, seminola,etc. Go here for more info on that:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triticeae  In theory, a person with gluten intolerance should be able to eat any part of the wheat plant that does not contain the grain, such as the stalk and leaves since all they react to is the protein.     A food product that is gluten free may not necessarily be wheat free. Some countries allow non-gluten containing portions of plants to be used in gluten free foods. An example of this is wheat grass or wheat sugar, which in the UK is considered ok for celiacs as the wheat grain isn't used to make those products. In the US, those products are not considered to be gluten free and are not allowed to be used in gluten free products!|`|zTeW6BIIaa	gluten is in wheat.     so i assume you could be gluten intolerant but not wheat intolerant.     but again, i'm not sure.     hope this helps?|`|YjOjWU0Jaa	Gluten is a specific protein that some people cannot handle digesting.  Wheat, obviously, is made up of lots of different things including, but not limited to, of course, gluten.  So, a wheat intolerance can be caused by an intolerance of gluten, or possibly an intolerance of something else that is in wheat (some other protein, special sugar, or whatever).  So, you can say that a gluten intolerance includes a wheat intolerance, but a wheat intolerance doesn't necessarily include a gluten intolerance.    Then again, there are wheat products that do not include gluten, so in that case a gluten-intolerant person would be able to digest wheat products.  However, that's a special case that is only possible via science, so it stands alone as an exception.

But a mere couple of years later when I married I wanted at least two kids.  It was a driving thing.  I now have three children and eight grand children.  You might want to just continue as you are with your precautions and let time run it's course.  It's a lady's prerogative to change her mind and you just might.  Good luck to you.  Oh, I'm glad I changed my outlook, those five girls and three boys are what brought me through 2 major heart attacks.  Good luck to you and give it some really serious thought before you decide.

There is always the possibility that you could change your mind in the future, even though you might be very sure of your decision right now.    It is quite difficult to reverse a tubal ligation, so docs don't want to do a ligation until they're very sure you won't change your mind.|`|Zj8JkvX1aa	Yes.   I have an IUD.

ETcBRko3aa	What level of Lithium is in your bloodstream?  Most doctors say that your blood levels should be between 0.8 and 1.1 for Lithium to be working.  You may need more.    My lithium level is maintained at 0.9 for me to "feel right."    Also, Lithium may not work for you.  Some people do not respond to lithium and need to try other drugs, like Depakote or Abilify.    Find out what your blood level is and make sure it is in the thereupetic range.  If it is ask, your doctor about changing medications.|`|niVQkQ35aa	You haven't been on lithium long enough to develop a tolerance.  You may not be at a therapeutic dose yet.  It has to be at a high enough level in your blood to be the most effective.  If you're not experiencing any relief, talk to your doctor about increasing your dose.  There are other medications that you can take as well.

By the time I was 7 I was a regular smoker, and have never looked back.    I remember we were at my grandparents house one time when I was 6 and my mom sent me to get her a cigarette. I came back in the room smoking it, and everyone was so surprised, but they all said it was adorable and that I smoked really well. So, I got to go around and light a cigarette for everyone, and I inhaled puff after puff for what seemed like hours. I got really dizzy from it, but I didn't get sick!

t8G0ls9uaa	Keep in mind, when you are exercising, you are adding bulk to your muscles, so it's not unusual to feel like you are gaining before you start losing!!!!!!    Okay, now, for a teenager, you are eating the right amount of calories; try to keep it around 1500 for weight loss, but DO NOT get less than 1200.  For women, that might be considered okay, BUT NOT FOR a teenager who is still growing (shame on the person who told you that was too much for your age without knowing what they were talking about and contributing to possible eating disorders in teenagers).  Not eating enough can screw up your entire metabolism, making weight a constant life issue!!!    However, calories are not the only determining factor:  if you are eating 1500 calories but say 95 fat grams, you are not going to lose weight.  You need to check various sites, but I'm gonna guess your intake of fat grams to lose weight should be around 35-40.  (Educated guess and just for informational purposes, so google it or ask a doctor!!)    Also, make sure most of that fat is NOT saturated fat.    If you are buying fluffy desserts and snacks marked as "low-fat" you are still going to struggle.  Keep it to fruits and veggies for snacks and dessert, and since going cold-turkey is too hard, allow yourself a reward on say Saturday or Sunday that you can have any treat you want for being good the rest of the week.    Your exercise is fine, but try pilates or something that can target core stomach muscles.    Ignore the person that says exercise is not important.  Exercise is more important than diet at the maintenance level.  Anyone who exercises in moderation regularly knows they don't even have to diet; they can pretty much eat what they want, in moderation.  But, it takes a healthy balance.  Check some websites; importance of exercise is well-documented, not just for weight, but for MANY health reasons.    You are doing fine and give yourself some more time.   You might want to ask your parents to schedule you a doctor's appointment to get a full check up to make sure there's no underlying medical conditions going on in your stomach and to have a doctor help you put together the best, healthy plan for you!!!!!!!    And, finally, your weight and height do not seem terribly out of proportion, okay?  I'm sure when you look in the mirror you might like to have a flatter stomach, so find exercises you can do at home to work on that, but don't stress so much.    This is just a bunch of random thoughts, mostly because the answers you've had so far are so far out in left field (ETA:  okay, a few good answers have popped up since I first started typing this).  Good luck!|`|j4rirb8laa	just keep going. if you had dthe mind for it you can do it|`|4W8fHj5Gaa	The elyptical is clearly not working for you. Start running or biking and slowly work your way up, until you are running a mile or more each day, or are biking 4 miles or more each day. Keep eating healthy foods, this is very good for you and will pay off. I have always stayed skinny and I eat mostly progresso/healthy choice soups for lunch and dinner with eggs in the morning and I eat fruit for snacks inbetween. Stop drinking sodas and instead drink juice, water, milk, and gatorade/poweraid.     Losing weight and staying in good shape will take time. Don't expect to immediately drop all of your pounds. If you have the will power to keep up the routine I have layed out before you every day for a few months, you will notice a significant change. Besides slimming you down working out will make you feel immensely better each day and will help to improve your clarity of thought believe it or not.    I would take a picture of yourself now in a swimming suit from a few angles and then look back at the pictures a month or two from now as a motivator that shows you are changing how you look.     Let me remind you once again DO NOT USE THE ELYPTICAL, if you keep it up you WILL NOT see changes. Also lack of eating will make it impossible for you to workout. Make sure you don't stop eating or you will face serious, possibly deadly, health issues.    I wish you best of luck in your goal.|`|RumoQkohaa	Don't worry about how much you eat...I can't stress this enough.  Its all about what you eat that makes the difference.  First of all, eat fruit and vegetables.  IF you can give up meat, do that as well and cut low on bread.  But if you are still hungry eat a banana or a handful of peanuts.  Also drink a glass of water.  Sometimes your thirsty and you think your hungry.  When you do workouts, try to mix it up.  Walk and do elpitical, bike ride and swim if you can.  You can also lift weights to simulate muscle growth which can lead to increased metabolism.  Other than that the biggest thing is don't worry too much.  If your trying your best and you still don't see any difference after about 2 months, talk to your doctor or a personal trainer.  Also don't weigh yourself every day because a little bit of salt in your diet can make your weight go up or down.  This means you might think your gaining weight when your not.  Hope this helps:)|`|uttbqGB9aa	Ok..Im gonna repeat this plan.    First a couple of notes:    You are still young, so your body needs more calories than adults even if you are gaining weight, because your weight WILL fluxuate over the next couple of years.    You CAN do something about it though, just make sure you keep yourself nutritionally maintained.    First, Lets say you are 130 pounds, that means it probally takes about 14-15 hundred  calories to just maintain your body weight, anything over that is adding to your weight.     If you are not a very active person, then you are bound to keep gaining weight.    1) Grab a calorie log book, or make one.   You will need to keep track of EVERYTHING you eat. Believe me, calories add up quick when you are actually counting them.    2) Set a weightloss goal for yourself. If your ideal weight is 115 pounds then lets say that you need to lose 15 pounds and that is your goal    3) Begin a workout routine. If you are not used to working out, start out the first week walking briskly for about a mile or so. Then start to jog and alternante with brisk walking when you get out of breath.    4) Start cutting out soda, excessive bread and carbs, and eat really clean and healthy (i.e. veggies, fruit, poultry) STAY AWAY FROM HAM AND RED MEATS for awhile.    5) Drink lots of water throughout the week to keep yourself hydrated and see actuall fat loss.    ** The first week you drink  a lot of water, you might find that at the end of the week when you weigh yourself, that you actually gained some weight, don't worry, this is water weight. You will want to keep drinking lots of water because when you weigh yourself the second week, whatever weight you lost will be mostly all fat loss since you are retaining water. People commonly mislead themselves when they lose weight because they lose mostly water weightm then get upset when they gain weight back so fast.    6) Cut out any nasty habits to complete your healthy weight loss routine.    You will soon see your body completely transform...not only will you look amazing but even your hair and nails and skin will look healthy and beautiful.    Good luck! You can do it :)|`|rLsphyqhaa	Come on please you are only 14 and becoming a young woman in more ways than you think. It sounds as if you are eating right for the most part and working out. Now keep in mind that working out cn and does put more muscle on you and it weighs more than fat alone does. It is also going to make you look bigger, think about AS or other body builders. They work out with weights to not only build up the muscles and some do it also for the strengh. in your case keep you body well toned keep eating right. Cut out all the junk food. Chips fries, soda's drink water mostly or fruit juices. This will help with your complexion. I would stay away fro the diet pills my wife takes them all the time and she is 44 now days. I got her a bike a few years ago, she could only go about a mile or two now is up to going as much as 20 miles at a time. has gone from 172 down to around 125 or 130 depend on the time of month. It has helped her stress stay down, and is much better to get a long with most times again that goes with the time of month. One does not need the membership's. you can do a lot on your own. Get a step ladder and mark it and climb up say four steps and back down. Do this about five times. Get some ankle weights, walks and work up to a run. Short one then make it longer. Go into the local mall walk with the mall walkers. Window shop. We do it on the back roads. She likes to see the wildlife as do I. to us it is much better and prettier. You get the fresh air, she points out cans that i pick up an turn in later. It is a win win all the way around|`|OCHhJWpHaa	i think u need to lower ur calories...its not nessessary to eat way up to 1200 calories.... u can simply cut down on eating.... and its good to hear u're eating whole wheat... just need to have faith in urself more..it'll work out...well..not as fast as u think...but sure it will=D|`|WHmTmAb1aa	Well my suggestion works, but its not entirely healthly. No permanent damage just stomach pains. THIS WILL WORK THOUGH! When you wake up take some vitamens this will allow you to stay healthy, then I want you to drink water everytime your hungry. (water can fill you up and release the feeling of hunger) I also want you to chew gum, the act of chewing is a mechanical signal for you stomach to start churning, when doing so you body will use the excess fat on your body. This is really anoyying for the first couple days, but eventually you will lose weight like crazy and you can resume eating. When you do resume eat small portions and then work your way up to big meals. Dont want to strech your stomach to much. Good Luck.....BTW NOOOOOOOOOO CARBS!!!!!!!!! No breads, soda, candy w/e. If you have to eat a crap load of salad with little or no dressing.|`|0eI1OcsQaa	1200 to 1700 calories is TOO Much  Your eating more then you can burn.|`|rAKGHpsPaa	obviously your secretly having snacks.

Stress can be useful to focus your energy. You are having normal stress about this weight. Because you have a Hollywood type obession with a pycho drama for a anorexic body type. Trust me I am a PT expert. I have trained all body mass types in the last 25 years. You are not as fat as you think. It is normal to have a rounded ab area. The six pack ab is just as unhealthy as weak abs are. The six pack ab puts too much strain on the short tendons of the lower back. This has caused many lumbar back strain problems in high stress trainees. Get a grip on this. Health is a combanation of good nutrition good digestion exercise and rest. Sleep more to loose weight. And don't sweat the small stuff like a few extra pounds. Heck, you could wind up on a deserted island and need that extra to survive. That is just as likely as your life depending on loosing 10 pounds.|`|DozD8lTGaa	well i am studying health at College and i done this last week... i have a BMI chart here and i done yours (from your height and weight you gave above) and your BMI is around 24... this means you are not under weight and you are not over weight - so there's no need to worry.     anything below 18 is underweight and anything over 25 is approaching over weight. so your weight for your height is GOOD!    if you 'think' you look 'big' just tone up - no need to diet or stop eating or what ever... find some exercises online (or ask your local gym) to give you a few tips on how to tone up ... horse riding is a good one!

I had plenty of frustrations, cried plenty of times and just felt like giving up. I was overweight my whole life. In 9th grade I was about 5ft tall and weight 140 lbs. I lost quite a bit of weight later in high school, which was great...plus I got taller. Out of high school I started gaining the weight back, plus some after having a baby. I ended up weighing almost 250 lbs at 5ft 6in. I now weigh 150lbs at 5ft 6in, I wear a size 8 in womens or 9/11 in juniors. I did Weight Watchers to lose 110 lbs about 6-7 years ago. For you...DO NOT STOP WHAT YOU ARE DOING! You are doing everything right. The reason you haven't lost much is that it has only been 3 weeks, plus you are gaining muscle. Definitely stick with atleast 30 minutes of cardio daily and eating 1200-1700 calories a day. You are doing everything great...it didn't take you a month to gain this weight, so do not give up. It took me almost 1 1/2 years to lose 110 lbs. I lost weight quicker in the beginning, because I had to much to lose. You don't have that much to lose, so it will take a bit longer to get your metabolism kick started. I understand how you feel about your stomach, it was my worst feature. Now its one of my best. PLEASE STICK WITH THIS. Even tho you may not be losing any weight, your clothes will start to fit better. The muscle that you are gaining wil actually make your metabolism burn more fat faster, so keep it up. You are doing great. Think about how fast time flies, it was just Halloween a few months ago, but its easy for time to fly when you aren't thinkin about it. Stop counting the days. It will be Valentine Day, St Patricks Day, then Easter...they will all be here before you know it and if you keep doing what you are doing, just think about how much weight you will have lost and how much better you will look and feel?! Stop keeping track of numbers, dates, weight, scale, time...etc... Just pay attention to how you feel, you gotta feel proud every time you finish one more work out. Good Luck to you!
I8szWmVMaa	you need antibiotics. You must go to the doctor. Strep throat is a bacterial infection that can cause other problems if not treated correctly.      Feel better
XHvaws8baa	i don't think its weird i feel the same way about snow|`|CD9p5gtLaa	i hate them to.. i love the fall and winter... lack of sunlight .. more darkness|`|HgRYP3cJaa	Nope, I'm the same way.  Love hot weather, but hate the sun.|`|OI7eeIreaa	Totally common for vampires.
9pLdhuBnaa	This does not sound normal.  I would recommend going to the ER, or getting to another doctor for another opinion.
bwJSJ49Oaa	Depends how much you're smoking.  If it's not a lot, do whatever you need to do to get yourself through your difficult stages and don't worry about it too much.  But just be aware in the back of your mind that later on in life, like 20 years down the line or something  - if you've been doing it all that time and it might only last a few years or less anyway- you might start to notice stuff like a bit of brain-deadness.  Don't know anyone elses experiences but mine are this - I used to be really brainy at school, am quite intelligent in general (I think).  But quite often in my everyday life (since I first started smoking it) I do really "blonde" things, totally stupid which I don't realise I've done until afterwards, like airhead things.  Also I'm really sure it's left me much more open to suffering from anxiety and depression.  The scientists are only just starting to discover the effects properly right now so the "facts" are probably changing as we speak.  I'd say don't worry at all about the cigarettes short term.  Yes over many years it might affect you.  Alcohol and expecially the sex is really worrying though.  PLEASE make sure you're not putting yourself in any dangerous situations.  You probably know how many dodgy perverts there are out there who go out especially praying on people in your situation, they become experts at spotting people in your situation and winding their way in there.  A total bunch of evil con-artists.  Please be really bolshy and self confident and really stick up for yourself and don't let the booze or anything or anyone else stop you from being out there for yourself and doing what's best for you and no-one else.|`|Dhz4XgQ3aa	Well cannabis can create mental health problems in people susceptible. If you have a family history of mental illness and schizophrenia, then i would def say you are susceptible!!!!   My second issue us that you say you have become dependant on alcohol. This in itself is a big issue and it might signify the start of something. Why are you dependant? Is it because you feel you cant function without it? Its not a good sign at all and am concerned you have already started a trip down the mental health road. You should seek help for the dependancy and refrain from the cannabis.   Sorry if its not what you want to hear, but if you dont sort out the dependancy you have on alcohol you could become worse and depressed if you arent already.  Its not healthy to be dependant on alcohol honey. Please seek help.|`|f00589104255977086e57a356d925224aa	No.    But be careful.|`|tfeseeeRaa	It seems to me that you already know that your behaviour indicates a tendency to a  level of mental malfunction.  Schizophrenia is a very serious mental/physical condition and you don't have that.    You definitely need some expert advice but I haven't a clue where to go to get it.  Looking deep down into yourself and being brutally honest with yourself might help you to change. It is very difficult to do.  At 16 you are at the point where you are starting on a slippery downward path that may well end up you leading a very squalid life.    I am certain that you will not develop mental health problems because of drug taking. Your mental health problems will drive you to drug consumption.    Help is required. Maybe the starting point is your GP or even a priest.
Z6ZJTj8laa	try an electric tooth brush they work best at keeping tartar at bay one with a small head that gets between the teeth also floss regular that helps too hope this helps.|`|H0ejwZEIaa	You have to see the dentist TWICE A YEAR, it's only healthy.  Do you use mouthwash?  You should brush your teeth after every meal for two minutes at a time.  That tartar could eventually eat away a hole in your teeth.  Try chewing trident xtra care.  It has recaldent which helps build up enamel.|`|SaNSSslmaa	GO TO THE DENTIST ahh you might want to get dental insurance because you have a root canal tartar leads to a root canal ahha good luck chew gumm trident|`|f6c272c9fb75c26074367ea2fd272306aa	The only way to get rid of tartar is to have it scraped off by the dentist, no one likes this but its the only way. Its good that you take care of your teeth but you must get them checked out by a dentist. Build up of tartar will eventually lead to gum disease|`|ToDAqIwIaa	i hate the destist to but sometimes you just have to bear it i had to get this thing in my tooth it was a bit like a filling at first i was petrified and wouldnt get it done after a while it started to get worse and really hurt i went to the dentist and got my filling thing done it wasnt all what i expected it didnt even really hurt

v4gUI96yaa	I used to smoke and it was so hard to stop,i still crave one every now and then and it's been 5 years now. I would try to get them to not start because i know how hard it is to stop,but it is their desion and if you are a smoker it makes it so much harder to convince them not to.|`|42WmRqNoaa	I would be pissed.|`|e81B9pDKaa	No!!!!I'd def try to get them not to|`|IzHfbWtiaa	Good Heavens NO! I smoked for 50 years and now I feel like a junk yard Dog on a chain! Let me explain! After all those years of smoking,I was diagnosed with "COPD" Chronic-Obstructive- Pulmonary-Disease! This disease has caused me to have low Oxygen in my Blood,"Low Blood Oxygen" and I now have to have Oxygen 24/7 and I have a 25 foot tube running from my Oxygen Machine to a Cannula that fits inside my Nose and a trip to the Bathroom means dragging that 25 foot Oxygen tube,which I refer to as my Chain,because where-ever I go the Tube must follow, thus the explanation for feeling like a junk yard Dog! Not only that but if I feel like going out somewhere I have a Tank of Oxygen that I must pull behind me or a back-pack type Oxygen Cylinder! I have to take Advair and Spiriva inhalers and so many more Meds,to many to list here to help me breathe! I can't walk but a few steps because of difficulty in breathing so I have a motorized chair to get out of the House for awhile,and it to is equipped with an Oxygen tank! The possibilities of being admitted to a Hospital for Pneumonia or a severe case of Bronchitis every few months always looms over you,with x-rays and c-a-t scans,ekg's,mri's,blood test,blood Oxygen level test where they put the needle in your artery instead of your vein which is always nice if you love pain! I could name a million reasons why smokers should quit.I did and as many more for one not to ever start! Best wishes and God Bless! I would have said good luck but luck plays no part in this,only the need and perseverance!|`|LgC2oA77aa	not ok, i dont like cancer...|`|nKwcGLQraa	no, i would be like "WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU ARE DOING!!??

qK8wcP2Aaa	i don't think it's cancer. but i dont know your condition either. maybe you did some strenous exercise that week? sit ups, push ups|`|YeR6R8Feaa	its possible, maybe you should go see your doctor to see whats wrong
eCKNRcIVaa	I suggest getting a netti pot.  The brand I use is called sinu cleanse and I bought mine at a CVS, but they have netti pots at rite aid, walmart, and walgreens.  Go to the cold and flu aisle or ask the pharmacist for one.  It will come with a saline solution.  I have a medical condition and cannot take traditonal cold medicines and were it not for using a netti pot I would be completely miserable during a cold.  Also look into buying some Zyrtec antihistamines to help dry it all up, and if you get a sore throat gargle with salt water.  Take vitamin C and drink plenty of water ( or non-cafinated beverages ) but stay away from milk and dairy products as this will only make phlegm and mucus worse

Since you are 18 years old I believe that you have the right to leave, even if they don't want you to. You have to save yourself. But the bonds of family are strong. It's a hard thing to do, but you have obviously recognized that that environment isn't healthy. You may want to consider going to the hospital yourself and get inpatient treatment. It would give you a break and have people focus on your needs. I'm not sure what it would take to do that in your area but you need to 1st help yourself by leaving and 2nd ask for help from professionals.   Also, I don't know enough information to know for sure, but with all that you are dealing with personally, and it sounds like your boyfriend has his own personal issues, I don't think it's healthy right now to have a boyfriend. You can have a good friend but, you need some healing and personal discovery and to tie yourself down right now with all the work that needs to be done will only be an obstacle.

You can use a little lather from unscented soap, then rinse. Baby soap is good.
Yz1pzloSaa	Someone told me that no one really knows. That scientists or optometrists or whatever can't figure out why. Or did I read that on Wikipedia?    Mine are brown and green too, and sometimes they look gold, sometimes they look more brown. They don't change to mostly green though.|`|8cuPVvYnaa	I have hazel eyes that change colors. I've always wanted to know why too. I have wondered if color around the eye (skin color, clothing, makeup) may have anything to do with it. The reason I've wondered is that once when a boy made me blush, everyone said, "Wow, your eyes just suddenly turned blue." It seems when my face is sunburnt they turn blue too.|`|KlXUrxBfaa	Yes they do, why is a good question, green, brown, and a light tint of blue, enjoy the club
f8mLpPXlaa	First off don't listen to the people that tell you dairy products are bad for you. That's just ridiculous. Drink plenty of fluids mostly water but some fruit juices should be thrown in there too. Tea, hot chocolate are good because they will stimulate a cough. Yeah, I know that's what you're trying to avoid but you can make it easier to cough up or you can make harder. Hot steamy showers or baths will do you good too.Go ahead and eat what you like as long as it doesn't upset your stomach. Avoid alcohol like the plague.It will not do any good and will more likely cause harm.  Mucinex is a good OTC medicine. In addition to whatever your doctor ordered you should be fine soon.  God bless and help you through this.|`|FyIcIzIoaa	plenty f juices and water,keep your meals light,a heavy tummy can cause the diapragham push up on your lungs. they use to say milk would make your mucous harder to cough out,but have backed off that some. mucinex helps you clear,if its turing yellow and impending your breathing you need to see a doc
ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have  to work double on them. The best approach is this:  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal  weight, lower for overweight).  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.   Side Lunge Slide  Stand with feet hip-width apart, left foot resting on a paper plate.  Bend the right leg while sliding the left foot to the side, torso  upright and abs in. Slowly slide left foot back to starting position,  repeating 8-12 times. Switch legs and repeat for 2-3 sets.    Lunge Slide  Stand with feet hip-width apart, left foot resting on a paper plate.  Bend the right leg while sliding the left foot back into a lunge  position, keeping the right knee behind the toe, torso upright and abs  in. Slowly slide left foot back to starting position and repeat 8-12  times. Switch legs and repeat on each leg for 2-3 sets.    Front One-Legged Squat  Stand on a step or small platform. Lift left leg out in front of step  and bend the right leg, bringing the toe of the left foot to the  floor. Touch the floor lightly and keep the knee of the bent leg in  line with toes. Straighten the right leg and repeat 8-12 times. Switch  legs and repeat for 2-3 sets.    Chair Squat  Stand in front of a chair with feet hip-width apart, abs in and torso  straight. Slowly bend your knees and lower and until you're almost  touching your butt to the chair. Hold for 2-3 seconds, knees behind  the toes, and straighten. Repeat for 12-16 reps, 2-3 sets.    Heel Drops with Leg Extension  Stand on step or platform with left leg on the step, right leg  hanging off the side. Bend the left leg and lower the right foot  towards the floor (a few inches). Straighten the left leg and bring  the right leg out to the side, foot flexed, in a leg extension. Repeat  8-12 times, switch legs for 2-3 sets.    Hip Extension  On a flat or inclined step or platform, lie facedown with hips on the  edge of the step, legs straight out behind you with toes resting  lightly on the floor. Squeeze the glutes and hamstrings and straighten  the legs until they are level with the hips. Hold for 2-3 seconds, and  lower letting toes lightly touch the floor.

n7KCez59aa	Hi !    That sounds like adrenaline to me; the secretion of an endocrine gland that is transmitted by the blood to the tissue on which it has a specific effect.  Most people will have a rush of adrenaline due to music, stress or coldness. Ever wonder why people listen to music while they work out, it keeps them pumped up, energized.
ozmRtpMyaa	yes, it is.  you should go to a doctor.  any virus is contagious, but bronchitis is extremely so mostly due to the coughing (and especially since you did kiss him).

1MtKEdvHaa	perhaps depression. the symptoms you listed could be alot of things, but id say its most likely a mental thing and not a physical. depression can release hormones into the body that obviously make you more emoional, or less. plus it can mess around with sleep patterns. backaches can be due to alot of things, but i dont know if that would be from depression, ive heard stories though before that mental illnesses can cause physical pain due to he release of certain hormones. id go get checked out by a doctor first to make sure its nothing physical. i hope this helps.|`|CfUVG6IYaa	You sound depressed:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_af...

I decided to sleep the whole weekend,Fri,Sat Sun Nonstop,Did me a lot of good.|`|wwLPJaz9aa	Is it a possibility that you are pregnant? Hormones can go nuts during pregnancy and can cause all sorts of issues.    Also, fatigue, indecisiveness and inexplicable physical pain are also signs of depression. If you don't feel like any of aspect of your life is stressful, the symptoms that you have described may be a manifestation of a chemical imbalance that causes depression.  There are many screening tests online:    http://discoveryhealth.queendom.com/depr...    http://www.depression-screening.org/scre...    http://www.halfofus.com/    If you feel that you might be depressed, I encourage you to take one of these quizzes. If the quiz seems to indicated that you may have depression, seek help. There's no shame in getting help for depression.    I hope this helps.|`|yLq6PZ9Paa	Everyone, I'm sure, will ask this:  Could you be pregnant?  If not, Whatever you do, don't let anyone tell you that you need anti-depressant drugs.  First try changing your diet.  Reduce your sweets and white flour.  Also, excersise.  You don't have to join a gym.  Just move and stretch that back out more.  Run in place (while watching your favorite TV program), or try a hula hoop for 5 minutes.  You would be amazed what this does for you!  Exercise raises your endorphin(sp?) level, which gets rid of those "crying for no reason" spells.   Hang in there.

xb0qmxxWaa	Ok. first off you should be askin this at hhp (racoon.com) but I can help ya out...    You have type 1... most likely coldsores, but you don't know that for sure since you've never had an outbreak. you could have it genitally. And you also said you have type 2, so thats most likely genitally. but in the same account, you could have type 1 and type 2 genitally since having one type does not provide immunity from aquiring the other type. Alot of people have type 1 genitally and type 2 genitally simultaneously.    If you gave a guy a ******** then had sex it is not likely you reinfected yourself in a different location, since you already have antibodies to fight off the virus, unless it was a new infection and your body has not built up enough antibodies. but  he could have had type 2 genitally and passed type 2 to you.    Say if someone only had type 1 and not at all have type 2. they at no point can transfer type 2, because they don't have type 2... even if it is on their genitals, type 1 will NEVER turn into type 2. and type 2 will never turn into type 1.     Even if you did have type 1 on your genitals, it is so unlikely for it to spread genitally to begin with. the main reason people get type 1 genitally is from oral sex from a partner who gets coldsores (type 1).    i hope this helps, but i think i know who you are on hhp... so don't be afraid to ask this question there again, because i think i've seen you ask it twice before on their... i know it is very confusing, but the people at hhp will continue to help you if you are confused still.|`|m3VcQ8A4aa	You said u were positive for type 2 and also have type 1, therefore, u have type one (usual oral cold sores) and type two (genital herpes). If the person you had oral sex with does not have either HSV1 or HSV2 and you had cold sores at the time you could give him HSV1 down below.  However, if you had an HSV2 outbreak also then I guess you are more likely to give HSV2 to his genitals as it prefers to go there.  The types are set, type 1 is 1 and 2 is 2, and one cannot change into the other.   If you have 1 you can get 2 also (as you have)  but if you only have 2 you are less likely to ever get 1.  Hope this helps!!
iYPRWaHsaa	First of all, I don't think that race should be a factor in the school you attend, but I can see why you would want to fit in. Look around in your area for a school that you want to go to. You may be surprised, and you may find a school that's a good fit and is in your area. If not, talk to your mother about why she doesn't want you to go to that school. She probably has a good reason for not wanting you to go. Does the school cost money? That could be a factor. If so, look into scholarships. In the end though, you may just have to listen to your mother. I hope this helps and you get what you want! :)|`|hijrEfXzaa	tell her all of that and look up the ISAT or SAT or whatever tests u take and compare the results with both schools see how that works out|`|XByFpkrwaa	Maybe you should learn your place in this world.

So, I am currently 20, and i have had depression and been suicidal on and off since i was your age. Antidepressants help, exercise helps, friends help. Distract yourself. Watch tv shows and read books,  set goals for yourself, and avoid being alone without something to do. Dont let yourself think about it. See a Shrink. I know it is no fun, and i was terrified to do it at first, but just talk to them, or talk to a suicide hotline 1-800-SUICIDE (1-800-784-2433) or 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255).    good luck. talk to someone.|`|Lnt4u4q6aa	IS IT TIME TO KILL YOURSELF ?    geez, it is time to go to the hospital and tell them you need help because you are having these thoughts.  they can get you help|`|NTEwg7Syaa	so you have that empty feeling inside of you that says, " why should i even be alive right now?" i think your in a state of depression...i think you need to seek help from your family if u can't do that go to a person u trust (i suggest an adult) and talk about it, also i advice you to see a doctor
lhOd2hvXaa	It's perfectly normal for your ears to pop (or feel "full" or even hurt) when you have strep throat.      Your eustation tubes are a direct link between your throat and your middle ear and with the throat inflammation (caused by the strep) they are doing their job trying to equalize pressure in your ears.    Hope this helps (and hope you feel better soon!)|`|FKq6L4gdaa	Yea...if u have an ear infection...    i was sick and i had a stomach virus, but my ears kept popping too. It kept doing this even after i cleaned them and everything. The docotr said i had an ear infection, which will just go away after some time. idk whther u can get it from other colds, but cuz u have it while u have strep throat, and i had while i had a stomach virus, it kinda looks like it.     but u only have it if its popping uncontrollably, and even after u pop it like 20 times, u still need to pop it.    Hope this helped!! :]]

mU5hUdKpaa	there's your problem- you smokedd TOO much hookah! Lol, f you aren't used to smoking cigarettes, hookah makes you buzz really hard, so you probably smoke too much of it. Also, the mixture of weed and alcohol in your system probably didn't help much either. You still feel weird today because you are on a hangover. Not an alcohol one, but a hookah one. Lol I know it sounds weird but its true. Same thing happened to me when I smoked too much weed. You'll feel fine tomorrow|`|fvuEtkROaa	What is "hooka" as you  put it ?  In Egypt, it is a water pipe in which many things can be smoked.  Over there, it  is typically molasses. Certainly two hours of anything like that could be a problem.  Use a little common sense next time.... and find out what was in that pipe !|`|r1nKp9ELaa	hookah usually makes you feel light headed and 2 hours is a long time! im not surprised that you fainted. but just to fill you in o whats happening...your brain isnt getting the  oxygen it needs because your constantly breathing in smoke, not pure air. the weed(even though it wasnt much) probably didnt help either.  you cant die from it but i wouldnt suggest doing ti again|`|fAKKv0ytaa	dude, it was a mix of all three that f'd you up, but duh if you smoke a lot at one time and your not use to smoking of course your gonna get sick.

VWNiOxcvaa	Just because eye exercises don't improve eyesight doesn't mean we can't have natural perfect eyesight. Eye exercises have nothing to do with the principles of natural perfect eyesight.    Most people can return to natural perfect eyesight by unlearning the incorrect vision habits, reintegrating the correct vision behaviors, and undoing the damage of artificial corrections and blur.    Nutrition is important, but will not change the way we use our eyes, mind and body together.    The best way to start learning about Natural Eyesight Improvement is to read the best books. I have a referral link to one of them on my website. Most people do best by getting the help of a local teacher. I can interview a teacher you may be interested in to make sure that they are teaching correct principles and not eye exercises or potions.|`|c65fb963b3da6c519b15451a2e627eecaa	Glasses, contact lenses, surgery.

3PWjDpFsaa	Have you heard the saying, "What you focus on expands"  Everyone has problems but focus on the good things in life.  I used to be in your position and was very insecure when I was 17.  Over the years I have read motivational books and listened to motivational C.D's to help me build my self confidence.  No matter what the situation, I look for the good in life.  I used to ask my self defeating questions such as "why is this happening to me?"  Now when a negative situation comes up my question is, "What can I do to resolve this, what actions can I take?  These are more empowering questions than "Why do bad things happen to me."    The worst case scenerio very  rarely happens.  I have a new definition of fear that you may of not heard before, it is: False Evidence That Appears Real.      How many bad things you have thought about actually happen?  Probably very little.      When I am stressed, I meditate even briefly.  I close my eyes, take a deep breath and focus on my breathing for a few minutes.  I also visualize myself lying on a beautiful beach.  You can rent or buy meditation C.D's.      Another thing is to take your mind off your negative thinking by going to funny movies, read uplifting books, look at comedies, socialize with friends.  This will put you in a more positive frame of mind.  Look in your library or book store for the self help section and you will find many positive motivational books.    These are just a few suggestions I can offer.      I find physical exercise is great for stress too. Going for a brisk walk and repeating positive phrases is great too. Sometimes when I am stressed I will go for a brisk walk and repeat phrases I learned from a Tony Robbins C.D. I say in rhythm to my walking, "Every day and every way I'm feeling happier and happier, yes!" I may change the phrase as well by saying "Every day and every way I'm feeling better and better yes." I also touch each of my fingertips while saying this while walking as it "anchors" it to my subconscious mind.    I also have a gratitude list and write what I'm grateful for even when I'm not feeling grateful.    I hope this is helpful,    Good Luck,    Michelle,    http://www.stressandyourhealth.org|`|HgRYP3cJaa	17's a hard age to be. you're expected to know what you want to do with the rest of your life. stress is a natural part of that. take one hurdle at a time and realize everyone feels the same at one time of another.  remember to take time out to just chill and to enjoy being 17.|`|pvJH5HQ5aa	When your feeling Streesed, Let someone know.

jluJbuF7aa	here is a healthy way to calculate:      allow yourself 100 pounds for being 5 feet tall as a female and then add AT LEAST 5 pounds per inch over 5 feet - so if you were 5'7" you should weigh at least 135.  but 110 is very thin.  a good range for you would be 110-125.  and keep in mind you are still growing!|`|2VZ1Mjqgaa	To answer your BMI you should use this calculator:  http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/    Yes, it is normal that your boobs get bigger after your period.

8OqdoIHtaa	Get a tote bag with a zippered pocket or a purse with a zipper top. Put your meter kit bag in there, your glucose tablets, your keys and a wallet. You should have room for a couple of other things, like a snack and a bottle of water. Its very important to stay hydrated when you are diabetic.     You need to carry this stuff with you at all times and you shouldn't worry about hiding it. If you are in school, you could find a small backpack style purse to keep everything in. There are plenty of cool designs you can choose from. There are even bags and cases made just for diabetics, and some are cool, some are funky, some are pretty. Whatever your style, I'm sure you can find something online. There are links below, start surfing!     Keep in mind, that in summer, both your test strips and insulin must be kept from heat, and in winter, protected from freezing. Don't leave them in the car where they will be subjected to extreme temperatures.     Pay attention to what you need to carry now, and what you might need to add in the future, and what pockets are provided.       http://www.diabetesandmore.com/Bags-Purs...    http://www.diabetesandmore.com/Bags-W32....

3lPL6pVBaa	The thing is . . . when you have a panic attack, it means that nothing's wrong.      In other words, 'panic attack' means that you feel anxiety even though everything is fine and there is no danger at all.      In other words, the anxiety is real, but the danger isn't.      And that's a good.  If there is no real danger, then you have nothing to worry about. :)        And now you're not even having panic attacks, so . . . even better. :)        Just relax and have a cup of herbal tea.  Then call her and tell her you're feeling much better.|`|acOzcA9Oaa	They sound like panic attacks to me. I don't have the same attack symptoms as you, but the feeling of not being able to breathe is a very common panic attack symptom. You could have PMDD, which would explain why your attacks only occur around your period. I would recommend talking to your GYN to see if they can help you any. Here's a site that explains what PMDD is:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premenstrua...|`|up363TZyaa	i think you're having a panic attack in this question !!!!    Calm down. No, i think what you're describing sounds exactly like a panic attack, i can't breathe when i have panic attacks, too.     everybody gets anxiety sometimes. i think you are fine. and you don't have to have a panic attack just cause you got your period.|`|Z9aEClXnaa	tell you psychologist that you think he /she misdiagnosed you. tell him how you been feeling lately after the meds you been taking if thats what you been taking. he should tell you if he did or not. also ask your doctor. he may say he didnt when he really did.|`|MuXq9x2Oaa	sounds like a panic attack to me.     if you are worried bout your period you need to go to the GP for a diagnosis|`|70c1c2e410f2cdd8e3cd8235784e9689aa	Yes, psychologists can be wrong.  Here's what I'd do:  Since you are not a danger to yourself or others, and a panic attack won't actually kill you, I'd wait and see what happens. Maybe it was a case of a cold about to come on or maybe you were under a lot of stress.  Or maybe it was a panic attack and it won't happen again.  I go through periods where I get little ones here and there. It's not really interfering with my life and i know it won't hurt me, so I just take that as a sign that I need to slow down a bit.|`|B4YESGmwaa	Panic attacks come and go unannounced and they do not always have to be tied to an event-in other words you don't have to have something bad happen then you have an panic or anxiety attack. It can be something good, or even extremely funny. You don't say how old you are now. But I have never heard of these symptoms being connected to your period.   Like many other sciences psychology is not always an exact science-it is based on the information you provide to the doctor. I would at least call the doctors office and express your concerns and discuss the idea of coming back in the event of another anxiety attack. Did the doctor put you on medication

9d60a294b6864b585406ddb61a14d757aa	As is obvious, there is a difference of 3.00 diopters.  The difference between  a person with zero prescription and a person with -3.00 is also 3.00 diopters.  But, comparatively speaking, there is a BIG difference between these two examples.  That is because there would be a VERY noticeable difference in the functional ability of the patients in the zero / -3.00 case.  In regard to you and your mother, though, there is very little noticeable functional difference between what you can see and what your mother can see.    For example, you would easily be able to notice the difference in weight if I placed a 3 pound weight in one of your hands and no weight in the other.  Now if I place a 100 lb. weight in one of your hands and a 103 lb weight in the other there would be very little noticeable difference.    Once a person reaches about a -5.00 power there really isn't that great a functional difference as the prescription gets stronger.  So you really can't go by "every 1 number equals what?"  As the prescription gets stronger the resultant loss in visual function gets less and less noticeable.|`|un0C52G8aa	Actually, your prescription will not improve when you get into your 40s.

eQqhFv9yaa	Symptoms include:  Once exposed to the virus, there is an incubation period that generally lasts 3 to 7 days before a lesion develops. During this time, there are no symptoms and the virus cannot be transmitted to others. An outbreak usually begins within two weeks of initial infection and manifests as an itching or tingling sensation followed by redness of the skin. Finally, a blister forms. The blisters and subsequent ulcers that form when the blisters break, are usually very painful to touch and may last from 7 days to 2 weeks. The infection is definitely contagious from the time of itching to the time of complete healing of the ulcer, usually within 2-4 weeks. However, as noted above, infected individuals can also transmit the virus to their sex partners in the absence of a recognized outbreak.    Diagnosed by:  Genital herpes is suspected when multiple painful blisters occur in a sexually exposed area. During the initial outbreak, fluid from the blisters may be sent to the laboratory to try and culture the virus, but cultures only return a positive result in about 50% of those infected In other words, a negative test result from a blister is not as helpful as a positive test result, because the test may be a false-negative test. However, if a sample of a fluid-filled blister (in the early stage before it dries up and crusts) tests positive for herpes, the test result is very reliable. Cultures taken during an initial outbreak of the condition are more likely to be positive for the presence of HSV than cultures from subsequent outbreaks.     There are also blood tests that can detect antibodies to the herpes viruses that can be useful in some situations. These tests are specific for HSV-1 or HSV-2 and are able to demonstrate that a person has been infected at some point in time with the virus, and they may be useful in identifying infection that does not produce characteristic symptoms. However, because false-positive results can occur and because the test results are not always clear-cut, they are not recommended for routine use in screening low-risk populations for HSV infection.     Other diagnostic tests such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to identify the genetic material of the virus and rapid fluorescent antibody screening tests are used to identify HSV in some laboratories.|`|1EOf9DbQaa	warts|`|qK8wcP2Aaa	Some people experience very mild genital herpes symptoms or no symptoms at all, so they don't even know they are infected. However, for many people the first outbreak is often the worst, and genital herpes symptoms can be quite painful.    The main signs of genital herpes are sores around the vagina, on the penis, or near the anus. Sometimes genital herpes sores appear on the scrotum, buttocks, or thighs. The sores may appear about 4 to 7 days after infection. They usually begin as a rash of red bumps. The bumps then turn into blisters. It is common for the blisters to open up, sometimes causing severe pain. In time, the sores will scab over and heal. The first outbreak of genital herpes usually lasts 10 to 20 days until healing is complete.  During the first outbreak, many people have other genital herpes symptoms:   Swollen glands in the groin   Discharge from the vagina or penis   Painful or difficult urination   Fever   Headache   Muscle ache    More women than men report severe herpes symptoms, especially during the first outbreak.

yD32TDDoaa	It takes conditioning.  You will just have to ease yourself into a new environment.  Maybe find out what has happened either to you in the past or someone you've observed that is causing you to become so nervous when entering a new place.  Are you scared something bad will happen and you cannot control it?  You may want to speak with a counselor or someone in student services that can refer you to someone who can help you come up with strategies that will work for you.  Try behavior modification first and if that doesn't work then you can go on to medication but if you can keep your mind as clear as possible while you are studying you have a better chance of succeeding.  Sometimes writing down your fears and coming up with "Statements of Empowerment" can help.  For instance if you are going into a specific building, come up with something that rhymes.  "I'm going into the Ryman for the first time, I will be fine because I am kind"  Things like that and repeat them to yourself to a rhythm it is kind of self hypnosis and you can distract yourself from those feelings of anxiety which is called diversion therapy.  Good luck!

Don't get scared because I've heard cancer cells don't hurt (like if there is one in a groin area that you could feel.) For all I know this is a fatty cell and you can get it removed. I would definitely asap go to a specialist. I hope your all set. Good luck.

In each of these steps you must write down how you feel before doing the activity and how you feel and what happened to you after..eg..I feel as though the doll with hurt me (before), I felt my heart race( after), the doll did not move ( what actually occured). There are books on overcoming fears you can buy. See if you can talk to your sister privatelt and have a heart to heart conversation with her.

Things are only scary if you let them be.    Enough said.|`|AA11974580	Compromise.   Maybe she could keep her dolls in a trunk at night.|`|GqTSa85daa	You have a unreasonable phobia.  See if you can sleep on the couch, or elsewhere.|`|wQpdot1Raa	Haha guess you've seen Chuckie then.   When your packing on moving day you could offer to pack your sisters things and just hide the box somewhere when you get to the new house...|`|lSndJMVoaa	omg, i feel the EXACT same way.   except it's an all-boy family, so nobody has dolls to creep me out.   as a little girl, i loved barbies, but now i absolutely hate them. i have the same nightmares and once i start thinking of them, i can't get it out of my head. if it's REALLY a major phobia, i'd suggest counseling. tell your mom it's serious.|`|AA10093245	Your mom is very insensitive to say that to you. Talk to her again, and tell her what your fears are. If she says you're silly again, then let her know how much this hurts your feelings.   It's hard to rationalize an irrational fear, but the fear is still real.  You could try contacting Dr Phil online, or the Maury show. They do shows about people who have these fears, and maybe mom would take you seriously.  I just can't believe a good mom would be so insensitive.|`|DuSvfGDLaa	sleep with a face mask on|`|J4BxsLSXaa	Lol well yeah! Its creepy! Me and my cousine had that problem when we were younger! But it went by age (I'm 14 hes 13 now)|`|R80bFExmaa	The only effective thing for you to do is see a psychiatrist, who is trained to help you realize your fears for what they are, until they no longer scare you. Until you can do that I recommend sleeping in the living room on a couch or in the basement (if you have one), and just keeping your things in the room you are sharing with your sister. Dolls are not haunted, they are pieces of plastic and cloth sewn together by real people with defining features of human beings. If it was the same cloth and plastic in the shape of a dog or cat, you wouldnt be afraid. Try to understand these things, just because they have manmade features that look like humans, are not real and are just a silly fabric and fiber that some people made into a shape to make money.     Good luck sleeping on the couch.|`|f8a90ec645e7d3573c1e0fcc90cfac14aa	try being in a room with one doll. get used to it being there. i'd even start with it in the bathroom or something, just have it someplace where you are alone with the doll. then when it does not bother you very much, or at all move it to the bedroom and just be in the room alone with it. then try turning out the light. or else instead of turning out the light you can try moving the doll out of the room before you go to bed. then one day you will forget to move it a sleep with it in your room. and then when you wake up you will be a little less scared.   i think you will probably be a little little bit freaked out by dolls all your life and i completely sympathize
37yBB96Iaa	you might have just worn yourself out..my sister,s boyfriend said 1 time that he got morning sickness while she was pregnant but I've no idea.!!|`|qAsuxgA1aa	Ummmm... You can't get sick if she's pregnant, that's just stupid. You'll feel fine in an hour.|`|NYVYm1nSaa	First off, no you can't get sick if she's pregnant. If you feel really ill perhaps you should ask your doctor. It all depends on how sick you feel.|`|PgxU0gBeaa	Some guys claim they have "morning sickness" when their girl is pregnant, but I think it has more to do with anxiety or stress than it does physical pregnancy.    It could be from worrying that she might be pregnant or you might have an STD.  It could be that sex was so fast and rough it shook up everything inside you.  LOL  It could be guilt, if you feel like she wasn't the right girl or you weren't ready.    Most likely its an emotional thing, not physical.|`|4yGGjs7zaa	well you cant be sick if she's pregnant! maybe your a little repulsed by it! not sounded mean but maybe you didnt find her attractive and thats why? or maybe your not very well?
z3Cr54rVaa	I use to have a belly and didn't get rid of it until  I cleaned up my diet and did Pilates, and strength training exercises.     Doing HIIT a few times a week helped a lot too,    Here's a site I found with great diet and workout tips to help you lose belly fat. It helped me by pointing out the mistakes I've been making. http://www.best-abs-exercises.com/burn-s...    Good luck.|`|CwtVfqlSaa	jog everyday and drink like 5 bottles of water and just eat healthy|`|ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have  to work double on them. The best approach is this:  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal  weight, lower for overweight).  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT  ALL. With the dumbbells you will see it in a week.
NUDYEI1Maa	That's not weird AT ALL!...........|`|nDcSY8UQaa	consider a career in the welding field, I get burned all the time and get payed for it, same goes for the Chefs out there, you eathier get use to it or it just dosent bother you, but if you like it your one step ahead of the game.|`|IoJD0aZmaa	that's not that weird. just watch what you do.|`|A40jdi5Naa	cough cough "emo" cough cough|`|fdlhUxzRaa	Weird, isn't quite the word I would use to describe it. but you may want to seek some professional help so that you don't take it too far.|`|3byQ3NFbaa	well if you happen to be cooking something and you do it i guess thats not too werid.  but if you go out of your way to do it then ya, its werid|`|5DbhX2jyaa	that would be called masochism, and it's not really weird unless you take it too far.

AA11020187	Although I live in Los Angeles I may be a bit biased, we do have some excellent cancer hospitals here; City of Hope, Kenneth Norris, UCLA, etc. If it were my uncle I would want him to see Keith Black at Cedars Sinai. For the last several years he has been working on a vaccine for brain cancers and has been very successful with it so far. He is also a pretty nice guy with a good beside manner. Best wishes to you and your uncle.|`|xNkmK0SHaa	Malignant brain tumors are not easy to deal with, either from a medical or emotional position.  That does not mean there is not hope.  The best results I have seen are in those who go to Cancer Treatment Centers of America.  The holistic approach gives much more hope to patient and family than anything else, really.    They have a website and the last I knew, one could ask questions even if one is not the patient.    My best wishes to you and your family.    www.cancercenter.com|`|4yGGjs7zaa	private hpospitals maybe your best choice however they are expensive!    my thoughts are going to you during this time! my dad died from cancer! it was inoperable as it let off cells and lived on there own feeding from the body which make them impossible to remove! its a difficult time and i wish you all the best!

Printing money willy-nilly to distribute amongst ailing industries.    Never, I'm too scared to go off my medication.|`|yOwRD4ZEaa	My medication is too expensive. Thankfully, the drug company is kind enough to provide me with it at no charge. If they didn't, my prescriptions would go unfilled.|`|DS21ekeJaa	I haven't been to a doctor to get any meds because I can't afford it. I make a few dollars too much to be eligible for medicaid or free services but it isn't enough to cover the huge deductible my insurance has.|`|8nIEuXplaa	I only have two lots of meds I Need to take however due to our family income(low) along with our welfare system we usually dont have to skimp. However if our income went up even a moderate amount we would be in trouble, cos whatever more you earn you lose more  Doctors visits $18 and prescription charges $3-$6 unless its a non government funded medication    Edit  I am in New Zealand
uttbqGB9aa	Yeah..um someone lied to you sweetheart.    You definitely gain weight.    Your body starts to retain more water and saves more fat for insulation and protection.    Yes you will be more shapely..but shapely in the sense that you will start to develop breasts and hips.    This is a good thing!! :)|`|bfw1AtAtaa	you actually gain weight, because your body begins to fill out and your breasts start to grow. not only that, but you are growing up as well.|`|2rwCS0F8aa	you can gain weight, but the thing you're thinking of is that you start to get curves.|`|ke48bXASaa	you don't lose weight you gain wieght but not that much|`|c9c6cc0807e5614aae8255608c302986aa	i wouldn't say you lose weight. Chances are you will gain it because you are blotted but thats just water so it will disappear.  You might lose a pound or 2 cuz ur eating habit might change.  Its just random weight|`|e30clNGGaa	Wel, You ussually dont loose weight on your period unless you dont eat, two reasons, your body is growing, and your period will ussually give you bloating wich will make you look a little chubby on ur stomagh ut thats only for ur period, it will calm as soon as its over,    so sorry to dissapoint you but no, you will not loose weight during your period
V5ZpqRs8aa	It really depends. I usually doze off at around 11 thirty on weeknights but thats because I wake up at 6am. But on weekends I sleep at around 3am. But at parties I barely sleep at all lol|`|RlPeaD8Qaa	weekdays 12:00 PM or else i wont wake up in the morning, weekends, 2-4 AM haha:)|`|P3Fg1K2Vaa	The best time to sleep would be the time that would fit your schedule. Make the time you sleep a cycle. Try to get at least 7-8 hours of sleep a day.
36Ps6EO7aa	People with asthma experience symptoms when the airways tighten, inflame, or fill with mucus. Common symptoms of asthma include:    Coughing, especially at night   Wheezing   Shortness of breath   Chest tightness, pain, or pressure     Early warning signs of asthma are not usually severe enough to stop you from going about your daily activities. But by recognizing these signs, you can stop an asthma attack or prevent one from getting worse. Early warning signs include:    Frequent cough, especially at night   Losing your breath easily or shortness of breath   Feeling very tired or weak when exercising   Wheezing or coughing after exercise   Feeling tired, easily upset, grouchy, or moody   Decreases or changes in lung function as measured on a peak flow meter   Signs of a cold, or allergies (sneezing, runny nose, cough, nasal congestion, sore throat, and headache)   Trouble sleeping     An asthma attack is the episode in which bands of muscle surrounding the airways are triggered to tighten. This tightening is called bronchospasm. During the attack, the lining of the airways becomes swollen or inflamed and the cells lining the airways produce more and thicker mucus than normal.    If you suspect asthma, by all means seek a doctor.  You may just be having shortness of breath or overexertion.  You could also be having heart palpitations and causing your breathing to become more difficult.  If it continues to be bothersome, seek a doctor also.  You may have something else going on.|`|6pevwBizaa	You might - it's always a possibility - but it also could've been just a singular occurence. The quiz on this website might help:     http://www.asthma.com/do_i_have_asthma_q...     You really should tell/ask your parents tho.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	asthma kills.  see your doctor.
OGaLQyCWaa	This is a prescription for glasses, not contact lenses.  Did your doctor perform a contact lens exam on you?  If you did not discuss contact lenses with your doctor or receive trial lenses in the office, I doubt you did.  If you ever have questions about your eyes, you need to refer to the best source of information.....your eye doctor.  Hope this helps!
ParFJxnSaa	Self esteem/confidence, and assertiveness is addressed in section 38, at http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris Some advice, and options: Volunteer, even from home, at first, to provide a solid basis in reality for the daily affirmations: "I am a good person, who is valued by my community, because I... (insert activity here)..". Section 47 also refers. On volunteering outside the home, you will come into contact with supportive people, and receive positive feedback for your efforts, which will be obviously appreciated; there are many options; one is sure to suit you. I have recently encountered another opinion, however, which is that, just as it is important to build a house on a solid foundation, so it is with self esteem. Learn to forgive yourself for your past mistakes, and failures, or inadequacies.     Accept that you, too are just a human being, with the frailties, insecurities, and tendency to err, occasionally, that the rest of us have. That is the beginning of self love, self acceptance, and self esteem. Regularly monitor your internal monologue (self talk): write down the negative ones: "I'm really ugly" and then the converse: "I'm fairly good looking", and next time you become aware that you are thinking the former, visualise, as vividly as possible, a big "STOP!!!" sign, and/or a stern faced person wagging a finger at you, and deliberately repeat 5 times, either aloud, in a big voice, if alone, or subvocally (to yourself, in your mind), the converse affirmation.     Habits take about 30 - 40 repetitions to become established, with most people. Make a list of all your good points, strengths, and achievements. Put it somewhere so you can easily refer to it, from time to time; perhaps on the refrigerator door, or print it; (large typeface, or capitalise) have it framed, and place in your bedroom, or in a position of prominence, such as on the television, or lounge room wall. Practise one of the relaxation methods on pages 2, 11, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed. Also, give the EFT a good tryout, to see if it helps you. Section 53 at ezy-build also refer. "Even though I sometimes have low self esteem/self confidence, I deeply and completely accept myself".     Read: "Lift your mood now." by John D Preston, Psy.D. 2001, New Harbinger Publications, Inc., 5674 Shattuck Avenue, Oakland. CA 94609   http://www.amazon.com/ may be worth trying for this, (you could also enter "self esteem" in their searchbar) because it approaches the building of self esteem using a different, but equally valid method.|`|twVyisGnaa	All it takes is bravery and discipline.    VIVA LA RAZA!|`|gIcg7Ug2aa	If you have some money to spend, take a Dale Carnegie course or, enroll in a Karate school.  discipline most certainly builds self esteem and knowing that you can defend yourself if necessary helps also.  good luck and I think your going to do it.|`|kyfdBu9Aaa	what makes you think your parents don't love you? You should talk to them, they'd probably try and help you. Another thing you could do is get a job in somewhere you have no choice but to come out of your shell, like bar work. Think about it, this usually works. But it's not abnormal to feel like that at your age. I felt something similar when I was younger but it changes. Find a part-time job and talk to people who are close to you the ones who give you 'security'.
eCKNRcIVaa	Yes, you may want to avoid working out for a few more days.  Blood will rush to the whatever part of the body is injured.  Right now that is your mouth, getting your blood pumping hard and fast right now could lead to throbbing pain and/or swelling where your root canal area is|`|K1iUzewyaa	yes, it's normal.. Your system is in full use. Your blood is pumping a lot more than normal. so it is normal for your pressure to rise a little bit. It will hit on those nerves inside your gums.. It's going to take a little, maybe 2-3 weeks for that pain to subside totally. hope a speedy recovery..|`|szyUVMOlaa	It'll be because your blood is pumping round harder and faster when you exercise so its putting extra pressure on the wound. Give working out a break for a while to give it chance to heal you eager beaver! :)
HchGJp3oaa	sometimes|`|HZ0dltJtaa	I'm not really afraid to die..  I'm more afraid of what happens after death.|`|rohrYlm1aa	Here's the funny thing about me. I am absolutely afraid of death, yet I have suicidal thought everyday. So every single day I think of ways to die but I probably won't do it because I'm afraid at the same time.|`|chOS6EO0aa	I am not.|`|NTEwg7Syaa	i've always wondered what it's like to die... i can just imagine wat would happen if i plunge a kitchen knife into my stomach and then my parents would come home to see me drowning in my own blood, yes i am very scared of death|`|y9tMWuQjaa	Deeply afraid :(    It's awful - the worst thing ever. It makes all other problems seem insignificant. I hope I don't get diagnosed with a terminal illness because I really wouldn't want to know. I'd obsess even more than I do now!     I think those who claim they're not afraid to die are not telling the whole truth or have not thought through the implications. Imagine being a corpse ... Oh my god!!! It doesn't seem real.|`|NF80kaBDaa	sometimes, yeah :/|`|ntbSfSmGaa	No I am no way afraid of dying but I probably would be if I was a youngster.  Realistically nature has its way of making   us ready for what is a natural event.  Now that I am 74 today I find that dying seems quite desirable, I actually sleep much more than I used to when I was young and am much more accepting of life itself.  Please dont waste your young life worrying about such things - if it happens you will not be in any way aware of it - just the same as going to sleep at night.  What were you aware of before you were born - absolutely nothing......either it will be the same when you die or you will go on to a better life.  It's a win win situation I think don't you?    Enjoy yourself whilst you are here!!!
EyKJ737daa	Well that is a good 8 hours sleep sweetie and you have very well have slept very soundly and deeply especially if you have been under a lot of stress lately.  After a good night's sleep, the next day always seems brighter and clearer for me and maybe that has happened for you too.  If you are pregnant sweetie, then I hope this is good news and wont stress you out! I wouldn't test just yet, probably still a little early, wait till your period is late and check first thing in the morning for the strongest reading.  Good luck sweetie and all the very best xx
381eb5244a845cff58e5a278ff8092fdaa	its a cheap ring... really cheap cheap juwlery will do that to you    go to the store and get clear nailpolish and paint the inside of your ring after cleaning the green off your finger, this should help, if it starts again, paint it again|`|rx4GMXUdaa	Fake jewelry causes green fingers. The same thing happened to me but yaaah just put clear nail polish on it and if it continues just keep putting clear polish on it. That should help.|`|Qxk1V55Zaa	The reason your finger turns green is that the natural oils that come from your skin cause the copper in the ring to oxidize there isn't really any way to stop it. umm just either deal with it or.. well... get a different ring... most rings that are cheap are copper with a paint or foil around it.|`|HDUq1ls7aa	"Um, Hey doc it hurts when I do this". "Well don't do that".    In your case stop wearing the damn ring unless greens your favorite color.  Certain alloys stain in different colors when they perspire, or it could be the wearers body reacting to the alloy, orrrrr it could too much acid in your own body. Orr..... you get it? There is more then one answer.    It's not so much that the ring is cheap. All gold is not pure gold, there is nothing PURE about a gold ring. It's that gold is not a very hard metal, so it's always treated with other alloys for the sake of durability.   But the more gold there is, the more expensive and less durable the jewelry.
AA10780593	the type of material in the ring is causing this. there is no way to stop it while still wearing the ring. you have to take it off and keep it off.|`|KjR2kP1oaa	I read somewhere that you can paint the inside of the ring with clear fingernail polish to stop it.|`|LJcVUnj1aa	Sorry but this usually means its a cheap metal. It happens and you cant stop it, unless of course you take it off. :(

Good thing you had another picture taken.    If it's not a blood clot, you should still follow-up with your doc, and be aggressive if they are ignoring or "poo-poohing" you.  A breathing problem than started when you were in an accident might be coincidental, but probably isn't.  Chase this one -- you totally deserve it.

PpKJIT0aaa	You just answered your own question.    Look for Sensitive skin info on the label. I suggest a health store, so you can avoid anything with aluminum in it, parabens or mineral oils. Likely, those are causing the irritation.|`|aH0yYcTIaa	I'd go to a co-op or health food store they have some natural ones that are less irritating, they may not be quite as effective and you may smell like a hippie or gutterpunk vegan, but it shouldn't be as irritable.|`|fRRESP1maa	Agreeing with Totem, look for products in the store that are specifically created for sensitive skin.

5ExSaZ9Qaa	Without weights or machines makes putting muscle mass on a lot more difficult, but still possible.    The first thing you have to know about gaining weight is that an extremely large portion of doing so is dieting (I don't mean eating less, I mean eating more! And healthy, more importantly)    I hear good reviews about the P90X workout, I'm sure you could easily find the torrent for the download, for free.  I do believe the only requirement for this program is some dumbbells (I know you said no weights, but I can't give you everything you ask for:) and something that can be used for achin upp bar.    If you need additionall information about finding this torrent, just ask the question and I'm sure I could easily find it.

Kxwyy0Eaaa	The soy milk (assuming it's organic) is good as well as the wheat germ and the fruit, though I don't think three for breakfast is necessary. Special K does not contian whole grains, or of any of them do, it's not at the top of the list. It also contains corn syrup and/or high fructose corn syrup in addition to other artificial stuff, I think even hydrogenated oils. Yet, Kellogg's tries to pass this off as healthy. I guess they don't count on people not only reading the ingredients lists, but actually knowing how to decipher them. (My rule of thumb is that if it's Kellogg's or Quaker, I get suspicious.)    The water is good, of course.    I also don't think yogurt is necessary at all.     Generally, I have whole grain, all-natural cereal with organic soy milk for breakfast. Lately, I've been eating Kashi because I've been getting excellent prices on them, thanks to sale prices and double coupons. I don't know what the sugar content is, in any of them because I don't' bother to look. Since it's probably made with brown rice syrup, or cane sugar, I don't think of it. (If it had high fructose corn syrup, or even corn syrup, I wouldn't even buy it.)|`|n7KCez59aa	HI !    Special K cereal is not the best thing for you for breakfast. I would suggest replacing the cereal with oatmeal, and put all your fruit and milk into that instead.   If you do not like oatmeal. try high fiber cereal instead, like Grape Nuts.|`|Lnt4u4q6aa	why are you having Special K ?  it is lacking big time in nutrients AND fiber !  The last time i looked at it in the store i put it back on the shelf, because the grams of fiber were so low.  Fiber is very important because it helps digestion and makes you feel full.    ditch the Special K and buy any of the Fiber One cereals.  I have tried them all and they are good.  Fruit is good, but 4 fruits with breakfast might be too much.  fruit contains natural sugar, too much sugar can be stored as fat. have some fruit and keep the yogurt :)    check the sugar in Fiber One next time you are in the store|`|76SAdZ19aa	I think it's a delicious healthy breafast.

If after two weeks you are still experiencing side effects you may want to speak to your doctor about switching to a different med.  Every one is different-you just need to see what works for you.

I'm 14 and a half and I got it three months after my 13th birthday, unfortunately. But my friend got it one month after her 14th birthday, my other got it one month BEFORE her 14th birthday (so she was late 13) and my cousin got it half a month after her fourteenth. I've heard rumors, idk if their true, but it depends who you hang out with? If you hang with your friends somethings your periods can come on the same day, so maybe that could be it, I'm not sure? But my cousin who got it when she was 14 hung out with me who had just gotten my like 12th one that week. It is heredity, normally, so ask your mom when her and your grandmother got it.My two aunts got it when they were 16, and they had something wrong with them though, so you dont need to worry for at least a couple years. If you hit 16 like my aunts, then you may want to see a doctor. Hope that helps :) ur perfectly fine.

jp3WrE1caa	haha,well its not really mine,but some one from a class..    so one day this girl comes to our math class(which btw has about 3 girls and 20 guys),wearing these REALLY nice white jeans,which she tells us were $150.she takes her usual seat in front of me,and class starts...then about half way through when shes turned around as im explaining one of the questions to her,she gets this look on her face that can only be explained as 'oh sh*t!'...she asks the teacher if she can go to the bathroom,because it was an emergency(which was when i figured out her period had just started).the teacher,being a guy,and not a real sensitive one at that,asked what the emergency was,and then everyone (all 20 guys) turned and looked at her.she kind of just stuttered 'umm ummum...' the said never mind.everyone went back to work and she turned back to me with this pleading look on her face...i had absolutely no clue what to do!then the bell finally went for the end of class,and we both stood up.the girl started walking fast out the door when this guy she  liked-whos known to be a jerk- called her name.she turned around and he said (infront of EVERYONE) "hey,i like what youve done with the back of your jeans!very sexy!" then started laughing.the girl looked mortified!i wanted to help but had no clue what to do!her eyes started to water and she quickly booked it to the bathroom.    I felt sooo bad for her!i would have died!and to make matters worse,she had to walk down the crowded hall,out the front steps,and wait for her mom to come get her for like 10 minutes,AND for the rest of the week that guy kept going up to her in every class and asking what happened to her 'red hot jeans!'|`|tO7e262zaa	Here is mine:    I was 12 years old and in middle school. back in 1999...Well I had only been getting my period for a few months and would never get symptoms. Sometimes I wouldn't even know I had it until I went to the bathroom to pee. Well here I am in science class and the bell rings. I get up to move to my next class and the cutest boy there tells me I have a red spot of my lavender skirt. He liked to make jokes so I thought he was kidding. Well, he wasn't. Everyone laughed at me and I had to get my mom to pick me up. I went to class the next day and he told me I left the chair bloody.     Talk about embarrassing.|`|bZtH1PvGaa	my was really super embarrassing.  i didn't get my period till i was 16 .    one day i was at my boyfriends house just hanging out and i just felt weird felt something running down into my undies so i went to the bathroom and some some blood...i flipped out!! it was my first period and my mom wasn't due to pick me up for another 4 hours and i didn't know what to do! i didn't want to ask him mom cos that's embarrassing! so i looked through all the drawers in the bathroom and found a sponge lmao....i ripped it up small enough to fit into my panties and just walled out...well like an hour later my bf mom left and we started messing around..i had   completely forgot the sponge was there so he started unbuckling my pants and put his hand in..i guess he was so caught up in the moment that he squeeze the sponge lol and completely covered me in my own blood he flipped out and ran out the room. i ran home and we just never talked again. but my 1st period is just really unforgettable.|`|fKgxSjGFaa	I was on my period and i was wearing a swim suit at the beach and i was using tampon.

He pulled it and i felt a really sharp pain and he got this really grossed out look on his face.  I forgot to tuck the string in and he pulled out my tampon!    I was mortified.|`|LIlLGRSYaa	okay i have 2    I slept at my aunts house and I had my period. I forgot my pyjamas and when I went to bed, in the morning, there was blood on the sheets and a big spot on my pants. I stayed in bed until I could go into my little cousins room to get dressed then I put toilet paper in my pants for extra protection. To make matters worse, when my aunty took me home we were outside and my mum said "you've got toilet paper in your pants" then she pulled it out and said "oh I see" then we went inside and my aunty said "my things are in the bathroom cupboard so just go to them when you need them"    I was mortified!      This one time I was in Middle school and it was a quite large school, well we all had to stay outside until the bell rang in the mornings... well i was running a tad bit behind that day and the car pulled up RIGHT before the bell rang so most of the school was outside. Well i get out of the car and I fell flat on my face and I had gotten my 2nd period ever the day before so i had my purse full to the brim of pads and tampons. and that purse flew outta my hand and opened when it hit the ground and all the contents fell out! so everyone in school knew i was on my period|`|mjshqfuyaa	haha well one time i was flying it was like a 2 hour flight and i jsut started my period that morning and was using a pad and a tampon. and like 30 minutes into the flight this guy in the front ( i was in the middel of the plane) kept giving me these weird looks and then he turned to his mom and started talking to her and then he pointed at me then they both gave me these really gross looks. and i was like you guys are really weird lol. Then i got of the plane and everything and went down to get my bags and looked down and saw that i had blood stairs half way down my tighs and all over my butt how this happened i have no idea it was so embrassing and everyone was just staring at me and i have nothing to cover it with.  i wanted to die..      and  this one too.          i had been spotting for a while and my boyfriend wanted to have sex and i was like i cant. and we did it anyways and it felt really gross and slimy and i got up and his bed was just like spotted with brown blood everywhere i wanted to die and he like ran into the shower >.|`|ceE9aNg2aa	I can't.|`|YGvKisOoaa	hahaha okay well i was going to a sleepover with my youth group (all girls, obviously) and i was on my period. it was a few months ago, so that was like a year since my first period so i didnt know how heavy it would be or not.

The worst part was coming back out of the bathroom when the routine was over after I messed it all up, and did I mention I was the tallest so I was the middle in the kickline!|`|emJ79qagaa	Mine was when I was 12, my first period, and I wore WHITE shorts to school, and I got it in the middle of school.

iLuri0YAaa	masturbation is always a confusing act but trust me its good. masturbating helps your body get rid of all that extra stress and sexual hunger for a few minutes. it helps clean out the pipes and and keeps your reproductive system working properly.     on the other side, some religions look at masturbation as a bad thing but its not really the act of masturbations. if you really think about it the bible only says that lust is a sin. if you when you masturbate you are thinking of a certain person then you are lusting therefore sinning but if you are just doing it cuz it feels good. then your fine!    hope that helps dude!|`|wBwHhygWaa	Masturbation is not welcomed my some cultures/religions.

8VEEihaqaa	Legalizing and regulating weed would work.    The only thing I can really think of is to have a class, an actual mandatory Drug Education class that goes over every drug that is currently known to be abused, from street drugs to prescriptions.  A class that tells you where the drugs came from, how they were made, why they became a part of our society, how they are abused, what the immediate effects are, what the long term effects are, and some of the worst case scenarios that can happen when taking the drugs, things besides death.  Each class should be at least an hour long, and cover one drug at a time.  Classes should of course be filled with FACTS, not conjectures, and should have the resources to back it all up.    I believe the only way to combat this is to TELL THE TRUTH.  Stop trying to control our kids (and our people) with fear, and start helping them understand why we look down on certain drugs and discourage their use.  Early intervention is the best way.  If you don't explain to your kids these things, they're only going to want to find out themselves, the bad way.|`|ahjqc9Ifaa	Proper parenting which teaches that all actions have consequences works.

4w7lsoj7aa	trust me you would be dead by now, you will feel light headed, possibly a head-ache, and short of breath, this is because red blood cells like carbon monoxide more than oxygen, so you would actually suffocate after a couple minutes.|`|EOhSZuduaa	i was actually poisoned by carbon monoxide on christmas day a couple years ago and i didnt even know it. i felt tired at first so i sat down and eventually fell asleep. next thing i know my sisters banging on the front door to let her in. i was looking around and everything was covered in black, you couldnt even see anything. it was in my nose, i had to use q-tips to get it out. anyway, it was all due to a kerosene heater.|`|1TsTB6cvaa	i think if it was serious poisoning then you would get gradually tired and unable to move as less oxygen gets to your brain. as you would be unable to move, you would die there of being low on oxygen unless someone managed to get you out. i don't know about low levels of poisoning however, only that carbon monoxide is heavier than oxygen therefore blocking it getting into your lungs.   i only know the effect of serious poisoning by watching a soap, however, so i could be wrong|`|hzGpR1Rtaa	death|`|ugytyh3oaa	Drowsiness|`|IYLlupdkaa	nausea, difficulty breathing, lightheadedness, fatigue|`|EcKLqBnCaa	Headaches, dizziness, and other flu-like symptoms. If all people in the house/building are feeling this way, there is a big chance that there is a carbon monoxide leak! Call 911 and get out of the house if this happens.     If you haven't already, I suggest that you buy carbon monoxide detectors to place around your home. They're a little pricey if you have to buy many of them (got mine for $16 each), but well worth it.|`|b6IJgvNIaa	I have had severe Carbon Monoxide poisoning and it was all over the news because we almost died so I can tell you the real truth!!!! First off, hopefully you won't be because you should get a Carbon Monoxide detector. But if you do, you will feel REALLY woozy and sick. My sister fainted so that might happen too. When I had it, I asked my sister "Am I going to die" because I thought that that was what dying felt like. She said no but (this is what the doctors said) if we had stayed in the house for just five minutes longer we would have all died. Also you will probably not be able to sleep and you will get a headache. You might experience throwing up or sickness. Also short or long term memory loss. If you ever have any of these signs, get out of the house IMMEDIATELY and call 911. My mom had the worst poisoning so she had to go in a hyperbaric chamber for like 3 hours. How we got it was we left the car running in the garage and it went into the house.

jKdVtDx7aa	First of all the energy you are using worrying on "stuff' is a waste of energy. Its a merry go round and leads to no where. Jump off now.  Meditate or anything to help. Go on line and find help, there is plenty out there. It can only get worse if you let it. I hate to see anyone live like this when they do not have to. I suffered from panic attacks for years and all that fear and worry was for nothing. I let that happen.  As I stated before, look things up on the internet about help with anxiety and go from there. One step at a time. Calm your mind and try and SLOW your thought process down.That helps. Good luck. I will be glad to help you if you do not have any luck. Contact me if you have to, I don't mind. You can beat this and I know that for a fact.    You have trained yourself to feel anxious. You need to find a way to instill positive thoughts. You have the "what if" syndrome and find concern with just about everything. Good Luck|`|5AaMDz91aa	Are you taking medication?  That could be the reason why.  THe medication could be taking care of one thing, but not the other.  That would be my first guess.  If you are not on meditacion, then Maybe you have a lot of stress in your life.  I suggest trying some yoga, or talking to other people.  A lot of times, when you have something deep inside you that you really need to say, it can my anxitey worse.    Good luck!  Kadie|`|eCKNRcIVaa	Depression often manifests as anxiety or generalized anxiety disorder|`|WXExyAlWaa	It really depends. You can be anxious without being depressed and you can be depressed without being anxious, but the two often go together. I have both (plus insomnia as a side effect) and quite often I have days where I feel okay mood-wise, but can't really leave the house because I'm too scared of the world.

You may wonder, "Which one is better?"  Don't worry, you're not the only one with that question.    The Panic Away program is more appropriate for people who can cope with their Panic Attacks or Anxiety well.  Linden Method is more for those who aren't really good in coping their Panic Attacks or Anxiety well.

f8mLpPXlaa	It really depends on the cause of the effusion. If the effusion was due to CHF than yes, fluid restriction would help. If the causative agent was bacterial than no. Those are just general guidelines.  Treatment would depend , again, on the cause and the severity. It might require a chest tube be placed to drain the fluid. Sometimes just a thoracentesis will help fix the problem.  Without any more detail it's hard to say more.  But that is an excellent question.  And btw the fluid is not trapped in the intravacular spaces. Most often it is third spacing due to the high capillary pressure. Or it could be free fluid just sitting in the pleural space.  God bless.

0HtTJAQoaa	Hi...I think I may know what it could be...It could very well be Excema. Excema is a form of Dermatitis - an inflammatory skin condition that can be very itchy and red. What can help is Hydrocortisone cream. As well as Eucerin moisturizing cream...Both of those are available over-the-counter. Also, you could try anti-itch creams/lotions as well...Eucerin offers an anti-itch moisturizing lotion as well...Check out your local drugstore/Walmart for these products...    However, the rash may need prescription medication. Prescription creams (also available in ointment form) that work very well for Excema/Dermatitis are:  1 - Elocon (brand name for Momethasone)   2 - Triamcinolone   Write these down on a piece of paper, and bring it to your doctor, to perhaps see if one of them may be right for you. Another excellent anti-inflammatory medicine in pill-form--that is prescribed for severe inflammatory conditions--is the  corticosteroid drug called, Prednisone.     To learn more on Dermatitis, click:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatitis|`|LfoH1ivlaa	http://www.webmd.com|`|TvYa0rmbaa	It's probaly eczema, i have it too,my doctor recommended me Cetaphil or Aveeno, I use both, but i think Cetaphil is more effective ;)  you can get them at your local drugstores/supermarkets.

gSo4dR7oaa	CD4 cells are the cells in our bodies that help us fight infections.  HIV kills these cells, damaging the immune system.  When the CD4 blood cell count drops to 200 or below, the person is diagnosed with AIDS.  As the CD4 count drops, the person becomes more and more vulnerable to other infections, such as colds, flu, TB, and pneumonia, which people with healthy immune systems would not have problems with, but which someone who has HIV can no longer fight off.  In fact, people do not die from HIV itself.  They die of the infection(s) they get because their immune systems have been destroyed by HIV.

I would go back to the dr and tell him/her that you think it is BV.  You need to get a medication from the dr to clear it up.  Also if you have BV when you get pregnant it can cause problems so try to get it cleared up ASAP especially if you are trying for a baby.  Take care.|`|MhpccWpmaa	I think that you do have BV. I've had it three times before and the biggest symptom is a very strong fish smelling discharge that's usually watery. It's unpleasant and the smell gets worse during/after sex as well as around your period.  It's simple to treat with a prescription of Flagyl which is a pill you take twice a day for a week. Once you take this it'll be cleared up. Best wishes :)|`|od51qzQtaa	sometimes semen can upset the PH balance of the vagina. It does sound like bacterial vaginosis your best bet is to visit the doc but he will probably prescribe antibiotics which will cure the BV but it will most probably come back so you need to get your body in good balance.

EX: if he drinks a lot of Moutain Dew, that can affect you. I was having problems till my DR figured it out that my boyfriend needed to drink more water.     There is no over the counter meds for a BV!!! Only a DR can get you something... You need to go to the DR when you are having this problem and they can then test this for you.
RGKdb0wHaa	Do you have lymphoma? cause if not it is very common for thyroid cancer to move in to the lymph nodes and they would just remove them so if you havent been diagnosed with lymphoma I wouldnt stress about having it. I was diagnosed with papillary thyroid carcinoma 3 years ago had surgery to remove thyroid and some lymph nodes and after surgery youll be a little sore but for me it wasnt to bad I was able to go home the next day but one thing that I did notice was that right after surgery I was very ill vomiting a lot and they said that was normal  so I wouldnt worry to much for now until you know everything
h5rP7p95aa	You can buy home drug test kits online through places like Uritox Medical.  They sell all kinds of kits like urine, hair and saliva.  These are the same kits that clinics use to do drug screening.  The kits are a good price and can be used to test one drug up to 12 drugs instantly.  Last time I checked a test for 1 drug runs around 2 bucks and its FDA approved.  Also their drug tests use SAMHSA cut off levels.  Which means they use the same levels as the clinics use.  I hope this helps.|`|1TsTB6cvaa	Wouldn't you just be better not taking drugs in the first place?  i haven't heard of home drugs tests, just personal Breathalyzers|`|8IfePMa3aa	Test kits can be found at drug stores, detox kits can be picked up at a head shop (bring money!).|`|vCIqQYTWaa	lay off the crack.|`|KeczU1tDaa	For the home drug-testing kits, you can either try and find what you need online or at your local pharmacy.  If you've got some time before the test, I recommend researching and purchasing it online.  A buddy of mine who works for a CVS pharmacy just told me that they aren't always in stock (but feel free to check anyway).  And try and buy the moderately priced one, not a cheap one nor a ridiculously expensive one.  You're looking for reliability and you can get that from ones priced anywhere from $13-21 online.    The detox is easy to find.  Your local head shop should have a variety of brands.  Politely ask them which one they think is the best and buy that.  Any GNC store or vitamin shop at the mall should carry them also.  Though, I have to say that I question the reliability of those detox kits; I know people who work in head shops and they say that customers come in all of the time and complain that the detox kits don't work.  Synthetic urine, on the other hand, is the better bet.  These same friends tell me that no one comes in to complain about those.  As a matter of fact, police officers come in and buy them when it's time for their drug tests.    Good luck!
eNhVVmG7aa	Breasts often swell a bit during your period, totally normal.    Also, at 16 - you are quite likely not yet finished with your adult growth.  Your breasts may have additional development to complete.  This may not mean they get bigger, it may mean that your nipples develop a bit more, etc.   Bottom line, 16 is well into adult growth, but not yet complete. :)    No, sleeping on your stomach has nothing to do with your breast development.    John Jones, M.D.|`|JhGEokVsaa	well, your breasts are supposed to grow at least a bit each month after your period because of the horomone levels.

Hq6nSl1Qaa	There are way too many variables here to give you an answer that will solve your issue.  First, allergies tend to increase the likelihood of bleeding.  This occurs through interleukins.  If you feel a burning in your nose, that can indicate histamine release, one result of allergies.  For most people, the immune system peaks in activity at 11PM.  But if your circadian cycle is behind that (you stay up late), then it can occur later.  So, allergies may be a cause.      If you are on nasal steroids (Flonase), then the drug is probably your answer.    You could also just have high blood pressure and increased stress combined with Vitamin K, copper dificiency, and thinned blood vessels (from stress) can cause easy bleeding.  Regardless, staring with a good vitamin (that contains V-K) is always a good first step.    Then there is a host of physical/chemical reasons.  Solvent, pesticide, herbicide, or high dust exposure can causer your bleeds as the immune system tries to correct the issue.    Like most of medicine, the final cause is based on how your body responds to changing conditions.  You may have developed an allergy to dust mites in your pillow becuase of a cold you had two months ago.  It is hard to tell at this point.|`|TvYa0rmbaa	Um...you should see a doctor, or try cleaning your nose more, take vitamin C pills at least once eevryday. But I would recommend seeing a doctor more.|`|SyBIuKzdaa	First, they say not to put your head back because swallowing the blood is not good for you.     I used to get nose bleeds a lot when it got dry and my allergies were acting up so if you don't already, you might want to sleep with a Humidifier.     If you can handle it, get a nettie pot and do a sinus wash. You can get one at most drug stores and they come with packets to add to the water. First time, start with only half a packet and luke warm water.    If you can't handle the nettie pot, just get some "simply saline" and do a light wash with that.
9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	As few as 24 paracetamols is enough to cause a slow painful death from acute liver failure. Symptoms typically may not occur within the first 24 hours, however during this time you would likely experience some degree of nausea and vomiting. Hepatic necrosis would begin to develop after 24 hours - this can progress to acute liver failure and you'd also develop encephalopathy, hypoglycemia, cerebral oedema  and eventually renal failure - after a few days.|`|7syjNjwhaa	Depending on the amount of tablets and the dosage of paracetamol per tablet (250mg or 500mg) it will be different. I only have experiences with relatively small overdoses, 20-30 pills taken in staggered overdoses, the effects can be very unpleasant. First, you feel fine, all relaxed, and a bit hazy. Then comes the insomnia and you may have the best sleep you ever had in your life, you could spend 2-3 days basically just sleeping. After a while, you might feel spaced out, confused, you pupils may become larger or unequal sizes, horrible abdominal pains or cramps, feeling sick, and have difficulty breathing. If you have taken a smaller overdose, you might not have any unpleasant side effects at all. The larger the overdose is the risk of liver failure is even bigger. Overdoses of paracetamol can be fatal, and take up to even 2 weeks to experience symptoms. After you pass the first 12 hours you stomach cannot be pumped.

A pill for a yeast infection won't cure it, have your doctor test you for that.  If the test is positive they will give you a prescription for Flagyl that you take twice a day for a week that will clear it up.

So seriously dont let people scare you if they thought it was so painful then theyre *******(pardon my french) I was terriefied, and people made it sound like it was the worst dental procedure in the world, and like I said it was as easy as a filling, the worst part is the shot of novicane... dont worry.|`|zsH4wI0Raa	YES!!!|`|JAGONkXdaa	it sounds like it does.|`|jVQ58AMFaa	idk people tell me it doesnt hurt but i have to get one in a month. i hope it doesnt hurt. good luck!!!!!!!!!|`|Q8R9E7lDaa	No, not usually. Do not listen to the above people. Pain is the rare exception with root canals, especially the more skilled your dentist is.|`|eYzuxqQaaa	yes ma'am|`|r9LzlZa6aa	i think it does|`|2hF4zUE6aa	No i had it done|`|WEPzHNmLaa	Not these days,just a long time in chair.It does cost a lot of money hurts pocket book.|`|aYsPBtXHaa	not that i have had the surgury everyone has 2 take them out wen they begin to hurt so my mom took out hers they put u 2 sleep|`|LEvoWDvnaa	Mine didn't. They told me that the tooth was all ready dead.|`|l4anfnt7aa	I had to get two root canals done in a single day -- two teeth side by side were in bad shape.    Because it's the nerve that was infected, they gave me a shot to numb me first. But they had to give me the shot right in the infected nerve. For that reason, the shot was extremely painful. It felt like half of my face was on fire, from behind my eye, around my cheek, down to my chin and all points in between. This only lasted a couple seconds but I was not ready for it because I didn't know what to expect. It took my breath away at first.    But, moments later, the nerve was completely numb. Then the surgery began. There was no pain, it was just awkward to sit there with my mouth open while the work was being done.
Dhz4XgQ3aa	I think its awkward either way around. Its very hard to maintain the sexy loving picture someone had of you when they fell for you when your depressed and if your a woman, blokes just dont really know how to support you or what you need.   It is stressful for the carer though. And that is how the dynamics of the relationship change. Starting as a loving equal partnership to one being/feeling helpless and the other becoming their carer. I have found it is very hard to come back from that once you have entered that carer stage. Its difficult to move the relationship back to what it was. Its not to say it cant be done, but in my experience it very very difficult.|`|Yhy5jtsNaa	the lack of understanding in any sort of relationship is frustrating for me, it can be awkward because they just don't understand what the f*ck is going on|`|EE7sAaMlaa	yes but i know that i am the problem most of the time because of my illness i realise it is probably more difficult for him.|`|3d3d0hLIaa	sometimes, because they don't always understand but then they are usually there for you when things get bad.|`|DjHWw3h3aa	i have mental health problems and i think any one who doesn't have mental health problems will never understand how hard it can be at times and its really hard sometimes when people just don't understand.i think its coz its not like a broken leg or a cold that can clearly be seen they think its not to bad and when you have depression/mental health problems people just say pull your socks up and get on with it go for a walk it will make you feel better if only it was that easy..if you have a good partner then they will be patient and understanding but unless they have been through it they will never totally understand|`|AA12141879	It certainly can be, but I think I am really lucky in that my other half is much better able than I am to recognise when it is affecting my behaviour, and he is very supportive and understanding.  I've attacked him and screamed terrible things at him, but he knows the difference between a normal argument or bad mood, and when I am out of control and behaving out of character.  We have been together for about 10 years, and sometimes I am amazed that he has the resilience to put up with my constanly changing moods and sometimes bizzare behaviour.      But I am also aware that there are plenty of other people out there who just wouldn't know how to deal with that sort of thing, and so I think I am one of the lucky ones.|`|fJaZlJQXaa	Yes it is awkward.  But being in a relationship with someone who also has a mental illness is even worse.  You cant win!|`|YAueLGp3aa	i am a diagnosed multi personality but i have a partner who understod this from my openess to start and is supportive (inc putting up with my mood swings..making me take my drugs and just generally listening to me waffleing) is it easy ..no not at times but the good times are fabulous and communication is the key that means aswell as she listens to me waffling i too listen to her when it gets hard.  good luck  x paul n tracy|`|7syjNjwhaa	It's not too bad, I just try to avoid them when I have a depressive episode.|`|eBBHHJltaa	No, my boyfriend is very understanding.
0HtTJAQoaa	I too--suffer from chronic insomnia...I take Ambien 10mg at bedtime...However, there are other sleep aids that are available...  *Over the counter remedies include:  - Simply Sleep - Basically all this contains is the same main ingredient that's in Benadryl - Dipenhydramine (an antihistamine)...  - Sleep MD - This is an herbal remedy you can buy at your local drugstore or Walmart...I've tried this and it works pretty good!   - Melatonin - is an otc herb that is used mostly for sleep...However, it's been reported to have caused nightmares...    *Prescription Meds that can help with sleep (other than Ambien & Lunesta) are:  - Rozerem - This is supposed to be a derivative of Melatonin...Though I've never tried it...I've heard good things about it.  - Trazodone - This is a common anti-depressant that MANY docs prescribe as a non-addictive alternative for sleep...I have taken it before, and it works...However, one of its side effects that I felt was a hung-over feeling...& cloudy-headed.  - Benzodiazepines - These are quite addictive, but they are sedating...and help with sleep...Drugs in this class include:  Valium, Xanax, Halcion, Klonopin, and Ativan. Docs usually are reluctant to prescribe these for long-term...They're more of a short-term remedy...due to their addictive potential.  So, that's the meds I know of...Ask your doc what he thinks would be best for you...I will tell ya--that if you're gonna go for a script--try Rozerem or Trazodone. If you're going to go for otc...try Sleep MD...|`|niVQkQ35aa	I stopped taking ambien quite a while ago because I was getting very weird side effects.  I was on trazadone (the generic name) for a while, but it made me too sleepy in the morning.  Now I take restoril and really like it.  Recntly, my psychiatrist suggested taking 3 mg of melatonin instead of the restoril to see if it worked.  It actually did work quite well.  You may want to try that before starting another medication.|`|WXExyAlWaa	I take 100mg seroquel in the evening - it's actually an antipsychotic, but it's used as a mild sedative as well. Before that I had zopiclone/imovane, which actually is a sleeping pill.|`|B4YESGmwaa	Roberto, I am in recovery and try to avoid taking anything mood altering. But like you I have trouble sleeping. My Pain Management doctor started me on -tizandine 4 mg at bed time. It does not knock you out like Ambien and I don't have that hung over feeling in the morning. It is actually a muscle relaxer for my neck and back but it's great for sleep. God Bless Reggie
OP7lLIitaa	be sure to clean it regularly and keep it bandaged i wish i could have seen u pull it out ive seen alot of nasty stuff but  none like that try antibotic cream and an antiseptic|`|AA11605300	Bandage it up after cleaning it and go see the doctor before it gets infected. You may need stitches to close the wound. Don't wait too long.|`|eNxjbBIRaa	Clean it with alcohol.  Then put neosporin, or an equivalent, on it and bandage it.  It'll heal to smooth flesh on the bottom of the hole in a week or two.  It'll heal to no more hole in some (six or so) months time.
u4liwDhAaa	Like you said, you will be alone but you won't be alone because you will be making conversation with people on your trip.  I think you'll be fine.  When you want to talk, go out and make a friend.  When you want to be still, you'll be on the road traveling or in a hotel room.  It's not like you will be alone at the North pole where there isn't anyone to talk to at all.  You are still going to be around people.  Your sanity will stay healthy!  :])|`|NpyNm8tPaa	I guess is depends on how social a person you are.  I know some people that would be fine without social interaction for that extent of time but I also know a few that would completely loose it.  Just talk to yourself (as crazy as some people make it seem). I do it all the time!!  If you really need to talk to someone, use a phone.|`|LC3Gf5uBaa	ask a truck driver. they do it for a living|`|8abc5b9cab61ed51f5b3b0ffd3f6ca5aaa	You'll probably be fine.  I'm assuming you'll keep in touch with your friends via blog, email, facebook and phone?  And you'll meet people along the way.  Investigate the network of youth hostels across the country.  There are some incredibly interesting people who use them, and you will no doubt be one of them.    Enjoy your trip, it sounds fabulous!  Remember to take all safety precautions.|`|WXExyAlWaa	If you're a naturally introverted person you should actually be pretty fine. I spent a month by myself a year and a half ago while my parents were in the UK on holiday and I rarely spoke to anyone - occasionally I saw my brother, and I exchanged pleasantries with checkout staff at the supermarket a couple of times, but essentially I spent the entire month alone and loved it.
AA11605300	It's possible because Cipro takes a while to leave your system completely. Still, keep an eye on it because it can be viral, also.
9TyrKyK6aa	first of all i want to tell you that you are LUCKY to wear a size 40 D, at any age let alone 14. but guys are perverted and when they see big boobs, they stare.. theres nothing you can really do about it and at age 14, you probably dont want to get a breast reduction. in a few years, if you still hate your chest, get a reduction then, not now.|`|YNDMwFEJaa	Sorry but theres nothing you can do to stop it, the same thing always happends to me.All u can do is when a guy is talking to you and looking down at ur boobs and not ur face, is say hey a**hole im up here!      hope this helps.|`|0S5qfrncaa	Well first off if there doing this tell them to **** off. That should do the trick!|`|OY6R4ZP1aa	WOW!!! I have big boobbs but i am a 36 C and i am 14 yrs old.  You  need to stop letting boy take advanteage tell them to shut up  or dont hug them. Tell a teacher of somthing|`|426a3dee7ed8c56e74b81f48767f2bbaaa	You should yelled rape about the brother. There's not much you can do about your size except them and wear modest cloths. By the way I'm a guy.|`|QUruaE3Taa	tell them that they are gaywads and perverts for staring at your boobs! thats how girls are! they HAVE BOOBS!! and guys just over react about it! they are always like.... staring at em and talking about them. dont worry sweety. they are just bitches. maybe....wear larger shirts that arent very tight.|`|4zoN1U3Waa	Am so sorry I know it must be awful for you.You do know you can report these things.Nobody has a right to do this to you.Next time a guy grabs them slap them hard.It doesn`t matter if you are on school grounds or not, slap them hard.If they report it tell the truth.  You can report any boob grabber to a teacher or police.  You can also report anyone who throw these humiliating comments too.|`|gwh3o6zzaa	wear t-shirts or clothes with quite noticeable patterns. you will notice the pattern other than your chest.|`|Rg17JbMDaa	try exercising and maybe look into getting a chest reduction if it causes health issues.     people will always stare if you are being sexually harassed then report it.|`|NgAaenfuaa	get a breast reduction.  or just dont wear padded or push up bras all the time that make your cleavage hang out.|`|vDMASHmLaa	wear hugely loose pull over sweaters. guys are perves|`|zjZvJJLpaa	kick them in their special place xD also, you could wear loose fitting shirts, that should help, especially if the neckline is higher up. Screen tees would probably be good because they are generally loose and have a high neckline|`|eNhVVmG7aa	You don't have to put up with direct abuse or harrassment, either in the home or at school.  You can and should complain to a teacher, you parents, etc. and let them handle it.  But as for just the leering and little snide comments, you're a prisoner of immaturity.  You're only 14 and your friends are similar ages.  Your body is becoming adult, but sadly your friends' minds are not yet making the grade.  You've also learned that not all 17 year olds have any level of maturity either.   I think you need to find more mature (not necessarily older, but definitely more mature) friends.    And, I hope every young woman who is about to send out one of those "my boobs are so small, when will they grow, will pills make them bigger" questions on yahoo will read your post and count their blessings.  Getting a head start on breast development isn't the panacea or pleasure so many think it will be, is it?    Good luck, dear. I'm sorry, welcome to the world of adolescence.    John Jones, M.D.|`|iRlMufq4aa	Oh I have been in that situation many times I'm a 38DD and they get a lot of attention. Best way to do it is to wear custom bras more importantly cloth types with no under wire that way you get some support and they make your breasts look smaller but you can start having breast reduction at around 20 when it is the safest but you can get it done as early as 18
WXExyAlWaa	The doctor is easier than the mother. You can just straight out say "I've been feeling really depressed lately" and tell him if you haven't been sleeping well, if you've had changes in appetite or attention span, if you aren't enjoying things you used to, etc - these are all classic symptoms of depression.    As for your mother, it depends on your relationship with her. If it's a fairly good one you should be able to say "I haven't been feeling that great lately" and hopefully that will open a conversation about it.|`|5AaMDz91aa	Bringing up any kind of a conversation with a doctor or family member could be very difficult.  Here are some ways that I reccomend starting up a conversation:    "Mom, can you please not judge me and listen to what I am saying?"    "Mom, I need you to be understanding of me."    "I've been going through some tough times, and I'd appriciate it if you could listen with an open mind."    "Doctor, I've been feeling odd lately."    "Doctor, I think I'm depressed.  Can you help me?"    "Mom, my life has been changing.  I really felt that you would like to know what's going on in my life, so I thought that I'd tell you some news about it now."    I know that it will be hard to start a conversation, but good luck.  I wish you well.  Kadie|`|bEZkEyYEaa	Trust me, it is way easier than you think. I was diagnosed at 15. It's so common, you don't need to feel awkward about it. Just tell your mom, she will want you to get help for it. Your doctor will prescribe you something, a lot of people end up trying more than one medication, but the first one I got worked. I've been off and back on it 3 times, and I know what a huge difference it makes.|`|7mrtqwJwaa	Say something like "mom can I talk to you about something", and then go from there. It may be a little hard and awkward so it may help to practice alone in the mirror. it should be easier to tell the doctor, just say you've been feeling depressed lately. Hope I helped, bye.
QBUypAmAaa	I don't think it's a bad idea. I had a few when I was teen, I'm 21 now, and I have to say it's more fun masturbating with other people, I wouldn't mind having one again either lol.    Of course like you said your other guy friends may not be too keen about it. The best way would be to do one on one with another guy, just the 2 of you, 4 can come later. Since it's your first time just another is all you need to find out how you feel about it and how to approach another guy to try it out. You two can bet on who has the bigger one and pull it out to compare then mutually masturbate each other, it's not gay, just sort of bonding, experimenting, and exploring the male body. Of course if the other guy is uncomfortable, back off, it's not about force or coercion, but fun.|`|AA11785060	Just invite them over, put on the video, and offer washcloths for anyone who might want one. Plus of course snacks. Then take the lead, let them know you are gonna get more comfortable and they are free to do so as well.  Once one guy does it most will generally join in.  But you might want to clue in one or two close buddies first what you plan. Like, after the video starts and your close bud next to you is sporting an obvious tent--- telling him to take care of it, since you plan to do the same.  Good luck.|`|2SSD6BP9aa	Yes I have.  It's a lot of fun!  Sometimes it was just where each guy jerks himself, and sometimes where each guy jerks the one to his right and we make a circle.    I'm gay but most of the other guys were straight.  And yes, a few times it led to more than just stroking - usually me taking care of the others.|`|72iZuDjeaa	whatever floats your boat dude...  i don't know if 4 guys counts as a circle... but that's my answer ;-)|`|aH0yYcTIaa	yes, but I ended up in the middle, Ithink then its called a *******|`|96cd1744acaf1e87751ac1ec9c729b19aa	Yes. It's fun.   If things get out of hand it's a good idea to have condoms and lubricant ready, for your comfort and safety dear.|`|PpKJIT0aaa	For the answerers who think it's gay (sure, there's an element of that to it), you'd be amazed how many married, heterosexual guys go to their mate's place once a month, watch sports, drink a few beers, get naked and jack off. It's a guy thing. Sometimes, a gay thing, too, but definitely both types can and do do it. Just as many do not. Whatever works.|`|oAUAcz4Caa	no and it's not gay.|`|Fgz5xWxOaa	yes, but I am gay.    It seems odd that a bunch of straight guys would want to masturbate with no girls around, but I guess if you are young and curious, its not that bad.  Watch girl porn so you can at least focus on that and not each other.  Just be prepared for some friends to freak out and others to accept.  and maybe one or two to like what they see.....after all, it IS experimenting and when you experiment, you never know how you'll feel until you do it.|`|fJFgoYo4aa	dude... if you ask me i think thats totally gay... i wouldnt even be able to be erect|`|0mXQODsIaa	no, and i think it is gay. seeing your friends whack off? how the hell is that not gay? and how could you get off with some dude jacking it next to you?|`|iASdeAdJaa	whats the point of jerking off with other dudes im mean honestly why would u want to?i think u must be gay jerking off should be done alone or with the aid of a women|`|fJQrxgZ6aa	over 18 here and had several and love to have more
r1nKp9ELaa	its not like its going to get you hooked and cigs again but it might help. just the overall mindset of smoking might get you back into it. and cigars arnt very good for you. and they dont do anything.|`|AuvMZYTSaa	Not a good idea as the temptation to pick up smoking will be intensified
LczX2O6aaa	Sounds like the flu. But the stiff neck can be a sign of something more serious. Can she touch her chin to her chest?|`|k7jInxBXaa	sounds like a cold to me
AG9msdUDaa	If I don't eat right or take my supplements I feel like that and I can sleep for up to 22h. It's crazy. I found for me it was a combination of too little B vitamins and Omega 3 in my diet. I used to just take a multivitamin in the morning, and when that didn't solve my issue, I added a B complex and the omega 3 and now I jump out of bed full of energy every morning. I was really shocked at how effective this is. You can give it a try. I prefer to get my supplements from mercola.com, but can only afford to do so every once in a while. Otherwise I just go to any local natural health food store and ask for the most bioavailable (meaning, easily absorbed by the body - more bang for your buck) supplement and they point me in the right direction. If you are worried about other causes of your sleep issue, you can see a doctor although most of them will only give you textbook answers. Go see a natruopath or homeopath or just a manager/owner of a health food store for real advice that will actually work. Doctors know this, but are bound by law not to recommend these kinds of treatments because it makes the medical profession look bad.|`|ehBPus3Zaa	Yes, it could be sleep apnea. My husband would do what you have described, and they did a sleep study on him. He wasn't getting into the 3rd REM stage of sleep (deepest sleep). He would actually quit breathing at least 20-30 seconds at first. It gradually got worse before we got him treated. The doctor said if you are more prone to snoring, then you can have sleep apnea. Your throat muscles relax too much and it closes off the air ways. We had to put him on a machine that forces his air way open so he can breathe. It is a mask that you wear on your face around your mouth and nose.|`|VcCxGEiAaa	This happened to me and I found out I had a severe case of mono that was undiagnosed for months.  Exact same feeling--I'd have slept for 12 hours of something and feel extremely exhausted.  So just got to your doc and see if they can help you.  It could be that, or maybe it is a sleep condition (sorry, I'm not too familiar with those.)  Hope that helps!|`|1keH3R6paa	I am not quite sure, but see your doctor and see what he can do. Sounds like a condition.

ufgv7oTjaa	Ketamine actually is the name of the drug. If you're in need of it, visit your doctor and you should be able to get a prescription if it's needed. Good luck!|`|Ts33DJSwaa	what do you need ketermine for??? that is a seriously powerful drug used as a tranquiliser for HORSES!!    check out:    www.uniteagainstdrugs.com    for info on many drugs and their effects on the body, brain and mind!|`|0UOBKhLiaa	ask a zoo vet|`|78Xb7enMaa	It's a horse tranquilizer and as such really not a good idea for humans to take it.|`|7syjNjwhaa	Ketamine is normally used in its pure form on humans which is extremely rare. Unless you have an massive accident or injure yourself extremely badly where you would experience unbearable pain, you will not get any legally and even then it's the last resort that doctors would use as a tranquiliser. You can get in form of tablets, powder or injection (liquid). Some ecstasy pills may be a mix that contain small amounts of ketamine. Seriously if you really want some, you have to get it from a dealer.|`|PoVODmciaa	you should stay away from it. its an animal tranquiliser, its kinda like the new heroin
AA11315360	If you have any mouth sore for more than 14 days then you need to see a doctor or dentist (or both for 2 opinions). It may be something more serious. It could be herpes simplex virus 1 (cold sore) and not a cancer sore. So my advice is go see your primary care doctor immediately and see a dentist.|`|8uNXjNknaa	Hello! My brother always says to get rid of a "canker sore", mix salt with water then swoosh it in your mouth. Spit it out. The salt helps it go away! Don't bite down it it, it makes it even worse.|`|cYsPx9sSaa	they wont ever go    if you get them one, they wont ever go, they arent always visible, but theyre there, try getting something from your pharmacist or something
9d60a294b6864b585406ddb61a14d757aa	This is one of the easiest dianosis that can be made.  Any thick mucousy discharge from the eye that is greenish or yellowish in color is highly diagnostic of a BACTERIAL eye infection.  Just like you and me, when a bacteria metabolizes (eats) it creates by products (poop).  These bacterial by products are characterisically yellowish to greenish in color.  So what you have coming out of your eye is bacteria poop.  You need to go in and get a prescription for an antibiotic like Zymar or Vigamox or one of the other good ones out there and you should be just fine.  If you want to try and get by without seeing the eye doctor then you can try this.  Get a hot wet wash rag and ring it out so it's not dripping.  Now get a heating pad (make sure it won't short out if it gets wet), and hold the wash rag over one eye with the heating pad keeping it hot (but not so hot as to burn).  Hold it there for five minutes or so then switch to the other eye for five minutes or so.  Do this back and forth for about an hour four times a day.  The wet heat will dilate the blood vessels in the tissues of your eye and allow more blood to enter these tissues.  This extra blood will bring with it more of your own body's antibodies that are capable of killing the bacteria.  If you do this consistantly for 3 to 4 days you may be able to beat this on your own.  It really would be more convenient to just use an antibiotic though.  And your cure would be assured.    EDIT:  To "The Crimson Pirate".  I would refer you to the web site for the "Oklahoma Association of Optometric  Physicians.  This will increase your knowledge.    oaop.org      .|`|8abc5b9cab61ed51f5b3b0ffd3f6ca5aaa	You don't say what part of you it's coming out of, but those colors are never a good sign.  They are indicative of infection and you should see a doctor immediately.|`|3c9884a48bc1c45a71c49ad35ed68daeaa	You have a bacterial conjunctivitis caused in all likelihood by poor ocular hygiene or contact with a.n.other.  It is self limiting ie it will clear up by itself in time....one week?.........but you can help get rid of it with chloramphenicol eye drops from a UK pharmacy without prescription. Resist the temptation to touch your eyes.......you`ll just prolong the healing process. You can make a saline mixture to rinse and comfort till you get the drops..........a teaspoonful of salt added to  one pint of boiling water and allowed to cool.    Yagman claims to be an optometric physician.To my knowledge there is no such designation of either optometrist or physician.
AG9msdUDaa	I am pretty sure you will have to wait because there will be a bracket glued to each individual tooth for the braces to be done properly, so if only half of that tooth is out, then the bracket, if glued to it, would screw up the remaining growth and orientation of it. Sorry hon, I know you probably want to just get them done and over with, trust me I know. I had to have them twice because the first guy screwed them up so I had to go to someone else when I was 25! So better do it right the first time and not have to worry about it ever again. But just get a consult, maybe he can just work around that tooth anyway, who knows. Best to ask the guy who will be putting them on to know for sure. At the end of the day, he still wants to get paid so maybe he has a cleaver work around for that kind of issue ;) I have heard Invisalign is twice as much as regular braces and can take twice as long. As well, it is only for minor issues, so if you have a lot of crooked teeth, they won't work for you.|`|7cM2oRoEaa	no, but you have to lose all your baby teeth|`|kt9iXMWUaa	This is a questions for you to ask your dentist/orthadontist, since each opinion is different.  They will be able to tell you what's right for you.  My son is 12 and he is suppose to get his braces on after he loses all his baby teeth.  However, he still has about six more to lose.  That's a lot of teeth.     Good Luck!|`|QUJIwRUcaa	Well, I for one know that you can get braces whenever your orthadontist says so. I had braces fr...4 months I think. I just lost my last 3 baby teeth last month, and I got my palate Expander and my braces taken out a week before that, so... Depends|`|5misbMnOaa	You don't have to loose all of your teeth before getting braces. Most orthodontists wait till you have lost all of your teeth though.|`|saLuwXltaa	To get invisalign ALL of your teeth must grow in, because each set of liners is made to shift your permanent teeth a little every 2.5 weeks. with braces you have to ahve ll your teeth, but if ones still coming in you can get braces, they just attach the bracket to that tooth and it is basically pulled down by the wire and elastics|`|alKRRKzEaa	I really don't know, but I think so. If you get braces and your teeth straightened and then a tooth comes out, the one that grows after that might come out crooked and push out the other teeth and the braces you got would've been a total waste of money and time|`|f44757950e6981406533ab57629ce42faa	You should wait untill all your teeth are in good or your teeth will grow strangely when you get braces tooken off.I still had one baby tooth when I got braces and that I have them off and now I have one crooked tooth.
QuIXgBosaa	MINE OMG OMG I CAN NOT BELIVE IT I CAN HOLD IT ONLY FOR 81/2 MIN|`|ygimTNzoaa	Depends on the person. average person before they pass out or die I think is 2 mins. That's with the whole struggling for your life part in there too lol. That's also a guess, not a fact.|`|PEvWgIkVaa	2 minutes for me then i gotta breath xD|`|ivlOxlG6aa	1 min. i swim a lot so.|`|ycNt74yyaa	Personally I can only hole it for about 2 minutes. You might be interested to know that David Blaine sits atop a sphere where he set a new world record for breath-holding, Wednesday, April 30, 2008, at 17 minutes and 4.4 seconds, during a live telecast of The Oprah Winfrey Show in Chicago. Crazy right!!! :)|`|BLiGZnU3aa	The average adult person is about 3-4 minutes.|`|MpG8n0vMaa	1 and 45 seconds idk y tho|`|sw2C2gMwaa	My lungs aren't the strongest.. About 30 seconds!|`|f582421fab21195960a57126a91727beaa	huh?     do you mean,'' how long can you hold your breath? ''    I can do it for about 2-3 minuets. but to be a navy diver you need to be able to do it for  270seconds( 4.5 mins)  minimum. there are people who can do if for 13-14 mins. It's all about lung capacity, and cardiovascular fitness.|`|9EdJHqKHaa	depends on your cardio-respiratory health and training. Olympic swimmers and synchronized swimmer train their bodies to hold their breath for much longer then the average person.|`|yJROr3Iraa	i thought david blaine TRIED to do it for 9 minutes but failed, huh.  i think he got like 5 or 6  most people, when forced, can hold their breath for up to 4 minutes but if your just challenging yourself, probably like 30 seconds - 2 minutes   me - 52 seconds but probably less under water|`|mr5qcM3Laa	the average human can survive about 3 minutes without breathing.|`|FTs2py0kaa	somewhere between 30 seconds and 2 minutes..the deep free divers up to 7 minutes..google for your own references........|`|0e2dcf078f31fa4438e1cbf0ec8784ecaa	Not long, I've got a lung condition so it's probably more decreased than most - all I know is that it takes me about 10 blows to fully blow up a balloon|`|0n9fLYGvaa	not long like 30 seconds|`|il14uGAlaa	It really depends. Singers might be able to hold it for longer than other people, and some people in other countries who dive for pears in the ocean can hold their breath for up to five minutes!!|`|ZytMT3sLaa	80 years.|`|QWFvw2yvaa	normally about 2 minutes, but if you train yourself you could probably go for 5.|`|DuGKtqAkaa	It depends..  For me I have smoked for years so when I hold my breath under water  I can't do it for very long, probably less than a minute.    Terrible thing..don't smoke!|`|jL28ladCaa	like 2 minutes but 3 minutes if you hyperventilate first.|`|kqCFJhsMaa	35 seconds:O|`|3UXrjynaaa	As long as it wants. I think what you're trying to ask is: how long can you hold your breath without dying?    Its all subjective.|`|CTYvekS5aa	1 minute. i practiced in science class last year and had competitions against other people because class was so boring.|`|Xo5S384yaa	the longest i've heard is , till DEATH|`|evXyQqbLaa	The average person can be fully functional under water for a couple of minutes without any fresh air.    Our brain tells us to exhale when the carbon dioxide level in our lungs reaches a certain threshold. After thirty seconds have passed, we really want to start breathing again because that threshold has been met, and likely surpassed. Keep at it long enough, and you'll really start to feel uncomfortable. The important consideration is that we decide to breathe based on CO2 buildup rather than the lack of oxygen in our lungs.
yPsbcrkkaa	Below I have given side effects for both drugs. Actually yes, you can get addicted to any drug....a drug is essentially a poison. Taken in small amounts a drug can have a temporary beneficial effect, however taken in larger doses can be harmful and even fatal (cause death).   Drugs dull down the perceptions so one does not FEEL the aches and pains, however the aches and pains are STILL PRESENT...just you are not able to perceive them anymore. The body becomes accustomed to most drugs so that gradually the amount of drug you "need" to get the same effect is MORE, and THAT is the addictive aspect to any drug. To understand more about how drugs do this read:  http://www.scientologyhandbook.org/SH7.H...    I suggest you shift to relieving your aches and pains by taking calcium and magnesium which are both minerals and not drugs, and they both are important in the body nervous system and in healing. There is a drink you can make that is a very effective way of having these minerals.         You can often get the drink as a powder at health food shops. It works REALLY well to deal with aches and pains and would be perfect for your needs as a gymnast. Hope this helps! (Side effects of Aleve and Motrin below)        Aleve (Naproxen) side effects:    Naproxen can cause stomach ulcers that bleed. The chance of   this serious problem increases the longer you take naproxen and   with higher doses of naproxen. Stomach bleeding can also   happen suddenly while you take naproxen. Stop taking naproxen   and call your healthcare provider right away if you get:   ? A burning stomach pain   ? Black bowel movements that look like tar   ? Vomit that looks like blood or coffee grounds     Allergic reactions: Naproxen can cause serious allergic   reactions, including asthma-like symptoms (problems breathing,   swallowing, and wheezing) and rash.   Liver damage: Stop taking naproxen and tell your doctor right   away if you have nausea, vomiting, tiredness, loss of appetite,   itching, yellow coloring of skin or eyes, flu-like symptoms, and   dark urine.   Kidney problems: Naproxen can cause serious kidney problems,   including sudden kidney failure or worsening of kidney problems   that you already have.   Fluid retention: Naproxen can cause fluid retention (holding of   water in your body) and swelling. Fluid retention can be a serious   problem if you have high blood pressure or heart failure.   Pregnancy: Do not take naproxen during your last 3 months of   pregnancy because it may cause problems in the unborn child or   complications during delivery. Tell your doctor if you are   pregnant or planning to become pregnant     Motrin Sire Effects    More common motrin side effects may include:  Abdominal cramps or pain, abdominal discomfort, bloating and gas, constipation, diarrhea, dizziness, fluid retention and swelling, headache, heartburn, indigestion, itching, loss of appetite, nausea, nervousness, rash, ringing in ears, stomach pain, vomiting    Less common or rare motrin side effects may include:  Abdominal bleeding, anemia, black stool, blood in urine, blurred vision, changes in heatbeat, chills, confusion, congestive heart failure, eepression, dry eyes and mouth, emotional volatitity, fever, hair loss, hearing loss, hepatitis, high or low blood pressure, hives, inability to sleep, inflammation of nose, inflammation of the pancreas or stomach, kidney or liver failure, servere allergic reactions, shortness of breath, skin eruptions or peeling, sleepiness, stomach or upper intestinal ulcer, ulcer of gums, vision loss, vomiting blood, wheezing, yellow eyes and skin.    Special warnings about motrin:  Peptic ulcers and bleeding can occur without warning. Tell your doctor if you have bleeding or any other problems.    This drug should be used with caution if you have kidney or liver disease, or are severely dehydrated; it can cause liver or kidney inflammation or other problems in some people.    Do not take aspirin or any other anti-inflammatory medications while taking Motrin unless your doctor tells you to do so.    If you have a severe allergic reaction, seek medical help immediately.    Motrin may cause vision problems. If you experience any changes in your vision, inform your doctor.    Mortin may prolong bleeding time. If you are taking blood-thinning medication, this drug should be taken with caution.    This drug can cause water retention. It should be used with caution if you have high blood pressure or poor heart function.    Avoid the use of alcohol while taking this medication.    Motrin may mask the usual signs of infection or other diseases. Use with care in the presence of an existing infection.    If you have diabetes, remember that the suspension contains 1.5 grams of sucrose and 8 calories per teaspoonful.    Motrin chewable tablets contain phenylalanine. If you have a hereditary disease called phenylketonuria, you should be aware of this.|`|YjV1MLLVaa	Any drug after it's taken for awhile builds up a tolerance. It could be withdrawals but I doubt it. I think if anything it's more of a mental addiction and your body just getting used to a change.|`|4dfbcf738541ddcd8d3291d2dbbb44deaa	Yes,it is. One can become addicted to just about anything. Sometimes the addiction is physical, sometimes it's all in the head. I doubt if the pills are causing you to be sick. But I would suggest seeing a doctor to have this checked out.|`|fvuEtkROaa	It is highly unlikely that you are addicted to these medications in the quantity that you use.  These are not considered addictive medications.  You might try acetaminophen as an alternative once in a while.  Keep up the gymnastics... what a wonderful sport !|`|3fQ1eIMqaa	yep it is possible to become addicted to pain killers, kelly osbourne has had painkiller addictions x|`|3pfhWdRKaa	Motrin and Aleve are both anti-inflammatory drugs that work to reduce fever and pain. Taking them constantly may cause your body to depend on their help when dealing with infection. Once you stop taking them a small infection has the opportunity to show itself. Otherwise, neither of these are addictive.|`|PLu40QgBaa	No i dont think you can with over the counter pain medicine. There's no addictive traits in it. Go to google or yahoo and put just that in. " Is aleve addictive"  But im going with the no side on this one.
BRTygirmaa	on the right side, i had that tooth pulled, and on the left side i had the one behind that pulled because my mouth was too corwded.    just made sure that if they give you rubber bands, you WEAR them. I got them pulled like a year ago and you cant even tell. but you could for two months or so. it is going to hurt, especially if they put a power chain above them, because there is going to be a lot of moving going on.  you just have to realize its for the best, and its going to end up looking GREAT.    you also have to realize that you are going to realize it SO much more than anyone else. you are going to be self concious about it, so it is only going to make it worse.    Good luck and remember to do everything the ortho tells you to do! (:|`|2d06c0153306ba2df996f0be3ce4e82caa	I had that exact same thing when I had braces.  Are they going to try and pull your teeth down with wire into place to fill the holes?  That is how they did it for me.  It was actually a lot faster than I expected.  I think it was 2 or three months.  It might seem like forever, but you wont remember how long it took.  I had braces for 5 years from Jr High to High School.  I was sure that my life would never recover, and that braces would be the most difficult thing that I would have to go through.  Now, 7 years after my braces were removed, I have a perfect smile and I hardly remember that period in my life.
6SIjchQUaa	ALERT THE MEDIA!!!!  Notify the American Cancer Society, and the American Lung Association and all the doctors around the world.  You have solved the problem of nicotine addiction!  WOW!  All of the billions of dollars spent by smokers trying to quit and by the Surgeon General trying to get smokers to quit have been wasted.  All any of us smokers needed was you and your oh so interesting month long experience with nicotine gum!      Smokers, now that you have read of this experiment, join with me lets just put those cigarettes out and praise BeyOND who has the answers to our quit smoking prayers!  Who knew it could be so easy.  Certainly not this 35 year smoker!      Buddy, you have no idea what you are talking about.|`|44BEm1Uhaa	Now...Try the same experiment using cigarettes instead...See how easy it is to quit....Not the same.|`|db35fb694f31e55fc8e70ca5bcb5b351aa	Smoking the actualy cigarettes is far more addictive than what you did, trust me.  My dad smoked for 30 years and when he got cancer, he did try to quit. I know that if it weren't extremely difficult he would've stopped.|`|1uyhFsFsaa	you don't have a clue what you are talking about how can you put yourselves in the same situation as someone that has been a smoker for years. it is not just the nicotine they have to give up and the gum does not give you the same buzz as a cigarette.  i think you are being very naive in criticizing people about an addiction that you know nothing about. some people can give up easier than others if you are filling your body with a drug of any kind for years on end it is common sense that you are not going to give up easily.   if your body is used to that regular intake of nicotine of course it is going to have a physical effect if you suddenly stop giving your body what it is used to having.  stop trying to re create someones addiction just so you can try and be a smart alec and pretend you are some kind of expert.  get on with living a healthy life instead of forcing drugs into your system just to try and prove a point unsuccessfully
rnQjDbAdaa	If your period is coming in solid blocks that's really weird and abnormal and probably not healthy.  You need to get in to see a gynecolegist ASAP.  Talk to your mom about getting an appointment.|`|mjshqfuyaa	ouch that doest sound to good.   it it is litterally solid like hard i would go to see a doctor.   but if its just big globs of goop that is totally normal.|`|tO7e262zaa	I would visit the gynecologist.
rnQjDbAdaa	Anything that vibrates is pretty fun.  Razors like Venus and Fusion have powered versions that feel amazing (just make sure you take off the blade first), an electric toothbrush, pretty much anything that resembles a vibrator or anything that has an interesting texture.|`|XsAZNx2Eaa	a big fat cucumber|`|GyQEGpqTaa	I used to use a showerhead and then i came across this site.  http://www.healthystrokes.com/  The site tells you everything about masturbation and I am now using my hands.  Showerheads can cause problems for you older. When you have sex you may not be able to have an orgasm from your boyfriend/husband because of using a showerhead|`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	Electric toothbrush, no one will ever know.|`|AA11987492	A venus razor is GREAT, just make sure you take off the blades first, you don't want to be cutting your fingers up!
xtq6LdZTaa	why would you want to do this?  i absolutely hate people that try to 'freak me out' by waving their hands in front of my face or doing dumb stuff like that when im high. it just gets really annoying. your not going to freak anyone out, you are just going to be annoying. this is the dumbest question on the site|`|aH0yYcTIaa	call the cops! they'll freak out when they get arrested, its fun to watch|`|1f644ebbaa	Don't mess with people when they are high. You just ruin their high. If you want to make yours better then find a different way to do it. Its selfish to ruin someones high just to make yours better.
fgcBzYtdaa	wait a bit longer before you shake?
8abc5b9cab61ed51f5b3b0ffd3f6ca5aaa	Yes, it works if you don't have a reading disability.    I don't know the study either, but it's common.  I first heard about it in grad school.|`|PMRtOszgaa	dude thats awsome! it works! ..
OP7lLIitaa	yes itll feel different but remember the pill isnt 100 percent|`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	Try better quality condoms. There are some very cheap and badly produced condoms for sale. The quality of sex is mostly in the brain. If you think is worse then it will be worse, if you think it will still be good then it will be good.  Have you tried diaphragms? Use contraceptive foam in combo with the diaphragm|`|qicRLHMLaa	It is a lot better without a condom.|`|6ce30766a545694d9f60976802874a8baa	It does feel better, and more natural. But just be aware that the pill isn't 100% effective, and if you forget to take it, your more susceptible to pregnancy.|`|baaf30673b204103b269ddf718be2c5caa	Sex without a condom is, I have to say, a lot better for the guy. We lose a lot of feeling when we have a condom on, but it does mean that we can last longer.    Anyway, if you take the pill properly, then the risk of pregnancy is about the same as with a condom.|`|9N6sW6KAaa	im too cool|`|7mCCAqXzaa	yes it is there isnt the cudding and foreplay then stop to put on the condom then continue then wondering if it will break or slip off. you go from foreplay to the actual sex act without pausing to put on the condom. NOW the thing your going to have to deal with is his stuff that he deposits into you will tend to leak out though the day. Sex is much better without the condom for both partners    curtdude|`|6ix7aBSRaa	It feels much better and complete. I just hope you're careful.
PAvYZJK2aa	yes we do|`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	*****'S are wonderful. It dominates your whole system, especially the brain. The story of guys getting "blue ****'s is a myth used by men to get cooperation for their "pain".|`|AA11785060	Of course they can feel it. Especially if wearing any clothing at all, which will constraint it and can make it uncomfortable. Just being nude and getting an erection, it doesn't hurt at all.  Feels wonderful, of course.|`|72iZuDjeaa	yes, we feel it,,, and it only hurts if you can't set it free ;-)|`|37yBB96Iaa	it feels good...doesn't hurt if you don't bite.....|`|ehnxg6Utaa	yes we know when it's hard.  feels like a harden muscle that needs to be massaged until it goes soft or put into something hot wet and warm to relive the pressure of being hard.|`|OP7lLIitaa	yes they do and no it doesnt|`|YCMr0xI4aa	its just feels different.|`|1f644ebbaa	Yes they know. They may not notice when it first starts growing, sometimes they don't know until its fully grown. No it does not hurt. Unless something is wrong at the time. The only other time when it hurts is the very first time they get one, maybe a couple times after too.|`|lQ8p2QKkaa	It feels. I don't know, like you can feel your arm moving. It does'nt hurt unless you are wearing extra super tight diver suit or something. And even then it would'nt hurt that bad. :P Like a tight squeeze or something.|`|3AY5lS9saa	Does it hurt? far from it. It's great|`|9N6sW6KAaa	yes we feel it it feels like a muscle is moving then its like you have a finger down there and you are touching your briefs hopefully that helped|`|QBUypAmAaa	I've answered a question similar to this before, but here's my input.  Getting an erection feels wonderful, it usually doesn't hurt, unless it's trapped in your pants or underwear, because it gets really stiff and enlarged. Also if a man hasn't orgasmed in a long time it can hurt to get one, because more than likely he's much more aroused than normal, so his penis will be harder, thicker, and slightly longer than normal, because it's entirely filled with blood. Getting a hard-on/erection feels like you've got a lot of energy and aching desire all focused in one area on your body. A flowing sensation, sensitive and tender, pulsating and beating along with your heartbeat, kind of feels like your whole body is centered on just one point for that moment. Admittedly, definitely one of my most favorite feelings, with orgasm ranking higher.|`|mjDdy67Jaa	yes we feel it, it feels hard, and no it doesnt hurt|`|PMRtOszgaa	yes they feel it..but it doesnt hurt lol....why u asking this question lol?|`|Bp1LHZQaaa	a what?|`|1tQef9edaa	Um, yes they do feel it. They know right away when they start to get hard.  It only hurts if it is hard for a long time and they don't get off. Or if it gets rubbed raw. ?? I don't know this is what my husband says??|`|PgxU0gBeaa	Yes we feel it.  Sometimes it starts to happen and I don't notice, but when its all the way, we feel it.  It sort of feels like stretching.  LOL  It doesn't hurt.  Whoever said it hurts the first time lies.  Baby boys can get hard before they are even born!  (Althoug its not a sexual thing, its a reflex just to keep everything working).    The only time it hurts is if I'm wearing extremely tight pants and its pointing down and it can't point up (but I usually try to prevent that).|`|UE2wUzs1aa	Yeah we feel it.  A part of our body just grew/became hard.  And no it doesn't hurt.  It feels like a lot of blood is rushing to one area.
WXExyAlWaa	The doctors should not refuse to help! It's their responsibility to get you the treatment you need, whatever it may be.    However, if they are, you could try looking through the yellow pages for counseling centres or ring a helpline. There will probably be places that provide low-cost counseling, you just need to call around to try to find one. People at helplines are trained to be helpful about this sort of thing.|`|QPyFTOhYaa	Hey i was in the exact same position as you i went to the docs loads of times and eventually he done a like a questionnaire on me and my marks was high so he referred me to a psychiatrist just keep telling him that you want someone to talk to don't give up most of the time that's what the doctors want you to do. But if you feel u need counselling that strongly just keep going and tell him.    I hope that helped good luck =)|`|cYsPx9sSaa	yellow pages?|`|fJaZlJQXaa	Well I went to my GP and she referred me for councelling.   If your doctor isnt being too helpful (thats very wrong as they are there to help with this kinda stuff) Could you go see a different doctor?  If not then look through your local phone book and you will find a counceller in there.|`|32e46f5365de97f08e8132dd292b1761aa	I am shocked that your GP refused to help, but there are other ways of finding a counsellor.  One way is to go private, however this isn't cheap, and depending where you live you can pay from 30 + per session.  You also need to make sure you find one who is properly qualified, you can look here:  http://www.bacp.co.uk/  And click on 'find a therapist'.    Alternatively your local library should have information of any local free or low cost counselling agencies in your area.  For example, I work two mornings a week at a Youth Counselling Service, where the counselling is offered to young people under the age of 25, and it is free.    You can also look in the Yellow Pages but make sure you find one who is either a Member of BACP  or UKCP , this will tell you they are properly qualified.|`|xUcjzYPdaa	Your GP can refer you, but there is often a waiting list, and the counselling offered is time limited - you'd only get approximately 8 sessions.    Schools, universities and most of the larger employers offer counselling to their students and employees.    Failing that, contact your local branch of MIND, who offer free counselling in many areas.|`|29ef5570cc8c35475759674bb6d5aa92aa	you know what, i think its amazing that youre being so positive about this and making such a positive step.    if you google counselling in your area then quite often youll get a list of counsellors etc that you could make an appointment with.    if youre at uni, most universities offer a counselling service; same with schools.    is there another GP you could see at your practice? or maybe even the receptionist would be able to give you information?    i hope this helps a little bit. good luck with everything.
9d60a294b6864b585406ddb61a14d757aa	Farsightedness DOES NOT MEAN that you cannot see things clearly at near.  It is UNBELIEVABLE how many times I hear this said.  It is not true.  It never has been true. And it never will be true.  This is what PRESBYOPIA does.  Presbyopia is the age related loss in the ability to see things clearly at near.      NOW, having said this, it is true that SOME people with farsightedness cannot see clearly at near.  But that only occurs when the individual also has presbyopia OR when the farsightedness is extremely high.  That is because FARSIGHTEDNESS means that the patient has to focus their eyes excessively in order to see clearly.  As long as you have the capablility to focus your eyes to the level demanded by your farsightedness, then you will be able to see clearly at near.  WHEW!!!!!!!    Now to answer your question.  It is true that most distance visual complaints are caused by nearsightedness.  But some people with small to moderte amounts of farsightedness, such as you, also have distance vision complaints.  Remember how I said that things would be clear for a farsighted person as long as the patient has the ability to focus the amount demanded by the farsightedness?  Some people have some focusing problems that make it where even small or moderate amounts of farsightedness cause visual symptoms when viewing distance objects.  It sounds like your doctor felt like you were needing a little bit of help because your farsightedness was interfering with your distance visual acuity.|`|JGtwyi9Kaa	Farsightedness is the condition where you can't see things that are near you. You have been given very slight prescriptions, +.50 and +.75 are used to correct vision that isn't really that bad. If you leave your glasses on ALL THE TIME, you will get used to them and really see a difference when you are not wearing them.    She gave you the glasses becasue not wearing them can make your eyes worse.    And if she didn't specifically tell you when to wear them, she wants you wearing them ALL THE TIME.|`|yC7jXmK1aa	That's weird... my prescription is -2.75 and I can't see things far away. Maybe you should go to another eye doctor..|`|AA11481525	Hi ----    Normally a prescription like yours is written to help you   see things better that are from zero to 20 feet from your eyes.    That's when you should see a benefit, if you don't, check back with the Doc.|`|im0OsH78aa	You went in to the doctor with a complaint.  Have you forgotten why you went in?  Why did you go to the doctor?  Do you still have the same complaint that you had before you went in?  Do you know what the symptoms of farsightedness are?  The glasses are for you to wear for both distance and near.  They are not "reading glasses."  You are better off with your glasses on.  Wear the glasses and be thankful for them.

JEXiKUmGaa	Individual mole removal can cost anywhere from $100 or more per mole, it really depends on the doctors pricing practice. I too had several moles I wanted to remove, but I didn't have the several hundred dollars to get this done.    I found an at home mole removal product called Dermatend, it comes in a small or large tube, depending how many moles you have depends on the size you need. I got the small tube from www.mole-wartremoval.com and so far I have removed 4 good sized moles, and there is still some left for a few more.    The small tube cost's $49.95 and the large is $79.95, I hope this helps you out, I know it sure helped me.|`|QA3qpa2jaa	If you don't want to pay mega bucks for surgery and would prefer the natural, at-home way, try this website:    http://www.earthclinic.com/CURES/moles.h...

Aj99vuqYaa	Say you were friends enough for them to trust you by telling you they're schizophrenic.... do not treat them any differently. It makes them feel horrible about themselves more than they already do/might. It's very comforting to have someone to talk to about it, that won't judge you or criticize you. Someone who doesn't think you're lying or making it up. Someone who will listen whenever you need to rant, that won't be always trying to give advice... that's annoying. Sometimes they just want to talk about it, and not be told "well you can do this" or "do that" or something. That gets REALLY old REALLY fast.|`|LBB9B8mFaa	You can help by providing a listening tolerant ear and love, patience and acceptance. Respect their delusional beliefs even if you don't believe them, be gentle in trying to make them realise when they are deluded|`|jXwHiAaWaa	well, it is probably best to take medicines such as anit-psychotics and use therapy to talk out what they're experiencing. if it gets really bad then hospitalisation.    here is a list about medicines for schizophrenia:  http://www.schizophrenia.com/meds.html    also i've included a really useful link below.    hope it helps x
QAM3gVs6aa	Overexhaustion of the mind, constantly revising and learning without rest can result to tiredness and loss of concentration becuase you'll be cramming alot of info and generally less aware because of the heavy workload. Its important to break up studying into blocks so that yuo revise and then rest and so on...|`|CTVexmFmaa	make you clever!!!!! (first of all) :))    it is recommended to study but as we know everything has a limit.  you should be organized in everything you do, especially in studying.    Organized studying means learning eficiently. so don't read just above the surface try do understand everything you read and every problem you solve... else you will loose a looooot of time and learn incorrectly.    if you do not learn organized then it means that you will spend a lot of time studying which can lead to tyredness, to unsociability (you might loose your friends, or important events, important parts of you life) and closeness (sometimes people who spend a lot of time learning are close people, they have no friends and do not speak much about their problems and ideas). so be careful    but, don't forget you have to learn... organized of course|`|AA12272806	Obviously, you aren't studying "too" much in spelling...    I don't think studying too much has an overall bad effect, except for becoming more knowledgeable, which isn't bad at all.    Depending on the person's health or activity level, it might have an effect on their health, if they sit in one place and study without getting exercises
q0nhx3veaa	Um. Well ask your friend if she washes it.     If she doesn't, ew. but if she does, than I doubt it.    And even if she doesn't, She would have had to have been having sex with him, then used it, which wouldn't make since. And If it was just a vibrator, then its a less chance it would have made its way into your vagina.    Take a pregnancy test but I just think your alittle late.     good luck!|`|4zoN1U3Waa	Depends on when the sperm bearer last used the vibrator.|`|tO7e262zaa	no ma'am you aren't. Unless you used it right after she did and she was with her man.      Please tell me you did wash it though. Cause bacteria and viruses can live for a bit depending on how much time between uses.|`|AA12023043	I really don't think you are pregnant. If you had missed a lot of months then you should be worried but other than that you should be fine good luck.|`|KLFIuFfzaa	No you can't be pregnant. You can only get pregnant if your friend had a boyfriend that came on the vibrator and you used it right after. Sperm die only a few seconds after they are out of the body. Don't worry about the period thing. I went two months with out a period and got it the next month.
9l0GdKbbaa	Definitely sounds like it. I have been diagnosed for 5 years now. You don't have to have the actual cysts on the ovaries to be diagnosed but you should still have an ultrasound. Your doctor will do blood work on you to check the levels of your FSH and LH.      But here's the scoop. Insulin is a hormone that controls the change of sugar, starches, and other food into energy right? For many women with PCOS, their bodies have problems using insulin so that too much insulin is in the body. Excess insulin appears to increase production of androgen's. (testosterone) This hormone is made in fat cells, the ovaries, and the adrenal gland. Now the levels of androgen are higher than normal and leads to acne, excessive hair growth on face, weight gain, stopped periods, and infertility.     Welcome to my world. My doctor put me on a diabetic medicine called Glucophage to balance my insulin levels out.     If you have any other questions feel free to IM me at wolfeyes_6|`|vn0DHMXWaa	It certainly sounds like PCOS - you are very smart for figuring it out.    Stand in front of a mirror and look at your neck for a darkish ring. Also check your armpits and elbows to see if they are dark. These are also signs of PCOS.   It is definitely time to visit the GYN, and ask them specifically about PCOS - these days, if you don't diagnose yourself first, then the doc is unlikely to even try. The fix is birth control pills, which willbe great.    For the weight, start walking for 15 minutes a day, and try to smoke cigarettes instead of eating for at least one meal a day, and use smoking to kill your appetite for the other ones. This will also help with the depression.|`|A4OM6nI9aa	suks for you...wtf is PCOS?|`|b34bca47be644e0ef6a339cf479e2cd8aa	That definitely sounds like some sort of hormonal imbalance.  It really sounds like PCOS, you need to see an endocrinologist they are the best for dealing with anything related to hormones.|`|mBMpQKKJaa	it could be PCOS, however, i had the same symptoms and dont have it, i have an imbalance in oestrogen. Unfortunately oestrogen imbalance is usually caused by being over weight, but once you have it its really difficult to loose weight :-( I have tried really hard and have lost nearly 4 stone and my periods are regular again and the facial hair is totally under control. The more weight i loose the better it will get and its getting easier now to loose the weight.    Go to the docs though as they can test you for PCOS, which can be helped with drugs if you have it. Good luck

I agree that rolling tobacco with a filter is helping you avoid a huge deal of tar and nicotine, and god only knows what other additives you are not putting into your lungs. i agree with the rolled cigarettes.|`|K6fasl6kaa	there is no way to answer this question relatively.  no cigarettes are the only ones not hazardous to your health.  no way to get around it, under it or over it.  you may get by for years without have smoking related health issues.  i always used the rationalization that they would find a cure for lung cancer before i got it, but by golly, i lost that wager.|`|AA11605300	The problem is not whether it's hand rolled or store bought, but what the tobacco is treated with. If you can but unadulterated tobacco to roll, I say that's much better than the crap they sell in the stores. That's why some of us choose to smoke good cigars that have no contaminated tobacco.|`|8b47095af2689db48ec5428995121d95aa	You answered your own question smoking cigarettes is unhealthy  why do the research|`|4yGGjs7zaa	what does it matter whether it is store bought or not! you should be asking how to give up! unhealthy is putting it lightly!  do you have kids?  i was 18 when my dad died of lung cancer! he had been smoking for 40 odd years and died and 57. it still haunts me 4 years later and how i felt for him even thjough he did it to himself! he died painfully and it isnt a nice way to go neither is it so early!   i wish i'd never had to see my dad like this! what about your family!

It doesn't matter if he breaks your hymen or not. Some girls break it trying to clean themselves, on see-saws, you name it.   The breaking of your hymen doesn't make you not a virgin, it's the act of having sex.    But no neither one of you are virgins anymore|`|MpzPfzivaa	Sweety, I consider anything where genitalia meets genitalia is a sexual encounter and virginity goes out the window at that point. However, if you are strictly asking about intercourse, penetration of the penis into the vagina, then I would still have to say yes. Usually you will bleed a little after if the hymen is broken, but if you use tampons it can sometimes be broken prematurely by the tampon. It's not common but can happen.|`|eCKNRcIVaa	I don't know if he broke your hymen but neither one of you are virgins now.|`|eC8GMMxUaa	if a penis touches your vajj your no longer a virgin.|`|4zoN1U3Waa	If all the above happened then it`s true you are Virgins No More.|`|Co9I2OMSaa	if the penis enters in the vagina, then yes you lost your virginity.  it doesn't matter if the hymen doesn't break, or if he doesn't ejaculate, either way it went in so you are no longer a virgin.  congrats!?|`|CZwFNUoOaa	id say not     even if he didn't break your hymen|`|mquRob1faa	yeah you defanately did.|`|fKgxSjGFaa	If it bled a little with a small sharp pain, your "cherry popped".  and neither of you are virgins any longer.      Congrats.|`|AA12389198	It's hard to tell if you broke your hymen or not...  Not all girls' hymens break the first time they have sex.    But yeah, a penis going inside of your vagina... Your not a virgin.    Congrats? ahah.|`|9TyrKyK6aa	sadly, no, you are not a virgin any longer.|`|NzWY5ECgaa	Virginity is an entirely social construct. There is no definitive virgin/not virgin dichotomy. Many girls break their hymens long before they ever have sex, and some women's hymens don't break even after lots of sex. Some women engage in lots of sexual activity without ever engaging in penis-in-vagina intercourse (lesbians, or women engaging in other types of sex acts), but that doesn't make them more or less virgins.    According the the social norms of this country, you're probably not what would be considered a virgin anymore, no. But it's pretty much up to you and your partner to decide how you define what happened. The pain is normal. You're probably sore because your body isn't used to having things in it in that way.    And in future, if you do decide to try again, I recommend the use of a lubricant (water based) with a condom to minimize pain and the chance of pregnancy. Also, masturbation will help you to get used to those sensations, and help you get a better feel for what makes you feel good, so you can better communicate that to your partner|`|kHVzjMg2aa	if you have to ask if you are still a virgin then you are not.  when you do anything sexually related you're no longer a virgin,|`|wfm1SNecaa	I'm not quite sure what to call that. I don't think I would count it. The real question is are you in a hurry to lose it? And why?

You are only 15, think twice before giving yourself to another so early in life. I won't get into the morals of it, but psychologically speaking, it can really mess you up. As far as your period, it is unusual to have not gotten it by now, but girls have been older than you and gotten it and been completely healthy. If you are concerned enough to post this, you should probably go see a gyno. Check out this website, you might find it helpful.    http://health.yahoo.com/women-gyn/normal...|`|4zoN1U3Waa	It depends on how healthy you are.Some girls with weak bodies have it even at 16/17.It`s pretty late yes but it happens.Yes a visit to a doc will ease your mind.|`|l9ab36z4aa	Sex doesn't affect it. Why are you having sex at 15? if it doesn't come soon go and see your GP|`|OY6R4ZP1aa	believe me you dont want your period it is a pain in the @$$. be lucky you dont have it.|`|tO7e262zaa	The only way having sex can affect you getting your period or not is if you are pregnant. Did you use protection and if so are you sure you didn't have a broken condom? Also could you have an STD? That could have an effect on your period. Or you could just be a late bloomer. I knew a girl back in high school that didn't get her period until she was 19.     But do go to the doctor, make sure nothing is wrong and see what your doctor suggests. If you're sexually active it may be best to get on birth control which can give you normal periods.|`|fKgxSjGFaa	I didnt start until i was 15.      If your really slim, or very athletic it takes a lot longer to come around.    But trust me, its nothing to look forward to.    I never spotted at all before my first, so dont worry about anything previous.    It will come with time.    Hope everything works out for you!|`|AA12389198	If your period doesn't come by the time your 16 you should probably set up a gynecologist appointment.    How long have you been having the discharge for? If you can think back to when your started to get that discharge your period should arrive between 6-12 months after you begin that. (Give or take.)    I don't think your having sex affected the arrival of your first period, but just remember that just because you don't have a period doesn't mean you shouldn't wear a condom. Make sure you use protection because you never know when your first period will be on it's way!|`|VY6gHc6Naa	don't wish that coming, they're a pain

My mother was just diagnosed with cancer and was told without treatment she would certainly  die within 3 weeks.  I believe in Christ her healer.  He has brought us along way. We have been told so many things would be difficult for her the chemo, spinal taps, etc. She has not been sick not once from the chemo and the spinal taps have not been painful at all.  She is walking everyday.  I have faith that all the people praying to God is what is getting her through this.   No doctor can tell you the length of your life. I do believe that we live through things such as cancer to help us grow and help others. My mother in her short time at this special hospital has already touched people and given them hope. We believe there is a reason for the cancer.  It is extremely hard to except the fact that she has it, but we are moving forward and fighting.   I also believe that God can use doctors and nurses to help heal us. Only the Creator can tell us the length of time we have here on Earth.  In Psalms 139:6 It says, You saw me before I was born, everyday of ______(I placed my mom's name here) life is recorded in your book.   Also, Eph 1:22 says that God has put ALL THINGS under the authority of Christ.  I pray for you Rylie that God will heal your cancer in the Name of Jesus Christ.  The blood of Jesus be placed through out your body shrinking and killing all of the cancer cells.  Cancer you have NO place in Rylie or my mother and I command you in the name of Jesus to be removed.

3YECm7FDaa	I use Advil migraine medicine. Its in a red box and looks a lot like normal advil. It cost a little more but it works.     My father used something else and it didn't work for me. Migraines can happen for many reasons and we all react a little differently to medicine. So if this doesn't work you just need to try different things until you find something that works.|`|EmgiGg17aa	First off: it does not help the situation if you don't eat.    Your head requires nutrients it gets from food and for some people they get a headache before their stomach growls.    Secondly, you will find that it is the water that you drink that does more for you headache than the Excedrin, or Aspirin, or Tylenol.(you will note on all these items it says to take with water)   Your head requires adequate intake of water(dehydration will bring on a headache before you get parched throat or tongue)   If you are drinking lots of coffee you need double the amount of water as your body requires 2 cups of water to flush out 1 cup of coffee.   Same applies to alcoholic drinks.    And just because you drink a glass right away means that all has entered you blood system, no - most is sitting in your stomach to be peed out.   This means cutting off the coffee for a week at least and going with water(not soda or milk) and green veges as they are mainly made of water.   Stay away from sugars as well.     Your chemical balance is off whack and you got to get it right.|`|8b35140fd5eabcceff1f6c71562a2a02aa	Drink plenty of water, not in gulps, but in sips.

Hope this helps you and that you are feeling better soon. x|`|yOwRD4ZEaa	Try to eat something, even if it's just a piece of toast. Low blood sugar from not eating can make migraines even worse. Just eat a bite or two at a time as you are able to. Even if it takes you an hour to eat that one little thing. Keep drinking water too. Dehydration will also make you feel worse.     Take some advil and take a shower. If possible, shower in the dark. Try to relax and just let the water pour over your head and/ or face, whichever feels better. Turn the water to ice cold for 5-10 seconds and then change it back for about an equal amount of time and then repeat for about as long as you can stand. For some reason, doing this cuts my migraine pain in half or even gets rid of it. After you get out of the shower, lay down and try to sleep it off.|`|3ntblazlaa	You should go to the doctor. This sounds very serious to be just taking over the counter medication.    But some temporary remedies are:  - drink lots of water, if you don't it causes your blood to thicken and increase blood pressure in your head causing the ache.  - you should  try the pressure points. by pressing on your temples on the sides of your forehead. another spot is pressing on the pressure point on your hand, between your thumb and pointer finger. you would press the web of those two fingers for a while focusing the pain there instead of your head.  - check www.webmd.com. sometimes very useful.    Hope you feel better!|`|CxGrPsdkaa	Yep that's a migraine alright.  I suggest you take a 800mg of ibuprofen,if your headache isn't gone within 1-3 hour most likely you'll need to take 1600mg.   I'm diagnose with migraines,so yeah.|`|n9IKW9iQaa	I have suffered from migraines since I was 5 years old.  A migraine is usually centered on one side of your head, and has a throbbing/pulsing sensation that goes with it.  Physical activity makes the pain worse.  Light & sound sensitivity accompanies the pain as well.  Nausea and vomiting are common.  They usually last as few as several hours, to as long as 72 hours.  Since this has has been going on for three days now, I'd go to the nearest ER and get examined.   Three days is in the unusual time frame for a migraine.There are other serious conditions that mimic migraine.  A bleed in the brain is one possibility and is a medical emergency.   Meningitis/ecephalitis are others posibilities, also medical emergencies.  Better safe than sorry.  Get it checked out, and hope you feel better soon.
nUu7tUiqaa	There are many ways to do this:    Get someone that you can talk to about it.  Write down your stresses in a journal, or something else private. You can even burn the paper later, as if you are burning stress away.  Ask your boss to give you more freedom in your daily work schedule.  Take your lunch break somewhere far away from where you work.  Sit down with a psychologist. It doesn't mean you're crazy, it's just nice to have someone to talk to.  Go out with friends right after work.  Get a hobby that you can devote yourself to.  Join a charity. Charity work will get your mind far off of your job stress.  Get an agenda and right down EVERYTHING you need to do for work. As you finish a task, cross it out.     Hope this helps.
AA11020187	You should be glad they are going to the lab everything removed from the body should go to the lab. Colon polyps are not good, but they are common.

I just can't sleep if I'm not in the same house with a member of my family. We had a two day trip to Paris last year, and I went to sit down in the ground floor of the hostel at night: I just couldn't sleep. I started to think about going home. I somehow did sleep after all that night, but not too much.  Try to sleep in a house with a friend who knows about your problem, who you trust, and who can help you if you have a panic attack. If you bring yourself to do this only for one night it mind change the way you look at things.   I should try that as well, but my problem is slightly different from yours as I told you.    Take care!
a5f8fb915b0c89693e97dc814aba467faa	Yes, you develop a tolerance to benzos over time. You have to keep taking more and more and more to get the same effect. And you can't do that, because taking more and more means more and more side effects, including side effects that you can't feel like liver damage.    Benzos are also addictive, so they are hard to stop. And when you do stop, you get withdrawal, or bounce back symptoms. It's best to never start taking them at all.|`|Shp5riE6aa	You can lose your tolerance, there are plenty of side effects.|`|ToztjpAsaa	Valium and librium were prescribed widely in the 1960 and 1970s (they became known Mother's little helpers) but many people developed dependencies.|`|13696281d4bfaa532acde67008e9d4d7aa	Tolerance is clearly known to develop in benzodiazepines.

This means that if your dose is at 10mg (whatever), your next dose will be 8 mg, then a few weeks later, 6mg, then 4mg, then 2, then finally zero. This is used to slowly decrease tolerance.
B4YESGmwaa	In the last 6 yrs they have come up with several newer antidepressants, and several different combinations that you may not have tried yet. You are correct, our bodies do build up a resistance to our medications. About every 3 yrs they step me off mine and onto something else (only for a brief time) and then start me back on the combination that work. The best plan is to speak openly to your doctor about your concerns God Bless Reggie|`|HgRYP3cJaa	you may need a stonger RX.

It may feel uncomfortable for the first day or two, but that feeling will go away. After the retainer, they may just put a permanent retainer behind your upper teeth. (They put a permanent retainer on your bottom teeth.) But if not, they will probably just have you wear a removable retainer at night.|`|fA76RxPpaa	Yes, you will have to have a retainer. I used to have a retainer, but it hurt BAD. Don't be afraid though, because my retainer was strictly for my teeth before braces. The retainer you get after braces does not hurt that much.|`|RaDJT5HLaa	No, just the retainer. Normally you have to wear it day and night (besides when eating) for the first six months after you get your braces off. After that it is just at night. A lot of dentists now use permanent retainers on the top so you can't ever take it out. Talk to your orthodontist and ask about your options. Good Luck :]|`|vn1kT1t5aa	well, you need to get a sculpt of your mouth to get the retainer, and its only slightly discomforting at first. no pain involved with a retainer. it depends on what the problem is with your teeth as to whether or not you should get anything else afterwards. even the orthodontists dont really know until they get there.
bCmqScVlaa	First of all, calm down.  It doesn't have to be the end of the world.  They are talking liver transplant which is really good for her.  Forget about these people that tell you that cirrhosis is extremely painful.  I had it and experienced very little pain, really no pain other than getting stuck with needles a lot for tests.  It can be painful when lots of fluid develops in the abdomen, but a paracentesis (being drained of the fluid) will help her and there are meds that can help keep that fluid under control.  I only had to be drained one time when I was first diagnosed, and after that my meds worked until I got my transplant.  There is also a procedure called TIPS that can be done to help keep that fluid to a minimum until transplant.    Bleeding internally is a risk with cirrhosis, but again, there is something she can do to greatly lower that risk.  She will need to get routine endoscopies done so they can band unwanted blood vessels that form with cirrhosis.  It's a simple procedure that I had done quite a number of times.  Banding gets rid of those unwanted vessels which lowers the risk of bleeding.  I never had any bleeding, but had 9 bandings done.      There are other meds that will help her along the way.  Cirrhosis is usually a very slow progressive disease.  It depends somewhat on what has caused her disease as to how fast it progresses.  Since she is in stage 4, she will need a transplant.  She is still young and hopefully will be a good candidate to get one.  She will need to go for an evaluation which is just a lot of tests and talking with some people such as a psychiatrist and social worker.  Once that is all done, her case will go before a board of people (mostly doctors) and they will determine whether or not she can be listed to receive a liver transplant.      If she gets listed, then the waiting game begins.  She will be given a MELD score which is determined by 3 lab tests (INR, biliruben, and creatnine).  The higher the MELD score, the higher you are on the list for a transplant.  MELD scores go from 6-40 with 40 being the sickest.  I received my transplant when my MELD was 15.  Two things need to match from a donor.  One is blood type.  The other is body size.  A very large man could not donate to a small petite woman because his liver would be too large.      Don't be afraid and tell your mother not to be afraid.  It won't be easy for your mother and your family to go through all this, but many people have done it and there are many success stories out there from people just like myself who had a transplant and are doing great today.  Once established with a transplant team, your mom must do everything they tell her to do in order to get well again.  Compliance with everything is most important.      Good luck sweetie.  If you and your mom have any questions, just email me and I will help you if I can.|`|UjhWIrJ1aa	She will have pain, and she will not just suddenly go one night. She'll get worse and time goes on. She will have fluid build up in her body, and this will need to be drained at the hospital. If it builds up enough she will begin to cough/vomit this fluid up. She will more than likely get fairly skinny and frail, but will have a large bulge in her stomach, from her liver. I wish I could say something to not scare you, but after seeing what it does, I can't. Just make sure you do everything you can together now before the time is gone... Best of luck to you.|`|eCKNRcIVaa	I don't want to scare you but liver disease is often extremely painful.  She will not simply slump over dead.  Her belly will likely become more and more distended, fluid will accumulate around her liver and stomach ( she may at times need to have this "tapped" or drained in the hospital)  If too much fluid accumulates it can begin to put pressure on the diaphragm making it extremely difficult to breathe.   she might start vomiting blood when/if she begins bleeding internally.  She will likely turn yellow ( her skin and eyes ).  She may get lesions on her skin, and her eyesight may or may not be affected ( even to the point of blindness )|`|AA10531094	Sorry to hear of your mom's diagnosis.

Cirrhosis of the Liver    http://www.medicinenet.com/cirrhosis/art...|`|W4whHKmxaa	Here are things that may occur and things the  doctor can possibly do for her.    Encephalopathy: Ammonia passes the blood  brain barrier and goes into the brain cause the  liver cannot convert it now to a non toxic form  to be removed from the body in the urine.  This will cause confusion, disorientation.  Extreme tiredness will occur, but also sleep  pattern changes.  One of the drugs used  to help this is Lactulose.  There are others.  It is very important that this be treated...as  this can lead to a coma.    Ascites: This is fluid build up in the abdomen  cause of the lack of protein being made by  the liver, known as Albumin.  The doctor  can remove this excess fluid in a procedure  known as Paracentesis.  Patients that have  this do not feel much like eatting because  of the pressure on the stomach.  Most  liver patients become malnourished...smaller  meals given more often can help her than   larger ones.  If she isn't able to eat...then  ask the doctor for supplemental drinks she  may be able to have.  Paracentesis gives  the patient instant relief of the pressure and  also being able to breathe easier.    Portal hypertension:  The blood doesn't  flow through the liver well anymore and also  doesn't get to the cells of the liver.  It backs  up into the Portal vein and builds up pressure. This blood then is forced into smaller vessels not  used to handling this blood.  These vessels  are located in the esophagus, belly button,  and also the rectum.  They can have weak  spots and can balloon outward and break  open.  They call these vessels Varies or  Varicose veins.  They can sometime watch  them to try to prevent this from happening...  but sometimes it isn't possible.    If you see any blood, whether red, red purple  or coffee ground like in her vomit..it is an  emergency.  The doctor will go through  the mouth and into the esophagus and band  them to stop this bleeding so she doesn't  bleed internally or bleed out.      She may develop spider like veins on  the neck, shoulder, and chest areas.  This  is usually not a problem unless she scratches  them.  The liver is no longer able to make  factors to help her blood clot.  Therefore,  she can bruise very easily and bleed out   easily.  The bruise can appear like blood under the surface of the skin.  It is best to try to prevent  this by removing rugs that don't have backing  on them and sharp pointed furniture.  To   place nightlights in rooms.     She may develop fluid in the legs, feet, and  other areas of the body.  This is because  this disease causes people to retain sodium.  The doctor usually places these patients  on diuretics and also a low sodium diet.  This has to be watched carefully in your blood  work, as Sodium and also potassium has  to stay in a certain level in the blood for the  heart to beat in rhythm.  It is important to  ask the doctor how much sodium she is  allow to have a day and also how much Fluids.  Depending on which diuretic medication she  is given, it would also be good to check and  see if she may need more potassium.    Usually, elevating the legs will help this.  However, do not massage the legs as  this could move a blood clot, that may develop,  from the leg and go to the heart.     The Spleen may also be enlarged.  It is  important to try to protect her from injury.    Here is a link from one of the transplant   centers that will give you an idea of the  process they go through for transplantation.

For a healthy diet, you need to be eating small to medium meals regularly. 4 or even 5 times a day. Each meal (apart from breakfast which should preferably be fibre rich), should contain a balanced ammount of carbohydrates for energy, (from potatoes, rice and pasta, etc) protien (from fish, chicken, occassional red meat is fine, soya is good too) and plenty of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants (simple fresh fruit and veg). Eat like this and make sure you are well hydrated (fruit juice is as good as water, any fluid counts, but some fluids have negative effects too, such as alcohol or caffiene rich drinks.)    You can have a wide range of healthy meals with this, from Thai, Chinese, Italian, British, Indian, etc. Just make sure each meal contains balanced ammounts of these three. On the bright side too, fresh veg and rice and pasta is a lot cheaper than crappy junk food!    This doesn't mean you cant have chocolate or pizza/takeaway/etc, just save them as very occassional treats.    The big secret to keeping a healthy weight and staying healthy is EXCERCISE, particularly cardio excercise.     Cardio exercise includes any form of excercise such as running/jogging/swimming/cycling etc that gets your heart rate pumping and you sweating and out of breath. It will not only burn calories and reduce your body fat levels, therefore making you 'slimmer' by having less fat on you, but will also improve your resting heart rate and lung function, making you healthier.     I cannot understate the importance of cardio excercise. It is this which will basically burn the body fat off you.     But you have to remember that once you have shed a bit of fat you have to have a nice toned body underneath the fat to show off.     Strength training will help you strengthen and tone your muscles. This is done with the use of weights or by free training.    There are essentially (without getting overly complicated) two types of strength excercises based on different types of muscle fibres depending on wether you want to build size, bulk and power, or just 'tone' up the lean muscles an get more muscle endurance.    Heavy weights with short reps/sets will build your fast twitch muscle fibres and build size, power and strength. Imagine big guys at the gym lifting heavy weights.     But if you use light to medium weights with lots of reps/sets you will excercise your slow twitch muscle fibres, you wont build size, but you will tone up your body and train muscle endurance. This will obviously make you 'look' healthier and more toned, but will also increase your metabolism (as your muscles demand more energy) so you will burn calories faster. These muscles are also excercised a lot with cardio workouts (i.e your leg muscles when running).    Your arms for example, will need bicep curls and tricep dips using weights and reps of your choice (heavy - low reps, light - lots of reps) and also shoulder excercises such as holding the weights at your waist and lifting them perpendicular to your side or in front of you, etc etc.    Your stomach will need excercises that cover the entire torso. Leg raises for your lower ab wall, crunches, sit ups and planks for your upper and all over ab wall, oblique twists for your sides and superman stretches for your lower back for example.    These are just basic examples, there are literally hundreds of excercises, but it is impossible to show you on a site like this, get a trainer at your gym to show you some but remember the basic rules of muscles and weights.     As far as excercise goes, you should aim to strike a balance between cardio training and strength training, this way you will build good strong and toned muscle, but also keep your body fat levels down and increase your heart and lung performance, making you much fitter and healthier.    Hope this helps.|`|n102y2SMaa	run|`|dduWesM5aa	that depends.... wtf are you talking about.|`|RsOaLDHPaa	if you have some mates that can ride a bike get together and have a bike ride round your town i did that today it was well fun|`|lQmGDPIoaa	2 stones =28 pounds[american]    What do you ride?.

AA11020187	Not a single thing in your statement makes sense.   How does he know the lining of your cervix is too thin?  Even if it is that would not cause flaking or irritation.   How in the world was he able to see your ovaries?  And the million dollar question  why are you trying to get pregnant?
XlqXfVePaa	If you're on the pill then you'll be fine but if you're not and you didn't use a condom you might be pregnant. Even if you did use a condom, there's a 3-7% chance you could be pregnant. Withdrawing is not a safe method of contraception as at any time pre *** or sperm may leak out. Take a pregnancy test or go to the doctors if you haven't had it by monday.     In future, please use a condom or even better, get yourself on the pill.|`|S1jddreQaa	The withdraw method is like the worst and least effective method. You could be pregnant.|`|4m5cgyzxaa	u might be prego its not a reliable method of birth control|`|Xg3ed1L5aa	First of all, the withdrawal method is very ineffective, with 4-27 out of every 100 people becoming pregnant with this method. You should really consider another method of birth control if you don't want to get pregnant. Planned Parenthood's website says,     "Couples who have great self-control, experience, and trust may use the pull out method more effectively. Men who use the pull out method must be able to know when they are reaching the point in sexual excitement when ejaculation can no longer be stopped or postponed. If you cannot predict this moment accurately, withdrawal will not be as effective.    Even if a man pulls out in time, pregnancy can still happen. Some experts believe that pre-ejaculate, or pre-***, can pick up enough sperm left in the urethra from a previous ejaculation to cause pregnancy. If a man urinates between ejaculations before having sex again, it will help clear the urethra of sperm and may increase the effectiveness of withdrawal.        Pregnancy is also possible if semen or pre-ejaculate is spilled on the vulva."    So, if you are relying on this method of birth control, you should be very concerned if your period is late, because the chances of being pregnant are pretty high. You should take a home pregnancy test. Some brands, such as First Response, can supposedly detect the pregnancy hormone as early as 5 days before your missed period. However, you can still get a false negative even a few days after your missed period. So if you still don't have your period, and the test comes out negative, you should wait a day or two and take another test. The best time is in the morning when you wake up, when there is the highest concentration of the pregnancy hormone in your urine. Good luck!
n7KCez59aa	Hi !    That is plenty of time !    " what can i do to loose belly and back fat??

RXI8ImdIaa	It could be a bruise, but generally speaking we don't like to see blue skin.    Do this - put that one finger on your cheek. Keep it there, and put the matching finger from your other hand, on your other cheek. They should feel like the same temperature. If the injured one feels slightly warmer, that's ok... but it should not be colder than the good finger.    You should also have feeling in the tip of the injured finger. If it's numb and/or colder than normal, you have an emergency problem.

These physical changes increase your strength and stamina, speed your reaction time, and enhance your focus  preparing you to either fight or flee from the danger at hand.     Many health problems are caused or exacerbated by stress, including:    Pain of any kind   Heart disease   Digestive problems   Sleep problems    Depression   Obesity   Autoimmune diseases   Skin conditions, such as eczema    try:http://stason.org/articles/wellbeing/hea... for info. on tips to release stress.|`|6NZeItMAaa	Stress is usually at the root of all of the above psychological disorders. It also affects us physically as well. Stress has been linked to every disease known to man, including heart disease and cancer. Clearly, it is not a good idea for people to be under stress. But, as human beings, we are going to experience stressful situations. There is no avoiding this fact. Therefore, in order to really be able to help cure ourselves from being stressed out we need to know how to do the following:    ? Identify stressors that affect our daily lives;  ? Eliminate the stressors of which we can free ourselves;  ? Learn to deal with stressful situations in a healthy way     If you are one of the millions of people who are feeling stressed out, you must take a look at the reasons why you are stressed out and try to do what you can to eliminate as much stress as you can from your life.

Theres always loads of domestic vacancies in there so Im sure you'd attract some interest.    You could try volunteering in a Camphill Community.  If you havent heard of them, these are basically self contained communities in rural areas for people with disabilities to live.  They take on volunteers to help in the community.  You'd probably have to commit for a minimum of 6 months or something but it could be really good for you.  A relaxing environment away from everything else and also you'd be doing something worthwhile so will make you feel good about yourself.  You can see which communities in the UK are recruiting on their website.  Good luck! http://www.camphill.org.uk/
RXI8ImdIaa	You're constipated. Eat more fiber.|`|H0aiDO9Paa	We like to encourage a healthy diet for the bowel, followed by a healthy lack of interest in the details of the stool-elimination process. The diet should contain fresh fruits and vegetables for their natural laxative action and adequate fiber residue.  Fiber is present in Bran's, celery and whole-grain breads and is absent from foods that have been overly processed. Fiber draws water into the stool and adds bulk; thus, it decreases the transit time from mouth to bowel movement and softens the stool.  If you need to use laxatives, we prefer a bulk laxative such as Metamucil. And good luck.|`|ZkuYBUByaa	This sounds like constipation.  Do not strain when you use the restroom, this will only result in hemroids.  Usually if you uptake more fiber this problem will go away.  For the next week, eat high fiber cereals and lots of fruits and veggies.  Also if the problem still persists buy some metamucial which can be purchased in a powder form or pill.  Hope this helps!|`|eji2mBAlaa	eat more fiber really.  I started to have this, i then improved my diet slightly and it went better  x|`|5pszijaDaa	besides eating more fiber for your constipation (as already stated). make sure you are drinking plenty of water every day. you also might consider trying a stool softening laxative (try Docusate sodium also called Doculax)

I have pink eye right now because I have the flu.   Your eye probably just got irritated. The symptoms for pink eye is more than just redness. (swelling, discharge, pain and redness)
QsCPOHAraa	Whoa, DO NOT pop it with a needle! A needle is not something you want close to your eye!    Do warm compresses. Get a washcloth and soak it in hot water for a minute, wring it out, then place the cloth over your eyes and lie down. You can also rub very gently with the washcloth around your eyes.    I have had a lot of issues with my eyes and I get styes all the time, so take it from me!    It'll go away by itself in a day or two even if you just leave it. It's nothing to really worry too much about. Just try not to touch it with your fingers too much or do anything that will further irritate the eye.|`|5UPL5Rdoaa	pop it with a clean needle like a sewing needle

g8JGLnk6aa	Is your ear clogged with wax? (You weren't clear about that in your question). If so, then Hydrogen Peroxide is good because it fizzes on contact with wax.  The Deborox ear wax removal kit is also good. You can find both at any mainstream drug store or pharmacy.     If your Eustachian tubes are closed (but no wax), then you might need to get a sinus clearing medicine or something. See what they have at the store.     Maybe have a doctor look inside your ears to see if it's wax causing the clogging.|`|sjQKEeOuaa	ear drops|`|04d652da16f9a83b9df71076065f4b5faa	You can add a few drops of sweet oil or olive oil into the ear canal and let it sit over night. Then repeat for a few days if needed. We use a water pick to "power wash" the wax from the ear after the oik has softened the clog. Use warm water, test on your inner wrist to be sure it's not too hot. Hold your head over the sink and get to it. If you don't have a water pick, you can get a 60cc syringe from the medical supply store, or try asking the doctor for one. You do the same power wash with the syringe. Sometimes, the oil will cause the wax to swell and this is okay, but you may experience more pressure. DO NOT dig into the ear, may rupture the ear drum.
7ilEjRxeaa	Make sure your muscles are completely relaxed.  If you're nervous, it will tighten your muscles and make it difficult to go in.    My first time, I used Platex sport, plastic applicator.  It went in pretty well for me  Sometimes thought I can tell it's not in all the way  and that gets frustrating  Don't get worked up about it though, that will make it worse.    Try making sure the very tip of the applicator is in your vagina, not just pressed against it.  For me, if I put the applicator in a little, it goes in a LOT better.    Good luck  tampons are annoying sometimes, but once you get the hang of it, they're WAAAAAAAAY better than pads.|`|a7f44582f7bbfb8996d883accbaf5a63aa	oh no! this sucks! i can't help because i have never worn one either, but i wanted to express my sympathy.|`|hE3CnA54aa	The first time is always hard. I would say to get some KY Jelly and the grocery store. Put a lot of it on the tampon and insert it an angle pointing towards your back. After you've done it once it will never be this hard again.|`|jjgcurOWaa	The thing you have to remember is that you are inserting the tampon between some pretty powerful muscles. Whilst it is certainly easier to insert a tampon in the positions described, you will still struggle unless you are relaxed. Just take a moment to calm down before you attempt to use a tampon, don't stress if it doesn't work any agitation will only make it harder to do. Try having a bath beforehand, then using the tub position you describe. It can be daunting to use a tampon at first, but don't believe the hype; it shouldn't hurt, they are very safe and you do NOT lose your virginity by using them.|`|UjaGyXuRaa	Try putting a mirror between your leg and lifting one so you can see where it's going.|`|hCI6HFEnaa	Are you sure they're a good size to start off with?  It's best if they're quite small.    From experience, I would say it does hurt, so don't believe it'll go in that easily.  Make sure you're pushing the tampon in slightly towards your back and kind of upwards.    And make sure your relaxed, it'll ease your muscles and it can go in better.    For tampon brands, Tampax is the best. My first time, I used Tampax. Plastic applicators will be better than cardboard, but take the plastic off if it's not helping. It can be MUCH easier without it.    And Marie, what does that matter? Gosh!|`|S1jddreQaa	what kind are you using? if your using cardboard then you should switch to plastic. the slide in so much easier. I suggest tampax pearl or playtex sport.    edit: then you should probably get a size smaller. Or get playtex gental glides, i know then make very small sizes for light days.

7jdvcrTKaa	First of all, not downing your friend, that's just gross.  What she needs to do is find a way to control herself.  If she doesn't handle this addiction now she will eventually go down the wrong path and that wrong path is becoming a sex addict.  True she might have recently discovered this new pleasure, but she needs to understand that no one is going to want to shake her hand knowing what she has been doing.  You should tell her that you understand that likes making herself feel good, but that she needs to keep that BEHIND closed doors and under control or it could ruin her future.  Also, make sure you tell her that when she does it in front of you that it makes you uncomfortable.|`|YmELDRSEaa	rub some chilly powder in your friends fingure.then she will automatically stop finguring in her vagina once this happens.|`|pgBHEesTaa	Oh my god!

UOZP4Ma5aa	No, but tomake sure just ask the dr to look at it
Amkmles0aa	walk 10 m a day  YOU ARE NOT FAT|`|tv0wEcDWaa	Just eat healthy things you like, dont force yourself to eat something healthy if you dont like it though, you'll probably stop dieting if you do that. But yeah, exercise often (everyday) and eat well and you should have no problem.|`|KJCHUVe5aa	Replace your snacks with fruits and veggies they will equal prbly your whole days worth or snacks normally!
2diobki7aa	I'm a lot like this too.  I say about 30 minutes to an hour a day.  But you should do some sit ups, maybe push ups, and jogging.  And then just eat a bit healthier.  (:|`|qnDk8xjPaa	30-45 minutes a day and you will surely see a large difference at least in the muscle tone in your legs/calves/thighs and butt.  I would recommend not running on a treadmill too much though because it is a different experience than running outside or on a track.|`|wSu1cE49aa	for thirty minutes do a walk-jog-sprint. 5min speed walk, 4 min jog, 1 min sprint, then repeat. i did this for baseball, its great as long as you go all out in the sprint. the walking burns fat at first better than jogging if your cardiovascular system is out of shape, and it gives you a chance to catch your breath. if this gets too easy change the minute proportions.
AA10097817	Try cold then hot. Then repeat several times. Also, take some ibuprofen. You may have some brusing on the inside, but it should heal okay. If not, see a doctor.|`|381eb5244a845cff58e5a278ff8092fdaa	its called a deep contusion, (a deep bruise) when you fell, you did not really hurt the outside of your body but rather the inside. i did that last week, a week ago today! i fell on the ice and hit my knee really hard, it might not bruise but then again it might.    its tight to bend cause it is swollen inside, not ouside, your muscles and joint are hurting from it. wrap it in an ace bandage.    it took mine 5 days to show any physical sign of damage, i now have a nice bruise on the outside of my knee thats turning green n yellow but still has some purple. dont worry itll get better give it about a week.|`|9QcRMapRaa	you could have sprained your knee. i hurt my knee three weeks ago and saw my doctor cept my knee was giving out at random time. he just gave me a brace and told me to ice it and exercise the knee
9UuRG7YAaa	The best way to lose weight is to change your lifestyle. I'll give you a few tips as well as an exercise routine.    To start with, eat loads and loads of fresh fruit and vegetables. They should all be raw, nothing cooked. If your parents/parent doesn't know you want to lose some weight, I suggest you employ 'healthy eating' tactics. Any parent should be delighted that you want to eat more fruit and veg!    Next, theres a few things you can do all day on and off. When you sit down, pretend you are being pulled by a string from the top of your head and sit up straight. Keep as still as possible and breathe slowly and deeply for 60 seconds. Increase the time as you feel comfortable. This strengthens the muscles in your core and makes any exercise you do more effective.    Also, any time you're just sitting around, clench your stomach muscles and hold for as long as possible. Do it as many times a day as you can cope with. You'll have lovely abs in no time at all. Clench your butt muscles as well to have a toned butt and thighs.    On to the exercise, I'll number them!      1- Sit on the sofa. Pretend you are getting up to change the channel on the TV. Change your mind half way through getting up, hold your position, and then sit. Repeat as many times as you are able.    2- Find a step/ledge you can comfortably step on and off from. Simply, step on and off for as long as you can and as fast as you can. Keep your speed safe though.    3- A range of muscle workouts now. Muscles burn fat like nothing else! Do press ups, sit ups, and lunges. With the lunges, put one leg forward at a time and bend the knee of the forward leg to 90 degrees and hold. You should feel it along the backs of your thighs and butt.    4- The best exercise to burn fat is to move as fast as possible for as long as possible! Switch your iPod on and dance like a loon, do star jumps over and over again, jog on the spot, dig out a skipping rope. Anything that makes you out of breath quickly will be burning fat quickly.      Another tip, carrying a little extra weight will help. If you walk to school, carry something heavy-ish in each hand. If you're doing some stepping exercises, lift your knee high, swing your arms and hold a bottle of water in each hand.          Good luck in reaching your goal. Lolly, x.|`|f0c9b33b60bdc539994e570195e86071aa	Well it's not how much you exercise it's how much and what you eat. I suggest eating foods that will fill you up (i mean like not being hungry) for example eat pasta with tomato sauce, fruits,veggies,and orange juice (well drink orange juice) i know that's hard to eat healthy but trust me your be glad. But that doesn't mean eat the whole bowl of pasta it means you should eat the size of your fist but that rule doesn't go for fruits and veggies! eat as many veggies and fruits as you want! Also you should work out at the gym for at least one and a half hours a day! But you need to WANT to lose weight your mom can't just be forcing you to lose weight it has to come for you. I hope this helps.|`|4fKk6t6maa	i know its winter and you want to stay in your house, but running is a great way to get in shape (20-30 min/day). start with walking, and then work your way up to running (ex, week 1: walk 4 minutes, run 1; week 2: walk 3 minutes, run 2, etc). of course, this would also work if you happen to have a treadmill.   other than that, try a variety of floor exercises: crunches, push ups, squats, leg lifts, etc.|`|J16sR7gtaa	movment.|`|OqqPBp5vaa	Just jump up and down like a phycotic spazzy monkey to some music. :)|`|b8dK8BQCaa	I think there is diffrent routines, depending on alot of stuff..  But a good one would be too jog/walk 30 minutes in the morning, then after supper time do about 100 crunches or 20 situps[:    You can also get a gym member-ship for VERY cheap, and a personal-trainer is the best because they work you hard, if your working by yourself.. you wont push your self AS HARD!    Hope this helps[;  XoXo -Mizzy

VqPIjwoZaa	Dude-et I'm your friend. We don't even know each other but I feel the same way as you. I just hope that you can make it. There are so many things that you can do someday. Wouldn't you like to share them with someone else? I know I would. I WANT TO SHARE THEM WITH SOMEONE ELSE. say that to yourself. We all have problems with ourselves and some people are just more in tune with their emotions than others. You just care a lot. You might not think you do because you feel your letting other people down but people let people down at times do they not? your probably a perfectionist like me and want to make everyone happy. Your just going through a period in your life, maybe its self reflection, maybe its the burden of the worlds problems and how they affect your life. Maybe its just you see no hope for the future, but how will the future change if you don't change it? I believe in anyone that tries, you just gotta try again, and again, and be happy with what you've accomplished so far.     I hope this helps and I also hope that it helps that I'm not religious, so I'm not trying to be biased on any side. Just believe, have faith, in people, in yourself, maybe you need change. write down your thoughts. I care about you because I can relate to you, even if I dont know you.

2rwCS0F8aa	not all girls hemyn breaks the first time. Sometimes girls that are very athletic; that do gymnastics, bikeriding, or dancing often have theirs broken. Before a woman has sex her opening is very tight because it is still not used to have any form of penetration, so it takes time so it's better to go slow the first time, after that, she'll enjoy it more then the first couple of seconds.|`|a6S1dyEraa	a girls hymen breaks the first time she has sex|`|6Z91jdchaa	But the hymen can also break from running and horse riding etc x|`|CG1Yd8yOaa	it can hurt anytime if the guy is not careful. pay attention to the girl. she will let you know.|`|e30clNGGaa	Yes, a little bit, your hymen is stretchedd, I would recomend using allot of lubricatin and being calm! also have fun!|`|noj91aaEaa	Yh it does the first me because the hymen is stretched.|`|ZY5ZEmT7aa	It could hurt if the girl has an infection or if there isn't enough lubrication.|`|J2Do5aY3aa	Umm yes a little bit.. And because when it's your first time you get really nervouse and that makes you tighten up so it can be painful..|`|nA4k2MMTaa	hmm boi, u dont no wut ur talkin bout. i be doin that since i wuz 10.  luv u babie  LaQuita|`|50rPQzn6aa	finger the girl first to relax her|`|4m5cgyzxaa	no it can but not always my girlfriend didnt exactly scream with pain|`|GyQEGpqTaa	I have read all the answers on here so far and actually it isn't the hymen that makes it hurt. It is the walls of your vagina that hurt as the walls aren't used to being stretched, as you get older the hymen breaks away anyway. If girls masturbate, and use things such as dildo's it may not even hurt at all when you have sex for the first time|`|1ZWNmQ8Iaa	uh yeah!!!
dtzlrB9Faa	Herpes can lay dormant for years or a lifetime.  Not everyone gets outbreaks.  If you're still unsure get a blood test to see if you have it.     And quit worrying! so much!!|`|RXI8ImdIaa	Jesus Christ, chill out.    If you had herpes, you would certainly know by now with all that stress. You'd normally have a big nasty outbreak soon after you contracted it, which kinda tips you off.    If you're really worried, go order a blood test and you'll know for sure. However if your last ex is clean, chances are you are clean too, especially with never having an outbreak.|`|499b2674aceaca4224f1e97ffb73d7f7aa	Right.  I think you are worrying too much. Herpes is a virus. It lies dormant in your body until something triggers it off. Stress is something that would trigger it off big time. So if you've been stressed and there's no sign then luckily you haven't got it.    It really  is a good idea to wear a condom until you are in a regular relationship with someone you trust.

acXMEsIuaa	those arent panic attacks what you're experiencing. the doctors basically got it right. when you have a panic attack, its more of a physical feeling rather than a mental feeling. your body gets overworked, which causes you to hyperventilate, have the feeling of a closed throat, blood pressure rises, sometimes you have phases of "vertigo" kind of where you feel a spinning sensation or an "out of this world" sensation. another thing is you can feel sharp pains in your body on a regular basis. it very much feels like youre dying.<br>  <br>  i think what you might have is some form of hypochondria (this is also a very big part of anxiety). maybe even a sort of obsessive compulsive disorder. these things are usually caused by heavy amounts of stress one will put on themselves.<br>  <br>  my best advice is not to take drugs at all. its much better to deal with the problem naturally than to depend on drugs to make it go away. exercise is the number 1 thing i would recommend. it releases endorphins into your body which makes you happy. it also relieves stress and tension in your body. another thing is when youre having one of those episodes, close your eyes and take really deep slow breaths and tell yourself that this "attack" isnt going to take the best of you. tell the feeling to go away. i know it sounds silly, but this is what my counsellor used to tell me to do and it worked when i was starting to get panic attacks.<br>  <br>  other things like getting everything out of the way that stresses you out is a good idea. i.e., homework, cleaning, housework, paperwork, etc. this is stuff thats going to make you really anxious, but once you get it out of the way a lot of weight is lifted from your shoulders. <br>  <br>  facing your problems and putting them in the past is what you need to do. the past is the past. you cant change it, as much as you would like. and not blaming yourself for what happened is key. who cares what you did when you were this old or at this time. its over. its done. get over it and move on.<br>  <br>  but i would definitely go against going on drugs to deal with your problem. drugs arent the way to go when you want to overcome a problem. they just cover it up.|`|tiapdoqBaa	One of the anti-anxiety drugs I am on is Buspar. I don't know if you have tried this but it is not like the benzodiazepines ( Xanax, Klonopin, Ativan) because it has no known potential for abuse. It has been fairly successful in treating my anxiety. I would ask your doctor about it.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|6utS5C9kaa	I also quit drinking and doing drugs so i can relate.  I have terrrible anxiety and thats the reason i drank, was to reduce that anxious feeling.  Now I have to find an alternate and healthy way, and i believe NO pill is the right way.  Prozac and wellbutrin are non narcotic and take time to work, up to 30 days.  Let your doctor know that you have an addiction problem so he knows not to give you medication that can be addictive over time.  Also, try counseling, that helps for me, as they teach you natural and healthy ways to deal with your anxiety and stress where you dont have to depend on a pill to get through the day.  Good luck.|`|qyoXSdPCaa	I don't know of any but thought you might chuckle at this.<br>  <br>  A new drug for Yuppies: It doesn't give a false sense of security or relaxation -- it makes you enjoy being tense.|`|o1SmYvfOaa	I use a natural non-narcotic medicine for anxiety called panicyl.  It works very well for me. i was taking antidepressants prior to that but couldn't stand feeling so out of it all the time. Hope this helps you.
5UPL5Rdoaa	it could be alot of diffrent things one big things is your genes are your parents over weight if so it could be alo harder to lose the weight another thing is what kind of foods do you eat? when your trying to lose weight you have to burn twice as many calories like if you eat a burger with 200 calories in it you have to burn 400 calories to lose a pound|`|n7KCez59aa	HI !    Motivation is key in keeping our body's in shape.    You need to find something to drive you to loose the extra weight you don't want. Combining cardio with strength training will help you burn fat effectively.
VmJmyAkmaa	Call your doctor. Your strain of strep is not responding to your antibiotics. You said you are on 10 days or therapy? I'm assuming you are on penicillin or amoxacillin because it is dosed like that. These days, many strains of strep have become resistant to these medications.   You require a medication change. You doctor will probably put you on a "Z-pak" also called azithromycin or zithromax, It is a 5 day treatment. They may put you on something different.    Also, don't use alcohol while on antibiotics because they can be rendered ineffective. (And avoid it for several days- week after treatment because the drug blood plasma levels are still fighting the infection even if you are done taking the pills)     Strep is a pretty nasty bug and can cause alot more problems in your body besides a sore throat if left untreated or not accurately managed. Call ASAP.    Good luck!|`|RXI8ImdIaa	Call the doctor back asap, the infection is not gone.    Don't delay on this, or you'll make it WAY worse :)|`|IzHfbWtiaa	Streptococcus or strep throat is a bacteria that can be treated with antibiotics and antibiotics laced with penicillin,just be sure that you are not allergic to the penicillin! Make sure your meds are taken as directed and take all of them! If it has not cleared up in 8 to 10 days,you should consult with your Dr. for answers! Best wishes and God Bless! NO! Alcohol with Meds!|`|AA10621397	you prolly didnt get rid of it the first time, call your doc hes got the answer|`|HzkRpjhEaa	It is possible, especially if you stopped the antibiotic earlier than the doctor said.  Even if it felt like the strep throat was all gone, you still have to keep using the antibiotics until they're used up to make sure it's really gone.
pQQ9ofxNaa	Um just for your info 5"12 is 6 foot smart one. and idk probably like 6"4-5ish, tall though.|`|76d0abbc40ad30a74af455c65255de81aa	http://www.growtall.com/height-calculato...|`|9If6UnCZaa	5'12? thats 6 feet dumb*ss!    haha well then you'll be tall and gain some weight if your THAT tall you prolly look anerexic|`|SuMwWNfyaa	you cant tell.    you just gotta wait.

If you are monogamous,then hopefully your wife was too...then it's something not serious at all!|`|Rf2r23sYaa	It puts me in the mind of herpes too. You or your wife could have had it before you even met and not known it. It lays dormant. If it's an ingrown hair or a pimple it will get better. If it's herpes it will get worse for about 2 weeks. Good luck. Hope it's a pimple.|`|SLSX6QQsaa	Could just be chafing from sweat or something.  Go to the doctor!|`|QePbhS8Caa	It's funny that everyone immediately jumps to cheating. Herpes can lay dormant in your body for years before you ever see an outbreak. One of you could have caught herpes before you got married and it's only now showing up ... if it is in fact herpes. Get yourself to a dr and have it checked. Could be as simple as an ingrown hair for all you know right now. Like the saying goes, don't borrow trouble.|`|cr2KKT6Naa	next time when you leave for work. dont go to work. but act like you are. leave then  watch the house. she may be having the mail man in or the ups man. icecream guy. yard boy.   or yes.

It could also be something as simple as an ingrown hair...take the precautions and go see your doctor!|`|0WNuLhjaaa	Could be gentile warts  they are quite common,go to your doctor first ..or your local pharmacy. also go online to see what they look like. They can be transferred to others easily, you don't actually have to have intercourse'. Except with women, they are inside I am told. They do have a remedy, its painful, it burns...  Be a man and get the products recommended and stop worrying where you got them.. Also you might tell robin she is your wife.Let her apply the remedy, the look on your face when she applies it will have her feeling badly for you. I couldn't apply the stuff effectively my self, It is very painful.You will have to reapply a few times .They are a nuisance but not the end of the world.
6NZeItMAaa	Many of us may feel stressed out in our daily lives without knowing why. As many people are on medication due to anxiety and depression, it is obvious that many of us are under a great deal of stress. While medications to alleviate the symptoms of stress can help, they are merely a mask. The real problem is the stressful situation that we are enduring, either in our minds or in reality.    While some of us can point to different stress factors that have occurred recently in our lives, others have absolutely no idea why we are stressed. In some cases, the original stressor can be something that happened in our childhood. If you are feeling stressed out sit down with a pen and paper and try to identify the cause of your stress. In most cases, it will be more than one different problem that is causing you stress. Try to pinpoint the source of your stress by writing down everything that is worrying you.     Keep a journal of your day to day activities and how you feel periodically throughout the day. Think about the different people with whom you interact with during the course of the day and how you feel about each interaction.     Once you have identified the source of your stress, you can then make a determination on how you can handle the stress that is affecting your daily life.|`|plhfe5Zaaa	I almost thought you were talking about me! It's depression. Call your doctor and say you are depressed with suicidal thoughts and they will get you an appointment really quick. They will give you meds that hopefully help you feel better. Sometimes it's trial and error to find the perfect fit for you so don't get discouraged if the meds don't work. To keep my mind off of death and being sad I watch tons of TV, listen to music, and bought myself a puppy. It works most of the time. (I'm not on meds... shame on me).
a1ymHaWAaa	lol my grandma never wore dentures they made her gums sore.She said after a while your gums toughen up and you can eat without it being so sensitive,Oh yeah she had no teeth.|`|Fs7rCHO9aa	Wow.

iqGaNZTtaa	Absolutely true. A severe but not uncommon form of testicular cancer, called embrynal or germ cell carcinoma, produces choriogonadatropins (UCG) which are secreted in the urine and pinpoint the sad diagnosis.|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	No!|`|PfCtJgkgaa	Beta hCG Quantitative (a type of serum pregnancy test) can be used to evaluate and monitor male patients with testicular tumors.|`|AA11388527	Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP),  Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (-hCG) and Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) are the three tumor markers used to detect testicular cancer.  Because pregnancy tests detect Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin in urine, it stands to reason that such a test could be used to screen for testicular cancer or, at least, raise suspicion of possible cancer.    If a man had already undergone gender reassignment, how was it she happened to have testicles?|`|BJERgbM5aa	If it comes out positive, the only thing that might be assumed is that he IS pregnant, he IS NOT pregnant, or the test is bogus.
8goEkQ49aa	I don't blame you for being worried, especially if this interfering with your swallowing.  Don't wait to see the doctor -- the other two writers are right.  Even if it's not cancer (who knows?) it needs to be addressed.  GO!|`|eI0IUHQ2aa	It could be a number of things. There are tumors that are cancerous and ones that aren't. Either way early treatment is very important. Most cancers are harmless if removed early on|`|xVmbTsAbaa	Go to the doctor asap.

QUXnsjhkaa	Yes it is normal. You should have been given anti-biotics for infection. Those normally take 2 days or so to take affect. The swelling will go down once the infection is being treated. It will probably be anywhere from 2 days to a week before the swelling is totally gone. You can try cold compresses against your swelling. Leave a few minutes, remove, repeat in 20 minutes. Try this several times.    For pain, over the counter pain medications are very effective in controlling the tenderness.  Motrin, Advil or generic Ibuprofen give the best results when two to three tablets are taken every six hours.  If you are allergic to Ibuprofen or Aspirin-like drugs or if they cause stomach irritation, Extra Strength Tylenol (one tablet every six hours) will also work well.  With more severe pain, the combination of 600 mg of Ibuprofen (three over the counter tablets) plus one Extra Strength Tylenol taken every six hours has been shown to be more effective than narcotic medications.
l4anfnt7aa	I had the same thing happen to me -- root canal like 12-13 years after a chipped tooth incident right in the front. But I don't recall feeling a ball of anything in my gum. I would definitely tell the dentist. If you have a 2nd appointment that you haven't gone to you, you may even want to call the office and just ask the question before the day of your appointment. At the very least, give them a heads up about it before they finish off the root canal treatment.
RyYWzEZcaa	Technically you can get pregnant on any type of birth control.  Nothing except abstinence is 100%.  Take a pregnancy test, it should have been long enough since New years to know.  But, I've had 3 babies and never once had that as a symptom of being pregnant.  The discharge could be related to the UTI.  I know someone who had a UTI spread to a kidney infection and had a bloody discharge.  You might want to get that checked out!
ykCo6SDOaa	Tendency to 'love handles' is just one of the key sites for fat deposits on your body. So - less body fat = less love handles.    Only real answer is keep on the steady dieting down. make sure you achieve energy deficits daily.    Ad some ab crunches and some side twists with pole over the shoulders to help the posture and this will target the musculature that helps to 'pull things in' also.    Don't do situps they are bad for the back - stick to strict crunches that do not stress the lower back and only work the abs.    the side twist will help to pull and firm the muscles under the area whert the love handles are.    Steady and disciplined  - there is no instant answer (outside of liposuction which I do not recommend!)|`|THZC87W0aa	eat plenty of broccoili it helps!!

" Help? How do I get rid of it??? "  If you decide that you want to try to reduce the amount of cellulite you have, the best thing to do is to decrease excess body fat. If you and your doctor think that you are overweight, eat fewer calories and exercise more. Experts agree that an exercise routine that combines aerobic exercise with strength training is the best weapon against cellulite. In the meantime, if you want to conceal your cellulite, try using a self-tanning product. Cellulite tends to be a little bit less noticeable on darker skin.       " Why?!? Im so young and Im not overweight!?!?!? "      Cellulite describes a condition that occurs in men and women (although much more common in women) where the skin of the lower limbs, abdomen, and pelvic region becomes dimpled after puberty.    Cellulite is the lumpy substance resembling cottage cheese that is commonly found on the thighs, stomach, and butt. Cellulite is actually a fancy name for collections of fat that push against the connective tissue beneath a person's skin, which causes the surface of the skin to dimple or pucker and look lumpy.|`|9bnvLL28aa	don't worry hun I have it too!!

duVTqRM4aa	www.modifilan.com  It's a seaweed supplement that has been extensively tested.  It could build your blood and give you some natural sodium.  it also boosts the thyroid because it contains iodine in case you have a low thyroid (which I highly suspect you do).  Healthy thyroid and sufficient iodine intake are a good way of preventing excess weight gain.    ALSO, stay away from table salt.  It's highly refined and heated.  Get some UNrefined natural sea salt.  Here is a link but there is plenty at the healthfood store.  www.celticseasalt.com    ALSO, low blood pressure almost always mean you have a hypoadrenal (and/or hypothyroid) condition.

GAHFiIqSaa	You are having supernatural experiences. As such, you are not hallucinating or dreaming. What you are experiencing is very similar to what people experience during a haunting, which can lead to great anxiety, fear, and involuntary actions. Generally, these spiritual actions are merely attempts to get the individual accustomed to having a spiritual presence, without fear. In other words, you are being trained not to be afraid.    I would recommend that you embrace the situation. Rather than wait for a spirit to show up, just call out to it in you mind (telepathy). Try thinking, "okay, I know you are there, come and talk to me." You will hear its responses in you mind as if they are your thoughts. Be nice to all spirits and they will be nice to you. You may ask that the spirit in question to stop waking you up and forcing you to scream.|`|3Tqfmtxwaa	wow.... psychologist might help... don't know other than that.

7294c9edbf7c247468b6e48776c6fcadaa	First place you are not going to get bulky male type muscles unless you are taking tons of male growth hormones, and steroids. Your nature female hormones will prevent that.  If you are interested in toning and conditioning primarily just do circuit training which involves one set of each exercise with medium to light weights and a high reps. and not resting between exercises. Then vary your exercises {working the muscle group a different way} to avoid muscle assimilation. And only workout three to four times a week to give your muscles recovery time.  Like on Monday:  Set ups one set  lat pull down narrow  leg extension  bench press (chest press with machine)  leg curl   Military press (shoulder press with machine)  squats ( no more than ninety degrees on knees to prevent blowing out a knee)  bicep curl   bent over row  dead lift  upright row  tricep press (French press)    Wednesday:  Roman sit ups   reverse lat pulldown  hip adduction  butterfly (chest fly with dumb bells)  hip abduction  behind the neck press or 4 count with dumb bells  leg press  hammer curl: keeps the bicep muscle from looking knotted up:  dead lift  tricep dips    On Friday:  leg raises:  decline bench press angle down 45 degrees:  squats no more that ninety degrees on knees  miltitary press  calf raises  lat pull down  upright row (standing row)  deep back extension  reverse curls  leg extension  reverse lat pull down or wide lat pull down.  leg curl  tricep push down:    Use weight you are comfortable doing 15 reps with to start. work up until you reach 25 reps then add more weight.     Or you can junk all that and get you a total gym: Note don't buy it off info-mmercial.  You can get them a lot cheaper at Wal Mart.com. Difference between paying in the $1,000's of info mercial and paying from around $150 to $379 + sales tax in your area.

	This depends on you and how much determination you have.  It works out to $900 per yr.   If there is a nutritionist in your town or closer than the gym, I would opt for working with them.   Exercise could consist of buying a pedometer and walking everyday with a goal of reaching 10,000 steps per day.  You would start slow and work your way up.  When you start losing the weight, maybe then consider going to a gym for toning up.  I am not sure if this is possible because of your vision.  But anyway, good luck.|`|twksVOjGaa	In my opinion it would be worth it but what I do at the gym is just the same as walking. Maybe you should try just walking some everyday. Also making a few healthier choices everyday like taking the stairs or parking farther away when you go shopping. The little things add up and can make a big difference.  Good luck on your weight loss endeavor.
VERrlErvaa	You need to be more specific.  There could be many reasons for this.  If you are exercising everyday, of course that is going to put pressure on your legs - sometimes you need to rest a day in between and switch to low impact exercising.    The fact that you are 13 leads me to wonder why you don't ask your parent(s)/guardian to take you to a doctor and assess you.  If you have a serious problem, now is the time to deal with it and not expect someone with no medical expertise to give you advice.    Finally, again, you're 13 - it could be growing pains.  You have not disclosed your body weight, shape or size - so it also depends on that too.  If you are overweight, then this could be putting extra pressure on your body, particularly your legs and ankles to support the weight.  If you are just an average 13 yr old - then it could most likely be that your body is growing and you will occasionally get these aches and pains.    The only other idea I might have is that you have injured your back in some way and that, in turn, has created nerve damage leading to your legs.    In any case, go to the doctor.  It is the best and safest option and the medical field will then be able to advise you on what you can do.    Good luck.    As for the jerk that told you to lose weight... Come on, man...

Stop now or you can do further and permanent damage. Excercise is good, but moderation is the key to success and good body strength. No pain no gain is a falsehood. Give it up for a few days until all the pain is gone. Then start out slow. Make sure you walk and warm up the muscles before you start with the excercises...and when the muscles start to burn, that is time to quit. Gradually, you will build up to where you can do a lot more. Keep in mind, that your physical body is not yet completely grown.

If you start to hurt, your body is asking you to listen and your answer should be :"Ok, I'm done for now".  I'm really glad you're interested in fitness, but be careful.

vp8806Eraa	weight loss or weight gain is pretty simple - if you consume more calories than you burn, you gain weight. Burn more than you consume, and you lose weight.<br>  <br>  2lbs of of fat equals 7000 calories. So you need to expend 7000 calories more than you are consuming in a week.<br>  <br>  if you weigh 130 pounds, and you walk at average speed (3.5mph) you'll burn 73 calories per mile. So 2.5 miles a week = 182.5 calories<br>  <br>  If you weigh 130 pounds, and you use the cross trainer with moderate effort, you'll burn 713 calories in your 90 minute session, or 4991 a week<br>  <br>  <br>  SO - total calories burnt through exercise = 5173.5<br>  if you eat on average 1250 calories a day, that'ss 8750 a week<br>  <br>  But just being awake, talking, even sleeping all burns calories too.<br>  <br>  So assuming you burn about 140 calories an hour at school, at 7 hours a day,that'ss another 4900 calories a week<br>  <br>  Sleeping burns 55 calories an hour - so 8 hours a day burns 3080 calories a week<br>  <br>  So assuming you do nothing except goto school, sleep and exercise<br>  <br>  <br>  ======================<br>  total calories burnt = 16,730<br>  =======================<br>  total calories consumed = 8,750<br>  ========================<br>  <br>  = 7,980 calories a week that you will be losing<br>  = 2.28lbs of fat loss a week|`|JiOhZ0Bgaa	to lose one pound  = loosing 3500 cals<br>  <br>  so either = try and do 7000 at the gym or<br>  <br>  well its usually 2000 a day for women so thats 14000 a week so half it....<br>  <br>  but I'd recommend you do a combination of both!|`|bsMwySYJaa	very good<br>  but stick more to 1500 cals <br>  1000 is too low <br>  xx|`|3ctL64O4aa	Yes just remember to do that exercise and kept that healthy diet.

Sugar free Jello is very easy to make and you can put a bit of sugar free whipped topping on it.    There are also sugar free pudding mixes, and you can buy low carb puddings already made up in pudding cups. Check labels for anything under 10 carbs per serving.     Fruits that are low carb are strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, blueberries, all served fresh and without sugar. If they need sweetening, a bit of Splenda (the sugar free one, NOT the Splenda Blend) would be fine.    If you can't get fresh fruit, by frozen with no sugar or honey added. (just the fruit). Don't serve canned fruit, its always too high in sugar.     Regular Dark chocolate can be ok in very small quantities.

Do you have a carb limit for meals and snacks?  Do you take insulin based on what you've eaten?  Beware of "sugar free" foods, they still have carbohydrates.  Read lables on everything you eat.  Most diabetes cook books suggest sugar substitutes for the real thing, but flour and other ingredients still have carbs.

Firstly, and most importantly, we must make sure that they are fresh and have not "turned."

I think once you've had it youre never really free of it 100%, from what i can remember getting over it to say I was 'over it' when it first hit me took about 6months to a year. Its the worst thing I've ever had in my life|`|hYOEQdgnaa	i had glandular fever, its not nice huh.  they told me it stays in your system for about a year before it clears fully!  best thing to do is eat well get enough sleep and avoid things like marathon training!  dont worry you will be back to normal soon.  they call it the kissing disease and if i ever see the girl who gave it me i'll kill her lol

Relax.  Hormones suck.|`|XzEGvaXjaa	It sounds more like you are just a very violent, angry person in all honesty. And no, we aren't all angry and violent.    You are probably going through typical puberty (anger, sadness, mood swings, and distrust are typical of all teens really), which would mean that you should be coming on your period soon. But don't think you can just treat people like that and get away with it, regardless of the reason. Period, PMS, puberty, just plain bad mood...it doesn't matter. You need to learn to control yourself...you may not want to hear it but its true. No one is going to put up with that, no matter how close you are to them.    EDIT: And just so you know that I'm not trying to persecute you, I'm speaking from my own personal experience. I often have very violent mood swings before and during my period, previously to the point where I would often be a risk to myself and everyone around me. However, its not a pleasant thing and its something that you really do have to learn to control. And trust me, its possible. You will drive people away from you, you will hurt yourself, you will hurt others, and in the end you'll end up being alone. So calm yourself down, it'll do you good...'cause "I was having PMS" probably won't hold up in any court, lol.    EDIT 2: First - Why would any of us know your mother is dead? Second - What does your mother being dead have to do with being a violent person? That's a poor excuse. I express my sympathies as I'd hate to lose my mother, but that's not an excuse for violence and anger AT ALL. By that logic, then most people in the world would have a good excuse to abuse, beat up on, and murder everyone else. If you need to, get counseling and therapy (therapy doesn't mean you have mental problems by the way; even healthy people can get therapy), but don't take your sadness out on everyone else and try to use her death as an excuse for it. That's sickening. Should my boyfriend be violent toward me because his mother died? No. Same holds for you. No excuses.    I do not condone abuse and unnecessary violence, I don't care what your reasoning is. Simple as that. And "My mother died" isn't going to hold up in court either. So again, I suggest you find a way to calm yourself down or you're going to end up in a world of pain. I know this probably won't get me the best answer now, but whatever, its the truth whether you want to hear it or not.|`|S1jddreQaa	Well it sounds like it could be coming soon. The fashion thing doesn't have anything to do with it, but the rest might, unless you just a angry person. lol.|`|4zoN1U3Waa	Very soon.|`|2rwCS0F8aa	don't be excited. it sucks.|`|e30clNGGaa	Probably, and as for your anger its completly casuall, just make sure no one gets hurt, always carry a pad or tampon around so no surprices!!

ad9AssJZaa	that depends on personal preference. My boyfriend thinks Camel menthol are the best, but when I smoke one of those, I feel like I am going to die. I know someone else who thinks Marlboro reds are the best, I can't smoke those either. I like Camel or Marlboro lights the best, but my boyfriend thinks they taste like poop.

Tc23KWgzaa	Do you like yogurt?  Activia Yogurt will keep you in shape.  GI Pro by Mannatech (on-line) is very good stuff--one capsule a day.    Learning relaxation techniques would help a lot, since attacks are largely started by emotional upset/stress.    Fiber helped me a lot.  I take Fiber-Tabs--like 4 a day.  It's important to keep things running--if you allow your bowels to build up stool, your next IBS attack will have more ammunition.  Any more than one day, and I take miralax.  I promise you can't taste it, feel it, and you'll never know it's there until you go.    I suffered many years with IBS.  It's under control now.    Feel better!  TX Mom
P3Fg1K2Vaa	. squat    Squats are a great way to shape your butt, add some feminine muscle to your butt, as well as eliminate fat from your butt. There are numerous versions of squats. I'll give you a few of the best here....    Squat with weights... Use a barbell and squat down so that your upper thighs go below parallel. The lower you go, the more it focuses on your butt instead of your legs. I recommend you do 5 sets of 10.    Wall squats... Find a wall and put your feet about 18 inches out from it, lean your back straight against the wall and squat down until your upper legs are below parallel.    Hindu Squats... I think these are the best for fat loss and shaping your butt fat into muscle. Without weights, squat up and down as fast as you can while swiping or touching your finger tips to the ground with each repetition. Do 100 repetitions in less than 5 minutes. Once you can do that, do 200 reps in 10 minutes or less.    2. deadlifts    This exercises tightens up your butt big time. Just pick up a barbell from the ground in front of you while maintaining a relatively straight back with your eyes looking forward. Do 5 sets of 10 reps and you'll get a really firm butt fast.    3. Isometric butt squeezes    This is great for shaping your butt. All you do is lie face down and squeeze your butt together as hard as you can for as long as possible. Do this for a total of 5 minutes a day.|`|aujHVGFiaa	Exercise!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|oZdMcksMaa	Exercise.|`|9bnvLL28aa	omg I have that same problem!! I excercise a lot but its still sooo big.

5akokd0Faa	actually running inside your house is differnt than running outside.   the reason is, when your running outside the sun is hittting you and this is healthy for your body. like plants we need the sun as part of our health life.   also when your ouside the air your breathing is fresh and the oxygen is more alive. you need a lot of that air to keep running a healthy pace.   when you are inside the air is more closed there for it is more easy for you to hypervenalate which is not a good thing.   it is more healthy just to run outside.|`|MLISHPCcaa	It would be, as long as you don't stop running (taking short breaks) or you'd have to start all over again.

And when you hit a wall, youll think about doing it outside. :)|`|647e04ec98f14cb0162f876543076705aa	Not exactly. In your home you do not have any wind resistance, or uneven terrain, like hills, gravel, rocks etc. So technically your work out will not be the same.|`|fJFgoYo4aa	yeah... but you'll get bored quick, and end up with squeaky floor boards =) lol|`|mJx42D2Iaa	If it's the right distance, then it's pretty much the same. The only difference is that you don't have the terrain of outdoors, which has bumps and hills. You also don't have the hard impact of concrete, which is a good thing. It also can get boring quickly if you're indoors. Overall though, there's not much difference and it's great exercise. Good luck!|`|eji2mBAlaa	no.  You dont get fresh air in your lungs which helps to get you body adjusting to the exercise plus you would have to stop and turn at each end of the room and you would hardly be running as there wouldnt be that much space to do it properly.  Bummer, i know!!  :(  x|`|4fded85bb017fba5407e3727176079ffaa	Seriously???    Whatever.  It depends on resistance.  If you run on grass, you will burn more calories than on concrete.

y5l98f2haa	you want to do high intenstity interval training every other day and it'll suck the fat off your body.  make sure you're eating plenty because if you stop eating thinking your body will eat your fat, you're going to create a body crisis and your body will go into survival mode, and start storing fat and eating your muscle.  when this happens you lose the capability of burning the fat because your fat burning muscle tissue is gone.    what you want is to build muscle muscle muscle, eat lots(but healthy! -sugar is no good, animal fat is no good), hit the weights, and get strong.  once you have more muscle, you have your fat burning engines throughout your body, muscles are the tissue that burns the fat.  understand?    ok, so once you have the muscle Don't stop eating!  thats the  1 mistake for people at this point(they lose their muscle and keep all the accumilated fat and are in a hole deeper than when they started.  you want to continue eating but cut your calories slightly under what you would consider maintanance.  but eat consistently 6 times a day if you can.  this keeps your metabolism healthy(as if you're keeping wood on the fire that's burning within(which is responsible for burning the fat)    and I'm telling you, high intensity interval training(HIIT)  works for getting the fat off.  I came from couch potato and heard about it after running miles every day and not getting bodily results.  I started the HIIT and within a month I've noticed a very obvious decrease in body fat.      HIIT basically is sprinting for 30 seconds resting for 90 seconds, sprinting(30) resting(90) etc.  6 times total per workout.  what it does is suck out the energy in your muscles and make your body tap into the reserve energy(your love handles)    its intense, but its the most effective way to get rid of your body fat, and you'll be a screaming machine for the ladies if you're committed to doing this every other day(along with weight training)    google: HIIT|`|XsAZNx2Eaa	when your fat ,you will always be fat|`|8vL3Igzjaa	cut right down on your salt intake as salt makes you retain water so youll look chubbier than you are, also eat nice and healthily. dont go spending too much on shakes and supplements, theres no point in filling yourself with loads of carbs and protein if ur body cant actualy work it off. (carbs will give u energy and bulk u up, the protein builds muscle).    youll want to do quite a lot of cardio such as runnin/jogging, cycling or rowing to burn off any excess fat you have. also when lifitng weights see what your maximum weight is( for example if u can only just do 1 rep at 20kg on a dumbell) then go slighly back from it (so it would be about 18kg) and do 2-3 reps. 3 sets. (low weight high reps will tone you, high weight low reps will build muscle.)    always push yourself, once you cant lift again, do another one, until you literaly cant lift.    also do your workout 1 day then have a rest day, then workout again then rest. this gives your body time to heal itself and repair your muscles.    before you excersise warm up and stretch so that you avoid any injuries, but if your going to lift weights dont stretch before hand as stretching temporarily reduces muscle power. instead use some resistance to warm the mucles such as light weight.    hope i helped.
ucsYXXdSaa	yes theres lots you can do to help them.  this website has lots of good advice including stuff from people who have panic attacks    http://www.anxietyuk.org.uk/condition_pa...    cutting down on caffeine is one thing you can do straight away, cos caffeine makes anxiety/panic attacks worse|`|aujHVGFiaa	Meditation is a mental discipline by which one attempts to get beyond the reflexive, "thinking" mind into a deeper state of relaxation or awareness. Meditation often involves turning attention to a single point of reference. It is recognized as a component of almost all religions, and has been practiced for over 5,000 years.[1][2][3] It is also practiced outside religious traditions. Different meditative disciplines encompass a wide range of spiritual and/or psychophysical practices which may emphasize different goals -- from achievement of a higher state of consciousness, to greater focus, creativity or self-awareness, or simply a more relaxed and peaceful frame of mind. Giving this sense of relaxation and peace, meditation ultimately leads people to find peace within themselves.      The word meditation originally comes from the Indo-European root med-, meaning "to measure."[4][5] From the root med- are also derived the English words mete, medicine, modest, and moderate. It entered English as meditation through the Latin meditatio, which originally indicated every type of physical or intellectual exercise, then later evolved into the more specific meaning "contemplation."    Eastern meditation techniques have been adapted and increasingly practiced in Western culture.          http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditation|`|5XDf8voLaa	ahh i have tha same thing, i cant help you but i starred your question lol|`|VmJmyAkmaa	I also have panic attacks.    What really helped me was being able to ID triggers or situations that put me on edge and just try to mentally prep myself against them. Also once I realised that my panic attacks were panic attacks- I was able to calm myself down better.    I have a low dose perscription for a benzodiazepine that works well for me. I only need a dose like every other month or so.  There are other drug choices that are not as sedative. Buspirone works well for my best friend.   Low dose Zoloft on a daily basis is also used. I perfer to not be on a medacation everyday, so my as needed doses work for me.    Yoga has really helped me!!! It helps you destress your body and your mind. Plus it helps to build the connection between your mind and control over your body. This is useful when I need to calm myself down.    I also practice mindfullness exercises.   http://stress.about.com/od/tensiontamers...    Exercise also helps with panic attack prevention alot. It helps to get rid of stress in your body.    One thing that really helps my anxiety (because its social related) is playing Singstar. Its a karaoke video game and the singing and being silly just helps to take the edge off of my day.    Good luck!|`|F8tQkDPcaa	There are 2 programs out there that are famous for treating Panic Attacks and Anxiety successfully.  They are: Panic Away and The Linden Method.    You may wonder, "Which one is better?" Don't worry, you're not the only one with that question.    The Panic Away program is more appropriate for people who can cope with their Panic Attacks or Anxiety well.  Linden Method is more for those who aren't really good in coping their Panic Attacks or Anxiety well.    Check out the reference for the full UNBIASED comparison and review.
22EtnQmgaa	The best advice: make sure you have shaving cream and a styptic pen.    A styptic pen can be purchased at most pharmacies and some grocery stores. Just get it a little wet and use it if you nick your skin. It'll stop the bleeding immediately.
U37fBHvLaa	I recommend Jogging or Pillates!     Drink Lots and Lots of water,  Eat more fruit (if you do not like fruit very much, give smoothies a try! They give you everything fruit does but in a nicer way) Smoothies will help you with not snacking... SNACKING is the worst thing!     Jog daily, and if the weather is bad, try aerobics or Pillates.     Try eating salad or very low fat meals ;D  REMEMBER: do not skip breakfast, if you do... your body will store up more fat.    good luck lovely ;)    xx|`|ykCo6SDOaa	You should not aim to lose more than about two pounds a week if you want to lose and keep weight off...so in two weeks that would be 4 pounds. You need to allow longer for a larger loss that will stay off.    But basically - need to ensure that your daily energy use is MORE than your intake.     Which means particularly cutting back on high calorie foods that you may habitually eat just now.    And over the longer term aim to adopt a generally healthier diet regime like this:  http://www.gonando.com/boost-immune-syst...

Lots of models and body builders use this method to add more definition to their muscles. Also why your stomach and such looks better in the morning, because you are essentially dehydrated.

Its better to have like 7-8 mini meals/snacks a day then 3 huge meals a day. This is true because throughout the day you are speeding up your metabolism so it is consistently digesting food in your body. also, make sure you have a lean breakfast such as an english muffin, smart butter, or jam. Maybe Fiber One cereal, or yogurt and fruit. Make sure that your attempting to eat real foods, not so much canned food, or frozen, or fast food. These types of foods are filled with many artificial, and bad ingredients that do/will have a serious impact on your weight. You could lose weight (I do not know how much your looking to lose) but in 2 weeks, making a serious change on your weight can be done with motivation and dedication. Make sure you tell yourself lets say, if you've been working out for an hour everyday and eating super healthy for like 3 days that you do not get the mindset " oh my gosh, I have been doing so good I can go to Cold Stone and have a treat. "This will screw things up. You can most def. have a treat as long as your logical about it. choose wisely. organic dark Chocolate is okay if you stick to one little square not the entire thing. you can eat a fudgescile to satisfy cravings. Make sure also that you do at least one hour of cardio. I would suggest if you have a gym membership try out one of their classes, they re easy, fun, and an hour goes by fast. Or if not, find a trail, ark etc and jog for 30 minutes then go home do 50 crunches, non stop, and 2 sets of at least 12 push ups. You should be doing cardio, and weights that way your not only burning fat your gaining muscle. That's why a lot of people who you look at who say yeah i work out, or are on the track team and run super fast are sometimes still overweight, and not losing weight. Usually, this is because they eat wrong and don't do anything to tone up (using weights). So good luck.   eat vegetables, salads, Gen Soy Bars, bananas, fruit, fish, rotisserie chickens, hard boiled eggs, a string cheese, yogurt, frozen fruit, soups, and perhaps vegetarian sushi from Whole foods, tader joes, or Jimbo's. A few almonds, Total/Fiber 1 cereal are also good ideas, and lean cooked steak. Best of luck.

If you want to keep it off, reduce not only the amount you eat, but what you eat. Stay away from processed and fast food. Eat about four to six ounces a day of lean meat, fish or poultry...and lots of green vegetables and fresh fruit. Limit your bread or cereal intake to no more than two servings a day. That doesn't mean the servings you are accustomed to eating...but what it actually lists as a serving on the package. I found that when I started measuring my food intake, that most of my servings were roughly twice as large as the recommended or needed one. In otherwords, I was overeating...even though I was eating healthy foods.    Even on a good weight reduction diet, the first ten pounds or so are usually water...and that will make your body appear slimmer...even though you will have not lost much actual body fat. Continue excercising reasonably. Don't overdue it. Heavy muscle building excercise does help you to lose fat, but you will increase muscle...and sometimes even increase in size.

AxvG9B3waa	This is all very interesting and promising, far from prime time however. Hopefully though it will actually work when given to humans and not to human cells in a test tube. Unfortunately many drugs don't actually work when you place them into a complicated host like the human body.  There are many trials looking into this drug in a variety of human malignancies. Let's hope it works.    Blessings

ZzXK3nAAaa	That, my friend, is an addictive problem--not only to the substance, but to pride, the feeling that you're more entitled to the substance than others, some of whom need it for otherwise unbearable pain. Please do two things:  1. Watch "House" on TV--he's a brilliant doctor with a smashed and incurable leg who's addicted to Vicodin, which is hydrocodone.  2. Seek drug counseling, NOW!!!!! Unless you want to go crazier. You're not going crazy; your feelings tell me you're there already.    I take oxycodone (Percocet) every day for an incurable neurological condition. I take the minimum dose they make, and make sure I cannot get it without going through a pain management clinic. I do not cheat or look for it from others because of my past medical history, and I want the rest of my life to be manageable.     If you do not do these things, you are in for a very bad ride indeed. At the very least, seek a Narcotics Anonymous meeting, but I recommend counseling first--the right sort of Licensed Clinical Social Worker might help most, especially one who's female.|`|TXlPfydxaa	It sounds like you're addicted to it, there's not much you can do to suppress the craving except waiting it out if you're trying to get off it. As an addict myself, however, I've found that lorazepam (Ativan) helps loads, I'm addicted to oxycodone though, and when I don't have it, after a day I'm going through massive withdrawals, and the lorazepam helps with the psychological symptoms of withdrawal. This method can be more dangerous however, if you get hooked on lorazepam which is a benzodiazepine, and withdrawals from benzodiazepines can be fatal, while opiate withdrawal is rarely fatal. The withdrawals can last 8-12 days, and the symptoms won't peak until the 5th-7th day, and then they'll slowly taper off, other than hydrocodone itself, there's really nothing else that would satisfy you, I know I've tried pretty much everything, so, if you wanna quit, find a methadone clinic in your area, and the methadone will stop the withdrawals. It won't get you high however, and if you start treatment and try and take hydrocodone, it'll still work as an analgesic, but the methadone will block the euphoric effects of it.

Some is by recognizing what caused your immune system to get weak, then avoiding those things as much as possible. Before I share many ways to boost your immune system, take a look at some possible reasons why our immune system gets weak.    1) Toxins: Most people today have excess accumulation of toxins and waste material in their bodies causing their body to be acidic and adding stress to their immune system function. The two main reasons for this is  a) People are putting huge amounts of toxins (mostly unknowingly) in their bodies on a regular basis and  b) their elimination channels are clogged, slow or sluggish.  c) toxins like "junk" food, medications(drugs), sugars, excess alcohol, allergens all stress your immune system, thus making it weak and unable to fight the germs when exposed to them.    2) Nutritional Deficiency:  When your body lacks nutrition, you will have a weak immune system.  Since our bodies can not produce nutrients needed for optimal health, quality food plays a major factor in keeping our cells healthy and our immune system strong. Food not only provides energy to your body, but all the nutrients that are essential for a healthy immune system.    3) Lack of drinking healthy water:  Dehydration means the cells just simply do not have enough fluid. Dehydration cause medical problems including pain, arthritis, asthma, and allergies, among other medical issues. It can affect your energy and your sleep, and the ability to get toxins/waste material out of the body.    4) Lack of physical activity:  Lack of regular, moderate exercise appears to slow down cleansing the body of certain toxins and waste products    5) Lack of sufficient rest:  lack of sleep will stress your immune system and thus increase the risk of catching a bug.    6) Chronic stress  People who are under chronic stress have lower than normal white blood cell counts, are more vulnerable to colds and other viruses and take longer to recover from them. They are more likely to experience more severe symptoms than people who are not under a great deal of stress.    The good news is you can strengthen your immune system by doing as many of the following list as possible....    1) get plenty of rest. During deep sleep, our body release potent immune-enhancing substances that strengthen your immune system function. By not allowing our body sufficient rest, the immune system will sputter, and as a result, not function at full capacity. We then are more likely to become ill with common illnesses. A healthy, deep sleep allows our body to release a significant amount of growth hormone that boost the immune system and aids in the growth and repair of the body.    2) get moderate and regular exercise  An increase in blood flow associated with moderate exercise helps to circulate antibodies along with white blood cells necessary to fight infection more quickly. As a result, this provides our bodies with an early warning system to ward off potentially damaging germs. In addition, the increase in body temperature as a result of physical activity may aid in inhibiting the growth of bacteria; thus allowing the body to fight infection more effectively.    3) Detox Your Body  Body cleansing is essential because our bodies need to properly eliminate the toxic build up that has formed in our intestines (colon), which may lead to sickness and disease. Our body organs and tissues must be free of toxins for the immune system to function optimally thus enabling our bodies to receive the essential nutrients our bodies need.    4) Boost immune system by drinking plenty of alkaline water.  Water is essential for all living things and keeps our immune system operating optimally while improving the way we feel, look and live. Without sufficient amounts of water, you may experience routine fatigue, dry skin, headaches, constipation, and a decrease normal bodily function which may lead to your body unable to fight off diseases. Without water we would literally dehydrate which could result in the shutting down of vital organs and ultimately end in death.    5) Eliminate all sugar and allergens from your diet.  Just a small amount of sugar has been proven to impair white blood cells up to 50% for very short periods of time. By discovering what our personal food allergies are, then eliminating or desensitizing them will help strengthen your immune system. By removing these triggers, our immune cells are strengthened in order to combat other invaders such as influenza rather than the allergen. The elimination of sugar from your diet can also strengthen immune system.    6) Eat nutritiously  Good foods to eat include organic fruits and vegetables,   Stay away from junk food like pop, bake goods, any processed foods. Bad foods contain stuff like refined sugar, sodium nitrite, Trans fats, Mono-sodium glutamate (MSG), Artificial colors, preservatives, and flavors.    7) Take supplements  Supplemen

Remember we are using the simple carbs to get them running into your bloodstream, or a glass of apple juice.  With in that thirty minutes taken down a chicken breast, or can of tuna for your protein fix.

I explain to them that the imbalance in his moods is in no way a reflection of how he feels towards the person asking the question, just that there are times he can't control withdrawal or outbursts or extreme happiness and then withdrawal. I explain to them that it's just like a person with a heart condition or diabetes - you take pills and see doctors for these disorders, but they are more "acceptable" than mental illness because they've been around longer in the medical field. Yes, reading about the illness is right if the person would like to expand knowledge, but if your son is ok, maybe he can help explain it too, or tell the person he doesn't know how to explain it. Sometimes honesty is the best in dealing with the "elephant in the room", he will see many people come and go in his life (as my husband has lost many friends who just could not handle the whole situation when his mood swings are severe), but always be upfront with close friends and especially family members so they understand it's NOT them nor is it your son's fault for feeling the way he does, it's just the wrong wiring in his brain and medication can only help so much. Hope this helps!
AA11879143	Alcohol is the WORST thing you can do. Alcohol is a depressant, meaning it will make the condition worse, often much worse. You may feel good for a while, but when you come down, it's miserable. My last big bout of depression I couldn't touch alcohol for months.    Weed's probably not a great idea either. It can trigger terrible anxiety and panic attacks, and can cause psychotic behavior in people who already have mental health issues. Add that to the fact that pot can be laced with all kinds of crap, and it's just a recipe for disaster. I can't say pot ever made my depression worse, but it certainly never made it better.    Your other options? Exercise, it raises the level of your good hormones, counteracting depression while also helping with a host of other physical problems. Consider getting a full-spectrum lamp - they're really expensive, but raise your happy hormones as well. I have one and it has literally changed my life. You can also consider St. John's Wart, an herbal supplement that has been shown to have some impact, but you have to take it regularly for weeks in order for it to be effective.    If you do decide to share this with your parents, you can minimize their worries by the words you choose. When I'm going through a time hard enough where I feel like I have to tell them, I just casually say that I've been having a hard time with my emotions, or just that I've been sad lately. They don't worry then, but still know something's going on and can be supportive.|`|KAkeAyOJaa	It sort of brings your soul out of your body and you only think of pleasant things.

I suffer from depression and have done for many years. Some days i'm ok, some days i'm great and other days are awful. Weed made the whole thing much worse and alcohol will do the same. Weed has a tendency to make people paranoid and alcohol is a depressant any way.   You could try St. Johns Wort as a herbal remedy or others (see the link below)  Personally the only way i can deal with depression is to take tablets from my doctor. You could talk to a doctor about your depression and discuss your concerns about tablets, see if your doctor has any other ideas.  Hope this helps, feel free to email me for advice.

I'm not talking in a public service anouncement way either, chemically weed and alcohol are depressants and logically will only limit the seratonin your brain produces even more.

I know how much depression sucks but to be blunt tell your parents regardless if you desperately want the dead weight off your shoulders, go see a psychiatrist and they'll give you options such as cognitive behavioural therapy.  Don't wait for it to go away and let things stew or go down the stupid route of taking drugs which will deteriorate you further. I'm sure you already know this.|`|qC6mwvDSaa	no weed or booze . . . I have multiple disorders and I am on prozac; doing weed or drinking is self medicating and does not work at all.  I would tell your parents . . . they love you and care for you, believe it or not. smoking weed and drinking will make you worse and your friendships worse and your family relationships bad or worse. Do not self medicate. see a doctor and a therapist right away. Go to your primary care doctor and get a list of mental health centers in your community.  or go to the welfare office for a list. you need help. pleeasse go to a doctor. it is nothing to hide or be ashamed of and drugs and alcohol are not the way to go and will just get you into worse trouble.  I will cross my fingers that you do the right thing.  good luck and many prayers. . .|`|otXtHrVnaa	Weed is "alright" because it will help you with depression but you can't be high all day long, believe me I tried. You have to be extremely careful because there is an extremely fine line between abuse and use when it comes to weed so try not to become a fiend.    and if you use weed or alcohol to suppress your depression it sometimes leads to hard drugs. I started using hard drugs first and then transferred to weed when i was coming off of a binge or didn't have the money for my favorites but believe me the last thing you want is to get involved with heroin, meth, crack, and all the other nasty drugs out there.    IF you do decide to drink to help. You should only drink with friends, NEVER drink alone. This will only make things worse and you could make  very bad decisions. And limit the amount you drink, becoming an alcoholic will only make you more depressed.    IF you do decide to use weed only use vaporizers or learn how to cook space cake and special brownies so you don't destroy your lungs. You should also try to hang out with friends if you're able to behave while high, its a great way to express your feelings and come up with solutions to your problems.    Depending on where you live you might even be able to obtain a medical marijuana card. This would ensure that you aren't arrested for pocession or intent to sell.     BUT remember drugs can't solve your problems they can only numb the pain.|`|AA11622488	It can make things worse I know it did for me i'm bipolar but I was in a depression phase and it made things worse.

6NZeItMAaa	Many of us may feel stressed out in our daily lives without knowing why. As many people are on medication due to anxiety and depression, it is obvious that many of us are under a great deal of stress. While medications to alleviate the symptoms of stress can help, they are merely a mask. The real problem is the stressful situation that we are enduring, either in our minds or in reality.    While some of us can point to different stress factors that have occurred recently in our lives, others have absolutely no idea why we are stressed. In some cases, the original stressor can be something that happened in our childhood. If you are feeling stressed out sit down with a pen and paper and try to identify the cause of your stress. In most cases, it will be more than one different problem that is causing you stress. Try to pinpoint the source of your stress by writing down everything that is worrying you.     Keep a journal of your day to day activities and how you feel periodically throughout the day. Think about the different people with whom you interact with during the course of the day and how you feel about each interaction.     Once you have identified the source of your stress, you can then make a determination on how you can handle the stress that is affecting your daily life. Chances are that your stress factors will be one of the following:      ? A personal relationship;  ? Money;  ? Job situation;  ? Health concerns.    Some of the stressors you will be able to control, others you will not be able to do anything about. But in order to help yourself, you are going to have to know what you are up against when it comes to the cause of your stress.|`|gCdP3NJGaa	Hun, only a doctor can diagnose you properly, but what you've described it does sound likely - your symptoms sound very similar to what I've suffered in the past. It is horrible, but it will get better with help. Please, go to your doctor, they will most probably give you tablets which should help (if the tablets don't work, go back and get them changed) ask for some kind of talking therapy, psychotherapy is the best option. If you find it worse in winter, investigate Seasonal Affective Disorder, its possible a light box could help you. Do you have a friend you would confide in? Or there's Samaritans- that's what they are there for.

I can understand the compliments issue and how you don't like to receive them because I was like that to, I really hated myself up until I fell in love with this girl who totally broke my heart and faith in people. Now I'm over confident in my looks but lack huge confidence in myself. How does that work? I have no clue... But maybe in your situation you are just very pretty but don't see it. Maybe your scared to, or scared from a previous event in your life which makes you hate yourself like I do. It could also be that you live in a very cold state and your a person who needs sun. I'd suggest that you work out and get some clean fresh air and hot sun. Talk with a close friend or write your thoughts down in a journal. Your probably really special and unique but you feel like you have to be up to societies standards and that's just not for you. but what you do deserve is what you believe in and nothing less, otherwise you will never be happy. Keep dreaming big and keep trying hard. A good heart in a person deserves the best even if they give it there hardest effort. At least you recognize that something is wrong... there are other people in the world who could give 2 shits about what they want to change in there lives and instead live life as very selfish and greedy people. Maybe you just care a bit to much, which is fine in my book, but just be prepared for people to be jealous. Have morals and live by them. also... I'm not a believer in a "God", so if that helps at all by me not being biased then I hope you can see it too. If you are a believer than keep believing because that's all we have in this world, which is faith, in whatever it might be. If you'd ever just like to talk, I'd really enjoy talking too. I'm 20, and a college student as well. I like to hear other peoples problems because it lets me know that I'm not alone. Take care:D    Marco.|`|DDkkwPcPaa	Depression is a life and mind draining illness, it is also a disability.    I think that the person who has depression, or assumed depression should try and pin point what the route cause of this is, i.e. if you are in a town centre and you need to get to the side of the footpath because you feel that the crowds of people are homing in on you and your mind just vwants to muffle it all out and you get very paniiky then it is more than likely a panic attack, of which usually a short span thing in my case. I gave a lot of positivity to this I told myself that it will only last a short while.    The main problem is that GP'S CPM'S and the mental health teams do not tell you is that what is prescripbed is not the only thing that you need, you do need medication and emotional help, and they do not encourage you to be positive about your illness.    This depression is a good thing, and a positive thing, it is our natural way of coping with stressful situations, if you look at it as a positive rather than a negative then that in my opinion is a great step to recovery, do not look on it as a problem to others or yourself, this is a totally natural thing that a lot of us go through.    I suffered from Clinical Depression for 10 yrs, with absolutely no help from the medical teams, I was just shoved on eefexors at a very high dosage, and never got any help from the mental health team.    I was told that I would get theoropy and it would take about 3 yrs, I was not willing to wait that long, because the depression had taken too much of life up, I got to the stage that I wanted to fight.    I had spent most of my life until 35 yrs old thinking and believing that I was not worth anything, and life was not worth living. I would never get up at 3 am im the morning to travel to work, or do anything constructive with my life.    I am now in a great relationship with a beautiful intelligent woman, whom I love very dearly, and able to hold down a job, and feel some sense of worth.    My advise is to go to a herbalist, i.e. a small high street one, that does natural products, and try them.    I was give niacin, pantathinic acid, and siberian ginsing, I probaly have mis spelt these, but I was able to come off the eefexors and go onto tablets that had no side effects, and was able to feel better, I had seen a small herbalist in Kendal, Cumbria. this is expensive, but it certianly helped me, It may not suit everybody as people are differant and this is only a suggestion.    I think that in all of this is to try and be as positive as possible,   doctors tell you to keep a daily record, this helps them to diagnose what is wrong so that they can prescribe the right medication and help needed for that patient, although this is a great idea in theory, when you have depression this is major task and is often left to one side.    I would suggest that you get a pad, and write down one thing that you know that you can do in that particular day, once this one task is achieved your confidence level will go up. even if it is to go to shop and get a loaf of bread, or just do the washing up, that is sometimes enough to make a great differance.    I know that this has helped me, I believe that positiveness is the key to depression and you can fight it, but you have to want to fight, you have taken a remarkable step, that is sharing this problem with strangers on the net! very brave thing to do, I know that you will get through this, and that you will come out of the other side, smiling with the knowledge that if you can fight depression then you can fight anything.    Do not worry about temper, that is your own personaility, you will find your own way of controlling this.    I wish you all the success in the future and really hope that this is some kind of help, to you or anyone else that is reading this.    I still suffer from depression, but it is more circumstaincial than clinical, and I have found a way of coping with it, so that I am allowing myself to live a reasonable life and not just an exsistance.    Regards   Nick G|`|AA11688429	Dear Ker,    It doesn't sound to me like you are feeling happy and content, but it is good that you are questioning how you are feeling and wanting to know what or why you are feeling what you are.    Sometimes the day can start off okay, then take a turn for the worse.... but dont forget, if it can happen one way, it can also happen the other and a bad day can turn out good.    Distraction of any form can sometimes help, to get away from the dark cloud above your head, no matter how much you want to cut yourself off from people, try to ignore it and purposely do the opposite...... phone someone, anyone and say 'Im not feeling too good', just getting that out may help in that moment.    Go and see your doctor and ask them to refer you to someone. there are different forms of therapy. Have a look into councilling and cognitive therapy. See how they work, maybe get a book out of the library or speak to your doctor about how you can move forward from under your cloud.  good luck and youre not alone, theres plenty of help out there    Theres a small book which has helped me and my friends once or twice called the little book of happiness
H5NGXgqsaa	To be very honest with you...you are probably struggling with firm/solid bowel movements which will indeed cause stress upon the anal area...such stress often times reveals fresh bleeding...red blood usually means that. You may like to check into some types of stool softeners to alleviate the stress upon the anal area/opening...fresh red blood is generally ALWAYS related to stress upon anal opening/hemorrhoids etc...Just for your info...any GI[gastrointestinal] bleeding results in dark colors in the BM[bowel movement] similar to a black color if you will...bright red blood generally signifies immediate bleeding from the anal area...not usually cancer related...

AA11020187	Breast cancer is rarely hereditary and you gave no reason to believe your mothers is. If her oncologist thought it was a possibility he or she would have suggested your mother be tested. It is doubtful anyone would test you without your parents consent and many insurance companies will not pay for it in which case you will have to pay for it yourself and it cost about $3,000.|`|3e34f165ad30f58bf7f1417310ff9c96aa	Glad to hear that your mother is doing well I found this it might help you decide  Testing for Breast Cancer Genes  It must be remembered that testing for breast cancer genes is not the same as testing for breast cancer. If one of these genes is discovered it does not necessarily mean that breast cancer will develop. Only women who have a strong family history, as stipulated by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines on familial breast cancer, will be tested for these genes in the UK.       These tests are based on blood, so blood samples are required, and they are easier to carry out if a relative who has had breast cancer donates a sample as well. Women who do not qualify for these tests under the NICE guidelines may investigate private testing options. However, any woman who decides to be tested should think about how they would react to a positive result. Would they simply continue with regular breast screening? Would they opt for a pre-emptive removal of the breast? Would they attempt to join a trial prevention group? In order to make the most informed decision, women should discuss test results with medical professionals. For women who have the tests carried out privately, this may be difficult but starting with a GP is a good way to determine if any other discussions are necessary.|`|224d1d60d1b56362532d0d7f33ab994daa	She would be the one to be tested, not you.

FVDbVcnCaa	Yeah if you can stick to that I would say sure. Keep in mind the first 72 hours is always the hardest part of the diet so once your break that point it does get better. As for eating healthy things. Take a scoop of whey protein a day with cup of skim milk. Get one that's high in protein and low in carbs. I personally use EAS Whey protein chocolate. By itself it tastes nasty so put that in a blender, add a banana, put in a tablespoon of peanut butter and it will taste delicious. Some other healthy things to eat tuna is super healthy, (don't put it on bread, just put it in a bowl, add a little mustard and it will taste good) sweet potatoes, nuts (any), WATER, cut out juices and especially sodas, egg whites (put a little hot sauce on them for taste or pepper for taste), fruit, and grill up some chicken breasts with a favorite seasoning you enjoy.

aa7925964a8d49ab0be321cad8a35d78aa	Strep is only confirmed with a test at the Dr. office. If you have really glass swollowing pain in the throat and a severe headache at the time it started it may very well be but, there are many infections and colds that cause these symptoms and they aren't strep. Look or have your mom look downn your throat and if you have any white bumps or blisters go to the DR. If not try aspirin or advil or whatever you take for the pain and fever, drink liquids, green tea, hot clear chicken broth, take extra C and rest. If the swelling doesn't get better in the next week or you start coughing up yellow or dark phlegm, see the DR. If you start feeling better after all this and are left with a cough give it another few days. If you still have the cough and swollen gland see a Dr. During the first few days you are contageous and it really is good to stay away from people. Don't breathe in their faces or touch their hands or anything else that others use. Keep your dishes and glasses seperate and put a little bl;each in the washing of these utensils if you don't have a dishwasher with the temp boost on it. Everyone in the house will get it if it is viral. Sometimes viruses can turn into secondary infections which need an antibiotic but you need to give it at least 10 days if you don't have the white bumps in your throat. You may have tonsilitis or if you are left with a cough it may be broncitis. So, let it run it's course, taking care of yourself is important...liquids and maybe some robitussin to help relieve the cough. Good luck.

Your tonsils will be very swollen and if you open your mouth wide, you will find white, puss-like things all over your swollen tonsils, also your ears will hurt very much. You lymphnodes become swollen, so swollen that sometimes it will be hard for you to breathe as it is blocking your airway. Im not sure where the brutal coughs are coming from, for that I can only suggest that it may be bronchitis. <br>  <br>  You need to go to your doctor, or an urgent care. If the case of strp throat is severe, they can give you antibiotics, motrin 800mg or in my case they gave me a shot in the behind.

See your doctor.|`|ry3f5dxHaa	well those are very legitimate answers, but i believe the best bet would be be contacting a chiropractor. surprisingly they use similar techniques and that could really make a difference but if not, another possibility is having a parent (preferably the father) rub both of your ankles for a couple of minutes, followed by a warm bath and a cup of tea|`|D78jfOMZaa	Strep throat comes with this symptoms: Fever, white spots in your throat, hard to swallow food.

Tkp1qsXdaa	the low dose of medications worked for me, i don't want my thyroid destroyed.|`|RGKdb0wHaa	I have done RAI treatments and after wards I pretty much felt the same as I did before I had it done except my throat burned a little, slight stomach ache and was really tired but that could have been from not taking my thyroid meds for so long.  It was kinda scary going into it because the doctor takes you into a cold room and they are dressed in a protective suit so that's kinda scary to see but it really isn't that bad and it takes about a minute to do it, so I wouldn't worry to much about

RXI8ImdIaa	Do they advertise free health services? I never saw that ad.    anyway, around here you would go to the county health department. I don't know what it's called in your city but there should be something along those lines.    if you just can't find it, start calling health providers and ask if they know where you can get free anonymous testing. Places to call would be your school's clinic, blood labs, physicians, pharmacies, hospitals - these sorts of people will know.|`|2y3rFvZIaa	Go to www.hivtest.org and find free clinics in the area. I think AIDS Community Services is free,|`|USoqyjaAaa	Don't you have a student health clinic?  Or you can call your local health department.  Or make sure you have the right information from Planned Parenthood.  They should have a sliding fee scale.  They're not free but I can't believe it would cost $300 to go there.     Of course, I don't know your personal situation, but if you are this short on money, it might not be a bad idea to hold off on sex until you are able to support yourself properly, including providing for appropriate medical care.

6dHIoJLVaa	Yes it is okay to walk any and every day of the week.  If you are exercising heavily, say more than 2 hours every day for 5-6 days a week, you should allow your body to rest, but that doesn't mean you can't move!  Just don't over exert yourself on off days, really allow your body to heal, healing is just as important as exercise, if you don't allow your body to heal you may get injured and lose all the benefits from all your hard work!|`|xKYXurpNaa	YES,    It is good for you and helps your body recover from training.    Days off are only for restraining from doing structured exercise such as a 30 minute treadmill program, etc.|`|ymZlFYn1aa	Yes think about it, our ancestors walked and ran and hunted and gathered everyday, all the time. The human body was made for motion.|`|RXI8ImdIaa	Yes, you absolutely can and should do this. An 'off' day doesn't mean sitting on the couch all day  ;-)
0jtZi1jVaa	Yes you will, depending on how much you exercise. It take 3,800 calories to gain 1 pound of fat. So if your not burning it off your body will store it.|`|1EsCezctaa	Hey dude that happens to all of us..Happend to me this week infact and the week before. Tommorow just go exercise and eat healthy and if you get a craving chew some gum and drink water cause the chewing of the gum will make you get the satisfaction of eating and drinking water will fill you up. Also eat lots of fiber

Read the book "The Food Revolution" by John Robbins.|`|6NZeItMAaa	Many of us may feel stressed out in our daily lives without knowing why. As many people are on medication due to anxiety and depression, it is obvious that many of us are under a great deal of stress. While medications to alleviate the symptoms of stress can help, they are merely a mask. The real problem is the stressful situation that we are enduring, either in our minds or in reality.    While some of us can point to different stress factors that have occurred recently in our lives, others have absolutely no idea why we are stressed. In some cases, the original stressor can be something that happened in our childhood. If you are feeling stressed out sit down with a pen and paper and try to identify the cause of your stress. In most cases, it will be more than one different problem that is causing you stress. Try to pinpoint the source of your stress by writing down everything that is worrying you.     Keep a journal of your day to day activities and how you feel periodically throughout the day. Think about the different people with whom you interact with during the course of the day and how you feel about each interaction.     Once you have identified the source of your stress, you can then make a determination on how you can handle the stress that is affecting your daily life.|`|b09a95122fd9bc36dd862d2d74cf004faa	Depression means that for long periods (weeks, months) you are feeling sad.

Perhaps that thought is about something that you need to deal with in your life.|`|c0b3a3d1ca8d64e5dea7c223d45e5348aa	anxiety attack?
75Oa8Ni7aa	Stay away from "my pyramid" and anything else put out by the USDA.  They work for the food industry whose primary interest is in you eating more, not less, no matter what it does to your health.    Virtually all commercially processed foods have additives which make you hungry or crave more.    Buy organic whole raw foods and process it yourself.    Virtually all carbs, fats and proteins are broken down to smaller units, but carbs are broken down to units which are most easily built up into fats for storage, while proteins and fats are often broken down just as far as building blocks for cells, hormones, enzymes, etc.    The best way to build muscle is to eat foods that provide building blocks for muscle, like fats and proteins, and excercise.|`|0wrP5tQeaa	If you go this website down at the bottom of this... this is a way to keep track of how many calories you should consume each day.

YzLEDCiTaa	I can't really tell, <br>  But It would be ideal to book an eye test as soon as possible. <br>  They will be able to tell you whether you need glasses or not, and will give you your prescription, Even if you don't need glasses you should go and get your eyes tested. <br>  You may just need them for close up reading or far away things. <br>  <br>   Book that appointment!|`|xieiM0FRaa	See an optometrist or your school nurse. They can do eye exams and tell you whether or not you need glasses. I recommend seeing your nurse first, because you won't waste any money if you don't need them, but if you do, she can refer you to an optometrist.
ZjhQ6PL8aa	While between 200-240 is considered borderline high risk.  My question to you is what's the subfractions.  What that means is what are your LDL, HDL and VLDL levels as that is a more accurate measure of cholesterol then the total number.      Why is your number high is a tough one as there are many things that influence this.  You have diseases, family history (from what you mentioned it's not in your favor), diet, body weight and physical activity.      There is no specific mark on how much you can drop it in 3 months.  All you can do is measure the results for signs of improvement.|`|iqGaNZTtaa	Because of your quite significant and heavy genetic penetrance, in addition to your dietary changes, you should also be on a low daily dose of one of the statins.

Exercise and diet do not work for everyone in lowering their cholesterol...didn't work for me either... I have been on Crestor for 3 years almost and my numbers are fantastic now...it gives me great peace of mind to know that.    Good luck with everything...you are certainly doing your best.

hmsMpECkaa	It's not gonna harm you, it's just a lot of waste of time and money.  It says 48 hours because the medication in the bandage has to soak into the skin below the wart to kill it.  A wart is a living organism; a virus.  And if you do not remove the whole wart, it will grow back.  I would get it taken off by a doctor and watch where I put my hands.

5pszijaDaa	i'm not a doctor so don't use this as medical advice this is just what i've learned from my masters embryology classes...    hearts of babies in the womb have a different flow pattern than adult hearts. after the baby is born the heart has to change the flow. they initially have a little hole covered with a flap to allow the blood to shunt that then gets closed off when they are born. however sometimes this process is imperfect and the baby can have a murmur. most of these murmurs are not serious and the hole closes up. this seems to be the case in your sons case. these types of murmurs will not come back as the heart as growing has fixed itself.    however, i as i mentioned i am not a doctor and thus am not fit to diagnose your son. i would ask his doctor about this question and ask him/her for a further explanation if you don't understand what he/she is saying.|`|TORBP6QIaa	Yes they can come back and also some can go away never to be heard again.  If it has gone away and the doctors say he is now fine then stop worrying...|`|LHomWyYQaa	I would not worry too much about it if it has gone.

Your body will begin its menstrual cycle when it's ready, just be patient. Ask your mom or other female when they got their first period, and maybe yours will be similar to theirs. I understand u wana feel more like a girl, but having a period isn't all that great. Sure, it means you're able to get pregnant and ur basically a woman, but you get awful cramps, bloating, sometimes nausea, you have to wear uncomfortable pads/tampons, and it can ruin your clothing. Also it can smell really bad and u can't have sex w/ur boyfriend if u wanted 2.   But u gotta b patient !  xD|`|bfw1AtAtaa	soon.    some 'right before symptoms' are:  sensitive breasts  brown discharge  really bad stomach aches (cramps)    you sound kinda like me, and i got mine a few months before i turned fourteen. i hadnt even started wearing a bra yet, and BAM! out of nowhere i have my period!|`|Ti1xO4GDaa	Hey hun!! TRUST me when i tell you i KNOW how you feel. I didnt get it until like the week after i turned 16. i literally used to cry & pray for it frequently, and also would get frustrated with not feeling "normal" bc all my friends started. I would just be like who cares bout cramps, i want it SOOOO bad. i felt like crap bc i wanted it so badly, so trust me i've been in your shoes. My friends would all be like "ur soooo lucky" and it made me feel even worse. I went on www.beinggirl.com like every day and post my stats asking when i'd get it....    the truth is though nobody knows what day you'll get it. i wish there was some way you could push a button and itd say which day youd get it, but its just whenever your body is ready. unfortunately you cant rush these things or predict them, and when it's time it will come. judging by your stats you should get it pretty soon, hang in there!! and you are definitely not the last girl on the planet to be waiting, some girls i've heard dont get it til 17, 18, even 19!!    Once you get it you will realize why everyone's telling you its not a huge deal. when i first got it, i was out getting ice cream. then came home and looked down and i was shocked, i turned pale and felt like fainting from shock LOL :) but after that it's just kind feels yucky and you'll know what i mean. i've only had it twice (last one on Jan 7) and i dont have a whole lot to complain about except sore boobs & feeling nauseous.    Anyway i hope this helped you feel a little better. theres tons of girls out there wishing for it it too, and i totally understand the feeling when people say you dont want it, but really its the only thing you can think about at the moment. definitely go to beinggirl.com it helped me a lot!! best wishes dear!! :)|`|4KNZ0xefaa	you will def. get it soon. some time definitely before your next birthday. it seems like a while but its not. ask your doctor! i know its reallly embarrassing, but at my 13 year checkup i asked and he said "definitely before next summer" so yeah. ask!    also ask your mom. its kinda awkward, but she wont act weird about it.       i had really painful boobs and my stomach hurt before i got it.     uhm i don't have 20 reasons why you wouldnt want it because its not torture like a lot of these complainers who cant handle anything think.      andd.....      they say the later you get it the healthier it is and early developers are more likely to develop breast cancer in later life.     alsoo....    the later you get it the more prepared you will be!!      ex. if you get it at school, you know what to do.    if youu get it at home, you wont be like "WHATTTT IS THISS!" and pass out        yeah. don't worrry so much!!!

So it's up to you to which extent do you want to become slimmer. May be not so much, just a few kg? then you'll become more fit and save everything. you don't have to loose all the weight, may be just a bit.|`|9IP9Beleaa	Pushups may help to make them look bigger because as you build muscle under your boobs it will cause them to push out a little more. Bodybuilders have no boobs because they concentrate on losing body fat, and boobs are fat.  But it's unlikely you'll work out to the point you'll lose your boobs.
AA10531094	You could have external or internal hemorrhoids.  Use Tucks and/or Preparation H for the discomfort.  Drink plenty of fluids and add more fiber to your diet.

Really, when you are in your young teenage years you shouldnt be planning exactly what you eat or counting calories. this isnt enough food and nutrients!!   and dont say you eat so little because you hardly exercise, because not exercising is unhealthy to!  talk to your doctor if you are worried about somthing, but girl exercise alittle more and eat more too!|`|vCWyJFhsaa	Absolutely not, you will be well on your way to the hospital if you eat that minimal. As a living human being, you require at least 6 meals a day, MEALS not an apple, or a granola bar. Please eat plentiful, and healthily, and stop pestering yourself about weight. The biggest weight gainer is pessimism, be optimistic and don't set so much of yourself on losing weight, it will come so as long as you are happy.|`|bsaAI0HFaa	wow yeah! that is perfect! in no time you should be losing weight. don't be afraid to snack a little
7fXpLlhBaa	It IS because of bad circulation. When you are cold all the blood rushes to your core and not your extremities (your hands, feet). If you squeeze your hands closing them and releasing them, it would help the circulation. If this does not help, go to a doctor.
6LtmIxhCaa	No, crisp is all sugar. You mean just Calories. Sound sliek you are saying 120,000 calories. Just eat the banana. it has sugar in it too along with potassium. very healthy for you.    http://www.myspace.com/thebestjoshhartev...|`|k8F0n289aa	omg i didn't know that  but banana's are more healthy  basically its just fat in a packet if u eat crisps  xx|`|9de253f092d1cc279c1330f75282b4b4aa	LOL.  Don't forget WHERE the calories come FROM.  Those chips may be packing 90 Calories of Fat, while the Banana is giving you some healthy carbs, potassium, and mood boosting. What have chips given you?  Think of all the bad calories and terrible affects!  But Bananas, now that's healthy living:)|`|fbeb2b3a6c2e7530b3c5cb36459afcbcaa	why? food with more calories are better for you|`|7fXpLlhBaa	That sound about right, but bananas are great for your body. Try to eat at least one large banana a day- it's obviously loaded with potassium, is  a source of energy, and boosts your mood. Sure, that 90 calorie cookie packet is low in calories, but you definitely get more nutrients out of the banana. You can alternate between the two foods if you want.|`|7iHg8CKtaa	LOL but i guess it has less saturated fats. and banannas have like a mood booster thing in them that makes you happy =] lol i like being happy haha.|`|i2jNoGIKaa	bananas are really hea;thy and can give you more energy...go for the banana|`|doeg7JSaaa	Crisps are full of fat salt chemicals and all things bad for your body whilst the banana is pure healthy natural fruit which is 100% useful to keep your body healthy and full of vitality. try to add apples and citrus fruits and nuts if you can afford.|`|WS9TooJKaa	Yes but it's not just about the calories, it's about what's healthier. Crisps have tonnes of fat in.
5AHU0FNgaa	it's ok to eat under 2000 for a little while, as long as you eat low fat, low carb food & eating alot of vegetables n fruit. excersising so the weight you lose doesn't convert itself into fat    you don't need to lose weight your bmis 20 which is perfect for your height, concentrate on just eating well & excersising regularly|`|xd9fq0CKaa	yeah thats ok i think cuz i only consume about 1200 or less x|`|FFbWgs0Xaa	If you are overweight then you can drop to 1,800Kcals a day untill you are back within a healthy weight range but other than that you should eat 2,000Kcals a day to give yourself all the enery and nutrients you need to be in tip-top condition.|`|6LtmIxhCaa	That would be completely fine. good luck.    http://www.myspace.com/thebestjoshhartev...|`|twksVOjGaa	I was told by my doctor that you should eat around 1200-1400 a day when trying to lose weight.
6LtmIxhCaa	Because every human being on this planet is different than the other. Everyone has different metabolisms. some fast, some very slow. This is all based on genes. It isn't true thta you put on all the wieght, that's just stupid. You can't put on weight from food you ate years ago.    Excersizing and taking your B vitamins will increase your metabolism. Water also helps a ton.    Don't worry about someone else's body. Worry about your own. Find out how YOUR body loses weight. How YOUR body works.    http://www.myspace.com/thebestjoshhartev...|`|C88VCkvnaa	Some people just have high metabolisms. I think for a lot of people though, by eating junk all the time, it just causes problems later in life.|`|wUfZJvbUaa	they are just lucky... they have got great genes... and High Metabolism! wish i was one of them!

2r5LyDYlaa	I had almost the same cycle as your describing. I would have 9 day period and stop for 2 weeks and start again. It sucked. The doctor did some ultrasounds and found nothing wrong. Don't be worried, birth control will help you out. My finally became normal after sometime. I suggest you do go on it because I was told it could eventually cause anemia.      Birth control will make your period normal. It will kind of train it for a while =)|`|v4gUI96yaa	9-12 days does seem a bit too long to me and it is ok to not get your period on the exact same day each month it is usually every 28 to 34 days.I think you need to talk to you health care provider to make sure something is not wrong.I have heard of girls going on the pill just to help with the period.I also congratulate you on your morals for not being sexually active at that age.|`|4zoN1U3Waa	Start taking a birth control pill it helps. Talk o your doc before you do.
d6M0jmIkaa	This is something your going to wan to take up with your doctor.  It sounds dangerous and you should probably avoid driving, if you can, until this is figured out.  It could be anything really, but one thing that comes to my mind is epilepsy, partial seizures can cause what you are describing.  My sister had epilepsy and she would blank out like you are describing.  Definitely go to a doctor and get things checked out.|`|94NYYq5Haa	I bet its just an attention lapse, but go to a doctor and be sure to rule out some type of seizure disorder.  These could be partial seizures.|`|AA11826766	the easiest thing to point out would be that maybe you have too much on your mind. how's about you get a journal and write things down that come to mind and revisit them later and see what comes to mind. or maybe you need to seek help from a professional. if you think it's too much for you to handle see someone that would know better.|`|B4YESGmwaa	Time lapses is a sign of petite mala seizures. I would let a doctor know about this right away. It can easily be controlled by medication. If everything else you say is true that seems the most likely cause. If you did not have other things on your mind then you should have been aware. Does this happen more at night than during the day. Or at twilight.
nwcJI64naa	If you want to get stronger without building muscle mass, just do lots of reps with fairly light weights. Wearing yourself out in a few minutes is a good way to get bigger, but doing a longer, drawn-out exercise with small weights would probably be best for your situation.    Swimming is the very best way to get stronger without getting big.|`|mrjRPHzTaa	Workout with more reps. More reps and lighter weight helps to to gain muslce but you don't get all bulky.|`|xKYXurpNaa	Lift heavy weights (4-8 reps) and large muscle groups.    High repetitions cause muscle hypertrophy (build muscle) not tone you up like people think.|`|6LtmIxhCaa	Weight lift and keep eating the same amount of calories you are etaing now. You can lift all you wnat and won't get bigger if you don't eat enough.

vVfH8yBYaa	Osteoporosis is not a genetic condition, it's one brought on by dietary deficiency.    If you're only dietary source of calcium is one glass of milk, the calcium in your multivitamin is not enough to supplement your daily requirements. You need a Calcium tablet as well.

ilTdInlFaa	you get healthy body parts|`|P3Fg1K2Vaa	Vitamin A plays a role in a variety of functions throughout the body, such as:    Vision   Gene transcription   Immune function   Embryonic development and reproduction   Bone metabolism   Haematopoiesis   Skin health   Reducing risk of heart disease   Antioxidant Activity     The B vitamins often work together to deliver a number of health benefits to the body. B vitamins have been shown to:    Support and increase the rate of metabolism   Maintain healthy skin and muscle tone   Enhance immune and nervous system function   Promote cell growth and division  including that of the red blood cells that help prevent anemia.   Reduce the risk of pancreatic cancer, one of the most lethal forms of cancer[4], when consumed in food, but not when ingested in vitamin tablet form.[5][6]   Together, they also help combat the symptoms and causes of stress, depression, and cardiovascular disease.    All B vitamins are water soluble, and are dispersed throughout the body. Most of the B vitamins must be replenished daily, since any excess is excreted in the urine.[7] A six year cobalamin store can be found in the liver, despite its water soluble nature         immunomodulation   cancer prevention and recovery   cardiovascular disease prevention   Role in all-cause mortality    plays a role in immune function , protein synthesis wound healing, DNA synthesis, and cell divisionZinc also supports normal growth and development during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence  and is required for proper sense of taste and smell. A daily intake of zinc is required to maintain a steady state because the body has no specialized zinc storage system
duVTqRM4aa	The ONLY thing that even remotely works is natural progesterone cream.  But you don't need it, you're young and you just need to accept the way you are.  Not all guys like big breasts, and even supermodels have small ones much of the time.|`|216e9d2a9f5ad2b5a2b68182ef145573aa	From a guys point of view, I personally rather smaller breasts.... "nothing against you girls with big ones"|`|OR5PhU40aa	Eat a lot of fast food chicken. There are hormones in them, which usually causes breasts to naturally enlarge.    I ate a lot of it during puberty, and I'm a 34C (and I have been since age fourteen).     This also works for shrimp and the ***.|`|OsT64mqMaa	Be comfortable in your body. Your size doesn't matter. Be yourself, not someone else you are trying so desperately to be.
QBUypAmAaa	I felt the same way you do when I was about 18.   A restored foreskin is no different looking from an intact penis when flaccid, that is provided if you have restored to where the foreskin fully covers the glans. The difference is noted when erect, eventually the prominence of the circumcision scar will disappear with restoration, so that's not what will give you away as being previously circumcised. More than likely it will be your lack of frenulum that will. Your glans will return to having a smooth and glossy look and feel to it, provided when you were circumcised it didn't kill off too many nerve endings there from being forcibly detached from the foreskin. But even then erect it can be hard to tell from a distance, up close is where they'll know. Ridged bands will not restore completely, but the folding of the skin will creating a look similar to them.    I recently bought a TLC (birthday present to myself), and have been wearing it for a little more than month. The differences I've noticed so far is that my glans is so much more sensitive now since it's pretty much covered 24/7 by the device. The glans is not fully back to being all smooth, that takes time. Luckily for me, I wasn't given the tightest circumcision, mine was seemingly loose so if my head is dry or just a little moist, my restored foreskin so far can stay covering the glans. When masturbating the looseness of my skin to roll back and forth across my glans and corona is one of the best sensations I've ever felt and definitely worth restoring in my opinion.    The only cons of the TLC is when tugging tightly it can cause some pain (not intolerable though), and when walking if it is not tight enough or too tight or the glans is a little wet, it can slip off.     I don't blame you for not wanting the parents to know, I didn't tell mine either, because they're ignorant on intactness and how important it is to me or you. Unfortunately, you're under age so you can't go out and buy restoration devices readily. So what you can do is taping which is a nice start, then when you're 18 go and get the TLC like you said.     The one thing you must know is that this takes a long time to do, years, you have to be persistent to see results and never give up. Starting young though is definitely to our advantages because the constant growth rate of cells is higher so full coverage may take a year to 2 years depending on how bad you were cut, of course it can take longer as up to 4 years as well.    As for the links provided, some of them may have adult photos of restoration progress, or involve adult models showing how to apply different devices, but since this is for educational purposes and not sexual pleasure, I feel fine posting them. Good luck in your endeavours and I'll be glad to answer any questions you have on foreskin restoration, just go to my profile page and shoot me and e-mail. I'll probably get back to you same day.|`|TsjqzanQaa	You can begin restoring right away, tonight.    I know of several guys in my restoration support groups who have restored manually, just using the hand to tug, and they have achieved great results.    You can pull the shaft skin, stretching it gradually and gently, so as not to cause skin tears, with your hands.    Simply pull as much shaft skin to try to cover at least a part of the glans and keep doing so at every available opportunity every day.    Don't get discouraged; it's a long, drawn-out process.     You won't see a dramatic increase all at once, but you have to persist.    The thing to watch out for is using too much force, so that you risk tearing the skin.    This will give you more and more skin, so that when you finally get a TLC Tugger, you will have more skin to work with, and you will be able to make even more progress.    I've been using the TLC Tugger since March, 2007 and have had great progress.     At times, I have full coverage, and you couldn't tell that I had ever been circumcised.       The scars have greatly dispersed, and the remnants are hidden under the new foreskin.    It feels so much better with a foreskin, the way that nature intended.  About 200,000 guys are restoring, as more and more of us have discovered that we were cheated out of the best part of the sexual experience, when our foreskins were stolen from us.    By the way, I don't personally like the term "faux skin."     Faux means false, or not real.      My new foreskin isn't original equipment, but it is a foreskin that covers the glans, and it is real.  It is alive, has feeling and the new inner foreskin is especially sensitive.    Restoration is the best thing that I've ever done for myself.     I feel more whole and complete, and have more of the feeling and appearance that nature intended.    Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.    A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.|`|K4zsztkRaa	It looks 100% real once you are finnished.  Altho it takes 6months around or more to actuallly retain coverage once you are done. Before the skin has a chance to tighten once you are done growing it it won't stay down over the head as well. But give it some time and it will fall into place.  And they will be able to tell that you will be getting more skin, yourbest bet is not to shower in gym. You don't need to shower anyways.      Brandon I have been restoring for almost 5months now, if you have any questions you can email me off my profile.  I can answer any question that you have in more detail.  I love doing this, I can also tell you some taping methods that will help you with sensitivity as well.     -Connor|`|xBd96wvRaa	Ask for your parents help with this.  No doctor will perform the surgery w/out parental consent.     So many parents say: I got my son circumcised becuase I didn't want him to be singled out in the locker room!
f5wRhbpuaa	Put one some heels, otherwise there is no why. Sorry, its just your genes.|`|fbeb2b3a6c2e7530b3c5cb36459afcbcaa	nothing makes you taller     Hey ppl don't thumb down Obama for telling the truth|`|g7M1DxFCaa	As you're only 11 you should understand that at this age there's a lot of difference between how tall different people are and that's not because of how tall they'll be when they stop growing but because different people hit puberty at different ages and that's when you really start to grow.  Obviously, likewise people finish growing at different ages too.  I myself am only 5'4" (165cms) tall and although I used to find it very upsetting when I was your age (and obviously much smaller than that) it really doesn't bother me at all these days, as said you have to accept that you're who you are.  When I was about your age (in the early eighties) scientists discovered and isolated the human growth hormone and it became available for medical use, but not available on the NHS.  It was very expensive and therefore only available to the rich.  I was really upset that I couldn't get this but later on discovered that due to inadequate screening, virtually everyone who had this treatment in the early eighties contracted AIDS and they're nearly all dead.  So I'd say that at least in my case I was fortunate not to have this wish granted.  You have no idea how tall you'll be when you've grown up, just let nature take it's course.    EDIT:  Hina S that is blatant dodgy cynical exploitative american marketing techniques for probably equally dodgy products.  Correcting posture may help but if these drugs were any good you'd be able to get them from a doctor, not some rip off internet company that'll probably deliberately close once they've got everyone's money and open up again the next week with a different name, so you can't sue them.

I don't have any real good plans on how to lose belly fat, other than to just do nonstop sit-ups. Probably about 100 or more sit ups a day. And remember, if it hurts while you're doing sit ups, that means you're doing it right and keep on doing it!

Try 1 pill at first, and drink something relaxing, like hot tea. Now go lay down on the sofa and watch a funny movie that you've seen 100's of times. You'll be out in no time.|`|AElFESKVaa	yeah but you would like have to take the whole bottle for it to kill you|`|8IyZphFVaa	yes you can. you should look into valerian and other herbs or techniques, or get to the source of  the problems rather than using sleeping pills.|`|ZVDboZkPaa	Everything is possible and anything taken to excess can kill you.    However, if you are in the United Kingdom and since 2001 you cannot purchase tablets that will kill you if you sit down and knock back the whole box.  You just sleep for a long while.    Now there are two sorts of prescription, firstly those issued by your doctor and secondly those issued by a hospital.    The sleeping tablets that a doctor can prescribe - presuming that it is NOT a repeat of a hospital authorized one - have a low to medium chance of causing you harm.    At a hospital level you are given full-strength medication with a medium to high chance of harm if taken unwisely.    Controls are emplaced by the individual milligrame dosages of active ingredients wihin each tablet or capsule and by the quantity that can be prescribed at any one time.    Personally, I often work through the night when I cannot sleep and then sleep when I feel tired the following night.    There are herbs that will relax the individual, not eating within a couple of hours of the time for bed is a good idea and not firing the mind up but doing something which closes the brain down is also good.|`|PoVODmciaa	yes you can.    excessive amounts can cause death, others can cause severe problems with internal organs.     i think you can go up to about 5 without suffering serious side affects, but dont hold me to it|`|lLcpQCI5aa	Yes.|`|E8Z5PWmcaa	Yea but it wud take a lot of tablets to kill you, its not as simple as "oh i took one more than normal, I'm gonna die" depends on the body type, how long since eating etc
PgIbB8tXaa	At your age and height you should weigh anywhere from 105- 135 to be within the healthy weight percentile.  Maybe look on google for a childs BMI calculator.

Remember to enter that you are only 13, it makes a lot of difference since you are still a growing child.|`|UCq4Ap5Eaa	like 100-110|`|6LtmIxhCaa	EXACTLY 105 pounds and 7 ounces.

BJERgbM5aa	Broken or not, expect some bleeding, especially when you're sleeping.  But not a big deal.  Ex-ray will show if there is a break.  Not treatment.  Just a strip of tape on the effected area.  Will hurt for a day or two.  Take care.|`|LLnNjH94aa	It isn't broken.  Even if it does have a hairline fracture they can't do anything for you.  Man up.    To Jon Douche:  No.|`|RlPeaD8Qaa	nope, it's not broken. my lamp fell on my face exactly where you said yours hit. Your nose is so painful because the cartilage is sensitive, or possibly, the worst possibility is that your nose is bruised.  and to this Joel guy, just shutup.|`|381eb5244a845cff58e5a278ff8092fdaa	not broken but even if it was, theres nothing you can do about it

d456069f8e03a8bf7a79de76c7e45228aa	I hate to alarm you unnecessarily but you need to have this checked immediately. The problem isn't what you can feel . . it is what you can't feel that may be underneath the skin . . think of an iceberg . . on top of the water an iceberg may show only the tip, while below the surface there an enormous expanse . . the same with a tumor  . . you may only be feeling the tip of the iceberg. It is essential for you to have this clinically checked by a doctor . . hopefully it is nothing but you need to have it check just in case.    The reason is because cancer has no symptoms . . especially in the young. A young persons body is generally so healthy that cancer can co-exist in the body for a long, long time before it is noticed. Often the only warning a teenager or young adult has that they have cancer is an unexplained, hard lump that seems to be growing (although some tumors grow slower than others . . you don't know) . . that is the only warning you will ever have. So . . it needs to be checked.     Young people tend to get cancers called soft tissue sarcoma which can be located anywhere on the body . . it is a cancer of the bone or muscle or ligament, fat, tendons, blood vessels, or just the soft tissue itself. There are other types of cancer as well.    Cancer in Teens  http://www.cancer.net/patient/Coping/Age...

Seems as if it was a lymph node swollen like that, it would be painful as hell.      I've run across lots of those sorts of things over the years - they come out as a wad of cells which are all stuck together for who know why.      Keep an eye on it and see if it changes, but I bet you'll still have it at 60 unless it just goes away one day.  Seen that a lot too.|`|xBsrCN4Yaa	You need to tell your doctor about it.  Better safe than sorry.    It's probably nothing, maybe a benign tumor, but you should still talk to your doctor just in case.|`|8goEkQ49aa	From your description, I would feel pretty optimistic, especially since it's not growing.  But it's always good to get any new lump checked out, just to ease your mind, and also to have it documented.    Hang in there!

ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have  to work double on them. The best approach is this:  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal  weight, lower for overweight).  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT  ALL. With the dumbbells you will see it in a week.|`|Pk5MvmnDaa	idk  but congrats on getting rid of the layer of fat  that's what i'm trying to do, and it's hard    can you tell me how you got rid of it?  email me please
0dDT8Hgdaa	either it was laced with something or you are just paranoid...pot will show up in your blood for up to a month if you are tested, but that does not mean the effects last longer than a few hours...they don't...period  plus you say you are freaking and then you say you are acting goofy???  which is it?|`|PVe6jK78aa	Your just freaking out over nothing. Don't think about it and the effects will subside. Theres nothing you can really do exept forget about it. It happened to me a couple times but only for like 2 days afterward and not as bad as you do. Its all in your head|`|yorfmfiBaa	Marv is right...your pot couldve been laced with something else too...it will take about a month to be fully out of your system. my advice to you is to drink alot of water and eat lots of fruits and veggies.    I dont get whats wrong with the people answering your question saying you're going to die...they're probably the same barhoes getting trashed off double hooter shooters and passing out naked on the porch...dont listen to them, you'll be fine, I promise.|`|K9z6Pcw6aa	First of all you shouldn't feel good. It is a drug it can kill you.|`|VZPvTKZOaa	To be honest with you....every individual reacts to weed differently. The weed can remain in your system for up to 3weeks, so what you might be feeling is the after effect. I had a similar experience, but mine completely went away after 3 days.

EVER. (unless of course it was laced with something). What you might be feeling is residual anxiety from a bad experience with the drug or it could have been laced (had some other drug and/or chemical on it) that you had a bad reaction to. I'm about the same age as you and have had that happen to me- to the point where I just swore I would never smoke again. But in your case, I would give it a couple more days to get completely out of your system. I find Yogi Detox tea is good for that as well as keeping yourself VERY hydrated. That is the key. I don't know when you will feel normal again but I am sure you will. The best thing is to try and relax- get it off your mind, and drink water. If you still feel this way in a few days see your doc.|`|KeczU1tDaa	Yes, cannabis can cause panic attacks w/ certain people, and yes, I have seen it before.  Occasionally, cannabis can bring on some unwanted psychological trips to some of its users.  It's not as common as the "drugs are bad, mmkay"-type of people say it is (cannabis is a fairly harmless drug, physically speaking) but it's slightly more common than some of us recreational users will admit to it being.  As a personal observation, it seems to happen most w/ first-time users or people who haven't done it in a while, when a person is under a great deal of stress or pressure in their life, and/or when pot is done in large quantities.      One of the times I seen it happened was w/ an old girlfriend of mine who had never experimented w/ pot before.  She ate one of the "magic" brownies my roommate had made, felt nothing, and then 5 minutes later ate 2 more when we weren't around.  One brownie was enough to keep a normal person baked for a few hours after it kicked in, so you can imagine what happened to her.  She later claimed that her heart was beating too rapidly and she had freaked out from a panic attack.  Days after, she complained that it would periodically reoccur.  A week later, she told us she was fine but refused to eat anymore pot brownies ever again (she smoked a few times afterwards, but made sure she didn't go too far, and experienced no consequences).    I highly doubt that the bud was laced w/ anything, as someone here suggested.  As been said before, everyone reacts to cannabis differently.  I personally think that you will be okay; remember, it's all in your head.  However, if you feel that you absolutely need medical attention or if the attacks don't subside (and I can assure you, they will), go and see a doctor and tell him/her exactly what happened so that they can see if you need help.  Don't worry about them judging you, it's been my experience that most doctors don't seem to care about recreational cannabis use, especially here in CA.  In the future, you can either try and not smoke as much as you did that night it happened to you, or you can stop altogether.  Hey, it's your body, you can do whatever you want to w/ it.|`|J1wU6cwcaa	who dies from weed, honestly? it's a plant that makes you feel funny. nobody overdoses. i had this happen to me once kind of, except my hands were so tingly i couldnt grip anything for like 2 weeks. it was really strange. anyway, i just rode it out and it eventually went away. just eat and sleep, drink a lot to flush your system too. other than that it will most likely go away with time. if not you should talk to your doctor.|`|kf6dGrsOaa	I think you're going to die.

f26c242bdb4a318435cada98be63aef1aa	Rice is a complex carb. It is an excellent source of energy. I don't think it can cause you to gain a lot of wieght. Its ok to eat. I would start off doing cardio three times a week. Either bike, run, walk, or anything that gets the heart rate up. Start off for 15 min a week then build up to 1 hour. Hope this helps.|`|zLsj2NGmaa	There are some great free resources and articles over at http://www.fastweightlosetoday.com that you might want to check out  - im confident you will find your answer over there.|`|b007371eab69364e811cf06269921755aa	There are two main ways to lose weight.    1) Burn more calories than you take in    2) Train your body to burn fat for fuel instead of carbs.      2 is the far superior way to lose weight, but you'd have to give up the rice as carbs will derail this diet.|`|sQlImMnCaa	i say you should exercise. ride bikes or use a tredmil maybe jog im not sure|`|TrS7TLSRaa	first eat brown rice instead of white rice|`|SLSX6QQsaa	I am not asian but I have to eat rice every day too lol...but anyways, to speed up digestion take something like Kyo-dophilus...make sure it has at least a billion active cells.  Its basically a supplement of the healthy bacteria that are in your gut and they will break down your food faster and help you digest it faster.  Also eat lots of veggies and fruits along with the rice.  I always eat veggies and rice with some soy sauce or Sweet chili sauce on it...and sometimes chicken when I don't feel like only eating veggies, which isn't very often.  Also eat brown rice if you can, because it has fiber and more nutrition in it.  I like white rice better but I am getting used to brown rice these days.
ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|4NiRJZkAaa	Eat less fatty things,and put less on your plate. More fruit and exercises !|`|OySU2oAkaa	Hmm. It's so tough being a vegetarian sometimes but kudos to you!    This is what I do when I'm fasting for religious reasons (basically following a vegan yet nutritious diet)    1. plenty of water --no soda or alcohol    2. fiber for breakfast (this can be done with 1/4 cup of cereal with soy milk and a yummy fruit like strawberries!)    3. for lunch I rely heavily on protein -- soybeans, lentil soup, etc. unforutnately I can't meat and neither can you but I can't eat cheese either. If you can definitely add a tiny bit of that here too! And some crackers    4. for dinner I do a healthy salad and get a good intake of veggies. again plenty of water    5. vitamins! so important!    if you want some examples of yummy veggie recipes you can definitely check out : http://i-dietandfitness.com/    Hope that helps! :)|`|tQGRJBYAaa	Eat all natural things and take bread out but if you can't resist it has to be whole grain/wheat. No white bread. Try to eat most of the things raw, so try not to cook anything. Don't eat before bed.|`|xVmbTsAbaa	Make soup. Chopped celery, grated carrot, grated sweet potato, and a few noodles is great.   Remember to do portion control on what goes in the pot. I do 1/3 sweet potato, 1/2  carrot, 1/4 pack of udong noodles. and a stick of celery. Add some stock.  Dont eat bread, because it's fattening. Try going on  a yeast and sugar free diet. Google it.|`|wyUPoHafaa	Here is a link to some yummy healthy recipes. One is vegetarian, the other has shellfish in it. I'm not a vegetarian but I don't like to cook a lot of meat either, only about once or twice a week. Good luck!     http://i-dietandfitness.com/category/hea...|`|i5U8LS7Raa	I'm also a vegetarian and trying to lose weight, and I've already lost 13 lbs in a month. I basically stick to a 1000-1300 calorie a day diet, but you might want to add a little more because you're supposed to have 1,200-1,400 at least. When I want something starchy and I have to have it I make sure it's whole grain, pasta, bread, whatever. I also eat whole grains like kasha (which is actually really good with a little olive oil and salt) instead of rice with a meal.   Always eat breakfast, even if it's just a yogurt. My choice diet breakfast is a 90 cal yogurt and a half a slice of whole grain toast with peanut butter on it. Starting your day off with protein is really helpful because it keeps you full longer.   If you like to cook, which I love to do, you can always make yourself a vegetable stir fry with soy sauce and maple syrup over kasha, and you can add in some tofu/other meat subsitute if you want more protein.   As for exercise I don't have access to a gym but I use the biggest loser cardio max tape along with a the weight training biggest loser tape and another core tape. I also have a treadmill in my house so if i'm not up to a full cardio routine I just run. I try to exercise 5-6 times a week for at least an hour. You should interchange cardio and weight training for ultimate weight loss.   If you do that you should definitely see results. Good luck losing the weight|`|kukG4Nzpaa	Hello,    I would start by using the treadmill at least 3 days a week for at least 30 minutes.  Start by using the incline at 2 or 3% grade and try to walk at a fairly fast pace, pumping your arms.  The miles per hour will depend on your stride and comfort level.  You should walk briskly and be able to speak but prefer not to.   I would also begin strength training by using hand weights at least three days a week preferably following your cardio/treadmill workout.  If you are unsure of how to do the exercises and do not want to hire a personal trainer,  I would recommend buying Fitness magazine, they always have great exercise ideas. Or, you could purchase some of the great workout dvd's that are out there.  I find "10 Minute Solution" to be great for someone just getting started.  Purchase some hand weights and try it at home!  Good luck!|`|NzfLD2Jyaa	Ok, so if youre not eating meat as a protein source, you need to make sure youre getting enough, or else working out can prove to be both dangerous and ineffective. Id suggest starting with a good breakfast, idk how strict of a veg. you are, but egg beaters are excellent first thing in the morning, you can even make them in the microwave if you dont have time. Ive found that counting calories is really helpful (around 1500 a day atmost, i know it sounds like very little, but not when you eat the right foods), and making sure youre getting balanced nutrition. Things like, light bread(35-40 calories a slice) and the laughing cow cheese wedges (35 calories each) are really great.  Also, meat substitutes, like 'morning star' sausage patties (80 calories for 2), chiken patties (un-breaded, 80 calories each), all make great meals when paired with fresh or even canned veggies. ...yves brand salami slices have only 40 calories for 2 pieces, pair that with light bread and a cheese wedge for a yummy sandwich, and around 150 calories. Bean  sprouts-any variety(clover, mung, broccoli)- are super healthy too and go great in a tofu stir-fry. I consider the sweet potato to be my miracle food, at about 150-180 calories, they can be a quick lunch or, my favorite, if you cut them and boil them for a minute or so, then broil them in the oven with pam spray and a little salt, they make DELICIOUS fries, which can also be paired with a veggie burger-no bun b/c the fries serve as a carb. Thing like yellow mustard and dill pickles are great, and super low in calories, also try to use cooking spray instead of oil at any chance,b/c its super high in calories, though some fat is ok.  Try working out using interval training to lose fat: alternating short periods of intense cardio, then longer periods of lower intensity- Running/Walking or biking works well for this, but its really open to w/e you like....and yes, drink plenty of water, ice water is better, your body burns more calories bringing it to body temperature. Also, the more muscle you have, the better your motabolism will burn thru fat and cals, plus, muscle looks way better than fat.  other foods- 'Joseph' low carb wraps  -rice cakes (50 calories and the carmal ones make a nice treat)  -'Weight Watchers' or 'skinny cow' ice cream bars (90-150 calories)  -"smart dogs" (35 cals each, with lightbread instead of a bun)  P.S: stay away from the dinning halls, you never know whats in stuff.  ...sorry for going on, and on...hope I helped!!!

Tell them what would happen to you if one of them died from smoking. Tell them what increased risks they can get (stroke, etc...).

This will change their mind.    Whenever you watch a person smoking, think of the Palmolive bottle demonstration you saw the first day of the Stop Smoking Clinic.  Visualize all of the smoke that goes into the bottle that doesn't come out.  Also, remember that the smoker is not only going to smoke that one cigarette.  He will probably smoke another within a half-hour.  Then another after that.  In fact, he will probably smoke 20, 40, 60 or even more cigarettes by the end of the day.  And tomorrow will be the same.  After looking at cigarettes like this, you don't want to smoke a cigarette, do you?|`|2Xh1ywWRaa	your parents are not children try getting them to smoke outside and don't you take it up its not easy to stop it is a drug i gave it up when i realised it was controlling me|`|b4v2zdHZaa	hold a knife to your neck and say "keep smoking" sarcastically.|`|rAKGHpsPaa	sit them down and tell them that you want them to stop|`|3653KNYDaa	find ways to distract them,   get the Satellite. channels 600-700 ;) if you know what im saying.  they keep me and my boy busy for a pretty long time;)|`|3CVPeDqxaa	have your brother take an object that looks just like a cigarette and have him put it in his mouth.

You can't MAKE them do anything.  They are addicted to cigarettes.  They will continue smoking until there is some life changing realization that will come to them (like a cancer scare) and that is when it will happen.    I am sorry you are in that situation, no child should have to live in those conditions especially with asthma.  ( I too have asthma)    The most you can maybe do is appeal to them about smoking outside on in the garage or out their bedroom window or confine the smoking to their room leaving the rest of the house for those with respiratory ailments.    I quit cold turkey started walking and chewed ALOT of gum.|`|07af3ade36531ff26b4b4b82a4f7ce03aa	Tell them the risk of smoking and that it can put their life at risk and yours if possible.

ESPECIALLY in asthmatics.  if they see what it can do to your little brother and you. it might convince them  good luck.|`|A6ib33Ixaa	Don't harm yourself at all, it'll only make things worse.    I got my dad to stop by going up to him and saying, "If you love me or care about my health, you'll quit smoking."  That did it.    You might say something like this, "Not only does each cigarette you smoke take away 20 min. of your life, but about half of all the smoke that comes from a cigarette is inhaled by the people sitting within 100sq.ft of you.  So because you are killing yourself, you're killing me and my brother.  And to make things worse, I have a life threatening disease and you aren't helping me, you're making it a thousand times worse.  I thought you cared about me."  That will work because it has many facts in it.|`|xVmbTsAbaa	Start crying. Pause for effect. Be the drama queen.  When they ask what is wrong, say that you don't want them to die early from cancer because they are smoking.  Consider confiscating their cigarettes. If you find them out, hide them.|`|Mkswzj3Taa	Pretend to smoke.. dont actually do it thats just stupid.    i dont know leave supposed "evidence" you smoked like empty packets of fags (ask your friends for the boxes?) that your parents dont smoke around the house.|`|HzkRpjhEaa	My friend quit smoking when she saw her young child take her cigarettes and put one in her mouth as if she were smoking.  Please ignore the people on here you tell you to start smoking, especially since you have asthma, but it could send a powerful message if you were to pretend to.  Like take a pack of their cigarettes and a lighter and put them in your room somewhere that your parents will see.|`|qvk3oY5jaa	OMG i have to take health, and my dad was a teen when he started smoking. he's 52 now, and he just quit THIS YEAR.    i cried my heart out during the videos of how bad smoking is and the diseases you can get, idk if my dad has any! It only takes 1 cigarette to mess with your brian, dude, no joke. there are over 400 chemicals in a cigarette. light cigarettes are a lie, seriously.    how did i get my dad to agree to quit?    i told him that he wasn't setting a good example for me. and plus, i am 13, and he is 52, how would he grow up to see me marry my husband with cigarettes? he was lucky to not have a cancer, a lot of people are not. i cried at night when i thought about how much i loved my dad, and how much he smoked.    are your parents overweight? my dad is, i added that onto a list of things that could shorten his lifespan to scare him into quitting.    i didn't yell at him to quite, i begged him to, and he saw how much i cared and that i was being nice about it, not mean.    show them empathy and understanding. let them cut down first, then save the money thy WOULD have spent buying a cigarette and put it in a jar. they can buy something nice with it, or spend it on medicine at first. after the first 2 weeks, made no diff. to my dad    TIP: my dad buys tons of tictacs. the takes deep breaths after letting it melt for maybe a minute. it helps get some feeling sorta like smoking in his lungs, he says.|`|3oK51Uflaa	start smoking yourself, let them catch you and say you need them to quit with you|`|ifafYHxqaa	show them your dick then say smoking is like eating a dick disgusting and hurts other people and that guy to lol|`|jC87btvOaa	Don't smoke dude, it's addictive. you will regret it after, just tell your parents what you think about them smoking and that you are worried.|`|f3c6506505c21cdb2337cc85bae22c4caa	You will never get them to quit. Sorry but that is the fact of the matter. You can show them reasons for quitting, tell them about all the bad side effects and show them lungs with disease and talk until you are blue in the face.....but they will only quit when they are good and ready.    They may even harbor bad vibes toward you if you keep at them about it too.     The best way to handle it is to sit down and tell them what you just told us and to let them know that you really would like to have them quit for their health and for them to be around when you get older. Tell them about all the money they could save if they quit. Then just let it be after that, you spoke your peace and there is nothing more you can do about it.       Good luck.|`|NTWZ4rBsaa	Well my friend told me that her mom quit smoking by using tootsie rolls as a ciggarette it may seem wierd but it might work|`|jPXGCJDRaa	Tell them what you've just said.     1) You have asthma, is it really a great idea for your parents to smoke around you? NO. My mom smokes, although no where near me- she used to until I got asthma. If smoke is a trigger, then you really ought to talk to your parents' about it, or the doc's who can speak to your parents.    2) They can't afford "quit smoking problems"; yet they can afford to buy a 3-6 pack of cigarettes a day? Not justified. But hey.    I'm still working on my mom to stop smoking, I would keep telling her she will die a horrible death, but I don't really wish to tempt fate. But the longer your parents smoke, the greater the adverse affect upon you and your little brother, and the dramatic reduction of their own life expectancy. Try scaring them, find gruesome pictures on the internet of smoking related deaths, tried that with my mother- her comment was "were all going to die some time" (although its besides the damn point) .|`|Aq1GIcHBaa	Maybe if they cut down on their smoking they could afford the prescription to help them quit smoking.  They have to want to quit or nothing is going to work.  I am sorry to say this, but, if endangering their son's health hasn't encouraged them to quit, and knowing that it causes lung cancer,your out of luck, It is in their hands, they have to want it bad enough to put you first. You know I was talking to my Dr. the other day,and a patient of his had just returned from the Mayo clinic and the tests the did on her a 46 year old women showed she had the lungs of a 70 year old.  I lost my father one month after his 61 birthday.  He has been missed so much bhy his children and grand children's  through out their life.  My mother is 74, he would have been 78.  I tried most of my life to get him to get him to quit, he would say, you have to go some how.  When they told him he had cancer, he tried everything thing to live.   You know second hand smoke is said to be worse than what the smokers are sucking into their bodies, but they are doing it by choice, the public gets second hand smoke by their choice not ours.  I  hope your parents don't wait until they have ruined your, or your brothers health or even their own before they quit the additive drug of smoking cigarettes.|`|MwRVtPAgaa	WHATEVER YOU DO DO NOT START SMOKING THAT IS BS YOU FRIGGIN LOZERS I AGREE WITH THE GURL AT THE TOP MAKE IT LOOK LIKE YOU WILL KILL URSELF IF THEY DONT ITS A GOOD WAY TO GET THEM TO NOTCIE HOW BADLY IT HURTS YOU BUT DONT REALLY KILL YOURSLEF|`|hmx4OGO8aa	Motivation is the most important factor when giving up smoking.  With the right motivation anyone can stop smoking, but they have to want to do it.    So you need to convince them that they have to stop.  Choosing your timing, and exactly what you say is important.  Rather than say something in the heat of a row, or when they are stressed.  Say something when everyone is happy and they are least expecting a comment about their smoking.  You also want to get your brother on side so he can say something too.    You need to explain that the reason you want them to stop smoking is because you love them and you don't want to see them killing themselves.    No parent likes to think that they won't see their child grow up.  I knew someone who smoked heavily for years but when his 8 year old granddaughter was talking about graduation she said to him "but you won't be there to see it grandad, you will have died by then because you smoke".  He screwed up his cigarettes there and then and never smoked again.    Any talk of starting to smoke to try and teach them a lesson is ridiculous.  If you never start smoking, you'll never have to stop.    You say they can't afford to use any stop smoking programs, but firstly they will save money once they have quit, so it is an investment, rather than an expense.  Secondly, there are more important things in life than money.  Good health and being there to watch you children grow up are two of them.    Although it is harder to give up without professional help, IT IS POSSIBLE.  Implore them to quit and tell them now you will be there to help them and I am sure they can do it.    There are lots of free resources out there to help, either online or at health centres or hospitals (dependant on which country you are in).    Lastly, don't give up.  Keep on at them and I am sure they will come round to your way of thinking.  Then stick with them when they are quitting.  Give them lots of encouragement and if they ever fail, keep   supporting then to try again... and again.  They can do this, often easier than they think.    Remember, stick at it, you are doing the right thing.

I was 5'8" and 110 lbs when I was 16...and by the time I graduated at age 18 I was 118.  Then by my 21st birthday I was 130.  Now at age 27 I am 145.  I have been 145 for 6 years now so I think thats the size I am supposed to be.  I'm not fat, just healthy. I wear like a size 6 pants and medium or sometimes small shirt.  I am tall and average to thin.  Please realize that you are going to get bigger because its destined to happen and needs to happen for you to grow up!|`|VmJmyAkmaa	You do have body image problems. I don't know your eating patterns or lifestyle, but your behaviors has several red flags in them.    Looking in the mirror after eating to make sure you still look thin is not normal.     Its sounds as if you have the potential to develop anorexia. I would suggest going to a nutritionist or perhaps your school guidance counsler and they can help you make a plan to not feel so much pressure with your body. It will help relieve your stress with your body and help you to develop a healthy relationship with your body and mind towards food.|`|GfyovDF5aa	Hi sweetie, I am a Nutritionist and it sounds like you are on the verge of developing an eating disorder.  It doesn't sound like you are restricting yourself from eating YET, but your thoughts are those that people with Anorexia experience.      Judging clothing based on if it makes you look thin, isn't abnormal, most girls will do this because who buys something that isn't flattering.  Also eating based on what you are doing later that night isn't bad either, it is important to keep your calories within your daily limit so if you know you are going out to splurge later at dinner, then it is perfectly fine to watch what you eat earlier in the day.  Also it is great that you exerciseThat is a good habit to develop early.      My only concern with you, is that you look in the mirmirrorter every meal.  One meal will not make you gain weight.  One day of eating junk will not make you gain weight.  Significant weight gain will only happen if you eat unhealthily everyday.  Everyone splurges once in a while, that is perfectly fine. You will not wake up the next morning weighing 5 or 10 lbs more than you did the day before. It is just not possible, weight gain happens gradually.  When you say you excexerciseot..how much is alot? A normal healthy amount is about 30-50 minutes 4-5 days a week.  If you are doing much more than that, there may be a problem there.      As far as your eating patterns, you need to eat breakfast.  Like you've heard many times, it is the most important meal of the day.  It starts your metabolism so if you don't eat breakfast, your metabolism is actually slower for the rest of the day.  I would suggest eating a 300 calorie breakfast and 300 calorie lunch.  Snacking is good, depending on what you are snacking on.  2 hours after your breakfast, have an apple with peanut butter of a half cup of yogurt or cottage cheese.  2 hours after lunch, have some wheat thins or another piece of fruit.  This will keep your metabolism working properly.      If you think you may be developing an eating disorder, you should seek counseling in your area.  The first step is realizing for yourself that you may have a problem.  I would go see someone now before it escalates and gets any worse.      By the way, how much do you weigh and how tall are you?     I hope this helps you.  You can email me if you have any  more questions. My email is Kaylacs@hotmail.com

i5U8LS7Raa	Happy Birthday! Have a light dinner and share the cake with your dad, it's your birthday and if you're dieting and exercising you deserve the treat even though it is a lot of calories. Also, the thing you said at the end that you ate back all the calories you burned, I know how that feels, whenever I exercise I'm always discouraged by the little amount of calories I've burned. You need to remember though, that your body burns between 1,500-2,000 calories just by doing everyday things like sitting standing and thinking.

W2z5dCrmaa	The problem is that after a vasectomy and the testicles being choked off so to speak, they quit producing healthy sperm in many cases.    The immune system gets stuck with the job of taking away sperm which run their life span and die, so after a time, the immune system becomes proactive and doesn't just stop there. It eradicates sperm as quickly as they are being manufactured.     In other words, you have immunized your body against sperm....your own!  For many Dudes, the immune system has actually made the testicles no longer capable of manufacturing sperm. In rare instances of vasectomy, the immune system, being efficient, just doesn't know where to quit...and how can it? In these rare instances, the testicles themselves become in danger of being destroyed to completely nonfunctional for producing testosterone, or anything for that matter.    This particular risk of vasectomy, as there are few risks aside from being sterile, is rarely publicized because of the infrequent numbers, but wouldn't you just love to be one of those?    For children, the Sperm Bank is your best investment, but stay clear of Citi Bank...as your semen could end up as some executive's bonus! Hahaha!    Even with the Sperm Bank, make stipulations because some  Lady that you don't even know could use your semen, and later charge you child support for being the father of the child. DNA testing results will give her that right in the courts.  Keep authentic documentation copy or original with you as well.     Every body wants a less expensive ride through life, or somebody else towing the bill!    Me! :- )|`|RXI8ImdIaa	I think the easiest way to do this would be to store your sperm at a 'sperm bank'.|`|72iZuDjeaa	yeah, they do it dude... i forget what it's called right now, but it's possible to have it done... check with a fertility specialist for details dude...|`|1NWjta2jaa	And your doctor, the one you are going to consult about vasectomy, doesn't know the answer and you have to get it here...|`|xxq5JAM6aa	Yep. Sperm bank is the wise choice.     I've never heard of direct extraction, but in theory, seems it would be possible from the proximal vas deferens, the tube that carries the sperm from the testes to where ever. Thats what they cut for the vasectomy. Probably not done or we'd have heard about it.    Edit: Extraction is possible. Check the link.|`|y5l98f2haa	don't worry dude, I got you covered.  I'll give your wife some sperm.  for only $50    that's the best deal of the century
QkYRnTPIaa	Telling your counsellor will be very freeing for you and will help to relieve some of the pain you probably feel.  Let the counsellor know that what you are going to discuss with her is very difficult and you are looking to her for advice and direction as to what steps you need to take to deal with this situation.  I'm sure it will be a very emotional time for you to finally tell but don't be afraid to feel all the hurt and anger during your session and ask for ways to deal with the pain.  Wish you well and I'm so glad that you are seeking help.|`|riT5XDFaaa	Speak from your heart and the truth will set you free!

Like, if you stay up till 3 a.m. on friday, stay up till 2 a.m. on saturday, then on sunday night if you try to go to bed at 10:00 it won't work because you're not used to it. You did say you go to bed around 10 p.m., but just be sure to go to bed at the same time EVERY day.|`|TMhVClBgaa	anxiety can be a problem.  do not worry when you cannot go to sleep or do not start thinking randomly when you lie awake.  maybe music could help you, if helped me|`|t8yL8Wz5aa	i have the same problem , i do a little cardio session for 5-10 mins right before my bedtime and after that i sleep like a baby, so just run or jog for a couple of minutes to get your heart going before your bedtime|`|qC6mwvDSaa	i would go to your doctor. it sounds like you are stressed or have a sleeping disorder.  Are you having exams right now?  Is school getting difficult? any stressful relationships?  examine the stress in your life. exercise is ok, but do it at least 2 or 3 hours before bed because that can give you more energy at first, then it makes you sleepy(but usually) after a full day.  I would exercise in the morning, eat healthy if you don't already and talk to a counselor and doctor. I would stay away from drug induced sleep unless you are prescribed (by a doctor) a sleeping pill. good luck  . . .
vwjeG8n7aa	Excellent...just make sure your workout is in check and you will lose it in no time.  If you need some tips here is a great newsletter Good luck|`|VPsZNfPRaa	hey :)     i think that's a great eating plan! although, id cut out the banana (have one once a week maximum if possible) as its not recommended when trying to lose weight. Replace the banana with any other fruit, except for grapes.     follow your plan and keep active, you'll see the weight melt off in no time (:      hope ive helped! xxx|`|5UPL5Rdoaa	instead of peanut butter cause that is fattining and jelly is bad to try a lean turkey on whole wheat bread cuase its lean protein|`|VmJmyAkmaa	That is a good diet. It reminds me of the flat belly diet. (which is awesome!)    Do not cut out the peanut butter!!! It is full off good fats. Yes it has calories- but good ones. When used in place of saturated fats, this is a way better choice.    I am currently doing the flat belly diet myself and it has really helped me.    Mono-unsaturated fats actually help to block abdominal fat buildup if consumed in proper balance with your daily diet. Plus that fat flows through your veins better!! Yeah!  Examples are- peanut butter, nuts, olive oil, (so is flaxseed oil), dark chocolate and avocados!  Add in some more fruit and veggies, they really help and are so good for your body!    I also suggest Hungrygirl.com- they have good recipes too.
RXI8ImdIaa	were you supposed to drink a whole bottle?    call the doctor back to clarify how much MOM is supposed to work, and how many times to take it. If it's not working like he wanted it to, you'll need to try something else.|`|cfcuBxdsaa	these types of stimulant medications can cause cramping this is one of the side effects. it may take a day or two for these stomach pains to subside.|`|GNmzjDHHaa	Drinking the whole bottle was a big mistake, that's why there are directions on the bottle.  Chances are the magnesium is still working but your body has nothing to give.  Try to go for about 24 hours, eat some soup and lay still if u can.  If you still have cramps see a doctor again,  he will not be happy with you;|`|Ztc9YIYMaa	I take it all the time if i feel really constipated i drink the whole bottle or half sometimes but it never really gives me bad cramps though. I usually drink some coffee (or something hot) along with the water it usually works for me in about 30 Min's to an hour but I usually have to go a few more time off and on. but if the cramps are that bad id see a doctor again but the magnesium should have done its job its what they give you before some surgery's
k2hSJ7Yaaa	Highly doubt it. It's not very easy to build muscle hen you're only using your body weight. That will define more than build. Buy a weight bench or a home gym. You can get them for less than $200|`|i4cGy4W7aa	Sorry man the likeliness of you hitting your goal is slim.  Why don't you use one of the two hours and go to the gym.  Find a 24 hour one.

(they don't use a laser and research journals show the light is unnecessary)  The over the counter products are just as effective.  They just take longer.|`|216e9d2a9f5ad2b5a2b68182ef145573aa	The stuff you buy off the shelf seems to work really well if you don't mind doing it over a couple of weeks.

After brushing your teeth , swish with a mixture of one part peroxide and one part  water each night. It keeps your teeth white and also prevents cavities, and it costs only  pennies. Works just as good as the whiteningstripes and it doesn't harm the enamel
W2z5dCrmaa	Sedora gave the best exclamation! Haha! I think that those inverted ones are called rolliola nipples or something similar to that. Just be glad that you don't have those!    Remember too that Dudes grow in some way or many until around age 21 to 25, and likely nipples come low on your DNA list of "to do's", being that you are a Dude! You might find yourself way more satisfied with them by then in comparing what the best Dudes have.      As a Dude, you don't need to worry, and you will for sure find many others with the same as yours. You just haven't been in the practice of viewing many Dudes nipples, and again.....why would you be? Developing your pectoral muscles also tends to make them stand out more.    Take care Man, and I bet that at age 22, we might all be surprised if we ran into you on the beach.     Me! :- )|`|SF1uPJZhaa	First off it's normal that nipples are much flatter when relaxed. And they come in lots of sizes.

381eb5244a845cff58e5a278ff8092fdaa	why are you on the computer? go to thte ER or Urgent care, you may need stitches.    apply direct pressure dont put pressure for 2 minutes then look at it.    take a WHITE yes white washcloth and tie it tighly around your finger until you get there, stop checking it to see if it has stopped bleeding  you only have a little time period for them to sew you up, if you wait to long you are going to have more troubles and a longer recovery time    go|`|RXI8ImdIaa	First - Stop panicking.    If it's bleeding, that is sufficient to flush debris out of the wound, you don't have to hold it in water right now.    If you have cut it down to the muscle or worse, you need to go to the hospital right away. However if you've just sliced off a layer of skin, you should be fine dealing with this at home.    Take some clean cotton balls, a cotton pad, or even a clean rag if you need to, and apply pressure to that wound. Keep firm pressure on it, for as long as it take to stop bleeding, anywhere up to about 30 minutes or so. If you haven't kept constant pressure on it so far, you can't count the time that has gone by yet.    Once the bleeding is stopped or almost stopped, you can put some antibiotic cream on that and put a bandage over it - tightly but not so tight that you cut off circulation.      If you're losing too much blood - like, say a cup or more, and/or it won't stop after a half hour of NON STOP pressure, call a doctor to ask for more advice. You can't get stitches with this sort of wound, though, so it would have to be pretty severe for them to do anythign besides put pressure on it themselves.|`|5pszijaDaa	you should wash your finger or put an antiseptic on it to kill the germs. then using a piece of nonstick gauze or a bandaid or if you don't have those even a tissue (pick something absorbent but thin) push on the cut part of your finger for 10 minutes or until the bleeding stops. this may hurt but it should stop the bleeding. you can take the pressure off when the bleeding stops but be careful removing the gauze so you don't take off the scab. if you want you can just keep the gauze on and put tape over it for a bandage. if it won't stop bleeding after applying pressure go to the emergency room you could have cut a vein or artery that needs medical attention.

And it worked for that...|`|duVTqRM4aa	It will only work if you get a good potent source, and even then it's not going to do the trick for men who have severe ED.   Usually health problems like diabetes cause this problem, otherwise it's psychological.  However, if you want something safe that will increase blood flow to the penis and benefit you if you have other problems here is what i recommend:  http://www.healthproductsusa.net/30_circ...  This stuff has been clinically tested and it does enhance erectile blood flow.    If you're in canada, get it at www.phpure.com
MnCYICRIaa	I haven't but a friend of mine said hers broke on horse back-riding.     I wouldn't recommend doing it yourself but if you want to do it yourself make sure anything inserted is perfectly sanitized and not too hard so you won't hurt yourself. Also maybe use some lubricant so it doesn't hurt so much. I think the safest thing would be to do it with your hands. Wash your hands with an antibacterial and have your nails short.     P.S. Some women have a very flexible hymen and it doesn't break during sex anyway. It just bends. My sisters hymen was intact until she gave birth to her first child even though -obviously- she had sex a lot of times. So if it doesn't break do not push it too hard, you might just be lucky.|`|ZAkfVKgnaa	Its easy and only hurts a lot.|`|OR8hrr0aaa	lol why would you want to onpurpose? thats so weird.|`|OsT64mqMaa	Not on purpose. It almost always happens when you start wearing tampons.|`|OR5PhU40aa	I haven't; I'm afraid of the pain. Super, super afraid. Lol.    If you wear tampons, go horseback riding, etc, then it will probably break eventually.|`|pD329JO2aa	?|`|PnQ6WhTiaa	why would u want to?|`|YwTSzfPIaa	nope... i dont think you can|`|VO5vjLqPaa	it doesnt really hurt. it can happen from using tampons. try masturbating, but using a finger wont work.|`|GMtn5Mxmaa	work on trying to get a full split, it will either break on its own or stretch enough so it won't hurt the first time with a guy
BKqL0mk9aa	um ya thats y its waterproof|`|yFuuvutTaa	Uhhh. it's waterproof for a reason. So yeah you can get it wet.|`|jxmRBPrpaa	obviously, is a water-proof cast, water won't damage it at all, you can take showers without putting a bag on your arm, it will dry. this is its purpose to give the possibility the person who is using it to wet the injured limb.|`|UJxCafYdaa	yeah...you can actually get all casts wet and nothing will happen to it. the only difference between a waterproof cast and a regular cast is the material under the actual cast. in a regular cast its just like this cotton padding stuff so if you get it wet it cant dry so then it smells really bad where as in a water proof cast they use a different material that has a plastic coating on it so it can get wet and it wont smell after a while.
zawlHfvPaa	I think you need to go and see a doctor, it sounds like there's something a lot deeper wrong and maybe you could get better help than you've been given by your family. Hope all gets better.|`|YwQkCMuSaa	I think you should find a hobby or something that you can keep you occupied. I would also find a person (that's not Christian) and talk about how you feel. You should also be active because being active can release hormones that make you feel good.  hope that helps.|`|VqPIjwoZaa	I think your just seeking comfort from something that is different, something that is no ordinary, and in your book Christianity is the total opposite of what you want. I think of you as a caged animal just like me. You want to explore, experience, and live differently than what your current situation permits. as for the uncle I think you are physically attracted to his complexion and maybe his charisma, but I hope you would obviously not try to develop this because it's only going to hurt you. I recommend that you get out, but don't put out. There are good people in this world that just want to love you and give you the world, just return it with love. You are special and unique, trust me. I've also thought of being asexual, but because I think everyone just wants sex and nothing more, especially men. Then again I was raised by women, so maybe this is why I think the way I do. You need to choose whats going to make you happy. Some people will accept you and others wont. I hope you decide what makes you happy in the long run!    send me a message if you ever wanna chat, oh btw I'm not religious, I believe in honesty and trust. :D:D:D;D

xKYXurpNaa	Artificial sweeteners such as equal, nutrasweet and splenda are a very popular way to cut down on sugars.|`|1UID5JtNaa	Your problem sounds a lot like addiction to other substances such as tobacco or alcohol.  That means you have to come to terms with the fact that you are giving sweets up for good- you cannot have just one.     I would take the same approach as tobacco cessation programs - identify triggers, set a quit day, perpare a plan including a quit kit, alternative behaviors, use of rewards, etc.   Once you quit, be ready for cravings with a plan of action- the cravings do disappear.  After a couple of weeks they will be noticeably weaker and easier to beat.      Tobacco is one of  the toughest addictions to beat- see if you can't find a friend who has quit and ask for support.       Positive self-talk is a must- you can do this|`|GfyovDF5aa	Try some sugar free alternatives (they have cookies, candy etc)  Also eat more dark instead of milk chocolate.  If you bake alot, use splenda or stevia (it's marketed as Truvia in  grocery stores) instead of regular sugar.  This should help|`|Q6IGXnYIaa	You have to shift your paradigm.  you said: "i LOVE sweets."  "I ...can't stop."  Change the way you think about them.  Think about all the reasons why you shouldn't eat that stuff.  Imagine it as toxic.  Purge it from your cupboards, pantry & refrigerator. Pledge to go a week, then 10 day then, 2 weeks etc.  Gradually your taste will shift & it will become almost repulsive to you.  I used to drink a lot of soda, chocolate milk & eat sweets.  Now I can't stand the stuff.  1 sip of soda feels like a sugary paste in my mouth.  You can do it.  Whenever a craving strikes...do something else.  10 pushups, squats, jumping jacks...anything.  The point is to break the neural connection.

Don't bother shaving, will come back and you can cut yourself back there unless you have a really really good friend that is willing to do the job right.  Average adult penis size is 5.4 to 6.2 inches, and that accounts for about 76% of all men on the planet. Only 12% are larger than 6.2 inches. Penis size is measured along the top of the erect penis, from the base against the pubic bone to the tip. Measure 3 or 4 times in a week, and of course take the largest measure.  Then add an inch or two for bragging purposes, since most guys lie about penis size, height, and how many times they have had sex.    What other questions do you have?|`|ZAkfVKgnaa	Post a question or yer a ped0bear.

Am average is bad, because an average is a horrible way to tell what you should have because it shows the exact middle of ranges, when there are a plethora of people with bugger or smaller *****. So, they say an average male has 6.2 inches erect, but there are many with larger and smaller sizes. Plus, you are still going through puberty, so it will grow a good amount until you are done with puberty. Yo just need to be happy with your own size (unless it's like the worlds smallest!)    When it comes to women, it is as they say. It is not the size, but the motion of the devotion!

You can search the bands here: http://www.milliondollarbody.com/store/i...

ij5Sv6staa	cement doesn't dry, it cures. Concrete solidifies and hardens after mixing with water and placement due to a chemical process known as hydration. The water reacts with the cement, which bonds the other components together, eventually creating a stone-like material.<br>  Because it is a hydration chemical reaction, the cement is stronger if you keep it moist. Keep it wet by misting it with water every couple hours and cover it with plastic or straw to hold in the moisture.  If it dries out too fast, it will actually start to flake away prematurely. <br>  Depending on the mix, and thickness, it will likely cure fast enough to walk on after about 4-6 hours.

I would cancel dinner just to play it safe.<br>  Tell her something came up and reschedule.|`|O4KBKZEkaa	hi i'm just getting over strep myself. I got it from someone who thought they weren't contagious after 24 hours. My doctor said at least three days or 24 hours after the fever is gone. Hope this helps.|`|Oo9CG8xMaa	normally you are contageous (before) you show symptoms of the illness<br>  they let kids go back to school after being on the med. for 24 hrs.|`|lDSUQyvIaa	If your daughter is still breastfeeding then your daughter is protected still by antibodies produced by your body and should be alright. I would keep an eye and make sure your sister's child isnt putting his mouth on toys, sharing food or drinks, or putting his hands in his mouth then putting them on other things. Strep patients can be contagious up to three days after antibiotic treatments so your sisters pediatrician is incorrect in his estimation of 24 hours. <br>  <br>  If you basically keep an eye on them and make sure your kids arent getting slobbered on or kissed, you should be alright. Even if they do exchange germs, strep is treatable and only dangerous if you DONT treat it. If your children start showing signs of strep in the next week after the dinner (fever, swollen lymph nodes, without a cough) then take them to the doctor.

Don't listen to other people, unless they have put forth as much effort as you have then they have no right to say a word.|`|2KWyz1N7aa	you are doing a lot of exercise, but 1200 calories really isn't enough to fuel you!  Your body may go into starvation mode and you may actually gain weight.  It may also be very hard to keep up with such as restricted diet.<br>  <br>  You're better off to relax on the calorie-counting.  Try for at least 1500 calories or so of the good stuff (fruits, veggies, lean protein, whole grain, etc.).  That should keep your body very happy.  <br>  <br>  Personally, I have found that walking is wonderful for weight loss.  As long as you're going at a good pace (and 4 mph is great!) you'll be getting that heart rate up and that's the key.<br>  <br>  Try to add some resistance exercise (lifting weights, push ups, etc.) a couple times a week, too.  Adding some muscle will help you burn calories, too, since muscle burns more calories while at rest than fat does.  You won't bulk up as a girl, you'll just get toned and will feel great.<br>  <br>  When I eat 1500-2000 cal/day, walk 1-2 hours a day a few times a week, and do resistance training a few times a week, I'll lose about 2 lbs a week.  Everyone is different, but this plan is a good start.<br>  <br>  Good job so far!  I hope this helps you out!|`|uvkgYqiiaa	ull be skinny in due time|`|mFhjKkN5aa	if you keep that up and do it persitantly everyday you could loose either 2 ibs or more a week. But it also depends on your metabolism because you could have a fast metabolism and loose weight rapidly but just keep it up and it should be gone in no time|`|c6d893d57a1887972e7784c74e1d4f40aa	I believe that you will lose weight. Check your scale each week and it should go down. Once you hit a plateau or weight loss begins to slow down, you will need to incorporate weight lifting in order to continue losing weight. Keep up the good work!!!

pUpUkX14aa	Interval training is the optimum method but if you don't have a workout dvd with that type of routine then I would recommend doing the anaerobic first.<br>  <br>  Doing the anaerobic first will help you to burn off the extra sugars stored in the muscles then following that up with aerobic should help you to burn more fat.<br>  <br>  Like I said though interval training is much more effective.  Here's an ehow article that you can read that may help you figure out a way to add it to your workouts.|`|1dL6fU0Haa	When you perform anaerobic exercises, the body mainly feeds off energy stored within the muscles (glycogen=stored sugars or carbohydrates). On the other hand, aerobic work will rely mostly on fats for fuel as well as some carbohydrates depending on the intensity of work.  <br>  <br>  So to maximize your performance it is important to have your muscles fully saturated with sugar and performing aerobic first would deplete that storage slightly.  <br>  <br>  Also, by performing your aerobic after the anaerobic training enables the body to rely on your fats as fuel to a greater percentage  since most of the stored carbohydrates have been depleted.|`|IeLBIACaaa	it is better to do any weight training before your cardio thats for sure.  <br>  Dont forget to loosen up first tho.|`|wDtA9hrhaa	I prefer aerobic first, b/c your endorphines will be running making you have more energy to get the fullest out of your strength training portion.|`|Ma1RTmLGaa	aerobic would probably be better first as you will be using energy at a slower rate than anaerobic. Basically your body has time to keep up when you are carrying out aerobic exercise but with anaerobic you will have a longer recovery time as your body needs to regain lost oxygen.

Vp1Wzu07aa	You need to limit your diet to things that can be digested easily. Also, if you run the risk of vomiting you want something that can come up easily, just in case.<br>  <br>  I would suggest applesauce or toast lightly buttered, any soup that has a clear broth and not alot of chunky stuff in it. You can also try just some plain crackers. <br>  <br>  The point is you want just enough in your stomach that you are not starving...an appetite at this point shows you are starting to feel better but you don't want to overload your body when it needs it's strength to fight off the sickness.<br>  <br>  It is far more important at this stage that you stay well hydrated.|`|858a0632fe3d77a7fe9bf558aaa8a346aa	Saltine crackers, pretzels, baked potato, hmmmm...  Chicken noodle soup, rice, Plain pasta.  This is the stuff I go for when my tummy's out of whack.
sOO93u5Oaa	When you are vomiting or have diarrhea, it is good to keep your child hydrated, because they are losing a lot of fluids. You can give them Pedia-lite, or Gatorade. Gatorade might have too much sugar though, but it is good, because it restores electrolytes that your body is losing. That may help. Make sure they rest, too. If diarrhea does not stop, please bring them to the doctor.|`|Oo9CG8xMaa	B.R.A.T. diet...<br>  banana<br>  rice<br>  applesauce<br>  toast<br>  sounds wierd but recommended by doctors

FVzURSU5aa	I have a band since 2001 and am also an operating room RN and care for patients who have them.<br>  <br>  LapBands have been used in Australia for a long time (much longer than in the USA) and are now considered a viable option for treatment of moderate and morbid obesity (espeecially when there is a co-morbidity eg, diabetes, bad knees, asthma etc).  It is really a very safe operation and much safer than larger gastric bypass operations.<br>  <br>  Some of the danger relates to the size of the patient undergoing the operation.  We band people who are really very heavy (>400lb recently) and of course these people ma have more complications with their recovery (clots, chest infections, wound infections) due to their size.<br>  <br>  I have never seen a dealth from a lapband in my hospital. The surgeon has performed hundreds (probably thousands).  They usually take around 1.5 - -3 hours depending on how tricky the patients anatomy is.  Patients are usually quite drowsy when they wake and have some pain (mostly minor pain) which is dealt with in the recovery room. On the second day you have an xray with dye to determine if anything can get through the band and then you start on sips of clear fluid.   If this goes well you are usually home by day 2-3.<br>  <br>  For me it has been wonderful - I also have around 5 friends with it who it has been great too.  One friend did have complications (herniated due to excessive vomiting) and had to have it replaced.  I have had to have the port replaced after 6 years as it started leaking.<br>  <br>  I was not morbidly obese either and you do have to diet.  It is not a miracle but it helps alot.<br>  <br>  Goodluck|`|553SJaxRaa	I had it done may 11, 2007 I had complications due to the sutures coming undone and twisting my port.

I have lost 30lbs since i have started my adventure to a healthier lifestyle. I am eating healthier & its really helps mentally too. I love it. I would do it over again if i had the chance. I am 5'6 and weighed 228 right before surgery. I am not huge but i am unhealthy. I am really excited about it all|`|LC8QdMzyaa	Weight loss surgery-like lap band surgery have become very common and very safe now. My cousin got her Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery in India. She has lost more than 65 lbs in 5 months and is very happy with the results. The price for obesity surgery is very less in India. My cousin just paid 25% of the cost she was quoted in America. She got her surgery from a company called Forerunners Healthcare.<br>  <br>  Forerunners Healthcare is very famous in India. I read a lot about them in the Newspapers and magazines. I have read a lot of their patient stories also. They arrange financing for USA, Canadian, UK and other international patients who plan to have surgery abroad for low cost, as Bariatric surgery and weight loss surgery is not covered by insurance. They also have photos pasted of their International patients. You can checkout their website. There are huge cost savings. As a doctor I personally believe that your Obesity surgery can be easily handled in India, as the quality of healthcare available In India is simply best in the world. The surgeons are USA/UK trained and facilities are 5 star.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.forerunnershealthcare.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.forerunnershealthcare.com</a><br>  Hope this helps

ZjhQ6PL8aa	You'd be correct it's A.<br>  <br>  Here's a cut and paste of how it works.  <br>  <br>  Arterial (high pressure) baroreceptors<br>  <br>  Arterial baroreceptors present in the aortic arch and the carotid sinuses of the left and right internal carotid arteries. The baroreceptors found within the aortic arch enables the examination of the blood being delivered to all the blood vessels via the systemic circuit, and the baroreceptors within the carotid arteries monitor the blood pressure of the blood being delivered to the brain[6].<br>  <br>  Arterial baroreceptors are stimulated by pressure changes in the arteries. The baroreceptors can identify the changes in the blood pressure which can increase or decrease the heart rate. They are sprayed nerve endings that lie in the tunica adventitia of the artery, not drug-binding molecules as the term 'receptor' may suggest. A change in the mean arterial pressure induces depolarisation of these sensory endings which results in action potentials. These action potentials are conducted to the central nervous system by axons and have a direct effect on the cardiovascular system through autonomic neurons[7]. Hormone secretions which target the heart and blood vessels are affected by the stimulaton of baroreceptors.<br>  <br>  If blood pressure falls, such as in hypovolaemic shock, baroreceptor firing rate decreases. Signals from the carotid baroreceptors are sent via the glossopharyngeal nerve (cranial nerve IX). Signals from the aortic baroreceptors travel through the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X)[8]. If the arterial pressure is severely lowered, the baroreflex is activated[9].<br>  <br>  Baroreceptors respond very quickly to maintain a stable blood pressure, but they only respond to short term changes. Over a period of 1-2 days they will reset to a new value[10]. Thus, in people with essential hypertension the baroreceptors behave as if the elevated blood pressure is normal and aim to maintain this high blood pressure. The receptors then become less sensitive to change[11].|`|nucluBJxaa	<a href="http://health-s.synthasite.com/?q=blood%20pressure" rel="nofollow">http://health-s.synthasite.com/?q=blood%...</a>

To answer your question more generally it helps to work out the accessory muscles around the joint not just the large muscle groups that machines work out.<br>  <br>  The accessory muscles are smaller muscles used for stabilization and will typically help you to define a muscle group.

Q4ggnG0waa	Vitamin B12 is one of the very most important nutrients we get from animal foods.<br>  Vitamin B12 is a compound that is red in color because of the presence of cobalt.<br>  Absorption of Vitamin B12 is a complex process which can be problematic for many.<br>  For it to be absorbed effectively, B12 attaches to a protein known as intrinsic factor which is secreted in the stomach. Vitamin B12 binds with intrinsic factor and travels through to the small intestines.<br>  Once in the bloodstream, B12 binds to transport proteins. Enzymes release B12 from the protein complex and convert it to two forms- methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin. Deficiency in the enzymes can stop this conversion. Because there are so many potential blocks in the absorption process many people develop Vitamin B12 deficiencies even though they get plenty of Vitamin B12 in their diet.

There may be antibodies in the blood but it is not blood bourne, ie the blood doesn't spread the virus to other parts of the body.<br>  <br>  The virus can only be transmitted by close personal contact such as kissing. Most people will have come into contact with the virus between the ages of three and five but will not show any symptoms until after puberty.<br>  HSV invades the cells of the epidermis, the outer layer of the skin, causing fluid-filled blisters to appear. The virus travels from the epidermis along the nerve paths to the roots of the nerves where it becomes inactive.<br>  Approximately 80 per cent of the adult population have antibodies against HSV-1 in their blood.|`|sOO93u5Oaa	When you say coldsore virus, I'm assuming you mean herpes.

9cQlQo86aa	As long as they're 21 days apart, all is well. Anything closer than that go to your gyno.|`|AA12385489	How long have you been menstruating?  If you're just starting in your first year:<br>  For some months it is possible to get your period twice if your cycle is 28 days long.  The days of your cycle can overlap during some calendar months and can result with having two periods in one month.  That's normal, but not for every month.<br>  <br>  For example, In August my period will be the week of August 5th. September I will be having two periods in the month.  One on the week of September 2nd and one during the week of September 30th.  And again the week of October 28th.<br>  <br>  If you have been menstruating for over a year and this has never happened before, two menstrual cycles in one month are usually caused by you ovulating twice.  (That has happened to me too.)|`|I4I1xfTmaa	if you got your period withen the last year then yes but other wise i guess it could be normal or a problem.|`|MerBRnZkaa	Actually sometimes you can get your menstrual cycle twice in a month if it's about to switch over. Like when it use to come in the beginning of the month and it came on again so next month you might not have one but in September you'll most likely get it at the end of the month. Mine does that sometimes. Sometimes it's a good thing when you have events coming up and your menstruation is due to come on it can really mess up your plans.|`|Slj3xXqOaa	This is the first month i have alsodone this...and my friend at work too.

QEfd4xIWaa	If it hurts to walk on there is something you can get at the drug store called moleskin, which is this really soft fabric and it is adhesive on one side. You cut a hole in the moleskin big enough to fit around your blister and then add another layer of moleskin on top of that, with a hole in it too, and do the same until you have built up moleskin around the blister. Then you can walk on it without so much pain because the moleskin taking the pressure off of the blister when you walk. EDIT I don't think you should pop it. So long as you don't pop it it stays sterile and free from infection.|`|GjZRzfeuaa	If It's red, it's a Blood Blister! If it is bothering you a lot, get it checked out by a Doc! Good Luck!!!

You could keep trying to pop and disinfect it, but that might hurt more and could get infected anyway.  Either way, covering it with a thick bandage and wearing thick socks should help.

If it continues and heart goes into tachycardia then of course, this can be dangerous.  However, since you are on cardiac meds you need to be a little bit more concerned than usual.  Perhaps a trip to the hospital would be a good idea, even if just to monitor you for a while, and if nothing is seriously wrong, at least you will have peace of mind till you see your doctor.  If need be, they will give you some meds to help you.  Good Luck.

J3ijZxYGaa	Are you having issues with depression? anxiety? acid reflux? an ulcer?  Try some cannabis, or maybe some pepcid. Maybe just try eating some better tasting food too. Are you worried about your weight? I only bring that up because you mention calories. Are you losing weight? Are you actually vomiting?  Try thinking about other things while you are eating, or eat very slowly? It's hard to understand exactly why you feel like vomiting with such little info. If it's just nausea I'd see a doctor but try something like pepcid (or cannabis, I highly recommend this).
AA11468064	Good Luck in YOUR education. What ever end of the field you work with..Smiles <br>  <br>  Certified Colon Hydrotherapist<br>  Typically, colonic hydrotherapy schools offer basic and advanced courses in the cleansing and detoxifying of the colon. In addition to classroom studies, students enrolled in colonic hydrotherapy schools will gain practical training in colon hydrotherapy by I-ACT certified instructors.<br>  <br>  Students enrolled in colonic hydrotherapy schools will learn that colonic hydrotherapy is a method of cleansing and detoxifying the colon through gentle infusions of purified water, which allows the entire colon tract to be cleansed, eliminating toxic buildup, wastes and bacteria. <br>  <br>  Training at colonic hydrotherapy schools consists of lessons in digestive system review, colon hydrotherapy procedures, health and hygiene, maintenance and sanitation of equipment, client communications and general business practices. Because it does not integrate chemicals or drugs, colonic hydrotherapy is becoming a preferred method to naturally detoxify the colon; which improves overall digestive processes.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, students in colonic hydrotherapy schools will gain a comprehensive overview and understanding of the FDA Registered medical device, called LIBBE (Lower Intestine Bottom Bowel Evacuation System). This medical equipment is especially designed to be used as an evacuation system, and is used for the administration of colonic irrigation.<br>  <br>  In general, students who have completed training through one of several colonic hydrotherapy schools can become eligible for I-ACT Testing for Levels I, II and III certifications. Bear in mind, however, that I-ACT Level III is primarily reserved for students who are pursuing advanced instruction and Instructor certification. <br>    <br>  Kind Regard, S|`|g9c6s22Aaa	Generally the RN will do it before whatever procedure is about to take place.

This is the warm-up act - the dress rehearsal. God wants us to practice on earth what we will do forever in eternity. <br>  <br>  We were made by God and for God, and until you figure that out, life isn't going to make sense. <br>  <br>  Life is a series of problems: Either you are in one now, you're just coming out of one, or you're getting ready to go into another one.

kkpcnkNgaa	Trojan condoms have the American market dominated. <br>  Their latex tends to be thicker than most other brands, which reduces the sensation for both the male and the female and some people even find them uncomfortable. <br>  Also, condoms are kinda like shoes, every brand uses a different mold for their condoms which creates some variability in the comfort level between users. <br>  I would suggest trying other brands of condoms as well to see what you and your partner find most enjoyable. <br>  Locally, you can probably find a selection of other brands of condoms at an adult or lingerie store (the grocery store is probably only going to have Trojan, Durex, and Lifestyles). And there is a very large selection at ozonecondoms.com.|`|9zxu5oPAaa	yep|`|EaWSM4Oraa	their the only ones i like and use|`|ufUDAGC7aa	um...sure
