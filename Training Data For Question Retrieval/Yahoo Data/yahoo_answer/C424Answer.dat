AA11966821	Minimum drop for a tablecloth is 12" all around, which means a minimum of 10 feet (120 inches) for the 8' table, and 8' minimum (96 inches) for the 6' table.  A drop of 2/3 of the way from table top to floor is awkward sizing and looks funny, but you'd need tablecloths of 12 feet (144") and 10 feet (120").|`|V9cZLXTwaa	Tables are about 30 inches high so 70 inches wide by 136 for 8' and 112 for 6 ft. but these are not standard since typically the tablecloth only goes to the top of the chairs (60 x 120 for 8' or 60 x 96 for 6' ) or all the way to the floor (90x156 for 8 or 90x132 for 6') <br>  If you own the tables you can have it made to order. If you are renting for a one time event rent multiple 60x60 or 90x90s as its far easier to adjust through overlap to the desired length.

7Cf6fN2laa	Liebe Anais, die Wohnung ist toll, deshalb: hab Geduld, es wird sich schon jemand finden. Es ist oft so, zuerst will gar keiner einziehen, dann streiten sich pl?tzlich mehrere Traummieter. <br>  <br>  Ich will noch zu den Vorschl?gen der anderen (die du befolgen solltest) das, was ich denke, hinzufügen. Das Klientel für so eine Wohnung ist begrenzt. Ein normal verdienender Single kann sich die Wohnung leider nicht leisten, er nimmt sich eine kleinere 2 Zi Wohnung. Besser verdienende Singles wollen meist 3 Zimmer (ein Arbeits/G?stezi). Besser verdienende Singles die mit 2 Zimmern zufrieden sind, wollen mitten in die Stadt. Ja und für Paare gilt im Prinzip das Gleiche, nur wollen die erst recht mehr Zimmer.... Ich bin aber sicher, dass ihr jemanden findet, nur Geduld!|`|5794f6604dd05a462101219acb09ad86aa	Zuviel Schr?ge.

H?ufiger Mieterwechsel bedeutet h?ufigen Mietausfall (wenn die Wohnung gerade leer steht), h?ufige Renovierungskosten (vor jedem neuen Mieter) und ?rger. Lieber die Miete etwas günstiger und dafür langfristige Mieter, die gerne und glücklich da wohnen.<br>  <br>  2) Aufpassen wegen "Mietnomaden", also Leuten, die die Miete nicht zahlen und so lange wohnen, bis es gelingt, sie rauszuschmei?en. Da lohnt es sich, beim vorigen vVermieter nachzufragen. Noch besser ist es, wenn man die Mieter und ihr Umfeld kennt. Es gibt m?glicherweise Listen oder Agenturen, wo man unbekannte Mieter überprüfen kann. Evtl. sollte man Gehaltsnachweise fordern oder schauen, wo die Mieter arbeiten (sie würden nicht gerne am Arbeitsplatz als schlechte Mieter bekannt sein).<br>  <br>  3) Familien mit Kindern sind vielleicht nervig, aber sollten gef?rdert werden.

15f7bbb87024d0b49e39460b99edc959aa	Are you referring to pegging?<br>  <br>  Pegging Roses<br>  <br>  One method of training roses that has been nearly forgotten is called pegging. A rose suitable for pegging will have long flexible canes about 5 to 7 foot long. A number of Bourbons and Hybrid Perpetuals, as Peter Beales agrees, are “almost custom-built for this purpose.” Climbing roses that reach over 7 feet are not good for pegging, because they quickly grow out of bounds and become unattractive . To peg a rose, fasten the canes to the ground by pinning them with a hook, or “peg”. It is important to remember to let new canes harden properly before they are bent down and pegged no matter how unruly they may look; otherwise they may break. We peg our roses twice a year, before the onset of new growth (for us it is late January and late August). We use the long 6 to 7 foot canes that have grown in the prior season. Older canes can be pruned away every second or third year to make room for these newly pegged canes. The canes can be left with a high arch or fastened nearly horizontal, arranged in a perfect wheel around the center of the plant or swirled slightly depending on artistic desire and available space. There are a number of creative ways to use this method, but the end result is basically the same. Pulling the canes horizontal causes the rose to produce flowers at nearly every leaf axil, increasing the blooming potential a hundredfold. A pegged rose is generally used as a specimen plant and takes up quite a bit of space, but the incredible floral display and unique shape make it quite worthwhile to try the technique.|`|6f7775a42a70e16a8c3c67ba4993bf71aa	I think you need to explain your Question better, I have no idea what you are asking??|`|713be26b8eeb3c76d90e53c1b0e01edeaa	I would go to www.traderoutesnw.com and pick out a trellis or arbor that will help

The plant grows, the flowers bloom for a period of time, and then they wither away.  When the flowers die, the plant will remain there until the winter kicks in.  When the plant itself browns and dies, pull out the remaining stem as it is detached from the flower bulb already to regrow next year bigger and better.
cXRzO28Raa	Purtroppo no...<br>  In realtà nessuno dell'ufficio registro viene a controllare se hai un contratto d'affitto o no..<br>  Ma se con il tempo sorgono problemi con gli inquilini allora potrebbero crearsi problemi abbastanza seri...<br>  Detto un pò meglio:<br>  Quando compri una casa come prima casa devi obbligatoriamente avere la residenza lì; per avere la residenza dovrai abitarci ed aspettare che vengano i vigili a controllare se effettivamente ci abiti, da quel giorno avrai la residenza (per avere informazioni più precise devi recarti nel comune dove è situata la tua "prima casa" e chiedere).<br>  Sulla prima casa non possono nascere contratti di locazione se non dopo 5 anni dall'acquisto di quest'ultima.<br>  In oltre in questi 5 anni non puoi nemmeno venderla.<br>  Io ti consiglio di aspettare i 5 anni prima di dare la casa in locazione, onde evitare di rischiare di incorrere in grosse spese.|`|147ed94106052170343e7433fdd4d257aa	Sono ormai diversi anni che è stato abrogato il comma che richiedeva di "adibire ad abitazione principale" l'immobile acquistato con le agevolazioni "prima casa". Questo significa che posso acquistare una "prima casa", avendone i requisiti, e non andarci ad abitare (posso, ad esempio, affittarla). La residenza, però, devo già averla o spostarla entro 18 mesi nello stesso COMUNE della "prima casa" acquistata (quindi va bene anche se la "prima casa" è in Milano, via Verdi e io sono o sarò residente a Milano, via Rossi). Spero essere stata chiara. Baci|`|1N8hVwgLaa	Sì puoi affittarla ma devi comunque cambiare la tua residenza perchè le regole delle agevolazioni sono queste:<br>  Nel caso di acquisto della "prima casa" sono previste una serie di agevolazioni: <br>  - l'imposta di registro, o in alternativa l'Iva, si paga con aliquota ridotta, <br>  - le imposte ipotecarie e catastali sono dovute in misura fissa. <br>  <br>  Per fruire delle agevolazioni prima casa non è necessario che l'immobile acquistato sia destinato ad abitazione propria e/o dei familiari. <br>  <br>  I requisiti necessari per fruire delle agevolazioni prima casa riguardano: <br>  a. La natura dell'immobile acquistato<br>  Le agevolazioni interessano solo i trasferimenti di case di abitazione "non di lusso". <br>  Le abitazioni non di lusso sono quelle non aventi le caratteristiche indicate nel Decreto Ministeriale 2.8.69 (che considera abitazioni di lusso, ad esempio, quelle dotate di piscina di almeno 80 mq di superficie, o di campi da tennis con sottofondo drenato di superficie non inferiore a 650 mq.). <br>  b. L'ubicazione dell'immobile acquistato <br>  L'immobile deve essere ubicato: <br>  - nel comune di residenza dell'acquirente <br>  - nel comune in cui, entro 18 mesi (termine elevato da 12 a 18 mesi dall'1/1/2001) l'acquirente stabilirà la propria residenza - nel comune in cui l'acquirente svolge la propria attività, se diverso da quello di Residenza <br>  - nel comune in cui ha sede o esercita l'attività il datore di lavoro da cui dipende l'acquirente che si sia trasferito all'estero per motivi di lavoro <br>  - nel caso in cui l'acquirente sia un cittadino italiano residente all'estero (iscritto all'AIRE) l'immobile può essere acquistato come prima casa in qualsiasi comune del territorio italiano <br>  c. Le dichiarazioni che l'acquirente deve fare <br>  Nell'atto di compravendita l'acquirente deve dichiarare: <br>  - di non essere titolare, esclusivo o in comunione col coniuge, di diritti di proprietà, usufrutto, uso e abitazione di altra casa di abitazione nel territorio del comune dove si trova l'immobile oggetto dell'acquisto agevolato; <br>  - di non essere titolare, neppure per quote o in comunione legale, su tutto il territorio nazionale, di diritti di proprietà, uso usufrutto abitazione o nuda proprietà, su altra casa di abitazione, acquistata, anche dal coniuge, usufruendo delle agevolazioni per l'acquisto della prima casa; <br>  - qualora non risieda già nel comune dove è situato l'immobile oggetto dell'acquisto, deve altresì impegnarsi a stabilire la residenza entro 18 mesi. Per il personale delle Forze armate e delle Forze di polizia non è richiesta la condizione della residenza nel comune dove si trova l'unità abitativa acquistata con le agevolazioni "prima casa". <br>  Perdita delle agevolazioni prima casa<br>  L'acquirente decade dalle agevolazioni prima casa quando: <br>  - le dichiarazioni previste dalla legge nell'atto di acquisto siano false; <br>  - non trasferisce entro 18 mesi la residenza nel comune in cui è situato l'immobile oggetto dell'acquisto; <br>  - vende o dona l'abitazione prima che sia decorso il termine di 5 anni dalla data di acquisto, a meno che entro un anno non proceda al riacquisto di un altro immobile da adibire a propria abitazione principale. <br>  La decadenza dall'agevolazione comporta il recupero dell'imposta nella misura ordinaria (al netto di quanto già corrisposto) nonché l'applicazione di una sanzione pari al 30% dell'imposta, oltre gli interessi di mora. <br>  <br>  Azioni di controllo e verifica degli uffici dell'Agenzia delle Entrate<br>  L'azione di verifica relativa alla sussistenza dei requisiti "prima casa" può essere effettuata dall'Ufficio delle Entrate territorialmente competente entro il termine massimo di tre anni. <br>  In relazione alle diverse ipotesi di decadenza dalle agevolazioni prima casa varia il momento di decorrenza del termine triennale: <br>  - Mendacità delle dichiarazioni rilasciate nell'atto di acquisto<br>  Entro tre anni dalla registrazione dell'atto di compravendita <br>  - Mancato trasferimento di residenza entro diciotto mesi dalla stipula dell'atto<br>  Entro quattro anni e mezzo (tre anni più diciotto mesi) <br>  dalla registrazione dell'atto. <br>  - Vendita della casa prima di cinque anni senza riacquisto entro un anno<br>  Entro quattro anni dalla vendita della casa acquistata con i benefici (tre anni dallo spirare del termine di un anno entro il quale doveva effettuarsi il riacquisto).|`|5tMDLnp8aa	non credo ci siano problemi (forse dovrai invertire le residenze, dipende dal contratto)|`|TUZ6pJQtaa	Sono agente immobiliare, dipende il contratto come è stato registrato!!!!|`|eb63d467157aa7c93c6e837c5357f6cbaa	Beh, se tu sposti la tua residenza da un'altra parte e fai un contratto di affitto regolare...non ci sono problemi!!
g7uMKvEzaa	WOW,,, are you my daughter????<br>  <br>  Actually, I have the same problem but I am the mom here...My daughter and husband always bugging me to get rid of my clutter...I like my stuff and I would be very upset if they called clean house...I just might move out for good if they ever did that!!!! I know for a fact  ... It is an addiction or more or less a sickness that is sometimes heredity...My dad and my grandmother did the same thing...I help my dad and I think I am the only one that can...I just organise his stuff an put it in boxes nice and neat with his permission of course.. ( and he knows I won't throw out anything unless it is totally useless and a health hazard for some reason  and even than he has to ok it with my help)....By helping him and seeing how much he is out of tune with others ,I see myself...<br>  I really was out of control and learned to stop shopping.. I think that is why we are in a recession now ,LOL !<br>  I actually had to PRAY because I didn't know what to do about it and I knew it was bothering others...I got better in the last 2 yrs about putting everything on the 3rd floor out of the way...I had my stuff and it wasn't in others way....I would suggest letting her have a special room to put her stuff in and not in any  everyday living space.. I still have lots in my closets etc but nobody can see it with the door closed...I am gradually getting it under control ... I started volunteering and I saw how many people were in need and I find myself giving lots away ...I have had yard sales with things that I know I will never use or get around to using anymore...I actually made lots of money and I can't even remember what I sold...There was so much stuff I didn't even price it . I told people it was lets make a deal and they named a price and I almost always said ok...I figured I won't miss it and they wanted it...I made lots of friends that day...Made me feel good. and my house has less junk in it... I plan on doing it again this yr.<br>  <br>  The condition is called hording,,,look it up on computer. I was told to by my sister and she offered to help me.. I need to do it myself but she helped sort it with me one day.. That was a help.. We didn't throw anything away , just started getting ready for another Yard Sale. I recently bought a CD on how to use EBAY...for. The things too good for yard sale... antiques and paintings .<br>  <br>  It took me yrs to get in this mood, but I had to think about it.I didn't want my kids to have to deal with it all if something happened to me.. I am doing it more for them than myself. I still have lots to do and should be at it now...<br>  My husband promised to redo  the bedrooms totally with new carpet, paint , curtains etc if I clean it out... I did but now its all packed in boxes in a spare bedroom on the 3rd floor out of the way... Each day I do a few boxes at a time and the Salvation Army is going to have a field day...I can write it off and my husband is giving me the saving to buy new things I want for the new room or vacation....It is incentive..<br>  <br>  <br>  I think the BEST THING TO DO ,,IS NOT NAG,,,talk to her and DO ONE BOX at a time and PROMISE you won't throw anything out, or give it away,Let her do that and the best thing is to PRAY!!!!!! that was how I got started..<br>  <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!!  let me know how it goes...If she isn't ready ...just help her reorginize in nice boxes and put them in the basement or a closet..She will be upset if you NAG her. Believe me ,,,the horders know they have to do it,,but they find it hard and sometimes impossible.|`|nOVSf06Raa	get a lot of boxes and fill them up labelling their contents and empty the room completely  and start fresh , tell your mom to select the things that she needs and to give the rest away to a shelter  .

yHI6rfeUaa	You can patch the existing if you remove and clean all loose plaster first and the lath is intact.  <br>  <br>  You can cut out the loose, remove lath, and install dry wall as well.  Watch the depth issue as you want the finished job to look smooth.<br>  <br>  Finish off by smooth sanding, priming, painting.<br>  <br>  You want to know whether drywall will work - it will and so will patch plastering.<br>  <br>  The real question is which is easier to do.  If the crack is big, meaning long,  but not very wide, I would seriously consider patching.  If it is very wide drywall may be better.  If it is somewhere in between, you may want to use a plaster filler first as an under filler; it usually has fiber (hair like material) in it to interlock to the lath and bridge between the fixed plaster.  This material is allowed to dry a few days, and then finish plaster topping is added to the now intact under filler plaster.<br>  <br>  Either will work.  You see the damage.  You can predict the work level needed either way.  Now you have to decide which is best.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|a7758985bc328f86aea63a86e0cd5cfdaa	Works fine.<br>  Would screw the patch in place though  (nails will bounce on wood lath) & catch as much lath as possible if studs are not in reach.<br>  Thickness is sometimes a problem .<br>  Get as close as you can w/ patch then shim from behind or if really close ,skim to same level then tape as usual. <br>  Best regards|`|85932f18f518634b869005ec7eb29e14aa	That will work, but you might be able to fill the biggest hole with plaster patch if you put it on in several layers. Put on a little and let it dry well before adding the next coat. Will take a few days, but should work.|`|e685416e5feb3fff30918d919b216b83aa	flee.....<br>  try this...mix elmer's white glue with baking soda....mix thoroughly.  Fill this into the areas that need to be filled. Used in the cracks, the holding power is also better that plaster or drywall filler.|`|NqWl2qlPaa	Sheetrock is sheetrock, plaster is not sheetrock, plaster is not sheetrock mud either, plaster is a substance all it's own. It's easily picked up at hobby shops,  First start by prepping the hole.  To do this you need to use your fingers or a putty knife to knock off any loose edges, take plaster powder and mix it up to a very dry consistency, using just enough water to wet it slightly.  Take a small putty knife and force the plaster through the lathe, using small amounts at a time.  Once you have the plaster going through the lathe, let it dry, but leave the hole slightly unfilled. (For example, you need to not fill it all the way , leave it sunk in a little to leave room to fill in cracks once the first coat dries, because of shrinkage. You need to fill the depth of the hole one third at a time.)  It is a multi-step process. If smooth surface, you need to sand it once it's dry, prime it then paint it.  If a textured surface, you need to try to copy the texture, soft wet sponges are good  for small peaks and dimples, while wet fingertips will work for bigger textures.|`|8a719441d739d9411f7c186796d5fd5aaa	Its cool.  Because you don't want a thick amount of patching material for the total patch. After you nail your piece of drywall in your hole and mud it, let it dry, sand and then mud smooth, sand again. If you have textured walls get a small can of texture to match your walls.|`|944iJNAdaa	I think if you have lath and plaster here, you are dealing with a house and materials older than anyone of us reading this.  Since I've only worked on drywall my entire life, this job would seem easiest to just put fiberglass tape over the cracked areas, and feather it out with drywall mud, just like any other drywall seam, and the same with that little 2" x 2" chunk.  Sure, it would take a few coats, but I bet it would come out fine, and with todays modern materials that most of us know how to use skillfully.  You can give me thumbs down if I'm wrong.  :)|`|pZ9eA5rYaa	If it's lath and plaster you don't cut a chunk out. Fill it with plaster. A lot of these people at these building centers don't know squat. You might want to dig some of it out in the crack so you have better adhesion.

unBDeZ8Caa	I always buy Impatients,which are already in bloom.They come in different colors.As they grow more they spread out and look beautiful.Last all summer and into fall.Last year I just got the red and white.Looked so nice as that is the color of our Canada flag.But the choice in color is up to you if you decide to buy them.<br>  Also bought a tin of wildflower seeds.It takes about a month for them to start growing.But they are worth waiting for.All different kinds and colors.Beautiful flowers.(all you do is sprinkle the seeds and water them) Enjoy your garden.|`|zxhCy80eaa	And don't forget Hyacinths! They smell heavenly and come back every year.<br>  I love to check out the garden section in Wal-Mart and Home Depot or Lowe's to get plants that already have some blooms or are just about to bloom and go ahead and stick them in the ground.<br>   I have a star jasmine vine also that grew 4 times it's size in one year that's about to open full of highly fragrant blooms.|`|vHFaHzdeaa	"Lilly of the vally" are my favorite, they come up every year and smell great! "Bleeding hearts" are deathly beautiful, they also come up every year. The flowers I would say best would be "snapdragons" "hollyhocks" "dasies" "merrygolds" "sweetpeas" "roses" "baby blue eyes" "bachlor buttens" and I always loved getting those wild flower packets, just dump those every where.|`|jRZmU5JUaa	You can grow just about anything in spring time. That's the best time to start growing your plants and flowers. One of my Personal Favorites are the Sun Flowers.

You can pick some up at your local grocery store. Also if you start some other plants you like indoors right now they will be flowering a little earlier.
deAyKj2Uaa	frame, headboard, footboard (only if desired), boxspring and mattress. you will know the difference between the box spring and mattress.  you would never dream of laying of the boxspring, it is hard and has no cushion.  then there is the mattress.  most now days are pillow top, there is an extra layer on stop that is super cozy.  hope this helps.
AA10097817	If there's any residue after the ice, try putting a brown paper bag over the wax. Take a warm iron, not hot, and press over the bag. The residue should be picked up by the brown paper. You can remove any red dye with some rubbing alcohol.|`|1LTpPosAaa	I haven't tried it, but I seem to recall someone saying that if you put the item in really hot water, the wax will melt and float to the top, like oil.

zzl5HcVFaa	Start now getting ground ready the way I tell when to go ahead and plant is when the nut trees start to bud out. I can look off my porch now and see that some of the hard wood trees are getting leafs on them or they are in full bloom. Grass is starting to grow and spring is in the air in south east Texas. I even saw a red bud in bloom this morning. The black walnut tree beside my house looks dead not a soft tip no where. When it starts to look like it is budding out I plant. The hickory nut tree in my pasture is the same way. I noticed a big pecan tree down town the same. The frost is not gone till the nut trees start to come out when they get soft green tender tips like soon there will be leaves I plant. You can't fool them. This is just the way I do it but I have never been hit by a late frost.|`|AA10108322	You can plant your garden whenever the last frost is past.  I just started my Hollyhocks indoors a couple weeks back and so I'll transplant them outside as soon as that dreaded frost has past.   But you can start preparing your soil now by checking the pH balance and adding fertilizer or compost to make it ready for little seedlings.  <br>  <br>  That's awesome that you have tulips, btw!  I'm still waiting for mine! : )|`|0qTv9YbHaa	i live in Ny and i dont start nothing outside untill memorial day that is the best way for me to tell when to start gardening|`|4cd2bb45d74c59a869d474f2c32006e2aa	the weather is back and forth all over the nation lol...friggn azelia's bloomn now and a freeze was two nights ago...fla doesnt warm up enuf for plantn for another 2 weeks|`|wOgRvSQJaa	I live in the Muskogee area and I always plant my first veggies around the eleventh of April.  These are transplants like tomatoes, squash, peppers, cukes,etc. Most seeds will be okay to plant at this time also.|`|de72fa747bd877831a656fc97e91fc1baa	when all danger of frost is gone and the soil can be worked without having big clumps of soggy dirt.|`|AA10648704	It's a good idea to check an almanac to see what dates for different vegetables are best.  For example, here in Indiana we could already plant peas, but tomatoes are not until May 1 or so.  The almanac will show which vegetables are to be planted in relation to your last freeze date, and may show which date is the correct one for your zone (even your seed packets will show what zone you're in).  Another way to check, once you know your last freeze date, is to go to heirlooms.com--they have a chart that shows which vegetables should be planted and when in relation to the last freeze date.
58cfb3933858f1cc29cad9e0a4f9ad95aa	Another easy natural thing you can use is vinegar water.  Get a spray bottle, put a little bit of vinegary in it and fill it the rest of the way with water.  Then spray it on your kitchen counters and other places that you particularly do NOT want to have ants.  Ants don't like vinegar so they'll stay away completely and vinegar won't hurt your kitties either :)|`|lH2x3gn3aa	Keep a small spray bottle handy, and spray the ants with a bit of soapy water.<br>  Set out cucumber peels or slices in the kitchen or at the ants' point of entry. Many ants have a natural aversion to cucumber. Bitter cucumbers work best.<br>  Leave a few tea bags of mint tea near areas where the ants seem most active. Dry, crushed mint leaves or cloves also work as ant deterrents.<br>  Trace the ant column back to their point of entry. Set any of the following items at the entry area in a small line, which ants will not cross: cayenne pepper, citrus oil (can be soaked into a piece of string), lemon juice, cinnamon or coffee grounds.<br>  Mix a half teaspoon each of honey, borox, and aspartame (Equal, Nutrasweet, etc.), in small bottles. Place bottles on their sides, with lids off, in areas of most ant activity. Ants will carry the bait back to their colonies. Important: use indoors only; must be kept away from pets and children.<br>  Leave a small, low wattage night light on for a few nights in the area of most ant activity. The change in light can disrupt and discourage their foraging patterns.<br>  <br>  Clove oil-based commercial ant deterrents are available<br>  <br>  These are all natural way that wont hurt your kitties, hope these help.|`|4cd2bb45d74c59a869d474f2c32006e2aa	put the cats in another room and spray the living room.|`|bxlYleZkaa	Rashim said all the things I was going to say! You may also have to permanently block up the points of entry too, once you have stopped the ants actually coming in.|`|c8828614b563cd3de41253b6a9e40991aa	Ants tend to mark pathways with pheromones. If you can observe the ants on these pathways you can find where they are coming out of the wall or flooring. When you find this spot, pour a small amount of pure bleach there. Scrub the area with a strong bleach solution as well to destroy the scent trails.<br>  <br>  You can spray worktops with the following mixture: a 50/50 solution of white vinegar and water with a few drops of lavendar essential oil. Ants hate the smell of lavendar and will avoid the areas wiped with this solution.
v3xEtuLLaa	The attic in your area should have R-38, which equals 14" of blown in fiberglass.  Look in your phone book for an insulation contractor.  When I built my house 5 years ago, I found it was cheaper to hire them than to insulate myself.  They buy insulation by the boxcar load, so they get much better pricing than you or I would at a home center.  Hope this helps.|`|d0d7b35a707f98e4d94fb32cc3b60b5baa	You can simply add more insulation over whatever it is you have. Blown-in is probably the cheapest, but you have to get a contractor for this. Roll out bats cost more, but you can save by doing it yourself.|`|3W18HDxxaa	older type  of   insulation is rock wool <br>   was  a new idea, then  but not very good <br>   go with a Blown  fiberglass insulation the thicker the better

v3xEtuLLaa	Loggers cut down trees because of the endless demand for wood and wood products.  Clear cutting has reduced our original forest land by about 90%.  Companies have finally realized the impact to the environment, and have started managed foresting, using trees that grow more quickly and can be harvested every 15 years or so with little environmental impact.<br>  <br>  I'll leave the drought question to someone who knows more about weather than I do.  Hope this helps.|`|AA10097817	You're kidding, right?|`|AA10648704	Loggers cut down trees because wood is a very useful commodity.  They cut them down for lumber and all the other uses.  If you mean why are they cutting down the rainforest, they're doing it to not only harvest the trees, but also to clear the land for farmland and development.  <br>  <br>  As for droughts, it has to do with weather patterns.  Low pressure systems, or the fronts when low pressure systems hit high pressure systems, are usually the ones that bring rain.  If a high pressure system is set over a certain area and isn't moving, though, the low pressure system will be forced to go around it, and the rain will bypass the area.  Think of the low pressure system as a soccer ball, and the high pressure system as a goalie.  If he's good enough, the goalie will keep the soccer from getting into the goal (or in this case, keep the rain from getting to an area).|`|OQeXXvaPaa	trees are cut down for two reasons: first trees are needed for: paper, lumber, fences, log cabins, and telephone poles. Secondly, trees are cut down to make room for development: housing, industry, and highways. There are droughts when the climate in the area is warm and there is a period of time when there is an extra amount of heat (global warming does not exist) in that area so that more water is evaporated than is put back by rain.|`|3W18HDxxaa	because you like to  live  in a house, <br>    weather patterns changing <br>   nothing new, <br>   we have had hot summers, cold winters, normal summers  normal winters, <br>   every 10 yrs  weather patterns change|`|d0d7b35a707f98e4d94fb32cc3b60b5baa	You were absent that day, right?<br>  Or, maybe the dog ate your homework ?|`|PnP8lClEaa	Trees are made of wood.

bGKjlZrCaa	Like others have said, you've taken the color out of the fabric and your only choice (besides getting rid of it) is to dye it.  Be EXTREMELY careful when doing this.  It can be a real mess. I would recommend going to a laundry mat and doing the washing machine version instructions on the dye bottle.  My friend got black on the outside and parts of the inside of her washing machine...says she can't get it off.  It's pretty messy to do it by hand.  The good thing is that it's a lot cheaper than buying new clothes.|`|Ue5NoJOgaa	you can't, it isn't a stain, you actually removed the original die from the material|`|7178e20a3678c4210fe9d3bc2e2ab936aa	Well, unfortunately you don't.

fecc83891976d46e11713a2755c80e53aa	Easy, just wash your walls with one cup of White Vinegar and hot water, allow to air dry, when washing to avoid drips and runs wash from the bottom up, no up and down action otherwise streaking can appear, just a firm upward motion is needed, repeat if necessary Also leave a few bowls filled with White Vinegar in the rooms overnight or throughout the day to deodorize the rooms and remove the smoke odor, you can also pour in some vinegar into a clean empty spray bottle and a little added water and spray the room as you would an air freshener this will also deodorize the room and not cover up the smells temporarily as air fresheners do and is less expensive, to do this just add half a bottle of vinegar to the spray bottle and fill the remainder with warm water and then spray the room the vinegar will remove the smoke odors you can also spray this on furniture such as couches and chairs and curtains to deodorize  To deodorize your carpet I recommend you clean it with a steam cleaner to which you have filled the cleaning tank with two to three cups of White Vinegar no rug shampoo added and clean as you would normally with a steam cleaner, do not over soak and extract as much liquid as possible to near dryness allow area to dry with no foot traffic set up fans in rooms you cleaned to allow faster drying and open windows to alow the vinegar smell to dissipate which only last for fifteen minutes to one hour Good Luck !|`|ZnTfnuN8aa	wash curtains and blinds use a steam cleaner on couch,put small bowl of vinegar in room overnight should get rid of smell.|`|TAIlyvgyaa	When I stopped smoking I was DESPERATE to get rid of the smell!<br>  <br>  It's not a quick fix, but start with these things...<br>  <br>  1. buy a lot of baking soda (get them from from a Dollar store, MUCH cheaper), mix a few drops of any essential oil you like into each box of baking soda.  Lemon, lavender, rosemary, fresh smelling ones like that are best, but anything you like.  Then sprinkle the powder over all your soft furniture, like cushions and carpets and rugs and sofa.  Leave it a few hours at least and then vacum it up.  If need be, do it again, as often as you like.  Remember to change the bag/filters, as they might have a lot of cigarette smell in them.<br>  <br>  2. rewash all your clothes and bed linen/towels.  Chances are that everything in your dressers and closets smell of smoking, I know it did when I smoked!  Wash them all, it's a big task, but worth it.<br>  <br>  3. the walls and all your furniture need to be wiped down.  Use warm water and a couple of drops of oil again (about 5 per gallon), lemon is perfect for this. Get all the little corners and the ceiling!  Also, wash the filters from any hot or cold air systems you have... those filters can hold a lot of smell.<br>  <br>  I actually found doing all this helped me give up smoking.  The better my house and things smelt, the happier I felt about quitting.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|DtzoiddNaa	do a total clean of the house wash the walls curtains shampoo the carpet and your lounges need a clean if they are fabric and a special leather clean for that type of lounge bi carb soda sprinkled on the carpet and leave it there over night and vaccume up next day|`|SZudGT82aa	Everything, walls included will have to be washed with baking soda and water.

K70Hkq5haa	Gnats usually come from bananas or open garbage cans. Some house plants also attract gnats or the plant itself may be harboring larvae. Hair spray is one way to get them because it makes their wings get stuck together thus causing them unable to fly. The hard to hold type of hair spray works the best. If you have them in your plants, get rid of them as they will spread to your healthy plants. Avon's Skin so Soft is a great deterrent to keep them away from your face.

I've put the web link to help<br>  <a href="http://www.gardenersworld.com/plants/pots-containers/category/window-boxes/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gardenersworld.com/plants/pot...</a><br>  <br>  Generally you need a window sill that gets plenty of sun, but in a room which doesn't get too hot and dry.<br>  <br>  You will need good potting compost, seaweed or tomato fertiliser and a sturdy pot with drainage holes.<br>  <br>  If you can get planting soon, you still will be able to get some spring flowers as well.<br>  Hope this help, have fun.|`|yQdA5rHnaa	So you want to grow pot do you.|`|944iJNAdaa	Most houseplants are actually grown from cuttings, rather than seeds.  All you need is a cutting from another houseplant to start a new one, of course with a little soil and water.  Rooting houseplants is easy and a fun way to get new plants started.|`|C4yCdguHaa	You will need to get a propogator, thats like a small incubator. I sow seeds in yogurt pots, they are just the right size to start off with. At a garden centre you can buy seed compost, or John Innes number 1. Some seeds take a long time to germinate, so what you grow depends on you and how patient you are. You can grow things from dates, apples, oranges, as well as bought seed. Hope this helps.|`|TZSLoHeVaa	A good seed/potting compost like John Innis plant food like baby-bio and then the seed you want to grow,flowers, violets or ornamental Type plants (rubber plant,cheese plant)|`|AA10500537	it;s much easier and less expensive  to go buy  house plants than try to start them .<br>  you could try lowes /home depot even your grocery store carry them.<br>  you could even get slips from your friends  the you needs good potting soil

b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	One thing that I've been called out to fix on an old neglected log cabin is the chinking. That's the filler used to seal between the logs.<br>  Here is a very good site you may be interested in-<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.log-cabin-connection.com/cabin-restoration.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.log-cabin-connection.com/cabi...</a><br>  <br>  All the best with your restoration..|`|EmgiGg17aa	Exactly what do you mean "update it".  Log cabins are just that - log cabins.  A basic structure.   They will stand a 100 years by themselves.   Vandal are the biggest problem.(and vandals happen when it is too close to a road(vandals do not hike- who is going to carry all the beer?).    A hunter or cross-country skier  lost in the bush recognizes it as a place where one can get out of the cold wind and generally it has a roof over his head.   A place where if nothing else it may have a hearth or a stove where he can start a little fire to keep himself warm for awhile instead of just out in the middle of the bush.  That is why most cabins are never locked.  These type of people appreciate it for the temporary shelter it provided.   They are only too happy to split some more fire wood for the next wayward traveller who might get stuck in the same situation(middle of nowhere and darkness approaches) and need the use of the shelter.<br>      Windows seem to be the first thing to go.  (Some people still have not clued into the fact that glass breaks when you throw a rock at it.).  Roof might be problematic.  You got to see it first to see how basic it is.  If it is at a remote lake that you hardly ever go to - nor anyone else/keep it basic.  Forget about locks on the doors and windows.  They will just be broken.<br>     It is an evaluation when you get there.|`|5veU5nSwaa	Roof, water leaks, termite or carpenter ant problems, insulation problems, but really you are going to have to take a look and my advice to know for sure fork out the $300 or so and have a professional inspection done.
pzhnKxxGaa	hold your iron over the sofa with the steam function on close enough for the steam to reach the fabric but not to close as to burn it  after ward wipe ur sofa with a clean dry cloth,|`|3pUnk106aa	i wash my couch covers on a delicate wash, the rest of the settee i use warm water and fiary liquid, use a clean damp cloth and rub all over, comes  up a treat.|`|1zgmu2zJaa	lol ok......<br>  ****im single to***
hKJIDdVqaa	yeah, but just what was left over from my kids wasting it in the sink.  Shampoo works great in a pinch.  We have hard water ourselves, the orange is actually rust and toilet bowl cleaner although extremely poisonous will clean it right off with out even wiping it.|`|UFu0h8SKaa	yes i have. It was only cheap toothpaste tho, not whitening or anything and it worked really well
AA10097817	You can't organize clutter. You need to decide what items you use and the items you love. Give away the items that are still good, throw away the rest.<br>  <br>  Do you really need to see, touch, smell the sentimental things to remember the people, places and whatever that you've attached to those things? Take pictures of them. Keep the pictures, not the things. And if you think you're going to hand down to the next generation, stop. They don't want to be dealing with it either.|`|qtdxtaitaa	Here's a tip I've used with sentimental items - display them as artwork. I've had all types of stuff (beads & masks from Mardi Gras, animal shaped swizzle sticks from really cool dates, you know - junk to other folks, but precious to you) that I have put into shadow boxes or frames that have turned out great and always gets great reviews. <br>  <br>  You can hang clothing as wall hangings, make standing sculpture from hat collections, etc. Think creatively and you may be able to keep some precious items. Remember that if they stay hidden from view, they are probably useless anyway.
hKJIDdVqaa	they make a special attachment for a relatively small amount of money, it eliminates the lint. Go to home depot to find one.|`|AA10097817	Lint, not lent. Anyway, there should be vent piping taking it to the outside. If not, get it fixed. Now. At least, in the US.|`|00153b0154f2f960c55490518a8803c3aa	There is no attachment that will eliminate lint.  There are several things that will catch lint, but nothing that will eliminate it.  Lint is going to come off the clothes in the dryer, and it has to go somewhere.  You might try cleaning your lint filter, as well as putting  the nylon over the exhaust idea.  When I say clean your lint filter, I don't mean just pull the layers of lint off of the screen, I mean take it to the sink and try to run some water through it.  If water runs through it then it's fairly clean, however, fabric softeners release a film of gunk that collects on the screen of lint filters and eventually plugs them to the point that you can't get much, if any air through them.  If you can't get air through the lint filter, it can take forever to dry your clothes and the lint all goes out the vent, instead of being caught on the filter.  If water doesn't run through the screen freely, take a vegetable brush or a tooth brush and some liquid dish soap and a little water and gently scrub the screen.  When you're done the water should run right through, air will too.   About the nylon lint catcher thing, I'm not sure which would be worse, having lint all over the ground, or having a nylon half full of lint hanging on the side of the house.|`|EYufeuMnaa	Should be vented outside but you can use a nylon stocking in a pinch.<br>  Don't let it get clogged or you could have a fire.|`|4d8QwNQGaa	Pantyhose. It's a quick fix that will let out the exhaust while catching lint. Make sure it's not a fire hazard (depending on the location of your vent.)|`|sr7jX2wYaa	Even  when  properly  ventilated that sometimes  happens . Try a  pair  of old  panty hose & secure  with a  large  rubberband. My uncle  showed  me that trick years  ago*
AA10097817	They might, but oh well.|`|DdqiznkWaa	By magic!

jQTKZSAAaa	Maybe some red flowers, with an aqua ribbons around the vases on the tables. Maybe an aqua or red large table cloth covering the entire table and use a skinnier cloth of the opposite color for a running cloth. Maybe use it is the thank you gifts if you are having any - Red or Aqua bags with the opposite color ribbon accents. Have the bags sitting on the main table or just off to the side so that the guests can see, but they are not the main focus of the room. Good luck!|`|ZcHzNX4Uaa	in roses and in beading|`|qtdxtaitaa	Flowers are definitely the way to bring in supporting colors (although teal can be a problem). Consider adding thin ribbons (only a few - too much will overpower) with the supporting colors. Also depending on the formality of the event, you can add teal napkins to the dinnerware or even add a teal colored glass or cup.
v3xEtuLLaa	I'd say with 80% certainty that the kitchen wall is load bearing.  How does your brother in law think the joists stay up, magic?  If there is not another wall very close by that runs parallel to the kitchen wall, it is load bearing.  You can have a section removed, and replaced with a header, which would open things up, but you can't just remove the wall.  Hope this helps.|`|V9cZLXTwaa	Absolutely it cn be a load bearing wall ESPECIALLY in a 2 story. If there is a wall above the kitchen wall it can be load bearing even if it runs parallel to the joists. best to have an engineer or architect look at it. Likely it can be done but will require a header for additional support.|`|pfisYml0aa	yes, it can. check the original blue prints, or contact a contractor to come in and see.
TNwvuazEaa	I live in a America but I'm sure the rules are very similar. He can run the cable from the panel to wherever he needs to as long as it is contained within conduit. If using heavier gauge wire (like 10 for example), buy the wires individually (black, green, white, etc). Do not buy sheathed cable. It will get too hot inside the conduit. If running the conduit from the garage to somewhere inside the house, any holes you make in the garage wall to feed the conduit through must be sealed with fireproof caulk. The garage wall between the garage and the living space is a fire wall and no air gaps are allowed in them. Also, as far as the conduit goes, there has to be an end cap on each end. One end cap will be snapped into (or screwed in depending on which kind you get)  the panel and the other end to the junction box in the living/office space. The conduit will enter the panel from the top. Since he has a recessed panel, a hole will have to be made in the sheetrock above the panel to feed the conduit in. So what he'll most likely have is the conduit traveling along the wall of the garage (anywhere is acceptable but I would run it near the ceiling and have it turn down into the panel) and then have it go through the sheetrock just above the panel to make the connection with the panel. Shut off all power (main breaker) when you do this and do not touch the two thick cables you see entering the box. Those are the cables powering the home and are always live even when you've shut off the main breaker.
AA10526402	Rather than just using the small decorative rods like they used, I would get 2 long curtain rods (probably about 120" in length) that are an inch in diameter (so that they will be sturdy enough to hold the curtains without needing a center support bracket.  I found curtain rods like this at target.  Then get four curtain panels that are probably about 60" wide and 84" long.  I would check jcp.com for curtains - I have found great deals there; especially in their online outlet.  Hang a curtain rod and two panels above each door.  That should do the trick!<br>  The apartment looks very nice!
hKJIDdVqaa	baking soda, and alot of it.  Try coffee grounds vanilla, cinnamon, or essential oils.  Peroxide perhaps, but it will bleach dark fabrics.  If not get some carpet cleaner.|`|AA10097817	An enzyme cleaner is all I can think of. I'd use Nature's Miracle, available in the pet supply section of grocery store or pet stores. Follow the instructions. Don't try mopping it up. Let it dry on its own. Put aluminum foil over the spot if you have to put the car set back.|`|EYufeuMnaa	rent a rug doctor with upholstery attachment. Steam works wonders!|`|DzRLYAAJaa	I had the same thing happen to me, 'cept the milk was pooled right around where my seat belt bolts down beside my driver's seat (the bottle rolled under the driver's seat). <br>  <br>  First thing I did was use my carpet cleaner and got as much as I could out of there. Then I sprayed Febreze (that smell mixed with rotten milk is nausiating). The next day, I sprinkled down some baking soda, but that didn't help much. Then I was reminded of a trick my dad always used when he used to haul pigs in a semi, sprinkle down cinnamon, so I poured cinnamon on the spot, which thankfully covered the smell up. Then 2-3 days later I noticed the smell was coming through the cinnamon smell, so I vacuumed up the old and sprinkled down some more. and continued to do that for about 3 weeks, then the smell was finally gone. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!

n8x9pTOHaa	Bottle finish or bottle end duvet covers are designed so you can put the duvet in through the opening, then tuck the flap under the end of the mattress to stop the duvet sliding off the bed. A lot of French duvet covers have some kind of flap at the end.  <a href="http://www.jhtrousseau.com/bedbasics.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.jhtrousseau.com/bedbasics.php</a>|`|AA10097817	That's what it looks like to me.|`|vwYbFtkqaa	I didn't find any diagram, but I think bottle finish may refer to a starched finish on the fabric.

You need to know quite a few things before you get all excited and make a mistake.  <br>   #1 Does the owner of the lot OWN  IT  free and clear?<br>   #2 Ask for a plot plan, that will give you the dimensions of the lot<br>       (for example: the lot is 50 feet wide x 92 long)<br>   #3 Does this lot need sewer and water hookups? (these take up alot <br>       of room for the trenches)<br>   #4 Have you looked into the zoning? Are you sure you can legally put <br>       a double wide on this land?  <br>   #5 Do you know what the set backs are from the property edges?<br>  <br>   #6 Do you know if its in a seasonal flood plain?<br>  <br>       I could go on and on with a hundred questions....get a lawyer, and <br>    get as much information about the land as you can before making <br>    any deals.
