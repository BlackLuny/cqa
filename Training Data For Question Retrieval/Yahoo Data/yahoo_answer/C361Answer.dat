oCG2JxsEaa	on companystore.com you can personalize pillowcases! hope this helps!|`|5ta5yyWSaa	lands end or company store or buy plain and have them embroidered. department stores can do it too but will cost more and take a long time|`|s38ToTNSaa	Maybe try stores that sell lots of pillows and bedding if they don't have them you can ask to have them special order some for you. It might coast a bit more though but shouldn't be to bad.|`|eQoj3fYGaa	buy a cute or comfortable pattern from wall-mart or something then get it custome designed.
d6bUhFnjaa	I would tell them that this is still your home and that they will respect you and your home if they want to continue doing business with you, I would ask to talk to their supervisor to tell them, with this day and age of cell phones, there is now way the communications here should be a problem. and you would appreciate a little more common courtesy.|`|AA10286634	The house I bought was for sale but I was just cruising the neighborhood and saw the sign.  The owner was watering the lawn.  He was the one that "Sold" me the house that had been on the market for a month.  My real estate person said he should have insisted on at least a percentage of the sales commission.  Not all real estate people are competent.|`|M9o5WpOqaa	Hell,yeah I would be upset!  My house was on the market last spring and I had a showing planned for one afternoon.It was really rainy that week,so when my realtor confirmed the appt w/the buyer's realtor-she mentioned that they need to remove their shoes."no problem' said the buyer's agent.About an hour later,I had an emergency and needed to cancel the showing.I called my realtor,who in turn,called the other agent.She tried 5-6 times to reach him with no answer,she paged him and left a message w/his office.The fool apparently didn't check his messages and showed up anyway.They not only DIDN'T remove their shoes,they even stepped in dog poop from the neighbors yard and tracked poop and mud thru my entire house.THEN they had the balls to complain that my freshly steam cleaned carpeting was 'dirty' and needed to be ripped out and replaced @ our expense.I was beyond pissed and called my realtor,she gave him an earful! ARGH! I hate stupid people!!|`|ZpDvYoakaa	I would be pissed and ask for a reduced commission fee from your real estate agent. Play hardball.|`|JHasLcn3aa	Of course you have a right to be upset.  But if you want your house to get sold, i would just have left like you did:)|`|ee74f3aa67efefa8e49e21be6f4ec61faa	I would be mad.  You need to call the secretary that called you to cancel and find out exactly who called her to cancel.  When you get that straightened around, ask to speak with your realtor and tell him what happened.  Don't take your anger out on the secretary, she was probably only doing what she was told.|`|GFXz4vlSaa	Not much you can do.  Keep it in perspective...you want to sell the house right?    Just grin and bear it and realize that people are inconsiderate asses...  When we were selling our immaculate house, we would come back and there would be leaves and wet footprints all over the place.  I mean, if you're a visitor in someones home, and see that it is spotless, shouldn't you remove your shoes??  Really aggravated me, but we just vacuumed and mopped and eventually sold the house.    Good luck|`|FXnHE7mmaa	I would not have been that kind..I would have told them the appointment had been cancelled and please leave. I would call the office and deny this realtor into your home for just this reason...I have a short fuse for many realtors...they have little common courtesy around this area.  I would suggest you have and use a lock they do not have key access to from now on so this cannot ever happen again.|`|qybtMl3Jaa	I would be upset myself!|`|944iJNAdaa	Sure, you can be mad.  But, there was a chance of miscommunication between two agents here, and apparently there was a potential customer with this agent.  Do you want this house sold, or do you want to alienate these people who also want to see this house sell?  There's a point to be mad, and there's a point that if you don't cooperate, this house might never sell.  You decide how mad you really want to be here.  :)

If this is to be used a a Prom or dance it will be fine one its own! Can I ask why you want a Christmas tree when Christmas is over?|`|Ir51Eb0Kaa	I think some white lights would look great  ?|`|jNUYkCZxaa	Wow that is some pretty winter wonderland jazzy fantazzy tree but I couldn't imagine any ornaments that would look well enough on it unless it was just crystal tear drops and ice cycles maybe.  But even then it would have to be in the right setting.|`|y3lBLqIOaa	i pulled up the link but could not see it,i got an error message.    sorry i cant help|`|fUhosu5Raa	too be honest i like live green trees,,, i dont think it would be very decorative without ornaments maybe purple and silver ornaments????|`|UQPj1S5kaa	sweet u might wanna put sumthin on there thou
KtMpAZ2yaa	It is difficult to grow a bonsai from seeds. You would need to take special care and attention to have a good chance of getting through with it.  Please follow the link below for more information on growing bonsai from seeds.  http://www.thebonsaihub.com/bonsai-seeds...|`|hWd50Lk8aa	Melanie,    Take it from a guy who has grown bonsai for over 15 years, do not waste your time on seeds.    Spend $40.00 and get you a nice plant.    Most of the bonsai in my collection were dug up out of fields and creeks.    Before you go crazy, check out a few books from the library, yes library. You will need to see hundreds of photos to ever get any idea of what to do.    Another thing, bonsai belong outside. Only my tropicals come in during the winter. If you try to keep a tree in your house, it will be dead in 6 weeks.    No go drink a beer and look a pretty bonsai books.|`|f57f19afc977beb390488d1a707b7b00aa	it will take a long time to make a bonsai out of a seed... look for other alternatives like shrubs... or you can buy one...
zdvnqucsaa	Try a local hardware store, Lowe's, Home Depot, or a local glass store.  They all carry acrylic, and will cut it to size for you as well.|`|FWOdlpx8aa	You sometimes find these on ebay or if not look in your local business directory under sign makers or plastic fabricators / plastic distributors.    They might have an off cut / cut down they could sell you.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	Places that sell window glass will sell it and cut it to size for you.  (1/2" thick might be a 'special order'.)
jW8nfcA6aa	The surface probably wasn't clean in those spots even though it seemed clean. After sanding down to bare metal, wipe the surface with a clean cotton cloth dampened with acetone,lacquer thinner,or something simular.
AA11136470	a solution of tsp & water will get rid of that. (tri sodium phosphate) you can find it in any paint department. buy some rubber gloves too as it is caustic. safety glasses  would be a plan too|`|68dae82437ede9e0c39dc1f85e7252a5aa	Men with horrible aim, could it be pee?  Soapy rag should do the trick.|`|AA10520442	One gallon of warm water + 1/2 cup of ammonia and a sponge.  This will remove just about any dirt on your walls and will not harm the paint.|`|MfcTIdlraa	Do you smoke?  If you do, in all likelihood it is the tar from your cigarettes being washed down the wall by the steam in the shower.    Couldn't begin to tell you what it is otherwise.    Wouldn't even want to hazard a guess.  UGH!!!!|`|FXnHE7mmaa	It is from the condensation from the humidity in your bathroom..it is the wetness and dust particles that cause the colour and everyone gets this. Just wash down your walls with TSP and make sure you crack open a window or turn on your fan when taking a shower or bath which will slow this down.|`|AA11490722	warm soapy water and a sponge should do the trick or some sugar soap

03sLrNPCaa	PVC compression fittings are considered to be an emergency fix for temporary use.  Not recommended for permanent installation.  Plus the outside diameter of pvc and galvanized pipe is not the same. It would be better if you rethread the steel pipe after you cut it and use a union. Or best, hook up your irrigation system somewhere else rather than on the main line coming into the house.  If you have any trouble with whatever tee and fittings you use, you are going to affect the entire household.|`|CKIXFqfAaa	I assume you mean poly tube not PVC. If you wish to use a compression fitting it would be best to use a steel union/tee as the rule of thumb is that the material of the fitting needs to be harder than the tube used.     If the material of the tube can be easily compressed with your fingers you will need to use an insert so that the ferrules on the fitting can work to their full potential.|`|AA10276489	I see no reason why you can't. As long as the pipe is very clean and smooth as the rubber seal is made for a smooth surface.|`|oyjMey2Taa	you gotta have the little plastic rig that fits over the pipe put the nut on 1 st then the ring and tighten it up It wont leak|`|mYfkJFTVaa	I have no idea good luck        http://www.toboc.com/forum3/default.aspx...|`|Mvfqsyupaa	All the answers are wrong.  PVC is illegal for potable water (drinking)   Your home's water supply will be traveling through the fitting.   Buy a BRASS compression fitting and use brass pipe or copper tubing to supply the anti-siphon valve to the sprinkle manifold.    That's the RIGHT way.   Anything else is half-assed.|`|pjGueC4xaa	You can go from pipe to PVC, but need the right fitting.  I never heard of a PVC compression fitting though.  You glue PVC.  Compression fittings are used on copper or steel, not PVC. Talk to your local hardware store guy.|`|FO0jlQFyaa	Go to your local hardware store and tell them what your doing. They will help you use the right fitting.  When I do a job like that I also use silicon in the joint, BUT, you must fit everything together 100% correctly and you also must tighten everything then let it sit four 6 to 8 hours for the silicon to set up before you turn on the water. I have never had a leak.
I81Eiqbsaa	Don't "hack" it back and don't wait till spring.  Tie a rope or belt around it about midway. Tighten the rope the cut the stalks back leaving about 10 - 12".  When you are finished cutting, all the grass is caught in the rope and you throw it away with no mess.  Go ahead and cut it back now not in spring when new growth is starting to come out.|`|ZgOI7leMaa	Here is some great information on trimming all ornamental grasses.   http://naturehills.com/gardening/blogs/c...|`|f57f19afc977beb390488d1a707b7b00aa	wait for spring when it starts to grow...|`|hNfOgNNBaa	Simply 'hack' it back about 12" above the ground-assuming most of the grass leaves are dead.

Good luck...|`|jW8nfcA6aa	If they still make it, SHOE-GOO, it would be hanging on the rack with all the other glues. Hardware, Department Stores, Cobbler Shops and Dollar or Clearance Stores. Good Luck, I don't think they make it any more. Stores like Goodwill and Salvation Army have very reasonable prices on replacement shoes.|`|FO0jlQFyaa	Almost any store that sells shoes|`|3a082722cea27ba378a88a859b07202daa	It works I got t at the Drug store chain once and a shoe repair place at the mall.

It's art in its self.|`|yuwjQjKqaa	You NEVER USE EVEN NUMBERS when decorating. So go with the one!
AA10097817	Lots of work. Mom and Dad need to get involved.|`|V4VGFyxlaa	Yeah you definitely need help... but here are some ideas...    Floors: Give your basement a good sweep and wash the floors well. You can rent a dance floor to put in.    Walls: You can get get that wrapping paper from the are store that's like silver or gold and cover the walls with it. You should really go to your neighborhood arts & crafts store and get some ideas to make things to hang from the ceiling. You can also cover the walls with balloons.    Good luck and happy sweet 16!!!!!|`|Dl6NIYt5aa	There is a a lot of work that needs to be done here. I'm giving you a link which will explain several consequences.

It sounds good to me. But what color do you like actually?  I think you too can do very well with your favorite colors but you are just not aware of all the techs and tips.   You would be living in your room and you need to have all those colors that you like. There are many other things that you can add to this project. But you need to make a plan - a list - for everything that you want and don't want.   I'm giving you some links where you can get a lot of ideas, tips and techniques that are essential for such creative projects.|`|NuvKPl3naa	any color would be good with the brown frames. pick a white for 3 walls and do one wall green, blue or pink (that matches the shade of the comforter)|`|ee33b2a393b166491be1cc514e3f4156aa	If you are going to use brown frames, I think you should paint your walls either the blue or the green from your comforter.

nYBsbm4haa	If the water won't drain from the dishwasher, first manually remove as much water as possible and then check the sump area for paper or any other large object. Make sure the door is properly latched. The pump will not drain if the door is not latched properly. Check the belt, drain line, air gap, drain valve and solenoid assembly, the motor, and the pump. If your dishwasher uses a belt to drive the pump, and it has broken or come off the pulley, replace it.     A cup or so of water in the sump area of your dishwasher is normal. It is there to prevent the seals from drying out. The dishwasher will pump this old water out before beginning to wash.    If you have recently installed a garbage disposer in your home, make sure that the drain plug on the disposer has been removed. It's just a little plastic piece that blocks the hole where you hook the dishwasher drain hose. If your dishwasher drains through the garbage disposer, you need to run the garbage disposer before you run the dishwasher to make sure that the drain is clear.    There is a drain hose between the drain valve or pump and the garbage disposal or drain line. If an obstruction has blocked this, then your dishwasher won't drain. The drain hose is connected by clamps to the drain valve and the disposer or drain pipe. Remove it and visually inspect it for a clog or a kink. Try to remove any debris. If it is in good condition, just put it back on, and if not, purchase a new one to install.    If you don't have an air gap in the drain line, at least use a high drain loop. Making a large loop about 18" off the ground with the drain line can prevent any back flow into the dishwasher from the sink.    If you have one, the air gap will be located on top of the sink. The air gap is there to prevent any siphoning of standing water from the sink. When your dishwasher drains, the air gap diaphragm will form a seal and allow the water to drain properly. If the diaphragm in the air gap is faulty, its possible that water can leak onto the cabinet and into the sink area. When this happens, then the air gap must be replaced.    Like the inlet valve, there is also a drain valve on most models. When no power goes to the drain valve it remains closed and prevents water from leaving the machine. When the valve receives power during the drain cycle, the solenoid opens and allows the water to leave the machine. If your drain hose is attached directly to the pump, you don't have a drain valve. The motor simply reverses and the pump sends the water in the opposite direction, which is out of the machine.    If the motor doesnt turn or work properly, the dishwasher may not drain. Make sure you have power to the unit. If you notice that the motor hums but won't turn, it could be seized, and you probably need to replace it.    Small objects can sometimes get stuck in the pump. When this occurs, youll need to open the pump and remove any debris buildup. The dishwasher pump is usually mounted directly to the motor and runs off the motor as well. The pump is also attached to the bottom of your dishwasher and pushes the water from the dishwasher.|`|AA12246425	pour a cup of vinegar and 2 tblspoons of baking soda in the dispenser (seperate) run a wash on the heavy cycle.with hot water.listen to hear the water spraying out.if it doesnt sound like its spraying stop and look at the top of the agitator for any foreign materials and remove with a paper clip,tweezers etc...|`|JT4OSUPeaa	with 2 cups of vinegar then run the full cycle with the heat option.

I'm also sort of lost about what the filter is normally attached to that it came undone from?   Sounds like you put it back together incorrectly, or didn't get rid of whatever was clogging things up to begin with, and when you went back to cleaning, it finally overheated.  It may have a thermal fuse on the motor or it may not.  If it does, it probably won't reset itself, it's likely a one time thing.   You'll probably have to take it to a vac store for repairs.
VFmmVHGVaa	No in fact it is unsafe to do so.if your having problems stating it try replacing the spark plug.If this does not work and your not familiar with saw repair ,take it to a pro.|`|03sLrNPCaa	I would be very surprised if it doesn't.  Every saw I have had or used has a half throttle lock position.  It actually makes start up safer because you can use that free hand to steady the saw on the wrap around handle bar rather than having to leave it on the throttle grip.
CYft6gGwaa	First of all you are correct about the turquoise color deposits.  These are from the minerals in the water taking some copper from the pipes as it flows through.    There are many expensive products on the market to remove these deposits such as lime-away, clr, and others.  I have tried all of them over the years.  Buy a jug of white vinegar at the grocery store!  It's a fraction the price and works as well or better than any of those cleaners that cost many times the price.    There should be a way to unscrew the nozzles so you can remove them from the tub.  Put them in a bucket with about a half cup of vinegar and 2-3 gallons of water.  Let them soak in there over night.  Depending on how thick the deposits are you might want to take an old tooth brush to them.  If some of the deposits remain let them soak a couple more hours and brush again.  Then rinse completely with lots of cold water.      With the nozzles removed it is the perfect time to do the painting.  At home centers (I recomend Menards if there is one near you) in the paint department you can find bathtub refinishing kits.  These have a special epoxy paint just for this purpose.  Applied according to the instructions it will give a very durable finish.  Vital point to the application is to make certain the surface you are painting is absolutely clean!  Use a good degreasing cleaner (I like 'Simply Orange') then clean it again with the vinegar to make certain there is no residue of any type.  Then rinse everything very thoughly.  Put a fan in there for several hours to make certain everything is completely dry.  Now you are ready to paint it.  Anyone can slap paint on anything.  The key to a premium paint job is taking the time to good preparation work!  If you want a truely excellent paint job expect to spend as much time doing prep work as you do painting.|`|d6bUhFnjaa	CLR or LIMEAWAY are made just for this and most stores and hardwares carry it and it work great, Gray bottle for CLR and a yellow or green spray bottle for LIMEAWAY

Push the cardboard into the hole and carefully pull the string and stick up behind the cardboard.  Hold the cardboard and the stick back until you get it right where you want it and then pull the cardboard to exactly the place you want it. Use fix-all, or some quick dry compound to fill in the backing but do not use allot of pressure it is just completely coating the edges and fills in the void so when you put a straight edge you see it could still be filled more but wait and just drop the string to the ground.   The next day cut off the string and use taping compound to fill it in the rest of the way. You may need to match the texture but go slow every step needs to dry
I08iONdaaa	No, it's the tar and ash. If you smoke out of a bong, your removing more of the junk that would normally get into the air by filtering the smoke through water, which also makes the tobacco hit smoother. I don't sully my bong with tobacco though. . . When you smoke a cigarette inside, it releases more particles into the air, as there is no significant filtration involved. That would be my answer.|`|nmBNAD6qaa	No.    You should stop smoking, it is terrible for you.

I40vnqNyaa	Rather than poison them and have them die and stink up your house, try traps.  I have traps that i bought at the local hardware store that only cost a few dollars each, and are very effective for catching large rodents.  The traps are a rectangular box style trap made from very hard wire.  One end of the trap has a door on it that allows the rat to enter the trap but once inside is unable to get back out.  These traps can also be reused as many times as you need.  Very simple design, but works very well.  Put a couple of these up in your roof. Rats are scavengers so it wont take them long to sniff out whatever scraps you choose to put inside.  Once inside you just pick up and carry the trap by the handle and dispose of them however you choose.  Its better than the awful smell your left with if you poison them and  they die up in your roof or inside a wall cavity.  Give it a try, i know it works. :)|`|diQ0oodqaa	Wow, I had rats, too. One of two things got rid of them for me. It was either the pellet poison I poured in every hole I could find that killed them. Or it was cleaning up the brushpiles and all where snakes were---got rid of the snakes about the time they dissappeared, too.    The last time I saw one, I was on riding lawnmower behind house, had shorts on, naked legs. When I made a cut thru grass in back yard, a rat jumped up from a hole as high as my leg on that side of mower. I think he and I both almost died. I found later that they had tunnels from yard to underneath house. Smart little critters...............|`|AA10286634	go to a feed store and get poison blocks.  Actually, you are better off getting a professional exterminator to trap them, when rats die in the walls it smells for up to three weeks.|`|6xyeYjkkaa	Forget the poison, get sticky traps. They can't get loose from them and can be easily disposed of. Rats are smart and learn to avoid poison after one dies. Same for live traps. They never seem to catch on to sticky traps though.

I would use a floor screen over the colored pad.  The screen will scratch the surface of the floor while cleaning it, so the wax will adhere right. You will need a good mop for the job to pick-up the water that is put onto the floor (or a water vacuum). Don't forget to re-mop the floor right after (rinse the residue off the floor) you get all the water up. *When using those upright Scrubber remember that use pressure on the handles to make it move & to control it. Pressure down on it will make it go one way & pulling or letting pressure off of it will make it of another way.  -Black pads are the coarsest  -Brown pads are the next coarsest  -Blue/green are for cleaning  -White/Pink are for buffing the floor  If you decide to sand the floor a drum sander can be rented from a local home improvement store. Then you just need an edge sander or a hand belt sander (to do the edges or corners).  -Then you can use the type of stain you wish on the floor. Once that dries you can use mop & glow.    Hope that wasn't too much!  Good Luck!
UAMtRFruaa	Don't know.
y31mee4Faa	You're rolling with a roller that's too dry or rolling the paint too much.    Add some flotrol (mix in real well) to it to lengthen the wet time & don't work the paint so much.    If you're painting at night, wait until daylight so that you can see the marks before they dry into the finish.    If you've got your house/apartment temperature above 70 degrees, lower the temp so that it doesn't dry too quickly...you might even turn it off while painting.    For a flat surface you should not need anything thicker than a 3/8" nap roller.    Since you've already put 3 coats on the hall, let it dry for 5-7 days before adding any more coats.  Adding additional coats of paint over layers that are not dry yet will cause additional problems & a splotchy finish.    Paints can take up to 45 days to cure out.  Dry to the touch does not mean dry paint.        Good luck...|`|b996bdcf34d088f7d764a720874eabe3aa	Depending on the texture of your walls, you would need a larger or smaller nap. For example, my walls have knock down (deep texture) and I needed to get a 3/4 size roller to fill in the texture and make a smooth appearance. Hope that helps! Painting is not fun!|`|AA11136470	I always paint a strip ceiling to floor about 3 feet wide. then I go over it again right away while still wet with the roller starting at the top & roll all the way down to the floor non stop. then I move over & paint another 3 foot wide strip & repeat til the room is done. no roller marks. works every time.|`|yuwjQjKqaa	You used a bad paint repaint using Glidden paint its the best!|`|mP0LLMVjaa	When painting with a roller you need to paint a large W on the wall and then start rolling from there to blend the paint.

N4IvZmPiaa	It is physically possible, but not a good idea.You connect a hose from the portable container service valve to the service valve on the storage tank.Turn the portable container upside down and elevate it above the storage tank.open both service valves. It takes a heckuva long time, but it will transfer. If you open the bleeder valve on the storage tank, that will lower the pressure in the storage tank and will help speed it up a bit, but you will be losing some fuel in the process.     It takes a lot of time and a lot of effort. You also need a special hose, which nobody is going to sell you! Propane service people would carry one to use in an emergency, but they aren't going to sell one to the public. It isn't really a safe practice for an experienced gas fitter to do, never mind a homeowner...

XgOIlU0eaa	....previous answer correct except if water is coming out of the overflow [we call it a t&p valve,,t&p stands for temperature and pressure] then i doubt anything will blow up,,explosions are usually the result of people plugging or capping off the t&p valve....if you or someone you know is handy,go buy a 5" water heater t&p valve from home depot or similar store...to replace it..shut off breaker to water heater if its electric..if its gas,turn the tstat control knob to its coolest position so it stays off..turn off the water to the water heater..drain a few gallons of water to be sure water level is below the t&p valve...unscrew the old one...put pipe dope on the threads of the new one and screw it in tight,be careful how much you screw it in though, as you turn it,,once its tight,dont go past the spot where you need it to point unless you can get another turn out of it....fyi,all t&p valves should have a pipe coming off of them pointing down toward the floor,,pipe should go down to within 1-2 feet of floor,,this makes it safer so no one can get sprayed in the face by hot water if t&p valve opens....if the new t&p valve opens anytime soon,,you will need a plumber........dan|`|N8BbxwrGaa	This could be very serious if your not careful.

dkoGI9nfaa	I had a florist shop for a long time with a fantastic cool room.  The flowers kept beautifully in the cool room.  We however got complaints that some flowers wilted rather quickly once delivered.  Thought it was our suppliers who sold us older stock.  My senior florist left the company and I appointed another senior florist.  He was not very happy with the cool room.  When I asked him why?  His answer:  "Flowers are best kept at the ambient room temperature else they tend to wilt quickly once they are taken out and put in a normal temperature room.  I sold my pride and joy - the cool room - after we did not use it for quite some time and were complimented by many customers about the life of arrangements in their houses.  Something which never happened before that.  So flowers are best kept at room temperature unless they can remain in the controlled room for their entire picked life.

However, depending on how unique the color of your jeans is, you might not be able to find a patch that matches exactly. The patches only come in a few colors, and if the match isn't close, everyone will be able to see that you patched your pants at the crotch, which doesn't look good. But it's better than having a hole there, I suppose.    You can buy these patches at hardware stores, department stores (including Wal-Mart, etc.), and also at larger drugstores (like CVS/pharmacy) in the sewing/shoe care section.    You can also get them online:  http://www.amazon.com/tag/blue%20jean%20...          If all your jeans are getting holes in the crotch, though, you might want to consider if there's something you're doing that you should change. Is it related to the way you store the jeans perhaps? Or maybe you need a larger size? Or buy a tougher brand of jeans? Or, if you do something that creates a lot of friction on that area (like horseback riding), then maybe there is nothing you can change, and you just need to patch your jeans or buy new ones frequently.

Then you will need to start advertising.    Alot of cleaners advertise on craigslist in there own city.  good start for building fast clients.also try poster boards,and business cards  you can get business cards and t-shirts online at vista print..    then figure out what you are going to charge per say house  and the types of cleaning you are going to be doing.  there are different types of cleanings:    1.general clean  2.full top to bottom deep clean  3.move in/move out clean    the average general cleaning on a 3 bedroom 2 bath house1500- 2000 sqft is $75 to $85.00 this is typically for 3 hours then you can charge for example $15-$25 an hour after 3 hours.    your move in/move out cleanings are where the big bucks come in.  alot of people thing that because a place is vacant it should be easier and therefore cost less  not true at all.    when cleaning a move in-out clean  everything is cleaned.  all appliances,windows-window sills-blinds-ceiling fans-baseboards-inside cabinets-along with bathrooms-spot cleaning walls-floors and more. it is a lot of work and 3 bedroom house may take you 5-7 hours to clean with 1 person depending on the condition of the house.    Supplies you will need to start:    *Terry cloth towels at least 100 to start(walmart)in the hardware section  *10 Micro fiber towels for dusting  *Paper Towels  2 Caddys a dusting caddy and a bathroom caddy-everything won't fit in one..  *Scrubbers (scotch Brite)  Use colored scrubbers like pink or orange for kitchen use(this keeps them fom getting confused with which ones you use in other areas of the house. you can find the colored ones at the dollar tree or 99 cent store.along with a lot of other usefull supplies that actually work good.  *Hand held scrubber for tubs  *Pumice stone for toilets(very important part of cleaning toilets)  *Dawn-Polmolive dish soap  *clorox clean up  *soft scrub  *magic eraser(a must have for making white shower bottoms and tubs clean and white again you can also use on the out side of microwaves and fridge and dishwasers to make them clean again)  *tile cleaner(tilex)  *Clr or Lime Away  *grout cleaner(get one that is also safe on colored grout)Ultimate grout cleaner is good(lowes)  *Toilet bowl cleaner- use to ad color to the bowl after cleaning as well as cleans and disenfects  *Windex(or you can use a solution of vinegar and water  *All purpose cleaner  *Air Freshener  *Furniture Polish  *Liguid Gold-Walmart- this shines chrome-stainless steel-black   appliances-wood furniture,etc really really good.  *Murphys oil for wood cabinets_not suggested for wood floors-build up  *Wood floor cleaner  *Wood floor Duster Mop  *Extendable duster  *s.os pads take the place of oven cleaner and actually works better.  *Mop-with mop heads you can replace at each house and use different mops for the bathroom to kitchen-This can be pricey if you have alot of houses.  *Broom  *Dust Pan  *Mop Bucket  *Step Stool Ladder  *Gloves-Disposable & Heavy Duty  *Toilet Brush Big & Small  *Tooth Brushes  *Trash Bags  *Cloth Bag For Dirty Towels you use  *Good vacuum with attachments-hoses-  Bagless is not suggested when cleaning houses-this can become a pain and after so many cleanings becomes impossible to clean out even if buying new filters.  Get a commercial vac if possible..    Best of Luck|`|bCcQBG23aa	All purpose cleaner, bleach, windex, rags and paper towels, broom/vacuum, mop, toilet cleaner and brush (maybe a plunger in case of any emergency), different kinds/assortments of scrub pads, sponges, etc. Dish and dishwasher detergents/soaps, laundry soap, etc.  Spray bottles that you can fill with cleaning fluids (and label correctly), garbage bags, oven cleaner, comet, (maybe draino in case of an emergency), CLR,     If you can buy your supplies in bulk so its cheaper and then you can just fill your own containers/spray bottles, etc.  Do use good quality cleaning supplies though otherwise your work wont be easy or come out looking too good with bad products.    Also before going to do a job make sure to ask the client of any specific products they want you to use or ways they might want you to do some things. Find out if they have anything at there place you will have access to using like a vacuum, mop, etc.  Always have all your supplies with you in your vehicle though since you never know if something will be needed.  I think a good idea as well would be to have a well organized list typed up and copy a whole bunch to use on all clients. Sort the list by rooms first, then under each room list any and all possible duties typical for that room. Make small boxes beside each duty that you or the client can tick off wether they want that duty to be done or not. Leave space between everything to possibly write down any special directions of any kind beside any task or room.    Also have an area to write down the date(s) and times of when you agree to come work.The address, phone, name, etc. of client too As well as price(s) you both have agreed on and when payment has been made.

JT4OSUPeaa	I asked my BF he does Maintenance work...this is what he said since you dont have a plunger....    Take your garbage can and fill it up with water and dump it in the toilet really fast, it puts pressure and will push it on down. Then flush after it goes down.    Edit: My BF says the mini plunger may still work, if not then there is something lodged in the line like a small toy or something.

What I found was that there was so much grout on the sub floor that I had to have the hardwood floor installers cut the sub floor out and put a new sub floor on before they would install the hardwood....  BUT....if you are going to install new tile where the old tile was, and I did this as well...I just made sure that I got as much grout off the sub floor as possible, and when you are putting the adhesive to the ground, it will even out when spreading.  I would have a level on hand, because I didn't, and after all was done, I realized that one tile was slightly raised in one corner.    As for floor rotting, if you aren't able to look through the ceiling below for wood that looks darker in some areas (which is a sign of water damage) My in laws have water damage on their floor, which is visible from the ceiling in the basement.  On the main level, it is apparent something is wrong because the floor is sinking in some areas.    Good luck with your project.  I hope I was of some help to you.
AA10097817	You can try to clean out under the floor of the dishwasher. Do you rinse your dishes before cleaning them in the machine? If not, that gunk builds up over time and affects the way the machine cleans.    If that doesn't work, I'd call an appliance repair company.

Or it makes a noise, but does nothing.  If it fills up and agitates, but won't drain or spin, that's a bad lid switch.  If its filling up, but then not even making a sound, that would imply your motor is bad, bad timer or you have a wiring problem (mice maybe?).  If it makes noise, like a grinding noise, but doesn't really do anything, that would be a bad coupler.  If it doesn't even fill up with water, that would imply an electrical or timer problem.

To repair it, either look up the manual for your washer online or call a repairman.|`|JT4OSUPeaa	The lid switch is a safety device, your washer would not run in the cycles but the timer would still go is how you know if its broken.

This is a safety device which is prone to failure.

After starting the machine's wash cycle, if you lift the lid (open it), then it interrupts the cycle - stopping it.  Some washing machines will also have a safety catch that will engage, during the spin cycle, which would prevent lifting the lid.    You would know your switch is broken one of two ways, the cycle will not stop, when the lid is lifted, or the machine will not operate at all.  This is a relatively inexpensive part, and not too difficult to replace.  You would need your machine's brand and model number, to get a replacement.  Then lift the top cover of the machine to access the switch, to replace it.

AA10332086	It is not uncommon for a wood burning fireplace to have a small gas burner installed to serve in lieu of kindling to start a wood fire. Our last house had one of these and we used it for 25 years with no problems.    It is true that only fireplaces that are specifically designed to be efficient with an outside sources of combustion air and a heat exchanger are likely to provide an heat to your home. A simple fireplace will rob your house of a great deal of heat even when there is no fire in the fireplace. A fireplace or chimney needs a positive means other than the damper to prevent warm air from drafting up the chimney.|`|AA12246425	do not burn wood over a gas line!  remove it prior to using wood  fireplaces are not really for heat (gas or wood)  they are for the serenity and visual enjoyment  if you are in the room turn the furnace down a few degrees and use wood|`|256fe92c1f48eeee32f2750edc89baafaa	You've got a pipe running across the middle of the fireplace with a line of little holes in it?  That's called a gas log lighter - far easier to get the fire started than using paper and kindling and stuff.  They are intended to have a wood fire burning over them.    The whole thing about fireplaces being net negative is pretty tricky.  In general they pull a lot of the warm from the house up and out the chimney and then suck cold outside air in around every door and window in the house.  It's possible that you could turn the thermostat way down in the rest of the house, bask in the radiant heat of a nice fire and end up net positive, but at some point you have to leave the warm fire and go to your now very cold bedroom.  It worked for the pioneers.    A gas log does not improve this situation.  It saves you buying wood, produces less soot so isn't illegal on cities that have woodburning restrictions, etc.  But the combustion air still comes form inside the house and the open chimney still draws tons of conventionally heated air up and out.    It is possible that you could put in a gas insert - this would have an outside combustion air source - easy if you have an ash pit and nearly impossible if you don't.  And it would have a closed firebox so you'd be looking at the fire through glass and only combustion gasses would be going up your chimney.  And it might have a heat exchanger and fan so it could pump tons of heat into the house.    But, there are two problems - no gas fireplace insert will ever be as efficient as your furnace - you'll burn more gas to get the same amount of warmth - so you have to really want the ambiance or you have to be willing to turn down the heat in the rest of the house and let the insert heat just the living room....  The other problem is that gas pipes come in different sizes, and a pipe that was big enough to supply gas to a log lighter may not be big enough to run an insert.  You would need to consult a store that sells inserts to be sure.  It is not practical to upgrade to a bigger pipe if the one you have is too small.    Edited: wow, I can't type worth beans tonight...
AA10242680	Hush, please email me, I will walk you through the troubleshooting process. Armed with the proper knowledge, it would be completely safe to do yourself. After you repair the problem, have an electrician buddy come check it for safety. You will save money, and with a thorough inspection by an electrician, you will be ahead of the game.    I WILL NOT tell you whether this or that is the problem, over the years I have learned that electricity itself is fickle, and that human error in the design and manufacturing process of the devices and equipment adds to the unpredictability of it. Don't be fooled, 120 volts is PLENTY to kill you. it takes as little as 5 milliamps of power to stop the human heart. That much power can be found in 1 "D" size battery. The proper process of troubleshooting is tedious, and sequential. The easiest method of testing is to purchase a $5.00 receptacle tester at the local hardware store Wal-Mart carries these too). It is a simple plug-in device used with the power on. It can tell whether the outlet is cross-wired, whether the ground is there or not, and whether the neutral is connected. I would start there first. Please update me on whether this isolates the problem.|`|1b5738a257bf0dcdcf42bd817a1e8692aa	More than likely its a loose wire, probably in the outlet that you tried, but not necessarily.  Its not a short, if it were, your breaker would be tripped.  Its an open circuit.      Just for giggles, shut off the breaker to the outlet you "tested" and remove it from the wall.  Back in the 80's they "discovered" the push connection. (pushing the wire in and having it held in place by what amounts to a chinese finger cuff).  The problem with that is over time, the spring steel fatigues, that and your actual electrical contact is just a small blade.  I much prefer the tedious "screw", as it creates a good ohmic contact, impervious to the effects of time.  I had a friend a few years ago, suffering from a similar problem, I went through and redid their connections which solved their problems.    Your problem is going to be either in the first "dead" outlet in the string (if its the feed side) or the last "good" outlet of the string if its the "load" side.  More than likely, the first outlet of the string will be the one closest to the breaker box.  So start at the "dead" outlet closest to the breaker box and work outward.    Don't forget to shut off the breaker.  110 probably won't kill you, but it isn't comfortable, and why take chances.  220 downright hurts.    PS, unless your in a kitchen or bathroom, the circuit probably isn't GFI protected, as GFI's don't handle high inductive loads well (like vacuum cleaners), so they don't usually use them all over the place.|`|xj5KnGwEaa	The most likely solution is that the wiring is faulty or just died out with use - the wires would have had a short before completely dying, which explains why the outlet had sporadic periods of malfunction before it no longer worked at all. Unfortunately, if it is a problem with the wiring itself, the only way to fix it is to get inside the walls and replace it - unless you're one of those do-it-yourself kind of people, you're probably going to have to hire an electrician.    If anyone has any other suggestions, please advise, as I would like mine to be a last-resort solution.|`|620365b832afe5a28733dcbb58cc2f76aa	Could be a a number of thing from a bad breaker to a bad outlet to a bad ground wire some were.

If you are not adept at wiring, please call a pro. Lives can ,  and have, been lost by attempts to correct a problem just like this. Be safe first, then be thrifty.|`|jW8nfcA6aa	The beginning of the circuit could be loose. The wire to the breaker, the neutral, and the ground should be tight.   What  "cs" says sounds good.

Edit...Removing the Panel Cover can kill you if you fumble it, the 200 Amp Service Wires & connections points are still Hot when the Main breaker is OFF.|`|GFXz4vlSaa	Sometimes several outlets can be "protected" using a GFI outlets further down the line, possibly even in another room.  A good place to start would be to have your wife stay in the room with the lamp plugged in, and go around the house tripping, and resetting all the GFCI outlets.  If the light goes on then you have isolated the GFCI outlet that is protecting that wall.  If it trips again, you may have either a faulty GFI outlet, some bad plugs, or a short somewhere in the line.  Yes it is possible for several outlets to become cracked or damaged inside and stop working.  IF you have the skills to do it, start checking the wires inside the outlet for power using a volt meter.  If you have power but no light, then the outlet is bad.    **** If you are unsure of what you are doing, call an electrician...****|`|AA12246425	are they all GFI'S? is it a old home? if they are all on the same circuit,one bad one could be tripping them all.  unless its near water (bathroom or kitchen) replace them with standard outlets.and/or replace the breaker on the panel box which they are on.good luck|`|AA10232434	shut off the power.... remove the outlet and inspect the wiring, sounds like a loose connection, either the screw on the receptacle itself came loose or one of the wirenuts has loosened, check the one you tried the lamp on first. could be the neutral, could be the hot wire.    imagine if ten outlets were wired in a row, if the wire breaks or comes loose on number two, then everything downstream will not work. you'll have to find where it stopped...    and a voltmeter that gives a numerical reading would help a lot, not one of those "pens" that light up from voltage. they will light up with 10 volts and leave you beating your head against the wall
eglOSPZuaa	Your main sewerage line is blocked. You gotta rope in the authorities there i believe for them to get it checked cos the plumber can help you inside the house not outside it.|`|jSBtdhf0aa	if your water stopped backing up, it could be the vent. i think they are all vented up through the roof. something may be blocking it. go up on the roof and check the pipe. i once had bees build a nest over the pipe under the lird on the pipe. i dont know how they took the odor. better check it out what you are smellinfg is methane gas it is dangerous. i hope this helps.|`|J4W68owgaa	Are you in a cold climate? The sewer vent might be frozen or clogged. It's a pipe on the outside of your house, on the roof that lets the methane gas escape. Also, look at the floor drain, does it have water in it? If it doesn't, add some. It should always have some water in it.    If it's neither of those things, call a plumber asap, the gases causing that smell are dangerous and potentially fatal.|`|KvguovfWaa	well most plumbers work should be guaranteed if they will not stand behind there work than you need to report them to the better business beurea definitley sewage you are smelling call a better plumber|`|wM9Vt4iyaa	check to make sure that the clean out( it's like a cap that you remove to run a snake into )is screwed on all the way the plumber may have forgotten to  do that.|`|62d39e62fb5d002657b2c8a11e5d5cf5aa	Do you have a septic tank?  If so, your septic tank is full, and your drain field is saturated.  Call a septic tank company to drain your tank.  If you Goggle "saturated septic tank", you should be able to find one in your area.    Just so you know, you should do this immediately.  You certainly don't want to take a bath or shower if your septic tank is backed up. Also, look at your buyer's agreement...anything "known" wrong with the house that was NOT disclosed to you before purchase is the responsibility of the previous owner.  Review your documents.  Good luck, hope you're happy in your new home.
xasAaGFaaa	maybe 7 quarters for a big washer, maybe 5 quarters for a dryer for 40 minutes. possibly around 3 bucks. but still the washers and dryers are bigger usually than home ones. and they are ideal for doing multiple loads at once|`|M5XjqI40aa	$2.00 for a top loader, $3.50 for small front loader, $4.50 for large front load washer. $.25 for 5 minutes dryer time, It usually takes about 30 minutes or $1.50.|`|Mvfqsyupaa	It's a LAUNDROMAT.

For one wash and one dry, it could be as cheap as $1.50-$2 (especially in a small town, or in a low-cost neighborhood of a larger city), or cost as much as $4-5 (which is often the price in most parts of Manhattan).|`|F8Qwlvbjaa	aprox. two dollars.|`|4z0Rk4Ddaa	It depends as to where you live.  I live in Michigan and here to use the washer at a laundry mat it can run you anywhere from $1.75-$5.00.  Depending as to how big your 1 load is.  Dryer will run you .25 cents per 7 minutes. (on average it will cost .50 cents---.75 cents to dry 1 load)
XgOIlU0eaa	could be the freon pressures getting too high,causing compressor internal relief valve to open....check your air filter,,clean or replace if necessary...if the cause is other than that,you will need a service tech, not much d-i-y to a heat pump...could also be the fan motor or "rain shield" just above the motor....again not a d-i-y thing........dan|`|JT4OSUPeaa	The "bird cage" is loose and its rubbing against the metal.    Call an A/C guy out because you have to pull it out to fix it. Should be around $100.00 or so to fix.    Do not fix yourself because you could burn up the fan motor if you dont set it in there right. Then it would cost like 4 times as much.    Thank you.    Dan: The freon has nothing to do with the fan motor. A gas would not make a metal rubbing sound. A freon sound is like a Hissss.|`|57502521dc0b77626e264db4b7c3aaf2aa	There is probably a bearing on one of the shafts that needs oil.  Spray every point you can get to with (WD-40) where the shaft enters a housing.  Also oil any drive belt bearings.
28144eb29fc234a2e2c879b5109675a4aa	You might try Lambs Ears.  They have beautiful light furry texture to the leaves and it grows lots of beautiful, small pink blooms.    They do great outside or in.  They like heat...mine are indoors in the winter and they love the dry heat.  Also outside they really take off in the heat.    They don't need much water AT ALL !  So easy to take care of and easy to enjoy !|`|d7769329bd0a2936e9a45b35adc6db88aa	pot|`|nF9DZ0sOaa	Try Peace Lily, also called closet plant.  Just don't overwater it!

Good luck...|`|F8Qwlvbjaa	they are as afraid of you as you are them and also repair the holes where they are coming in.|`|4z0Rk4Ddaa	Throw a bunch of moth balls up in your attic.  Squirrels don't like moth ball and will probably leave your attic so you can go up there.|`|AA12246425	get them out! they can chew on wiring and cause a fire  and their fecal matter is harmful to breathe.look for holes in your soffit or gaps in the attic door(if accesible from out side)small mesh wiring can be bought at a hardware store to cover up openings.traps can also be used baited with peanut butter.best time to go up and avoid them mid day 12am-3pm|`|57502521dc0b77626e264db4b7c3aaf2aa	You had better get them out.  They can cause some serious damage.  Then block the way they are getting in.|`|16e864c8723d0a5a347f97a0ac5d3c6faa	i would just like to add to other good answers given - i have seen over the years that squirrels  often have 2 doors - to get out - you need find them - make a tube out of small chicken wire  1/4 or 3/8 inch mesh  make the tube about 6 to 10 inches long - like a funnel - flare  the large end so you can nail or screw it to the the house over the hole -  make the other end smaller - make the wire stick in around the edge on the other end - ole rocky comes out but he can't get back in.     they will mess a place up     good luck
XgOIlU0eaa	central ac compressors can be damaged if they are turned on when its below 60 degrees outside...if its 55 deg,no big deal but if its way below that,they shouldnt be turned on....dont get mad at this,not being flip,,but can you open the windows a little?,or is that not an option for some reason....you could turn on the ac if it was a heat pump system,,the outdoor unit runs in the winter anyway...technically,you could ice up the indoor coil by running a heat pump in the cooling mode in the winter but i doubt it would run long enough to cause that...if you presently have gas heat and you move to an apt with a heat pump.you can expect to pay more to heat the home in the winter and expect the air coming from vents to only be luke warm,maybe 80-90 degrees when its cold out,,,but it sounds like that wont be an issue for you since you dont want very much heat anyway,,sound like a heat pump would be a good fit for you.....****added later--"thomas" is correct about the low ambient controls for running an ac outdoor unit in the winter but i doubt your maintanance guy could  or would install one,, would also require a "crankcase heater" to be installed on the compressor if it doesnt already have one [most dont] , again i would be surprised if maintanance guy would do that or if management would pay an hvac contracter to retrofit unit with crankcase heater and head pressure/fan control.....dan|`|k0cGzui9aa	AC systems can be used in winter but usually require low ambient controls to be installed. A tech would have to check the particular unit to determine this option.|`|JT4OSUPeaa	It probably has a freon leak and freon cannot be added unless it is over 70 degrees outside temp to charge it properly or your charge will be off and it will freeze the coil.    You might want to check and see if the compressor is coming on outside, the big line will start getting cold.|`|wM9Vt4iyaa	If they are refusing to repair it now you may be able to call some one to repair it and take it off what you owe for rent but you better ask some one who has better knowledge of  apartment leasing|`|F8Qwlvbjaa	go talk to a lawyer and find out if you can get out of the lease. some don't charge fees unless they win and some give out some free advice on the first visit.|`|Dl6NIYt5aa	You need to check this site.

lavd3UHmaa	I lived on vancouver island, and had a large bamboo plant in my backyard planted in soil.  so yes, you can.  If you are planning to plant Bamboo, they do like rocks in their soil, so keep that in mind.  If you are planning to plant in your yard, bamboo is very hardy to say the least.  It will grow farther than you want, and farther than your neighbors want when they realize it is growing hardily into their yard..it is very intrusive.|`|dXrHoLMCaa	yes... lotsa info here...    http://houseplants.about.com/od/typesofh...    Potting Media: In addition to water, lucky bamboo can be grown in a well-drained, rich potting soil. Keep the soil moist, but not soaking. Water as you would any Dracaena species. Fertilizer: Plants grown in water will only need to be fed every other month or so, using a very weak liquid fertilizer. A single drop of liquid fertilizer is plenty for most lucky bamboo arrangements. Alternatively, specialty lucky bamboo fertilizers are available.|`|wX3P9Tlcaa	yes ,in fact you should .it will rot in the water.|`|UMdaHXv7aa	yes you can plant bamboo in rich soil that is fast draining. It will grow in sunlight and can also grow in the shade. When it is time to water the leaves will begin to roll upwards.|`|2HdZRmNsaa	I strongly encourage you to seek expert advice from a local nursery that specializes in bamboo before planting it. Many species of bamboo are highly invasive and will crop up outside of the area in which you plant them. This sounds really nice initially, as you don't have to do a whole lot but keep the plant sufficiently hydrated, but it can cause real issues if it is planted near concrete or stone that has the potential to crack due to invasive roots. It can also spread to a neighbors yard as well which could be a challenging issue. I don't want to discourage you as bamboo is one of my favorite plants and is such a beautiful addition to any garden. You can purchase barriers for the bamboo, but again this should be managed by an expert. Bamboo is also beautiful in large pots and easily maintained as long as it gets lots of sun, water and proper drainage. www.americanbamboo.org is an excellent resource for questions and referrals. Good luck and enjoy!|`|4v7W5SBVaa	yeah. bamboo should not be kept in water..  or are you talking about lucky bamboo?? It can be placed on the soil too.
cSwMlSSUaa	You can try to take a small hammer and SOFTLY  hit the handle on the T &P valve. If this does not work, i would suggest that you replace your water heater. life span is between 7 to 10 years. I dont think it is worth putting any money in a heater that old.|`|jSBtdhf0aa	if the heater is working well i wouldnt replace it just the pressure valve.  you may have hard water. you should exercise the valve about once a month to keep the rust bowed out of it. i put a quart jar under mine and blow it out once a month.  hope this is of some help.|`|JT4OSUPeaa	Go to Home Depot and buy the part called a TPV valve, it's only like between $10-15.    A new hot water heater will run you anywhere between $200-400.|`|4z0Rk4Ddaa	The pressure valve could be bad and you may only have to replace it.|`|fyWGMB9caa	at 16 years of age i wouldn't  put any money into an old tank  .  i would just buy a new one  . but you can try replacing the valve   but why  ?16 years is a long time for a water heater  .|`|KZCUs612aa	Go ahead and replace the valve. Who knows, you might be able to get another couple of years out of old reliable. I've had some units last over twenty years. You might as well drain the tank completely now since you might not touch it again for a year or more. If you do, Oh well you'll be getting a more energy efficient unit then to pay for the $10 pop off valve, and you'll only be out a little of your time.
MhgLNm3daa	The bok choy will produce pods where they flowers were.  They will be about one inch long, and contain small, round black seeds.  Wait until the plant is dead and the pods are completely dry to harvest them- you will drop a few seeds, but you are going to have thousands.    I've had success with bok choy, but keep in mind that it could possibly hybridize with another member of the cabbage family.  I've included a link to a book I plan to read about seed saving- some plants are easy, some not.    You will get more seeds from a single plant than you would from a packet that you buy.  When seed is abundant, you can sow lots of seed and thin the plants later, increasing your odds of success.    Seed saving can save you lots of money.  A serious vegetable gardener will spend over $100 per year on seed.  It is an inexpensive way to provide food, but cutting that cost helps a lot.|`|AA10409603	seed is very cheap from catalogs, so i take it you don't want to just plant bok choy to eat,, but to reproduce the line??   seeds are in the flower heads,, you have to wait until the fllowers are dieing and the petals are falling,, cut the dead and dry flowers and put them in a paper bag,, do not fold the bag closed, but leave it puffed open and just curl the top closed! tie the bags and hang them in a dry place until ready to plant.. shake and shake the bag to seperate the seeds from the flowers,, you may even have to crumple the flower heads in your hands.  the seeds are very tiny though, so be careful...
