20090131181822AA3xiLJ	Dining Out;United States;Portland	New to Portland, need a good bar to watch the Superbowl?	So i just moved to the Portland area (the 'couv to be specific) from, guess where, ARIZONA! Anyways, i'd love to see the superbowl on a nice big high def tv as much as the next cards fan, but i don't really know anyone here yet so i figure my next bet would be a bar. So where do i go? Also if your house is an option i'm down for that too, i hear that people from Portland are really nice

20090131184852AABPMiv	Dining Out;United States;Philadelphia	What is a good cafe to go to in Philadelphia for valentines day ($10-15/person)?	Hi, I have a really romantic day planned in Philadelphia for valentine's day with my girlfriend, (ice skating, sunset watching... the whole deal!).      a problem I have is that I can't find a nice little cafe to eat dinner at. It doesn't have to be fancy or anything, just a nice cute place. I can't spend much on dinner, no more then like 30 bucks total, and even a nice place to get salads/sandwiches would be great. We both like to eat healthy so do try to keep that in mind. Thank you so much! -Nick
