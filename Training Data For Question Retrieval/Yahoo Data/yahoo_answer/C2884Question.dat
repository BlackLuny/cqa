20090202221643AAWxPLJ	Environment;Global Warming	Deniers:  What would it take to convince you?	A few days ago, someone asked what it would take for "believers" in global warming to change their minds, and I responded with a couple of examples.  I thought it was an excellent question, one requiring an answer based on science and not politics, and I'm curious to see some similar answers from the opposing point of view.      I am therefore asking the "deniers" the complementary question:  What evidence would you have to see in order to accept that you are wrong and that human activity is indeed warming the planet?  I'll choose the best answer in a couple of days.

20090203002752AAtoFva	Environment;Alternative Fuel Vehicles	How to efficiency split the water molecule with pulses?	I know some kind of triple pulsing circuit is needed.  I am learning that a big circular coil will somehow attract some energy from the atmosphere, thus I will need less of my own current and amps. Also this pulsing circuit needs to vibrate at the 3 frequencies of water to cause resonance.  So far I have an 8 plate cell with 6"x6" 316L SS plates.  Now what I need is all the knowledge required to make and tune these other components that work together to get the water with KOH (electrolyte) to resonate at those 3 frequencies:  10,???, 20,???, and 42,???.  Can  anybody help?  Anybody studying electrolysis or making free gas from water?  It is a very rewarding adventure.   olgageorge

We very rarely run the heater and theres only one person that lives here. I cook about twice a week, but other than that there is absolutely no other use for the usage. Is 120$ even in the ballpark of how much I should be paying, or is that completely normal
