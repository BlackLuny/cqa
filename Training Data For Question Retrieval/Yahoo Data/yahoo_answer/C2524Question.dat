20090202214620AA2Vqeo	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	Can a couple get a car loan together?	I don't know if this is possible, so here's my situation...   For some reason my credit seems to be messed up.  I checked my credit report, and everything is in good standing, but a month ago I was turned down when I tried to apply for Midas credit card to get my brakes fixed.  Anyway, my wife's credit might be alright, but it's still probably not fantastic.  My car is a piece of crap, so I'm in need of a new one.  I was wondering, is it possible for her and I to go to a dealership and get a loan together upon the average credit of both of us?  Like instead of them just looking at my credit, they evaluate the two of us together as one...?  I hope this makes sense.  If you know of any other way that could help me get a car, please let me know.  Thanks.

20090202215758AA542Vs	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Why is my truck making a grinding noise on the driver side tire?	My 1999 GMC Yukon is making a rubbing/grinding noise on the driver side wheel. It only makes that noise when I drive. I checked and the rubber cover over the cv axle looks fine and so dose the brake pads. There is no bouncing or shaking when I go over bumps, so I'm guessing the shocks are fine.       Can someone help me please!!!

Because, the vehicle had air suspension problem I was advised to change front Air Springs. Now when I drive the car it looks ok, however in parking condition from evening till morning the car falls down. Every morning I need 3-6 minutes to wait while reservuar gets full and lifts the car to normal posistion. I wonder if it is normal? Are these cars designed like waiting 3-6 minutes every morning to have suspension system tidies up and later start to drive?      Thank you in advamce for your answers.

20090202220102AA5YS9L	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Audi	Which car should I get? (A4)?	Hi, I'm getting my first car soon, and we've finally nailed it down to one decision,      The Audi A4,      But I'm just wondering, should I get the 3.2 L one with a V6 and 45,000 miles on it,    or    the 2,0 L with an I4 with 37,000?      They're both the same price, and loaded with the same features.      I do like the I4's color a lot more, it's black / black, which looks good with the red interior lights,      while the V6 is blue exterior / white interior, which looks kinda weird...      Anyways, the V6 is obviously a lot stronger, but I was just wondering if the I4 still has enough power to satisfy.      How fast is the I4 really?   (The guy at the dealership says there really isn't a big difference)      They're both Quattro,   and the I4 does get better gas mileage / cheaper insurance,      So I was just wondering, is the I4 strong enough?    Or should I just go with the V6?

20090202221648AAUtnZk	Cars & Transportation;Car Audio	Why are my speakers distorting?	Ok I have a pair of Infinity Kappa 52.9i, 5 1/4" speakers in the back and a pair of Alpine SPS-13C2, 5 1/4" in the front. The Infinitys are about 3 months old, bought brand new. The Alpines are brand new just came in today. They are both around the same max wattage about 170 i think, and alpines are 35rms and infinitys are 55rms.      The gains on the amp for front and back are about half way and same with the bass. I think it is an aftermarket amp the last guy who had the car put in it, but it seems old. Also my head unit is a Sony (which I heard Sony Xplods suck).      When I turn up the head unit about half way it starts distorting mainly the Infinitys, the Alpines barely you probably can't even notice.      I've tried turning down gain, but then the volume is too low and if I turn it up to get to the previous amount, it still distorts.      What am I doing wrong?

So, I called it in--I wasn't planning on giving my brother's name but somehow I got suckered into telling them he hit me (I was going to say I found it that way). Anyway, they have his name, and now I may need to use the claim after all.      I want to call my claim dept back and tell them I made a mistake with the claim and remove my brother's name from the claim (he can't afford an increase in his monthly bill). Do you think they would let me do that? Keep in mind that no action has been taken on the claim at this time. What if I said: I talked to my brother and he did not do it. Would they buy that? Please let me know, help!!!      (I am also aware that what I am suggesting may be insurance fraud...since I am not 100% sure how insurance claims work, I want to clarify here)

Or does it REPLACE the intake manifold? I'm stumped there.      I timed my car from 0-60 and I got it timed at 13 seconds flat. Its an automatic transmission. Good? Bad? TELL MEH!!

I just bought a car and everything seemed fine on it. I took it to auto zone to have them run the codes before I bought it and all that it pulled up was and Intake air temperature sensor. So today I went and got an oil change. On my way all of the sudden in a matter of seconds it started to over heat by the time I could stop and turn off the engine it was hot. I turned it off and some white smoke came from the engine. After about 10 minutes I checked the water in the reservoir and it was out so I filled it with water then everything seemed fine. It started to get hot again so I turned on my heater and it stayed between half way and 3/4 hot. I checked water again and it was almost out. I checked the oil and there is no milky film. When I first turned my car off there was a hissing sound like as if there was a leak. Anyone have any ideas what it could be? The water is not falling underneath the car it is just gone. Any help would be great. I am hoping it is not a head gasket since I just bought the car. HELP!

I know i'll have to modify the motor mounts and all that and also have to line up the rear sprocket correctly especially if the motor is wider than the original but as i said i'm determined to do it. the question is, what else should i take into consideration?

20090203021825AAyxKkU	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Peugeot 106 choke problem?	Hi,      I have a Peugeot 106 XN Zest 1.1 T Reg (1999) that has recently been running a bit sluggish as well as misfiring on occasion and not pulling away very well when I put my foot down.      I therefore had new spark plugs, HT leads and coil pack fitted yesterday and it now drives much better once it gets going.      However, it still ticks over a bit sluggish when it starts up and I was wondering if it could be a problem with the automatic choke.  I know it isn’t a fault with the Idle Control Valve/Stepper Motor.  I don’t know how I go about rectifying any possible problem with the choke.      It seems to be ok when the car is warm but this morning when it was freezing outside it didn’t start up very well – it could be the weather though :-)      Any thoughts and advice would be much appreciated.      Thanks.   Gareth.
20090203022546AAAbNmE	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	My Car is Leaking Water, What Do i Do?	My 2002 Mustang is Leaking water. Okay so today i accidentally ran over a curb and i didn't think it did any damage so i continued driving my car for 4 hours. After that i parked my car and checked the tire pressure and then i noticed that there was water dripping from underneath my car. It was dripping a lot of first but now it seemed to stop. I didn't have the ac on at all so i really dont think it was that, and i know for a fact its not my radiator because its still completely full. The water leaking from my car was clear and it had no odor. Its coming from the front right side of my car (right behind the right front tire).   What could it be? Is it still safe to drive my car? How much would it cost to fix the leak?

20060630102253AAOAAte	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	96 Dodge Avenger 2.0?	Everytime the key is put in the start position, a 30 amp fuse (Engine) blows.  The car set overnight and started the next day, drove it for a day and the problem came back.  The fuse is located under the hood, driver side, first fuse on the top, left hand side.  I haven't tried a scanner yet, I still trying to get the correct wiring info for the car.  With the starter wire disconnected the fuse will still blow.  With the relay disconnected it will not blow the fuse.  Has anyone had this problem with this car?  Thank You, for your inputs.            Good Luck

It wouldn't be worth much if gasoline became   virtually unavailable.  In all honesty, I would pay over $5 a gallon   and not complain as long as it was widely available.
