20090220133855AA2ow6n	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	What is it with kids these days?	I know not all kids are bad, but the majority of them are rude.       My son is 17 and keeps moaning at me because I won't let him stay at his girlfriend's house.       When I was 17 (I did have a girlfriend) but most of the time I was either at work and when I wasn't in work I was playing football or going to the cinemas, and this was only in 1980!      Why don't kids want to enjoy their childhood? When I was a kid I wouldn't have dared asked my parents if I could drink alcohol, watch 18 rated films or stay at my girlfriend's house, neither would my friends or my girlfriend.       Why have times changed so much?
20090220133850AA0dJzw	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	40 weeks + 1 day, not sure if I will know when its time...?	As of Wednesday, I was not dialated at all. I go back on Monday and if nothing has progressed, they will schedule a day later in the week for me to be induced. As far as I know, I have not experienced many contractions. If I think I am having one, it feels like she is pushing her feet into my stomach so I dismiss it as her movement. Last night, however I was lying in bed and I just suddenly felt so much pressure in my back and stomach like I needed to use the bathroom. I just felt like I needed to push! I sat on the toilet but nothing really happened. It was hard to find relief. I fell asleep and when I woke up, I still felt the pressure. I had to continually take in deep breaths and that helped some. Today, my back hurts and my right hip and groin area hurt but I don't feel anything else, really. What does it sound like to you guys? Just gastrointestinal pain or what? Thanks for advice.

I've been through the tantrums with my older one and i can deal with this stuff with me, but not sure how to handle when the younger one hits his older brother.  i try to let them handle it, the older one usually yells at him 'no', but now he's starting to push him or (lightly) smack him back.  i'm not sure how to handle it.  can't let the older one just have to deal with it, but i don't want to teach either of them that hitting each other is ok.  any advice from moms that went through this? thanks!

20090220135618AAnxaLy	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	Why do people always assume ADD is the reason?	My 6 year old daughter is in the 1st grade. She has been having problems at school..so the teachers says. We do not notice any of the things she says goes on at school here at home.       She says she is having trouble paying attention in class. She doesn't follow directions and can't remember what was talked about. Like today when I got a call it was because she said Rosa Parks was bad becasue she didn't give up her seat for another person to sit down..that what the teacher said she said in class..but here at home last night she was able to tell me who Rosa Parks was and why she did not want to give up  her seat on the bus. And when they did a word game using magnets on a dry erase board..instead of putting the magnets on the board she stuck them to the legs of her chair.."to see if they would stick"      I have NO problems like that with her here at home. I can sit down with her in the afternoon and tell her what all her homework is and she will sit at get it done.       She has picked up..what I feel is bad behavior from school..becasue we do not do things like this at home. She will her toher sisters to "shut up" (we don't use that at home)..she will tell them she hates them when she is angry. that she won't be their friend any more if she doesn't get what she wants, she has become selfish and talks back. All these things we have never had problems with until she started 1st gread!!      She drew on the bathroom wall at school yesterday..2 days before I got an e-mail saying she tried to pull the little boy in front of her while walking , pants down. My daughter said he had her book and wouldnt give uit to her, that his pants were baggy and falling so she thought if she pulled on then he would drop her book to grab his pants.      It seem like ever week I am getting e-mails or notes or call on something she has done at school..or hasn't done..none of which I see here at home.      She was a well behaved child until she started school this year....now they are wanting to have her checked to see if she has ADD.  I have read about the issue and see non of that in my daughter..what should I do??

For 4 weeks I was at 1cm 50% effaced and -3 station.    Today the doctor checked my cervix which has FINALLY dilated to what she called "2-3" but my cervix is still around 50%, and also she said that the baby's head is lower, but she didn't say the station number.   She told me to expect my bloody show, I've already lost my mucus plug 2 days ago, because when she pulled out her fingers from the exam they were all bloody, which I hear is normal, just hasn't happened for me before, my cervix has been checked 3-4 times, and I also have never bled after sex, even last night.   That was around 10:30 this morning, it's now 12:30 and I'm still bleeding a little, and the blood is mucusy. Do you think that it is my bloody show? I kinda thought it would be one bloody glob, but this is smaller bloody globS.   Also, how long after your show did you go into labor?   Thank you!

20090220141346AAfdpUR	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Do you think kids should be encouraged to cry?	It seems to be pretty common for adults to tell kids, especially boys, not to cry. When I was a kid, I was raised with the traditional "Boys don't cry" rule. Ultimately, I think that causes more problems since boys are not allowed to express their feelings or get an emotional release.      Any woman that complains that their man never expresses himself or shows his true feelings, this is probably why.      Would it be better if kids are encouraged to cry?

20090220143504AAEDNIH	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	Which name do you prefer:  Dorothy or Maeve?	Dorothy is an English name, from the Greek for "gift of God".      Maeve is a name from Irish mythology that apparently means "intoxicating". It seems to be a form of Mab, the Queen of the Fairies. It's pronounced MAYV.      Do you like the English Christian name or the Irish pagan name better?

We are 11 weeks. We first saw the heartbeat at 6 weeks and heard it at 6 weeks 4 days. I work at the hospital so I have had several ultrasounds. At 10 weeks we saw the baby, perfect in size, with a heartbeat of 175 and moving around like crazy. I have a history of some spotting due to a small blood clot that formed when the embryo attached to the uterus but the dr said that it was nothing to worry about. I am not currently spotting. I know I'm just stressing because we are so close to the 12 week "safe" mark, but I'm worrying myself. Anyone have any thoughts? I can always go tomorrow to have another ultrasound done but I don't want to drive people nuts by taking advantage of it!  :)

My boyfriend and I were having anal sex for the first time. We're one the younger side, so we were both virgins prior to this. Within a minute, he removed himself because he was not wearing a condom and was about to ejaculate. He basically ejaculated on my lower back. He cleaned it up while I didn't move, but to be safe, I went up the bathroom and took a towel and cleaned it myself, moving away from my vagina. I really don't think anything even touched my vagina, but do you think there is ANY chance I'm pregnant? I haven't got my period yet, but I wasn't really keeping track of when it was supposed to come because I am a virgin.

I'll not eat much for a week or two then pig out the next...I have been very bloated though for about a month.. uncomfortable bloating (pressure like feeling). but it could also be due to the fact that I've been binge eating and have been drinking lots of sugary stuff like pop and juice and coffee, or from my short period?? not sure.... I'm praying that i am not because I can't stay pregnant for no longer then 3months i always end up mascaraing I've had one successful pregnancy (when i first ever got pregnant) and 6 miscarriages,I have never found out why.

20090220145315AA3WBH0	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Why is this the case?	Why do American man say that 75 percent of American woman interfere with there parental rights and are unfair to the father.  25 percent of American woman say that man are treaded unfairly by family court and discriminates against man.  Most women who are born out side the US fall in the 25 percent category.  40 percent of American woman admit interfering with the fathers parental rights even when it is court ordered.          This is why many women can't find a husband even if they are in the 25 percent that don’t with father rights.  Men don’t want to pay court order child support and presume that every woman will make him do this.  Because of this many woman have to use a sperm donor to have a child with no legal father.  This is especially many highly educated career women.         They are paying the price for those selfish women who only want child support from the father.  Every man automatically they want to have a relationship with presumes they are the same way, but are not.

20090220151824AAFMqTQ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Have any of you experienced this? 10 points to the best answer?	I am 9 days late and all i have had was brown spotting that lasted about 4 days. It was so light i never even had to put on a pad or anything. I went to the dr last tuesday and he said that i looked ok and he gave me a blood test which came back negative. He told me to treat my body as if im pregnant and come back bin two weeks if nothing has changed. well i quit spotting that day and havent had anything since. My dr said it takes some women a while to build up enough hormones to get a positive hpt. My husband and i are ttc and it is a little hard for me to "pretend" im pregnant. Have any of you taken 2 weeks or longer after a missed period to get a positive hpt? Or know some one that has? I need some words of encouragement....THANKS

I've been on the pregnancy site for hours now and on the right hand side an advertisement pops up and it is a picture of animal cruelty. I can't handle poor innocent animals being hurt or mistreated in anyway. I try not to look at it but it always catches my eyes. I have a little chihuahua (Marshall) and I can't imagine anything like that ever happening to him. What is wrong with people and why do they do the things they do. I just don't understand the reasoning behind it all. I am sorry if i wasted your time I just needed to vent.

I try to include my son in many things with the twins like diaper changes, feedings, reading them books and tummy time but when I am busy with them and he is just playing he tends to not listen to me and get into things that he shouldnt be getting into (dishwasher, climbing on changing table or kitchen table etc.) The other day he took his pull-up off and climbed in the babys bassinet and pee'd in it even though he knows he needs to pee in the toilet. I am trying to be very patient with him but with him not listening, it gets very frustrating. I raise my voice to be stern but not to yell. Does anyone have an ideas or suggestions. Thank you

20090220150402AAolhfc	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	What do you do with a kid who constantly thinks he being abused?	Here's the story   My 9 yr. old thinks people hit him all the time. If he's in a bad mood or thinks he's going to get in trouble for something, he'll ALWAYS get "hurt" - one time he was sent to his room and was walking there like a snail so I put my hand on his shoulder and pushed him along while saying "faster, please" and he yelled, "Why'd you shove me?!"  About a year and a half ago, he was talking loudly early in the morning and was waking up his father repeatedly. His father asked or told him to stop talking and by the fifth or sixth time, he (Dad) got angry and grabbed him by the shoulders and moved him to a wall because he (son) was writhing so much and talked VERY sternly close to his face. Later that day at school, he told his teacher that his father had hit him and thrown him against the wall. So - later in the week we had a visit from Child Protective Services.   Anyway-  today, it was when he refused to eat his lunch (that he requested) and I finally told him to just go lay in his bed awhile. He sat, refusing to budge and I walked toward him to take his arm to start him on his way and he jumped up out of the chair and screamed "Don't hurt me, Go away! Don't hurt me!"    He does not go to day care or have babysitters and rarely is anywhere other than school and home. He seems to have a twisted view on what being "hit" or "abused" is.    He's actually my step-son (since he was 4) his mom is a prescription drug addict but hasn't had a crash in a little over a year now and his father is a calm person who will not hurt anyone.      what do I do with this?

20090220145316AALTRNV	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	A recurring cough in a three year old?	When my daughter was two and a half she came down with bronchitis. Once that had cleared up she had a cough which lasted quite a while. She would wake up at night coughing and it would be so bad that she would throw up from not being able to breathe properly. It went away but then came back every couple of months or so. It's always the same, she starts coughing at night, chokes on phlegm, throws up, usually has a high temperature of 39.5c (whilst on nurofen or panadol).   She was diagnosed by four different doctors with asthma. The inhaler didn't do a single thing and we don't think it's asthma because it isn't constant and she doesn't get out of breath when she does activity. I eventually saw a doctor who said no it isn't asthma. The cough is mostly just at night. She has had chest x-rays and they are all clear. I even had her tested for leukaemia because...well just because. We were thinking maybe croup but the cough isn't a barking cough. She didn't have the cough for about 4 months but now three days ago it has come back again, along with the high temps. (it is hot where we are but she has been getting it from Winter through to Summer - weather doesn't sem to matter) She is also a lot more sleepy than usual but I think that's because of the high temps. I don't know what to do. The doctors don't seem to have any answers but it is obviously something as it keeps coming back!    Does anyone have any idea what it could be?

SO, I am going back to work after taking 19 months off to be a stay at home mom for my son (5) and my daughter who is now 18 months. The company I work for has it's own daycare for employees only, so it is a very small, very good daycare. My son went there before I quit my job. He loved it and I loved it. However, I am a little worried about my daughter starting daycare. She is what I consider a very "girly" girl. She likes things "her" way,  as much as her dad and I try to direct her toward being a nice little girl who likes to SHARE, she doesn't like to!!  She can be mean sometimes, hitting (not hard, but that's not the point), she throws fits, she screams.  Now, this is not something that happens all the time, but definately enough that you notice it! So, I'm a little worried about leaving her for the first time. I don't want her to give her new teachers such a hard time.  What are some things I can do to prepare her, and what are some things I can do to prepare the teachers??

20090220144237AAfrIVt	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Why am I emotional, having nosebleeds, breast growth, secondary amenorrhea and cramps?	The doctor has put me on the pill as diagnosis but I can't start it until I get my next period apparently... which has been nearly 5 months ago - and the last one was skanty at best - 2 days.    In the mean time I'm emotional, having regular small nosebleeds, breast growth (from a C cup to an E), secondary amenorrhea and cramps. I'm annoyed I spend every night crying thinking why is this happening to me, I cannot get pregnant, I can either have regular cycles, (whilst going against the doctors advice and ruling out any chance of pregnancy) or I can go without and deal with the consequences above and hope and pray me and fiance get some sort of miracle baby. Doctor won't help us other than to say we have all the time in the world and my hormones may adjust themselves in time... and to keep waiting for that period.   I am spending ridiculous amounts of money on pregnancy tests each month (last one was took in middle of January) and deep down inside I'm beginning get distressed over the issue. My mother has known my doctor since she was born and says she will press for me to have an ultrasound scan of her ovaries to check for cysts like she did when she was in her twenties, and my fiance says he loves me no matter what, but I'm beginning to get distressed over the fact that I'm stuck in a rut.   Any ideas on what might be wrong with me or what I can do to calm down about this?   I'm not overweight, I excerise regularly, I've even changed my diet over the past few weeks so it's a lot more healthy and balanced, I'm avoiding emotional and physical stress (except for this, ironically) and until today I've been coping okay... but over the past week my symptoms have gotten so bad I just feel like falling apart over this.   Any help or advice from people is welcome.

20090220152434AA9nDea	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Pregnancy Dilemma, moms and dads please help!?	My husband and I have been married for almost a year. He is deployed at the moment and is ready to try having a baby when he comes home. I am terrified, I want to have a child with him but the whole process of giving birth and raising a little human being who will one day be 40 years old with a family of their own scares the crap out of me. But I personally do not want to have a kid while he is deployed so we will have one year time frame when he comes home from this deployment to have one before he is deployed again. But I go back and forth with if I am ready to or not. Sometimes I have the strong urge to and other times I want to wait a little longer.      I know that having a kid will change EVERYTHING and I am scared that I will be a bad mom, I know he will make a great dad. Are all these feelings normal, will they disappear? How do I get myself ready for such a big decision? How do I get past the "dont get pregnant" attitude that I had since before I got married, I think it was so ingrained into my head, since I had lots of friends get prego when they werent ready and now I am having a hard time turning that off.       Advice from parents who have been through all of this would be great.

20090220161951AAlvNVH	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	My four month old possibly teething?	My daughter just turned four months old last week and I brought up teething to her pediatrician and she said that teething is not as bad as everyone makes it out to be and that it doesn't hurt when a tooth comes in. She asked me if when I was 5 did it hurt when my permanent teeth were coming in and I said no, but does it really bother a baby a lot more? I felt that she was making me feel kind of stupid to think that my daughter's random screaming spurts every week was due to teething. Just yesterday she was up from 7:45pm screaming and did not stop until 7 the following morning. I ended up taking her to the ER because she was not responding to tylenol and could not consoled. I was uncertain if it were her ears, teething, or even a reaction to the vaccines she received last Tuesday. The doctors told me that she was fine. I am a first-time mommy and hate to see my daughter like this. She doesn't sleep, the other day she had a minor fever of 99.4 and after tylenol it went back to normal and has since been normal, she had a little bit of a runny nose, won't sleep, won't sleep without me or her father, won't lay in her crib, has become a light sleeper-we don't have to move, she will wake up screaming. I don't know what is bothering her, but I know something is not right. She used to sleep all night now we are lucky if she sleeps at all. Am I wrong to think it is teething? Any other mothers dealt with the same thing?

20090203051620AApG2zs	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Is is wrong to sleep with my daughter's 8th grade Algebra teacher in order to get her a passing grade?	First let me say I'm a single mother. So I would not be cheating on my husband. I've had to go to several parent-teacher meetings due to the fact that my daughter is flunking Algebra. Her teacher is always coming on to me, and while he has not outright said he wants to sleep with me, he is always suggesting something of the sort. I'm not really attracted to him, but I'm pretty sure if I sleep with him, he will be a little more lenient with my daughters grade, and help her pass the class.I'm hoping I'll just have to do it the one time. Hopefully, I'll even be able to wrangle an A or a B out of it. I want my daughter to do well, and I'll do anything to ensure that. My friend told me it wasn't really ethical, but sometimes ethics are a gray line. Can someone lend me a little moral support?

It started out heavy, then about a week later started coming at a medium pace. Then it stopped about 2 weeks later. It was gone for about 3 days, then out of no where, it comes back. It's still brown blood so its old. It starts coming out for about a week, then it stops again for another 2 or 3 days. Then it comes back.       It has been brown periodic bleeding up until about 2 weeks ago. I was really stressed and cleaning house and was standing up. And out of no where, I felt it coming out. It came back with a vengeance. It was a very bright red. I bled for 1 day like that, then it stopped for a day, then came back very heavy a day later. And I've had the same constant bright red blood for the past 4 days now. It starts to ease up a little each day, but then out of no where, I will just feel a huge blood clot spill out.       Can anyone please shed some light. I desperately need to stop spending so much money on pads, and I really want sex. Not to mention, it's disgusting and painful.      Thanks in advance.

First my period started on the 12th of Jan. and ended on the 17th. The flow was normal and nothing seemed unusual. Around the 27th I started to have very strong soreness in my breasts. I have tried to do a bit of research but cant seem to find the answers. My husbands mother who is a nurse said it can happen because of caffeine however I don't think I have consumed any more or less caffeine then usual. My husband and I are not TTC but are not on birth control and practice sex on a regular basis. I read that it can happen to some women during ovulation however this is not normal to me. If this was the case how long does it typically last? I am now 9 days before period with still very sore breast. They are so sore to the touch that I cannot even lay on them without feeling pain. Also the last two days I have been having flu like symptoms such as fatigue and sore neck and just my entire head hurting. I am really stumped for answers so besides waiting it out to take a pregnancy test.. are their any other reasons to match up with my symptoms? Thanks so much for all your help in advance!

I dont deserve this right?	omg omg omg!!!!! someone i need advise really fast! ok, i go to a dance school in nevada and it can use corporal punishment if ur parents sign a permission form, and mine did! omg, ok so there are a lot of "clicks" in dance and like we do crazy stuff like pants other girls, give each other wedgies, etc. and ok, theres this shy loser girl in dance who just annoys me so i pantsed her (we can wear shorts to dance not just leotards) and by accident i pulled down her panties too!! omg she started to cry and then the teacher saw and of course the snitch told on me!!!!!!!!! omg, im so scared, the teacher (who's a woman luckily) sent me into the changing room and told me that i have to sit out for the day in the changing room and then she's going to "teach me a lesson" as she said!!!!! OMG, this is a private dance school so theres no such thing as being suspended and so you can only be expelled so i was begging her to not tell my mom or expell me, so the teacher told me that i had two choices: either i would get expelled (and mom finds out) or i would have to get "taught a lesson" but my teacher wouldnt tell my mom about this. so that i could participate in dance next time and not be in trouble! i chose to get the lesson taught because if i got expelled my mom would be paying for nothing and then id get grounded for like months and probably taught a lesson by her too! omg, what's going to happen to me? do i deserve this? will she make me take the lesson in my panties so i learn it better, or whatever? will the loser girl be there?? omg help!! dance ends in a bit over an hour and fifteen minutes, and right now im on a friends laptop in the changing room. she she lives right next to the studio and showed the class this dance video that she made with her old dance school. anyway, please help, omg!!!!!!!!!!1

My little man turns 1 at the end of the month and isn't walking yet (don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to rush him; just curious about other babies).  He cruises on furniture and walks (on his tippy toes lol) with a push-walker toy.  He has been pulling up to standing since 8 months old but very rarely lets go of furniture to stand on his own.  He's been crawling since he was 7 months old so he's pretty efficient at that lol!

20090220155054AAgP50g	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	LMP vs Ultrasound??? What is more accurate?	My lmp was on August 28th. I was on the pill, so it lasted a normal 4 days then I started the new pack on that Sunday. Well on the 3rd day of taking thwm I started bleeding super super heavy. No pain or anything. Just a ton of blood. And this lasted 4 days. Non stop heavy bleeding. Well after the first day of heavy bleeding I stopped taking my pill cause I thought it was my body just doing its thing. I never went to the doctor, cause I was in no pain. Well it stopped on September 6th. I had unprotected sex on September 7th..then not again till September 13th, and then like evryday from the 17th till the 22nd. (my bf and I just moved back in with each other) And well my next period would have been on September 25th. It never came, so I took a pregnancy test...got a negative. So I waited until October 5th. Took another one and it was negative. So then on October 7th I took one in the morning and at night. Still a negative. Then I waited and took one 9th and it was a fait positive..took one agin 3 hours later and it was a bit darker. So I knew I was preg. Went to the doctor and theres came out positive too.       Well. based on my lmp my due date is June 4th which is what the clinic gave me.   Well I went and had an ultrasound done and they told me there wasnt anything there and though it was an etopic preg. They tested my hgc and it was going up..so I went to another hosiptal and had an ultrasound done where I was super early and it put my due date at June 15th. Well I went to another hosiptal who dated my due date at June 16th. Well I had about 6 ultrasounds from 2 different doctors before my 12 week mark, and they all dated me at June 15th as my due date. And now at 23 weeks she is dating June 15th still. So based on ultrasounds she right on..but its some what off from my lmp. Based on my due date of ultrasound I got pregnant at around the time my next period was due to come. But based off my lmp I got preg a day after that crazy bleeding. Im confuced and need some advice. Its been on my mind.

No period in january......No period yet for febuary. My nipples get sore off and on, dizzyness, moodswings, abdominal pain that feels like shooting electricity, same in my breast, and being tired all the time. I know I know what you guys are going to say. Take a test!!! But have any of you ladys ever been thru that time in your life when you try to get pregnant and get let down? Then when you finally miss a period it is hard for you to get the nerve up to go to the doctors cuz you dont want to be let down? So you wait till you miss a period.

I keep hearing/reading that it is normal for newborns to have that, but it really worries me sometimes. I have taken him to the doctor many times because it scares me sometimes. His nose seems so dry and sometimes it seems like no air is going in. When he sleeps sometimes it seems like he is trying to breath and gasps for air, then after a few seconds he can breath again. I tell this to the doctors but they all say it is normal and he shows no signs of distress. Of course he isn't doing it while I am at the doctors, and it may just be newborn congestion but it still just worries me, expecially with SID's being talked about so often. I use saline and have just read about using breastmilk and have yet to try that. We bought a humidifier to help with the dryness, but he is still congested and having funky breathing. My question is was your newborn like this or do you know anybody's that was? How long did it last for you? What other things did you try to help with your babies nose? I may just be a paranoid mom, but I just want my baby to be able to breath easy. It worries me when he struggles and nothing goes in. It's only for a few seconds, but my heart sinks each time. I know I am probably driving the doctors crazy ( I have gone to two different doctor ) but I just want to make sure. He is a healthy baby, just lots of congestion and funky/troubles breathing. Just hoping to hear some stories of similar newborn congestion and find out when it went away or how you helped your baby breath better.

I have had two appointments so far and during the second one, I was kept in the room waiting for 45 minutes only to have her come in and ask if I was feeling any pain, and then listening to the babies heart beat. She said she did not need to measure me (which I thought was always expected at each visit). Am I being too hard on her? She also didn't tell me any of the results of my pap (so I am assuming everything is fine). I am already 20 weeks according to ultrasound, or 18 weeks according to doctor no personality.

I go to a normal doctor appointment that morning then get admitted that night.   I'm curious as to what they will do, I know I'll get my answers that morning.      But do you think she'll still use the suppository, or no because I'm already 3 cm. This is my second pregnancy. I went natural at 40W2D.      How was being induced for you? How long did it take?

He has a horrible grin and laughs at me and my friend (the girls litte sister) because we go across the road too ignore him talking to us. When i get home he is standing outside my house obviously pretending the dog is sniffing when it is actually straining to go on its walk.

20090220153235AAr44zf	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	3 months pregnant with moderate dysplasia?- please help?	I am 21 years old and am 3 months pregnant. When i went in for my first pregnancy exam, they did a pap smear, which also happened to be my first pap smear. When i went to my second exam just a few days ago, they told me that all of my blood work from lab came back normal, but my pap smear showed abnormal cervical cells. At that time, the dr. did a colposcopy, and took a biopsy. He told me at the time that he thought i had what looked like mild dysplasia. I got a call today from my dr. to review my biopsy results and he told me that i had Moderate dysplasia, not Mild. He didnt really tell me much other than that. He never said anything about me having HPV, and never even mentioned HPV at all actually. The dr. never even said if the biopsy was safe for baby or not, and i have read that some people say its not safe. I am just wondering if I have HPV, or would have they told me that? how do they test for it? and will i have a healthy pregnancy and baby? will i have less of a chance of having kids in the future? sorry for all the questions, its just i am so puzzled.
20090220152351AAA5ngC	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	My 31 month old son shows no interest in potty training, what should I do?	He's nearly 32 months old, he and I don't have the best communication, he talks a little when he wants to.  I know he's humoring me while sitting on the potty.  All the tricks I've read online don't change his view.  When he does a BM, I instantly take him to the potty and potty topper and put it in.  He will sit there, won't pee as I tell him to, play with the toilet paper, and flush the toilet (get scared), want to get off, and we're done.  Running water doesn't work.  Stickers don't work.  He doesn't tell me when he's wet (he rather let it sag or fall out, yes, ew)....I feel hopeless.  I tried a week solid multiple times a day, he shows zero progress.  I have heard kids can be potty trained already and we've barely gotten anywhere. I just want to give up and keep him diapers forever....even when he's 18 (just kidding).        When he poops, he runs away from me and plays a chasing game.  He thinks everything's funny....doesn't want to please us but a few times a day to try to 'help' fix something/etc.          He's still in diapers, sz. 6 but they're getting tighter day by day.  I just put him in a pull-up and showed him the CARS front of it.  He's barely interested.  I showed him the PULL-UP DVD.  Should I switch to Pull ups full time, if he shows zero interest in potty?  When do you do it/how do you know he's ready?      (I still have a good amount of Pampers and generic diapers left)...can I slowly use them up with Pull ups? I hate to waste them.        If it helps, he's also adamant and won't cooperate (terrible 2's), he refuses to walk to the high chair or walk outside in the cold (we have to carry him outside).  Is this okay??      Thank you....sincerely.

20090220152457AAQ95Vy	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Off birth control 1mo...pregnancy symptoms or pms?	So here's my story....I went off birth control last month after being on it for many years. I had my last period around Jan 26-30 like a Mon-Sat. Hubby & I had sex that Sunday and 2 or 3 more times over the next week and a half and I had some spotting for a few days, then we did it several times over Valentine's wknd-feb 13-15. I was having some twingy pains on the right side of belly but we went for one more time last night-Feb 19. Sorry if too much info, lol.....During last wknd I kept getting really exhausted and dizzy, I have been going to the bathroom like crazy and I'm only slightly nauseous off and on past week but today it seems a bit worse. I took a test 3days ago and it was negative-just too early to test? Or am I just experiencing PMS? My period is due Sunday or Monday if it follows same pattern from being on pill. I feel kinda crampy like my period will start any minute but nothing yet. Also I have had the weirdest sinus drainage in my throat every morning for the last 2wks when I wake up, but I don't feel the slightest bit like I have a cold. Any inisight and personal experiences or opinions are appreciated....I know the only way to know is to wait, but I'm just curious in the meantime!! ~thanx

Every five minutes I check for my period am I being paranoid or am I pregnant I was going to wait until Friday to take a test and make it official.
