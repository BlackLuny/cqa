If I have a kid, I want it to have cool initials, like M.A.D or P.H.D... something that would be neat. My last name is Emms, so e would go on the end. My name is James, so it would be cool if he could have my first name as well.      What would you name your kid if you wanted it to have neat initials, and had to end with an "E"?
20090202214453AAepb4d	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I'm 5 days late and have take 5 home pregnancy test and 2 came out positive and the others came out negative?	I know false positives are rare. I had what I believe may have been implantation bleeding 2 days before my missed period.  Then the day after my missed period I took an EPT Certainty test (digital) and it came out positive (1st morning pee) I was shocked so I took 4 more test ( I know , I know, but the 2nd one came out negative so i took another and then another so on...) anyhow  my brest hurt and I'm extremely tired so I know something is going on especially since I'm  now 5 days late. My concern is that I might have an ectopic pregnancy or possibly a miscarriage. I had a ectopic pregnancy 2 years ago and my tube burst, so I terrified that it's going to happen again. I made a DR's appointment but have to wait a few days. So I was wondering if anyone has come across this before...

20090202215549AAU8lWB	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Question about my 14 month old son's diet?	Well my little man is 14 months (12 corrected) and he has:      eggs and toast or waffles or some kind of warm cereal for breakfast with 2 oz of OJ and 5 oz of milk.      Mid morning snack- A fruit snack      Lunch he had lunch meat (he loves turkey and ham), cheese and 5 oz of juice      Afternoon snack- Gerber puffs (the "cheetos" or puffs)      Dinner he has whatever I'm making for myself and daddy. and 5 oz milk      He always has oatmeal before bed because he has a bit of a stretch between dinner and bed time.      My son is 31.5 inches long and 23lbs. He looks like he could use to gain a couple pounds, but his doctor said he has just the right amount of fat on him...Well when his shirt is off and he's stretching for something, I can see his little ribs....      Am I feeding him enough or do you think the doctor may have been wrong? Mommy opinions.    Thanks~
20090202215512AAGUtLH	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	What do you think about this?	I started my period on the 13th of January, it was over on the 17th. I had unprotected sex with my boyfriend on the 22nd, he ejaculated inside. On the 30th i experienced mild cramps and spotting (which has never happened to me), I was worried this may be implantation bleeding. I don't have any other pregnancy symptoms besides tiredness and fatigue. I know it's too soon to test, do you think i might be pregnant?

20090202215456AAakQR1	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Is a hotel room clean enough for a newborn?	I am 34 weeks with my first baby and living with my dad and sm right now because I moved out of my ex's place after I found out I was pregnant and he decided to keep drinking and smoking pot.  I am 24 and he is 32.      He's changed and is coming when the baby's born (he lives a state away) and plans to stay for ten days or so.  I am fine with this and looking forward to seeing him.  My dad even said he could stay in one of the spare rooms when he's here.      However, I want some time alone with him and the baby without them barging in every twenty minutes to see her, etc.  I know it's their house so I don't have much choice so I suggested we split a hotel room for the first week....      He doesn't want to do that because he thinks hotel rooms are dirtier than the house.      Is a hotel room clean enough for a newborn?  I thought it would be since it gets cleaned every single day whereas the house maybe a couple times a week.

20090202215217AAiusVG	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	I want children, he doesn't...?	Okay, soooo... we all want children at one point right? Well at least most of us want children. I love children, I just adore how sweet and innocent they can be, and my boyfriend on the other hand just despies the "little rascals". I want children of my own eventually. I know i'm young right now but i won't be young forever. And yes there is a great chance that he and I won't work out. He doesn't hate children, but he just doesn't want any of his own, he believes that he would be a violent father, which i would disagree because i have never seen that man mad and i have been with him for 2 years. We've fought several times over this issue and we still can't come to a decision. I still want children and he doesn't. I can either leave him, or i can stay with him and not have children. My friend suggested that i take some time to myself and think and when i'm ready i'll be ready to make an actual decision. I'm starting to wonder if i really want kids. I love this man, he makes me happy... not all the time but majority of the time. He's sweet, he cares about me so much. Another thing is that he wants a vasectomy, and that's what got me a little more worried. I figured that once we're together he would see that we could be parents but i suppose not he's pretty set on the idea of not having children at all. I asked him if he would reconsider in the future, and he said probablly not. I got him to reconsider on the vasectomy for now, but he said if we ever break up he's going to get one done. Another thing is that, if we did decide to break up, the chances are we won't talk so it'll be like losing a bf and a great friend as well. I really don't want to break up with him, but i also want kids, i think ... i don't know what to do anymore. What do you think i should do?      I refuse to get pregnant on person, or leave him and get pregnant with another guy.
20090202215934AAnT6rV	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	I got kicked out tonight and i'm worried about alot of things, help?	Well we argue almost every night and if you look at my previous question you can see ive been having alot of troubles with him at home (my grandpa), my dad lives 3 hours away and i wouldn't want to live with him, living with my mom is not an option, but i have a friend i can live with who said a week ago if things get bad enough i can move in with him (his dad suggested it actually), im 16 years old just turned 16 and tonight we got into an arguement because my schooling isn't doing too well, i lost a $300 cell phone i just got 2 weeks ago, and he doesn't like my friends (the only friends i have) or their families. He doesn't seem to trust me and i argue with him when he walks into my locked room without even knocking (by picking my lock), and i started locking it in the first place so he couldn't walk in on me and i hate it! As if yelling at me about losing the phone will help when im already so worried about what he will do i just about cry, and he just makes things worse. Then tonight we got into a bad arguement about something and he threatened to kick me out like he usually does but this time he was forcing me to pack my suitcase and leave with only my clothes, i said id happily leave if i had a source of transportation and my computer so i could continue education but after that he would not talk to me all night, id like to leave tomorow and id like to know what everyone else thinks, im sitting here on my computer crying right now and i don't know what to do.

20090202215706AAcLkwt	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	9 month old wants less and less to do with his bottle/formula?	My almost 9 month old is wanting his bottle less and less and I'm getting him used to the sippy cup.       BUT I don't know if he's not wanting the bottle because he is being introduced to so many new flavors of foods and doesn't like the formula anymore. Or maybe there is just so much going on, he just wants to play. If I set him in his crib with it, he will drink it but I don't like leaving him out just so he will drink his formula. I have tried putting formula into the sippy cup but he's just getting used to it.       Is this normal? It has to be too soon for milk, right?       What are some ways I can get him interested in the formula more or make sure he's getting enough while still introducing him to foods?      Just anything in general or basic. Any ideas and is this normal? I know formula is best for him for the first 12 months but is there a time he's ready to move on from it - just out of curiousity?

This time only 3 days. Even if I was pregnant i would only at the very least be 2 weeks along, which I know is too early to tell. The first time I was pregnant I had a feeling because I was two weeks late, I am just wondering if my period is out of wack, or maybe I am pregnant. Any advice?

Will I just have to wait until my next period a month from now, or what should I do to find out?

Well over the summer, this girl and I became really good friends but she was a bad influence on me and always had a negative energy. So long story short in 2009 I made a resolution to not be her close friend anymore because she was ruining me. Well we went through this whole fight about how I was changing and how our friendship was ruined. Well we ignored each other for 2 weeks and then I decided to say something. Now she wants to be friends again and start fresh, but the thing was I felt so free and alive without her being in my life, but once we started talking I felt weighted down and guilty.      I'm generally not a mean person, so I can't just tell her I don't want to be friends .I really don't. But I was nice to her and was like "how are you? bla bla bla" Even though I hate it and feel guilty. So what should I do? Even if were casual friends I don't anything to do with her because I feel weighted down. But I don't want to be mean and just like completely cut her off cause I think she thinks were okay now.       Any advice?

20090202223227AAWRwL0	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	I know that they say that non-parents are "experts" at parenting they say until they become parents...?	but I think that since I have raised my baby sister from the time she was born that I have always had a great sense of reality of what a child brings and how they act and what to do based on my own instincts. I know my own child(ren) will be a lot different but I see some people and how they raise theirs and I just know that I won't do those certain things. But they say that it's so much easier said than done but I feel that like I said, apart from "mothering" my sister for nearly 20 years, that I have in sense had one child already. I know that I want my children to behave in public and know how to act. But I see others that are just going wild all the time and parents cannot control them at all. Thoughts?

20090202225903AALygKl	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	I just found out that my son's Pee Wee Football Coach is a REGISTERED SEX OFFENDER...Who can I report this to?	My son plays on a pee wee football team in North Texas. I just found out that his coach is a registered sex offender. I called and talked to the commissioner about it and he says that he isn't required to check backgrounds of the volunteer coaches, and that he is aware of his record, but it wasn't against a child so he doesn't think there is a problem...   I know I can just not let my son(s) play in the association, but its still wrong. He said the man will be allowed to coach again.   I called the Editor of our local paper but who else can I talk to???!!      Any ideas about this would be great. I think parents should know who is teaching their children!   1 hour ago - 3 days left to answer.          I do know the offense was in 1996 and against his wife. I dont know if it is the same wife he has now or not. However, it is public record, which is how i found out. My daughter was looking on the Sex Offender Website at our area and his name, picture, and who the offense was against and what it was for all came up.    I think the main concerns I have is (a) they dont do backgrounds on the coaches ( what IF the offense had been against a child) and (b) they should disclose that information to us parents BEFORE our children are exposed to them. It just so happens this is what this guy did, what if he had some other felony record, are we suppose to wait until something happens to a child before we say there should have been checks done?      Thats all im saying. I dont care if the guy specifically is brought into the matter accept he shouldnt be allowed to coach.         Football season is over. My son is no longer on the team, but we didnt find out until after the season was over. So no he will not be back on the same team, but I am not sure I want him to be a part of an association that doesnt put the childrens best interests first.         Ok just one more edit ( i hope). The issue ( for me) isnt the GUY himself.    My concern is the fact that we as parents, putting our children in an organized sport, assume that all proper precautions are being taken when placing our children in a situation. The fact that in this specific case there are possibilities that he is as innocent as an angel, doesnt mean there 10 other guys that molest children, kill people, ect. We wont know because they dont check, and those type of crimes arent required to register.   I want to know if there is a greater power that has control over these "association" to keep some control and structure to adddress these types of issues. I never even mentioned the guys name to the newspaper, only the commissioners stand on the whole thing.

She'd find ways to leave or end the argument once I would begin to point out her wrongs.  Anyway, if I ever complained about her being a b*tch to me my sister would say, "you should not be mad at her, you know how badly sleeping with the guy she liked hurt her." She'd tell me to apologize. I would feel guilty and  put up with her B.S. Since I never truly got a chance to defend myself, I am still angry. It has been almost  6 months since I have seen her but I get pissed all over again. I think of all the crap I endured from her and she does not even want to talk to me anymore.

20090202222426AAQM3Gs	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Could I be pregnant?  Please read....?	Hi all,      My partner and I have just started (this month) trying for a baby.  I usually have a 28 to 29 day cycle.  I started my period on 19th Jan.  I am pretty sure I started ovulating at about 28th Jan.  I had unprotected sex on 28th, 29th, 31st Jan and again on 3rd Feb.  Could this result in pregnancy?  Do you think my timing was right?
20090202222850AAAsoGv	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Weird Cycle?? Or am I paranoid lol?	I posted on here this past weekend about being 7 days late but getting a negative pregnancy test result with a HPT       well aunt flow finally showed but it was barely here. On a normal cycle I  have my period for at least 6 or 7 days but this go round it lasted barely 2 and half days and it was more brown spotting than anything (sorry for the tmi)      that has never ever happened before even when I was on bc the shortest I've ever had it was 4 days and the first two were horrible lol      am I looking into this to much or should I still wait around and retest in a week?      oh and we are currently ttc but we just started at the end of Dec. so I'm doubting it would happen that fast lol also my thyroid is normal and I honestly haven't been stressed up until this whole period deal came along lol      ty for your time!
20090202223008AAtrSEM	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Is peer pressure a cop out, specifically for drugs?	Drug education keeps beating the peer pressure drum, but i'm pretty sure kids are marching to a different beat.  Maybe my own experiences are rare, but todays youth seems rather openminded.  Most kids don't mind if other kids smoke pot, and kids who do don't mind when others don't.      They have already had that PSA about 5 yrs ago where those kids are smoking (tobacco or marijuana, i don't remember) in the gym and this kid is offerered some and he says "No Thanx."  The guy who offered said "That's cool."  So in a sense, they've already made the point that peer pressure isn't that big.

20090202223211AAUyQrF	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	What I should I do now?	Long story is being condensed now so if you have any questions because I have left anything out - I will add in the additional details.      I had been going out with a childhood friend for 2 years (I am 18 in 2 days) and I didn't get on with my family but my mother and his mother agreed that I could move in with his family mainly because it was more convenient with school and stuff.       Around a month ago, I moved back in with my mother and sister (15) because my sister got pregnant... I am kind of the mediator in the family and I feel as thought that is all I will ever be good for.      I broke up with James because I didn't want him to be dragged in to the whole mess.. And I seriously regreted it... If you read my other question that explains all of it.      I missed him - He missed me and we decided to go and talk yesterday. It felt good to know that he forgave me - even though I fail to see why - he could have any girl he wants and he likes me...      BUT now.. he is moving to the other side of the country.    I talked with his and my mum and they said that if I really wanted to - I could move with his family.       I don't know what to do.. Could I really leave my sister while she is pregnant? Her and my mother are always fighting... She looks up to me and without me - I don't know if she would be able to cope. (By no means am I trying to sound arrogant but I am trying to say that there is no real positive influences in her life and the area we live in now is horrible..)       If you were me would you move or stay? I don't know whether to put myself first or not - because I never have.

Here the last few weeks she's been trying to come up with reasons to stay home like "My tummy hurts a little, im not going to school" or "Oh your paying bills tomorrow? im coming!!" im like "No your going to school" and she gets upset. We thought the other night she had the flu or something but i thought it was kinda funny how she was fine, until i put her to bed. Then that morning she threw up all over her bed (she's ALWAYS thrown up in the toilet since she was one) So i knew something was up. Then all day she tried to hang out and play but i made her to lay in bed and rest seeing how she was sick. She acted VERY onrey and normal. Then tonight she was fine, feel asleep good. Then when she woke up, threw up again all over her bed again!!! UGHh  Came in the living room with it all over her shirt instead of taking it off and stood there stareing at me, I told her to go wash up then said "your not really sick are you? (because i saw a smile) and she just shook her head No, Then i asked why one earth would she do such a thing and she just screams "I DONT KNOW!" I sat and talked to her and asked her about school and if she's getting picked on and what not. The ONLY thing she'll say "Its not fun, i dont want to go because its not fun", she says the same thing about going to her dads. Please Help?!

20090202224450AAHuY1S	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Might my pregnancy still be viable? Unique situation.?	Please help! I am *supposedly* 7 weeks pregnant. My LMP date was December 15, but I bled for 2 weeks and was on birth control (so I might have ovulated late). I got my doctors pregnancy confirmation on the January 29th. A few days ago I started having sharp pains on my right side. Last night, I was really concerned about an ectopic pregnancy even though no spotting or bleeding was occurring, so I called the on-call doctor (who turned out to be my regular obgyn that night!). He had me come in this morning for a vaginal ultrasound. Well, he saw that my uterus lining was thickened, but saw no baby. He told me then it was very possibly ectopic. Then he noticed that I had a lot of free floating fluids in my abdomen and a very large cyst on my right ovary. He took me to the ER where they tested my hemoglobin and HCG levels. The hemoglobin came back okay and the HCG was at 780. He was sure it was ectopic and decided to do an emergency laparoscopy. I gave strict instruction not to do anything that might harm the baby if it wasn't ectopic. Well, I woke up and found out that no ectopic pregnancy was found. All of the pain was from the ruptured cyst of my right ovary and the fluid build-up. I go back in 2 days to test my hormone levels and make sure they are raising. In the meantime, I don't know what to think. My doctor says there is still a chance the baby could make it. He said that I could have ovulated later and not been far enough along OR that the free fluids, ulcer, and swelling could have disrupted the waves (or whatever they are). BUT, he has a doubtful look in his eye...then again, he did say he was sure I had an ectopic and was wrong. We would have needed to go in anyway for the ruptured cyst, but still. I talked to a friend who is an obgyn and she honestly thought my regular obgyn shouldn't give up so easily. She said that especially because I'm still not bleeding (as in, up to this second not one little spot of anything at all), there is still a good chance that the pregnancy is viable. She also mentioned multiple reasons why the baby might not have shown in the ultrasound. Apparently I could still be seven weeks or I could be earlier. Now I don't know what to think! I was hoping to find some support on the forums and maybe someone who could confirm that there is still good hope for my baby. I want this baby so badly, but i don't want to get my hopes up for no reason. I just keep thinking, we know it is in the uterus, but should I be concerned that nothing was seen in there today? Please let me know what you all are thinking!

When she sees her favorite shows, she claps and gets so involved that she becomes glued to the television. I think TV is ok, once in awhile- when she is sleepy or sick- but it should not take the place of playtime, and books. She doesn't have the patience for books, and it worries me that she is getting too much TV already. Don't get me wrong I don't give her her way when she cries, but sometimes it seems easier to let her just watch NOGGIN than to force anything else at the end of the day. Anyone have ideas? I am willing to spend time reading to her and playing if I can get her interested!!!

I didnt start at the end of November... I gave it a few days, still nothing. NO PERIOD all through December. Then Dec. 27 I started first thing in the morning but it was light and then by the next evening I was done. I took a home pregnancy test, it seemed like one right after another! I think we ended up taking 6. All came back negative. (This might be TMI but my fiance and I had intercourse the beginning of January and I bled a little bit during it...never happened before!) But on January 28 I took another b/c i had terribly sore breasts and headaches and yes, I'll admitt, very emotional. We took a test and it came up positive. We were so used to seeing negative we took another and it came up positive again!! So... How far along am I? I knew instantly that I was pregnant with our first one! Please help! Thank you!
20090202225910AARrVwp	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	I ruined my daughters face- how can I forgive myself?	About 2 months ago, I was playing with my 13 month old on the bed.  She fell off & landed face first onto the sharp corner of my dresser.  The skin right under her nose had a deep laceration & bled so badly I had to take her to the e.r.  They bonded it with surgical glue & told me it would heal fine, however it has developed into a keloid scar that has become mildly disfiguring.  It's in such an obvious place that people often ask what happened.  We went to the pediatrician today & he wants to watch it carefully to ensure it doesn't become any larger.  I feel so badly for not being more careful with her & I'm beating myself up inside.  I can't afford laser treatments & all I keep thinking about is kids teasing her in school when she gets older.  As a mother, how can I get over this?

For the last four nights he has only woken once for a feed (breastfed) for three nights before he seemed to wake at least three four times a night and before that he woke twice a night for a feed.      Do you think that the change in his sleeping is down to his cold? Or is he getting to the stage where he doesn't need the extra feeds during the night?       I am sooooo not complaining as it is lovely to not to have to get up out of bed in the middle of the night as much and he seems to be so much happier during the day, which is fantastic!!      How long do you think it would be before i get used to his new sleeping pattern as i keep waking at his usually night feeding times. LOL!

My other half started a new job yesterday, and it is a physically straining job. While he was at work, i did all of the housework with our daughter screaming at my feet as one of her top teeth finally cut through. Then i picked him up, cooked his tea, bathed the baby, did the dishes and another general tidy-up before we headed off to bed.   I am exhausted at the moment from being pregnant, and he got cranky with me because i would not stay awake to rub his back because it was sore. I tried to, but i kept falling asleep and he kept waking me up then snapped at me cuz i kept nodding off.   I was still cranky with him today.  I know he was sore from work, but i have my work cut out for me at the moment too! At the end of my big days there is no one cooking my dinner so i can sit down, watch a movie and relax!   no big deal- im just sitting up until he falls asleep tonight so i dont have to have the argument again lol. Just wondering what everyone else thought??

How much more risk of miscarriage is there in a woman with PCOS, compared with a 'normal', healthy woman? Do you have a PCOS pregnancy story with a happy ending?

20090203010450AASdPUU	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Positive or evap line?	I know you are not supposed to look at a test after the 10 min time limit, but I couldn't help myself. Yesterday I did a dollar store test, and there was nothing..m not even an evap line today when I peaked (and I wantd there to be hope so bad!! Lol). So I took another one this mrning with my fmu, and I thought I saw a super faint line, but thought my eyes were just playing tricks.. So I looked at it again tonight and there is a noticable but faint second line.. Not grey but with the reddish tint.. Would this be a positive or an evap line? And if its an evap line, then why didn't an evap line show on the other tes which was the same brand?

20090203001923AAiAYH2	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Am I possibly pregnant?	Please don't call me stupid. My boyfriend of 7 months is O.C.D. and he makes me worry something terrible.      We had unprotected sex on 1/17/09 for the first time. It was a spur of the moment thing. We got up the next morning and went to Walgreen's and got PLAN B. I took it at 10:30am and again at 10:30pm. We had protected sex the following Monday and Wednesday and have not since.       I had my last period Jan 6th and wasn't supposed to start until today. I started Friday and it has not been normal AT ALL. It has been extremely light and has stopped 2 times and stopped again tonight and it has been a brownish reddish color. I cramped a little bit but not much after the first 6 hours. Normally my period is very heavy for the first 4 days then lightens up and stops for 6 to 12 hours and the goes for about another 12 hours. I also usually have clotting and haven't really had any plus it looked gooey this time. And every other period my breast get a little sore but they are really sore now, to the touch.       I took 2 pregnancy test one Saturday night and one first thing Sunday morning. They both came back negative.       I broke out in hives and had swelling in my hands and lips on 1/25/09 and went to the doctor the next day. They gave me a cortisone shot on 1/26/09 and I had to take MethylPREDNISolone until 1/31/09.       I also spent 4 days on the road Jan 22 til Jan 29.       Could it be the medicine messing up my cycle? Or is it just too soon for a test to show it? This is for my reassurance so if you want to be rude, please do not comment.

So my husband and I have been TTC for over a year now, every month i start my menstrual on the 16th, so on jan 2nd i went to the docs to get a pap done to see if i can  start fertility treatments. well, results came back good, nothing wrong. I was planning on waiting until after my menstrual to set up an apt for the fertility clinic. yet... no period! I have never missed one never ever ever!! so i was excited and went to the docs to test. (on feb. 2nd) result came back negative. I haven't had any stress or weight gain or weight loss or haven't done anything different that i can think of that would of caused a missed period. So what could be going on? can there still be a chance that i am pregnant?

20090203011202AA3vwPj	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Clearblue pregnancy test result.  Possibly pregnant?	My wife just took a Clearblue pregnancy test (non digital) this morning.  At first glance, it gave us a negative result as we saw a thin blue horizontal line across the window.  However, upon a closer look, we found a "gap" in the middle of this horizontal, "negative" line.  This "gap" is where a vertical line would've appeared if the result were definitely positive and is about 2-3 mm, about the width of a vertical line.  Any guess out there as to what this might  mean?  Thanks.

I'm just shy of 20 weeks pregnant   I've become somewhat concerned, tonight and yesterday I've woken up in the middle of the night with bad pains in my stomach, all over, under my belly button, above it, and around it. It's sharp in the middle and kind of radiates outwards.      I've felt muscle stretches and spasms in my stomach before... so I was a little worried these were more than just "growing pains" especially since they've been strong enough to wake me.      My tummy is getting a bit bigger... did anyone feel bad pains right before they popped/started showing?      Or what do contractions feel like? If that's what they are there's def something wrong since I'm only about 20 weeks...so I'm a bit worried that there could be something wrong?      any insight would be great, I wasn't sure if I should call my doc, if this was normal and I'm just being silly. It's been bad enough to wake me from my sleep though :(

My baby (samantha )is 8months old. And i have been trying to much sure that i give her the best to my understand.   She used to eat HIPP dinners and Milk but now i have introduce her to cow and gate milk and dinner and also Heinz, which she LOVESSSSSS.   Her daily routine are as follows, she wakes up between 7-8am, she will have her cereals (either fruits or rice cereals) and 2h-3hours later 150ml milk.   Between 1pm - 2pm, she will have her lunch(either rice, fish or potatoes 190 or 200g pots) But few times she don`t finish them and i save them for later / next day.   2 hours later between 3-4pm she will have her desert (a small pot 128g).   Between 6-7mp, she will have her milk (150ml or 200ml) and before she goes to bed at 9pm, she will have her good night milk 200ml or 240ml.   So please mums, am i feeding her too much or too less or just right?   My baby weight is18pounds. And she plays and smiles a lot.

20090203023937AAiOAzk	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	I am so over this, why does this have to be so complicated?	I have been off birth control for three months, my first cycle was 34 days and I clearly ovulated with my temps staying above 97.5 for 12 days, but my last cycle was 33 days and there was no elevation in my temps for any length of time so I started taking FertilAid and I am now on day 25 of this cycle and no indication of ovulation. If my cycle stays consistent with the last two months I would have already ovulated by now. This is too frustrating keeping up with month after month. I can't imagine how all of you who have been doing this for more than a year must feel. I plan to go to my doctor today since she told me to come in if I was pg by January. I have a hypothyroid, so she was wanting to check my levels to make sure they are okay. I'm assuming I will have to go on some kind of prescription drug like clomid or something.      I just don't understand why some men can just look at their wives and they are pregnant and others have to go to the other side of the world and back to get pregnant. Uggghh!

20060811083014AAQHNbz	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Am I pregnant?	So, I've been having sex like, every day with the same guy for the last liitle while.  I take birth control dilligently, but I'm also on this new medicine (it's for a skin infection) that makes the birth control less effective.  I started feeling sick about a week ago.  I feel sick to my stomach all the time (but I haven't vomited yet), I'm really tired, my breasts have always been tender (so that's not a good factor), and I get headaches a lot.  My period should start in just less than 2 weeks.  Am I pregnant?  The only reason I doubt is because my sickness started at about the same time I started taking my new meds.  Is my being sick caused by the meds, or am I pregnant?

20061230213005AA1juDE	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Have you ever seen or heard about stupid things happening during birth?	Have you ever seen or heard a story about stupid things happening during birth? My mom told me my older brother Chris's pregnancy was smooth until his birth, when about an hour before he came out, the doctors learned his cord was around the head, but they didn't tell my parents, and did not do a c section, they tried to do the birth normally, and almost killed my brother! They did something in the end that saved him though, after that, the docter, who was about 60 or 70 years old, retired for good.
