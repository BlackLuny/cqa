Hi,    I'm not native English, so concerning green peas, I cant figure out what edible-podded means:   - the peas together with the pod (if pod is the housing I guess)   -or just the balls (peas) that are inside- the pod/housing is removed         The official definition is too confusing for me which says:    "a variety of pea plant producing peas having soft thick edible pods lacking the fibrous inner lining of the common pea"      So which one would edible-podded mean- the peas with or without the pod/housing- simple answers please a simple yes or no, the definition is confusing enough already.

20080924132903AAX83wx	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	What is easy that I can make for my parents' anniversary? [[read on]]?	I'm 13 and want to do something nice for my parents' anniversary. They have been married for 8 years and would like to treat them to something nice because most of the time they don't do anything for their anniversary but exchange cards. This year I came up with idea to make them a dinner and dessert [[probably a cake]] and let them have a candle lit dinner while I take my brother and sister over to my grandmother's house who lives in the neighborhood. I also am planning on giving them 25 dollars and my brother is doing the same so they can have 50 dollars to help pay for them to go to their favorite restaurant (Ruth Chris). Anyways, what would be nice and easy to make for them? My brother and I don't really have much cooking skills because we are only 13 (we are twins). I want their anniversary to be special though. Any ideas would be nice. Thanks in advance. :]

I am trying to find the Starbucks Pumpkin Spiced Syrup for Lattes (65 FL OZ) syrup and Ebay has them for sale for $50.00! Why is it so expensive. For a (33 FL OZ) of syrup at Starbucks Locations they only cost $6.75.  I understand they are hard to find, but that is ridiculous to pay 10 times more! Also where are the people selling them getting the Pumpkin Spiced Syrups from?
