V1WS0ZQxaa	Sono tre le cause principali:(non utilizzo paroloni tecnici) <br>  1) Risalita dell'acqua dalle fondamenta ( per capillarità).<br>  2) Umidità dalla parete esterna .<br>  3) Punti freddi della parete e conseguenza condensa = umidità= muffe.<br>  <br>  Soluzioni:<br>  a) La maggior aerazione forzata e non elimina o limita il formarsi di muffe, il tuo armadio questo non permette quindi si creano le muffe (sappi che è un problema molto comune ) e frequente in casi come il tuo parete esterna a cui sono appoggiati mobili .<br>  <br>  B) La parete esterna è ben protetta (prolungamento del tetto) da possibili infiltrazioni da piogge meteoriche?  nel lato all'esterno della parete esiste un marciapiede o una struttura cementizia che faccia permetta una eliminazione dei ristagni d' acqua ?<br>  <br>  C) Punti freddi, la soluzione sarebbe una parete esterna isolante ventilata, oppure una parte interna isolante. mio nipote ha installato dei pannelli di sughero  (sul mercato ne esistono di tanti tipi e con specifiche funzioni polistirolo associato a cartongesso etc.).<br>  <br>  D) In presenza di un problema di piccola entità muffa bianca rimovibile è sufficiente uno spazio fra il mobile e la parete 3 -4 cm un buon prodotto isolante pittura. (la muffa si elimina con la candeggina in diverse percentuali a seconda del tipo di parete e manufatto.<br>  <br>  Ciao|`|6nyy7taZaa	Ho lo stesso problema... Ci sono delle pitture (tempere o altro) che contengono antimuffa, funzionano bene... Dovresti provare a chiedere a un imbianchino di fiducia, già quello aiuta molto.<br>  Poi ci sono anche prodotti appositi da passare sul muro per evitare la muffa, hanno un odore pessimo ma non sono male. Poi naturalmente il consiglio è quello di tenere l'armadio il più possibile staccato dal muro, in modo che circoli aria. Possibilmente comunque non attaccato completamente al muro, perchè è rischiosissimo anche per l'armadio.<br>  Infine, un'altra cosa che mi è stata consigliata è una presa d'aria in camera, di quelle che si fanno con un buco nel vetro della finestra e che consentono il ricircolo dell'aria. E poi ovviamente aerare la stanza il più possibile, cioè aprire la finestra anche per qualche minuto ma ogni giorno (lo so, d'inverno è una goduria........)<br>  A livello di lavori edili non saprei dirti, ma questi sono gli espedienti che ho adottato io per la mia camera da letto (50 cm di muffa pure io, l'anno scorso.... grrrr), e devo dire che quest'anno sta andando molto meglio, ancora nessuna traccia.<br>  In bocca al lupo!|`|CB9UENUbaa	puoi mettere dei pannelli isolanti si vendono nei migliori negozi di ferramenta e costruire una parete nuova.......poi ti do un consiglio se chiedi al tuo ferramenta di fiducia sapranno darti piu consigli|`|93252c4c58d778bbd527f0ad9d65faa7aa	deumidificatore.|`|TxxAPbZQaa	io direi di provare con un deumidificatore u.u<br>  <br>  a casa funziona|`|z7SH85yUaa	per prevenire la muffa puoi:verniciare la parete con delle vernici che prevengono la muffa(anke se non aiutano moltissimo)o prendere dei sali che metti in una gabbietta e le appoggi vicino alla parete quando hanno assorbito l'umidità diventano acqua ed assa scende in un altro piano della gabbietta(questo aiuta molto provalo)ciao..k|`|c3EfdMVxaa	se la muffa è dovuta dall'acqua presente nell'aria che si condensa suule pareti più fredde.....ammetto che è un problema molto antipatico...e a volte nn facile da risolvere...se invesce vi è un'infiltrazione di acqua dall'esterno credo che sia utile rivestire la parete...comun que per entrambi i casi è utile isolare la zona|`|FSK0C3HEaa	Ciao io ho definitivamente risolto così: devi recarti in ferramenta ed acquistare 2 prodotti della linea LINVEA (ottimi) esattamente un purificatore e l'antimuffa. Il primo lo devi "spruzzare" deirettamente sulla parete da trattare e successivamente (anche il giorno dopo) passerai le 2 mani di antimuffa LINVEA. Prodotti leggermente + costosi degli altri ma risolvi DEFINITIVAMENTE x almeno 2/3 anni. Ciao|`|MuiEq6ICaa	Allora per toglierla subito passa una spugna poco umida con sapone liquido poi asciuga con un panno,va via funziona... e poi un deumidificatore...Ciaooo!!!|`|xX6MbnBYaa	Io ho avuto lo stesso problema,se segui le mie indicazioni vedrai che risolverai anche tu<br>  1) pulire molto bene con uno straccio umido,togliendo tutta la muffa sia dal muro che dall'armadio.<br>  2) Spruzzare L'ammoniaca direttamente sul muro, con uno spruzzino tipo quello del vetril, pulire con l'ammoniaca e lo straccio il retro dell'armadio,per evitare che si salvino delle spore di muffa.<br>  3) Per fare le cose in grande bisognerebbe passare la pittura igenizzante (cioè antimuffa) per due volte. il barattolo di 1kg costa circa 15euro<br>  4) Una volta che il muro si è asciugato bene, rimetti l'armadio, ma la cosa più importante è che lo devi lasciare staccato due o tre dita dal muro,perche se quella parete e soggetta a umidità, ha bisogno di aria<br>  se tu attacchi l'armadio al muro col passare del tempo si riforma la muffa.<br>  Ciao piacere di averti aiutato

8apA3Rffaa	Hard and almost impossible to say. Places like that will buy pallet loads of sometimes discontinued tiles , factory over runs and slower sellers.  Some times its factory 2nds or ( builders grades) .  Any brand name they might buy is often private labeled just for them . Sometimes looking at the tile I can tell or sometimes the box style can give it away .  There are on occasion markings or initials on tile backing that will give away the tile manufacturer. If you get or have a pc and want to try and find out, send me a pict ,front and back, I might be able to tell from that. E mail me thru my avatar and I ll send you my regular e mail  GL

WxMHGAtHaa	First remove all of the old caulk & make sure all surfaces are clean & dry. Overnight drying period should be sufficient in most cases.<br>  They do make caulk in a squeeze tube, but it costs more, & is'nt as consistent as tube caulk.<br>  Pick up a caulk gun (a dripless one is best).<br>  Usually 2 tubes of kitchen & bath caulk is enough to do a standard tub/shower.<br>  Caulk comes in a choice of colors, white being the most popular, but there's no quality difference if you want a different color.<br>  Buy a good quality caulk(DAP is excellent).<br>  A home improvement center can help you with getting the right materials for the job.<br>  Get a couple rolls of cheap paper towels as well.<br>  When you're ready to caulk, cut tthe tip of the tube of caulk about 1/2" back from the point & pierce it. A good caulk gun comes with a nail like piece of metal riveted to the bottom front of the gun.A Use that to poke down into the opening in the tube tip & wipe off caulk.<br>  Place the caulk into the gun & push the plunger arm until it makes contact with the "push piston"  just inside the caulk tube.<br>  Start from the top back side of the tub/shower surround & work across from one corner to the other, distributing an even bead of caulk into the crack.<br>  Do the sides next starting from the top again.<br>  With a wet finger, gently smooth caulk into an even concave consistent bead.<br>  If you mess up, do'nt worry wet caulk is very forgiving.<br>  If excess caulk builds up on your fingers, wipe it off with hte paper towels.<br>  A good dry time is 24 hours.<br>  Hope this helped you out, good luck!!|`|A3pQnIxAaa	Before recaulking, remove existing caulk so that you can start from scratch.  To be on the safe side, wait 24 hours before and after the work to be done.<br>  <br>  Removing the caulk isn't as hard as it appears. One company makes a product called Caulk-Be-Gone and another makes an Adhesive & Caulk Remover, two commercial products that can assist you in the job. These products are specially formulated to soften caulk for easy removal.<br>   <br>  After the caulk has softened (it may take a few hours), remove it with a plastic putty knife. Clean the joint with paint thinner and wipe the area dry with a clean rag. <br>  <br>  Then clean the joint with this famous mildew cleaner:<br>  <br>  1. Add 1 quart of liquid chlorine bleach to 3 quarts of warm water.<br>  <br>  2. Add 1/3 cup of powdered laundry detergent.<br>  <br>  3. Mix thoroughly and place in a spray bottle.<br>  <br>  4. Spray the mixture onto the mildewed area. Let it sit until the black mildew turns white. Rinse with fresh water.<br>  <br>  Although this mixture is mild, don't forget to wear gloves and eye protection and make sure the area is well ventilated. Make sure the detergent you use is ammonia free. Mixing bleach with a solution containing ammonia can release a dangerous gas harmful to your lungs.<br>   <br>  Immediately after eradicating the mildew, use a hair dryer or a hot air gun to thoroughly dry out the area. The joint can now be re-caulked.<br>  <br>   Use a roll of blue painter's masking tape for a professional-looking job. Apply the tape to the tub 1/8-inch from the joint. Next, apply another strip of tape along the wall, 1/8-inch from the joint. Now the caulking will go between the two pieces of tape, making straight, smooth lines.<br>   <br>  Apply tub and tile caulk into the joint and smooth it with your finger, an old teaspoon, or a caulking spreader. Immediately remove the tape by pulling it out and away from the freshly caulked joint. Be careful not to touch the caulk. Let it dry. You simply won't believe how beautiful your job will look.|`|dead87b04c642d6253a6b504c74fa259aa	Above suggestions are all great, I just want to add a little detail.

QrRhpMIQaa	make sure there is actually gas to it.  the thermocouple is the copper colored tube running from the gas valve and runs next to the pilot burner tube which should be silver in color.  IF the pilot will not light at all, the pilot tube may be plugged, spiders love to crawl in these.  if the tube is NOT plugged you may have a bad gas valve.  the pilot will still light with a bad thermocouple however it will not stay lit with one.<br>  <br>  <br>  to remove the pilot burner tube is fairly simple, even if you just take one end off at the gas valve and blow through it, you'll hear the air go through if it's clear or maybe blow the obstruction out.  be careful with the pilot tube, it is ok to bend it gently but DO NOT kink it.  if the tube is clear chances are you have a bad gas valve.  hope this helps.|`|29e81b4cb6e9f173025ba2933b36e6f2aa	Assuming that you are following the manufacturer's instructions, I guess that the thermocouple, which senses the heat in the pilot flame is bad and needs to be replaced.  Are you sure you are getting good gas flow?

These tree's however would probably work very well. A pussywillow, Wisteria(it can be cut back and it will grow as a bush or a tree, all you have to do is keep cutting back the leaves near the bottom of the bush.) There is also a tree called a Mock Magnolia tree, they have beautiful pink flower's on them and they are very hardy and love full sun. A Crape Myrtle tree is also good for full sun. A Mimosa is one of the toughest trees I've ever seen and it doesn't need any pampering.

1aSU7ifSaa	List of free government grants. Billions availale. Never Repay!!!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://freegovntgrants.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://freegovntgrants.blogspot.com</a>|`|IXZ87H3taa	There are lots of people who try to sell you books and such on how to get federal grants and how much is out there but I've researched it a lot and all that I have ever found the government gives that money to nonprofit and social service agencies so they can review who to give it to and how you qualify for it and such.  The government doesn't want to deal with millions of applications for aid so they let state and local agencies handle it.  There is a good program if your local agencies handle it where you can get an amount (here up to 25K), some of it is a grant, and some of it is added as a lien on your mortgage and only 1/3 of it is a very low interest loan - you pay around $110 a month for $25K and the rest is grants and deferred money.  But you have to have good credit to qualify since it is partially a loan.  You have to apply through a county social service agency for it.  The best place to search is to go to govbenefits.gov  you can answer a bunch of questions on your situation.  It will offer you after some of them are answered to search matches then, but keep going, will take about 20 minutes to go through the whole 200 or so questions, but then it will give you a list of possible matches based on questions you answered.  Some are grants, some are benefits (like medical or food stamps if you qualified).  It is not just for people though with low income, etc... that may get benefits, it will pull up by your income level all sorts of government programs, grants, help that you can qualify for if starting small businesses, etc...  It flags by certain things you answer and you'll read each match and some really don't apply to you, but it will find some that do and when it does it has all the info to contact them and often times a website you can go and and read more info.  Hope that helps you, it is a good start.  Don't waste money on any of those programs, you can get those books at the library but you can search online and find the same info - it is all publicly available you just have to look for it.

A balcony is an extension of a room on the exterior of  the home usually in the air.  A patio is detached from the home and on the ground.

RKC36n9Naa	by dividing the room it will make it look shorter. such as an area to sit and watch tv, and an area for dinning (or storage, whatever you need). this can be done in a number of ways...<br>  <br>  to do this you can arrange the furniture so that it makes a divider, like turing the futon. and then placing a small rug in that area. or you could utilize your short bookcases as a room divider. <br>  <br>  even if your set on keeping furniture against a wall, a bead screen could work as well (ikea has some for cheap). paint can also be used by creating a pattern like a large X, stretching from corner to corner. this makes a focal point at the center and appears shorter. another paint trick is to chose two shades that are close, but one is darker. put the darker shade on the end walls and leave the long one the lighter color. hope this helps!!!!!!!!|`|4Ctr5efpaa	I think that collages are amazingly cool.

7jhR6r5waa	Just some info, our Lowe's also sells GE.  I just bought all new appliances.  I love my GE gas stove and microwave.  I also really like my washer and dryer, but GE's dishwashers have not gotten good reviews even from my Home Depot salespeople.  I bought the Bosch dishwasher and love it. But I also bought a Kenmore elite refrigerator, although I also looked strongly at GE, they just didn't have what I wanted in the price range I wanted.  LG is still debatable.

XrZbqY4Vaa	For a start I would not put in any chemicals which break down the oil.  That may be ok for an oilspill in the sea, but definitely not where you are going to swim.  (Reason in moving water, large quantity to break down the remains and dilute it - in your swimming pool, the residue from the break down has nowhere to go but in your pool)]<br>  <br>  Next, try and get some sponge and wrap it around a length of rope bit longer than the width of the pool.

6059b1abd93af145f0d446106fcd6da4aa	First of all make sure that you have the hose put on the right way. The end with the "swival collar" needs to go onto the brush head. and the other will end into the skimmer. On your skimmer plate, you should be able to unscew the piece  where you place the hose. Attach the hose to that. Then in the skimmer remove your little collection basket and screw the end of the piece that you removed from the skimmer plate ( you won't use the plate at all at this point)into that hole. (I hope this makes sense, easier if I posted a pic). Then make sure your hose is filled with water, place the pump setting on waste. Then turn on the pump/filter. You should get an awesome suction.

BE WARNED - this will only be able to be covered on Anaglypta paper - on normal patterned vinyl - it will show.<br>  <br>  On vinyl - make a small hole with a needle (or an inkjet printer refill syringe) and then inject paste behind the paper and push out gently.<br>  <br>  Final point - if after three months you are noticing this - you may have a contaminant on the walls - a small patch of silicon, damp, mould - something along those lines - this will cause the problem as well.<br>  <br>  Otherthan above, you do not seem to have done much wrong - so try the fisrt few lines of advice first and see what happens.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|SttRtZ1Kaa	Have you tried a "sharp knife", to cut a 5mm/10mm cut the middle of the bubble, Applying a little paste on the cut, Roll down.<br>  <br>  Reasons - Could be lack of paste or it dried too fast perhaps.|`|z1F80chvaa	You used the wrong kind of paste or mixed it incorrectly.|`|fCF02V87aa	You either didn't  glue up good--or didn't squeegee your paper nicely to push your air pockets out.

I am with Swalec.<br>  I asked to have the meters put in, as that way they are less inclined to cut you off.<br>  I find pre-payment meters are better, as you can moniter how much you are using, you are paying souly for what you use and if you run out, you have an emergancy to use.<br>  <br>  British Gas are phenomenally over-priced and will screw you at every opportunity, hence the charges, which are massivly unjustified.<br>  <br>  Shop around for cheaper suppliers, especially if you have meters put in. British gas, are swines for prepayment meter charges.<br>  <br>  What they wil do, is put the debt on your meter, and everytime you pay credit on to the meter, it will take some off for the debt.

Ncu1wJU4aa	The pressure switch is used to ensure the combustion blower is operating and the vent or intake is not blocked and the heat exchanger has no leaks.  It operates by sensing the vacuum produced by the combustion blower via tubing attached to either the combustion blower housing port or a port on the heat exchanger collector box depending on your make and model.  The pressure switch will be round and have a rubber tube attached to it and the switch will have two wires. Make sure the tubing is connected and is not split or broken.  Pull the tubing off the port and blow through it to remove any possible debris, reconnect and retry.  Restricted intake pipe or exhaust pipe.  Faulty combustion blower.  Cracked or holes in heat exchanger.  Other possible reasons for this other than a defective switch could be water backing up in the furnace because it's not draining properly (furnace with PVC vent pipe, 90%). Could be because of a plugged trap or drain line. This would allow water to back up restricting air flow from the combustion blower or actually block the port for the pressure switch tube.  Look for the obvious first like the blocked vent or intake air or drain line.  90% furnaces have a trap somewhere in or on the side of the furnace that sometimes get's plugged up and will need to be removed and cleaned.  This is usually a quick repair for an experienced technician but for a novice could take a lot of time of trial and error.|`|b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	Try flipping the breaker off or unplugging it for a few minutes.  Then plugging it in again and see if that re-sets it.|`|ww12lItvaa	Maybe you can, but do you even know what the pressure switch looks like?    If the small draft inducer fan (that is connected to the exhaust pipe) is running then nine times out of ten it is only a plugged sensor hose that the switch uses to sense the air pressure.    The pressure switch is a like a 3 inch round disk like device with a couple of wires and rubber hose attached to it. The hose tends to plug up at the end opposite to the pressure switch. It is where the hose plugs on a fitting connected to the furnace body.     I take the hose of the furnace end and using a straightened paper clip wire I clean out that fitting. That usually solves that problem for that fault code.     Some brands, like the Goodman had a real habit of plugging up that fitting.     The hose is a high temp hose but it still tends to get brittle at the hot furnace end so taking it off sometimes means it breaks and you just have to trim it off to reinstall. Generally there is enough excess hose to reach. Sometimes it means a new little hose.     Good Luck. I hope you are handy.|`|dMZdQp67aa	I can t say for sure but if you have a lot of snow in your area and it is blocking your vent pipe or combustion are inlet pipe, that will not allow your furnace to come on.     If your furnace is in the basement then plastic vent pipe will go out the basement wall just above ground level.  The combustion air pipe should be just next to it. Check them both. Remove any snow around them and reset your thermostat.
8LZuzkXgaa	I understand your problem, but you can probably get cloth covers at Ikea or Pier 1 imports.  Not sure if by South Jersey you are in the UK or N.J.     Plastic is miserable! The corners are sharp and pointy and the plastic sticks to your skin in the summer.  All-in-all a horrible choice that will leave your kids no alternative but to poke holes in the plastic causing it to rip opened.  Then you'd get all mad and they'd hate you resulting in them placing you in a nursing home when your old and feeble.

They have other choices also, for around the same price.
AA10097817	This is how I clean my bathroom. Part of it is a daily 5 minute routine. Keeps everything under control.    Tuesday night - spray down tub/shower, sink and toilet with Lysol/water in a spray bottle.    Wednesday morning - take shower. Before getting dressed or drying hair, climb back in tub/shower to dry the tub/shower with a towel designated for that purpose (over time, that disgusting grime stuff should disappear). Keeping the tub/shower dry keeps the mold away, so do it every time you use the tub/shower. Because I sprayed with Lysol/water the night before, all surfaces were sanitized overnight as it dried.    Every day, swish the toilet with a toilet brush kept in a container with Lysol. Swipe the toilet surfaces with a damp cloth designated for that purpose. Swipe the sink dry every time you use it.    Once a week vacuum and mop (or wipe down on your hands and knees with a cloth if the floor area is small). You can use the Lysol/water spray for this, but I use vinegar/water spray on my tile floors.    Most of this is a daily routine. Only a couple of things are done as weekly cleaning.    Using abrasive cleaners just makes scratches where dirt hides and makes it more difficult to clean. Avoid abrasive powdered cleansers.  Good luck.|`|AA10526402	I have the same issue with mine and find that it helps if I clean it more often.  Also, if the tub drains slowly, then this grime builds up even worse, so you would need to clean the drain with some Drano.  To clean my tub I use Comet with bleach (it is a powder) and that works ok...but mostly you just have to scrub very hard!|`|uvnQBS6iaa	A good cream cleaner will help as it scrubs the dirt away, and if its really bad then use a plastic scourer.  Apart from that, you may want to try some like scale remover.  Genius stuff!  Don't use it every week or anything, but it is very effective for removing tough dirt.|`|Dx6dsQx1aa	We have a non-porcelain composition material in our tub, and Soft Scrub cleaner with bleach works well on it, especially if you can spread the paste over the tough areas and let it soak there for about 30 min.  If it's ceramic/tile, try X-14, 409, and Soft Scrub to see which works best for you.

AA10526402	We recently did this - we first called the survey company that did the survey when we purchased the house, and asked them to send us a copy of the survey (they did this for free).  Then, we decided to have a fencing company install it b/c after researching it, we realized that it was not an easy DIY project.  You have to dig the postholes, pour concrete in them, plant the posts (at the proper depth and distance apart), build the fence, and make sure it is level.  Ugh - that seemed like a pain.  We had a reputable company install a vinyl fence and it is guaranteed against wind damage up to 100mph!  You don't get that kind of warranty if you install it yourself.  So, for us it was worth the extra cost to have it installed (it isn't cheap though, it pretty much doubled the cost of what just the materials would have cost).  The company we worked with provided both the materials and the installation services.  There are also companies that just do the installation...so you could buy the fence at a hardware store and have them install it for you.  Oh yeah - and check with your town because most towns require that you get a permit to install a fence.  Good luck!|`|HdUc2ZHgaa	1st, call a surveyor if the property line is not marked. The last thing  you'll want is a neighbor who makes you take down a newly-built fence that you accidentally placed off the property line.    Then decide on the style of fence you want. I'd look in gardening magazines and the library for "HOW TO" books on the subject. Maybe Fine Wood Working or Fine Home Building magazine has articles.      Last, consult a local building supply or lumber yard as to the cost  and life span of the different materials. Redwood is fairly weatherproof. Some folks go for vinyl or PVC, but it's not earth-friendly. Maybe you could get some recycled wood at a salvage yard.

b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	I'd have to look at it to tell you for sure if it really is the timer causing your problems.  I CAN tell you that if it is the timer,   just get a new washer.  Unless the warranty on it is still good.  I'm not sure what the warranty duration is on Kenmore washers.  The timer is the "brain" of the unit.  It tells the washer what to do and when to do it.  In fact,  re-check your figures cuz $50 sounds awfully cheap for a brand new washer timer.  Also,   see if you can get another estimate.  Or a second or third opinion.  Don't settle for the first one.  The down side would be your laundry piling up.  The good side is, you meet some real interesting people at laundromats.  And just in case,  and this is a long-shot but,  check the Recalls section on the Kenmore website.  You never know...    Edit-  It is up to you,  but my advice would be to get a new one.  I mean,  why keep putting money into something that might not even get fixed the first time,  and,  may or may not last much longer?  Get a new one and be done with it.  You'll have a new warranty so you'll have no worries there.  Heck, I would even get the extended warranty considering it's a rental.  Just for my piece of mind.  Good luck with whatever you decide.|`|Amkmles0aa	i no about the times   sue then|`|KkZE2NDYaa	Who diagnosed the timer failure?

You simply remove the back panel where the controls are. Pull the knob off the timer from the front. There will likely be a nut holding it on (by the way, make sure the washer is unplugged from the power before you do this). Either write down where the wires go or take a close up picture of how the old one is wired. Remove the wires one by one, label them carefully, install the new timer, replace the wires, install the nut, the knob, and you should be good to go.     Check out the site below for info on servicing and pricing on parts.|`|ww12lItvaa	You should have paid a trip charge for the diagnosis and estimate. Here it is like $85.  So to have the tech replace the timer is not all that much more.  And you also get their 90 day warranty if they do the work.     It is real easy if you know how to access it. But I have seen plenty of customers take all sorts of parts unnecessarily off the back of the washer that I have to charge extra to reassemble. LOL.     Up to you.
CzNxbsmsaa	One gallon of paint will cover 350-400 square feet of space|`|AA10097817	Go to your local DIY place and tell the guy behind the paint counter what the measurements of the room are and the rest will fall into place. Make it easy on yourself and cover up or tape over anything you don't want paint on. Start with the ceiling and a paint roller on a long pole. Work your way down the walls. Always have a brush and a wet rag close by.  Always paint with good lighting. Use the brush where the roller won't reach and always work when the paint is wet.

Stick the puller through from the side opposite where the wire is currently. Attach it to the wire and then slowly pull it through.

These are screws that will go directly into the concrete without a sleeve after you have drilled the hole.|`|c097c1011041fad908830a01a920f94aaa	you will need a masonry drill ..don't know what country you are in but if its the uk then a 6.5 drill and brown plugs ..give a tight fit and use 5.x50 screw ..|`|zM9Lj21waa	i use tap-cons all the time but i think they will be way too big for this application...go with the small plastic shield and a screw to match...|`|vrvp4NKraa	It's Tap-Con
TKHHRUB4aa	I suggest you don't tear down your own bathroom unless you have knowledge in plumbing and electrical to say the least.<br>  <br>  Why not get a couple of estimate instead of just going to this one particular place. Sometimes the fixation of wanting a particular service isn't a good idea as you may end up paying more than what you should be paying when in fact, others could do the same or much better with less money.<br>  <br>  You need to have someone work on your bathroom before you'll be able to buy the fixtures so that correct measurement can be taken.|`|SttRtZ1Kaa	Have you tried getting a price from the small builder & plumber.<br>  Then buying your choice of "bathroom Units".<br>  With today's problems with work etc, You should get a good price.|`|H7GtXRqGaa	We to have a quote from B&Q during the half price sale. What a rip off I'm still in shock ￡1500 for the suite, tiles etc and ￡2500 for the installation no way is that half price. I have had a builder come and quote he wants to charge us ￡130 per day and should taken between 6 days to 10 days but not the same guarantees as B&Q who offer 2 years on their installations.   <br>  <br>  I am still thinking of emailing B&Q to query the pricing policy.<br>  <br>  Sorry back to your question I would still get the suite from B&Q but look for a recommendation for a builder in your area.|`|a6j7Bu9daa	i would go to wickes, i put a new bathroom in my house...bath, toilet, sink, new floor, tiles, two years later and it looks great.  Everything was from wickes. It wasnt the most expensive bathroom set just white, but it looks modern and clean. <br>  <br>  Also they are easy going on returning items, as for B&Q ive had trouble with  them in the past.<br>  <br>  With wickes 90% of the items are in stock there and then even if someone else is gonna fit it, you could hire a van for say 50quid go and pick up the stuff  yourself.
NNbGdrPsaa	That looks like a carpet beetle but hard to tell from photo<br>  The furniture carpet beetle is a common pest of upholstered furniture. Like other species of carpet beetles, it is able to digest keratin, the principal protein found in animal hair and feathers. Furniture carpet beetles are found on furniture where they feed on hair, padding, and upholstery. Other food sources include carpet, fur, horns, and silk. Cotton, linen, rayon, and jute may be attacked when stained with animal body oils or excreta. The current practice of encasing furniture horsehair in a green rubber coating does not protect horsehair from infestation. Dried insect specimens such as those found in insect collections are also devoured. information link below|`|59f093dfc2cc9473cea87692c7a50804aa	How could a cute little beetle like that scare you?

N4IvZmPiaa	When you burn propane with adequate air supplied to it, the only products of combustion are carbon dioxide and water vapour. It is only when you reburn those spent gases that you will begin to produce carbon monoxide. You should have a detector in that area.<br>  <br>   Any propane heater like that requires ventilation. The rule of thumb that we use is 1 square inch for every 1000 btu's. Look at the rating plate of the heater. It will probably say something like "btu input 50,000 at 11"wc. For 50,000 btu's you need 50 square inches of fresh air to supply the heater and allow spent gases to escape. So if there are windows in that pool room, you need to open at least one a few inches. Best case is to open one at each end of the room.|`|59f093dfc2cc9473cea87692c7a50804aa	If the heaters do not exhaust to the outside, then yes, they are putting combustion products into the indoor air.  <br>  <br>  If you want to prove it to the operators of the gym, get a carbon monoxide (CO) detector and bring it into the gym in the morning - it may take a few minutes to detect elevated levels of CO, but unless the volume of air inside the building is huge, it should sound the alarm.

EIrdLq6Zaa	I change my towels every week. Actually i had a pair of towels and I just got tired of the color, so I washed just all those towels plus bleach and I like the color better now.

88d9051a073c7d08831c1a05c77b422eaa	Facts;<br>  The drip is coming from the overflow pipe outside.<br>  There is no overflow pipe from taps.<br>  If hot water is drained - it stops the drip.<br>  Drip is definitely from a tank overflow.<br>  Conclusion;<br>  Despite what you have been told, the storage tank ( or the Feed and Expansion tank for the heating system ) is overflowing.<br>  If you have a small tank which feeds the boiler, it will more than likely be that ballvalve, if you don't have a feed and expansion tank, the problem is definitely the main cold water storage tank.<br>  If you can access the loft safely and lift the tank lid easily, you can check for yourself. if the water level is up as high as the overflow pipe outlet, you will have found the cause and need the ballvalve adjusting, if it's new, or replacing if it's an older one.<br>  <br>  20 years as qualified plumber. Good luck with it.|`|f89f116400d4ff9b53b246c33e1753cdaa	Unlikely to be the taps mate - the taps have no overflow to the outside - they operate by shutting off supply when turned off - any leak from a tap would normally be from the tap itself caused by a failed seal.<br>  <br>  Try the toilet - in the cistern - the ballcock in the cistern may have split or need adjusting to lower the water level - a couple of turns of the adjusting screw inwards will lower the level|`|c097c1011041fad908830a01a920f94aaa	falklands is right ..its an overflow pipe...the reason the water stops when you use the taps is because the tank supplies water to hot water cylinder ..use the tap and the cylinder will use water ..the cylinder will then call on tank to refill ..result?the level drops in tank and overflow stops ..unless you have an expansion pipe   the drains into tank ..looks like an inverted U..this pushes water into tank due to expansion and over pumping ..if you do NOT  have one then the ball valve is the ONLY thing causing this problem|`|ztMeGHY0aa	I know you have had the ball cock changed three times but on my over flow pipe when it drips I know it's time to renew the washer. It is a small black rubber bung about 1/2 inch wide on the end of the piece going into the bit in the tank wall. Is it possible that your 'men' haven't replaced this? The other reason could be that the ball is not twisted round enough so that the water fills to a point lower down so that it doesn't overflow|`|96a318bea85eb2aa7d0b38b893875fb9aa	The water level in the water tank needs to be set to a lower level.  This is because the ball valve is allowing water to creep into the tank and increase the amount of water it holds. Many plumbers fit Ball valves without setting the water level correctly. Water pressure almost doubles at night time when very few people are using water and this is what causes the water to creep past the ball valve.
BK0Obg8Saa	Sorry to dishearten you but to your list add mice and slugs.You must provide a cover.I use home made cloches covered with fine mesh net.the type seen round building work ; as it's thrown away when work is finished  you should get it for free.I put slug pellets under the cloches where birds and pets cannot eat the pellets or dead slugs.Also a few mouse traps the same ,again safe from pets and birds.PS chocolate buttons make ideal bait for the traps. I garden on a 300 sq metre plot on an allotment site and most of my crop has to be covered Be thankful you do not have badgers,thats another story.|`|H7AZxsplaa	You will have to use netting to protect your flower seeds from birds. <br>  <br>  Other than that, you might want to treat the seeds with chemicals to ensure that it won't be affected by pores and fungus.|`|sSJ8zfebaa	probabal wont eat shoots.seedes could be protected by aluiminum pie plates blowing in the breeze|`|m5OXGrREaa	Oh boy, a .22 and go for the big ones.|`|dXrHoLMCaa	that ain't gonna happen.... just lay in  more seed to sow over what you have next season... you don't get to pick and choose who eats or benefits from Nature's bounty.... you throw it out there, someone's gonna help themselves!!... you must plan ahead for putting more out.... besides, what plants survive will help by planting their own seeds for you, too.... and sending out side shoots, too... it's all fair in the end.....|`|T3wenJ8daa	depending on the size of the area, i'd put some sort ot netting over the area.
