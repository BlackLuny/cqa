UQXLRkATaa	step 1*Splurge on scarves! Nothing pumps some flower power into an outfit like a scarf. Wear it in your hair like a headband or tie it over your scrunchie. Wrap it around your neck for a more poetic look or use it as a belt. Consider buying scarves with quaint Vintage designs in pastel or jewel-like colors, or buy bright ones. Paisley and floral designs are most flattering, but experiment with other patterns too if you wish. Solid-colored scarves work great with patterned blouses. <br>  Step2*Stock up on polo shirts in earth tones and rich wines. Polo shirts are the ultimate preppy staple, but the trademark Boho color scheme tones down the country club air. Search for polos in beige, burgundy, camel, forest green, burnt orange, brick red, mustard yellow, pale gray, violet, pine green, magenta, and fuchsia. Pair your polo with a pair of distressed jeans, cute leather sandals, a paisley scarf in your hair, and a subtle pearl necklace. <br>  Step3*Look for pretty bangles in feminine colors that you can stack on your arms when wearing short-sleeved or sleeves tops. The more bangles, the better, but balance your outfit out with minimal jewelry everywhere else. Try wearing a bunch of bangles with a ? sleeve blouse, a plain plaid skirt, girlish Mary Janes, and colorful tights or a funky headband. <br>  Step4*Buy the best tiered prairie skirts in soft cottons or luxurious velvet. Pair shorter ones with polos or cashmere sweaters, and longer ones with dreamy camisoles. Try a lacy camisole with a skirt that falls mid-calf, pearl earrings, a pearl necklace, and discreet metallic-colored sandals in gold or silver. Top it off with a scarf or headband. <br>  Step5*Find chic sunglasses in round John Lennon styles or glamorous aviator cuts. For extra shine, consider applying tiny rhinestones to the sides. Sunglasses can be worn over your eyes (as expected!), or just up on top of your hair for a vacation in Malibu look. Try a polo with a patterned prairie skirt, cute sandals, a couple of bangles on each wrist, and a pair of sunglasses. <br>  Step6*Shop for loud earrings---they punch up any outfit. You can buy large Gypsy hoops in metallics---silver, gold, copper---or wood, either plain-colored or dyed. Also look for chandelier earrings with encrusted gems or bunches of beads. <br>  Step7*Clogs are Boho staples, but they can be preppied up depending on the shape and material. High-heels clogs with encrusted gems or intricate beading are perfect for nights out, while plain leather clogs are great for casual days. Look for clogs made of denim or with velour shells for a more unique design. Try pairing clogs with jeans, a polo, a scarf used as a belt, sunglasses, and chandelier earrings.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.freepeople.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/category.content/categoryID/46cc9020-dd63-4304-b169-ac7d7cf74c40" rel="nofollow">http://www.freepeople.com/index.cfm/fuse...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.freepeople.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/products.detail/productID/ac0bf617-b315-4f32-9523-a2401df7446b/categoryID/d33e91d8-02c2-4775-b5fa-2c868faed501" rel="nofollow">http://www.freepeople.com/index.cfm/fuse...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.freepeople.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/products.detail/productID/ca80d5da-2882-46da-a3fd-ea57a00c7a33/categoryID/d33e91d8-02c2-4775-b5fa-2c868faed501" rel="nofollow">http://www.freepeople.com/index.cfm/fuse...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.freepeople.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/products.detail/productID/0ebe0673-e83e-4e9f-ada1-3c12c5832736/categoryID/d33e91d8-02c2-4775-b5fa-2c868faed501" rel="nofollow">http://www.freepeople.com/index.cfm/fuse...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.freepeople.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/products.detail/productID/e141d417-68c0-4dea-8efe-378434064490/categoryID/d33e91d8-02c2-4775-b5fa-2c868faed501" rel="nofollow">http://www.freepeople.com/index.cfm/fuse...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.freepeople.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/products.detail/productID/62ab381c-d151-41e8-bba4-350ed7f15082/categoryID/d33e91d8-02c2-4775-b5fa-2c868faed501" rel="nofollow">http://www.freepeople.com/index.cfm/fuse...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.freepeople.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/products.detail/productID/49cf7125-3ded-4735-9583-8f0b33fa6b61/categoryID/dd4c0fde-f443-4868-aa27-da49f8c8cf83" rel="nofollow">http://www.freepeople.com/index.cfm/fuse...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.freepeople.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/products.detail/productID/ab3c9eb8-2147-4940-a047-4b7a68e1500c/categoryID/dd4c0fde-f443-4868-aa27-da49f8c8cf83" rel="nofollow">http://www.freepeople.com/index.cfm/fuse...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.freepeople.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/products.detail/productID/2223b67c-9684-40c3-b12b-3e5c898feba8/categoryID/dd4c0fde-f443-4868-aa27-da49f8c8cf83" rel="nofollow">http://www.freepeople.com/index.cfm/fuse...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.freepeople.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/products.detail/productID/4907ef21-701f-471d-af3b-c475f6276374/categoryID/dd4c0fde-f443-4868-aa27-da49f8c8cf83" rel="nofollow">http://www.freepeople.com/index.cfm/fuse...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.freepeople.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/products.detail/productID/03097fb1-2c05-40f9-88a4-b0ef969192f1/categoryID/d708c546-8ea0-407d-a581-143d7122c41a" rel="nofollow">http://www.freepeople.com/index.cfm/fuse...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.freepeople.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/products.detail/productID/99b6d39d-1607-48f1-8dc5-cb0172ed1abe/categoryID/d708c546-8ea0-407d-a581-143d7122c41a" rel="nofollow">http://www.freepeople.com/index.cfm/fuse...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.freepeople.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/products.detail/productID/868f8a2a-9c1a-42c2-ac53-5186d5a31fe3/categoryID/d708c546-8ea0-407d-a581-143d7122c41a" rel="nofollow">http://www.freepeople.com/index.cfm/fuse...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  the trick is to mix and match!

2VndjiIRaa	do you have oily skin?<br>  makeup artists always use primers, no matter how great someones skin is. Primers are suppose to leave makeup feeling matte and fresh all day. the one brand that i heard this from is the SMASHBOX primer.<br>  the cheapest primer i have seen is Rimmel face primer (at walgreens).<br>  You could also try face blotters. Palladio makes them with rice powder on them (they are made with rice paper) and Clean and Clear makes some too. (they are plastic like, and have no medication on them)|`|c8f7Htx3aa	I used to have this problem. Every brand I used would get patchy or make me look greasy. My friend told me about a company called Faerie Organic. Their mineral foundation is the best thing I ever used. The foundation is light, airy, cover really well and stays put. I have very acneic skin and am prone to break outs this foundationhas actually helped my breakouts and yet covers. People compliment me on my face now (which I find funny since I am so prone to acne). Oh don't use Primers they will break you out, I researched this, they contain dimethicone which is like a plastic silicone film that goes over your face and dosen't let your skin breathe and clogs pores. I got faeries free sample kit and it lasted me like 2 weeks.

joiacDUdaa	MMM....This happended to me a number of yrs. ago... I went on a blind date.. I dressed nice a woman's cut button down shirt.. It was a little low but, not a big deal... The girls were covered PLUS I wore a leather jacket... This moron shows up wearing a leather duster a la 1980's with leather boots and a BANK ONE t-shirt he bragged how he got it for free.  It needed laundering.. Anyway, I'm trying to be nice so I ordered a coffee... He kept starring at my chest.. I have DD sized breasts.  They are big but, my GOD annoying... So, I closed my coat.  He than asked me "how big ARE your breasts.."  I got the attention of the waitress and ordered a pitcher of ice water and a glass.... I poured myself a glass and dumped the rest in his lap....!  I promptly left the restaurant... Slapping woud've required actually touching..!  UGH.... THANK GOD I'm married!  I felt pretty good and I went out with my girlfriends..<br>  <br>  good luck|`|gXBPLitzaa	i would deffenitly feel awkward around them after that & probelly try to avoid them.|`|gXxyJOEtaa	i would feel weird<br>  well i would pull his hand away and say wth are you doing <br>  and then yell at him in a very broad vocabulary :]|`|xuvqrnOoaa	i would feak out and make a big deal.... he is in the wrong and that is sexual harrasmentmake sure he appologizes
154dzJ1Faa	The way you have it cut, the hair is going to be getting into your eyes a lot.  You have to keep it cut short enough so that it doesn't irritate you.<br>  <br>  You have a very strong directional growth pattern towards the front.  This is common with Asian types.  It is a lot of work to try and force the hair in any other direction (you will always lose).  The best thing in that situation is keep it quite short so that it can't get in your way, or keep it quite long and hold it back with some sort of restraint.  You need to decide which would work best for you.  In one pic, the hair is shorter, and looks the best, but I can see that the other one is too long for you, and you are having trouble with it.  I still come back to that old rule:  Less hair = less trouble.|`|rDsKB0uXaa	Second picture is better leave it like that<br>  <br>  <br>  Vote for the Second one and get a point ( ;<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AkzdxiMHjUbuYhxrGoWHbVXsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090216151817AA94axB">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|DLaPjWpHaa	i think it looks better without but trying styling it so it goes to the side like in the second picture<br>  :]|`|X8ImtFIDaa	without gel all the way|`|7wrko11Vaa	you look better without! sexyyyy|`|b179bfff358a93e0bb048cde58264d8eaa	Your hair looks awesome without gel.<br>  You don't even need it.<br>  <br>  If you wanna fix it, can I recommend a hairspray? <br>  I use this australian one and it's green and has a koala on it.

Seriously, girls don't like that. There's a difference between having self-confidence and being arrogant. Girls like confidence. They like guys that know they're great but don't feel the urge to be obnoxious about it. A guy can be drop dead gorgeous, but if he's conceited, its a complete turn off.<br>  Well, you obviously know you're cute, so why don't you drop the obnoxious act and get a better personality? You'd get more girls and actually be able to keep them.

qxrr69bnaa	If you're using a lotion with an SPF, you're defeating the purpose of a tanning bed.  That's why you haven't noticed a difference.  You need to use a lotion meant for use in a tanning bed.  How much to you want to spend on a lotion?  The Caribbean Gold line by Australian Gold is inexpensive.  I've used Mind Eraser and got some good results.  I currently use Intrigue by Designer Skin and Pomegranate by Squeeze.  I like the lotions that are silicone-based.<br>  <br>  If your salon carries the sample packets, ask for recommendations from the staff.  It's best to start with the sample.  You don't want to spend a lot and not like the lotion and results.|`|FhrCLLzFaa	Ehhhhh.<br>  Tanning is SO bad for you.<br>  =[|`|joiacDUdaa	I use an indoor tanning lotion FABULOUSLY BRONZE by PRO TAN I get it online at halfpricedtan.com for around $7 a bottle..

6s9BlvD9aa	One of the easiest ways is after you take a shower put your hair into french braids. then sleep with them in. the next morning take them out and then your hair will be wavy. But this only works if your hair is at least 2 inches past the shoulders. Another really easy way to give your hair some movements is to put your after shower, wet, hair into about 20 braids and then sleep on it. In the morning pull your bangs back in a cute way. That always looks really cute. You can experiment with the braids depending on how thick or thin your hair is. Another idea that I use regularly is to take a 1 inch barrel curling iron and to curl it. Hold the curling iron in for like 20 seconds on the highest heat and you should get the best results. Those are the easiest ideas. If you have any more questions just ask me.|`|ZvOXs61caa	omg i felt that the same way too! two weeks ago! ive always wanted curly hair like really badly so my mom let me get a perm. and i hate it. i want my old hair back really badly. i miss it. i need it straight. you can curl it with a curling iron to make it curly. but im sure it looks better and fabulous and gorgeous straight! i want my hairrrrr backkk. :/ now my hairs all puffy and ewww.|`|DhTtm3ayaa	MMMMMM IDK I HAVE HAIR EXACTLY LIKE HER'S: <a href="http://z.about.com/d/beauty/1/5/O/l/keiraknightley.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://z.about.com/d/beauty/1/5/O/l/keir...</a><br>  <br>  yay keira (haha)<br>  <br>  except longer and i have never went through it|`|CO5jcxMraa	curling irons dont work on me either.<br>  so when i wash my hair at night i braid my hair into french braids and when it drys in the morning TADA its curly. then i may add a little hair spray to make it stay<br>  <br>  KEY hint: make sure youre hair is not wet wet just damp so might have to wait a while. if its too wet it wont dry by the morning and all the work will go to waste|`|LUz0Edczaa	use a curling iron.......excessive use may damage ur hair. so make sure u use heat protection spray.

Men can get away with cheap jeans really easy...and it's cool to have jeans in different random styles.  As long as they are clean and fit the way I describe <br>  <br>  I hate seeing a man where I can see his crack and his mangina  suffocating...I hate to see a man where the cuffs of his pants are at his ankles and I can see his socks or even the toung of his shoes.  I hate to see a man with his pants hanging off his butt and I can see the dingy draws he wearing.|`|y9icmRcYaa	My boyfriend is always searching for new jeans for the same reason! He is very muscular but also has massive legs and a butt. He looks REALLY good in Lucky Brand loose fitting jeans. They can be expensive and he refuses to spend a lot on clothes so, he either gets them at the Nordstrom Rack (any designer outlet store should have them) or off of Ebay. A lot of time Macy's will have them on sale for below $50.00 <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA11811976	It might work, but they are pretty tight these days.. if your thighs fit in them skin tight I would no recommend on account of nastiness and specifically male comfort.  I occasionally wear chick jeans and the main problem is "roominess"... Also, get a tight fitted boxer or jockeys, as tight pants will clearly display your boxer lines for all to see... not classy|`|42aPROX2aa	I would suggest LUCKY BRAND jeans. It's a little more expensive, but just hit the sales up and that shouldn't be a problem. Don't do anything like Old Navy, because the jeans are ALWAYS the SAME and they SHRINK.|`|oWXSnTDjaa	I just get the cheapest ones I can find at walmart.

uC55n3HIaa	The first thing you must do to become a fashion designer is to create a portfolio (a collection of your designs). If you have the money, you can have people make your designs and then show them on runways and try to sell them to retailers. If you are just getting into the field I would recommend you to draw some designs and check out <a href="http://www.designerbloc.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.designerbloc.com/</a> it's a community for fashion designers to display their designs, get community feedback, and meet other designers. Try posting some of your designs there and work on your design skills. Good luck!|`|D9yeLgKkaa	i want to be a fashion designer too. i would suggest going to FIT, FIDM or Pratt University. then look for jobs at designer's places.

76a9dda780f0330e4ce6afedb3286c08aa	I bought the Great Lash mascara a few weeks ago, and quite frankly, it SUCKED! I just bought Lash Stiletto a few days ago, and I LOVE the results! I have skimpy, short lashes and this gave it the length I wanted. Do try Lash Stiletto, you'll love it.|`|WNnetouTaa	well i have never heard lash stiletto and i have never tried great lash, but i use an amazing masacara, by the brand MAC and its only 12 bucks and its called "zoom lash" it works GREAT, awesome length and thickness too, if you want more thickness try the MAC plump lash, which is the same price. ive tried both and niether ever clump, i highly recommend them.|`|8FXIBGNpaa	i have stiletto, but all my friends use great lash. both are really good. If your looking for more natural appearance, stiletto is your mascara. I think it has more length than Great Lash. Although GL is really great for thickness. I use it mainly when i go out at night, and Stiletto during the day.|`|KfSjXY6gaa	use double extend by loreal!

nxb1hvvnaa	Hey, I have your same problem, and I have one thing to say: DO NOT use head and shoulders!!! For some reason, instead of helping the problem it literally made it worse! My hair stylist recommended a brand called Biolage's dandruff shampoo, I didn't get to try it yet because she was out of stock... but she says it works very well, and I'll let you know when I try it if that's true:)|`|AAKdb6Eraa	Selsun Blue.<br>  <br>  It also prevents zits on your back and chest.|`|AA10745960	selsum blue works <br>  t-gel works to but you have to let it set in your hair for like 10 minutes|`|D3hLhqR7aa	Head and Shoulders really works.

I beg you.  Pantene is pretty much wax so all it's doing is coating your hair in wax.  That's why it looks so shiny afterwards but after using it your hair will start to feel gross and look dull.  Wax damages hair and you can look this up anywhere.|`|Fuej6dMPaa	my boyfriend uses it and i love it. its made his hair super shiny and it looks really healthy. I've tried it a few times when i've been at his house and its really good.|`|7gfNIajYaa	Yeah I used it for a while,but I felt that it gave my hair a rough feel after my shower,you really have to use conditioner afterwards.

jp3WrE1caa	i think you should leave it how it is:) its really pretty.and you have really pretty eyes.but if you want to cut it,get it a bit shorter maybe?|`|EkZDP3Oyaa	Your hair looks good like it is, but I think you should do the same style only a couple inches shorter|`|CoTsKzPFaa	I like it the way it is.|`|9WOCYpadaa	Don't cut it.|`|O0sbEqi5aa	don't cut it you look cute like<br>  that|`|swqpeif6aa	don't cut it! its pretty|`|3nGhryADaa	no cut i like it
iV4yWexRaa	dont lose the bangs just make them side bangs and go a little darker whith your hair the different colors look slightly childish.<br>  and the clothes! sweety there are hot cheap clothes out there!<br>  forever 21 and wear dark wash jeans they make you look sophisticated and with you body shape dont ever wear wide legged jeans :)|`|8342eb2791b4f481bc2b31b4c0d0dbccaa	I think you look mature.  Even though you are short, you have a mature expression on your face that you can't fake.<br>  Why not try letting the bangs grow out and then razor cut layer them around your face.  Do some classy looking updos with your hair, and you will look more adult.|`|auFmP7J1aa	you look seventeen to me.<br>  <br>  =D|`|VjDNLUIRaa	ermmm, you do actually look around 17 :S<br>  theres not really anything you can do, it's all about genes...<br>  and i'm glad you don't go nuts with make up!<br>  You will just have to wait...i'm 19 and my face only started maturing-as in lenghtining, getting rid of puppy fat- about 6 months ago..<br>  and now i have these cheekbones that stick out!! I dunno where they came from, I always had a roundish face as a kid.<br>  But just wait, you DONT look 14 and you do look your age, your face won't really start maturing till your 18/19|`|6jXuUCdraa	yeah, get rid of the full on bangs, but if you look dumb without them, get some good side bangs. wear nice clothes with some skinny jeans and flats. put on eyeliner and a bit of foundation. you'll be fine :)|`|9cYqY6vWaa	Hair: <br>  Yeah, you most definitely have to grow out the bangs, I don't care how dumb you look... change the hair in general. Try dying it a dark brown color and getting it cut differently. Try shorter layers and add volume to your hair. Your hair is in major need of volume. And part it on the side! Seriously, parting it on the side will help SO much. <br>  <br>  Makeup:<br>  I know you say you look overdone, but you probably don't... you just aren't used to seeing yourself looking like you do with makeup on. I mean... seriously... 12 year olds wear makeup, I think you can too. Try some brown eyeliner and add some mascara. Also, your lips are in MAJOR need of some color. Try a berry colored lip stain, so your lips don't look like they do now. <br>  <br>  Clothing:<br>  Lastly, try dressing more mature. Your outfit in that picture looks a little 'Limited Too' (you know that little girls store). <br>  <br>  I don't think your problem is  you look young, more that you look ugly. <br>  <br>  Basically, the major things you really have to work on is growing out the bangs and wearing a side part, and dressing better. Makeup would help a lot though...|`|QWTLw9DEaa	Lol that's kinda funny because I'm 14 and people tell me I look about 17, and I have about the same color hair and about the same cut as you, just thicker and blunter bangs.<br>  Put on black eyeliner and black mascara and a little bit of foundation and blush.<br>  I think you look fine! You look 17 to me.|`|DrXWucWpaa	Nah, you look about 17.  I suggest growing out your bangs a little bit to achieve side bangs.. i think it would look cool on you if you got your hair nice and layered hehe.  I think your clothes are fine, and you are very very pretty so i dont think you need much makeup.. just maybe some mascara & lipgloss.. and if you dont want to appear so pale wear some nice blush (but not bright pink so you look like a doll)  haha.|`|h9Mq5NwMaa	Well, you are very pretty. You could try side bangs, so you would still have some, but they look a little older. dont try to put on really heavy make up cuz then you might look like a girl that wants to look older, but failed. haha, and your not a little girl. And wear something very sophisticated. here is a good, and bad example of something that would make you look a little older, and something that would make you look younger.<br>   <a href="http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/app#foo" rel="nofollow">http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/app#foo</a> <br>  sorry u might have to type that in, but its worth it!|`|20da7e19a185ca8c01b2a311761afcd6aa	You dont look that young to me at all.<br>  I wouldnt pay attention to what people are saying.<br>  You still have a little growing to do.<br>  Wait until your fully grown to change<br>  what you look like.

You look like a very innocent 17 year old but, that's a good thing. Don't try to make yourself look older with makeup, clothes, hair etc. that will all come in time. You have a very fresh, cute look. Enjoy it!|`|6DxEDRReaa	i agree you should get rid of your bangs. i think people say you look dumb just because they are so used to seeing you with bangs|`|Gh9X70efaa	Put some black liner on your eyelashes.

ph4psSwNaa	bleach it, BUT USE SOME SERIOUS DEEP CONDITIONERS AFTER CAUSE YOUR HAIR WILL BE DRY. Wait at least a few hours and re dye it your natural color. voila|`|qsgiZtwWaa	i would try to bleach it, or lemon juice.<br>  <br>  it lightens the hair naturally, you dont want to use another product.  thatd be way to much, and youd get ugly roots.|`|VjDNLUIRaa	what i have heard is the best thing to do is to first dye it red. <br>  The black strips the hair of any warmth, and if you dyed it blonde straight away you are in danger of it looking green or purpleish.<br>  the red puts the warmth back in, and then you put a blonde colour on.<br>  But i think you should maybe leave a day or two in between, and make sure you are drinking lots of water, eating lots of omega 3's-nuts, fish etc- and get lots of good oils in. <br>  Also use a mask on your hair afterwards and be VERY gentle with it...you don't want your hair to get brittle and break, so keep it healthy :)|`|20da7e19a185ca8c01b2a311761afcd6aa	To be on the safe side, you should just let your natural hair color grow back. It will take some time, and it might not be fun, but thats the only safe way. <br>  <br>  On the other hand, you could get your hair stripped a bunch of times. its not very healthy but it will get most of the black out so it wont look so bad. Its your choice.|`|ywJ5s3XZaa	You could colour strip it, or bleach it a few times.<br>  <br>  Like other people have said, you'll need to use ALOT of conditioners and masks, so it doesn't get brittle and break.|`|zoifRCtMaa	bleach it or just leave it the way it is|`|IROLLdMIaa	strip the colour|`|ihCzwMMtaa	If i were you i would go into the salon and get it stripped. I hope you didnt use nice and easy i have heard the pigments n that are tough to get out! try bleaching it with like 30 to 40 volume bleach leave it on till you get close to the color you want DONT SHAMPOO just rinse and condition. With the 40 try to minimize how much you get on your scalp and use a good deep conitioner like Enjoy for a week then try again this will defintely take steps i wish you the best of luck!
r4i7xPnMaa	Definitely drink more water, and try to sleep at a regular time. Do something that tires you out about an hour before you'd like to go to bed. Go for a run, take your dog for a long walk, go ride your bike, or hit the gym. Crank up your music (or plug in some headphones) and dance for as long as you can.<br>  <br>  Slice up some cucumbers, stick them in the fridge for a while until they get nice and cold, and stick 'em over your eyes. Leave them there for about 20 minutes.<br>  <br>  But seriously, if you can find a way to regulate your sleep schedule, that'd be your best bet. Melatonin is a great natural supplement that helps people fall asleep. It's pretty cheap ($3 for a bottle at walmart) and you only need to take one. It doesn't make you tired, it just helps your mind stop racing when you lay down and try to sleep. Try not to take them every night though. I don't think they're addicting, but it's best to stop taking them once you're over your sleep problem.|`|EPdYI9f1aa	Well, it sounds like you have a sleeping or possibly a heart condition, the 1st thing I would recommend is to go to the docter and get that diagnosed and get help for it so you can get more sleep. Also get more water to drink.Or, its just you eating and drinking too much sugar and caffine. Second, ( if you dont start to se thoose dark circles go away when you get more sleep) along with getting more sleep, you need to use skin care products directly for dark circles under your eyes.I would recommend this:<br>  <a href="http://www.outsidehealth.net/product-p/ohi20.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.outsidehealth.net/product-p/o...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/video_4405404_removing-dark-eye-circles-skin.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/video_4405404_removi...</a>|`|eow59EaEaa	I just answered another post about concealer and I recommended a concealer by a company called "Colortration" (<a href="http://colortration.com/)" rel="nofollow">http://colortration.com/)</a> I carry this is my makeup kit and use it on brides/actors that have really dark circles or birthmarks or even tattoos that need covering. <br>  <br>  You can order a sample pack for $15 with 6 different colors and they will last you a long time. They are super pigmented so a little goes a long way. Good luck!|`|goCugDOKaa	DEFINITELY SLEEP MORE!!! Oh my goodness, you poor thing!  4 hours?!?!????  Do you exercise?  you should exercise because it will help your sleeping patterns.  Get one of those sleep masks, the complete darkness will help you to sleep as well.  You should talk to your doctor about that.  Sleep is a HUGE part of your problem.  Drink a lot of water also, this will help(the circles, I mean.  Don't drink before bed because you'll need to pee and that will wake you up).  I think that the circles should be the least of your problems, you need to sleep!  Can you possibly take a nap during the day?  <br>  As far as the circles go, as I said, try to get more sleep. You can apply cold compresses like those freezable gel masks.  For makeup, use a highlighting primer like the one Sephora sells (<a href="http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?id=P216619&categoryId=C19066)." rel="nofollow">http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jh...</a>  Lancome has a product that reduces the circles called collasser 5x.  That works pretty well also.  <br>  Do your parents have these circles?  Have you always had them and they are just darker or are they completely new?  Because they are hereditary.  I have them, and I have always had them but they are exponentially worse when I am tired.|`|UIueiJnZaa	It's a little pricey (possibly ￡18) but it lasts FOREVER and works wonders.<br>  It's called 'erase paste' by Benefit and I use it every day.<br>  It really is great.

ER8L9croaa	i pierced my ear lobe the other day, i havent done cartilage but it wouldnt be too different just more painful and less blood.<br>  <br>  this is what i did: i didnt use ice to numb it but its probably a good idea ive heard it decreases the pain. anyway i used a sterile needle and i sterilised the ring with rubbing alcohol. i marked where i wanted to pierce and aligned the needle. then i just pushed through, it didnt hurt much at all even without ice. when i took the needle out it bled heaps, i dont think  this would happen with the cartilage. but then i put the jewlery in and it stopped bleeding.  id imagine it would be the same process for cartilage but probably more painful. although all up it was hardly painful, just a bit of uncomfortable pressure. <br>  <br>  dont forget to wash it twice a day with sea salt water solution, good luck! hope i helped|`|D9yeLgKkaa	i know you dont want to hear this but i would suggest going to claires and getting it done for 20$. <br>  <br>  but if you must do it yourself, *???*, watch the parent trap (w/ lindsay lohan) uncut edition (not the disney channel one because they cut out the part where one pierces the other's ear).|`|P2EhkEJVaa	first off, get a needle, ice, and a piece of apple, and an earring. grab a marker and put the dot where you want the earring to be,numb your ear for a few minutes and then put the piece of apple behind your ear. shove the needle through your ear until you hear the crunch of the apple, that means its all the way through. take the needle out and put the earring it. use a piercing earring so it doesn't get infected. <br>  TIP: have a friend do it!<br>  Waring: possible to hit a vein in your ear, so Research where the vein is and make sure you dont perice that spot. also if your parents dont know, possible you can get screamed at.|`|aXHo1Xeaaa	Q & A with Jeny!<br>  <br>  Q: how do i pierce my own cartilage?<br>  A: You dont, you go to a proffesional.|`|CZvFAuN4aa	DON'T!<br>  It'll just get infected and be for nothing.

20da7e19a185ca8c01b2a311761afcd6aa	I would go get it cut. Not really short, but maybe a little past the ears.<br>  That way you can just put a little bit of mousse or gel in it, and scrunch it up to give it more volume.<br>  <br>  It will be "big" hair. and if you want more volume, then just get it trimmed a little shorter.|`|zoifRCtMaa	you could straigten your hair|`|TlmnrxkTaa	Ok I have the same. My hair is almost a spiral curl though...I used to hate my hair so much but i learned that to get very good volume you should get almost a scene haircut...almost. and use conditioner and buy this hair product..sunsilk de-frizz. I use this and I never put mousse in anymore or any hairspray i take a shower and put the sunsilk in and then thats it...it gives your hair a very natural look. I hope i helped a little.

Sometimes tight pants look good to girls but if you are a mean jerk then more people are likely to label you as a creep or something. All girls have different preferences. I personally am not a big fan of tight pants but on the other hand, I'm not keen to baggy pants that fall down and the underwear showing. It's good to find a happy medium. Well fitted pants are good: not too tight, not too baggy so there shouldn't be many complaints there. You can't go too wrong with balance. <br>  Either way, it's up to you in the long run. If tight pants add to yor image and YOU like them, you wear 'em with pride!!!|`|6CUvU9D4aa	see thats the thing. some girls dont like it coz it seems so superficial and stupid. you said 'I play guitar and I skate so it makes perfect sense'. so it's almost like you think that it's just expected from you to wear that kinda stuff and THAT is what makes it so annoying.  just coz you do those things doesnt mean that you're expected to wear tight pants. its so stupid. but anyways i didnt mean to sound all mad. i'm just saying. good luck with guitar and skating <3 LOSE THE PANTS.|`|wVACBi1saa	okay some girls if like preppy or sumthing will prlly think ur emo or goth or sumthing like that ya know...lol.....but some girls that arent like that will prlly guys wearing tight pants....but not all girls like it but some do..if i was u i would go out with a girl that is kind of like u and not more high class like other ones if u get where im coming from.....like  a girl that is ur type and mite do the same things as u|`|1OEDcz6Raa	personally, i dont care what he wears- unless its like high waters lol. if he is a nice guy then it doesnt matter. but sometimes i dont like the tight pants on guys. makes them see emo or queer. and im sure your not- your just a skater.|`|6DxEDRReaa	it completely varies from girl to girl.

GZKbvXLLaa	First of all, here are a couple of links you can use to locate a salon that is most likely American, though not all are. Its a start in the right direction though. <br>  There are three salons in your town that uses CND products. If you look a little further on this site, you may be able to find a salon in a nearby town or city?<br>  <a href="http://www.creativenaildesign.com/Locate/Find-A-Salon.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.creativenaildesign.com/Locate...</a><br>  <br>  Here is a listing numerous salons in your area. I did a search using a 25 mile radius, so some of them may be a bit of a drive? Anyway, try here also:<br>  <a href="http://www.beautytech.info/locator/results_list.php?showsurrounding=1&zip=28117&radius=25&zipsearch=Show+Me.." rel="nofollow">http://www.beautytech.info/locator/resul...</a><br>  <br>  Just a few things about both gel and acrylic nails. First, neither should do any damage to your nails when applied properly. Generally, it is not the products used which damage your nails, its an unskilled tech who damages or even ruins them for you. The problem happens most often when a tech uses a Dremel drill on your natural nails. These tools are not meant to be used on nails, They are designed for hobbies such as woodworking, and so on. If you've been to a, um, shall we say a non-American owned and operated salon, chances are you had a Dremel drill used on you. Also the chances are pretty good that this is the reason why your nails look horrible after having the acrylic removed. So very many people wh have their nails done go to these 'discount' salons that I spoke of. Low prices, and fast service, but really? At what cost to you or anyone who goes to these places? I've seen it all too often from people who have gone to these salons and then complain how their nails hurt, or how they are ruined or whatever. I'd like to make one important point though. And that is an American salon can be just as bad. There are nail techs out there who simply don't give a you know what about your nails. They don't take pride in their work many times, and it shows. The thing you need to do is to find a salon with a rock solid good reputation for doing high quality work. Its not an easy task, but there are some really great nail techs out there. You just have to look around a bit. My suggestion is to call afew salons on those lists, and ask questions about their services. Let them address all of your questions and concerns. If they don't want to answer your questions, or cannot answer them, just say thanks, and hang up because they are probably hiding something, or aren't knowledgeable enough to answer your questions. This is definitely not a good sign at all. If that happens, move on to the next salon on your list, and so on until you find a few possibilities that interest you. <br>  Gel is applied as the form of a gel - exactly as the name implies. Gel is never a powder. Lots of salons, especially the discunt salons do this scam to unsuspecting people where they say they are applying gel nails on you, but instead apply acrylic and perhaps a gel topcoat on them to finish them off. Then, they charge you the full - higher, price for UV gel nails. It happens all the time. Here is a pic of what high quality, professional UV gels look like in the container they are packaged in...<br>  <a href="http://www.cnd.com/Home/homelink-consumer-Brisa-Gel.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.cnd.com/Home/homelink-consume...</a><br>  <br>  As you can see for yourself, these are gels - not powders. Its pretty simple really. If a tech ever uses liquid and powder on your nails, you have acrylic nails, not gel nails. Period. UV gel nails are typically filed off because most UV gels are non soakable. This means they cannot be removed in acetone in the way acrylic nails are removed. So, they must be filed off. There are some soakable gels on the market, but I don't recommend them.Stick with traditional UV gel systems for the best results. This is a consideration in itself because they are not the type of nails that you want to have applied if you are only going to wear them for a week, or two. These are meant to be worn for months at a time - even longer. The fills are done much the same way, except for the fact that gels are used, not acrylic.<br>  If you want a few gel product recommendations, here they are - in my own opinion...<br>  Avoid: IBD, Star Nails, Nailite, Bio Sculpture, Calgel, and any UV gel product in an unlabeled container. <br>  I recommend: Akzentz, Young Nails, LeChat, Light Elegance, CND Brisa, and LCN - this last company makes great products but the price will be high for a fll set. Beware of cheap imitations of LCN products. There have been cases of sleazy salons resing LCN containers and refilling them with their own no name gels. Not often, but it does happen. <br>  As for my preference for either acrylic or gel nails? I prefer gal nails any day over acrylics. Why? Because, to me, they are more natural looking, they are long lasting, they are odorless, non-yellowing- non-toxic, and they are typically every bit as durable as acrylic nails are. But, you need to find a highly skilled tech to apply high quality UV gel nails products on your nals. UV gel nails are easy enough to do, but th

I have a normal ring that my father bought me not even for the purpose of being a purity ring, however I use it as a reminder of my morals daily. <br>  <br>  As long as your ring gives you a soft reminder to stay true, any look is absolutely fine. <br>  <br>  Your ring sounds perfect! Especially because your mom gave it to you and that it is personalized to your birthday, it seems as though it has even more meaning.|`|6cNHFJG1aa	I think that is fine, ad long as it means something to you, and i like that you dont care what other people think about it.|`|GWiGH5D6aa	of course im 15 and have one. and mine isnt just a band it has a heart and all that on it. its good to have morals|`|bxFDVBpoaa	ABSOLUTELY! that is a good promise to yourself that shows you're responsible|`|st5reHVjaa	i think its great.<br>  and in general, purity rings are good.|`|gAOAdOHraa	Do what makes you happy.

NqWl2qlPaa	I have the same problem and winter and stress do not help.  Revlon puts out a cuticle remover, I think Sally Hansen or whatever that brand is does to.  My husband and I use it all the time,  it has a brown handle and a little cutter thing at the end that you use to take off the hanging dead skin.  Then constantly moisturize til it heals. As the skin grows in and heals you may have to trim it up again from time to time, but this tool is so small you can carry it with you easily.|`|VYRMz5qxaa	Trim them off with nail clippers so they don't snag or get any worse, after use cuticle cream daily, or just lotion because cuticle cream can be a bit pricey!|`|mHSaUWv4aa	Cut them off with nail clippers.|`|OrKLpzenaa	First start off by trimming your hangnails until there's no way you can create more yourself. This way if you do try to create more it will be painful, making you not want to mess with your fingers. Then you have to moisturize with some hand cream everyday. But it's not just dry skin it's about self control. You MUST stop messing with your fingers otherwise it won't get any better!|`|JyeGlmtkaa	just don't pick on them, I did and one of my fingers got infected (gross i know), maybe lotion will work|`|nRIk4aSBaa	use lots o' hand lotion.<br>  <br>  it will keeo them from starting|`|ufnSqRiqaa	The first thing you should do to treat them is to get a manicure.  You can get a cheap one at an Aesthetics school.  They have a tool that will help.  Also, did you know that in order to avoid hang-nails, you are supposed to regularly push your cuticle back or use a cuticle remover.  Use the nails from your other fingers or the round end of a finger-nail file to push it back or buy a cuticle remover.  My parents taught me that when I was little, but I've met quite a few people who didn't know that.

6npsRIzUaa	Get a monroe, it'd look best on you.<br>  <br>  I honestly can't give you a pain factor on it though, I had mine done after I got cavities filled so my lip was numb. Supposedly, they're supposed to hurt like a b***h. My bottom  lip was nothing though, pinch your bottom lip as hard as you can with your nails and it doesn't hurt nearly as much. <br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  labret piercings are the center of your lip.<br>  So if you go in a piercing parlor asking for a labret, you should be very clear where you want as most will assume you mean the center of your lip, as that's it's proper name.|`|62n8SMxkaa	I looked at your photos and in my opinion a monroe would suit you more than a labret (bottom lip)<br>  <br>  Though labrets (with just studs) do have a tendency to look surprisingly feminine on girls.<br>  <br>  I have my lip pierced. I have a labret on the left. And mine did not hurt.<br>  Because your lip is straight flesh almost, it is one of the piercings that hurt the least. The piercer will clamp your lip, push a needle through and leave the cannula in to guide the jewelery through. (Cannula is a hollow piece of plastic, they are used to insert IVs into patients)<br>  <br>  When my piercer pierced it, I felt the clamps on my lip and they didn't hurt at all, then he pushed the needle through which i felt begin to go through and then come out the other side. It is very quick and for me it was painless. Though keep in mind that everyone is different and for some people it can sting and throb and hurt straight away.<br>  <br>  Healing time is 4-6 weeks and I took mine out after 4. I've had no problems with it and mine also didn't hurt after I got it pierced. I felt no throbing or pain and mine also didn't swell.<br>  <br>  Against a belly piercing I don't know, but I would say it would either be the same or less.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|WTLxhbsDaa	hmm.... i suggest a labret piercing (bottom lip)<br>  they look far more aesthetically pleasing than monroes...<br>  <br>  i did mine earlier and am quite pleased at how it turned out:<br>  <a href="http://i40.tinypic.com/16jmp2o.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i40.tinypic.com/16jmp2o.jpg</a><br>  and i just cooled it with ice beforehand and it barely hurt! :)<br>  <br>  Edit: for pictures, see here:<br>  <a href="http://bmezine.com/pierce/05-lips/lab001.html" rel="nofollow">http://bmezine.com/pierce/05-lips/lab001...</a><br>  And for info on labrets (lip piercings) see here:<br>  <a href="http://wiki.bmezine.com/index.php/Labret" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.bmezine.com/index.php/Labret</a><br>  (click through or search to get to the other ones you are interested in)|`|x3TTsBToaa	I have a labret (lower middle lip) and medussa (upper middle lip)  I thought the upper hurt more, but not too much more.  The upper swelled up more though.  I don't have my belly done, so I can't compare to that.  But I had my eyebrow, nose and tongue done, and the lips were in the middle of the pain spectrum.
LBHJaqXoaa	I would add to it by adding swirls around it. That would spice it up without making it too girly.
Sr7iiZOgaa	Don't expect them to work that well. I heard they were cheap :p
LBHJaqXoaa	Yes, your lip swells for a couple of days after you get a lip tattoo. If it gets infected, it will get all hot and produce pus, just like a normal tattoo infection. You'll have to go to the doctor for antibiotics if it gets infected. It CAN fade quickly, but I have heard of some people keeping their inner lip tattoos for 7 years or more. I guess it depends on the person.|`|ll5lS1wmaa	The answer above is all correct, but I'd just like to add that whether or not it fades quickly depends on how well you take care of it and how good your tattoo artist is. I know one girl who got her inner lip tattooed and it faded after about 6 months, whereas I know another who has had one for 3 years without having to get it touched up so far.

It sounds like they may be a bit tight, because they wont embed that quickly. <br>  <br>  If you're really worried about it, head back to the claires.

yJjkelGoaa	Okay well of course you'll have to have long hair, if not, you'll have to grow it. <br>  <br>  Then you will need to dye your hair closest to this color as possible (the best way to do that is to take the picture into a salon and ask for that color)<br>  <br>  Next, if your hair is naturally straight you are going to need to curl it and this is how you will do it to get that wavy texture without making you look like a hippy.<br>  <br>  You'll need a 1and1\2 inch curling iron. Take a strand of your hair and pull it outwards and away from your head.<br>  <br>  Next, take the curling iron and start to curl the hair. You are going to want to roll the curling iron in a backwards direction (roll the barrel away from your face)<br>  <br>  This keeps the hair out of your face because it is curled back and give you a tousled look.|`|kufTDbXSaa	Using a curling iron or a flat iron (it works both) If your hair is naturally straight its gonna be hard to get them to stay.|`|gXxyJOEtaa	hot rollers try conair they have a really good selection|`|07hmAcA1aa	you style it like her|`|GDB8pRx6aa	blow dry it when its wet, as you go through it with a round brush.<br>  <br>  ANSWER MY QUESTION ?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aqv00TqNbY.0BNmnq2xAve_AFQx.;_ylv=3?qid=20090226162939AAaTvrJ">http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>
6npsRIzUaa	To be perfectly honest, your best bet is going to your piercer to let them open/close them for you, I have segment rings in my septum and snakebites, they're the biggest pain in the *** ever. You could use needle nose pliers with tape on the ends, (I actually used a thin pair of scissors once, let me tell you...bad idea) if you have the extra money to drop on actual openers/closers, I'd get them.

If you're confident, youre more likely to make jokes, be more fun around and do more daring things, like flirt. If youre less confident, its not neccesarily a bad thing, but it can bring less attention to you, although there are a lot of guys who think being shy and sort of hidden away are cute.|`|Qmmtr1CGaa	Yes and no guys like girls who believe in them selves but not girls who are so confident there really superficial confidence is good because it helps you to be yourself.. <br>  and guys like that it doesnt necessarily make girls hotter it just makes them more exciting xox|`|EpwgdthNaa	yes

Feel free to wear whatever you want. Don't let people call you names because of your interest in makeup. It's your choice, after all. <br>  Just buy the girl's stuff.

Wearing mascara in a dark shade of brown would be flattering, as it looks natural and if you wear black, it looks more obvious.<br>  <br>  Same goes for the eyeliner. The girl's stuff is fine. Find a shade that suits you best and it doesn't really matter if it's Mascara or Manscara!<br>  Tip: Try to choose an eyeliner than is made of an ingredient called kohl. It goes on softer and is easier to remove!|`|lOgs3cOmaa	dont buy the manscarra. just the guyliner. im not here to tell you that metrosexuals suck.(actually, im gonna tell all those homophobes to **** OFF!) but i have a friend to bought the manscarra, and he hated it. just the guyliner. trust me. and honustly, for the question, get the quality girls. theres no difference.|`|Zmmg8O4Oaa	Men look hot with eye liner on so ignore all the comments, I've never heard of manscara but hey why not!<br>  <br>  I know boys that use foundation and are straight, nothing wrong with it makes em look beta!

That should thin it out and give you an even surface.  If you don't like that and you want something new altogether, I like cover girl clean make-up for the cheap stuff.  If you are willing to spend a bit more, you might like Lancome's Color Ideal.  It is thinner and it glides on nicely.  But... it's $37.  Personally, I think it ends up paying for itself.  Are you using a moisturizer?  If you aren't, you should.  That gives you a smooth surface and will prevent that spotty nonsense.  A primer will help as well.

t3zEvX2Gaa	if your hair is not stick straight, yes they work awesomely. Thats why hairdressers use them when they are styling curly hair! =) even if you have just a little wave, a diffuser will bring it out so much more than letting it dry natural. You can buy one anywhere really. grocery stores where they sell hair products will have them. But make sure you buy one that fits your blow dryer. they arent universal. Or you can go into a beauty supply store. Bring your blowdryer see if itll fit. Or if you need a new blowdryer alot of times they will come together. At a  beauty supply store sometimes you can add one in for cheap. hope this helps!

So it left like a little rug burn feeling the next morning but i just kept it clean and dry.  <br>  <br>  If you got it on your urethra it might be different.  Try WEB MD <br>  or consult a doctor.  If you like E-mail me tomorrow I work by UM hospital in Miami Ill ask Dr. Rafael Antun a buddie of mine who is a Urologist.   Hopefully the symptoms subside before then mami. <br>  <br>  Take it easy.|`|twVyisGnaa	Yeah, hair removal cream burns like hell if you leave it on any part of your body too long.  Not a good idea to put it in your genital area.  It's better if you stick to waxing it.  And you better get checked with a doctor (a female one) in case something happens like a yeast infection or something.<br>  <br>  VIVA LA RAZA!|`|sQ3PG8Ewaa	I left mine on too long on my legs, and it literallly cut me.<br>  Goodbye skin!|`|0E8SPyyXaa	Ouchhhhhhhhh Lol idk maybe put some lotion or some aloe vera to cool down the burn get better lol|`|SS5py9jIaa	Ouch. That stuff burns. How could you forget for a whole hour?? <br>  <br>  You need to neutralise the chemical somehow... does it say on the packaging what to do? Obviously get yourself into a cool bath to rinse that off properly... apply some burn cream to try to stop infections from developing. Normally I'd offer a joke.... like all you need is a willing tongue to sooth it... but that stuff burns so much the last thing you want anyone to do is touch it. Poor lil red snapper.|`|mBVXgRLFaa	you really cant do anything. that stuff will take your skin off with it, thats why theres a limit. you just have to wait for it to heal. you could try lotion but not with like fragrance and stuff cause it will just make it burn.|`|bhgQjEIMaa	HAHAHA nice|`|9N6sW6KAaa	Check for the yeast infection.|`|FxLKs5Vbaa	you are probably going to have a yeast infection now. go to the doctor.|`|nv1NCh14aa	LOL|`|6npsRIzUaa	...I lol'ed.<br>  <br>  But uh,  wow..ouch. <br>  Sucks to be you.|`|l4DpWVnBaa	you know, i just got done playing basketball for 2 1/2 hours. I'm kind of old now..lol. Well my lower back was killing me. i had bought some bengay about a year ago because of my knees. I checked the exp date. It was fine. I put it on, Omg i thought i was going to die. i was trying everything to get it off. so i feel your pain|`|dDtRxiu7aa	hey wat have u done to ur genital area.... is ur friend an expert in the usage of that stuff down there?<br>  do 1 thing...is ur hairs been fully removed from there?<br>  if so....then apply DOVE mosturizing cream. it will reduce the irritation. at night before u go to bed apply coconut oil mixed with a pinch of camphor on that area throughly. dont wear costumes that scratches that area. this will surely reduce ur irritation in a day r 2. and when it burns during peeing take an ice cube and apply around that area. dont b afraid. its nothing but when u remove hairs from that area moisturiser also get lost n the area becomes dry causing irritation n burns. when waxing the moisturizer is not lost n u feel comfortable with. try it friend. it will definitely pay u.. take care...|`|lqQX8mzzaa	Gotta love the attention seeking questions that illustrate just how dumb they really are. Who puts Nair on and forgets? How do you forget a cream on your vagina?|`|nRIk4aSBaa	Um <br>  any hair remover says<br>  <br>  <br>  DO  NOT USE ON GENITAL AREAS.<br>  <br>  <br>  God way to read the back<br>  <br>  <br>  Go to a Doctor|`|xcxMB4Rlaa	Wow...I left Nair on my legs for like 10 minutes and when I washed it off I had cuts on my legs.  I can't imagine how your vagina must feel.  But it does say not to use on genitals...anyway, you could try aloe.  It's great for soothing your skin. As much as possible, stay naked.  Or wear a long shirt or a robe with no underwear.  The friction of fabric rubbing against the irritated skin will only make things worse.  If you have to wear clothing, you could try baby powder to prevent chaffing.  And moisturize, moisturize, moisturize with a fragrance free moisturizer.|`|AYkEwqRXaa	Ouch!  That's a big no no!  Should've stuck to the waxing.  Nothing you can do at this point.  Just grin and bear it.  Probably more bearing it than grinning.  Live and learn.

1Thb8v1yaa	the first one is a CBR(captive bead ring) and im guessing thats the one ur talking about. <br>  <br>  these are VERY difficult..especially if you dant have experience with them.<br>  there is a certain tool you can use to open the ring and close it aroun the ball..but considering you dont have that...its going to be very hard to get the bead back on.<br>  <br>  you just have to match the ends of the hoop with the little indents on the ball. good luck sweetie.|`|96Frq9uUaa	i have one like that. on mine, the ball screws off, and then you put it in and screw it back in|`|24sK6L2uaa	Oh I hate captive ring balls. I found the easiest way to do it without a tool is get one indent on the ball matched up to the hoop and then push the other one in. I refuse to get those for that reason though. Good Luck.
jlXPsVfdaa	Nope.  It is a sign that a woman cares about her appearance to try to enhance it.|`|az0Z0DIjaa	I have no clue what guys think about makeup. I think it gives people the wrong idea if you wear TOO MUCH. But if you're jsut wearing foundation...I don't think so! I have acne, I don't feel so ugly and have a little bit more self worth when I wear makeup.|`|K7vCWru6aa	No, I think you're just trying to make a better self and by doing that I think appearance is important, you have to accept and like what you look like if it's wearing or not wearing make-up. Your brothers may see you a different way because they aren't you and they're guys..Everyone has another point of view, you just can't please everyone.|`|9c244c59042d84acae56e2fb2ddf1f33aa	I'm a girl and I have to say that I feel your pain.  I have always thought the same way- is it me being fake to enhance my lashes and do things like that when i don't look that way when i wake?<br>  <br>  My boyfriend thinks I look prettier with it on, but thinks i look beautiful even when i don't.<br>  <br>  i have acne too, it sucks :(|`|zD9YIdvKaa	Well not really as long as you don't wear too much.<br>  It's false advertising when celebrities airbrush and photoshop every single picture. It's even worse when people get plastic surgery.|`|s3FWCRGxaa	not false advertising. its enhancing thats all. most people look better with make up than without.. well those who know how to wear it lol|`|trVft2udaa	Not at all! Its an art to do make up and leave people wondering if you have worn any. If you do not look made-up and are using good cosmetics, i think its not bad. <br>  <br>  I had read this article on looking good naturally, it was a wonderful eyeopener. Here's the website <a href="http://www.beyondjane.com/Beauty/Get-Naturally-Gorgeous-in-Eight-Days.186145" rel="nofollow">http://www.beyondjane.com/Beauty/Get-Nat...</a>
24sK6L2uaa	Tanning can be dangerous but so is staying inside out of the sun. The sun provides nutrients and vitamins your body needs also. I say go out like you normally do and if your out for a long time wear sun block.|`|RvVvaVsAaa	yes that is true because you are not in the real UVA and UVB rays. a simple lotion is WAYYYYY better for you!|`|NPgJCWNjaa	tanning in the sun is dangerous.<br>  tanning in the tanning beds is dangerous.<br>  lotions work, but can streak.<br>  spray tans are usually tacky.<br>  <br>  so i dont really know what to say, but maybe if you put it on your face you'd breakout. depends on your skin.
YWaUaPaSaa	I think Wal Mart sells them in the one day pack. They have a eye doctor there too I think. You can try there, it might just be at super WalMart though, good luck and have fun!|`|rXInAcURaa	well you can go to a contact specialist and say you want to try them out, like a demo. they will give you one for each eye, that will last for a month, that normally free or to 20$.

RvVvaVsAaa	typically for an hour. you put it on dry hair and then wash it off. if your hair is very damaged you could try leaving it on over night and washing it off in the morning!|`|rEafqKDYaa	Sometimes i do that and it works awesome. What i do is i get my hair wet but just a little bit by splashing water around my head and then brushing it out. After that i just massage olive oil in my hair and then leave it in for about twenty minutes or so. When it is in your hair take a wide tooth comb pick or a hair brush and comb out your hair.Then i take a shower and wash it out really good. Otherwise it will make your hair greasy. E-mail me if you have any more question. Hope that this helps

This is a result of poor aftercare usually (people forget that a fresh tattoo is an open wound) and generally speaking nothing to do with the tattoo artist. But these are easily curable, and very rare.<br>  <br>  Even rarer, there is the tiny risk of allergic reaction to the ink. This usually happens with red or yellow inks, but as I said, is extremely rare these days, I've never heard of it happening to anybody. And once again, it's nothing that can't be cured.<br>  <br>  If someone has a pre-existing skin condition such as eczema, tattoos have been known to irritate the skin and cause fresh breakouts.<br>  <br>  Then there is the almost-zero risk of blood borne viruses. This is your HIV, Hepatitis, MRSA, so on so forth. I say almost-zero, this is when speaking of reputable studios. There has never been a documented case of HIV from a tattoo in a reputable studio. They have expensive sterilising equipment (autoclaves, the same things that are used in hospitals, so you're just as likely to get HIV from a shot needle) and are invariably trustworthy. So stay out of the kitchens and the back street parlours and you're fine.<br>  <br>  The cancer rumour is rubbish. There is no link, it's not even in question.<br>  <br>  You're more likely to get hit by a car on the way to the studio than you are going to get ill due to the tattoo. The risks aren't a factor in my decisions because I know how to take care of my tattoos (which your artist will tell you about) and I know I go to a reputable place.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I love getting thumbs downs for answers that involve zero opinion and are factually accurate. It amuses me how many clueless people there are out there :-)
kCdISEGqaa	This comes directly from the Pennsylvania law book.  I am in Ohio, so I am fairly familiar with the Pennsylvania laws.<br>  <br>  tattooing of minors is prohibited; new restrictive codes; illegal for cosmetologist to provide permanent makeup in salon according to the State Board of Cosmetology<br>  <br>  You could refer to <a href="http://www.aaatattoodirectory.com/tattoo_regulations.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.aaatattoodirectory.com/tattoo...</a> for more information.<br>  <br>  That is just a small part of the section code.  Hopefully it's helpful.  Not even with parental consent is it possible.|`|lIpjuMTHaa	You are way too young and your mom should know better. You arent going to want the same types of tattoos now that you will when you are older, you need to wait.|`|d9B4EVFxaa	I'm from PA and I believe you have to be at least 16 even with parental consent...some shops wont even tattoo you with consent...I actually know of a couple shops that don't allow anyone under the age of 18 in!! so I'm going say your just going to have to wait!!<br>  <br>  I know its hard!! And trust me I will be the last one to lecture you about age...because I was 16 when I got my first...just make sure its something your ready to live with for the rest of your life!!

EmOnt7FIaa	Nope. <br>  <br>  Guys like to dominate the relationship, so when guys know they are bigger than they feel like they have all the power.|`|xbISxnmfaa	No and your not short sized your fun sized. Guys find tiny girls adorable.|`|shaO0coWaa	I find that most guys find short girls attractive and prefer to date them but I can't speak for all guys.|`|GEyJMsaKaa	Some guys do,and some guys don't. I do know that most guys don't like girls that are taller than they are. I am 14 and 5'6....I am tall but I don't go out with guys that have certain tastes like height. A guy should be interested in you for who you are. Some guys out there like short girls,but some prefer girls with long legs....It really depends on what type of guy he is.<br>  <br>  God bless :)|`|UpJbXh7Vaa	I'm 16 and 5'1"...but I have never had a boyfriend.

As for me, when I was around your age, a girls height didn't mean anything to me.|`|ST8SqDZzaa	Well, it seems as though the cutest girls are short.|`|411c9e50db3e6aa419765275e1da7d4aaa	no, of coarse not. guys love girls in general.|`|1P5qWMQ0aa	No.|`|vVZLY82Iaa	No not that big a deal|`|2ef2c0e844e19038f6a979bb78073d8daa	no, not at all.|`|rBYqlytYaa	im 14 and 5'0  sure =D|`|nKuf2yl1aa	I've only encountered a significantly small number of men who are not necessarily 'turned off' by short girls, but by far 'prefer' tall girls. This usually applies to mean who are freakishly tall (6"3 + etc).<br>  <br>  While that may be the case for a few guys, I'd say most guys love petite girls. Tiny can be very cute and plays into the psychological elements of attraction based on the theory of 'neoteny'. Many men are subconsciously attracted to child like features, such as round cheeks, baby face, big eyes and being tiny statured. <br>  <br>  Alot of guys also are able to recognize their preference for short girls, they just find them so darn cute is my guess.|`|sYO70GJRaa	Its who you are that matters, a couple of inches either way shouldn't affect people's perception of you, and if it does, then they are morons anyway. <br>  lol my boyfriend is pretty short so it's a good thing I am too because we are the perfect size for each other. <br>  <br>  Likewise,loads of good looking guys are short :)|`|EFGKxSsVaa	a lot of my buddies dont like short girls, because they feel like they're kissing like a little kid or something, which i can understand but not all guys are like that. many guys like short girls! but at the end of the day, guys dont usually notice a girl for their height, short or tall! the other things like personality, count more ;p|`|W7l1awFPaa	We don't find shorter ladies unattractive, just the opposite in many cases.  The only thing that I find is the occasional inconvenience involved in things like dancing or having to bend down for a kiss.

hXQ56DQKaa	If it's semi-formal, then definitely don't wear anything sparkly; that's too evening-y. And try to toss in some brighter colors with that black to brighen things up a bit. If I were you, I would wear a light pink cami with big silver jewlery--like a silver chain with a big heart. And wear those thick bangles in different warm colors like red, pink, etc. or a juicy coture charm bracelet as shown here: <a href="http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/3008706/0~2376779~6008000~2375352?mediumthumbnail=Y&origin=category&searchtype=&pbo=2375352&P=4" rel="nofollow">http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/3008706/0~23...</a>    but I think bangles would be better--more color and such. You know what would actually be better than thick bangles? Something like this: <a href="http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/2999993/0~2376779~6008000~2375352?mediumthumbnail=Y&origin=category&searchtype=&pbo=2375352&P=4" rel="nofollow">http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/2999993/0~23...</a>   it's got style and color, but it's also got a more formal, classier air to it. For the necklace, try <a href="http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/3028486/0~2376779~6008000~2375351?mediumthumbnail=Y&origin=category&searchtype=&pbo=2375351&P=2" rel="nofollow">http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/3028486/0~23...</a>   this; it matches the second set of bangles, even if it's not exactly what I was thinking. This one, however, is cuter and has more character/style to it and still matches: <a href="http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/3017860/0~2376779~6008000~2375351?mediumthumbnail=Y&origin=category&searchtype=&pbo=2375351&P=2" rel="nofollow">http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/3017860/0~23...</a>  <br>  <br>  Keep in mind that these are ideas--even if you don't like the exact product, you now have an idea in mind of what to do with it. These are a littllle on the expensive side, but I'm sure you could find something quite similar for less.|`|4bWUiIVdaa	Unless you're pregnant, don't get that dress|`|fMPyLqW4aa	I would wear neon tights.

6npsRIzUaa	Research it with your parents, find everything you can about it online and show them the pros and cons, research a local reputable piercing parlor online, go to it with your parents and discuss the piercers preferred process of piercing it and aftercare and etc (make sure to pay attention that they use sterile out of the package needle and clamps and that the whole place is clean in general). Check your schools rules on piercings (if you go to school) just incase, because even though it's not likely anyone will see it if you got caught they CAN force you to remove it. Just basically show your parents your serious about this, be as mature as you can about it and keep them involved, chances are they'll say yes.<br>  <br>  I've done the same thing with my mom with all nine of my piercings, she definitely appriceated being involved and understanding everything about the piercing(s) I was getting and wanted to get.<br>  <br>  And WTF at the story saying to pierce it yourself if you're not 16 and that you were both drunk?? Any reputable, or hell even a halfway decent piercer would NOT pierce anyone under any kind of influence. And telling the girl to stick a needle or safety pin in her belly button but then not recommending it? Christ, are you possibly drunk now? Every state (or country, or whatever deoending where you live) varies for its laws on what age you do and don't need consent, it also depends on the piercer how young they'll pierce what (only one out of about twenty shops would pierce my septum since I was under 18 at the time, completely different piercing but it was just an example).|`|QhT9MjEoaa	You're too young to get your belly pierced! Enough said.|`|rg2nTroiaa	well, my mom is really cool and let me get mine. we actually did it together haha in wisconsin dells. good times. (in all honesty we were both drunk) haha. and i am 16. you have to be 16 and have parental consent anyways because they WILL ask for ID. and before you get it, make sure you are going to a SAFE and CLEAN place. make them show you the needle as they open in from a completely sealed container, and don't let them leave with the needle! i paid $60 FOR MINE, its not cheap hun. sorry. and it DOES hurt, but honestly only for about 2 to 3 seconds then it goes away. and you also walk a little funny after you get it. almost like you just **** your pants. its funny actually. haha. but you have to be 16 unless you do it yourself with a safety pin or needle..................which im so NOT recommending.|`|HNvT8Kroaa	show her that your responsible enough too get the piercing.<br>  as in takeing care of it & such.
AAKdb6Eraa	1. For your dry hair, use conditioner on the ends ONLY. <br>  2. For the greasiness, don't use conditioner all over your head, and try to keep your hair off of your face. If you want your bangs on your forehead, use loose powder on your forehead to absorb the oil so your hair won't pick it up. <br>  3. In order to keep your bangs together, part your hair to the side when it's wet. Then blast your hair straightener along the part with hot air first, then cold air, until your roots are dry. this will keep the bangs together for the whole day. :)|`|R52qGbg5aa	For your dry hair, try using 'Tresemmee Thermal Recovery'. And for greasy hair, before you go to bed, hop in the showeer, and then afterwards, blowdry your hair, and slip it back in a pony tail.|`|PizXrl2oaa	I used to have this problem.  Use regulating shampoo/conditioner.  Don't use moisturizing shampoo.

4OSUuCGOaa	hey Cassi, Seems to be a lot of PRUDES out there. If you want to go "Au Natural" then do so, but I would think it would depend on skirt length. I mean you woudn't want to go bare with a micro skirt. Tooooo risky. But with longer skirts I see no problem. Air conditioned!!!|`|NSEJbsD8aa	You must be wearing some really tight skirts if they allow for VPL...<br>  <br>  Anyway, please don't go commando in a skirt.  Not only is it BEYOND tacky, but it's also unsanitary--sounds like an infection waiting to happen.|`|WItdtl0Vaa	I'd wear a thong in case something should happen.|`|mQhYZk2eaa	thong :)|`|6qsocyK3aa	I think thongs are ugly but if you're wearing a skirt and don't want VPL, then even I would wear one. Imagine if you fell over. But you can get normal briefs that are made so you don't get VPL. I think they're skin coloured and and really thin with no bordered or patterned or elasticated edges.|`|13LutlWBaa	just wear normal panties or whatever, don't go "au natural" haha it makes things really awkward.|`|AA11840910	Thong, you need to wear underwear if you're wearing a skirt|`|6bryNB1raa	eww wear summit unless ur goin to go stand on a street corner|`|WR4cYLd4aa	Think of it this way- you trip and fall in public.

Underwear is overrated.|`|e134uC0oaa	No you gotta wear something.

JAL0HMWiaa	1) buy eyelash primer to put on before mascara<br>  2) put alot on ? oh and use the dry powder coverup overtop of liquid.<br>  3) don't talk to guys. lol <br>  um put a bit of powder coverup there<br>  <br>  and as for the lighting thing..yeh that happens to everyone it sucks but school washrooms always do that to make people look bad ...don't stress you look normal everywhere else : )|`|YSbCVt3Uaa	I don't know what kind of make up you use. Try Revlon Colorstay foundation it covers everything from spider veins to pimples and red blotchy skin. It is sweat proof and it stays on all day. It looks the same in the morning as the evening. Also its not greasy, watery, or heavy feeling. You don't really feel this foundation. <br>  <br>  As for the mascara. Try waterproof mascara. Although I think mascara tends to look fake to start with. Especially if it rains or you cry or it smears. Just curl your eyelashes use a little eyeliner and stay away from mascara. <br>  <br>  Also, you might want to try touching up your makeup after lunch. Like put more lipstick or gloss on and apply blush. This should keep you looking fresh all day.|`|1A1ozEaKaa	omgsoh. i have the same problems! i read it and i was like holy sh*t; that's me! okay to answer your questions..it's prbably from oily skin or bad makeup. or both.<br>  <br>  1) covergirl lashblast aka giant orange mascara :D it's big and lasts a while..plus, curl your lashes with an eyelash curler..it will last forever, if not longer :D<br>  <br>  2) use l'oreal's longer lasting products; the infallibles and whatnot..also spehora film strips are greta ofr picking up excess oil but leaving your makeup intact..mac and smashbox have similar produts, but from what i hear, sephora is teh best..some pppl use tiolet seat covers, but it's your choice<br>  <br>  3) this coudl be for a wide variety of reason...rosacean, allergues, etc..but ask a doctor or something,, but don't owrry about it...i have to put on blush to get taht healthy glow..consider yourself lucky!<br>  <br>  hope taht helped..good luck :)|`|goCugDOKaa	1.

6npsRIzUaa	It should be fully healed now, I don't know what to tell you other than sea salt soak it 2-3 times a day and go have your piercer check it out, I have 4 lip piercings and I've never had this problem, hopefully everything's fine.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  3-6 times a day? That's overkill and will dry out her/his skin if (s)he's soaking it. The only reason I'd soak it more than  three times a day is if the piercer thinks it'd be best OR of (s)he's just wiping it with a q-tip after every meal. No...it is not normal for a lip piercing to be white around it a month after being pierced, that sounds very wrong. And a year? uh..no. Lip piercings do not take a year to fully heal.<br>  <br>  That's not true, the "if you leave it in a year it won't close up" i had my lip rings in for a year and had to, unfortunately, remove them and they closed by the next morning. I research all my piercings beforehand and I've never heard of them taking a year to completely heal. <br>  <br>  And by sea salt bottle I'm gussing you mean H2Ocean? That's different then.|`|PSNlx2M1aa	Your piercing is fine, i got my labret done a month ago as well. its still healing but you could change it now that's the only difference. A labret can take up to a year to fully heal. All you have to do is clean it 3-6 times a day and it';; go away within 2 weeks.<br>  <br>  Yes they do, i researched it before i actually got mine and if you look at the history of labret rings you would know. Plus on the sea salt bottle it says 3-6 times a day and i'm saying that it might heal in a month but will still close up if u take it out more then a day but In a year it'll be permanent and will not close up.

dc5579dda31633fb3c2d8612ff7583cdaa	Personally, girls that look more natural, with makeup and hair color, are more beautiful. They appear to have that natural beauty. Most girls would love to have your natural hair color. Platinum blonde can look trashy if not done properly and of course having black underneath is not at all natural looking. You can get natural highlights by using lemon juice on your hair, which is a lot safer than dyes, and you will look great!|`|jtYL9Qqnaa	If you want.. i dont really like it lol|`|RvVvaVsAaa	its out! ehh SKUNK!|`|BCgp7GTpaa	my boyfriend always liked this look.|`|ujG8d3X7aa	That Would Look Cute <3<br>  xo;;|`|G2NoXxDVaa	not|`|XW1Fr9i6aa	you need to look at celebrity photos and see if you have similar eyebrows and eye color as a celebrity with that color hair. also you could just go to a professional colorist.|`|WKAluS8xaa	DEAR GOD THAT IS SO TRASHY. <br>  please dont, it will ruin everything. its not unique. at all. it is tacky- if you want to look unique, do something NEW.|`|nv1NCh14aa	No it's like..scene...and scene is not unique..every girl these days are trying to be scene..be real go with a natural color.|`|1DMikbqnaa	it might conflict with your natural color, be careful where you put the blonde and don't put too much of it. good luck (:|`|cCWTvEZTaa	yes on some people i would do the blonde first then black so they colors don't bleed together and get very damaged|`|0uFo9RcZaa	i think it looks fake|`|jI2j3wd8aa	yes go for it!|`|1vKY3Usaaa	it would make you look like a S K U N K!|`|7ZlWNiacaa	I think you should!

rPFfDR7Laa	i'm all for guys wearing tight jeans. it's super hot.  but try to find guy skinny jeans.  girl jeans look really awkward and not hot around the crotch area and the butt on guys.  look at zumiez.com or pacsun.  lookk for ones with a 10 inch leg opening at the bottom.  it will usually say what size the opening is.  14" leg opening is what guys jeans usually are, but they do sell them much tighter. <br>  <br>  however, tight girl jeans are better than no tight pants at all :)<br>  <br>  i like volcom jeans.  and forever 21.  and delia's.  and tripp pants (they sell them at hot topic).  keep in mind you can easily tailor your pants to make them even skinnier!|`|vslxWc5waa	if you want girl jeans for the skinny jean look, i'd go for levi guy jeans, they're skinny jeans that are for guys and look good on guys.<br>  but if you reeeaally want girl jeans, i'd say a size three tall.|`|Y8tcUuWjaa	why would you want girl jeans?

6npsRIzUaa	Take it out, and never get pierced again because sweetheart, right there you just proved that you are not mature enough or responsible enough to be pierced. Why was it so hard for you to respect your mothers wishes that you couldn't wait until june or july that you risked f**king up your lip by self-piercing? No, make up does not work, that would irritate the piercing. Taking it in and out like you are will irritate the piercing. No, you can't pass it off as a pimple as someone suggested, no one on this earth could be stupid enough to believe that. Either tell your mom, or take it out.|`|OdUZ7NNnaa	wow. yu'd rather have a hole in yur lip than live in a omcfy house?<br>  <br>  i dont think yur mature enough to live on yur own..|`|RjA7REToaa	let it close and then when you do move out on your own go and pierce it dont do it now i mean you dont want to get kicked out so just let it closed trust me letting it close will be better in the long run|`|qNOeBcvraa	u can pierce it later, u got a good place to live. id rather that than a lip ring anyday. im 24 and my lip has been pierced for 5 years but if i had to choose between my house or my lip, ummm lets see!!!!!!!!!!!!!  my friggin home!!!|`|HzjeKsDJaa	girk just wait till you are 18 whats the hurry? you could get an infection doing it yourself|`|bhgQjEIMaa	ur stupid! y even do dat?|`|nRIk4aSBaa	Say that its  a pimple<br>  <br>  then get mad at her for bringing it up.<br>  <br>  <br>  then after a while say it's a scar from that pimple<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  then get really mad and sad.<br>  <br>  she will leave you alone  :)
vslxWc5waa	you could easily google it.<br>  techno is a form of music, not really a style.<br>  it's all about beat and pace, it's upbeat and fast.<br>  it has a wirey sound, that's different from all other types of music.<br>  <br>  i guess if you were trying to look 'techno', you'd wear metalics, mostly solid colors, with metallic waist belts, long shirts, leggings, and hair would be without layers and be symmetrical. the look would be more futuristic.|`|GzhqyESwaa	I have never heard about "dressing techno".|`|RDkhoJU0aa	ive never heard anyone say that they dress techno|`|rQwI2Yycaa	I don't know what its about but I know they wear a lot of glow lights.

tY4hOjqdaa	This is an easy one. First give ur hair some extra body - big hair was in for the 80's. High heels with cute socks like blk with pink, that was a fad, mini skirts with tight tops(short or long sleeve), also larger waist belts. Watch the movie fast times at Ridgemont High or any of the brat pack movies from the 80's, you will have plenty of ideas and see what variations and styles were worn.|`|IPATFSAcaa	We had 80's day at our school! Here's what you do.<br>  Get a solid colored sweatshirt (the brighter the better) and cut the neck out so it hangs off your shoulder. Then put another bright tank top under it.

There are some good powders out there that are creme to powder so they act like powder but last better.<br>  As for your mascara you may find that you get to hot for it and hense it melts, try using a good one such as Blinc or try a different shade as this can really open your eyes up.|`|goCugDOKaa	For makeup, if you like the compressed, you can't beat Lancome's Dual Finish.  As far as the mascara goes, try using a clear mascara, or skip mascara altogether on the bottom lashes for daytime.

y0BGhwdVaa	Your best bet would be to get clip in extensions. They can be pricey but they are worth it.

PumYhJSvaa	It depends on if you're talking about eyelashes you glue on yourself or eyelash extensions. I wear falsies all the time, but I never shower or sleep with them on.

43b449e71378d0dec39fb85dd9c6b70daa	Go buy neutragena acne medication (they have several types, I buy the overnight one - you put it on in a few minutes it sinks in and in a few days your skin is nice again). Everything you buy for acne essentially exfoliates the skin - just the ingredients are different... Some are harsher than others. You don't want to overdry the skin that makes it worse not better - so less is more in this case... If you  over do it, you can make it worse by agitating the skin so be careful... Sometimes the skin just needs to go through an ugly phase - not something you want to hear but its true... <br>  <br>  You may also want to buy a good vitamin E cream or lotion - that will help moisturize the skin and repair and roughness and texture... <br>  <br>  Between those 2 products (they are the ones I use) you'll turn it around - but it may take about a week (depending how bad it is)... But it sounds like you've aggrevated your skin by trying to get rid of the acne too aggresively... <br>  <br>  You get acne for a bunch of reasons - it could be a reaction to something, it could be from stress, and it could also be hormonal (along the jaw line and the neck is almost always hormone driven for females)... <br>  <br>  Fighting acne is a never ending battle (for me too)! Sometimes you just have to wait it out a bit...   :)|`|HjYnJFMgaa	just relax, before the date just apply some cover up, foundation and powder :) that should help you, just make sure the foundation matches your skin tone. and dont forget about mascara and eyeliner :)|`|4sW8MFxCaa	don't panic<br>  if there's zits use toothpaste over night<br>  it will dry it out and (sounds disgusting) but use tweezers to take off the scab<br>  don't scratch it, it'll scar<br>  for the little bumps, try an overnight product<br>  they don't usually work, but for me it works with those tiny ones<br>  and red dots are easier to cover with make up<br>  use a green concealer first, then go light on the foundation, then powder<br>  go light on the eye makeup<br>  if some bumps show threw, you'll look a mess<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK:]|`|mD4Xn3jNaa	use green tea bags<br>  drink the green tea then after your done put it on your face.<br>  after about however long you want you can wash the green tea if you dont like the feeling|`|uAzToWC7aa	its probably a rash or acne. use a mild cleanser, and then wear lotion, and rinse it off with cold water, and make use of conealor and if you could, have a date somewhere in the darkish settings.

hXQ56DQKaa	You know those headbands that are like these circlets you put on top of your head? Have you seen those? Lots of stars have been wearing them lately, and they have a bit of a hippie feel to them. Also, if you get like a brightly colored/patterened/flowery-type piece of cloth (see the yahoo! avatar) and tie it around your head in the same style as the headbands, that's pretty hippie. Also, wear bright-colored t-shirts and lots bell bottom jeans. <br>  <br>  Your accessories should be mostly, like, flowery and stuff. Like a colorful, not silver necklace with a flower pendant on it. Stuff like that. Mostly go for bright colors, the type of headband mentioned above, and bell bottom jeans.<br>  <br>  Also, flowy skirts are nice for that sort of style, and sandals and stuff... remember to throw your own spin on the style though... don't just dod what people on here say!

Q7bXrHqPaa	i mean there is a bit of a risk, but i would honestly just keep it clean. make sure you use sea salt spray on it or whatever you're using to keep it clean. <br>  <br>  talk to your gym teacher or something...|`|lU8e0VQFaa	If it's only been a week and a half then it will most likely close up before your class is over, even if it doesn't the constant in and out will damage the piercing and greatly delay healing. Also, since the stud won't be clean every time you do this, you are increasing your chances for infection. Perhaps you should have asked the school before you got it done. Best thing to do is take it out and let it close up, and get it redone during the summer. That way it'll be healed enough by next year to handle being removed once a day.|`|ulYTAfXtaa	you could get a clear retainer to wear. taking it out is definitely gonna be a risk though--it's basically an open wound you're messing with. if you keep it clean enough, you probably won't get an infection, but you gotta make sure you keep it extremely clean. sorry for your situation dear :/|`|timOCfJraa	get a flat invisible stud..that should work...make sure it is flat like a nose ring ..only flat or a clear plastic one ..

Rf9eWfCvaa	Ummmm, yeah it is nice but to formal for prom. You would look better in a brighter color and something a little shorter, but keep the dress for another occasion!!!

Some girls make it look really cute and some should go for a slightly longer. I like it just under the knees. Is that a dress you can try on? Maybe try it on and see how you feel in it, but all the girls I know would never go for a dress that they couldn't try on and be absolutely sure they rocked!

Both clinique and almay are pretty good for your skin, which is good cause I have pretty sensitive skin... Hope this helped.|`|y0rSI36kaa	Use Mineral makeup. and definitely use a gel based sunscreen(at least SPF 30). If u still want a creamy foundation, try Neutrogena liquid foundation with 1% salicyclic acid. It's a good foundation. Keep oil-blotting sheets with you to remove the oil and keep a compact with you during the day to freshen your makeup and get rid of the oil. As for lip gloss/eyeliner, its ur personal preference. For eyeshadow, use Sephora' eyeshadows, they may be a lil expensive but they don't cause breakouts and stay on all day without smudging or creasing. and DO use a makeup remover at the end of the day and make sure to wash ur face at night.|`|iHn1HE3Qaa	look for foundations that use water and not oil. i know maybelline has a foundation with water.<br>  <br>  and use any type of mineral powder. it better for you skin, makes it smoother in my opinion.|`|ZvOXs61caa	HELPPPPP PLEASSEEEEE!

lLC7Cf2zaa	NO JEANS!  What are they thinking!  <br>  <br>  Black pants - can be very costly or just regular nice formal pants in any kind of comfortable style- but not khakis that are black.  Personally, I loved my pair of these boy style 1920's style black pants.  They go well with a white shirt like a white men's collared shirt with buttons like lawyers etc. wear minus the tie.  Simple pearl earrings.  Any color slipper style shoes will do - low flats with a hard bottom are preferable b/c it's easier to use the pedals with these than slippers (ouch!).. with some knee high stockings in a neutral shade.

SKZeKipOaa	If you get your hair cut short you should thin it out so it doesnt look so thick. <br>  With short hair there is pros and cons. It is easy to maintain and you wont get hot . But if you go short you shold try getting it just abit longer not below the top of your shoulders but above it by an inch or 2. <br>  <br>  With long hair you can do alot more like curl it straighen it. I think if you were to keep your hair long you should get it trimmed up and go for a side fringe as well as gettin choppy layers all around so it looks more defined.<br>  <br>  Its hard to tell from your pictures but i can assure you that you look good either way. Its really up to you if you want it long or not.  :)  <br>  <br>  Just remember if you go short thin it out. :)|`|WJpJ6CVpaa	I really like your hair short, but I think you would look so good with some side swept side bangs like these<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.aaa-fashion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/bangs.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.aaa-fashion.com/wp-content/up...</a><br>  <br>  It would look great with either long or short, bangs are the ultimate accessory ;)|`|JAL0HMWiaa	longer no doubt ! <br>  your hair is more healthy that way and you can do more with it plus it makes you face look longer and prettier|`|EB1D1RU1aa	I think you look good in both of them <br>  just go with what your feeling :)<br>  <br>  or you could get it cut to a medium length|`|0SapFgEfaa	I really like it short and a lighter color|`|NTRnf0eraa	i think it looks  better short<br>  and besides short hair is easier to manage =)|`|MnXiiaowaa	Short hair is defiantly  your look! =D<br>  You look very cute both ways though!|`|5hCoZbqcaa	keep it long<br>  it looks wayyyy better|`|NBDQRBvzaa	short|`|gjKqBJwKaa	short !|`|wOedPOPxaa	i think it looks good both ways|`|P3OWfxi5aa	i like it better short :]]|`|Hh1LPTnRaa	long!|`|Ngl0gBv5aa	itd gottin longger can u tell (douh)|`|1nC4fVw3aa	i like your hair shorter, it suits you|`|yhkEyVXLaa	First off, Anna M, how does having long hair make you have healthier hair than when it's short?  Even make it look healthier?  Hair can be healthy at any length as long as you take care of it.<br>  <br>  But I think you should cut your hair back to short.

J86kG2GWaa	i have mine pierced on the top and the bottom. The top didn't hurt that much, the bottom hurt more. But then I had the top redone after a few years, and it hella hurt, but only for bout a week|`|oojO4WAraa	Of course it does.  DUH!!!|`|Au4gWgEiaa	Mine hurt a little as the skin on the top of my bellybutton was tougher than we had anticipated.  So that kind of took me by surprise as the needle going into the bottom was nothing!  I would not say it was very painful though, but i felt it.  A lot of people warned me how it was going to be so sore for a long time and would hurt to sit and everything.  As soon as the jewelry was in I was fine.  By the end of the day it was getting sore, but its 3 weeks later now and it is fine!|`|baf3dee3fe2de84e7d078dca970a375eaa	Yes, it hurts worse than most other piercings.  The girl above who said ears hurt more than belly button is not the norm.  It also hurts for a while after getting it done.  It takes 2 years for a belly button piercing to heal completely.  It is sore for a few mos after getting it done.  My friend who also had her tongue pierced said the tongue was nothing compared to the belly button|`|LFeEoHj3aa	I wouldn't know but make sure you go to a clean place to get it done...you don't want aids. When my sister got it done, she got it done during the summer, so she couldn't swim or do really anything. The only thing she could do was swim in the ocean. It also was really paossy ( you know that yellow stuff that comes out of cuts...I don't know how to spell it haha) a lot...|`|Sm2MzPDuaa	of course its going to hurt, its a needle going into your skin and coming out.<br>  it varrys for each person, my sister said it didnt hurt at all.<br>  I say it's worth the 3 minutes of pain.|`|428a2b704623f75c732936e8e018215daa	Not that bad.  Getting your ears pierced hurts worse.|`|2ibfQbLcaa	Omg, It does not hurt, it feels like a tiny pinch, stubbing your toe or breaking a nail would hurt worse.<br>  <br>  I have a lot of peircings, the lip was the worst, My tongue didnt hurt, nor did my belly and it was my first. Ears hurt worse than my belly, No joke, It doesnt hurt and its like a 2 second thing|`|VHEFyro3aa	well ive had my belly button,tongue,eyebrow,top lip and ears pierced.......id say the eyebrow was the worst but not majorly sore.....belly button not bad atall really so long as u dont fiddle about with it and always keep clean its fine...sometimes sore if u catch on ur trousers but really it depends on how high a pain threshold u have....dont go for cheap rings or studs stick to ones from the piercing studio at least for the first 6 months or so.....hope this helps|`|zVQFyNfwaa	well everyones different, for me the first time it didnt hurt, but the second time it hurt like a bi*** .. but , it depends on how much pain you can take, but it is a needle going up you, but you get the clamp put on you so it numbs it .|`|Rti3mnR5aa	I got mine done yesterday and it really does not hurt that bad.  It feels like someone took the skin and twisted it really hard.  It only hurts for a second and then it is done, though it will remain sore.  Once again it is not that bad.  Hope that helps.|`|urkNRr5Kaa	My ex gf got hers done and I was with her.  I don't think it hurt her as much as the anticipation did.  She freaked out and passed out right afterwards.|`|gjwP0xfeaa	I have never gotten my belly button pierced...but my friend has and she said it hurt like no other!!!
eN5xA6RKaa	yes its normal, i got mine done 3 days ago and its still tender. my piercer told me it stays tender for a bit because its thick cartilage, and thick cartilage piercings stay tender longer than flesh piercings. and as for swelling, thats normal too, mine isnt swollen, but my piercer told me it might swell and if so its normal. <br>  i have a tip if its hard to sleep on it. <br>  flip the ring up towards the top of your tragus and then you can lay on that side without it hurting. in the morning just flip it down and you should be fine.|`|kH0P9P9Naa	My friend got that done a while ago, and it turned out all right after a week or two, so don't freak out. As long as you are keeping it clean, and there are no signs of infection then the inflammation should go down after a while. Also, if it starts to hurt more, put a cold compress on it and that should help.<br>  <br>  And a tragus piercing is NOT in your mouth. The tragus is that little nub of cartilage that lies just in front of the ear canal.|`|WelEvYwGaa	I heard you should be cleaning it three times a day. o.O No matter what kind of piercing when you first have it done.|`|pOufymEJaa	i want mine periced|`|8THz1sp9aa	yes its normal, tragus piercings take from 6-12 months to completely heal. mine took about 7 months. keep cleaning it morning and night and keep those hands off.|`|gZn622dEaa	Well yeah that's a sign of showing that you just got a fresh new piercing.The swelling will go away don't worry.Just take care of it.=D

eXDYvvuxaa	There are different steps of heat protectants.<br>  <br>  1) Shampoos that deposit heat protectant in your hair.<br>  <br>  2) Heat protectant (in spray or cream) that you put in wet hair and blow dry in<br>  <br>  3) Sprays that your put you put on dry hair for straitening.<br>  <br>  4) Smoothing serums, these will generall give back your hair some moisture&shine that it has lost during the straitening process. If you use one of each step your hair will should not be weighed down (exception of No4 these serums can cause weighing down when used alone).<br>  <br>  Example: You could use 1,2,3 and not be weighed down but you could not go 2,2,3,3 ect.<br>  <br>  Its not necesary to use all of these, the one that will protect your hair most will be No2 the others are optional for extra protection&styling. <br>  Personally I wouldnt recomend using tressem'e, because it is mostly fillers (stuff to make the bottle feel nice and heavy) and has very small proportion of auctual heat protectant in it. I've used the tresseme one once and I swear to good it damaged my hair more than if Id not used any at all.<br>   <br>  I have to recomend using brands such as ghd, l'oreal paris, redkin. they may be pricey but are reputable brands and will work well and protect hair.<br>  <br>  Lastly mechanical damage (the friction of the moving hair straitner) can not be prevented by these and may present as the same as heat damage the only solution to this kind of damage is to buy a reputable straighteners such as ghd's, chi's ect.<br>  <br>  Im hoping Ive made sense here.|`|WGFtXo6Paa	I usually use two. First, after I get out of the shower, I put in this shine serum that also protects, and then when i straighten, I spray with a heat protection spray.|`|e6zqKLGHaa	I only use one when i straighten it. I use the john frieda hair serum thermal protection and it doesn't make my all frizzy like other products have.|`|Qb4P6ruEaa	Nah, the more product you use, the more your hair gets weighed down.|`|TLh4S3OZaa	just one. or more will make your hair GREASY!|`|FlZ76mDQaa	nope i just use one someone else might be different though<br>  hope i helped!!!|`|APJZ8e18aa	CHI works AMAZINGLY.<br>  <br>  it takes care of everything.|`|Uo1VAIUAaa	same here just one! i use either the one you said or paul mitchell shine serum that also protects and cuts down blow drying time :]
KyaAdqUpaa	You could get long layers put in, I think it would look nice. If you really want to spice it up a bit get a few highlights.|`|IuVaXq1Daa	I like it how it is, maybe you should gor for feathering in the ends (no highter than your ears) insted of layering?|`|75btdWJkaa	Layers will look great on you. Don't worry. It won't be much shorter when they're finished. I got layers done recently and it was still about the same length.|`|LPCNT8UBaa	Layers suit everyone, so yeah theyd look great on you (:|`|K7Ayf344aa	YESS!! i think you would look great with layers!!! go to the salon right now!!

E7FtXXdnaa	There is no way to get rid of split ends but to cutt them off. And All the curling and straightening has killed your hair. If you dye it a lot that could make it more coarse. Try cutting down on the curling and straightening. Use a hydrating or moisture shampoo and conditioner. I love Bumble and bumble Deep Treatment. You keep it on for like 20 minutes. It's a little pricey but it helped my hair|`|f98brCdxaa	For one use damage control spray or shampoos conditioners. That will help make your hair a little smoother by protecting it from the drying heat. Secondly-go to a hair stlist and get your haitrtrimmed and thnned. That will make it softer too and make it not so coarse. It will also rid you of a lot of split ends. Try not straightening or curlng your hair everyday. give it a break. But i really suggest going to a stylist!|`|TLh4S3OZaa	first, french braids look cute and even cuter when there is two braids.also scrunching your hair when its wet you put moose and gel in it and tht looks cute and how to get rid of spilt ends is by getting a haircut! the hairdresser would know what to do! hav|`|4XaG2h4maa	u should put the front of your hair in a small hump<br>  and if u dont already have bangs u should could cut bangs on ure hair.<br>  u could maybe put moose on ure hair<br>  and sometimes put your hair on a loose braid and ure bangs u should put on a hump.|`|Yhikb42vaa	I  had the same problem with my hair but now im using garnier fruitice sleek and shine and it made my hair so much healthier and softer and it only took like 2 weeks to get my hair that way

51u7IbDfaa	Well one idea of what NOT to do is make yourself fake, as in stuffing. That's the thing you should never do ... Just a tip if you ever come across this thought. Maybe you can try padded bras for an extra little boost? Lol ... But in all seriousness, I really wouldn't worry about being flat chested. Having a full bust isn't everything, I've heard people have back pains because of having a big cup size. Just boost your self confidence by just telling yourself you look great. I mean, even before you overhead him say anything you didn't care. Why care now? Just clear your head and forget him. He's being shallow.|`|e633afd58fd578ab66287bf7228318fcaa	No, you don't need to walk with your arms crossed - nothing really happened to you because he said that, right? ;o)<br>  <br>  If you would have had large breasts and he wanted to say something semi-dumb, he would have probably said you looked like a milk cow or something, and then you would have had to roll up your shoulders to appear to "not that big"...<br>  <br>  He is apparently taking a keen interest in your breasts ;o) <br>  <br>  But no, take inspiration only from those who like you properly and can express it properly! The others don't deserve to influence you ;o) And boys have to learn too - so if it is because he is interested in you, then he must learn how to make you feel good. If he just wanted to make you insecure, he does not deserve to succeed.<br>  <br>  And besides, often small breasts are very, very pretty.

At least when you're like, forty or fifty you won't have boobs all the way down to you knees when gravity does eventually start to take its wicked toll! <br>  <br>  There are beautiful people with all different chest sizes. Many supermodels do not have big breasts and THEY certainly don't have anything to worry about, especially when that worry stems from a weird school boy. It is wrong the way people are so insensitive to the feelings of others! <br>  <br>  As Paris Hilton once said: "If you have a beautiful face, you don't need big boobs."|`|Qb4P6ruEaa	Ooh blah, don't listen to him /:<br>  If you're popular, there's something called a "hater".

AhulHZ2daa	I am a makeup artist, and I work for Mac.<br>  <br>  You may have yellow skin tones, but sometimes on some skins, foundations can oxidize and turn orange. You may have been matched up properly the first time, but when you went to the store with the orange problem, the MA may have re-matched you to NW so if your foundation oxidizes it won't be too orange looking. <br>  <br>  With that said, sometimes new MUA's make mistakes. The lighting is sometimes off in the stores as well.<br>  <br>  I would take your foundation to the store, and POLITELY tell the MUA there that you were mismatched and you would like to exchange your foundation for the proper shade. They may give you store credit only, which is fine if all you're doing is an exchange. If they are hesitant, ask to speak to the manager, and tell him/her about the situation and clearly state that you would like them to "correct" their mistake.<br>  <br>  Make sure the MUA tries out whatever foundation you are exchanging for on you first BEFORE buying. You could even get a sample first of both NW15 and NC15 and try them on in the mirror in different lighting to see if you agree with the change in color.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps! :)|`|QE4fVHOraa	What is the question here? Are you concerned about paying to return? Sometimes you can go into the store and return things you bought online. If not, you can either stay orange or buy a new shade. After all, they should know what they're talking about.|`|Be84u6uaaa	You really need to figure out if your a warm or cool tone. You can google ways of finding that out. That is what the NW and NC are. I use Mac sometimes and I use the NW25 but I find it slight orange as well.|`|HvxKb4gIaa	i think if you see them in person, it would be more helpful. pictures can make your skin look different.|`|AXFrh871aa	Just go to the store/counter, so they can match you up again. Studio fix fluid runs darker than any other foundation they have. So if you are an nw20 in another foundation like select spf 15 (the other liquid foundation they have) you would probably be an nw15 in studio fix fluid. During the summer I am an nw20, but right now during the winter I go down to nw15. The nw20 looks too dark on me during the winter, gives me an orange tint, not too heavy but still a bit darker. You can get advice online or through the phone, but the best you can do is go in person get matched up!|`|uXWvDjWHaa	You should go to MAC store, or a department store that has MAC, and I'm sure they'd let you swap the color. Make sure they do a make-over on you, or at least test the color before you buy.
A0nRQHDCaa	i don't like it either just a bow.|`|4zQEvzCsaa	As someone already said, the corset piercing looks good, but the tat isn't so much. If you can find an artist whose had experience with those kinds of tats then get it done by them. The right artist could make all the difference|`|WLuEIwp5aa	If it's done well, it'll look pretty awesome, though you're right in that it'll hurt.  It's not too bad though, you can get through it.<br>  <br>  I would advise against getting corset piercings.  They're not easy to heal, and you can't wear a ribbon in them until they do heal.  Chances are good that surface piercings on your side are going to reject within a year.  For the most part, corset piercings are considered 'play' piercings, which means they're only worn for anywhere from a few hours to a day or two, usually for things like fetish or tattoo conventions.  The chance of scarring from rejection is really high, and I don't think it's worth the risk, personally.<br>  <br>  I'd stick with the tattoo.|`|DpStw8RBaa	I think corset tattoos are beautiful. Would you be getting it on only one side, or would you get it on both sides? I've seen people get corset piercings (I know different than tattoo, but still the same idea) on both sides and it looks great.|`|gu0AxKyiaa	it looks kool but i wouldnt get it but ima dude so ya if its what you like then you should get it|`|gZn622dEaa	That is a nice tattoo!I think it;ll look nice on you.=D|`|JKKR67M9aa	I would definitely say NO WAY....

If you get real anxious with pain or needles... I would say that it is not a very good idea. But I have plenty of tattoos and so does my family, many of them having heart problems, among oother problems.

But I have not known anyone to have a problem while getting a tattoo...|`|3X8Igzhxaa	the best person to answer your question is your doctor he has your best interest at heart try him first

qOKFuXfLaa	Use a pencil to line your lid and go over it with a liquid liner and use a wand that is not short (I like Maybeline's Ultra Liner) or even a Liquid Liner Pen from MAC. You can also use a gel liner (I like L'oreal HIP Black Gel Liner & MAC Blacktrack Fluidline) and draw the line with your pencil and go over it with a brush and gel. I don't like to use the short wand liquid liners for the same reason as you; it's too thick. I've found that the pencil & gel liner is the best though.|`|GvVSDiwBaa	You can try a gel eyeliner...it has the staying power of a liquid and you can do it a little thinner and even smudge it a little before it dries. MAC makes some really good ones called Fluidline. Blacktrack is their jet black and can be very bold. I like to use Blitz & Glitz which is a black with tiny gold sparkles in it (barely noticeable but leaves it a slight bit softer).<br>  <br>  If you want to try a drugstore brand L'Oreal HiP makes a great cream liner that stays on until you take it off. There are often buy one get one free sales so look out for those.|`|nkaY8Fg1aa	I got a solution for you. Powder Eyeliner. get the bare minerals one. you apply it with a brush and it looks soft and very nice. you can apply it dry, and you can also make it into a liquid eyeliner if you wet the brush a little. it's meant for that. I do it all the time and it looks really nice. accents that eye but doesn't look too dramatic. cuz i had the same problem as you. I'm white so it looks weird with my light skin and green eyes. I think those with darker eyes and skin pull it off better..|`|ezzSeBnLaa	People buy liquid eye liner for the bold and dramatic look. If you don't want it so dark, you can take a damp Q tip and smuge it a little bit.|`|aK7BmcWqaa	I use Maybelline- Waterproof liquid eyeliner. I love it! I dont think its really dark and dramatic..
SOOybYMIaa	i have the same problem. i have wide shoulders too. the one from gap has large triangles (thingies). that makes your shoulders look even wider. it hink the bandeau would look cute as long as it's is not strap less. so the delia's one is cute. i'd go for a halter like:<br>  <a href="http://www.ae.com/web/browse/outfit_bundle_page_hero.jsp?o=sku1670023&catId=cat90032" rel="nofollow">http://www.ae.com/web/browse/outfit_bund...</a><br>  <br>  or this. something that takes up some of the space on your shoulders:<br>  <a href="http://store.delias.com/item.do?itemID=48836&categoryID=2083&sizeFilter=&colorFilter=&brandFilter=" rel="nofollow">http://store.delias.com/item.do?itemID=4...</a><br>  <br>  see how this model has wide shoulders? the swim suit is strapless:<br>  <a href="http://www.ae.com/web/browse/outfit_bundle_page_hero.jsp?o=sku1610006&catId=cat90032" rel="nofollow">http://www.ae.com/web/browse/outfit_bund...</a>|`|APJZ8e18aa	a bandeau will make you look flat chested.<br>  <br>  try a string.|`|3LC6MiBOaa	i think you should go with the bandeau or the delias one|`|TLh4S3OZaa	go with the aerie one!|`|oELW89mCaa	The arie 1. Personally I would have board shorts and a form fitting swim shirt. Over a suit. (I find bikinis too hard to swim in.)|`|skYpUv2Maa	i like the aerie 1. bandeus are good if you dont need lots of support but i warn you. i was a 34A and i got 1 last year now im a 34C and it still fits but its hard to even jump in the pool...
a29qiNkvaa	It is an awesome business! For me the products sell them self. I love it and have fun selling. Now is a great time to start, with all the new amazing product that are coming out.|`|lU8e0VQFaa	I've heard of it yes and I've heard that their products are good. But now is probably not the best time to start a home business like that since with the economy going the way it is most people are cutting back on the little luxuries.|`|13q7LpWLaa	Arbonne, as with any other business venture, is really what you make of it. Your results are based on how much effort you put into it. It's definitely not business where you can just sit back and make easy money! You WILL need to sell the products and build your business in order to be successful at it. <br>  <br>  That being said, the positives are that you get the products at 35% or more discount and the products themselves are EXCELLENT!!! I don't  say this because I use and love them myself but I've received nothing but positive feedback from my clients.<br>  <br>  So continue doing your research and really think about whether you have the motivation and belief in the products/company to really sell others on it and build a successful business. Good luck and feel free to email me (ArbonneObsession@myarbonne.com) if you have any other questions!|`|S008duBZaa	It's a decent home busines, good products, etc. but to make a decent return you have to sell, sell, sell and moreimportanty recruit others into the business. While I will stop short of saying its a pyramid schedmed business, it looks like every other home base business that pushes you to recruit other people to sell the products. <br>  <br>  I bet now that you are looking in to Arbonne, you'll startt seeing cars with the Arbonne adds plastered on the back windshields! Keep an eye out for them!  They are all over the place! (At least they are here in SoCal).|`|D2YJSIXHaa	It is an amazing business.  What I love about it is that you get to decide how much money you make.  It all depends on numbers.  The more people you tell about these amazing products, the better you are going to do.  I'm not sure what you're looking for in a home based business, but in my opinion, you can't go wrong with Arbonne.  It has changed mine and my families life.  I would be happy to send you more information or you can check out my website at www.successfulhealth.myarbonne.com  to learn more.  Please don't shut out this thought until you have been given all the information.  You can't go wrong.  Now is the perfect time to build a home based business because of the economy.  People are being laid off of their jobs left and right.  You have the opportunity to help give financial freedom to people that truly need it.  Looking forward to talking with you more.  Good Luck on your decision.|`|2HPa1ETUaa	Yes I've heard of it, but only from my good friend. Her and her mom order from arbonne a lot.<br>  I'm not sure if it's good or bad to get into, but I've heard of it. And seems like thay have good stuff.|`|KUcZC14Xaa	Well that is a good question. I am a part of one of the fastest growing teams in Arbonne's 29 year history. We know how to do and most importantly how to show you! Excellent support system here. The first step is getting all the correct information with supporting facts not chatter, so that way you can make an educated decision for yourself!! You can do this...Feel free to contact me anytime. segamiklis@aol.com

I would try to make it stop but it would get worse, so i hopped on answers.yahoo and found out that i wasn't alone.  there is one girl in my college class who has the same problem and i think man i feel your pain...it sucks.  in high school i really didnt care about what people thought of me or whatever but when college started it would happen...i think over time i became more conscious of myself as well as situations and my surroundings which is why it happens. i read one answer to this before, and it said that people it happens to tend to be more confident and conscious than others, which i am a lot of both until i feel overwhelmed by a situation.  I think we just have to learn to live with it.  It will eat us inside out if we don't so i try not to think about it as much as i use to...like presentations in college and stuff.  I felt alone b.c. hardly nobody i know does it so i thought i had emotional or mental problem which made it worse.  now i know there are millions of people like me which makes me feel better about myself.  in high school when someone's face turned red i would think "why is ur face red? your blushing"  now i know why...you cant control it and its difficult to explain the feeling.  all the eyes pierce through you and you stand there with a face of stone like you saw a ghost and your face looks like a tomato.  i go to a community college, so all my friends are gone far away or i hardly see them b.c. of our schedules so i really dont do anything until winter break or when spring/summer comes...it could have been the new college situation and the withdrawl of friends and the withdrawl of exposure to the public...like walking down the hall and seeing people i know and talk to.  i use to have a timid attitude about it...like dang it happening...run away or suffer the pain, now i just think to myself "hey, its the way i am, all of you can kiss my @$$".  i know it will go away.  im in my 4th semester at college, its been going on since my 1st semester.  i know it will stop, its just a matter of when.  now when a presentation is due i try not think about it negatively like "oh no, not a presentation" i think of it like, "ok im going to make the sweetest powerpoint in this class".|`|AA11901859	It won't help a whole lot, but wearing bronzer on your cheeks will cover up some of the lighter blushes.  Also a tan will help mask it|`|v4xIauuYaa	Try not to worry to much and think too much. Think confident feel confident, the more you worry about blushing the more you will blush.<br>  Eating cucumbers help with blushing or try bluff dust from Benefit cosmetics.

BVtnCy1vaa	Don't worry about getting fat, fat is an important part of your diet so don't completely cut it out! The way you're getting calories is important, try to get more protein than carbs and more vegies than meat. Carbohydrates and fats are good for breakfast or lunch as when you burn them as energy they completely disappear from your system, however if you have carbs for dinner then you might gain weight. Fats/sugars after dinner as in pudding are ok though as they help you digest your food, especially if you have a mixed vegie/meat dinner.<br>  <br>  Don't go to the gym too often, I know Barak Obama goes six times a week but he's superman. Be sure to take rest days as if you just work work work your muscle won't have time to build up properly.<br>  <br>  Don't eat when you're not hungry but do when you are and keep an eye on that. Sometimes after doing exercise you might not feel hungry straight away but always have a protein bar or something on you. Your previous low number of calories has probably resulted in your stomach being slightly smaller so try to gain those calories from small amounts of foods. I saw a study where a high-fat low-carb diet was much better than a low-fat low-carb diet but you need to make sure those are the right fats - the kind you get from olive oil rather than the kind you get from processed foods.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!
qhKP68eiaa	Nail polish is changable, so therefore you can go with the seasons...and you should go with the different seasons.  It doesn't matter what your skin tone or other colors are when you're just painting your nails.  Be crative and have fun with different colors!|`|Hzigkdtkaa	If your skin has more olive undertones and is a bit darker, you’ll probably look fantastic in shades of russet and gold.

x7duxnBLaa	I had very dry skin and nothing was working until I tried CeraVe moisturizing lotion.  This is the only thing that worked and I tried alot of lotions.  This was recommended to my husband by a dermatologist.  I was very surprised in less than a week.  Hope you like it too.|`|fmdoGQizaa	Drinking water is a huge help =) Not only does it moisturise your skin, but gives you more energy and prevents diseases including cancers. You should be drinking litres of water (just plain water, not mixed with anything) a day. Try to carry a bottle of water around with you and keep sipping it. If your brain becomes 2% dehydrated, you lose 20% concentration.<br>  <br>  Also, try E45, apply it every day. But definitely try the water, don't give up too quickly, it might take a while, but you can be positive that it's super healthy!|`|qlmcVAIpaa	I was told once that when you're selecting things like lotions, to read the ingrediants, and if the first thing in it is water, then it is better for your skin. I've done that, and all the lotions i've bought have worked pretty well. Or, you could try body butter, it's really good for your skin, its thicker than lotion, and less greasy, too. Plus, it isn't that much more than lotion price-wise.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and I hope it helped.|`|M9bcvuLaaa	Always drink plenty of water, that will keep skin hydrated...<br>  When you cleanse your face start off by using warm water to the skin then when you rinse use cool water..I would continue to use the ponds and use vitamin e oil at night on the dry patches..Their is a Hydrating Mask you can get at Sally's..Vita-C Hydrating Mask..I use it and love it!  And it's not expensive..<br>  Good Luck!

9y7xSEinaa	What kind of sunscreen are you using? My hands-down holy grail sunscreen is Shiseido's.. it's so matte and un-shiny that I need to use a scrub to take it off! It's really excellent and Shiseido is known for their sunscreens (pale skin being so popular in Asia). It's SPF 55. <br>  I would try using a shine absorber, perhaps a mattifying lotion (Shiseido makes one, so does L'oréal) or oil-blotting papers (they sell expensive ones at makeup counters, but frankly, rice paper from an Asian market or non-bleached napkins like those at Starbucks work justa s well!). <br>  You should also check out a foundation or tinted moisturizer that has a high SPF. Clinique City Block comes in SPF 30 I believe; since you mention you're not a big foundation person, this would be great for you because it's light, airy, and provides a hint of color. Also is good for pale skins. You won't feel like you're wearing much, trust me! <br>  Hope this helps!

q1NGyaBraa	if its a dark coulour like black or dark brown dye it will fade heaps quicker than natural hair, but if u have naturally blonde hair it lightens up really fast aswell. Yeah it will lightne the same doent really matter when uve done it. You can buy shampoos and products that have uv protection to stop the colour from fading as much as well.|`|p2605ETpaa	It doesn't lighten it the die fades, if you keep dying it soon enough it will get darker and then go really dark, and i think the sun lightens natural hair faster depending on how light or dark your hair is :)|`|pbPe614Raa	no,your natural hair lightens real fast.colored hair rarely lightens
Khwt4oL6aa	1. Shampoo and condition your hair. When finishing, do your last rinse with cold water.<br>     2. Squeeze the excess water out. Towel/air dry for 10-15 minutes. Divide hair into 3-4 sections. To scrunch it, scrunch your hair from the ends going upward to your roots (like scrunching a piece of paper), once you're at the root, secure with a hair clip/claw. You want it damp but not soaking wet or dripping.<br>     3. Wrap your hair in a small towel (for thin hair leave on a few minutes, for thick hair up to 20 minutes). Do not rub your hair at all with a towel (this will cause frizziness). What you can do is scrunch it gently within the towel if the ends are still dripping.<br>     4. Run your fingers like a wide-tooth comb through your hair and make a part as best as you can. Don't worry if it's not perfect!<br>     5. Use hairspray. Put it near the middle and bottom of your hair. Putting it too close to your roots will cause it to look greasy and weighed down.<br>     6. Turn your head upside down so that your hair is hanging down. This step is optional and some prefer to skip it. Helps give volume and a more even scrunch.<br>     7. Put gel /mousse in your hands and rub them together to spread the gel/mousse.<br>     8. Grab a small handful of hair by the ends and push it up toward the head. Hold it in place for a few moments while aiming the hair dryer at it to 'set' the gel/mousse/hair spray.<br>     9. Repeat this all over your head, reapplying the gel every time. Keep in mind that small handfuls yield tighter waves and large handfuls create full, loose waves.<br>    10. Leave hair alone while air-drying if you opt to not blow-dry with a diffuser. If you mess with it too much it will cause frizz.<br>    11. Do not rush the steps or rush to dry it. Letting it dry by itself is a way to leave it with a wet look.<br>    12. Spray an even amount of spray wax at the middle and ends of your hair for more texture (Pantene Texturize! is great).<br>  <br>  Then your hair should be greatly scrunched!!!|`|cFc8KPIQaa	heres a way if you take you hair and Just put it into a tight bun right when u get outta of the shower when it is soaking wet.. then give it about 20 to 30 min then take it out and don't brush it don't brush it before u put it up either then take it out and put gel and hair spray and moose or what ever you use and that works to.. a little secret i know|`|O5LItEFRaa	look on youtube for videos, they have tons of different techniques! a good scrunching gel is pantene scrunching gel... and a good spray is sunsilk waves of envy or sunsilk captivating curls mousse. i cant really describe how to scrunch hair, the people on youtube do it much better because you can watch lol. and don't worry, it's not stupid, i'm still really bad at scrunching my hair! gooood luck|`|Sm2MzPDuaa	get your hair wet, towel dry it.<br>  (if you do it when its drenched, it wont work)<br>  get gel && hairspray.<br>  get a hand full of gel, bend over<br>  and continuesly scrunch your hair by grabbing your hair and fisting it up.<br>  after your hair is fulled gelled, hairspray it all.<br>  <br>  <br>  ( i have straight hair, it works)|`|ezzSeBnLaa	Aussie makes a sprunch spray that works wonders. Spray it on when your hair is damp and blow dry it upside down while "sprunching"|`|PMLgXlrgaa	I personally would try using moose. Then put it up in a bun and leave it there for a while. Then when you take it down and scrunch it the way you want use a lot of hairspray to keep it in.<br>  I don't know if this will work and I hope it helps, but honestly some hair (like mine) can be very stubborn and won't always work the way you want it to, especially with a style like this.|`|BjdUS3i8aa	take a shower<br>  when your hair is wet Flip it up side down then up again<br>  keep doing this until you see waves or curls <br>  add gel add it with your hair upside down then go up and but on some more by grabbing and squeezing.|`|zWX5GDehaa	i use the tressemae moose and it works pretty good, all u gotta do is when u get outta the shower, put the moose on it and scrunch it|`|HMhUKAgkaa	If you have pin straight hair, it probably wont work with your hair type.
qAIRY6AOaa	It will take the shape of the braid (so waves basically).

1vaqtRI2aa	The trick is your eyelashes and shimmery eyeshadow. Try following these steps...<br>  <br>  1) Apply an eyeshadow base (to make sure your eyeshadow stays put)<br>  <br>  2)Apply a shimmery, light colored eyeshadow on your lids. The shimmer and light color will make your eyes pop and widen them.<br>  <br>  3)Apply a dark shadow to your creases (like a black, dark brown or grey) to add depth to your eyes.<br>  <br>  4) Add a shimmery white to the inner cornes of your eyes. <br>  <br>  5Line your eyes only half-way. And don't make the lines too big or too thin. Lining them all the way will make your eyes look tiny and buggy.<br>  <br>  6)Curl those lashes!! Long lashes make the eyes look bigger and wider.<br>  <br>  7)Add a mascara. I love MACs PlushLash, CoverGirls LashBlast and Max Factors 2000 Calorie Mascara.<br>  <br>  8) This is optional, but you can add lashes for a more dramatic look.<br>  <br>  9) Highlight your browbown by putting a light shimmery (white or champagne preferably) along it. Make sure you don't go over your brows.<br>  <br>  10)Add foundation, blush and a light to medium color on your gloss.<br>  <br>  And you're done! I do this all the time and it makes my eyes look HUGE! I understand cause I'm not pale either, I'm Puerto Rican and olive skinned. The white eyeliner trick usually looks kind of weird on us.<br>  <br>  Anymore questions and you can add me on Yahoo! I/M or e-mail me (:|`|WJpJ6CVpaa	Maybe not the white eyeliner trick, on their tear ducts right?<br>  <br>  Why don't you get a gold eyeshadow kit, you can make your eyes bright and it will go with your skin tone :)|`|JLNX5nnwaa	if you are dark skinned it is best NOT to use white eyeliner. you can use black eyeliner you just have to put it on the outside of the eye.
2oN7WrVKaa	Dont wear makeup.<br>  It doesnt matter if you put on suntan lotion.<br>  Youre covering your face with it.<br>  Just go natural!<br>  I know you dont want to, but youll regret it when your face is paler then your body.<br>  Try tanning in your backyard so nobody sees?|`|rUhf56dwaa	I wouldn't advise wearing make up while sun bathing hun. It can block up your pores. Why don't you try a tinted foundation with SPF in it? Then you get the best of both worlds, coverage while being protected from the sun but without wearing layers of make up so you can tan? Benefits 'You Rebel' is expensive but well worth the investment!|`|Lk0CN64Daa	You cannot tan at all with foundation. Just go get a tan with a couple of girlie's take the make up off when u get there slap on a bit factor 15-20 sun tan lotion mainly focusing on underneath the eyes, chin, nose and forehead..ha ha so everywhere really. So take make up off when u go then moisturise your skin then allow to dry then slap on all the make up you want and you wont need to bother with sun tan lotion if you have foundation on as long as you don't sweat it off. Or go in your back garden or somebody else's back garden if your conscious. <br>  <br>  Good luck Babe, my skin is patchy, but with a sun tan youll just glow <br>  xx|`|8pl3ShtBaa	although your makeup has spf in it it will not prevent you from getting all color. peoples skin on their face is naturally lighter because it is the most protected part of all peoples bodies. Makeup is never as effective as it says so go ahead and keep wearing it. Covergirl makes a product to add a lightened glow to just cheek bones and the top of your nose...it is great!|`|yPvqLD6zaa	are you sara conner?|`|Rz9kzGBSaa	no|`|puu0aAHHaa	It dnt rlly matter if you do, Just like wear SPF 30 thoughh!

1Xeu8R7paa	Always fake it! Sun tanning and tanning beds are not worth getting skin cancer or premature wrinkles over! I would suggest getting a spray tan at a salon but if that is too pricey, use a self tanner. I love Bath and Body Works True Blue Spa Glow and Steady daily moisturizer and gradual self-tanner with SPF 15 for body. It is non-greasy, doesn't use those fake-looking clothes staining dyes, looks completely natural, AND has SPF. It is only carried seasonally though. I always stock up for the rest of the year.<br>  Here is the link to buy it online: <a href="http://www.bathandbodyworks.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2618349&cp=2484528.3214847&parentPage=family" rel="nofollow">http://www.bathandbodyworks.com/product/...</a>|`|Ge167Hptaa	Go to a beach and put on a light coat of 15 spf sunscreen and lay on your stomach for 30 min. then flip over for 30 min. during the middle of the day to get an even, smooth tan.

mT5srUKHaa	here are the instructions<br>  <br>  How to French Braid Your Own Hair<br>  Step1Take a 3-inch-long by 1-inch-wide section of your hair just above the forehead or behind your bangs. Divide the section into three even pieces which will start off your French braid. <br>  Step2Wrap your left thumb around the left section, palm facing front, fingers sticking straight up. Mimic the same posture on the right side, and let the middle section lie against the head. <br>  Step3Make a soft fist around the left section of hair, turning your hand so that your fingers rest on the head. Bring the section of hair in your right hand across the middle section and hook it with your left index finger. <br>  Step4Lead with the right thumb and cut about a 1-inch section of hair straight across the head, starting at the hairline and moving toward the middle section. Collect the middle section and pull all of the hair tight. The line of hair you collected in each section of your French braid should lie flat and smooth. <br>  Step5Make a soft fist with the right hand, fingers facing your scalp. Reach the right index finger over the middle section and hook the section of hair that's in your left fist. Pull it out gently, keeping a firm grip on the French braid sections in your right hand. <br>  Step6Let the section in your left hand dangle. Lead with the left thumb and cut about a 1-inch section of hair straight across the head, collect the middle section, then pull all of the hair tight. Turn the fist so that your fingers face your scalp. <br>  Step7Extend your left index finger to hook the section of hair that's in your right fist. Continue until the French braid is complete. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  here is the video<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/video_17115_french-braid-hair.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/video_17115_french-b...</a>|`|TLh4S3OZaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6M7WzzYPWI" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6M7WzzYP...</a><br>  <br>  here! have fun and i think you will learn quickly!<br>  <br>  have a nice day!<br>  -jonaslover|`|ajPwbJTuaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6M7WzzYPWI" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6M7WzzYP...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  enjoy|`|Ds5uDb7laa	here:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6M7WzzYPWI" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6M7WzzYP...</a>|`|fMPyLqW4aa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6M7WzzYPWI" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6M7WzzYP...</a>|`|OvsgyxxDaa	hey i've learned from this video it gave me some really good details! :)<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6M7WzzYPWI" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6M7WzzYP...</a><br>  if you search more there's a lot more videos.<br>  <br>  it's pretty easy once you get it. <br>  if you are doing 2 it's the same just split.<br>  and if your doing it by yourself your gonna be doing an inside out braid (same thing just inside out) <br>  i suggest practicing on someone else!! <br>  :)<br>  <br>  oops didn't know the link was already posted hahaha

lU8e0VQFaa	Unless you're in pain, most likely you don't have an infection. They're also most likely closed up by now since you didn't have them pierced for very long. I wouldn't try putting them back in when you get home, just let it close up and heal and try again over the summer when schools out, that way they'll be healed enough that you can wear a flesh colored retainer at school so they can't notice.|`|afAbSq5gaa	Clean it out really good with alcohol or saline solution, if you think that it is infected dont put them back in and clean it out with one of the above solutions several times a day, if it gets worse go to the doctors.<br>  If you think its not infecter, you can prob still stick the earrings back in, it might hurt a bit but hey if i can pierce my own ears you can handle it then again keep cleaning it until its healed.

They both remove everything, don't burn (unless you pour it in your eye), etc. I use a long-lasting makeup, and it still comes off perfectly. I use Estee Lauder mascara, nothing waterproof (it's too stiff-feeling for me) and it washes off easy.|`|vvB0Etysaa	Hi:<br>  <br>  You can buy any eye makeup remover (without oil).  You can pick up any brand from drugstores, Zellers, Walmart.  I like Clinique, it is expensive but it has no oily film.

Eye makeup is completly different.|`|AA12205301	vaseline is the best. You just put it on then use a warm cloth to clean it off, and yes it gets rid of mascara.

lU8e0VQFaa	Only certain antibiotics clear up acne, and you need to be on them for months to see any results. Washing your face all the time will not only irritate it but over dry it as well causing it to become more oily and more likely to break out. Only wash your face twice a day with a gentle cleanser. Stress and hormones also play a large role in acne problems, so there's a good chance that it's not you doing something wrong. If you've tried a bunch of different over the counter remedies then it's probably time to hit up a dermatologist.|`|tao83sDxaa	its not you it's your age, you have over active hormones. my face was a mess, but i am also bipolar. the fact that we had to bring me into line cleared up my face. i doubt if the antibiotics will work. it sounds like you are doing everything right, you are just going to have to ride it out. as you get older you will see it will start to lessen. you are going to keep getting the breakouts until they quit. the only thing you can do is try to keep on doing what you are doing. you will get break outs when you least want then and the only thing you vcan do is deal with it. i know it isn't fair some kids have this beautiful skin, what happens is that you end up having a wonderful personality.|`|7FIe6xBAaa	sometimes it just doesn't matter how good you are to your skin.<br>  i never wear a lot of face make-up<br>  i wash my face 2 times a day, scrub about 3 times a week.<br>  drink plenty of water.<br>  do all the right stuff, and yet i still managed to get acne that lasted about a year.<br>  <br>  your just have to go to the doctor and ask for stuff especially for acne.<br>  mines has cleared up now but i still have awful scarring.<br>  just because you take good care of it doesn't mean it's going to be perfect for you. unfortunately that was the case with me.<br>  go and get acne treatments before it gets worse and you scar like me, trust me, it's better to do it in the long run. even if it's not full blown acne.|`|QrJme3hdaa	Using Mary Kay's Acne gel, 3-n-1 cleanser and toner will help you a great deal.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.marykay.com/nalli" rel="nofollow">http://www.marykay.com/nalli</a>|`|fsHgUrcAaa	If you're washing your face "all the time" you should cut back to twice a day:  once in the morning and once at night...and stop scrubbing it until it clears up.
mT5srUKHaa	1. Wash your hair as normal then towel dry, leaving it slightly damp.<br>  2. Lightly spray your hair with sea-salt spray and comb through hair.<br>  3. Divide your hair into four sections by first halving the hair in the middle, then again on each half.<br>  4. Plait each of the four sections. It doesn't have to be be perfect. Slightly messy plaits will make the waves look more natural.<br>  5. Wait until your hair is completely dry then undo the plaits and gently separate the waves with your fingers.<br>  6. Spray lightly with a serum and lightly tousle.<br>  7. Hair will take longer to dry when in plaits, so it may take from 1-2 hours to 8-9, depending on the thickness and texture of hair.<br>  8.

qOKFuXfLaa	go to a local makeup counter and ask for "sample jars" they are jars that you can put makeup on. Then, when you get home, you can melt the lipsticks and place it on the sample jar (using a small container and a stove). EnrokeMakeup from youtube has a video on how to safely melt lipsticks into a jar. It works good too! It ends up looking like your lipstick came in a jar instead of the stick tube. I did it once to one of my MAC Hello Kitty Lipstick that broke off. And you actually get more lipstick than what the original packaging comes with because you can remove the product thats inside the stick tube...|`|AA12370001	why bother.  just buy a new one.|`|B29boGPcaa	Remove the broken piece with a tissue, then wave a lit match beneath it (making sure the tissue doesn't catch the flame). Once the lipstick softens, put it back on the base, swivel the tube down and pop it in the fridge for 5 minutes. The chill will set the mold so you don't have to buy a new one :) xxx|`|qeIwDGF0aa	You can't reattach a broken lipstick but you can still use it. Put it back in the container and use a lip brush to apply it.|`|t0WFfhRfaa	just shove it back down there|`|34UHfffxaa	very simple just go to the shopkeeper along with the lipstick show it to him and tell him to give a new one|`|kS7sL6Puaa	First, using the cuticle pusher or your filer, scrap out the lipstick from the lipstick container, which maybe the cap with the smashed lipstick or the base with the last bit of your lipstick. Put this in a small microwave safe container. If you have any broken lipsticks, you know when the stick just breaks out, add those to the container too.<br>  Since we are re-using stuff, I would suggest using an old contact lens case or a pill case as your lipstick palette. But if you prefer to have a proper container, you could buy a lipstick palette or even better; get a lip gloss container, the small glass ones. You could ask the person at any beauty counter for their sample container, they'll give them out for free!!<br>  Once you have the lipstick in the container, put it in the microwave for a few seconds. Depending on the quantity of the lipstick, the time will vary. For an entire lipstick, do 30 seconds first. Check if the lipstick has melted completely. If not, microwave another 15-20 seconds. Remember, never let the lipstick boil to a liquid, microwave it just until it melts. Over heating will separate its oxides and the glitter that the lipstick contains, you don't want that! Once melted, pour out your lipstick into the palette you have chosen. Let it cool, either in a fridge or just at room temperature, until its firm again. The new lipstick can be applied with a lip brush or your finger.<br>  <br>  The website below has some more ideas and a video on how to actually do the entire procedure.|`|TfL5pFBOaa	<a href="http://www.beyondjane.com/Beauty/Makeup/Reusing-Broken-Lipsticks-to-Make-New-Ones.251807" rel="nofollow">http://www.beyondjane.com/Beauty/Makeup/...</a><br>  *here is a good website on how to melt lipsticks to make new ones i have tried this and it works pretty good!<br>  <br>  good luck!

I just experienced my first year of college and looking back at all the drama and crazy shiz I experienced during high school and all the fights and broken friendships it all really doesn't matter that much. Most of the people that I thought were my best friends in high school haven't bothered to try and hang out with me at all since we graduated, and I noticed that I really don't care.<br>  <br>  It doesn't matter after high school if you were popular or a geek, so just try to make the best of it and don't let stupid name brand oriented air heads make you upset.<br>  <br>  Just because you're asking this question you're already so much better than they are.<br>  <br>  But the final answer is<br>  NO name brands don't really matter at all!<br>  <br>  What matters is YOU and you're personality!|`|ny7kXHHraa	Once you are out of school no one will give a sh!t... they're just mindless, fashionless blobs and maybe once they have to support themselves they'll grow up.|`|eDJSrvbgaa	Thats no even the case with everyone...who cares what brand you wear?

GItWq2mGaa	Maya Angelou, the African-American poet who is one of the most influential and respected literary voices of the modern age, has written a poem praising Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign for The Observer.<br>  <br>  Angelou, author of an autobiographical series of books, including the international bestseller I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, was moved to send the verse after being asked by the newspaper for her reflections on Clinton.<br>  <br>  She is supporting Clinton despite her close friendship with television personality and philanthropist Oprah Winfrey, a prominent backer of rival Democrat Barack Obama, the first black presidential hopeful with a real chance of reaching the White House.<br>  <br>  Angelou is steadfast in her loyalty to Clinton. She said recently: 'I made up my mind 15 years ago that if she ever ran for office I'd be on her wagon. My only difficulty with Senator Obama is that I believe in going out with who I went in with.'<br>  <br>  The 79-year-old poet was the centrepiece of Bill Clinton's inauguration in 1993 when she read her poem On the Pulse of Morning, playing on the idea of a new political dawn. Last week she handed this new poem over to the Clinton campaign.<br>  <br>  Angelou says that she has had many long telephone conversations with Winfrey on the subject of Obama versus Clinton. 'She thinks he's the best, and I think my woman is the best,' she has explained. 'Oprah is a daughter to me, but she is not my clone.'<br>  <br>  Angelou was recently voted one of the 10 most admired women in America, in a poll topped by Hillary Clinton. The very public marital problems suffered by the Clintons during their time at the White House seem to have reinforced Angelou's admiration for Hillary.<br>  <br>  'When he had his brush with Ms Lewinsky, the whole world was looking under Mrs Clinton's bedclothes. Many people expected her to fall or to become as hard as a rock,' she has said. 'She did neither. I love that about her. She didn't pretend she wasn't hurt and she didn't become a virago.'<br>  <br>  Andrew Motion, the Poet Laureate, said of the poem: 'This is a great thing for The Observer to have.' He favourably compared it with the 'vivid flourishes' of Angelou's recent work. 'With this kind of poem Angelou has decided to interpret public writing as a verbal equivalent of making a poster, and there's nothing wrong with this. The rhetoric is full of big gestures that make a direct appeal to our feelings, rather than getting to it by the little winding ways more personal poetry might use.'<br>  <br>  Motion said the lines raise questions about whether 'poster-style' poems can live long beyond the moment. 'Maybe Angelou doesn't mean them to. On their own terms they have the vivacity and strength and colours you would expect of posters. But they have a sort of best-before date, or rather a best-on date, stamped on them.'<br>  <br>  It is not known how long Angelou spent writing the poem, but in the weeks leading up to President Bill Clinton's first inauguration she is said to have begun work at 5.30 every morning, equipped with a glass of sherry, a dictionary, Roget's Thesaurus and the Bible.<br>  <br>  Angelou was born Marguerite Johnson in 1928 in St Louis, Missouri, and lived with her mother until she was raped by her mother's boyfriend. In England she became famous in the early Seventies with the first of her volumes of autobiography.<br>  <br>  During her extraordinary life she has worked as a prostitute, a professor, a Creole cook, an aide to Martin Luther King, a singer, an actress, a dancer, the editor of an Egyptian newspaper and a single mother, as well as producing poetry and plays.<br>  <br>  In recent years she has controversially even written lines to be printed inside greetings cards. 'Life is a glorious banquet, a limitless and delicious buffet,' reads one of her Hallmark epigrams.<br>  <br>  She has defended this commercial decision against literary snobbery: 'If I'm America's poet, or one of them, I want to be in people's hands. All people's hands, people who would never buy a book.'<br>  <br>  It remains to be seen if she will find herself once again rising at dawn to compose new stanzas to mark a third Clinton inauguration.<br>  <br>  State Package for Hillary Clinton<br>  <br>  You may write me down in history<br>  <br>  With your bitter, twisted lies,<br>  <br>  You may tread me in the very dirt<br>  <br>  But still, like dust, I'll rise.<br>  <br>  This is not the first time you have seen Hillary Clinton seemingly at her wits' end, but she has always risen, always risen, don't forget she has always risen, much to the dismay of her adversaries and the delight of her friends.<br>  <br>  Hillary Clinton will not give up on you and all she asks of you is that you do not give up on her.<br>  <br>  There is a world of difference between being a woman and being an old female. If you're born a girl, grow up, and live long enough, you can become an old female. But to become a woman is a serious matter. A woman takes responsibility for the time she takes up and the space she occupies. Hillary Clinton is a woman. She has been there and done that and|`|1vaqtRI2aa	She would want you to stop asking people on Yahoo!

Tanning spray booths are much safer and I can't speak for all of them but I tried one called VersaSpa and it was not streaky and it is not patchy on elbows or knees.  I used to use the self tanning lotions but I will not go back to them again because I experience the same streakiness and patchiness you did.|`|HRRfZDQqaa	dont use sunblock.. you WONT get the tan. trust me. lol ive tried. im really white.<br>  <br>  try a sunscreen with a low spf of about maybe 15? if you burn easily, get higher.|`|7vfpYy9maa	i am the same and i'm a fake tan freak!

Its easy to do...make sure you blend it into your wrists and ankles.<br>  Dont bake yourself...and if you do always use 15 plus otherwise you will just burn and peel!!<br>  Good luck!!
j2CbOyEuaa	I have the same problem to, I am just to pale and I rarely got burnt unless its on the shoudlers and I have the hardest time tanning. If you havnt before, try using a tanning bed. See if that works but only try it once, if it doesnt work, I'm not sure what will work. Good luck
dB2fqrCgaa	Ty for putting the racism aside, I'm asian xD<br>  <br>  You could try wetting your hair a bit [not dripping wet] and braid your hair into pigtails [two braids] and sleep with it/wait until it's completely dry and let out the braids.

Oh, and what I do when i had long hair, was after a shower, i'd put my hair up in a really tight bun, then when i took it out in the morning, it would still be slightly wet and very curly, so i'd put a bit of mouse in to keep it stay, and straighten the ends so it falls down a bit nicer. <br>  <br>  hope this helps!

6npsRIzUaa	I hate to say it but chances are yes it will close. Most nose piercings are pierced at 18g, so you could put a regular earring in (a stud, one of those butterfly back ones, just don't put the backing on and if you do don't put it on very tight, they're usually about 20g(20 is smaller than 18)-18g, and will keep your hole open until you can replace the stud.

It's legal to tattoo minors in Missouri if the parent is present to give written consent, but I doubt you'll find an artist who will tattoo anyone 15 years old.  Most shops require you to be at least 16, and many shops will not tattoo minors regardless of the laws in that state.<br>  <br>  I would suggest calling around.  If you can't find a really good shop that will tattoo you (this is going to be difficult, I think), just wait.  Don't sacrifice quality just to get a tattoo now.  It's going to be on your body forever, so if you have to wait to go to a really good shop, trust me, that wait is worth it.|`|kjGtzQgMaa	You can not get a tattoo anywhere in the United States (legally, that is) if you are under the age of 16.

i38Ev1Zaaa	it depends on what type of dress you have.<br>  <br>  Do you have a dress with an intricate backing? if you do, go for an all updo, with a few pieces of hair framing your face. This will give you the elegance of the hair, without covering the elequent backing of the dress that makes it special. You can go with both a messy updo, or you can go for the more slick looking updo:<br>  <a href="http://www.women-hairstyles.com/images/formal-hairstyle.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.women-hairstyles.com/images/f...</a><br>  <a href="http://media.photobucket.com/image/updo/Margaritapr/formal_wedding_updos_hairstyle-2.jpg?o=6" rel="nofollow">http://media.photobucket.com/image/updo/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.lynnechapman.com/images/styles014.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.lynnechapman.com/images/style...</a><br>  <br>  If your dress has a plain backing, and is strapless or halter, you should definately go for a half updo. The style really varies on your dress, do you want people to focus more on your dress, or your hair/makeup/accessories/shoes? If you want them to focus more on the dress, go for a simplistic half updo, and if you want them to focus on the accessories, go for an elegant half updo like this:<br>  <a href="http://media.photobucket.com/image/half%20updo/danna_032/Hair%20and%20Makeup/hairstyle1.jpg?o=12" rel="nofollow">http://media.photobucket.com/image/half%...</a><br>  <a href="http://media.photobucket.com/image/half%20up%20half%20down/joannecarmoody/Eleanor1.jpg?o=6" rel="nofollow">http://media.photobucket.com/image/half%...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.dcnearlyweds.com/uploaded_images/half-back-of-hair-738586.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.dcnearlyweds.com/uploaded_ima...</a><br>  <a href="http://ivanasusanti.com/sbblog/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/halfup-dsc00008.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://ivanasusanti.com/sbblog/wp-conten...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|yQBFZUlnaa	I would go with how ever your dress is because certain hairstyles fit certain dresses.

GItWq2mGaa	With dry skin during the winter, I was hoping this foundation would do the trick since it seemed thick enough to provide full coverage as well as moisture to my skin. But I'm guessin because this foundation is meant for really dry skin, it contains some ingrediants that causes lots of oil. I ended up breakin out on my cheeks with little bumps. NOT GOOD! so if you have really dry skin, this is for you. But if you acne prone/oily skin, this is a no no! Also, the foundation is kind of slippery so it rubs off on your fingers and clothes.|`|cRkhCfwPaa	I use it and I find that it's the best I've used yet.

Let it settle and dry in for a few seconds <br>  Take small or medium sized piece of your hair and wrap around a curling tong for a few seconds, 10 to 20 should be plenty depending on the thickness and length of your hair. <br>  After unwrapping the strand of hair spritz the curl with a little hair spray. <br>  After you have finished curling all the hair take a thin curl and rap it around the hair tie to hide it and secure the curl in place with bobby pins into the hair tie. <br>  Pop on a small head band and off you go. If you have bangs, make the side pony tail go to the opposite side to your part. <br>  <br>  Or a glam messy bun:<br>  Here is how you glamourize that messy bun style. Brush your hair back into a high ponytail, But on the last loop, do not pull it all the way through. Make it tight, but not so tight it gives you pain! Push the half-loop to your head, and bobby pin or elastic it into place. Pull some pieces around until you get the desired look. Place sparkly clips in random places, but only 2 or 3. <br>  <br>  Curly ponies are cute too:<br>  Brush hair into a high ponytail. Spray with a shine spray for a polished look. Your pony can be messy or neat, doesn't matter. Tease behind elastic for volume. Place curlers or a curling iron into your pony. Use different sized rollers/irons. Leave rollers in 20 minutes, or iron as usual. Be sure to use heated rollers. Take out, lightly spritzing with glitter or extra hold hairspray. <br>  <br>  Now, if you want to leave your hair down, you could try a scrunched look:<br>  Take a shower or make sure your hair is wet. <br>  Comb through your hair and make sure that is thoroughly combed. <br>  Towel dry your hair, but not completely. Your hair still needs to be damp. <br>  Take some gel or mousse ,use more if you have thick hair,and scrunch your hair in your hand while blow drying to solidify. <br>  Add some Aloe Vera shine serum. <br>  <br>  Or leave your hair down with a cute clip:<br>  Take a small amount of hair from each side of your head. <br>  Bring these two parts together to the middle of your scalp and secure with a clip or pin. <br>  Brush the remaining hair down and style the rest as you please. <br>  <br>  Or the POOF is totally in right now:<br>  Grab your hair like a "half ponytail." <br>  Instead of securing it as a ponytail. Use the other hand to push it up (it will be on top of your head) <br>  Secure with a big "head clip" so that it can flair out and poof or fan out on top of you head <br>  Experiment on how to make it look the way you want it. <br>  <br>  If you have side bangs:<br>  Take your side bangs and brush them smooth. Make sure you have a side part. <br>  Pull your bangs back. <br>  Pin them in the place of your choice using a bobby pin or a cute funky clip. <br>  Show off your do and be confident ! <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope some of these work for what you're trying to accomplish, good luck!!|`|MV1l9yGIaa	blow dry it upwards and than shake your head which will give it lift and style, you can curl it, spike up the top a bit. push it forward toward the face and leave it loose. mousse the heck out of it and run your fingers through that after it dries. many things, think!!|`|QyHVVRxuaa	well you could scrunch it or curl it or straighten it. also when you do a pony tail you could get bangs and add a little poof..(or whatever there called) here is a girl showing you how in youtube <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9z6mhXHAt0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9z6mhXHA...</a> and you don't have to make it so big you can pull it back more to make it smaller. you can also do it with your hair down. :) hope this helped. please vote me best!

kB2P2WGtaa	Yellow Concealer Hides Dark Circles|`|s9zC9r9Uaa	use a concealer that is one shade lighter than your actual skin color. I recommend MAC products. If you go to a MAC store or boothe they can help you out as well|`|FxLKs5Vbaa	cucumbers and skin lightening lotiion
cwg7sRJRaa	I'll answer them one at a time:<br>  <br>  1) if you wash your face too much it will overproduce oil, and make things worse. cleanse day and night with a gentle oil-free cleanser, and use a toner afterward (lemon juice is very good: if it stings, dilute it and apply with a cotton pad). don't use heavy moisturiser - it clogs up pores. Also, the obvious: drink lots of water, eat fresh things, don't touch your face. Just getting into good habits makes the world of difference! <br>  One tip I tried that worked very well was using tea-bags. Once you've drank the tea, either rub the warm bag over your whole face or rinse your face with tea. The tannic acid is really good for skin!<br>  <br>  2) I tend to towel dry, add leave-in conditioner and comb it through, and then just let my hair air-dry. My hair goes wavy/curly if I scrunch in some product, or I can dry it straight. But everyone's hair is different, so just experiment with different products and techniques. <br>  <br>  3) Raw potato circles (potassium works WONDERS!) and cold spoons pressed against the eye. Also, lightly pressing with your fingers against the dark areas apparently helps to clear them, just take a few minutes to massage the eye area once you've cleansed. <br>  <br>  Hope that this all helps!|`|UpJbXh7Vaa	1) I have oily skin too. It's really annoying because I never have time to touch up my makeup during school and by 4th period I look awful! I'm not really sure what we can do about it...I have heard rubbing dryer sheets on your face works but I doubt it. <br>  2) When I get out of the shower, I dry it with a towel, put some mousse in it, blow dry, then straighten :) I also have this awesome spray stuff that gets rid of static! It's made for clothes and stuff but it says you can use it in your hair and it totally works<br>  3) Try holding tea bags there for a while. I have heard that works...|`|acfd7907edce364d509ad8e43b8f4f0faa	-Some people's skin are just naturally oily. Washing your face with warm-hot water will help get rid of oiliness. Since hot water usually dries out the skin, it will dry out the excess oil on your face. If you use a moisturizer, make sure it's oil free. If it's not, it'll just add on to the oil on your face. As for acne, I've always heard "Lots of water keeps your skin clear" I drink my share of water per day, and my hair is predominately acne free. I get the occasional pimple, that can't be helped, but a healthy diet will help keep your skin clear. You can also try whatever acne product you think is necessary, if the acne is that bad. You stated you don't like makeup, but if you take a powder and lightly brush it on your entire face, it will counteract with the oil and make your face appear and feel smooth. <br>  <br>  -It depends what kind of problem you have when your hair dries. If your hair is really thin and tangles easily, then you may need a  de-tangle spray. If your hair is really frizzy after you take a shower, only use conditioner every other day. Conditioner does moisturize your hair, but it makes your hair light and more prone to being frizzy. My hair does get frizzy. I take a shower before I go to bed and sleep with my hair wet. When I wake up, my hair is flat and isn't frizzy. I don't know why that works, but it does for me. You can also probably try a anti-frizz shampoo, but I've never found those to work. You can also blow your hair dry, adding a smoothing or shining serum or spray as you dry it. <br>  <br>  -Dark under eyes can be caused by multiple factors. Not getting enough sleep. Stress. Lack of nutrition. Allergies. Or simply hereditary. The first two are rather simple to cure. Set enough time at night for you to sleep soundly, seven to nine hours. Find ways to relax yourself. It doesn't have to be all about work or school. Do things you like sometimes and try to keep your mind off all the problems you may have. Under eye circles could be a cause of allergies, most likely environmental. So if you have sinus congestion or your nose gets stuffy during high pollen count days, try an allergy pill to cure the symptoms and maybe your dark under eyes. <br>  <br>  Vitamins are also important. If you're not getting enough of a certain vitamin, it can cause dark circles. So keep to a healthy diet and take a daily multi-vitamin and the circles should go away. Unfortunately, if you're circles are hereditary, there isn't much you can do to immediately get rid of them. You can probably lessen their appearance with the methods above, but they'll probably always be there. In that case, you may want to consider a concealer if it really bothers you that much. You can simply use a dot of concealer over your circles blend it in. That's it.|`|TfHdQHR7aa	1. Eat apples and drink water. Take birth control. Use oil absorber sheets. At night put on an oil-free mosturizer, preferably one with acne fighting chemicals too. (I suffer from exactly the same things)<br>  2. Use good shampoo and conditioner, appropriate for the type of hair you want, i.e. curly, straight, shiny, smooth. Try Herbal Essences they smell great & work great. Avoid ones with a lot of oil or hair will get greasy. Yes, use a detangler if you need to, but the conditioner should do the trick. On days you will be going out blow dry your hair, it makes it cooperate better. On days you arent, leave it alone so it gets healthy. Putting it in french braids is cute, will leave cute wavy hair in the morning, and promotes growth. Try to avoid dyes and heat products that ruin your hair, but use them if you want to make things look better (i still do). <br>  3. Cant help that much since im a makeup addict. Use cucumbers, that may help. There is also that Garnier Fructice thing out, in a green tube that is supposed to be reaaaally good for under-eye circles.
fpS90nx4aa	nope i dont think it will..ive had mine pierced for 3 years and it still closes i hate it
lOgs3cOmaa	get a dry conciler that is a shade or so lighter than your skin tone. take a little bit and just rub it under your eyes.|`|mjhPteRYaa	This may seem a little odd at first, but a good way to cover them is with matte orange lipstick. (Crazy sounding I know.) Here is a youtube video I found the other day that shows you.. it really does work well! <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkOYBiy1nOA&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkOYBiy1n...</a><br>  <br>   Not sure about the Physicians Formula concealer or the L'Oreal True Match stuff (never used them o.O) but for you question about powder, I would use something with minerals and SPF in them, but make sure you to use a really light moisturizer first.|`|goCugDOKaa	OK! For dark circles, try to get 8 hours a night sleep.  Drink plenty of water.  You can apply cold compresses.  That stuff will help to make the circles lighter.  As far as concealer goes, my mom uses that and she loves it.  Make sure that you use the concealer on the inner corners of your eyes.  People tend to forget that spot.<br>  For powder, I have similar skin tone and I like Lancome's Dual Finish in Matte Porcelaine Délicate.  Bonus: you can use this stuff as a foundation as well.  I also like Hard Candy's Complexion Perfection Powder in Sugar Cookie.  Right now, all Hard Candy stuff is 50% off.  I don't know about the L'Oreal stuff, I am not a big fan of their products.    <br>  Hope this is helpful!|`|hmzMd5TLaa	Use a concealer about one shade darker than the rest of your face. A yellow concealer would work, but you need to add something skin-toned on top.<br>  <br>  Try Make Up For Ever HD Microfinish Powder. I use it and I love it, it keeps my shine-free all day. Also use concealer over any uneven spots (I love Benefit's Boi-ing). You can consider a primer too, to help keep your makeup all day. I use CARGO blu ray High Definition Mattifier, it makes my skin silky smooth. All these can be bought at Sephora.<br>  <br>  I haven't tried the L'Oreal stuff, I'd strongly recommend what I mentioned above- yes, it's a tad pricey, but so worth it, I'd buy it all over again.|`|eow59EaEaa	The best concealer I have ever tried, hands down was from a company called "Colortration" (<a href="http://colortration.com/)" rel="nofollow">http://colortration.com/)</a> whats great is that you can order a sample pack for like $15 and it comes with different colors so you can either mix or find the best color for you. They are highly pigmented so a very little goes a long way. <br>  <br>  I have other makeup artist friends who swear by this concealer. <br>  <br>  As far as powder, it sounds like you need a powder foundation. I have always liked Lancome's Dual Matte because you can use it dry for medium coverage or with a wet sponge for full coverage. Good luck!|`|N1qV2CbZaa	PF is also good. I highly recommend Bare Escentuals. I also have acne scars and uneven skin tone. BE covers all the imperfections of my skin and still looks natural.I tried True Match..I ended up getting blemishes and clogged my pores.|`|OF7ZHq19aa	Good luck with that I have dark circles allso I've used every kind and nothing really works as good as I would like|`|pTzrjknPaa	use a cream concealer stick. <br>  <br>  or use plain cool tea bags over eyes at night. then the puffiness should go away.
MpI6XJ17aa	go to the doctor|`|VcxbDWRUaa	well for the skin, i would put mashed bananas and honey on it. It really helps. also, i had the same problem a few weeks ago, i bought a intense moisterizor and put it on every day. its was gone in a few days.|`|MdOmWPuaaa	Sylvia, is that you?
vhXbGB8naa	It never burned me, but I also add a bit of honey to it. Do only a spot on your face and see if it burns you. I really like aspirin masks and my skin is so clear now.|`|Gew6pZhbaa	It didn't burn. I dissolved the aspirin, added a tiny bit of water, and kind of scrubbed it into my face for a second to exfoliate. Then I let it sit until it dried. It felt OK, I didn't notice significant results. As it tried, whenever I moved my face, white powder fell onto my shirt from the aspirin drying. If you're worried about it hurting, try a tiny bit of it on the side of your cheek, so if it irritates or burns, you can easily hide it with your hair. :O)|`|kfvmQBbhaa	?

bqisLny9aa	it's totally normal. i've had braces for a year and a half now and one time i broke two brackets in less than a week. just try to avoid really hard foods and you'll be fine. breaking brackets can kinda delay your straightening process. sometimes the ortho will put an extra metal band on the tooth that broke so it doesn't fall off again. you can break them from food or another tooth rubbing on the bracket. the ortho will just glue it back on. sometimes you break them unexpectedly. one time i broke a bracket eating soup! lol. i know right.. just try not to break them.. congrats!|`|u603FdFsaa	its perfectly normal! i just snapped off a bracket a couple of days ago while i was eating a strawberry|`|1l7bK325aa	its normal and just go to your dentist again to glue it on or do it yourself by using a plier although i would not recommend to do so|`|WfQf2wBNaa	YEA DATS normal lol<br>  juss doesn't look so good. lmao,<br>  <br>   ..BUT YOU'LL BEE FiiNE IT'S OKAYY? haha,,|`|EV2LMaiLaa	yeah he will glue it back on <br>  <br>  <br>  stop playing with it lol <br>  <br>  i plucked 3 of mine off|`|GBOgsAoDaa	that is so normal! if you have apple ortho u can get it fixed for free if its your 1st 5 times:)|`|6AnhlCyQaa	yeah its very normal! i have braces too and if you call them you can go in and it will take like 20 minutes! hope i helped!|`|nRIk4aSBaa	Yes very normal.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  happens to every one.<br>  <br>  <br>  next time you see your orthodontist tell them they will fix it no problem|`|mvbPfzwLaa	yeah.. i broke a bracket after lyk a week. its normal, but you want to go tell him to glue it back

Knc43SOvaa	well madison you are only 13 so it is probably up to ur mom at this point however maybe if u try to be mature about it for a bit and don't harass her to much about it then just ask her to set down and talk to u about it maybe even show her some info about it online and let her see the shop that u will be getting it done at.that might help her make her mind up to let u get it done. <br>  <br>  oh and paying for it yourself will probably help on this matter! just make sure this is something that u really want bc if u get it done and decide u don't like it after wards it will leave a small scar.<br>  <br>  i am 23 and have had mine done twice bc the first one got ripped out. and there is a little pain involved just so u know.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|mBVXgRLFaa	i got mine done for my 16th birthday. 13 honestly seems a little young in my opinion. but do your research and set up a specific time.<br>  <br>  and just to let you know, 43 is a very strange price. when i got it (and from everywhere ive seen) the piercing was free but the ring was 35 and barbells were 50.|`|2dgHgxhtaa	i know it might be hard because you really want one but i think you should wait until your a little older like 15 or 16.<br>  <br>  trust me its not the end of the world. im 17 and i want a tattoo but i have to wait.|`|Ff15178saa	if you tried more than one time n mom is always saying tomorrow tell her ma u always say tomorrow can you please just listen to me , dont get into fight cuz u need her to sign the permission slip cuz ur not 18<br>  i dont know where u live but dude 43 dollars way way to much where i live here in ny the city i live in it cost only 25 dollars what state do you live in ??

I'm not just saying that to discourage you from dieting, either.<br>  <br>  I'm extremely thin, and even I have "rolls" when I sit slumped over.  As for the rolls around your ribs, I doubt it's fat--it's most likely just your skin all scrunched up from slumping.  Try sitting up straight with your shoulders back.  It will smooth out the rolls and probably make your stomach appear flatter.
wOsxpIjYaa	I have the same problem and it always bothers me. While I am talking and someone notices it I say "Its peach fuzz". But I tried that stuff and the hair grew back more dark and now i got it waxed and It has not grown back. You could try it but its a 50,50 chance that it will work. I wish good luck to you and remember its not hair.... its peach fuzz!!|`|1Tdkb8OGaa	I use Sally Hasen. I think it's the same.It works pretty well.Just put it on with a Q-Tip or the dispenser it has,wait about 10 minutes.Take a cotton ball and wipe it off with a moist one(one that was in hot water)then put on some moisturizer.(I recommend that you do this at night so you dont ruin your skin with the sun)|`|3DkTjqcbaa	It depends, if you're removing upper lip hair for the first time, then it'll take longer to grow back out. But everytime you get rid of you hair, it'll grow back thicker and faster. <br>  <br>  Nair burns. You can try plucking or waxing instead. <br>  <br>  Yes, Nair works.|`|mD4Xn3jNaa	i haven't used the hair removal <br>  <br>  i've used the bleach where you bleach your mustache and makes it almost invisible. it works well and i like it|`|7AndmAg4aa	i haven't used Nair for my lip but i use it for my legs. and it stays smooth for about a week. which is long if you think about it.|`|wIZNsqG1aa	Just use a piece of tape and pull it off real fast, it will hurt a bit but the hair will be gone in no time.|`|AA10517807	no don't do it it will make your hair more then you'll get a real ugly mustache, bleach it , or  put some peroxide or witch hazel on it, it  will lighten up the hair ,<br>  do even laser but don't shave or use those cream you'll regret it forever.<br>  believe me, you don't want mustaches|`|2jgcy1ATaa	i used that stuff too! haha. works great for me. i usually have to apply it twice thoguh. do u know a better way to do it?

4LQoT4geaa	Yes, you should definitely dilute your setting lotion. If you don't, your curls will end up being really stiff and crunchy. You should use three parts water to one part setting lotion. Translation: one ounce of setting lotion to every three ounces of water.
ArFFUPTBaa	im like that too sorta..<br>  <br>  Not a problem, what I found is helpful is saving money to invest and watching it grow. My father use to tell me I should put some portion of my money into index funds that buy the entire stock market. He said when you are young in 30 year or when ever you retire, the stock market will be a lot better than now. Every 7 years your money will double. So putting say $5000 into say a Vanguard Total Stock market, will become $20000 in 14 years.<br>  <br>  If you keep doing this at your age, you will easily be a multi- millionaire well before most people even think of retiring.<br>  <br>  When it comes to gadgets, I give myself the 30 day rule. If I want to buy it, regardless of what it is, I put the money in my money market fund and wait 30 days. After that time I generally find the novelty has worn off or I would like to spend the money on something else. Either way, even if I spend the money, I at least get 30 days interest on that money. It's not much, but even that will add up, if you set a rule not to spend that money. After a year you get to see how many gadgets you got interest on and their impact on you and also see your investments grow. In a sense you are still being material, but being more responsible with your future|`|sYO70GJRaa	Maybe it's an emotional problem. Is there something in your life that's bothering you? Sometimes, when I'm feeling lonely or anxious about my boyfriend, I go on shopping sprees and I feel GREAT for a brief period of time, because shopping helps me forget about real life. <br>  <br>  I'm often so focussed on self-improvement that shopping. Don't make the mistake by thinking that excessive shopping can compensate for everything else. It's easy to feel powerful and independent when you have something new to occupy you, but talking things out can help break the cycle. Sometimes if you suffer from self-esteem issues, buying copious amounts of makeup seems to reassure people for a short time only. <br>  <br>  If this is not the case with you, then maybe you are addicted to shopping, but you can get help for that. Maybe try buying a present for your mum instead of something for yourself and see if that helps to relieve the urge to buy more, more, more. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!
SdaBMXkbaa	To some extent, yes, but not absolutely.  You have to be careful of stereotypes, meaning that some clothing choices might mislead you to think that someone is X when in fact they aren't.<br>  <br>  I'll give a real example.  My boyfriend and I both wear leather pants.  I'll bet some people's minds are already working on that one!<br>  <br>  Well...here's the deal: We aren't into S&M; we aren't pimp and hoe; we aren't goths; we aren't neo nazis; we aren't homosexual; and we aren't rock stars.  And yes, we both saw the episode of Friends, and we both found it funny, so we aren't ignorant either.  However, all that said, I'll bet that we get misjudged *constantly* due to the deeply rooted stereotypes regarding "who wears leather and why".  What we both are, are people who like comfort and who like to look good, albeit different.  And, there is a huge discrepancy between looking different and looking bad - huge.<br>  <br>  I guess the only common belief regarding leather, and who wears it, that some might have, and which does apply to us, is having money.  We aren't millionaires, but we are both lawyers, so we have above average income and we buy very high quality leather that doesn't have the cheap rocker look to it.  Trust me; there is a difference!<br>  <br>  Oh yes, and one more myth buster.  We both wear our leather to work - on occasion; not every day - and it's completely OK.  No, we don't wear it if we have client meetings, but for quiet days, it's fine.  Neither of us has ever had any issue whatsoever.|`|Nsh3lVDPaa	Yes. I dress in khaki pants, madras plaid shorts, polo shirts, Sperry shoes, North Face jacket, oxford shirts, and classic sweaters.<br>  <br>  And I'm going to a prep school, I play lacrosse, and get top grades.<br>  <br>  And pot is bad ):|`|EoWS4Xz7aa	nope i dont think so to preppy girls to dark mysterious girls smoke pot varies|`|rxKvdkFyaa	Yeah it kinda does. Cuz most people if they're goth, no duh they wear black. If they LOVE pink, they'll wear uber girly things. If they're emo, they'll have lots of black clothes and maybe some punk/scene stuff? Skaters (sometimes. take no offense if you dress like this and are not 'skater') would wear converse and skinny jeans with a tight-ish top? Idk. For me I love music so I have this cute shirt that has music cassettes on it and my fave jacket has boom boxes on it. Idk what a 'pot smoker' would dress like cuz they're mostly people who look and dress as any one else would just...they smoke pot!! I hope I sorta answered your question the way you expected. If not, oh well. Have a great day!<3|`|2dgHgxhtaa	What you do doesnt reflect the way you dress. There are preppy rich kids who do drugs and no one knows.<br>  <br>  There are also innocent looking people who secrelty do bad stuff so no it doesnt.|`|xHC8fNdiaa	i dnt think what you dress like can reflect on your interests( excrpt sometimes jocks) but i do think the way u dress can reflect your personality to an extent|`|Y3O9TXQ7aa	Not for me,no.I mean,my closest has clothes have prep-ish clothing,goth corsets,jeans,tees,guys clothes,and any other random peice of clothing I have.You could probably separate it into three different clique type of clothing,but it's comfy and that's why it's there.

I used to be worried but I just desided to give up and live my life. Im not too concerened about the size of sacs of fat on my chest. And guys shouldnt worry about their penis size because apperently when they are erect they are allabout the same size. I dont know if thats true buts thats what my health teacher said. lol|`|4u6ox4RAaa	I dont really worry about my breast size, kinda wish they were smaller sometimes so they didnt get in the way, or i could run around without a bra. other than that dont really care, but i geuss i kind of have a good size, so i have nothing to fuss about.|`|DB2hVNImaa	DUH..... otherwise why would practically everyone wear padded and push up bras and wonder bras and have implants ... <br>  thought when they are TOOOOO big thats also a problem.|`|nDxjnlN6aa	i have one thats bigger than the other one. i honestly dont care about their size. but they do look funny. boobs are strange

So, technically, you're short, but I know most of the girls I know are 5'2, 5'3-ish. To me, you're average.|`|ycVIhOQoaa	What does height matter? anyways, there is no such thing as a short girl. these "short" girls aren't short, they are just funsized!|`|KsJBKRmxaa	Yea thats short.

eN5xA6RKaa	yea you can put those in your lip. one of my friends had it too. 1/2" might be the length of the ring.<br>  go ahead and order it.<br>  rings are not specifically for one piercing, most can be used in many things like for example..curved eyebrow barbells can be used for tragus piercings and bridge piercings, and straight barbells can be used for nipples, tongues, and surface piercings.|`|rPFfDR7Laa	you are so cute it doesn't matter what lip ring you wear! it should work, as long as you get a 14g, but i don't know what the 1/2" is referring to on the jewelry.|`|4KLM96nDaa	Those are actually made for a lip piercing,<br>  not an eyebrow piercing or anything else,<br>  so yes, you could use one in your piercing,<br>  just make sure you get the right gauge size !

N7I1NT6Maa	You're so pretty!  I love your style, although frankly I'm a little intimidated by it, haha.  I think if I saw you walking by I'd be like "yikes, she's so trendy, I better not talk to her as she probably wouldn't want to be seen with a "jeans and a tee shirt" type of gal".  I'm not sure if guys would feel the same way, probably not as it seems many of them are completely oblivious when it comes to these sorts of things.|`|m0Hd7Kj3aa	i love it! i wish i was as creative as you...as far as guys, i think they would find it attractive...i think because you would stand out (i mean that in a good way)|`|c3j49t9Faa	I like you in the first picture.

eb4c35dafb35b0cdb90317b7fc657b3faa	Have you ever been to a Military ball?  I have.  The Marine Corps Birthday ball.  The women (including myself) were in full blown ball gowns.<br>  <br>  The dress was right down to the floor, with the petticoat underneath to make the skirt bell out.<br>  <br>  Hate to say it, but if you show up in a dress like you showed, you will look like a hooker, compared to all the other ladies.<br>  <br>  I was terribly fortunate and was able to purchase my dress after prom season was over.  They had the $260 dress on clearance for $35.<br>  <br>  Are there any woman you can contact who have been to the ball before that will help you shop?<br>  <br>  If you could not wear the dress as a bridesmaid dress in a FORMAL wedding, you should NOT wear it to the ball.  I'm just trying to save you from a very unhappy experience.  You do not want the snide comments from the other women, the looks, and your date refusing to dance with you (because your dress cannot be seen on the dance floor).  If your dress is too short, they will probably simply refuse to allow you to enter the ball.  <br>  <br>  They will also escort you out if you get drunk.<br>  <br>  Next to a wedding, a military ball is one of the most formal situations you can be in.<br>  <br>  ~Garnet<br>  Permaculture homesteading/farming over 20 years|`|ugcMPr20aa	Try checking at Windsors or Macy's|`|hL3eS2zKaa	You should try wearing tights with it, a belt to cinch it at the waist, and try a clutch.

e5CuEiPfaa	I had the same problem, and I figured out that the products I was using was just drying my face out. So I started using a face wash and moisturizer together and that seemed to help. I really like the Olay line, and it may say for anti-aging, but it helped clear up my acne while getting rid of the greasy and dry areas within a week to two weeks! Go to www.Olayforyou.com and you can get a customized plan for your facial time!! Good luck!|`|m5N8Ur6Daa	It's winter, so the cold air outside and heat inside make skin super dry. What I do is I apply a super strong moisturizer to my face for a few days until the drying goes away, then I deal with any pimples that may have sprouted from using thick lotion.<br>  As far as I'm concerned, I would rather have a few pimples than super dry, painful, flakey skin!<br>  Try putting on a thick lotion onto the dry spots and then just putting a tiny dab of acne medication on any pimples.|`|8oKazGVGaa	sounds like what your using is too harsh for your skin you might have to get a heavy night moisturizer

i38Ev1Zaaa	What type of shampoo are you using?<br>  <br>  If your not using volumizing shampoo, your hair can be overly weighed down, causing it to go flat. Try the Matrix AMPLIFY line of shampoos, they're great for lightweight and effective shampoos/conditioners:<br>  <a href="http://www.folica.com/Matrix_Amplify__d2163.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.folica.com/Matrix_Amplify__d2...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  After you shampoo, are you blowdrying with mousse? if not, get yourself a nice volumizing mousse. Apply about two palmfuls of mousse to dry or damp hair, focusing it around the roots of your hair, and blowdry with a round brush in layers. If you don't have a round brush, you can blowdry it backwords, moving it around with your hands.<br>  Amlify also has a great mousse, but it's a bit pricey. The Garnier Fructis mousse is a great fix for a good price though:<br>  <a href="http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?skuId=2111169&productId=prod2111169&navAction=push&navCount=1&categoryId=cat120026" rel="nofollow">http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productD...</a><br>  <br>  After you finish blowdrying your hair, and there are still sections you want to be even more volumized, lift sections up and spray them with root lifter, and brush it through with a teasing comb, teasing a little bit if necessary.<br>  <br>  Nexxus and BIG SEXY HAIR make good root lifter sprays, but they are a bit pricey. The Pantene Root lifter is a great fix for a good price:<br>  <a href="http://www.pantene.com/en-US/product/volume_rootliftervolumizingspraygelmaxhold.jspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.pantene.com/en-US/product/vol...</a><br>  <br>  Also, running a curling iron through your hair before you do all of this is a great way to add volume to your hair, and ti gives your hair a new, curly/wavy look thats really in right now.<br>  <br>  For looser waves, just run a 1 1/4 or 1 1/2 inch culring iron through 1 inch pieces of your hair, and if you want curls rather than waves, just run a 1 inch curling iron through your hair. I recommend a Hot Tools if possible if not a wigo is a great affordable option:<br>  <a href="http://www.folica.com/Hot_Tools_Profe_d1012.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.folica.com/Hot_Tools_Profe_d1...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?skuId=2167362&productId=xlsImpprod1000076&navAction=push&navCount=1&categoryId=cat1000003" rel="nofollow">http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productD...</a><br>  <br>  good luck!|`|QMgN7E4Saa	well if u put a lot of moose in it like half a bottle then flip ur hair over, and put hairspray by the roots and blow dry that then flip back over and then even if u staighten it .it will still be volumized|`|tVsIxJwOaa	You can get shampoo and conditioner that has volume in it, and then get out of the shower, then blow dry your hair, but when you blow dry your hair put your head down so it's hanging down and blow dry it.|`|22bef8b28219c364cd5a97ca5b5320edaa	root lifter, pantene makes a good one. blow dry in sections with a round brush then tease a bit, if needed on top or at crown

lIpjuMTHaa	You seem to be too easily swayed into falling in love. Wait a while with this girl before doing the tattoo thing. And do not use the same design that you were going to use for the old girlfriend. <br>  <br>  My man wanted to get my FACE on his ribcage when we had been dating two months. It was going to be a surprise but while he was waiting to have it drawn up he couldn't help but call and tell me. Luckily I talked him out of it. Then about a week later he surprised me with my initials in a heart on his wrist. It was cute, weird at first but we are still together and happy so it wasn't a mistake.|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	Lmao. Yeah macho man - go for it, totally. Great idea.<br>  Could I have Esmerelda's email address?<br>  I can't wait to hear her reaction!|`|4zQEvzCsaa	I personally love tattoos on guys, but name tattoos are a BAD IDEA! You didn't go the distance with Amy and you were going to get her name tattooed on you, so what are the odds you'll make it with Esmarelda? Then what do you do? Plus that name wouldn't come out well in a tattoo. Get an actual design, not a name.|`|rjac15O0aa	I'm married and still won't get my wife's name tattooed on me...  I agree with the first answer!  Get it on tape and send it to AFV!!!|`|gu0AxKyiaa	hahaha i wouldnt get a girls name point blank end of converstation|`|OqD4Z6wpaa	hahaha well what would amy say?|`|2inq4zHZaa	First of all, let me say that I love tattoos.<br>  Second, using the same design from Amy's tattoo is not very romantic.<br>  Third, getting a girl's name tattooed on you is by no means "macho" or "cool".  It's just a tattoo.<br>  <br>  You know what would really suck?  If you break up.  Yeah, it could happen.  Then you will have some chicks name in your skin for the rest of your life.  I doubt your next girlfriend will appreciate that one.  I hope you can find another Esmarelda.  <br>  I begged my husband not to tattoo my name on his arm.  But he did anyways.  It looks great, he likes it, but it's still dumb.  What if we get divorced?  He has it for life.  I suggest that you try something else.  Maybe you could get a tattoo of something that symbolizes her to you.  Get that instead.  Then you won't have her name forever.|`|d9B4EVFxaa	I say do what you want but honestly the only names that should be tattooed on you are your children, your parents(grandparents), and a loved one that is no longer with you (a in memory of tattoo)....boyfriend/girlfriend even husband/wife tattoos not a great idea...things happen and you break up...how will your next girlfriend feel when she is staring at your ex's name on your body??|`|AA12381892	talk to esmerelda.dont use the other chick desighns.thats just TRASHY.and you never know how it would look until you actually get an example.so dont down her name just because its long.(i have a long name.including my 10 letter first name,six middle names,and two last names)personally i think its a very stupid idea.it doesnt make you look macho.it makes you luk like a dumb *** when you break up.and one day you'll marry someone else and your kids will say "daddy,whos esmerelda?"take you and amy for instance.if you had her name tatooed on your arm right now do you think you and esmerelda would be datng?how about getting a tatoo of a girls name once you have been married for at leat 5 years.sound like a plan?|`|WelEvYwGaa	Um....She will be mad! You are her man, not Amy's!!!<br>  <br>  Why don't you shorten her name or use a nickname?<br>  <br>  Esma<br>  Esme<br>  Emerald<br>  Marel<br>  Arelda<br>  Besides, you could still use the full length and it would look fine. I have seen longer names on people and they looked good.<br>  <br>  A girl's name doesn't mean you are macho. It means you are whipped and branded!|`|tRNtFNHLaa	i think that would be weird, but if you like it then get it.|`|pOufymEJaa	go for it|`|ZvOXs61caa	DONTTTTTT.

Sea salt soak it 2-3 times a day, using a shot glass to cup around the piercing (1/4 tsp for a cup of water, get it as warm as you can stand and leave it there until it's cold). And of course follow your piercers aftercare instructions.<br>  <br>  The spray the above answer was talking about is H2Ocean spray which also does wonders for a piercing, definitely recommend it.<br>  <br>  ...If you're stupid enough to go the beach to keep your piercing clean or make it heal faster or wtfever, you're too stupid to have a belly piercing. kthxbai.|`|xw495UB8aa	It doesn't really hurt after you get it done.

It's made for body piercings and it worked wonders. Mine healed really fast. It's like h2o something.

kc7OOiX5aa	Hey lovely! I'm not entirely sure I understand the type of cut you have, but here are some suggestions for shorter hair:<br>  <br>  Use bobbypins to pin your bangs into diferent positions, try twisting them, pulling them back across your head, lifting them into curls. <br>  <br>  Try curling your hair using curlers- curling just the ends or just your bangs then pinning them back looks really cute. <br>  <br>  An alterative method is to: wash your hair (as you normally would) towl dry it until it's dry enough to handle easily, now take strands of hair in you fingers and twist them. Let your hair dry, when its dry, you should have gorgous spiraling curls! <br>  <br>  Try bobbypins with ribbons on them! They look cute.<br>  <br>  Wear decorative headbands, either across your head or at your hairline. Wearing neon hairbands is very popular at the moment, try using more than one, two or three next to eachother looks really funky.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|gkb1upi8aa	bald
GSu34HUqaa	Think where to get it done :)<br>  That depends where you live. I'm sure you could google piercing parlors in your area.<br>  <br>  Should i get it done with a gun or needle?<br>  They will ALWAYS pierce it with a needle. They never pierce the body with a gun.<br>  <br>  How long will my belly button be sore after i get one?<br>  I just got mine done on Saturday (:, it's still sore.<br>  <br>  Infections? What should i do to prevent them? or what should i do when i have one?<br>  Infections are possible. Alot of people get them. To prevent them, clean it frequently! If you have one, which it's pretty normal, then clean it. Or consult with your doctor just to be on the safe side.<br>  <br>  <br>  Have fun with your belly button piercing if you get one! &Good luck! (:|`|mBVXgRLFaa	are you serious!??? you cant get your belly button done with a gun! hahahaha. and yeah, it will be sore. when you get it pierced they will explain the care to you, but you wash and twist it twice per day with water and antibacterial soap. only touch it with your hands etc etc etc. dont pick at the scab.|`|FxLKs5Vbaa	i got mine done about 8 years ago at a tattoo and piercing shop. He used a clamp to hold the skin and I think a needle to pull through. I had my eye closed. It hurts but its quick pain. I never got an infection because I cleaned it like every 2 minutes for a month. lol. I used neutragena initially to clean it then changed to sea salt. The sea salt works wonderfully. It keeps the area clean and dry.|`|tlGpXXp6aa	You probably won't get an infection unless it has some sort of blood on the needle. But its not likely to happen. Yes, you should get it done with a needle. Thats just my preference. Your belly button will be sore for about 2 days I believe. I think I answered all of your questions. Good Luck! Vote as Best Answer!!|`|OFxarBEhaa	the needle is safer, in fact the gun is illegal now so anywhere that uses one isnt the best place to go to.<br>  <br>  itll be sore the first few days, but not very sore.<br>  <br>  keep cleaning it regularly to stop infections.|`|13LutlWBaa	i'm a 16 year old guy and i think they look retarded.
6npsRIzUaa	PLEASE don't get it done with a gun. That will cause trauma to your ear, not to mention it can not be cleaned properly completely so it could easily infect your ears. Go to a professional piercer and have them pierce it with a hollow needle, the pain is really not that bad and it'll be a much happier piercing.|`|Br9Ze4EGaa	Either of which can be painful, but needles are more sterile and cause less damage to the tissue. Needles actually remove the tissue, guns simply push it aside which can lead to scars and keloids later on.|`|rPFfDR7Laa	get it done with a needle.  doesn't matter which hurts more, because having a blunt object forced through your skin (like a piercing gun) is not healthy, and you will have a hard ball of scar tissue in your ear.  if you get it done with a needle, you will have normal holes, not hard ball like ones, because the needles are hollow and actually remove the skin, rather than shoving the skin aside, like a piercing gun does.|`|tnUhxfjlaa	the gun is way bad for your ears, it does so much more damage, needle is your best bet, it will heal a lot quicker and better if you get it done with a needle|`|6ri7AYC1aa	The needle hurts less.<br>  Also it safer.<br>  Piercers have years of experience and training. While the person at a store spent 2 weeks practicing on a teddy bear.|`|pwiRMmicaa	the gun is really fast and not painful but the needle might take longer but just go for it! it didn't really hurt on me.
1nC4fVw3aa	light brown|`|BHxewP3naa	I'm a blonde but I wish I were a brunette! I personally think long voluminous brown hair is the sexiest! I envy girls with that hair!|`|SKZeKipOaa	It really depends on the type of person. IF your fair i dont think that you should have blonde hair because you can look washed out. Black hair would suit somebody with a little tanner skin colour so that you dont look so white against your hair. Brown hair seems to go with every skin colour so I am going to say brown hair suits alot nicer than any other colour.|`|ZZkl8licaa	Blonde with Black Stripes ;)|`|2QrD904Gaa	black|`|FlZ76mDQaa	black is just so pretty!|`|vlLkleURaa	Um, I think it depends on how well the colour suits the girl! Some girls look stunning with blonde hair but it can look lifeless against certain skin tones. Black hair cat look wonderful but can also give a rather witch-like look to some unfortunate girls. And red can be fiery and eye-catching but  isn't so nice with naturally red cheeks.<br>  <br>  And of course we know that up to 10% of the male population suffer from colour-blindness anyway, so who's to say that the one a girl's trying to impress won't mistake her lovely blonde locks for grey? :-)|`|9dTxncp2aa	I personally dont like blonde if its unnatural<br>  Most of the time it looks dirty and greasy.<br>  <br>  To me, it just depends on what hair color goes with a girls skin tone.<br>  But I seem to lean towards reds and violet-ish colored hair =)
dc5579dda31633fb3c2d8612ff7583cdaa	I really like CoverGirl Tru Blend. It goes on so smoothly and blends into the skin nicely. It is like a mousse and is very velvety and creamy. It will cover up any imperfection you have and last a long long time. I have a problem with shiny looking skin and have not had that problem with this product. Plus it is not expensive at all. Since using this foundation my makeup has looked so much better. I've even used Bare Minerals and it doesn't work near as great as this does. Good luck and I hope you give it a try!! I love it!!!!|`|XZlFLecLaa	MAC - its the best ... worth the price...<br>  but if you go to Target or something then stick with Cover GIrl Or Physicians Formula|`|ywZ49zCQaa	Try Maybelline Pure Makeup. Its a really nice shine free oil free foundation, perfect for enough cover up if you dont have pimples. I have oily skin so it was pretty hard to find something that would not make it even oilier, but i found this stuff and it worked great. I bought mine at walmart so they probably sell it at walgreens or target too.|`|s4psKJrPaa	i use loreal mineral powder concealer, foundation, and blush, it works really well! its like 12 bux or so at target :)<br>  <br>  mine please!! <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AgsDsPWyyqxOFGIKF4PzYEbsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090226165707AAWBqLj">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|U2U624i5aa	this one!!! :<a href="http://well.ca/images/medium/products/revlon-new-complexion-one-step-m_1185286044_MED.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://well.ca/images/medium/products/re...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  WORKS AMAZING!!!!   oil free!! i use it and its like 15 bucks :) available at walmart|`|wRwlERW6aa	the almay brand works good.. the one where it transform into the right skin color.. it doesn't clog pores so you don't have to worry about getting acne or zits or whatever|`|W6mUJQiNaa	well my mom works inna hair salon cuz she's a hairstylist. and well she's always bringin home new products and stuff and of course.. makeup. and her salon just got a new makeup line called mirabella. and ohhmygodd there makeup is awesome. especially their foundation. i mean like, i put it on and it looks like nothin is even on my face.. it's amazing. i really reccommend mirabella.|`|pTzrjknPaa	department store: clinique <br>  <br>  regular store [target or walmart]: allmay or covergirl are both great choices.
OfHoaWf7aa	I suggest Avon Ultra Luxury eyeliner. It glides on nicely and has lasting power. I wear contact lenses and it doesn't bother me. To top it off, the price is very reasonable. Hope this helps!|`|fIRyCLcGaa	I love this one in particular by the Body Shop. I think there eyeliners work great. I love them.|`|tTIANoryaa	Use organic eyeliner, it's better to use and it shows up more, if you want eyeliner to show up even more, then just heat up the tip of the sharpened end by using a lighter but only for about 3-5 seconds, then let it dry for about 15 seconds and don't burn yourself. It works for me. <br>  Hope I helped|`|goCugDOKaa	For liquid, chanel is great.  Or use some black eyeshadow and get a supersmall brush.  Wet the brush and apply it like eyeliner.  <br>  For pencil, I like lancome.  It stays on all day long.  I use the eyeshadow on the top of my eyes and the lancome pencil on the bottom.|`|3UUilV5vaa	Sephora brand eyeliner comes out very dark & defined...no smudges and running (yeah, im talkin to you, walgreens)|`|JLNX5nnwaa	avon or mac|`|0bta9ccpaa	My favorites include CoverGirl Perfect Point Plus in black onyx (dark black and it glides on at the perfect line plus its one of those ones that you twist and its not a pencil so it won't cut your eyelids and its not a liquid liner so you can use it even with no experience.)<br>  <br>  My other favorite is Heidi Klum's Very Sexy Glitter Liquid Liner in licorice. (It glides on perfectly and adds green sparkles to your eyes. Makes your eyes really POP!)|`|TLh4S3OZaa	i like e.l.f. and everythings a dollar check it out online. just typr in elf cosmetics! everythings a good price! and its amazing stuff!|`|c8dd102e2ff658f1e19a52693885ce36aa	pencil honestly go to mac and get "smouldering"....its black..creamy and has long lasting power...its also really easy to apply and works great if you love a quick smokey eye!

I got mines at Bebe for about 110$, it was just all white scoopneck dress that hit just above my knee.<br>  Good luck (:|`|easm1TkYaa	You can't go wrong with a little black dress. It's classy for church, but still really cute. Pair it with cute heels and some small hoop earrings and you're good to go. But keep the dress' length to about knee length and don't show any cleavage... it has to be appropriate for church!
29EORG8Iaa	So this is long but I answered every you asked.<br>  <br>  1) A brand I really recommend would be Smashbox, however they are very expensive.  They have make up for any look you need to create and it can look very natural or very modern.  If you're looking for something a little less pricey, I'd recommend Revlon above any other drugstore brand.<br>  <br>  2) MAC is a great brand, as well. I would recommend any of their cream eyeshadows for every day use and on a professional level. Their new Hello Kitty line is phenomenal.<br>  <br>  3) Revlon. It is very good quality.<br>  <br>  4) Avon is a good brand. I especially like their lip products. I don't like their eyeshadows, however. They are very stiff.<br>  <br>  5) Urban Decay Primer Potion. Worth the splurge, believe me. It makes eyeshadow stay on for a very long time and makes the colour pop.<br>  <br>  MY FAVOURITE MAKE UP ITEM: It's a tie between "Color Design: Sensational Effects Eye Shadow" and Benefit's "BADgal Plum" mascara.<br>  <br>  Eye shadow: Stays on, unique colours, smooth<br>  <br>  Mascara: Plum is a good colour for my blue eyes and it lengthens my lashes, amazingly well.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!|`|UEKVcjofaa	1) mascara thats where i started!

ZIq2IzOmaa	A piercing that is able to reject (like a navel, eyebrow, or other surface piercing) can reject at any point. <br>  <br>  The body usually accepts these piercings as long as there is very little stress on them, but if that situation changes, the body will begin to force them out. So getting your piercing snagged, bumped, or squished could lead to rejection. If your body goes through changes in the area, like weight gain around a navel piercing, it may change the dynamics of your skin and the piercing will no longer be accepted. <br>  <br>  Some piercings stay put forever. Others will close and the skin inside them will be broken down by the body to seal the opening. Which result you get depends on your body, the condition of the piercing when you removed it, and how well established the piercing was. So a navel piercing that you take out because you're tired of it may stay there for years. A navel piercing that is irritated or trying to reject will likely close if you remove it because the body is focused on repairing the area at the time.|`|WLuEIwp5aa	Yes, though it's not very likely unless it gets jostled around a whole lot.|`|PSNlx2M1aa	Yes it is, its like getting your ears pierced
6npsRIzUaa	It depends on how long you have the jewelry in for and depends on your body. Some people have it in for four years and it never closes, some have it in for four years and it closes in an hour. It'll leave a tiny scar that you could only see if you were looking for it... especially if it's on your tongue web, which is under your tongue..<br>  You should use a curved barbell for the jewelry.|`|c5anDswjaa	Piercing holes close 99% of the time unless you have them gauged out..

IN1oikSbaa	H2Ocean. A solution to piercing problems. Tis love. I swear.<br>  <br>  Alright. If you're honestly cleaning it 12-16 times a day that can be horrible for it. Seriously. It may get irritated/dried out due to over cleansing; both outside and in.  T H2Ocean is a nice 'refresher/moisture' spray that I use when mine starts to get a little fussy. Just a quick spray and it tends to calm down. I carry the little bottle along with me just for that reason. You can get it at most piercing parlors not to mention hot topic and sometimes Spencers. <br>  <br>  Also, when you're in the shower and cleaning it with soap, dontdontdont leave the soap on for anymore than 25 seconds. That'll irritate it a bit too.<br>  <br>  If you think it gets infected: <br>  Just soak your ear in a warm (not horridly HOT) sea salt soak for about 10 minutes twice a day. Make sure it's warm but not uncomfortably hot. The heat from the soak'll draw out all the bacteria and nasty gunk/puss, ect from your piercing and it'll slowly clean it out.<br>  <br>  Just be sure to soak twice a day for 5-10 minutes with a less salty solution than normal if you think it's infected. Be sure to use SEA SALT and not regular table salt.<br>  <br>  But here's a few other alternatives if you'd like to try these.<br>  <br>  Acceptable Healing Aids and Products<br>  <br>  * Tea Tree Oil - This soothing liquid cools and refreshes an irritated piercing. Use only high quality tea tree oil that has been diluted with distilled water.<br>  * Emu Oil - A universal healing product that has been discovered to also produce exceptional results when healing a piercing.<br>  * H2Ocean - Although some would call it "glorified saline solution," most do report excellent healing results with this product.<br>  * Saline Solution - Less expensive and more readily available than most other products, saline solution is very effective in soothing and healing a new piercing. It's also an acceptable substitute for sea salt soaks.<br>  <br>  Do NOT Use:<br>  <br>  * Hydrogen Peroxide - Hydrogen peroxide kills bacteria, but it also kills the white blood cells attempting to heal your piercing. It can cause irritation and lengthen overall healing time.<br>  * Rubbing Alcohol - Alcohol will dry the skin and irritate the raw piercing, which could actually lead to infection.<br>  * Glyoxide - This is a product that contains hydrogen peroxide and hinders healing rather than aiding it.<br>  * Ear Care Solution - Solutions that are provided by jewelry boutiques and department store piercers usually contain alcohol, hydrogen peroxide and other harmful chemicals that only aggravate a new piercing.<br>  * Ointments - Antibacterial ointments or similar products only clog pores and/or kill good cells trying to heal the piercing.<br>  <br>  Using alcohol of any sort can horridly dry out the piercing and cause scarring.<br>  Good luck and I hope you enjoy your piercing! (=|`|c5anDswjaa	Yeahhh dont wash them so much.. Id say no more than 5 times a day.. Oozies and crusties are normal for a few weeks to a year or so, dont pick at them though unless youre taking them off of the jewelry.. If you want to clean them off your skin, use water on a q-tip to soften it up and clean it off..  <br>  <br>  Use diluted mouthwash (half mouthwash half water) to clean the inside 2 or 3 times a day..

4d8d4c098dc38b2c9b7c7eaad75ba2acaa	I have oily skin and really like Revlon's Colorstay foundation for combination/oily skin. It gives good coverage, doesn't cause breakouts, and it lasts all day. I wouldn't recommend mineral makeup unless you want a very sheer look. Mary Kay has a mineral foundation with a nice matte finish, but it gives hardly any coverage.<br>  When looking at foundation it's important to look for oil-free kinds that say they are noncomedogenic (it means they won't clog pores and cause breakouts). A lot of drugstore brands are like this but I found that the Revlon Colorstay has the best coverage.|`|jKA8SovQaa	mac =]|`|goCugDOKaa	A mineral based makeup would be best for you.

5jSbmMuUaa	I have that stuff and it works great!! If you are talking about the store called "The Body Shop" then yes definitely go for it! another good thing to use with it is "St. Ives apricot ( i think its body wash??) " but if you use the St.Ives then use the tea tree stuff then use the St. Ives again (your skin might feel dry) but i did that once and it helped. you could do both of those one night then switch up from the tea tree stuff to the St. Ives stuff every other night (but still use both of them on the other nights.) if your skin gets too dry then leave it alone for a few days and use lotion.but so far that hasn't happened to me. also use a wash cloth or a shower scrubbie thing. dont use a soft bristle body brush it irritates your skin|`|xbISxnmfaa	If its not organic then no.

Also dont apply any moisturizers, sprays or perfume on the area you just shaved.  Dont get into tanning beds either.   It will give you a rash or red bumps.

392b18ae97259a7518f51868eb7ea463aa	Embrace it. That isn't to say that you have to love everything about your body. In fact, very few people love everything about their body. (Look at all the celebrities who go to extreme measures to change/perfect their appearance.) <br>  <br>  Don't be too hard on yourself. Just accept your body as it is. There are far too many important things in life than body hair.<br>  <br>  I don't mean to come down harsh, but if you care about your appearance to the point that you let your body hair interfere with the way that you live your life, then I sincerely feel bad for you. If this is the case, perhaps you need to think about the things in life that truly matter.<br>  <br>  Don't get too hung up on it, because like I said, there are far more important things in this life. Shave it, wax it, or leave it alone. If you are worried about it being a turn off for your significant other, then I guess that you need to find a person with a little more depth.<br>  <br>  I am also hairy, but I will be damned if I am going to let it steal my joy.|`|rpXZ9jVFaa	Ugh me too. I have really dark brown hair and it unfortunetely makes everywhere else dark too. Wax, it's so much easier and you don't have to do it like everyday. I use an epilator on my legs as I can use it more often than waxing, and wax everywhere else. Oh and I know some people remove arm hair but I just leave mine, seriously no one cares it's just arm hair. People look freaky without it lol. No one's ever said anything and guys don't care lol. Supposedly you can bleach it if it's that big of a problem but I don't think you can if you have sensitive skin, that's why I've never looked into it|`|sXSgijXnaa	I waxed my eyebrows, shave my legs, and well, embrace my arm hair, shave my pits, and well that's all!

Most likely, if you know somebody who lives in South Louisiana, they have at least made a simple Mardi Gras costume and you've probably envied this fact.<br>  <br>  Mardi Gras costumes are usually shiny and often contain he colors of Mardi Gras - green, purple, and gold (or a goldish looking yellow). They do no have to be as fancy as the costumes that Kings and Queens of "Krewes," groups that get together at the Mardi Gras season for<br>  parties and working on floats.<br>  <br>  In fact, there is a group known as the Mardi Gras Revelers. While their costumes are more complex than this costume is going to be, this is a simple way to dress as a Mardi Gras reveler. Your are going to need the following supplies to make this Mardi Gras Costume.<br>  <br>  1 White T-shirt<br>  <br>  Purple Fabric Paint<br>  <br>  Gold or Yellow Fabric Paint<br>  <br>  Green Fabric Paint<br>  <br>  Sponge Brushes<br>  <br>  White Keds-like tennis shoes<br>  <br>  A cheap child's umbrella or just a cheap umbrella such as from a dollar store<br>  <br>  A lot of gold, purple, and green sequins<br>  <br>  Gold, Purple, Green, and Silver glitter<br>  <br>  Hot glue gun (or E6000)<br>  <br>  A "zorro mask" of any color, which can probably be found at Michael's or Hobby Lobby<br>  <br>  Green, Yellow, and Purple fake feathers<br>  <br>  A T-shirt form<br>  <br>  First, do not plan on finishing this costume in just one day. Instead, give yourself at least three days if not a whole week to complete this Mardi Gras costume.<br>  <br>  Gather all the supplies needed and keep them in one area. First, wash the T-shirt to get all the sizing removed. Dry the shirt. Put the T-shirt on the T-shirt form. If you have ever been to south Louisiana, it is likely that you have seen or may even have a shirt that has one bold yellow stripe, one bold green stripe, and one bold purple stripe running around the entire shirt. If you do have one, you can skip this part of making the Mardi Gras costume.<br>  <br>  Take the sponge brushes and assign one to each color. Decide which color is going to be on the top, which is going to be in the middle, and which is going to be on the bottom. Then paint the stripes across the shirt using the sponge brushes. After the stripes are painted on the front, wash the brushes thoroughly. Let the front of the shirt dry for one day.|`|chnL0FqAaa	<a href="http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?catalog%5Fname=FOREVER21&category%5Fname=dress%5Fcasual&product%5Fid=2057409783&Page=2" rel="nofollow">http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  It is bold but it has all the mardi gras colors<br>  <br>  Dont be afraid to be a little out there....<br>  <br>  Wear really cute flats and go crazy with makeup....DONT FORGET MARDI GRAS BEADS|`|AA12381892	try a green or purple dress with lots of gold,purple,and green beads.or layering shirts with millions of beads would work.

OrKLpzenaa	I used Aveeno's Radiance Lotion, which says it moisturizes for 24 hours (which it actually does!) plus it has a subtle shimmer that makes your skin glow. It makes me feel so soft and smooth plus its noncomedogenic, meaning it doesn't clog pores, so it won't cause breakouts or blackheads. Any of Aveeno's lotion have these characteristics, but I like the glow of the Radiance Lotion, but you should choose whatever scent you prefer.<br>  Hope this helps!|`|kfvmQBbhaa	Different skin treatments work differently for different people ;-)<br>  But Vilantae has some downsides.

Dimethicone is a silicone based product that adds slip to conditioners as well as shine and luster, the downside is that many people experience breakage as well as produt bulidup and dryness from this ingredient.

The rest of the day, probably wont be that bad, but when you wake up the next morning you will be really sore and quiet uncomfortable.

BWfg2oLvaa	Well, given that you have oily skin, you will probably want to go with a powder base.  I personally use Everyday Minerals, as they have a very wide selection of shades (43 with the choice of matte, semi-matte, intensive, and original glo), from the lightest ivory, to mocha, to the darkest ebony.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!

5Y90tQwFaa	i'd wear a black cami with it, but i'd stay away from leggings unless you're 12 or under. otherwise, i'd opt for tights or bare legs. flat boots or flats would look really cute. if you're older, pumps would look great too. as for accessories, i'd probably stick to bangles and earrings. don't wear a necklace because the top of the dress is already busy. if you want a pop of color, i'd choose ONE place to do it: either a belt, a bangle, or shoes. other than that, i'd choose mostly black or silver accessories. overall, don't wear too many accessories. i wouldn't wear more than 3 extra things.<br>  depending on where you're wearing it to, the hair style could change. wearing your hair down, however, is cute and appropriate for pretty much anything.<br>  <br>  i'm not sure what your style is, but i'd personally wear it like this:<br>  <a href="http://www.wetseal.com/catalog/product.jsp?categoryId=104&subCategoryId=124&productId=17408" rel="nofollow">http://www.wetseal.com/catalog/product.j...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.wetseal.com/catalog/product.jsp?categoryId=109&subCategoryId=207&productId=17970" rel="nofollow">http://www.wetseal.com/catalog/product.j...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.wetseal.com/catalog/product.jsp?categoryId=106&subCategoryId=545&productId=16952" rel="nofollow">http://www.wetseal.com/catalog/product.j...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.wetseal.com/catalog/product.jsp?categoryId=106&subCategoryId=545&productId=17265" rel="nofollow">http://www.wetseal.com/catalog/product.j...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.wetseal.com/catalog/product.jsp?categoryId=109&subCategoryId=207&productId=17970" rel="nofollow">http://www.wetseal.com/catalog/product.j...</a>|`|Xqka9zzUaa	well im not sure what sort of occassion this is for so i dont know what you really want but you can try :<br>  <br>  wear this with ;<br>  white tanktop <br>  and white leggings or maybe even stockings if you're going for sexy ;<br>  pearly type jewlery..but thats more of a formal look ; idk.<br>  try wearing boots or flats would loook nice.|`|8pl3ShtBaa	The dress is very BOHO cute in fashion!

N7I1NT6Maa	I use bedhead "moisture maniac" in the shower, shampoo and conditioner, it helps with the frizz a bit, I think.  When I get out of the shower I use bed head "control freak" straightening serum and comb it through my hair, and then in the front of my hair where it tends to get realy frizzy I put a little bit of bumble and bumble grooming cream.  I just keep combing my hair while it dries, I don't bother blowing it straight cause whenever I try that my hair gets really poofy, but I don't have a defuser... If you want to blow your hair straight you should use a defuser.  Anyway, keep combing your hair while it dries and then just flat iron anything that didn't stay straight.  If I had to recommend just one product it'd be the "control freak" serum, though, it takes the frizz right out of my hair and gives it a nice shine!  Good luck!|`|RkIgHyRCaa	Please see: <a href="http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/straightening/secrets-to-safe-straightening" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreadin...</a>|`|22bef8b28219c364cd5a97ca5b5320edaa	wet to dry straightner.. put a heat protecting sreum in first.
83bG38iBaa	well i've tried braids and it leaves my hair crinkled and not the nice ones but a bun overnight adn mousse in the morning helps but i have complicated hair so here is a step by step of wat YOU can do:<br>  <br>  1 Wash your hair. Use shampoo and conditioner. Curls look nicer in clean hair. <br>  <br>  2Comb your hair and eliminate excess water by sqeezing it out or using a towel. <br>  <br>  3Keep your hair slightly damp. The curls will last longer this way. <br>  <br>  4Add a very small amount (about 1 tsp.) of conditioner to damp hair. This will help hold your hair in place while keeping it soft and shiny. <br>  <br>  5Comb your hair again to make sure the conditioner is spread evenly. <br>  <br>  6Now braid your hair. The size of the braid depends on the size of the curls you want. The bigger the braid, the less curly the hair. If you want very curly, almost frizzy, hair then make many small braids. If you want big curls, make 4-5 big braids. (more or less depending on the thickness of your hair) Experiment to find out what looks nice and what you like. It's a personal choice. <br>  <br>  7You can choose to blow-dry your hair or let it dry on its own. Either sleep with the braids in or untie them after 3-4 hours. DO NOT comb or brush your hair. This will eliminate the curls. <br>  <br>  <br>  Tips:<br>  <br>   If you choose to not leave the braids in overnight, blow dry them for a long time to make sure that your hair is completely dry. The outside of the braids may be dry but the inside may still be damp and as soon as you untie your braids, the curls will disappear because the water will weigh down your locks. <br>  <br>  For additional shine, add some shine serum before you do your braids and a tiny bit when you untie them. <br>  <br>  I find it better if you just play with your hair upside down *to add volume and add no creams or gels. It will make your hair look greasy not shiny which is always misunderstood.* let your hair dry that way*Braiding it is also good. You actually don't want to brush or comb your hair too much when its wet, it will be vulnerable to damage. You also want to avoid a hair dry or flat iron unless if you're in a rush, heat will also damage it.|`|Q27cXlGbaa	put your hair in a towel for about 15 minutes so its not totally wet when u do this.<br>  <br>  dont brush it, just pull your fingers thru it so its not notty.<br>  part it how u want it.<br>  spray hairspray in it & scrunch it.<br>  keep doint this till u cover ur whole head.<br>  u can also add moussse or gel depending on how hard it is 2 make your hair wavy.<br>  after it dries a little you hair will be wavy.<br>  <br>  i dont like braids bcuz it never looks right at the top of your head. <br>  i dont recommend braids, try scrunching it.|`|sXSgijXnaa	Wet hair causes hair-loss. Half-dry it first, then put two braids (loft and right) then put those two in a bun, sleep with it.<br>  <br>     In the morning take it out, finger through them so they look natural. Then yippee!|`|sYO70GJRaa	If you put your hair in braids, one or two does the trick. If you don't have thich hair, I'd recommend one braid for softer waves. If you put your hair in loads of braids then you will end up with a huge fuzzball (I've been there, trust me). You can even sleep overnight with the plait(s) and when you wake up, your hair will be dry and wavy. Finish it off with a shine serum (not stiff hairspray) to make the waves unbelievably soft and shiny. <br>  If you choose a bun, volumising mousse or gel works wonders. Put some in your hair while damp and then tie it up in the bun. Many buns would probably be a bit too much. You run the risk of ending up with fuzzy hair that might have really weird shaped ringlets in it (again, I've been there!). When you take down your hair, use hairspray to keep the shape of the waves, as well as the volume. <br>  <br>  You can also use large curlers (I know it sounds old-fashioned) and sleep with them overnight and in the morning, take them out and separate the curls with your fingers. DO NOT use a comb. If your hair comes out looking like Shirley Temple, dampen it with some water and then style using hairspray. <br>  <br>  Also, there are sea salt sprays that you can use in your hair while scrunching it to make it appear as though you have just been to the beach. <br>  <br>  Hope this is helpful :)|`|2V87n4PKaa	1. depends on how wavy you want them to be<br>  if you want small tight waves, put about 2 or 3<br>  if you want big ones, just 1<br>  <br>  2. that will make it curly, not wavy|`|N0U2Me9eaa	braid it for 2 days and overnight. then after let it open and then brush there u go.<br>  just one simple braid. u no with 3 different strands and then u overlap each one with eacher|`|p2605ETpaa	id say mousse it, then i think you should do 4-5 plates but not really tiny ones or youd end up with an afro quiet thick so its more curly than crimped, Or two buns cut down the middle one each side works a treat :)
