Vk5ePZHoaa	There are many possible causes of heart break, but I am assuming that what you are experiencing is of the romantic sort. <br>  <br>  I don't know the rules where you people are in, but where I am right now it is allowed to take an "emotional sickness" leave provided that your psychiatrist can produce documentation that you are not able to resume work in your condition. These are mostly approved for in cases of deaths and divorces. If documentation from a licensed physician cannot be acquired, a leave of absence due to other reasons may be approved by the employer... without pay, of course.<br>  If I were your employer, I'd let you take some time off from work... but I wouldn't pay ANYONE for heartache. It might start a trend among your co-workers, you know.|`|ZSAbJEv6aa	Unfortunately no or everyone who is not heartbroken will use that as an excuse to dilly-dally.  <br>  <br>  Think about it though.  There is one day to celebrate LOVE...I guess, there should also be a day allocated for someone who has just lost a love to wallow in self-pity or maybe, drink the whole day and drown in one's sorrow.  At least, it will give one a very good reason or excuse to drink heavily.<br>  <br>  If you badly need to take a leave because you are at the moment suffering the effects of a broken heart, no one has the right to stop you.  Go on, take a leave and be miserable.|`|NXBmcEz7aa	Take a sick leave.  Broken hearts are so painful you need some rest.<br>  Then came and see me.

You have at least 5years to go to get married and think about family.|`|27GRlGewaa	Tell her not to be ridiculous. Life is not a bollywood flick where you turn into a millionaire overnight. You are just 20 years old and yeah, it's next to impossible to own a house at such an age especially when one doesn't have a job. Ask her what value do you hold in her life? If she is serious for you, she'll wait until you settle down in a career. Boy don't be scared or anything, look at things practically and make her understand too that it's not at all practical what she wants.You have a great future ahead but everything takes time. I suggest you set your priorities in life. Love is fine but you have to be independent first and for that you need time.You are not spoiling her life, she has to be a bit more sensitive, understanding and practical and if she can't take a stand i.e for her love and she has set a time limit then I feel, you get the message loud and clear.She certainly can't take you for granted. Rich and poor fundas are all baseless and outdated. So ask her to give you some more time in case she really intends to spend her life with you.
lcj1AKt1aa	I do not believe that the Bahamas is a lesser economically developed country. This is a very popular destination. Its currency is strong and is pegged to the US dollar.<br>  <br>  Read this excerpt.<br>  The Bahamian dollar is pegged to the US dollar, and US notes and coins are used interchangeably with Bahamian currency for most practical purposes. However, government exchange controls still apply for the purchase of foreign currency.<br>  <br>  The Bahamas is classified as an upper middle-income developing country and has the third highest per capita income in the western hemisphere (after the United States and Canada). Tourism is the primary economic activity, accounting for about two thirds of the gross domestic product (GDP). Offshore finance is the second largest industry, accounting for about 15 per cent of GDP.

I think it is free or nearly so.<br>  If the other parent is not accompanying you it may be a good idea to have a notarized letter stating that they approve of the visit outside the country. <br>  Formula is expensive and sometimes hard to find in RP so you may want to bring your own.|`|999ecae3bd7991db2c05cbeac24ab665aa	Yes the child will need a visa and so will any other American Citizen who stays over 21 days, or something close to that.

ZSAbJEv6aa	Yes.  It goes with the formality of the dance like the waltz, the tango, the rumba etc.  There is grace in the movements as the ladies sway to the music but keeping their heads at the right angle which to us, the audience, imagine could give them stiff necks.  But notice how their heads move or turn in the other direction as their bodies move, too, in that direction.  They don't just keep their heads still in one position the whole time or in the duration of their dance.  That would certainly give them stiff neck.|`|TKHHRUB4aa	Unless you know the rules of ball room dancing the presumption such yours of colliding heads is inevitable however, the man is the one who leads the lady though it may seem that lady leads but in reality its the man.<br>  <br>  Most of the women who were dancing in the Star ball looks like gecko who were stiff or with little grace at all in dancing.|`|Kil7sZUSaa	Only if we're performing the dance of the ostrich!  hehehe|`|nmcK3J8xaa	They did that so you would notice them, ask about it here on YA! and expect some fool like me to answer the Q.. ^_-|`|oqiw8Ruuaa	that's what you call "the proper posture" in dancing.

What if there is a flood and the road washes away (as roads in the countryside have a tendency of doing)?<br>  <br>  The land you buy may be cheap but it may cost you a whole lot more in other ways.
i7oHTo9haa	Yes, I saw him too he was sporting a kaffiyah and walking around in the Strip like some movie star.  That man is vile. <br>  <br>  I'm going to have to see some more Western loyalty from the British and not so much coddling their extremists and I make my decisions based on much thought and I say it with deep sorrow and I do hope Britain populace pulls thru their mess.  I haven't seen anyone in Britain condemn him and I think alot of the Brits have venom against the West I know I've experienced a few venomous attacks myself by just being American.  I'd hate to experience it if they knew I was Jewish American. Gordon Brown signed an antisemitic document to support Jewish people and Israel that piece of paper isn't going to save the Queen when the British Embassy itself in Tel Aviv cancels business deals with Israel and disinvites our settlers in Judea to the Queen's birthday party.<br>  <br>  British Embassy<br>  "The British embassy in Tel Aviv has joined a wider European trend of boycotting Jewish towns in Judea and Samaria. Embassy officials announced Wednesday that they had canceled a planned relocation after discovering that the owner of their intended new office was involved in construction projects in Judea and Samaria.<br>  <br>  The intended new location was the Kirya tower in Tel Aviv, which is partly owned by Africa-Israel. The owner of Africa-Israel, Lev Levayev, also owns a subsidiary company that has built homes in Har Homa, Maaleh Adumim and Matityahu East."<br>  <br>  Britain Bans Israeli Citizens In Yesha from Embassy Functions<br>  <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/127109" rel="nofollow">http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/N...</a><br>  <br>  Your Majesty, You're Not Welcome<br>  <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/Articles/Article.aspx/8632" rel="nofollow">http://www.israelnationalnews.com/Articl...</a><br>  <br>  UK Embassy Joins Anti-Judea and Samaria Boycott<br>  <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/130268" rel="nofollow">http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/N...</a><br>  <br>  Gordon Brown Signs Declaration Against Antisemitism<br>  <a href="http://www.adl.org/PresRele/ASInt_13/5476_13.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.adl.org/PresRele/ASInt_13/547...</a><br>  <br>  As far as the Palestinians they have their own political representatives that want to destroy Israel that they overwhelmingly support and at least there is no false facade of their hate: <br>  <br>  "The most popular public figure among PA Arabs was neither Abbas nor Haniyeh, however.

Many of those same Zionist Jews who, in Germany, had worked with the Nazis, came to Israel and joined hands with the Zionist/Communist Jews from Poland and Russia.

7ZxdV2nNaa	my wife was studying at cae when i met her about five years ago. She was doing high school again part time and also uni psychology at the same time. she loved it and thought the other students were great.<br>  CAE is right in the centre of Melbourne CBD on Flinders Lane, if I remember correctly. It is about a minute walk to Flinders St train station, the main station in Melbourne. Flinders Lane has lots of cafes and the whole place is very nice. The building and facilities are modern and attractive.<br>  The school runs courses in everything  from art to psych and there is a big mix of students, like any school you could imagine. Mostly the students are young adults.<br>  I think it is a government school because CAE stands for Community Adult Education, but I'm not sure exactly where the funding comes from.<br>  Hope this helped.

cFdviXZZaa	Almost you can. Theres something called BIG BUS tour. you can book on the first day.it is a tour bus which takes tourists and goes to several shopping malls,museum and great land marks within a day. so after seeing these next day you can go to gold souk,park and beach in dubai,and come to dubai creek an go for a dew crew dinner.Taxis are not flexible and you will have to waste a lot of time if you depend on taxi to see malls and land marks.so better you book this BIG BUS before coming to dubai.For next day you can use the taxi if theres no other alternative.and don't stay in sajah hotels or try to visit sajah.specially week days you will have to waste time in traffic.so forget about seing saja.This way if you plan your holiday you can take the maximum benefit.so the third day you can use for dessert driving and other entertainments.but you will be tired when returning specially after dessert entertainments
e367a53b9596e107fb0d5120ff7a5777aa	The best answer I can give is go to the main banks in London and see if you can exchange some money before you get there. That way you have some "running money" when you hit the ground. Then go to the Bank of China when you get there to exchange since the rate is lower than it would be at a airport exchange place.<br>  <br>  If you have an ATM card that can be a very useful and easy way to exchange your money.

A decent 1 bed flat will cost you around ￡900 a month. A single bus journey is ￡2.  A bottle of beer is around ￡3.65 in a bar and a glass of wine around ￡5 for a large one.  You'll want to find work to support yourself while you are attending college.  I would make sure you have a place at the college before you move here as these courses are heavily oversubscribed.

Many foreign tourists lot lost quite big money by having to cancel their vacation to Thailand. Many had to stay in quite bad conditions whilst they waited to get home. They will not forget quickly.<br>  <br>  Also, problem with the airport was a big news story on TV in foreign countries because people want to know why their relatives had a problem with not being able to return from Thailand at the end of their vacation. It was liked they were trapped. So Thailand became pretty famous, even for people that had never been to Thailand, as having a problem for tourists.<br>  <br>  People can see that PAD has powerful friends. I think TAT will spend money this year to try to help Thailand's tourism reputation but maybe it won't be so easy. Reputation is like glass; it can break very easily.|`|hxHtUYI6aa	Sending my dad down this April.
Y47WgY4Laa	1) There are lots of stalls selling tutus in Camden - they're popular with young cybergoths and neon lovers at the moment. You can get them in all different colours and quite cheaply too. Check the market nearest the tube station.<br>  <br>  2) The Stables Market used to be stables years ago but now it's a huge market with a restaurant (Gilgamesh) in the middle. Sai Sai is always open at the weekend - it's near the food stands. (If you ask someone, they can point it out to you).<br>  <br>  3) It's not very crowded on Wednesdays as most tourists visit on the weekend.<br>  <br>  4) The shops on the high street will be open but some of the market stalls only open at the weekend. It's still worth going as there is still plenty to look at mid-week.<br>  <br>  Good luck and have fun!|`|IIC9e3JQaa	hiya<br>  <br>  i'd imagine that you'd be able to find a tutu in camden<br>  <br>  the stables market is a big market with many stalls inside; there are wooden horses, but no real ones! there are some market stalls in stable 'rooms'<br>  <br>  most places are open every day of the week; camden's always fairly busy, but certainly not as busy on a wednesday as at the weekend|`|vwtmkBGtaa	I'm Italian, but when I visited camden town I fall in love with Cyber dog!
nxHztcslaa	i spent a month there visiting family in november 2008... I won't lie, there was bad points yes.. dangers yes... BUT it was one of the best experiences of my life and i would go back there tommorow if i had the chance... its very different there and alot is still to be developed, electricity could be better for a start!! hehe... there is a few people that give the country a bad name, there is often robberies at night but things like that can be avoided by following the safety guidelines...overall i would tell someone to go there and experience it for themselves.. but be sensable and safe! email me if you would like any more information..|`|48846255239e6cfd4e8b805cbae9c844aa	you have got to be kidding, Nigeria is one of the worst spots on the planet, total anarchy, they would rape you and cut your head off, not necessarily in that order....|`|521pFYTtaa	i went there about 20 yrs ago for work with my boss. i was only there 4 days but i can honestly say it was the worst 4 days of my life, i didnt meat another white person in my time there apart from the people working for the company i was working for and the electricity was more off than on and it was stiflingly hot, smelly and dirty im not a prejudiced person i was married to an arab and lived many years in the middle east but i would be quite happy never to go to lagos at least ever again.went on a plane from lagos to enugu and it was a joke had to run across the tarmac to get a seat plane took off before everyone was seated and no one wore any seat belts. it wa s crazy.     good points...im trying to think of some.....leaving? no seriously there are some nice places in nigeria out of lagos im trying to think of the name of the hotel resort we went to that was owned by the company i worked for but its a major culture shock going there.|`|08ae3d05d7e2c113fc49e08dbdcfa338aa	I live 6 months out of the year in Nigeria in the north so it is really dusty and dirty.

2d43d909e1887779164c5f02f0f52b69aa	Assuming you perform successfully, 1 step every year up to step 4.  Once you're there, 2 years per step until you're a step 7.  Once there, 3 years per step, topping out at a step 10.  That goes for all the GS grades.    <br>  <br>  You could still get bonuses and quality step increases for performance if there's $ for those things.  A quality step increase (qsi) shortens the waiting period for a step increase.<br>  <br>  Try to remember that there's a world outside of the beltway.  Some people around here seem to forget that.  Best of luck with your new position.  I'm sure many people will be envious that you got a job in this economy.<br>  <br>  Dodge was correct about my original answer mentioning GS-7 instead of step 7, so it's corrected above.  Thanks Dodge.|`|AA10310155	Stuck has it basically right (except he meant Step 7 instead of GS-7)<br>  <br>  Step 1, 2, 3:  One year<br>  <br>  Step 4, 5, 6: Two years<br>  <br>  Step 7 - 10: Three years<br>  <br>  See here for verification:  <a href="http://www.opm.gov/oca/pay/HTML/wgifact.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.opm.gov/oca/pay/HTML/wgifact....</a>
EHw8zCgJaa	A pool party eh. I know a place in Novaliches called "remedios resort"- not too much people there when me and my clique came for a pool party, they also permit you to drink booze in the premises.<br>  <br>  Too bad that the place doesn't have a website I can link to.  :(|`|4b644d3e9fa1328649e31b2870d579ccaa	So, you want a pool party.  If you are familiar with the Don Antonio Subdivision right in front of the Ever-Gotesco along Commonwealth Avenue, simply take a tricycle by the gasoline station and tell the driver to drop you at the private pool.  As you take a ride, you will turn left and then turn right.  In front of the Mini-Shop or Mini-Stop, there is the place with a swimming pool.  I forgot its name but the pool is good for more than 20 persons.<br>  HAPPY BIRTHDAY IN ADVANCE :)

AA10662056	180cm woman is too tall in Japan, frankly.<br>  <br>  Average height in Japan is 5'7 for men and 5'3 for women. There is hardly a woman with 5'11.<br>  <br>  I think it's hard for you to find cloths.|`|dc6b4bfdb75c28be32d965d3d43e476daa	You will stick out, but probably less so than a Japanese girl of the same height, as people sort of take it for granted that a foreigner may be different from them.<br>  <br>  The clothes and shoes your size exist, but are very hard to find.  Forget about bra; anything bigger than cup C is not cute, and I've never seen G in a store.  I think it's best to bring everything from your home country.|`|EMeAw7Bcaa	a giraffe, you'll be one head taller than most of the people, i am sure every where you go people will stare at you....clothing and bra, you have to bring your own, if not you'll have to custom made it|`|LWtz8cGsaa	Tall|`|USaK4A7Oaa	You will stick out, but it might not be as bad as you expect.  You will be taller than most people, but in many people's eyes you'll just be another tall foreigner; whether 5'9" or 6'1" doesn't really make a difference.<br>  You can buy men's shoes at that size (US size 10 is the *maximum* size in most stores) and other men's clothes that will fit you, but for women's clothes you'll probably have to find a "big & tall" store, or use internet shopping.

ZSAbJEv6aa	Up to a certain age.  Minors should be under the care and the responsibility of parents while grown children should be responsible for themselves and held accountable for any wrongdoing.  Maybe the parents of the children who robbed your aunt's house should be put in jail instead, to teach them how to be responsible.<br>  <br>  Who knows they could have encouraged their children to steal?  We have often heard of stories of parents prodding their children to steal for the family, to beg in the streets or do things that are contrary to law and morality.|`|EHw8zCgJaa	of course, since only adults should have legal liability<br>  <br>  also, consider the actions of the children, do they have any known psychological disorders such as kleptomania or schizophrenia that may have motivated them to commit theft. The last thing that these children need is a childhood memory of their first jail time- Imagine having to apply in an entry-level job with a tainted record at the age of nineteen or twenty. They need counseling and their parents should be held liable since they're just kids and shouldn't be blamed for their actions. <br>  <br>  Anyways, those robbery syndicates really know how to circumvent the law, maybe next time they'll be manipulating retards (I mean the "mentally challenged", if the term hurts anyone) to do their dirty means of living.|`|Nn4To7XKaa	You cannot put minor on jail but on boys home by reporting this case to the DSWD. Also, you could ask for an assistance of the DSWD officials to warn if not penalized those irresponsible parents.|`|c790c0f3ca4b5ca33ae20dba3a6be536aa	Yes, very much.  I hate parents who cannot discipline their children, thus becoming nuisance to the society.|`|a1fq8ZHBaa	partly, I mean yes parents should disipline there children<br>  <br>  <br>  But the kids should be part way responsible for there own actions|`|4b644d3e9fa1328649e31b2870d579ccaa	They can be put under the care of the Social Welfare.

9NpXU7D2aa	i don't think 5 is too young. <br>  i've been going all my life and i've always loved going. <br>  mickey mouse is NOT 6ft tall. in fact all cast members that play mickey must be between 4ft 8inches and 5ft 2inches. so mickey is most likely quite a bit shorter than you. <br>  <br>  she can go on most of the rides.  <br>  these are the rides with height requirements:<br>  space mountain: 44 inches<br>  splash mountain: 40 inches<br>  thunder mountain: 40 inches<br>  stitch's great escape: 40 inches<br>  tower of terror: 40 inches<br>  rock n roller coaster: 48 inches<br>  test track: 40 inches<br>  mission space: 44 inches<br>  soarin: 40 inches<br>  expedition everest: 44 inches<br>  dinosaur: 40 inches<br>  star tours: 40 inches<br>  <br>  believe me there are tons and tons of rides that don't have height requirements. she's not going to miss out on all the fun.<br>  <br>  personally i think 5 and 11 are great ages to take your kids. <br>  but if you and your husband decide to wait 2 years thats fine too cuz the kids will still love it.|`|T8ksKCWCaa	I think 5 is a perfect age to go and enjoy the park. Your oldest may be too old to fully enjoy everything next year.|`|5LxpvXSmaa	No it is not to young. It is ideal for someone of her age and if she isn't big enough to go on some of the rides then you start saving and planning for a return trip when she is older. People who are young of heart never grow old for WDW so the multiple times you go - if you can- just reinforces your love to the overall experience.|`|6Nmly1wmaa	I just came back from the MK we went with an 8 year old and a 2 year old. We DIDN'T like it there at all. the lines are way long,alls you do all day is wait in line and dodge strollers... I HIGHLY recommend busch gardens for a 5 year old or kids of any ages for that matter. It was so nice there a lot of kid friendly rides,animals, and so much more....DO NOT and I repeat DO NOT Promise your kids they will see mickey mouse because we didn't see him once at the MK and we were looking for him. Please take my advise as I didn't listen to anyone and we had a really bad time at the MK!   Good luck!|`|0WASp0bHaa	13 is a great age for Disney. And 7 would get her on more rides.<br>  This is a very expensive trip. I would wait till you know she will enjoy it too. I took our daughter when she was 6.

She didn't last the day at the parks, and was just as happy back at the resort with dad and the pool.<br>  <br>  I took my daughter again when she was 15, we had a blast. I really think the older they are the more fun Disney is.|`|AA11349881	No thats ok|`|Mwhclezaaa	She will be too small for some things but I went with my 3 year old sister and there was loads for her to do!  They really cater for all ages and the place is huge- you could spend a week there and not do it all.  You have to queue up for Mickey's autograph, but you can just walk up to the others and they are not scarey!  Donald duck was all of 4ft tall when I went there!  It blows any UK theme park out the water.|`|sF13O9Fmaa	No way! 5 is a great age, everything is so magical to them at that age. We are also from the Uk and we go every year, I have been taking my kids since they were under 2, there is lots for them to do at that age, if she likes dressing up with make up etc I would recommend a trip to the bibbidi bobbidi boutique in Cinderellas Castle (book in advance), I took my 2 girls last year aged 4 and 5 and they loved it, they keep asking if they can do it again this year.<br>  <br>  I would recommend www.orlandovillas-florida.com for a luxury 4 bed and 3 bath villa with a private pool, it is the best villa I have been to and Ive been going for 17 years.<br>  <br>  Have fun, Im going back in June and cant wait!|`|WwShkVufaa	Hi<br>  I am 11(nearly 12) and i went in October.

Personally, my favorite age for kids at Disney is around 3 years old; it seems that was always the best age for all three of my kids.  At three years to about 5 years, they are still little enough to truly believe and more than old enough to understand what is going on.  <br>  <br>  I’ve noticed my kids start to outgrow (temporarily) certain aspects of Disney World by age 7.  They still have a great trip, they just don’t enjoy certain things.  It is my opinion, that at the latest age a child should go to Disney for the first time is age 5.  <br>  Really and truly, there is very little they can’t go on.  The majority of rides have no height requirements.  Of those that do, it is mostly 40”.  My younger two aren’t tall and they hit 40” by 3 to 3 ? .  <br>  <br>  Five is NOT too young.

YbOGOnroaa	So stupid! Everything is wrong in our countries education system. We need to be learning more than is currently taught. Science and math should definitely be in english and whats the difference if it's taught in English or Malay, the papers are still bilingual! <br>  <br>  Another thing which really needs to be reviewed is the History syllabus.

dZj2Llslaa	1) An oppressive form of segregation.<br>  2) I was 11 in '94, so no I didn't contribute to it.<br>  3) My parents and grandparents benefited from it, so my head start in life I could plausibly be attributed to it. However, the end result is that due to the uneven system of apartheid, the changes that are now happening to correct it have meant that I cannot find work in present day South Africa.<br>  <br>  I currently work in the UK. Am I a traitor for leaving? I don't think so. I am doing whatever I must to support my wife and I. Do I think apartheid was wrong? Of course I do. It was an abomination of human rights and should have never started in the first place. However the current practices (AA and BEE) are not helping matters. I agree that the policies need to be there, its just the way that they are being implemented.|`|mRulboA7aa	1) racial segregation to the benefit of whites<br>  2) I was in Grade1 when it ended, so I did not contribute.<br>  3) The racial issues we face today was because of what the old people did and it negatively influences me.  I hate all things racist but is still forced to see it.  I have to listen to my white acquaintances make racist remarks and think their being cute.  I have to lie to my parents when I fall in love with a non-white person.  I have to forgo my chances of marrying him.  I have to listen to people like the guy above make tedious comments on how terrible and unjust BEE is even though he is sitting snugly in a job and (I can guarantee this:) not one of his white friends or family members are without a decent job plus where they work, you can be 90% certain their boss and his boss is white.|`|G1hQZuaiaa	1.

I probably did benefit, my parents were most likely given opportunities they might otherwise not have had which gave them good jobs and they were able to send me to university.<br>  <br>  All the ANC did was reverse the process to benefit blacks with BEE and AA (affirmative action). Blacks are now doing exactly what the whites did back then.<br>  <br>  So let me ask you, (1) What do you understand by it? (BEE & AA) (2) How do you think you are currently contributing? (3) How u think u DONT benefit from the system?|`|zEoRcL91aa	I lived during last years of the regime and was around 13 years old when it ended.

Does your wallet allow for a night at Motel 6, a round-the-world tour, or something in between? Figure out how much you have to spend beforehand, and perhaps count on some wedding-gift money to add to your stake.<br>  <br>  2. Discuss your idea of the perfect vacation. Who likes sports? Who likes sun? Who wants to explore an exotic destination? Make a list of the things that mean the most to you, and compare notes. Marriage is going to call for lots of compromise, and this is the place to start.<br>  <br>  3. Pick your destination. If you're on a budget, keep in mind that many places adjust their rates seasonally. For instance, it's cheaper to visit the Caribbean in warm weather, and ski resorts that offer a lot of activities (but no snow) in summer will also be less expensive.<br>  <br>  4. Use a travel agent. It doesn't cost any more, and he or she can make all the arrangements without you having to worry about them.<br>  <br>  5. If you're going abroad, leave plenty of time to make sure your passport is current, you have the visas needed. If inoculations are required, get them well before the wedding.<br>  <br>  6. When you make reservations, let them know you're honeymooning. People will want to please you (in the hope that you'll return). You may get upgraded to a better room at no charge, receive a welcome bottle of champagne, and who knows what else.<br>  <br>  7. Protect your privacy. This is especially important if you have a destination wedding, where the guests tend to hang around. A honeymoon is for the two of you, period. No kids, no pets, no company.<br>  <br>  8. Take more money than you think you'll need. (To make things uncomplicated, you may want to pre-pay for everything, or select a resort that offers an "all-inclusive" rate, which usually covers food, lodging, activities, drinks, transfers, tips, and more.)<br>  <br>  9. Schedule time to do nothing at all. While it's great to know you have plenty of options in terms of things to see and do, this is, after all, a honeymoon.<br>  <br>  10. Be considerate of your spouse's wishes. (My husband made me add this one.)|`|iN27E3WCaa	If you can afford it, I highly recommend Tahiti.

JLayHNZCaa	We like Daytona Beach area because for a small fee you can drive and park on the beach.  It is watched very closely so it is not dangerous.  You can rent a golf cart to drive on the beach and your three year old would probably enjoy sitting on your lap "driving" the golf cart ;o)    The beach is very family friendly there, and the water is beautiful.

f2ff10ee1f165a8a13d3f1a2286c4d98aa	There are not many jobs in the VI, especially St. Croix. The only real jobs down there are working in the oil refinery, the hospital, or part-time jobs or physical labor. I imagine they could use alot of cops though, I remember alot of police departments when I was on the islands. You can try being a social worker through the St. Croix Women's Coalition or a school social worker, other then that I don't think you will have too much luck. Good luck.|`|SeJ1Hnfraa	The Virgin Islands has a unique work/cost of living scenario; cost of living is high, averaging 33% higher then other US jurisdictions however the average salary is less then most other US jurisdictions.<br>  Although a large service sector in the U.S.V.I supports the islands number one industry – tourism, there are other employment possibilities in government, health, law, journalism, education and other private industries. There are generally jobs of all types available; teachers, nurses, doctors, secretaries, paralegals, accountants, professors, chefs, managers. Some professions, in particular nursing and teaching, are in constant demand so jobs in these fields are often available and can be pursued from home.<br>  Tourism is the basis for the islands' economy. Job possibilities include sales, tours, bartending, wait staff, mates on sail boats and charters, hotel and resort staff, beach attendants and water sports attendants. Many of these jobs are fairly easy to find during season (high season is mid-November to mid-May) although they can also be found during the rest of the year as visitors continue visiting just in a lower volume. Often times managers and owners want the applicants for these jobs to be on island. Phone inquires might be responded to with, "Ok contact us when you get on island"; however you can still try this approach so at least you have some contacts to follow up with when you arrive on island. It is a good idea to come down with an idea of where you want to work, what businesses and then visit them as soon as you are on island. There are lots of hotels and resorts and restaurants particularly on St. Thomas and St. Croix. Jobs can potentially be secured from home by contacting the potential employer with inquires and faxing of resumes, getting copies of the newspapers and applying for jobs from the classifieds and some people have had luck with submitting to resume web sites. You might want to try a combination of methods

nuuwAq6eaa	considering the basics like the cost of your rent, food and other basic necessities it is hard but not impossible to live in thailand with only 10,000 baht. Unless you plan on living there like a poor man then 10,000 baht is enough. <br>  <br>  you will have to eat street food though.. since the hotel and restaurant food would cost around 200+ baht. You also can't go out a lot since it will cost you. Though food in thailand is cheap, the services and souvenir shops aren't (at least for a 10k baht budget).<br>  <br>  i placed some links here so you can know what to expect.|`|5e6836dfa778c1efeee10f87746767f4aa	i think is ok and enought but 15K baht is better|`|YPHaQ1asaa	If your Thai and don't mind sharing a place with three or four others, You can make it.

cMZEmpp0aa	It depends on what you want to do with it. If you eat nothing but really cheap food, get around on foot, don't buy many (or any) souvenirs, and focus on sight-seeing in free or cheap places you should be okay, and even have some left over. But if you wind up having a hard time finding cheap food, if you want to buy souvenirs, and if you want to go into a more expensive place to sight-see, money is going to be tight and it might not even be enough. I'm assuming that this money is in addition to your hotel, because if you need to pay for a hotel out of this it's really not going to be enough, even if you stay in a cheap hostel. I think you would be much better off either taking this amount of money for a shorter trip, or making sure you have access to more money than this. You don't even have to withdraw or exchange a lot of money right away, just have access to more than $620 and get it as you need it.|`|WrDGhduxaa	That is not enough to do much.<br>  Your food will take up most of the money so you will not have any left for transportation and tours.<br>  That would only be about $62 U.S. per day and there are few places a tourist can survive on that amount.|`|AA10662056	If accommodation is excluded, 62K yen is enough.

AJXyQa17aa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  Perth is great for 2 categories of people - those with young kids wanting to settle down, and also for those who are retired!

fQfLRv9taa	Hello Anja!!!<br>  <br>  I was born in Irkutsk but I did live many years in Vladivostok.<br>  I may tell you this, Siberia can be much different than Western European Russia. Of course a lot of Russia has changed over the years but Moscow has so become very as they say "cosmopolitan" "metropolitan". I believe there are culture change and difference between such places as Moscow and St. Petersburg when comparing Siberian cities.<br>  <br>  I like to think I am a polite person and am not rude however I am much more keep to myself even more so than Moscow native.....I may seem a cold to strangers<br>  <br>  Moscow and St. Petersburg are just so different from somewhere like Vladivistok, much difficult to explain though. Sorry.<br>  <br>  May you provide example of Siberian friend behaviour? That possibly could help me to understand and give thoughtful reply.<br>  <br>  Perhaps they are just rude people in general. I do not know. A lot of my friend who were Moscow natives have mentioned that Siberians are  a tough crowd so to say and are not as friendly at first meet.<br>  <br>  I think it lies more in the fact that Siberian cities are not as cultured and sophisticated as Moscow and St. Petersburg. Those cities have been influenced much by Western world.<br>  <br>  Not that it is a bad thing ; but Siberia is still a little detached compared to those places yes?

6GcDA7zLaa	It is best to look at the restrictions and requirements and then compare the costs.  Very often it can be cheaper to do a round the world fare if you have the time and the flights go where you want.  Usually the airlines require that once you start your journey (either eastbound or westbound) that you continue traveling in that direction.  They also have a minimum time and a minimum number of trips.  On several occasions, I have found the round the world fare less expensive.|`|fx5FihM0aa	It's not necessarily cheaper.

Well, it is a fact, like it or not|`|8kIE1Dswaa	The usual cocktails are Cuba Libre (sometimes called a Mentirita !), Mojito, Daiquiri.<br>  <br>  The main beers are Cristal and Buccanero, both brewed by a joint venture with Interbrew.|`|HziXc5Ovaa	Cristal beer is Cuban beer. It's light but very nice. Mojitos are the best there. Orgasmo, Sangria, Margarita, Bellini, etc. They make great Bahama Mamas and so many more.<br>  <br>  Honestly, tell the bartender or waiter/ess to surprise you with something great and trust me, they'll treat you to some awesome drinks.<br>  <br>  Non-alcoholic: cappuccinos there are the best, cafe con leche (Cuban coffee with hot milk....yum).|`|fIrDIUjjaa	Pi?a Colada<br>   (Spanish, pineapple: pi?a, pineapple + colada, strained) is a sweet, rum-based cocktail made with light rum, coconut cream, and pineapple juice, usually served either blended or shaken with ice. It may be garnished with a pineapple wedge or a maraschino cherry. The pi?a colada is known as the official beverage of Puerto Rico. There you go, we get it alot here in Spain.|`|Vj68NlYFaa	Cuban beer is alright cristal, buchanero.  , Mojitos Miami vice must try Be careful of the ice in the drinks as it could be made with regular water which can make you sick if your not used to their water.If your going to varadero at the end of march maybe Ill see you there.|`|22vhNiy7aa	havana special, blue lagoon, bahama moma, chocolate monkey, sanfransisco, mojito, the best beer is crystal.  there natural fruit juices are also very good|`|xwWSN8j2aa	Mojito<br>  <br>  Sugar<br>  Fresh Mint<br>  Freshly Squeezed lime juice.<br>  Rum<br>  Sprite
x71k4UQYaa	that's a social mask they're wearing<br>  <br>  they pretend to be "friendly" to everyone<br>  but  very intonation of those words signify how insincere they are<br>  <br>  so this is a 'theatre-play' they carry on the stage<br>  <br>  don't try to understand it dude,  just go with the tide|`|xOJL5fPgaa	That "-cim" means "my dear. That is why she call her dear friends with -cim after their names.<br>  Nam?k Kemal was very famous poet, and definitly not a racist. If one of your Turkish lover disappointed you, try another one and a pick a new nickname.|`|rEELErf5aa	because it is fun.|`|aA33fL4Oaa	asli is right|`|AA10604976	It is an attempt at friendly intimacy. There's no name called lider. Lider means leader. And it is better than saying, "Lan Aris!"|`|AA11854330	lol it is something girlish which shows your love to them.<br>  I hate it anyway.
AA11589437	Very interesting.<br>  Of course throughout the Byzantine Empire the area of Greece was called Greece (Hellas in Greek), it was just the ciitizens of teh Empire that called themselves officially Romans, in order to prove the legitimacy of their state as a continuation of the Roman Empire.|`|AA10604976	Byzantium was a city state. The empire was the Roman Empire, which, for European political reasons, was named the Byzantium Empire by some dumb German.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Roman_Empire" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Rom...</a><br>  <br>  If calling you Yunan (Ion) is wrong, then what does it signify that a Viking tribe comes, meets a Greek tribe and writes it in rune letters? I am trying to honor Greek belief and call the old culture the Hellene culture, but no. You people have to prove I don't know what by showing runes and stuff. How about this: Europeans called all Muslim Ottomans "Turk", when Ottomans consisted of much more than that. What does this mean, that all Ottomans are actually Turkic? Please!<br>  <br>  By Greeks' own admission Greek was the name of a tribe and not the name of a whole cultural area. Why are people trying to attribute nationalism to a period in which there was no nationalism, but just tribes and clans and cities. You behave as if the Hellene culture was like an oasis in a desert, but cultures don't appear out of the blue, they evolve from other, older cultures. Your alphabet derived from the Phoenician alphabet, doesn't this mean anything to you about your culture?<br>  <br>  What's wrong with being a part of all humanity? Why do Greeks feel the need to believe they are "older, better, more beautiful" than their counterparts?<br>  <br>  PS. I don't remember what I said about Ankara, just that it has a history dating 9000 years back. The runes related to Turkic tribes are the Orhun runes.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orkhon_script" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orkhon_scri...</a><br>  <br>  Runes were used all through Asia and Northern Europe. If you look at Finnish runes, you will see that the letters are similar, but phonetics aren't.<br>  <br>  The letters used in Anatolian cultures were cuneiform, not runes.|`|LMo8HaA2aa	Ah Vasiliki! This is one of the times you find my ignorant!<br>  I know about Runic inscripts being a specific form of inscriptions, developed from the Roman Alphabet, and belonging to the Teutons. <br>  So, they mention about Greece, as early as 1100! <br>  <br>  On these runestones the word Grikkland (Greece) appears in three inscriptions,[1] the word Grikk(j)ar (i.e. Greeks) appears in 25 inscriptions,[2] two stones refer to men as grikkfari ("traveller to Greece")[3] and one stone refers to Grikkhafnir ("Greek harbours").<br>  <br>  Aha! So. Griechenland was the name even then (by Germans).|`|xtKEToLHaa	Min Tous, I loved your answer...It's very informative and interesting...Thumb up...<br>  <br>  ps@Min Tous, let's be friends again, just like in the good ol'days...What do you think? ;)))|`|jP612sbsaa	You read my mind. That was going to be one of my next questions if you didn't ask it. Those Vikings were considering the Empire of Constantinople as Greece. The Vikings were sea men, travelers, warriors and  explorers and they knew what they were talking about. Unlike the barbarian hordes of the East who were naming "rum" all the Christians under them (because they were too stupid to tell the difference between a Greek and an Armenian) and they come now to claim that Greek people never existed in the middle ages because we were all "Romans" living in the Eastern Roman Empire.<br>  <br>  -> cpinatsi I would like to make a comment on your answer: Greek people were not living only in the thema of Hellas:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Map_Byzantine_Empire_1045.svg" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Map_By...</a><br>  Also those Vikings and the Varangians were mostly living in the thema of Thracia and the city of Constantinople. That was what the Vikings called Greece.<br>  <br>  -> if the turks are proud of that alphabet because those people were altaic then the Greeks can be proud of every achievment by the indo europeans because our language is indo european also.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo_european" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo_europe...</a><br>  of course we are not proud of everything indoeuropean because that would have been pathetic but then again, when it comes to pathetic, a turk could have never know the difference.|`|JTXbVZEkaa	There was an Eastern Roman Empire! What are these Runestones? They say Greece? We Turks, know you better than Scandinavians! Don't believe them! Our archives confirm that you didn't exist before 1800! You jumped out of nowhere with the help of European countries. They were so much jealous of us.|`|YU471WSsaa	Yes i knew..i have read about them in some relegious text.... but it is intresting how a truley barbaric blood thirsty society, althougth very devout ideginous pagan belivers changed thier belifs to christandom. now whether the orthodox or the roma catholic  had the influnce it dosent matter ,but to find runic inspritions in agia shopia and athens shows that..they frequent these areas most and obviouslly took back with them this new relegion.this is how the RUSK..(russians) where introduced to the orthodox relegion.actually the rusks debated for along time which relegion to adapted i mean they even had the muslim relegion in thier views.. they say that they liked the muslim relegion..and favoured it but when they chose the orthodox relegion they gave thier reasons as it was angleic and nearest to good when litrugy was heard and the fact that the rusk loved a drink..now here is the intrestign thing around the same time rusk adapted the new relegion..the slaves made thier migration towards south eatern europe. settleing in what is todays region of serbia. ,the other intresting thing is that these slaves where die hard pagans..in fact paganisim was strong in the serb region till the emergenc of christianity to, these people by apostalics such as cosmas and theomanous. in shorter words the slaves where expelled from rusks lands for not compleing with the new relgion the rusks adapted..and brigning with them the pagan belifs to have convererted after thier migration after 500 years when they origanly migrated around 900 ad. and till this day there are regions with in the balkan regions that still have remants of pagan belifes tied into thier chrsitian beleifs.... another  intrestign thing is that BLUNT   a while back showed me some links to pictures of a huge stone carvings  that is just outside ankara, the carvings look very similar to runic letters which amazed me..unfortantlly because  my second drive in not installed as yet..i cant get tot hat pic ,to show you perhaps if blunt reads this she may give you the link to that pic..|`|Mkb0wTjAaa	I didn't know that you always bring interensting stuff.

toLCaFc9aa	You don't have to worry about the things your are going to do in Cuba. Since you are a tourist you are (in your case) queen there.<br>  They will praise you and you will feel in paradise.<br>  You will think 'Man communism rocks!'<br>  It may rock for you, but it sucks big time for us.<br>  So the paradise that you see there is like going to Magic Kingdom in Disney and seeing the castle, it is not real.|`|8kIE1Dswaa	Dance<br>  <br>  Listen to Music<br>  <br>  Sing<br>  <br>  Play dominoes|`|d2QVB6Qyaa	There is plenty to do. It depends where you go what you can do. There are resorts , beaches, Havana is great...you just walk everywhere visiting old historic houses, museums etc and watching the people. Trinidad is a lovely old town, and near some good beaches. Vinales is a rural area and different to the other places. We did a tour on the way which was good - you went to a cigar factory,  the paintings on the rocks etc.<br>  <br>  Go to <a href="http://www.fascinating-travel-destinations.com/information-on-cuba.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fascinating-travel-destinatio...</a>|`|ABdZDjjcaa	You can watch el Morro in the harbor, have a rum<br>  <br>  Teya, you are right. <br>  How sad.

When I was little I used to live there it was awesome. There's also Santiago city which is pretty nice. There are museums and theaters that are cool, but overall the beach is the main attraction for tourists which is near Matanzas city.<br>  <br>  Hope you have fun!!|`|vy8GFLf8aa	When you tip in US or Canadian coins or Euros, these coins cannot be cashed in.  It is like tipping $oo.oo.  Even as a Canadian I could not cash in Canadian coins in Cuba.  Their banks will ONLY accept paper bills. The Cuban servers and bellboys have jars of useless euros and loonies in their homes. If you want to do something kind for a Cuban person, offer a $20 bill for $20 in coins to return to your country. The bills can be exchanged in Cuba, the coins cannot.  Take a bag full of coins home.<br>  As soon as you can when you arrive, change your money and ask for lots of pesos to give as tips and put your own coins away.  Also...bring lots of cash or you pay big $$ to transfer from Visa into Cuban convertible pesos.  No bank cards. Cash is a less costly exchange. <br>   If you can connect with a Cuban with a driver's license, rent a car and have him take you where the tourists don't go.  OH MY GOSH!!!  The absolute most amazing time for us was handing out pens, pencils, books, pencil crayons, facecloths, deodorant, toothbrushes and toothpaste.  These things are SO NEEDED AND APPRECIATED. Your driver will interpret and people will invite you into their homes. They are so so nice.  Giving gifts was the most amazing experience.  I felt absolutely honoured that these people shared a bit of their lives with us.  You will find good, good, kind, trustworthy, people.<br>   The bank is very small and operated by only one or two people.|`|Vj68NlYFaa	There are lots of things to do beaches night clubs on and off resorts.

If you like museums you can spend the whole day in the Smithsonian museums specially the Natural History Museum, the air & Space and the Gallery of art, of course these are so big that you will need more than one day in order to see them, the best thing is that there is no entrance fee.<br>  <br>  If you like outdoors then I’ll choose a walk through the monuments in the Mall, including the Washington Memorial, The Lincoln memorial, Korea Memorial, perhaps visit the White House & Capitol and have a nice view of the city from the top of the Old Post Pavilion then head towards the Arlington Cemetery.  Your options are unlimited in DC there is much more to do and see besides the monuments and museums but in my opinion if this is your first time in DC I’ll go for the monuments.|`|SsB7aRExaa	Go for the monuments.

ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	I would allow 2.5-3.5 hours, depending on traffic and time of day. <br>  <br>  Crossing the border in a car takes no time at all. They just wave you through. HOWEVER, you have to buy special Mexican insurance, since US insurance is not valid in Mexico. And unlike the US, if y ou have an accident in Mexico and have no insurance, you go to JAIL (Do not pass Go, do not collect $200). And the drive back across can easily exceed 3 hours, due to security.<br>  <br>  Alternatives include parking at San Ysidro (a suburb of San Diego) and walking across. Beware of unscrupulous taxi drivers who have no qualms about taking advantage of females. If you go in a taxi, don't go alone, and negotiate the fare BEFOREHAND. Or better yet, just walk. It's only about 1/2 mile. Walking back to the US is much faster than driving, only about 30 minutes last time I did it.<br>  <br>  Other alternatives include parking in San Diego and taking the Red Trolley, which stops about 10 feet from the border. Or even taking Amtrak to San Diego, then taking the trolley.<br>  <br>  However, I would not, could not go to northern Mexico at this time. There has been too much violence over control of the drug trade. Americans are being kidnapped and killed. Back in the day, it was safe to go at least as fare as Rosarito or Ensenada. Now those days are gone.

eCjx7kLAaa	I'd suggest something modern, as a hotel.  Or a campground that is a piece of land somehow not used in the battle.  Although Gettysburg is famous for its ghosts, many people visit there and never see anything, even if they're looking for this sort of thing.  Any of the old inns, the battlefields, the college, or the old center of town are known for hauntings, but it's really hit or miss.
oCErBpWjaa	I don't think that your father's past experiences will have any relevance to yours if you were to come to Guam. To tell you honestly, people on Guam are very receiving to everyone of a different culture. In every culture, of course, you have teens who are just closed off or too proud of themselves to except others who they think may be better than themselves--this is normal. Don't be alarmed by it, I'm sure you've experienced worse someplace else. Guam is no place to be scared of. My best advice to you is just be open to others and welcoming as well. People from Guam usually act hostile to foreigners who are ignorant of them in the first place. We get a lot of "haolies" who think they are better than us and that's what gets them in trouble. Locals and outsiders get along very well, they just need to be themselves, be friendly, smile, and don't criticize others as well.<br>  <br>  Guam is known for its wide range of mixed cultures, from Americans to Japanese to Filipinos and Blacks. You won't feel like an outsider and if you're open enough at school, you're sure to make some great friends! You definitely won't be wasting your time.|`|I08iONdaaa	Hmm, that's a tough one. If your father truly did get some flack for being white, you might get some for being mixed. do you speak the language? I think native cultures tend to be more accepting of people who already share some of their culture (like language). <br>  <br>  I know how you feel. In my experience, being half Chinese, most of the full Chinese people I meet tend to say I'm not "really" Chinese. I'm just something "other" to them. That's all crap of course, I'm as Chinese as I choose to be. My best advice though would be to learn the language and get in touch with whatever parts of your native culture interest you. You might not be accepted as a native, but I"m sure they would respect an honest effort to learn about the blood you share with other Guamanians. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|t4F59gf2aa	Guamaniac?

kZvJlrcAaa	yes|`|Em0Nf6Fpaa	It depends on what you're looking for. <br>  <br>  I take it that you mean an international school, as local schools do not offer the IB programme. Unless it's an 'independent' school like ACS International where there's a larger proportion of Singaporean students though the fees are comparable to an international school.<br>  <br>  I don't think the experience would be much different from a high school in a large, cosmopolitan American city, where there's a greater mix of nationalities/ethnicities. I find that the social lives of  international school students are somewhat self-contained and distanced from local children. Which can be both a good and bad thing. Certainly if you're only going to be here for one short year – apart from living away from your parents presumably, which I guess could be a huge plus for you - it'd probably be like an extended... sleepover or holiday. With nothing all that strange or new except for a few more ethnic public holidays. That you may feel you'd never really left wherever it is you're coming from.
M1oVSlZdaa	Think about the great deeds of Mordechai and his cousin Esther. Especially Esther. The courage to go up to Achashverosh.<br>  <br>  That is the kind of courage we need right now,my friend. To stand up to the world and the terrorists.<br>  <br>  <br>  Has fear ever paralyzed you, made you afraid to make a critical decision because of possible or probable serious consequences?<br>  <br>  It has been said that courage is not the absence of fear; it is the mastery of it. The Bible, however, adds an important element to the definition of courage: trust and faith in God. Moses told the ancient Israelites not to fear the other nations when they crossed over the Jordan River into the promised land, because God was with them and would not forsake them (Deuteronomy 31:6).<br>  <br>  How can you have this kind of faith? How can you step out and confidently make decisions that will affect the course of your physical-and maybe even your spiritual-life?<br>  From an orphan to a queen<br>  <br>  For the answer, consider the example of a Jewish girl from ancient Persia.<br>  <br>  In the third year of his reign, Ahasuerus, king of the Medes and Persians, searched for a new queen from among the beautiful virgins in his kingdom. She was to replace Queen Vashti. Vashti had humiliated her husband in front of many people including all his officials. She had refused to allow him to display her beauty before everyone at his special feast (Esther 1:10-22).<br>  <br>  Esther, a young orphan, was among the women the king ordered brought to the palace for special pampering and preparation for the king's scrutiny as possible royal replacements. Her cousin, Mordecai, had reared her. Mordecai was a Jewish servant "in the king's gate" (Esther 2:19), which implied that he held a position in the king's court. Following her cousin's advice, Esther did not reveal her ethnic identity. After the king chose her as queen, she maintained her contact with her cousin (Esther 2).<br>  Plot to wipe out a race<br>  <br>  Sometime later Ahasuerus appointed Haman, a man prominent in the kingdom, to a special office over his princes. Ahasuerus commanded that each servant should bow down to Haman, paying him homage. Mordecai refused.<br>  <br>  Haman was enraged by Mordecai's actions. But he wasn't satisfied just to seek revenge on one man; he devised a scheme to destroy all the Jews in the kingdom. He approached the king and informed him that the Jews did not keep the king's laws. He convinced Ahasuerus to issue a decree saying 10,000 talents of silver would go to anyone who would destroy the Jews (Esther 3).<br>  <br>  In ancient Persia, when the king made a decree and sealed it with his signet ring, it was not to be revoked or amended. Ahasuerus's decree went out, resulting in great mourning and fasting among the Jews throughout the land. Clothed in sackcloth and ashes of mourning, Mordecai sat in the square near the king's gate. When Esther learned of Mordecai's circumstance, she told her maids to take garments to clothe him and to take away his sackcloth. But Mordecai would not accept them.<br>  <br>  Esther then sent Hathach, one of the king's eunuchs who attended her, to find out what was wrong with Mordecai. Mordecai told him all that had happened and gave him a copy of the written decree to show to Esther. He also told him to tell her to go to the king and plead for her people.<br>  <br>  Esther had not seen the king for 30 days. The king enforced a law that anyone who came into the inner court to approach him whom he had not specifically called was to die. However, the king could make an exception by holding out his golden scepter, thereby sparing the person. So Esther sent the eunuch back to Mordecai with the message that she could not enter the court to see the king.<br>  <br>  Mordecai answered that, if she did nothing, she risked death along with all her countrymen in the kingdom. He also asked a piercing question: What if God had elevated Esther to her position as queen for the specific purpose of helping save her people at this critical time? (Esther 4:13-14).<br>  Esther's dilemma<br>  <br>  What a decision for such a young woman! Death seemed certain regardless of what she decided. Vashti had been only banished from her position as queen. Esther might actually be killed!<br>  <br>  She had to answer Mordecai. What would she do? She must have prayed and agonized over her decision. Tension and anxiety must have consumed her. She was sickened with fear for herself and her people.<br>  <br>  She must have asked herself a hundred times would God really let her die if she refused to help the Jews? She was so young. Surely God did not want her to die. On the other hand, could she stand silently by and watch heartless Haman annihilate her people? Why couldn't her dilemma just go away like a bad dream?<br>  <br>  In the midst of her turmoil, Esther realized she could not allow fear to paralyze her into inaction; that in itself would be a decision. Instead, she left the outcome with God. It was clear she had only one real choice.<br>  <br>  Even in giving Mordecai her answer, Esther knew she did not have the courage within herself to face Ahasuerus. But she did know where to go for the courage she lacked: to God in fasting and prayer. Placing her life in God's hands, she let Him decide the outcome for her and her people.<br>  <br>  She sent word to Mordecai requesting that he ask their fellow Jews to fast for her for three days and nights. She and her maids would do likewise. Then she promised to go before the king, knowing full well she was risking her life (Esther 4:16).<br>  <br>  You can read the remainder of the book of Esther to see what happened. The king did extend his golden scepter, and he spared Esther's life. After several special banquets for the king and Haman, Esther finally revealed Haman's plot and made known her request for her people. The king ordered Haman hanged on the very gallows he had prepared for Mordecai's execution.<br>  <br>  The king issued a new decree: The Jews were free to defend themselves and destroy anyone who would assault them. He promoted Mordecai, and the Jews were saved. To this day, many Jews observe the Feast of Purim in honor of this event.<br>  What can we learn?<br>  <br>  Sometimes fear is our normal human reaction when we are faced with a seemingly impossible decision. Acknowledging our lack of courage is the first step to overcoming it. But we must not allow fear to paralyze us into taking no action at all.<br>  <br>  You must realize that you need help and that you cannot go it alone. Recognize that God is all powerful, that He has promised never to leave you or forsake you (Hebrews 13:5). Go to Him in prayer and fasting to seek His will in making the right decision. Then confidently make your decision, with the courage and conviction that God is on your side.<br>  <br>  Perhaps a fitting conclusion to this story of godly courage can come from the words on a memorial in Westminster Abbey. Inscribed on the monument to Lord Lawrence are these words: "He feared man so little because he feared God so much."<br>  <br>  Baruch Haba|`|lCW3Worpaa	More ways to exterminate the Palestinians?

A range of supporting documentation will also be required.<br>  <br>  As is often the case with visa and immigration services, both costs and processing times are subject to change and may vary considerably according to the nationality of the applicant and the type of entry clearance being sought.<br>  <br>  Although a same day processing service is available at a premium, the standard processing time is ten working days. However, once again this may be subject to change depending upon the nationally of the candidate and the type of clearance required.<br>  <br>  In addition, nationals of some countries need to have their application 'referred'. This means that before issuing a tourist visa the Egyptian Consulate in London needs to get approval from the authorities in Cairo.|`|JNRMeXgnaa	come to Egypt and enjoy to see pyramids only|`|Qp0GqKtraa	speak to ur local mp|`|hhhk499qaa	I think that you don't need a visa to work!! thats not common sense.

583bec62c31ff3614efe2e94bb70dfbbaa	I spent some time touring the north of Italy, from Torino, down to San Remo, along the coast to Pisa, then to Firenze, down to Roma, back up the coast to Firenze, along to Bologna, down to Rimini, a quick stay in San Marino, up to Venezia, along to Milano, and back to Torino. I have skied in Sestriere and Maddona di Campligio, and been to the Imola and Monza Grand Prix, so I know it fairly well.<br>  <br>  Oh and I have watched AC Milan v Inter Milan at the san serio stadium.<br>  <br>  Oh and I have been in hospital in Sestriere, Mestre and Firenze with a dislocated shoulder. I first dislocated it skiing in Sestriere, it fell out in Mestre when i was showing David Beckham how to take penalities, and a bouncher kindly twisted it out, when escorting me from a night club in Firenze.<br>  <br>  I also visit Mestre quite a lot, to visit a photographer friend you lets me use his studio.<br>  <br>  It is a much more people friendly country than the UK and US, and most of the Italians are friendly and helpfull even though I 'non parla benne Italiano'. <br>  <br>  Italians take great pride in their appereance, and seem fun loving and to enjoy life. They same very laid back, except when they are behind the steering wheel of a car, or at a football match, when they are very passionate or mad.<br>  <br>  Unfortunatley the salaries are s**t, or I would be there right now.|`|8WRqyvJhaa	Sicilia- from Palermo to Catania and all in between<br>  Roma<br>  Amalfi Coast-Positano, Amalfi, Sorrento, etc...

The Italians were nice...Loved to go out to disco's, pubs, liked walking around the centro socializing...I liked it.<br>  <br>  Main fault?  When you have to pay the "attendant" to park...I hated that. You could park "illegally" and pay the "attendant" and NOT get a ticket...but park LEGALLY and should your parking stub expire- you get a ticket...interesting...ahhah..|`|fd09ea41f86382847375794c6ab36318aa	I'm Italian and I think we are less corrupt by the progress than other countries.<br>  We are a country of poets, inventors, artists and navigators ( like a famous song says ) but not only this.<br>  We are great although our abilities are not exploited and although the government give us too few opportunities to have the job we have studied for.<br>  Anyway I love us :-)<br>  <br>  Redhead27, every country has its problems, specially in this period.

As Canadians in our early 20s, who didn't speak Italian, we found that Italians were kind of rude to us, especially in the restaurants. We felt bad that we didn't know the language, and can imagine that that would be annoying to Italians.|`|u8Wgi7R1aa	Haha I have been to Italy many times! Trust me you will truely fall in love with it the moment you arrive. A flaw that it does have is its not quite as clean as say Switzerland or Germany. But it is so beautiful. I practically love over there and actually am heading over there this summer. <br>  I have been to,  Venice, Rome, Florence, Lake Como, Serento, Sienna, Naples, Piza.

I know alot of Italians, some from the north and most are from Rome in this country, though more and more are coming from Naples.<br>  <br>  Italians are prideful, they are passionate and happy people for the most part.  Some are stuck in old traditional values, some are not and are more adapt to the times.  Meaning, some are still very machismo so to say and some understand this country is all about equality... some are racist also, but there are those that aren't as well.  <br>  <br>  their main fault... hmmm... I'd have to say too much pride in their country, when to be honest... their country isn't that great, otherwise there wouldn't be so many of them immigrating to the US.  Honestly, Italy may be beautiful but they have a lot of problems politically (corruption), economically (poor), and socially (racist against the gypsies) .... so where all this pride comes from... not really sure.|`|rvTcDJ6yaa	Yes<br>  Verona<br>  Venice<br>  Sienna<br>  Montepulciano<br>  Rome<br>  Pompeii<br>  Florence<br>  Pisa<br>  Lucca<br>  Bologna<br>  Trieste<br>  <br>  Main Fault????

28708e44a74e534c3bc9c9ad362c928aaa	Depends on the job you are going for I suppose. I own a couple of small companies and I would chose a candidate who has traveled over one who has not any time. Travel gives you a greater understanding of your place in the world and a better tolerance of other cultures. Your whole life experience is relevant when applying for jobs, I see too many resumes that are just I have these qualifications, my duties were this. I want to know about the people I employ, the sort of person they are is just as important as their academic qualifications, they have to fit in and work as a team otherwise they are just another piece of office equipment.|`|56qTOSIoaa	If some travel involved communicating in the bilingual languages, it might be relevant- if not, don't put it on.|`|Plu6OVoGaa	Does that have anything to do with your qualifications? If it does, then include it.|`|lys5kB9Daa	I agree with gitface, companies want to know that this person is worldly and has some life experiences.<br>  I have traveled to 4 continents and over 20 countries and I have this on the bottom of my resume. Put a section called "Activities/Interests" and have something else on the list as well. For example mine says- <br>  Student organizations in college- Women in Business, Finance Club<br>  Soccer- play on a recreational team<br>  Travel- been to 4 continents and 20 countries<br>  <br>  It may not exactly pertain to the job or my job experience, but I still think it gives me an edge over someone with the exact same qualifications than me.<br>  Just like getting into college, they always say you need all these extracurriculars to show you are well rounded, well same applies here.|`|1hciyvKdaa	No its not relavant. Your travels are not your accomplishments.|`|kgBPU4xxaa	If you lived and/or worked somewhere where you needed to use language skills, then the experience would be relevant and you could include it. Just traveling to different places doesn't necessarily imply any language skills. Unless you're courses include something about the culture and history, the travels would not add a lot to the resumè in that case.|`|P77aCOvAaa	If you used the language in your travels, this could be a plus on your resume.

RufGmQYLaa	Completely possible.<br>  Having done it, I must say that it is completely worth it!  But it is expensive and a little complicated. But if you are a teacher, you should be able to handle it. :-) <br>  <br>  First, go to the UK Homeoffice website: <br>  <a href="http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/</a><br>  Sadly the scheme I used to work there is no longer offered, but you should look into tier 1 visas (Highly skilled) and if that won't suit, then tier 2 (skilled). As a teacher, you probably have a good shot. Visas can be dependent upon you filling a need in the UK workforce. You are awarded points based on your career, education, finances, age, etc. (There is a worksheet on the site to determine if yo meet the minimum 75 points) Look at the points scheme and see where you fall or will fall after you graduate.  <br>  If your university has some kind of reciprocal arrangement with the UK, that is the best and easiest way to get sponsored. You may need an employer to sponsor you. <br>  <br>  Another option is to do a year abroad IN SCHOOL. Then you can line up sponsors and so on and also get points credit for UK experience. <br>  <br>  Fair warning - you are looking at several thousand dollars in visa fees, plus needing to have cash reserves when you make the jump over the pond (they require almost 3000 pounds to prove yo won't be a drain on the system) And the visa process can take up to a year.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|wvPDo4gXaa	advice from one of your own, we need good teachers here in the states

00ad97897648101cc10f52e12966697daa	Lucky you, the snow has been great this year.  Provided there is not an actual storm while you are driving, you should not need 4wd.  They are good about keeping the roads plowed.  You might want chains though, just in case.  Enjoy the snow!!!|`|AA10160993	Coming from Reno to South Lake Tahoe, you should avoid the Mt Rose Highway that has a 9,000 foot elevation mountain pass (unless you want a scenic drive - it usually only adds a half hour to your drive).  You'll take 395 to Carson City (the capital of Nevada) and then take 50 to South Lake Tahoe.  There aren't any big mountain passes along this route, so unless there's a significant storm, you "should" be ok.  It's a pretty easy drive at night except for 50 from Carson City for about 20 miles - it's a divided four lane highway (two lanes each direction) with a couple of tight turns.  You should be fine though.|`|rS2gbhgoaa	Nope. I was just there this weekend, and the roads are fine. Conditions were amazing.
AA11937736	That depends on what you count.<br>  <br>  The 12th is the largest at 16.324 km2 but that includes the Bois de Vincennes.

3dd9b9254af3e1e8337b453e24b6d48faa	It really depends on your location.<br>  The Northern coast will always be warm due to its proximity to the Equatorial line.<br>  The Central and Southern coast will be cool and maybe cloudy. The temperatures will never drop below 40 F but the high levels of humidity in the air may give you the feeling that it is colder.<br>  <br>  The mountains will be nice and sunny (Usually the raining season starts on December and ends around March). Due to the height and the lower air density, you'll basically get warm if you stand under the sunlight and cold as soon as you step in a shade.<br>  <br>  The rainforest also gets nice since the raining season is also over. The temperature will probably be aroung 90 degrees Farenheit (day and night).|`|w4sL6EuFaa	I went to Peru and Ecuador last June and I wouldn't say it's cold. Granted, I didn't go all the way South, I just went to like Lima and Cuzco. But in the North it depends on your altitude. When in Mancora (very, very northern beach town) I went swimming, surfing, and played soccer all day. It was warm, and it got a bit chilly at night, but I wouldn't say it got over 90* fareighneit. When I went to Huaraz (maybe a bit more north than the middle, but it's inland) it was definitely cold at night, but I was comfortable in just a shirt and jeans during the day. Huaraz has a relatively high elevation. Cuzco was about the same as Huaraz. And in Lima I was a bit warm in jeans and a shirt during the day, but was very confortable at night.<br>  <br>  So... it depends?|`|93605640549ad2ca62b57b8fa5e3a478aa	well is winter but the temperature its no like here that goes under 0 the temperature is around 45 to 50 in the cost but if you go to the mountains or to the south of the country the temperature gets colder but not that bad like here

Sometimes you even need a heater at home. Summers are beautiful though. Bermudians could be rather dark or light skinned.

The nearest landmass is Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, about 1030 kilometres (640 mi) west-northwest. It is the oldest and most populous remaining British overseas territory, settled by England a century before the Acts of Union created the United Kingdom of Great Britain. Bermuda's first capital, St. George's, was settled in 1612 and is the oldest continuously inhabited English town in the Americas.<br>  <br>  Although commonly referred to in the singular, the territory consists of approximately 138 islands, with a total area of 53.3 square kilometres (20.6 sq mi). !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|V3dS4STjaa	bermuda is a small island in the atlantic ocean.

Plus, nothing beats seeing Shamu.  :)|`|AA10855383	I've never been to Florida Aquarium but i would say Sea World, because they have rides there, too, not just marine animals. 2 roller coasters, a log-flume type ride that ends as a roller caster and other things....).|`|UE1evlTlaa	The Aquarium in Tampa is GREAT! BUT....nothing beats getting up close and personal with the animals at SeaWorld!<br>  <br>  Where else in the world can you see a giant killer whale up close, sharks, penguins, manatees, dolphins, beluga whales, walruses, and more all in one place! SeaWorld definitely has more variety and excitement when it comes to the animals. Also, they have GREAT shows for the entire family that you cannot see anywhere else. Plus, I believe right now SeaWorld is doing a buy one day get the second day free. So, you can get two days out of Orlando, if you are willing to do the drive back. It really is a good deal. This is where I got that deal.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!

However, you must apply for a re-entry visa before you leave Vietnam. If you do not have a re-entry visa, you will have to go through the whole Vietnamese visa nonsense again. Re-entry visas are easiest to arrange in Hanoi or HCMC, but you will almost certainly have to ask a travel agent to do the paperwork for you. Travel agents charge about US$25 for this service and can complete the procedure in a day or two.

AA10740352	I have been on more than 20 cruises, many with RC,  and so my stories would take up more space than Answers allows for responses.  So in short, I have enjoyed all of my cruises.  I have done many 7 day cruises and also several 14 and 15 day cruises; just did a 15 day to Hawaii and back and also a 14 day Australia/New Zealand cruise.<br>  <br>  When you pay your cruise fare all taxes and port charges are included in that fare. Once you get on the ship everything is cashless. The price of your cruise includes your cabin, all meals (including breakfast, lunch dinner, snacks and free room service), free admissions to all shows and entertainment, and free use of all facilities on ship except spa services. The things that you will have to pay for are:<br>  <br>  GRATUITIES: They will amount to between $10  and $11.50 per person in your cabin per day; depending upon the cruise line.   When you get your cruise documents the gratuity amounts will be shown, or you can ask when you book your cruise.   <br>  <br>  ALCOHOLIC DRINKS AND SOFT DRINKS: Coffee, tea, milk, juice, and lemonade and punch will be provided FREE but you must pay for soft drinks and alcoholic beverages and they will add a 15 percent gratuity to each drink and soft drink order. Drinks of cruise ships are generally in the range of $7 to $9 including the 15 percent gratuity that is included in each tab. Beer and wine are slightly less, maybe $6 to $7. The cruise line does sell a soft drink card that allow you unlimited soft drinks for the duration of your cruise. These you must buy the first day of the cruise and they generally cost about $6.00 a day for adults. The cost of the soft drink card also goes on your on-board tab.<br>  <br>  PHOTOGRAPHS: Cruise ship employees will take plenty of photographs of you all over the ship, in the dining room, and as you exit the ship in ports. These will cost a lot, like $15 to $25 for most and the cost of them goes on your on-board tab. You can save yourself a lot of money by taking your own photos and asking other passengers to take photos of you; they generally always will.<br>  <br>  TOURS/EXCURSIONS: You are not required to book any tours and can get off and on in the ports as much as you want. But the cruise line will offer a lot of tours and these are expensive.<br>  <br>  SOUVENIRS: The shops on ships are usually very expensive, selling a lot of jewelry and high end clothes, and on certain days they have sales when they reduce the prices of some of the lesser priced items like caps, "T" shirts, watches and other jewelry.  But in general you will usually get a better deal in stores at port stops.  Anything you buy on ship from a gift shop or duty free shop goes on your on board account. <br>  <br>  CASINO: If you plan to gamble on ship you will need cash for that.<br>  <br>  OTHER:  Most cruise ships have a few restaurants where there is a fee to eat called  "specialty" restaurants.  There is generally a gratuity/service charge of between $10 and $20.   All other food on board is free and its not really necessary to budget for food; you cannot eat all of the FREE FOOD that will be available (so why pay to go eat).<br>  <br>  SPA SERVICES: If you want/need to have your hair done, get a massage or wrap, or any services from the spa, you will have to pay for them. Spa fees start at about $70 to $80 and they go on your on-board tab if you use the spa services. You can use the gym free but the spa stuff cost big bucks.<br>  <br>  INTERNET SVCS: Ships now have internet cafe and some have WiFi but the there is a fee for internet access and it is very expensive (like about $50 an hour). Skip the high priced internet and ship and wait for port stops where you can usually find an internet cafe where the charges are about $5. to $7 an hour. Just ask the cabin steward and/or your wait staff where the internet is at the port. They know because they use them when they can get off the ship.<br>  <br>  ROOM SERVICE/MINI-BAR: You cabin will likely have a minibar with soft drinks and munchies; you have to pay for anything you take out of the mini-bar. But the room service (24/7) is always free. However, you should tip the person who brings your order at least a couple dollars, more if you order a full meal for several people.|`|Mlf7Kss4aa	the virginity thing is just gross. these are people from all over. no telling what kind of diseases these cats got. please don't do it.

Yes yes, people will say its great, but no, its AWESOME.  You wont be able to feel it until you are really there.  I went at night to have dinner on the 85th floor, and the view was breathtaking.  Its a bit expensive...but its definitely worth it (: You may want to make reservations tho.<br>  2.Museums- if you're interested in history, you can take a look at the National Palace Museum.  They showcase different things regularly; its not THAT fun, but educational.<br>  3. Night Life- You may want to go around the night markets, notably the Shilin Night Market. They have basically everything there.  And...it only opens after 6. Great atmosphere, but you may have some trouble if you dont know mandarin.  On the other hand, the food there is amazing ;). Also, theres a lovers bridge in Danshui's harbour that you can miss!  Go at night.  Its a pedestrian bridge and the scene is a beauty.<br>  4.  If you're going in the summer/ sometime warm, and you have kids, you can try the waterpark called Formosa Fun Park.<br>  5.  Wanna go somewhere hip?  Try Ximending.  Its kinda like a big mall/square that has a lot of stores and where all the young people hang out at.  And...a lot of taiwanese celebrities hold mini concerts and stuff there.  Another place is the east-district shopping area.  LOTS of good shopping you can do there.  Its around the taipei 101 area.<br>  <br>  Theres not a lot of places I can recommend you NOT to go, cuz everywhere in taipei is pretty amazing. (:  Just...dont wander aimlessly at night by yourself...its pretty creepy, unless you're in a huge crowd.<br>  <br>  Hm...one more recommendation. If you've got some spare days in taiwan, you should visit Hualien.  The beaches there are CLEAR BLUE period.  Pristine, beautiful, extraordinary, beaches. (:  Thats all I gotta say..<br>  Hope you have lotsa fun in Taiwan!|`|pqxuHVRLaa	I  would like to be your tour-guide. <br>  You get a tour-guide,and I get the chance to speak English,both benefits to us,isn't it?<br>  <br>  If you don't mind,you can lived at my home,like homestay.<br>  My mom is a hakka people,so she can cook some traditional dishes.you should try it!<br>  <br>  when you plan to visit Taiwan?

5JqCObDSaa	I know this may not be the popular answer, but what came to my mind - especially since you have been praying, is that maybe God has him there for a reason. It reminds me of the song that states He may not come when WE want him, but He will be there right on time...He's an on time God - Yes He is.<br>  The only other thought I have and I often get this thought because we don't seem to do enough of it, and that is "some things only come by fasting and prayer", so I guess I would ask if anyone has tried to seek God about this with fasting and prayer and if not it is certainly worth a try, so we can maybe hear from God as the spirit is strengthened with an open ear to hear what the Spirit is saying regarding this situation...wether it is a strong hold or like earlier mentioned,  God has a purpose for him there.<br>  Let me know if I can be of any help if we can get a group together to fast and pray this situation through.

gXJdryRNaa	Carry your medication on you or your carry-on to ensure that your RX makes it onboard with you.<br>  <br>  Make sure it is in it's original container with the name of the doctor, pharmacy, dosage and patient information clearly legible.<br>  <br>  I travel quite a bit and I always also take a written copy of the prescription with me in case I lose the meds.  Most doctors will be able to refill if need be in a developed country.  <br>  <br>  Same holds true for eye glasses and hearing aids as well.  Take a copy of the prescription of your glasses in case yours get lost.  Or carry a back-up pair.  For hearing aids, don't forget extra batteries as those can be hard to find in foreign countries and even on ships.|`|AA10740352	You should ALWAYS pack all of your medications, both prescription and over the counter, in your carry-on bag.  You do not want to take a chance of the airline losing it in transit.   Normally when you board ship it can be 3 or 4 hours before your luggage gets to your cabin.  Its usually there by dinner time but if you need a pain or any other med before then you will want to have it available rather than in your luggage. <br>  <br>   When you board the airplane and the ship you will place your carry-on on a scanner belt for inspection.  I travel with my meds in a pill box that has a separate compartment for each day and so I may have 6 or 7 pills in the compartment for each day, depending on how long I travel.  You should have absolutely no problem getting through security for the airline or the ship.|`|djZQXxmhaa	I would carry them on.  I always travel with dramammine and advil and my prescription medications because you never knwo what can happen with your luggage.

I always pack a change of clothes in a carry on with my medication.|`|EoEjbKpzaa	I would keep them with you just in case. Sometimes when the cruise line takes your luggage you don't get your suitcases till late at night. If that's not a problem for you just put them in your luggage.

What if your luggage gets lost?|`|AA12199774	I have been to the Bahamas several times on cruise ships and I always carry on my medication. It is no big deal as log as they are legal prescriptions. I put nothing like that in my luggage because the luggage can get misplaced and you are stuck with no medication... Just my thoughts..|`|X6rFPI2laa	Medicines should be carried with you, not packed in luggage, which can be delayed or lost!  They should also be in original containers with the pharmacy labels.  I happen to have to take a fistful of stuff twice every day, and my pharmacy is always very accommodating in printing a second set of stick-on labels for me.  I put pills for a trip, plus an extra week's worth, into zip-top sandwich baggies, one bag per prescription, stick the labels on the bags, and put all 8 little sandwich bags into one larger plastic bag, which goes into the bottom of my purse.  I happen to find those little plastic pill boxes handy, so I put a couple of empty ones in my suitcase and parse out the pills when I get on board.  I have never had a problem with carrying medicines that way, but have seen airport security get really intense when they see travelers with unlabeled pills!

It was ruled alternately by Rome, by Islamic and Christian crusaders, by the Ottoman Empire, and briefly by the British after World War I. The British agreed to restore at least part of the land to the Jewish people as their homeland. There was no language known as Palestinian. There was no distinct Palestinian culture. There has never been a Palestine governed by the Palestinians. Palestinians are Arabs, indistinguishable from Jordanians (another recent invention), Syrians, Lebanese, Iraqis, etc." <br>  These authoritative, honest statements are by Arabs, Jordanians and Palestinians, and absolutely must be taken at their face value and word. <br>  All right, so you're not quite into quotes. How about these tasteful tidbits of historical facts? <br>  <br>  * Jews, not Arabs, have lived continuously in the ancient Biblical Promised Land of Israel, especially Judea and Samaria, for 3,700 years. This land was given as a gift by G-d to the Children of Israel (Hebrews, Israelites, Jews) and is so stated in all of the three monotheistic religions' holy books - Old Testament, New Testament and Quran. Faithful followers of Judaism, Christianity and Islam all believe in the same one G-d and therefore must believe the word of their G-d. G-d does not make and break his promises. There is a very valuable lesson to be learned by all his children and faithful followers. <br>  * The current queen of Jordan is an Arab 'Palestinian'. <br>  <br>  * Approximately half of Jordan's prime ministers since 1950 have been Arab 'Palestinians'. <br>  <br>  * More than 2/3 of the Jordanian people are Arab 'Palestinians'. <br>  <br>  * The majority of citizens residing in the capital of Amman are Arab 'Palestinians'. <br>  <br>  * Arab 'Palestinians' constitute not less than one half of the members of the armed forces, according to the late King Hussein, as broadcast on Amman Radio February 3, 1973. <br>  <br>  * The majority of other security forces are Arab 'Palestinians'. <br>  <br>  * Jordan occupies 77% of the original Palestine Mandate (originally promised to the Jewish people). The population density of Jordan is less than 61 people per square mile leaving lots of room to absorb many more of their brethren and cousins.|`|bMJ0AYI1aa	threats of unending violence, huh? you people are SO civilized.

The Western Wall in the Old City — the last remaining wall of the ancient Jewish Temple, the holiest site in Judaism — is the object of Jewish veneration and the focus of Jewish prayer. Three times a day, for thousands of years, Jews have prayed "To Jerusalem, thy city, shall we return with joy," and have repeated the Psalmist's oath: "If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning."<br>  <br>  Jerusalem "has known only two periods of true greatness, and these have been separated by 2,000 years. Greatness has only happened under Jewish rule," Leon and Jill Uris wrote in Jerusalem. "This is so because the Jews have loved her the most, and have remained constant in that love throughout the centuries of their dispersion....It is the longest, deepest love affair in history.<br>  <br>  With regards to your absurd idea that Israel must hand over East Jerusalem, Before 1865, the entire population of Jerusalem lived behind the Old City walls (what today would be considered part of the eastern part of the city). Later, the city began to expand beyond the walls because of population growth, and both Jews and Arabs began to build in new areas of the city.<br>  <br>  By the time of partition, a thriving Jewish community was living in the eastern part of Jerusalem, an area that included the Jewish Quarter of the Old City. This area of the city also contains many sites of importance to the Jewish religion, including the City of David, the Temple Mount and the Western Wall. In addition, major institutions like Hebrew University and the original Hadassah Hospital are on Mount Scopus — in eastern Jerusalem.<br>  <br>  The only time that the eastern part of Jerusalem was exclusively Arab was between 1949 and 1967, and that was because Jordan occupied the area and forcibly expelled all the Jews.|`|i7oHTo9haa	Jerusalem is the eternal capital of Israel.<br>  <br>  Who Has a Right to Jerusalem (Interview Shocker)<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBvPx75FLYs&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBvPx75FL...</a><br>  <br>  Palestine?

I do not reward terrorism and their demands for a separate state because they have issues and violently demand it. ASSIMILATE or move.<br>  <br>  "The Palestinian people does not exist. The creation of a Palestinian state is only a means for continuing our struggle against the state of Israel for our Arab unity. In reality today there is no difference between Jordanians, Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese. Only for political and tactical reasons do we speak today about the existence of a Palestinian people, since Arab national interests demand that we posit the existence of a distinct "Palestinian people" to oppose Zionism. For tactical reasons, Jordan, which is a sovereign state with defined borders, cannot raise claims to Haifa and Jaffa. While as a Palestinian, I can undoubtedly demand Haifa, Jaffa, Beer-Sheva and Jerusalem.

UIJorsD7aa	Jerusalem was NEVER a capital of an Arab country or province!<br>  <br>  In the Jewish Bible, Jerusalem has many names: Salem (Shalem), Moriah, Jebuse (Yevuse), Jerusalem (Yerushalayim), and Zion (Tziyon). The most common term for the city, Yerushalayim, is mentioned 349 times in the Jewish Bible, while Tziyon is mentioned an additional 108 times.<br>  <br>  The early history of Jerusalem is also rooted in the Bible. In addition to the events already mentioned, the Book of Joshua (ch. 10)describes how Adoni-Tzedek, the Canaanite king of Jerusalem, wages war against the Jews.<br>  <br>  During the approximately 400-year period from the entrance of the Jewish people into the land, through the period of the Judges, Jerusalem remained a non-Jewish city. It was not until the reign of King David (ca. 1,000 BCE) that Jerusalem was captured from the Canaanites (2-Samuel 5) and converted into the political/spiritual capital of the Jewish people. (Archaeologists agree that the original Canaanite city and the City of David was located in what is now the Arab village of Silwan, a few meters south of the "modern" walls of the Old City.)<br>  <br>  Although the Temple hasn't stood for almost 2,000 years, Jerusalem continues to be the focus of the Jewish world. The Temple may not be there, but Jews believe that the intrinsic holiness of the site always remains. Jewish tradition also maintains that in the End of Days, during the Messianic Era, a third and final Temple will be built on Mount Moriah.<br>  <br>  It is often erroneously stated that the holiest site in the world to Jews is the Western Wall. This is incorrect. The holiest spot for Jews is Mount Moriah itself, behind the Wall. The Western Wall is merely a small section of Herod's massive retaining wall and has significance only as it relates to the Temple Mount itself. <br>  <br>  So why do Jews pray at the Wall? Since the destruction of the Temple, the Sages decreed that due to the sanctity of the site, Jews (and non-Jews) should not go up on the actual Temple Mount. Therefore, the Western Wall became the site of prayer for Jews wishing to get as close as possible to their holiest site, the Temple Mount. It earned the moniker "Wailing Wall" because Jews coming to this site would shed tears over the loss of the Holy Temple.|`|Fb519XJgaa	Jerusalem was the Governors capital in most Islamic and Christian rules.<br>  Christian ruled Jerusalem for 600 years. <br>  Muslims ruled Jerusalem for 1300 years.<br>  The Jews ruled Jerusalem 120 years.<br>  <br>  How wrong?

No other city has played such a dominant role in the history, culture, religion and consciousness of a people as has Jerusalem in the life of Jewry and Judaism. Throughout centuries of exile, Jerusalem remained alive in the hearts of Jews everywhere as the focal point of Jewish history, the symbol of ancient glory, spiritual fulfillment and modern renewal. This heart and soul of the Jewish people engenders the thought that if you want one simple word to symbolize all of Jewish history, that word would be 'Jerusalem.'”It is the capital of Israel presently.Jews have been living in Jerusalem continuously for nearly two millennia. They have constituted the largest single group of inhabitants there since the 1840's (map of Jerusalem in 1912) .Jerusalem contains the Western Wall of the Temple Mount, the holiest site in Judaism.<br>  <br>  Jerusalem was never the capital of any Arab entity. In fact, it was a backwater for most of Arab history. Jerusalem never served as a provincial capital under Muslim rule nor was it ever a Muslim cultural center. For Jews, the entire city is sacred, but Muslims revere a site — the Dome of the Rock — not the city. "To a Muslim," observed British writer Christopher Sykes, "there is a profound difference between Jerusalem and Mecca or Medina. The latter are holy places containing holy sites." Besides the Dome of the Rock, he noted, Jerusalem has no major Islamic significance|`|eyJqrqn7aa	Only Jews wanted it as a capital.<br>  Jerusalem<br>  Called also Salem, Ariel, Jebus, the "city of God," the "holy city;" by the modern Arabs el-Khuds, meaning "the holy;" once "the city of Judah" (2Ch 25:28). This name is in the original in the dual form, and means "possession of peace," or "foundation of peace." The dual form probably refers to the two mountains on which it was built, viz., Zion and Moriah; or, as some suppose, to the two parts of the city, the "upper" and the "lower city." Jerusalem is a "mountain city enthroned on a mountain fastness" (Compare Ps 68:15, 16; Ps 87:1; Ps 125:2; Ps 76:1, 2; Ps 122:3). It stands on the edge of one of the highest table-lands in Palestine, and is surrounded on the south-eastern, the southern, and the western sides by deep and precipitous ravines.<br>  It is first mentioned in Scripture under the name Salem (Gen 14:18; Compare Ps 76:2). When first mentioned under the name Jerusalem, Adonizedek was its king (Jos 10:1). It is afterwards named among the cities of Benjamin (Jdg 19:10; 1Ch 11:4); but in the time of David it was divided between Benjamin and Judah. After the death of Joshua the city was taken and set on fire by the men of Judah (Jdg 1:1-8); but the Jebusites were not wholly driven out of it. The city is not again mentioned till we are told that David brought the head of Goliath thither (1Sa 17:54). David afterwards led his forces against the Jebusites still residing within its walls, and drove them out, fixing his own dwelling on Zion, which he called "the city of David" (2Sa 5:5-9; 1Ch 11:4-8). Here he built an altar to the Lord on the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite (2Sa 24:15-25), and thither he brought up the ark of the covenant and placed it in the new tabernacle which he had prepared for it. Jerusalem now became the capital of the kingdom.<br>  After the death of David, Solomon built the temple, a house for the name of the Lord, on Mount Moriah (B.C. 1010). He also greatly strengthened and adorned the city, and it became the great centre of all the civil and religious affairs of the nation (Deut 12:5; Compare Deut 12:14; Deut 14:23; Deut 16:11-16; Ps 122).<br>  After the disruption of the kingdom on the accession to the throne of Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, Jerusalem became the capital of the kingdom of the two tribes. It was subsequently often taken and retaken by the Egyptians, the Assyrians, and by the kings of Israel (2Ki 14:13, 14; 2Ki 18:15, 16; 2Ki 23:33-35; 2Ki 24:14; 2Ch 12:9; 2Ch 26:9; 2Ch 27:3, 4; 2Ch 29:3; 2Ch 32:30; 2Ch 33:11), till finally, for the abounding iniquities of the nation, after a siege of three years, it was taken and utterly destroyed, its walls razed to the ground, and its temple and palaces consumed by fire, by Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon (2Ki 25; 2Ch 36; Jer 39), B.C. 588. The desolation of the city and the land was completed by the retreat of the principal Jews into Egypt (Jer 40-44), and by the final carrying captive into Babylon of all that still remained in the land (Jer 52:3), so that it was left without an inhabitant (B.C. 582). Compare the predictions, Deut 28; Lev 26:14-39.<br>  But the streets and walls of Jerusalem were again to be built, in troublous times (Dan 9:16, 19, 25), after a captivity of seventy years. This restoration was begun B.C. 536, "in the first year of Cyrus" (Ezra 1:2, 3, 5-11). The Books of Ezra and Nehemiah contain the history of the re-building of the city and temple, and the restoration of the kingdom of the Jews, consisting of a portion of all the tribes. The kingdom thus constituted was for two centuries under the dominion of Persia, till B.C. 331; and thereafter, for about a century and a half, under the rulers of the Greek empire in Asia, till B.C. 167. For a century the Jews maintained their independence under native rulers, the Asmonean princes. At the close of this period they fell under the rule of Herod and of members of his family, but practically under Rome, till the time of the destruction of Jerusalem, A.D. 70. The city was then laid in ruins.<br>  <br>  Plan of Ancient Jerusalem<br>  <br>  Plan of Modern Jerusalem<br>  <br>  Section Across Jerusalem—West to East<br>  The modern Jerusalem by-and-by began to be built over the immense beds of rubbish resulting from the overthrow of the ancient city; and whilst it occupies certainly the same site, there are no evidences that even the lines of its streets are now what they were in the ancient city. Till A.D. 131 the Jews who still lingered about Jerusalem quietly submitted to the Roman sway. But in that year the emperor (Hadrian), in order to hold them in subjection, rebuilt and fortified the city. The Jews, however, took possession of it, having risen under the leadership of one Bar-Chohaba (i.e., "the son of the star") in revolt against the Romans. Some four years afterwards (A.D. 135), however, they were driven out of it with great slaughter, and the city was again destroyed; and over its ruins was built a Roman city called Aelia Capitolina, a name whic|`|t7SIQj0Raa	Never a capital of anything that was Arab-owned.

I don't care about the ignorant comments saying, "oh but they're poor" or "they're so violent", the most rich people in the USA or elsewhere aren't happy with all their filthy money. The poor don't have money, but they're the happiest and well off people I've encountered!<br>  <br>  Vivan los Salvadore?os!!!<br>  =) Suerte mija.|`|QyY0Edx8aa	I dont like it...<br>  <br>  Is an horrible place and i hate it because the people hates you if you are different, if you have a different skin, or the things of you likes, a lot of people is very stupid, and i dont have nothing why to be proud of it... is a very corrupt country, is contaminated, nasty and very poor...<br>  <br>  I agree at 100% with hatorihansotanaka...|`|xqtKODvbaa	I hate el salvador and I really don't understand the love and patriotism people have for a poor country infested with massive gang problems, government corruption, poverty, the vast amount of dirty hookers, earthquakes, civil wars, countless orphans, high drug abuse problem, illicit drug exportation, criminal activity, etc, etc.<br>  <br>  I guess the people who really love ES are the ones who don't live there or have ever experienced poverty.<br>  <br>  This is my opinion, I am Salvadorean so I can have this opinion, and I've experienced the bad parts of ES, no the country is not what you see in fabricated postcards. I would take the US anyday!<br>  <br>  Furthermore I really don't understand why there are so many ignorant people from all parts of the world who live in the US and go around waving their home countries flags! If they love their countries so much, go back!<br>  As a hard working, educated, taxpaying USAmerican Citizen I adore the US, she has given me opportunities I could only have dreamed of if I live in ES. <br>  <br>  (to any reader: you can kiss my brown latin a** if you don't like what I have to say, it may seem harsh but its very true)|`|xnqGqTsMaa	I am so sorry honey. Unfortunately, you will find so many immature people at school. Here at El Salvador or wherever! Some places will laugh at you because of your hair, your voice, your clothes or anything else! <br>  I am pretty sure you will have the time to meet someone who will cherish you the way you are. Adaptation is not easy anywhere. It is a 20/80 matter: 20% the people around you, and 80% is up to you and your attitude. <br>  My advise for you is trying to be part of the class, and don't let them to laugh at you, let them laugh WITH you instead. You are in a bilingual school, they're supposed to speak english all the time. If you are living at a latin country, try to speak spanish all the time. In addition, if someone corrects you, don't fell bad, learn of it. <br>  And finally, let me tell you something, we're third world, the most of the stupid people will envy you because you were born at US (I hate that kind of silly people) and will play a hard time for you just because. Ignore them. They will cheer you crying, so they will stop bugging you if you smile<br>  Don't fell bad about it and do your best to fit wherever you are. <br>  <br>  BTW: I love El Salvador... n.n|`|xFGRYMY3aa	Do you go to a bilingual school?? Somewhere that people can be at you're same level???? Schools and friends are very important things that make people happy, other could be the family and the place where you live (physically, if its a nice place).....<br>  <br>  I love California, but I had bad luck there, now I live in NJ, but before I moved to Nj, I lived 9 years in El Salvador, and it has been the best time of my life, but, yeah when I moved It was hard, my own cousins always made fun of me, because I didn't speak to them, i couldn't speak spanish very well, that's why.....and It was hard, but now, everything is great!!! I love my family, my cousins are my best friends!!<br>  <br>  Im sorry you dont feel comfortable there, cuz I made great friends, and had a better life when I lived there, Im moving back to El Salv and I cant wait, I just had bad luck in the US in general!!!<br>  <br>  I dont know why you have to be living there If you dont want to, then you should go back to Cali....but If for some reason you have to stay in El Salvador, I recommend to switch to a bilingual school if you dont attend one, and socialize with people like you.. I know a lot of friends overthere that speak english like me!!!!<br>  <br>  Ok so, never mind the school thing, do you socialize, do you have friends, do you go out with your friends, have you explored the beauty of the country ??<br>  <br>  And I not just like ES, I love it!!!<br>  Good luck and go back to Cali if you don't like to be there!!|`|UUGYPtzMaa	well if your comparing cali to el salvador  i would have to choose cali of course. i was born in cali and i love my la lakers. now you gotta remember that most salvadorians love to joke around alot . i mean alot . when my cousins start messing with me i just tell them off in english . they get so pissed . hahha .|`|AA11653466	us salvadorians like to clown around alot dont let it bother you as long as you dont live around MS el salvador is a cool place i wouldnt mind living there i still have a salvadorian accent even though i was born in cali

Therefore, he can continue use his identification card in China like he is a Chinese Citizen. A word of caution: do not ever show your U.S. passport and your Chinese identification card at the same time. <br>  <br>  I do not promote this, but that's one way you can get around it.

1Vih78dZaa	You should try to learn at least a few words and phrases of Italian.<br>  <br>  It's not extremely unusual for Italians to speak some sort of English – particularly younger people and those living in big cities – but you can't rely on it.<br>  <br>  In my experience, Italians are very tolerant of visitors to their country who don't speak Italian, so long as they don't shout to try to make themselves understood, don't expect Italians to speak English and don't get annoyed with the locals when it turns out that communication is difficult or impossible.<br>  <br>  Start your conversations with an apology for not speaking Italian and then try to approach whatever question you're trying to ask or problem you're trying to solve patiently and with good humour. If you speak Spanish, don't be afraid to ask if they do, and don't be afraid of looking silly by using sign language or consulting a dictionary or phrase book.|`|8RummmDaaa	Gazie- Thanks<br>  Ciao- Hello<br>  Ciao- bye<br>  Cagna- *****(yes i know unnesessary)<br>  gioca-games<br>  per favore- please<br>  bagno-bathrooms|`|abk3g23Xaa	You don't need to learn italian.

dpKntiZoaa	You might want to check first with the airline IF it is possible to change the names on the tickets, otherwise there is no sense in offering them for sale.  Many budget airlines like BMI Baby will not permit name changes and if they do, will incur charges which are higher than the air ticket prices themself.<br>  <br>  Then when you have this info and want to re-issue the ticket - probably best to issue this in the UK section as there are not many mainland Europeans who would want to fly from Birmingham.  Also actually selling things like this are not actually allowed on Yahoo Answers - so maybe Ebay would be a better bet.<br>  <br>  Good luck

kMK9E2a7aa	Your question is to general. You fail to give any indication where you are going or want to stay. If you stay in a big city it will be more expensive than somewhere rural. Do you want to rent a bedsit or a villa. Off the top of my head I would say a minimum 6000€
1FPTD5I5aa	Are you skipping Bangkok?   Why not see Bangkok for a few days and while there book your flights locally?  This way you remain more flexible, you may not even want to go to some of the places on your list.  For the month of March it shouldn't be too hard to get a flight with a couple days notice.   If it was high season (December/January) then perhaps booking early would be better off.    <br>  <br>  For Pattaya you can take a taxi or cheap bus from Bangkok.   For Chiang Mai you could even take an overnight sleeper train to get there and save the price of a hotel room.<br>  <br>  There are some discount airlines that you can get but some of them have some weight allowances to consider or pay penalties.  Do you mean Krabi - Railay Beach?  My preference is Thai Air when possible, just an opinion.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|86e53ae673b0e71a74c555f56f9f3708aa	It's almost always cheaper to book in advance, but you should be able to get some decent prices at the last minute or a few days in advance for the places you're planning on traveling to, especially on Bangkok to Chiang Mai flights. I think on flights to Krabi from Bangkok it's probably better to book in advance for the best fares. The Pattaya U Tapao Airport has very limited passenger service to very few destinations and is not much closer to Pattaya than Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport, a taxi or bus from Bangkok or the Bangkok Airport is the best way to travel to Pattaya. You can compare advance fares and last minute fares on airline websites like Air Asia (usually the cheapest), Thai Airways, Nok Air and Bangkok Airways to see what the price differences are.

AA11937736	Its very easy. Look for the sighns direction you to the RER station which is in the airport terminal. The RER is a suburban commuter train line. Buy a ticket at the booth. You need only say "Paris" to the ticket seller since all destinations in the city are the same price. the cost will be 8.40 euros.<br>  <br>  Go to the turnstile, insert your ticket in the slot provided and when it reappears be sure to take it as you will need it to leave the station when you arrive.<br>  <br>  Take any train (CDG is at the end of the line) and it will take you to the St. Michel - Notre Dame station.<br>  <br>  HOWEVER, you may have a problem because the last RER  leaves at 23:05 and if you have any problems with passport or customs control (or a delayed flight) it could push you beyond that time. But it ought to be okay (absent flight delays) as I don't recall ever taking that long to get thru the entry formalities. <br>  <br>  If by some stroke of bad luck you do arrive without sufficient time to catch the last RER train then you will have to take the Noctilien (Night bus).

So pick the kind of vacation you want and then ask again.|`|cN5fKRuvaa	Florida has 4 of the top 10 beaches in the country. Disney World, Universal Studios, Sea World, and so much more.

1bTYCUDkaa	No.  A GPS utilizes radio signals, which are ban from use on all aircraft.  You can bring it with you, you just cannot use it.|`|ssYRhvdfaa	No it receives and sends satellite signals which may compromise the ships electronic devices.......|`|f2959c3466eb9458fc5521de90e563d3aa	No you can't use it and of course it is an electronic device. Is it really needed? It's not like you are flying the plane and need directions...|`|07410f5ad66cbac381e271088a67dbb9aa	Yes you can turn it on. <br>  As long as there is no radio transmitter in the GPS unit you can turn it on after takeoff (When they announce you can now use portable electronic devices, like MP3 players etc. And these days some airlines will even let you turn on devices with built in WiFi, but check with the airline in question before doing so.)<br>  Most GPS units are passive units, ie. they are radio /receivers/, not senders. (Some units also have built in radio transmitters, so check the specifications on your unit.) And since they do not transmit signals you can use them as freely as any other electronic device. (Except for takeoff and landing, of course.)<br>  <br>  Another question entirely is, will it be of any use? Like someone else pointed out, the GPS signals are very weak, and it's unlikely (Though not impossible) that you will get signals that are good enough for the system to work. (The signals do not penetrate the metal hull of the fuselage very well. Which is why airplanes, when using GPS as part of their navigation system, have the antennas installed on the outside of the hull, in a plastic casing.) <br>  <br>  So as long as your unit doesn't actually have a built in radio transmitter, bring the unit on board, wait til it's ok to turn it on after takeoff, then try to hold it up against the window, and cross your fingers. It MIGHT work.<br>  <br>  To be on the safe side though, ask a flight attendant before turning it on, as some airlines might have their own rules.|`|VlhmbHGGaa	No you can't. Any device that transmits or receives radio signals is banned.<br>  <br>  And you wouldn't have much use of the GPS anyway. GPS signals from satellites are very weak and will probably not penetrate the aluminum skin of the airplane. GPS devices are more or less "line of sight" though the signal can go through most car windows.|`|abp3QxOIaa	Lear_Pilot is correct...yes you can use GPS devices after climbing above 10,000 feet. <br>  <br>  Keep in mind that you are required to turn it off immediately if asked to do so by a crew member.|`|N2tDlnraaa	no. i think the people who fly the planes have a tracking system
9BxpGX3Daa	Under 18, I highly doubt it. 18 is the whole "legal" age thing and if it's a dance/night club they most likely won't let you in. If I remember right, there was a place called Pop Scene- it was 18 and up. The people that are 18 to 20 yrs old get a different bracelet than 21+ folks. If you get into or find a place that lets you in, don't be a tard and drink as they'll just throw you out or call the cops. If you can't find any night clubs that will let you in, go to the Metreon or more touristy areas like Fisherman's Wharf. At least those places are geared towards families and have things for anyone to do no matter what the age is. Why not go shopping in the early evening, grab something light, go to a movie around 8 or so, then go to one of the many restaurants that are opened till 3 or 4 in the morning. I think there's a movie theatre on Van Ness Ave and there's a Max's Diner down the street that is usually packed late at nights on thurs-fri-sat-sun.

I have two options that might work for you, one slightly cheaper than the other, but both are fantastic.  <br>  <br>  Now you didn't say if you live in New York or not, so if you do get some little trinkets that say New York on them (i.e. key chain, magnet, pencils, you know the normal touristy stuff).  If you don't live in NYC, check EBAY and see if there are lots of souvenirs you can buy, if that doesn't work google for "where to buy cheap NYC souvenirs".  <br>  <br>  OK, so you got your NYC labeled gifts and in addition to that you can either go:<br>  more expensive and give them an IPOD nano - there is this hot new pink one out, check it out/click on the hyper link within the link: <a href="http://mymoneyclips.com/blog/pink-8gb-ipod-nano/2008/" rel="nofollow">http://mymoneyclips.com/blog/pink-8gb-ip...</a><br>  <br>  or you can go cheaper with jewelery you can get some FREE (you pay for the shipping) and some pieces at a huge discounted price.

Additionally, at least four of the five would have to share a bed.<br>  <br>  If it is more than 5, you have to get a second room.  People have tried cramming in as many people into a hotel room as they think can fit; this is why most hotels have a policy against this.<br>  <br>  In most hotels, there are rooms that can connect to eachother with a door, making it, in effect, a suite.  That is your best bet.  But you will still have to pay for two rooms, there doesn't seem to be any way around it.<br>  <br>  If you have 8 people, that arrangement will still be tight.  To have every single bed space in a hotel room filled, it is often a lot more comfortable when everybody in the room is related.<br>  <br>  I would say, for five people you should have two rooms, and for eight people you should have three.  That can get expensive.<br>  <br>  The hotel will not let you cram 8 adults into a room and they would frown on 5.

Beaver was becoming rare in France due to its value, so it was on the verge of extinction.  Once they realized this, they would ship the furs from Quebec (via the St. Lawrence river) and back to France.  You also have to remember that the area was newly founded . .so it had plenty of untapped resources compared to France. <br>  <br>  <br>  Quoted From Wiki:<br>  <br>  "In 1534, Jacques Cartier planted a cross in the Gaspé Peninsula and claimed the land in the name of King Francis I. It was the first Province of New France. However, initial French attempts at settling the region met with failure. French fishing fleets, however, continued to sail to the Atlantic coast and into the St. Lawrence River, making alliances with First Nations that would become important once France began to occupy the land. French merchants soon realized the St. Lawrence region was full of valuable fur, especially of beaver, which were becoming rare in Europe, as the European beaver had almost been driven to extinction. Eventually, the French crown decided to colonize the territory to secure and expand its influence in America.<br>  <br>  Acadia and Canada were inhabited by indigenous nomadic Algonquin peoples and sedentary Iroquoian peoples. These lands were full of unexploited and valuable natural riches which attracted all of Europe (France, the Netherlands, and England). By the 1580s, French trading companies had been set up, and ships were contracted to bring back furs. Much of what has transpired between the natives and their European visitors around that time is not known for lack of historical records. <br>  <br>  In 1608, sponsored by Henry IV of France, Samuel de Champlain founded the city of Québec with 28 manworkers (no woman before 1617), the second permanent French settlement in what is now Canada. Colonization was slow and difficult. Many settlers died early, because of harsh weather and diseases. In 1630, there were only 103 colonists living in the settlement, but, by 1640, there were 355. "

It would be a shame to miss St. Barth (St. Barts).  It is not as Hollywood as it is made out to be.  Diddy only shows up for NYE with the rest of the people you see in Us Weekly.  It is a charming island with about 7,000 residents.  It is much like St. Tropez, but less travel time and gorgeous blue water and white sand.  It is very quaint with lovely grocery stores where you can find every delicacy your heart desires.  It is also pretty difficult to get a bad meal on the island.  It is not a party island such as Cancun although there are places to go out and dance until your heart is content.  During the day go to La Plage or Tom Beach Hotel....FANTASTIC!!  La Plage is the restaurant and the water nearly hits your toes while you dine if you so choose one of those tables.  There are fashion shows throughout the restaurant during the day and one at night.  Each last an hour.  The food is decadent yet light and does make you feel icky. OMG there is this caramel ice cream which is homemade and to die for!  The serve just the right amount although you will probably want a troth.  There is a ton of fresh seafood and lovely steaks.  The vibe gets going at night with people getting up from there tables and dancing int he middle of the restaurant.  The scene is very chic.  It is also an authentic atmosphere.  As for nightclubs on the weekend - go to the Yacht Club or The Strand Supper Club.  Most places are more lounge like vs. thumping night clubs.  The island really isn't like that.  The local men are lovely as are the women.  Be prepared to study a little french - It's fun to try even if you aren't right.  They are not French like the rep you hear - the are Islanders who happen to be French and look French, etc.  Overall very friendly place.  You will return I guarantee it.

With alot of things to do.  You will have a really nice time if you go there.|`|ben0NvDDaa	The City of St Petersburg is NOT a great vacation spot.  It's just a big city.  Now if you go west a few miles, the cities along the west coast are fantastic for vacation.  St Pete Beach, Maderia Beach, Treasure Island, Indian Rocks, Clearwater Beach - all excellent places to stay.  <br>  <br>  I just wanted to make sure you understood when looking for hotels and such.  St Petersburg is a city portion of the county.  It sits on Tampa Bay but not the Gulf of Mexico.  Everything is fairly close to one another as the county isn't that wide, but one of the other cities is were you'll want to stay.|`|nBa2euH4aa	There are always things to do wherever you go but  . . . do your kids a favor and take your family to Orlando and play at the theme parks. The East Coast is also more beautiful when it comes to the Ocean. I would rather go to the Keys, or Miami. The Everglades have some great State parks where you can take boat rides to see Alligators. St. Augustine is a very old pirate like city. I don't know what your family does together, but I think you should look at things you can do,that  will involve wonderment and play. St. Petersburg is a nice stop, but not a full vacation. I think Busch Gardens are in Tampa and that would be awsome.<br>  <br>  HURRAY FAMILY VACATIONS!!|`|a94257e28d6b37ec0048499a1cda4a58aa	Sure, nice beaches, Busch Gardens|`|ddinVDEXaa	yes. it's really pretty.
0PHR8cICaa	Violent crime in the UK is not high, and it rarely affects anybody not actually involved in criminal activities.  Like most countries, there are some areas in the bigger cities that you should avoid, but there aren't many of them.|`|aiKLvwGTaa	Name a country that never experiences violent crime...<br>  there isn't one.<br>  <br>  You should be reassured that at least we acknowledge our problems publicly; it shows that we're taking it seriously.<br>  <br>  <br>  If it makes you feel any better, we don't have guns, unlike our cousins across the pond. That must greatly reduce the number of violent crimes committed.|`|aqLLbzJQaa	No - I would definitely NOT class the UK as unsafe  - it is much much safer than many countries in the world.|`|AA10310496	Violent crime happens in every country, and the UK is certainly no more unsafe than a great deal of other countries...|`|IKCxj9gHaa	violent crime is not high compared to many other places in the world, we in Britain think it is high, but to put it in some sort of context.<br>  last year in the whole of London covered by the met police (10 million inhabitants and countless millions visiting and working there from out of town) there were 180 murders.<br>  <br>  Now that seem high but as I said that's 180 out of a minimum of 10+ million.<br>  <br>  In New York during that period with a similar population there were over 1000 murders (and NY isn't even in the top ten violent crime places in the USA!!!)<br>  <br>  In Moscow (a bit smaller than london) nearly 3000. <br>  <br>  In Johannesburg South Africa, (a lot smaller than London)  5000<br>  <br>  And in one town in Mexico (Tijuana) population 1.5 million so far THIS YEAR there has been over 5500 murders.<br>  <br>  All of the above places are major tourist destinations <br>  <br>  so if 'Not being murdered' is important to you when it comes to choosing a holiday destination where would you choose?
HwujORd2aa	In the US, how about the Gulf Coast, like Captiva Island or Sanibel or other places around Ft Myers?  It's gorgeous there.  Or someplace calm in the Florida Keys.  Lots of shelling on the beaches too. You could also send them to a resort in Puerto Rico.  There's a US National Park there that's a rainforest, and the beaches are gorgeous, especially around Luquillo or Rincon.  It's small so with a rental car or a tour they can see some really cool stuff.

V8yR8BU1aa	Depends what province you are in or where you are in that province.<br>  <br>  I quit smoking a few months ago... they were about 10 bucks a 20 pack and about 13 bucks for a regular 25 pack (you guys only have 20s in the States I think).<br>  <br>  We do sell Marlboro's that's how mucht hey will cost.  They aren't popular though, Canadian cigarettes are main brands: Du Maurier, Players, Export A, Peter Jackson, and about a dozen other brands.|`|0ZnX6Qjyaa	Yep 11 bucks<br>  <br>  I wonder why Canada doesn't have Marlboro? the UK does so does Japan thats odd|`|nfu6LiVXaa	We don't have Marlboro in Canada, but if you really really need Marlboro, go to 7-11 or any convenience store and ask for Rooftop (I can't remember which company makes them). You'll recognize them from the other cigarettes because they look very similar to Marlboros. <br>  <br>  I believe they are around $11-12 now - I haven't smoked in almost a year now, and when I did, I smoke Rooftop Silvers (similar to Marlb silvers) and they were $10.<br>  <br>  If you absolutely need the real Marlboro, then the only way to get them is to cross the border to a gas station in US.|`|RhkKGsipaa	You'll have to change from Marlboro they aren't sold in Canada, at least not in Ontario. Cigarettes right now in Ontario  about $8.00 for 20.  Packs of 20 no names  bought on the 1st nations reserves in Ontario as low as $12.00.|`|7LWDRI2Uaa	Price of cigarettes vary depending on the brand and where you buy them from, on the cheap end you can get them around $6 all the way up to $11.|`|0fc71d93282bf1baaa4cd5f250fd7a07aa	Bad habits are easy to pick, and very hard to loose.

zMRElJS0aa	a visa is sort of a "pass" that allows you to visit or stay in a country not of your residence for longer than a specific period of time. To get one, hang on, ill explain this with an example:<br>  Imagine I'm german, I want to live in turkey. To get a visa, I go to the german consulate (in e.g. Istanbul) and ask for a visa. They can grant you a visa or not, it depends on how you fill out your forms. Obviously, if you have ever had anything to do with terrorism, you will NOT get a visa for the USA, but you get the picture.

The Spring/Summer is the best time to visit because you can walk around the city and explore the old section of Zurich. The cathedral, Grossmünster, is located in the old section, along the Limmat River. It dates back to the 13th century, and had a great part in the Protestant Reformation. You have to see the stained glass windows, they were created by Marc Chagall and are absolutely gorgeous. <br>  I highly recommend taking a boat tour of the Zurichsee because you get excellent panoramic views of all the towns along the lake, and if you have a chance to visit any of these towns go to Küsnacht. There is a small hotel right on the lake called Sonne, and you can eat lunch or dinner on the terrace which is along the lake as well. A lot of people in the area do this, so if you do go, try to get there fairly early so you can pick the best table.|`|uFGONmygaa	Oh you're so lucky! I went to both 2 years ago and loved every minute of my time spent there.  In Switzerland, you really should go to Luzern - the famous covered bridge spans Lake Luzern where the swans are abundant.  Take a ride up Mt Pilatus via the cogwheel railway train - the views are breathtaking!  In Austria, you should visit Innsbruck - the Swarovski crystal headquarters are there, and the city is very vibrant.|`|u8Wgi7R1aa	Well you are talking to a girl who has been to Switzerland 8 times. <br>  I think you should definitely go to Zurich. It's a beautiful city. Also if you are planning to go to the Italian side you should visit Lake Lugano.<br>   A wonderful place up in the mountains is Murren.<br>  Also Appenzel. That's where the famous cheese is from. <br>  <br>  You are going to love it!!! I practically live over there!! :)

But overall, I found the people of Guatemala likeable, certainly moreso than in Mexico.

504EFHi3aa	Yeah bottle service is extremely overpriced but if you have the money go for it!  What I have been doing is using www.cheapvegasclubs.com what they do is sell entry to the nightclubs for near nothing.  I believe for 4 its $30/club for all of you.  I would plan a good couple nights of club hopping and taking advantage of their free open bars (<a href="http://www.cheapvegasclubs.com/freedrinksopenbar.htm)" rel="nofollow">http://www.cheapvegasclubs.com/freedrink...</a> while there. Theres also a page on there that is dedicated to "Vegas party planning" you submit the information on the page and they plan everything out for you.  Id suggest it anytime.  Another plus about it is you have their support the whole time if you have troubles give them a call and they will straighten anything out. <br>  The downside is I do not believe they do bottle service so that would still cost you a ton.<br>  <br>  ps i put the link to the party planner in the source at the bottom|`|BBNUWugUaa	XS is an amazing club with awesome customer service.

AA10244990	Since you didn't say where in the UP, I picked Marquette. Mapquest says that there are 1375 miles between Marquette and Pensacola.  Divide 1375 by 30 (miles per gallon) and you get 46 gallons.  46 gallons times our going gas rate (ymmv) of $2.04 and your trip will cost $94 for gas, one way.
dpKntiZoaa	I guess it depends on what you call 'machismo'.  If you want a guy who is very metrosexual, humble and expects the woman to wear the trousers, well then as a rule a Bosnian guy is not one for you.  <br>  <br>  Bosnian men are basically men yes, and masculine, but that does not automatically equate to possessing overbearing traits like possiveness.  That is more unique to the individual and how secure they are as a person.<br>  <br>  As I mentioned before, I dislike stereotypes and you cannot make an assumption of a whole nationality of men based on an experience of one man.  That is really shallow to do, but ok, if it makes you comfortable doing so, then so be it.|`|cwsYM2F4aa	I actually think "machismo" males are found in every race.

77ab32ec1902d28ee2a92c36db9406c6aa	I have to agree with you Corfu is terrible, we were there and it was really poor. <br>  <br>  In October you would have to be looking at southern europe to get any warm weather so you should avoid northern europe. <br>  <br>  I would reccomend the following places for the following reasons;<br>  <br>  Barcelona - It can b expensive to stay but the trasnport links are very good and you can easily tavel to the major sites of the city very quickly, it has a number of beautiful things to do, from the beach, marina, gaudi park, olympc village and many gaudi and other inspired museums.  Plus it has a lovely cafe culture, coffee is great, Estrella is a lovely beer and the food s lovely.  It can be a bit touristy but you can avoid this quite easily.  Also it is bound to be quite touristy as it is great. <br>  <br>  Seville - Again it is very warm and there is a lovely cafe culture, there is also a really nice flamenco culture so you can go to see a flamenco show.  There is a lot of nice long walks around the city you can take and christopher columbus is buried in the church.  it is a nice place to experience without feeling rushed to do to much. <br>  <br>  Lljubjana/Bled - If you can make it to Slovenia I would really reccomend it, it is cheap, the people are amazing and you could have a few days in bled and a few days in lljubjana.  This would be different as there is not so much physical things to see, it is more beautiful scenory and lovely long walks, you can also do a range of activities and go bob sleding. <br>  <br>  I think of all these, if you havent been I must highly suggest barca, its just amazing!  I've just come back from a weekend there, our third time going, we are quite well travelled and have done backpacking but we are always drawn back to barca.|`|fQfLRv9taa	I completely recommend Dubrovnik, Croatia. It was my first thought. If you like Prague perhaps Bratislava, Slovakia. Maybe Ljubljana, Slovenia too.<br>  I think Dubrovnik is best choice though. It is such a nice place! Just like other poster said, very fairytale like!!! I had a lovely time there. I find it very romantic and historic.<br>  <br>  Oh, also Vienna, Austria!|`|nXLD2nChaa	Hey<br>  i went to Corfu. :) <br>  last year in august.<br>  Well somewhere romantic with lots of places to eat which romantic and not to expensive then i would recommend Italy. <br>  No Loud annoying drinkers.<br>  Romantic.<br>  Maybe the City of Venice.<br>  Or the Great City Of Rome.|`|PKLeNnZFaa	I would highly recommend Venice - a gem of a place and with all that you ask for, should be warmish in Oct.  <br>  <br>  Dubrovnick is another ideal location.<br>  <br>  Krakow in Poland is also a great spot.<br>  <br>  What about Malta?|`|FZfYxiCJaa	london is the greatest city in europe by far , been to many places in europe to many to list but still nothing compares to good old london city|`|zTLjmrKtaa	Bruges.

Try their fruit beers!|`|5voFMvonaa	barcelona|`|dD8YUt15aa	venice|`|wEHyAkbpaa	Hey<br>  Dubrovnik meets the criteria you have listed. I have visited Dubrovnik several times now. I actually met my other half there. We love Dubrovnik and must say it is one of the most romantic cities we have been to. <br>  <br>  Dubrovnik is like a fairy tale ..... thye old city is enclosed withing the walls ... it is a car free zone and is perfectly set with a mountain drop on one side and the Dubrovnik riviera on the other side.<br>  <br>  One of the reasons I love this place is the lack of binge drinkers! If you want style, good fresh food, romance, beautiful scenery, exclusivity, untouched paradise ... visit Dubrovnik<br>  <br>  We stayed at apartment with history dating way back before the war! We were amazed to learn the walls in the apartment were more than 500 years old. Apartment was so comfortable and had some of the most amazing views! We would always go back to Apartment Lobrovic as it is a very special place to stay perched in a location that no other apartment in Dubrovnik Old Town can offer. We booked the apartment via <a href="http://www.dubrovnik-sunshine.com/Apartment-Lobrovic.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dubrovnik-sunshine.com/Apartm...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  Salamina the globe-trotter|`|6a7c2f7356f1dbadf90f001beb576671aa	Yalta!|`|AA11276156	A few suggestions for you:<br>  <br>  Budapest<br>  Barcelona<br>  Dubrovnik|`|UrpxXDPSaa	I have recently been to Barcelona and it is really interesting.<br>  People say its expensive, but if you look around you can find cheap , nice places to eat.

FaX8awk1aa	sorry, to the best of my knowledge there is none where you can do so legally
km9cQNAXaa	Mostly the Caribbean Islands, or Hawaii. Those from the hot southern states might visit Canada. Some fly the Atlantic to visit the major cities in Europe, London, Paris, Madrid and Frankfurt to name a few.<br>  <br>  Lots take holidays within the USA to places like the California coastline or the New England coast. Even Florida if you have grey hair and it's winter.<br>  <br>  Ian M|`|VtTBRrl1aa	It depends on the family.<br>  some people go to hawaii, florida, La's vegas, new york, E.C.T.<br>  and some people just stay home of some party thing like with there family or something.|`|M4PMGw2Zaa	Florida<br>  California<br>  New York City<br>  Texas? <br>  Canada<br>  Hawaii<br>  Britain xD<br>  France<br>  China <br>  (...the rest of the big tourist-y areas)<br>  Americans do like to travel to other countries outside of their continent. It's just that I can't think of any other good travel places|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	Other states. Florida is a popular vacation place. Las Vegas...I went to Jamaica for my honeymoon.|`|Z980TqG3aa	middle class goes to the beach in new jersey, maryland, delaware, and virginia.|`|hCV5Hyqfaa	Cape Cod

yHl7RIuOaa	Beaches are what is there.  Fort Myers Beach is a little more active and wild. More young people but also more wild and blue collar.  You have to be able to tolerate drunk people.<br>  <br>  Sanibel is more quiet and peaceful.  But also a $6 toll across the bridge.<br>  <br>  There are some outlet malls near I75 that are fun.<br>  <br>  Spirng training baseball is there if you like baseball and you are there in March.  Thomas Edison museum is there which is interesting for an hour or 2.|`|JWNzoksmaa	beach, beach and more beach. You'll find tons of things to do on the beach.
WWS3djdqaa	Really depends on how much you want to spend... and let us know if you want only steak places.<br>  <br>  If it is a steak then I would suggest SW steakhouse rated as one of the top ten steakhouses in the US. Make sure you get a seat on the patio to view of the fountain show. Should cost around ~$220 with a reasonable bottle of wine.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gayot.com/restaurants/sw-steakhouse-las-vegas-nv-89109_4lv050901-08.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gayot.com/restaurants/sw-stea...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  OR....I would suggest<br>  <br>  If you would like a real experience... get a table at Alize at the top of the PALMS,,, make sure you get a table with a view of the strip and order the chefs tasting menu... An eight course dinner that is an experience in itself.... with a reasonable bottle of wine (50-70) it will be about ~$350... but definitely something you will remember.|`|BBNUWugUaa	Check out <a href="http://www.VegasMadeEasy.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.VegasMadeEasy.com</a> for tons of suggestions on the finest of Vegas dining!|`|AA10240904	For the romance I would go to the restaurant at the top of Stratosphere 101 stories, high that revolves with a view of the entire Vegas valley.|`|hPdEZ4Ypaa	Oh, hell, I'd go for the gusto. Check out the one at the top of the Stratosphere.|`|yvPA8FSsaa	The Top of the World atop the Stratosphere is the most impressive restaurant (and one of the priciest) in Las Vegas.  It is like 800 feet up and it very slowly rotates, almost imperceptibly (1 hr 20 minutes to make a revolution) providing a beautiful panorama.  The food is great the service is great but lots of restaurants can make that claim.  What the Top has is that view.  If you make your reservations so they coincide with sunset,  well, you can just imagine the colors as the sun sets over the dessert and the lights come on along the Strip.<br>  <br>  I recommend the Chateaubriand three-course dinner for two.  The attire is business casual or better.  Reservation required.  After dinner you can stop and enjoy the observation deck or watch the people braving the scary rides at the top.  <br>  <br>  *|`|Moe5zGO7aa	We ate at L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon at MGM and got an all and one deal for tickets to Crazy horse. We saw the show and had dinner beforehand and it was like 160-180 bucks (this was last feb). At the resteraunt however, I had the cod and my husband had steak. The steak was very yummy....you could cut it with your fork. They had a certain menu you can pick from if you do the ticket package deal. Check out the mgm.com website for more information. I think you can choose between 3 places to eat.|`|Ojk7tMdxaa	The Eiffel Tower resturant at the Paris, right across the street from where you will be staying. Get a table over looking the Fountian at the Belligo at night.<br>  <br>  I have never eaten at a 4 star resturant before, it was a real experience.|`|nZmLycrXaa	Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill in Caesar's, or there is a new steakhouse in Planet Hollywood. Both hotels are on the strip.
W7LGoC3yaa	Sure -- <br>  Zero Gravity on Malibu Drive in Dallas<br>  Air Jump on Chretien Point in Mansfield<br>  Leapin' Lizards on Boulevard 26 in North Richland Hills|`|WrDGhduxaa	West of I-35 North of Walnut Hill, behind the mini car race track is a bungee place that has several different kinds of jumps.|`|hPdEZ4Ypaa	There might be at Six Flags|`|RFK9sG6zaa	Yeah there is.... but I was drunk and tried to bungee jump while laying on my back in the ladies room.  (so they kicked me out) and I forgot the name of the place... but it sound's like "Jump-Your-Girlfriends-Bean" or some'thin like that !!!|`|YSASNCuIaa	not in Arlen TX
