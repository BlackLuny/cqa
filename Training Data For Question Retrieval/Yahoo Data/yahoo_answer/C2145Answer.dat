If you want a photo/custom picture as your avatar you need to make a yahoo 360 account. http://360.yahoo.com/login.html?.done=ht...    The photo/image needs to be saved on your computer as a jpg file, don't worry about the size to much yahoo will adapt it. Then go to the following 4 steps. below         1> Go to your 360 page then click "my page (top of page).    2> Click "edit personal photo" (on the left above photo window).    3> Click browse choose the photo from your photos click "save", Set as primary and "save".     4> Go to your edit my profile http://answers.yahoo.com/my/my_edit  click  use my yahoo 360 picture scroll down and press "preview", and then "OK" in the next screen.  And your done.    Yahoo engineers are still working on improvements throughout all yahoo sites and some avatars may be slow to show (it could even be a day or so) so try to be patient.  ?
angW1Lkfaa	That's a problem many people don't have the right answer and hopefully they won't pass on false information. All we can do is try and put out all the good info we can. If we can get the right info to some of the people we have helped. So many people no matter how good the info is won't listen  they want to hear people who agree with their ideas.   From the questions there are a lot of people hurting pray people do the right thing.|`|BMkVOR0caa	Reported, Troll!|`|Qd8aqvVuaa	i think its as useful as the person using it :)

Usually it's pretty simple to figure out: smtp.youremailprovider.com, although some companies use a different configuration.    You must actually have a valid account and your password before the emailer will allow you to send mail through it, however.

7e9f66e8183a6115754d5680f9ad5f36aa	I saw that on one of my colleagues and sent a note to Yahoo!  The answer was that the person is very active in IM messaging.  Translated: they IM a lot.

3c5f2316d7b180d5f45a6448d9b9def0aa	I have to agree with you.   Statistics is one area that does not appear to be a priority for Yahoo.    The only thing I can suggest is visiting the Forum and leaving a suggestion.   Staff will make a comment if it gets enough attention.

2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	Higher levels let you ask, answer and vote even more. At Level 5, you go 'unlimited'. If you are not hitting your daily limits, you are fine where you are. If you are hitting the limits, you need to answer more, ask less, and move up to a higher level. Click the blue   of your points/level to see the points/level listing.|`|hfRiTud3aa	yeah you can vote more times and get more points
JhvqUvlsaa	The same thing is happening to me; in my badge category, Yahoo Toolbar, questions go into voting all the time, even if I'm the only answer.   I don't know why, but more and more people are leaving their questions open and allowing them to go into voting.  Go to your list of answers and vote for yourself if you feel you gave a good answer; it is better to close a question than have it lay open for weeks and months.|`|yxnUBSJqaa	Because it takes 4 hours for the Best Answer button to appear.  By then the person that asked the question has just left and abandoned it.  That's the main reason...|`|Qd8aqvVuaa	it takes a couple days for a best answer option to appear, and by then most people have forgotten about it :( Or they go back and check it a month later and its already gone to vote!    Would be nice if you could vote for a best answer straight away|`|3TkGUdDBaa	I get this too, even when I'm the only one to answer the question.     It takes four hours before you can chose a best answer. That's to give enough time for the rest of us to come on and look at the question, this makes it fairer as more people get a chance.    But the problem is seople just seem have short memories. I always vote for a best answer, never let a question go to vote.    Perhaps there should be a restriction on the number of questions you can ask/answer if you have an undecided question with at least one answer, but also a way you could chose to put it to vote if you really can't decide. This would probably encourage more people to chose their best answerer, and the Y!A community would still be able to vote on questions.   Maybe, maybe not. I'm just thinking of ideas.

aLzymSxraa	sd card     they cost about $5-10    if not try to find some sort of usb connection from an accessory store.|`|zUmJ8ZFZaa	You probably have the resolution on the phone set too low to get large pictures.  Verizon won't let you send pictures over a certain size via MMS, so you'll need to e-mail them if your phone has that capability.    Barring that you could save the files to a MicroSD card and transer them that way.  That's assuming that you have a card reader in your computer.

Tu9S1WaNaa	Yes, you can.  Use it just like a credit card :)  It will take a little while for your card to go through, because you will have to confirm your card with paypal.  That can take a few days.    Here is how you confirm your card ;  When you first put a debit card or bank account on paypal, they will charge or credit that card or bank account a small fee of like a few cents. You have to find out how much the fee was. Call your credit card company, or bank for a debit card, and find out how much the fee was. If you have gotten a credit card, or bank statement since you put the card on paypal, the amount will be on that statement. Sometimes they do 2. Get the exact amount of the fee and go to confirm account on your paypal. It will then guide you through.

When you first join up you get those 100 points you have..When you ask a question in here you loose 5 points,you get 1 point each time you log into yahoo answers.  2 points when you answer a question and also you will get 10 points if your answer is awarded best answer.You will get 3 points back from this question when you choose a best answer..  You can go into undecided questions and vote for a best answer,that will get you 1 point..  If you ever happen to receive a violation notice you will loose 10 points for that..Yahoo have community guidelines,i think you should read them just so you know the rules of yahoo..There are 100's of different section of yahoo for you to ask and answer in..

DJ6RT84Naa	The funds may not currently be in the sellers account.  It may take a few days for paypal to transfer the money from their credit card or checking account.  Once paypal confirms the money from their source it will be released to you.  Also you must transfer the money from your paypal account to your checking account or credit card.  Just go to the withdraw tab on the top of the page.|`|eu6UQElYaa	How long ago did the paypal transaction take place?   Generally it takes at least 3 days, sometimes up to a week, for paypal transactions to show up on your bank account, assuming that is that you have it set up so that the money will deposit into your bank account instead of just sitting in your paypal account.   I would call your credit card to check the activity on there to see if the payment was actually reversed and if it's reflected in your balance.   If the money has indeed been credited back to your credit card account then I would breathe a sigh of relief and ask them to cancel out your current card and give you a new card with a new account number on it.     If the money hasn't been credited to your credit card account and isn't sitting in your paypal account then it sounds like you were scammed.  I would try contacting the seller to find out what's going on.  If you don't get an answer or if you do get an answer but it still doesn't resolve itself then you can file a complaint of fraud with ebay and with paypal and paypal will refund the money for you.

An8rT0WMaa	i agree|`|zDQIPFH2aa	No, there have to be limits.  There are several reasons,  3 being the most important.    1. To give new users experience so they do violate themselves off the site the first day.    2. To prevent organized chat sessions between users using new accounts.    3. To prevent spammers, scammers, and porn kings from using new accounts and taking over the board with auto posting programs.    4. To promote people coming back to Yahoo so they see the ads more than once.
AA11864826	It's actually pretty common. As far as I can figure the "Customer Care-less Team" just takes an answer down whenever they get a complaint.

zDQIPFH2aa	When this happens, there are two reasons:    1. (least likely) there is a random glitch now and then that just loses the Qs. YA Staff do not care, just delete the old version and reask. If it was a long question with links, ask it in a short version with no links, then finish the question with the links in the added details.    2. (more likely) you were caught by the prefilter. Exactly how it works is not known, but probably is based on keywords and links you use (to prevent spamming). These questions are held for the YA Staff to review. It is usually for hours during the week, but can be days on weekends and holidays. Again, if you follow the direction in  1 above, you can sometimes get around it.|`|07449b5846f5049bc8771e275903857daa	It takes a few mins give or take about 4 or more mins to them to be displayed on this site Y&A.|`|Bru5jJZraa	It should be there, give it a few minutes.    Or look at page 2, page 3, sometimes theres a lot of people typing in questions at the same time.
9kJyn0gkaa	yes they must give you a warning
zDQIPFH2aa	The fact that others are not removed, is independent of you situation.  If you see violations, report them.  Most political questions are removed for "rants".  That is when you post a question and then tell people why they should believe the same way you do.  You are not to voice your opinions in the question.  There are several reason questions are removed.    1. It is a violation of the rules - you will get an e-mail when that happens.  If you get an e-mail, post it in a question and the users can tell you the problem.    2. There were zero answers when the time expired - no e-mail sent.    3. The BA was reported as a violation - no e-mail sent.    4. During voting, "No Best Answer" was chosen as the best answer - no e-mail sent.    Look in your e-mail, including the spam folder, for a violation e-mail. If not there, check your activity tab in your profile. If nothing about a violation there, then the Q was removed for one of the other reasons.|`|DMjxbn3Jaa	I agree.  Maybe it was too controversial?|`|acb3460d04f4cfff9b5d33cacf3df0f2aa	I guess they can remove it..

When you terminate your account, you permanently lose all saved data and Yahoo site access associated with your ID. Youll be deleting your email account, address book, group memberships, Y!Answers account, Y!Messenger ID, any photos youve uploaded, any 360 blogs youve posted, etc. If you're sure you want to delete your account, make sure youre logged into the account you wish to delete and then click on this link: https://edit.yahoo.com/config/delete_use...

Your entire account will then be completely & irretrievably deleted.|`|5fb39523f75c15b623115ea5cd8f29eeaa	Your yahoo account comes as a package and can only be deleted as a whole. However once your questions and answers go to the vote or resolved they become the property of yahoo and stay in yahoo archive available for searching and browsing and only the yahoo team can remove them.                            But you can make them invisible with the following steps.    * Blank out your avatar to the grey silhouette.    * Change your nickname or just leave it blank.    * Close any links to your 360, and email.    * Delete your open questions and answers.    * Set your Network and Q&A to private.    * Delete your contacts and fans. To delete fans block then unblock.  Then just leave it. After you've applied the alterations no search will find your Q&A,s.

But below is the info on 2 of the most popular.     To use flickr click on the photo then click "all size" (above the photo) choose the size you want to use then click "grab the url" under the photo and right click and paste it in your question/answer.      To use photobucket click the photo and choose the size of photo you want to post then click the direct link under the photo and copy and paste it to your question/answer.    Note: asking am i pretty or how old do i look type questions can be reported for chatting.

Z1FYjWmJaa	If you are using your own server to host your website (and judging by the nameservers you listed you may be), you may need register your name servers with your domain registrar. If this is Yahoo!, you will need to sign into help.yahoo.com, and go to the small business section, and call the number listed for technical support. You will need to give the agent you speak to the name servers you have listed, as well as the static IP address for those name servers. After they have been registered, you should be able to change the nameservers to point towards your server correctly. Good luck!|`|UUx74K5Caa	You can't remember what you named your domain?  There should be a domain manager with all your domains listed at your hosting company's Web site.|`|2gaR06qraa	What are you really asking for here?

f202428f23f47abf8c99a259c26fc13eaa	Every mail program uses the BCC address line (blind courtesy copy), to completely hide all addresses entered on it.<br>  <br>  I don't know about Gmail---but, some systems will send the mail with only the BCC line filled.<br>  <br>  Some others will require at least one valid address on the TO line. In that case---put your own address on TO and everyone else on BCC. Only your address will show.

F9Wqp5YMaa	i think she doesn't want to meet you so she is avoiding you. if she played hard to get or game, it wouldn't take THAT long to reply back.   you called her a few times and left a message and she didn't reply you back..... not good sign obviosuly. i don't think it is a game at all. she doesn't want to meet you , maybe she has someone else in her life, i don't know.   sometimes guy friends ask your number and you cannot say "no, i cant give it to you", so you give them your number.  but that doesn't mean you want to meet them or you are interested. you give your number because you are being nice, that is it. if you are not interested, you don't answer their calls or messages. so i think she is not interested.    you should ask this question on singles and dating section, you will get more feedback.|`|UxnLrrSWaa	She's not interested.

To do that, go to your Yahoo! Answers profile, and then click on the button that says "My 360 profile" in blue letters. It is to the right of your ID. Once you set up the profile, you can click on the button that reads "Edit Personal Photos". That takes you to a page, where you can upload an image you wish to use as your primary photo. After you have added the image, you can set it as your primary. Then, go to your Yahoo! Answers profile, and then click the button that reads "Edit My Info". You will see three boxes down near the bottom toolbar on the page, and the middle one reads "Use my Yahoo! 360 Picture". Check the circle next to it, and then scroll down and save your profile.

Tu9S1WaNaa	You have to confirm your credit card number.  When you first put a credit card or bank account on paypal, they will charge or credit that card or account a small fee of like a few cents.  You have to find out how much the fee was.  Call your credit card company and find out how much the fee was.  If you have gotten a credit card statement since you put the card on paypal, the amount will be on that statement.  Sometimes they do 2.  Get the exact amount of the fee and go to confirm account on your paypal. It will then guide you through.    Above all be sure that it is really paypal that you are on.  I trust ebay to take me there when I'm paying, but otherwise I go to paypal.com myself.

Don't use the general time zones at the top of the list. Use the ones at the bottom specific to your area.

Make sure you have no other applications running.    1. Restart your computer if you get a CPU too busy or server too busy. For some reason, Yahoo Messenger is running hard. Check Applications >> Utilities >> Process Viewer to confirm.    2. If you are using macam, Logitech's Quick cam, or iSights software, start that first. Check the setting of your camera (I'm using Quickcam Zoom and the settings reset each time). Sometimes you will have to restart your computer.

eb4a10b7d0c7b16ef422f23a98ba67beaa	I have sen this happen a few times and it looks like the person has answered the wrong question.   The answers I have seen are real answers, they don't look like they're just putting anything down to get two points. They seem to be answering a question, it's just not the question they submitted the answer too.   Perhaps they have opened the wrong question, submitted their answer and never looked at what they were answering.  Or like everyone else thinks, they're just after the 2 points for answering.

74a27fcb0938b5b6c5f60ac5aa99190caa	Hi  you stated:  She stole MY email address and is sending yahoo! messages to MY phone from it so it looks like I am "stalking myself      SUGGESTION:  Don't reply - Do not respond to the email, as it will only encourage further harassing messages.    "I don't know how to prove it is her harassing/stalking me"    Forward the message to the sender's ISP (Internet Service Provider) - If you find the email very offensive, are receiving them often, or are tried of constantly getting and deleting junk, you can always notify the ISP of the sender about the harassing email.   To find the ISP contact, find the host domain name from the emails return address, which is located in the "From" or "Reply -To" fields (I.E someone@hostdomainname.com.   You should then forward the message along with your complaint to postmaster@hostdomainname.com or abuse@hostdomainname.com.    AND THEN ALSO FORWARD IT TO YAHOO ABUSE.    Change your Yahoo Address to something that she would never think of.    You may Need to "block"the email address that she stole.  So she cannot message you.    Only accept Yahoo IM contacts  that YOU INVITED.      On Yahoo Messenger you can use the Stealth settings, and create aliases  and you can put on the Security seal so she would not be able to get into your acct.   I am willing to  help with this.    Yahoo can delete the account and the ID will not be allowed to create the same ID - right away... so Contacting Yahoo will help.|`|xJfVrAD7aa	I was going to say go to the police, but you obviously already did that...this is tricky! sounds like a complete *****. maybe talk to her boyfriend? it may be awkward, but maybe he will do something about it. or one of her friends. change your email address too!|`|Ma0f4AfQaa	Hi A Dubya, I would try to talk to her nicely because that a good behavior is the best thing to show and respect makes everything possible. I know she has been harrassing you for a very long time and i know that it is hard for you to act nice because you give her a moment that she will start thinking she is acting unfair and mean to you. At a time in your convenience, let her know that you want to talk to her and discuss with her about why she acts like that. The problem won't be solved unless you make things work.  Hope that helped.|`|Bu4FP23paa	Just kill her... problem solved. lol JUST JOKING!!!!    No, well girl your situation sucks you should move out of town, and start a fresh life.

Are you talking about your Mum, wife, girlfriend, what??    but if you want to answer questions on here, where is the harm?  Unless you are spending more time on the computer than you are with her/on your school work, living real life - that is a problem.  But if she just doesn't want you talking to strangers, well, that's a bit strange.  We all talk to strangers, most every day - for example, you say "Hi" to the checkout chick, talk about the weather or something.  you don't know her so she's a stranger.  Is it OK if you talk to people like this?    Just explain to whoever has a problem with you being on here that it is anonymous, no-one knows who you really are and it's just a good place to ask some questions you may not be able to ask in real life and also help people out with your knowledge and experiences.  Unless being here has taken over your life, it doesn't hurt anyone, may actually help both you and other people and is just a way to pass time.    hope that helps, though I'm still a bit confused...
