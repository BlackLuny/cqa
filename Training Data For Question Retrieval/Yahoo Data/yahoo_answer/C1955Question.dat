20070422192642AAXqXgJ	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Getting frustrated trying to find a good pre-paid phone/service?	Okay, I've been researching various pre-paid plans for quite some time now. It's frustrating. Every single company has something "bad" that this and that person doesn't like about it. That makes it awful for trying to find a decent service. The problems one person has with a company, another may never have, so that seems really hard to decide just by "comments/opinions" of "what is the best service". Everyone has their own unique needs which gives a bad impression if what they desire isn't found. But it's impossible to know if I don't check around on here, with people who have had companies I'm considering. I'm a Virgin Mobile customer. My month ends Wednesday 4/25 and I want to get a phone that doesn't look like a kids 'toy'. VM doesn't have any of those 'real' phones. I don't need internet/web browsing, music or video on my phone, etc.  Just a basic service (pre-paid monthly plan). I have the $34.99 talk plan from VM and usually don't max it out most months.
20070312174956AARDlew	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Why does Cingular overcharge me?	My dad & I share 700 minutes a month for a flat rate of $70. Then I have 200 txt messages so that is about $75 a month. It's ok w/ me if the phone bill is like $80 or something because I understand with taxes & everything, but, it ends up being like $95 a month! Why? I check the billing list and it says:   Monthly Service Charges-74.98 (700 minutes + 200 txt), Usage Charges -2.06  (I think this is from going over on my txt messages),   Credits/Adjustments/Other Charges    8.19  <-- What is this?,   Government Fees & Taxes -6.35 <--& y is it so high?,     TOTAL CURRENT CHARGES  91.58         Total Amount Due $91.58    So, basically I don't understand why the taxes are so high on my cell phone plan!! It's outrageous! If you add it up, that is $14.54 for taxes alone!   And also: My dad and I don't really need 700 minutes/month. How much would it cost 2 downsize 2 like 200 or 300 minutes per month? Ok thanks!!

I tried all the steps.  I plan to mail it to be fixed.  However, can I just go to an Ipod store and have them fix it there?  Also, if I decide to mail it in, the website says that any accessories will not be returned to me.  So, should I not include my headphones/velvet case when I return it?     Should I just put in my Ipod in that black box it came in and just that?  Should I print out a reciept online (I ordered it online) and also stick it in the package? How long does it take for them to mail it back?   In the Request Service page, it asks "What can we help you with today?"  The choices are to replace a part or accessory OR "service product (Ipod).  Which one should I choose?   I know that these questions seem easy, I just want to make sure that I won't make a mistake.

20070730113208AAnrEn2	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	What can I do?	I live in switzerland. About a year ago, i bought a phone from sunrise. It's prepaid. Even though i never signed up or bought anything, I got SMS from Jamba every week or so which said "Have fun with Jamba!". The problem is, they always take about 5 francs (about 4 bucks) of my credit. It may not seem like much, but they sometimes take more and I don't really use my phone a lot anyways, and then 5 francs seems like a lot of money (about, what, 300+ sms with the deal i had!). So I wanted these sms to stop. I called sunrise and told them, and they said theyd try to stop it. But it didn't help, in fact, it only got worse. So then I called Jamba and told them to stop, which didn't have any effect either. I could probably technically sew them, but it's too expensive to bother. I haven't had credit on my phone since around christmas simply because its always gone after a short while (due to Jamba). (more in add details!)

I can't seem to decide which it a better camera.  I do like that the sony has a better zoom which could come in handy, but I like that the Casio has a 10 megapixel.  They both seem to have gotten pretty good reviews, and are small which I like.  Does a 3x and a 5x really make that much of a difference or am I being too picky over a 2x difference?

20090220021109AAe9bXV	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;PlayStation	Does this mean cross game chat?	Wow.  So, a Gametrailers poster who openly admits to being completely wrong about something fairly Sony-specific (see his sig) now has an ‘insider’ at Sony R&D, where they apparently make Firmware updates.  And nuclear weapons.  And monkeys with 3 heads.  Anyway, said insider has furnished the aforementioned poster with a likely list of updates we’ll see in Firmware 2.7.      If you don’t want your  brain fried by the responses over at Gametrailers, here’s the meat of the post:      Friends List:   - Voice Messaging is now available as an alternative to text after selecting a user on the friends list. Voice message recordings are capped at 30 seconds.   - Home Integration: Saved Playstation Home avatar photos can be selected as photo ID for Gamer Card/Friends List.   - Trophy number and Gamer Level are listed under Friend names for quick reference.      Gamer Card & Trophies:   - Gamer Card layout has been changed to more closely resemble the Playstation Store aesthetic.   - Past Trophy information can be viewed in detail by selecting “Recent Trophy History” option.   - Newly aquired trophies auto-sync in the background   - Server infrastructure for Trophies has been optimized. Resulting in faster retrieval time for Gamer Card and Trophy information.      In-Game XMB:   - Loading time for In-Game XMB has been drastically reduced, resulting in a more seemless in-game experience.   - “Theme settings” options while in-game is now available, allowing custom themes to be applied to the In-Game XMB.   - Internet Browser can now be accessed while in-game.   - Voice messaging and voice chat options can be used while in-game.   - Options that cannot be used in the XMB during game sessions are grayed out (but still selectable) to eliminate user accessibility confusion.      Misc:   - Other slight UI tweaks and enhancements.      Does this mean cross game chat for the PS3? Or does it mean just being able to send voice messages?

20090220030146AAzgNmH	Consumer Electronics;Other - Electronics	What is audio output and how do I use it to hook up speakers?	I'm planning on buying some $49 SONY speakers (as seen on Amazon if you shop for electronics there at all...) and according to one of the product discussions, one of the Amazon.com community members was able to find out via calling the manufacturer of his television that one could hook the speakers up to a TV if there was "output audio connections"...I'm guessing he meant to say "audio output...", so...can anyone translate this information into something I can use?  I would get a receiver (finally found out something about those a couple weeks ago, via another Amazon discussion...) and negate the need for this, but I'm missing like $20 or so...anyway, if it helps anyone reading this, my TV is a Dynex DX-LCD26-09.  I don't need "surround sound", it doesn't even impress me when I go to the theater, and I hardly ever do that even (most movies are junkfood for the brain, IMO).  Thanx.
