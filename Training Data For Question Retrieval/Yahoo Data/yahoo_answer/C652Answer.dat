gfHutvEFaa	why wouldn't you just "google it"? <br>  <br>  23 years without oral and you're just now getting around to wondering about it?|`|th7C1aoaaa	what? no oral? does she sleep on a Bible? and why?|`|1nFvtEx8aa	Mildred sent me here to help you.
LMIbr1aeaa	I enjoy hanging out with this particular single mother of 2 children, only because we both have so much in common with each other and my wife does not!  I feel so much extreme happiness with this other female friend.  I think its strange and weird to go thru this!  I always maintain professional friendship with other females. It would be disastrous, if I would to cross the line.|`|5RoYyprkaa	It's normal to find other people attractive, but it's important not to act on it. I worked in a hospital filing insurance papers when my husband and I first got married, and there was one coworker who kept trying to spend time with me. While I thought he was attractive, I simply reminded him that I was married, and he needed to turn his attention elsewhere. We still spoke at work, and if I saw him outside of work I would say hello, how are you? But that was as far as it went. We never had coffee or ate lunch together, and I never gave him any reason to think that I was attracted to him.|`|IXgPHYbDaa	your married.<br>  <br>  you should be concentrating on your husband. not other guys.<br>  <br>  its fine to talk to other guys, but in a friendly manor, with no intention to flirt or anything of that nature.|`|AcFBETxAaa	way past that stage. only weak minded jerks remain in that stage for long.|`|C9brWMriaa	It all depends and what you want the outcome to be.  Once you aware of your attraction to another person, you should stay as far away if you value your marriage.  The closer you get to the person and the more time you spend with them the greater possibility of something occuring between the two of you.  It doesn't really how strong you think you are, fatal attractions occur every day.|`|kN4EaiUDaa	if you dont want to hurt your spouse and end your marriage then you need to completly avoid the other person and defiantly dont show your attractions because it will always lead to other things.  stay faithful and commited to your spouse because your spouse is in your marriage for the long haul and the other person your attracted to could only be around for a short time then you've ruined your marriage for a measly short 2months of attraction|`|CWVBfaPwaa	You're only human if you think some people are attractive. However, if you're married you should not find ways to spend time with them nor should you talk about your personal life. Thats what your spouse is for and your close friends. You'd be opening a can of worms that should just not be opened.<br>  <br>  BTW...who the heck is Mildred??????|`|BLaEQfdDaa	well up front they should know that your married or with someone else, but being friends is ok but cant go any further than that, this is where you have to think about things if its worth losing everything you have with someone else, and more if your married you will lose alot more!!!|`|CQsD09D6aa	Being married does not mean that you are dead and of course you will attracted to other people. The trick is to ignore these feelings and concentrate on the marriage.|`|UA9fu8khaa	I treat them like I treat everyone, no different. Why flirt with temptation? I know what's right and and wrong. I like to sleep with a clear conscience at night.|`|th7C1aoaaa	it's natural to find others attractive. but to let them know and act on it is wrong.|`|1nFvtEx8aa	Mildred sent me here to help you.|`|AA10130377	Listen, the first thing you need to do is look at your relationship with your spouse.  Your question was, "How do you handle YOUR (my)attraction for another person?", not "How do I handle another persons attraction to me?"  If things were great between you and your spouse, you wouldn't even be asking this question.  You and I both know that when a woman says she's attracted to a man, it's something more than looks.  This individual is providing you with something you are lacking (or lost) in your marriage.  Who knows? Chances are, this something was there once, but was somehow lost along the wayside.  You wouldn't miss something if you never had it. Am I right?  What was it? Was it the way he looked at you with that glimmering smile?  Was it the way he used to show interest and anticipation to every word that rolled from your beautiful lips?  Was it the way he used to touch your neck and face as he kissed you?  Just ask yourself what's missing, that's all I suggest.  My marriage (and my life) was ruined because I looked to other women for what I thought I lost with my wife.  It was there, I just didn't look for it.  Don't make the same mistake I did.|`|FtyLwqR5aa	Keep it to yourself. Don't show it or act on it. If they know it they could try to take advantage of you at a weak point.|`|U1pMvDvgaa	Just when I think everything is going fine, bam a restraining order.
AA10818655	Give her some time to cool off and try talking to her again in a few weeks or even months. If she's still acting all weird about it, there's most likely no hope in getting back together. It's not a sin to try to stay friends, but if it's too much stress on either of you then it is probably not worth it. My ex-boyfriend and I were best friends before we started dating, it lasted nearly a year and I broke up with him. It took about 7 or 8 months before we started talking again. We're not nearly as close as we used to be, but we still chat occasionally. Things will probably get less awkward once one of you starts seeing someone else and it really hits home that you're moving on. Who knows, she just might need some time away to decide if she's really into having a relationship with you. I know a couple who went out for several years, broke up for a year and saw other people, and ended up married once they had some time away and realized that they really were a good match. If you really like this girl, then be patient. If you're not absolutely in love with her, don't hurt yourself.|`|eJKJzglgaa	I had a boyfriend leave me one day that suddenly. It was all because he had cheated on me.  Sometimes it is hard to leave a relationship because although you feel the relationship is wrong you do care very much for the person.  I think you should at least respond to her and say that you dont want to be enemies.  I wouldnt go as far to say things are fine because break ups arent always fine they are hard and sad things to deal with.|`|KTbo7dWlaa	Its always hard to brake up with someone you care about. You don't have to hate the person just because you aren't in love with them. She might be going through a hard time or she just does not want to be with you. You should text her and tell her that you don't want to enemies, and you hope she finds what will make her happy..... even if you don't mean it! There is a saying "Set it free and if it comes back then its meant to be".... " If it dose not come back, then its not meant to be" I hope it helps..... Good Luck!!|`|322bb80d54bfc2e6557a9eb03b121a0daa	There maybe is a hope. But start out with the friendship stage first. Work out on your relationship as friends and if thing work out then you two might get back together, but if you feel that the relationship between the two of you are just for friendship then try dating other girls, but still keep the friendship strong.|`|Qf11iu8Caa	NO...breaking up with my ex was the hardest think it the whole world but i had to do it...because i didn't love him like i did before ''our love faded' lol but anyways my ex did that to me and it sucked because he was a good guy and then all of a sudden he stopped talking to me i tried to talk to him but he said the little words..<br>  i think you should still talk to her....just because yall broke up doest mean yall cant talk.......wouldn't you rather her break up with you in stead of her living a lie.....|`|QAiyrzZbaa	get over her and if you have it in you, make her jealous then she might want you bac, but if you do make her jealous, i warn you, do not make some other gurl think you like her cause from then on she will think you like her and puttin your last name with her first,i schould no im a gurl|`|AA11637779	You should ask her why. If you knew that answer, you'd have a better idea if there was a chance for you two in the future.|`|21g5bHfvaa	Thats just a nice way to say your done without the old "its not you its me".  Usually it doesn't mean they really want to be friends but they also don't want any hate toward them for breaking up.|`|DBYxsNe2aa	No you are not doing the right thing. If I were you i would text her back unless you want to gain an enemy!|`|IamqdTRmaa	I said the same thing to my ex.. I just wanted a break, I went back to him and we're happy together now.|`|yn58CCYlaa	just be friends date other girls and forget!|`|Mz8tua19aa	Here is the best help possible man..   move on, did u know there r so many girls out there|`|uFT0k30Kaa	Nope. Other than finding another girl and make her super jealous. That **** works!|`|4MyurRdDaa	fuking bitchh|`|76nTvO4iaa	Leave her alone - don't contact her.<br>  <br>  Get out there and meet someone new!|`|TNOQk3Fjaa	Its hard to say she can just be confused and need some space and maybe want to come back at a later time. She could of found someone new (sorry to say) and maybe she likes him alittle more. Or she does just want to be friends which does suck but I wouldnt do the friend thing it doesnt help all that much when you have to watch her date someone else. You are doing the right thing she said what she wanted to say so move on why waste your time if she no longer wants to share her heart with you. You can find better. Best of luck to you.|`|707gOCvbaa	What a lousy disrespectful way to dump someone. How did people communicate before text messaging? She could of called you? Someone like that is not worth pursuing. She was cowardly for her actions and could of been more upfront with you. I doubt she would want to be friends but she's trying to look like a saint so you do not hate her. Leave her alone and find someone that will treat you with respect.|`|aKkDWz5Waa	dude there r other fish in the sea. dnt stay stuck on sth thatll ruin ur life. i say, let it rest nd dnt even think that ull get back together, try to just see her as a friend, nd who knows, maybe someday shell confess to missing u, it might even be a day u realize u dnt really wanna go back. but dnt even think about that for now just shift ur focus and live.|`|eY49t8Swaa	no shes basically sayin f*ck off|`|xqChbB2raa	you know, I made the same mistake when I was 17, this girl, who was the first one ever to take an interest in me, after 3 weeks told me 2 days before my 17th birthday that she liked another guy.  I never went out with her, but I did go to a party less than a week before this happened.  In fact, to make it worse, she didn't even tell me over a text message, she told me at a football game in front of at least 20 people, and before that, she asked her best friend's boyfriend to 'break the ice' for her so that I was prepared for it.  And he wasn't even that nice about it.  <br>  <br>  but anyway, she told me she wanted to still be friends, and in my own stupidity, I thought that meant that I would still hang out with her and her friends, we just wouldn't be boyfriend/girlfriend anymore.  Well, I learned the hard way that was not the case.  As much as I hate to say it, when a girl says 'I still want to be friends', she is telling you in a nice way to get out of her life and leave her alone<br>  <br>  Trust me, if she has to do it over a TEXT MESSAGE and not even have the decency to tell you in person, she doesn't deserve to have you, and the worst thing you can do is fall into her trap.  Just walk away, it's the only solution to the problem<br>  <br>  and yes, there is hope, just not with her, trust me, it's living hell, I know, but once you find someone else, you will forget all about her, I survived and you will too|`|bAnyRNZUaa	1) There is no hope.  Plus you DO NOT want a female friend, especially like that<br>  <br>  2) You are doing the right thing but not responding. Don't listen to these nitwit young girls telling you otherwise.<br>  <br>  3) IF you do feel the need to write something back, make it threathening, like "You are dead to me....and if I see you again, you'll be dead to everybody else..."|`|YzDHh28Haa	ask her if there's a new guy. i think she have a new guy, cause she will not tell you that for no reason. OR she realized that most relationship nowadays don't last forever so she told you to be just friends cause she can't afford to loose you..<br>  <br>  best way to solve that is to confront her..<br>  <br>  hope it will help.|`|k8HVgVdnaa	there might not be too much hope after she says lets be friends. and you did the rite thing i mean you guys are not togethor anymore.|`|sFfyZOJNaa	Move on. Why would you want to be with someone that does not want to be with you?|`|nFqKqrt6aa	i think you are doing the right thing|`|EtXktTgbaa	dude. you lost man. you can always try... but i mean that whole speach goes along with "its not you it's me"|`|gtKkCAAkaa	everything needs time.|`|PaPXlWwIaa	probably not
mJQxbFEpaa	That's cool that you want to do that, it shows that you are a good friend. Start a convo by asking a question like... why do you think this works that way or why do you think people do this? It will get the ball rolling and she will give her input. Feel free to add your own thoughts, but make sure it is just a discussion and not an argument.|`|NTUr0t3haa	It sounds like it's already happening. Anyway, let her be intellectual and follow along.|`|MulZfdzQaa	Talk about more intellectual things.  Even if its about some garbage entertainment news, there is always social aspects to it that can evolve to an intellectual discussion.
mXFiSe2taa	I NEVER UNDERSTOOD THAT. MY MOM WAS LIKE THAT. I WOULD NEVER DO THAT TO MY KIDS. JUST BLOW IT OFF AND REMIND YOURSELF TO NEVER BE LIKE THEM.|`|ReNmXYiKaa	not my parents, I love em to death.  But most of my friends talk about their parents that way, which is hard for me to believe since I have such awesome parents
BQulC2Taaa	It a terrible situtation to me in... When yu parents are not fighting you should approach them together and tell then how their fighting affects you...This is really an interruption of your growing up live in the real world..The need some help themselves....Hang in there and I really hope thing change for you between your parents...You have my blessings..I Hope you are not a really young child|`|xJEEX63Maa	I am so sorry my parents used to fight a lot but they went to this person that helps parents with that and that helped... Well it's been a long time so I guess you have already decided on that just tell them that they need to go to a consular beacuseyou love them both and you dont want to end up with having to go to house to house and say please good luck!

wQDILKHtaa	Perhaps no-one is interested in you because you're superficial and brag about your looks and your "fat" wallet. I knew a guy like that and it was a total turn-off the way he flaunted his money.|`|a66nvk0taa	Just read your own question there. Your fat wallet etc. You could be ugly and have a fat wallet. You could be fat and have fat wallet. Maybe beside the fat wallet that money can't buy is personality! think about it|`|7fAHPUkkaa	rub one out, it's easier|`|Y9HWim3Baa	All I can suggest,without knowing you is to go to places & do things that YOU enjoy,& hopefully you'll meet people that are interested in similar things.Relax,be pleasant,attentive,kind,& don't let the women know that you have lots of money until your in a relationship with them.That way you'll weed out the ones that may not be sincere about finding a great guy.BOL to you.|`|ygccpU2paa	Looks and money won't attract a truly nice girl.  You'll end up with gold diggers and players.  Work on your attitude about yourself beyond the superficial.  Are you considerate?  Do you start out too sexually aggressive or arrogant?  Ask one of the girls who turned you down for an honest answer about what turns her off about you, then try to change how you act around women.|`|86057dc1460f70d048423070c6868d55aa	That's funny,...

e4a70e2e864a55d7cf74bfe7c41c8264aa	A few people on here, such as dsz, have the correct answer. Since it was customary for the bride to literally be "given away" by her father back in the day, people would say "congratulations" to the groom for obtaining a bride and "best wishes" to the bride in serving (for lack of a better term) her groom. Of course, this was customary waaaaay back in the day and doesn't really apply to today's society, therefore it is perfectly fine for the congratulatory wishes to go to both the bride and groom to be.|`|l43NSgHyaa	Yes, I am familiar with the different phrases and how they're suppose to be used.  I don't think this is proper etiquette getting lost in our modern society, but rather a case of getting rid of old-fashioned, outdated traditions that no longer fit with our society.<br>  <br>  The reason you say, "Congratulations" to the groom is because he's taking a wife.    The reason you say, "Best Wishes" to the bride is because she's just becoming a wife.   Other people used the examples, that the groom is winning something; therefore, "Congratulations" are in order. <br>  <br>  So, really, it's a bit sexist.  Which is why a lot of people probably don't follow it as closely anymore.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	I heard that on Gilmore Girls.  It's something only people really fickle about etiquette actually care about.<br>  <br>  There isn't logic behind much of tradition. It's just tradition. lol  It's probably an old superstition (like saying "break a leg" instead of "good luck" in the theatre)<br>  <br>  dsz is right. I just found this:<br>  ' "Congratulations" implies winning something, and so the old etiquette did not want to imply that the bride had "won" the groom, but that the groom had "won" the bride.<br>  <br>  It is entirely correct to say "best wishes" to both, and avoid the controversy.'|`|oXfvBdNHaa	Yes, this is propper etiquette, but has gotten lost over time. Someone told me congrats then my grandma told them it is best wishes, because the bride is not the one who has to go and search for a prize. Saying congratulations is like saying "hey, congrats that you could finally get a man"|`|aipChC3haa	Congratulations to the groom because he's the one who had to propose to the prize, the bride.<br>  IDK why the bride get's Best Wishes.<br>  <br>  But, this isn't too popular anymore, because now the bride has as much say as the groom, probably even more =)|`|3GHXk05saa	The bride is like a prize, so the groom is to be congratulated on winning her hand. In the old days the bride usually had little choice in the matter so it's more of 'good luck'.|`|YfxydPF5aa	I've never heard of that and as a bride to be I have received lots of congratulations.|`|kUE3Ddktaa	It's really old-school, and frankly kind of sexist.<br>  <br>  In the olden days, you said congratulations to the groom because he was the one getting "the prize" - the woman, with her virginity and her sizable dowry. You said "best wishes" to the bride because she was about to launch into the duties of being a housewife and mother.<br>  <br>  These days, weddings are a union of two equal partners. Both halves of the couple deserve congratulations and best wishes on finding their match and beginning the new chapter of their lives together!|`|cqgWkdPtaa	i've heard this in the movie "in her shoes" with cameron diaz but never anywhere else, everyone has said congratulations to me and i'm the bride lol
46e65d5635d62f518d26af30e363f9ceaa	This sounds like a novel, I can't believe at 16 you would be allowed to travel all over the world alone, I'm sure when your adoptive parents died they had designated someone to be a guardian over you till you were of age and someone to control the assets and money of their estate in the event of a death. I say you are not obligated to give anybody anything and I wouldn't do it under any circumstances because when the money, land etc is gone when you give it to someone else what are you going to live on? At 16 without workable skills or college degree you would be left out in the street do you think the bio family would want you then?    Good luck to ya|`|caExWxHbaa	yes|`|I8szWmVMaa	No, they can't. They signed those adoption papers and you let them know that they did. Your parents ( not your bio ones) gave YOU that farm. If they continue to harass you tell them you will get a restraining order. Tell them how you feel, and set down your terms. You don't have to lend them money, because its not like they gave you money. You can do what you want with your money. Oh and ask them if they would still want custody of you if you didn't have the money and the estate.|`|13dded66b3bbf7efd78d04740e1abec3aa	First - where is your guardian and / or the trustee of your estate? You bio-mom gave up all rights to you and can not drag you through this. Your guardian should be looking out for you legally. Get legal help and get this women to leave you alone.
YCuXeEvdaa	For many boys is something weird from mars or some other planet, but boys may be in front of each other naked but that shows "that you are not afraid" that you are not gay because if you were you will feel shame of people looking at you, I have a twin brother we are both 13 we hug but the difference is that we are brothers and twins and we look alike|`|7BG6eM7zaa	Boy don't feel comfortable hugging each other when a girl is around. As they mature, they should get over that.|`|2Uagp72caa	well i guess it goes to manhood. if you hug its just weird and kinda makes u look gay (no offense to anyone).  where as apparently being naked just isn't.|`|7cbIlyMeaa	its is the way they act sometimes. but it depends on the personality too.|`|wjEkyLZ6aa	It depends on the boy. My friend Mark will hug ANYONE. He even hugged a male band teacher. The teacher, however, did not hug back. Mark was a sad little boy. But I digress, some guys hug, while others don't.|`|I2iNfYCyaa	I've seen boys hug before..nothing weird.|`|B4nujMnlaa	Guys just think it's not cool to hug. Like they'll do the guy hug where they just grab hands and give each other a pat on the back. But that's it. I mean my boyfriend will hug me any day but not most guys.|`|PmYpNontaa	nobody ever taught them????|`|5810e6ffd53a5af2e1a161b4d5ccf2e3aa	Some do and some don't. It is all in the way they are raised or male pride.|`|ntGOF9Wmaa	how would you feel if you saw two guys hugging each other or holding hands?
ed9c52fcc32bc21499c8007eec999f5faa	The child *never* receives the child support.  Child support is due only to the custodial parent.<br>  <br>  I can't be detailed, because you didn't provide enough information.  I assume if child support is still being paid at 18 that you're still in school?  High school or college?  Did you choose to move out on your own or did you have to for educational reasons (ie you're attending college in another city and it’s too far to commute)?  Regardless, the support still goes to Mom.  If she chooses to give it to you fine, if not, there’s nothing *you* can legally do.  But if she’s not providing support, Dad can go down and request that it be terminated.  That does not mean he will be ordered to pay it to you--he won't.  Although he may be ordered to pay tutition to the school (note: this is only if the court has already ordered that he pay support during college, and in MD they can only order that if Dad voluntarily agreed to do it).|`|bGcUdRkyaa	yes your oppose to send child support if whatever parent doesn't live with the child, he has to pay then, but not you.<br>  <br>  he can use the money from child support, if hes only with you, but with his dad, he can't use that money though.|`|dTsD8X6vaa	yep soory!
KNpUc7wKaa	You have all right to be concerned at this point. From my point of view I don't understand why a 38 year old man would have tailored his myspace account to only speak to one girl.... and a fake myspace account in top of that. And if he lied about his age on there he has probably lied about his age to this girl since the begining. There is no other reason.  <br>  <br>  The next question is what would a 32 year old man want with a minor? A girl who was in high school at that time? It obviously wasn't for marriage reasons. And why now, is he getting back in touch with her? Did he ever mention her to you before? How did he react when you confronted him with the age calcualtion? Did he avoid eye contact? Did he figit, turn red, scratch his face, try to guilt you or make you feel stupid you would react to something like that? If yes he might have been lying or be trying to hide something.<br>  <br>  I can't say if his stories about his friend are a cause for concern. Perhaps you should find out if he is still friends with this person. If he is, find out which one, you don't want your nieses, nephews or future potential children around him. And if it would put your mind to ease perhaps you should do a background check on your husband and make sure he has not been charged with rape. <a href="http://www.familywatchdog.us/" rel="nofollow">http://www.familywatchdog.us/</a> gives you a list of all charged sexual offenders.<br>  <br>  Now about the comment your mum and brother made. I do find it particularly disturbing they said he was staring at the young girls. However, did you mum or brother say he was jsut out of it that day? Were the girls doing something crazy to attract attention? Are there any other reason that your mum and brother would comment on this? Like do your mum not like him? <br>  <br>  Eitherway, I would be concerned too. I wish I could say that it is all okay but I can't. I would just keep my ears and eyes open. I would also get in touch with a councellor or someone at the women's shelter. They have much knowledge about these things and can help you figure out what to do. I dunno if you would want to, but if you told the girl that your husbands real age is 38? Just be aware that if you email this girl you might be in for a nasty suprise and your husband might become very angry at you. Please talk to your mum about this too if you two are close. <br>  Good luck.|`|4fC6EJWfaa	Well he is 17 years older than you and he was 17 years older than this girl when they dated, should give you a clue.|`|RBQrgByeaa	Yeah, get away -- because if you have kids with him, he will rape the kids.|`|PeMpDAbraa	Not only could he have done something then by why is he trying ot contact them now? I would divorce and bring a print out to court. Sounds disgusting.<br>  <br>  Hope you don't have kids together!!!<br>  Worse case..he does like them young...<br>  Best case..which isn't good...he's looking to cheat.|`|iD4ejChZaa	he loves young girls not you personally, if you think he raped any in the past --you better move out. he'll be that way even at 50.|`|FtyLwqR5aa	I would say that he is and I would watch him very carefully around younger girls. He may be some freak who does things to kids and you not no anything. Make sure that there are no little ones left around him and go speak to an officer or something about him and let him do some investigating of him. Is he somewhat strange in bed? has he mentioned things to you in the past that might make sense now?|`|Y9HWim3Baa	I guess you can ask him flat out if he is attracted to young kids,but I would use my gut feelings on this one,since you may never be able to trust him.|`|CQsD09D6aa	I would run for the hills. BTW why are you married to a 38 yo and you are only 22? He could be your father.|`|2j84hXguaa	You've only got 8 mos invested. Split now while the gettin is good.|`|CWVBfaPwaa	I would be very very cautious. Doesn't sound right at all!|`|6QPYi3wcaa	ur over reacting|`|29hcn9JRaa	I wouldn't go as far out their to claim he is a out and out pedophile, however he certainly may have some serious issues that would scare me to the point of having many questions and doubts regarding his character. Did you not see all the many quirks and smears in his character before marrying him? I don't see how you could have made these observation all in this short amount of time? However I will give you the benefit of the doubt, now maybe it is past time to looking at the real man who you married versus the man who you thought you married.|`|rLLyJtqNaa	A quick answer to your subject question:  Is he a pedophile? It depends on your state; in my state the age of consent is 16.  If you believe that he is the "friend" that committed those heinous acts and if he's has been convicted, then you should be able to find something here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nsopr.gov" rel="nofollow">http://www.nsopr.gov</a><br>  <a href="http://www.familywatchdog.us" rel="nofollow">http://www.familywatchdog.us</a><br>  <br>  If you should happen to discover that he is an offender, move out!  Consult an attorney; you may be able to get your marriage annulled as you were misled in regards to his criminal status.<br>  <br>  Otherwise there's not much can be done (legally) about communications with young girls... .<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, this is a somewhat complicated situation with other layers of issues (i.e. honesty, fidelity, etc.).<br>  <br>  Somethings you need to reflect upon:  <br>  <br>  How long did you know him before your were married?   Was he married before?  How long?  What was the age of his previous wife (or wives); (you can go to the county clerk's office to get this information). Whose idea was it to get married?  What was his behavior during that time?  Did you go out a lot?  If so, who pick the destination and how did he behave when you were there  If you didn't go out a lot why not?  Did you spend most of your time at his place or yours?  If you spent most of the time at your place, why?  How many of his friends do you know?  How does he behave around them?  What do they think of him?<br>  Have you met the family, yet?  How do they behave around you?<br>   <br>  If you've realized that everything/situation seemed to be set up for his convenience and/or he seems to have a second life (vague references such as unnamed friends/relatives are not good signs) then you should really reconsider your marriage.  <br>  <br>  It's clear that he likes young women; when will you cross the threshold of not being young enough?|`|wuZXqYPGaa	wow ya thats messed fricken up... i bet u didnt expect all this Sh*** after gettin married. i think he is still caught up in his past and gettin away with lookin so young and gettin younger chicks.(aka 17 yr old wtf) but now that he is gettin older.. he realizes hes prob gotta lie bout his age to still talk to these chicks which is NOT COOL. all guys like young girls, but there r parts where it seems like there is definately some creepiness... i mean if he cant fess up to half the crap he is pullin.. and all his lyin to deny his past... then why stay with him?|`|Nhscv0aSaa	my answer to this? you need to either A. inform him that your red flags are going up and he needs to explain himself, and if he refuses go to be B. which is inform the police, they might have a record already on him or they might not, either way something needs to be done. sometimes the man we marry aren't they man we wanted to marry.|`|4iUhdKKiaa	Most men like younger women but ur husband is of concern because he hangs with people whom rape kids and may be a rapist.  I would check his back ground but In my gut i think he has it in him and its only a matter of time before he acts if not already.  speak to the police and if its something 2 this-dont look back.|`|tjLbXhtEaa	whatever you do do not have children with this man <br>  You may want to just get  a divorce since it is obvious you don;t trust him anymore. <br>  Really sucks but you are still young and can find a decent man .|`|bvnSjdmeaa	not to be mean but he sounds like a creeper! for him to lie to his wife that way is WRONG! i think you are right about the age with the other girl...make sure he is not doing anything now!! good luck ..|`|zhXEM105aa	Do you have any more evidence and maybe you should hire a private investigator.|`|fHJcGAyTaa	Wether hes a pedo or not hes very deceitful so ditch him now.|`|GtPnXzPAaa	he sounds like a creep and he's a liar. Time to get rid of him.|`|Df3gXIykaa	MEGANSLAW.COM see if he's a registered sex offender, dont provoke him too much as u may become a victim, and/or contact your local police for records and see if he's on file|`|AXXDyKecaa	that's nasty!!<br>  i think he's a pedophile!!|`|XtjCIWUcaa	kick him to the curb!<br>  your too good for him.|`|DTxQ2Tpvaa	since you are a newly wed, you probably have not developed a lot of infrastructure(house, car, bank accounts, investments) with this man. The suspicions, if strong, will eventually lead to divorce so it's best to find out early. The earlier the better because if you cut all emotional ties early, you won't cry when you know he is pedo. If you don't cry, then he won't be able to take advantage of your sign of weakness But spy on him more. Befriend the myspace friend without mentioning your husband. Gain her trust and eventually tell his friend on myspace that he's your husband and he's married. See how she reacts. see if your husband feels guilty when he finds out you are friends.|`|GFHRpDE4aa	No, your over reacting, you need to calm down and think, maybe he liked the girl 6 years ago and she was to young so he had to lie, and he didn't want her to find out his age now because that would just turn into crap.<br>  If your mom and brother were serious about him checking out young girls then you need to ask him what is going on, but i bet they just exadurated the story, but i think you need more evidence to make any big decisions.<br>  <br>  so just chill and everything will work it's self out.  hope i helped and good luck, i doubt your husband is a petifile.|`|ItRr3x51aa	OK there is something REALLY messed up about him, sorry. I think he is a pediphile. Maybe you should ask your mom and brother who were with him what to do, but before that, try to mention it very, very subtly, so he won't be too suspicious and see if you can figure out what the case is. If it doesn't work after you've tried a bit, just talk to him about it nicely. Ask your mom and brother for help though.<br>  Good luck.|`|SW7EfdCGaa	I believe that really you have no choice but to wait and gather evidence that will either convict him or clear him. Go hardcore and often though his phone, wallet, computer, personal effects, stay close to his friends and him (you could even go as far as to get a detective) but be careful not do draw attention! If you feel unsafe move quickly and continue to follow you gut intinct as a general rule if you feel something is wrong there proably is (it could even be that he is having a affair so something way off)! Another thing that you didn't mention but should consider is your sex life how is it, non exist or always? Talk to a very VERY close friend and let her know what is going on so that she to can keep an eye on you!<br>  <br>  Stay safe|`|Sbx0h0eSaa	Listen to me, I don't mean to scare you but this man is sick. <br>  He's a liar and do not think for one second he will not go behind you back again. HE WILL! Please I hate to hear this so much about nice women in relations with sick men. You're 22 yeah, but 5 yrs ago you were 17 too.<br>  He's 16 yrs older, NOT that age is a "big deal", but it is when he obviously has an attraction to underage girls. It's gross and not normal. What's his sign? Please just leave hun! Trust you gut feeling. You know, you should try posing online as an underage and see if he takes the bait. He will. And I am so sorry. Get out of while you can!|`|rv8fbSmeaa	Well this sounds like a very scary situation and one i would take seriously. If you have doubt's about it then I would trust your gut instict and listen what it has to tell you. People just have that sense about other people and are usually right. Not only that but you are only 22 and he is 38 WOW. I don't mean to sound harsh but he picked you young to. That should send up a red flag in itself. I would encourage you to either hire a investigator to investigate him, maybe look on the website in your area see if they post a sex offender list to see if he may have been on it. You just never know about one's past anymore. If he was a pedophile he obviously wasn't going to go tell you because you would of run the other way.. right? Do some investigating. Make a decision and stick with it.|`|JVYs2TCpaa	I say get rid of him. Hes on myspace talking with other woman and he dated a minor a few years ago. I would dissolve the marrige and get the hell out of there. Also seem like he may not stay with you very long. In a few years you may be too old for his liking.|`|S11uwOKxaa	wow this is really something lying will get him nowhere you have the prove right there in front of your face the myspace,the story lines, it all seems to shady you need to talk to him but not upset him bc he might take it the wrong way just ask for the truth.|`|uN0mUZOzaa	You know this answer. get help or get out|`|CxsIa7kOaa	Wow, If it were me I'd leave him.<br>  He's lying and he really has no reason to have that myspace and to be lying about his age. He sounds like a sleazy guy that just wants to screw a bunch of underaged girls. I don't think he's ready to grow up and be in a marriage. The whole thing is just creepy. Down the line  he sounds like a guy whole would mess around behind your back. He's a major pedophile.
GFEWLxeiaa	Well, if you won't listen to your parents you won't listen to me, but I agree with your parents.  You need to listen to them, because they love you and have your best interest in mind.  If you and your boyfriend really love each other in a mature way the relationship will still be there regardless of where you live.  Finishing your education needs to be the priority for both of you for the next four years.  After that you'll have the rest of your lives to be together.|`|ea207ed5b6ef75b8f1362932a6abf174aa	So, what exactly are you looking for here?  You need to make a grown-up decision, do you want your parents to help with school, or do you want to move in with your boyfriend and try to eck it out surviving with only a high school education and 18 years old?<br>  <br>  It seems to me you have made your decisions and you are trying to find someone to tell you that you are right.
bynqfZaBaa	What? Just sounds like girls having fun with the telephone. I play games like that all the time when i'm at my friend's :)|`|RnQFwIuUaa	It sounds very confusing. I think they are all playing games and you should steer clear of them. Her friend may be scheming to humiliate you or use you. Be careful.|`|18b84deee094bfde6827a2c3ca051e3eaa	I would be confused too. They're probably just playing games with you. Laugh it off with them. Go to her best friend, and be like, "Hahahahaha. Seriously?"|`|AA11179568	try revising the question <br>  cant understand a lot<br>  <br>  but the way i understands it the friend seem like has something <br>  ishy i think the friend likes you<br>  or maybe just dont want you to be hurt<br>  in one way or another it is good to follow her friend's advice|`|TawYWc4waa	yur confused...and u definitely showed that in your description cuz im now confused out of my mind...so ill just answer from what little i understood:<br>                              find a new girl|`|i9BgSAMjaa	this is life|`|vrnqXJmTaa	Dude chill...that's how its gonna be for the rest of ur life...|`|5fHG6e4Uaa	wow! that was confusing but it sounds like her friends? i think? wants attention from u.

I hope so! Stop playing games with people and you might be able to see things more clearly|`|jKph4peTaa	wtf sorry i didnt get the question|`|wgHuJxtwaa	welcome to earth|`|Gvs77y09aa	Watch it, the girl you like could be using her best friend to try and see if you'll get with her (best friend) instead of actually proving that you really like her (girl you like). On the other hand, if people say that that one girl likes to take guys from her friends then you might just be another victim. She could just be really jealous. You never know in the world of girls. Of course I should know.|`|EiGc45Zwaa	Um..u realize you sound more confused than any of other girls? first get your priority straight. who do you like....and when you get the answer, go after that girl. dont worry abt the other girl. talking to the girl you like will help u lot, instead of talking to her best friend. Its fine if u wanna make the girl u like jealous but the girl you like will think you are not interested in her adn she will move on. so i advice go after the girl you like.<br>  Wow, this is making me confused....|`|VOlFnLbXaa	answer<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AiYqpOwEUwd2f52KtTuW.n7sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222024220AA4TwHC">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|yH7OsFm8aa	You totally just confused the crap outta me .|`|dyFo9oE4aa	Hmmmm.. this sounds confusing, I would wait it out - don't jump to conclusions just yet.

Personally, it's a turn off when a guy tries to steal  me away from boyfriend.  The goal is to try and persuade her that you are MUCH better than him.  I have a feeling that they both may be messing with you though sweetheart.  When best friends are in cahoots like this, it's generally nothing more than a game.  However, it's entirely possible that her best friend might be interested.  My best friend and I both dated the same guy, he went after me and I dumped him for my ex ( <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090222194450AAhQXJ2">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a> ) and she dated him for a couple weeks.  The question I have for you is how interested are you really in either girl?  If you hadn't heard their voice before, then it may be more strictly infatuation...  My advice?  Don't call for a couple weeks, if one of them calls you make it short.  If they pursue you, then there's something there.

Realise that the relationshipis truly over. You cannot begin moving on until you completely give up on that person. Put your former lover completely out your system. Discard the last shred of hope that you may get back together.<br>  <br>  Step2<br>  Come to terms with the relationship. Once you have accepted that it is over, you are ready to make amends with yourself. Forgive yourself for mistakes you may have made. Quit staying up at night thinking "If I had only done..." because it doesn't matter now. The relationship is over.<br>  <br>  Step3<br>  Stay busy. Keep your mind occupied, and if you can't keep your mind occupied, keep your body occupied. Try not to be alone. Go out with friends, play sports, take up a new hobby. Try to avoid the routines you used to follow during the relationship.<br>  <br>  Step4<br>  Seek new experiences. The best way to forget the old is to embrace the new. Now is a good time to broaden your horizons. Find out for yourself that there is more to life than that one lost love.<br>  <br>  Step5<br>  Break the habit. This person may have been a large part of your life. You may have had daily rituals that involved him or her. Avoid situations that remind you of their absence. Now you have to find other activities to fill the void.<br>  <br>  Step6<br>  Find a healthy outlet. Write in your journal or talk with friends. Get out all those nasty feelings: They are easier to deal with when they are on the table rather than pent up inside.|`|Jusnu14oaa	im so sorry it takes time time heal a heart that got broken he just missed out on a great girl im sorry but like if u still have feelings for him u should tell him cause hes still on your mind so like youre heart will be fix cause u obbiously love him thats good good luck i know u will win him back i just know|`|zrlU5p1Haa	Try finding a new boyfriend..The only way to get over a crush is to find another crush..Me and my girlfriend broke up like 4 months ago but i still love her =/ and i just found out she doesnt like me anymore.

The best way to deal with it is to cry it out and be angry about it. If you have a journal or keep notes, you can write down every emotion that you are having. It is really soothing to write things out and vent that way. Try also to spend more time with your friends or go and get a pedicure or a manicure, that always cheers me up:)|`|0dnfyDWqaa	GET OVER IT!!!!!!<br>  that's all i can tell you sorry :/ that's all you can do....<br>  <br>  <br>  just forget it go out and do stuff i guess...or stay in bed all day for a couple of days and watch movies and eat ice cream that'll cheer you up.<br>  <br>  and whatever you do don't go out and find someone new just because you are sad that's the dumbest thing ever....someone will come to you when the time is right don't go find someone new just because you're sad it would be terrible....being single is better anyways haha|`|ygccpU2paa	Remind yourself that it's his loss, not yours.  Since he can't appreciate you for who you are, then he doesn't deserve you.

I never really got a reason from him for dumping me, but that was three years ago and now I'm happily married to a great guy. It's hard at the time, and it's ok to cry, and be angry and confused, but in time you will get over it and find someone wonderful. The worst thing you can do is let him know how much he's hurt you. Do you have anyone you can talk to? Getting your confidence up is the best way to heal fast. Put on some clothes than you feel great in and go out with some friends, and have a good time. If you look like you're having fun, and you're a positive person who's comfortable with yourself, people will want to be around you, guys included! Learn to love yourself and then a nice guy will just be a bonus. You don't need a guy to make you happy, especially one who makes you feel like crap! <br>  <br>  Hope you feel better soon, good luck!|`|0DdSoi4Maa	All you can do it move on & I know it's tough.  But you just want to stay positive & do things that won't make you depressed.  Like working out & just hang out with the people you love.  I'm in the same boat as you, I just tell myself well I was happy b4 him, happier with him but I'll just go back to being happy for now & one day he'll come back or I'll find someone else but until then I'm going to get out there & do fun things.  When one door of happiness closes, another opens just remember that!|`|gecvWl5iaa	Designate a night to yourself so you can heal:<br>  <br>  1.Go over your past memories with your ex. Write them down if you need to. <br>  2. Write a detailed list of things that you loved about your ex. You want it to make you cry so you can get out all of your sadness. <br>  3. Write a detailed list of things that bothered you about them.<br>  Get as mean as you can. You want to unleash your anger about the whole situation.<br>  4.Write down all of your emotions and feelings. Say them out loud if you need to.<br>  5.Listen to cheesy sappy songs and watch chick flicks that make you cry. <br>  6.Eat your favorite junk foods. Ben and Jerry's ice cream is a popular favorite.<br>  <br>  Then the next day:<br>  <br>  1. Dispose of the lists that you made as a sign of freeing yourself from the burden of heartbreak. Burn them, rip them, throw them off a bridge, whatever it takes to get rid of them for good.<br>  2.Go and hang out with your friends. <br>  Do what makes you happy: Go shopping, get your nails done, go tanning, hang out in the park, go out to eat, go clubbing, or whatever you like to do for fun and will keep your mind off of your ex.<br>  <br>  and whatever you do..DO NOT dwell on the fact that you were dumped. <br>  <br>  You had one night to cry about it and to be sad about it. But you've got your whole life ahead of you. You've got other people to see and to hit on :].<br>  Make a list of things you always wanted to do, but couldn't because of your ex, and do all of them.<br>  <br>  Most importantly:<br>  Be happy!

Lets say that I'm no expert but those boys are usually really good friends and will defiantly not "play" you. Although he may be a goody two shoes, or a nerd, it doesn't really matter, usually those type make the sweetest boyfriends.|`|Bm9x9ydxaa	Good if you like him. Don't like the bad boys!|`|mQPTqzeAaa	Ask yourself - & what is so wrong with that? Then he probably won't hurt you. Then your parents might like him. & hey - who cares what others think?

2o3BHgCCaa	There are alot more factors than just carat weight when it comes to buying a diamond.<br>  Having said that the ring does seem too expensive, especially at the colour they have listed it as. The clarity is good though, as it the fact that it is made from platinum (which is double the price of pure gold).<br>  It doesn't tell you the dimensions of the diamonds either, so you don't know how well cut they are...<br>  I think you should keep looking.|`|l43NSgHyaa	That's actually a pretty decent price for a 1 carat ring.  I'm wondering what the quality is, because top quality 1 carat rings are usually a bit more pricey.   But, that's a good price.   However, I would go to a local jeweler  first (not a chain) and compare prices and quality before buying this one.  <br>  <br>  Just do yourself a favor and shop around....even just browse.  Look at rings, hold them in your hand, get the info on them and see what they look like in real life and just not online.  <br>  <br>  If you feel like this is the best deal, then buy it.  But, don't jump on the first good deal you see.  Plus, you can bargain down the price at some local places.    It's always better to do your homework first!|`|PBdPD748aa	carat weight is only one of the few things that are going to put up or down the price of an engagement ring.<br>  <br>  its a FACTOR, but wont fully determine the price. Yes you can have a 1 carat for probably $200 but the colour of the diamond will be very low (which means the diamond will look yellow) and the clarity will also be low (which means black specs will be noticable throughout the diamond).<br>  <br>  All these come into play when deciding a diamond that best suits your needs. Do you really want a big diamond with terrible quality that doesnt sparkle? Or do you want a very small diamond but shines with briliance? Or somewhere in between?<br>  <br>  Have a look at the different qualities of diamonds you can buy. My diamond is a 1.2 carat D colour and it was something like triple the cost of that ring you're looking at now - and yes it was very good for the price!!!<br>  <br>  Just be prepared to sacrifice something whether it is colour, clarity or carat! Personally, i think the colour should be of the most importance, but everyones different!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AW1dCzH0aa	First of all, you have to take into account that with bluenile.com you won't be paying sales tax.  That will save you some money.  Also, these are GIA certified diamonds - the most reputable diamond certification company out there.  All those diamonds at Zales, Kay, etc. are NOT GIA certified.  That tends to mean the quality at places like Zales, etc. is not going to be as good as bluenile.com.  Also - this is set in platinum.  You can hardly buy just the platinum setting (without the stones) for $1500, so I think that first poster must have one in white gold.  I doubt she has a platinum setting with 1 carat total weight diamonds for $1500, unless she got lucky and bought from a place going out of business.  <br>  <br>  I'd try to find this same ring in white gold.  This one is 1 CTW and white gold from bluenile.com:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bluenile.com/princess-cut-diamond-ring-platinum_6245?nav1=jewelry_segment.jsp&metal_filter=white&sort=LTHP&catid=138&set_shape=" rel="nofollow">http://www.bluenile.com/princess-cut-dia...</a><br>  <br>  I don't think this ring is too expensive for what it is, it's pretty good quality, GIA certified diamonds, and a platinum setting.  But, I think you'd be better off with white gold!  Good luck!|`|b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	Well, it is set in platinum, so that is part of the price. The diamonds are H in color, which is not great. It seems to me to be a fair price considering everything.<br>  <br>  Edit: If this ring was a 1 carat in one diamond as opposed to the 3 that it is, it would be much more expensive. Diamond TCW is different.|`|Xpj8Mn2laa	I think it is a good price -  because it is set in Platinum - that will jack the price up. Beautiful setting though.  Got mine from Angus and Coote - when they had 50% off everything!! Saved $2,000. Maybe wait till end of financial year sales.... can usually get a good deal then. :)|`|JtEBaOdjaa	I'd set it in white gold (10K - it's more durable than 14K or 18K but also cheaper).  And possibly cut down on the diamond sizes. I'd hate to wear something that was worth that much. I'd be worried about damaging or losing it every day.<br>  But for what you are getting it is a good price. And bluenile is a really good site. GREAT reputation.<br>  You could also check out pawn shops (yes they are perfectly fine to go get jewelry from) and jewelry stores near you.  They may have something similar on sale or clearance.|`|29gHY4U6aa	Platinum costs $1187 per ounce! I LOVE my platinum ring. I think that's a fair price for that ring. Don't forget to take into account the price of the setting.|`|aipChC3haa	That ring is totally gorgeous, but you a ring very similar to that for WAY less at Sears.|`|0LSuFk4Qaa	Yes thats way to much. I got a 1.25ct princess cut diamond and we only paid 1700 zales outlet in lancaster, pa|`|sCnksozaaa	that is a gorgeous ring  but it is too expensive
3OL7vVLuaa	Well -- is he truly clingy or is he just a nice, sweet guy? From the way you describe him, he sounds pretty nice! Don't dump him for some cool guy who's acting like he could take you or leave you -- that may be a challenge -- but in the end, don't you just want to be w/ someone who's honest and sincere and who actually likes you? Sounds like that's what you have -- forget the challenge! That's just a game -- honestly and someone who is "for real" That's what you want in a boyfriend :-)|`|DEaso3GMaa	when you date guys with only a certain quality then you are being picky, and when you are being picky you miss out on other things, and other guys, that might end up being better than what you want. so give your boyfriend some time, and you might end up loving him. but if you still don't , then you can break up with him.|`|tnQOy5kdaa	If I were you, I'd tell my boyfriend what about him you don't like. For Instance, you say you don't want a clingy guy, so maybe tell your boyfriend he's being too clingy. Try to be nice about it so he doesn't get the impression that you are unhappy in any way. You will need a few weeks before you decide whether to break up with him or not, but think about it. Just because he's not exactly what you want doesn't mean you don't want him|`|v2bBVWyfaa	well in my experience if you dont like the guy...give it alittle more time and the sparks dont fly break it off...cuz your just going to hurt him the longer you drag it on if he really likes you...and you will be wasting your time|`|cXsFxAklaa	if you're feeling uninterested, don't drag yourself down and get back out there.<br>  <br>  if you still have ffeelings for him, give it a little while and i fthings don't shape up break up with him. good luck!|`|OkPHgHJ9aa	Try talking to him and telling him you need your space and you dont like really clingy guys. If he doesnt understand that then **** him. You can find someone else.|`|c62vyUYUaa	If he's too much for you, think break up with him. I think my bf is the same as yours, but I like mines like that.

JhvqUvlsaa	Well how do you know when you haven't asked? Ask a couple of your friends anyway and see if they'd like to go. Couldn't hurt!|`|gYuJUyvvaa	Just go, and you can sing as loudly as you want :)|`|IfOTZhQyaa	First off never assume anything, ask and make sure that they won't go. What if they do go just to keep you company. If they won't go then find someone that will. there's no specific number of friends that one should have so make new ones and go with one of them. If you have no choice go alone and have fun. Friends are good to have but you should not depend on them for everything. They will disappoint you, they all do and that's ok.|`|RUkf4ND0aa	sometimes i have tht problem too... just ask them anyway. but if they dnt wana go; maybe theres some other people in your school that might want to go or are already going. so ask around, or ask certain people tht look like they would be into tht band. even if the people seem weird, ask them anyway bc then you wnt go alone and you might be surprised at how nice they are.|`|X8REBP52aa	enjoy the night alone. this will give you a chance to meet people who share your interest in the band. And don't be afraid of seeming like a loser, most people at concerts are really nice and open for a conversation|`|16RD8khoaa	go alone..it thought might seem horrible but trust me you meet lots of cute guys and you have something to talk about.|`|EjanokPfaa	Rape them brutally. Make them enjoy it. Only stop if they agree to go with you.
QGrIn7MXaa	obviously he does, i mean some of those thing like holding the door would be polite but most of all of them he is going out of his way to show that he likes you|`|Xi0obMUEaa	I would say he might have something for you, but you want know unless you ask or he tells you.<br>  <br>  If he acts the same next time you see him, ask him, do you have feelings for me.|`|22eb312dbb14b4b8f995bc33606eb782aa	heheheh,   Id say he likes you, mostly due to the Freudian slip, it is hard to tell though sometimes they are just being kind.  Men baffle me, ask him outright, just to be sure.|`|d8MvSJr4aa	NO HE HATES YOU AND WANTS YOU BABIES!! <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  LOL JK nah! he really likes you,hes head over heels for you.|`|fNctrQ4Haa	Obviously....he likes you girl....go for it!.....if you LIKE HIM BACK.|`|1BaeFYnEaa	Oh..

d8MvSJr4aa	Well am a guy and I ..............kind  of...........like it.<br>  But I guess some guys dont like it on account of the fact that is sticky and gets in their lips. And maybe their mates might make fun of them and say "You are wearing lipgloss you HOMO!!!" lol|`|5iZEX0p0aa	well helloo babe:) well i can tell you now i dont hate it when u have lip  gloss on cuz its not like it tastes bad or like you said its not sticky lol i guess some brands make them too sticky or too wet and like makes the guy not really comfortble kissing the girl..thts my opinion lol|`|1BaeFYnEaa	When clean lips kiss glossy lips, they feel sticky, or oily and they taste gross!  So that makes a guy to try not to "kiss too hard".<br>  And guys are afraid of not getting lipgloss on their lips. Because that makes them look ridiculous and un-manly. Any guy respects his masculi nity. How would you feel to have to run with a fake moustache on the street?<br>  Do you honestly think that's complicated? It's common sense!|`|wy25UY33aa	most guys are just a**holes<br>  <br>  like that jason guy you love<br>  <br>  JK JK<br>  <br>  idk<br>  <br>  GL
mRTFUUayaa	Ok, fun games:<br>  -At this one I went to there was a word game. It would say something like, she controls the weather and the answer is Mother Nature. Or a hard iridescent rock and the answer is Mother Pearl. Get it? All answers have mother in them.<br>  <br>  -Also, you could have diapers and then put like different melted candy bars and people have to smell them and guess what they are.<br>  <br>  Another game is you split everyone up into teams of 3-5. If you have a big group, just split them up into tables and ask them to pick representatives. You  then give the 3-5 people balloons (maybe blue for a boy) and it's like a relay. One person blows up the balloon as big as pregnant persons stomach and puts it under their shirt, then the next person and so on. The winning group then goes against each other, minus the relay part. <br>  <br>  You could have different baby foods and blind fold the people and they have to guess what food it is.<br>  <br>  Another is you have baby bottles with milk or water or whatever and each person gets one. It's a race to see you finishes first.<br>  <br>  Also you could have them write down the mom-to-be and dad-to-be's name vertically and for each letter they have to think of something a baby uses.<br>  <br>  If you know the name of the baby you can have them write it vertically and have each guest write down their wishes for the baby.<br>  ex: <br>  E-eternal happiness<br>  R-restful days<br>  I-intereting life<br>  C-cool perssonality<br>  <br>  Some prizes:<br>  lotion, perfume, shampoo, etc.<br>  candles<br>  cute notebook<br>  cute picture frame<br>  jewelry<br>  just cute, relaxing stuff<br>  <br>  for food you could do stuff like baby spinach salad, baby carrots, baby corn. or you could do stuff that boys like to eat: hot dogs, sloppy joes. another thing you could do is just the food of your culture. the last one i went to the girl was hispanic so we had mexican.<br>  a cake is good too<br>  <br>  decoration could be balloons and ribbons and such.<br>  music can be anything you like to listen to. you could do only songs that have the word "baby" in the title<br>  <br>  hope i could help :]|`|RVUYBxhnaa	Well if your going traditional, then anything blue will do for the decorations. Buy blue streamers, party blowers, blue candles. If you get sick of one colour, yellow's and greens will go well too. <br>  As for the games and prizes, im going to assume you mean for young children.<br>  Children will love games like pass the parcel, blind mans bluff, statues, simon says etc<br>  As for prizes, kids will love anything. Sweets/chocolate will do wonders, but if not, you could always go to a small party shop and buy thinks such as whistles, mini musical instruments, bubbles *kids adore bubbles* etc <br>  <br>  =)|`|2sLuZJM6aa	there this one game tht was at my cousins baby shower. there were lots of diaper envelope things and whoevers smelled like baby powder one. all the others smelled like crap. it was pree fun.<br>  and some prizes could be something as simple as wine for the adults, or a stuffed animal if their are gonna be children there.<br>  some decorations would be paper baby bottles hanging on the (ceiling for ex.). <br>  food could be fruits and cakes and brownies.<br>  music could be absolutely anything.|`|8AStvxc5aa	BABY PRICE IS RIGHT-<br>  <br>  buy baby items, and have guests guess the price for each.<br>  closest guesser gets a point.<br>  player with highest pts gets a basket (mayb some body soaps and stuff)<br>  <br>  <br>  "baby who here has...?"<br>  icebreaker game where players ar given a list of baby/mothering/parenting occurences (been in labor for over 24 hrs, has more than 4 kids, had their water break at work, has twins/triplets..., has had a baby pee on them, etc), and players must find others tht match these and write down their names. first to fill up their sheet (or get a certain amount down) wins. GREAT GAME.<br>  <br>  <br>  favors-<br>  cookies or somethings personalized (lik a baby shoe shape or a rattle or something, with the name and date)<br>  a picture with the soon to be mommy|`|gGYsRXgHaa	Yahtzee will be fun becuase any number of people  can play. .|`|SrgKPAGUaa	PWAY DUNDINS AND DWAGONS|`|i0WQzVDZaa	ah well I suggest you don't play pin the tale on the baby cuz that would be bad.|`|OyOQES3paa	heres a fun but kinda gross one:)<br>  get some diapers and put a different chocolate candy(melted) in each one then pass them around and have people guess what candy each one is by only smelling them. the one who guesses the most of them right wins. add a little spice in the chocolate to trick the players:)|`|NS3BxXEmaa	One time I went to one where there was clips involved where the whole time you could try not to say the word baby if someone does each person gets maybe 1 or 3 clips to put on there shirt and if some one said the word baby people have to rush to take a clip from that person so u can not say the word baby <br>  <br>  and for the song it would be neat if u could pick a song about babies just a thought good luck<br>  hope I get the best answer I at 2% please <br>  <br>  The prizes can really be anything u want food,cleaning supplies or maybe house hold items such as cups and plates maybe even a free DVD anything<br>  hopes this helps<br>  and good luck on it and have fun|`|WEE6n2fIaa	Do things like melt some different snack size candy bars i diapers and have the guests guess what candy is in them. (dont forget to write the answers down and number the diapers) Another one is to get a decent size basket and fill it with baby things ( blanket bottle soap etc) and have the mom to be show everything thats in the basket then when shes done have everyone write down as many that they can remember down and the person with the most correct wins.( dont let the guests know whats going on before some people will cheat!!!) and as for prizes go to your local all for a dollar store and load up on cute but cheap gifts! Its worked for the last 4 showers Ive beent to.|`|BXgfLFVyaa	Uhmm a game called Dirty Diaper.<br>  Its like hot Potatoe but it's a diaper.<br>  <br>  and good prizes is like candles cute candles.. or decorative things. stuff like that<br>  <br>  hehe.my sister is having a boy too! :)|`|X0zZ43S9aa	gift for the game why not education that is good for the baby and to try decorated better with humorous posters, toys and music is seen cool
yFgXmBdsaa	When I was back in junior high I met this girl named Kim. We were young, 6th grade. I liked her but I didn’t know what to do about it because this was the typical school where you see separate groups. Our groups all got along, but we had our cliques. My squad was the one where we knew we would record for a hip-hop label. We’d usually hang out around the block and enjoy the hard-knocks as much as we can. She, on the other hand lived up the hill. Where the neighborhood stayed clean and the houses were twice the size of the houses on my street.<br>  <br>  Whenever I’d feel a close connection with her I’d see other jocks from around her block doing what they do which made me back off and feel like I didn’t belong. It’s hard for a boy from the projects ask out a girl from the burbs. I mean you've probably seen it in the movies. It’s probably why I hate watching movies like those. It hits too close to home.<br>  <br>  We were close but we still kept our distance. She got frustrated because I probably couldn’t defeat that stereotype. She eventually left me and our relationship.<br>  <br>  My family and I moved, and we never met again. We lost contact. 10 years later I found her profile on MySpace and tried to send an email. "Kim, is that you? From base line junior high?" she replied, "yeah it's me". I asked again. "You still remember me? How’ve you been? Whachu been up to?” she replied "yeah I remember you." but that's it.<br>  <br>  I know I can’t chase her down, and continue where we left off. I know I could only keep what memory I have left of her. At one point I left my quest went on a journey to find another path and where I needed to be going. If I can’t bring us together, what can I do? The answer I found was this. As much as I would love for us to be together, as much as I would love to go back to that state of happiness, I must move on. That pursuit of happiness is what drives me today. I can’t bring us together again, but I can get that feeling of happiness back into my life.<br>  <br>  Today, it's what drives me. It is my motivation. Not the happiness, but the knowledge that there is a state of happiness in front of me and I can reach it. Because I’ve felt it before.|`|RLgJStqraa	Have never had a love in my life.  Sure I have been infatuated with several girls in my life.  But it was always been a one sided thing.  I'm 34 almost 35 years of age and have never even kissed a girl.  Any girl that I have ever known has always said that I'm nice and thoughtful and caring.  But when it come to going out, OH HELL NO they won't do that.  They always come up with excuses like their busy of what ever else they can think of.  I know what the real reason is even when the deny it.  It is because I don't look the way they think I should.  No I'm not a hunk by any means of the imagination, but they won't even give me a chance to prove myself to them.  Because of this I have given up on finding a woman as a mate.  I will never be with a woman.  I have sworn to my self not to ask any of them out any more.  I mean why should I?  I would just ruin another "friendship" if I did, and I already know what the answer will be anyway.  So that's my sob story.  Thank you for "listening".|`|BZ48SqDDaa	A few months ago my fiance and I broke up. Neither of us wanted it but after a few days of spilling our thoughts and feelings about each other, our relationship, and our future we ended up saying some things that we can't take back and we called it quits. He was my first love and this has been the hardest thing I've ever had to go through. He recently got a new girlfriend and that has crushed my hopes of us getting back together. Maybe with time it will happen but I can't count on it. I'm trying to accept this and move on but it's a lot harder than I thought it was going to be.|`|wy25UY33aa	i should ask this guy out but i don't know if he likes me <br>  <br>  hes so hot(cute), funny, smart, and absolutely love his name.<br>  <br>  idk what to do because i don't know if my friend would be happy and i'm afraid of rejection.<br>  <br>  i know all of you are going to say it so.....<br>  <br>  i am desperate|`|MWIKAz9Oaa	A girl i had liked for ages wanted to experiment with me, but when it was go time...

Luckily making up with him can be quite enjoyable.<br>  <br>  However the worst problem now is he's not committed to a family life. He feel sorry for holding me back. Right now, he's pushing me away & holding me back again unconsciously.<br>  <br>  I want to have my nice family one day. What's a better ending in a relationship other than marriage? I want to look for a partner who can be with me forever, but I don't feel like changing a diff partner now (tho he's not situable)<br>  <br>  I hate this kind of choice, For now, im so tired & only feel like putting everything aside to hv a good break 1st b4 i hv energy to focus on my problems.|`|HPqCRBq8aa	My high school sweetheart. She was the one, if you know what I mean. We were close, but after high school my mother basically put me out. I mean she put me in the service, but not totally by choice. I just chose the branch. We kept in touch by mail and phone, and I came home as much as I could, but it wasn't enough. She looked too beautiful for guys not to try and talk with her. I got that letter that some soldiers get. I forget the name, but i think its the "Dear John" letter. She basically started seeing another guy and later married him. They have a child and she is miserable (according to my sister). I am married and have a child, but I am somewhat happy. Funny how life turns out sometimes.|`|Zjgmm9t5aa	The love of my life died tragically in 2000.<br>  <br>  <br>  Crazy, is that true?|`|GtPnXzPAaa	Ooh his fine a$s retired to the Phillipines.

BUFgf2S2aa	Couple of questions...are you having a church ceremony?  Most churches have fellowship halls which can also be rented for a small fee (or sometimes only a donation if you or a family member are actually members of the church itself).  ...are you having a ceremony in a public space (beach, park, etc or even your/parents own back yard) ...could you rent canopy's and have the affair catered for the same cost that would be spent to rent the town's banquet room?  How about renting out one of the banquet rooms in a nearby bigger hotel?  (Perhaps they could make a combo deal for you and out of town guests on rental fees.)   You could also arrange with a local establishment/restaurant to rent out their place for the night (or a partial) and have the reception there.  They also might do special menus for your occassion.  Do you live in an apartment complex that has a spacious party or meeting area?  (Sometimes bigger ones do have fancier places where they'll hold big meetings or resident parties.  If you don't have one for your apartment, maybe one of the wedding party has something like it?)<br>  <br>  I totally get not wanting to hold a reception in a place that holds other momentous memories for me; however, unless you actually have an alternative suggestion there isn't any need to bring it up to your mom (it'll just be another pressure filled talk otherwise).  If you can find an alternate area, however, you should really take on the expense of the reception's location yourself (with your fiance of course).  It'll be easier for the two of you to bounce back from this economy more than it will our elderly parents.  Even if she's not limited in expenses, it'd be a nice gesture since you're nixing her idea.  <br>  <br>  If you can't work yourself out of using the town reception, take heart.  It will be a different experience than those in the past, and your mother will make sure it is beautiful.  The memories you'll hold of your wedding will trump any ol' prom.<br>  <br>  Congrats on the wedding, btw.|`|1M90Aoytaa	Explain to your mom why you dont want it there, but dont rule it out, visit it as an empty hall and try an picture it as your wedding venue - i am having me reception somewhere i wnet o a college ball with an ex and i thought it would make me think about that but as soon as i saw it empty i started picturing my own style and compleatly forgot about past events after all its just a hall. if you really dont want it there consider a garden party? somewhere with a marque? church halls or hotels? Could you have the ceremony somewhere else then everyone would be travelling to the same place and the service and reception would be closer together?|`|ifgzHzA3aa	If you would like it somewhere else then you need to money up and pay for it yourself.|`|76nTvO4iaa	Have it at the banquet hall in your town.  I don't see any way around it.<br>  <br>  I know you have memories there.  Keep in mind that experiences there have made you the person your fiancee loves today.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|AA12066269	Have you checked church facilities?  Many churches have halls that can be rented for weddings.  You can also check hotels in your community that have conference rooms that would be suitable.|`|EJSdI25Naa	You are just making problems where none exist. grow up and appreciate what your folks are prepared to do for you. they could have arranged something in the back yard with self serve finger food. No "bad" memories there, eh? What about your church for the wedding. How many funerals would have occurred there? Hundreds and thousands, I bet. There will only be one wedding reception for you. Now, keep your nose out of it and don't interfere. <br>  <br>  I must advise you t grow up. In fifteen months' time, your life will change dramatically. If you are going to be a mature and dependable wife for your husband, such trivial matters must have no place in your life. That comes with maturity, and if you are not mature, then you have no basic right to get married. I thinks you should indefinitely postpone your arrangements. Your man will not understand, and if he marries somebody else he will look back in the future and bless you for saving him from one life of misery. <br>  <br>  Best wishes from Barrie O.|`|Ky3rQ3fYaa	This is your wedding and we all have those I can't tell my mom moments when it comes to our weddings (my mom took mine and ran)  It is only one day of your life and you and your future hubby should be able to look back and say that you had the a great time and enjoyed your day.  <br>  <br>  If your mother has all these talents, let her nourish them in a small place that isn't magnificant and let her make it be magnificant....it will really showcase her talents then.|`|pjbdDi2Oaa	If you feel uncomfortable being there, even if it will look completely different than it did for prom and the funeral, you probably shouldnt have it there. First off you can look at churches or hotels. Also, is the weather usually ok where you are at? I am willing to bet that you know someone who's backyard could be transformed into a great wedding. You can even rent tents in case it might rain. Other places might be a rec center or museum. Just open your mind up to strange places that might work out and it just might be amazing :)
S3X6O4xNaa	You're an idiot. She means that the day she looks back on older times and misses them, she'll break up with you... When the old days are so much better than the ones currently, she'll leave.|`|0e27a736d12fa17e74fd3387bd95aa93aa	I find it really difficult to believe you can spell nostalgic, a word you have never heard, but you can't spell other very common words used every day.<br>  <br>  In case you are serious, she probably means she is thinking of the past, either the past between you two or the past before that.|`|bmOhSNxoaa	This does not exactly mean that the day she looks back and remembers things that were better than they are now she will leave. It means that she DID look back and miss those times, and that she IS leaving.|`|3prq2nDraa	It means you need to learn how to spell.
JhWD9NJ4aa	hmm, tricky<br>  do the things that you used to do when you was really close, help you both to bond again.<br>  have conversations with him (not about the dating thing)<br>  hopefully this will get you back to your old rutine and bring back your closeness.<br>  think about the stuff what made you so close in the first place.<br>  hope i helped, good luck x :)|`|Vb8yWZyLaa	it might be hard... but maybe you should tell him that... tell him that you dont want the fight to ruin the relationship you had..

Pumpkin seeds also do the same. Sunflower seeds are high in protien and HEALTHY fats that you need to live (and help cholesterol)!|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	No they are healthy for you.

If you drink at least two liters or more of water, you should be fine. Otherwise, the salt will make you retain water and gain weight. Salt also depletes natural mineral and vitamin stores, so just add some water to dilute its effects and it should be fine.|`|F9ZP8uRcaa	No they're not, in fact they're a great source of protein.  Also they're great for giving you a pick up if you're a bit drained of energy.|`|tWvM6M0raa	no they are really healthy for you<br>  <br>  if you are addicted i would keep eating them as they are good for you<br>  <br>  mine please?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AjTnwtkCNUn89_n52cY3H7bsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222165229AAnifXI">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|OkcElrkTaa	Not really the only thing that would be wrong with them is the sodium but if you don't eat more then 3 bags full then im sure they won't hurt you.

Little known fact but they contain Mercury because sunflower fields are fertilized exclusively with Tuna.|`|l8HTrNyIaa	No! Im pretty sure they are good for you.

You are one of those people who will only refrain from doing something that is wrong if there is a law that says if you do it, then you will go to jail.<br>  <br>  I guess you can't find anyone else to cheat on your wife with. You have to make sure when you cheat on her it's with someone that will deeply hurt her and her sister. <br>  <br>  Your wife must be truly hard up for a husband in order to stay married to you. Like I said, I truly pity her. I wish I had her email address so I could tell her what a creep she's married to.|`|8a1241304d2dd7e6f5c72ab504bd5db0aa	Legally, sure. Morally? NO! You SICK PERV!!!!

xNWqqlcYaa	everytime she cancels her gym membership and orders another piece of cheesecake my heart grows fonder.|`|IPb9zjL2aa	This is common in marriage. Men just dont know they have to nurture marriage. They think they have already won and now can sit back and relax.  This is so common in why couples divorce.   Being one of these guys in the past i could not honestly tell you a way to break though without him taking it as nagging or needy.  It took my wife leaving before i actually started looking into the subject.<br>  <br>  All you can do it talk to him about and get him a Book in regards to the Subject and hopefully he will read it.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	My wife is responsive.

Oh those tangled webs we weave,.........<br>  <br>  This is about value systems, not relationships or who's hurting who? She needs to move on.|`|8RllMdADaa	She really should leave him alone. Seriously, if he did that to his wife and kids how great is he going to be to her when the newness wears off. If her marriage is really in a desperate place and she wants to leave her husband then she should do so for herself not for a guy. If she leaves for a guy and the relationship sours she will regret it.|`|GGIcWsMKaa	She's playing with fire.  She should work on her own marriage and forget this guy altogether.  There's a word for getting into another relationship when you're not even out of the first one...it's called rebound. If he truly loved her, he wouldn't be baiting her to leave her home.  She should spend some time by herself and try to figure out what she wants and who she is before jumping into another relationship full force.|`|PeMpDAbraa	You should go stay at your parents until you can find housing. Once he hears that you have actually left then maybe he'll listen. News flash though....THE GRASS ISN'T ALWAYS GREENER ON THE OTHER SIDE! And...Karma is a B****!|`|AA10450505	No. She has fallen, and her heart is broken. Seriously.|`|Ncad6d57aa	I wouldn't be incouraging them to be persuing this. They're thhrowing away their marriages because of lust. They don't love eachother. Their just happy together because both of their marriages are on the rocks. Tell both the couples to get counseling|`|KSK22vHUaa	If she wants to leave her husband, she needs to leave him for herself, not for someone else.  If the other guy is going to try to make things work with his wife, she should give him the space to let him.  He had children to think about--his being in their life is much much MUCH more important than her dating life.<br>  <br>  She's doubly heart-broken now--husband and fling.  She needs to heal herself emotionally, away from the husband she doesn't want to be with.  And she obviously DOESN'T want to be with him if she was willing to leave him for someone else--the person you spend your life with should be the person you can't find anyone better than.<br>  <br>  Get her an apartment and a few months to herself being single to heal and she'll be fine.  But you have to be solid on your own before you're going to be solid in a relationship.|`|qG2SQAPuaa	I'm sorry, but I'm not on your friends side.  When a man says that he is just there for the children, most of the time he is lying.  A man does not have to physically live with his children to be there for them.  Obviously he feels some type of connection to his wife as well.  His wife is guarding the phone...hmmm isn't it her phone.  <br>  <br>  It could be that they were both comforting one another because they were going through the same thing.|`|zHWpXWkRaa	She not the type t break up a happy home? well she broke up a home may not have been a happy one but it was one with kids no less. If these ppl really wanted to be together then they should have done the right thing and waited till BOTH was away from there spouse not just one and even then there should be time between the break up between spouses and then getting together...just in case something likes this happens where ones goes back to other. All you can do is be there for your friend but in future if she starts going after a married man or having one go after her tell her to run before things get out of hand like this.

You are probably a really nice girl, so that's why he likes you.<br>  You like him, so I think you should go out with him. Don't worry about it ending badly. (If it does end badly, there is always a way to fix it. But right now, don't even worry about it.)<br>  I think you need to have a little more faith in yourself.<br>  Stop worrying about what people think, it doesn't matter.

Honest if you really love him you need to tell him dude... i love you... i know you try to make these girls stop kissing you but you are soooo not trying hard enough... because if you i assure you that they would not keep doing it... if he loves you then he wouldnt allow them to kiss him... he has to some what allow it or they wouldnt keep doing it...and also a girl cant just kiss a guy without him kissing her back... lol... i mean if he stood back or put his hands over his lips then they wouldnt be kissing... but if he just stands there and doesnt say look you cant do this... stop kissing me! NOW! so he isnt putting a stop to it... he is allowing it to go on.|`|h0ZdSxQiaa	hes your bf then tell the other girls that.... if he cant make them stop then you should do it for him>>>>>>|`|0p9lD3Rlaa	ugh. well at least he tells them too stop <br>  u should tell their parents or punchem nxt time they kiss him|`|7ach0Dz5aa	yeaaaaa keep believing that...next they'll be raping him right...o poor him haha
cCJvsEPsaa	no period|`|nBGjPwViaa	Yes it was wrong --|`|EJSdI25Naa	You poor bloke. You are a victim in this case. So, she wanted space. You give it to her and ask another. Now she is jealous. You cop the blame.<br>  <br>  Tell you what. Leave them both behind. You go to California by yourself and meet another lady there and see what happens. Love? Yeah, It really is love when you are given all the blame and none of the rewards, isn't it? You might think you love her but you are only going to fall out of love. Do not fall for the trap. Go! And go with a clear conscience. You'll meet plenty of women wherever you are. <br>  <br>  Glad to be of assistance.|`|FyDHzellaa	If she told you she wanted space, then you don't have to ask her, but I guess it would be nice if you told her. (As in: that's the way it is). If you were going out with her full on, then it would be an inappropriate thing to do, even if you are just friends with this other woman. Unless the both women were close friends and trusted each other with each others men. It's not about you, it's more about how it would make her feel.|`|1qTNn8qnaa	If you love this woman u shouldnt be jetting of to California with another woman, thats absurd >.<...give her space but dont include other women in the picture...u dont have to be interested in this woman for ur lover to be jealous believe me in a common thing for women to feel jealous.|`|1M90Aoytaa	i cannot really work out waht you are saying - let me get this right - you live with a woman and her daughter and you love her  but are gonig to california with another woman as a friend but didnt ask the lover first? - i see why shes pissed! it might be innocent but when she told you she needed space she didnt want you to jet off with another woman - you might not be interseted in her but your love doesnt realise that - id be pissed off to!. you should go to calafornia alone, give her some space then come back <br>  i have no idea what your last sentance says!
JhWD9NJ4aa	well if it was really nothing, is it worth telling your friend about it, is it really worth the risk of sacrificing your friendship?<br>  dont tell her.|`|BeLcoS6Aaa	it sounds bad, but dont say anything!! i was in a quincianera years ago, and my best friends boyfriend grabbed me and kissed me! she was my best friend to the end, so of course i was going to tell her. well biggest mistake i made. i told her and she completely cut me off!!! but kept talking to her stupid boy friend. so i would keep my mouth shut.
x0XB2ASWaa	ask her out, but be prepared for her parents. they r not gonna like you!|`|66tpufsgaa	ask her out|`|wJGQtHuhaa	Thats fine. Personally I wouldnt date a guy 4 years older than me but your only 3 years older. So age wont matter that much.|`|IfOTZhQyaa	when you turn 16 your kind of in the middle. Your sort of to old for any one under 16 and your a little to young for anyone older. I really think your to old for her, she's still a baby but if you really like her you need to be her friend and only her friend until she gets older. I would talk to her and tell her how you feel but that you would like to wait until she is older just because it is the right thing to do. That way she knows that you like her. At lest she will be kind of your girl.|`|NpcSEJX1aa	well my first question would be will she be 14 soon and did you just turn 16..i mean are we talking 3 + a few months years apart or did she just turn 13 and your fixing to be 17.making you almost 4 years apart..now in a few years that would not matter..but it might to her parents right now..but they may be ok with you just coming around and being her bf at the house..she really is not ready to date . not just yet..remember if her parents are not going to let her date for a few years you may miss out on a lot of things guys your age will be doing..but if it don't really matter to you and you really feel something for her..just hang out with her and see what happens..please remember if sex ever come in to play make sure your protected..it just as much for you as it is for her..I know sometime teenagers..get themsleves in that mess is because they think it will stop the adults from trying to pull them apart..i have seen that happen.. but it is so not worth it.us adults can not pull true love apart... no matter how much we try.|`|X2FrjG8Laa	what your to old for her but if you realy like her go ask her parents if you could date her|`|mrysAOpGaa	youre too old for her, find someone your own age...im sorry|`|lGixx6idaa	As long as you like her for the right reasons (which it seems like you do), go ahead.  However, make sure she KNOWS that you don't plan on having sex and all that - make she she's aware that the relationship will not be just physical, and that's not what you're looking for.<br>  Keep in mind that she has thought about the age difference, too. She may not feel comfortable or something, but make sure that she is completely comfortable with you before you ask her out. Consider her feelings too! :) <br>  <br>  I think you're a good guy.  So take my advice, and go for it :)|`|cdKBkEbLaa	I see absolutly no problem with it. I'm dating a girl one year younger than me and there is a huge height difference. I think that age or height should never be a factor in a relationship. If you think its right then don't listen to what friends or family say. Follow your heart.|`|Vb8yWZyLaa	look... JUST ASK HER OUT!!! =) but get prepared to get a long *** lecture from her parents... they wont like this one bit!!! but if you really like her that much... even love her... then you should go for it... and im glad that you dont want her for sex...|`|05b8e574350cb9042ae48f65192c5811aa	ask her already =]<br>  girls love older guys|`|AA10305248	go for it!  =]<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|yfPD0U9qaa	uhhhh go for it...<br>  ask her out!!!<br>  least ur still a minor :]

It is a HUGE responsibility and you cannot rid yourself of her that easily if the relationship fails. There are strict laws and I would suggest you research them before thinking the answer lies in another culture or country.<br>  <br>  If you want a quality woman then you will have to be a quality man and from the sounds of your posting your resentment towards women is evident. Yet, for someone who despises women so much---you post a search for a wife. <br>  <br>  If you can find it in your heart to forgive, and not sterotype all women based on your experiences; and actually place VALUE on relationships-- then you could greatly contribute to the success of your next one.<br>  <br>  Rid yourself of this ugliness; we all desire to be loved and you are no different by masking it with arrogance or ignorance.<br>  <br>  Your big mouth is equivalent to your big pain--which my guess is was a direct result of your big heart...one you have temporarily misplaced.<br>  <br>  Find it again and you win.|`|Q2MLikeUaa	what on earth makes you think any decent women, from any culture would be interested in you.

cJhfSRn6aa	There is no non sexual way to hook up.|`|mefxIQP9aa	This isn't the 80s. "Hooking up" means having sex or interacting in a sexual way.<br>  <br>  Well, if you want to get some crabs, you can have sex with the girl on the couch or in her room.<br>  <br>  But, you should just have fun with the girls and show them that you can dance.<br>  <br>  I love a guy who knows how to dance.

The only down part is that if you're younger and your parents walk in. Anyways, you will usually know when is a good time to do it, but when there's a silent moment when you guys or talking, or when you're talking and you look one another in the eyes, you'll just get the feeling that it's the right time, and then you just lean in or she'll lean in. Don't close your eyes too soon because then you might miss her mouth haha. It won't be too difficult.<br>  <br>  At a party is a little bit different.<br>  If you're at a party with a lot of people and you're sitting with her on tthe couch, there's most likely a few people around you guys too. That's okay, but it might make things a bit more nerve wracking for you and/ or for the girl. But you should have your arm around her and then you guys might be having a slight conversation but not necessarily if the music is too loud. But you just have to look at her in her eyes, [looking in the eyes is the key to knowing when to do it] and just lean in as i explained in the previous scenario.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|x9FienLUaa	If there are girls that want to go out with you then you should start shopping to see who you like.  I would not worry about the sex thing tho.  Most nice girls are scared that the boys are going to pressure them into it.  And you do not know who has done it before or not, it would be wise to ask while you date girls to find out if they are virgins if so that levels the "playing field".<br>  <br>  First I would want to know why you are in the girls room in the first place decent girls' parents do not allow this.  But if you are just sitting and talking is fine. especially if you know she is a virgin.  Taking things slow will definately payoff for you in the long run.  Just because you are the big jock at school does not mean you have to "act the part" just be you.|`|y6hmYOHuaa	umm.. you mean like kissing? if your on a coach with a girl just whisper in her ear that you think shes really cute.

AA10744471	In this situation, you are prolonging the agony. Move on. If he is that fickle to be in love with another girl soon after your breakup, then he is no really for you. Do not be trapped by your maudlin and sentimental feelings that you are still in love with him. Determine to see things differently. Why should you mope and be a victim of your own so-called feelings for him, when the fact is he does not even care for you anymore as evidenced by her new girlfriend. Move on. Dump your feelings because at the moment these are negative ones that will only hurt you emotionally and even physically in terms of your health. So, elect to change your thoughts that hurt you. Move on. Forget him. He is not worthy of your love. Good luck to you and God bless.|`|FmhUZLgoaa	If he is in love with a new girl then that means he doesn't have feelings for you anymore and you shouldn't get involved and confuse everything.

He is in love with another girl and there is nothing in your piece that suggests that he still loves you, or wants to make up, or cares that you love him. Why don't you just move on and with time find a guy who would love just you and no one else.|`|5YEKmHqyaa	No it's not weird.

I don't have any advice for changing a situation other than the person who doesn't feel accepted just needs to do what is right for them.  You can't make anyone else happy and they can't make you happy, all you can enjoy each other's company.  If you're a person who is worth enjoying and your husband isn't enjoying you, it's his loss.  Good luck to you.|`|GQUaFGHLaa	I was married for 25 years and wasn't able to be myself because I was mentally abused. I was afraid of the man and lived a life of stress and had bad nerves. I stayed only because I could not support myself and was trapped in a loveless marriage. None of the abuse showed up until we were married. We finally divorced and thank God for miracles.|`|AA10240238	There were times I did not feel I could be myself.  I remember one time in particular. I was coming home from somewhere and was excited about something.  I don't remember what.  I turned off the excitement before I got inside.  I have never felt excitement since.<br>  No I did not know before, but then I really did not know him.  We knew each other about 6 weeks before we got married.  I was married 42+ years.  In fact, had cancer not intervened, last week would have been our fiftieth anniversary.|`|aqj4E7Aeaa	not married, but most of my married friends, both men and women, voice this complaint.<br>  <br>  Some have divorced, others want to but finances come into play along with other reasons to stay for now.|`|NJVm6dTiaa	I think it's a myth that anyone can be wholly free to be themselves when married. That is not to suggest there is deception; I am myself with my husband, absolutely, but I certainly don't trouble him with the full extent of what that means. I think most married people keep a part of themselves wholly for them, otherwise it would be all too easy to lose sight of your individuality and just become completely subsumed into the union. <br>  <br>  I am still married. Before we were married, and even in the first few years of our married life, I was probably much freer with him, but after a series of unfortunate circumstances, it became impossible for him to deal with many things, in particular, emotion.  So I am a much tamer, more controlled wife now. My husband is still the head of our household, the leader of our family, a passionate lover, and a good companion. I do love him. And I have friends with whom I can express emotion and vulnerability, so it's not too bad at all! I actually think it's quite common for married people to have aspects of themselves they do NOT share with their spouse, sometimes simply out of a desire to protect their spouse. Everyone knows when you're dating, it is the BEST side of yourself you share with the person you're interested in. I think that should be the aim when you're married too.|`|AA10450505	In what way are you witholding yourself, Autumn? Why do you feel the need to hide the real you? Love - the basis of and reason for marriage, is unconditional. Don't be so hard on yourself. DEFINITELY, only bad things can transpire when there is dishonesty, deceit etc in a relationship. No one can stand to wear a mask, forever.|`|ZtfN4J6taa	Yes, that is exactly what happened to me. There were definite signs before the marriage, however, since we had know each other for quite awhile I thought things would be OK or better. Wrong, I was not free to be myself, she felt I should not associate with family like I am used to. She was always in a bad mood. The divorce should be final in March.

1235333b4f34f1147fc81bf4aef8885baa	Um, no, it's not right to take away medication.  Messing with a child's face is never okay.  Messing with a teenager's self-esteem is never okay.  Besides that, a punishment should be related to the actual crime committed.<br>  <br>  If it were my daughter, she would be grounded until at least midterms when we would review the grade situation.  I would also make contact with her school and let them know the situation and work out a method to check her school progress.  I would also ask the school to punish her because she broke a school rule on top of a rule at home.<br>  <br>  Needless to say, she would be "on probation" for quite some time and wouldn't be getting any extras until she'd proven a repentant spirit and had "done her time."<br>  <br>  Teenagers make stupid mistakes.  That's why they still live at home with their parents and aren't out on their own yet.  As parents, it's our job to guide them through these mistakes and help them to see the error of their ways.  It is not our job to make them feel like their physical maintenance or sense of self-worth can be cast aside when they've messed up and done something they shouldn't.|`|T3b4I4kXaa	Taking away the skin care product is out of bounds.<br>  <br>  Grounding the girl in question, to ONLY be at home or at school, with no other activities, until she can raise her grades is well within practical guidelines. As also would be limiting her social activities and internet usage. <br>  <br>  The attempt at forgery is grounds for further disciplinary action... my parents would have spanked me red & blue for that.|`|d7bJIgqlaa	Woah, that's a harsh punishment.  I think that your daughter needs to know that you are disappointed in her grades, but even MORE disappointed in her lying and changing her grades.  Her punishment should be "normal" not taking away treatments that make her skin healthy.  Make sure she understands that just because you get disappointed your love for her doesn't lessen.  She doesn't need to lie to you.  She needs to work harder and look for help to fix her grades early on, but your love stays the same.|`|rMPt2YLPaa	The daughter should understand that academic honesty is important and that lying is not an amiable quality. A meeting should be set up with the teachers of the classes she is failing. She should also be enrolled into summer school, that is punishment in itself. As for the punishment that is  distributed to her, taking away skin care products is a little petty. One should make her sign an academic acheivement policy and agree to keep up grades, and if the promise is not kept, her worldy possesions will be systematically taken away,( cell phone, camera, computer, t.v., car, time with friends).

CLJXTsFJaa	I think the 2 of you need to talk.  He is very young but if you already have 2 children together and you both love each other thats all that matters. <br>  <br>  You have a baby on the way I personally wouldn't go worrying about planning a wedding just yet.  <br>  <br>  Talk to your fiance.  Say something like this.  If your not ready to get married yet that is ok I love you and I'm happy however I would like us to set a date for sometime after the baby is born because I love you I want to be your wife and raise our family together.  Then say to him how about this date what do you think?  and give him a meaning ful date like the date of your next engagement anniversary or the anniversary of the day you got together and date that means something.<br>  <br>  If you get married after your baby is born you could include him/her in the wedding somehow maybe???  That would be nice.  <br>  <br>  My fiance and I are getting married Next October it will be 6 years to the day of us meeting for the first time  :)   We would get married this October but we know we just wont have enough time to plan things properly.<br>  <br>  best of luck to you.|`|3E23cHfjaa	You need to tell him if he is man enough to sleep with you and make those babies he better be man enough to take care of his family even if that means him making you his wife!!!

The perfect combination is when she is able to satisify his sexual desires through role play. Remember that sex is about 25% fantasy and 75% physical attraction for most men. Sometimes....especially if the couple has been married a long time....things get boring in the bedroom. Sometimes it helps to make things more exciting by pretending to be "strangers". Lots of couples use costumes, wigs, etc...to help complete the fantasy. Why do you think Halloween is so much fun for adults???  Who wouldn't LOOOOVE coming home to see a "Naughty Nurse", "French Maid" or someone "new" to the bedroom once in a while?? Husbands should also be accomidating to the fntasy for their wife as well.|`|EENUWAP7aa	It's caused by a male ego that is high not on standards, but acceptance.  Any female that accpets him knowing that he is married will fill his ego and she does not have to be pretty because his drive is to satisfy her with everything he has and believe me, you sometimes wonder why females have relationships with married men, is because his ego and his drive are very powerful and she will get the best out of him everytime until he is completely satisfied before it begins to slow down and that could take months. Some men may drive hard for as long as six months straight before they are satisfied. Once they are satisfied the relationship will begin to settle back down and the sex will be less and less until the affair has either ended or he has got busted in the process.<br>  <br>  That's why married men sleep with just about any female pretty or ugly.|`|E0PZoHMkaa	If all we wanted to do was LOOK at them, I suppose yes.  But the very nature of cheating says that we will be doing more than looking at them.  At that point personality, sex appeal, a flexible schedule, a willing disposition and a grateful demeanor will mean more than what appears to be beautiful.  As long as we're on the subject......isn't that pretty much why women screw the unemployed construction alcoholics on the side while we're at work??  We make more money than those guys but women need more than that, right?|`|AkTw3RQuaa	Halle Berry husband Eric Bene't cheated on her !<br>  Jennifer Aniston,s hubby Brad Pitt did it too<br>  So looks don't mean a thing<br>  Men cheat because they can<br>  They think the more women they have, the more man they are (MACHO)<br>  There are 7 women to every 1  man<br>  You do the math<br>  Some men are EGOmanics <br>  men have been known to leave beauty for ugly booty|`|jMLa696Taa	its just them.|`|BLaEQfdDaa	well yes that is what most guys would do but its usually because the girl the guy cheats with doesnt have respect for herself or she is hopes to get money or revenge.

XPrsJBnvaa	That depends upon the couple.  Sometimes it seems like there are more downs than ups.  If you're able to keep going back to each other and work on the things that are hanging you up, yes, you have a great chance at surviving.  I used to think that when people disagreed they had a bad marriage.  I know now that I was wrong.  People disagree all the time, it's how they work out their problems that determines if they are mature enough to survive the problems.  Honestly, it's the people that don't fight at all that have the most unhealthy marriages...in my humble opinion.|`|5DJzp6bMaa	No It cant and Anyone that would even Do that has no Self Esteem|`|AA11621340	My husband & I have been married more than 35 years and our marriage has had more ups & downs than a roller coaster. Some of the downs have been pretty hard to get up from, but we keep doing it. We believe in the vows we took when we married. No one ever said it would be easy - and somehow the harder you have to work to keep something, the more it seems to mean to you. Divorce always seemed to be the lazy, easy way out, though I can understand it's sometimes unavoidable - as in an abusive relationship. Then again, we are a little on the old-fashioned side in this modern throwaway world. Today people easily throw away half-full containers of food, clothing worn only a few times, a tv or computer because there's a new improved model out there/ How many people do you know who have thrown away a spouse after only a few years or "Traded in" the old model for a newer younger one? Come on,now ! Let's all grow up and take care of what and who we've worked so hard for. IF your car doesn't fix, take it to the garage & repair it - don't trade it in! And if your marriage seems broken, go away for a long weekend or two or three, work on it, talk out your problems - Fix it! Don't run away! Yes, those uphill climbs can be long & hard, but oh, those peaks - they are wonderful and have some breathtaking views of what life is all about! We have fixed our marriage so many times I've lost count.And you know what? The people who traded in their marriage for a new one are still having the same old ups & downs - just with a new person. Go figure!|`|BeLcoS6Aaa	why are there so many downs? if you look at your spouse and you know you love them, but dont feel it, then there is no point in staying together. i mean, i know when it comes to the point in leaving each other is scary, but sometimes you just have to face whats right infront of you. if you spend most of your day angry and sad, then why stay together|`|yIGVOqXdaa	when you get fed up of going back and realise you are unhappy. If there are more downs than ups you should really reconsider your marriage. Good luck|`|AA10450505	When someone's dead.|`|U2tkgYK6aa	only you can truly answer that question, you must both still love each other if you are both willing to keep trying, however we all have only one life to live, and if yours is been taken up by this to the expense of everything else then its time to reevaluate your marriage. you do not want to get to 40 and realize that you have wasted 10-15 years on something that you knew was not going to work.. it is a hard choice to make, but good luck with it.|`|q8ZkujSoaa	there's an actual psychological theory that says for a relationship to be successful, there has to be a minimum of three positive interactions for every negative one. in other words, if your spouse says "you're a bad cook" he also has to say "you're pretty" "you're a good mother" and "I like spending time with you" to balance it out. <br>  <br>  if you're not getting this 3-to-1 ratio, you're probably wasting your time. but if the positive-to-negative is 3 or more, keep at it. <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|UzpSHj2Saa	Well my marriage has had many downs and ups. I personally don't want a level marriage, because even though the downs suck the ups are so great! <br>  Only you will know when enough is enough, but I suggest remembering those ups when the downs seem like too much.|`|MDTqSeJ4aa	It depends on what kind of issues you are having. If he is abusive he is probably not going to change. Try to get counseling.
GuNBgiEWaa	Ok-<br>  FIRST OF ALL I NEED TO TELL YOU THAT CHILDREN CANNOT BE BLAMED FOR PARENTS NOT KNOWING HOW TO KEEP THEIR MARRIAGES FROM FALLING APART.  the divorce was NOT your fault and he's only saying that because either he's the one that left or he blames himself for her leaving.HE IS WRONG TO MAKE YOU FEEL GUILTY.  most kids are not bad. that doesn't mean that they never do "bad" things.  we all have made mistakes and it's part of life.  as for hitting a child-I see nothing wrong with a good *** beating if a parent thinks that it is necessary.  In other words, a spanking is a last resort consequence of a very bad "thing" that a child has done that he absolutely knows is wrong or not allowed.  It shouldn't be done when a parent is angry and it should be talked about later to explain why it was necessary. Under those circumstances, it would be a rare occurence although sometimes necessary.  That said, I absolutely don't think anyone has a right to ABUSE anyone.  if you think you are being abused TELL SOMEONE. If you aren't sure ASK a cop.  Better that you are safe than sorry.   i know i don't abuse my children so when my oldest and i had an incident, he threatened to call the police.  I took him to the p.d. myself and made them explain my right to discipline my kids-not abuse them.<br>  <br>  <br>  parents are not perfect. we all have our own ways of raising our own kids. I believe that most of us love our children dearly and do our best to raise them to become happy and successful adults.  Unfortunately there is no universal perfect parenting book to go by, only our life's experience.<br>  i don't know anything about you or your family but it sounds like your father has some issues to work out, just like every parent.  I think if he didn't love you, he wouldn't be the one raising you.  and who would go through counseling for something that they didn't care about.  <br>  the reality is that our kids don't often see the benefit of decisions that we make for them.  i know i didn't appreciate the sacrifices that my dad made for me when i was young.  not until i had kids of my own did it all click.<br>  until you are 18, emancipated at a younger age, live with your mom or get taken away by the state--you must live under your dads roof with his rules. <br>  good luck with you and your family.  i hope it all works out and you all can find happiness.|`|jpyy7Rjbaa	stop being the cause of his problems. he's not blaming you for all this for nothing............|`|AA11103763	Sounds like you should follow your sisters footsteps and break off contact with him. He sounds like he has no understanding of you and it's causing you a huge amount of pain.<br>  Good luck!
AA11462535	I suggest to keep your engagement invitations simple similar or even something like a 'save the date' card, that way you can go all out for your wedding invitations. <br>  Here is another idea, if you haven't sent out your save the date cards yet, why not create a save the date with more information about your engagement party for those whom you invite to your engagement party and the other guest that maybe too far away to come to your engagement party, you can send them the save the date without the party information. <br>  You can have a different color (in your decided wedding colors of course) for the invites to the party and the other save the dates in another color. The choice is up to you; and it can just be a simple, but elegant designed postcard (it will cut down on postage cost, which is going up...again! :-l ) <br>  By the way, I would leave the registry information for your wedding invitation because its more formal and good wedding etiquette.<br>  <br>  Here is an example of the wording you can use:<br>  <br>  (Save the Date/Engagement Party)<br>  <br>  It's a Love Connection!<br>  ___________ & ____________<br>  are getting married on _________________. <br>  Please join us as  we celebrate our love with a party on _____________2009  at ____________, USA <br>  Email us for more details: loveconnection@yahoo.com <br>  Formal invitation to follow<br>  <br>  For the other save the dates, just leave off the middle section about the party. I hope this helps you out and congrats on your special love connection :)|`|UT5HS39Daa	I would say so, that way if you have a person that's invited to your wedding, and not to your bridal showers, they have a chance to view your registry, and purchase a gift.  I work at a hospital with several males that I invited to my wedding (along with their wives), and also to my engagement party, but they were obviously not invited to my showers because I don't really know their wives.<br>  <br>  And vice versa with your husband's female friends that won't be able to go to his bachelor's party. <br>  <br>  This is what I put on mine:<br>  <br>  Please join us for a night of celebrations in honor of our engagement.  <br>  date<br>  time<br>  place <br>  rsvp <br>  <br>  we hope to see you there!<br>  husband and wife <br>  <br>  we are registered at store and store.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!

If people want to buy you a gift, they will ask your family and attendants where you are registered.  People are generally not expected to bring gifts to your engagement party.  Typically only family and close friends would bring you a gift, if anyone does.  Our families brought gifts and a select few close friends.  We had already registered, so I don't think it's a faux pas to register already.  But, under no circumstances should you include that information on the invites.  It's like asking for gifts and is in incredibly poor taste.|`|pjbdDi2Oaa	Wait....you register for weddings and baby showers. I think its a little too much to register for an engagement party. That is just kind of a celebration that you got engaged and you want people to celebrate with you. If they bring gifts, cool, but i myself would think its kind of rude to register for an engagement party. Wait until the actual wedding for that.|`|1M90Aoytaa	sue smith and sam jones<br>  invite you/ann other<br>  to a party to celebrate their engagement<br>  on...<br>  at...<br>  rsvp<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  please jon us to celebrate out engagement<br>  on at<br>  betty boop and tom jones<br>  <br>  you dont need to put ceremony detail on engagemnt party - you will send out invites seperatly for that, if you ahve you date booked you could always send save the date cards:<br>  <br>  tom and betty <br>  are getting married<br>  on 12th july 2020<br>  please save the date<br>  invitation to follow|`|Pd3Cc3b6aa	It should be really simple, it usually comes from the parents of either the bride or groom.

Registries are for Weddings and showers only, you don't send that out in your engagement party invites. <br>  <br>  But still you can't throw an engagement party for your self. Thats Tacky.

Either sing it to her or dedicate it over the radio. <br>  <br>  She'll remember things like that and if you get her something like a stuffed toy, every time she sees it, she'll think of you.

Best wishes.|`|TYGgRjqDaa	I'm sorry for your loss.  Why don't you let yourself grieve over this for a little while before you start to think about this.  My mother actually walked me down the aisle.

71VRvldJaa	It sounds like you've got yourself a very special guy.  You're only 29 and women are having children at an older age than they used to.  My daughter is nearly 35 and she's just nicely pregnant with her first baby.<br>  By the way....her partner is 50 and he's ecstatic about it!<br>  Does he have children from a previous relationship?  If so, perhaps he might feel he's past the baby stage and you really need to get him to commit one way or another before you wait another year!  I just don't know how much difference it will make between him being 38 and 39.<br>  I certainly wouldn't be sneaky and try to get pregnant when you know how he feels.....but you also have to be prepared for him to give you a definite "no, I don't want children".  If he tells you that, you're going to have to decide whether you're willing to give him up and be childless.  Unless you both agree 100% one way of the other, one of you is going to be feeling unfulfilled and the other will feel overwhelmed.  What the long term effects of that would be will depend on how solid the foundation of your relationship is.  It looks like you both have some serious thinking and talking to do about this.<br>  <br>  Edit:  I think Legandivori's comments are rather judgemental and harsh and am surprised he's got 2 thumbs up.  I don't think he has OCD at all.  He sounds like a hard worker and he's done well to have his own business at his young age.  You can't punish this man if he truly doesn't want children.  He was 10 yrs older than you when you got together and you should have discussed children before you got involved with him.|`|AA10248966	He has OCD, obsessive compulsive disorder, most likely. He is insanely concerned about money money and money. He helps friends instead of spending quality time away from work with you. He is NOT serious about his own well being, emotionally and spiritually, so you come after that. You need to move on. The good news is that you have to find a guy with normal hours, or one who's family gets sometime with him. Your man is a workaholic, and most likely, other holic... Move on fast!|`|AA12204338	The absolute last thing you want to do is force a man to be with you.  If he's not sure then he's not sure!  Don't corner him and then he'll cave and 2 months in he wants out.  That's the last thing you want.  If you aren't willing to wait then leave.  It's not fair really to him to make him marry you...marriage is forever.  <br>  <br>  If the reproductive problem is that big then maybe you should think about leaving.|`|wy25UY33aa	don't have sex till your married.|`|FsmcCXlvaa	My husband never got baby fever either but we have two kids and one on the way. Eventually he said he was ready but I'm not sure if he ever was or not. If you aren't even married yet then you've likely got a long wait ahead of you before he'll be 'ready' for a baby. Take a long, hard look at your relationship and decide what it is you want. Sit down with him and discuss your wants and his. Come up with a compromise that will satisfy both of you. He shouldn't be calling all the shots...there are two of you in this. Tell him how you feel and give him your time line, then come to an agreement and stick to it. If he isn't serious enough about you to make some sacrifices then you want to know sooner vs. later. The last thing you want to do is waste your time waiting for him only to find out a year from now that he has no intentions of settling down. Men don't have a biological clock like we do and he's in no hurry to change his life. Waiting a year is to long and you need to explain it to him. If he doesn't already know what he wants after three years what's another year going to change? If it was me I'd say now or never. Three years is long enough to make a decision.|`|fNctrQ4Haa	Get married first. I'm pretty sure he will be ready after that. Your man is very addicted to his work, I wouldn't be comfy with that. He's not spending time with you at all. I agree with the second answer. He is workaholic.
cm7dLGQPaa	It means he wants to keep you by saying there is nothing wrong with you (and there probably isn't) but he still wants to go out and play  around.  It also means if you stay with that person, you will  have a life time of heartache because you will always be waiting for the next one to come along that he will be cheating on you with.  If that's what you want, then that's cool.  I just chose the other path and told the jerk to get lost and am divorcing him.|`|xHRELTviaa	It means that he can't handle his urges.  He probably likes you, but he simply cannot control the temptation of other women.  He doesn't want you to get hurt because of his inabilities.  If I were you, I'd act like whatever he says is no big deal, as if he is insignificant to you now.  Always keep your confidence that you deserve better and you will get much better.

KCpGsN2faa	Sweetie, I have been in your shoes, I really have. But trust me when I say this, running away won't work. Chances are your family will send the cops after you and you will get dragged back home, where things will get worse. Even if your family/the cops wouldn't find you, chances are life would not be any better at all. You will probably get raped and the crap beaten out of you. You would most likely die. Not to be all dire and stuff, but you need to look at this completely. The best option for you would be if you were to go to your school counselor, and tell her/him whats been going on. By law they have to call child services, and an investigation will be made into your story. If your story can be proved, then they will have to take you away from there and place you in a better home. Do you have any other family who can take you in? If you do, I would confide in them and have them get custody of you. I wish there was more I could say or do for ya, I wish you best of luck. Even though it doesn't seem like it now, things truly will get better, you need to just hold on. If you need someone to talk to you can email me.|`|7Yzgoowkaa	whatever u want to do, do, but dont runaway|`|Lbm1e1sEaa	Since you have no money, that is pretty much the main difficult factor here. I would call child protection services for your state and report the people harming you to the state. Google "child protection service (state)."<br>  That will most definitely get you out of the house ASAP especially since your dad is abusing you. If you call 911 and report him, that will also do the trick to get you out of the house. So what you need to get out of there is to dial either 911, or a child abuse hotline. Running away without their help will be extremely difficult, especially in these hard times. Just call them. It's very simple.|`|rWgt6EL9aa	Both of my parents are alchoholics, not abusive though im really sorry.

You need to talk to a counselor or get help. You shouldnt feel like this.  Just go stay with a friend for a little while.

The minute you start seeing any of these items, RUN to avoid the heartache and headache these people cause.<br>  <br>  1. Watch for consistency in what s/he says and does. For example. does the person follow through on what s/he says? You can even look for consistency between conversations. Liars often trip themselves up by being inconsistent with their stories. <br>  <br>  2. If they talk about their ex a lot - that's a red flag waving - stay away! That person is not ready for relationship, regardless of what s/he says. <br>  <br>  3. If they talk about sex right away - that's what they're most interested in. <br>  <br>  4. If they talk about themselves and don't ask about you - you know his/her favorite topic - themselves! <br>  <br>  5. If they profess strong feelings quickly, don't believe a word of it. No one falls that fast, so don't get taken in by this sweet-talk that usually leads to a broken heart. <br>  <br>  6. If they email plenty, but don't want to talk on the phone or meet - move on! There are lots of people looking for racy pen pals, not real relationships. Spare yourself the disappointment.<br>  <br>  Here's the strongest telltale sign. If you find yourself making excuses for the person - red flag! Don't make excuses for people at the beginning of the relationship. S/he is who s/he is, so don't justify rudeness, lateness, getting stood up or any other unacceptable behavior because of the person's life situation or career issues.<br>  <br>  People are on their very best behavior at the beginning of a relationship. That means you're already seeing the best of the best. If you don't like what you see - do yourself a favor and face the facts that it's not going to get any better.<br>  <br>  If you want to be treated well, start by treating yourself well. <br>  <br>  Do not put up with disrespectful behavior for any reason. <br>  <br>  Regardless of how cute, sexy, or rich the person is, or how lonely you are, ill-mannered people don't get nicer with more time. <br>  <br>  The more you respect yourself, the more others will too.<br>  <br>  Sometimes clients ask me - "If I've already started dating a jerk, is there any way to get him/her to be less of a jerk?"<br>  <br>   Sorry, but I have to say, "no."<br>  <br>  A jerk is a jerk. The sooner you catch on, the sooner you can free yourself and save heartache and time. You can't change anybody, so don't even get started. That's a game at which you will surely lose.<br>  <br>  This is a great time to be dating with nearly half of all American adults being single. Never before has the single population been this big! With so many to choose from, why settle for the crumbs a jerk will throw you? Move on to connect with a person who adds to your life and shows you the respect you deserve.|`|yIGVOqXdaa	Good now move on. Cut your losses there are many fish in the sea.

jvWAiGSwaa	okay, <br>  its okay to like someone whos younger than you, because im a freshman in high school, and trust me if i knew a guy that was older then me liked me, and he was cute i would so go for it. so i guess if youre cute then youre all good. <br>  <br>  Well you can get her to go out with you by calling her! if she gave you her number without hesitation then obviously she thinks your cute. just dont be too pushy, and dont run into things to fast.<br>   <br>   You can usually tell if a girl likes you if when she txts you or IMs you and she puts alot of smileys. to a girl that means everything. nd make sure you put a lot of smileys too. i know it sounds stupid but if you dont put a smiley every now and then it makes her think your not intersted and you dont want to talk to her. If she texts you or IMs you non stop she may like you alot. The best way to tell is just ask her though.<br>  <br>  i hope this helped.

If you want to go out with her just ask her to meet you at the movies or get your mom to pick her up. Just ask her to hang out, that way its no pressure if it doesn't work out.

4o3jXz3Waa	Make sure neither of you are staying with each other because of money or your current pregnancy.  Those are terrible reasons to stay together and your marriage won't last.  However, if the two of you really love each other and both want to make the marriage work for that reason, then that's great.  I will tell you from personal experience, that it is doubtful you will ever trust your husband 100% again.  My husband cheated almost 3 years ago.  We worked through it and are still together.  I have no regrets about staying, but must admit that there are days when I still question him on stuff bc I'm worried he will cheat again.  He says he will never cheat on you again, but I bet he also thought he would never cheat on you the first time.  I respect the fact that you want to make your marriage work and wish the two of you the best.

Give it time.<br>  Take Care<br>  Good Luck!|`|9RXS67Mmaa	That's pretty much how it started with my wife and I. She found new single friends, and started spending less and less time with me. At first, I was okay with that, she needs outside interests. Then it started being spending nights away from home "sitting with friends" always hiding her mobile phone from me until she could delete messages from it. Going to have drinks with her new friends, etc. etc. Becoming emotionally distant, and uninterested in "home" things anymore.<br>  <br>  She informed me that she is leaving, and Friday she went on to say that there is another man involved. I suspected as much but had no proof. <br>  <br>  Does the pattern sound at all familiar? I am not saying your wife is running around on you, just talk to her and see how she responds. Find out why the behavior has changed so much. Maybe you can keep your marriage from running off the cliff like mine has. See if she wants to include you in her new activities. Mine did NOT, she said it was "girls only" that was a dead giveaway for me since I knew there were men present where she was said to be going.|`|AA10928125	sort of odd someone quit her job in todays economy?

What is important is that you talk to her, and ask her to talk to you as well.

Assure her that you're prepared for the truth and will not become volatile, under any circumstances. (Mean it.)

Are most of her friends married or single? I'm glad you're in counseling but am wondering if her heart is in it. Just talk to her and see what she's thinking.

Maybe she is fantacizing about being single. Maybe it's a phase and she'll snap out of it soon. Either way you need to really talk to her. She isn't acting like a happily married woman.

She will probably understand, that is if she realizes what a problem they are. But you should just do what you feel you should do. Try to avoid situations at the party that could evoke that kind of behavior out of her. That's really all I can think of to do in this situation.

8abc5b9cab61ed51f5b3b0ffd3f6ca5aaa	Oh Colton, that's a very hard situation.  Were you baptized as a Catholic?  That can matter.<br>  <br>  I think whatever is healthiest and most consistent for you is the best thing.  Churches are different, they are not free of the power-ambitions of people.  It would be very important to be sure that this new church is truly a place of good influence.  Your mom doesn't have a history of changing churches a lot, does she?  Well, if so, that's not terribly healthy for the kids (consistency is better), and yet some good may come of it.  You might learn of many different faiths and thus be better equipped to choose your own when you are an adult.<br>  <br>  Your father is understandably concerned, and it is a terribly difficult thing to learn that your child wants to change from your religion without regard to your feelings about it as a parent.  On the other hand, your mother approves, and her opinion should matter as well.<br>  <br>  If there is any possibility of you seeing a counselor, who can maybe help you and your family through this rough patch, it might be helpful.  And I would think a counselor who respected and understood Christian values, but was not a representative of either faith, would be the best choice.  Good luck.|`|qeQVyLW7aa	I know how that is My father is catholic and my mother is christian. I am catholic, but if I were you I would just tell your dad that your going to what ever church you go and that you love it there. Tell him you know that he wants you to be catholic but you don't think that's the best for you and you want to be catholic. if hes your dad he'll understand. good luck:)|`|sKHcFx4Baa	God's love is in any place of his worship, if your dad wants you to become catholic, you can always find a great, loving, warm catholic church.  Being a Lutheran and living in San Francisco, i can tell you that a nondenominational church is not close to Catholic at all.  I believe your father is wanting to learn the traditional religion and probably believes this church is not orthodox enough to give you the training in being the Christian many people think you need to be.<br>  in other words, i believe this church may too liberal for the Bible your father reads.|`|1235333b4f34f1147fc81bf4aef8885baa	I think you should be respectful to both of your parents and learn about the faith of both churches.<br>  <br>  When you're staying with your mom, go to your mom's church.  When you're staying with your dad, go to his church.  God is bigger than denominations (even though the denominations themselves don't always realize this).  You can love God and worship Him in any place at any time.  So even if you don't feel drawn to the Catholic faith, you can still spend your time in your dad's church worshiping God and praising Him.<br>  <br>  The Bible tells us repeatedly to honor our mother and father.  By being open to the faith of both your parents, you are honoring this commandment.  You may find yourself drawn to your father's church at another time in your life, or even a church that's completely different from the church of either of your parents, and that's okay - the big thing is that you're growing in your love of God.<br>  <br>  Learning to "grow where you're planted" - which means to make the best of any situation you're given - is a big part of being a Christian.  I really think that, if you're respectful to both of your parents and willing to attend services at either church, they will both become more reasonable toward you and allow you to pursue your own path more as you grow.<br>  <br>  Good luck!  I'll be praying for you.|`|TJzKE3oqaa	I'm a Christian and I think that you Should do what you feel god is calling you to. If this church helps you connect to god beter you should choose to stay there but try to explain it to your dad like that.(this is one one the reasons why my mom and step-dad split up too.) My dad was Catholic but my mom felt this other church calling for her. I was only in kindergarten so I didn't really care which one. So like i was saying if you connect to god beter in the Nondenominational church you should try to go there|`|2sLuZJM6aa	go to the church you wanna go to, explain to your dad that his church isnt for you/ his faith isnt for you. you believe in what you believe in, he believes in what he believes in. you cant change that. so try talking to him about it and do what you wanna do. hope i helped
oS1TBzL6aa	Wow, not to disagree with my esteemed answerers but this is what you need to do.  Next time he does it you need to interrupt and tell him sternly that his actions won't do.  If he does it again just walk up and lay  him out in one hit.  After that just act normally toward him; he deserved it and guys are good about these things as long as you don't drag them out and talk about them incessantly.<br>  <br>  Cheers, <br>  A.T. Cunningham|`|gYuJUyvvaa	TELL him to stop. You need to make a choice now or soon between your friend(s) or your GF.<br>  <br>  Zero tolerance man, zero. This is YOUR woman he's hitting on.|`|5YEKmHqyaa	That is something you really can't let go of.  You need to sit him down and tell him that you find it VERY disrespectful.  Think if he was in your shoes how would he feel.  He is supposed to be your friend so he needs to chill out. <br>  <br>  Just tell him that you don't appreciate it and would like it if he would quit hitting on her b'cuz she is YOUR gf.|`|Z0lbrnHpaa	that's totally unacceptable. stand up for your girlfriend...you can't allow that to keep happening.|`|BeLcoS6Aaa	just be straight up. look at him and say, look man you need to stop disrespecting me. and leave my girl the hell alone! you have to defend whats yours.|`|X2FrjG8Laa	well if i was you i will straight up tell him whats up and if he still tells her than i will get mad but dont fight|`|fmdWxFycaa	this situtaion sounds all too familar. but i am the girl. and my fiance wouldn't stick up for me and tell them to stop trying to sleep with me. i had enough so i said something. It was totally awkward and they ended up makin fun of me and saying they they never did hit on me.<br>  <br>  the point is that she needs to see you tell them off... not a whole bunch to hurt thier feelings but enough to remind them exactly how much thier *** will hurt if they keep on it.|`|Vb8yWZyLaa	look... tell him to back off... and if he doesnt... just dont hang around for a while... all i have to say is your girl comes b4 ur guys... but you dont have to make a scene and like cuss him out just sternly tell him to back the hell off... and if you need to... just dont hang around him anymore.
Hfp80ylEaa	She would date an overrated, leadership-lacking choke artist over you?<br>  <br>  I don't think its actually possible for you to overreact to this.<br>  <br>  It sounds more like you are upset over the result of what happened but you don't really believe what you did was bad.   I personally don't think it was an overreaction, reason stated above aside.  Sure, most women who answer will insist you were heartless but despite them expecting you to always hold your tongue and never speak against them, they'll say anything they want because men apparently don't have feelings.<br>  <br>  You were doing fine until leaving all those messages.  You should have called once and left a sincere message (no apology unless you believe you were wrong), then maybe tried calling again later then maybe once more the next day.   After that, just wait.  When you are calling and begging you are surrendering control.  She's the one that is acting immature, if she doesn't call you then thank the heavens above for giving you an exit before you actually sealed the deal.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind it's not normal or healthy adult behavior to behave the way she is.  You were the one disrespected initially.  You are the one reaching out to make things better.  Period.|`|ifgzHzA3aa	How old are you?!?  of course you over reacted!|`|LCIcUTwNaa	You might have over reacted but that line she said was totally uncalled for.|`|vtW3qPZmaa	The question is, how would she have reacted if it had been you saying something similar?  Is this a case where a double standard is being applied?  I have the feeling if it were a girl posing this question there's be lots of "what a horrible man, dump him" comments popping up.<br>  <br>  If she truly hurt you with her comment then you had a right to let her know you were upset.  You were a tad dramatic about the whole thing, but that's too late to fix now.  Honestly, she's the one that upset you and should make the apologies first, so stop calling her like a wuss.  Once she's contacted you you can admit you overreacted, but that you were hurt.  Seriously, though, you need to stop grovelling... it's embarrassing.  You've opened a door for her, let her choose if she's going to talk to you.  In the meantime get on with your life... don't wallow while she decides what she wants.|`|04KsySRWaa	Dont feel guilty, i would have done the same if i were you, she seems mean to have said that but, she probaly thought saying yes you were going to take as a joke, hopefully thinks clear up!|`|yJZeRu5Vaa	maybe she ran off with Romo? haha. nahh she'll get over it once you guys have a chance to talk. she shouldnt have insulted you like that but it was embarassing that you left her there ha|`|EJSdI25Naa	It's over. <br>  Lucky you to find out so soon. <br>  Move on.|`|MSM66SEnaa	Yah, you overreacted.<br>  You can't blame a person for saying they'd leave the person they're with for a celebrity figure. If Jessica Alba wanted to date you, you'd probably do the same. Let her know you're sorry and you made a mistake.<br>  On the other hand, it was incredibly immature and out of place for that man to ask such a question.|`|GBZQP5pAaa	I think that was inappropriate. She shouldn't have joked around about how much she loves you or wants to be with you. You sound like a nice guy. I sincerely hope she doesn't hold that against you. It would upset me as well. You had a right to be upset. When she comes home, talk to her about it. I'm sure it will be fine. Hold your head up, and believe that you are worth enough for her. Have confidence, and go get your woman!|`|1M90Aoytaa	Yes you did over react, you need to find where she has gone and grovel, buy her some flowers and tell her your sorry, it wasnt the nicest thing for her to say but your reaction probably humiliated her as well as being a total over reaction. Call some of her freinds and her parents to find where she is and go round there on your knees! dont give up - i hope she come home to you.|`|AA10928125	first thing,I would never wear a pink dallas cowboys sweater and jeans,and I live in Texas. I think you did over react a little..do you honestly think romo would ask her out? She's your fiance?I assume she's wearing your ring? She lives with you? Seems to me you have a few unresolved issues before you marry her...|`|IHDVQs3kaa	Bit of an over-reaction. Keep calling|`|8a8CZqGLaa	I think the walking out of the restaurant was what makes it overreacting. If you had said what you did and been mad, but not just left her sitting there, then I would completely understand. But part of a marriage is compromising, working things out, and communication. What she said would have really REALLY hurt my feelings if I were you, but I wouldn't have walked out. I would stop calling though. You've said you're sorry, now she needs to call and say "I'm sorry too, let's stop fighting over something this silly, I would never leave you for anyone." This is what should happen in a marriage, which is what you guys are headed for. Have flowers waiting for her at the house, but do not grovel. You've sincerely apologized- that's all you need to do hon.|`|Y98trMtkaa	Well she shouldn't have said yes so in a way you did. but she probably was just goofing around and hopefully not being serious and what are the chances Romo would go after her? maybe you shouldn't have walked out you should have just ignored it. I'm guessing you know how much this lady means to you and she probably has shared how much you mean to her so hopefully it will blow over buy her some flowers and apologize and hopefully she will come back home all you can do is wait. Something this small shouldn't ruin your relationship with her i would guess not you guys are more mature than that i am assuming and she is your fiance for crying out loud.<br>  <br>  Good Luck (:|`|ej8iwJzqaa	wow, yes you really over reacted.. are you jelous or what?? hell my fiance knows if kenny chesney or brett farvre came and asked me out, hed be standing alone for a minute... he knows id come home though..<br>  <br>  shes a spoiled brat !!!!!!!!  wow, not coming home huh?? is she looking for tony?? trying to take jessica's place?? you know, she did gain some serious weight, but maybe hes looking for a new chick to do.. <br>  <br>  send her flowers, try to be super sweet and rlmantic, and let her know you stuck your foot in your mouth.. <br>  <br>  maybe shes afraid you dont trust her.. maybe she has a touch of cold feet... dont stress though.. dont push her into someone else's arms..<br>  <br>  if she really loves you, she will be back.. just dont go running your mouth to anyone about this.. maybe shes just a little preturbed, or maybe she feels guilty...<br>  <br>  good luck|`|5HdsobN2aa	I would have to say, you over-reacted. Chelsey is a fan of Romo and it's understandable that she would practically do anything to be with him, even leave you, but no matter what, she'll still love you and stay with you. It's not likely that she'll actually go out with this guy but she just has a crush, that's all. It's the same if a guy likes some woman celebrity, he would love to be with her.|`|16dcc54a5ad5c2d729de71ba14fa0a14aa	You didnt over react. I would be upset if my boyfriend said he would leave me for a model. Hes just famous thats all. Dont worry. She should be the one saying sorry not you. stop calling and wait for her to come home. dont keep calling let her calm down she will come around trust me if she loves you then she will say sorry and forgive you. I hope everything works out for you|`|aUa0LW9xaa	Its not like tony romo is going to come for her anyways. You overreacted majorly. Although I don't agree with her embarrassing you like that but if your relationship can't make it through something as little as that then maybe you two were not strong enough from the get go. You kind of made nothing something.|`|am906CQcaa	Ouch. Bad move. First of all, if you ya'll are really in love, you shouldn't take stuff like that to heart. I would give her time to cool off or chill out and give you a little time too. And don't argue over it. Just explain why it hurt you and apologize for taking it so seriously. And if you drove her how is she supposed to get home? Don't stress too much over it. And don't act on impulse so quickly! Hit pause every once in awhile.|`|cb2b43b8ec2e68ec2c7b5415eda851c5aa	uhm no you didnt over react.<br>  first of all why would she say that to a random guy.<br>  &+ second. why would she say that in front of you.<br>  she obviously has no feeling about the way you feel.<br>  the only reason she was crying is probably cause she was embarassed or she knew she messed up, but if it were that case she would have answered your calls or came back . i think shes over reacting|`|AA11038292	Are you serious?! id leave you too if your that willing to give up on your relationship that quickly. she probably realized how stupid you are and how your not worth her time. Who just gets up and walks away from a relationship because she thinks tony romo is hot...DUH!|`|GPstCDBlaa	well, yes i think that you over reacted. who wouldn't want to go out with an "idol"? you should give her time to come around and you shouldn't have left her. You should tell her how sorry you are and that you over reacted.|`|6eJm757Laa	I feel that you did not over react.... but you could've said it in a nicer way. I totally agree with you on being mad and her being upset but just let her cool off. I hope it works out between you guys...  good luck!<br>  P.S. That guy sounds like a duche....|`|CD83zn9paa	Well i feel for you,getting mad over it.She shouldn't have dissed you like that..honestly that was kind of harsh.I feel like you should tell her how you felt before the wedding is off.|`|rGBtvjmWaa	You did over react a little. Though she shouldn't have said that if she really loved you. You probably need to wait for her to just come around on her own, since she's not answering your calls.|`|xbbi4LQIaa	**** that *****. if a chick that i loved said some **** like that i woulda kick that fag's *** and left that *****. i wouldnt be tha one calling her, she'd be calling me|`|yn3KCJtPaa	awe sad. i think you had a right to be mad but you really shouldnt have left her. you should get her flowers|`|kVYgnm65aa	ya (in a sarcastic way) yaa u doo|`|CLJXTsFJaa	WOW what a weird guy at your table being annoying I would have asked him to leave.<br>  <br>  I do believe you over reacted but your feelings were hurt so I don't blame you.  Right now your fiance has hurt feelings.  You are doing the right thing by ringing her sounds like you really do love her.  <br>  <br>  Try ringing some of her friends to see if they have seen her. <br>  <br>  Try ringing her again and tell her that you over reacted but your feelings were hurt by the comment she made.  Ask her to come home so you can talk to her and reasure her that things will be ok cause lets face it romeo isn't going to come along now is he?  Thats about as possible as me being able to go out with Orlando Bloom.  Not likely to happen in this life time.<br>  <br>  Other than that I'm not sure what you can do.  Where would she be likely to go?  You could try go find her.  Make sure she is alright.  <br>  <br>  All the best.|`|FTSjU6bEaa	Honestly, I would have reacted the same way. Regardless if she was joking or not. So I don't think you overreacted at all. That was really insensitive of her to say that. Just give her a little time to clear her head, like you did. It's only been a few hours since this happened. She probably thinks you overreacted at first but then she'll realise she shouldn't have said that.<br>  <br>  When you speak to her, apologise (for overreacting, if you want or leaving her at the restaurant) but confess that it really hurt you because you really care for her and love her.|`|nCu8Qvayaa	listen this is not real life the guy just asked her a hypothetical question .  that would be like her getting mad at you because you said carrie underwood is your babies mother.  you did over react but she is being silly by not returning your call.  give her time and space and she will come around she is somewhere looking at the caller id laughing at you baby.  just chilllllll!|`|cfvPgtvwaa	Well really you shouldn't be feeling horrible but you shouldn't have left her there she was just telling the man she really liked Romo and if she didn't love you she would have probably already tried to get with Romo and to show you that she loved you she said no offense just say if she was in the resturant with you and some girl askes you if you like someone and you say yeah i love that person and askes you if u would ditch your girlfriend for that and you looked at her and said no offense but yes would you want her to get up and say im done
9abe8687989127188752215d9026429eaa	Lol....My mom used to have a green ford that made this ticking sound whenever she'd drive it...lolz it was so embarrassing but when i would be waiting for a ride i could her close by and knew my ride was coming near even though it was out of sight lolz...Don't be embarrassed by your momz stutter.. i would suggest praying for her...in that situation so that God can heal her if you believe in God. I'm mean look my moms got a leg issue where she has to walk with a cane but you know i deal with it cause i realize that she can't do anything about it but get surgery or something so if theres a reason to be embarrassed for your mom don't let it be something she has no control over. I mean i am embarrassed by my mother but for things other than that like because she's unforgiving to me for mistakes i made,swears at me, isn't loving to me the way i think she should be for a single mother who's daughter has a father who wasn't there and now that he's came back he's mean to his baby girl, or that my mother favors my brother, makes fun of my faith in God, wont let me hang out and i'm 17 and will be 18 in August....lolz theres more but I think that's really Kool she's letting you hang out with your boyfriend...just don't have sex until your married...i did before i was married and i wish i hadn't so just don't go in any rooms alone if you know you too have talked about sex and you know things are probably going to get there...other than that hehe no judgment have fun with you boyfriend and don't let him talk about your mom even if he is rich :p|`|1235333b4f34f1147fc81bf4aef8885baa	Just get it over with.<br>  <br>  You're actually probably more sensitive about your mom's stutter and your economic status than he is. I'm sure by now he's realized that you don't have as much money as his family does, and he's okay with it.<br>  <br>  The biggest thing is to be confident.  If you act like it's no big deal, he won't think it's a big deal either.  If he likes a jerk about it, tell him he's a spoiled rich brat and ditch him because that's not the kind of person anyone needs to date.<br>  <br>  If your boyfriend really cares about you, he'll love you for who you are and he'll love your mom because she's your mom.  Cars and stutters don't matter.  Give him the chance to impress you.|`|2IK3PvAEaa	Sweetie if he really likes you then he won't care about the material things or the fact that your mom has a speech impediment.|`|c8211594ff6738029a06ddd4858fa6c4aa	if he's that stuck up that he makes fun of that stuff then he's not worth your time.|`|Hx2raTNQaa	IF he really cares about you it wont matter|`|MPfj42xDaa	Why should he care?|`|pKzH1cFHaa	You need to learn that if he is worth your time, he will accept you and your life.

Plus if he likes you a lot it shouldn't matter what your house or car looks like and how your mom talks. He should like you for you.|`|veZLfnGFaa	Don't be this way towards your mother.  She can't help that she has a stutter and that she has an old car.  If you'd stop having these hangups about what you have or don't have, you will make it through life much happier.|`|w8OOs3n9aa	who cares?.  if he really likes you, then what car your mom owns or how big the size of your house is shouldn't matter.  it can be embarrassing but that's what a boyfriend is for.... you talk to him about stuff...|`|D9x1QSgiaa	You might be her DAUGHTER,....but he's NOT dating your MOM.

ZX9HeOuyaa	well, go with him and c what happens!|`|yj3GT7jOaa	Stay at home or ask for an escort from someone older than yourself.  Tell him in advance of your intention.  Get your parents permission and allow them to meet the guy.  Set strict time limits and keep a cell phone handy with a good battery.  Have fun.|`|FmhUZLgoaa	If he thinks your to young he wouldn't have asked for your number. If he wants to take you out and your comfortable with that then go for it. Have fun!|`|AA10744471	Even if the guy is more than 30, it is still possible to have a relationship with him, although I would not recommend it. If you are maybe 18 already, then it is all right. But the ideal for you is to wait when you are of age before entering into a relationship, especially with an older man. You see, I am afraid that he might only exploit the situation because of your young age and you will be left hanging after he has enjoyed the "fruit of his labor" so to speak. Don't accept his invitation for a dinner because you might only expose yourself to an exciting but dangerous situation. If he is that interested, invite him at home to meet your parents. In that way, he is already forewarned that your parents know and might approve or disapprove of any relationship later on. Please ask for advice from your parents. Good luck to you and God bless.|`|ff27c578abd6f97b50c76f87e94ae774aa	First of all, ask him how old he is. 20 and 17 isn't bad at all, but 29 and 17 is way too big of an age difference. Usually if you have a bad feeling about someone, you're right. I'm sure he's a good guy, and you should still go to dinner with him, just as friends. If he asks you on a second date or asks you out, just tell him you're at different parts of your life and you want to keep things simple for now and just stay friends.|`|oRzqWhsDaa	tell him your age and talk to him about how you feel and yes you are  a minor|`|n53HeORBaa	well age is just a state of mind, if you want to go out with him then do so, just always be on your guard on dates with older men, they tend to take advantage of girls your age, i am not trying to scare you but i just wan you to be careful and safe during your date <br>  goodluck!|`|JjU6IdnDaa	Communicate your concerns.  When you are comfortable with responses consider accepting or refusing the invitation.  <br>  <br>  Refusal is just as appropriate as acceptance.  Demonstrate your respect for self and others.  An appropriate level of communication will be the barometer date potential.<br>  <br>  Acknowledge and explore personal social sensitivities.  Establish a comfort level for self.  It is the only valid reference you will ever have.|`|T3b4I4kXaa	You are underage. Tell him this.<br>  <br>  There is a world of difference between someone still in their teens, and someone in their mid-20s. Light years of difference in world experience and sophistication. This wide chasm between your two experience levels puts you at a distinct disadvantage. <br>  <br>  It would be a different matter if you were in your 20s and he were in his 30s.|`|SaDwYkI4aa	you are right. you are a bit to young. sounds like you have a good head on your shoulders!|`|rjsB4oDkaa	well hes obviously interested in you so i wouldnt worry about thaat, but maybe take it slow becasue u never know with older guys. like, they may take advvantage of you if you know what i mean lol ! so jusit be careful good luck (:<br>  <br>  p.s:  love is love, when age comes in , it truly doesnt matter! ages is nothing but a number|`|AA12274970	if it isn't meant to be (because he thinks that) then it isnt meant to me I guess. Older guys like younger girls so age doesnt matter so much (unless if you were like 15 or something) if he asks how old you are, tell him. dont lie because if he found out your true age he wouldnt even be able to trust you and that would ultimately end the relationship altogether. good luck girl!!|`|FsmcCXlvaa	You are... over 18 and under 18 can't mix. Tell him you're 17.|`|gNXbt4CLaa	tell him that you would like to go out for dinner but if he thinks that the age is an issue that they should just be friends.|`|AA12139118	How far into his twenties?.................wait a year till you know all about him and you are one year older and wiser.|`|IpWTMetHaa	If he thought you were too young, why would he have exchanged numbers???<br>  <br>  Duh!!!|`|6x7zV65Xaa	You are not in a sticky situation, but first off, it is honestly never a good idea to date someone you work with, nevermind how the age difference is, I wish you luck but odds are if he gave you his number/exchanged, he is intrested in you and doesn't care of your age.|`|K5brrQWVaa	if he wants to go out on a date and he knows how old you are then he likes you. it doesnt matteer. lol|`|rvCbwX1Paa	Well the thing is if he asked you to dinner and he knows your age than obviously he doesnt think your too young for him. If he is older than 21 than I, personally (im 17 myself) wouldnt go out with him simply because i would be uncomfortable with it. Best of luck to you though : )|`|BQsPZZfYaa	Go and have fun.|`|Hbw8CEqAaa	just act more mature than you usally would... leave a good impression.|`|3lqjbusaaa	well you should ask him if you're too young. because you don't want him to ask you to dinner and then he finds out you're 17 and then he doesn't want to see you again. just ask him if it's okay and if it is go for it.|`|0lU0ndAxaa	i think u should wait if u think hes to old for u|`|qLPhwLfwaa	give it a shot my wife is 11 years older than me. age means nothing in matters concerning the heart|`|3NdBYdlOaa	he asked you out not the other way around so dont freak-he likes you<br>  <br>  help me  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AjU7k3xBhOvgAN.OowrCX_jsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222174112AAfbM6i">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|Ek5ZjYmhaa	Don't worry yet if he hasn't said anything.

That isn't actually a big difference, but just to be on the safe side, have the guy meet your folks, because if you two have sex, (or if he even trys) they can have him arrested in most states.

ebcfaff0504724aa2ad756522576c3b2aa	You cannot fix people. People who are so absorbed in self-pity and self-loathing (which is a form of pride, a deadly sin, believe me from my own experience) are not even going to be willing to fix themselves. It takes a will to just try, and it sounds like she is lacking.<br>  <br>  Is she jealous of you? Yes, it sounds like it. And you are wise to note that. And I am sure that it hurts you, it is a hurtful thing. Your mother is not dealing with her life, she is just using tons of distractions to avoid the real problems, whatever they may be. Smoking, drinking, and you might not even know what else. Misery loves company, and she would just love to see you miserable. It's dysfunction; she will fight your healing process in order to drag you down to her level. Realize that her evaluations of you have NOTHING to do with truth, or with your value. It is still very hard when our own parents reject us. <br>  <br>  You are obviously not responsible for her marriage ending, and not responsible for her problems. Her victim mentality is extreme, but take heed in her example--dwelling on your own victimhood (and we're all exposed to unfair things in life, you a lot more than others in your life so far) is destructive, pity, either for yourself or for other people, might seem like a virtue or a comfort, but it is one of the most destructive forces on earth.<br>  <br>  I am sorry that you have had such a rough time from someone whose duty it truly is to protect, nurture and love you. You are right to be upset with what she has said and done. I hope that you tell her, calmly and in a loving way, even if you must write her a letter in order to do so, what she has done that has caused pain and hurt in your life. You may want to wait a while and reflect on this question, write rough drafts, not to dwell on it, but to make sure that you're not excusing anything. Then give it to her. My best advice is to give it to her when she can no longer play such a consequential role in your life, perhaps when you are 18 and can move in with your grandparents. Then she'll know, and you don't own her reaction to your words, however awful or untrue it might be (don't expect her to break down and apologize.) This is your very important role in helping both you and helping her to heal. Love has painful aspects to it as well. You are not in the role of authority and you can't force her to do anything. The best you can do is show her love by showing her kindly and honestly how she has hurt you, let her know that you forgive her for those things (but only when you are ready) and then really let them go and try to move on. The rest is really up to her. You are not giving up on her, you don't owe her anything more than this. She has abdicated responsibility as a mother and that is just very sad. A person has to be hurting a lot to do this, but there is an element of not wanting to let go of her hurt, of nursing it, that she has allowed into her life which hurts both of you. Don't pity her, love her, and leave her to make the next move. I think this will bring you some peace.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, keep talking to your counselor. Write down some goals for your life and figure out a roadmap to make them happen, without your mother's support. You are an accomplished young lady, you can make your way. Don't fall victim to feeling sorry for yourself or for her (she's going to launch an all-out offensive to try, and if and when it fails, which I hope it does, she will be ticked off.) <br>  <br>  God bless you, best of luck to you, stick with counseling, focus on you and being around as many positive people as you can possibly be. Stay in close touch with your social worker also. Raise the alarm when she verbally abuses you in this way. It is not okay, and they can take measures that might wake her up from her self-pity.|`|mBnmH8bUaa	not jealous of you... more like she needs to grow up. You should have an intervention with her. She's not going to get help unless she thinks she needs help.|`|xri2lFpKaa	pray.<br>  <br>  <br>  ill pray for u because at this point its in Gods hands|`|T3b4I4kXaa	Keep trying to get some objective professionals involved... perhaps you can talk to your counselors at school and get their involvement.<br>  <br>  Talk to your grandparents... see if they are willing to take you on and file the papers to become your legal guardian. If you are at least 14, you can make that determination for yourself, and stand in court to talk to the judge about what you are suffering at the hands of the judge. The judge can make your mother hand the child support money that she receives from your dad to your grandparents... if the court is garnishing your dad's wages directly, they can make that switch.<br>  <br>  Your mother is acting out in a very bad manner on all levels. She is blaming you for her not having had a childhood, when in fact it was her own darn fault. All the boozing and clubbing is her substitute for the childhood she thinks she missed, yet it makes her an unfit mother. The abuse to you has to stop.|`|rffdGwB9aa	Oh my gosh, that's horrible!!<br>  <br>  Is it possible to complain to your social worker and ask to permanently move in with your grandparents or something?<br>  Until then, you should tell your mother just how you feel, without any yelling or anything.|`|89eff262f6bea247dc65af0dfdb2e666aa	Get emancipated and call CPS to see if you can't take the other kids with you. Apply for welfare and stuff like that and spell "roll" role. Try even moving with your grandparents. This should help. It doesn't seem that she's going to try to get any better.|`|yYBMYMwZaa	First off, your mother needs to get help and stop blaming you for her problems<br>  I think she's just going through a tough time right now, If I were you I would stay out of her way and continue staying with your grandparents|`|CHUDVsbEaa	why do u religious people automatically assume the person believes in god???|`|AA11040944	she cant treat u like that! yea she has some problems but doesnt mean she has to take all her angry out on you! try not to give her problems which i dont c u do. but if i have probelms with my mom i just dont talk to her at all. like if she talks to me i try to ignore her and go along with everything shes says, thats when she starts all being nice. you should say something to your mom. she has to know how your feeling, tell her that what shes doing is wrong. if you dont say something shes gonna keep doin what shes doing. shes is a bad situation so she needs you right now. tell her that your there for her and you would do anything to help. dont argue cuz it will be worst....i hope this helpsss sorry i think its too long anyways but good luck!|`|L9XS5Gqgaa	Your Mom is stressed and sad about the divorce and pressures of her life.<br>  Stressed +sad+ drinking=rage and being unable to deal<br>  <br>  Your Mom is not jealous of you.  When you went to your GP she probably felt even more that she failed and she was alone, so she accused you of loving them more<br>  <br>  When the counselor focused on her, she felt threatened so quit. It's easier to deny and to blame other people than face your own problems.<br>  <br>  Unless there is something that you are doing that you are not saying, you have nothing to do with this and are a good daughter.  <br>  <br>  Show her this and tell her I told her to KNOCK IT OFF AND GROW UP<br>  actually don't.  She'll go off on you.  and acuse you of showing everyone her problems and she still won't admit to them.<br>  <br>  If you are 16 you can choose where to live<br>  <br>  You can still go to counseling yourself to help you deal. and you can discuss each episode more fully with the counselor. You should do this for the other kid's sakes too. The counselor can keep an eye on things. You should do this, and keep up with your outside activities and friends. <br>  <br>  I had a bad situation too. Very. Eventually you get out. Keep your head up and keep the faith and values.  No one can make you feel bad about yourself that way even if your situation is bad<br>  <br>  PS Sometimes even being gentle or surprising people with a present (doing the dishes, buying her something goofy like glow in the dark toenail polish )  will make them laugh and realise that you are on their side and want to help. Sometimes.  Understand she is sad try to have empathy for her but take care of yourself.|`|bJqS9GYOaa	It sounds like your mom really needs help.  If your social worker could not do anything, and the courts ordered you to live with your mom, then the only advice left is to sleep at home, but stay away as much as you can.   Try to find a job or something that keeps you away from your mom. Stay with your Grandparents every summer and your friends on the weekends (if possible).  When you become 18, you will be a legal adult and can move out on your own (I doubt that she will help or be happy).   I hope that things get better for you.|`|paCHaDWVaa	Well I think all you can do is live your life to be the best you can. Everyone has to answer for themselves. If she is taking some anger from something else out on you she will eventually realize it and it may or may not be to late. If she needs some counseling you cant push her into it, she will have to realize she has a problem. You cant regret how well your life will turn out compared to hers either. I hope you have a good support system, you seem very mature for a high school student. It's probably hard to want to stick around every time something horrible slips out of your moms mouth but remember your being the bigger person. Good luck with everything, and even though your mom is your mom, don't let her discourage you.|`|vtTUn0zcaa	Your mom needs to stop bein a whiny kid and grow up.... she isnt jelous of you shes just abitch|`|eEGn2hVPaa	im sorry<br>  thats kindaof how my life is<br>  <br>  just hope things work out with youh tho|`|f1gmEmUTaa	Ouch, I'm sorry this is happening. If you are of age, then I'd say pack your bags and get out of Dodge. Assuming that everything is on her end, she is in need of some serious counseling. If you're not of age, I believe there is some process which you can request to live with a foster family, or for your grandparents to get custody. I'm no lawyer, but this seems to be a clear case of abuse. Good luck with it.|`|mXFiSe2taa	WELL THAT’S JUST AWFUL. IT SOUNDS LIKE YOUR MOTHER HAS SOME ISSUES, HOWEVER I WILL NOT SPEAK BADLY ABOUT YOUR MOTHER BECAUSE AFTER ALL SHE IS YOUR “MOM” PROPS TO YOU FOR BEING SUCH A GREAT KID THROUGHOUT ALL THE UPS AND DOWNS.

I HOPE THE BEST FOR YOU!|`|yJZeRu5Vaa	shes just going though a tough time and taking it out on you. just stick with her and let her know youre there for her . things will get better for the both of you when things cool down for her.|`|XyEUCeIvaa	i think, maybe she was really unhappy with ur father, and you say she recently went throught a bad divorce. i think shes just going through a rough patch. after a while she should be just fine. just be patient. it is true your mum shouldnt take it out on you but thats what parents do some times when they feel hurt. just give it time.<br>  <br>   hope i helped
yhfG07Jtaa	Yes, a wedding is a celebration of a marriage and a lifetime commitment. It's too bad that the US confuses the legal with the personal/ religious, but I don't think that a wedding performed by a clerk of court should be more binding than a wedding performed by a priest.<br>  Financial tax reasons make sense, I've known several older couples who couldn't be "legally" married because they would lose social security or pensions.<br>  Just be sure you understand the federal tax implications & etc very well.<br>  And it's not your problem whether "I" would consider you married. Have your wedding, have it blessed, whatever whatever, and if anybody has a problem that the US gov't doesn't recognize your marriage, they can talk to you about it (which they won't have the nerve to do.)|`|7a7330eb2ff515adb55d25158415c54faa	As mentioned in other answers, since you are not signing a government marriage certificate, in their eyes you are not married.<br>  <br>  The wording is a bit confusing. The government adopted a religious ceremony (matrimony) and turned it into a legal ordeal. I know many couples are opting to unite through religion or ceremony only and forgo the legal paperwork because of many reasons, financial and tax reasons included.<br>  <br>  I would considered you united in a religious/ceremonial sense. Just be sure to inform your guests that this is only a ceremony of symbolic uniting of you are a couple, two people promising their everlasting love and commitment to each other and not a legal wedding. There may be a few people who would be insulted by the fact that you are not uniting legally and they may not see it as a "real" marriage.<br>  <br>  Congrats. :)|`|1M90Aoytaa	You cant have a ceremony but not sign the papers?! where is letting you do that, for tax reasons your better off marreid anyway - tax breaks favour marriage.

If I were a guest and found out I'd be awfully upset that I bought you a gift.  I'd probably even ask for it back. Even if you specify "no gifts" people will show up with one (or cash). so let them know it's fake or you'll have some angry people demanding their money back.|`|EJSdI25Naa	Legally, then, you will be his common law wife or, as he may refer to you, the 'missus.'<br>  <br>  You can do that just be shacking up together without all the sham.

You are lying to people, and this will end a lot of friendships.|`|b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	Married legally? No. Do your guests know? It seems a bit of a fraud if they don't know.|`|vCZuh3oDaa	I would consider you married in the eyes of God, and His laws.  But not the laws of the state.<br>  <br>  Some posters have mentioned that married couples get a tax break.  Actually, there is a marriage tax/penalty if you and your spouse's annual salaries are similar.  The most significant marital tax breaks go to those couples whose salaries are very divergent.<br>  <br>  In addition, many couples don't get legally married for loss of social security benefits, pensions, and financial aid packages to their collegiate children.<br>  <br>  Best wishes.  I would consider you married, but I agree that you should probably let your guests know ahead of time.  The wedding website might be a good place for that.|`|AA11310817	It's a "Commitment Ceremony".<br>  I don't understand why people consider a piece of paper more binding that a promise made to each other with your chosen religious entity as witness. That should be more binding than anything else.<br>  I am in the opposite situation.<br>  For complicated reasons, we had to speed up our "legal marriage", but our family refuses to see it as "The Real Thing".<br>  For a while I had given up on the idea of doing a "Religious Ceremony", but now we've found a Middle Ground we will all be happy with. <br>  So, in September, we are going to have our "Real" Wedding, sans the paperwork.<br>  Some call it Renewal of Vows, others Commitment Ceremony, or "The Wedding You Never Had".<br>  I don't care. <br>  To my family, it is the Real Deal, and if they are happy I'm happy (and the other way around)<br>  I wouldn't advise you to lead everyone to believe that it will be a leagl union, but I wouldn't also go putting "make Believe Wedding" in the invitations either.<br>  Find a way to word things so that there is no misleading... Like "We invite you to Celebrate the Union of..."<br>  Congratulations. I hope neither of you take this lightly. <br>  Treat these vows just as binding (or even more binding) as the "legal" vows, and you should have a Happy, Fruitful Life together...<br>  Here's a definition I found of "Marriage":<br>  "The union of two people, to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life"-(See below for source)<br>  That's what you'll be doing...

Just because you go through the motions, doesn't make you married.  It needs to be legal.  If I went to a "wedding" and then found out later that it wasn't even legal, I would be a little upset about it.  It's a little misleading.<br>  <br>  Fraud...that's the word I was trying to think of.|`|nqINitkmaa	No not legally. You shouldn't have a wedding if your not actually getting married. If your not ready to get married because of financial tax reasons then your not ready to get married yet. Are you sure that you have looked into this "tax reason" well? There are so many tax credits for married couples.|`|rlUUaSgqaa	If you made the vows to each other in front of everybody knowing that you meant it, then I would consider you married.  I think the promises you make are more important than the legal paperwork.  I also consider gays and lesbians to be married even if the government doesn't recognize it.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	legally, no, you wont be.  you will still have to file taxes separatly, and a whole pile of other stuff<br>  <br>  a loooootttt of legal stuff changes when your married.  you will not be entitled to any of those things untill the paperwork happens.<br>  <br>  also, depending on the state your in, they wont even consider you common law.|`|hVrfm4eIaa	No, if I went to a wedding I would expect the couple to become legally married in addition to the ceremony.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	You aren't married unless you file the legal paperwork.

616f37abb5f6bb497fbb33bae765a7e2aa	Maybe show some backbone, and tell him to move it back into the family room. He moved it into his room because he knows you won't say anything to him about it.|`|YIvIVvWFaa	Absolutely, it is a matter of what's right is right. Either demand your rights as half-owner to have it back in the family room, or--if he balks at that--propose that you each have it in your own room every other month. Faced with the prospect of not being able to get at it at all every other month should make him happy to keep it in the family room.<br>  <br>  Alternatively, he would "buy you out," paying you back for your half of it, so you could buy one to keep in your own room.
IfOTZhQyaa	What you like is what you can't have and that's what drives you. You need to be very careful not to act on what you feel cause you will hurt your friend and that is if she really is your friend. Those are only thought and they should stay only as thoughts. I think it is normal.  What is happening is that the more your girlfriend sees this guy the more you get to know him and so you begin to like not necessarily him but the things he does and likes. That's why when she, your girl friend, breaks up with the guy you start to lose interest. It's like having a crush on someone older like a teacher only you never really act on it cause you know it's wrong. JUST BE CAREFUL!|`|GLNTnA56aa	I think that you are just dealing with some jealousy!  I know what you mean though.  I like my best friends boyfriend.

Tja1NM78aa	I failed a chemistry exam and my mum was really unsupportive. She's controlling but not THAT controlling that I do whatever she says. Do what you think will be better but don't take it just because your mum wants you to.<br>  Why is she insisting that you retake the subject? No offense but if I were you I would steer clear of it.<br>  I don't tell my mum that much about school anymore...at first she would ask about exams and crap and I'd tell her to butt out even if it went well, she just doesn't bother anymore. She's always comparing me to my really brilliant cousin who lives in Russia and telling me how she's always top of her class. My mother's just annoying, I just take really long walks to avoid being with her when she's around. She's Russian and doesn't understand that my life belongs to me and what she says can't actually do anything unless I want it to...ignore her.<br>  <br>  Or just tell your counselor about your subjects and then go on to blubber about your mum, telling someone will make you feel better - maybe a friend as well? xxx

Invite the coworkers you would like to come, and don't invite the others.<br>  <br>  The key here is to mail personal invitations to the invited coworkers, just as you would for any other guest. Don't put an invitation in the staff kitchen or pass them out at the office - not good manners and not professional.<br>  <br>  If someone is married, it is polite to invite their spouse - married couples are a package deal. But if you have to restrict the guest list, put only the name of the coworker (Susan Jones) instead of their name plus guests (Susan Jones and guest). But like I said, spouses really should be invited.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Whoever is invited to the ceremony.

Have your Bermuda destination wedding. That's it. When you get back it will be all over.<br>  <br>  With your work mates, organise with some of your good friends there to put on a little reception the day you leave. They could make some tasty sandwiches if you bring along the bread and butter and some tasties to put on them. Have some chilled casks of wine and chilled soft drinks, i.e. lemonade, orange flavour, Solo. You'll also need drinking cups. Use paper ones.<br>  <br>  Or a couple of buckets of KFC. That will be very nice,and everybody can come, sans spouses. Ask one of your mates to be the M.C. She will open up with a little speech to congratulate you. You respond similarly. Nothing long winded. The President and his wife will not be able to attend. Half an hour later it is all over. Clean up after yourselves.<br>  <br>  That's all. That's life. Best wishes for a happy life together.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	Only invite people from work if you talk/spend time with them outside of work.<br>  Honestly, if I was only working somewhere a few months, even if I really got along with you, I wouldn't expect an invite.<br>  Yes, you need to invite spouses. It's pretty rude not to.  The way you cut that off is: if they are married, engaged, living together, been together for a LONG time (like over 3 or 4 years) or you hang out with both, they get an invite.  If it's a new relationship or they don't have anyone you do not need to invite the guest.<br>  In this situation you only address the invite to them. Do not put "and guest" or anything.  They'll know

Even if you did get married your chances of divorce are increased because you've already been living like a married couple.  Your boyfriend probably never had intentions of getting married.  Maybe he will change but I think it's unlikely.<br>  <br>  My parents have been faithfully married for almost 35 years.  They were married 9 years before having children.  The marriage commitment (vows) my parents made to each other is what keeps them together.  They aren't together simply because of having children or living together.<br>  <br>  Hopefully you can stay together, fix the problems, and get married in the future.  Good Luck!|`|4o3jXz3Waa	No, I haven't been through it.  But I do know that no one is ever truly financially ready for anything.  What's enough money?  And how's it going to change anything financially if yall are already living together and supporting 4 children?  His response is just a cop out.  He's not ready to committ to you forever and he may never be ready.  You just have to decide if you can be satisfied shacking up forever or not.|`|GQUaFGHLaa	If the guy does not want to marry you could be because he already feels married. Eight years is a long time to live together and you also have four children together. You have a family together so chances are maybe he feels married and doesn't feel that he wants to make it legal.|`|ON84EQaBaa	look like after 8 yrs. 4 kids he has no intention on ever marrying you. so if you don't want your kids growing without him in the house you're gonna have to accept the fact.|`|BLaEQfdDaa	my answer, he is afraid, you have been together for that long, why getting married, I have seen friends of mine live together for years then they get married and everything falls apart, and now they are divorce and she has remarried and after 7 years he is still single. sometimes you have to look at what you have right now, is the relationship strong, money problems will always be there no matter what. But if this is something you want and he doesnt, be careful cause this could only push him away, just look over everything try to see his point, then talk to him about it. most important thing think about the kids and what would happen if you guys split!!! do you want to changes things the way they are now or take that risk and lose everything???|`|CWgJ7Yyxaa	After 8 years and 4 kids, if he wanted to marry you he would have done it already.<br>  Sorry.<br>  <br>  Looks like he will never go ahead and actually do it, because you have been living like a married couple for so long already.<br>  <br>   Why should he WANT to change things? He already has the good things marriage has to offer. <br>  <br>  This is what happens when you don't do things in the right order: FIRST you get married; THEN you have kids.<br>  <br>  Don't hold your breath....and decide what is best for your kids.|`|jBigEy0Caa	How many more kids does he want to have before he is ready to settle down?  You need to look into some serious birth control until you can get your life in some type of order.  It is expensive to raise a big family.|`|jWeiU9SRaa	well damn girl you !9 with 4 kids wow,y'all 2 must be high school sweet hearts..but just give him time and let him do it when he is ready i mean whats the point and rushing girl you are still young honey plus im sure he loves you but don't get married 2 young . .
CIOayGDJaa	to be honest with you, i think the best time to ask a girl to prom is when you are comfortable. but you would want to do it real soon. and what you should do is go up to her while she is at her locker give her a rose and ask her to prom. hope everything works out,and hope this helped.<br>  --let me know what happens!--|`|LpJFTU2oaa	The right time to ask her to prom<br>  Is when she's not standing by mom<br>  When the music thumps, give her pelvic humps<br>  and tell her her a$s is the bomb|`|b303ac30b84e46877b74d3a9633e809aaa	If you  are interested,now.

Don't want to do it too early and then break up a few weeks before.|`|rvCbwX1Paa	It's never to early to ask her. Who know's, maybe you can get in some good dates beforehand :D<br>  You should ask her in private and tell her that you think she's a really cool person and you would enjoy having her be your date to prom. best of luck :D|`|NNCP41wcaa	First of all.. Give her lots of time before to prepare. Especially cause you dont want her to be snatched up bye another guy. Be really sweet.. BTW are you asking her out? like to be your gf? cause it changes a lot.
S4Puwubnaa	No when those butterflies go away than you need to worry. I was married for 26 years and have been divorced for 3 very sad years. If it is truly love than you should always have those butterflies as I can tell you every time I was with my wife I always had them and it was so freaking awesome.

Just enjoy it because one day it will stop and you will be wondering what happened to the butterflies.|`|ise05jjUaa	There's nothing wrong with that, it just means that you're still really into him & that he still has that affect on you & that's a good thing.|`|CDM8yvmCaa	ive been with my bf for over 3yrs and sometimes i still get butterflies!<br>  <br>  it means you love him =) this is a very good thing!!|`|th7C1aoaaa	Enjoy it while it lasts|`|ebd01f2a9ac954de0f1feb8fb05fc0c7aa	Its called love hun.|`|ynuLj6IYaa	its good<br>  it means u rly like him<br>  he probably feels the same way beleive it or not|`|gugY3GoHaa	nah! ;)<br>  ur just in love <3<br>  lol tell me how it goes!|`|wkbQSfGUaa	no need to worry about it .<br>  its normal , it happens to me too . :]<br>  it just means you really like him and you're comfortable with him .<br>  xx|`|xyolNO8saa	the longer, the better.|`|d9181ed2099c82efddd68d0ff9035407aa	Wow, that's great!<br>  <br>  Butterflies are a good thing, it means you're in love!|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	I have been with my husband for 3 years, and still get that.  I love it!  I have never felt this way about anyone before - that's how I knew he was the one for me to marry....because the butterflies didn't go away after a few months.  You should be feeling lucky and thankful,  because not everyone finds that one person in their lives.  You should keep holding on to that feeling for as long as you can!|`|G50ucmllaa	You are fine.  I have been with my husband for 6 years and I still get them.  I tell him he "makes my heart flutter".
WyDsza2Faa	block and delete her babe if she hates you and doesnt even know you shes definately not worth knowing in the first place. No doubt she's not going to be any great loss.

NuUdCz0Laa	Good Monday morning J.J.  If my wife came to me asking for something, I would not hesitate to fill her request.(As long as it did not require taking out a bank loan),  I think your husband is the same.

Most women dont realize and most men don't appreciate the simple beauty of an attractive woman dressed down.

pkAXMWSdaa	Inside jokes just...happen. Next time you're hanging out with your friends and something funny happens, make a note of it in your mind. Then, when you see them in the hallway on Monday, repeat the phrase. They'll probably remember it and you all will have a good laugh. Before you know it you'll be saying it to one another at random times around people who will have no idea what you're talking about- another inside joke is born :)|`|0ONNEXLnaa	i have one. with two of my friends. i didnt even mean to make it. but we were getting ready to go hang out and i said i was going to go do my face. you know wash it then put on makeup. the crazy people my best friends are they took it the dirty way. as in you know "do" lol. then one of the friends i was just talking about and another one, well we were out of town together and my mom, step dad, older sis, and 5 yr old sis were with us. my little sis calls me spe. because spencer is to long for her. so when my friends heard it they started laughing. so now at school they yell "spe" across the hallway at school. and then the laugh . its pretty funny,|`|qr3EiAt2aa	I can't really tell you how to have an inside joke. Theres no real secret or rule. It just comes naturally. If you have a good time with a friend it will come. Or go to your besties and ask to create a handshake. Its fun and will make you communicate and have a little laugh if you make a funny careless mistake.|`|cKyEX25eaa	well just like whenever you are hanging out with some of your friends just like whenever someone says something funny or ya'll do something funny or something later just remind them about that and someone will probably be looking at you funny and you can be like sorry insider|`|QY9aypCCaa	uhm. no offense, but kind of pathetic. But i'll try to help you<br>  <br>  Just hang out with your friends, when ever something really funny or stupid happens, you guys would say it all the time.<br>  <br>  And no offfense, what grade are you in ?<br>  O.o|`|1ZWNmQ8Iaa	if ur with ur friends and somthing funny comes up say it a couple times then when u c them again say it gain and u laugh again lol i have millions of them|`|UpJbXh7Vaa	Lol it's just common experiences and stuff. You probably have them and don't even know it. Like in my spanish class my teacher was sick for the first month of school and she came in one day feeling sorry for herself and was like "I'm sorry I can't talk loud class. I have a case of SEVERE bronchitis" and it was really funny, so severe bronchitis is out class inside joke. And in drama, we were talking in english accents one day and we were talking about how funny it sounds to cuss in english accents but s.hit doesn't sound any different so we put our pinkies up and now thats our inside joke. <br>  It's just random funny things that happen and you remember them and they become inside jokes...|`|IfOTZhQyaa	I use to work with some really fun guys years ago and we all became really close. I remember that there was this one guy who wanted so bad to belong in our circle and so he tried to make himself come across as really cool. If you would have seen this guy you would instantly know there is no way in hell this guy was cool. Anything you did he did it better. You now the type. Any way one day we were talking about weight lifting and how much you can lift and he joined the conversation. It turns out, in his mind, that he was a bodybuilder of some sort and that his back was shaped like a "v". He was serious too. Well at the time that was so funny to use that we walk by each other and just yield out  "Im a v" it got so famous that we even had a logo for it and drew it everywhere, on pallets in the restrooms and even on the bulletined board and the company though it was a gang symbol and sent out memos warning use that gang activity was prohibited. To this day we say it when we see each other. That's how they start.|`|e2cf497fb8528f8c556d43e9580066c5aa	Inside jokes dont take much. If you have a really close friends, you'll probably make inside jokes like 10times a day. You can't just start it by yourself and expect people to follow it. Then you become a joke. <br>  I had like 100million inside jokes and they came from the things you would never expect them to be. It's only funny with the person you share it with and most of the time, others won't get it. Try to build a strong friendship with someone|`|DQp9Nejfaa	Inside jokes generally happen by accident so when you and your friend do something funny or something funny happens when you're by yourselves then consider it an inside joke! Or make up a hand shake or quote funny things off movies! :D<br>  <br>  Its up to you!!<br>  <br>  Haha have fun!|`|rh2toYSZaa	They usually happen out of nowhere, but if u really want to, when you're with one or two people, say a joke or something random/funny.<br>  ...then everytime you see them say it.<br>  Hope i helped. :D
KM9yFkeKaa	lol I find myslef in the same positions sometimes.

Don't get too personal thou.

AW1dCzH0aa	I know you don't want to hurt her feelings, but I'm sure she will be a little hurt that you can't be in her wedding.  I would be straight up with her and I'd tell her as soon as possible.  That way, she can figure out if she's going to help you out financially and keep you in the wedding, or gracefully let you back out and try to find someone else to fill your slot.  I think coming up with $1000 in a few months, is a lot to ask.  I would be sure to send her a really nice card with a thoughtful message about how sorry you are that you can't be apart of it.  And, if you have the money, perhaps a nicer gift than you would typically send.  :)|`|JtEBaOdjaa	Just explain that you don't have the finances to do it all but you are honoured she would ask.  She'll understand.  If she wants you there enough, she may even offer to pay for expenses (minus the flight. I would assume she'd expect you to cover that still).<br>  <br>  Don't worry, us brides aren't scary horrid monsters (well...most of us aren't lol)  She'll completely understand!  Just make sure you tell her why. Don't just say "I can't do it" then she might think something is wrong between you two. lol|`|kj507W26aa	Just tell her like you told us here. If she wouldnt told you 1 yr. ago , things would be different. But at the moment, full time student, you just cant fart this expense out.|`|iKYNUni0aa	just be upfront and tell her your situation you never know she may even offer to help you out|`|db2fba6816023455392d2b12257ae4fbaa	Just tell her. She should understand that under the circumstances. I was just in a wedding that was in Hawaii (destination wedding) and you are right the costs are not cheap. Not to mention, you are going to have to take time out from the school if it's during school time. <br>  <br>  Hopefully she will understand your financial obligations given the economy.|`|yhfG07Jtaa	The nice thing to do is say "no, I'm devastated that money makes it impossible for me to come to your wedding. We'll have more time with each other when I've finished school, but for now please know that I love you and I wish you every happiness."<br>  People all over the world have to miss family occasions because of the cost of travel. Your cousin will understand.|`|eN5xA6RKaa	just let her know you cant afford it. i had a bridesmaid do that to me..shes having a baby in august and my wedding is in october so she said that she couldnt be in it because she wanted to save money for the baby, and it was totally fine with me. explain that you dont have that much money and you cant afford it.she will understand.|`|rNyA9cRmaa	With today's economy she should understand.  Be honest and tell her the truth.  <br>  <br>  If you can afford to go to the wedding that should be good enough!  If she provided the BM with dress, hair & makeup, that is one thing but its alot to expect people to come up with that much $$$|`|DQlZIzAFaa	Explain exactly what you said here - you're in college, you don't have a full-time job and you're spending a lot more money than you're making on tuition.

My cousin did the exact same thing, I ended up helping with her airfare and paying for her hair and makeup.|`|L44LBa2Xaa	Just tell her<br>  That your thankful for you asking but you simply said "yes" too early without thinking on how much it was going to cost all together.  Tell her that you don't have enough money for the dress, the makeup/hair but that you'll be at the wedding.<br>  Tell her soon as possible.!|`|7a7330eb2ff515adb55d25158415c54faa	Give her a call as soon as you can and explain your financial situation to her. I'm sure she'll understand that you have to save for school/books/rooming/etc. for the next school year and won't be able to afford all the things a bridesmaid is expected to purchase.<br>  <br>  Tell her you'll be able to attend the wedding and can't wait, but unfortunately you just can't fit the dress/shoes/make-up/hair/etc. into your budget.|`|ERaIVdN8aa	I would explain to her that you are very flattered and would love to be in the wedding, but you are a student and don't have a lot of extra money.  Explain that you were unaware of the expense when you said yes, and after thinking about it you aren't able to incur the expense.  Explain that you wanted to let her know well in advance so she can fill your spot if need be.  She will either completely understand, or if she wants you in the wedding bad enough, offer to incur some of the expense herself.|`|X1ygowVQaa	I agree with what everyone has said. The fact that you pointed out that you aren't THAT close makes me think she will be more understanding to the fact that it is a lot of money for you to put out. Honesty is always the best policy and who knows maybe her or someone in the family will offer to pay for your hair and make up since you are flying all the way to Hawaii. Good luck!|`|h3NJO9dWaa	Tell her that you are flattered she chose you and it is an honor, but you can't afford it now. Maybe you could do your own makeup and hair, and if she really has to have you as a bridesmaid, then she should offer to pay for your flight or help you out with it. Just talk to her and let her know you would love to be there, but can't. She will understand.|`|CLJXTsFJaa	I would be honest with her.  Tell her you are very flattered and honoured to be asked and your really sorry but you just don't have the funds to be her bridesmaid but you will do what you can to be a the be wedding.  <br>  <br>  I do think it is a little unfair that you have to pay for your dress that you will probably only wear once and shoes that may never get worn again and hair and stuff.  I am getting married in October next year and my bridesmaids are not paying for anything I am I just think it's not right to make them pay.  <br>  <br>  It would be like asking someone out on a date and then making them pay for thier dinner and drinks it just isn't right.  Not to me anyway.<br>  <br>  Anyway Just be honest with your cousin I am sure she will understand.  Just tell her your not in a finacial position to be able to afford all the necessities for the wedding but  you will be there and you will help in anyway you can before and after the wedding.<br>  <br>  All the best

79YQAbSRaa	I think way too many parents see their children as extensions of themselves...as an opportunity to live their own lives over and do it all differently.  Parents pressure kids to be just like them, only better.<br>  <br>  Peer pressure has negative aspects also.  You can let your friends lead you into all sorts of screwed up situations.  <br>  <br>  However, I think the pressures that parents place on kids is the more dangerous.  Peer pressure is short lived.  High school and college will end and kids will find their own place within their social group.   Kids who don't feel like they can ever live up to a parents expectations carry that feeling of failure forever.  If you didn't fit in in high school, or if you did fit in by sacrificing what you truly thought or believed...well, eventually that all goes away and it ceases to matter.  But if you don't feel like your parents were ever happy with who you are, or were proud of you, I don't see how that ever goes away.|`|0tGXQQ1zaa	Oh yeah...parental pressure is much worse than peer pressure!!<br>  Why, well, that's easy!  We're with our parent's constantly, and our parents are always pressuring us, everyday, whereas peers lay off after a few times of you not conforming.   My parents and I fight CONSTANTLY about driver's ed, getting a job, and so on...and I only turned 16 three months ago!  That's the minimum working age for where I come from, and for three months, it's been "Why haven't you got a job?" and "Why aren't you driving yet?" and on and on it goes...I love when I can get out with my friends for a day and get away fro them, because I'm always like, "It's my time and money going into this, not yours, so back off...NOW."  My friends, yeah, we all back off right away when someone says they don't have a job or something.  We get it: parental pressure, you don't need us on top of that!  Parental pressure sucks, they need to lay off!!  My parent's don't approve of the jobs I apply to: like hotels and nursing homes, they want me to work in other places like McDonalds, where more kids are.  I'm like, no thanks...I don't wanna work there!|`|KwNpyp3saa	Yes it can be. A lot of parents put lots of pressure for their kids to be the best. This can be very harmful if the kid has to participate in an activity they do not like. They will not succeed and are being set up to fail. This is something they will carry on through their adult life.
hOeLMmDgaa	simple answer....<br>  go up to him and say:<br>  "do you have a girlfriend" if he says yes then he is just really flirty if he says no then ya he likes you.|`|TofmqjUaaa	you write a lot.. lol <br>  <br>  he definitely lieks you|`|5YEKmHqyaa	He really obviously likes you but could also be nervous about asking you out even though he already knows you like him.  I say you ask him out first, and be the aggressor.|`|QeC5iNNaaa	GET A JOB!!!|`|3Xh1w8SMaa	He might just like you but doesn't want to be in a relationship. Some guys are like that, or they are just too afraid to ask you out. I would personally just talk to him about it. He will open up to you. Give it some thought because the best answer you could ever get is from him. Text him or something if you dont want to in person. For the hangout, if you dont want to ask him out somewhere then have one of your friends invite both of you to his or her house with another friend.
AA10702820	Yeah. A few years ago I was in your situation. I was in a clique kind of thing and became another person. I hated how I had so many limitations and most of all how I couldn't be myself. So I dumped them and went to my other friends who still cared about me and didn't walk all over me. I was kind of upset but for the most part I didn't care-it felt like a release of some sort and I was happy to start all over and make the best out of the rest of the school year.<br>  <br>  I'm glad that you left people who treated you like dirt. :) Some people don't ever get the guts to do that and are forever being mistreated. I think if you let it slide once you'll never ever get the guts to stand up for yourself. You treat people how to treat you and you don't deserve friends who are two faced.<br>  <br>  Be strong and take care!!|`|135LcVodaa	Yeah, I have done this before.  I was felt like I was being excluded and I was just tagging along, so I didn't feel even a bit sad or regretful.  I just stopped hanging out with my old friends and found a new group at the beginning of this school year.  I love my new group of friends, I feel much more comfortable talking with them, and I didn't like everyone from the old group.|`|jZb5zMCvaa	ive dumped friends who were just not going in the same direction as me in terms of religion and they were getting married and having babies and i just wasn't on the same things. i didn't miss them then, but i sure miss them now. its not like i told them off or anything, but i never called and they never called either.|`|4ynGCt40aa	omg! i am having the same problems.

0qjAT3yVaa	ask for the money to take the family out and leave him there.just because he is an ****** doesn't mean the family has to be....also tell him in advance what the weekend will be like,then if he refuses leave the kids with him and you go out and spend it at the spa!!|`|AA11814313	Have a family movie night, play cards uno is great for older kids or snap for younger, sunday roast evening, parents date night, bbq lunch at the park for all or join a sporting event for the kids parents have to go to...make him be in the family.|`|CQsD09D6aa	That is a tough one.

So you need to tell him what you need, as calmly as possible.. tell him, you are missing time together and you feel left out of his life and as though he doesn't care anymore.  If he listens and works at spending more time with you then all is well, but if he ignores your feelings then might be time to pack up and leave.
R9TobyWBaa	Childfree is the way to go. Kids suck, plain and simple. Suck, that is, all the money from your wallet, the privacy from your marriage, your freetime away from work, all your remaining energy.

It's kind of a now or never thing and he is not lifting a finger, so to say, deliberately so. It's an issue with us. I feel sometimes I squandered my best years with him. Sorry it happened to you.|`|C9brWMriaa	It's a woman's purgative to change their mind.
KjqqaOCwaa	you dont know how to kiss? i'll tell you....<br>  <br>  lip directly lined up with lip is a peck. one set of lips slightly above or bellow the other, so that one of your upper lips is directly between the other lips, is a kiss, open a little bit but not enough for a tongue to slip through. <br>  <br>  and pressure in a kiss is important. there's a fine balance between too much and not enough. when your lips meet, they should both press together. personally i'm a deep kisser with a long tongue so i can usually gag a girl if i want...but for a romantic kiss? after the lips meet, there's more of a pucker action with your cheek muscles than there is action in the jaw. <br>  <br>  dont' be afraid to mix it up, so that he's kissing your upper lip and you are kissing his bottom, then switch it up a bit. if your tongues meet, remember it's kinda less than a wrestling match so much as a dance. <br>  <br>  most importantly, just enjoy it. human kisses are one of our sweetest, most innocent ways of displaying affection. and a kiss that you mean is better than anything else you can do to show how you feel. never let anyone tell you different.|`|8gCJVFG3aa	Awhh (:<br>  I Find It Reelii Cute that Your Scared Likee :L<br>  I Remember My First tIme. xD<br>  I Pulled Away And Toldd My Boyfriend He Tasted Ickyy. :L<br>  But He Understood Cause It Was My 1st Timee (: <br>  Its Finee.<br>  Dont Be Shy About Itt.<br>  YOure GOnna Have To Kiss Someone Sometimee (:|`|XcErO51faa	cause you havent found the RIGHT guy.. it has to  happen at the RIGHT moment.. trust me i use to be in your shoes.. it WILL happen. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AuJ_xSt6HnLRDlJze356RK3sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222184622AAQe4nE">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|IVcxIDXZaa	wen your ready you'll do it, dont rush it<br>  try mine<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090222172041AAJ3QAo">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|OkgApi0Caa	YOU LEAN IN<br>  AND YOU FLEX YOUR LIP MUSCLES AND YOU TAP YOUR LIP WITH HIS LIP HOW ******* HARD IS THAT YOU *****|`|fI8pOObeaa	you are not too young at all.

HCGRWHnuaa	You know, this is a very tough question to answer.<br>  <br>  What really matters is that you're even posting this question. It means you're considerate.  I commend you for this.  What I recommend is really just being caring to your fans.  You have to remember no matter how annoying they may be at times, they could have waited months or years to meet you.  It's their moment to say "Hi" to you or shake your hand.  Make it special for them, every single one of them.  This will make both you and your fans feel better about the situation.|`|eCtrOR3Baa	You're not doing anything, you're playing music and people love it and subsequently you for playing it.

But if you don't have time try to tell them that b/c you can't please everyone all the time that's just the facts of life. <br>  By the way u mind me asking what band your from?

Anyway, print some receptions out on Sunflower computer stationery like this.<br>  <br>  Hi, John and Mary:<br>  Well, you know I'm getting hitched. We've opted for one of those weddings in the basement where there is no room. Anyway, if you find weddings as boring as I do, then you'll be delighted to be able to miss the boring part and, I hope, come along to our reception at ---------------.<br>  The time will be  --- p.m. /a.m. and the address is .................... .<br>  <br>  You'll probably find me having ditched the weddindress in in favour of civvies which will make it just so much more practical for us to catch the bus after having cut the cake. Cake? I better check and make sure we are having one. If you hate pigging out on cake as much as I do after having had fish and chips you will be sure to understand. there will be no vegetarian dishes served so, if you might be offended, bring your own in a plastic bag with your nam on it and we will do our best to make sure you get it back. The bag, that is.<br>  <br>                                       Lotsaluv from me 'n' 'im.<br>  <br>  N.b. If you are going to have an unusual weddng affair, make it really funny soas it is wrthwhile not missing out on, not a squibby "you can't come to my wedding but you are invited to the reception" nonsence. People only will think you are nuts. Better to just prove it.|`|e5k8Bsxpaa	You are invited for dinner and dancing to celebrate the marriage of x and y?|`|fb52aec114b2a6279348a5cf16976b41aa	Honestly I think it is rude to invite people to the reception only. They are good enough to give you a gift, but not good enough to see you get married. It's wrong and it makes you look greedy. It looks like you have a hand out for gifts by just inviting them to the party. The ceremony is the important part, not the party. I'm not miserable by the way, and you shouldn't be getting all upset because people think you are wrong. You should be listening and reconsidering your plans. I would however be offended if I got an invite that was reception only and I wouldn't go. Either have a ceremony venue that can accommodate all of your guests or cut your guest list for the party.|`|nqINitkmaa	Together with their families <br>  Susie Q <br>  and<br>  Johnny J<br>  Invite you to join the <br>  Celebration of their love<br>  Date time location<br>  <br>  If you just word it that way they will get it, the reception is usually in the evening, and you are calling it a celebration instead of calling it the actual marriage. Congrats!!|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Lauren's is good, but fix the grammar - 'our new life together has just begun'.<br>  Also, since they aren't attending the ceremony, for the reception-only invites you must include at the bottom, following the location information <br>  "No gifts, please".<br>  Wish you luck!

Yeah, it sounds weird, but it has lots of great sleepover ideas and some games that you can play. You can interpret your dreams with it, find out information, there are even some cheering positions :) And if you really want to, there's instructions on how to make fortune cookies :D<br>  <br>  And in my opinion, tell ghost stories. That can really creep everyone out and they'll get really freaked out by anything xD<br>  <br>  Also, go star-gazing in your backyard. Try to find some constellations like Ursa Major, Orion, or stars like Sirius and Bellatrix (yeah, that's where J.K. got them). Good luck! :) <br>  Also... try giving your sleepovers a theme, like a movie party, or maybe a Survivor theme with tiki heads and stuff. And make your invitiations /dazzling/. xD|`|kTZ9im5Taa	if you haven't already:<br>  <br>  ***do make-overs<br>  <br>      OR MAKE IT FUN AND DO A <br>  <br>  ***Blind Make Over<br>         The first person puts on a blindfold and does the makeup of the second person.  Then when they are done the second person puts on the blindfold and does the makeup of the third person.  Draw numbers to determine the order.  Really funny - take pictures so you can keep the memories.<br>  <br>  ***Girlie Ball<br>  Buy a large inflatable beach ball and in permanent marker write questions all over it.  Place everyone in a circle and throw the ball to someone.  The person who catches the  ball must answer the question that their right thumb is touching. After answering the question they then throw the ball to another person.   you can write questions like:  What is the scariest movie you’ve seen? <br>                          what is your favorite color? <br>                          What are three adjectives that describe you? <br>                          Who is your favorite band/singer? <br>                          Who is your favorite movie star? <br>                          What is the nicest thing anyone has ever said to you? <br>                          What is your biggest phobia? <br>                          If you were invisible what would you do? <br>                         If you were an animal what would you be? <br>                          Who's your secret crush?  <br>                         What was your last dream about? <br>                        What is one thing about you that no one here knows?|`|Kqsbbc0faa	<a href="http://www.party411.com/gameguide-sleepovers.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.party411.com/gameguide-sleepo...</a>|`|XHdDyij8aa	ORGY PORGY.|`|jUzzDOitaa	play zap|`|8SEVTKz5aa	all the things ima suggest is probably done by u already since u had 7 slpovers already... =/
5DJzp6bMaa	Dateing|`|4fC6EJWfaa	that just sounds like a nice valentine's day gift, I wouldn't give it anymore thought than that, except you CAN ask him "So what does this ring mean exactly?" and then you'll get your answer.|`|xxT7YGcMaa	Don't count on it until it happens, for now you are still dating seriously, not engaged.  Are you willing to wait that long before it is official?  Is the waiting time something that you both agreed on?|`|wzqahEqiaa	Is the blue topaz ring a promise ring?  A promise ring is usually given with the intention to get married in the future.  Promise rings are usually for teenagers that are to young to get engaged.  Adults can also wear promise rings but make sure it doesn't delay marriage forever.  If you have a promise ring you are not considered "engaged."  An engagement ring means you are engaged and will get married.|`|CWgJ7Yyxaa	You are not even ready to consider marriage if you are asking strangers in YA what your current status is, honey....!<br>  <br>  You sound very young, by the way.<br>  <br>  Take your time. Marriage is not for everyone, and it is not an easy thing, either. It takes a lot of work.|`|1HTRWrawaa	It's not an engagement ring, it's an I love you gift. No different then if he bought you a heart pendant with a chain. After being with this man/boy for almost 3 years, you should know exactly where you stand with him. Right now I see you as a steady couple who want to get married some day, but aren't ready to get engaged and make a full commitment to each other.<br>  <br>  It's time for you and your boyfriend to sit down with each other and talk this out completely, so you each know where you stand with each other and exactly what kind of a relationship you have with each other now and what you want in the future and make a commitment to what month and year you will get engaged and the same when it comes to getting married. <br>  <br>  There has to be a good reason why after two people have been dating for 3 years, still haven't been able to decide where they stand with each other or set a date for marriage. It almost sounds to me like the two of you are teenagers and you are looking for a commitment at an age when you are too young to even be thinking of marriage. Could that be the case???|`|IpWTMetHaa	I am dumbfounded as to how you had the nerve to "force" your boyfriend into buying an engagement ring.  He bought you a piece of jewelery, as a show of affection, you should have been grateful for.<br>  <br>  Until he asks for your hand, you are dating.<br>  <br>  And go back to the store again in order to obtain the original piece he purchased!!!|`|nRCqF6Euaa	If you have to ask the answer is no. However it sounds like you may be sometime in the near future so best wishes.<br>  <br>  Until he asks and you agree to marry him telling people you are engaged could be disastrous for you and your relationship|`|0HUHHzIQaa	It's easy; If he hasn't asked you straight out, "Will you marry me", you're not engaged. <br>  <br>  You, are NOT engaged. HE is your boyfriend, and just that.|`|AA11814313	I think you got a valentines day present and maybe you should forget getting married and it might just happen without the stress.|`|FsmcCXlvaa	He's your boyfriend.

Its kind of like a pre-engagement ring that works great for situations like yours. Promise rings are just saying you have made a commitment to each other not to be married but that you are commited to the other until you decide on that next step or if you decide not to. On what to call him you don't want to go around saying that he is your pre-fiance so just stick with boyfriend/partner what ever you are calling him now. But I would suggest that you talk this over with your guy, just to clarify what his wants are too. Remember now is the best time to start laying a foundation of trust and openness and communication before you get married. If you can't ask him exactly what he feels the valentines ring symbolizes to him about your relationship and where it is going, then when the bigger issues that come with life come up you will really have a harder time getting through them without talking it out. Good Luck and congrats on your present it sounds really pretty!|`|KT3vszE8aa	You're not engaged. You're not even pre-engaged.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you haven't had some serious sit-down conversations about marriage, times, hopes, money, kids, religion, and the future, you're not even close. Sorry. You can "feel like" you're heading in that direction, but until you've had the discussions and made the plans, you're not to that stage.<br>  <br>  You did, however, get a nice gift. Congrats.|`|T2iYetpkaa	dont tell people anything except that he is your boyfriend.<br>  the ring is a beautiful present. <br>  but untill he is down on one knee asking for your hand, you are not engaged.|`|NctuEmFKaa	Consider it a promise ring.  It's not the engagment ring, but a promise to you and your love and the promise that he will ask one day.  You are promised to each other.|`|fSbSD0B6aa	I'd say "engaged to be engaged." It was at first I think an informal and almost joking term that has actually somewhat come to mean something. I would not call yourself engaged until he actually proposes.
zdu3gh8jaa	Is he worth doing time for? Or getting a police record? I would say no. I understand that you do not like him, just because he is your close family  does not mean that you have to love or even like him. You say you're bigger than him - well show him that and totally ignore him if necessary. That will be worse than any punch or kick and you cannot get a criminal record for ignoring somebody.|`|00b4GnZMaa	this is a very funny question!!!<br>  umm...ermm...you could first like tell him to come into like your room or something and have him do it while nobody is around then tell him to look what you did to your closet he will look,then you will just start beating the crap out of him<br>  <br>  lol <br>  im only 12 but hey,it works!!!|`|AfMah5Ekaa	whoa dude! are you serious? i could give u many ideas. i have thought about things to do to my brother too, but when i look at it, i say its not worth it and after a while that feeling goes away of wanting to really hurt him.<br>  <br>  im not gonna tell you, as i dont wanna be an advisor on how to murder someone. sorry.|`|Lkik9Sr7aa	beat him up

DzAFT8VDaa	I'm not keen on it for myself for a number of reasons - I'm selfish, I don't like doing what I don't want to do & I like my life alone. All the problems our married friends have are exaggerated because we aren't married. Our issues seem foreign to them, if they have been married a while. They have forgotten what it's like to be single.<br>  <br>  Good marriages do exist and can be created if you are motivated and truly love someone enough to sacrifice. I'm not sure I'm there yet, or will ever be.|`|xIwPjhojaa	3 x divorced!!  love is over rated!!  And marriage is out dated ,living together ,works as bolt people don't take the other FOR GRANTED !! at a minimum live together 5 years this the typical length of Marriage, in this day and age !!!! and pleas no children,it is them who, get heart!! in a divorce!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|T2iYetpkaa	i was never too keen on it. <br>  watching all the problems other married couples have. <br>  but then i met my curret boyfriend and the idea is seeming more and more appealing. <br>  you only live once so if you do find someone that changes your mind go for it- it could be perfect!<br>  then again at the end of the day dont feel pressured to be married|`|B1iBGRzUaa	I never wanted to get married until I found the right guy. When you know, you will know|`|KSK22vHUaa	I don't have any interest in marriage, but for different reasons.  I have two brothers, both gay, and live in Alabama.  If they can't get married, I'm not going to, either.

And anywhere in-between.<br>  <br>  If you give us an idea of what you are looking for, I'm sure people can offer more specific suggestions.|`|aipChC3haa	Florida would be good, go extremely south so it'll be hot and more exotic.<br>  <br>  OH WAIT, YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO A BAHAMAS WEDDING!<br>  HAVE YOUR FATHER GO ON A SHIP DOWN THERE!!!!!!!!!<br>  on a cruise!<br>  just a suggestion =)|`|AA11462535	How about Key West, Florida or Naples, Florida.. since you were thinking about the Bahamas which has that tropical theme... Have fun at the beach and congrats for your wedding!|`|sJXjzgh5aa	you would have to fly to hawaii which would mean your father would have to fly in a plane...<br>  <br>  i guess flordia.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	What about heading to the mountains? I know it's not tropical, but a nice ceremony in the summer with snow capped mountains in the back would be gorgeous.  Colorodo maybe?

If you're looking for "hot girls" then I wouldn't be worried about the girls being "stuck up" or having "depth". Sounds like you are stuck up and very shallow, so a girl just like that would fit with you perfectly.|`|16VNS9hsaa	Philippines XD but Filipinas most likely to look like Thais.. <br>  <br>  but really, you just have to look around you. maybe someone is just secretly waiting for you and you haven't realized that.|`|mTqkcTtWaa	there is no best place! to me it seems like your too lazy to look for girls where you are, you"ll sure to find a nice girl where you live.  dont be stuck up...|`|Q9BNAK7waa	america if you want girls who like english guys.

IwlNzrujaa	Well you could possibly ask her if she is busy with other things or something. Also girls like to play it cool and have guys text them first so that is problably why she is making you text her first. Sorry we are just like that lol. I am a girl by the way. Maybe ask her if she is in a realationship so things dont get to awkward. Also if you know any of her friends ask if she has a boyfriend or anything before you hummiliate yourself (girls like that to!) I know we are weird but still.|`|HJrTuihcaa	i think i've answered this before..<br>  anyway<br>  i think you should start texting her but at that age, you guys probably coujldn't see each other that much|`|qQKOAdSjaa	Give it up bro, trust me. If you make out with another girl, you'll feel a lot better.|`|IJ4iv4Wsaa	you can't love a girl over camp and text messages.<br>  -no offense-<br>  maybe she changed her phone #?|`|ymeEplavaa	I dont think you have much of a chance|`|cbSMZ8RAaa	First things first:<br>  <br>  1.) That was such a cute story! Sorry, I had to get that out of the way.<br>  <br>  2.) When a situation like that rolls around, I think that you should go up to her and say "Hey! I haven't talked to you in forever!". The things you should be careful of are not to be too aggressive, or seem to desperate since that may turn her off. Beware because she may have a boyfriend, that may be the reason for her distancing herself from you. If she doesn't have a boyfriend start talking to her again gradually, (more and more each day if you can), and if you guys become close enough, ask her if she wants to hang out. Hopefully, things will blast off from there.<br>  <br>  3.) Trust me, if this didn't work out, at least you'll have the piece of mind that you actually tried, as opposed to watching her slip away, and wondering what could of happened.<br>  <br>  I hope my advice helped.
zxQT3Uo5aa	your role is to try to find things that you both have in common that is interesting while she is doing the same.  It will be fun, relax.|`|YEHkJf5faa	awe. how adorable. well i would definetely ask her like hows school? or talk about the stuff shes involved in...(sports, music, school acitvities, clubs, subjects....etc.) also tell her she looks very pretty or something. dont be cheesy. yeah i'd hug her when u first see her if u guys are pretty close.. if not id still do it. i dont no if u should kiss her especially if u rnt really that close of friends but i definetely would hug her at the end...maybe kiss her on the cheek. or a peck on lips. but thats it...just be urself be natural. smell good. :) haha have fun and good luck.|`|6FKP1VwNaa	Okay...<br>  <br>  so for talking, just joke around and don't be shy.  Show her who you really are and BE YOURSELF.  That's one of the most attractive things...<br>  <br>  Ask her about what she likes...her interests. Just.. you know, get to know her.  And when you find something in common, talk about that! :D<br>  That's a good conversation starter :)<br>  <br>  But don't ask too many becuase like you said, you don't want it to be like an interview lol.<br>  <br>  Tell her she looks beautiful when you see her...and hug her :D before and after! <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|8vzUHPJdaa	Don't say you look beautiful! Say you look PRETTY. Beautiful is a little much for the first date and makes it seem like youre trying too hard.<br>  And don't talk about yourself either the whole time she'll think you are self centered. Ask her things about her life occassionally throughout the night.<br>  I think you should give her a hug at the end rather than the beginning.<br>  Good luck! Just relax and be yourself! And remember she's probably just as nervous as you are.|`|YYSvR3mraa	take it slow! no girl likes  to be rushed. complement her but not over the top  show her a good time and be a gentlemen. open the car door and push her chair in. be gone yourself she would of not of said yes if she did not like you|`|W6pT1Wp3aa	Definately tell her she is beautiful, give her a big hug at the beginning and the end. And just be natural talk to her like you talk to friends, just keep the convo. going.|`|YgGi07Rpaa	i think u should compliment her cause girls always love to be complimtend! lol! (sorry if i spelt tht rong!)|`|uTNKfpV6aa	I would definitely open the date by saying she looked beautiful and hugging her! Talk about your and her interests. If there are any awkward silences, just ask her if she likes the food. Talk about movies you've seen lately. Try common things, that you can talk about naturally, but don't have to give a hardcore opinion... Nothing like politics, she may not bee too up to date on things like Obama's inauguration... Maybe cute stories about life experiences you've had (Ex. Vacations.) , not too long though, or you'll sound self centered. Be confident, but not cocky. I met this guy that was really cocky about himself, and I though he was just annoying, and trying to put me down. Music is  another great thing to talk about, what groups/artists you like, what ones she likes, do you have any in common? If you have something in common, try to talk about that for a while. (Ex. If you both like Linkin Par, talk about your favorite songs, and why you like them.) MOST IMPORTANTLY: Listen to what she has to say, and ask questions, so she can tell you're interested. (Ex. If she's telling you she likes horse back riding, ask her if she has a favorite breed of horse. If she tells you some thing you don't know, ask her to explain it.)|`|FWPSzFVhaa	Don't worry about what to say about your own self.  Ask her about her life.  That is how you make a friend in no time.  Everyone likes to talk about themselves!  ;-)    Just start off with something simple like music or common friends.  Listen very carefully to what she is saying.  And PAUSE before giving answers back to her.  This shows that you are thinking about what she actually shared.  If she looks down or away when you ask a question, be polite and appologize if the question was too personal, look down yourself briefly, then look back up and catch her eye and smile softly.  <br>  <br>  At the end of the date, follow her lead.   This is just one encounter of so many more to come in your life.  Enjoy every single second of it!<br>  <br>  ****  Also, if you want to give her a compliment, make it something original.   If she is pretty, do not tell her she is pretty.  Instead, just look at her silently and when she asks what you are looking at, tell her she reminds you of an actress but much more attractive.    :-)    Originality is a hit with the ladies!|`|AA10936527	Take her a rose and tell her she looks really nice. Then just be yourself.You'll do just fine! If you try too hard to make a good impression,you might make the "wrong impression. It's always better to be yourself and it's a lot easier too! Treat her with respect, that will make a lasting impression! At the end of your date tell her how much you enjoyed spending time with her. And if you both laughed and had a good time ask if you can call her later in the week. Don't give an exact day and time,you'll be a nervous wreck waiting for that time to get here! and then give her a sweet kiss on the cheek and walk away, take a few steps then turn around and give a wave and a smile!|`|ibR6jJgHaa	no it wouldn't be weird if you said she looked beautiful<br>  and thanku for the vocabulary choice lol<br>  <br>  talk about her interest...your interests..find out what you have in common and such. Just getting to know each other, hanging out, having a good time with each others company =]<br>  <br>  the hug? I would say at the end of the date. Gives her somthn to dream about ^.~ haha|`|luD0tMRbaa	when u both get their wrap ur hand around her tell her she looks cute,you smell nice but whatever you do dint stare at her breast,@ss or her  front my girlfriend got annoyed when a person did i went over to him i hit him he hit me back then i grabbed a bat hit him an anybody who disrespects her but compliment her smile at her talk to her about how are u do-in what u do-in how u fell say tank u please your the cutest girl i ever met ask her if u could please have a kiss at the end or hug her be nice and very kind|`|8VRXoG4Faa	just talk to her about anything, <br>  ask her was she likes, <br>  <br>  yes!<br>  tell her she looks beautiful at an akward silence. that would be so cute. <br>  <br>  <br>  also <br>  hugs are great|`|gtunOva2aa	just be yourself! A hug is always sweet, and if you feel like telling her she looks beautiful, go for it! Talk about music, movies, school.. Have fun and good luck!|`|qJECm9nFaa	just be youreself talk about stuff you enjoy ask her what she likes she said yes for a reason hug at the end|`|UtEn6Mwdaa	well you should deff kiss her at the end. but no tongue! don't wanna seem too eager. <-- that spelled right?|`|uEzvYQCXaa	personally, i'd start by telling her how good she looks, beautiful might be over the top for a first date. I'd try discussing things u have in common. idk if u have classes together or are even at the same school but if u are try to discuss topics surrounding the school or class. and if she plays sports or cheerleads or something, try to discuss that over yourself. and at the end of the date when you drop her off or whenever you last see her give her a hug. and if she's not shy, give her a light kiss on the cheek. good luck|`|6yRYSVngaa	Ha im 15 as well and i been on many dates[well actually hang out with guys i like'd or were my bf] take my advice doode :] ha<br>  <br>  Alright uhhh; lets see how to start well deff give her a hug once you first see her. she will feel like you really do like her [thats how i feel when boys give me hugs:] ummm..and also give her a hug when you guys are leaving thats a +<br>  <br>  You should say shes beautiful but something that makes me all butterfli-ey is when boys say ohh my goshh your really pretty or is you cuszz say damnn you look really pretty today but dont say it all dramatickly thats a turn off.<br>  <br>  Make conversation talk about random things.<br>  make her laugh<br>  <br>  if you want make your first move and hold her hand :]<br>  I love when boys hold my hand so most likely she would like it<br>  [Really up to you]<br>  <br>  Uhhh...you can deff be a little shy but you GOT TO talk <br>  girls hate super shy boys.<br>  But the ones that are a lil are CUTEEEE:]<33<br>  <br>  <br>  google if you need more help.<br>  But i tried:]<br>  <br>  <br>  Byeee have a good "Date" Budd|`|a4212be8d71ac02831257e9e70bec87daa	ok so first of all compliments are always good but it depends on the girl she might not likle cheesy guys so don't be too cheesy, you should definately give her a hug in the beggining of the date girls like that and then after the date is over tell her you had a great time, what can you talk about-things you have in common talk about sports she's into but usually conversation comes naturally, btw always pay for her|`|3c2d62279c0725273058507451c39522aa	Of course tell her she looks beautiful! You can NEVER go wrong with that.<br>  <br>  Work with what you know about her, ask her about her passions. And silence isn't always a bad thing. Being able to be comfortable in silence with someone is also important in a relationship.<br>  <br>  Hug her when you first see her and at the end.|`|CjHsXLUTaa	you just need to be yourself and then it should be easy.  Don't act nervous and shy. No i don't think it would be wierd if you told her she was beautiful.  Girls love to hear those kinds of things. i would wait till the end of the date to give her a hug because then you'll know if things went well or not. Hope I helped! Good Luck!|`|Pn2XrCTdaa	I think you should tell her she looks nice girls like that! you should give her a hug at the beginning of the date and if you know her well give her a kiss on the cheek when she is leavin. I thin you should just talk to her and get to know her! :)|`|a71d6398b9b54fe96b5da7798ed275f0aa	def tell her she looks wonderful...def talk about your interests and get her opinion...def listen and look at her when shes talking, ask questions when shes talking act interested even if your bored...talk about school movies sports what you did last wkend... and def, tell her she looks wonderful LOL works everytime good luck!|`|cI4TFsnjaa	Awww, well when you pick her up I would definitely compliment on the way she looks, girls love that. As for conversation, dont sweat it, let things flow naturally. Laugh, and have a good time, things will play themselves out|`|qrjqYAHtaa	Sure. Tell her she looks beautiful. Just don't be creepy about it. Work around her interests, what does she like? Let her know about you. The whole point is to find out if you're compatible. if all else fails, discuss music. And hugs are great.|`|GQjIkO3iaa	welll, its always nice to compliment her when you first see her<br>  and i guess you could have some ideas on what to talk about just in case, but just let the conversation flow|`|hTdMv3BUaa	yes give her a hug and even a kiss on the cheek at the end of the day take things slow depending on the mood tell her she is beautiful but not too much or she will thin k your obsessed..talk about things she likes keep the conversations flowing and good luckk|`|WuW5eSZpaa	awww honey, dont worry you guys are only 15 so just have fun thats the special thing about being young  no worries, if you guys get along great the conversation will just flow. so have fun, and treat her well. happy dating :):):)|`|wxmOAWUvaa	Hell Yeah you should tell her she looks beautiful, but only if she actually does look beautiful. Dont be afraid to tell her she looks ugly as sht if she really is, also.|`|WvBgXv5daa	Talk about your self,<br>   Everyone loves to talk about your self!<br>  but when  telling your interests ask about here, and ask her to dance that way you dont have to talk!|`|2N3puedgaa	I think you should talk to her about different interests you two have (for example: what kind of sports do you like? what do you like to do for fun? where do you like to go for vacation?). Come up with some fun/interesting topics to talk about. If you go to the same school, why not talk about school?<br>  <br>  You should tell her she looks beautiful, but only if you mean it!<br>  <br>  For the most part, I usually give hugs at the beginning and at the end of the date. But that depends on what you and the girl are most comfortable with.<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope you have lots of fun! :)|`|kqw3qclzaa	awww!<br>  you should definately compliment her at the beginning of the date(girls love that) as for awkward silences, just don't think about it...thinking about it makes you all jumbled and usually leads to awkward silences.. just let the conversation flow. and DO hug her (girls like that too) at the beginning and the end of the date.<br>  <br>  good luck:]|`|65aScgwoaa	Aww you sound really sweet =)<br>  <br>  Just keep the conversation flowing, and don't worry it'll come naturally and you'll have fun.<br>  Compliment her all you want<br>  And, give her a hug at the beginning, AND end of the date <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  Answer mine?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090222183635AA2jR5a">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|4l7vn8Caaa	yes you should tell her she is beautiful and you should give her a hug in the beginning and at the end you should hug her or kiss her
mCM363I9aa	stop texting and get the hint|`|2P2K0rl2aa	Wait just a second here.....take a step back.<br>  <br>  Who sleeps in your bed and gives you no sex?<br>  Who withheld affection?<br>  <br>  And you went and had dinner with some other bloke - what's the big deal here?  You shouldn't have to apologise for having dinner with someone, if anything he should be apologising and grovelling up to you!<br>  <br>  Just lay low and don't chase him around and wait until he starts initiating contact with you.  Because if you chase him around you will look desperate and it will turn him off.  The only way for him to realise how you really feel is to tell him - if you feel stuck for words write it down and memorise it for when he asks.|`|yCBsi5OYaa	If you love him be persistent. but as u said he is under alot of stress right now. give him a little time but not too much that he'll think you forgot 'bout him.|`|IpWTMetHaa	The fact that the first guy was "livid" when you told him about the other man is a good sign.<br>  Give it some time, before you reach out again.<br>  But, do you suppose he may be gay???|`|KT3vszE8aa	It's over, and in my opinion, that's a good thing. <br>  <br>  If he's getting "really livid" about you having dinner with someone else and you haven't even been intimate, that's a big red flag.  You're fighting with the guy constantly? Also a big red flag. You're apologizing for stuff that doesn't need to be apologized for. Another red flag.<br>  <br>  I'd say it's time to find someone better, for your sanity and well-being.|`|rUufku21aa	I think u may have screwed up. What's the reason behind his divorce? DId his wife cheated on him?  If she did, and you did the same, well need I ask further? I know I will drop you immediately but will entertain you as a friend. That's all... He's already stressed out, he doesn't need another worry to compiled on top of it.<br>  <br>  Good Luck
7nE2tgANaa	I would file immediately for child support and abandonment.This will help you secure financial help for the children .The legal separation  will help you begin the legal process of moving on. This is important to you from what you wrote. The first step is always the hardest . It is sad when a relationship ends especially when children are involved. it is up to you to be sure that they are cared for first. You will need time to be emotionally ready for a new relationship and have a person in your life that you can trust around your children|`|pRlSSC9qaa	well you can have a relationship with out thinking about marriage. and if it is getting serious enough where you think it might lead to that then do the necessary adjustments so you are not married. but there isn't anyone on here who can tell you when you are ready for another relationship, that's all up to you. but trust people until they give you a reason not to.|`|BLaEQfdDaa	why havent you filed for divorce??? do you know where he at??? you have to decide to file, but because most guys would feel better if you have filed, instead of you still being married and not doing anything about it. good luck|`|KiUlBCEPaa	You should get a divorce first .

Is there a reason you are still waiting, and haven't filed for divorce yet?  I would get that taken care of and cover your bases first, there will be time to have a relationship once your ducks are in a row.|`|5DJzp6bMaa	You should have had one the Day after he Left|`|74008e5e3a8a4192f40444bc93d2b1c2aa	Im taking it that the husband is no longer around.. does he try to see the children? If not that is total abandonment and I would file for an annulment on those grounds. Get a good lawyer who can get you what you deserve. Go out with this guy you are talking about you deserve it. With him being gone so long and not anywhere in the picture you can not be prosecuted for adultery because he abandoned you. Get the annulment and thenwhackk him in his nuts with the divorce papers rolled up for being such a duche for me! Good Luck on your date!!!|`|CWgJ7Yyxaa	Hire a good lawyer and end the marriage. See if you can get financial aid for your twins.<br>  <br>  You should settle this soon...and consider getting counseling before trying to meet anyone else.<br>  <br>   You have to do what is right for you and your babies now. It's not just about what you want anymore.<br>  <br>  Good luck. Be smart.... and choose better next time.|`|FsmcCXlvaa	Get divorced. Cut all ties to your ex and make a clean break.

Don't blame it on your looks either. It's not just about looks. I wasn't fat in High School, but never had a serious boyfriend. But I had friends who wee heavier than me who did.

But if you are always thinking about getting a boyfriend then it more than likely won't happen, or won't be a good relationship.<br>  Being single can be a blessing in disguise, it gives you the opportunity to get to know yourself and like yourself so that when you are in a relationship it works as you won't be insecure and overly paranoid.<br>  If you let it take it's course it will happen for you and it will be a great and strong relationship because you were comfortable enough to be single!|`|QD2AJv22aa	Dont worry about it.  A guy will come around when you least expect it.  For now, do well in school and dont stress the small stuff.  People go through high school and college without boyfriends and girlfriends a lot.  Its not uncommon.  You really dont want anything serious now anyway.  For now, have fun with your friends.  Concentrate on making more friends or getting closer with some of your friends and they may introduce you to a guy.|`|eXiSIaQcaa	don't worry i have the same problem no one seems to like me either everyone tells me im pretty but why don't i have a bf??? i asked my mom and she said its just not my time but one day i'll find someone special and im sure you will too!!! just don't rush anything your time will come when you least expect it!!!!! :D|`|a8ac0317f955a9e6966d1b9fa9bf8cbfaa	It means nothing.

sr7jX2wYaa	Yes, & why  wait until tomorrow if  he was  depressed & you are worried about him, I would be checking on him Now, not waiting, if  for no other  reason  than my own peace of mind*
FmqKsvuJaa	If you think he might actually do something extreme, like hurt himself, I would call his house number. If there's no answer or if you already tried that, you can go to his house. One way to do that without seeming "crazy" to his parents would be to go to Starbucks and get him a tea or go get some icecream. Then go to his house, and if they open the door and seem surprised that you're there, you can just be like, "Oh, (your boyfriend) said he wasn't having a great day, just wanted to bring him something to make him feel better." That way you'll seem like you're being considerate (which you are anyway, you're worrying about him after all) and not like you're freaking out or being over sensitive. <br>  <br>  Honestly though, he's probably fine. My boyfriend used to do this **** all the time. You have to be really careful, because he could just be being manipulative. When someone hangs up on you or ignores you or makes you worry like that, they're doing it on purpose, because they want to feel poweful. It's pretty controlling. It turns you into this weak person who worries all the time and waits around for him, and that's not what a relationship is supposed to be about. You're both supposed to care about each other and be considerate of each others' feelings, so you have to let him know that he can't do that to you anymore. I told my boyfriend, "Even if you're mad at me, you need to just call me and be like, 'I'm angry at you right now, I'm just home and I'm fine, I just don't want to talk. We can talk later, in a few hours." Something like that. That way you're both respecting each others' feelings. Good luck!|`|64515c9dd3f1d42fce2093056b18e17aaa	depression isn't a game or a joke. disregard the silly kids who posted that junk.<br>  <br>  he's trusted you with something you should take seriously.<br>  <br>  go over to his home and give him something to live for. and i mean right now. <br>  <br>  your being there and listening is all it will take to shake him from whatever is depressing him.<br>  <br>  as far as his parents are concerned, you have a paper due tomorrow.|`|mVUpt8waaa	Get rid if this idiot.

Just let him think things out for awhile. He might feel like you're crowding him. Just let him think for awhile. He'll eventually get in touch with you.

Do you know his house phone number? Try calling and if his parents answer just ask for him - at least then you would know if he is alright.

He will come around and open up to you when he is ready.<br>  <br>  Guys are a lot simpler than you think. If they say they are depressed then isolate themselves, they do that because they just need some time alone to organize their thoughts. Unlike girls, they don't like to talk about something that went wrong RIGHT AWAY. They will talk about it when they are ready and no time sooner - forcing them too would only aggravate the situation. Believe me, there is nothing more annoying to a guy when a girl is CONSTANTLY pestering, "What's wrong! Talk to me! OMG! Why won't you talk to me!!!" You truly are only making things worse by doing that.<br>  <br>  If you just back off and stop freaking out, he will contact you when he is ready. Stop sweating it, stop thinking about what might happen and don't jump to conclusions. It's going to be okay - just give him space and stop pressuring him.|`|qySznFXaaa	Call 911

Something must be wrong, his head is not in the right spot and he is thinking things over.  Just give him some time, his head will be back soon.  He is definitely not old, but maybe he is just thinking that his life is passing and he panicked.  He still likes you, he still wants you as a gf, and I'm sure your relationship will be fine.  Especially if he still does all of the other stuff (opens door,  kisses hand, etc.).  Me and my ex-gf have been broken up for about 3 months.|`|uTNKfpV6aa	I think you should just eave him be. Worse come to worse, you two don't get back together, and you gain a really great friend, that respects you and treats you like a princess. But don't let him string you along too long. I'd say if you truly love him, give him a month, two months TOPS... Then move on with your life. He may just be having a hard time with tress, and balancing school, life and a girlfriend, and is trying to save you the pain of him not being able to see you. But if he's just dicking you around, I'd say move on... There are so many other guys out there... But only you can e the judge of if he's just dicking you around. After all it's only you in the situation

No one can ever come close to them and what they mean to me!

But now that I know her so well and I can't imagine not being with her she is the most amazing and beautiful girl out there. I mean of course other's can be "Sexy" but, its different... I wonder all the time how such an awkward night of meeting her turned into one of the most amazing decisions of my life and I don't even know if I deserve her, but I'm extremely lucky|`|t21se9dZaa	Yes I do, I think that my boyfriend is the best man in the world.

dFHsAXDMaa	maybe she realized she was just mad at the time but really loves your illiterate butt can you say spell check.  maybe she is still whiting out all the spelling errors on the papers...... did you have someone help you fill those papers out... did you know judges award wives complete bank accounts, house and kids when husband is illiterate. I swear they really do lol|`|Ikd9cppcaa	1) Maybe she's changed her mind.<br>  2) Maybe she is waiting to sign until she has her own lawyer.|`|FtyLwqR5aa	You might now of put in the papers just what she is wanting and she wants to get her an attorney to take you to the cleaners.|`|mCM363I9aa	have you been drinking?<br>  <br>  she may be really mad at you, what did you do?<br>  either way that's no excuse for her to be threatening you with divorce, she is wrong for doing that if she didn't mean it.|`|gfHutvEFaa	Spell check anyone?|`|IvMPh09baa	put the beer down... and go to bed... what you wrote makes no sense.|`|GEyJMsaKaa	WHAT ARE YOU SAYING!??!?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I can't read your writing...sorry|`|nRCqF6Euaa	Its hard to believe that you could have correctly filled out and filed any kind of legal document.<br>  However just in case you are distraught at loosing your wife and this is the reason that you are incapable of writing a coherent question,<br>  <br>  Keep this in mind " Try getting her sign the papers before you file them" I have no clue how you could ask her to sign something you have already filed.|`|mcUSz16kaa	Since it seems like she is the one who asked for the divorce from you,  you went a head and filed before she did. Therefore, she is probably just making sure that every thing is in order and complete by reading the fine print before she signs anything.  Perhaps she has or is getting a lawyer to look the papers over?|`|tvK1xjzkaa	Ok first please use spell check...if she won't sign the papers take  her to court. You don't have to have a spouse to agree with a divorce to divorce.|`|AA11814313	She won't sign because she probably never thought you would fill them out maybe it was an empty threat now she is going to get nasty....or maybe she will just stay?  Who knows sleep on it tomorrow is always brighter.|`|Y9HWim3Baa	Since she wants the divorce,why didn't she file for it ? And,why do you care if she signs it ?|`|AA12389008	You sound like an asshole......she probably does not understand what you are asking her.....DUH!|`|B1iBGRzUaa	Is this serious? Did u read your post before you posted it?|`|BLaEQfdDaa	man sometimes a woman will say that, but it means we need to talk about things, be honest and open about the marriage , to see what the problems are and what can be done to fix things. IT doesnt mean you just go right to the court house and file and serve papers to her, did you think about that before you did this, doesnt like it!!!!! did you two just sit down and talk about things!!!%2|`|cm7dLGQPaa	If she wants a divorce, tell her to fill her own papers out and file them.  That's kind of her  responsibility. Why does she say she wants a divorce?  And how old  are you?  How long married? From  your question, spelling, and wording not sure if this is a real question or not or if you are just messing with people.  Give more info and maybe you can  get some helpful answers.|`|C9brWMriaa	Your wife probably doesn't want to sign the papers because she really doesn't want a divorce.  She was probably hoping that you would do more to save the marriage than just let it go.|`|qJECm9nFaa	she was probley just threating you to get her way and now she dont want one talk to her

1235333b4f34f1147fc81bf4aef8885baa	First of all, you didn't ruin your family.  You did something a little bit stupid and it snowballed into a huge mess.  Now you all have to deal with the consequences.  This is a horrible thing, but no one's dead or seriously injured, and therefore you'll be able to get over this.  You didn't intend for this to happen and your dad will realize this when he calms down, and he will very likely feel sorry for the spanking he gave you.<br>  <br>  Contrary to what the folks above me have written, I think you got off pretty lightly with the spanking you described.  Even though a bare bottom spanking is a bit awkward when you're sixteen, I think your dad was just acting in the moment.  Be glad that he decided to treat you like a child because if he'd treated you like an adult, you'd probably have a bloody lip instead of a sore rear end.  This was definitely NOT sexual abuse.  In a weird way, it's actual a good sign for you.  As I said, a spanking is a sign that your dad still sees you as a child.  A father will always forgive his child.<br>  <br>  Consequently, if I had ever taken my dad's car without permission, he would have reported me to the police.  If I had a bad attitude about it, or tried it more than once, I guarantee he would have pressed charges.  So as much as a spanking sucked, be glad you have a dad that stands by you.<br>  <br>  For right now, stay in your room.  You probably won't get another spanking for going downstairs, but you will most likely still be entering an instable situation.  Your dad is probably still very angry and, if he hasn't approached you yet, probably isn't ready to communicate with you without anger.  Things will get better when your dad knows what he's dealing with, so far as insurance goes.<br>  <br>  As difficult as this probably sounds, your best bet is to try to get your mind on other things.  Try reading a book or even going to sleep.  Tomorrow is another day and the sooner it comes the better.  Your dad loves you and will be okay in a few days.<br>  <br>  You learned a BIG lesson today about responsibility.  I'm very sorry that you had luck awful enough for this to have happened (what a freak set of events!).|`|3267581d4fe0c877a2fee89c9c9a0c43aa	You screwed up, but I don't think you need me to tell you that.  I doubt that you ruined your family though.  Perhaps trying to talk to your dad will help, not about what you have done, not about your punishment, but about what you can do to help better the situation realistically.  It's safe to say that the lesson you should learn is about thinking of others welfare, and not just your own immediate wants and desires, and yes I understand that it's something not easy for a teenager to do, but if you want to make right it's what you need to do.  If you have a job, start handing over your paycheck or at least a significant portion of it.  If you don't have a job, get one and hand over a significant portion of what you make.  You're going to need to demonstrate a very high level of responsibility and contrition before you regain your parents trust in your judgment, but taking responsibility, and doing it without complaining about the sacrifices you will surely have to make will probably go a long way toward earning it back before you graduate high school.  I can't say that I've been through the exact same situation, but everyone lets their parents down hard at one time or another.  Know that your parents still love you, and don't forget to tell them you love them.|`|6iCOMx8laa	You were stupid, but you did not ruin your family.  A bare bottom spanking at your age is completely inappropriate and could be sexual abuse, not to mention child abuse.  I certainly hope he apologizes. I understand being angry, but to react the way he did is so wrong on many levels and crosses the line - horribly.  You are not 4, it wouldn't be cool at 4 either, but at your age completely wrong.<br>  <br>  Your mom is right and  things will get worked out. Be realistic. Someone will give your dad a ride to work.  I am most concerned about the spanking of a 16 year old girl and the inappropriateness of stripping down your bottom half.<br>  <br>  He doesn't hate you. He is angry and he should be ashamed at his behavior.....I hope he gets a grip on his rage.  <br>  <br>  Talk to your mom tomorrow or tonight if she comes up.  Stay away from  your dad.  <br>  <br>  Again you did not ruin your family. You did something selfish and stupid, but ruin? no....pissed off? yes definitely.|`|7ff91aea1d5f9f19f507ddbc78ae0251aa	kid you are a ******* loser your parent tell you not to do things because things like this can ALWAYS happen. if u had just listened to your parents none of this would have happened. Now your family may go broke, you could lose your house, and you could end up living on the streets. From the way it sounds your parents don't have car theft coverage that means he may have to get a new car but he will still have to pay the loan on the one that was stolen. what you need to do now is run away, run far far away and never go home that way your parents can afford to keep all they have earned. I hope the best for you and your family but at this point you should take my advice. Sorry but i can't help but laugh a little|`|85079b6dff2a2e94bf1574a8cc72b127aa	Ok first off NO you did not ruin your family! Your father is totally freaking right now so its best to just stay put till they say they wanna talk.Let them calm down.Im not sure what will happen with the ins company I have never had a car stolen and I think it depends on whether it was paid off or not.Look you messed up BIG TIME.You are surprised at the reaction of your dad but he is probably as equally surprised with your actions,and no he don't hate you.I just read your question to my husband(who mind you don't spank his little girl or yell  at her) but he said he would of probably have done the same thing.(which shocked me cuz like I said).So let them cool off hun and decide how you are going to help fix the problem...you might want to fill out an application at a fast food restaurant or something throw some cash their way every week.Good luck sweetie!|`|GqTSa85daa	Well, you took a risk and it ended badly.  He will be calmer in the morning and he may get his car back, but you have a long road ahead of you.  Once you betray someones trust, you never get it back fully.  Think of this as a big lesson in life.|`|KSK22vHUaa	What he did to you is TERRIBLE.  You should NEVER raise a hand to your child when you're angry.  I'm in favor of spanking, but not at 16!  And you NEVER spank when you're angry--it hurts the child much more than is necessary!<br>  <br>  What you did was pretty irresponsible, but honestly it's just teenage behavior.  Your parents will get it worked out in the morning.  Just keep your head down and stay quiet until everything is better.  If your dad wants to yell at you, just don't respond.  I know it's difficult.  But the easiest way to make him be quiet is to not respond.  If you yell back, it will infuriate him.  If you try to reason with him, he won't want any of it and will be even more infuriated.  <br>  <br>  Honestly, he needs to be arrested for child abuse.  What he did to you is absolutely deplorable.  There was absolutely no excuse to hit you like that.  <br>  <br>  They don't hate you.  They are just stressed and angry.  It will calm down when they get the car back or when they get insurance money and smooth things over.  Just don't speak to him.  He owes you a hell of an apology.<br>  <br>  You were irresponsible, yes, but that does not make it okay for him to assault you.|`|jpyy7Rjbaa	the problem is you were never spanked before. if you were, you would have more respect for your parents and wouldn't do what you did.<br>  you deserve all that will happen to you and more. you really screwed up........|`|AA12060541	Well, Hate is a strong word, but, yes you messed up pretty bad!  Face it!|`|s4Pf5nXDaa	wow ur stupid...|`|8b3f563be261bd052d81a790eec406d3aa	First of all, I would like to calm u down. You are pretty young and i know how youngsters want to drive around and stuff, you didnt do anything wrong.It was just bad luck that your car keys got stolen. The whole parent situation is understandable. I feel bad for you and your family but I knw 1 thng fr sure. You parents dont hate you , specially your dad.He does not hate you.Parents can never hate their children and its always proven.They always cave. They might stay upset for a few days but theri anger wil go away and their hearts will definitely melt. Ofcourse they have given birth to u and they would never let you suffer. So dont worry, and think about your parents more than your boyfriend cuz parents take priority.Don't worry. Try to help your parents and show them you care. Your dad will be fine and i knw that fr sure.Just give him a couple of days.|`|IO75fz0Haa	You are gonna be yelled at for days.  I would stay out of his way til he calms down then you guys need to sit down and talk.  He has a right to be angry.   But there are gonna be alot more time you piss him off or do something wrong....<br>  <br>  Hang in there|`|Kqsbbc0faa	it was very wrong of you to do of course, because if you would of gotten into an accident and killed someone, they could of sued ur dad, he could of lost the house or anything else, and you would be held accountable for vehicular manslaughter. being young, we dont think about these consequences, and bad things happen when we want to do stuff but aren't allowed to do it. trust me, ive been there..but eventually he will get over it, he is just pissed off because something could of happened to you, your boyfriend, or anyone else for that matter. but in time he will get over it, it may take him a while to trust you again..but he is your father. <br>  give him some space and time to cool off...if he wants to talk to you, he will...<br>  as far as the spanking part, that was a little out of question, but all parents have different ways of punishment, it could be worse.<br>  but just give it time. things will come around, just think of the consequences that could of occurred, and thank god they didnt..but put urself in his shoes.<br>  hes only doing it because he loves you..i know you dont believe it, but its true..<br>  but he didn't have to spank you.....that was a little out of hand though.|`|Y7MWCVziaa	despite what has happend, they will find the car, and ur parents will never hate you. they will forgive you no matter what you did, just give that time. they might loose a little trust and faith, but your thier family, and mistakes happen. give it a year or so and itl be completly fine. and in a few days ur father will be ok, unless he has a temper, than weeks. but it shouldnt take a month. im sorry to hear about this. goodluck.<br>  to add to that, u should rly talk to someone about how he hit u. from my opinion, spanking u is one thing, pulling ur pants down to do that is another. but pulling it all off, that is just wrong! sexual abuse. thats what that sounds like to me. that makes me sick!|`|c0vMidR0aa	Sometimes when we become so angry our own fears push us to the limit. I think after he cools off your Father will forgive you, things will seem different when he talks to the insurance company. For the time being give him time to think things over give him his space to calm down. So many things could have happen I am sure you scared him half to death as well as disappointing him think of the embarrassment you caused him. After that stunt I would hav taken you license away untill you were 18.|`|fNmmC03Caa	First of all your dad will forgive you. He might not trust for for a long time but he will forgive you.<br>  <br>  Now the speech...WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?? If you had just went to the BF house that would have been bad but you could have gotten out of it. Going to the mall was your biggest mistake. <br>  <br>  Look at it from your parents point of view. Do you know if you were on the insurance yet? What if they had come back early and reported the car stolen? What if there was an accident?<br>  <br>  Your data is mad but a lot of it is likely worry for your safety. Forgive him and give him time to cool off. <br>  <br>  Peace.|`|pkdM4j9Raa	Baby girl, your mom is right!  It sounds as if your dad went a little nut's over the ordeal!  I don't think that he handled himself especially at your age very well.  It sounds to me that you are pretty much a responsible and good child.  We do things when we are young and older that we don't realize the outcome can really have a bad impact on our lives.  I also think that, that is the reason for a mom & a dad, we think differently than a man does. I use to counsel Tough Love kids when the regular counselor was out.  I think you|`|qAGeCYVlaa	Well number one it's a little weird that you're sixteen and getting spanked. Number two it's a very big deal that you got his car stolen, but cars come and go and family is forever. No matter how cliche' that sounds, it is very true. Just let your dad be for awhile, and he'll talk to you when he's ready. I wish you the best of luck.|`|tRyjvs49aa	Hahahahahahahasucks for you.<br>  PS you spoiled brat<br>  i have been spanked millions of times as a kid<br>  and it worked out fine<br>  i beleive in a good spank every once in a while|`|SsfnitjXaa	Maybe your aunt or uncle could loan them one of their cars or at least drive him to work.|`|JIvvg6f7aa	lower your britches and prepare for the switches|`|AAgX0SDcaa	ooh he pulled your pants down in a public place and whipped you? I bet that drew a crowd.|`|6juV48RWaa	No you did not ruin your family! In todays world, it will be easy to locate the car and get it back. I'm 17 and I've been in situations similar to this and everything was okay by the next day. Just go downstairs and cry and apologize and hug you're dad. It will all be okay :)|`|baQpo0kdaa	PLEASE JUST RELAX.  Your sixteen and sixteen year olds f up all the time and their parents flip out.  after a couple days it will all be okay. I know your dad is acting like it's the end of the world right now, but your mom is there to calm him down and i'm sure SOMEONE will give him a ride for a few weeks.  I dont know what type of insurance coverage he have on the car but they may be able to give him a loner car. I know it was horrible getting a spanking (i've never gotten one either!)  and getting one at 16 must suck really bad, but i bet by the end of the week your dad will be apologizing to YOU for flipping out like that! You f'd up and you can't go back now. Just try to understand that your family is not ruined and worse things has happened. Good luck.|`|xgui1LAFaa	1)your dad will always love you, its just given.<br>  2)Not did u just get the car stolen, u did this knowing you guys are in a recession.<br>  3)If insurance doesn't cover it and what not, then your dad will have to get a new cheap car or walk or something<br>  4) u didnt ruin the family<br>  5) ur dad shouldnt have spanked u at 16
dHH4Rl2yaa	I'd say if she's taking off your shirt, she's probably loving it.  Listen to what makes her react the most and do that more often or maybe slower for a really sexual effect.  Most girls love to have their neck kissed, so you're probably getting her off.  Play with her hair a bit and hold her face likes she's the most beautiful thing you've ever seen.  You could tease her by barely touching her neck with your lips.  Brush them by her neck and make her want you to kiss it so bad.  Maybe go down a bit to her chest if your comfortable.  Some girls love being kissed near or on their breasts.  I personally think its amazing.  I'd say when she breathes the heaviest and moans the most, you've found her favorite things.|`|C9brWMriaa	Sounds like you are doing just fine to me.  I would just keep it up.  Also you should ask her what else would she like you to do.  Only a woman knows what makes her feel good.|`|lg6jexk7aa	Its important to start of gentle and make sure you don't focus on the one spot for too long as then this area can get sore.<br>  <br>  A little soft ear lobe nibbling usually helps too|`|C1dRwOWAaa	You should stroke the small of her back, and move around a bit like down towards her chest, ears, etc ;)|`|5v65I0Jmaa	DONT DO IT i got a ugly ugly hickie today on my neck/check and ear ugh dont do it|`|xyolNO8saa	pay attention to what she does,<br>  it's usually what she wants from you.|`|ObnYA9lxaa	yo dawg its liek dis, fisrt u get sum KFC den u eats it.|`|NctuEmFKaa	How old are you? Is this your first girl? Why is this in the married section? LOL ok sorry, your question made me laugh.<br>  <br>  My advice from a girl's point of view: I like it when he lightly (as in not leaving a hickey) sucks on my neck. Or even lightly raking his teeth on my neck.  Try nibbling on her ear, all this does it for me and the neck is a great turn on for girl's and guys.  <br>  <br>  The licking really fast, not so much a turn on, take your time honey, it's not a race!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|J1wg2Thjaa	well to help u know that ur pleasureing hr u can ube on her a lil that helps alot|`|CEKZsoFRaa	just be gentle, make sure the breathe is right and the lips aren't crusty|`|kHSPH0RBaa	BE GENTLE AND MAKE SURE YOUR LIPS ARE VERY VERY VERY MOIST,|`|dlaS6e7zaa	Wear deodorant. =)|`|I5SypMlsaa	she slready enjoys it a lot, move on...|`|zSpFXIrfaa	blow into her ear|`|dFHsAXDMaa	LOL why do people over analyze everything obviously she is enjoying it or she would not be doing it and do not rush sex let it happen naturally.... if she does not wanna give you the hand job you desire God gave you two hands. And trust me she is getting wet just like you you just are not getting the chance to see it lol<br>  <br>  And I agree with hickey  girl who said no hickeys they are ugly and show a lack of class... <br>  <br>  As a nurse and a women can tell you she is definitely not having an orgasm from kissing lol takes a little more than that....

pkAXMWSdaa	I think she should sit down with her parents and have an adult conversation with them. Her parents (as hard as it may seem) are just concerned for her, though it's horrible that her father is rarely around. Tell her to just sit down and have her explain to them that she's been feeling a lot of stress lately due to various issues and that she feels she'd do better if she were to separate herself from that enviornment for awhile. Once she does that and (hopefully) improves her grades next semester, her parents will see that she really is better off that way. In the meantime, I think she should focus on getting her grades up now. I understand that family problems effect every part of your life, but she needs to motivate herself to do better and make the most of her education. <br>  <br>  It sounds like you really do care about her; she's lucky to have a friend like you :D I wish her the best of luck in this situation, because I know family problems at home can be really tough.|`|2fKwfBY5aa	well the only thing i would tell her is to just tell them how she feels, i put myself in that same position, she cant beat around the bush with her parents, that will only make things worse, but once i stood up and told my parents what the problem was they understood why i wanted to move out for college.
QAiyrzZbaa	well im fourteen and  you really need to speak from your heart no matter how much you want to seem all cool and stuff. just write her a note or text and tell her you were so nervous tht you diddnt no wat to say, tell her you were really stupid and tht you realize what you did hurt her and you would never want to hurt her. tell her tht you would beg for another chance if she asked you to then ask her to put your stupid remark behind her and ask her to hopefully, move on with you. tell her how you really feel. no matter how mushy gushy it is. girls love tht stuff. they want a perfect sensitive farrytale guy|`|UfOP3xtcaa	Okay this happened a long time ago. Quit kissing her butt. She only acts mad at you to see what you will do next, to make it up to her. Tell her that you are sorry but you are not going to spend the rest of your life trying to make it up to her and that she needs to get over herself that this huge world does not revolve around her.|`|bWCmgZnNaa	if she's not willing to forgive and forget then don't waste your breathe. it's better to go after someone that will forgive you no matter what than chase someone that doesn't want to work things out. if she still has a grudge about this for more than two years then she has some problems. there are plenty of fish in the sea. getting through this builds character! good luck!|`|AA11573916	pick her some flowers and a note. tell her what a meat head you were  .dont focuse on dating her try to b a freind.why did u say it ?tring to impress your freinds huh. if im right tell her u didnt mean it and u were being a follower. and u realize how much her freindship means to you . tell her that it bothers you that shes mad at you.|`|KiUlBCEPaa	First of all , you are 13 .... you have no real idea what love is.If you have tried everything , telling her face to face , writing her a letter , phone call etc ... then give it up.When she is ready to forgive you then take from there. Until then there are more impotant things for you to worry about , like school.If you keep harassing her about it it could cause you trouble ,,,, ever heard of stalking?|`|Mz8tua19aa	good thing is u r 13, no need to worry my friend. it isnt true love so u do not need to worry. and if u like the chic alot, become an asshole . only do it for a while. trust me man it works it sounds  screwy. im 27 i have seen a few things it works.. act like it dont bother you man ... if u r trying this hard and she dont appreciate move on bro... good luck|`|ohHKylkPaa	Hey! its okay i mean you can always try to get over it but anyways just tell her you were little and immature and you didnt know she might forgive you also say "hey i think we should get over this can u just listen to me for a minute" yeah that should work!<br>  <br>  Hey please awnser my question!!!!!!!!<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ArpB9bpIeIu2bdn3SUU2RUwazKIX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222145610AAvuY1T">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  thanks!|`|a7a3379686a9b62bae0a4c14b66f9b47aa	Awww, yur 13 and you love her? thats cute, I remember when i wus like that.<br>  But yu should jus tell her how you really felt that time and tell her how much yu like her and if yu want yu can apologize too.<br>  Singing love songs always work for girls [= trust me.|`|AA11179568	tell her<br>  sincerely<br>  "i'm stupid last time, i didnt mean to say that, ill admit that im wrong, and i'll also admit that i really really love you<br>  please forgive me for my stupidity<br>  and give me another chance<br>  i promise i wont fail you this time<br>  im sorry"<br>  <br>  be humble bring down your pride<br>  <br>  mine?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AlCdlhmnx6Xir0bOZ5T6J0vsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222185037AAmOA4l">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|qGBVcV3naa	you love her?<br>  why the hell did you say that then.<br>  Well, she'll probably get over it later on.<br>  So just be nice and friendly.<br>  Don't act too immature.|`|pZ2fA8VZaa	would be nice to know what you said...but you should just tell her how you feel and that since then you have really matured and you really like her|`|0kV5H5J6aa	Shes being immature and needs to get over it.|`|AA11461524	you should talk  to her, and tell her your sorry.|`|UOSrSEqHaa	slap that hoe.|`|uzPi9dPraa	Tell her your sorry..she shouldn't hold a grudge on you for it.|`|fAchVcPzaa	um email me. easyriderk1@yahoo.com.. i think i can help i am 13 too and i have had lots of those experiences. might be able to help man|`|AA10147255	First of all, to anyone saying it's impossible to have true love for someone at 13, **** you all. Not every part of everyone's mind develops at the same rate. I'm 19 now and I still care about a girl I met when I was 13, even though I haven't seen her in 2 years, and I cared about her just as much when I was 13 as I did when I was 15, and as I do now. I've now given up on the relationship, but if I could have any one thing in the world, it would be her. <br>     On to your situation though... Now I'm not saying it's true love, it's PROBABLY not. But even if it's not, you clearly have very strong feelings for her at the very least, and it seems to be plagueing your mind quite a bit, so you should at least continue to try to help her understand that you really care for her in a way that you do not care for any other girls... and the only reason that you spouted that dumb line is because you were so nervous, because you had liked her for so long and just freaked out and said something dumb. It should be a higher priority to help her understand that you really care than to get her gifts and try to bribe her into affection. Help her understand how you really feel, and you'll have at least taken the first step.|`|iOGMa8jVaa	Tell her all this. Apologize to her about what you said, but also remind her that you were only in 5th grade at the time, and it shouldn't have been taken seriously. Let bygones be bygones, and start anew. Besides, all that matters is how you feel NOW. <br>  <br>  P.s, Flowers and chocolates are also a very nice way to say "I'm sorry".|`|Yewz4L9saa	Being 13yrs old you know better now.  She should have gotten past that by now.  Keep speaking to her and maybe she will see how much<br>  you still like her.|`|n7XFyQvuaa	WHAT DID YU SAY?<br>  <br>  but either way...she needs to get over it!<br>  Yu were small!!!|`|q2POh1dEaa	LOL.<br>  <br>  It was 5th grade.<br>  <br>  Build a bridge.|`|WXCa8zQoaa	gifts are cool and all but girls see those objects from people their mad at as kinda insults in a way like he did this to me and now he is sucking up . what you need to do is talk to her face to face or on the phone or give a note to her saying that you are sorry and why you did it . that should make her feel a bit better if she knows why you did that to her|`|XJlD2kPsaa	It would help if you told us what you said and yeah.. but i guess you should tell her you weren't ready and you were caught off guard and tell her your sorry... really there's not too much you can do. Maybe buy her like a stuffed animal too or something and then ask her out so she knows you mean it :D|`|Sg0gCtEAaa	please go to bed, there is school tomorrow|`|M1OJ3oFeaa	what did u say?|`|Y5rminCNaa	Do you two have dialogue at all? If not I would write her a heartfelt letter and maybe give her flowers, leave them on her front steps and ring the doorbell. Don't give it to her at school or somewhere she won't be able to read it and absorb it alone and without being distracted. Lay out how you feel and let her know that you messed up, and are so sad that you are still dealing with the consequences of what you said. If she's worth it, she will read it, understand how you feel, and you two can go from there. I wish you the best of luck.|`|zRc4Swewaa	Don't send gifts anymore because gifts will only insult her.Better send her a letter and write what you really feel about her. Or approach her and her tell her how sorry you are.Tell her that you got nervous when she invited you then.The most important of all is to show and convince her that you are really sorry about what happened and do your best.Not only in words,do it in your actions.Action speaks better than words.If you really love her ask for her forgiveness,even though she refuses don't give up,just try until she forgives you.Goodluck!|`|swigidUeaa	what did you say?<br>  <br>  <br>  well, you need to forget about her, if you said that and she's still mad, she's not worth it. dosent she know guys always say stupid things?<br>  <br>  If your not in the mood to forget about her, then do really sweet things for her until she caves. randomly drop a note in her locker or sneak it into her notebook. do really nice things, that you would do for anyother person, except be nicer to her.|`|XYBCQz8Naa	2 years ago and shes still madd, woah....u mustve said something pretty bad. the only thing i can think of is to do something thats going to get you embarassed pretty bad (and u have to do this in front of her), this will show her what you are willing to do for her.<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|Q6BcFTM8aa	just TEL HER how you feel kid...<br>  be real with it|`|pJZBdpehaa	"Okay im 13 years old"<br>  <br>  I stopped reading from there, grow up.|`|luD0tMRbaa	email me or chat i can help u with alot i keep secreats i keep personal things its happend to me email me and if anybody body else needs help email dr.ferret@ymail.com|`|qmQ1RDL9aa	you need to say what you said. it will help. but sorry works well
eCtrOR3Baa	Go to your local mall and hit up one of the "girly" jewelry stores (like Claires or the Icing). They sell chains and charms you can pick out on  your own for pretty cheap. You can buy the chain and some charms that either show her how you feel (a heart, etc.) or things that she likes and put them on it for her. The store will also give you a jewelry box so you can have it nicely wrapped for her.
x7eI1l4Maa	Sex is only a big deal if you make it out to be, this is for both people in the relationship. There's nothing wrong with wanting to cuddle and show affection in ways that don't involve intercourse. I agree that trust is one of the biggest things you need in a healthy relationship, because if you can't trust them or visa versa it'll just end on bad terms and the happiness is gone QUICK. Keep up the good work buddy :)|`|7cbIlyMeaa	no, just a complement.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Trust and communication is the most important thing in a relationship.

1UfTec9Haa	Well...I think that she really likes you. Soo I think that you should get to know her, then go for it if you feel the same way about her. I also don't think that the 2 hour difference should really make a difference, because you both can drive!! "D <br>  Hope This Helps Matt!!<br>  ~Kenna<3|`|zIrTm8Ymaa	do u like her does she like u add more information bout the situation|`|LYDVekF1aa	Keep talking to her.

EvWdZ8alaa	You offer them a prize, lets say cookies, if they behave.<br>  They will want to have the cookies, so they'll be extra nice to get them.<br>  (Also works with ice cream!)|`|apSTH4TIaa	Distract them with something they like.  Cookies and icecream work, but so does playing a game, using sidewalk chalk, coloring, bubbles.  I don't know how old they are, but find something they will like and make it fun.  Yelling at a bunch of kids you are babysitting will only make them act more like pests.  It's not your fault you are 11.  Kids are like that, they like to see how far they can get.  Don't let them see you sweat and it will all work out.|`|FXCoGD44aa	Designate an activity for each of them to do. It's not that they are purposely trying to frustrate you, it's that they are looking for stimulation.<br>  <br>  I've found that coloring works great for every kid. Try laying out crayons and paper. Make it funner by saying, "I wonder who can draw me the scariest dinosaur!" <br>  <br>  You can break out some active games like Twister, or start up a game of hide-and-seek.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't bribe them with sweets. Only do this as a last resort. Kids should be able to respect and behave with their guardian without having to be coerced.|`|7RbootLlaa	There isn't much you can do. It's not right. You should not have that responsibility at your age. It's an adult's job to do that.<br>  If this is happening all the time, and you have tried talking to these children's parents and they are not interested. You could talk to a teacher/counsellor at your school and tell them what is going on. If they care they will do something about it.
2tuiUiXkaa	You'll probably still like him, since its hard to just stop liking someone, but I'd say that you should stay away. 21 is a little old for you at 16, I think, and being around with lots of girls and having a kid just doesn't sound like a situation that you want to get yourself into.|`|5VXm2Cc8aa	stay away some older men jus want you for your panties andif you cant tell  the difference sit back from dating and observe other relationships|`|4AKiarekaa	stay awayyyy<br>  once a player its rele hard for one to change <br>  so no doubt he'll do it again|`|41S75G5Eaa	maybe you should stay away from him if you dont want him to end up in jail...|`|IVcxIDXZaa	NOOOOOOOOOO, stay away.<br>  try mine<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090222172041AAJ3QAo">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|1NyloIhtaa	i wud stay away but thats just my opinion<br>  go with watevr u think is best|`|nqMA4AWQaa	He's 21 and you're only 16.

Better be careful....|`|8ZUs3qxxaa	Girl, what kind of question is that?!<br>  Noooooo...if he goes through millions of girls like grease, what makes you think he'll seriously like you back?<br>  Who cares if he's cute?

Are you like, desperate for someone to like or something?<br>  And you say he has a baby?

6eJm757Laa	Tell him the truth. Let him know that you had a party and that someone took your iPod. I am sure he would understand the problem. Your dad will be proud of you for telling the truth.|`|Y5RJLkG7aa	You could say someone took your ipod and you dont know when u dont have to menchine the party just tell him someone must have taken it when i wasnt looking   just dont tell him it was in the house|`|HFKr2vBsaa	honesty is the best policy, just tell him.|`|hTieELhTaa	how bout saying someone stole it from your locker.

So tell him you lost it at school or some random place.|`|77YWNCV5aa	How old are you?|`|IfRLlrLSaa	Well first tell him that you are really sorry and that it will never happen again, but dont tell him about what happened yet. when he asks, tell him about it. Now if i were you i would tell him that u will work it off or take it out of your allowance or something like that. If he doesnt know about the party, i would tell him and if he sed not to have one tell him u are really sorry it happened and wiil never again. you might get grounded but he will be happy that you were honest. best of luck!|`|IB4ACy4maa	well first I would contact the police.<br>  My i-pod got stolen and I contact the po pos and they got it back to me.<br>  Just make sure you have your i-pod's serial number because if they try to charge it and the cops know your serial number they can catch them.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.<br>  Call me...|`|sys48nMIaa	Ahh...<br>  this has happened to me my friend. <br>  assuming you go to school say some kid stole it from you there. Or you can say you WENT to a party and it got stolen.|`|z0NftlaLaa	Just tell him that you had a little too much to drink and you forget to hide your ipod at your party. Im sure he'll understand.|`|EhEdOojOaa	Just be honest.  Get scolded and be done with it! :-)  You'll be fine.

BQN7j62Faa	Talk to him.
P5LC2fdWaa	awh! it is perfectly normal to feel moree comfortable around friends (i know i sound like an old lady) but maybe if you think about what your friends are doing and how you could have a lot more friends if you just step it up a notch then i think you will be fine! you don't need to change, you just need to show other people what you can do and who you really are! it will get better! and if that still doesn't work then maybe you could bring your friends (or 1 friend) and meet some new people so they see you for who you really are! and then you will make more friends, until most of your class is your friend then you will feel moree comfortable in class and everywhere! hope i helped! haha. good luck! you will do great! :-D|`|Tja1NM78aa	I was always labelled as the shy girl in class - ever since my early nursery days. Lately I got the feeling that maybe I was a bit TOO shy and took an online psychology test...turns out I'm social phobic and regularly suffer from anxiety panic attacks.<br>  I don't talk in class because I'm afraid that they'll judge me and not like me and I hate to be embarrased (social phobia is a fear of being embarassed). I have to think about EVERYTHING I say before I say it, but when I'm with friends who know me and love me for my awkwardness I can be totally relaxed because I know that even if I embarass myself, they won't mind cos they know I'm not an idiot.<br>  <br>  Do you feel like you are constantly being watched and judged? D'you suffer from blushing when being put on the spot in class or sweaty palms or anything like that? I'm not saying you're social phobic, that's just my own experience. I haven't learned to control it but I know that I've got self-confidence issues that need to be sorted with a psychologist. Apparently admission of the condition and seeking help is the first step towards getting better. Going to the GP is the worst thing ever, but maybe your friends could help you out a bit?<br>  One of my friends is is real loudmouth and I kind of speak through her. Maybe around your friends, you would be more confident to talk to others? <br>  <br>  You can't dramatically change your personality, you (and other) should accept yourself as you are...a shy person. Some people like quiet personalities as opposed to the loud and brash ones.<br>  But yeah, see a psychologist about the self-confidence thing and talk to your friends. :) xx|`|Vb8yWZyLaa	you sound just like me... i have the same problem i am majorly shy!! but I'm starting to get out of the habit of not talking... so try this.. the next time your in class just start talking to the person next to you... you never know you might become friends...or the next time there is a class project and you need partners pick someone you normally wouldn't and start talking to them... i mean I'm not completely out of my shell yet...but hey I'm getting there!<br>  best of luck<br>  EAB|`|LE09g68gaa	Girl, im the exact same way.<br>  Seriously.<br>  In class, i just try to give my opinion on things a little more.<br>  I keep in mind that i wanna have more friends and that im gonna keep seeing the people in class alot so i might as well become friends with them.<br>  Try to get out of your comfort zone and try experiencing new things slowly.<br>  Who knows, the word "shy" wont be in your vocabulary any more in time.<br>  =]|`|TqBM7ZSgaa	its hard to answer a question like this everyone is different i was the same way and still am in some ways as i get older i care less about what people think im 24 now a few years ago you couldn't get me to pick up a phone and talk to people. Then i got a job in retail and i had to talk to people to sell stuff and it got easier over time. It will be hard but try putting your self in more social situations more small groups at first or get a job that has you interact with Alto of people so you get used to talking and interacting with people kinda like practice. Talking to the opposite sex helps aslo the girls i work with were good practice for flirting with girls and seeing how they react to me and my personallity. Good luck it takes time but you'll come out of your shell|`|LYDVekF1aa	Just start talking to someone. Listen to what they are talking about and join in. Its a perfect way to make new friends and soon enough you wont be so quiet.|`|VNbmDjCRaa	you should be your self try not being shy|`|5iOHJHUzaa	Go to the library or bookstore or amazon.com and get the book Goodbye to Shy- By Leil Lowndes. It will definitely help you.|`|aKkDWz5Waa	being urself comes more naturally when ur confident nd 100% happy with who u r. u may think u r, but if ur having troubles, than obviously not..|`|TRogTUQnaa	I think you're wrong to think that being shy prevents you from being yourself.  It prevents you from acting obnoxious in class, but who says that that's you.  It's okay to be shy in class and more open when it's just your friends.  That's how most people are.  I love shy people because I don't get sick of them as fast and it's more interesting to get to know their personality.|`|20da7e19a185ca8c01b2a311761afcd6aa	be confident in yourself. i used to have this problem. When your out in the open, like in class, or somewhere crowded, you tend to think everyone sees your faults, and that everyone thinks bad about you.<br>  Do you usually feel confident while walking out the door, but when you get to a different place you suddenly act quiet and shy? Well, stop thinking about what other people think. They probably just see you as a normal person. Say whatever is on your mind.|`|8gOIc4dMaa	Be spontaneous. I was shy and then i starting just shouting out stuff and people thought i was funny. They respected me and now i made like 10 new friends. Just try it out. It cant hurt.|`|HcCuqGYiaa	i have same problem it suck

Why waste time flirting and all those mind games? Just come out and tell him that he seems like a nice guy and why don't you guys go catch a movie or go out for dinner or something. Why do girls have to flirt and dream about guys and wonder and on and on and on and on,  ad nauseam? If you like him, ask him out, and if it doesn't work, go on to another guy. Flirting seems like a total waste of time. He might have a girlfriend for all you know. I mean what if a guy flirted with you and didn't ask you out? If guys flirted and did not ask out, ask to marry, the human race would be extinct like the dinosaurs.<br>  Just do it! What if he says yes? I have gone out with girls that asked me out. Maybe he is shy. Or he hasn't thought of it. So, go ask him. No flirting. Go ask him. What is the worst thing that can happen? He has a girlfriend. He doesn't think you two are compatible. Either way, he would be a waste of your time. If he is available and he likes you, you can cut to the chase and get right down to it. Love does not wait, so get going!|`|4Lzf3wenaa	Definitely just show you're interested.  Since I'm a guy this is making fun of myself, but guys are dense.  At least I found that out with my first girlfriend.  I was so dense and i didn't even realize it.  Start making conversation with him, that will make you more comfortable.  Then, begin to show him you like him (little nudges, talking nicely, etc.).  Good Luck!|`|go6FjwpNaa	Be subtle at first with your flirting and see how he takes to it.  <br>  <br>  If he bites, gradually kick it up a notch|`|RiRA86psaa	You can't get a guy to like you but if you show an interest in him he is more apt to show interest in you if he already likes you.|`|OxsTrJcjaa	ummm  just talk to him<br>  <br>  answer mine please<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AoGfFWYya5mTtd15Rb7Y5Jbsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222161244AAOKLiB">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|Mxe36NZEaa	You can't force a guy to like you.

However, do chat with him and get to know him better so that both of you have more topics to talk about. This will greatly help to increase your chance of getting notice by him. Remember always be yourself as each person has his or her own unique point of atttraction. Do not rush things as feeling needs time to gather but remember to chat more with him so that he will notice you. Good Luck to you and happy as always.|`|CejKLjtcaa	you have to show signs that you like him i know it might be hard for you but if he likes you too then hee will ask you out.  and im gonna go kinda in depth with this next thing but idc so if you need to let him know you like him you get a friend to say what you like (whoever you like) then have a back up story.|`|UTQjqk4Baa	well first of all you can't make anyone like you if you really like this guy look at how he moves when he is around you if he smiles at you looks at you in a kind of flirty way then you would know for sure and if he flirts with you then you flirt with him|`|LpJFTU2oaa	Trip and fall in front of him and see if he helps you up.

mCpC4Zjbaa	Well you didn't give me much information to go with, but I can give you some general advice. <br>  <br>  It is good to act natural and to be yourself, but if you are really nervous (which you must be if you're asking for advice) that might be a little difficult. <br>  <br>  I can give you some general guidelines!<br>  <br>  1) On the first date you never want to get into topics that are too heavy (ex. ex- boyfriends, politics), this could cause an argument or tension between the two of you, and cause him to judge you on things that don't really matter<br>  <br>  2) Guy will ask you a lot of questions about yourself, becaaaauuusee they know that girls like to talk, and this just makes it easier for them. However, they don't always want to listen. I.e. if he asks you where you got your awesome outfit he probably doesn't want to have a ten minute discussion about it. <br>  <br>  3) It is good to talk about yourself in a very positive way, without going too indepth. At the end turn it back around to him, so you can really get to know him. This isn't about getting him to like you... it's about seeing if he is right for you!! <br>  <br>  4) When you turn it back to him, ask him questions that will really spark his interest, and breifly relate between questions so it doesn't sound like an interview. For example, Ohh cool you play rugby... how long have you been doing that for? Good for you, I did a lot of dance while I was growing up.  I don't know if I could do such a rough sport... is it true there are lots of injuries?<br>  <br>  Guys like it when you pet their ego! trust me... so if you spend a lot of time letting him do the talking it will make him feel important. Worse case scenario this way is that HE talks too much and feels self-conscious about it, so he asks you out again, so he can make a better impression and spend some time letting YOU do the talking ( and by this time you'll know what type of conversations will intrigue him)!!<br>  <br>  Another little tip is to make suttle contact when you two are "relating" to eachother. For example, if he makes a joke then you can laugh and softly touch his knee to emphasize that you are with him on this. Or if he makes a point you can relate with you can say something like ," oh i know!" and softly touch his knee. I think it just makes people feel more connected... you'll notice that waitors use this technique.<br>  You just have to do it without freaking him out!!<br>  <br>  Good luck chicky poo!|`|CkSEpHhzaa	no wayyy! im so happy for youuu!!! ahhh i wish my crush would do thatt! but anywayy dont get like overexcited when ur with him and no matter how nevous you are, try to act calm.<br>  be yourself:]|`|Zqw7e8Uwaa	well start out by say by say yes buy you set the time say you have something and you can hang out at this time "?". Then ask where you should meet so you can judge what to wear, don't be late, but not early. and if you are going to the movies or dinner don't wait for him to pay if he doesn't go for the check right away if he says he has it say he can pay next time so it makes it look you are interested in a second date! good luck|`|ZwLpzNI6aa	Just take it cool, you may like him a lotttt, but try to observer how he responds to you. It's not worth it if he's just going with you to "get with you" and move on. Just be careful girl, don't want you to get hurt.<br>  <br>  Talk to him about himself and if he's uncomfortable try to find something you have in common maybe a class, the school, the city. Anything but politics haha.<br>  <br>  Just don't follow any advice that says to act uninterested, theres nothing more that pisses guys off than false uninterest. He'll drop you not keep on going after you. There's a point where a guy wants what he can't have and theres a point where he just stops caring. Be careful.<br>  <br>  Above all else have fun!|`|J6yvMr2taa	...hmmm juz like what others said, be yourself and have self discipline... about conversiating with the guy, you juz have to ask him interesting questions not those questions that can only produce a answer like yes or no.. for example you watched a movie or a concert... you can ask him, "how do you find the concert or what can you say about their performance?" those way of asking can give more conversations and some explainations which would give you  more time to talk and know eachother...|`|GRtq4e2Haa	Is it like a date? And where would you be "hanging out" at? Just make sure to be yourself. Its not really cool for anyone to try to be someone they really aren't when they are interested in someone. Hopefully if it all goes well he will say that he will want to hang out again. Good luck =)|`|avLevOx2aa	Here's the best news I can give you. You think you're nervous? Multiply your nervousness by 1,000 and that's how nervous he is! You are totally in the driver's seat in this situation. Have fun!|`|IJ4iv4Wsaa	Talk about things you like.<br>  ask him about himself,<br>  talk about music, video games, cars...!<br>  make sure you know about that stuff tho lol (:|`|8HXAYTPqaa	say it sly and be confident and cool. If you dont know him that well, ask him casually about his family and stuff. Like if he has brothers or sisters or if hes in any sports or something|`|3IvBpjrMaa	be yourself don't let nerves turn you into something your not, you'll end up saying something really stupid.

Just be yourself and not all over-excited cuz that might make him feel weird. What you should do (this is just if you don't know him all that well) is ask him something about himself. Something like "what's your favorite sport?" and then just let him talk about himself. And when he's talking, pay attention to what he's saying and you might find points where you can jump in and talk about yourself.<br>  <br>  To start off the "conversation" you could ask him things like "How's school/college/work?" or "What do you think of this teacher?".<br>  <br>  Now, if you know the guy (say you were from the same elementary school), you could reminisce with him about the old days. You'd both probably have a LOT of memories to share. :)|`|JV0i77uiaa	ask him about sport, what kind of restaurant he likes, what kind of clothes he like to wear and when get more aquainted you ask him what kind of girl he likes.

I am a goofy person and im always bouncing all over the place and bringing up conversations like tv shows: for the love of ray j or I love moneyl you can talk about past relationships where you want to vacation this summer; say something about what he's wearing ask him questions about him guys like that and I am very nosey and good at that too!|`|P8O3dmmXaa	calm down, this is your chance, he is into u.... and just talk about your likes and dislikes maybe u have things in common talk about your favorite color and music and stuff, like maybe urselfs, get really pretty and dress up nicely.... have fun and be urself!!!|`|iU4Q2GOdaa	anything. the most important thing to keep in mind is that he asked YOU to hang out, so he likes you and WANTS to talk to you. the topic is not very important as long as the conversation keeps going smoothly.|`|20da7e19a185ca8c01b2a311761afcd6aa	Just be yourself. Make sure you walk out the door with confidence. Talk to him like you would to a friend.

Y4J6hXajaa	Yes! Tell your dad first. Don't go straight to the police or your dad might think you don't trust him and he won't trust you ever again. Tell your dad, and then if he thinks you need to go to the law about it, which you should, because rape is not a thing to be taken lightly, then do it. Don't take that kind of shxt from anyone.|`|iR7StHksaa	TELL DUH!!!!!!!|`|QSUg9vNLaa	Idiot. of course.<br>  <br>  i bet ur a troll...<br>  <br>  if not<br>  then yes|`|zIrTm8Ymaa	girl tell the police your dad and if you not scarred whoop his tail and if you got older siblings tell them

Would u really like to see him with another woman?|`|ub2Dtzn0aa	Sounds like a winner to me. It could work if you both of you are on the same page and everything is kept in the open. It sounds like fun for the threesomes at first but then your going to have 2 women nagging your *** 24/7? Oh hell to the naw. I'd like another girl around now and again for some fun but not an all the time thing.|`|yhEDUN6qaa	I'm sure it happens and things work out for some people. A lot of people will forbid it and- to me- it's with good reason. Think it through, think about any consequences, and always always do what you want. As for me, I wouldn't do it because I know I'd become a raging jealous *****!|`|CWgJ7Yyxaa	Not a good idea.<br>  <br>  Once you open a can of worms this big, things will NEVER be the same.

Some fantasies are best left as just that.|`|NctuEmFKaa	A friend of mine, is bi but loves her husband with all her heart.  His fantasy was to be with her and another woman, or to even just watch her with another woman.  She brought one of her friends home and proceeded to give him his fantasy of a threesome.  She then got jealous because she felt he was showing the "new" girl more attention than his wife.  Needless to say, he still likes watching her with another chic, but he isn't "allowed" to join in anymore.  <br>  <br>  FYI She is not friends with the girl anymore either.|`|DzAFT8VDaa	I had a male friend who did some wife swapping that came back to bite him in the ****. He is now unhappily divorced (guess who she left him for?) <br>  <br>  I think this is trouble with a capital 'T' especially if you are a jealous prone person. To each his own, but it would not work for me. Too much havoc on the woman and if you have kids...<br>  <br>  Quash that talk NOW.|`|herwbUsFaa	ask him if he would mind if another man joined in if he says no than bring in a girl if he says no than let that be the end of it|`|ijjpYG6Faa	wow! your a awesome wife, and hes lucky, sounds like fun and if both of you are kool like that then so be it, sounds like fun :)|`|IpWTMetHaa	Where is the mutual respect???|`|yIGVOqXdaa	BIG MISTAKE!|`|U2tkgYK6aa	you have not said if this is what you want,|`|A2Zo7eZWaa	omg are u kidding me one word WIERD!!!!!!!|`|GXoxnaS8aa	What if he starts liking her more than you...are you prepare for that ?

But what else is new? Chris Brown sucks. There is no justification whatsoever why he manhandled Rihanna. No man should hit a woman, no matter is the provocation. Chris Brown sucks, and it is but fitting for him to go to jail. Look at OJ, he is now reaping his karma.|`|az0Z0DIjaa	Yep. It's crazy. But Chris Brown does need to go to jail.|`|Tt2pFEqFaa	Yep, we live in a weird world! Chris Brown is totally done career-wise!|`|AA10702820	I'm not saying that this stuff is something typical you see around you everyday when you walk down the sidewalk but it shouldn't be much of a surprise because there have always been people like this in the world. Its just that they probably didn't get as much publicity as the Chris/Rihanna thing going on. There have always been abusive relationships and people killing someone else. When you're a celeb though a lot of people look up to you for whatever reason (money, clothes, car, home,etc) and they always wanna know what you're doing. So when stuff like this happens the media gets involved and it gets way more recognition than say an average person doing this because they're celebs and a lot of people know who they are.<br>  <br>  I am sorry for what happened to Rihanna. And also I find it unfair how many celebs can get the easy way out for the crimes they commit just because they are famous but this is the kind of society we live in. Celebs often get special treatment than an average person and until many people can understand that wealth and fame shouldn't define a person and allow them to be different from people who are very well just as equal to them, you will continue to hear about stuff like this.<br>  <br>  I think the media should back off and allow privacy for such things like the Chris/Rihanna thing and I think if you mess up  you should face the consequences of it and learn but whatever.<br>  <br>  This is just what I think. Have a good week!|`|UtS6Uesqaa	I think that we absolutely live in a weird world...I do think however, that Chris needs to go to jail or any man that hits on a woman deserves jail time...And by know means am I condoning that women are allowed to hit men because that's not what I am saying at all, I think women should go to jail too.....The fact that Chris Brown hit Rihanna only shows how much of a weak coward of a man he is.....And that's my opinion....|`|mBnmH8bUaa	because rihanna was alive to report it.

And again, can not be compared to O.J. Because he wasn't proven guilty.

IfOTZhQyaa	YOU CAN BE PRESENT AND NOT BE OF ANY SUPPORT. SUPPORT COME FROM THE HEART AND SO YOU NEED NOT BE PRESENT TO GIVE IT. YOU CAN CALL HER OR WRITE OR EVEN TEXT HER. WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS YOUR COMMUNICATION AND THAT'S ALL THAT'S NEEDED. JUST TO KNOW THAT YOUR READY TO LISTEN WHEN SHE NEEDS TO TALK IS WHAT'S IMPORTANT. THE PROVERBIAL SHOULDER TO CRY ON. EVEN IF YOUR NOT THERE.|`|LYDVekF1aa	Keep in touch with her. Give her words of encouragement. Remind her that you are always there for her no matter what time, you'll be there for her.

If they REALLY liked you in the first place, they wouldn't have any reason to " hate " you.<br>  <br>  I was afraid to leave my boyfriend for the same reason, I didn't want to get anyone mad at me.  But you know what, they're not the one hating the relationship are they? No, you are.  So go do yourself a favor and break up with him.<br>  Be honest and straight forward.|`|iyRczu0eaa	Well I can tell you what NOT to do.

xgui1LAFaa	lol my curfew now is 11 on non school night and 10 on school nights, unless i find somewhere to stay overnight. im 16 so i dont think its that bad, because once you reach 16, 17, 18 curfews should be around the same time, because your all doing the same stuff. He wants it to be later so he can drink or get high, to be honest. tell him to stay at a friends house if he wants to party, unless he needs to come home then he is always welcome.|`|SsfnitjXaa	Your main concern should be getting him help or helping him with his studies.  No one goes out on a school night unless it is a school activity he participates.  Weekend (Friday and Saturday night) activities dictate how late he should be out.  Not a time.  Make sure he is running with the right crowd.|`|1235333b4f34f1147fc81bf4aef8885baa	Sounds more than reasonable to me.<br>  <br>  My boys have to be in by nine on school nights, unless they're working.  I want them in bed by ten.  At 18, that's hard to control - but the rule in my house has always been, in your room by 9:30.  They don't have computers in their rooms, so they're usually sleeping before long.<br>  <br>  On the weekends, it's 11:30 unless there's a special occasion like prom or homecoming.  Once again, they're to be in their rooms by midnight.  Don't have to be sleeping, but there isn't a whole lot else to do.<br>  <br>  Kids perform better when they get enough sleep.  It's healthier for them and will help to do better in school and in general social interactions.<br>  <br>  When my kids grades drop below Cs, they're grounded so curfew is no longer a question.|`|DzunYgWOaa	I think that is very fair, i had 5 kids, all grown now and that sounds reasonable, maybe if his grades were better, i might change them.|`|13f8355359652cfde88b26bd8b3d6c6caa	To be honest, if I had bad grades my parents wouldn't let me out at all.|`|1J4OfumGaa	well he is 18 dont you trust him?|`|Tv7uzM9Waa	I'm 18 and have no curfew but I don't go out at all during the school week.<br>  <br>  I don't think your son should have a curfew, but if his grades are that bad, maybe make a deal with him that if he gets them up, you'll get rid of the curfew.|`|AA12060541	10:00 on school nights, no wonder he's getting bad grades, no study time! But considering he's 18 (legal age), your in a tight spot.  But being he still lives under your roof, there are still rules to follow.  You need to set those and hold to them!|`|0Ttr5k41aa	I don't think it's unreasonable at all! I am a 27 yo f who was well behaved in school with all a's and b's and wasn't allowed to go out on school nights and on weekends my curfew was usually 11....tell him i think he's lucky! lol
cHM2US6xaa	Dude I just read some of the answers and dude, seriously dont ask her if you can kiss her. That is sooooo stupid. I would hate that. It kinda kills the moment.<br>  <br>  You will know when the time is right. Just look into her eyes for a couple seconds, then lean in very slowly. If she is not ready she will move away !<br>  <br>  No big deal. <br>  <br>  Then a couple days/weeks later try again. <br>  <br>  Then a couple days/weeks later if she moves away once more then no big deal again. <br>  <br>  Try once more and if she moves away again, TALK to her !<br>  Ask her whats wrong.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|AA11263103	*Wait for the right moment.*<br>  There’s usually no hurry for a kiss, especially a first kiss with someone, so be patient and wait until the mood is right. Some good times are at a romantic movie after or during an on screen kiss, walking in the moonlight, or during a particularly intimate conversation. Wait until the two of you are alone so that the other person will feel more comfortable and so that nobody will see if your attempt to kiss is rejected. Many girls (and guys) don't want to be asked: they prefer that you be confident enough to take a risk and just go for it. One way to do so is to stop whatever you’re doing and silently look into the person’s eyes for a moment or two. Touch their face, then gently pull him/her toward you for a kiss. If the person pulls away or hesitates at any time, he or she is not ready for a kiss. If this happens, tell them that you want to give them a hug and go for that.<br>  <br>  *Approach for the kiss.*<br>  Approach slowly and smoothly. Depending on your starting position you may need only to turn your head, or you may need to lean in a bit. You may want to use your hands to gently urge your partner’s body or head into position—you just want to guide his or her movement a little, you don’t want to forcibly move any part of his or her body or hold your partner in an uncomfortable position—but in general you just want to position yourself correctly and let your partner meet you. As you near your partner’s lips, maintain eye contact. You may want to close your eyes after your lips meet to heighten the sensuality of the kiss (and to avoid staring at the pores on his or her face).<br>  <br>  *Kiss gently.*<br>  There are many kinds of kisses, from quick pecks to sweet, passionate kisses. There’s a time and place for all of these, but your first kiss with someone should be gentle and romantic. Don’t press your mouth onto your partner’s--just let your lips meet--and don’t try to push your tongue into his or her mouth. When your lips meet, pucker them and give a kiss, then smile and pull away a little, keeping your head close to your partner’s. If your partner moves to kiss you back or seems to like it and doesn’t pull away, go in for another kiss, this one a little firmer and longer. Put your hands on their face or around their shoulders.<br>  <br>  *Make the kiss the reason for the kiss.* <br>  Some people seem to treat kisses as nothing more than a prelude to something else, and will try to quickly move into French kissing. Good kissers concentrate on the kiss, and they kiss, at least seemingly, expecting nothing more. Enjoy the experience, and don’t move too fast. Live in the moment. You will not kiss as well if your mind is somewhere else. For example, when kissing, try to avoid thoughts like "What is he/she thinking about?", "Do I look good tonight?", or anything else. Don't be too self-conscious, or have ANY thoughts outside the kiss if you can help it. Instead, concentrate on the way the other person's lips feel against yours.|`|o95szcI0aa	when you two are looking at each other in the eyes when you are close to each other, move your face slowly towards hers and hopefully she will move in too|`|gJNxfoJHaa	its kinda weird to ask her to send a pic to your phone.. its just creepy :))<br>  never tell a girl that you would kiss her. OH TRUST ME i've been there!! :)) if you tell her you are gonna kiss her then it would just ruin the "so-called-moment" during the whole hanging out thing.. she might be actually expecting the "kiss" but it would just be awkward.<br>  <br>  so i'd say.. dont do it yet. wait for another date or something|`|kERP7zAhaa	heres what my boyfriend did. we were sitting next to eachother and he put his arm around me and was like "come here" so i would kinda lean on him. a couple minutes later he took his other hand, brushed my hair off my face and kissed me.|`|5YEKmHqyaa	Just ask her if it's ok to kiss her.|`|16VNS9hsaa	if you had been dating for a long time already and you haven't kissed her, then I guess the problem is with you.. <br>  <br>  go kiss the girl! Take the risk and do it slowly though. you have to find the right gestures. <br>  <br>  If you're trying to go closer, and she gets closer to you in response, then I guess that's one of the right gestures.|`|8VRXoG4Faa	if your really not sure<br>  just be like <br>  lean as if your about too<br>  " I know this probably sounds sorta stupid, but would it be alright if i kissed you"<br>  <br>  and i bet she will say yes.|`|GS4IklLSaa	Tell her, <br>  "I would like to kiss you, if you would let me."<br>  Works like a charm.

YnG0Tjxjaa	A lot of girls just plain don't like body hair on them and they find it repulsive. Also, some find it more hygienic, especially with the monthly gift and all. It's all to taste, really. Almost like a hairstyle. Haha. I'm glad you and your girl agree on your views.|`|W6pT1Wp3aa	great oral sex!! lol Plus, I actually think sex is better when your shaved, I'm not sure why though|`|ec5e2cfdd5364a1a67d973613c5d9480aa	I think it is more for a hygiene thing. Besides, a well trimmed pubic area looks better under panties than a big, dark forest peeking out from the sides of panties. LOL|`|gfHutvEFaa	it may feel better for you but you aren't the only person in the world. everyone is different. Everyone. What one person likes, another one doesn't.|`|kZUN8pjdaa	Because some people don't LIKE those odors you're talking about and some people find it really unsightly to have a vagina or a penis covered in nasty coarse hair.|`|T1l8qYSvaa	Because it looks sexy to have a shaved p**sy|`|4Cedy0Rfaa	so they dont get crabs|`|kg3wV0Czaa	Because it makes us feel cleaner.<br>  I like having my boyfriend go down on me without coming up with a huge clump of hair in his mouth. <br>  Plus, I'm Persian and Greek so I have a lot of hair, which I really HATE having and I know a lot of girls feel the same way.<br>  I understand what you mean when you say it's better natural but that's just how I personally feel about it.<br>  I have no problem with people not shaving, it's their own personal choice!|`|20da7e19a185ca8c01b2a311761afcd6aa	It's not that their afraid. It is just simply how they want their body to look. Everyone has different opinions. Some shave for the pleasure of others, some shame for the pleasure of themselves. Some shave for both.|`|Dwdbv9LLaa	It's personal preference. Some, like you, prefer it. Some don't mind it. Some think body hair in general is unappealing.|`|JLFGfaC3aa	Because since the majority of people shave, it would seem weird to not shave.<br>  It's the way our society is these days.<br>  <br>  And it's cleaner. Sorry, hair is gross.|`|RyYumX0Aaa	It makes you feel more sensitive and cleaner. Even if it's not it makes me feel that way.|`|krru1aNLaa	Looks? Good for oral sex?|`|T5EOJrVZaa	i just dont like hairyness|`|a71d6398b9b54fe96b5da7798ed275f0aa	i shave because its easier to keep tabs on whats going on down there, my boyfriend loves it, and I think alot of women do this because they think thats what men like --and from what I've expeirenced most do!|`|dBqV5ZjQaa	Becuase you don't get hit on when you are in a bikini and hairs are sticking out the sides<br>  <br>  But seriously - I just feel cleaner having it waxed|`|XWUPdFjoaa	i just hate hair its gross to  me and it might make other people self consios if it some hoe comes out and you can see it they may be inbarresed about it|`|OkgApi0Caa	1 word<br>  <br>  <br>  pedophilia|`|qbksapuBaa	well it looks cleaner feels nice and smooth when someone want to head south and plus do you know how many guys dont like a hairy bush? a ton|`|ZyK5fW2yaa	Because I feel cleaner.|`|454ePRMzaa	It just kinda feels gross,<br>  I don't know, I shave it then i stop for periods of time.|`|23Yt0evuaa	It feels better when the guy goes down, and it's cleaner.|`|hhr3A1bSaa	well because the majority of the people do it, that should tell you that most people do it because it is the "thing to do right now". but there is a percentage of poeple that do it for there own reasons. 1. some people arnt into the sexual smells as you are that are created by the pubes(wich isnt a bad thing). 2. big bush of hair...no, i do shave but not completly off, i just so there is pretty much peach fuzz that is soft  to the touch. 3. that **** will get caught in  a zipper if your trying to wear some sexy underwear and it is long enough to get caught. 4. a girl being on her period, when there is hair the Period the stuff i shall not mention, does get al over, and will get in your pubes if you dont wear a tampon 24/7, and pubes keep moister wich can make a girl stank more of period
C0K3Bo2Aaa	Girls are so mean and catty some times. I'd listen to mom.|`|d85c9f54c1789376bcbba63672563679aa	Rumours & gossip doesn't help us solve our problems. It's better to have a real talk with ur bf face to face. U don't hv to believe what he explain to u, but at least let him know u feel awful abt the whole incident. U hope that he will let u know what's going on w/o u asking if such incident happens again. Let him understand that in order for 2 pple to build a better relationship, it will be good to be truthful & communicate.<br>  <br>  It's both couple's responsible to be loyal & truthful to each other, to enable us to love deeply. This way trust will always exist & we'll feel stressless & happier ard each other|`|I6y85ckmaa	Maybe your boyfriends mom is just trying to save the relationship. Bring the girl over when you hang out with your boyfriend next without him knowing and see how he reacts.|`|KCpGsN2faa	Confront your boyfriend, gauge his reaction, and act accordingly.
Zjgmm9t5aa	Actually, no. Its not cheating. There is a thin piece of rubber keeping your private parts from ever really touching.|`|xfk2xMWEaa	it doesnt matter. would you want your boyfriend sleeping with another girl? does using a condom suddenly make it ok? man, girls are soooo shallow these days. where is the common sense|`|nxMi4adjaa	You must not value the emotional side of it if you'll do it with anyone you aren't committed to.<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ah48.hK04QmNf7ATBwPBq9Lsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222181949AAknWhO">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|o4QRCMueaa	hey guys, "Am I able to have a sex change if I lick my elbow." damn your dumb|`|kTZ9im5Taa	yes it is cheating!!  if you dont think it is then you should be able to ask your boyfriend and see what he says. i'm sure he will think that it is cheating.  but if you feel like you need to have sex with another person then i dont think you really want to be with the person your with now!!|`|KCpGsN2faa	Yes, it is cheating. You need to either soldier up and deal with your boyfriend's medical problems that he can't control, or dump him if sex is that important to you. The only idea I can come up with is if you asked your boyfriend if you can sleep with this other guy.|`|I6y85ckmaa	Lmao you're horrible, and stupid IMHO. Condom or not it's still cheating. IDC if he wraps it up in flatbread, it's cheating, end of story. I feel sorry for your boyfriend. Maybe you're just in love with the sex and not your boyfriend. You're a sl*t in my opinion.|`|D3rw1C8faa	If  you were married and your husband was having sex with your best friend, if he used a condom that would mean he wasnt cheating?  COME ON!|`|GtPnXzPAaa	Also keep in mind, eatin' ain't cheatin'|`|FSruw622aa	yes it's cheating|`|hIwJxNVkaa	yes... any kind of intercourse is cheating.. but if u wanted to have sex.. the best condom to use is no condom at all! lol|`|mTqkcTtWaa	yea it is you horny b****!!!! are you stupid of course!|`|61Fwbi79aa	Ask your bf. I'll bet he says yes|`|71VRvldJaa	Using a condom is irrelevant!  It's cheating and there's no other word for it!  I wonder how you would feel if you were the one with the health issues and he decided to have sex?.....with a condom of course!<br>  <br>  Kidney stones are extremely painful but they don't last forever.  Eventually he will pass them, or they will be lasered and then he should be back to normal.<br>  <br>  If you don't love and have enough respect for your boyfriend to stand by him through this time, you shouldn't be with him!  He deserves someone who will be loyal to him and be compassionate and sensitive to his medical problem.
AA10702820	You don't seem to know what you want.<br>  <br>  I've always thought that if you break up with a guy you need to let your heart heal before getting in something new with a new guy. And I've always thought that you shouldn't date an ex UNLESS there has been a change in the person and you truly believe you can make it work again. Most of the time you break up with a person for a certain reason and that reason is still there when you wanna get back together. The first few months may be great but as you get deeper in you realize what tore you two apart in the first place.<br>  <br>  That said, think about your relationship with Tom. Where is it going? If you're not feeling it anymore then don't stay in it still. You'll be wasting his time and yours. Not to mention leading him on. Set yourself free and him too. Think about WHY you wanna get back with Andrew and the reasons that broke you two up last year (very jealous and overprotective). Has Andrew changed or do you think giving things another go would really work out, or is just Andrew's constant i love yous that make you consider it? Guys always say to girls that they love them and can't be without them but look at their actions. I've seen so many girls get hurt because they fall for these guys who say stuff but in the end their actions don't prove their words to be true. I'm not saying that Andrew is lying to you, I don't know him-I'm just saying what I see turn out often.<br>  <br>  After deciding about the current guy in your life and the ex, think about this friend of Tom's. You can't help who you like, but get to know him first. Get to know him as friends because through friendship love grows-whether it be intimate or a strong BFF kind of thing.<br>  <br>  Take some time to think stuff through before making a move. Always try and move forward, not backward because the past is behind you and never think that what once hurt you can make things better. Very few things that were painful prove to be what you need next in life. Allow your heart to heal and yourself to clear everything out and find what would be best for you.<br>  <br>  All the best!!

If you feel something is wrong, then go with your intuition. <br>  I hope this helps.|`|hHndD5SEaa	Ask her for references.<br>  Ask her what experience shes had in babysitting.<br>  Describe an emergency situation and ask her what she would do if such a thing arose.<br>  Describe a behavioural problem that your child could have - maybe having a tantrum - refusing to go to sleep - and ask her what she'd do in that situation<br>  xx|`|fSbSD0B6aa	I'd ask typical background related questions and would definitely call people that this person has sitted for in the past as part of a background check. I'd also recommend that they be given almost like a little quiz in stuff like CPR and how to locate emergency phone numbers. Another quite important thing (although I'd say it's less important than a background check and CPR ability) is that they have fun ideas and activities for your son. I'm not saying that this person should have to do a massive brainstorm session before coming over to babysit, just that he or she knows what kind of things your son might like and is willing to do more than pop in his latest favorite video and then go into the kitchen to start reading or something.
ebcfaff0504724aa2ad756522576c3b2aa	By not looking too hard. People who are desperate attract people who are equally desperate, perhaps desperate for different things. You can't build a foundation on desperation that will help nurture the relationship and a family.<br>  <br>  I would say focus on yourself, don't indulge in self-pity but do start doing things to help you better cope with your life and situation. Focus on making yourself the person you want to be--get in shape physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually and financially. By financially I don't mean that you need to earn lots of money, but learn how to handle money wisely and set a good example. I'm not saying you need to become perfect in any of these areas, just improve, everyone has room for improvement. Write down goals and ways of achieving them. Be patient but steady in achieving them, and forgive yourself when you mess up (which you will) but don't use your failure as an excuse to give up.<br>  <br>  In the journey of doing these things, you will find that your standards will become such that you will have plenty of doors open for you. One thing you should learn and accept from your past failed relationship is that like attracts like, so the better you are, the more comfortable and secure you are, the more honest and healthy you are in all of these areas of life, the more likely you are to attract the same type of mate, whatever your past may be.|`|6QuGMadkaa	Try going to church and taking your children with you every Sunday<br>  and every other chance you can get.

WXwVuctfaa	Nope, a good majority of my friends are girls. I only see them as friends, nothing more :)|`|xgui1LAFaa	no.... but they are more inclined to like a girl friend then someone, lets say, in theyre class.|`|I0rOL46aaa	Nope!<br>  The reason most people think this is because, in books and movies, this is how the romance path is usually paved; girl falls in love with jock guy, jock guy is a jerk, girl breaks up with jock guy, girl turns to best guy friend for comfort, best guy friend admits he loves girl, girl and best guy friend kiss and live happily ever after.<br>  Sometimes guys do have a crush on their girl friends.  Either they were trying to get close to the girl to ask her out but he was stuck as the friend, or he was friends with the girl and found out how much they had in common.  Very rarely does this happen, though, because usually both the guy and the girl know that they are just friends and the things you look for in a friend aren't usually the same things you look for in a boyfriend/girlfriend (example: I don't think 'good kisser' would apply to a best friend of the same gender).<br>  Hope I helped!<br>  -xo Alice|`|RuOTJLyvaa	well like when you get really close to a girl just as a friend the question of intimacy almost always comes up in your head...cause like why not?

But yeah it happpens all the time. Specially to me. I'm a naturally charismatic guy so most of the girls I talk to usually think I'm crushing on them...but I'm probably not.

I am a 6th grader and this 1 girl is very pretty and i like her and i mess with her stuff because whenever she gets mad its very cute to watch that,and when i get something wrong i mummble kinda loud and say im a retard,like the homework stuff she is a really smart girl so i do ask her alot of stuff and she just smiles so yea,i would have to say yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  he DOES like you!!!|`|shPIoenzaa	Yes, go for it! Most popular guys like non-popular girls because the popular girls are always with them and they get really annoying, most popular guys hate them! That's probably why he seems into you if you're not very popular, you're not in his group of friends which makes you seem more interesting and it'd be more fun to get to know someone than date someone you already know, right?|`|MgMsMExPaa	He likes you . Get to know him . Learn what he likes and find some common interests that you can follow together. Maybe he would like some individualized study time with you. He may listen to you better than the teacher.|`|kHSPH0RBaa	I would say yes. But don't rush it, because if he really doesn't like you, you could ruin a good friendship.|`|v85fW4T2aa	Aww....I think he does!!! :D|`|OQqAlHL8aa	yes|`|25DwuEYlaa	he sounds like he is there to pick your brain for answers|`|AA12139118	He likes you..........Be kind and tell him... he is not stupid......after all he likes you doesn't he?|`|gJB3VhcQaa	Well, you can never really tell with guys unless they flirt a lot and its really obvious that they like someone.  You could probably figure out if he has a crush on you by maybe flirting with him a little bit and seeing what he does. Also pay attention to what he does with other girls.  Does he ask a lot of people to help with homework or just you?  If you really like him and he doesn't completely ignore you then go for it.  You've got your whole life ahead of you and if it doesn't work out then move on and forget about him.  *hope this helps, sorry i got a little carried away :P*|`|cI4TFsnjaa	this is a difficult situation because guys tend to send mixed signals. It may mean that he is in to you, or that he is just interested in your homework help. Get to know him a little more, while you have those homework talks, ask him about him self and get a converstation going to see how things go from there. And as for him calling himself stupid, maybe he just has low self esteem and is looking for you to say "oh no you're not" type thing, but who knows. Hope I helped, good luck!|`|a71d6398b9b54fe96b5da7798ed275f0aa	Im 25 years old.

Who will ever figure them out? like i said im 25 and I still can't! good luck down the road on what i call a spiraling path to hell ;)|`|kqw3qclzaa	he most probably does if he always asks you questions about homework and workd with you the whole hour, that means he probably likes being with you. and he calls himself stupid probably because he's nervous.<br>  and playing with your stuff- yeah he probably does like you<br>  so go for it :]|`|bbeda509eb9cbba3de558e38c77b8a8faa	No. Plain and simple. He's just talking to you. Unless he starts trying to get to know you personally, ask for your number, tries to hang out with you out of school, or makes some kind of move on you, he doesn't like you. He just sees you as a friend now.|`|HjispLhMaa	Maybe you should try going for it. He is somewhat flirting with you but giving you mix signals.<br>  Hopefully it will work out for the both of you<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|LdRAsccPaa	well there isnt alot of info to really tell if he likes you maybe he is just a flirt but idk y dont u ask him im a high school student and thats what i do ill just be like yo your flirting with me kid do u like me or something hahah just be straight up|`|qJECm9nFaa	guys dont always go for the popular girls they are stuck on themselves he is just finding a reason to be around you with the homework questions go for it all he can do is say no|`|CkSEpHhzaa	thats a hard one...if he wasn't popular, i could say he totally likes you butttt....popular guys tend to flirt with everyonee.hmmm....wait a while, populars usually just come right out and tell you when they like you|`|QLA4vy94aa	yeah he has a crush on you. he's working with you rather than his friends. <br>  <br>  <br>  Answer mine??<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090222180513AAQurVw">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|tkPBNBhiaa	Not really, if he liked you he would 'flirt' a bit.|`|8FwcGbn1aa	8th grade are you serious?<br>  Just wait|`|IJ4iv4Wsaa	hes probly looking for good friendship rite now.<br>  idk lol|`|4BYVBWP6aa	i think he might like you because i call myself stupid when i am nervous|`|zWX5GDehaa	yes go for it

Yea right, he figures he has hit the bank. He can have one girlfriend and then have another girl on the side that is okay with the other girlfriend. Never settle. Let yourself be treated how you want to be treated. If you let yourself be the other woman, he will be perfectly happy making you the other woman.<br>  <br>  Tell him you can't be that girl. Tell him the time you've had together is amazing, but you're not one to sit around waiting on him to figure out what he wants.<br>  <br>  Besides, if he did ever leave her and ask you out, what's to stop him from dating another girl behind your back? If he did it to her he'd do it to you.|`|AA10744471	What's wrong with you? Of course, it is a bad relationship. The guy is two-timing you and his girlfriend! What kind of guy is he? You believe him? He sucks.... Move on.|`|5YEKmHqyaa	Move on girl..."trying" to break up with her isn't the same as actually breaking up with her.  He wants both obviously.  Just b'cuz of what other ppl think of her obviously he doesn't feel the same b'cuz he's still with her.  Also they've been going out for a long time and he's kept it a secret from her.  Who's to say he won't do the same thing to you.<br>  <br>  Be careful, but honestly I think you should give him up.  He's having his cake and eating it too.  It's not fair to either of you.|`|AA10870613	there is no *trying* . He either breaks up or he doesnt, right now, he has his cake and eating it to and you are allowing it. You deserve to have a normal relationship, if it was me, it would be a ultimatum, me or her....... and if he says he cant break up with her, i would tell him to be gone. If he truly loves you, there would be no problem in ending with her.|`|8FbOtXAXaa	What in the world are you doing with a guy who is already in a relationship with another woman?

1235333b4f34f1147fc81bf4aef8885baa	It will hurt your parents feelings if you ask them to come over less frequently.  I would try to be more subtle before I came right out with that particular comment.<br>  <br>  Maybe mention casually that you're going to start a family home evening.  Pick a day and make a big deal out of how Tuesday or whatever is going to be just mom (and dad?) and the kids.<br>  <br>  Perhaps suggest that the grandparents pick up a hobby or special activity of their own.  Find something they're interested in give them a little loving push.<br>  <br>  You're not being selfish exactly for wanting time alone with your kids.  But, it should be remembered that only a few generations ago, it was the norm for grandparents to live with their children and help to raise their grandchildren.  If a few hours every day seems stressful, imagine living that way!  But, truthfully, I think people were happier back then.  There's no better environment to raise children in than one that's filled with love.|`|KwNpyp3saa	You should talk to them. Let them know that you love then but need some alone time with your kids.

If you love him stick it out. chances are he will remain in the US for a majority of the two years if not all of it. At least we hope right.

I can assure of a few things – 1) You and he will change.  As you’ve stated yourself, you both are very young. The first few years out of high school can be the most exciting and exhilarating times for you both.  I don’t recommend making “promises to wait” for one another.  But I do highly recommend that you both be extremely honest with the other.  I’m not saying “break it off,”  just keep an open mind and heart to where your lives are leading you.  2) He will need your support while in boot camp.  Those weeks can be he//, and it helps to no end to know you have supportive friends and family back home.  Even if you do not stay together, at the very least be there for him (e.g. through mail and the allotted phone calls).  When you talk, tell him you miss him (if it’s truly the case) – but don’t dwell on the loneliness, separation, or any other such negativity.  It would be much more beneficial to yours and his emotional health to focus on what you will do when you get to see one another again (e.g. make plans, laugh about memories, etc).  3) If you do not stay together, you’ve invested 2.5 yrs to one another, so you should at least remain friends.  You can never have too many.  4) I don’t know if the issue of marriage has been brought up, but if it has, be very mindful of what a “military spouse’s life” involves.  It would not be fair to you or him if you go into this blind.  5) And most importantly Love over comes all.  With love and open communication, the two of you can overcome any obstacle and be brought closer together for it.  I wish you both the best of luck in whatever you decide to do.  Please thank him for me for serving our country.  Best wishes!

16VNS9hsaa	you just have to show Jane how much of a better guy you are than Jack. <br>  <br>  Okay, so Jane is in love with Jack and that's hard, but maybe, it's because Jack is such a romantic guy for Jane, and we all know how much of a sucker girls are for romantic speech. You can't just change that. <br>  <br>  You have to be more romantic I guess. <br>  <br>  just be with her all the time and whenever she has problems, listen. <br>  <br>  Or probably the best thing is that you have to tell her exactly what you feel about her and Jack. maybe she'll realize what she's been missing.|`|aMHIA7XMaa	"Jane" will come to her senses sooner or later. Be there for her  and be supportive.<br>  <br>  Until then, leave things alone. Don't be "that guy" - don't try to come between her and her boyfriend, even if he is a jerk. Trying to break them up so you can swoop in and snag "the goods" makes you a jerk too.|`|RyYumX0Aaa	All you can do is talk to her, explain how you feel about her and what you can offer them in a relationship. Make her see how much better things could be.<br>  <br>  However the final decision is hers, all you can do is make her a heat filled offer.<br>  If she turns you down you do have to let he be with him, this added pressure is not good for her.|`|20da7e19a185ca8c01b2a311761afcd6aa	Dont interfere with anyones relationship. Let HER make the decision. Seriously.|`|74tr4nYeaa	find another girl !!!|`|GS4IklLSaa	First of all, Jane is a human being.<br>  One does not "get" a human being.<br>  Grow up, you stupid little boy.|`|8gCJVFG3aa	You Cant Just 'Get' Her.<br>  Wait For Her To Make Up Her Own Decision. <br>  Its Up To Her.<br>  You Shoudnt Influence Her In Any Way.<br>  Stay Close Friends and Be There For Her But DONT Make A Moove on Her As Shees Taken At The Moment.|`|tkPBNBhiaa	Impossible, unless she breaks up with him.|`|qrjqYAHtaa	Just be there for her. She can't be stupid. They'll fall apart soon enough if he's a jerk.

If you love her like you say you do you should have been able to talk to her bout it instead of breaking her heart.|`|cA3U6GFgaa	Well i think at this point you should be honest with her. What you did was wrong but it everyone deserves a second chance. So speak to her and let her know how you really feel.

It's more peninsula than South Bay, but it's beautiful and easy to find even for people who haven't been there.  It's 101, Ralston exit, and then it's right there.  Perfect!|`|hsZnjZvoaa	It's a little bit inland, but have you looked into some of the casinos/reception halls in the Riverside/Temecula area?<br>  <br>  Are you looking for an all-in-one or separate locations?  Some of the hotels in Laguna Beach have beautiful balconies (small weddings), and there's a city park that overlooks the beach... i don't know if you could do a reception there, but depending on how many people you're planning on there are a lot of options... here's the park <a href="http://radified.com/crescent_bay/laguna_beach/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://radified.com/crescent_bay/laguna_...</a>|`|KZV8p4PGaa	I am terrible with what is south bay(you would think I could just look at a map), but I am going to throw this idea out anyways.

Xanax is used to treat mood disorders and bi-polar symptoms. Tyson was on it when he bit that guys ear off in the ring. <br>  <br>  You need to decide if you can deal with this or if you need to move on. Have you talked to her about it?|`|d057d4b205afdf38f32252a846ee418baa	yes it does|`|YUjVFkocaa	I don't know, but I DO KNOW THIS.....<br>  <br>  I used to go out with a girl who had those mood fluctuations- and it wasnt PMS, OR xanax.... it was just her.  <br>  <br>  So the xanax doesnt have to be the reason to cause it......<br>  <br>  and i do know this.....<br>  <br>  if she starts breaking up with you, OR you break up with her... she ISNT going to want to get back with you. thats about all i can tell you|`|qy07K2k5aa	I don't think that her medication can cause mood swings.
POJNnWhDaa	Is she single or married? If she's single and she comes onto you so there's no doubt what she wants, I might think about it. Just whatever you do, DON'T get her pregnant! Just weigh your friendship vs sticking it in her, cause it's one or the other, not both. Go with whichever is more important to you.<br>  <br>  Come to think of it, you are both adults, so if she wants to and you want to then I'd do it. Then after you've taken a shower together to wash all the..  stuff... off, you can figure out how to tell your friend.|`|nZpSM7ngaa	stacys mom shes got it goin on....|`|VrR9ojRRaa	umm..hello, she is a person too.<br>  <br>  i'd go for it n tap that.<br>  <br>  I actually read a question before about a lady that has a crush on one of her kids friends.

XI3blPQtaa	1. get over ur spoilt self<br>  2. tell your parents to f*ck off|`|zIjZhlysaa	I think you probably have no choice but to tough it out for one more day. But probably the best way to ensure that you never end up there again is to make a deal with your parents. Usually its best to start off by admitting that your wrong, whether its true or not, because it makes a more even ground to start with. Maybe something along the lines of:<br>  <br>  "Mom, Dad, I know I have been acting really irresponsible when it comes to this class. And I really want to improve. But I really don't think that this clinic is going to help me at all."<br>  <br>  And then compromise on your part<br>  "If I work really hard, talk to my teacher and do things on my own terms and my grade for the class goes up, must I go to the clinic again?"<br>  Or try suggesting that you get a tutor that can help you out with your math. <br>  <br>  Of course that means actually doing the work on your part. And you have to see your teacher to get help for what you don't get, do your homework, study, etc. The clinic is one thing but failing math for the whole year will be much, much worse! Good luck.|`|VygBNA0Waa	start by listening to your parents and thank god they care about you and start tring more at school and be a good kid
5810e6ffd53a5af2e1a161b4d5ccf2e3aa	I lost my 17year old daughter to a tragic single vehicle accident in August 2007. Even though the pain is still very great. I had to have the determination, commitment, and courage to help my other daughters get through the pain of losing their sister.
AA11814313	If I read this correctly he was already separated when you met him but everybody is getting the wrong idea?<br>  <br>  Divorce is hard and he's also lost his job so he's probably stressed upset mad etc....the gym is probably a way for him to let off steam and he needs to look for work so unless you are going to hang in limbo for a bit and be his support person you should walk he seems like he has soo much on atm.  You on the other hand need to know that at anytime anybody can leave you and you will be fine ok even great on your own.|`|R3DxlK0xaa	Wait you want a positive answer to you being a mistress?<br>  No,  I think what you want is for people to lie to you and tell you to hang on to this cheating bastard.. What you need are MORALS look it up. They really simplify you life.|`|UzGGflRfaa	um not to sound mean but...uh rebound relationships dont work........let him be and let him come to you and YOU do YOU until then..........and who knows maybe u will meet someone else.......but I wouldnt push myself on him.....|`|th7C1aoaaa	I agree with the first answer.|`|aSE7sihFaa	I was going through this same situation and feel like I made a mistake by ending it too early. I broke stuff off with him after about 2 and a half months of dating and now things have really gotten messed up with us. My only suggestion given from what I have learned from my mistakes and dating a guy in the process of a divorce is to be patient and just let things ride out. There is no way to make him want to commit or make things work out or to go any faster. My best advice is to be as patient and supportive as possible if he is what you really want. While there are no guarantees that he will be with you in the future you need to be willing to take this chance if you want the possibility of this working.|`|Ikd9cppcaa	The fact is you were uch more appealing to him while he was still married. Now that he is getting a divorce, he knows you are going to want him to commit to your relationship. He doesn't want that because he much prefers a girlfriend to a wife. You need to talk with him and listen to what he has to say.|`|FtyLwqR5aa	First off that's what happens when a lady dates a married man. They get the shaft. You should of encouraged him to fix his marriage instead of helping him hurt it more. That shows your character. He might have just been using you and bow that it is all most over he don't need you. Face the music and find a man of your own.|`|G50ucmllaa	Stop dating married men...you get what you deserve...karma baby.|`|CWgJ7Yyxaa	Divorce is a horrible thing; and some people take longer than others to bounce back or recover from it. Everybody is different.<br>  <br>  I'd strongly suggest you to consider going to counseling or therapy. Or find out if your church has a support group you could attend. <br>  <br>  Sounds to me like this man is not ready for another relationship yet. He has a lot of issues---and if you care for him, you should understand that he cannot give you what you wish right now. He is too troubled and he cannot deal with so many things at the same time.<br>  <br>  Maybe he cares for you a lot; but he finds it hard to make you understand he feels overwhelmed right now. (Men think differently than we do. They need to feel strong and in control; if they don't, they feel terrible and they tend to "crawl into a cave and lick their wounds".)<br>  <br>  Or....Perhaps he knows you care for him as well, and he feels bad that he cannot give you what he thinks you deserve.<br>  <br>   Or maybe he feels he is not good enough for you. <br>  The possibilities are endless.....You cannot read his mind.<br>  <br>  I guess what I want to say is this.....Talk to him, see what he says, and evaluate things so you can make a decision. Set a time limit, too. For example, by this time next year ........... (You fill in the blank: What do you want? Where do you want to be with him?)<br>  <br>  Good luck. If you really think he is worth it, then be patient and give him the space he needs. But be aware that you are taking a chance...and that he may end up telling you it's over later on. <br>  <br>  Good luck...!|`|dFHsAXDMaa	Okay well lets see the American economy sucks right now he is probably feeling like a no good looser for being jobless and about to be divorced while dating a women he actually loves and can almost fully really commit too.... but now he has no job or way to support you financially and his male ego is breaking down..... talk to him tell him you love him no matter what and loving someone is all about getting through the hard times together.... he is not used to someone wanting to be there through the hard times right? his wife did walk away after all..... make sure he knows you have no intentions of going anywhere and that you love him whole heartedly no matter what life brings your way! Good Luck|`|tvK1xjzkaa	Well for starters even if he was been going through a divorce for a while he is still ending something in his life with meaning. You need to give him his space during this time and let him come to you. I would protect your self first and foremost. He has been married for years he may want to run wild for a while who knows. Just sit back and wait if he means that much to you. Don't press him right now for anything. Let him deal with all the emotions of his divorce before he deals with feelings for you.
d5fQPiN6aa	Go to the movies with her, go shopping, get manis and pedis. Do girl stuff. Remind her how much fun it was with no guys in your life. If that doesn't work, have some other friends help you set her up on a blind date. If THAT doesn't work, the TALK TO HER. Tell her everything you just said. Tell her how hard it is for you to see your BEST FRIEND like this.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!!!|`|IsZ8qFRNaa	try to get her involved in more activities like sports and clubs<br>  <br>  encourage her to friends a new crush <br>  <br>  and encourage her to get involved in her community to get her mind off this guy
Whd6tqLzaa	Explain it to your school counselor so that you can get additional time to catch up on your missing work. If you can't get extra time, then let your family know. I am sure they will understand.|`|ZFbj0jTcaa	You can do two things. First go to your teacher and tell her just what you put on here. I'm sure she or he can help you if there understanding teachers. If there not, the go above there heads and go to your school counselor. The for sure can help you not to get far behind. As for your grand mother, If you were close to her, then go. Something like that can stay with you for years on end even after school not being about to say good bye for now. Think about it.
KSK22vHUaa	They probably already know.  If they pay any attention to you, they do.  They won't be shocked.  Just tell them, if you want to, or just bring a boyfriend home one day.  <br>  <br>  With my brothers (I have two gay brothers) we all just knew.  It was fairly obvious, knowing them so well.

zdu3gh8jaa	Hi there *waves & :-)*<br>  <br>  You certainly sound like you could do with some support. It must be very difficult for you at the moment. You don't mention your mum at all, so I take it she isn't around. Do you not have another relative, auntie, grandmother or even a friends mum that you can talk things through with? I know many of my son's friends would come and chat to me with their issues and problems or concerns, if they felt that they couldn't talk to anyone else. If you want to just talk and ramble on then please feel free to do so, I'm sure there will be many of us here that will listen and not be judgemental in any way - just let it all out my dear it will probably do you some good. It sounds like your sister will now get the support she needs which is good, perhaps your dad could do with some support too. Do you know of anyone that he could talk to about his concerns? Although we have no idea how old you are, you sound like a really caring young lady who just needs a listening ear, a smile and a big hug. Please keep writing and let us offer you the cyber ear and shoulder to lean on. <br>  Here's the hug  (((((HUGS))))) and another warm smile :-)  from a mum of 3.

And she needs to do it too. <br>  But don't let her psychologist give her pills as the answer to her problems, she NEEDS to talk to somebody about her problems, and if you can, show her that in her life she's going to make mistakes, but she'll learn things out of it.

KSK22vHUaa	I feel for you.  I'm a larger girl myself.<br>  <br>  I got used to my boyfriend thinking I'm pretty.  I realized he's never dated anyone short or tiny.  Something he said to me really helped me put things into focus:  "If I like you in your clothes, I'll like you out of your clothes."<br>  <br>  I started slowly just putting myself slightly beyond my comfort zone.  Like at first, I had to sleep in full on pajamas.  Then it got to where I could go without the pants and just have a shirt and underwear.  Then I could deal with him seeing my chest and stomach.  I also slowly got more used to him seeing me in the bath tub instead of forcing him out of the room while I wasn't wrapped in a towel.<br>  <br>  Just put yourself slightly outside of what you're comfortable with, and keep in mind that if he loves you in your clothes, he won't care what's underneath your clothes.  <br>  <br>  It gets easier, I promise.

mcUSz16kaa	Sorry to say this, but you probablay can't stop the ex-husbands drama plain and simple. Put yourself in his shoes. This is her ex-husband that she had her children with, and she was married to. He will never go away when it comes to his kids.  You should let your g/f handle her ex and have her be the one to put his constant calling, texting etc. to an end, and you stay out of it. You may think it's stupid and meaningless of what he is doing, but obviously something is going on for him to continue to behave the way he is feeling. (he seems emotionally attached to her). For what ever reason (s) it might be, don't take the risk of losing your g/f by interfering with what they both had in the past together (marriage & kids). Communicate with your g/f as to why he is behaving the way he is. Perhaps he isn't over her, and worse, she isn't over him for him to continue with his behavior.  Could it also be possible that you and he are both jealous of each other as well? It's time to find out where you stand in this relationship. You may also want to really re-think of your future goals of marriage and kids. Also, think about what you are getting yourself into with a possible jealous ex-husband lerking around the corner.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	LOL.. you don't..she is apart of the package if they have kids together.<br>  <br>  It won't stop either.

In a case like this , you really have no say so.  But what can happen is that she can stop him from calling, coming around , and anything else he may be doing to disrupt your relationship with her.  Only she can do this.   It's on her to not allow anyone to come between you and her.  It's up to her to make sure that whatever relationship  she has with him, she has to include you .  To keep things on the up and up and to show respect to you and your relationship .   You may want to really sit down with her and have a long one on one talk  with her about  priorities , being loyal in your relationship , respect for one another and commitment . Also you may  want to talk about whether or not she still loves him.  That might be an issues she's holding on to.  Some of these things may not be easy to talk about but in a relationship, everything should be placed on the table so that there aren't any surprises later.  If you find that there is hiden feelings still lingering on.. then you may want to re-think that relationship before going on any further.  it may just save you from any further pain that awaits you.|`|jBigEy0Caa	Good luck with that one.

707gOCvbaa	Is there anyone who can vouch that she owes you this money? Friends are the worse when it comes to paying money back. Unless it's written down or witnesses she will probably keep ignoring you until you give up or when she's ready. I would go with the first. It's really sad that our own friends can treat us this way but karma does come back and whether she pay you not, She will end up paying for this. good luck.|`|e2cf497fb8528f8c556d43e9580066c5aa	Of course you should get that money back. Honestly, money is something that should be handled with just yourself and like family only (mom&dad). If youre dealing with $20 wtvr, but it sounds like you lent her a lot. I would straight up get to the point with her. I would say "It's been such a long time and I actually need that money so I would appreciate it if you can pay me back in the fastest time possible even if you pay me back a little bit at a time."|`|pkAXMWSdaa	You could just approach her and say, "Hey, I'm really in tight spot with money right now, and I really need you to pay back the money I loaned you.

I'm sure she'll understand where you're coming from, though she may be embarassed about it. Stating that you don't mind doing it shows her that you do care about her and you understand where she's coming from, hopefully eliminating some of the awkwardness. The best of luck to you :D|`|AJ0StZrgaa	Approach her. Tell her of your predicament. Explain to her that you need the money and that it can't be delayed anymore. <br>  No matter how you say it, it's not going to be the most pleasant experience so you may as well get it straight out. If she can't give you the money or tries to make excuses, then I'm afraid it just might have been the last time she got a loan from you. <br>  <br>  I would suggest for future references not to loan too large a sum to anyone again, whether it be a stranger off the street or a dear friend.

We talked about it seriously, and waited until we had insurance and the money to support ourselves. Marriage has its ups and downs, especially for young couples. There's a lot to learn when you take that leap, but we're supportive of each other, he's always been there to listen to me. He gives up time with the guys if I'm having a bad day to be with me. He loves me and all of my flaws and we  communicate well. We make time for each other ( I'm a nurse, he's a firefighter.) And we talk.

Even though they may not do it 10 times in a row, there is always the chance that the next one they will. <br>  <br>  Some are just crying out for help and they need to be guided to a counselor or even a hospital.

Far better then they get angry at you for caring too much then them dead because you thought they were kidding.<br>  <br>  edit... if it's any help mine read 'if god won't kill me maybe I should'... and it's scary **** to go through that.  AT LEAST call them one more time.  Just even knowing that someone gives a damn if they live or die might be enough to make them hesitate if they were considering it.|`|r8rykCkGaa	Pray for guidance!  Wisdom and guidance.  And pray for her.  Tell her Jesus loves her and has a good plan for her life and she needs to get right with God and he will give her a life.  If she is willing to listen, tell her to read John.  Is she lonely, on drugs or what?  She needs counseling, tell her that too, and to talk to a Pentecostal pastor.  That's the safest thing, but they are the ones who care and God answers their prayers and they have godly advice.|`|Op81lhjuaa	Show her how much you really care for her. Tell here what the gospel is.

You're legally an adult... you live with your husband not your father. Your father needs to accept the fact that you're ready to go out on your own... you paid $1,000 on the car... and he has his own vehicle i'm assuming so he has no use for your car... it should be in your name. What you spend your money on is really none of his business anymore... its between you and your husband. The only time he should be asking questions about money is if you're asking him for it or taking out a loan or something of that sort. Tell your dad you're trying to become financially independent... tell him its time to step out of the way. Don't fill out the sheets anymore... and if he asks where and how you spend your money.. tell him its between you and your husband. Ask him how he would feel if his father were doing that to him. Be strong and good luck =)|`|bBBcbFmWaa	It isn't normal. What is your dad giving you the money and wants to know where it is going? Get a seperate bank account. You are out of luck with the car since it is in his name, but you should keep your money.

It's time for you to grow up and make your own way.  I know that you don't have problem understanding that, but it's time your parents started to understand it too.<br>  <br>  You really need to start by putting back money so that you can buy your own car.  Even if you don't actually buy a car with it, you need to be able to do so.  When you're ready, tell dad that you and your husband have been talking about things and you really feel it's time to sink or swim.<br>  <br>  While it's all right for dad to send you a spreadsheet budget, there's no reason that he should be looking to see what you put in it.  Express appreciation for the things they've done for you, but explain that you know it's time for you to start doing these things on your own.  This is what growing up is all about.  You know they did a good job raising you, so you know you're ready.<br>  <br>  If dad reacts badly and threatens to take the car, say: "All right, dad, I'm not happy about that since it's not what we originally agreed to, but I'm capable of providing for myself.  So if that's what you want to do, I've been putting back some money and I'm ready to buy my own car."<br>  <br>  For a parent to be so closely involved in the finances of a MARRIED adult child is a recipe for marital discord.  It's just not healthy.  Good for you for understanding this before it becomes a major problem.|`|KSK22vHUaa	Please tell me you never fill out that stupid spread sheet he sends you.  That's insane.<br>  <br>  He still treats you like a child because he think you are.  He doesn't take your marriage and your independence seriously.  He won't for a while.  <br>  <br>  Stop telling him about your money.  Ask for the title, or get a new car.  All you have to do if he asks is say "I don't want to discuss that with you, but thanks for your concern."  Don't be snide, but do be firm.  <br>  <br>  Obviously he isn't willing to butt out, so you have to kick him out.<br>  <br>  You've shown him that you can take care of yourself and handle your own money and he hasn't listened.  So stop trying to show him and just tell him to quit.  <br>  <br>  For the record, it's fairly abnormal.  My dad just kind of threw me to the wind where money was concerned.  As long as I didn't ask him for money, he never cared how much I had or anything like that.|`|WEyGahYgaa	Wow! That is a difficult position to be in, and no, it's not normal for parents to micromanage your money when you are already out of the house and married. <br>  <br>  First, there is the issue about the car. If you really want to be less indebted to your Dad, I suggest you return the car, and get one of your own. Yes, this will be a difficult move but it will sever at least one financial bind from your Dad. <br>  <br>  You might also want to seriously consider returning or refusing any financial aid they offer from now on. Again, we all appreciate a little extra cash at hand, but if you want to show your parents that you can balance your debits and credits on your own, then this is one way of making a quiet stand. In case you folks still make regular deposits to your bank account, try to open a separate account of your own (and keep this number away from your folks.) This way, you can slowly build up your own resources without touching the ones that they have given you. You can keep that "parent" account open for emergency situations only. <br>  <br>  As for the insistent asking about whether or not you have paid your bills, I suggest you let that one go. Your parents will always ask about that, even when you have shown them you are already financially stable. I bet your parents will continue to do so even if you are already 50 years old and have grandchildren of your own. Haha. <br>  <br>  It's one of the weird parent ways of showing that they care.

IT WAS WORTH IT|`|GFEWLxeiaa	Since he's so adamant about not changing his work shift, even to the point where he would actually contemplate divorce rather than change, quite possibly he's cheating with someone who's on the night shift with him.  Doesn't sound like you'd be losing much if you did decide to divorce.  You don't really have a partner the way things are.  It wouldn't be much different if you divorced.  Either way, you're alone and don't want to be.  At least divorced you'd be free to find someone else who did want to spend time with you.|`|sw6FLjlPaa	If there is "love", working night shift or not is not a problem at all. Its Just an excuse.  Judge for yourself. If he does not respect you / your feeling, then it means you are not important to him. <br>  Has he giving you enought money to spend ? Or more (by working night shift) ? If he giving more, then, maybe he still care for you (he might thought you would be happy with more money). <br>  You need to talk to him.<br>  If he is not giving you enough money..  no money, no time spent, no respect.. what else are you waiting for ??<br>  <br>  Take action.|`|P6SpWWHraa	I'm sorry to hear about this. Did u guys talk about this issue before you're married? My husband used to work in the night shift and I made it clear to him that I was not going to marry him unless he changed his shift. He did and we got married.<br>  Some times u have to lay some ground rules. Compromise on those you can. But if you cannot, like in your case, I'm afraid you have to give him an ultimatum. He's clearly unwilling to provide you what you need in a relationship, just like some wives denying sex. If he's willing to save the marriage, make him give you a definite time line (but don't make him do it right away. Let him have preparation time).<br>  however if there is financial constrain with this move, are you able to quit your job (so that u guys can spend the day together)? Or make weekends meaningful, by spending quality time. This is tough, but workable.|`|PQTnhFeVaa	I have been in your same situation.  Believe me when I say, you already know what the problem is you are just in denial.  He has a girlfriend at work on the night shift.  I am sure if you start checking his cell phone messages etc then you will find out this is the case.  I did my own investigation and found out the same. Be sure you have all the facts before you accuse him and dont let him know you are up to this until that time.  If you arent going to leave or do anything about it if you find out, then dont waste your time.  I left and was ever so happy to find people who wanted to be with me as much as I wanted to be with them.  It is not your fault but you are the only one who can help yourself.|`|W49o6AgGaa	There may be more to the situation than you are aware of.  If he doesn't enjoy spending time with you, that's a real problem.  Try inviting him to accompany you on an activity that you both enjoy, and talk to him.  Be honest.  Having been in this situation myself, I noticed a similar change in my wife.  She was withdrawn from me and didn't want to be around me anymore.  We worked opposite schedules, and it wasn't long before I found out there was someone else.  That may not be the case with your husband, but I guarantee you there's a reason that he's withdrawing his attention from you and won't change his work schedule.  You have to find out what that reason is and deal with it, for better or worse.

1HTRWrawaa	Answer: Many! I know what I want in a friend or in a serious relationship. Why should I waste time trying to be friends with someone who is nothing like me and I have nothing in common with? <br>  <br>  I don't judge a person's right to look the way they want and live their life the way they want to, but I shouldn't have to feel guilty because I don't want to be friends with someone different then me.<br>  <br>  If you don't want people to judge you as a person because of the way you look or how you talk, then do something about your appearance or the way you talk. Don't blame them, blame yourself. First impressions are important. Do you think if you go to a job interview with blue hair, tattoos all over your body and piercings all over your face and talking slang that you are going to get hired? Ya maybe if it's a clothing store that caters to people who look just like you. But not as a lawyer or a secretary, nurse, police officer, and a whole lot more job positions. <br>  <br>  Present yourself to the public the way you want people to see you and if they get the wrong impression, don't blame them, you are the one who screwed up when showing people who you really are. <br>  <br>  Weird colored hair, tattoos, piercings, etc....People do this to themselves to be different, shock people and get attention. Then you complain because these people get negative attention!!!

Generally I give people a pass since I don't have the preconcieved notions you're mentioning.  Maybe it's the area I live in, maybe not.  Now you'll get me thinking about it.  It really doesn't matter though...one thing I know from years of sales is that you never judge a book by its cover since everybodys money is green and some people you think look like assholes are actually really cool folk.

There are more important things in life to think about.|`|2P2K0rl2aa	I have done it many many times.  I keep quiet about my perceptions - my thoughts are my very own and I can think what I want.<br>  <br>  Nevertheless, I am always delighted if somebody proves my perceptions wrong.|`|CWVBfaPwaa	I think everyone stereotypes to an extent.|`|8j7zj9aKaa	Stereotypes exist for a valid reason.<br>  They are meant to describe the average behavior of the group.<br>  They are the overall, statistical average based on observations.<br>  <br>  As statistics - they can apply well, or apply terribly to any one person from the group.  As statistics they are a very fitting description for the overall behavior of the group.<br>  <br>  The human brain can't not stereotype.  Asking it not to is asking it to self-stupefy.  It is hard-wired to work like that.<br>  What it can do - where the "remedy" lives - is not in telling the brain not to work but in giving it good data.  Telling it that "to sterotype is wrong" or "all stereotypes are invalid" is an exercise in futility that the bright people have spent over a century practicing.  Giving good, verifiable, validatable data - that is a great way to adjust the stereotypes - and responses to them.|`|e44113cd9f21585ce32b6f910959288daa	Our basic being warns us about things that we see.  That is why your perception is taken so serious.  If you were a vicious animal in the jungle then that would be the perception that would be recieved of you so that the person can stay safe.  It is what it is.|`|aeLyiRczaa	I do agree with you in large measure.  Yes, we do often do ourselves and others a disservice by acting as you said.  That is how it is and we all need to keep that in mind and work to do better.  But, I also ask you to consider what follows.<br>  <br>  While no one wants to admit it, it is because in large part, stereotypes have a factual basis to them.  Again, no one wishes to admit this is the case, but it does not change the facts.<br>  <br>  And honestly, we are to judge people a bit.  Everyone says we are not to do so, yet they leave half of the quote out.  Now, we are told to judge people based upon how they act, what they do, etc., if for no other reason then to protect ourselves from what that person may bring into our lives.  This would include how they talk, what they wear and other things.  If I see a woman wearing revealing clothing, she has no modesty and a lower moral standard then I like.  She is tempting others, which is wrong.  We are not to purposely do things which cause others to stumble.  No argument will change what I just said.  For it cannot be argued logically.  People may not like it, but that is emotion, not logic.<br>  <br>  So many of the people who will scream that they are not being treated fairly, are not willing to admit when the stereotype about them is accurate and has good justification.<br>  <br>  That is the best answer I can give you.  Yes, you can meet someone who looks like a bum who in all actuality is the wisest and nicest person around.  But then, if they are that, they understand that often, they are not seen that way because of how they look and dress.  One does have to accept that they cause some of what they get at times.  If you walk around and carry a ruler, hammer and chalk line on a tool belt, it is fair to assume that you are a carpenter.  So you have to realize that much of what you do is leading people to see and think of you in certain ways.|`|FtyLwqR5aa	It's the mentality level that the person has that is doing the judging.|`|m81dfyOYaa	Many years ago I took the train from Geneva, Switzerland to Paris with a friend. In the coach with us was a black girl with corn rows and  scars on her face.  My immediate reaction was to completely shut down and ignore her because she looked tough. It turned out she was a delightful young woman, spoke 4 languages, her father was at the United Nations in Geneva and since she was fluent in French got us on the metro to our hotel room in Paris. I'm glad she was friendly otherwise I would have missed an opportunity to meet someone very worthwhile.|`|RtkB46peaa	If everyone of every class and situation wants to be treated differently, how else are we supposed to figure out how to treat them?

It is located on my upper right arm and signifies 'self deception'. The only time I was ever in jail was when I worked there. These perceptions that you describe, and to a degree I can understand that people do this, it's more about role conformity and a nasty thing called altercasting. Of that, most of us are guilty. You, as a woman, should know exactly what I mean... is an example of altercasting.<br>  <br>  In short, we cast people into roles that we can then categorize them, as per your examples. We learn this in school, at a very early age and it is ingrained in us, unfortunately.<br>  <br>  Perception can be deceiving.<br>  <br>  Not all blonds are dumb. In fact, very few are.<br>  All politicians are liars. Again, not true.<br>  <br>  These and many other stereotypes color our perceptions, thus my tattoo, that signifies self deception. Critical thinking of these stereotypes is important to overcome so many 'prejudices' in this world. In my estimation, critical thinking and assertiveness should be taught in schools, age appropriate of course.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Every single solitary human forms an immediate perception of others.  It is influenced by our world-view and our societal norms and mores.  <br>  <br>  Where I disagree with you is that this automatically affects our treatment of others.  We are not victims of our eyes and instincts, we possess minds, free will and conscious choice.  We can and most of us do use these to treat people the way we do.  I try to treat people the way I wish to be treated, even if I have to over-look my initial perception to do so.  In fact, I am quite adept at this, as a criminal defense attorney.
qYfONLnIaa	Hello sounds like you and your wife are not on the same page when it comes to the frequency of having sex. Many things can attribute to this such as stress, children, not feeling desirable extreme fatigue, etc. I am very similar to your wife once I have sex I don't want to have it again for another week or more. My husband would like to have sex but I just didn't feel like it. Well we talked about it and when we shared our feelings we decided that we would meet each other half way. It was unfair of me to decide when to have sex based on how I felt only that is selfish. And he didn't want me to feel like he was putting too much pressure on me. Well once we decided we were going to have se more I began to desire it more. So I guess my advice is to talk to your wife and find out why she doesn't want to do it that often and if there is anything that you can do to help her get in the mood. If there is no physical or emotional problem, then you guys should be able to compromise. Another tip is that for many wives love-making starts before the bbedroom Does your wife like flowers? Poetry? Could she use a little help around the house? When was the last time the two of you had fun with each other? Incorporate some romance....|`|kN4EaiUDaa	never force your wife to have sex thats considered rape, even if your married. i think you should tell your wife that you would like to have sex more often and hopefully you guys can come to a compromise. men shouldnt have to sit back and wait for a wife to make a mood, men and woman both have needs and they both need to be in charge of when its time for sex. my husband i use to have sex daily sometimes everyother day but that was because i wanted it as bad as he did but now that i'm pregnant we only have sex 1 a week. but my husband told me if i could and i felt like it that he would like to have it more if i felt like it. now i just try harder to get in the mood because i want to please my husband and also because i want to be in the mood. once a woman starts having sex she's glad she's doing it, its just about getting in the mood. also when she does have sex with you show her how much you enjoy it, make it enjoyable for her, and make her want it more.|`|BgVWSApdaa	It depends so much on your relationship - if one of you is controlling, what your attraction levels are, personalities and stress levels etc.  If you push her when she has nothing to give, it could make her feel like a piece of meat and she will grow to resent you.  You could just ask her how she feels when you make a move when she's not in the mood.  Is it a turn off?  Does it upset her?  Or does she kind of like to know that you want her?  There are so many variables that this might be a question you need to take up with her.|`|DaKOec8aaa	i  think you have to learn  NEW STYLES in  making love ...sometimes doing the same ~3,-4 styles make us BORING!   next time you make love again give a  little bit more cereativity & sexy , make your partner a little bit carzy in bed.....GOOD LUCK!!!!|`|m8alP5kPaa	Yes it matters.

It's rare that I would be totally against the idea of having sex unless I was sick or something like that. I don't think you have to be 'up for it' to enjoy it. Sometimes you start off not being that into it but then the experience is great anyway. If you love each other, then sometimes you do things for each other like that. I think it would be pretty selfish to only be thinking about yourself and only want to do it when you are in the mood.|`|5RoYyprkaa	When my husband's in the mood for sex, and I'm not, he usually just tries a little harder, and it doesn't take me long to get in the mood.

Other's just think they're the **** and they like to act like they are able to have any guy they want, so they try to flex their muscles by stealing men from other women (regardless of whether they actually have feelings for these guys or not). I'd say that the stripper is this kind of girl, and the waitress just being jealous because a stripper is hitting on you! A lot of women see men as sex fiends and when it is waved in their face they can't help but to give into it, even if they are into someone else. Just tell the stripper friend to lay off, when she mentions "your girlfriend" just smile and say something like "not yet, but we're getting there" she'll get the hint. Be sensitive to the waitress friends feelings too, she's justified.

As a woman myself, I understand this. The reason the stripper is acting like this is because she is a whore and also because it is Human Nature to want what you can't have. You have made the right decisions so far. If I were you, I would give them both what they want, and convince them to have a threesome. Also, I bet they would be down for anal. Astroglide is the best lube. After the threesome, date the waitress, even if she wasn't the better of the two in bed.
wKfP840raa	Go  to a dress shop and try on dresses that are similar as to get an idea. The first one I wouldn't go with if you are self conscious about your hips cause it makes the toothpick model look hippy.  You should go with an Empire waist so that the dress flows away from the body instead of clinging to it.<br>  I am a plus size and the dress I ordered (from www.lightinthebox.com)<br>  is very slimming, here is a pic of me in it if you like.<br>  <a href="http://s337.photobucket.com/albums/n369/mrsdoyle_01/" rel="nofollow">http://s337.photobucket.com/albums/n369/...</a><br>  <br>  I really do stress going and trying on different styles before ordering, it was a HUGE help with me and I am so glad I did it.<br>  <br>  Good Luck and Congratulations. <br>  <br>  Also here is a site that will help you choses the most flattering dress style for your body type.<br>  <a href="http://www.brides.com/fashion/dresses/customfit" rel="nofollow">http://www.brides.com/fashion/dresses/cu...</a>|`|hKss8M9Raa	First answerer is dead on. If it were a slinky fabric it may not be the best but that fabric looks great on everyone. If you are worried about it fitting right, it would probably be best to err on the side of ordering it a little big and having it taken in because it's a lot easier to make a dress smaller. And don't worry, the bride is always the prettiest one at the wedding. I've never been to a wedding where that wasn't true!|`|h3NJO9dWaa	Personally I don't like either dress, but the styes of both look like they will be very flattering on you. Just out of curiosity, are you ordering it from mybigfatbeautifulwedding.com? I've been looking at dresses on there and they are reasonably priced and gorgeous. If not, check it out. They custom make dresses according to your measurements too|`|CLJXTsFJaa	I think both dresses are great - Personally I love the red one.  However I think that the first one would hide things better because of the shape.  If you would feel more comfortable then wear slimming garments.  I would sorry am.  I am getting married in October next year and really can't wait.<br>  <br>  Congratulations and best of luck|`|PoBIyZ27aa	I don't think the dress would be problematic. It looks like it would be flattering on any figure as long as it's in the right size. Beautiful dress.|`|YvJdkSNaaa	It's your wedding day.  You could show up in a burlap sack with lipstick streaked up to your forehead and he'd still think you're beautiful.|`|hy9fz99Xaa	If you are ordering a wedding dress on ebay that is from overseas, I would strongly recommend not doing it. My sister in law AND one of my friends did this and they both ended up basically throwing the dresses away because they couldn't even resell it. The dresses are made from completely different material than it looks (knock offs of the pictures they give you) and are NOT custom fit at all, just mildly readjusted.  My sister in law was in tears when she got hers and tried it on (after waiting on it for 2 months, not to mention the complete lack of sellers communication because of the language barrier).  It fit her absolutely improperly and looked aweful (this girl was Ms. Southeast Missouri, nothing should look aweful on her that was supposed to be "custom fit").<br>  <br>  That aside, the dresses are bautiful (well, the non-knockoffs are) and especially the first one, would be fine for a more-to-love girl (aka love handles). This is the exact cut of the one I am going to wear next may and I don't have pretty love handles or super flat tummy :) If this is the cut you are looking for, it should be fine.|`|qlCpWosgaa	I believe you shouldn't be confused between the two.<br>  two dresses are not alike and with consideration of your skin complexity and other physical appearance, your wedding arrangement and setting will give you a clearer choice which one is right for you.<br>  in term of being overweight, as long as it doesn't scare people away. you will be fine, and remember it's your wedding!<br>  what matter is just between you and your fiance.<br>  <br>  my opinion about the dress;<br>  the first one with hand bag looks great and classic, elegant and if you have dark hair. they will look much better. not to mention the ornaments and strips take a ways people attention from the love handles you are concerned.<br>  <br>  on contrary, the white and long wide red strip is very elegant for royal wedding in churches or something a like. also consideration if you have curves along the mid section will show much clearly in this dress.<br>  <br>  sum: i'd prefer the first dress in general event, but if you have other elements working for you to opt the 2nd dress. it's works great too :)<br>  <br>  Enjoy your wedding|`|76nTvO4iaa	I'd get a dress with a corset back on it.  That way, it can be adjusted so the "love handles" aren't there.<br>  <br>  Both of the dresses are beautiful!|`|4POGapREaa	I'm sure it will be fine.  Look into spanx.

I too have big hips/butt lol and the style of my dress is very extremely similar. I thought I would need something extra to cover the unsightly lumps so-to-say lol. But, with my demon bra, as I call it, lol (the type of bra that goes down to your waist) the dress looks fabulous! As someone else said, order a little big, and you can always have it taken in to make sure its the perfect fit! Good luck!|`|JtEBaOdjaa	I LOVE that first one. I was looking at it earlier today.<br>  I'd recommend going to a bridal salon BEFORE you order and trying on dresses that are similar to it.  You may end up putting it on and realizing it's HORRIBLE on you.  It's pretty simple. It should suit most body types.  Go to a bridal salon and try some on just in case.<br>  That way you know for sure. <br>  <br>  I think body shaping underwear would be fine though. Spanx can do wonders:D lol.|`|2o3BHgCCaa	Ok, firstly when you measure yourself wear the underwear you plan to wear on the day, whether that be spanks or a corset or a bra.<br>  You can wear something underneath the dress to give you the figure you want.<br>  When you order the dress make sure it has inbuilt boning, that will also help with a feminine waistline.<br>  I like the first one.<br>  good luck|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	Those are both really pretty. I think definitely wear slimming panties and something to keep everything together.|`|bu6BhCnpaa	i think you will be fine...that kind of dress is made to be flattering...<br>  <br>  the underwear would help...but make sure you take your measurements with it on...and all it would do would be to smooth things out...so you wouldnt have creases...<br>  <br>  dont worry you will be fine...i would be more concerned with a silky or skinny dress...but something liek what you are looking at...thats waht a majority of brides wear and large or skinny...all look great....|`|LbvRxf2jaa	They're both beautiful dresses.<br>  I have the same problem - that's a perfect type of dress cause it disguises your lower half.<br>  To me ordering online is a mistake, but you've chosen to do that so - I like the first one better - it's more different - the second one I've seen everywhere I have gone...<br>  <br>  Good luck with your choice and congrats!|`|TUNvbXbgaa	they are both beautiful dress i think the 1st would look really good on you.  there are slimming underwear  you can buy that will help. I am 5'5 and i have a small pudge that will never go away cause of my son. the doctors told me i need a tummy tuck. i wore one of those slimming underwear and it worked.|`|TJKvoLeBaa	Go to a dress shop and try them on.  The first one is by Maggie Sottero, it is called Vincenza.  The second is an Alfred Angelo dream in color style.  Yes. I understand that your ordering an online knock off, but those can be tried on in the original designer styles in a bridal shop.  Print the pics and take them in.  Good luck.|`|E2X6B1Iaaa	I think the first dress will be very slimming and will fit your body type well. The black lines make it very forgiven and it will focus on your nicer "bits."<br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats!|`|9hPnvmuzaa	I would go with the first one because it seem like it would suck you up a little more.  The second one waist area is so clean cut that any bulge would be noticeable.  Good Luck!|`|AA10086844	I can't tell you how the dress will lay, it is different on every person.  You should go to a bridal shop and try them on.  They will let you do that.  Then you will know how it looks on your frame or if you should be looking at a different style for your body type.<br>  <br>  Side note, if you are planning on ordering this dress off of ebay as a knock-off from China, please don't.  I looked into doing this because the dress that I wanted was SO expensive but after reading around at what other people had to say, I decided that it wasn't worth the risk.  If you are thinking about doing this, you should instead look around on ebay or some of the bridal exchange websites for a pre-owned dress that someone will be selling for much cheaper.<br>  <br>  Good luck and congratulations!|`|d9d7dbffacb9c5256ef7afd69e6023b6aa	Why do you think in the Victorian era and such they had such huge dresses?  <br>  Women are often NOT thin as a rail. <br>  <br>  A high waisted dress with a full skirt can cover anything from a broomstick to a "double wide" and still be just as elegant and beautiful.<br>  <br>  I personally like the one with the black in the pleats, (nice purse, too), but the one with the red in the back is great too.<br>  <br>  If the dress fits right, there is absolutely no need for an uncomfortable undergarment. Almost everyone will know what shape you are, and really won't care. Enjoy your wedding, don't worry about the details that don't matter.
JtEBaOdjaa	I got to the jeans part.  Tell her to dress up or stay home.  Have your good brother give you away.<br>  <br>  I would love to read the rest but next time, break it up a little with some paragraphs.  It's too hard on the eyes.  But hey, at least you have punctuation, and proper spelling.  That's more than a lot of people on Yahoo. lol<br>  <br>  Ah finally got through it lol:<br>  Maybe you should sit down and talk to her about all of this.  Tell her how you feel.  She may not realize she's being so distant.  If you don't think you can talk to her put this all in a letter for her to read.  Let her know you are writing a letter to make sure you say everything that needs to be said. (and don't forget the paragraphs! ;) lol)<br>  <br>  edit: I hope mine was one of the "rude" ones. I wasn't trying to be. I was being completely sincere. And trying to make you smile a bit with that last comment. lol<br>  <br>  And hun, "I know she wants to be there for my brother, I support that fully. He does need the help. I just wish she wouldnt push me off like whatever is all.." that is EXACTLY what you need to say to your mom.<br>  <br>  You can report Lindsey for her comment. It violates the terms of use. She didn't answer your question. I just reported her. I don't know if they'll do anything for just one report though.|`|vtW3qPZmaa	Your mum is being unreasonable and, quite frankly, a bit of a *****.  A nice outfit doesn't have to be expensive... you can get beautiful clothes at thrift stores set in higher-end neighbourhoods for a pittance, so as for wearing jeans, tell her to bugger off.<br>  <br>  I would second the idea of you either walking yourself or having another family member walk you down the aisle.  Your mum clearly sees you brother's graduation as more important than your wedding and you need somebody who is actually supporting you be with you on your wedding day.  If that happens to just be you, then step out and walk yourself proudly.  While you feel that you need your mum there, you really don't.  You've made your own family with your husband and kids and they're the only ones you really need there.  it's sad that your mum seems to think she needs to choose one child over another, but in the end you have your own support network and your own life.  if she's too selfish to make an effort to be part of it you need to leave her behind.|`|8a8CZqGLaa	I would not have my mom walk me down the aisle, but I would walk myself down the aisle, so you're not counting on her support and then her not be able to come. I mean, you definitely want her there- she's been there almost all of your life! But maybe you just don't want her walking you down the aisle since she may not even be able to be there. As for the rest, I really don't know why she's acting that way, and it would make me terribly upset as well... I really wouldn't know how to act either accept cry, but I know that's what point you're at now! I'm sorry I can't help more. =(<br>  <br>  EDIT: Oh and I read it all =)|`|AA11074230	That sucks! I'd be really upset about her not attending. Could there be another reason she doesn't want to attend? Her behavior sounds a bit suspicious. <br>  Write her a letter explaining how you feel and why it's so important to you that she be there. That way she can't interrupt you and hopefully she'll understand where you're coming from. Her behavoir is totally puzzling.<br>  Good luck! I hope your wedding is wonderful!|`|BUFgf2S2aa	While reading your story, I couldn't help but think of the old bible story about the prodigle son.  Are you familiar with it?  There are two brothers...one who basically does what is expected of him, full loyalty and honor to his father, and a second brother who lives so fully for himself that he hits bottom hard.  When the second brother finally gets his act together, the father puts together a huge party because in his eyes he had lost this son.  For all intents and purposes, this child had been dead, and now had been given back to his father.  The first son, however, was understandibly angry (and I would imagine a little hurt and confused) because he had done everything right and yet had not been, in his eyes, given such consideration by the father.  He confronted his father about it, and the dad explained that he had, at all times, all that his father had (implied, money, time, love, respect) but that the son had to understand that the brother had been lost and now returned.  It was right to celebrate such a thing.  <br>  <br>  Try not to be too hurt.  I see your mother doing all that she can so that she'll not loose her son once again.  In that respect, it is to support him because he is in a fragile place and so easily could be lost again.  At all the time this was happening, you have had - by your own story - all that your mother has had to give.  You have never been deprived, and shouldn't really deprive her now by making her, in essense, choose between a very strong and capable adult child who is about to embark on a life with a spouse, and one who she could loose.  <br>  <br>  Perhaps what she said about the dress could have been put a little differently, but perhaps she was feeling the stress and strain, or maybe was even reacting to tension you were bringing to the conversation (and I wouldn't blame you if that's what had happened...perfectly understandible).  She may be concerned with spending the money on clothing, or if you were going to buy the dress, concerned about your spending the money on an outfit if she's not quite certain she can swing both taking time off for your brother and time off for your wedding.  Release her from that concern by telling her to wear whatever outfit she currently has if that helps her.  You can explain that you are having a difficult time understanding or accepting that she wouldn't be there for your own wedding, but that you need to know that she's there for you as well.  If that only means that she still celebrates the day by being involved as much as she can, then so be it.  Obviously you don't want her to jepordize her job for either your wedding or for the graduation.  Just as obviously, you'd rather have her at your wedding...but I don't think it is as simple as her pushing you off so much as it is that she's sorta stuck between a rock and a hard place on this.  I'm sure in her heart she'd rather be at your wedding, but is making this choice on what the most fragile child needs. <br>  <br>  I would guess that she is very very proud of you, and would not want to cause you pain.|`|e3TFWUizaa	Yes its long, but you need to vent. You may not be able to have your mom, your best friend at your wedding!! That's a big deal. But I think you have a right to be upset. Your brother is a grown man and he should learn for himself instead of your mom babying him because then you have to suffer for it. I know, my mom had kind of the same situation with my uncle and my grandma. My grandma,time after time stresses herself out, even spending money she doesn't have to help him. And he treats her so wrong. Try to talk to your mom about it. Pour out your heart to her so she can really get the sense of how much it would mean to you for her to be there. BUT!! Make sure you don't let this ruin your special day, whatever the outcome and remember its your fiances day too and he wants you to be happy.<br>  I hope things work out for you, if not make sure you wear a big smile anyway as you begin your life with a man that loves you and will never disappoint you this way.|`|m9edf5Bkaa	Yes i agree this is a Long one but if you have to let it out let it out. Im going to start with saying my brother was going to be the one to walk me down the aisle in my 2010 wedding but he passed away one year ago. The reason im telling you this is because I miss my brother more then anyone could possible think, So help your mom help your brother. Understand that he needs help right now and your mom just feels like she has to be there for him. I would much rather my mom been able to help my brother then have him pass away. You never know whats going to happen tomorrow so keep your head up and plan your wedding with or with out your mother. I cant lie if I was you I would be Very mad too but back to the first part of my answer your mother feels like she has to help your brother get through his problems. And there is a plan for everything and Im sure it will work out for  you and your future husband good luck with everything!

jPJ9MTCwaa	Do you two have a preference?  I don't think that because it is a same sex wedding you should feel limited to do it in a certain way.  If you want the whole big sha-bang totally do it formal.  Maybe make it lovely and intimate with close friends and family and low lights.  Love it!  If you want something a bit more casual maybe have a rustic, picnic style in a botanical gardens or park.  I'm really big into unique locals right now like art museums and downtown penthouses.  Very nice.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	Either way is good, it depends on the weather, and your  spouse's opinion|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	Congrats!!! <br>  <br>  If your families are close and all, you invite them and maybe have a laid back BBQ at a local park or if you have a nearby open garden/country club place?<br>  <br>  Actually, it's cold now, if you are in the US, so maybe inside would be better. Maybe you can rent out a dance hall or country club area if you can afford it.<br>  <br>  Or you can have it in a pool hall if you both enjoy billiards  or rent out a night club?|`|117ba8dee6d7175b6b3f5e2480ad6007aa	This is really hard to answer! It depends on personal preference and what seems more fun and comfortable to you guys!<br>  I personally love a mixture of both. I love the idea of an outdoor wedding, particularly at sunset, but I wouldn't want it to be "picnic" style. I would want outdoor, but formal. Meaning like...a huge canopy set up over where the reception would be, and a covered dance floor.|`|sMUiGFPraa	Try to combine your preferences. Elegant is always the way to go in my opinion. it also depends on what time of year, daytime or,evening. Formal or informal. Start there. and you'll be surprised where the two of you will get in planning. Congrats and good luck.
Ybo6HS8Caa	Nope, I didn't take pics of my first time.  And even if Demi Moore did, I wouldn't know, cuz I have no desire to look at her "uglies".

In my day we din't do that but neither did we abort millions of babies--i also don't think babies at the breast is so cute either, <br>  I hate when they say ''we're pregnant'' hey you have to have been impregnated to become pregnant, no man can be impregnated. WHAT A BIG DEAL THEY MAKE OF IT TODAY---half the population is in the birthing room, including the fil, gawking at her---pics of the belly, pics of the birth--then guess what 2 years later he's in a strip club, cheats, they get divorced and then they argue who has to pay c.s. for the kid.|`|AA11739944	firstly, it's "pregnant" and secondly, I have no idea. probably because those women are so happy that they are carrying the child that they made with the person they love.

Though it may seem ridiculous to someone outside of the situation, a pregnant person may feel that having a photo of their belly during pregnancy... though physically unattractive... may be a good way to remember the emotionally elevated period.|`|kN4EaiUDaa	because its a major part of a man and woman's life and is something a couple want to cherish the rest of their life. there's nothing more a married couple can do that makes them closer and united than to combine their genetics, love, morals, and backgrounds into a whole new life. people who think pregnant bellies are gross are shallow and childish because pregnant woman are bringing new life into the world|`|pWO6Bu9Laa	Some women are actually beautiful pregnant.<br>  but i totally agree w/ Jay Jay on this...<br>  Wouldn't u rather see a picture than video of birth!!??!<br>  Ughh, never wanna see sumthin lyk dat again. <br>  [i remember watching it in child development class]<br>  but uhm yeh its definitely a more "clean" way of<br>  showing that you've had a memorable pregnancy.<br>  i guess, take that from a girl who's ever been prego.|`|HK3PpnPDaa	because its amazing if you think about it. say your a 16 year old and you look at a picture of your mom's belly when she was pregnant with you. that WAS you. like isnt that totally amazing??? not to mention the pictures turn out gorgeous and i think they are sooo pretty.|`|m8alP5kPaa	Its a girl thing, we like to look back in the baby book and remember what we looked like and get ultrasound pictures and all that.|`|LGCTOxZxaa	Cause its an important and empowering time in our lives.

vRuNSY8Oaa	First of all, I think it's really sweet that you're nervous.  I was nervous to talk to my ex (<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090222194450AAhQXJ2)">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a> boyfriend about liking him and his friend who supposedly know for years finally told him.  <br>  <br>  I've done told guys I like them in multiple ways.  I left a note on a guy's locker once.  I've emailed/myspaced guys too.  HOwever, my recommendation is to just ask him out.  It's doing two things for you, one it's you asking him to go hang out with you one on one.  Two it's telling him that you like him.  <br>  <br>  Try, I don't know how old you are, but "Hey, my friends and I are going bowling on Saturday.  And since I consider us friends, you should join us. -cheesy grin-"  When he says yes, take him aside, get a chance to talk to him one on one.  Make cheeky comments like "Wow, I'm really glad you're here."  It won't make you feel all awkward like "i like you" run for the hills!  But it will make both of you more comfortable! :D|`|aHWGRNbDaa	The best way, and the way I love to tell a guy I like him is by getting really close to him. Talking deeply with him, but only if he does back and showing affection by hugging him when i get the chance and being very smiley and flirty around him. My boyfriend whose been mine since october 2007 is so amazing. we communicated back in those days by AIM and we went to school together. We would always hang out at school and poke eachother in the hallway while we passed by and laughed at eachother's jokes. It took two whole months for us to admit our feelings but it was damn worth it. We had so much fun and that guarenteed us a long and healty relationship, The best thing for you to do is just send him the right signals and, yeah get him to take an intrest in your life- if he thinks you have a great life he may be more temped to join you in it! Liking someone is a journey that ends in complete satusfaction if you play your cards right. If he's ment for you hell tell you, and If the time comes around and you'd like to tell him how you feel be very aware of his feelings, whatever they may be, and talk sincerely to him. If he cares for you hell understand if he doesnt feel the same way. <br>  You can also look at these Wikis I enjoy looking up. Amazingly im so good these express almost all that i was saying =] anyway, theyre helpful. Tell me how it works out in Email! Good Luck and just have fun!

Focus on just him and when you heart is melting and beating SUPER fast and you feel amazing causcailly say "(insert name) I think I like you...." and see what he says <br>  I know it's like OMG it's earier said then done but when the moment comes you just have to do it and if you don't you'll regret it.<br>  I'll pray for you tonight that everything goes good.|`|omZzhx4Gaa	You can go one of 2 ways:<br>  <br>  Up front - just tell him that you like him and think he's awesome, and see what he says.<br>  <br>  Subtle - drop little hints like flirting, texting, looking at him and smiling during class, touching him on the arm when you talk, etc.  See how he reacts...if he starts to do that stuff in return, that's a green light to move forward and be more obvious.|`|rtcubrgtaa	well if your pretty good friends with him and yu talk to him alot then itll be good to tell him. when yu guys are alone (not around all your other friends) then just say "i think i might like you" and see what he says back. if he says oh? then just say "yeah but idk" if he doesnt take it as well as yu thought then its ok. just ask him how he feels about you and if he doesnt like you back then just say okay then just forget it then and act like it never happened. if you guys are friends and hes single then its probably a good chance he might like you a little back|`|x2bTvscWaa	i agree with everyone else. leaving hints and being all flirty is beating around the bush. just tell him when u find him not with his friends and ur not with yours. be real nice, and tell him u like him. SAY, "hi, i don't want this to wreck our friendship or anything, and i really hope this isn't akward, but i really like you. Do u think u might like me back?" hope that works... i|`|I7nEkhc6aa	You should just tell him, we don't like the games. You can even tell him over the phone,text,online,myspace,facebook,anyth... Just tell him.|`|I2gs5opxaa	hii all starts with being friends and go from there .|`|bmmlJ7a1aa	have a friend tell him u think hes hot<br>  then, if he has any brains, hell stry to chat with u<br>  go from there|`|6AtmwCMvaa	say i like you right in his face!
7BG6eM7zaa	You have every right feeling this way. She should have stayed with you or took you home. She should say she is sorry for not staying with you. You need to let her know how you feel.|`|y7PaRczqaa	yes, and it could of been worse, you could of gotten raped and beaten, who knows maybe killed.. i dont think you should talk to this so called friend!|`|63tch8D5aa	yes it some perspecticts this does seem wrong that she hasnt stuck up for you,<br>  but to be honest, it was your own fault for getting drunk and why should she take care of you,<br>  she probaly does feel quilty but doesnt feel she should be held responsible for your actions,<br>  you need to stick up for yourself.
FWPSzFVhaa	You are looking in the mirror when you should be looking inside your heart.  What do you fear seeing there?  <br>  <br>  It is easy to become emotionally hooked on abuse.  It offers an excuse to not look inside.  We are often afraid of what we will find when we look there.  Too many times we do know we are nice looking on the outside - others tell us and we do have mirrors.  But because we hurt so much on the inside, we see the imperfect us looking out.<br>  <br>  If you want to really get through this battle, you will have to work your rear off for it.  This will not be easy.  But it can be done.  I know - I did it.  <br>  <br>  1)  Start being honest with yourself - totally.  There are things you do like about yourself.  There are also things about yourself you do not like.  Make a list of both.  And be honest - don't lie.  If you lie- you are only cheating yourself.  <br>  <br>  2)  Take the list of the things you don't like and accept them for what they are...( for example you might consider allowing yourself be be used by guys as a flaw)...  But then make up your own mind about how you want to address those parts.  You CAN decide if you want to be a victim over and over - or if you want to make a stand.  You can decide if you want to be happy - or if you are content living in your own misery.  That is YOUR right to make those choices.  Realize what it is you have the power to change and accept responsability for those things.<br>  <br>  3)  Learn how to live in the NOW.  Self confidence comes when you allow yourself to experience life as it is without fear of self punishment.   Living in the NOW means that you do not punish yourself for the mistakes of the past.  You can learn from the past and aply the lessons to this NOW.   <br>  <br>  Best of luck to you!|`|7cbIlyMeaa	just be yourself, forget about what other people say and live your life.|`|Cpp1LddVaa	The biggest thing you can do is turn your inward focus outward.<br>  <br>  I'm not even going to waste my breath telling you that everyone is physically flawed one way  or another -- or that those most tortured in this regard tend to be super models and beauty pageant contestants.<br>  <br>  Instead I'm going to vigorously recommend that you get out of yourself and into the world and look for opportunities to help because  (1) there's a ton of work to do out there (2) it's better to be appreciated and sometimes loved for what  you DO rather than what you look like and (3) nothing is more "beautiful" than making the world a better place.<br>  <br>  Maybe your first stop should be either the local YWCA or the local SPCA.  Both seem to be good magnets for the kind of compassionately intense females who are probably good role models for you right now.  <br>  <br>  Good  luck and best wishes.

2o3BHgCCaa	AU$2 each for flocked invitations with ribbon. <br>  That price included the Invitations, RSVP, info cards and placecards. It came to about AU$120 for 100 guests<br>  I DIY'd them myself. If was so much cheaper then buying them.<br>  Here they are:<br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stiffydagold/3237669809/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/stiffydagol...</a>|`|kj507W26aa	I had a small intimate day wedding for 80 people at a beautiful Private Country Club overlooking a golf course in July .  I went into a elegant print shop in Mexico and selected mine.  I paid $65.00 for invitations and splurged on my food.<br>  Keep the flowers and invitations to a minimal. And really save your money for the honeymoon or your food.|`|AW1dCzH0aa	I have a crafty bridesmaid who helped me make mine with a DIY kit from Target.  She's lining the envelopes and doing the calligraphy herself.  There are tons of places out there you can get DIY invites:  Payrus, Target, Michaels, even Wal Mart.  As much as these beautiful pieces of paper mean tons to you... your guests will likely be throwing them in the trash!  Bear that in mind when you are spending money on them!|`|AA10784932	Im making mine myself. I bought paper from Hobby Lobby which was about 6 papers for $1 when i caught it on sale,and cut it down to size,and printed the invitation on the computer. And im just using simple enevlopes, but im going to dress them up somehow on the computer. So the most expensive thing will be paying postage! We are having about 300 people probably.. about 250 invites i think.. idk. goodluck!|`|JtEBaOdjaa	I got 50 from Michaels for $35 (it was 40% off but even full price that's cheap).

I found some print your own invitations on clearance at Wal-Mart.  Since I'm having a "autumn" themed wedding, I picked up ribbon, pearls and fall leaves in my colors and I'm decorating them myself.  I only have 65 invites to send out so it isn't a lot to do and I actually enjoy making them.  It makes it a little more personal to me.  And with the invitations, envelopes, and response cards (& envelope of course) they are only costing me about 87 CENTS EACH!  <br>  <br>  Good luck and congratulations!!|`|hKss8M9Raa	I spent about $90 for 160 custom made invitations. Each one was unique because I made them myself! My mom did a sketch that resembled me and my fiance which a scanned into the computer. Then I added the details I needed. I made them 3 to a page by setting the page on landscape and using 3 columns. I took them on a flash drive to be printed at Office Depot (they had the best price on color copies). The papers was pearlized and the accompanying insert with directions was on linen paper. Included in this amount were special envelopes, craft supplies and a book of scrapbook paper that I used as backing. They turned out beautifully and did not cost a lot at all even though they looked like they did!|`|AcBbB39aaa	You can find some great invitations here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://bjoyfulinvitations.cceasy.com/WE_SearchResults.cfm?prev=1&TempPrev=0&blnPreviewRequestSubmitted=0&recordsperpage=8&CompletedOrder=0&sBasketID=0&Group=WedEnsCCa&alogo=1&menu=None&morethanonepage=YES&HostDomain=0&FirstTimeThrough=1&option=WE_SearchResults.cfm&format=WedEnsCCa&CFID=27395760&CFTOKEN=79984889" rel="nofollow">http://bjoyfulinvitations.cceasy.com/WE_...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.einvite.com/?Cobrand=8KF0IK&Site=eInvite&vk=1777211146" rel="nofollow">http://www.einvite.com/?Cobrand=8KF0IK&S...</a>|`|aipChC3haa	I have a wedding planner so she got them together, so I have 400 guests and I haven't gotten them yet, but they will cost around $1000 or more.|`|ktn8aoTgaa	I got mine from <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.idovedesign.com.au/" rel="nofollow">http://www.idovedesign.com.au/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.idovedesign.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.idovedesign.com/</a>
YMbvOmryaa	She still needs to grow up. If she broke up with you then what you do with your time is none of her business Any girl that would get jealous over a guy she broke up with is still a child. She probabally feels like you should be grieving the loss of her. Ignore her and she will get over herself in time.|`|5NBV7i5Gaa	Some girls inflate their egos when they think men are attracted to them.|`|uff3kOoFaa	by asking in the first place, even though she wasnt intrested in the first place, made her feel special. seeing you move on might make her a little jealous because you dont want her anymore.|`|iB27Flhvaa	Girls dont always know what they want<br>  And sometimes, it just takes that extra little kick to see that the guy is desired enough for them to have competition<br>  It makes them see what they are missing out on, and want it more.<br>  <br>  Or they could be playing hard to get, and annoyed that you didnt chase long enough.|`|gy4hYyK2aa	She may be trying to play hard to get. Or she just likes you but is too proud to admit it (no offense intended). She also might be shy and is very scared to start a relationship.|`|S30Dcsvgaa	You answered your own damn question. Its a woman. Nobody understands them.|`|4dXcZhuTaa	we're all insane|`|J6SWB7r3aa	Uhm.. I hate to admit this, being a girl myself *laughs*, but at times we do feel like we have to play hard to get to increase our value for you. We need proof that you'd go the distance for us, even if just a teeny bit. When we reject you then you straight away move on to another girl (given that we like you in return), of course we'd get jealous, cuz we like you, we wanna tell you that but we shouldn't give in that easy to not be called 'easy', thus we can't tell you, so we reject you to make you want us more and try harder so we can say yes happily, but you proof otherwise.<br>  <br>  Oh what to do.. this is a girl's insight that guys probably can't understand.|`|mVUpt8waaa	Because she has lost any control she has over you since you have moved on with another girl.  It is a blow to her ego.<br>  <br>  it is not to make her more desirable, she was never interested in you, but she did like the fact that you like her.|`|u5e0awpOaa	I'd say the latter.

uuV1ak58aa	I like the answer of the other guy if you contact your attorney he will be able to get you some answers very quickly. Unfortunately many of us do not have the $$ for an attorney. I suggest starting your search at the courthouse in the county you were married in. They should have the documentation available at little to no cost to tell you if you were actually married legally.

Either he meant that it really was great, or he's completely not into you at all. No in between.

4o3jXz3Waa	We all make bad decisions and do wild and crazy things (such as having a live in play toy, lol), but you are right to see the light and want out of this lifestyle if for no other reason but the sake of your child.  It is definitely the right thing to do.  Your husband needs to understand that for you, continuing your current lifestyle is not an option.  He is going to have to choose......either be your husband or be with the boyfriend.  It may come to divorce, that's up to your husband.  If he doesn't find you and your baby a priority over the boyfriend then you will be better off not being married to him in the long run.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|C9brWMriaa	I hate to break this to you, but if your husband doesn't want the boy friend to leave it maybe because he "enjoys" him also.

Work on yourself and continue your education so that whether or not these guys stick around - you can provide for your child.  I'll tell you that it's not a good sign to me that your husband is the one lobbying to keep this guy in the house.  and one more thing...how do you just KNOW your husband is the dad, just curious?|`|JVYs2TCpaa	Your husbands banging your boyfriend. Thats first. Youre not prego...youre pregnant. Its time to grow up. You want your child to learn to speak properly and you are his/her first example. Go back to school while your child is in daycare. Is there any good reason why you are married a bi man. You dont have what he likes, so he was bound to look for that little something that is missing. I cant see why you did not see this coming.|`|TJewjzi9aa	This is a hard one but I understand. <br>  Tell him your concerns and let him know the fun you both or the fun he had before child cannot continue after the child. You see adults make decisions and then expect children to understand. Your husband needs to put aside his needs and be a father to the child and a husband to you. Boyfriends and Girlfriends are what we play around with while growing up.|`|uN0mUZOzaa	divorce ur still young. heard of more fish in the sea|`|8j7FCEOraa	Well, why dont you all move out into a duplex?

You'll also have the  money that you'd normally spend on the hospital bills that you can use to pay for the car. but it's ultimately you and his decision.|`|slJWqCI5aa	In my opinion I think what you have right now is fine. Put that tax refund in savings for now and make a compromise - in 6 months...he can get another car but he has to put $100 into savings every month.

You forgave him, but you never forget.  I think you should seek some counseling is this is bothering you that much.  If you don't think he is cheating have a talk with him when he is a good mood.  Tell him to tell you the truth and see what he says.  If you found out he is cheating on you, you have to dump him.  It's not worthy to live your life like that.  Actually my opinion is that you don't trust him and I don't blame you since neither you or I know, that's why I advice you have some counseling.

Your going to have signs on the sides of the wall and on the door, saying something like, " Follow the hearts to a night of love and romance" or, " Your getting closer....closer"  When he comes into the room, you can have his faviorite music playing, feed yourselves wine, and cheese, or even dinner.  If your able to get a hold of some red flowers, or roses, you can either place them in the bath tub, or simply use bubblebath with a fragrance that he likes.  To end the night away, you can either do the ha cha, cha,  the boom, boom, ba, or simply play a game of scrabble,, cards, or even watch a game together. The most important thing is to have fun with it and enjoy each other.|`|kN4EaiUDaa	i understand since i've gotten pregnant i've been neglecting my husband and in romance and sex department also. first off let him know that you see that you've been neglecting him and apologize for it. next try and make an attempting a couple of times a week to put the books aside an hour early before bed and leave that time for him so then you can either have sex or just crawl in bed together early and watch t.v. together. the only thing that will help you get your husband his attention is if you enforce it and do it. if your really bad off try the 30 days of sex method and make it a goal to have sex everyday for 1 month. that works great and really does help spark up your marriage because you'll both of plenty of time to try new things with having sex daily|`|C9brWMriaa	This is simple. Just pick any night you choose and greet him at the door naked.  If he is a man, you won't have to do anything else.|`|61Fwbi79aa	Set up a night for just the two of you. It looks like you are a nurse, get a naughty nurse outfit!|`|th7C1aoaaa	hand cuff yourself to the bed and let him have you for a day.

2o3BHgCCaa	I love Emerald and Asscher cut diamonds.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	round actually.  if done right it can look absolutly stunning.<br>  <br>   my ring has one large round center stone, three smaller round stones arranged in a triangle shape on each side, then i forget how many small round pave set diamonds going halfway down each side|`|PBdPD748aa	i always thought i would love the round cut - its classical yet elegant. but on me - no!! i also love marquis and pear shapes - they are very unique and timeless.<br>  <br>  i went with a princess cut :) its a beautiful cut and really suits me well - it has a fresh modern look to it and is cut well to reflect the most sparkle, so that would definately be my all time favourite cut!!|`|b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	Round Brilliant<br>  <br>  I would say princess is common, too. It is the new "round brilliant."<br>  <br>  Emerald is classic and I also like it, though it doesn't have the sparkle of a round brilliant.|`|6232dd37ccf9c50bd95a31fea560fff1aa	Princess and marquis shape, at the moment Im still finding it hard to decide which shape to get because they both are so nice|`|AW1dCzH0aa	I have a cushion cut diamond and I love it.  It looks a bit like a princess, but with more rounded edges.  I've never seen anyone else with a cushion cut and I love mine!|`|FP8gUzMaaa	I would say princess cut is becoming increasingly more common these days... I see more and more princess cuts than anything else to be honest.<br>  <br>  Depending on the setting, I think all cuts have the potential to be truly gorgeous.|`|ISnJu0W3aa	i like emerald cut. (also with gems) its a bit different and looks stunning when accompanied with diamonds set into the band out the sides.|`|iN27E3WCaa	I have a round and I wouldn't trade it for the world.  It sparkles like crazy and it's just beautiful.|`|9hPnvmuzaa	princess w/o a doubt|`|lpeHQj3aaa	I like princess, oval and marquise.|`|0LSuFk4Qaa	Mine is a 1ct. princess cut with side diamonds. And i love it.|`|8a8CZqGLaa	my engagement ring has a princess and it's my favorite too... it does have little round ones in the band though|`|YZokRYWcaa	Marquise. i just think they're so dainty and pretty :)|`|vCZuh3oDaa	That is not the diamond "cut," that is the diamond SHAPE.<br>  <br>  "Cut" refers to ideal, very good, good, etc.<br>  "Shape" refers to round, oval, marquis, princess, cushion, pear, etc.<br>  <br>  For the record, I prefer round diamonds, because they are the diamonds that sparkle the most.  Because of their shape, they have the most fire.  They are also timeless.|`|AA10987212	I say princess cut...my ring is a princess cut main diamond with 3 smaller princess cut diamonds on each side and I love it!! My wedding band is also princess cut diamonds all the way accross and they compliment each other nicely.  <br>  <br>  However, round diamonds do look bigger to the eye and sparkle much nicer then princess cut do.|`|c4135808b48d589a16889fe0f1cecf39aa	I used to want a marquis diamond... until my husband proposed with a round solitaire. 10 years and a new ring later, I now have 3 round stones on my ring and I absolutely cannot imagine having another shape. They are classic and timeless - exactly my taste.<br>  <br>  Jewelery is very personal. What one prefers may not sit with another.|`|WekPVVfVaa	My favorite is definitely princess cut :)<br>  Though i also like cushion cut.<br>  <a href="http://www.alysontalley.com/images/Gemstones_Birthstones/diamond_shapes.png" rel="nofollow">http://www.alysontalley.com/images/Gemst...</a>|`|h3NJO9dWaa	Mine is a European cut and I love it. It's so different, I've never seen another like it. It's like a round and a princess combined|`|PoBIyZ27aa	I love the round cut. It's classic. My engagement ring is a round cut and it reminds me of a star. :)|`|NLTqynRFaa	I like round cut. It is common  but with the right stone it can look very unique and superior.
231e2f619695988a9a2770ac10966cd2aa	only if the have the correct equipment, like what the police have.<br>  otherwise, no they cant.|`|914eae329dc013f1fa679fc3425c5a61aa	they can do a reverse phone search, that may give out your address<br>  unless it is a cell phone. other than that I don't think you can get that kind of information unless you work in law enforcement|`|L9wHaNiBaa	Telephone numbers are tracable. Its called something like reverse number search and if the number is publicly listed they can find the address attached to the phone #. But dont overreact with people search websites, with someone's name and approciamate age you can find out their whole  life. Its just what this world has become. Just be mindful of what you willingly give out. Try email or unlist your phone number to the public.|`|7BG6eM7zaa	It possible if they have the equipment the police does. If they don't, don't worry about it.|`|DgvDXlV0aa	They can if they pay some money!
AcgDcQG0aa	Perhaps he didn't agree with your opinion that this girl treated you poorly.  This kind of thing is a matter of opinion.   And everyone is entitled to have their own opinion.<br>  <br>  But if your friend is questioning your decision.  Then perhaps you should take a closer look at it and make sure you've made the right decision.  Because your friend probably wants you to be happy.  Or else he wouldn't be your friend.|`|A4SU14Wwaa	both ways
AA10065812	Actually, medical studies show sex is best in the morning and it improves your health.<br>  <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/article899012.ece" rel="nofollow">http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/wom...</a><br>  <br>  The end of the day is a bad time for fun.  Your body is at its lowest levels of energy and oxygen.  Your immune system has been in active mode for at least 12 hours, and the temporary storage capacity of your brain is getting full.  This is why it's so important to get at least 8 hours of sleep, or 10 hours if under the age of 30 for males and 24 for females.  That's when you reach full maturity.<br>  <br>  At night, during that period of time between when you go to sleep and start dreaming, your brain's ability to absorb data is shut down and everything in temporary storage is transferred to permanent storage through the creation of chemical bonds, and synaptic connectors, as needed.  While you are dreaming, the data is being categorized. <br>  <br>  At night, your body washes out all the lactic acid that has built up in your muscles during the day, replacing it with oxygen.<br>  <br>  At night, your immune system goes into limited standby mode to regenerate and repair injuries, such as sore and strained muscles.<br>  <br>  At night, prior to the ages of full maturity, all growth and development takes place.  Guys, this means that until age 30, if you are not getting the proper amount of sleep, you are not going to reach your full potential length with your tally whacker.  That might be useful in the morning.  And yes, that contributes to your woody.<br>  <br>  When you wake up, provided you got a proper amount of sleep, your body and your brain are refreshed and ready for the day's activities, so why not start out with a little morning exercise before getting out of bed?<br>  <br>  I hope this answers your question.<br>  <br>  Now, for you night workers, the reason we have so many health problems is that we don't sleep under conditions that properly simulates night time.  According to the AMA, you have to sleep in a room that is absolutely dark.  Any light prevents the brain from entering into night time mode, triggering all the other processes.  The room needs to be cool, as the top of the head puts off a lot of heat while transferring the data.  Not doing this creates a gradual and life shorting condition.  I know, as I sit in a nursing home with a bad heart.<br>  ▼▼▼▼▼▼▼▼▼▼▼▼▼▼▼<br>  <br>  One final note<br>  When I was younger, and my heart worker better, I was a morning love maker.  My wife loved it, except for one problem.  It was 4 AM and I was still sleeping, so I woke up in the morning with no memory of it.  I got all the work and she got all the fun.|`|EENUWAP7aa	Actually he probably has no problems with that, but what he does have a problem with is his mental status towards you. If there is a negative vibe between you and yours it will show in the bed.|`|uO0NW2nZaa	yeah sometimes i do because i work hard all day long and come home totally exhaused not only that i need to make time for my 4 children and then my wife  just when you think a mans life is cruisy it's sometimes not|`|o0Badlndaa	He could be exhausted in the evening or else he got some during the trip home and he is spent ...|`|UYTdVcDkaa	He's got morning wood.  (ZZ Top cut a song about this on the 'Afterburner' album released in 1985).  <br>  <br>  In the am he is rested, and he probably needs to urinate (one way the male system stays off urinating while unconscious is by producing an erection).<br>  <br>  As for the night time slump, try helping to stimulate him mentally as well as physically (research his fantasies: Does he like dirty talk, role-playing, lights on, etc.)|`|tHFY2hg4aa	There's this thing called "Morning Wood." Happens to all us guys. I can't explain it. Maybe we have dreams that we can't always remember. As for me, it doesn't happen every morning, but quite often.|`|po85q148aa	I've heard that men are more aroused in the morning.  I don't know if this is true since I'm a female.  Just something I heard.|`|HUvcQvQYaa	yeah, testosterone is highest when you first wake up.|`|9BoHoOUDaa	he is drunk at night, sober in the morning|`|2b6e38008a5ce6be1cb862d0466e9028aa	morning wood + a good night's rest|`|mCM363I9aa	i like it in the morning too|`|a66nvk0taa	Morning time. Most men get a woody at that time lol|`|f9sL3WgQaa	He is more well rested in the morning.
19JRf8Cxaa	You should get her a beauty set with face wash, lotion (that smells good), bubble bath, and perfume.|`|Gb47ZGNTaa	give her a gift card to a hair salon.|`|QXMCWWAWaa	If she yells at you and stuff I don't think that she really enjoys being around you and I don't think you guys are true friends. Me and my friend have never fought and we have been friends for 5 years! And my other friend (for 2 years) and I always say rude things to each other, but it's all in good fun! So if your friend yells at you and ignores you all the time over silly little things like a picture, I would say she cares more about the picture than keeping your friendship. For a gift I would get her a bracelet.|`|isA4wtnMaa	Possibly another picture?  If she's really your bff she'll understand that you lost it and am sorry.  As for an accompanying present, what about going somewhere in lieu of an actual present.  Maybe you could go skiing, snowboarding, to a theatre production or to a local attraction that she may be interested in.
vn2Lq7hIaa	I think little MISS UGLY had more than paper work in her hands, and I think your husband has more than you in his pants.

Dump the cheater.|`|5ZKdo0Tqaa	take of the blinders and move on dont put your self threw anymore you know in your guts, whats going on|`|GQ5Srj7Daa	You should rent the movie Fire Proof. Then rent or buy the book Love Dare. The movie is about a couple with marital problems.That's all I will tell you as not to give to much info. After you see the movie you will want to get this book in your hands asap. It applies to every married couple.I hope this helps.|`|80zoY5OYaa	hi sweety,<br>     i know you want to stay cause you love him. but its not worth it. you will hurt for a while, but the pain will go away.if i was you i would sit down and write him a letter while he is at work,tell him how bad you hurt. then pack ur bags and leave. if you need any more advice email me at elainalanden@yahoo.com. you need a friend to get through this trust me been there|`|1xlV9l0saa	One of them has to leave or you need to leave him. That is not healthy for you. You cant stop something if its in your face all the time. He is still seeing her I am sure of it. Can he transfer to any other position away from her....who cares if its less money it might save your relationship.|`|slJWqCI5aa	Walk baby - time to leave that man behind!!!|`|CWVBfaPwaa	My husband also works with the woman he had an affair with. Although, she is actually pretty. He said he liked her because she made him feel good about himself and it had nothing to do with her looks. I would half believe that if she were unattractive. Anyways, if I went to my husbands work and they were near each other, I don't know how I'd handle that, because I told him to turn and walk away if he saw her coming towards him. I would have to see the looks on their faces to see if they were enjoying each others company or not. Then I would probably make my decision then as to what I would do.

RYf3sf6Daa	no she treats you like ****<br>  i bet she'll come running back to you when her bf breaks up with her (or the opposite) <br>  and right now it sounds kinda like she doesn't want to be ur friend, so why bother?|`|Pjg1IXXOaa	She treats you like **** and doesn't appreciate you. <br>  <br>  Lilmisssunshine is right. I bet she'll come running back to you when her bf breaks up with her and why bother getting her a gift when it sounds like she doesn't want to be your friend in the first place?
19JRf8Cxaa	They are just so insecure about what they have that they feel like putting you down for no apparent reason.|`|Jh0yyYizaa	Research Jealousy. <br>  Its when someone hates you because of something you have that they don't.

OQF1HlwRaa	This is going to be rude but it seems like your fiance is maybe stuck-up and she plays double standards...she's inviting her bi friend but you can't invite your lesbian friend?<br>  how rude.<br>  she seems a bit unknowledged and or ignorant to the fact that a straight person can prey or scare a child; a lesbian will not and even if so, children cannot tell the difference...hel1 even i can't tell the difference just by looking at them..<br>  <br>  im not going to say not marry her because you obviously proposed to her for a reaon. but id re think her.<br>  <br>  idk she just seems..not my type|`|p8RvGtNYaa	You better get the following straight.  The wedding is much less about you and more about the bride --- no matter what you are made to believe.  It is her day and all women dream about this day all their life.  If you ruin it, you will hear about it for as long as you are married. She gets to choose her guests. This is a broad statement.<br>  <br>  If she is a narrow minded person, you have to live with it.<br>  <br>  But if you want to made a statement on the wedding day, you may as well strap an atomic bomb around you.|`|7d535ccd0098dd19bfe900035ca87c98aa	She's being totally unreasonable.<br>  <br>  Just because shes a lesbian doesn't mean she will behave inappropriately............<br>  <br>  What about all the single males there that might make a play for the bridesmaids aswell?<br>  <br>  AND whats so good about the bridesmaids? ........How does she know that they are even good enough be 'sought after'<br>  <br>  She is acting very immature.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	I would be calling off the wedding.

I wouldn't.|`|q7GBzr6yaa	Shes being rude! Thats so insaine. Its your wedding day too not just hers! Your friend has a right to be there|`|dGBbFwFWaa	i would defenitly  think twice before getting married to someone who has no respect and consideration for other people.. your fiance is out of line.. aside from being selfish.. best thing to do is.. place the cards on the table.. and that is  your lesbian friend  is going to the wedding weather she approves or not.. your lesbian friend will make the choice if she wants to go or not..  if u give in  on this one.. your fiance will run your life as in who u can invite over for friends and family gatherings.. she is just tryin to see if u will do what she says and what she wants.. dont let it be that way.. i dont agree with her.. good luck|`|KmfSCPR7aa	Ur fiance just sounds controlling, y cant u have people only person getting married you are too. think about it. do you love her enough to let her make ur mind up. I think u shoud fight for your freind to be there. Kids are getting scared everyday for stupider ****....shes jus a person not some crazy lesbo monster.|`|cu8fUJbMaa	First, She won't "LET" you?  And yet you're planning on marrying this person? If my husband EVER told me he wouldn't "LET" me do something, you can believe it would be the very first thing I did---right after I told him to hit the road! People who are mature and ready for a life-time commitment don't issue orders to their significant other! They discuss issues that they may disagree about and come to a mutually agreeable solution to the problem. <br>  <br>  Second, she is afraid that your friend will scar little children???  She's a lesbian, not a pedophile!  Geez. And she'll "eye" up the bridesmaids?  Give me a break. Is she also saying this about every single man that will be there? Your soon-to-be wife has issues and my friend.....these will only become an much larger issue after your marriage. My advice?  Rethink the person you are considering marrying because it's clear that you have very different opinions about some very important, basic things.|`|m81dfyOYaa	The guest list is for both bride and groom and unless your friend is totally offensive and off the wall, flamboyantly gay tell you fiancee to leave her on the guest list period, it's your wedding too.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	then stop the wedding as her friends come first and your dont .. then just say i an stopping the wedding until you say yes to my friends ok|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	That you think hard before marrying this woman?<br>  <br>  Intolerance is not pretty...and anyone who is that controlling and abusive before the wedding, i hate to think What she'll be like once she has your name...seriously.<br>  <br>  This sort of bias is simply sick...and she doesn't sound like much of a person. God help you all if you had children, and one of them ended up gay!|`|AA12357988	I would never marry someone so ignorant and intolerant.  What a b#!ch.  This is just a little taste of what your marriage is going to be like.  If she's this nasty and rude about your friends now, it's just going to get worse.  I'd think about this long and hard if I were you.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	This is a sign of things to come... and not a good sign. If it were me, I'd delay the ceremony until this issue was sorted out. I would also suggest marriage counselling before you get married.|`|IvMPh09baa	absolutely inappropriate.  i suggest your fiance get with the times and get with the program.<br>  <br>  your marrying a homophobe.... i would call it off right now if i were you.
S3UxNOhdaa	Yes the guy is miserably unhappy.  Start talking about something else..change the subject to something upbeat when he starts. He will get the message that you don't want to talk about it. Instead of asking him why did he even get married...you should ask him why don't they go talk to someone professional about it?  Perhaps he grew up listening to that in his household and that's what constitutes being married to him. It sounds like you mind your own business and he volunteers all the info.  If he can't afford child support and alimony, he certainly cannot afford a big family. Especially now. He should thank his lucky stars for his wife and child(ren) that he has and get a better attitude.  You're a pal.|`|FtyLwqR5aa	I think he is regretting what he done and wants out so he vents to everyone. Truth to be told he has never mantioned this to his wife.
8FbOtXAXaa	I would be very suspicious if it was my boyfriend carrying a condom in his wallet because for one thing, we don't use them so if I saw that I knew he was cheating. It just depends, do you guys use condoms together? If so, is it the type he always gets? Sounds very fishy to me!|`|9fa961b127e99b8a3d9cd71c67a70e17aa	I am sorry to hear this! there are some logical explanations <br>  1. He's cheating.<br>  2. Waiting for you<br>  3. cheating<br>  4. Maybe hes going to ask you soon? has he been carrying it around?_________________________________...<br>  <br>  I would be suspicious! go spy on him and find out what He's doing <br>  If your caught It's all over and spying may not be the best thing <br>  It's up to you. And if he cheats I'm very very sorry :( But if he is DON'T go running back to him I would break up if i where a girl because obiously he probably will do it again. Good luck<br>  Advice: Never give up. Trust your instincts <br>  If you have that feeling he might be just be careful you Don't do anything you wont regret <br>  Also if its torn/damaged then ditch him.|`|zRc4Swewaa	Does he use it with you?If not then ask her about it but be ready to accept the consequences.He'll probably tell you that you are suspicious and doubtful about your relationship.Peeping on his privacy(looking at his wallet) might hurt the relationship.But explain to him that you are worried about the fact that he carries it.Again think of the consequences when you ask about it.But to know the truth will set your doubts free!|`|392b18ae97259a7518f51868eb7ea463aa	If the relationship has any substance to it then this will be resolved in no time.

If you and your boyfriend are not having sex but he is still carrying a condom around maybe that means that he is being hopeful that if the moment does arise, he shall be ready. If you and your boyfriend do not use condoms but he still carries them around, maybe he is trying to send you a message that the two of you should be practicing safe sex.|`|vRuNSY8Oaa	You don't need to be suspicious unless he's been acting weird.  In sex ed classes, guys are taught to keep them in their wallet.  I keep a condom in my wallet even though I'm a chick, just because.  If something happens, I want to be ready and not preggo.  Trust me darling, be grateful that he's so thoughtful.<br>  <br>  If he's been acting weird or different, go ahead and confront him casually about what he did last night or why he didn't answer the phone.  "What were you up to?  I tried to call..."  I'm SURE he's not cheating, you didn't leave any other signs. <br>  <br>  My advice?  If you're really that uncomfortable?  Go ahead and ask him why he's carrying them.  If he gets shifty and nervous don't jump to the conclusion that he's infidel, it's entirely possible that sex makes him nervous.  Just be cool and talk about it.

It's when the condom disappears from his wallet that you should get suspicious.|`|pAwa23hEaa	Well.. nah.. It all depends on what he used to do before you noticed that! Is there a change of pattern!? That's the question to answer!!<br>  If he's always done that.. then.. well.. you're tripping.<br>  But if you don't know.. yeah.. go ahead and ask: <br>  WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING WITH THAT CRAP IN YOUR WALLET MOFO!?!<br>  LOL<br>  :P|`|0DdSoi4Maa	At least he plans on using them instead of none at all.  Have you had sex with him, then I'd say maybe he's just carrying them around if y'all go somewhere & you can do it.

If hes cheating on you, ditch him fast. If he gives you a reasonable answer but you are still unsure, you should tell him how you feel, if he is a decent guy he should at least respect you and be honest.

We've only had one serious argument and we've been together for 3 years.|`|69x3A1zwaa	um 2 -4 times a week for me|`|mptnpn9maa	Arguing in itself is not a bad thing.  It is necessary, on some level, in order to communicate. When you ask about arguing weekly or several times a week, do you mean minor disagreements or full out and out arguments?  Actual arguments once or more times a week can be an indicator that two people are not really listening to each other or considering each others situation, perspective or feelings/needs.|`|NqMmvvgVaa	It also depends what kind of arguments. My boyfriend and I have little squabbles over silly things sometimes that don't mean much,a nd not much harm is done. But if you are having full on deep seated issues where you are having full blown arguments every week then that is not a good sign.|`|RqQ0K32Baa	Me and my ex never argued until close to the end, and even then it wasn't much. We usually argued like once a month when I was super pissy. (:|`|zwdGBrUZaa	if you argue more than once per week, there needs to be more communication|`|ZNe6B9TQaa	I think it depends on the individual person.  My parents argued semi-regularly and are still very happily married after nearly 30 years.  However, I was in a relationship for 3 years and we had only argued once until after we broke up (I've since been in another year long relationship that ended recently where there was not a single argument).  <br>  <br>  However, if you're arguing regularly and the amount you argue is bothering you, then it's not good.  If you do fine with arguments, then you're probably okay with the occasional argument.  If you're like me, then any argument frustrates you because it represents an inability to properly communicate your feelings in an adult manner to the person you care most about (and should be able to communicate most easily with).|`|VZVGXRyraa	Arguing to a certain amount is actually healthy for a relationship, it helps 2 people grow together and learn how to work things out and compromise. Nothings perfect and people in relationships have to learn to be able to work together so they can make it through things, arguing does that.<br>  <br>  But arguing too much isn't a good thing. I'd say argument once or twice a month is okay...more or less depending on the people involved. But anymore than 4 times a month and the relationship should be re-evaluated.|`|J6SWB7r3aa	Depends on what is the matter at hand. <br>  <br>  If it's serious things to argue about : none per week would be good.<br>  <br>  Petty stuff: 1-2x would be ok, but it has to be really petty and seems silly when you think about it again.<br>  <br>  However, there's really no normal amount to argue, generally speaking. Depends on the 2 of you if you like to argue, maybe 1x a day would be normal for you ^^|`|YMbvOmryaa	It depends on the type of argument. If you are fighting to the point where you are saying hurtful things to each other then it's time to take a break. If the fights are simple and with good humor, they are healthy. Remember it is ok to disagree but it is not ok to be violent or verbally abusive to each other.|`|pS3h9TZBaa	Depends what kind of argument. If they're small and don't really offend either person, it doesn't matter.

Make sure when you talk about it you talk the truth you do not want to be accused of adding more to what really happen, any inconsistencies on your part may be perceive as lies and your credibility will come under question..|`|VygBNA0Waa	he wants to go to bed with you<br>  tell the school councilor what he is saying so you can move class or he can get the sack <br>  tell him that you have a girl but she doesnt go to this school lie so he gets of your back make up a school about 20min away and a girls name and age so when asked this question it comes across true not fake|`|BQulC2Taaa	Something is not right and you seem to know that...Speak with your school counselor or your football coach if you have a good trusting relation with them.  If no changes then by all means go to yur parents and I am sure you will get satifaction.|`|6C5NDSBSaa	You're going to have to talk to your school counselor and your parents.
JEteneuUaa	Hey!!!   If she wanna be a ho3 let her.   no amount of takling blah blah blah gonna stop her from doing feels good with her mans.  <br>  <br>  you should tell dads hey dad your a coool dad and keep him distracted from sis so she don't feel preshure.  <br>  <br>  <br>  k take it easy!<br>  <br>  ShiX-|`|PmYpNontaa	Talk, unfortunately parent her and if things don't work out, figure what is best for you and that means support and discussion about not getting pregnant.  If she is not open to mature thinking......you may have to let her go.|`|noqL1OSgaa	Its spelt Pregnant. . and Maybe shes not having sex if she isnt taking them, or her bf has them.. or maybe she's on the contraceptive pill.. if not, i suggest talking to her about it, going to a free clinic or something.|`|B4nujMnlaa	Maybe she wants to get kicked out of the house so she can live with her boyfriend. I've heard of people doing it. Or maybe they aren't having sex?!|`|7cbIlyMeaa	talk to her about it more often like a friend, try to get close to her and advice her.
19JRf8Cxaa	Tell him that you really liked him and that you only said that you had a date to try to make him jealous. Say that you won't try to pull that one again, and you would really like to go out with him sometime.|`|HDznnh39aa	Go to her house and pull down your pants in front of her and say "What should we do about this?"|`|sgsdBCleaa	maybe he got mad or sad since you lied about the date thing<br>  what i would do is id talk to him even if he doesn't want to talk to you<br>  id tell him the truth . like in myspace message or text or even better face to face , its lying that's gets us in problems so the truth is the only way out .
Hebi4o0Waa	he is a guy that thinks like a girl which could be good i guess. but by telling you that he thought that you didn't like the date makes it sound like he is shy and over thinks things. The four days he probably was just scared and he is probably busy right now haha. <br>  <br>  go do something to get him off your mind call a friend go to a movie watch the oscars do something!|`|76nTvO4iaa	I suspect you answered his question and that ended your conversation.<br>  <br>  When you're dealing with a shy person, until they get comfortable with  you, you need "a hook" to keep the conversation going.<br>  <br>  That means:  next time he sends you a text asking how you weekend was (or anything else), you answer his question.  THEN (in the same message) you ask him a question which will require him to respond.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|23s2o01jaa	My bet is he is shy. Be more forward with him. Start demanding things. He'll like that. Trust me.|`|LQfYmIWeaa	its hard to tell at this point. he could be shy. since the date was awkward he was probably really shy during the date and now feels that talking to u is going to be just as awkward. try not to make it awkward between you two.|`|4DoXXqxOaa	maybe your a little paranoid because the battery might have died try to call him for another date|`|uFT0k30Kaa	Not into you. Move on.|`|gM0pk41jaa	That's the thing about texting> if someone doesn't text back in a hurry...it makes you automatically think they're ignoring you or somethings not right. Best way to avoid such insecurities is to actually verbally communicate more so you can see whats really going on with this whole concept of y'all talking. And yes...him being shy could be a big reason why he's not effectively communicating with you....maybe he doesn't know what to say or maybe he's embarrassed by the date being crappy. Who knows. Only way to g et past such a setback is to be more open and talk verbally like on the phone or in person. How often do you see him?|`|AA11573916	probally nothing,or it could be what the text consisted.when u 1st meet a guy u cant be on his tailfeather like white on rice let the relationship grow. did u give him some on 1st date if so at could b it your 2 easy. if not sit back and chill.|`|IVcxIDXZaa	just let it go till tomorro (pendin that he doesnt txt you), then call him and ask what the deal is<br>  try mine<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090222172041AAJ3QAo">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|pVDxfJqwaa	i dont understand women! <br>  anyway hes probably asleep or thinking of something good to say|`|yn58CCYlaa	ask. but probly shy and hope u guys go out again|`|qIQ4tiBbaa	Oh, HAHAHA SAME exact thing is happening to me right now, I also am waiting for a text from a certain someone.<br>  <br>  We love talking to each other and we like each other but he is still a little eh- well like anyone.<br>  <br>  He always texts me good morning and things but never too much and sometimes he'll just stop in mid-convo.<br>  <br>  It's just because he doesn't want to look desperate.<br>  <br>  I do it all the time to him too XD. Even though I LOVE him to death for 11 years! I'm only 17 amazingly.<br>  <br>  We aren't dating or anything though, but he's still my sweetheart. I won't text him back tomorrow though- XD.<br>  <br>  But he is probably (really) interested.

dFHsAXDMaa	As a nurse and 39 yr old wife .... I will tell you it is probably not you. As men get older.... late twenties or so their testosterone levels start to decrease. It could be completely medical.... talk to him ask him if he is just not in the mood.... if he says yes  then tell him this is bothering you and ask him if he will go to doctors and get a simple blood test done to check testosterone levels. if it turns are his are low he can get a monthly shot to help with this  and bam you are back in business honey...... women hit sexual peak in their thirties by then men are age are past theirs lol that is the one mistake in timing God made|`|4fC6EJWfaa	That's nothing... wait till he needs a boost to help his little friend...<br>  (totally not complaining...

Communication is one area many couples have trouble in...|`|ub2Dtzn0aa	Clinically having sex 10x or less a year is the definition of a 'sexless' marriage. So your pretty close. Try to talk it out or get counseling if he's not receptive then you have some decisions to make. You can end the marriage, stay in the marriage and be miserable or stay in the marriage and do what you have to (take a lover on the side) in order to maintain yourself through the marriage. Whatever happens you two have work ahead if things are going to be fixed.|`|ygccpU2paa	No one can give you an effective answer with such a generalized question.  How long have you been together?  Is this a sudden change or was it a gradual drop in interest on his part?  How old is he?  If he's over 45, don't be shocked that his sex drive is lower now.|`|7VxNpWepaa	I would speak to him if i where you. communication is the key in a relationship.

I know the feeling about making appointments or schedulaing time with each other.  What I do with mine is that since he comes home late, we schedual time for us on the weekends, where we do a movie night at least 2 days.  I would try & make him make the time.  If he doesn't it will forever bother you.Tell him to make the time, so you don't have to say we have to do it on this day only.|`|GQ5Srj7Daa	You should rent the movie Fire Proof.

I would throw some Vicks vapor rub in the humidifier and some on his chest, give him some Nyquil and let him sleep it out.   Men are babies when they're sick anyways, so it's best to let him rest as much as you can and just leave him be unless he asks for something.|`|4fC6EJWfaa	Let him sleep and take some tylenol or something, seriously you don't know what is wrong with him? he has a sinus cold.|`|3bAd5B4Gaa	Sounds like some sort of flu.

RyYumX0Aaa	It's different for every woman.<br>  <br>  Some don't like anything too strange, the normal missionary and gentle behavior.<br>  <br>  Some will like being more dominant than the man, being quite forceful so will enjoy a more submissive man.<br>  <br>  I, on the other hand have always been expected to take the lead, so when my current boyfriend took over for the first time it was WOW.

zdu3gh8jaa	Hi there <br>  I think you would need to discuss this with a solicitor. They would be the best to give you the correct advice on this and often do free consultancy evenings. This would be my first stop, although I really don't think there would be much that you can do if the property is already in you brother's name unless you could buy him out somehow. Good luck, I hope everything turns out well and that the property does turn out to be safe from becoming  funds for the breweries.
VecVZ15naa	Tell him.<br>  Tell him now.<br>  If you don't tell him now, he'll feel like you lied to him when he finds out. And believe me, he WILL find out. His brother will have all sorts of things to say about you. They might be good they might be bad, but big brother will have things to say.<br>  You don't need to give him the gory details, but he should know that you were "intimate" with his brother.<br>  Good Luck.|`|MK5Ddtiiaa	NOOOOOOOOOOOO!|`|dPULl5hjaa	Yes, tell him because you'll feel uneasy with him!|`|GhsqaXsdaa	Wait in till you get more close relationship wise. Then tell him you want to have a special 'truth dinner' where you tell each other the truth about things. It sounds corny but it works.|`|mefxIQP9aa	Just keep in mind that his brother can tell him anytime.<br>  <br>  If he asks you, just answer the question but now is not the time.|`|J3JClsuQaa	I think so, he might not like it, but he will understand... Tell it to him just like you've written here.  It's better to let it out.  Good luck : )|`|lFzXZQQDaa	absolutely. if he still likes you, then you'll know it's real and he really likes you for you.|`|6C24kJhaaa	"...because sometimes the truth inst good enough, sometimes people deserve to have their faith rewarded."-  The Dark Knight.<br>  <br>  basically no, live with it. if it ruined everything then put it behind you but if you loved it then you cant face him thats final.|`|82tgfHzqaa	Tell him. If you don't because you think it's "in the past" then that's unfair to him. If you want to get in a relationship with him, then he should know about you and his brother.|`|zwdGBrUZaa	i say you tell him before he finds out the hard way<br>  and if he gets mad<br>  tell him that was in the past, and you wanted to tell him before he found out another way that wasnt from you|`|yzwbsLAYaa	Well it is in the past but then again if he finds out somehow another way or time then he will be extremely hurt that you never told him right? All i learned is...secrets ruin a relationship.|`|2RPtsrQGaa	if it is bothering u i would tell him its better to be honest and hear from u and not his brother|`|3FjDT8yKaa	no, that was the past it doesnt matter all that much. in my opinion|`|Q1f5n8mNaa	Yeah... honesty is key.. if he dont like it?? oh well move on!|`|xzX3NSUjaa	He might already know but hasn't said anything. How do you know his brother didn't tell him?? Anyway, if you know for sure, don't say anything. Even though it's his brother, your past sexual partners are none of his business. Women always ruin a good thing by saying something they shouldn't. Don't do it!!|`|OEWDXFDeaa	I would tell him incase you guys get really serious. He might be really mad if he found out and you didn't tell him up front. He won't be as mad if you tell him now, believe me. Good luck =]|`|wkR7ifp6aa	Well, if you want to loose him...tell or otherwise keep it secret, no matter his bro with tell him or not, you should keep silent :)|`|blcBYvbNaa	ohh yes honey you should it might be the past but we are talking about his brother not just some random guy ....tell him before you guys even do something cause you dont want to play with him now or do you??|`|E6kJE2x2aa	I would wait till time goes by and see how it goes
rtcubrgtaa	just tell him to meet you somewhere in person and when you meet just say that you think its your time to break up and that its better off that you two should see other people and see whatelse is out there. everyone expieriences a break-up and there rele isnt any "nice" way of doing it. you just need to do what you gotta do yah no?|`|c630401eb9baa68dddde8641339b6a29aa	There isn't a nice way to break up with someone. Be straightforward and honest, don't say anything cliched and unhelpful like "it's not you, it's me" or "I still want to be friends." At the same time, don't be brutal and hurt his feelings more than you need to. If I were you I would probably say that I felt like the spark was gone and I didn't think the relationship was going as well as it should. Gentle but firm.
VZVGXRyraa	He might not consider it flirting. Flirting is open to interpretation, it's definition is different for everyone who asks.<br>  <br>  Touching you back and shoulder is what you consider flirting? By that definition, i flirt with every girl i come in contact with. Not at all. He's not flirting with you, you're reading too much into innocent actions. Leave the guy alone. If he starts touching your legs or stomach or neck or something, i can see flirting an harassment, but not just him touching your back and shoulder.|`|PLtU5AuYaa	What the hell?????<br>  <br>  How old are you?|`|e2a22fdeb8cf92a53082a8ba944d5d0aaa	Tell him "Don't stand. Don't stand so close to you!"|`|iB27Flhvaa	Dont say anything if he's your teacher unless he pushes it too far<br>  Then, if he does.... you can hold it against him.<br>  He wont want people to find out, so he will likely favor you.<br>  <br>  Its the wrong thing to do morally, but hey.<br>  It gets you ahead in life.<br>  <br>  Just be sure he's actually interested before you tell him off, if you decide to tell him your uncomfotable with it|`|99852dc6e52dbae6a6364e1caac2b8c7aa	wow.<br>  don't flatter yourself.<br>  if there's a teacher that's kinda cute, as you say, he won't waste his time flirting with a little undeveloped girl like you.<br>  You're just overreacting and trying to make yourself feel desirable.|`|yv3hBhbGaa	thats not right at all. i even think its illigal for a teacher to be involved like that with his or her student you should tell a parents or the principal or an adult you can trust.|`|xvUUdfxhaa	The question is - do you like him enough to want him to continue and not get a huge payout from the school for emotional distress?<br>  <br>  Just go to someone higher up, start bawling your eyes out and say you can't keep it a secret anymore, he's touching you, you don't know what he means by it but you are worried for your grades etc.<br>  <br>  at the very least they'll give you a's in everything because you can say you were stressed all the time.<br>  <br>  be careful the teacher isn't just someone who doesn't understand boundaries and such - because an allegation like that can ruin a person's life.|`|vG7fljVzaa	That's sexual harassment.

What is the definition of a "good life" ?<br>  Ask her too (bcos you love her so much). <br>  If both of your answers are something like these ; have our own house, with a swimming pool, with lots of kids, no financial burden....etc. All of these need $ to make it happen. Be more practical. Financial problem is always a main reason for many couples to divorce.|`|HUvcQvQYaa	It's stupid to get married in general. All it does is destroy relationships and create a financial mess.|`|8nLuyDmPaa	it does not sound like you are ready for a serious relationship, let alone a marriage.  What's the hurry?  Live a little..|`|AA11449112	i think its better for you to get married when you both are stable.  <br>  <br>  Marriage is a great thing but not if you are not ready.<br>  Get your life straighten out first before taking the plunge. its a big responsibility.  your girlfriend should understand.<br>  <br>  sometimes its financially draining - but some get through it.<br>  <br>  you wanna be independent. you wanna find a job. you pay off your debt and college loan. you have a long way.  <br>  <br>  work hard and you'll be ready in no time|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	Sorry but its even stupid to start thinking like this. You cant even support yourself so how in the h.ll are you going to support a wife?  Better get your feet on the ground and something going before thinking like this again. Good luck|`|AA10042617	I don't know if I would call it Stupid.  That's a pretty harsh word.<br>  <br>  You may want to take care of Business and finish school.

wMWfCjBpaa	Yes they do, sample dresses anyways. Around March and November you can find the samples in bridal salons and they're marked on sale for a super low price. I just started selling sample dresses and am buying them from bridal salons on ebay for $200 or less. Maggie Sottero is a popular designer and you can find them everywhere. Sample dresses at bridal salons are around 50% or more off. The dresses while in season don't go on sale unless it's a trunk show. There are other good deals online from brides that have already worn their non-sample dress or for some reason no longer need it and it's still new. You'll still get a good deal. It's worth it!|`|76nTvO4iaa	Wedding dress prices are set by the individual shops who carry them, not by Maggie Sottero.<br>  <br>  Check with the shops in your area who carry Maggie Sottero and ask to be put on their e-mail list.  That way if they have sales or promotions, you'll know about them.<br>  <br>  As for discontinued styles, check with a shop who carries the line and ask them if they can contact the manufacturer and see what the chance is of the style  you want being discontinued in the next year.|`|4ec7418aca20a0d4c9b979bf6a9d4d4eaa	I'm a bridal consultant in a bridal shop, and while we don't discount our dresses (unless they're discontinued by the designer) we do negotiate.  Most brides aren't aware of this, but there is some room for negotiation in the price of the gown.  It's completely dependent upon the shop as well, but our owner will cut a price if that's what it will take to get the sale.  If a bride leaves our store saying "I'll think about it," she rarely comes back, and we know it.  But if we can get you to buy your dress, then we've made that sale.  Some owners are more willing to do what it takes to get that sale than others.  Or, if we can't lower the price any, we'll throw in a veil for free, or a pair of shoes, or a simple bustle.  <br>  <br>  On a Maggie dress, if it's less than 3 years old, it's not going to be discontinued this year.  But there are some of her "older" gowns which are very classic, and they've been around for several years, and they aren't going to be discontinued anytime soon either.  Basically, as long as a style is selling, it's not going to be discontinued.<br>  <br>  Also, some stores will offer a discount on a designer's line if they have what's called a "trunk show" in their store.  That's when the designer or a representative brings in the entire line to a store, and you're able to try them all on.  If there's a designer you've got your heart set on, then check the designer's website to see if there's a trunk show in your area anytime soon.  Our store will typically offer between 10-15% off our cost if you order during a trunk show, so it's worth checking out.  <br>  <br>  Also, you say you've got over a year, don't put off buying your dress too long.  I'd suggest about 9 months before your wedding is the latest you should wait.  The sooner you order your dress, the more flexibility you have in what you can order.  I've had dresses take up to 9 months to come in, and remember after that, you still usually have to get some alterations done, and I tell my brides to allow 2-3 months for that.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|EJSdI25Naa	You can learn sewing and make your own, perfect dress.
2LmfQUbKaa	first you should be first but i also have gone threw the same thing with my mom men come first and sorry to say hun but until your dad gets his blinders removed she will be there! and as for him getting mad bc you don't talk to her maybe you should wait till you and he are alone and have a heart to heart don't get mad or upset just calmly and naturally tell him how you feel you want him to be happy and you want to be happy if you cant talk to him writ him a letter just don't attack the girl friend i learned that the hard way he will defend her to the end! but at the same time don't back down from her but don't argue and yell show her you are not a child! you are here to stay! just got to go about it the smart way not with anger!|`|UOSrSEqHaa	Become a hooker. Pay's good.|`|UZMgkciiaa	hey, just a little note for you. dad loves you very much and will always will love you. keep talking to your dad about this and sooner than later he will realize what needs to take place. you never know if you let your guard down she will take advantage of the whole thing.so stay with dad and keep taking her punches sooner or later gf will get tired and might leave.

Who's to say that you two are anything more than roomies?<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|JMieQrgXaa	If you are living with someone new you might as well kiss your  Alimony good bye.

1235333b4f34f1147fc81bf4aef8885baa	Technically, you have to be 18 but there are some exceptions.<br>  <br>  If your parents don't object and you have somewhere to stay, you should be fine to move out.  However, you will not be able to sign a lease or other binding contract until you're 18.  Your parents will remain legally responsible for you until your birthday.<br>  <br>  Another exception would be if you were to attend university early.  I turned 18 during midterms in my first semester at college.  My parents signed my dorm contract for me.|`|iQ13PoEiaa	if they cosign the lease to the place you want to move. or if they emancipate you.|`|yUIODXRzaa	u can legally move out whenever u want i think...<br>  <br>  i moved into my sisters house and im 13..|`|ed9c52fcc32bc21499c8007eec999f5faa	Graduating high school does not emancipate a minor, therefore, you can't move out without their permission.|`|1lfgh3KPaa	Lmfao! That's hilarious! Dude you should totally do that and then tell your mom about it
hjzH1lFmaa	hell yeah its dangerous!|`|NDoyhCZYaa	YES THATS DANGEROUS WTF|`|Jy69Dn9Maa	Yes this is indeed dangerous, she could get an infection, its her body. But infection are not fun to have so you might wwant to warn her, umm not sure what else she could do possibly do it in the shower. I have no idea never knew it had to be that excitting.|`|MJyM1XWJaa	Yes that is dangerous, you really shouldn't shove things there that are so dirty. Eggs aren't clean, that's why you toss the shell and rinse the egg. Plus the shells IF he does crack it what if a piece is stuck in there? What a strange ER situation...<br>  <br>  He should stop watching hentai and get a life. He has a gf and he needs to treat her well and stop watching freakish thingsi n cartoon form, that just feeds the wrong kind of thing.|`|AX13vUJeaa	What the hell? <br>  That's insane and stupid. <br>  Her boyfriend is a stupid mother ******,<br>  and the hell, he watches hentai. <br>  Man, I'm suprised your sister is dating him :P<br>  <br>  - Sorry for the profane language but im extreamly worried.|`|MsMrJgAVaa	i think so|`|4dXcZhuTaa	roll play ?|`|ouEdGHfuaa	your sister's boyfriend needs help not your sister! And how old is she and her boyfriend? Don't try things you see on the TV especially anything that is Hentai. Those things are messed up most of the time. If your sister is old enough to experience these sorts of things then I would suggest going to your local bookstore and rummage through the Sex & Relationship section for some ideas. You would be surprised.|`|3dzuYTC5aa	Yeah chain her to the bed less lielt for her to get killed..... thinka bout that sharp egg shells.... if she ever wants to have kids in her life I wouldnt recommend it..<br>  <br>  I m sure this question is bs but still... if anyones stupid enough to try it realize your gonna have blood and probably some major injeries.|`|kWKZoQogaa	Yes, that's EXTREMELY dangerous. Why don't you suggest they find some sort of small, squishy sex toy that is inserted into the vagina, and have him do that with the toy?|`|4Qx8lGs0aa	Actually this is EXTREMELY dangerous considering the broken egg pieces can cut her inside and the exchange of blood can lead to an STD stuff.|`|8KrMSB8Eaa	thats disgusting...|`|KQ5oDtVyaa	I think that is very unsafe and something crazy. Tell her dont do that sh**.|`|WK1N1Kxkaa	hes a ******* weirdo|`|AA11739944	"not he wants to do that with her..."?<br>  well raw eggs have salmonella and that's not something anyone would want inside them. And if someone wanted to do that to me...i'd walk away and not speak to them. That's hella weird.<br>  Oh and egg shells are really sharp and will cut.|`|WncWwo3Faa	Another dumb question, but JUST IN CASE, don't do it!<br>  <br>  The risk of raw eggs containing salmonella is too high. Also cracked egg shells in a place like that? That's an infection waiting to happen!<br>  <br>  Common sense is needed here. A bad experience is a hard lesson learned. Explain this to the doctor a week later when problems are out of hand and medical attention is needed.|`|2LmfQUbKaa	as a woman first of all she should think about safty for her self dont do it for him and if she does want to try somthing like that go to a sex store they have all kind of safe things they can use! but with everything be careful never put from front to back and so on! it isnt safe!|`|ItRr3x51aa	Thats is not good, because that will make the eggshell particles break and scratch her, and could cut her. That guy is crazy, and, unless he was just joking, she needs to dump him ASAP!<br>  Good Luck!|`|KiJTKVDAaa	Ok so its your sister... not you she can have do what ever sexual activity to what ever extreme she likes aslong as its not a pedo.|`|DROjvDKlaa	thats dangerous.. the egg shell.. there.. yeah. thats dangerous.|`|7BG6eM7zaa	She needs to get another boyfriend. Someone who respects her.|`|DXotNZ9eaa	Get her off all Hatai and Anime, They stink, But i guess you would know what she likes besides us. So you decide|`|MPfj42xDaa	There are so many risks ew|`|iMNPH9I7aa	HENTAI IS A CARTOON!

hrU14wMDaa	There is no way in the world I would allow my child to do it. I would instead allow my 17 yr old to fly to visit a relative.|`|0056ba0f2ca4852a4f7b389766f314d4aa	Hell no. I would put them on a plane where I know they would get on and then have the relative waiting there to pick them up. But no way would I let them ride the bus.|`|1235333b4f34f1147fc81bf4aef8885baa	Absolutely not.<br>  <br>  Bus depots usually attract the lowest classes of people.  I'm not saying that everyone riding a cross country bus is shady, but the proportion is higher than via other methods of travel.<br>  <br>  I would put a kid on a plane to let them go to Detroit.  If cost was the issue, I would work something out so that say, for instance, the child paid the equivalent of the bus fare and I came up with the rest.|`|mrysAOpGaa	I was 17 when I took a greyhound from pennsylvania to south carolina ( about a 22 hour bus ride ) by myself.  My parents hated it but i went to see my long time boyfriend graduate from bootcamp because even his parents didnt go, i wanted to be there for him so he knew someone was there for him and proud of him.  I paid for the trip myself with help from my ( now husband ) boyfriend.  Theyre were worried sick about me and didnt want me to go but they let me knowing how important it was to me.  This was 6 years ago, so im still  alive.  They made me take mase with me incase i needed it.  Its up to you mama..but i think she will be ok:)|`|b99c02d2efcaf0924dc72f729d7ae118aa	Hell No!! That's crazy!
hrU14wMDaa	I would talk to him about how important it is to tell your parents because your uncle may still be hitting other kids and they are too scared to tell anyone.

KSK22vHUaa	No, it wouldn't be wrong at all.  He is cheating on you emotionally if not physically.  There is no sense in talking to exes once you have committed yourself to another person.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately she's got you in a tough spot.  You tell him to stop all contact, and he goes complaining to her saying "my wife is MAKING me do this" and she does the whole "I would never do that!" thing.  She might have been pumping him full of stuff like you're overly jealous or something.  <br>  <br>  There is no sense in keeping someone in your life who is going to make you doubt your life-partner.  She needs to leave.|`|efDvTjJSaa	i agree he definantly should not talk to her and the fact that he is being deceptive about it makes it even more so<br>  he married you<br>  not her<br>  tell him to leave the past where it is or there wont be a future between you|`|iD4ejChZaa	sounds like he married the rebound girl, this is serious, he has to chose you or her, because getting married doesn't seem to do it for him.|`|q7GBzr6yaa	No ask him too.

By asking him to stop you are giving him a reason to resent you and this will only make any problems in your relationship worse. Maybe he's hiding it because he didn't want to hurt your feelings or he really doesn't know what he wants right now. Just make it clear to him that you are aware of what is going on. You can even (conveniently and maybe jokingly) bring up all the reasons he has told you that their relationship ended and didn't work out. However , if he is or is going to do something worse none of this will make a difference anyway|`|IvMPh09baa	i believe you have every right to ask him to stop contacting her.<br>  <br>  trust me honey, if there was nothing to hide then he would be hiding nothing.<br>  <br>  go with your instinct here, this is why we have them.  something smells fishy and you need to get crap out where it doesn't belong.  tell this woman and your husband, if they want to stay in contact then you will be leaving.|`|LC8iYnncaa	unless they have kids together. but if no kids, yes you should be upset, he has not reason at all to be talking to her.

hKss8M9Raa	Borrow, borrow, borrow! Renting chairs can get expensive. The cheap ones still run about $1.50 each plus a security deposit and drop-off/pick up fees. Needing so few chairs though, is there anywhere you could borrow them from? I'm borrowing some from my church. What about shade? Is it hot in May where you live? Will the guests be allowed inside to cool off? You will also need a way to set the food out as well as a way for your guests to be able to eat it without spilling/ dropping things, so you will most likely need some tables too.

tAsuZQBeaa	My solution is to tell her.What i mean by dat is u need to go up to her tell her dat she cannot go up to u and your friends bringing up some drama for no reason because she is being just childish and she needs to grow up.Because if u just sit down and let this continue than shes gonna think its ok to do this when its not ok.it just like u going up to her breaking her relationship up with your ex and her friends.but if it does not work than u should talk ot your ex about her.And if that doesn't work than she just needs revenge cause shes asking for it to me.but really u need to tell her to cut it out stop the drama,and grow up!and make her apologize  to u and ur friends and the one good friend that she made u and her not be friends anymore.so i hope my advice helps u.GOODLUCK!|`|GmghrL4Iaa	ignore ignore ignore<br>  <br>  life goes on.<br>  people like to waste time coz they hve nothing better to do<br>  <br>  <br>  btw, calling someone ''ghetto'' isnt very nice|`|cKyEX25eaa	i would get you and your friend or well ex friend and confront her so that will show who is lying and stuff but that would piss me off mabe ya should just teach her a lesson and punch her like crazy

AA10065812	???<br>  Texas Fathers for Equal Rights<br>  <a href="http://www.tferfw.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tferfw.org/</a><br>  <br>  I’ve been a Father’s Rights Advocate for 20 years.   <br>  <br>  Many think the courts are rigged against dads, but in reality, it is more about attorneys unwilling or lacking the knowledge to truly fight for the father's rights.  This is why it is important to learn how to interview and hire the right attorney.  It is also important to do as much as possible on your own and not pay the attorney to do it.  Also, learn how to make sure the judge is being balance is his decision by using Court Watch.<br>  <br>  Start keeping a daily journal of all your activities.  The most common way to prevent a father from getting his rights through the courts is a false allegation, usually sexual.  Over 60% of divorcing father are accused of child sexual abuse, of which only 4% are found to have any relevance, but there are no penalties for doing so.  A daily journal is your number one piece of evidence in court and you can even refer to it while on the stand.  <br>  <br>  Gather evidence.  Check the site below to see if it is illegal to record conversations without the other person knowing.  If your state does not have a law either way, than it defaults to the federal ruling which says one person in a conversation must know they are being recorded.  You’re that one person.  In Missouri it is specifically legal, in Kansas there is no mention either way.  If you live in two different states, and one has a law against it, than it applies when the call originates from within that state,<br>  <a href="http://www.rcfp.org/taping/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rcfp.org/taping/</a><br>  <br>  Now, you can't just record, you also have to transcribe it into the daily journal.<br>  <br>  If you want to learn how to do all this go to Dads House in Yahoo Groups.  There's an educational manual in the file section that can teach you what you need to know.

jPJ9MTCwaa	I'm from Idaho too!  My fiance's sister went to Whistler up in British Columbia and LOVED it.  Said it was nice and quiet and quaint.  The Willamette Valley over in Oregon is lovely and with all the vineyards has some really cute bed and breakfasts as well as lovely vineyards to visit and fun wine tasting.  The Oregon Coast is of course amazing.  If you want to stick in the area, McCall is a no brainer.  I've heard a lot of great things about the Coeur D'Alene resort as well.  I love the downtown area as well.  Two of my good friends just went to a lodge in Orofino that was beautiful and a great price.|`|qL3dGTXDaa	Entrada Lodge on the way to Mt.

I know that you can get some great deals if you a) go in the off season, b) book WAY ahead or c) book at the last minute. Also, as far as money saving goes, we decided it was good because your loding, food and entertainment are all included. I'm not sure what kind of cruises are on the West Coast though. Maybe Alaska? Also, I know it can't have been too expensive because we are on a budget as well. I'm thinking that it was around $1200 or less for both of us for 5 days, 4 nights.|`|7MN532ICaa	Astoria, Oregon is nice, several movies have been made there, a lot of really nice B&B's, great views and very historical at the mouth of the Columbia River.

0LvWiESWaa	You need to start by taking responsibility for your actions. "My hand slipped" is not taking responsibility. <br>  <br>  Go to anger management classes. Get therapy. Apologize. In that order.|`|FtyLwqR5aa	No you are not right. Not everyone deserves a second chance and no bodys hand just slips. I hope she is smart enough to move forward and pick better relationships. Find a new victum and let her go.|`|ClK9W8THaa	Unfortunately there are so many people who are in abusive relationships and don't get any help .  And for you to pose such an question to help restore your relationship, i think you for that courage.  One of the first steps to restoring this is therapy , lot's of it.  You may want to brace yourself to a life long road to therapy.   Because it may not had started in that living room, kitchen or back yard.  Most of the time  physical abuse stems from our past. Being raised in families that exercise that behavior.  So staying in therapy is the very first step.  Secondly, knowing that your relationship may not resume because of what happened.  Therapy is not the answer to restoring your relationship but it can be the solution to your problem.   Time always play a major role in pain and suffering.  Allow this time to heal both hearts because so often we don't know where to turn or what to do next.  You must have patiences in this kind of healing . Because every thing is fragile right now and you don't want to do more damage before any good could come out of this. And forthly, when you can love yourself enough, except your faults and  acknowledge them .  Only then you will be able to know that you are forgiven, and that there may be a chance to restore what was once  broken .   Just take your time each day and welcome all the help that is out there for you. Because it is a sore spot for everyone and listening  plays a major part as well.  I believe that you are on the right track and i know that whatever comes out of this , in time you and her will find a common ground somewhere  that will allow you both to move on.|`|vDzvDSQ0aa	There is not point is trying to get her back sooner!  She needs time and to see that you are making positive steps in loving yourself.  It sounds as though you love this girl so much...that she may be a little scared?  You love her to dead?  What does that mean?  If you see her talking to another guy....will you get jealous?  If you give her space by not pressuring her....but letting her know the ways you are trying to improve yourself....well then you may just get that 2nd chance.  It is really upto her though so no point in pressuring her...that will only put her off.|`|iD4ejChZaa	you're so defensive, and no your hand din't slip, you're minimising it, i've been hurt by a man, i hope she finds someone else.|`|1HTRWrawaa	YOUR HAND JUST SLIPPED!!!! You have a serious problem!!!! You think just being sorry will make it go away and never happen again? WRONG!!!!! That's just it, men who hit women "love them until they are dead."<br>  <br>  Stop trying to say this is just a one time mistake that won't happen again. Get some help for your problem. See a counsellor for anger management and abuse toward women. If you don't, you will lose your temper again some day and hit her or some other woman again. Next time you might not be so lucky. Next time you might end up in jail.<br>  <br>  If it were me, you wouldn't get a second chance and you don't have a right to ask for one. If you truly love this woman, then leave her alone. Get some serious long term counselling and when you have your act together find someone else. You have put this woman through enough already.<br>  <br>  In answer to your last remark about her behavior..... YOU ARE BOTH SICK!!! Why in the world would you want to be with her? What is wrong with the both of you? Sick, sick, sick!!!|`|80zoY5OYaa	well. i was in a abusive relationship. he would hit me. i left him and he promised me he wouldnt do it any more.so i took him back and it start again, i got so mad and tired of him hitting me. when he went to sleep i beat him with a skillet til i couldnt raise the skillet anymore. i put him in ICU for 4mths. the charges was dropped cause he broke 6 ribs of mine. you cant change someone i dont care what anyone sayes. you need to get help or you will end up like my ex. she will get tired too.|`|KSK22vHUaa	Your hand didn't slip.  Don't admit something and then draw out the excuses.  You need somewhere else to let out your rage.  Take up boxing, MMA, karate, anything.  If you are having a big fight like that again and you feel that sort of urge, go outside and run.  <br>  <br>  If you'd hit me, honey, you'd have a concussion.  She's generous.|`|CGt4CKPfaa	you havent mentioned anything about going to therapy.<br>  <br>  So, no, I do not think you deserve a second chance in this situation.|`|CWVBfaPwaa	If it happened one time, I'd possibly forgive...but fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me...you'd be out the door for good.<br>  but honestly if all you ever did was fight, why do you want it to work?|`|29gHY4U6aa	It seems to me that being apart for a while is the very first step. You should both separately seek therapy. Now is not the best time to think about getting her back. You should be more concerned with getting your own life back on track. Right now there is no way for either of you to be sure this won't happen again, regardless of your intentions. If she is able to illicit strong enough emotions from you that drive you to hit her, maybe she's not the best girl for you. Take time away from her... I mean communication too... work on your own life and eventually things will fall together, with her, or with someone else.|`|BLaEQfdDaa	second chances are a gift if she is willing to give to you, alot of girl will say c later, for you both have to look at why it get so bad during a arguments to the point of hiting. if you two can control that you might have a chance. in any relationships have to learn to be honest and open about things doesnt matter what it is, maybe this could avoid fights. I wish you luck
cm7dLGQPaa	Why on earth you would want to end on good terms is beyond me.  He  is abusing you and your son is watching this.  Kids learn by example you know.  You need to contact a shelter, lawyers, move in  with parents, whatever you can do in order to get away before things get worse and your child either learns the behavior or  your husband starts taking his anger out on  the  son.  This is not  going to go away so don't delude yourself into thinking  that it will.  Good terms?  The dude would  be lucky his stuff wouldn't be on the front yard when  he got home and a restraining order would be served on him.  Don't teach your son its ok to be walked all over or that women are second  class citizens that don't count.  I know, you have no  money, etc...but guess what, the court would make sure you got child support and there are wonderful babysitters out there that would be much more healthy than a little boy watching his MaMa being  treated like trash.  Please, please leave before things get worse.  You deserve better than this...|`|CWVBfaPwaa	You're doing the right thing by wanting to get out.

But if you are really interested in your childs best interest you have to leave. It changes who he is when you argue and he sees the abuse. Its getting more serious each day as he gets older. It will not be easy to leave but you will be happier. He needs anger management classes. Call a womans shelter for advice they can be wonderful and could prob help with temp housing.<br>  Good luck and stay strong!|`|BLaEQfdDaa	there isnt any good terms, you need to check with women shelters and try to find help, this is abusive marriage that you need to get out of hate to say this but the next time he hurts you might be to late. so you need to do wha|`|9b3xkt36aa	No such thing as good terms darling.

Call a domestic violence shelter and arange shelter for u and ur baby, they have people that can plan this with u.  rememeber to call from an unknown place so ur husband wont find out.  he is an abuser and is just getting warmed up!  My husband started off yelling and  pushing me and eventually started hitting and ended up by trying to throw me infront of a car and breaking my jaw.  U have to call the police but u dont have to send him to jail.  next time he pushes u its battery so make a report and leave when he is at work.  this is when u must put ur plan in motion.  Go get a order of protection the judge can give u temp custody of the child and if needed the home meaning ur huband will be barred from the home untill arrangements r setteled in court.  He can also be ordered to pay u support.  u have options but u have to call the police.  plus its a good idea to show his patterns of abuse to the judge believe me when u get to divorce court his lawyers will say if he did all this and was so mean to u why didnt u call the police?  u need the police to know what hes doing.  plus it will help u get custody and support!|`|wW4LwEW1aa	good luck it almost never ends on good terms. i never had a child involved and it was still unpleasant even though i gave him everything and started over from scratch. good luck|`|JVYs2TCpaa	A lot of times it is other peoples short coming that make them lash out and hurt others. If he has a violent side then you make have to may have to make off like a thief in the night. Now is the time to call upon your family for help. Go on a nice trip to moms house and explain the situation. Do not water it down by any means. Tell her the truth, "your husband is an asshole" Move back in with mom and apply for public assistance until you can find a job. Get a babysitter and get over that phobia of not allowing anyone to watch your child. You cant afford that luxury, so get over it! If hubby bothers you get an order of protection.  If he begins harassing phone call, document that as well. Let him know that is it over. Also file for child support.

Wake up!!!!<br>  <br>  Find a good day care for your son, get a job, and divorce your husband. Stop making excuses for not having a job. No mother wants to hire someone to take care of her child, but we do what has to be done and what is best for our child. <br>  <br>  In your case it's better for your son to be with a baby sitter or in a day care while you are working and supporting the two of you, then for him to be home with his mom, while watching his dad beat up on her.<br>  <br>  You can't end an abusive marriage on good terms. You need to call the police and get a restraining order against your husband. It's time to get smart and do what MUST be done for you and your son. Don't put off doing it any longer. I have found with women who are in abusive relationships, the longer they put off leaving their abuser, the harder it is to do it. Finally you reach a point where he has mentally beat you down so badly you no longer have the strength to leave. You stay until he beats you so badly that you end up in the hospital with permanent injuries or in the morgue.<br>  <br>  Doesn't sound like much of a future for you or your son does it?|`|uO0NW2nZaa	call the authorities, tell your family and friends they all need to be aware and if not for you do it for son because he is priceless.

fuIUOJ2paa	Well most likely she likes Paramore. If you don't know who that is she a singer. Search the song "Misery Bussiens" and after listening to that song. Tomorrow when your at school ask her if she likes Paramore than ask her if she likes the song and keep the converstion going after that about stuff you like that she might, if you have NEVER talked to her before kinda make eye contact with her and slowly go up to her with a friend that is your friend who is friends with her, or there has to be at least ONE friend who will go up with you.

b4c080d0f4c39aa94fde4b1f35a009fbaa	The very fact this woman has converted to Islam & is no more a Hindu as per definition of Hindu as provided under section 2 of the Hindu Succession Act,1956 which provides to whom the Act is applicable. This is the basic issue about the religion of the person to whom the Hindu law applies which cannot be over looked whether the matter relates to marriage or inheritance.<br>  In a recent judgment by Supreme Court of India the marriage between a Hindu with a Christian according to Hindu form of marriage & even which was registered under the Hindu Marriage Act,1955 was held as Void abnito based on this very principle & applicability of the Hindu laws only on persons who are Hindu by religion & the term Hindu includes Sikh, Jaina,Buddhist but who is not a Muslim,Christian,Parsi or Jew.|`|WiFVIq3Iaa	he is saying truth|`|UeNCDzpBaa	Dear sir<br>  <br>  Your daughter married a Muslim, Dont worry about your property. If he is 100% muslim  he  is not going to ask about your property.  ( islam saying that  any one muslim  marry a non muslim then they converted to in islam;  Allah is giving them heaven  after death so they never expecting some thing from you)  Even though  the  Islam saying  daughters can  get from father's property only 25%"  (if you have 5 daughters the each daughter can get 5% only)  One special thing i would like to tell you that: After  Nikah (marriage) the groom have to pay  MAHER to bride some money or gold.  If  he is so poor  she can forgive.  The meher when she recieves from her husband she can use when ever where ever, the husband dosen't have rights to ask her about that money: (Now a days all mostly muslims  are following Hindu customs like  a demanding  dowry . In islam dowry is  not permitable.  )<br>  My advise to u that take it is about this marriage.<br>  <br>  Iam very sorry if i heart you. (my  english is so poor)<br>  <br>  Badar:|`|cDzQ2cQ2aa	noooo...

She has nothing that you don't have your self. It is him and be glad that he has her now cause he is going to go through life doing every female as he has done you. Keep your dignity and pride and move on. You will find Mr. right someday and don't try to rush it.|`|Y9HWim3Baa	You sound like you may be a young woman which tells me that you haven't had many relationships to pull from.As time goes on,people learn from each relationship,& each time one ends,it's emotionally devastating...But,your not stupid,& the feeling of devastation will pass,trust me.I've been there,& felt the same way.I'm now married to a man that loves me for the person & am,& the feelings I have for him are the same.Have patience & enjoy the trip of life.This quote always stays in my mind,& I want to share it with you."Life is not a destination,It's a journey"...BOL to you.|`|slJWqCI5aa	The one that will make you happy will never do this to you.

Stay strong and move on sweets! life will get better!
q34vCB3Qaa	maybe he likes you for who you are. but players aren't the type u shouldn't go after|`|8FbOtXAXaa	First just so you know, you cannot change a person. They have to do it themselves. A lot of girls think oh well I'm really nice and pretty and I will show him how to act and he will change around but that doesn't happen. If you already know that he is going to play you, why go for him? I don't really think that you want to hurt all over again.|`|70kh6VSoaa	changing him you must be young you never get with some and say that cause no matter what you do there true self will shine thought eventually

Stranger things have happened.|`|C9brWMriaa	Have you tried going to a church?
L5ie6msYaa	u are an asshole. But i bet she like it|`|YMbvOmryaa	She may never get over it. Girls feel a connection with the person they lost their virginity to. There is only one time in a girls life that she can give her virginity to a person she cares about. A girl should be very selective about doing this and  a guy should understand the emotional connection the girl needs to feel before she give herself. <br>  <br>  The best thing you can do is be firmly honest with her. Apologize that you do not feel the same connection. Gently let her know that you regret not being able to continue your relationship because you do not have the same feelings for her that she has for you. Let her know that she deserves to have someone care for her as much or more that she cares for them. Tell her you are sorry that you are not that person and wish her luck finding him.|`|2LmfQUbKaa	well you can always just be what Alot of guys don't do be a man about it! some girls can be crazy as hell but most you can sit her down and tell her i don't want to hurt you but i don't want a relationship with you it was good what we had and i have no regrets and i don't want you to either you will always hold a special place in me and i hope i will in you but i really want to be just friends if she takes it hard comfort her and tell her we can talk about any thing and you will find the right one make it about her! we women love that sh** you sound like a good guy follow your heart! good luck! gntpaula@gmail.com|`|vkogRydnaa	I understand it can be annoying, but you need to put yourself in her position. Virginity means a lot to a girl, it's like putting everything in your hands. It's her reputation. <br>  you need to try to understand her. <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|Vch9DTraaa	You sound very childish and insensitive.  It means a lot to any woman to give that very special part of herself.  I feel bad for the girl that lost a very special part of herself to someone like you.  Just remember one thing, what comes around, goes around.|`|7BG6eM7zaa	You need to tell her you did it just for the sex. Some girls feel because they lost their virginity that the boyfriend should stay with them.|`|7cbIlyMeaa	try to talk to her.|`|cIJ4xrn8aa	just be honest and let he rknow.|`|7DCvMo1Xaa	You need to talk to her.<br>  She will always remember that you were "the one." <br>  If you do not talk to her she will remember you as "the a** one" and it will always be a negative thought.<br>  Respond to her and tell exactly why you felt you needed to break up.<br>  Tell her you are sorry if she regrets losing it to you, but it was a mutual choice, one you BOTH made.|`|luMa62Psaa	idk, but it is so slutty, isnt anything sacrid anymore, i dont get it, y give urself away? i think u should save urself for the most special ppl only, otherwise ur just an easy do.|`|7d2ed527dde89c1fc1c143c96fcb64e7aa	Too late you all ready look like a conceited jerk. <br>  You can tell her that you think she is great but you have decided to play the field and focus on a job or school for now.<br>  Maybe she feels like she had more of a connection to you beyond just the virginity thing.<br>  After you face her you can block her from calling and texting you. Read your phone user manual or go online.<br>  I think you like that she calls you and would be crushed if she stops.|`|tbZNMfAsaa	First of all, not all girls are attached with and by losing their virginity.<br>  <br>  Second, just tell her that you need some space and continue to ignore her calls. Since you are so eager to get her to leave you alone. Eventually she should get the clue... I think that with your phone you can set it so that you don't receive her calls.|`|kWKZoQogaa	Yeah, you do have a commitment to her, in a way. Virginity is a precious thing, especially for girls. And you took it from her. I don't mean for that to sound harsh, but that's the best way to explain it so that it gets through to you. The only thing you can do is to have a very heartfelt discussion with her. And DON'T be mean about it, as it will only hurt her worse.|`|4dXcZhuTaa	tell her that she is/was important to you, you just don't feel that way for her anymore.<br>  it's an emotional experience for girls and it should be for guys too.  but for many guys it is not, clearly for you it was not emotional.. so you can have fun fixing that.|`|vj2pWs9Maa	Explain to her why you aren't together.<br>  It's not your fault really.  I kept clinging onto the guy who took my virginity, then I got over it and dumped him (he was a jerk anyway).

I mean, when you get a job is she intending to go to where you are when she's finished studying & try to get a job there too?  If she isn't intending doing that, or vice versa then it's pretty much a waste of time you 2 being together.
2gstVBcMaa	If you are meant to find someone to share your life with then you will!  Trust me there are PLENTY of single average sized adults.

Grant it we all want to have that "we met and fell in love and live happily ever after" thing. It comes to most all of us when we lease expect it to though. You are so young still and have a life ahead of you that you should be soo excited about you shouldn't be thinking of these things. You will meet some one one day and you will be happy. Until then focus on YOU, your schooling, and being happy with friends/family. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Be seeing you....|`|uTNKfpV6aa	Honestly, you may have a harder time then usual finding someone when you're a teen, but in the long run, there is someone for everyone.

uuV1ak58aa	Honestly I had to look that one up. After finding out what it is my answer is ABSOLUTELY NOT. This thing is probably more common than you think. I checked the mayo clinic since I didn't know what it meant. Anyway as far as a sex life goes with having it, making sure your partner understands the condition is crucial. Granted I realize that it may be embarrassing to reveal to a partner but if you don't feel the need to dispel it on the first date you should be fine. As far as a marriage and family raising goes I don't think it will get in the way one bit.<br>  <br>  MILDRED SENT ME HERE TO HELP YOU**<br>  <br>  pitstop83 in central Illinois|`|8nLuyDmPaa	I had to look that one up.  Such a name for something everyone has eventually, only if in a small scale.  Pubic?  Ouch..

With any luck you'll grow out of it in the years to come.<br>  Sorry about that though.  ouch.<br>  <br>  Get to a Dermatologist to see if the can get you some prescriptions for that.  There are a lot of good products out there on the market these days.<br>  <br>  The one thing that you'll want to work on if your thinking about getting some in the days to come.  Don't try and use vernacular that it over the person's head.  It won't make you look smart, it will just make them feel like your talking down to them.<br>  <br>  Good luck.
dFHsAXDMaa	one word for you <br>  <br>  COUNSELING<br>  <br>  It is the only way to fix this|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	women need to talk things out, men are creatures of action. Give him what you want in return. show him by example, not by words. give him a hug, if that's what you want from him. Since he has these issues, and I agree, he can outgrow it, it takes time and a lot of effort.<br>  <br>  you sound dangerously close to a co-dependent relationship.|`|IvMPh09baa	Welll... at least you are being honest with yourself here.  You are probably right, a childhood with abuse will definitely effect ones own ability to communicate and love fully when they grow up.  <br>  <br>  Has he gone to counseling for the abuse?|`|wE89mPZ3aa	All you can do is talk to him and maybe get some help.  He is the way he is and nothing will change him unless he wants to change.  If you are not getting what you need now then you will never get it. So you need to decide if you want to stay in the relationship or leave.  It is an awful feeling to feel as if the person you are with just does not care about your feelings so do what is best for you.|`|wpi36XBAaa	Are you even sure he can give you what you need? That what you are looking for lies within him?<br>  I am sorry, but some people are just so damaged by their past that they need a special type of person to love them. He may need someone who can give more than you can, and he may not be capable of giving you what you need from him. He may need someone who can love without receiving that in return, at least not as an empathetic partner would. <br>  This could be all he has to offer. Is that enough for you?|`|8nLuyDmPaa	I think you are telling yourself this is just not working for you...<br>  <br>  Sad as it is, some times you need to look out for yourself..|`|R4F05z4Faa	You need only bed rest|`|AA11391968	You need to ask your husband to sit down to talk.  Tell him that you are having second thoughts about the marriage because you feel your being emotionally neglected.  This will make him aware that you are not "whining."  Let him respond.  Ask him to attend therapy you so you two can learn better communication skills.  He may feel there is nothing wrong at all in his actions and you may think the same about yours.  At least try it before divorcing.|`|RVMwRuxvaa	try this. Trust me. Mine used to be Very diff. after marriage. I told him about it and he ignored my pain. So, the next morning, I packed my bags. He was begging me to stay and became a lot better. Good luck hon. Just follow your heart. Oh, and, ignore GooGoo, he is just an ashole, he can't even GET a gf.|`|1da4a2d0455c0102329b9db0565c3a34aa	You both have the same problems from what I can tell.  Move out for a week and see if he doesn't come crawling to you begging, crying and pleading for you to come back.  It will be infinitely cheaper and more effective than counseling and will show you both you need each other.|`|KSK22vHUaa	You can't save him now.  His childhood did this to him and there's no way to undo that.  If you can't deal with the way he is now, you need to leave.  You need more than he can offer, so it's time to pack.|`|pVuNxfBZaa	Please seek counseling for yourself. As you begin to change, so will he. Good luck and God bless.|`|5810e6ffd53a5af2e1a161b4d5ccf2e3aa	Watch Fireproof together.|`|pOTigVYPaa	I am so glad to answer your question.  I was married to a man just like yours for 34 years!  My former husband was extremely emotionally neglectful!  His needs always came first.  I made all kinds of excuses for him just like you.  I will tell you now that his needs will always be greater than yours and his needs will always come first because he is a Narcissist.  In his mind the world revolves around him and for him only.  You are just a means to his end which begins and ends with him.  There is nothing you can do to fix it.  I finally divorced him after a near suicide attempt on my part, and when I realized I was drinking to excess in order to stay in the relationship with him.  I was so desperate for him to love me because I loved him so and thought somehow, someway I could get him to feel the same.  Oh, he did tell me he loved me but his actions showed different.  If you are hurting, and I do believe you are, then you must do the courageous thing and that is to leave this man for good and allow the right man to come into your life and give you the love you so rightfully deserve.  When the door closes God will open a window.  I closed the door on my former husband and now have a husband who deeply loves and truly cares for me the way I had always wanted.  Give love a chance. It's waiting for you.

If your parents thought they could not trust you they would have assign you a nanny when they went away but as it is they think you could handle with this responsibility. How long did it take them to trust you, if you break this trust how long will it be before you get it back? Guys its not worth it to loose the trust your parents have found in you, go to school and in no time one of those moron who encourage you to skip school will come to you  to beg for a job.|`|BgVWSApdaa	You are not going to like this but I think your parents trust you to be responsible and as fun as it would be to climb back in bed, breaking their trust just isn't worth it.  If they know they can count on you with this, they'll be able to count on you with bigger things in the future.  Sorry!  You can always hop back in bed when you get home from school.|`|f8bd5677bcf38585dd6016bf3f2c4687aa	Call them at around 2 oclock and frantically ask what day it is.

This would show her some appreciation...Moreover, I would also try to reignite the passion without being too much obvious...|`|QlGvbjpOaa	MY FRIEND TAKE THIS AS YOUR SOLUTION.

MAYBE SHE' S JUST USING YOU FOR SOMETHING.
RXamcvhOaa	My mother is a registered dietitian and she directs a dietetic internship program at a university.  The difference between a dietitian and a nutritionist is the amount and degree of education and legality.  If you go to a dietitian you are ensured a standard of knowledge upheld by the American Dietetic Association, whereas you don't know what you are getting with a nutritionist.  Basically, read some books and get people to believe you to become a nutritionist.  Go to college and put in the time and effort to be a dietitian.  As to your question of financial security, being a dietitian is a very good, steady job.  My family was always very stable with my mother's income, but she put in a lot of hard work to get it. Good luck finding a path! Just be sure to listen to yourself, you know what you need to do.|`|S3UxNOhdaa	Go to a hospital or nursing home and talk with the registered dietician there. They can give you the best guidance on what to expect to get your degree and how much you can make afterward..and you will get to meet some people too. Good luck in your endeavour.

AA11311516	getting over getting played isnt that easy because you now have trust issues.<br>  <br>  What you need to do is learn from this.

jauEiIhfaa	oh i know what you mean, im 18 and once i started dating i was like ZOMG suddenly i started noticing little faults. but really you should chill, (yea i know its hard, most of the time i still cant) think about this: first of all if he's going to see you naked for the most part he wont care, just keep your body clean and trim your hair down there (it is your choice but to be on the safe side its best to at least keep it neat and tidy) as for your labia, it is perfectly normal!! all girls are different so you arent the only one :) as for your boobs no worries, i have the same thing going on with them lol. <br>  <br>    Just take it easy, besides if he is going to see you naked hopefully he will care enough about you not to judge you based on any "faults" he might pick out (not that you have any at all but you get what i mean)|`|ENZVi0Ptaa	No you're not a freak.<br>  <br>  Its normal to wonder if your normal. your body parts are just fine.<br>  <br>  Just relax we're all a little bit different.<br>  <br>  Don't be scared, its ok labia is fine and your nipples are not suppose to be erect all the time only when stimulated or cold. They should be flat most of the time|`|6C24kJhaaa	then tell him you arent ready for that level when it comes to it and chances are he will respect that. also dont be insecure, be grateful, think, it can always be much worse.|`|zwdGBrUZaa	well if he really loves you he wouldnt care<br>  and its not adnormal<br>  so don't worry<br>  no one is perfect<br>  we all got something|`|griwMyO6aa	Well I think you're nipples are just fine. But your labia is really long, that's weird..  I don't know if that is normal. But if you were born like that it obviously is. You should be waiting to have sex with him untill you're comfortable with him knowing these things about you weither it's weird or not.|`|GrCj35muaa	Honey, if I had those nipples, I wouldn't bother with shirts, they are PERFECT! as for the labia thing? I have never measured mine, but I assume you are refering to the labia minora, I'm sure it's fine. ask your gynecologist. and remember, No 2 vaginas look the same.|`|zO59ezH3aa	I'm a guy but that is totally nomal. It's also normal to freak out but if he truly loves you that he will still me with you and comfort you in times like these.|`|TyQsGapmaa	Your a freak, and I mean that in a good way! Long labia are the best and that nip looks great, LICK LICK!!!!!|`|RfZK3FBzaa	take a chill pill lol! everyone's different. it's normal.|`|fwLpotDNaa	You are fine, if you love each other things like that won't matter.|`|ntyeMPgOaa	I know Im not a woman, but sounds to me like you are perfect.  Don't worry about it. You're perfect the way you are.|`|0kV5H5J6aa	im sure he wont care as much as you do.|`|rwZB7bP2aa	Don't be afraid.  Every body's body is different.  Labia comes is many shades, shapes and sizes.  There is nothing to worry about. Your nipple's, nothing wrong with them either.  You are 17 year's old and still growing and maturing.  Besides,  if your boyfriend is not in love with you as a person, inside and out, than he shouldn't be your boyfriend.  If you think that he may not like you because of your "defects", than deep down inside you too know that he is not the one for you.|`|xzX3NSUjaa	Inverted nipples go in and look like someone pushed them inside you. If yours look like the ones in the pics, they are fine. You have nothing to worry about. Also, some men like when a woman has a long labia. I used to and my exes and current b/f loved to suck on it. Trust me, men aren't that picky. The things you are feeling insecure about are the things that will turn him on..not off. If you feel too self conscious, just turn the lights off when the time comes.|`|DS1cPBg5aa	You're fine.<br>  Everyone's body is a little weird!<br>  For instance, my boobs are oddly shaped and one is a half cup size bigger than the other. I'm 19.<br>  <br>  I feel really insecure around my boyfriend too.<br>  After a while, you'll feel better.<br>  I feel better around my BF because he tells me he loves my body, and not in a weird or I-want-in-your-pants way. He's accepting and understanding.|`|8Og0VL4saa	When a man is interested in a woman it really doesn't matter what she got or what she looks like.  from personal experience, cause I'm fat and i have cellulite all over my thighs and legs and my breast are so heavy gravity has started pulling them down and it hasn't been a limitation in finding someone.|`|8e68db638657753020205e0a1ca747ceaa	Sweetie, I feel for you. It's not easy trying to figure guys out. But trust me, he's not gonna care that much. As girls, we place more heartache on ourselves than we should. He's a guy. You're a girl. So, that in itself will be good enough for him. You've already done the hard part and got a commitment out of him. Relax, and be yourself. He'll love anything "extra" that comes along with the relationship. No matter what it look like.|`|1b319cddc9af18158ac9801a9d1a12edaa	You are completely normal. Just calm down, and everything will be fine. Everyone goes through this! And everyone is different. Your nipples are just fine and normal looking, and everyone's vagina is slightly different also.|`|OEWDXFDeaa	Stop worrying about it. Everyone is different, it should not matter if you care about him enough. You should be comfortable and not worry about it.|`|PRlCQh0zaa	you aren't a freak. alot of girls your age go through the same thing.. in fact some of m friends go through this.. no they didn't show me their nipples. lol. they just tell me their problems.|`|4fC6EJWfaa	if you "just got a boy friend" you shouldn't be worrying about sex right now, tell him you're a virgin and you want to wait awhile, then when he seems to have given up on the fact that he'll ever get any surprise him, live in the moment, WHEN you are ready!|`|rAAHHYEWaa	no you are good im over Weight and for the longest time i would tell my bf not to look at me during sex and the more we did it the more comfortable i got and now i dont really care if he likes you and you like him things like that dont matter and the nipples are normal
YseYDxxaaa	I am so sorry that you are going through this. It is painful when a parent does not accept you.<br>  <br>  I think you should talk to your dad, tell him that you notice his distance from you and point blank ask him if your weight is the issue. If he answers you honestly, tell him that you want to change but weather you do or not, you need his love, acceptance and support no matter what you look like.<br>  <br>  Actively seek the resources to loose weight and remember that you are a worthwhile person no matter what, and I hope your father sees this and knows that his changed feelings make a difference to you. <br>  <br>  Best of luck to you.|`|SZ9TJvVaaa	Im sorry, but there isn't much I can say. maybe you could start small, with walking twice a day or something. :( that would hurt me too.|`|M5oMYc9Laa	I feel your pain.  I was an overweight as a teen and still am as an adult.  My father used to tell me I was a G.D. disgrace and that nobody wants a fat a**ed woman.  It was TERRIBLE.  I ended up with very bad self-esteem and  needed years and years of counseling.  Clearly,  you will need need some too.  Your father is the one with the real problem.  Tell him that all you want is love and acceptance no matter what size you are and a good parent will give you nothing less.  When people have eating disorders and are treated shabbily for it all it tends to do is make them eat even more.<br>  <br>  Good luck and GOD bless.|`|93r3nCM1aa	My mom is the same way. I'm overweight, and although my mom doesn't come outright and say "you're fat" I can see it in her eyes, and she subtly makes it known. Whenever my husband and I go out to dinner with them, she'll say something like "oh...you're getting that?"<br>  <br>  When I got married, she actually went up to my fiance and said "make sure she takes a walk around the block everyday so she'll look better for the wedding."<br>  <br>  Just start losing weight on your own and ignore what your dad thinks of you. Once you've lost 5 pounds or so, say "dad! I lost 5 lbs!" Maybe he will change when he sees you working|`|lXpGlAm3aa	That's so messed up!!! Just shock him and tell him what you said here."You are ashamed of me,because I'm overweight!" "You never speak about me,you are embarrassed to take me out into the public eye".<br>  <br>  <br>  Thats so sad,all you can do is tell him that.Also I think he is missing out on a wonderful relationship with you.Just explain to him that you love him........|`|fAlFgx6Zaa	Hi (:<br>  The best way to deal with this is by confronting him about it.<br>  Tell him how you feel, and ask if that's really what's happening.<br>  Look him dead in the eye and you can tell if he's lying or not.<br>  If your dad is ashamed, you're right.<br>  He should love you for who you are, not what you look like. <br>  Good luck!|`|AA11032586	First of all, you are a Princess! You are one of Gods children. He fearfully and wonderfully made you in his image and he does NOT make any junk! Secondly, you need to sit down with your Dad and let him know how you feel. Turn the tables on him. Ask him out on a date. Go get ice cream or coffee somewhere. Maybe go eat out. Just have fun. Good luck. Have a great time. God Bless.|`|JnH9X34Taa	I'm so sorry that you have to go through something like that. He should love you regardless of your appearance. Hes NOT a good father. A good father is someone who loves his child no matter what.<br>  It's not you.. It's your dad. No one deserves to feel unloved.
NqbBjS0raa	It sounds like you did the best you can do to protect yourself and the boys need a better male role-model than their father. He certainly dropped a peg in responsibility and respect for the family that he helped form. I hope you heed the listening post of some organizations to help you, and any friends or family to support your life. I think the husband you selected for the long term seems less likely to rise to any potential you hope will happen, and more like someone who can only handle simple tasks because he is too busy with the bottle. I think all your expectations of a future life to continue with him has to be underscored with his failings. You do need to relax knowing your choices has to more than trying to salvage his life. Your sons need to be in a safety net with the protection they won't be subjected to another drunken ride with their father........|`|sCCjAKllaa	I feel bad for you. You seem like a really nice person, and you definitely don't deserve this. I understand how women usually want to make the best of things, and somehow make the guy change, but you really can't. The feelings you're receiving in your heart are all natural, but you cannot have him there with you. There's a reason why he isn't there right now, and you don't want to go back on that, even if you do feel like you need him with you at this point.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, the good version isn't always there. That's another thing that you have to understand. He is who he is, and if he was so focused on you being happy and not givin you any grief, there would be no special version; it would just be him and only him. I understand why you feel the way you do, but at the end of the day, you have to understand that his good side is too limited, which won't help you with anything at this point.<br>  <br>  I really hope things go well for you. I hate to hear about women being abused in any kind of way, because I feel as though no women deserves that kind of treatment. I think you'll end up doing well, but you have to be strong for not only yourself, but your two kids. They need their mommy to be strong, and I know you won't let them down. Please be well.|`|Hd7tFHN7aa	1-800-273-talk  this is a emotional crisis line.<br>  <br>  also you could try getting both yourself and him some help with dealing with abuse and drinking.<br>  <br>  Divorce is hard on everyone and sometimes has to happen.  But I feel it should be after trying to get things fixed myself.<br>  <br>  Please remember your boys, and don't fight in front of the boys or say bad things about their father to anyone.  They will hear it and it will hurt them and you in the long run.<br>  <br>  good luck with this,<br>  John|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	Unfortunately no. What has happened to you is not your fault and you must keep remembering what he did to you and tht that could happen to your kids as well. Leaving someone is never easy but then living with what youre enduring is even harder. You should be able to contact a local womans help group (yellow pages)  that will help you out thru this. Also remember that he will probably only get worse and you dont want this to happen to your boys at all. You have to be srong for your boys and there will be better times ahead for the three of you so what youre feeling is quite normal and only temporary. Youre probably scaed right now not knowing what to do or whats going to happen but the womens help group will help you thru all this and each day with the help of God, things will get better each and everyday and once this all is over, youll start feeling better knowing that you dont have to live in constant fear for your life or your boys. Good luck|`|o52eF5cKaa	I am going the same like you . I live in Canada and there 's lots ppls you can talk to ( even 24/7) . Haven house , Crisis line , Victim service ...

If you need a friend to talk to , email me  islander27@yahoo.com|`|uuV1ak58aa	I agree with your decisions on how to handle the situation. Just by the sound of it, he may have a drinking problem. The fact that this was displayed in front of you kids makes me very upset. I think that going ahead with the divorce is the proper direction. This will give him the jolt he needs to think about his actions. If he does not choose to think about his ways and figure ways to change them you are better off anyway. I have seen many cases, many of them friends, where the divorce was not permanent. It opened the eyes of the guilty party and changed the way they looked at life.<br>  <br>  MILDRED SENT ME HERE TO HELP YOU**<br>  <br>  pitstop83 in central illinois
0DdSoi4Maa	You're never going to get over someone you love.  Every relationship you have with someone you're going to miss those good times.  You just have to wait it out & hope she comes back around.  I have a cousin I love dearly who was my best friend & she's all caught up in her bf & she's different to me.  But I know one day she'll come back & I'll be here for her b/c I love & know the true her.  I miss a lot of my friends but it's part of life & you just have to learn how to deal with it & do what makes you happy.|`|l4obBXIpaa	same problem bro...|`|chfILbonaa	Jennelle is right it will take time also you will feel withdrawal it hurts alot this has happened to me alot so im immune to it just find another friend|`|A4SU14Wwaa	Its really hard when friends aren't long friends anymore with each other.

I didn't go out with him but she just didn't want to be my friend|`|DVRSCYU1aa	so go and say her ,when u knw dat she is ur friend ,let her know abt dis ,bt before saying dis find wether she luvs u or no ...or else u may loose the friendship,coz its tough to face each other after dis situation.|`|8m5oDRxKaa	honestly... time.<br>  and space.<br>  dont block them out completely, cause then its like a sense of withdrawal.<br>  but basically its just time, and realization.|`|wlzb0JjUaa	Mind over matter, it's easier said than done, but think of why you and this person aren't friends anymore. Rethink the things that person might have done to you, for you and them to discontinue holding a friendship. I am going through the same thing, so believe me, as alone as you feel right now, you aren't the only one.Yeah it hurts to look back even when you are completly over, but once that is over with,you can look back and    be happy of the good times you and that person did have.Maybe that person did you wrong, and you don't need people like that in your life. Or maybe you did wrong to them, and maybe they pushed you away, and sometimes its always just to learn a lesson. Then again i don't know the situation, but time soothes away all wounds.|`|EGDVNCxQaa	well when i get out of a relationship i was totally commited to i listen to music<br>  <br>  it helps me alot

So if they can't see them and touch them in public it becomes sexual. I also think some guys think you like it or something.

However, it's my understanding that if you are married, or have joint custody, it is considered kidnapping if she doesn't have your permission.  I've also heard that if you're married then neither one of you needs permission from the other to take the child.  <br>  <br>  So, ditto on talking to a lawyer.  If you are worried about this happening, go to a lawyer or your local Human Services or Child Welfare department for the legalities pertaining to your specific state and county.  Good luck.|`|OQF1HlwRaa	if she has custody yes..<br>  but if she's really leaving with your child you should probably call a lawyer and not ask us on Y!A :]|`|q7GBzr6yaa	If she has custudy she can!
e8d3b3207846607c507e3dc6eaca10edaa	''DoAble'' is kind of in the middle.

6oZcHIjiaa	He is a guy. He sounds like he doesnt want to get too close to anyone. Like he may have some trust issue. But I wouldnt read into anything. Right now, he only sees you as a girl friend. That is why he is comfortable telling you the way he sees and feel things, even though you may not feel the same way. Hope that made sense.|`|e8d3b3207846607c507e3dc6eaca10edaa	He is a normal guy.  This is what guys are like.  He has no problem.<br>  <br>  Guys don't show affection or feelings much.|`|4bd6769f9391604a128cb5de3e4b5085aa	In regards to all these questions I have come to 2 conclusions:<br>  <br>  1. This guy is not that interested in you. If he thought you were attractive, you would've been his top prospect at some point over the last three years. So he either doesn't think you're hot, or he's such a bad @$$ that he can get the hottest girls around and you're just not one of them (which is a distinction that doesn't result in any different effect on you). I know it's hard to hear, but it's just a cold hard fact. The sooner you move on the happier you'll be. Don't believe me, ask this question: "If you've been close friends with a guy for 3 years and he never made a move, is there any chance he still will?" Most people will admit the truth... no.<br>  <br>  2. Your infatuation and obsessive behavior towards this guy is unhealthy. Perhaps it's somewhat magnified by you expressing your extreme desires to be w/ him solely over Yahoo. But nevertheless, if you haven't made any headway toward turning things romantic and sexual over three years, then why are you still obsessing about this?? You're either a little bit off your rocker or just gutless beyond all belief. I doubt he's interested after THREE years, and it seems you should've realized this too by now and moved on.<br>  <br>  What is abundantly clear to me, having been your contact for a whole 2 days is that being "best friends" with this guy is not satisfying your needs. In fact, you are less happy being so close as the friend but not getting to the next step. My advice is that the next time you're hanging out with him, just give him a "hug" and then start kissing him passionately. I know, he has a girlfriend and will probably not bite. But lady, he ain't gonna go for you anyway. Your best to just pour your heart out to him, let him know what you want and need out of the relationship and he can either express that, or reject you, thus allowing you to move on w/ your life.<br>  <br>  This will probably make you think I am mean, harsh, (wrong), maybe a jerk. It's never easy to accept that not everyone loves you, but sometimes you just need a cold dose of reality. You're torturing yourself just sitting back, being the good friend, and hoping this guy, who sounds completely ignorant of your feeling, btw, just magically wakes up one day and sees you as his sleeping beauty.|`|ZO0qZRiHaa	try acting like you are not so into him, say other guys are hot, he will quit playin like that|`|MEBkl5Iraa	text him and be like <br>  so whats up goodlooking havn't talk to ya in awhile and see where it will go from there|`|6JPiNGdfaa	he is just normal|`|BAVPrCAeaa	Hey has other prospects.

4POGapREaa	You can buy a ring sizer online.  Mine was a sheet of blue plastic with pop out rings in every size.  It's a good way of getting a fairly good idea but I can tell you that when I went to an actual jewelry store, it was about 1/4 size off, then when I had the ring sized for me, the jeweler doing the sizing said that depending on what sizer the jeweler uses, they can all be between 1/4 to 1/2 size off.  So if I were to just tell him that I'm a 6 1/2 according to the other jeweler, it would have been too big because according to his sizer I'm a 6 1/4.  So, buying a cheap ring sizer online will definitely give you a ballpark & if you order online & it fits then great.  But my advice would be to go up rather than exact to what you think you are, because it's always easy to take away from the ring, but not so easy to add material to the ring to make it bigger.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	You can't.|`|9IRup1jHaa	easiest way is to go to a jeweller as they have all number of sizes and it takes 2 secs also different fingers can be different sizes so might be worth having it done properly some jewellers websites have ones you can send off for should be free or do what my boyfriend did fh found a washer that fit and took that in lol|`|ed8e2883b996a3685d6359a821a2d765aa	Whats the point of that.

OTIa819uaa	It's not that I don't like the black and white combo for weddings, it's just that I don't think they are appropriate for a summer wedding.<br>  <br>  Muted golds and silvers are a good way to lighten the day up without being to bright. Also a light, pastel canary yellow is nice especially if it is paired with white or ivory :) <br>  <br>  I'm planning a wedding myself and I'm not a bright color girl either but there are soo many different summer colors that you can use to make a beautiful summer wedding :)<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope you have a wonderful wedding!<br>  Liz|`|X6YY0OS6aa	good wedding colors for summer are orange, red, yellow..just really bright colors!

Just go with colours you like.|`|gTfIQaHcaa	If you want to stick with the black/white/red accent colour scheme, I highly recommend a rich purple to lighten it a bit. Purple goes well with all of those colours but reduces the amount of dark/tense feeling associated with the combination of the other colours. Purple is a great 'middle-ground' colour, as you can use it in all sorts of surroundings and occasions. <br>  Something like this colour would be ideal:<br>  <a href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/104/315510255_e900984a78.jpg?v=0" rel="nofollow">http://farm1.static.flickr.com/104/31551...</a><br>  <br>  If you find the idea of a different colour scheme acceptable, but don't want to go for the traditional summery stuff, you could try the combination of: muted pink, muted blue and maroon.<br>  Here's some examples of what I mean.<br>  <br>  Muted pink:<br>  <a href="http://www.giddygumps.com/files/TWdpk.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.giddygumps.com/files/TWdpk.jp...</a> (maybe a little darker than that?)<br>  <br>  Muted blue:<br>  <a href="http://uberhottie.com/images/flowerpins/Dark%20Blue%20Single%20Bead.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://uberhottie.com/images/flowerpins/...</a><br>  <br>  Maroon:<br>  <a href="http://www.stinkerbellaccessories.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/Joann.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.stinkerbellaccessories.com/si...</a><br>  <br>  I hope this helps you!<br>  Good luck :)|`|aipChC3haa	I like it, those color's are great, and if you are going to do those make sure your reception starts at around 6 or 7 P.M. so it is kind of dark out and people really get the feel.<br>  I like it though.<br>  =)|`|GQZDcfUiaa	Look in the current bridal magazines.

xJS3BdUNaa	I hate seeing a beautiful girl cry.  I don't know why but it doesn't seem right.  Like someone/something ruined something beautiful and innocent.

However, my wife cries about 3 or 4 times a week and I get fed up with it because I only cry about once every 5 years.  Keep it to no more than once a month and it will be okay.  If your boyfriend has known other girls he will know thats normal.|`|D0KuQ4Qeaa	they have a heart and when emotions come out they come out.hell what do you ladies think when you see us men cry?i personally think that women who feal comfotable enough to cry in front of me is a keeper.it shows they have a sensitive side and if they cry you try and comfort them to the best of your ability.|`|FgF39gBZaa	I answered your previous question about your BF.

First, you say he's pushing you away. Relationships only work when both people stay interested.  Maybe you can persuade him, but maybe not.  Second, what is he going to jail for?  If it's for a violent crime, you need to be concerned.  Even if it's not, if he's in a jail with violent offenders, the experience may change him in a potentially destructive way.<br>  <br>  I would slow this thing down a little.  If he is worth it, you can try again when he gets out.  But, I wouldn't stop my social life while he's away.

f5705ff0a4dc130e92b935f3f3a73717aa	Oh meu querido... olha, eu já tive muuuuuuuitos dias assim, onde parece que eu n?o me encontro, n?o caibo em lugar algum, ninguém me entende... é t?o ruim isso né?<br>  <br>  Olha, o que eu fa?o quando estou assim é o seguinte: ao invés de tentar camuflar meus sentimentos e minha tristeza eu os abra?o e curto o que os gringos chamam de "pity party." Ou seja, eu me dou uma "festinha privé" de lágrimas, revolta, raiva, solid?o, tristeza, tudo junto. Fico em algum lugar sozinha e choro minhas mágoas para mim mesma e para Deus. Choro mesmo, choro de solu?ar e coloco tudo pra fora.<br>  <br>  Mas essas minhas pity parties n?o duram muito pois eu estipulo um período para elas. Seja esse período alguns minutos ou algumas horas eu sou fiel a essa minha regrinha sabe? Depois de chorar minhas amarguras e ansiedades, depois de curtir esse turbilh?o de emo??es e essa enxurrada de lágrimas, eu me "for?o" a sair dela.<br>  <br>  Sempre me lembro daquela frase que a Scarlett O'Hara fala no final do filme E O Vento Levou sabe? Sei que pode parecer brega e tal... mas aquela frase sempre me ajudou muito desde a primeira vez que assisti o filme. Depois de tudo que ela passou, sofreu, dos erros que cometeu e dos caminhos que trilhou, a Scarlett disse: "Amanh? sempre é um novo dia."<br>  <br>  E vai ser! Amanh? sempre é um novo dia, com promessa de felicidade, melhoras, alegrias. O sol vai brilhar amanh? de novo. Vais despertar e colocar teus dois pés no ch?o como fazes todos os dias e dar um passo após o outro.<br>  <br>  Mas enquanto estiver se sentindo assim, deprê... seja PACIENTE contigo mesmo. N?o adianta tentar for?ar esses sentimentos para fora de ti pois eles podem voltar em dose dupla. Sinta-os. Analise-os. Se cuide. Se ame. Se mime!! Isso só você pode fazer, entende? <br>  <br>  Sim, faz muuuuuita falta alguém que nos entenda. Mas te entender e te apreciar 100$ SO VOCE pode fazer!!! Por que? Porque a grande maioria das pessoas só se preocupa com seus próprios umbigos e seus próprios problemas. Somos seres inerentemente egoístas Enio. <br>  <br>  Procure ajuda em ti mesmo e em Deus. Procure por seu "eu" mais verdadeiro. Converse consigo mesmo, troque idéias, desabafe consigo mesmo. Tente! Pode parecer loucura, mas mal n?o fará, concorda?<br>  <br>  Bem, eu gostaria de bater um longo papo com você hoje, de te abra?ar e de te dizer que estou aqui para te ouvir. Mas mesmo que a gente fa?a isso (e estou aqui se precisar viu), procure-se, tente se reencontrar. Você ainda está aqui, vivo, cheio de amor e de felicidade para viver.<br>  <br>  E como eu sempre digo e repito, tem aquele pedacinho da música de nosso querido Lulu Santos que diz tudo o que eu gostaria de te dizer agora ... ou quase tudo:<br>  <br>  Tudo que se vê n?o é<br>  De novo do jeito que já foi um dia<br>  Tudo passa, tudo sempre passará<br>  <br>  A vida vem em ondas, como o mar<br>  Num indo e vindo infinito<br>  <br>  E assim é com a minha vida.... e com a tua também!<br>  <br>  ~~~~~<br>  <br>  Um super beijo no teu ?!!!!!|`|1ecd1584b24edfdfd5e701bfc1ba95ffaa	Ooooooooooooiiiieeee!!!!

Ow, aposto que vc já ouviu que "depois da tempestade tem o arco-íris"!!! Ent?o... Vai passar, pode ter certeza!! E no final td vai dar certo! Eu garanto! Se n?o der, pode cobrar!!! <br>  Olha, eu quis colocar um poeminha bonitinho e tal, mas n?o achei e tb n?o sei se isso seria o melhor p/ vc agora... Sabe o que é mto bom?! Chorar.... Desabafa, deixa essas lágrimas caírem, n?o as impe?a, deixe-as chegar até seu lábios, pois s?o deles que nascer?o um grande sorriso!<br>  Espero que fique feliz rapidinho!!! <br>  Um abra?o apertado.|`|1a3d18364547ff7b37ceab88bfe2aa9daa	Velho, hoje você está assim, anteontem e ontem eu é que estava!<br>  E sabe de uma coisa, hoje eu estou muito bem!

Você n?o quer sabe da Bíblia, ent?o n?o mencionarei algo muito valioso, mas mencionarei a você uma frase semelhante que me ajuda.

Certificando-se de que o animal n?o se machucara, mas, pela dificuldade e o alto custo de retirá-lo do fundo do po?o, achou que n?o valeria a pena investir numa opera??o de resgate.<br>  <br>  Tomou ent?o a difícil decis?o: determinou ao capataz que sacrificasse o animal, jogando terra no po?o até enterrá-lo, ali mesmo.<br>  <br>  E assim foi feito: os empregados, comandados pelo capataz, come?aram a jogar terra para dentro do buraco de forma a cobrir o cavalo.<br>  <br>  Mas, à medida que a terra caía em seu dorso, o animal sacudia e ela ia se acumulando no fundo, possibilitando ao cavalo ir subindo. Logo, os homens perceberam que o cavalo n?o se deixava enterrar, mas, ao contrário, estava subindo à medida que a terra enchia o po?o, até que enfim, conseguiu sair.<br>  <br>  Sabendo do caso, o fazendeiro ficou muito satisfeito e o cavalo viveu ainda muitos anos servindo ao dono da fazenda.<br>  <br>  Se você estiver ''lá embaixo'', sentindo-se pouco valorizado, quando, já certos de seu desaparecimento, os outros jogarem sobre você terra da incompreens?o, da falta de oportunidades e de apoio, lembre-se desse cavalo. N?o aceite a terra que cai sobre você. Sacuda-a e suba sobre ela. E, quanto mais terra, mais você vai subindo...subindo...subindo, e aprendendo a sair do po?o.|`|b54232cbf756aab55f791faff70b7ac8aa	Claro q pode desabafar Enio,<br>  <br>  Eu tbm n?o estou bem, pq deposito nos outros a esperan?a de uma felicidade maior.<br>  <br>  Percebi q a vida é movimento, e qndo sinto vontade de chorar eu choro mesmo, até n?o sentir mais vontade de chorar.<br>  <br>  Eu tbm venho passando por momentos dificeis q só eu entendo, descobri q n?o adianta mesmo só lamentar como eu sempre fiz a vida inteira, me privando de viver , chorando por um amor nao correspondido, por isso isso e isso, e descobri q temos q criar situa??es para fugir dum estado ruim.<br>  <br>  cada dia tem uma história, e concerteza dias melhores vir?o para tds nós, leia as respostas das minhas perguntas sobre a transitoriedade da vida e sobre apego q vc respondeu, n?o imaginei q nop yahoo existissem tanta gente boa e de luz.<br>  <br>  um abra?o e felicidades Enio|`|4bcc78b31c8400b6c5a1d162e3ff1e05aa	Enio, querido, eu vou me abster de qualquer comentário, ok?

N?o espere retorno do que você faz de bom, pois você pode se decepcionar, pois nem todos têm o mesmo modo de agir ou de pensar.

Anime-se...|`|09cd3e1ff87c8bc5f0146ef18be04c14aa	Desculpe Amigo, sei que n?o quer ouvir coisas da Biblia, ent?o vou falar de mim pra você, entenda....<br>  <br>  Eu costumava acordar sentindo-me culpada e condenada. Estava cheia de acusa??es e críticas por cada pequeno erro que cometia. Mas esse tipo de procedimento cria uma press?o interna em nós que está prestes a explodir diante da primeira pessoa que se aproxima. <br>  Se você sofre com isso, comece o dia lendo a Palavra. Conhecer a misericórdia e perd?o de Deus é vital para aprender a amar a si mesmo, para que você possa amar os outros. Viva o dia de hoje em seu pleno potencial. <br>  <br>  E sabe de uma coisa.... precisamos ter um dia de tristeza na nossa vida... para valorizarmos os dias maravilhosos que temos e às vezes, quando terminam, nem lembramos de agradecer antes de dormirmos...<br>   <br>  <br>   Que sua vida seja CHEIA de momentos de ALEGRIA e COMPLETO com horas de FELICIDADE!!!|`|115337554e500a655e4ce026b88426f3aa	Quando li o seu  desabafo lembrei desse desabafo abaixo quando também estava meio baixo astral.... e ninguém consegue segurar essa onda pra gente a n?o ser a gente mesmo....mas leia com calma, quem sabe te ajudará..... Abra?os.<br>  <br>  TOMBO<br>  NAQUELE DIA TOMEI UM TOMBO...  E APRENDI.<br>  E assim, naquele dia que parecia como outro qualquer, meu mundo tornou-se cinzento. <br>  E assim, naquele dia que parecia como outro qualquer, decidi que o meu maior triunfo seria sobre mim mesmo.<br>  Aprendi que as quedas s?o estímulos para que aprendamos a levantar, com dignidade e com coragem.<br>  Aprendi que para olhar o mundo, é preciso estar no ch?o. Eu só o conhecia do alto da minha arrogancia.<br>  Descobri que nunca tinha questionado se minhas ambi??es incluíam a ética.<br>  Aprendi que nada nos acontece por acaso. Sempre há um “para que”.<br>  Descobri as caras feias que eu estava vendo nada mais eram que meus reflexos em milhares de espelho.<br>  Naquele dia descobri que meus rivais e meus desafetos eram apenas amea?as à minha inseguran?a. <br>  As sombras que me seguiam nada mais eram do que o reflexo negro da minha alma.<br>  Descobri que carregava em mim um Ego muito maior que eu.<br>  Naquele dia, descobri que eu n?o era o melhor e que talvez eu nunca tenha sido.<br>  Descobri que as minhas ambi??es eram fruto da minha enorme onipotência.  <br>  Naquele dia, deixei de ser um propagandista dos meus triunfos passados e passei a ser a minha luz do presente.<br>  Aprendi também que de nada serve ser luz se n?o posso iluminar o caminho dos demais.<br>  Naquele dia, deixei de ser o comercial do meu pseudo-conhecimento e passei a aprender um pouco mais.<br>  Aprendi também que de nada serve saber se n?o posso compartilhar e legar o conhecimento.<br>  Que para multiplicar o p?o de cada dia, é preciso dividí-lo.<br>  Aprendi que o difícil n?o é chegar lá em cima, e sim continuar a subida.<br>  Aprendi que a vitória duradoura n?o vem de sopet?o. Ela é conquistada por etapas. Eu subi rápido demais, alto demais!<br>  Vi que na luta pelos meus objetivos, o maior é lutar. E que s?o os caminhos sofridos que nos amadurecem e domam.<br>  Aprendi que posso fazer qualquer coisa e arcar com a responsabilidade das quedas.<br>  Deixei de me importar com quem ganha ou perde, e me importar simplesmente com quem faz.<br>  Decidi ver cada problema  como uma oportunidade para aprender a achar solu??es.<br>  Decidi n?o esperar as  oportunidades e sim, eu mesmo buscá-las.<br>  Decidi ver cada dia como uma nova oportunidade de recome?ar.<br>  Decidi ver cada noite como um mistério a resolver.<br>  Decidi ver cada deserto como uma possibilidade  de encontrar um oásis.<br>  Aprendi que as palmeiras altas e eretas, nos d?o uma li??o de dignidade e postura, diante das intempéries da vida.<br>  Aprendi que o melhor triunfo que posso ter, é ter o direito de chamar alguém de "amigo".<br>  Descobri que o amor é mais que um simples estado enamorado, "o amor é uma decis?o de vida.<br>  Vi que n?o estava protegendo aqueles que eu amo. Quando o bem é precioso demais, todo zelo é pouco. E que eu n?o sou o bem mais precioso!<br>  Aprendi que a compaix?o n?o é sentimentalismo e sim humanidade.<br>  Naquele dia, aprendi que os sonhos existem para fazer a realidade.<br>  Aprendi que a imagem do inatingível é o que nos aciona para que o busquemos. Tudo para mim foi atingível!<br>  E desde aquele dia já n?o durmo para descansar simplesmente... durmo para sonhar!<br>  E desde aquele dia já n?o batalho para triunfar e sim para lutar no combate.<br>  E desde aquele dia já n?o vivo mais para ganhar e sim para viver.<br>  Para cair... <br>  Para levantar... <br>  Para continuar...<br>  Para chorar... <br>  Para perdoar... Para respeitar... Para amar...<br>  Para aprender e para decidir sobre quem eu quero ser.|`|1f5970781c40f95ec7126ae12734afe3aa	fera, fexa seus olhos e se imagine em uma prai deserta, de um lado vc coloca as coisas boas na suas vida, do outro as coisas ruins, faca uma linha entre elas. agora cruze para o lado das coisas boas, tente ver fotos, ler emails que vc gosta, pense em pessoas que vc gosta, acredito que isso deveria te ajudar um pouco.

Q5anRclUaa	Nice =)  What you are trying to say is beautiful, but the first five lines don't flow.  The first few times that I read it, it just didn't sound right.<br>  I think you need to add "with" before "our friends" because we can experience love "in our families" but not "in...our friends". Or you could just change your "In" to "With" and you're good.<br>  And I think it would also flow nicer and make more sense if you changed "This" to "Our" because... Those five lines are obviously supposed to be a paragraph/poem/statement or whatever and read in the same context.  First you are talking about "we" learning to experience love, referring to us the invitees and you and your husband.  Then all of a sudden you are talking about a love that is not specified.

7iBCBYKQaa	Depende do que vc chama de desvio...... às vezes uma fantasia n?o quer dizer que seja um desejo a ser realizado.... Vc pode ter rela??es "imaginando" estar com outra pessoa, por exemplo, mas que se surgir a oportunidade vc n?o tem coragem, entende ? Uma fantasia só deve ser realizada se dentro dos seus padr?es de "normalidade", e isso serve para qualquer coisa na vida: só devemos fazer o que nos dá prazer, tudo que é feito somente para agradar os outros acaba sendo "mal feito" e trazendo infelicidade para uma das partes. Concess?es devem ser feitas sim, mas somente se for algo que n?o traga mal a ninguém. No mais, é só recusar e acabou! Cada um com seus problemas! rsrsrs|`|xlbjMEA3aa	O sexo pra ser bom, AMBOS tem que estar c?modos com o que está rolando. Se vc n?o gostou do que a pessoa te prop?s, ent?o diga a verdade, que vc n?o se sente c?modo fazendo isso, e pode ate mesmo dizer que vc tem nojo. E proponha fazer outra coisa. No fim das contas a outra pessoa pode ate mesmo repensar essa fantasia e come?ar a ver-la diferente, qdo uma outra pessoa que ela ama emite sua opini?o sincera sobre o assunto.<br>  sorte|`|AA12005596	Pessoas com desvios sexuais devem ser tratadas com psiquiatras. Claro que uma fantasia aceitável é até legal: gostar de pés por exemplo... n?o pode ser considerado um desvio. Agora, a pessoa querer comer fezes já ultrapassa o concebível. Só aceitaria uma fantasia dentro dos limites aceitáveis. Querer transar com animais também é abominável ou pedofilia. Enfim, você vê que há desvios inaceitáveis.

Os demais machos, secundários, s?o obrigados a errarem em bandos compostos apenas por indivíduos do sexo masculino, ficando sem se acasalar por anos a fio, até que consigam substituir algum garanh?o que esteja velho. As fêmeas n?o rivalizam entre si e aceitam sua infidelidade com naturalidade (como acontece com as f?s de qualquer cantor, mafioso, bilionário ou político). O garanh?o pode se relacionar com qualquer égua de seu harém sem o menor problema enquanto for capaz de manter feras e machos secundários assediadores afastados. Em outras palavras: os homens considerados "machos alpha" s?o como garanh?es e suas mulheres como éguas. <br>  Voltando a pergunta, para q suas parceiras sintam desejo sexual, é preciso excitar a imagina??o dela e n?o o seu físico, ou seja um corpo sarado n?o excita mulher alguma serve apenas para admira??o.|`|uA3WQ3uQaa	opa!!!<br>  com certeza!!!<br>  a inteligencia tanto atrai mulheres como homens!!!<br>  eu adimiro a inteligenci femina e a 1° coisa q observo numa mulher!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  abraaaaaa?os!!!|`|AA12005596	Assino embaixo.|`|bf8e0997bb6c0949cafad420160070e0aa	Muitas  vezes n?o concordo contigo...<br>  <br>  As mulheres também agem como animais...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Calma mulheres n?o me crucifique antes de ver as minhas raz?es...<br>  <br>  <br>  No reino animal, as fêmeas sentem mais atra??o pelo macho mais bonito, vistoso, agrande aparentemente.<br>  <br>  Mesmo os pássaros também tem esse método, eles só acasalam com aquele que se mostra mais belo, colorido etc...<br>  <br>  Creio que com as nossas mulheres também o visual desperta a quest?o libidinosa, pois elas pensam também em ter filhos saudáveis e fortes.|`|1eab2dda13b2b52684fd434af25cfb31aa	Bem, concordo com a sua frase mas é verdade que muitas mulheres d?o mais valor ao físico(uma heran?a greco-romana)do que a pessoa em si.|`|79e4b9865777ddec50231aa6dac76332aa	rsssssssss  e verdade ......mulher gosta de carater .<br>  carater carro<br>  carater dinheiro<br>  hihihihiii|`|a48ff9d87db89d0134e1a782fce55c8eaa	A inteligência e a forma de tratá-la muito bem!<br>  <br>  há quem diga o bolso, <br>  mas acho esse comentário meio maldoso!|`|f395a9cd1b628e04501bf5b027ffd07caa	Concordo..... mulher só se atrai por Karatê!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Karatê Carro....<br>  karatê Dinheiro...<br>  Karatê Casa...<br>  Karatê uma gorda conta bancaria..|`|29e6fef41374c0999a0d055afb3032e1aa	n?o concordo! tem varias mulheres com homens com qi a baixo da media.<br>  e também elas tem um pouco de vergonha de irem ate a banca e comprarem uma revista.<br>  outro fator é que a mulher n?o fica excitada só de ver, ela tem que ser tocada para chegar a excita??o, diferente do homem.<br>  uma curiosidade é que a mulher demora mais para se excitar, porem ela fica por mais tempo excitada.<br>  já o homem é diferente ele fica excitado mais rápido porem apaga o fogo mais rápido também.|`|2ed806cccef6565ce59f9e6fbff34e66aa	hmm n?o sei n?o cara <br>  na minha faculdade as garotas excluem todos os feios mesmo se forem inteligentes|`|3593be2acad4d331b430c2d0f1185a6aaa	concordo em parte, porque o que me fascina em um homem é um somatório de cavalheirismo, romantismo, inteligência e personalidade.|`|CWttbesGaa	Concordo plenamente, nunca vi uma frese que falasse tanto em t?o pouco.<br>  Queremos homens inteligentes, que saibam nos conquistar e nos ganhar com palavras e conversas interessantes ser bonito é só uma conseqüência que é maravilhosa.<br>  <br>  Bjokas!!!|`|aC8ZtNwZaa	Só passei pra ver as respostas, essa n?o é minha praia.

As pessoas, que hoje, tem vida longa, nossos avós, tios, tias..., s?o remanescentes de um período em que a alimenta??o era saudável e, na minha opini?o, a base de forma??o do organismo, no ínicio da vida. Essa base saudável na alimenta??o, unida ao avan?o da medicina e do comportamento, est?o dando longevidade as pessoas. Apartir da minha gera??o, hoje 30 anos, as coisas come?am a piorar, os índices, mostram isso. A medicina n?o está conseguindo evoluir junto com as doen?as, é o caso do cancer, da aids, das doen?as cerebrais... Está conseguindo uma sobrevida melhor, mas n?o a cura. A nossa base alimentar e, das gera??es que est?o em desenvolvimento, n?o tem nada de estruturas, baseada na industrializa??o com o uso de conservantes e produtos químicos. Os venenos usados contra as pragas nas lavouras, agridem o organismo humano a um ponto que ainda n?o temos conhecimento. Os acidentes, a violência, o estresse... Bem, desculpe desapontá-lo, mas a vida está curta demais para os jovens. Basta vc analisar as estatísticas e comprovará o que digo. Portanto, n?o adie seus sonhos. Viva, como se cada dia fosse o último! Claro que, n?o fa?a disso, um pessimismo e uma preocupa??o, mas uma for?a para lutar mais e viver melhor! Nunca sabemos tudo e estamos no ápice da experiência, a cada dia aprendemos muito, basta estarmos abertos para isso.  é a minha opini?o! Abra?os!

Unfair!! IS he serious? Could be attention getter, or he may need serious help. So, determine how bad he is, and tell him life is worth every minute, and we must stick around to see what happens . Life can change on a dime for anybody. I feel for you, trying to keep yourself together and now this! I mean was he just having a bad day, or is this something he should be talking to someone about?<br>  I have lost some people in my life to suicide, and one person I did not see it coming at all. If someone tells you this, they want help or attention. Tell him he should talk to a professional. You cant fix him.<br>  And you shouldnt have to.

He needs to talk to a doctor. I was suicidal once and after my third visit to the doctor, I told her I still had some suicidal thoughts. She had me sign a paper declaring that I will not harm myself or another. I signed it. Not only is this self-affirmation to help someone realize how serious it is, but it also gets them to thinking about the possible action a doctor is legally bound to take when they fear a person is in danger of harming their own body or another. The thought crossed my mind-- if i ever attempted, failed, then went to the doctor or the doctor had that legal document sent to a mental health facility, I may be admitted. There are many many steps to this being the case though, but realize this when I signed the paper, I realized I needed to cut out the crap and pull myself out of the downward spiral I was in. It was a failed relationship/engagement that caused the depression... so the "crap" was that I needed to stop wishing I could  be with him again, stop wishing he would love me, stop wishing I had done things differently. The best thing we can do is just move on and keep working towards what we want out of life. Even if we never get what we want, our relentless desire to move forward always gives us what we need.<br>  <br>  To get resources of how to pull out of depression, ask your own doctor, he'll provide tips and activities to help you both.

Desde um ser humano que vende o corpo, passando pelas revistas das bancas da vida, e principalmente dentre todos os veículos de comunica??o, o mercado fonográfico e a internet.<br>  Outro dia vi que é mínimo o grupo de sites que atuam na Campanha contra a Pedofilia.<br>  às vezes vc. tá se esbaldando num "site" que é fonte de entretenimento de um estuprador, por exemplo.<br>  Ninguem precisa viver essa gratuidade sexual, que é um atalho de violência à vida. E como bem sabemos, se há comércio destes "produtos" é porque existe mercado pra isso. Ent?o, olhando pra cada um de nós mesmos. Vamos sinceramente responder: Qual é o perfil deste consumidor?<br>  Por exemplo: Se na minha esquina tem uma loja que só fornece "quiabo".

O objetivo da reencarna??o é a evolu??o. /A mediunidade, que permite a comunica??o dos Espíritos com os homens, é uma faculdade que muitas pessoas trazem consigo ao nascer, independentemente da religi?o ou da diretriz doutrinária de vida que adotem. / Mas aten??o: prática mediúnica espírita só é aquela que é exercida com base nos princípios da Doutrina Espírita e dentro da moral crist?. Portanto, em hipótese alguma o médium poderá cobrar dinheiro, exigir ou aceitar qualquer forma de recompensa (presentes, dádivas, agrados, etc.) por suas atividades mediúnicas. Os Espíritos s?o os seres inteligentes da cria??o. Constituem o mundo dos Espíritos, que preexiste e sobrevive a tudo./ Os Espíritos s?o criados simples e ignorantes. Evoluem, intelectual e moralmente, passando de uma ordem inferior para outra mais elevada, até a perfei??o, onde gozam de inalterável felicidade. Os Espíritos preservam sua individualidade, antes, durante e depois de cada encarna??o. Jesus é o guia e modelo para toda a Humanidade. E a Doutrina que ensinou e exemplificou é a express?o mais pura da Lei de Deus. Além do mundo corporal, habita??o dos Espíritos encarnados, que s?o os homens, existe o mundo espiritual, habita??o dos Espíritos desencarnados. Eles estudam, trabalham e desenvolvem diversas atividades no mundo espiritual.· O Espiritismo explica que Deus é a inteligência suprema, causa primeira de todas as coisas. é eterno, imutável, imaterial, único, onipotente, soberanamente justo e bom. O Universo é cria??o de Deus. Abrange todos os seres racionais e irracionais, animados e inanimados, materiais e imateriais. Todas as leis da Natureza s?o leis divinas, pois que Deus é o seu autor. Abrangem tanto as leis físicas como as leis morais.· Jesus é o guia e modelo para toda a Humanidade. A moral do Cristo, contida no Evangelho, é o roteiro para a evolu??o segura de todos os homens, e a sua prática é a solu??o para todos os problemas humanos e o objetivo a ser atingido pela Humanidade. A Doutrina Espírita esclarece que no Universo há outros mundos habitados, com seres de diferentes graus de evolu??o: iguais, mais evoluídos e menos evoluídos que os homens. ·Os Espíritos s?o as almas dos homens que já perderam o corpo físico. A exemplo do que observamos na Humanidade encarnada, o conhecimento que eles têm é correspondente ao seu grau de adiantamento moral e intelectual. A morte é uma passagem para a vida espiritual e n?o dá valores morais ou de inteligência a quem n?o os tem.·Os Espíritos evoluem sempre. Em suas múltiplas existências corpóreas podem estacionar, mas nunca regridem. A rapidez do seu progresso intelectual e moral depende dos esfor?os que fa?am para chegar à perfei??o./ O Espiritismo é uma doutrina que surgiu na Fran?a, em 1857. Seu fundador foi Allan Kardec. O Candomblé e a Umbanda s?o doutrinas espiritualistas de origem africana.·Os espíritos pertencem a diferentes ordens, conforme o grau de perfei??o que tenham alcan?ado: Espíritos Puros, que atingiram a perfei??o máxima; Bons Espíritos, nos quais o desejo do bem é o que predomina; Espíritos Imperfeitos, caracterizados pela ignorancia, pelo desejo do mal e pelas paix?es inferiores./  As rela??es dos Espíritos com os homens s?o constantes e sempre existiram. Os bons Espíritos nos atraem para o bem, sustentam-nos nas provas da vida e nos ajudam a suportá-las com coragem e resigna??o. Os imperfeitos nos induzem ao erro. ·Lei de causa e efeito?é uma lei criada por Deus e que disp?e que o homem tem o livre-arbítrio para agir, mas responde pelas conseqüências de suas a??es. O que fazemos de mal e de bem retornará para nós nessa mesma vida ou em existência posteriores. A vida futura reserva aos homens penas e gozos compatíveis com o procedimento de respeito ou n?o à Lei de Deus. A prece é um ato de adora??o a Deus. Está na lei natural e é o resultado de um sentimento inato no homem, assim como é inata a idéia da existência do Criador. A prece torna melhor o homem. Aquele que ora com fervor e confian?a se faz mais forte contra as tenta??es do mal e Deus lhe envia bons Espíritos para assisti-lo. é este um socorro que jamais se lhe recusa, quando pedido com sinceridade. /Toda a prática espírita é gratuita, como orienta o princípio moral do Evangelho: “Dai de gra?a o que de gra?a recebestes” Espiritismo revela conceitos novos e mais aprofundados a respeito de Deus, do Universo, dos Homens, dos Espíritos e das Leis que regem a vida. Revela, ainda, o que somos, de onde viemos, para onde vamos, qual o objetivo da nossa existência e qual a raz?o da dor e do sofrimento. A prática espírita é realizada com simplicidade, sem nenhum culto exterior, dentro do princípio crist?o de que Deus deve ser adorado em espírito e verdade. O Espiritismo n?o tem sacerdotes e n?o adota e nem usa em suas reuni?es e em suas práticas: altares, imagens, andores, velas, prociss?es, sacramentos, concess?es de indulgência, paramentos, bebidas alcoólicas ou alucinógenas, incenso, fumo, talism?s, amuletos, horóscopos, cartomancia, piramides, cristais ou quaisquer outros objetos, rituais ou formas de culto exterior. · O Espiritismo n?o imp?e jamais os seus princípios. Convida os interessados em conhecê-lo a submeterem os seus ensinos ao crivo da raz?o, antes de aceitá-los. ·O Espiritismo respeita todas as religi?es e doutrinas, valoriza todos os esfor?os para a prática do bem e trabalha pela confraterniza??o e pela paz entre todos os povos e entre todos os homens, independentemente de sua ra?a, cor, nacionalidade, cren?a, nível cultural ou social.  Reconhece que “o verdadeiro homem de bem é o que cumpre a lei de justi?a, de amor e de caridade, na sua maior pureza”.|`|CmedXPa5aa	sim acredito, mas morro de medo e evito pessoas com esses tipos de coisas!!! fa?o até xixi nas cal?as de tanto medo..|`|sglK6hoDaa	eu n?o acredito|`|00aae2c825560093ad17ba31099f2dd9aa	N?o, jamais<br>  Deus diz na bíblia que n?o existe comunica??o entre o lado de cá e o de lá<br>  Por isso, tudo mentira<br>  As pessoas querem ver de qualquer jeito, por isso a mente delas s?o impulsionadas a ver.<br>  Bjussss cada um com sua opini?o|`|1brnD1hwaa	CLARO QUE NAO....ISSO TUDO é ATUA??O MALIGNA!<br>  A PALAVRA DE DEUS DIZ: QUE Só SE VIVE E MORRE UMA úNICA VEZ!|`|AUM0483Aaa	nao|`|FZJ23Nsyaa	Sim,por incrivel que pare?a eu sempre vejo nao é sempre pessoas mortas mais sim;eu vejo muito vultos a noite em todo lugar.|`|dRLdLMP4aa	n?o acredito nunca vi ja sonhei c/ pessoas que morreran.|`|wPirN37zaa	acredito sim e acho normal isso...|`|8d861dc1fab9fd341f9c70c6733190bbaa	Eu n?o acredito muito nessas vis?es<br>  <br>  Em este mundo tudo o que é incrível, me gostaria de poder participar para ver e crer.<br>  <br>  .

Porque você tem mais liberdade de fazer o que você quiser como festas,escutar o som alto...você tem o terreno ao redor da casa para fazer qualquer mudan?a em sua casa, o que teu vizinho fizer de barulho nunca vai te incomodar,você pode soltar seus filhos para brincarem com mais liberdade,criar dogs sem um vizinho achar ruim (mas se o dog ladrar à noite toda...).<br>  Em apto tudo é limitado,por exemplo se você quer dar uma festa tem mandar um memorando solicitando o espa?o reservado, existem muitas regras em prédios (condomínio), e sem falar das taxas que s?o absurdos. Casa é muito melhor. Mas se você trabalha viajando aí apto é a melhor escolham, mesmo com tantas regras.

Vamos supor que estejam um grupo de cinco amigos, e p fulano fala sua cor favorita é rosa, ela vai e concorda, aí daqui 5 min ciclano diz sua cor favorita é azul, ela vai e concorda tb, e assim por diante.<br>  Eu acredito que pessoas assim tenham medo de ser rejeitas pela sociedade se falarem o que realmente pensam.

Por isso, escrevemos alguns argumentos sobre o tema, a fim de que possamos com a Doutrina espírita aprender um pouco mais.<br>   <br>                O Espiritismo explica baseado no livre-arbítrio, no percurso de vidas anteriores e na evolu??o moral de cada um, como estes assuntos devem ser tratados. Lembrando sempre que “cada caso é um caso e muito particular”.<br>   <br>                Uma dessas ansiedades é a masturba??o, que segundo Sigmund Freud, é envolvida em muito preconceito, gra?as ao dogmatismo religioso que estigmatiza a sexualidade. Vai distante a época em que se decretava que a masturba??o conduzia à loucura e ao inferno. Normal no adolescente que está descobrindo a sexualidade, freqüente nos cora??es solitários, o problema é que ela favorece a vicia??o, agu?ando o psiquismo do indivíduo com sensualidade avivada. Por outro lado, obsta a sublima??o das energias sexuais, quando as circunstancias nos convocam à castidade, incitando-nos a canalizá-las para as realiza??es mais enobrecedoras. Vale dizer: há uma energia sexual que precisa ser controlada, n?o necessariamente através da prática sexual, mas direcioná-la a outras atividades, inclusive a prática da caridade.<br>   <br>                A consciência nos sussurra que rela??o sexual presume dois parceiros. O auto-erotismo n?o deixa de ser uma busca de “prazer” egoísta, por isso mesmo, toda prudência é imprescindível. Na área sexual, urge vigilancia permanente, pois, na maioria das vezes ao se masturbar, a criatura n?o está t?o solitária como imagina. Espíritos das sombras, viciados no sexo, muitas vezes estimulam este vício solitário, prejudicando casais quando o parceiro opta por masturbar-se. Entretanto, mister considerar que cada caso é um caso, sem desconsiderar jamais que o equilíbrio e a disciplina mental precisam ser alcan?ados. Por isso o Espírito Emmanuel, no livro "O Consolador", quest?o 184, psicografado por Chico Xavier, orienta-nos que, “ao invés da educa??o sexual pela satisfa??o dos instintos, é imprescindível que os homens eduquem sua alma para a compreens?o sagrada do sexo”.<br>   <br>                O uso indevido de qualquer fun??o sexual produz distúrbios, desajustes, carências, que somente a educa??o do hábito consegue harmonizar. Afinal, o homem n?o é apenas um feixe de sensa??es, mas, também, de emo??es, que podem e devem ser dirigidas para objetivos que o promovam, nos quais centralize os seus interesses, motivando-o a esfor?os que ser?o compensados pelos resultados benéficos. <br>   <br>                A vida saudável na esfera do sexo decorre da disciplina, da canaliza??o correta das energias, da a??o física: pelo trabalho, pelos desportos, pelas conversa??es edificantes que proporcionam resistência contra os arrastamentos da sensualidade, auxiliando o indivíduo na conduta. Muitas pessoas consideram o prazer apenas como sendo uma express?o da lascívia, e se esquecem daquele que decorre dos ideais conquistados, da beleza que se expande em toda parte e pode ser contemplada, das encantadoras alegrias do sentimento afetuoso, sem posse, sem exigência, sem o condicionamento carnal. <br>   <br>                Será que devemos depreender que o Espiritismo proíbe toda a atividade sexual?! De modo algum. O Espiritismo nada proíbe. Deixa ao livre-arbítrio, à decis?o consciente de cada um a atitude a tomar. Limita-se a dar orienta??o e a demonstrar que atitudes mal tomadas d?o intranqüilidade e insatisfa??o e coloca-nos perante a realidade e vantagens do uso consciente da vida. <br>   <br>                A Doutrina Espírita apresenta a sexualidade despida da conota??o religiosa dogmática que consagrou o sexo pecaminoso, sujo, proibido e demoníaco. Todavia, n?o legitima o enquadramento da sociedade atual que consubstanciou o sexo como objeto de consumo, devasso e trivial. A proposta espiritista é da energia criadora que necessita estar sedimentada pela lógica e pelo sentimento, pelo respeito e entendimento, pela fidelidade e amor, a fim de propiciar a excelsitude e a paz, ou seja, “Um sexo para a vida e n?o uma vida para o sexo!”<br>   <br>                Para Emmanuel, no livro “Vida e Sexo”, diante das proposi??es a respeito do sexo, é justo sintetizar-se todas as digress?es possíveis nas seguintes normas: n?o proibi??o, mas educa??o; n?o abstinência imposta, mas emprego digno, com o devido respeito aos outros e a si mesmo; n?o indisciplina, mas controle; n?o impulso livre, mas responsabilidade. Fora disso, é teorizar simplesmente, para depois aprender ou reaprender com a experiência. Sem isso, será enganar-nos, lutar sem proveito, sofrer e recome?ar a obra da sublima??o pessoal, tantas vezes quantas se fizerem precisas, pelos mecanismos da reencarna??o, porque a aplica??o do sexo, ante a luz do amor e da vida, é assunto pertinente à consciência de cada um. <br>   <br>                Ninguém se burila de um dia para outro. Convers?es religiosas exteriores n?o alteram, de improviso, os impulsos do cora??o. Achamo-nos muito longe da meta para alcan?ar o projeto de acrisolamento sexual. A rigor, nenhum de nós consegue se conhecer t?o exatamente, a ponto de saber, hoje, qual o tamanho da experiência afetiva que nos aguarda no futuro. N?o há como penetrarmos nas consciências alheias e cada um de nós, ante a Sabedoria Divina, é um caso particular, no que tange ao amor, reclamando compreens?o. Em face disso, muitos de nossos erros imaginários na Terra s?o caminhos certos para o bem, ao passo que muitos de nossos acertos hipotéticos s?o trilhas para o mal de que nos desvencilharemos, um dia!...<br>   <br>                A energia sexual, como recurso da lei de atra??o, na perpetuidade do Universo, é inerente à própria vida, gerando cargas magnéticas em todos os seres, face às potencialidades criativas de que se reveste. à medida que a individualidade evolui, passa a compreender que a energia sexual envolve o impositivo de discernimento e responsabilidade em sua aplica??o. Por isso mesmo, deve estar controlada por valores morais que lhe garantam o emprego digno, seja na cria??o de formas físicas, asseguradora da família, ou na cria??o de obras beneméritas da sensibilidade e da cultura para a reprodu??o e extens?o do progresso e da experiência, da beleza e do amor, na evolu??o e burilamento da vida no Planeta. <br>   <br>                Nas liga??es afetivas terrenas encontramos as grandes alegrias. No entanto, é também dentro delas que somos habitualmente defrontados pelas mais duras prova??es. Embora n?o percebamos de imediato, recebemos, quase sempre, no companheiro ou na companheira da vida íntima, os nossos próprios reflexos.<br>   <br>                Analisemos o matrim?nio, por exemplo, que pode perfeitamente ser precedido de do?ura e esperan?a, mas isso n?o impede que os dias subseqüentes, em sua marcha incessante, tragam aos c?njuges os resultados das próprias cria??es que deixaram para trás. Parceiro e parceira, nos compromissos do lar, precisam reaprender na escola do amor, reconhecendo que, acima da conjun??o corpórea, fácil de se concretizar, é imperioso que a dupla se case, em espírito - sempre mais em espírito -, dia por dia. Até porque extinta a fogueira da paix?o na retorta da organiza??o doméstica, remanesce da combust?o o ouro vivo do amor puro, que se valoriza, cada vez mais, de alma para alma, habilitando o casal para mais altos destinos na Vida Superior, até porque é o Espírito quem ama e n?o o corpo, de sorte que, dissipada a ilus?o material, o Espírito vê a realidade que transcende à vida física.<br>   <br>                Urge considerar que a Vontade de Deus, na essência, é o dever em sua mais alta express?o tra?ado para cada um de nós, no tempo chamado "hoje". E se o "hoje" jaz vi?ado de complica??es e problemas, a repontarem do "ontem", depende de nós a harmonia ou o desequilíbrio do "amanh?". Destarte, o instinto sexual, exprimindo amor em expans?o incessante, nasce nas profundezas da vida, orientando os processos da evolu??o. <br>   <br>                Importa considerar que diante do sexo, n?o nos achamos, de nenhum modo, à frente de um despenhadeiro para as trevas, mas perante a fonte viva das energias em que a Sabedoria do Universo situou o laboratório das formas físicas e a usina dos estímulos espirituais mais intensos para a execu??o das tarefas que esposamos, em regime de colabora??o mútua, visando ao rendimento do progresso e do aperfei?oamento entre os homens.<br>   <br>                Cada homem e cada mulher que ainda n?o se angelizou ou que n?o se encontre em processo de bloqueio das possibilidades criativas, no corpo ou na alma, traz, evidentemente, maior ou menor percentagem de anseios sexuais, a se expressarem por sede de apoio afetivo. é claramente nas lavras da experiência, errando e acertando e tornando a errar para acertar com mais seguran?a, que cada um de nós - os filhos de Deus em evolu??o na Terra - conseguirá sublimar os sentimentos que nos s?o próprios, de modo a nos erguer, em definitivo, para a conquista da felicidade celeste e do Amor Universal. <br>   <br>      * Jorge Luiz Hessen é natural do Rio de Janeiro, nascido em 18/08/1951. é Servidor Público Federal lotado no INMETRO de Brasília; Forma??o acadêmica: Licenciado em Estudos Sociais e Bacharel em História, Escritor (dois livros publicados) Jornalista e articulista com vários artigos publicados na Revista O médium de Juiz de Fora, Reformador da FEB, O Espírita de Brasília (pertence ao conselho editor), do Jornal da Federa??o de Mato Grosso e do Jornal da FEDERA??O DO DF.

A dor de um término de um relacionemento, na psicologia, é comparado ao luto. E passa pelas mesmas fases. Primeiro a pessoa tende a negar ( inconscientemente claro), depois sofre e odeia, e por fim aceita que acabou, e se abre para as novas perspectivas. è importante tentar perdoar. Dentro da gente existe um certo medo de se render ao perd?o. POis, parece q perdoando estamos aceitando tudo de mal q a pessoa nos fez. Mas n?o. A gente pode perdoar no cora??o e decidir q ficará afastado da pessoa, pois o fato de perdoarmos tbem n?o significa q ele irá mudar de caráter e atitude. <br>  Mas, enfim, é normal sentir vazio, pq realmente há um. O importante é a ceitar a muda?a. Ontem eu li um artigo maravilhoso sobre isso, pois tbem estou precisando. Procure VIDA SIMPLES, no google, é uma revista da abril, e leia um artigo que come?a com a palavra ACABOU?... ( n?o lembro o resto do título).

Um mês depois quando recuperei de uma depress?o, decidi mudar, o meu cora??o estava cheio de ódio de tudo e todos, e eu decidi vingar-me assim, mostrando a eles que eu podia ser feliz, que eu era mais do que eles esperavam, em ajuda a isso a minha situa??o financeira melhorou, e eu fiquei mais bonita, mais arranjada, comecei a fazer amigos nesse ver?o e assim a minha auto estima foi subindo... naquela altura entrei para uma nova escola, e conheci o meu primeiro Amor, e percebi ent?o no meio disso tudo, que basta nós fazermos muita for?a por isso, que conseguimos sempre ser felizes!<br>  Apesar de tudo, perdoei essa "amiga" e continuei com ela... so que nessa altura aquilo que falou para eu acabar toda a amizade, foi o facto de eu ter descoberto que afinal, ela so esteve do meu lado, porque se alimentava da minha tristeza, porque quando eu estava feliz nessa fase, ela disse que desde que eu mudei que estava arrogante, e via o mundo todo cor de rosa demais... enfim... por tudo o que eu vi deu para perceber que a minha felicidade a perturbava e até agora perturba... apesar desse caso de Amor ter acabado, hoje em dia eu sou muito mais feliz, com todos os meus problemas é claro (e acredita que sao muitos), mas com muita mais for?a para enfrentá-los, pois aquilo que me faltava era confian?a em  mim propria!<br>  Hoje, eu revejo os meus valores todos os dias, tentando me tornar numa pessoa melhor a cada dia que passa, acho que a mudan?a que eu tive desde aquela fase em que o meu amigo morreu, ainda n?o parou, eu continuo a mudar, so que mais lentamente. Olho pra tras e fico surpresa comigo mesma, pois mudei tao de repente fui mais forte do que aquilo que pensava!<br>  Aquela amiga, que virou uma inimiga assumida, passa o tempo a olhar pra mim e a tentar copiar-me, a tentar fazer-me infeliz, até a ela a um tempo atras eu dei uma li??o e ja a eliminei da minha lista.<br>  Olha eu pesso desculpa pelo testamento, mas com uma parte da minha historia de vida, eu so queria mostrar-te que se somos pessoas boas, temos tudo para ser felizes.

Assis !!!<br>  <br>  Menina que cacetada hein ? <br>  Olha, teve uma vez que um amigo meu , acabou vivendo  uma experiência quase igual a sua, mas  á  situa?a? era inversa. A sua mulher, da qual ele gostava demais e tinha um relacionamento maravilhoso, adorava  se relacionar com uma funcionária dele,( lá da loja de tecidos), toda as vezes que ele saía para fazer compras de  tecidos importados e nascionais no interior do Brasi., Demorava dias e a sua mulher fazia a farra enquanto isto. Num determinado momento ele voltou mais cedo e pegou-a em fragante, com a dita cuja da funcionária na cama. O casamento, dele rodou naquele instante, e  ele pensou em tudo, no amor , na vida, o desespero , e por fim em se matar. Quando eu soube, procurei ajuda-lo e como ele gostava demais dela e sem ela fatalmente morreria, dei-lhe um simples conselho para que ele aceitasse ela como era e também convivesse com a sua amante . Hoje vivem felizes, compartilhando o sexo á três  !!!!!!!   UM ABRA??O !!!!|`|d25c7d47c230547aaaabe0bbc4781681aa	Seu marido n?o é gay, seu marido é bissexual.<br>  N?o é melhor resolver seu problema conjugal com ele e só ent?o partir pra ficar com outro?<br>  Nada mais justo.<br>  Boa sorte.|`|l7aHH9rdaa	Uau!!!

Aliás fantasia minha e da maioria das mulheres.<br>  Depois eu ia ver o que fazer. Ficar só com o amigo. Dar um pé nos dois e arranjar outro. Ou ficar com os dois juntos, porque n?o?<br>  Adorei o teu caso<br>  Bjim

8cf073c8d02a950808d1b0b9467e41cfaa	There are so many, many choices there - it depends on what you want.  Is it just you or do you need to also have a reception with lots of guests?  In a large hotel casino or away from the Strip? What's your budget?  Any theme?  Outdoors?<br>  <br>  If it's a hotel-casino you want the new Wynn has a chapel, as does the Bellagio, Paris, Monte Carlo and MGM all of which are very nice.  If cost is an issue, I'd suggest the Imperial Palace - I had mine there with a reception for 50 people & it was less than $2500.<br>  <br>  Also consider Chapel Fiorenza at Lake Las Vegas - <a href="http://www.chapelfiorenza.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.chapelfiorenza.com</a>  It's far off the strip with a beautiful lake and luxury hotels.<br>  <br>  One of my favorites though is just off the strip - it's called Victoria's - and they also do receptions.

They have a gorgeous chapel & the hotel is first class.|`|xChjviZTaa	The chapel in Mandalay Bay is beautiful, and they offer all the services you could want on site.  I would love to be married there.|`|BtbUvovnaa	The absolute nicest chapel in Las Vegas has got to be "A Special Memory Wedding Chapel" (www.aspecialmemory.com).  They have a large chapel which seats about 100 people, with a spiral staircase or double doors for a bride's grand entrance.  They also have a smaller chapel which seats about 25 people for a more private feel.  If you want to get married outdoors, they have beautiful grounds and a gazebo, and they also offer off-site ceremonies at locations such as Lake Mead, etc.  Of course, they also have the drive up window if you don't even want to get out of your car.  The staff are very knowledgable and will never make you feel as if you are part of an assembly line.  They offer a selection of flowers, photography, butterfly and/or dove releases and cakes.  They offer traditional non-religious ceremonies as well as have ministers and rabbi's available from many different religions.  Their limo will pick you up at your hotel, take you to get your marriage license and bring you to the chapel.  Once your ceremony is over, it will return you to your hotel.  They have quite a few packages to choose from and I'm sure everyone can find one that fits their budget.  Give them a call, you will not be disappointed.  Good Luck!

AA11225410	Hi sweetie here to help.  It is so hard being around negative energy. It is draining to one's own energy and it does make us tired! <br>    It sounds as if your "friend" just uses you as her dumping ground for all of her problems. That is not really fair. Most of us like to have a friend that we can go to when we have problems, but it is different if you are complaining to them every single day. <br>    It takes more energy to be negative than positive. Unfortunately, you will have these friends that only want to talk to you when something negative is going on in their lives. The reason for this is that they are looking for attention (but are doing it in the weirdest ways!).<br>   You have to decide whether you want to listen to this friend ALL the time. You have a little control too. When she calls you and proceeds with her drama, "Say, sorry, can I call you back? I am in the middle of something right now." Blow her off for a little while, and see how this works... Don't call her back right away, wait a few days.<br>    If blowing her off does not give her the hint that you do not want to listen to her drama all the time, you may have to be totally upfront with her, and you probably are going to hurt her feelings for a little while. She will eventually get over feeling hurt, but maybe she needs to think about her actions.<br>    You could go about confronting her in person. After you have blown her off and that did not work, you need to tell her that you want to get together to talk in person. Say something like this: Look Jennie, I know that we have been friends for a while, and I am always here for you. But lately, it seems like the only reason you call me is to talk about some new drama in your life. I am not saying that you can never come to me with a problem, but I want to be able to have a conversation besides your problems all the time.<br>    I know that sounds harsh, but sometimes you need to lay it on the line for these people or they will never get the hint. Maybe you should ask her why she does this to you, and why she runs into a llot of drama. I hate to be a jerk, but I bet your friend is the cause of her own drama that is in her llife.<br>    Good luck with things. You don't have to let her talk to you about her problems all the time. Just know that you have control too.

92ec4ac42eceddf4e1688a71047efa96aa	Latino<br>  Es el nombre del antiguo pueblo que habitaba el Lacio cuya lengua era el latín. La antigua Roma fue originalmente una aldea latina; por eso, posteriormente, se utilizó para referirse a los antiguos ciudadanos romanos. <br>  Se usaba antiguamente para referirse a aquellos pueblos que hablaban una lengua derivada del latín (lenguas romances): los espa?oles, los franceses, los italianos, los portugueses, los rumanos, y todos aquellos países que fueron fundados por los romanos en la época de la colonización. <br>  En el inglés de los Estados Unidos latino se aplica a los estadounidenses de origen hispanoamericano a quienes denominaron latinoamericanos para evitar la referencia a los hispanos , que poblaron América antes que los anglosajones. Dependiendo del contexto, este término puede conllevar connotaciones xenófobas, pero es generalmente aceptado y usado. Los "latinos" son asociados a los países de habla hispana e incluso en algunos casos a los de habla portuguesa. <br>  En Italia, el término se utiliza a veces para denotar a una persona del Mezzogiorno, la región del país generalmente localizada al sur de Roma, puesto que en la Edad Media esta región tenía influencias considerablemente menos célticas y germánicas que la Italia del Norte; un ejemplo de este uso es el que realizó Dante en la Divina Comedia (Inferno, Canto XXII, línea 65, y Canto XXIX, líneas 90 y 92). <br>  Países Latinoamericanos: generalmente se considera como tales a Argentina, Bolivia, Brasil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Chile, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haití, Honduras, México, Nicaragua, Panamá, Paraguay, Perú, República Dominicana, Uruguay, Venezuela, y Puerto Rico. Sin embargo aquel termino en muchos aspectos se contradice desde su significado original por tal razon se recomienda no generalizar este termino, puesto que tanto en Mexico Centro y Sudamerica existen una infinidad de indentidades étnicos-culturales tanto de la pre-conquista (Aymaras, Chicanos, Quechua) como inmigrantes no latinos que llegaron posteriormente(Chinos, Alemanes Japoneses, Arabes) que reclaman con justa razon su propia identidad étnico-Cultural. <br>  La generalización del termino "Latino" o "Latinoamericano" puede generar una cierta imposición, por tal razon se debe tener mucho cuidado en el uso del mencionado termino.<br>  La denominación, en Estados Unidos de América, se emplea para denominar al conjunto de los países cuyas lenguas vernáculas derivan del latín, o romances lo que incluye a los anteriores y a Espa?a, Francia, Italia, Rumania y otros|`|f49bb806e5a054f0a0806a0b76ac6834aa	es claro ,es la misma mimi con diferente olor.suerte|`|99c61d5fe5a2ee80e6be3977a1b344d8aa	no sé mucho pero voy a chamullar:   latino vien de la pa,labra latin que vendría siendo el origen de la lengua de todos nosotros que vivimos en america latina, e hispano se les llama a los habitantes de america ...osea vendría siendo lo mismo....pero una es mas fina y la otra mas bulgar,,,,,,,,<br>  te parece????<br>  a mi me quedó clarita!!!!!!!!!|`|RS5ZfSCSaa	creo que latino viene de las naciones latinas, aquellas cuya lengua deriva del latin(Espa?a,Portugal, Francia, Italia y los paises latinoamericanos) mientras hispano es relativo a los espa?oles y americanos donde se habla espa?ol y esta lengua acuerdate que es de origen neolatina osea que practicamente son sinonimos|`|T03X64qGaa	Latino. Los orígenes de su lengua y mestisaje derivan directamente del latín. Los franceses, rumanos, espa?oles, portugueses, italianos, son pueblos latinos.<br>  <br>  Hispano. Los origenes de su lengua y mestisaje derivan directamente de los espa?oles.<br>  <br>  De lo anterior se desprende que todo hispano es latino y no todo latino es hispano.

AA12177460	I have.  About 2 1/2 years ago I started bar tending, and got a new manager.  We flirted and what not and things got physical.  Did I tell you that I was 24 and he was 55?  He made sure I was always good in the pocket and I would in turn cook for him, go out with him (he wanted to show me off) and he could call when ever.  Well this very day we are no longer intimate, but he makes sure I have money in my pocket and I am taken care of.  He is one of my best friends and I can call him when I need anything.

GRY78ihRaa	Your health is always most important!  Surely there are others at your school that do not smoke.  Search out non-smokers to befriend.  Start a non-smokers' group and hold meetings/get-togethers a couple or three times a week, schedule lunch times as a group, etc.  This may also help you to become less shy.  I think you may be surprised at how many non-smokers there are, maybe even be more surprised how many of them are actually looking for non-smoking friends.<br>  Good luck and always put your health first.|`|jmq2i59Jaa	health is most important

Sou mais poderosa que o vento, o sol, a chuva e o frio, juntos.<br>  O vento, que por ali passava, ouvindo isso, triste e ofendido, procurou o sol, a chuva e o frio, para contar o que havia sucedido.<br>  O sol, com todo o  brilho e calor, falou humildemente:<br>  - Sim, ela é mais poderosa do que todos nós, juntos. Juntos, lhe damos calor, alimentamos as suas fontes, lhe damos o que beber, permitimos que se  refresque e alisamos suavemente a sua face, com carinho e amor. E ela, sabe muito bem disso.

A mi, como hombre, me encantaría encontrarme una chica como tú, que esté perdidamente obsesionada conmigo y pues me la llevo a la cama cuantas veces quiera y hasta gratis, al cabo para mí es una aventura, pero como para mí, la mujer es algo sublime y de mucho respeto, me haría sentir cobarde si me aprovechara de una chica así.<br>  Vas a darte cuenta de que en algunas respuestas vas a encontrar algunos que hasta te van a decir bobadas.|`|7cb4105ac4a53f0ec3ed6a0860ab4020aa	sabes q es lo q tienes q hacer para dejar de estar loca es q el te de tu buena clavada y te aseguro q estaras satisfecha y ya no estaras tan regalona jeje|`|8bbd1a45f58b9d2b02bb3bd358c5ba46aa	disfruta el momento.<br>  y  si quieres que eso que sientes se termine, cásate|`|ab0df493313a5168c2b20f6e3aa82abaaa	estas enamorada pero cuidado con caer en la obsesion|`|b9c951a3744e86d7acb849fb33643a58aa	Uppss pues ha de ser que estas superenamorada, pasa muchas veces, pero debes de tranquilizarte y pues si él corresponde a todo pues mejor, pero no lo vayas a empalagar con todo lo que quieres demostrarle tu amor, cuidado ni?a y tambíén disfrutalo, la vida es sólo una y la mejor cosas que te puede ocurrir en ella es el amor.

If you didn't do anything, just try to do something different. Surprise him when he comes home with lingerie or something like that. If you didn't do anything, he still loves you, but you've been together for a period of time that things start slowing down. You're stressed more because of the future growing closer and closer. It's not about you, it's just the natural progression of things. So, if you want attention or even sex, just try something different. Don't stick to routine. If you did do something, however, the only way is to prove that you won't repeat the same mistake. If you cheated on him or something like that, you're going to have to prove you won't do it again, or if he's like me, you won't get a second chance. In the case of cheating or being tempted to cheat, at work or elsewhere, come home and tell your lover about him/her hitting on you, etc, and laugh it off, telling them that the person couldn't be anything compared to who you're with. Hope that helps.|`|3a1e75e205be8ad2f5e1793c1c5e3744aa	im a guy, and 1 thing guys like is not talking, another option is sex, just an option, and dont nag|`|AA10297241	Read Dr. Ruth's book!|`|d44e5a5fbad6ae8bf957dd52352a9f13aa	U can't!

vVkDtWQaaa	The Best way with dealing with something like this talk to the person because my AUNT IS LIKE THAT with me and my cousin and also her sisters. So how do you deal with it talk too your mom and tell her how you feel because that is one thing we had to do with my aunt. Every where someone went she had to know when where what you going for. She just doesn't wanna lose you if your an only child that is why she holds on so tight. Such as my aunt she lost her child at a very young age along with her mother and nephew so she doesn't wanna lose anyone that dear to her. So that is why your mother acts the way she does she doesn't wanna lose you to anything dumb.|`|h8IdQqHgaa	I am a mother of 4 children and my oldest is growing up fast.

JOuomnisaa	Wow, there's a lot of stuff in your question, but here's my answer:<br>  <br>  It sounds like your parents and other members of your family are abusive, nasty people.  It would be in your best interest for you to separate yourself from them.  Australia sounds like it might be far enough away.<br>  <br>  If you go back to school and actually get a degree in something, the chances of your getting a GOOD job AND of making a LOT more in your lifetime are exponentially better!  I don't know why your mother thinks you'll do better in the job market with no degree than you will with one, regardless of your age.  That is simply not true.  There are many people in college who are older than you.  And if you go on to become a CPA, you can do quite well financially.<br>  <br>  I don't know if everyone in Hong Kong is so anti-gay, but if you will be subjected to torment there, you might want to consider moving someplace where homosexuality is more accepted.  You need to be among people who allow you to be yourself.<br>  <br>  As much as I detest most of how your mother treats you, I do think she might have a point about the clubbing.  But then again I can't honestly say I'm into the club scene, so I really don't know.<br>  <br>  By the way, I graduated from college at 22 and then went to law school when I was 28 or 29.  I think the time off was good in terms of making me a better and more motivated student, and I think my being older when I graduated law school actually helped me get a job.<br>  <br>  Finally, I would encourage you to work on your English spelling, grammar and punctuation, as proficiency with the language both written and spoken is certain to help you.  Best of luck to you as you become your own man.<br>  <br>  I|`|TfcxT0zTaa	You decide, is your mother correct or wrong?

Considering that people from a certain race tend to have certain similar features, you may or may not like those features.<br>  <br>  Having said that, I come from a traditional Italian family.  This means when you marry a girl she doesnt just marry you she marries your whole family.  So therefore I would think twice before dating somebody too exotic, or totally different to me.|`|PDuaJlngaa	1/4 of the guys I went out withare Black.Also, yesterday a black guy was hitting on me.but it really depinds who you are|`|AA11141706	oh yeah, as long as she is hawt, it doesnt matter... with a deep facetious undertone.

F3KkB4GWaa	Ignore her. Dont let her run you out of a class you like just because she's being immature. You have no reason to feel awkward. She should feel awkward she's the one acting like a child.|`|mR0N9UW8aa	Wow she seems pretty immature. I had many friends like that. If you change classes she will think she won this 'fight'. All that will do is make things worse. Just ignore her and if she says anything to you just tell her to grow up and be a little bit more mature.|`|FwNDTP5jaa	If you like the class stay in it don't let one person ruin it for you if she really makes you uncomfortable then try thinking of something else
dFHsAXDMaa	well as  a nurse I can tell you that everyone handles grief differently, like my dad for instance when my grandfather died he was like a robot doing what needed to be done all business leaving rest of us to shed the tears, my sisters husband of 25 years died at 44 from colon cancer we all cried for months watching him wither away and all the way through funeral she is 11 yrs older and got married when i was 9 so he was like my own brother, my ddad was once again the rock of the family.... my uncle died my dad brother who I was very close to and i did not shed a tear until about a month later  and during the church service if the funeral my father broked down and lost it he was crying so uncontrollably I was literally sitting there with my arms wrapped around him saying it was gonna be okay for about 20 minutes  i was terrified he was going to have aa heart attack right there in the church he was breathing so hard and quick... we realized that dad my dad was human. <br>  <br>   I hope for yur sake you do not out life your children because buying a child is the hardest thing in the world.... but I truly think we handle emotions and situations as we need to, we knew we could cry when my grandfather and brother in law died  and we did.... we knew deep down that when my uncle died suddenly while planting flowers after just getting home from playing 18 holes of golf my dad was going to need us so we stayed strong for him like he had always done for us<br>  <br>  there is nothing wrong with you and you are right your cousin is no longer suffering and is enjoying heaven and all its glory....|`|qeUoAW6naa	Maybe it all happened rather fast and you have not had time to react. I mean, it probably hasn't quite "sunk in" yet. But wait till it sinks in! Suddenly it's going to hit you so hard, that the tears will fall uncontrollably. May happen days, months, or even years from now.|`|h1lDGNp4aa	I don't think you need to worry about yourself.  I think how much we grieve over the loss of someone depends upon how involved we were with that person in our daily lives & how much we loved that person.  That's why the death of a spouse is ranked as the #1 worst personal life experience.  I can easily see how the loss of a very good friend who is a large part of everyday life would affect someone more than even a parent - if that parent isn't seen all that often.<br>  <br>  When I was 10 my favorite grandfather died & I was devastated.  I remember sobbing. He was a large part of my life then & I used to spend a lot of week-ends at my grandparent's home.  My grandmother died 40 years later & I didn't cry at all.  She was older, her death was expected and although I visited her occasionally she didn't leave a large, unfilled, hole in my life.|`|AA11032586	Some people just have different ways of mourning. Just because you didn't just breakdown and flood the hospital with tears, doesn't make you a bad person or something is wrong with you. I am glad you know he is no longer suffering.

Then at my graduation a year later it really hit me and I cried every night for about a month.|`|Eu0AdnjKaa	I am so sorry for your losses in the past year. It is never easy losing a loved one. As for the grief and cry: everyone goes through it differently. For myself, I didn't cry until the funeral or after it. Everyone goes through different things and it's okay to feel sad, happy, numb...etc....<br>  No emotion is off limits when you are grieving for someone you loved.|`|LU7yg6Ejaa	u probably werent that close...dont worry over it....ya hard *** lol joke!..seriously dont worry about it|`|YTr2RVdXaa	you're stupid! dont be hurt, just amit it to yourself|`|h8IdQqHgaa	So normal.  We just lost an aunt a few weeks ago and I didn't cry.  I knew her pretty well, but after a week or so it hit me that she was gone.  It usually takes awhile for it to hit some people.  My bestfriend lost her dad and she didn't cry until a year later when she realize that he was not coming back..   It's normal don't stress about it people take things different.

Contudo acho que você deu bobeira ao n?o ter tentado conquistá-la antes ou mesmo ter se declarado!<br>  Entretanto vale lembrar que o fato de ela ter um filho n?o significa que você deva assumí-lo como pai, pagar as contas dele...etc. Sua quest?o é com ela e sua consciência: se  você a aceita ou n?o agora que ela tem um filho de outro cara! Claro que o fato de a mesma ter um filho implicará em mais cuidado e aten??o com essa crian?a, impossibilidade de fazer alguns passieos, viagens... Contudo, vale a pena tentar até porque pelo que você relatou, sua consciência também te tortura por você num ter tentado falar sobre isso com ela. E além do mais, o amor que n?o vivemos ele será lembrado para sempre! Talvez por n?o termos experienciado essa rela??o ela nos passa a imagem de que seria tudo lindo, perfeito! E quando a vivenciamos as vezes ela apenas se torna uma lembran?a boa.<br>  Por isso, acho que você deveria procurá-la contar essa linda história pois acho que ela iria se derreter e vocês se n?o ficarem juntos a vida interia podiam ao menos curtir uns bons momentos, afinal, se n?o der certo é só terminar e você ainda tem uma vantagem: o filho nem é seu, n?o vai precisar de pens?o, preocupa??o, nada!

sod4Kqxyaa	Well try to notice things about her. Like her clothes and accessories . She if she likes anything you do and if so try to sit by her. Talk to her about those things . Common ground is a good place to start . Or if you have any of the same friends try to hang out all together.|`|6Nj5VZQ8aa	Just start by saying Good morning or Hi every time you see her, then start conversation IF she has been smiling back to you.|`|AA11266289	maybe its different where you live but girls dont usually go out with guys in younger grades....<br>  <br>  at least where i live...|`|AA12116854	By year 6 I'm presuming you are in what used to be called "junior high" school or middle school. You might want to try and either sit next to her and start a simple conversation (don't start by asking her out, you may freak her out) about school, "I've got so and so for math, english, whatever class--do you have him/her..." or "I can hardly wait til I can drive to get off this bus..." something simple like that. If you are uncomfortable just dropping down next to her and talking, you might just make eye contact with her and smile every time you get on the bus or she does. That might even be a better approach, since you'll both gradually feel more and more comfortable with each other.<br>  That's all I can tell you.<br>  It's not like I am the relationship queen.|`|Uwn8jvx3aa	well  you should try to sit close to her. And smile at her. Then the next day or something say hi to her. After that smile more at her and say hi. Then you can approach her and say hi. You can ask her what grade she's in ( even tho you already know) ask her her name, introduce yourself and talk to her. Thats it. Thats all you gotta do.|`|griwMyO6aa	Go up and pretend like you saw her someone were else. Like at the mall. Then when she says she didn't see you or go there just be like "Oh I guess it was someone else" then compliment her and if she seems like she wants to talk then start conversaton. Like ask her how old she is even if you already know.

Then say my name is ...... and I see you everyday and never have the courage to talk to you, but today I finally have the courage to say I think you are beautiful and I am sorry that we both have to take this stupid bus.  Then say..No I'm not a stalker and move to another seat.  She will probably giggle and remember you always.  Then the next time you see her you can just say hi:) Well that's if she still will take the same bus. Risk It All!|`|rKeGwW84aa	Sit across where she's sitting.<br>  Be like " Hey, how's it going?

So they do it and it's considered "normal", it's expected, and later they do it because they believe it attracts guys or is just a way to be presentable. Same reason guys wear the same cologne as their Dads and can't wait to shave their faces as soon as they have peach fuzz :)<br>  <br>   It's not weird, I'm talking about when you were a kid, shaving with a pretend razor in the mirror!|`|Wm1JL4ETaa	Dumb

jXydrX3maa	what ever,,worry bout somthin else|`|r1IWKjFxaa	I'd probably say he needs time to cool down first... if you try talking to him right now he's gonna be extremely pissy.

In your case I guess you could just tell him to shave an inch or two deeper next time.  Just ideas =P

I think the safest way to do it is to tell him you are attracted to him (you can soften by saying "starting to get attracted..."<br>  <br>  If you guys haven't really hung out before, why not just ask him to do something on the weekend? Much easier to do and if he declines, there you go.|`|0Z6tzFZ5aa	This is what i would do. i would <br>  a) text him and say "hey this may be kinda weird but i like you"<br>  <br>  or <br>  <br>  B)go up to him at school and say hey can i talk to you...i like you<br>  <br>  <br>  he will probably be happy that somebody likes him. most people are. i have done that in the past. i hope everything works out. good luck!|`|ntYEImPlaa	i think you should tell him after class, this way if he doesn't like you back it won't be that akward. maybe he likees you back. you could either go up to him and tell him you're self, or you could always just text it to him.|`|6sYCeXNgaa	ask him if he sees you as just a friend then tell him that you've just really been feeling him lately the best advice i could give is just be honest with him don't get scared tomorrow TELL HIM!!!!!!|`|BNDCjydNaa	yea definitely steer clear from school if you're telling someone you think him or her.  your best bet is hanging out outside of school and letting whatever happens happen|`|NvJzUipvaa	Say that every night you imagine his genitals are twice as big as they really are, 2 cm|`|PW13AMKLaa	take some time out together and say confidently|`|FbaLbvIzaa	If I were you I would do it privately and tell him the truth.

Youre young, get away from him and never look back. You have plenty of time to find someone. Find a good guy. Also get some counseling for your self esteem issues.|`|QkMyhHkaaa	I think that you already know the truth...just Trust in YOURSELF more.<br>  Answer this question: Will _____ hit me again ? Answer? _________<br>  I think the answer is yes, he will. I understand that you have a history with him...but, the more you step back from him, the more you WILL discover your inner strengths. <br>  This seems to be the "norm" for his family (from how his parents act about it) but it should not be the norm for you..or anybody else!<br>  Get away, find who YOU are and flourish from there.<br>  P.S. While you are moving on with your life, keep a secret journal and record any activity that happens with this guy, don't ever hesitate to call for help...911. Everything will be documented and you will have your journal to back it up.|`|lY2XI8kUaa	he probably will do it again. unless he has been through counseling then you should stay away from him. you deserve someone who will treat you right and that will never put his hands on you in an abusive way.|`|1neMZoRLaa	just dump the asshole|`|AA12184732	ok first off..he is never going to stop unless you put him in jail..then he might learn his lesson..but sometimes they never do..i was in an abusive relationship for two years i had restraining orders on him but he keep breaking them ..he got so crazy he went to my job to choke me so i called the cops but he hung up the phone..so when i got home i went to the police station and told them they arrested him that night and ever since then he finally left me alone..im still going to court its been almost 3 years..but im glad i got ride of him..im nolonger abused and maybe you should get away from him..he will not change ..why suffer??|`|8LfW9tBxaa	i think that if youguys move in together again, most likely he will do it.<br>  but maybe he might just altogether stop because he hasnt done it in a while.<br>  im really sorry about that, if someone hit me i wouldnt date them anymore thats real scary but if you really love them i guess there is an exception.|`|Ux8ei5i5aa	GET OUT NOW!!!!!!!!!|`|EdDLydH7aa	There are so many red flags here I can barely see, if he hasn't hit you lately, it does not mean that he won't ever do it again, im sure he promised never to do it again and did it again, just b/c he hasn't lately doesn't mean he never will again, you aren't a punching bag, like you said, you are still young, DV is not a sign of maturity, it's a sign of control, get out now, before it's too late and he really hurts you bad the next time, i know it hurts and is painful, but be strong and get out..good luck to you|`|nlub7M5Uaa	He has probably stopped hitting you because you have moved out. I have been throught the same senario and I am 24, I have been with my bf for 6 years, I can say that he did give me a fat lip 3 years ago and the last time he hit me was 1 year ago but I hit him right back he is 6'2 and I am 5'5 so it was strange but I had to stand my ground. It can get better, my bf has changed with a lot of communication and me telling him I will leave scared him enough to not want to lose me. It is a hard circumstance because no man should EVER hit his gf, wife sister whoever. For your safety it is a good thing you moved. It is likely that he will do it again. Counseling will help in couples counseling. I am still afraid when we get into fights but I do not let it get to that intense level as I once had, we now can talk and not scream. I have had crazy fights throwing Ac units and laundry baskets dishes you name it, cars "yeah" crazy. It depends on how much you love this man and are willing to grow together to make it work, with out communication you have nothing. Sometimes when I get into a heated argument I step back and take 2 days for myself and get my hair, nails and my thoughts prioritized. I hope this helps. Good luck :o)|`|yZ6pqaK2aa	He will do it again, I 100% guarentee it. I grew up around nothing but violent and I'm telling you... they're all the same. They can be loving and sweet one moment and then choke you to the point it should be considered attempted murder. This guy is luckly I'm not around, just reading about this makes me want to kill him. I hope one day you go crazy on him and beat him to a pulp or better yet, leave him and have a happy, NORMAL life because what you're experiencing right now is extremely abnormal and unhealthy. You can tell where he gets it from since his family does nothing about it. Clearly his father is abusive to his mother. Is that where you want to see yourself in the future? He has no respect for you... he sees you as the equivalent of an object (one that he can use to gain pleasure, control, do whatever he wants to do). I'm 10,000000000% sure you can do much, much better than this guy. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.domesticviolence.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.domesticviolence.org/</a>
AA11399706	Whoa, never heard those assumptions before. <br>  Well, here are few of mine:<br>  1) the way the guy dresses. <br>    You know, the usual sterotypes.. <br>     skater, rocker, prep, gangster.. lol.<br>  2) If a guy dosent carry around a backpack at school=dosen't care much about academics. (unless he's carrying a folder or something)<br>  <br>  Wow, I really can't think of much. <br>  I  mean, everyone assumes about anyone. <br>  guys do too on girls! <br>  It just depends on each person :)
5e649a60671c3f378aff9d398a09b6c1aa	Most people think the way to a stripper's pussy is with money, buying lap dance after lap dance, throwing stacks of singles on stage as they dance, and surprising them with expensive gifts. Those people are idiots. "Marks,"; as the girls call them. Someone to be siphoned until not one drop of cash is left.  <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  There is only one surefire way to pull a stripper and it has nothing to with personality or money (although those things don't hurt). The secret is DRUGS.<br>  <br>  Contrary to what many pro-stripper films and documentaries tell you, 9 out of 10 strippers are on drugs of some sort.* Be it coke, dust, weed, pills, booze, if a girl's job is to climb up on stage and spread her gash for a bunch of sweaty, over-weight mutts in ill-fitting work clothes you'd better believe it takes a certain type of courage that can only be had from illegal substances. Knowing that, the key to making a needy young sex kitten your slave for the night (or the week) is to always be holding. But you have to make sure you're carrying the right stuff for the type of stripper you're trying to bang. It just so happens that this whole thing can be broken down racially. Along with the genetic yarns that make a woman a certain color go these little strands that decide their drug proclivities. Don't freak out—I didn't write the rules here. God did. I just follow them.<br>  <br>  WHITE STRIPPERS (BLONDE)<br>  White chicks love coke. It's as simple as that. Any stripper worth sticking your dick in is between the ages of 18-28, meaning they were born between 1976 and 1986, which makes their moms either 70s disco coke whores or 80s yuppie coke sluts. Either way, the coke slut gene has been inherited by their daughter. When she asks if you'd like a lap dance, respond: "No, I want to get out of here and do some blow. What time are you done tonight?"; That's usually enough to get you in, but for added emphasis it helps to pull her to the side, dump some powder on your fist and give it to her to prove you're for real. (Don't buy beat ****. Strippers who love coke know coke. You're not getting anywhere with **** that's been stepped on ten times.)<br>  <br>  WHITE STRIPPERS (TATTOOED AND/OR WITH PUNK HAIRCUTS) <br>  This is a somewhat trickier bunch to read because they like pills and saying someone "likes pills"; is like saying someone "likes music."; You've got to either roll the dice on a narrow spectrum of possibilities (uppers, downers, psyche, or pain) or you can be smart and invest in a smorgasbord of pharmaceuticals and have all your bases covered. There's nothing worse than sparking a girl's interest only to learn she likes Xanax and you've got a pocket full of Ritalin. Pretend that you're going fishing and you've got an empty tackle box. You're going to need a little of everything: lures, bobbers, hooks, etc. Pills are inexpensive ($5-$8 a pop), so see if you can work out a deal with your man on a variety bottle. At that price you shouldn't think twice about pissing them away. Offer a blue to the first girl you see. If she takes it, she'll go and tell the other girls. Give 10mg to each and every girl in the club. 10 strippers = 10 pills = 50 bucks. No big deal. If you have enough to get each girl high on the job, one of those girls is going to have enough brains to realize you've probably got more. She'll be the one to ask you, "What are you doing later?";<br>  <br>  BLACK STRIPPERS<br>  The black stripper is difficult to snare, especially for a white male. Their drug of choice, weed, is the cheapest drug on the market and easiest to obtain. This makes them the most affordable ****, but you're white and you have to compensate. That's where things get expensive. Don't freak out, it's still completely doable. First, start by tipping. Don't go crazy. Just a dollar or two here and there to let her know you're interested. This will automatically put you ahead of any black patrons in the club because it is well documented that black males do not tip at strip clubs.** Your next move is to have better than average weed. Like flowers, girls like weed that smells nice. It helps to tell them that it's from your boy's crop, and has been featured on the cover of High Times three times and it's Redman and Snoop's favorite weed. It's important that this lie and the two following lies be convincing: "Yeah, I know Snoop,"; and "Next time he's in town, I'll introduce you."; That should take of it. For added effect I like to lie and say I make beats and ask them if they want to go over to my studio after they get off work. This helps to both sell the con and save money on hotel rooms. Be sure to know where a local recording studio is. A cheap one is between $75 and $150 an hour, which is cheaper than taking her to a nice hotel. Be sure to bring the new Usher CD and when her favorite song comes on tell her you made the beat. Then turn one of the knobs on that big mixing board thing in front of you.<br>  <br>  OTHER STRIPPERS<br>  That is correct, I am going to lump together all Asian, Latin, Paki, Euro strippers, along with anything else that might have just come off the boat and amputees. This category is really your best bet, especially Euro girls, because all they want is to be loved and taken care of and what drug emits more love than Ecstasy? The reality is you could give them mescaline and they'd take it without caring.*** A key with foreigners is to make them feel welcome in America. This is accomplished by telling them you don't detect an accent, that they speak great English and that you basically understand and agree with whatever they are saying regardless of the fact that you can only make out every fourth word. To do this convincingly, you must practice. Go to your stereo and put on some rap music that you can't understand the lyrics to (most any rap will work), turn up the volume just slightly, then go into your bathroom and shut the door. You should not be able to easily hear more than reverb and bass. Stare dead in the mirror, strain your ears and try to decipher the lyrics without looking unsure, without creasing your forehead and pursing your eyes.  If you can convince your mind that you know every lyric to that Ghostface song, using only your eyes and facial expressions, you'll be able win any foreigner over, completely negating their self-consciousness. Using drugs as bait, of course.<br>  <br>  Before you go running to your phone to cop there are a few more things you need to be aware of when trying to run this kind of game. First, and most importantly, is that you don't ever do the drugs. If you're an addict don't even bother because you'll always take the drugs over the girl and might even get arrested for beating a girl for touching your **** without asking. You can get high all you want when she's gone but while you're with her you have to pretend to inhale, go take a piss when your turn to bang a rail comes around, throw the pill over your shoulder and pretend to pop it. Sounds lame but you need to have full control over the situation. I'm telling you from experience, strippers are cunning, any sign of weakness and you'll wake up without your pants, your wallet and your drugs. Secondly, realize you only get one shot of pulling them out of the club. If it doesn't happen that night, it doesn't happen. Don't play yourself by giving your number and don't take a number. Consider it a failed attempt and go home and get high. Lastly, and I can't stress this enough, don't let them know where you live. If you can, take them to a hotel (or the studio). If you've blown all your money on the drugs and are forced to take them back to your place, take the most ridiculously ****** up route ever to get there. Then after you're done with them, give some more drugs to fry their brain a little more and put them right in cab and send them on their way (instructing the driver to use an alternate, more confusing route.). As a child you had a great many dreams of things you wanted in your lifetime, and I'm pretty sure that a drug-hungry whore knocking on your door at 4 in the morning was not one of them.|`|832e8cafea63c171fc089cc6874145cdaa	TIP HER $$$$$$$$$$$$$$|`|9a734c12c8a5bcbcb7f973ccdc4ed0eaaa	if you want to talk to a stripper the only language they speak is crisp currency.  so if you have something to say say it with benjamins|`|AA12342510	write it down on a $20, $50 or $100 bill.|`|525b9a11612b4053e49d02858c8051daaa	its none of my buisiness but i wouldnt  advise u 2 do any of the above/ dont do dat **** fool|`|6ab82b55783dcdb399a68332e23489b9aa	You in love with a stripper!

It doesn't mean that if you guys got to know each other at a deeper level that you wouldn't have something more. You never know until you try. Is there any way you can move past this petty flirtation and onto a more meaningful relationship or friendship? Get to know each other more and then you'll see if you really connect at all or if this is just going nowhere.

I am also a nurse  and i would say tell your sister you were itching yourself.... and you were really itchy that was why you were taking a bath.And should your parents happen to question you tell them the same thing.... next time lock the bathroom door and as a nurse I will tell you masturbation is total normal and in this day and age it is truly the only save sex, with all the STDs and HIV. do christians believe it is immoral and a sin yes. but it is better than the bigger sin of premartial sex and all part of exploring your own sexuality and body.... girls who never look at their vagina in a mirror never know when it looks abnormal or there is something wrong that needs a doctors atttention right?|`|AA11032586	Your parents are right, that is immoral. Why would you be doing that anyway? Is there not a lock on the door? I think your 6 year old sister should be explained what it is, in front of your parents.

Wo5Ezmwiaa	Follow your gut. From what you wrote, however, I'd have to say he's into you. And not using you. If he was using you, he wouldn't bother going the extra mile to tell you  how special you are to him, and how much he enjoys talking to you. If a guy was using you, he'd mainly focus on the "benefits" part. But if he really takes the time to have conversations with you, share secrets with you, and open up to you, then he probably isn't using you. However, if he's really sleazy and you know it, and you can tell he just sugar coats things so he can get more "benefits" from you, then drop him like a bad habit. Like I said, I can't say for sure since I don't know the guy, so maybe ask your friends their opinions of him, and in the end - follow your gut. Your gut feelings are usually right.

UotHmPaFaa	I had the same problem before, i really liked my best friend, but never got to date her. The funny thing is i'm kinda glad because being a best friend to someone can sometimes mean more then a relationship if you know what i'm talking about. Plus in a relationship things most likely start to get weird and then things might happen. After that relationship might ruin and friendship might end. So it better to just a a best friend and be there for her all the time then date her and have that risk of losing her.|`|nLeJJ5nMaa	create distance. dont see her again|`|1BJKxu09aa	It's normal when you're a teenage girl, even if you're straight, for you to develop crushes and feel attracted to other girls. Most often people you feel close with, ie Best Friends, because you just think that they're amazing and you care so much about them. Totally normal. Don't worry.|`|oh4B8EoOaa	say be my gf or get out of my life, seriously DO IT|`|2Ao3VXDeaa	sounds like she doesnt think you are good enough for her.  change that

BgVWSApdaa	It sounds like you have a good handle on the situation. I admire you for not wanting to take a guy's girl from him.  It shows you have class.  You're right - just wait until next fall and see what happens.  In the meantime, be fun, kind and confident but be your own man - don't be clingy or nervous around her.  And then just wait it out.  If you're meant to date her, you will.  I wish you the best.|`|beTBfCkTaa	well i would say that you should just wait til they break up...but don't try to get them to break up.<br>  if you would never do that, then you should try to get over her.|`|5sBpkeUEaa	Well, if you're his friend, and you truly like her, although this may seem hard, you can't come between their relationship or try to steal her away.  Sorry.  If it's meant to happen it will.  Just play it cool.  Stay friends with both of them.  If they break up for good, wait a while and ask the guy if it'd be cool with him.  Just play it cool, and DONT get in the way of their relationship for now.  If it's suppose to happen it will, so enjoy the ride.  :-)|`|6oZcHIjiaa	First of all, if they have already broken up once or more than once, then they are more likely going to break up again. The thing you need to watch out for is being the rebound guy if they do break up again and youre there to "catch" her. Also Im glad that you would never cheat. That is always a good thing.|`|28IB6U2paa	You answered your own question.<br>  <br>  Wait until they break up if you don't want to cause any trouble.|`|jRl43824aa	find another girl for a girlfriend atleast for now. Maybe you are just infatuated to this girl. It might wear off over time|`|Bmv4t2l1aa	The best thing you can do is let their relationship run its course. If you have let your feelings for her to be known to her and she has not accepted or reciprocated your feelings, then she may not be ready to give up on here current relationship. This is your senior year and I am sure that their is someone that has been eying you from afar, but you have not even given a second glance. Have fun, be open to dating other girls, and give someone else a chance because you might just find someone you just click with. Also at the end of the day if it is meant for you and the girl you are interested in to be together it will happen effortlessly.

0FXVTZf7aa	Don't bother with abstinence, learn why premarital sex is not a sin.  I send my Christian friends to the website below because it debunks the whole thing against premarital sex in the Bible.  It's cheaper than a Purity Ring and a lot more fun than abstinence.

But you got into this, so do what you are suppose to do as well as what your husband has every reason to expect you to do as the woman who agreed to be his wife.|`|wE89mPZ3aa	First of all you have a new baby and going through a lot of changes so you may feel really stressed so you need to sit down and think about what you really want.  It is easier when both parents are there especially at first but if you need some time you need to talk to him and tell him how you are feeling. Just make sure this is what you want and it is not just the stress of being a new mom.  You may need to talk to your doctor and let him know how you are feeling. Make sure it is not hormones that is making you feel this way and think about if you will be happier alone.|`|ohIvx6rkaa	Maybe you just need a holiday. Got family you can go stay with for a while?<br>  If you need time apart because you think you have problems, this WON'T help.<br>  You need to sort them out BEFORE you run away from them.<br>  But if your just stressed out. Then leave your daughter in his care and take a holiday by your self.<br>  Go to the beach....go stay in a hotel and relax...anything to de-stress.<br>  I have been down that road...but the end result of saying "we need some time apart' never works out how you think it will. It always back-fires.<br>  Just say you need a week holiday to de-stress. Say your doctor told you to go!<br>  Good luck with everything...but remember, don't say you want time apart...cos he might take it as a break up! <br>  My ex partner did...so yeah :/|`|efDvTjJSaa	wh do you need time apart?<br>  you have a 4month old its a really stressful time are you sure? have you thought about maybe spending the week at your parents or somthing, i mean i dont know whats going on for you but a 4month old puts huge pressure i have a 1 year old and  it wasnt long ago when everything was going crazy but its settled now<br>  <br>  <br>  but to answer your actual question you need to tell him where your going<br>  why your going<br>  and how long your going for|`|AA11391968	I won't judge you.  However, be careful what you wish for.  If your mind is made up, then simply tell him why you will need time apart and then answers his questions.|`|WT5tYLdfaa	seperation...

gTfIQaHcaa	Hey, sounds like you're on a tight schedule. However, I've got a few suggestions for you that should be easy to set up quickly as they're colours that can be easily found. You could pick any of these according to what kind of feel/atmosphere you want.<br>  <br>  1. Lilac. Lilac is like a blend of purple and blue, in a mid-to-light shade. You can get dark lilac shades but the general lightness is medium to pale. Here's a good example:<br>  <a href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/232/523879112_86f96ffb8d.jpg?v=0" rel="nofollow">http://farm1.static.flickr.com/232/52387...</a><br>  Lavender and mid-purple go really well with this colour, and so do pale greens. This is a very good colour scheme if you want a summery/spring kind of feel to the wedding (even if it is in winter!)<br>  <br>  2. Pink. There's two ways you can go here: rich pink or pale pink. <br>  Rich pink should be like this:<br>  <a href="http://www.classicroses.co.uk/gfx/media/home/rosey/yolandedaragon300.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.classicroses.co.uk/gfx/media/...</a><br>  Pale pink should be like this:<br>  <a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3027/2616945105_464cd6df3a.jpg?v=0" rel="nofollow">http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3027/2616...</a><br>  <br>  With rich pink, strong fresh green colours complement it the best and create a lively, vibrant feel. This is great no matter what time of year!<br>  With pale pink, pastel colours like light purple, light green, light aqua, light blue and light yellow go very well with it and make for a gentle, relaxed atmosphere. I would recommend this for winter as it make the room feel warmer and larger.<br>  <br>  3. Blue. Blue in nearly any shade I wouldn't recommend for June, as blues are generally a cool/cold colour and will most likely emphasise the coldness of winter. However, if you choose a warm sky blue like this:<br>  <a href="http://digitalart.id3as.com/d/98-3/wIMG_2174.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://digitalart.id3as.com/d/98-3/wIMG_...</a><br>  you should be able to pull it off. I'd try to balance this colour with aqua or warm green if I were you, just to be on the safe side. This colour does have a lovely ambience and if it is just the right shade can produce a very comfortable feeling.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  Good luck :)|`|sMUiGFPraa	Wow um that's not a lot of time. Pool Blue or Tiffany blue is very popular right now. you could also use yellow. or the right shade of both would work well. good luck.|`|X6YY0OS6aa	what about a mint green <br>  <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/98528329@N00/2241921356" rel="nofollow">http://flickr.com/photos/98528329@N00/22...</a><br>  the cake<br>  <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/glassslippergourmet/2160959153/" rel="nofollow">http://flickr.com/photos/glassslippergou...</a>|`|JtEBaOdjaa	what does your daughter's last name have to do with a colour? <br>  You should go back to school with her.<br>  1. it's "my boyfriend and I"<br>  2. "...thought of it BECAUSE OUR daughter..."<br>  3. "year" not "yr"<br>  4. "I" is always capitalized<br>  5. "can't" not "cant"<br>  6. Have you ever heard of a run-on sentence?<br>  <br>  Go with blue. Why? Because you can't report me if I answer your question.|`|CLJXTsFJaa	Hey there,  <br>  <br>  You don't have much time for planning. <br>  <br>  Where abouts are you?  What season will you be in?  That might help you with colors.  If summer I would go with something  like a black dress with yellow trimmings and have your bridesmaid/s in yellow dresses with black trimmings very pretty.  Flower girl could have a white dress with yellow trimmings.  <br>  <br>  Color themes:<br>  Black Yellow White   Summer<br>  Black Pink White      Spring<br>  Black Red White       Autumn/fall<br>  Black Blue White      Winter<br>  <br>  Instead of white you could have silver <br>  <br>  My sisters wedding theme colors were white, pink and black and that was lovely <br>  <br>  Some are going for aqua at the moment.  It's your day and your day is special so get married in your most favorite color or the colour that suits you best.  <br>  <br>  I am getting married in a tri colored dress.  Red black and white.  Brides maids will be in black dresses with white over lace and back ties and flower girls in white dresses with red over lace and back ties.  <br>  <br>  best men will be in black suits with white ties so are same color as bridesmaids.  <br>  <br>  Best of luck and congratulations.|`|aipChC3haa	I would go with yellow and white.<br>  And then for party favors you could give out lemon drops.<br>  You could have a white dress, and your bridesmaids could wear yellow dresses.<br>  <br>  You don't have a lot of time to plan, why don't you just do it next year?|`|a3c13d4cdf788003b0ae24e78a24028caa	YOU SHOULD JUST LOOK COLORFUL AND JUST WORRY ABOUT UR WEDDING NOT UR DAUGHTER SHE'LL LVE U IN EITHER COLOR
UIi1DPlbaa	As I understand, he claims that the lady in his bedroom was a friend from his work--that claim is easily verifyable. You can ask him to introduce you to that woman. If she is indeed his friend with no romantic involvement, he should have no problem introducing you. If he refuses to do that, but continues to claim that she is just a friend, I would say there are good reasons not to trust him.|`|fMfOen5Iaa	i think the answer is pretty simple here, no matter how much it hurts...dont' trust him he is just going to make you look the fool whether it is now or in months to come. Move on...you can do better
EP3N26mIaa	talk to her and tell her how you feel. say you want a second chance.
AA11429880	Neither, I find men who don't have to prove their manhood by fighting attractive.|`|abd61d29705e6a5944027692706b0090aa	neither what if their both ugly???|`|384c09de283f926b5dfaf4abda06be65aa	the tall skinny guy|`|4712f79c3b66a688114af1fc7e707671aa	Okay, first of all, stupid question.<br>  A guy who has to prove himself by fighting with another guy, for a woman who may or may not like him, is an ***.<br>  <br>  The guy who puts the guy into the painful hold is probably a jerk, and would only think about himself, and the guy who got put into the hold, would only gripe about how he lost.<br>  <br>  A guy should never havve to fight another guy for a girl.  EVER.  The girl would already have the perfect guy, thus neither of the two fighting would get her anyways.|`|wsWAVcD3aa	Neither one
jBvKBrMEaa	Linny chuckles at the above answers, adorable but still not quite correct. ^_~<br>  <br>  Rick, the important thing to weigh in this scale is your friend's feelings. Try to guess how he will feel if he finds out about such a tryst. Would he hate you? Do you want to lose a friend? Also keep in mind there is a chance that the apple of your eye may not appreciate your advances, and you could lose both "friends".<br>  <br>  Keep those points in mind, run a bit of risk assessment yourself, and try to plot the right course based on what your soul seeking tells you. <br>  <br>  So, them are the odds. Best of luck to you, kiddo! ^_~|`|mDMnhqwdaa	How would you feel if your friend tried,did, or want to sleep with your mom? i'm sure you'd be upset and so would he.

AA12393776	Since you and she have been together for two years now, it is time to consider marriage.  And probably soon, within the next 6 months.  No reason anymore to delay. You have had that delay.<br>  <br>  I have always had a great respect for any couple who wanted to wait for marriage. I do think it wrong push her towards sex with what you have already said above.<br>  <br>  Most of the sex therapists mention that sometimes coitus is a letdown for a couple who have "done pretty much anything leading up to that"   You may not know that, but you and she are already experiencing most  if not all of the experiences of being sexual.<br>  <br>  I do hope you can continue to deepen your relationship.  And I do think marriage would be a good next step for you and her.|`|8aa2f76f19d65cc5bc682422bda1ee49aa	You don't want to push her, that would be a mistake.  She doesn't sound like she is ready to take the relationship farther from what you said...............    not yet anyway/<br>  <br>   I am sure you both will know when the time is right. You can always bring up the subject though; it wouldn't hurt.|`|J3JClsuQaa	I don't think you're an idiot male, : )  It sounds like you are being very respectful.  I think you just have to talk with her more about it.  Maybe she is scared, maybe she's afraid it will change things, maybe she's waiting for marriage...?  Ya just have to talk more, see what's going on... That's all I have, hope it helps.  : )|`|kwLtNP1Raa	"Am I an idiot male just like anyone else and letting my junk think for me?"<br>  yes maybe<br>  <br>  have you even asked her straight up if she actually wants to have sex or not? because it looks like you're conversations lead toward sex but not directly.<br>  <br>  not everyone believes in sex before marriage|`|JtQvOLqkaa	"Is it wrong to push her?" Yes.|`|Wi97GrVVaa	You're naturally curious, because obviously we WANT sex. Your girlfriend, as I did, sees sex as a big deal. It means she isn't going to do it until she is absolutely SURE she wants to. It doesn't mean she doesn't want to do it with YOU, it just means she doesn't want to do ti right now.<br>  <br>  If you do it with her too soon, you will regret it. While you want to have sex, you cannot pressure her, or you'll lose her. Yes, it would be wrong to push her to do it, and as I said, you will regret it, and so will she, on a much deeper level than you imagine. You don't want to cause her that kind of regret.|`|NfE70Vr8aa	Your not an idiot male. Everyone thinks about sex. It is completely understandable to want to take things to another level especially since you two have been together for so long. Try and talk to her again, let her know that you are serious and that you two will take every preventative precaution. Whatever you do, do not push or pressure her into it. That will just make things 10x worse for you. Just talk to her.|`|eBEfZO9eaa	Two years is a long time to be with someone and not have sex, but you don't say how young you are.  I say regardless, don't rush it, wait until you are BOTH ready. If you press the issue, and she agrees she may regret it afterwards because she felt you pressured her.  Then your relationship could be over.  And, above all, if and when you do have sex, use protection and have safe sex.|`|TIGfdEhfaa	yeah it is wrong to push her! As a girl I know women think of sex as something xtremely special beyond what any guy would think of it as. So the one question u have to ask urself is , is ur relationship strong enough for a kid. Or disease. Or a KID! A crying pooping screaming baby! What's wrong with u!|`|T6Dgmxmoaa	Yeah, you should talk to her about it. I think I would explode if I didn't have sex with my boyfriend after two whole years of dating. Is she waiting until marriage? Because that's a whole other issue.|`|1H2L0ysdaa	Just think if ur "junk" gets her pregnant  would you be ready to commit to being a daddy??? BTW girls hate guys who act with their *****!! so just think! Do u wanna be a daddy? most guys dont want to at their age but thats just u!|`|2QbnUwnBaa	It really depends on how old yall both are.|`|nnaqMgYRaa	age?|`|pZxeStPpaa	I personally see "sex" not as lust or for fun. But for love! My bf and i have been together for a yr and before it was like for lust and love and now its like "love". Two people in a realtionship have sex to express there love for each other...to show each other how much they mean to you. It will def bring a boost to a realtionship, but if ur gf is kinda of unsure about it..then wait until she feels it is time. Trust me it is the best when two people are in love..deep love do it. It brings out a completely new meaning and brings the two people closer together.|`|EDYETUNCaa	If you pressure her to much, she might leave you or feel that sex is all you're after. Yeah, my bf would say you're thinking with you junk. Depending on your age, why don't you propose to her and get married. that way you all can have sex .... sex is huge. You're gf is right to feel that way.|`|zO59ezH3aa	Well if she is a virgin then it will be akward after sex but no ur junk is not thinking for u it's a natural feeling just ask her "is there a posibillity we could try to have sex. "|`|XnIkIwY3aa	Idiot Male.<br>  <br>  Just wait for her to be ready, if you have to persuade her how special/intimate will it really be then.|`|SHr3Javsaa	Hello,<br>  <br>  When I came across this post it caught my eye. I am glad that you have found someone very special. This is a very exciting thing. In reguards to your question, I would like to give you my advice. I personally would not advance to sex yet. Seeing how you are both young, you have an exciting life ahead of you. I know that you mentioned that you were a virgin, but I am unsure if she is. Sex carries a huge responsibility, it can bring about the possibility of STD's, children, and possibly emotional baggage. Seeing how young you are, this may and may not be your spouse to be. In the case that this is not, you may bring emotional hurt into the life of another woman. Even if this is going to be your love for life, waiting until you are married brings about some exciting benefits.<br>  <br>  My suggestion is that you enjoy the love that you have with this person now and continue to spend time together, but save sex for the realm of marriage.
VRSUyeqbaa	He is a violent. You need to get out now. Call the police, women's shelter, a trusted friend and they can help. They never change, they say they will, but it never happens, I spent 10 years with a man who made such promises, before i wised up and left him....he is not good for you or your children. Please seek help.|`|wpi36XBAaa	You are only wrong in accepting this sort of behavior from a man who is supposed to love and protect you, not be the cause of your pain. <br>  He lies too. The courts will not take the children from you because you seek help from the authorities. That he is just saying to keep you tied to him. He doesn't want you getting help because HE KNOWS he is the one in the wrong here. He knows he stands to lose you and the children because of what he chooses to do. You might want to blame the drinking, but he is the oone who chooses to drink.<br>  To protect yourself and your children, go to the authorities and report this. Get it on official record. <br>  You may trust in God. Ask him now to give you the strength to find the acceptance that you do need to get out of there now. Ask him for the strength to believe in your inalienable rights as a human being, to live in a safe home. Ask him for the strength to protect those children from this sort of life. Then when you are safe, pray for the soul of an addict - your husband's love is not with God, it is with the source of his addiction - the alcohol.|`|wE89mPZ3aa	If he will not get help for the drinking then leave.  If he abuses you now then it will not get better it will get worse.  You need to get out and tell him to get help and if he does then work it out but you need to think about your kids because he is doing this to you now but he may do it to the kids if he keeps drinking. You could end up getting hurt or worse and then what would happen to your kids?|`|q7GBzr6yaa	Call the womens shelter! He more inlikely has to loose you for a while to change!

When he gets drunk and hits you, get out of the house with your children and then call the police.  The police will not take your children from you. They will arrest your husband.  There is hope for your husband if he gets sober and joins Alcoholics Anonymous.  If he refuses to get help your marital problems will only get worse and your children's safety will be jeopardized.  Encourage your husband to seek help and in the meantime, you should seek help as well from a Women's Support Group.

If you think your life is in danger or he will come after you when he gets out of jail they are safe havens for women and children who are abused the police would know youre local shelter, also youre local social service agency would have good resources if you want to leave.He could go to anger management classes and go to AA for drinking,  because he should not hit you. With most abuse its a cycle that does not stop until you are out of the situation. He has to want to change himself.Theres lots of resources for abuse and achool
0DdSoi4Maa	Because deep down you're afraid that same thing is going to happen again.  You're so young & have many years ahead of you so I'd go for the girl.  Everyone gets their heart broken once or more in their life, you just have to stay positive, move on & know that something better will come about.

You definitely wouldn't want anything to go wrong with your baby during a difficult time, which would autmatically equal stress on your body.<br>  <br>  When you're stable, mentally and physically, then you should be able to do it.

What does that mean exactly? If you mean going on welfare, that is what is wrong with this economy now...people all want a free ride and other people end up paying for the others mistakes. I really dont think this is the case here, for the fact that i have worked in a Korean spa for the past 12 years and Asian people are anything but lazy. But on the other hand if you mean getting the department of child support to help you get child support from your husband, yes you can do that but the courts have to first give you custody of the baby and order the child support. That doesnt grantee you will get the child support though Hun, he has to have a job first.<br>  You sound way to sweet for all this. I say get out of this dead end relationship now. And if he blames you for everything, he is abusing you mentally. And that kind of abuse is far worse than getting smacked around a little. The bruises heal but it is much harder to fix the brain. And if he is treating you like this how is he going to treat your child?? That is a scary thought. <br>  Your best bet is going to talk to an attorney find out from a professional what all of your safest options are and the ones available to you where you live and go from there. Just know that in most cases the person who files for the divorce is usually the one who gets what they want outa the divorce.

You can work and raise your baby either here or back home.  But you should not rely on him or government money to support your decision to have a baby and keep it.

They look nice.<br>  <br>  I love your bridesmaid dress!|`|kUE3Ddktaa	First of all, I love the idea of tan/khaki suit for a summer wedding. It looks very modern, fresh, and weather-appropriate!<br>  <br>  But I also think asking men to wear hot pink, if they are not the kind of guys who would voluntarily wear pink, is needless cruel. Find a complementary color that won't offend their manhood - what about a silvery gray, white, or rich navy? Thinking of the oranges and pinks in your color scheme, my pick would be navy, which will give it balance and make the brighter colors pop. <br>  <br>  And finally, vests are usually worn with tuxedos, very rarely with normal suits (I can't tell you the last time I saw a man in a three-piece suit - it's very old-fashioned). And when suits do have vests, the vest usually matches the suit (same fabric and color) - that's just how they're sold. Pair a tan suit, no vest, with a crisp white shirt and a great tie (not in hot pink!) and your guys will look insanely classy. AND they will be eternally grateful to you for not making them wear matchy-matchy pink ties - you will seem like the coolest bride ever.|`|seU9VwIJaa	I think it will look amazing! I love khaki suits at weddings. J Crew has a lot of options and I considered it for mine. I love the dresses, too.<br>  Congrats and good luck!|`|E2X6B1Iaaa	I think it sounds hip, young and very spring. I like it. And your BM dresses are adorable. <br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats!|`|aipChC3haa	I'm sorry, but I am going to be honest with the fact that I REALLY don't like it.  It looks too plain and the color's just don't compliment each other.
6DknvNi6aa	If she liked you intially then she probably still likes you know. Sometimes girls have their days and I'm probably going to get jump by girls for saying that, but its true and I'm a girl too.|`|iAtanlT8aa	i have had this kind of problem and i found it bad to rush things, build up to going to her house again, maybe a couple more times, then ask her out.

Try to talk to her more but don't become an annoyance.|`|B97UyW0Faa	YES, the answer is always yes, its always better to try<br>  <br>  the sting of a rejection is not half as bad as as the regret over not trying.|`|1H2L0ysdaa	Well it sounds like u really like her! Talk to one of her girl friends and ask her if her friend likes u! Think of fun stuff to do in groups and just have fun! Take it slow and dont rush! Us girls dont like to rush. Give her some space and dont seem too ubsessed! Give her a wink every now and then to show her u want to be more than friends! Get someone to talk to her about u! and ask them what she says! I hope this help let me know how things go!! :D <3|`|v3vBcyGLaa	There are two things that could be happening:<br>  <br>  1.  She figured out that she doesn't like you in that special way.<br>  2.

ZTwTGSUoaa	Well It sounds like there is a major disconnect with you and your wife. <br>  <br>  First Instead of looking at how much she is spending the better question might be why is she spending? Did she grow up in the lifestyle? Is she lonely? Is her spending a way of compensating for some other need? We all grow up with different beliefs on money. I know myself I was raised with the cant take it with you and any dollar I have burns a hole in my pocket. So since I am a spender...I spend but I learned to spend on things of value. I have 40 dollars I just have to blow I buy a bond, stock, gold something that will gain value in the future.<br>  <br>  Second have you taking time to discuss your finacial goals with her and what her finaicial goals are. You should establish a budget together. Find out what she thinks are things that she needs to spend on monthly and find a budget amount you both agree on. <br>  <br>  Third set up a seperate savings account to save in and spend as you like account. I have an account that all it contains is money I have set aside to waste be it on clothes, shoes what have you and I know when its gone its gone and I can only spend what I want from there; I have an account bills come out of another account and one for savings. It sounds like your wife's issue might be management and control, a budget on paper is a good plan but sometimes you need to take it a step further. <br>  <br>  Fourth you cannot punish your wife for mistakes with money that just leads to a bad marriage altogether. When you married her; her money issue became yours and vice versa. The best advice I can offer is to talk to her and be honest. However you cant treat her like a child because well that will backfire.|`|1da4a2d0455c0102329b9db0565c3a34aa	Send her a smaller stipend and put the remainder in an account where you are.  Maybe shes right...she's just not ready to have an adult life and be able to live within her means.  Nobody would say that if they were practical, mature and well meaning now would they?|`|WT5tYLdfaa	I dont wanna say this but maybe you need your little own account to the side|`|IvMPh09baa	well... look how good your plan is working already, you ignoring her texts obviously is only going to piss her off.  so what are you looking for here, do you want to punish her or do you want to find a solution with her?<br>  <br>  What you are doing is only to punish your wife, this will get you nowhere.  you need to figure out another way to make her see her spending habits are destroying your lives.  punishment will only anger her and you are destroying your relationship also by doing so.|`|1HTRWrawaa	How do you expect to have a successful marriage when you haven't even lived with your wife for more then 2 years? You want to keep this marriage going, then you better get home and start being a real husband or stop complaining about how much money your wife spends and be grateful that she is still your wife on paper.<br>  <br>  You want to save some money, then don't give her all your money. Decide how much money you want to save and YOU put that amount of money in a bank account in your own name.<br>  <br>  You sure do expect a lot from a woman you won't even live with. Do you mail her your dirty laundry to do for you too?
YMbvOmryaa	If you think you would be into it then go. However, if you are worried about bf not doing the right thing while he is there you need to talk to him first. Let him know what you expect and make sure he is willing to play by your rules. If he isn't, don't go. There are plenty of things out there to do that are cheaper and entertaining. Strip clubs are expensive, the drinks cost more and the girls just want your money. It is their job to try to get you to leave the bar pennyless.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, have a great birthday!|`|8JU1hxZ1aa	Nah do it you're only 21 once :) , also I would suggest following the girls in this questions lead, <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AsrJPYThbPuh4UhtKDQWNn3sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222193358AAQeM2R&show=7#profile-info-R86v6ndpaa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|RpxKmUBUaa	BAD IDEA...It's just gonna lead to heartache and pain, so don't do it...Go to a karaoke bar instead;)|`|ff700543f3408186155eccc4290362b5aa	Honey, don't invite trouble. Stay out of the strip club. Any guy is going to be distracted and look like crazy!! and that normal. What would you expect? Why would you even want to go there? I mean, sometime when you are alone with him there, maybe it could be erotic, and you would end up having good sex when you got home, but your 21rst birthday with friends too? Go somewhere else!!<br>  Happy Birthday!!!|`|mVUpt8waaa	If you take your boyfriend to a place full of naked women do you expect him not to look?|`|Wi97GrVVaa	could get kinda weird. you don't wanna spend your birthday worrying if you boyfriend is checking out someone else|`|9dc7211c44c17097c672d814b9900b0faa	dont go to a strip club|`|gzZiPl9Vaa	I say it's your 21st do what YOU want to!!  Going to a strip club...with your BF...can actually be a turn on.  Sure he may get his kicks while he's there...he's a guy...that's what they do.  But you get your kicks too!  And when you go home...well...<br>  <br>  I love going to strip clubs...women...not men...they gross me out...to greasy and just eww.  (I'm very comfortable with my sexuality...love the men...but appreciate how much us women go through to look the way we do and do the things we do.) Honestly it's erotic, but at the same time impressive to see what some of those girls can do.<br>  <br>  DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO AND HAVE A BLAST!!!  Good luck hun and happy 21st!|`|tlhhL20Jaa	well if you are worried bout it why would you do it? Why would you take your boyfriend to the strip club unless you totally trusted him and if you are questioning it, you dont fully trust him...

8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Wow, I am afraid I couldn't.  I think it is completely your call.  I'm sorry this happened to you.<br>  <br>  To me, the fact that he is her ex husband and the father of her children does not in any way mitigate what she did to your marriage.  <br>  <br>  Divorce is like a death, almost.  The former spouse is "dead" to you.  The only involvement should be the children and her boundaries weren't there...  ESPECIALLY when the person has remarried.  Why are people having so much trouble with this issue of appropriate boundaries these days???|`|1pZLQSz0aa	ooooo.....thats a toughy.  If she was totally remorseful and made sure it was a one time thing wit the ex...id give another shot.  But if it seems like she still has feelings for this guy and it could happen again...let her go|`|9851deb6f5776ae6834cf0b79571e624aa	You may be God fearing but she is not or she would not have slept with him. She obviously still feels something for this man and I never have liked the excuse of they have children together.  You may not like my answer but since you asked I would leave her with the mess she created and the mess she is still creating. I have been in the same situation and sure enough I got burned a second time. So forgive me if I seem a bit bitter.|`|qeUoAW6naa	I would let go of her, if I were you. She has kids with this other man, and thus he will always be a part of her life. And once a cheater, always a cheater. There are chances of her cheating on you again, because it seems like she's still in love with her ex, even though she left him (for whatever reason!). She's being very unfair to both men. I think you should let her (and her kids) go. You do not need to take their responsibility anymore.|`|W9B6EJrWaa	That's hilarious!  She "fell prey", did she?  And you're both God-fearing Christians, well, uh... no I would say there's not so much of the God-fearing in your little woman. <br>  <br>  I guess if it were me I wouldn't leave, but I sure would make HER leave, and take those rugrats that aren't even yours with her. <br>  <br>  "God-fearing".  That's a good one.  Hyah.|`|wSeOxs7Jaa	I wouldn't forgive someone for having an ongoing affair or multiple infidelities, but anyone can make a mistake one time. Forgive her and put it behind you.|`|FzS3aphWaa	Even non-Christians know that adultery is wrong, morally as well as legally.  A woman who is grown up enough to have been married twice and has a family does not "fall prey" to flirtations.  She participated in secret emails and telephone conversations for some period of time - in law, that is called premeditated.  You know of only one sexual encounter.<br>  <br>  Based on these facts, she might be happier if she got back together with the father of her children.  He will be part of the childrens' lives for the foreseeable future.  You do not give the childrens' ages but assume that he will be there for school ceremonies and wedding ceremonies, etc.  <br>  <br>  If you plan to stay with her, it is time for counselling.  Even the pastor of your church might be able to help you.  You cannot stay with someone whom you do not trust and there needs to be truth and acceptance of responsibility before you can begin to rebuild the trust you should have in your partner|`|AA11239306	Ruth is correct.  Divorce is like death...  she should only be speaking to him in terms of the children.  she should not have been speaking to him in any kind of intimate manner.   You cant fall for someone's charm or spells.  It takes two and she can say she is sorry, but she is obviously not done with him.  im sorry for you.  You can forgive, but youre always going to think about it.  It wasnt just random man for sex or attention.  it goes much deeper.  you have a very difficult decision to make.  It depends on how much you are willing to deal with.|`|dIw7MqTdaa	Both God-fearing Christians, eh? You're no different than the very people you say need salvation.<br>  <br>  If given the chance, I'd have curb stomped her, but then again that's just me. <br>  <br>  Apologise, don't apologise, what's done is done.|`|C8pFxLDYaa	You should not be with her if her heart is not content with you. Remember the commandments, don't commit adultery.|`|zQheOHReaa	once a cheater, always a cheater. regardless of what religion you are.|`|4iUhdKKiaa	No, dont use God as an excuse to stay in bad situations.  he will forgive u.|`|SndrZbn8aa	I don't understand what being a Christian has to do with your problem. If she were such a Christian she wouldn't have broken the sanctity of your marriage. <br>  You make it sound as though her ex was manipulated her into cheating on you ("she fell prey"). It takes two to cheat though. No matter how charming he might be she still made the secret calls, or accepted them, along with the emails and of course actually going through with meeting up with him.<br>  It is nice that she has apologized to you and come clean with the whole matter. That might help to build back up a little trust.<br>  Really the biggest question, as you pointed out, is will you be able to deal with this man being a part of your life with her. That's just something you have to answer for yourself. That and will you be able to trust her again.<br>  If it were me and there were no kids involved (I don't know if you two have children together or not) I would at least take a trial separation. That would give you sometime to clear through some emotions and decide if you miss her enough to work through this situation.<br>  Sorry to hear you're going through such a tough time and hope you work out what will be best for you. I'm sure god doesn't want you to be unhappy so do what feels right for you.
31GXcmBiaa	People can change if they have the determination to chance.  Sometimes they will say they will change in order to prolong whatever it is they need/want.  For the most part though, change is possible|`|BkdbiwSwaa	no they dont u can change the way u present ur self but u can never really change|`|AA11043457	People can change but it isn't easy.  Most of the time they are sorry they got caught, not really sorry for what they did.<br>  <br>  They say they will change to try to have no consequences for their actions.<br>  <br>  Someone who really changes does change their life.  They are different from what they were before.  They accept consequences for their actions and realize that they were at fault.  <br>  <br>  If a person has hurt you, particularly abuse, and hurt you again, you need to get out of the situation as they haven't changed and will continue the actions because there are no consequences.  They can't learn unless there are consequences for their actions.<br>  <br>  You need to protect yourself and your family and if there is abuse, get away from the abuser.  It will only get worse.  It is a matter of control and they want to control you and order  you around.  They are selfish and care only for themselves not for you or anyone else.<br>  <br>  So don't expect change, expect same ole same ole.  And get on with your life.|`|2LmfQUbKaa	if someone tells you they are going to change most of the time it is only talk! actions speak louder then words follow there actions! you will see it to believe it! good luck!|`|UobA5ebEaa	I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT BECAUSE MY BOYFRIEND SAYS HE IS GOING TO CHANGE AND DOES FOR 2 DAYS AND GOES BACK TO THE SAME PERSON....WELL YEA IF U REALLY BE COINSISTENT WITH IT JUST MAYBE|`|SjGpbohiaa	Yes I believe that they can.

Do you know where he graduated from high school and when?<br>  <br>  The only immediate hit I got off his name was an advertisement for someone else who was looking for a "Royce Low" of Ehrenberg, AZ.<br>  <br>  If this could be your Royce Low, you could try contacting the lady to see if she ever made contact with him.  You could try searching phone books of Ehrenberg, AZ or even paying to have a background check run on Royce Low of that city.<br>  <br>  If you know what high school he attended, you could try classmates.com or even calling the school to see if an alumni organization might have an address for him.|`|sqmIO2u5aa	Hi!!!

V610w8EXaa	Listen carefully:  <br>  <br>  He's a LOSER.  You deserve better.  DO NOT "take him back."<br>  <br>  You CANNOT "fix" him ... he's a damaged piece of SHYT.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about making him see that he missed out on a good thing ... you'll only hurt yourself in the process.

YOU DONT EVER WANT HIM BACK. Though it feels like you do. Just cause he had a bad childhood doesnt mean he needs to take it out on you. And you should let him. Also, would you want his current gf to go through the same thing? I would let her know what this guy is like. Second, I would try to find help for him. In between, drinking, drugs, abuse, he is not heading down a good road, and it will catch up with him. If you care about that much you would help and protect yourself first. <br>  <br>  Also, since he is coming back to you and talking about things between the two of you, he does care about you. Though he makes it seem like he doesnt. He will feel that void when the girl he is with doesnt give in and tolerate the things you went through. He will realize that. Just give it time.<br>  <br>  But I would forget about him if I were you. Help him if you can, but dont get too involved (in his life anymore)...|`|T7ZVlHyLaa	He is not someone you should be with. let him realize how much you did. ignore him don't give him attention he will be running back in no time. you always want what you can't have so just let it be don't bother be with other guys.|`|XnIkIwY3aa	Get over it and move on, seriously. <br>  <br>  This guy is a loser and will no doubt kill himself way before his time.

Let me tell you there are way better guys in the world. As far as i'm concerned you should never talk to him again in this lifetime let alone glance at him. This is a really unhealthy and dangerous relationship he could have killed you. You should give him what he deserves and stop talking to him for good. Maybe a new boy will notice you now that you're not so in the dirt wth him. I think after you're done with him you'll even notice the new change in yourself. It's been so long you need to remember who you are and the strong women inside of you.|`|mDMnhqwdaa	Sucess if the best revenge...make something out of yourself, look your best and when you see him act like you don't even notice him, and definitely know what he lost.|`|AA11155064	Why do you trouble yourself for having lost a problem?<br>  <br>  By your account, being together was making you very unhappy: cheating, using, ignoring, controlling and disrespect.<br>  <br>  NOW you are MISSING that and want it BACK?<br>  <br>  Truly, you can't be serious! Surely no-one has such low self-esteem to want to be humiliated more?<br>  Why not count your blessings, revel in this pathetic creature's absence and find something or some-one to give your life pleasure, value and self worth.<br>  Trying to make such a person as him see what they have lost is useless as if they didn't value it in the first place and threw it away ,why would they want it now?<br>  Don't allow him to control you even when he is not there: you are debasing yourself for him.<br>  <br>  Let go, move on, be grateful you've survived.|`|wr2uiZk7aa	You've sacrificed a lot for this guy and if he still treats you as second best I'll dump him.

You know that, you said it yourself. But knowing this, doesn't mean you are going to apply it. you need to hold your head high, and struggle your way out. It will be tough to ignore someone that you have had such emotional highs and lows with. But, he will never change. You can not and will not change the fact he has no respect for you, others, and himself. You need to get out of their before anything else contributes to what you are feeling, you need to delete his number. his myspace. Whatever you can do, to get distance. If you don't do this, and you dwell there, waiting for him to come back a changed person. You will only be wasting your time, time you could have spent moving on to find someone who would never do these things to you. Spend time distancing yourself, and preperaing to meet someone who will treat you with all the love you deserve. This is not something you want to continue to do, don't play with your emotions, don't hope he will come back. If he wants to change for you he will, until then he is still the same asshole everywhere he goes.

They may be freaked out by the idea. I would only suggest that you attempt to do it with someone you trust and are close with.<br>  <br>  Most don't get into this with their partners until some sense of sexual maturity develops usually mid to late 20s and onward. Most younger girls likely wont understand it.|`|yyJo3ybBaa	None of this is abnormal. Unfortunately at your age, you've got a while before girls are really into this. You may have to learn self bondage (tying yourself up) for a few years. If a girl that age wants to tie you up, I'd be very careful that she's not going to post pics on the internet.
Wo5Ezmwiaa	All I can say is, I don't know ANY friends who sleep in beds together. That is not typical or normal. Him putting his arm around you and holding your hand, was probably his way of letting you know he likes you too. No guy would do that to a girl he didn't like, and no guy would want to sleep in a bed over and over again with a girl he wasn't interested in. That really isn't normal. He hasn't made a real big move on you yet, cause he is shy. But doing those things, are huge tells that he's into you. Nobody sleeps over these days, without hidden meanings. What do your friends think of these sleep overs? I can't believe it. No guy and girl do that unless they're in a relationship. Friends don't do that. Maybe next time you're in bed, put your arm over his chest, and see what he does. Then maybe say something like "why do you think we aren't boyfriend and girlfriend?". Trust me, putting his arm around you and holding your hand is NOT a friend thing, and sleeping in the same bed over and over is NOT a friend thing. So get this sorted out.
VZVGXRyraa	I wouldn't care about the restraining order or what kind of baggage came with it. I'm not going to throw away feelings i have for a girl over the stupid mistake of another guy in her past. I would be sympathetic, protective of her...be there if she wanted to talk about it or be there if she needed someone to distract her from it.<br>  <br>  When i start a relationship with a girl, i know they have a life before me and i know that their life will include good and bad things. I don't just ask out part of the girl...i ask out the girl and all that she brings to the table and i would be more than happy to help her with anything she needed help with, good or bad. That's what relationships are about...helping and being there for each other. Any guy who says "the problems in your past are your own, don't bother me with them" should have his butt beat up and down the street.|`|tBuzrlSdaa	I would feel you dated bad guys|`|8SRjELNBaa	"How would you react if you were my guy?"<br>  ME: "oh........."<br>  <br>  "Would you assume he was beating up on me? "<br>  ME: Yes.<br>  <br>  "Would you be extra protective? "<br>  Yes.<br>  <br>  "Would you have sympathy or lose respect for the girl?"<br>  No, i'd have respect for that sort of stuff.<br>  <br>  "Would you be concerned for the girl?"<br>  Like thinking she was... crazy? No, she just hooked up with the wrong guy.<br>  <br>  "Is that too much emotional baggage?"<br>  It would be unfair to assume that just because of your past, your probably a whole different person now.<br>  <br>  "Would you assume thats why she doesn't like to bring up her past? and moved away?"<br>  If she didn't want to share information about the relationship or events that occurred during that time i could understand, but hope that one day you'd open up.<br>  <br>  Tada<br>  <br>  VOila.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|AA12393776	I don't know what I would do. It is a lot of baggage. Hopefully not too much.<br>  <br>  If I were you, I would have tried to keep it quiet a little longer.<br>  <br>  I would be concerned and a little afraid.  I would want to here the story directly, bothersome to hear it from a friend.  I would look at the girl far closer and harder .. but probably that would be good and would deepen for the better the relationship.|`|zLnnkTX0aa	for me i would be protective of her and help her in any way i could she has already had a ruff life help it get better|`|b1ca3f5e6e5466981ff2b50c7568e497aa	Whats the question? I don't he'll care.|`|UIi1DPlbaa	You probably would strongly dislike my answer, but I want to be honest rather than supportive here... <br>  <br>  On the positive side, I would not lose respect for that girl, and I would certainly have sympathy for her. I would not make any assumptions--such as the assumption that her ex was beating her. The restrianing-order situations are often complex and making meaningful guesses is difficult.<br>  <br>  On the negative side, I would NOT date her, for two reasons. First, she clearly had a major problem with a romantic replationship, and I have no information whether she, her ex, or both together were responsible for the problem. The chances that she was the one responsible are less than 50%, but why take chances at all when I do not have to? Second, if her ex was violent--and the chances of that are non-negligible--he may pose a future danger to both her and myself. Again, why should I take chances?<br>  <br>  Overall, I honestly think that I guy should be pretty stupid in order to date a girl who is known to have a restraining order on her ex. I realize that it sounds cruel, but it is practical and pragmatic. Would you date a guy who is known to have major problems with his past relationships? You probably would not do that either.|`|0NUs25jLaa	me i would be very protective of my girl and wouldn't let anythinor anybody hurt her but that's just me and the ro would not bother me at all
AA11311567	First off, how DARE she?  Where did she get the gall, the audacity, the nerve to have unauthorized surgery performed on your cat, behind your back, no less  and not bother to tell you until you got back.<br>  <br>  There are so many issues with this, and each one needs to be addressed one at a time.  Your stepmom has done a lot of damage.<br>  <br>  First, several trusts has been breached.  I assume that while you were away, you entrusted your step mom, or other people in your home to provide care for your cat.  By declawing your cat, she breached the trust between you and her.  More importantly, she breached the trust between the cat and her, and quite possibly the cat and you.  As pets, cats entrust us to care for them appropriately and protect them from harm.  Cats are smart, but not capable of the level of thinking that the declawing was performed without authorization: yours. Your stepmom did this.<br>  <br>  Second:  Declawing is unnecessary, unkind, and painful.  It is an expedient solution, but not a good one, often used by those who A) value their convenience over the well being of their pet and B) those who don't want to put the time into training their cat to only scratch in appropriate places.  it is doubtful whether these people should even own a cat.<br>  For that reason, it is banned in most of Western Europe, the state of California, and is condemned by the ASPCA and most other animal welfare organizations.  In fact, the ASPCA wont release a cat to someone who plans to declaw him.  Many other animal welfare organizations have this policy, too.<br>  Why? it's painful.  And it's damaging, too.<br>  <br>  Now it's time to focus on your poor cat.  Make sure you do everything you can to reassure him and comfort him.  Take him to the vet and make sure he is healing from the operation.  Rebuild that trust.  Give him lots of TLC.  And for the rest of his life, under no circumstances ever let him go outside.  He will have no defense against other cats or other animals who may try to attack him.  And never let your stepmom anywhere near your cat, or any other pets you might have.<br>  <br>  Now it's time to focus on your stepmom.<br>  She has done a tremendous amount of damage and owes you (not to mention your cat) a substantial apology.  Her flippant demeanor (I paid for it) makes it worse.  She should be reprimanded severely for the boundaries she has overstepped and the pain and lack of trust she has caused.  She should be given to know on no uncertain terms that she is not to even look at your cat without your expressed permission.   Your stepmom should understand how sneaky and underhanded her actions were, and how insensitive her reaction to you anger is.<br>  <br>  Oh yeah....<br>  to answer your question, you are not overreacting.  You are furious and have every right to be.  I am even livid for you that someone would go and do that to your cat.  I'm pretty sure that other people who are partial to cats would also take a dim view of this, too.|`|biKMQ2I1aa	no, you are not over reacting. It is a cruel proceedure and now he can not defend himself at all if he goes outside. That will make him more apt to be seriously injured. Also, kitties that have been declawed tend to start biting to comensate for the fact they have no claws. Sometimes that means if someone goes to pet them they will grab the persons hand and bite out of leeriness and being unable to defend themselves.|`|E5zzDwoBaa	she is a total B*TCH! <br>  wtf? she had no right to do that. you said no, and no means no. <br>  that would totally piss me off|`|iKYNUni0aa	no you arent wrong she is she should have done that without consulting you esp knowing how you felt about the subject shes the only one out of line|`|hfDohxp5aa	No you are not over reacting , step parents should be careful to have open honest communication with the step kids.  there should have been a compromise. She did exactly what she wanted and didn't care what you wanted. Watch your communication with this person. I wouldn't trust her.|`|khwr87SVaa	thats not ok, my moms a vet and she says its very cruel. your not over reacting at all (ps im a guy) i think you should sit down with her and ask why she did it even though u said not to.  what she did was wrong and cant be reversed but talk with her about it|`|a3ffZgRsaa	You freakin furrys crack me up<br>  <br>  its a damn cat, calm the hell down<br>  <br>  Also, its the equivalent to gettin' fingernails clipped, so i don't care|`|yl2pJauAaa	nah your comepletely reasonable, its a cinderella story.|`|Qq9m85y4aa	mmm well she probably didnt mean 2 make u mad <br>  but yet again she shoud've told u first!|`|lXpGlAm3aa	What?? Maybe take her to court?|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	I'm sorry you're so upset.  I think your step mother wasn't being very thoughtful when she did this.  UNLESS she told you in advance that if she had to watch the cat it would have to be declawed.  Did you have this conversation with her?  If so, by letting her watch the cat, it was giving her permission to have it declawed, unfortunately.<br>  <br>  I think your cat will be fine, once he heals, although i don't agree with declawing either.  Make sure he has something soft in his litter box (not cat litter).  They do make small animal bedding that looks like tiny, wadded up paper and it's very soft.  Might be a good idea to use it as litter for a while.<br>  <br>  regular litter can get caught in the sore feet.<br>  <br>  I'm really sorry for your kitty|`|XoA6kByvaa	I personally agree with you that declawing is cruel and amounts to mutilation.  Many people are ignorant of what exactly is involved in declawing a cat.  The link points to a web site that lays out all the gory details.<br>  <br>  There seems to be another issue here as well, specifically your stepmother's decision to act on this while you were out of the country and not able to defend your cat.  The adjectives "under-handed" and "controlling" come to mind when I attempt to classify your step-mother's behavior.<br>  <br>  I don't know your age, or your living circumstances (e.g. whether or not you are a minor, a legal dependent, and so forth).  I do not know for how long she has been your step-mother, nor if you could appeal to your father for support in this issue.<br>  <br>  What does seem clear is that there is a VERY LARGE gap in core values between yourself and your step-mother.  Though your cat bears the physical scars, this is not really about him.<br>  <br>  I do not think you are overreacting to be furious, but expressing your anger may be the only thing you can do at this time in your life.<br>  <br>  One other thing should be said:<br>  Your cat needs you now, more than ever.  There are some things he can no longer do to protect himself, and you will need to control his environment so that he never needs to.<br>  <br>  I wish you courage, patience, and wisdom in dealing with this.|`|SZ9TJvVaaa	Maybe, i mean he's a cat. It's different when you have a child or something. Remember HE'S A FREAKING CAT and eventually he will get used to having no claws.|`|RM2a6XDNaa	no. if your cat is someone you love, then there would be no reason to not  be angry. just like if you love a human and someone did something bad to them you would be angry|`|o6orgXm2aa	no ur not overreacting shes a cruel *****!|`|oz1xq4zwaa	No you are not over reacting and you should be mad at her. But when the claws grow back and she want to cut them again you can declaw it with out hurting the cat at all. what you can do is take a pair of scissors and only cut the point off, but you must be very careful. You see the cats claw has nerves in only the part that is closer to the paw. If you cut the part that does not have nerves in it, the cat and the furniture will be safe. Note, you do not need to do this on the back paws, only the front. Also I do this to my own cat and she does not mind this a bit. If you are not sure about your cutting skills you can also buy a special pair of scissors at your local pet store. Here is also a link of a cats claw and where you should cut it.|`|bab98853150b199df79ea228be16f757aa	Unfortunately, it's still legal to have a cat declawed, and you can basically do nothing if you are under 18.  I'm very sorry for you cat, and hope you can give him the best home possible.  Keep him inside at all times, and give him lots of 'soft places' he can walk on more comfortably.  If you are over 18, you may try asking if you can sue your step mother for 'damages' to your cat, but since you seem to live with your step mother and father, I doubt you'll get a penny, and no amount of money can help your poor cat now.  Love him and give him the best home possible ... he's still your cat, and he's been irrevocably damaged by your 'ignorant' step mom.  I'm truly sorry ... my husband and I are both cat owners, and we would NEVER have a cat 'declawed' any more than we would have our own fingernails pulled out!  It's cruel, but since it's 'done' now, just tend to your kitty ... and give him a kiss from me and my husband!|`|a5f8fb915b0c89693e97dc814aba467faa	No. You are not overreacting. If I were in your situation, I might even have a more severe reaction than you. It might involve doing as much damage to your step mother as she did to your cat . I'd cut all her fingers off.

4bd6769f9391604a128cb5de3e4b5085aa	There's basically two reasons you "can't or shouldn't" be with someone. They either are dating someone else, or they are always working their charm to get some action and then moving on.<br>  <br>  If it's a guy who's in another relationship, then... Okay, I always like to remind myself that it's not my place to get in the middle of other people's relationships. Even if there's an obvious connection and this other couple is having problems. I always figure that she should break up w/ the other guy first, take the time she needs to get over him, and then when she's ready to start dating again, she can look at me. I've even had "taken girls" try to make a move on me, and that's pretty much what I told them.<br>  <br>  If he's just looking to party, go nuts, get laid, and have fun and you want something serious... May I suggest you buddy up w/ some of his past conquests. When enough other girls tell you how things ended so badly, he won't look that attractive anymore. Or more generically, just make sure you see for him for the guy he actually is and not who you want him to be (aka his good qualities, combined w/ the other qualities that you look for in a good boyfriend that he doesn't actually happen to have)<br>  <br>  I suppose the other possibility is that you and this guy are divided on a major philosophical difference. Like you are a big liberal and he is a big conservative. Or you are an Atheist and he is a devout Christian. In that case, my advice is to give it a shot and keep an open mind. People can surprise you. I am not religious, and in my Junior year of High School I started falling for a big time Christian girl. We had good chemistry, but she never wanted to get involved with me b/c I wasn't religious. Finally, in our Senior year I told her that I respect her beliefs, but that I just don't share them, and in light of that respect I would be willing to go sit next to her in church every Sunday. Against her better judgment she decided to take me up on that offer and give us a try. And I made it every week, even during football season (cuz I'm a sports fanatic). Although there was some compromise. She tended to go for the 10am ceremony, and I made her get up and come w/ me at 8, so that we would be done in time for the first set of games beginning at 11 (which is when they start on Mountain Time). The relationship ran its course and ended for other reasons. But our major divide on religion wasn't a problem.|`|QAGaQUDRaa	Wow...this is almost exactly like a question I asked a few months ago.<br>  <br>  With me, I fought the feelings for 5 months, but then decided that I might as well live in the moment and not worry about the future. So that's what I did, and I'm happier now with him than I have been in a while.
28aa15ff815174fd0da9e6d6dd19aeedaa	Bright pink looks great with candy apple red.  You could have pink gerber daisies with some other flowers mixed in.|`|4POGapREaa	Lilies, daisies, and roses all together would not look good.  The only thing they have in common is that they're all flowers.  Daisies are cute & fun, lilies are tropical, roses are deep & romantic.  If you want the gerbera as the main flower, I would suggest adding nothing else but greenery to it.  It stands out enough on its' own & it should be the main attraction in the bouquet.  Just like roses are usually only good with baby's breath, gerberas aren't really good with any other bold flower.  Lilies are different because you can pair them with flowing orchids or other tropicals & it just works.|`|X6YY0OS6aa	wow!!

Take a look at parrot tulips, their stunning.<br>  Don't listen when people say you can't mix different flowers, its so not true. My mum is a florist so when I got married I couldn't choose.

AA10698633	Go out with him.  Keep your head about you, knowing that he is good at conning girls.  expect that he could cheat on you because he has done that sort of thing before.  Because you know this is not going to be a serious relationship, do not do anything foolish (intimate) .  You best friend is saying not to be foolish like she was.  Do not hold that against her.

xzMUxGpgaa	No, I think you handled it very well.<br>  <br>  You have got to remember that you told him at one time you liked him. That "at one time" could have been when you and he were first starting to get to know each other as friends. A lot of time when we first meet up with someone, we are not sure if it is going to be only friends or if it will turn into something more. And even if he would think it was later (after you and he were already friends), it sounds like he is not bothered by it. He told you that everything was ok, so of course believe him. <br>  <br>  I think you are just feeling guilty because you are not sure how he really is thinking about you now. Trust him. If it is true and he now feels strange or different being around you, time will tell. But, just believe what he is saying. Go around him acting the way you always have and put it out of your mind. If you don't and you continue to question it, even to yourself, he will pick up on that and that is what could make your friendship be in trouble. I wish you the best of luck. Good friends are hard to find and it sounds like you have a good one with him, as I am sure you are to him.

LbvRxf2jaa	It may be that if you stay at the hotel she wants you to stay, she gets a discount on her room - but in the end it is your choice.|`|76nTvO4iaa	Tell her to go play bridezilla with her attendants - you're not playing her games.<br>  <br>  IF she's not paying the bill for the rooms, she has no say in where people stay and needs to get over herself.<br>  <br>  Are you bride's side or groom's side?|`|4POGapREaa	It's totally reasonable for you to pick the hotel of your choice.  Sometimes they get a group discount for the hotel & that's why they'll suggest that particular hotel, but it's not necessary for you to stay there.  Maybe she's mad because not enough people want to stay at the place she chose, so they won't honor the discounted rate anymore?  I don't know, just a guess.  So, if some people have already booked rooms with the discount they were offering, those people will have to pay more now because not enough guests are staying there to honor the discount.  Did that make sense?  I'm very tired & I feel like I'm rambling but you get the point.  Other than that, I can't figure out why she would care where anybody stays as long as they show up.|`|kUE3Ddktaa	The bride can get over it. Guests paying for their own accommodations are not obligated to stay in the hotel of the bride's choosing.<br>  <br>  If she gives you attitude about it, just say, "Thanks for your concern, Susan, but this hotel will be a lot more comfortable for us and its definitely close enough to the wedding venue that we won't have any trouble getting there."<br>  <br>  Then change the subject and consider the matter closed.|`|l43NSgHyaa	That's odd.   Honestly, if she's not paying, why does she care.  This is one of those things that not even worth fighting with someone about.  Honestly, if it's really that big of a deal, make a reservation at the fancy hotel and then cancel it.    You can cancel reservations up to 48-72 hours without getting charged.    Then, go down the street to the less expensive place.   By that point in time, she'll be freaking out over her dress or other last second things and she'll never realize you didn't stay at that other hotel.     But, again, only do this if she's really, really picking a huge and unnecessary fight over it.|`|rJJhMQ37aa	She's a bridezilla.  You have the right to stay wherever you want.  Tell her so.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	She needs to get over herself. It is uncalled for that she dictate such a thing.|`|b6e3e5765ea9340b4ffd975bfca501aaaa	The only reason she might be upset is sometimes there is a discount for a block of rooms.  If not everyone books at that hotel, that those that do (which may be her and/or her family) may end up paying a higher rate.<br>  <br>  Or she may have had this "fantasy" of everyone staying at the same idea - thought that would be fun.<br>  <br>  Or she may have had planned something special in regards to those that are staying at that hotel.  (Gift basket, etc.)<br>  <br>  Or she may have just been offended that her hotel wasn't "good enough" for you.<br>  <br>  However, that is really her problem, not yours.  <br>  <br>  All she can do is suggest accommodations, she can't demand unless there is a specific reason - but she should have been more clear if that was the case.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	Guests can stay wherever they want.<br>  She may be mad be mad because she reserved a block of rooms at a certain hotel (as a courtesy).  At some hotels, if rooms get filled, that you reserved, they'll give you a free bridal suite. She's probably mad that she's going to have to pay for it.<br>  Too bad for her, it's your money, you stay where you want.|`|f4c5f36a540069fbe952ea342c721c74aa	The bride sounds like a spoiled brat.  She should be paying for out-of-town guests' rooms, anyway.  That she is expecting you to pay for your own room is bad enough....then to dictate where you choose to stay on top of that is outrageous.  If she is having a hissy fit about that I think I'd save her the grief and simply not attend the wedding.  And I'd tell her why, too.|`|crxbob5jaa	If the bride isn't paying, it's none of her business. Now, this is bridezilla at it's best, huh? <br>  <br>  Ignore her.

But friends and family who are not in the actual bridal party should be able to stay wherever they want specially if you have to pay.  <br>  <br>  Good luck hope the wedding day goes well.|`|H9WbaFeNaa	I don't know why she's even worrying about this.

JxY5WXF2aa	If you need to ask this question.... He HAS lost interest. Move on. If he never calls you, doesn't do any of the things he used to do or only does them when it's convenient for him. If he disrespects you, treats you like you are 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and so on on his list of things to do then he has lost interest. It's simple though. Don't make it complicated. You don't need pointers just use your common sense. What do you do when you are into somebody?? Think about it. Does he do any of these things?? OK. What do you do when you are not into somebody or have lost interest in them?? Think about it. Is this how he is treating you?? OK. Keep it simple. The second you start to complicate it is the second you start deceiving your self.|`|wr2uiZk7aa	A guy who he's interest in you will be happy to share his thoughts and feelings.  If he starts to lose these sharings then you'll know he's losing interest.|`|Bk6bXaG3aa	Hey, as a guy I will try to let you know as much as I can about our habits of attraction and when we begin to lose interest.<br>  <br>  Firstly one thing that can be seen as key to a man losing interest in a female is his general act around her and or his openess. This means howmuch he tells you when your talking to each other. If he is close and is attracted he will generally be every open with you and express his feelings profoundly making sure that you know everything you can about him. Of course if he does not take interest in you, you may see that there is immediate lack in the conversations and deep conversations do not flow or cannot be achieved.<br>  <br>  Secondly if you often hang out with him you may have seen that he does not do things with you as often as he may of use to. It is likely that he will tell you that he wants to spend more time with his other friends and that he feels to committed to just you. Aswell he won't feel such urgency to be with you as that of a guy who is tightly built in a relationship. <br>  <br>  If it is a long distance relationship than sometimes it can mean that there is a strong intimacy for each other at the begginning and you have gradually drifted apart. This is usually because he does not get to physically be with you and personally from a male standpoint that means alot to us. Not not just the sexual side of it but also the warmth we feel from a girls company.<br>  <br>  You may also notice if you are with him that he has begun to eye off other girls. If this is the case than he has most likely lost physical attraction in you and is looking for something else. Of course a relationship should not just be about the physicalities so if this is why he is losing interest than don't worry because your worth more than that.<br>  <br>  There are many more reasons that can be explained in much more depth but what I have provided you with is the most common. <br>  <br>  Hope I helped and goodluck!|`|2NkAIka3aa	he might be starting to lose intrest when he starts hanging with ther people, calling you/talking to you alot less. Also he seems not to care if something happends to you anymore (eg. you hurt your leg he use to make sure you take care of it. Now he just says ok)<br>  if a guy loses intrest its going to be quite obviuse, but ALSO these might be signs hes mad/sad about something and wants space so it works either way.<br>  <br>  hope it helped:)|`|HiRYOKoqaa	Just give up, he's obviously too good for you.
uYkqXWN4aa	If you're that determined to break up with your boyfriend, then it shouldn't be so difficult.<br>  <br>  Make a determination, tell your boyfriend it's over and be firm about it. Be honest with everyone involved, so there's no doubt that you're serious.

tjEXRPpuaa	no i do not what about your email address we can talk that way i believe your right on your comments time for me to find some one new
sZoX4qnVaa	Sorry to break it to you, but you cannot MAKE someone like you =[ If only it were that easy.<br>  <br>  Try and remain close, yet distant. Like, be there when she needs you, but don't put yourself out to talk to her all the time. Be and individual, be yourself. If they don't like you for what you are, they're not worth having. x|`|clb2epx6aa	Honestly, you can't make a girl like you. If you do, she might be doing the opposite. Maybe just start by telling her. WARNING: Telling her might ruin the friendship. But if you know things won't be awkward-tell her. But don't give it all in. START SLOW. Tell her how you feel, but don't go saying: Oh, I think your really hot...wanna go out? Do you know what I mean? Let her slowly soak it in piece bu piece. And if she knows, by time maybe it's possible.<br>  <br>  TIP: Girls like funny, nice, understanding guys.|`|gywXHuGCaa	either fight for her, be better than the other guy! or just be a friend, and wait for him to go away... (coward way) not advisable lol, he gives her one flower, you give her 100!<br>  <br>  all is fair in love and war.
edD8I5Svaa	Don't let her do it alone. Sometimes, people in her situation just need someone there with them to motivate them and keep them going. If she decides to go for a jog to work out, go with her. When you're out together grabbing a bite to eat, eat healthy with her. Having a buddy really is a big help. Even if you don't need to loose weight, you'll be staying in shape, so it's a plus for both of you. <br>  As for how to bring it up...that will be the hardest part. I think you should open with concerns for her health and happieness. It's hard to tell someone they need to loose weight. Just plan out what you want to say very carefully. Make sure nothing you say can be taken the wrong way. And make sure she knows that how she looks means nothing to you. You love her (as a friend) no matter what.|`|vWhNu4hTaa	Maybe try to help, but don't make it so obvious.Like try asking if she wants to take a dance class with you. Or you could pretend that you work out a lot. And invite her to your house and just be like 'Sorry, I have a routine and I need to exercise, but your welcome to join me'. Or ask her maybe if she wants to play sports with you. Or you could just always go swimming and invite her, cause swimming is a good exercise.|`|5EWmu0M8aa	maybe you could focus on doing something together instead of the weight itself. You could do walking together or something where she will feel able to catch up. Otherwise it might just discourage her from continuing.|`|wI7wyIB3aa	Maybe if you eat healthier when you are around you will set a good example,and you can recommend walking or some type of sport.My friends have been a great motivator!|`|tNHp7ktoaa	just ask her once in a while if she wants to go for a run or when you are with her just like eat healthy and find stuff she will like and have it at your house so she has her parents get it if she likes it. jusy be really active when you are with her. but dont tell her what you are doing because i bet it wont make any of it any easier. it will just hurt her feelings.|`|Cv3H29yzaa	dont give her clothes that will be too small, that will make it worse!!! <br>  Anyways, you cant force them since that is a sensitive subject, but maybe you can suggest u and her to go out and exercise together at a school track or something. Just make sure she know that even if she stays big, you'll love her the same...|`|7pVjgLFAaa	if she doesn't want to lose weight, she wont.<br>  so dont try to force it on her.<br>  give her clothes that would be small on her.<br>  she'll feel bad.|`|1OxiOk2taa	If she doesn't bring up the subject about hw she wants to loose weight, then don't bring it up. It will make it ocward. If she does bring it up offer to run with her in the gym, and work out on weekends. It is great that you care, but weight isn't something that you start the covo with. You can't force her to loose, she has to want it!|`|CYYZ0NDLaa	Make sure she knows you are going to be very supportive throughout the process. You can plan the both of you diet and exercise regimens. For example, over the weekend you can go bike riding togerther for an hour or so, and have her go over to your house for a healthy dinner or something like that. Your friend is lucky to have such a caring buddy like you!(:

07aee250dcd7dea9fa1d66df2ee52bffaa	Yeah I have had that happen to me before by one of my best friends while I was dating this guy.  I wanted to rip her head off but I kept my calm and just to one minute at a time to see what was going to happen.  Needless to say they wound up together.  I may have lost the only ever friend I had because the guy was just as big of a jerk as the girl was.  But the moral of the story is that you didn't need that crap anyway if they wind up together.  Believe me there are better guys and friends out there.!|`|76138df0987289c288edf73e7f5d6264aa	yes.. and i dont feel confortable seeing that......... actually i hate it!!|`|AA10039458	no, he just talks to my friends in front of me but thats all, nothing else.|`|AA10159814	NO!

AA11225410	I think your love interest wants to get to know you, to see if you are potential girlfriend material. Sometimes guys and girls that have been friends for so long are hesitant to start a relationship. They are afraid of basically ruining a good friendship...like in the event of the break up.<br>    I say go for it, hang out one on one without all of your other buddies around. I believe that he really does like you! But he is really loyal to the friendship that you guys already have. But you know something? Friendships are always the best foundations for a romantic relationship.<br>    After you guys hang out, I am positive that he will decide to take you on as a full time girl. Just see how the night goes. If it goes good, mention causally after you guys have hung out a few times, just ask where everything stands. If it happens that he is still apprehensive about starting anything, just tell him that life is all about chances. You need to take a risk, and you never know what will happen until you try.<br>     Good luck girl, and try not to read into this situation too much. He is just worried about losing his good buddy. But I am sure in time that he will be your new beau and all of this worrying will be a thing of the past!!|`|AA12152097	Sounds like he likes you, but wants to take his time going into a relationship.|`|eace9b00d6eb02d6998aaf4860e38dc7aa	Usually that indicates he wants to take it slow and see how things go.  Probably a good thing rather than rushing into things.|`|fd3cd7748865ffafaa32ac81e68bf6e8aa	ask him this: (how much do you like me?)<br>  <br>  if he says a little then he isn't very interested i'm sorry to say<br>  <br>  if he says enough he is somewhat interested but probably shy.<br>  <br>  if he says alot he is either outgoing and truthful or just a nice guy that doesn't want to break your heart- same goes if he answers that he wont tell you how much he does.|`|39156876297b125891adffbcbd7b008faa	I think that he likes you but like he said you guys are good friends...but all guys are confusing like this just hang out with him anytime you can just the two of you and you can try to talk to him and ask him what you wanna know thats the only way you can know for sure but dont ask when hes around his friends...you might not get the ture answer|`|AA11678292	Well you cannot ask us if he is sincere and if he really likes you we arent him and we won't know.<br>  <br>  Now if you like him and he says he wants to hang out I'm pretty sure he is saying hey i like you lets hang out and get to know each other better. Thus in turn I guess I am saying go for it he probably likes you.|`|c46e8e27263bf01e546eb32438db8601aa	The last guy i liked told me he wanted to "hangout", and now all we do is hangout like "freak buddies," but we are not a couple, and I dont think he plans on pursuing a relationship with me. It depends on how u feel about this guy. If u want to be his girlfriend then tell him u want to do more then hangout, like doing girlfriend and boyfriend stuff- spend time, go on dates, etc.|`|AA10378447	He wants sex only.|`|AA11232725	It sounds like he likes you but he doesn't want to be rushed into making a commitment. He wants to get to know you better before making your relationship "official".

We have been together a little over 2 years. We have been living together practically since we began dating.  I just nervous sometimes like, is he not sure I am the one.  But he says he doesn't want to rush into anything.  I think that because my closest friends have either gotten married and started having babies that he thinks that's why I want to marry him. Sometimes I think that he doesn't understand that I want to marry him because I love him so much and I know that he's the one for me and I can't wait to officially be his wife. <br>  <br>   I just have to be patient.  Because I do love him so much, I need to wait until he is ready.  His parents are divorced, his sister is divorced and his brother has been divorced twice. I don't really blame him for being cautious.  <br>  <br>  Hang in there, your boyfriend will come around.  In the mean time, don't press the isssue, Like my boyfriend says, "When you ask me when, it pushes it back, because I don't want you to think that I am asking you just because you want me too or because other people think it's time."  Enjoy each other right now, I promise, he will come around.!!!!!!

AA11225410	Hi honey, here to help. First of all I am guessing you are young, probably anywhere from 16-18? If I am wrong you can holler at me!<br>    I personally think MySpace is not something you really should be on if you are in a relationship. Now I know others out there are going to argue with that, saying its a place for friends, blah blah blah. I think it really depends on how mature you are about it. I think of it almost as a forbidden place, sort of like going to nightclubs and bars while in a relationship....You are setting yourself up for many temptations.<br>    I am sure at your age it is exciting to meet new people. You can meet people in your own state that are your age. But the thing is, pictures are posted on that site, and it is very easy for guys and girls alike to be attracted to a photo (but not actually knowing the person). This eventually involves meeting up with that person etc. It is a very impressionable thing for young people, and people of all ages...<br>    Personally, your "boyfriend" is acting very immature. But, you know something? This is very typical of a guy his age. He is meeting girls on myspace (whether its in person or just starting a friendship online). He is probably thinking he will look better if he did not have the whole relationship thing going on. If he really loved and respected you, he probably would have cancelled his myspace account a long time ago or he would have had his status as "in a relationship".<br>    I can see being on MySpace, and reconnecting with old friends. I can also see it if you are single, and you know the precautions of dating online. There are alot of sick people out there that you have to be careful of. People are not always who they seem to be. The internet is great for pretending to be who you want to be. There are questionable people of all ages and you have to remember that, young or old, it doesn't really matter.<br>    Now that I have told you your boyfriend is immature, do you think its really mature to break up in a text? Break ups are not easy, but I think you owe the person a little more respect than that, no matter how much of a jerk they may be at this point. And honey, no one makes you feel worse except for yourself. Yeah you are going to cry, and miss him, but you know something? You have to do what is best and what is right for you. This does not sound like a good relationship at all.<br>    If he is out of the country, what's to say that he doesn't have other girlfriends where he is? I doubt that he has not talked to any girls at all. You have to remember that you are both young, and really you should enjoy it. There are going to be many boyfriends in your life! I know that sounds really stupid, and when I was your age my parents would tell me the same thing, I never believed them. Everytime I broke up with someone I thought that my life was over. The truth is, its not, and it is actually just beginning.<br>    You will always miss someone when you break up. But I guarantee that once you do it, you will probably feel like a huge weight has lifted off of your shoulders. Its the hardest thing to do and sometimes I think its almost as bad as a death because the person is still alive, moving on, etc. You have to follow your heart on this.<br>    I personally think that you should try and enjoy your summer. Hang out with friends, travel and have fun. Don't moon over this guy for the whole summer because I sincerly doubt he is doing that over you. Heck you should even talk to new guys. Not saying date them but just make friends and have fun.<br>    Good luck and I hope this works out for you.|`|c66a7ab544ff69a844cb12cc8842563faa	If he is a jerk lately and you feel like you need to get out of the relationship and move on. If you start to miss him just remember how he made you feel. Trust me the feeling of missing him will go away|`|aa276d3039083d9924fbd428b4575e97aa	If you can try to call him.. its best if he hears it from you mouth.. otherwise he may not take it seriously. And if you text him you may be left wondering if he even read it..|`|AA11474433	Myspace is ALWAYS a problem in relationships, so what your saying is nothing new at all. If you want out of the relationship then do it. I am sure you deserve better anyways. He's obviously not ready to have ANY girlfriend if he needs to hide something like a little website page from her that's ridiculous and ignorant. I can't blame you for being uncomfortable, I would be too. Also, don't do the old text message thing, call him, tell him flat out. If he acts like a jerk, make sure you dont call him back, dont text him, and ignore him completely. Otherwise, he is going to continuously mess with your heart. It happened to me and I got completely messed up about. No one needs to deal with a complete jerk in their relationship, that's not a relationship, that's ignorance.

Como sea aquí te va el consejo de una chica de 15 a?os, que tal vez no conozca tanto del tema pero, que te da su visión de las cosas.<br>  Si tu esposa te traicionara estaría ella demostrando muy poca clase como mujer, clase que demostrarías tener tu comportándote como todo un caballero. Independientemente de que tendrías graves problemas  y de mas por las ideas que tienes, debes tener en cuenta que una traición es algo muy doloroso y se siente mas aun cuando viene de una persona a la que amamos y que creemos que nos ama, pero como un trago amargo más, de los que nos da la vida debes sobreponerlo con la frente muy en alto, y demostrar más que nunca los principios morales que te caracterizan, el concepto de mujer que tienes como hombre. En ocasiones una frase puede herir más que un golpe o una agresión.<br>  Ojala y nunca tengas que pasar por el dolor de una traición, pero si alguna vez te ocurre ten en cuenta que eres un hombre civilizado, con defectos y virtudes, pero que sobre todas las cosas sabes amar y respetar a una mujer, y jamás le harías da?o a una. Demuéstralo ante el mundo, demuéstrale a tu esposa que vales mas que ella, si llegara a traicionarte, solo la miras a los ojos, le dices eso que te esta quemando por dentro, y te das la vuelta, mirando al frente, y feliz, porque haz desechado algo inservible de tu vida, y porque comenzaras una nueva búsqueda, que te podrá satisfacer y llenar de felicidad, encontraras a quien realmente te merezca y aprecie como hombre y como persona, nadie merece que seas  infeliz por su causa. Y recuerda de ocurrir algo nunca dejes de sonreír pues no sabes quien se enamoraría de tu sonrisa.<br>  Podría llegar a entenderte, esos impulsos son propios del amor, pero si sigues mi consejo, cuando ocurra aquello a lo que temes no agredas a nadie, ni a la traidora ni al traidor, has lo que te digo y levántate de la caída, porque de no hacerlo el único que se hará da?o serás tu nadie mas, tu y tu conciencia, no te niegues la posibilidad de volver a ser feliz por una mala pasada que te puso enfrente la vida. El Truco del juego esta en saber levantarse luego de una caída, así solo te darás el valor que mereces y sentirás orgullo de ti y de tus actos. Espero que aceptes mi ayuda y mi concejo. Te deseo mucha suerte y felicidad, continúa creyendo en el amor que ese si es verdadero, se despide deseándote suerte y felicidad:   loK cabana, fue un placer ayudarte! <br>  CHAO!|`|26889f3d3094e19cd7da1f5caf96f5ecaa	Que estás loco.<br>  Acude a un psicólogo urgentemente.|`|3ff47a66f74b077ff0c11f52400201dbaa	Yo opino que definitivamente los seres humanos sufrimos mas por lo que no hemos vivido que por lo que vivimos... ánimo probablemente eso jamás ocurra.

Yo le sonrío a los chicos, pero si se detienen a hablar, como tengo novio, les digo solo un NO ME INTERESA. En un trabajo que antes tenía habían muchos chicos que me decían que sonriera, y yo les decía que no, peroesperaban que me distrajera en el trabajo y me llamaban. Al yo voltear, me sacaban una mueca taaaaaaaaaaann graciosa que no me contenía y me echaba a reír. Hubo un atrevido que hasta una foto me tomó, y la pasó a todo el mundo en el trabajo!!!!! Con esta experiencia, entendí que, si alguien me echa un piropo, pero con respeto, yo le doy las gracias, o simplemente le sonrío. Tú solo les echas tu sonrisa, eso no es nada malo, es una manera muda de expresarle a ella que le gustas o que es bonita, pero si no te devuelve la sonrisa, es una ignorante mal pensada.

AA12278998	You don't need much help, because although you don't realise it yet, you have the hard part cracked already.  You've been successfully flirting with her, remember.  <br>  <br>  First, always bear in mind that it doesn't matter if she says "no."  It actually does matter, because you fancy her rotten, but try to convince yourself that you really won't die a million deaths if she refuses.<br>  <br>  Second, as you are planning your approach, always additionally remember these words:  "There's always another woman."  Meaning, if she says no, it won't matter because you will be hot for some other chickybabe in about two days' time.  <br>  <br>  By the way, that bit will also be a lie you will be telling yourself because this girl in the store is drop dead gorgeous, sweet and kinda mysterious too isn't she?  So she's the only one you want anyway.<br>  <br>  Next, don't worry about it any more in any event, but simply ask her out immediately after the next time you make her laugh at something.  If she says no, keep up the flirting anyway, as its good practice for when you meet the girl for you...|`|2bfbef5927f2dfb3cf319f4fe62b39aeaa	Call her up and talk to her for about five minutes and then ask her to a movie or somethin'.|`|b20196923ee1e1fc23cdc9eaaa6c77b3aa	dont overdo it try something thats not so forward like coffee  ask her if she would like to jion you on her next break|`|b1df7c407308369213e18fbb70eb55d9aa	just walk up to her and ask her out! girls love a guy who dares to make the first move.. makes them feel sexy!|`|AA10289805	Definitely ask her for coffee. A movie won't get you in any conversations, and dinner will make her feel trapped if you don't hit it off. Coffee is casual, and if you don't hit it off, it's much less painful to break away. Also, make like you were going to go to get coffee anyway, and then you had the sudden urge to ask her to come along. It makes you seem spontaneous, but also that if she says no, you make it seem as if your fun is not dependent on her saying "Yes."

JR1pQcx9aa	Infatuation is a lot of the time based on physical attraction. If you're infatuated with someone you want to be with them all the time and you have a crush on them and you might feel a bit of chemistry with them. Love goes deeper than that. Love is about trusting someone else with your heart, being able to be completely yourself and not be afraid of them making fun of you. Love is when something's wrong you go to the other person because even if they can't do anything about it, their mere presence makes it better somehow. When you feel completely safe and loved and at home in their arms and trust them completely- that's love.|`|ac6603217db8bb7d01c5532e7d56bb81aa	Love is when you know the reality of someone, admire all their good points and accept their flaws and don't want too change them,it's not only a physical attraction,but you hold each other in such esteem that you trust each other with delicate emotions and issues ,share good times and support each other through the bad,respect each others opinions and reach compromises on issues which are going to affect both of you.Love is being true too yourself whilst respecting the other persons beliefs,needs and ideals.Infatuation is more to do with fantasy and imagination than reality,your usually focused only on the good things you see in them,and blind yourself too their flaws,you convince yourself they are everything you hope to find in a partner without actually knowing the facts of who they are in a deeper sense.|`|bded481be2e43e5792d0031407753012aa	infatuation leads to love|`|138bfe143b08ba4fd80d1cd77590df6baa	I think infatuation is the chase!!!

If she seems completely comfortable around you, that's a good sign.  When she looks at you, can you see all the way into her?  What I mean is, you can see a lot in someone's eyes, if they let you, so does she let you?<br>  <br>  If you are trying to figure out if this girl likes you, that's a tougher nut to crack.  Some girls are pretty obvious, but others play it cool.  Some will call you on the phone or ask why you never call, others will completely ignore you, pretend you don't exist.  If her behavior is extreme (in one way or the other) then she probably digs you.  If she falls somewhere in the middle, she's probably uninterested.  You never know, though.|`|AA11610725	She wants to be with you all the time.  She picks up the phone the vast majority of time when you call, rather than letting it go to voicemail.

Muito interessante! E muito corajoso e sincero da sua parte partilhar conosco o seu sonho. Os sonhos, para a psicanálise, s?o aspectos simbólicos do que está inconsciente em nós, pode-se saber algo sobre seu significado a partir de uma análise de nossa subjetividade, ou seja, de nossa maneira de ser e de nos relacionar. Se tiver interesse, vale à pena fazer análise, n?o precisa ter um problema psicológico específico, pois este é um trabalho muito mais de auto conhecimento.<br>  Quanto ao seu sonho, pense no que ele significa para você, de acordo com a história de vida de vocês e com o relacionamento de vocês. Vocês s?o gêmeos idênticos? Bem, n?o importa muito, o importante é saber que s?o pessoas diferentes, mesmo que muito parecidos fisicamente, cada um é único, tem sua própria vida, individualidade e personalidade. <br>  <br>  Tudo de bom,<br>                              Linda.|`|eHIkPq3Qaa	Engra?ado, vc me fez me lembrar que hoje sonhei que minha irm? estava tentando me estrangular...Mas, ao mesmo tempo eu sabia que n?o era ela...Que horror!!!!|`|yl6xqcoKaa	Sonhos s?o desejos ocultos...<br>  Melhor sonhar que fazer ...né...?|`|VDGsDt3Paa	Nossa amigo,sua narrativa me deixou,chocada,que sonho ruim,mas dizem que ter esse tipo de sonho,é excesso de preocupa??o.Reze antes de deitar viu?abra??o.

M1KZHqTuaa	Há aproximadamente 15 anos atrás quando eu era apenas uma crian?a, um anjo procurou-me e confiou a mim uma miss?o muito importante, ele me disse que o anjo mais lindo e mais especial do senhor avia sido enviado a terra, para levar alegria aos cora??es das pessoas que tenham o prazer e a sorte de conhecê-lo.<br>  E que o meu dever é proteger, amar, dar alegrias e muito carinho a este anjo, aquela situa??o me deixou muito espantado e sem entender muito do que estava acontecendo eu perguntei a ele, como iria fazer isso sendo t?o pequeno e fraco, ele me respondeu, que ia fazer com que eu crescesse e me tornasse uma pessoa com potencial para realizar tal tarefa.<br>  Ele também me disse que eu iria ter que procurar por este anjo e que durante esta procura, eu iria encontrar varias dificuldades, entre as quais fogo e água, sol e chuva, calor e frio, tristezas e alegrias, e que algumas vezes eu iria até me enganar achando que avia encontrado o meu anjo, e que por estes erros eu iria pagar caro, pagar com solid?o e sofrimento, mas que as duas maiores dificuldades mesmo iam ser, conquistar o meu anjo e o tempo.<br>  O tempo por que ele ia fazer com que eu ficasse ansioso e em alguns momentos até pensasse em desistir, mas ele também disse que conquistar o meu anjo n?o iria ser nada fácil, mas eu deveria persisti, persisti até consegui. E antes que ele encerra-se a conversa eu perguntei como ia saber quem é o meu anjo e ele me respondeu que eu iria saber quando o encontra-se, e que ia ser recompensado por todos os sacrifícios pelos quais passei e que o meu anjo ia ter o que lê foi prometido quando fostes envia do a terra.<br>  E agora tendo superado todas as dificuldades anteriores tenho certeza de que finalmente encontrei o meu anjo e é por isso que estou insistindo tanto, quero que saibas que gosto muito de você e que tenho certeza de que tu és o minha anjinha, talvez esta seja uma das ultimas chances que tenho de conquistar você, por isso, mesmo correndo o risco de parecer bobo, chato e n?o ser perdoado pelo silencio eu te pe?o “fica comigo!!!”.<br>  <br>  Beijos!!!!<br>  <br>  Quero meu presente!<br>  <br>  VH|`|24730779ce95c91202c6f3132a6334f1aa	Oi Gatinha morena!!<br>  <br>  Olha linda...<br>  Vou te apresentar para o meu primo...<br>  Só que vc vai ter que pegar um avi?o e ir para a Austrália..<br>  Ele está lá estudando,e pelo último contato que tivemos,<br>  ele estava sozinho...e procurando uma gata morena...<br>  Brincadeirinha..<br>  Um beijinho no teu cora??o...<br>  Kikka12|`|3041791e8eaa2b61b517244073fd147eaa	Olhe minha amiga,se depender de minhas ora??es,pode ficar certa que até lá, ele já chegou!<br>  Beijinhos,e n?o estou brincando,vou pedir a Deus que lhe mande um namorado a sua altura,tá?|`|5b6e45a83f25a8ffe55a98bbb22646fcaa	Posso ser seu candidato??

A tradu??o apressada de uma jornalista de televis?o levou a essa confus?o. O papa diz chaga, bem diferente de praga.<br>  O casamento deve ser indissolúvel, conforme ensina a Igreja, porque a separa??o do casal acarreta uma série de sofrimentos para ambos, os filhos, os demais familiares e contribuiu para desestruturar a sociedade. Boa parte da popula??o vai contra a Igreja em muitas quest?es, mas se você reparar, a Igreja está tentando manter os alicerces necessários para uma sociedade viver bem. Como a Igreja n?o manda na na??o, existe o conflito de idéias, mas tenha essa certeza: liberar o aborto, a eutanásia, o divórcio, o uso da maconha etc., trar?o uma série de problemas sociais mais graves ao país.<br>  As propostas da Igreja convidam a sociedade a voltar sua aten??o para Deus e os ensinamentos Dele, mas quem aceita ser justo, ser honesto, sacrificar seu tempo para ajudar o próximo, estender as m?os a quem precisa, vestindo os nus, alimentando os famintos? <br>  A sociedade secularista ensina o caminho inverso, colocando o hedonismo como a meta de todos, e dessa forma contribui para aumentar o comportamento egoísta.|`|05f96161a53bdc7a144104e0e75afc6caa	Como católico concordo com ele plenamente.<br>  <br>  abra?os<br>  @|`|6fCq9Cgsaa	N?o!

Tem duas que me marcaram para sempre.<br>  <br>  No inverno de 1988 (eu tinha 19 anos) viajei para Bariloche e conheci "acidentalmente" um argentino lindo, Rick,  que resolveu ser meu guia "turístico" por conta própria. Me levou nas boates mais badaladas daquele lugar lindíssimo, nos acompanhou em restaurantes e cafeterias. Parecia um sonho! Ficamos, mas n?o nos prometemos nada.  Na noite anterior ao meu retorno para o Brasil ele disse que viria me ver. Claro que n?o levei aquilo à sério. <br>  <br>  Mas, n?o é que em dezembro daquele mesmo ano o argentino veio e foi parar na minha casa? Ficou uma semana na minha cidade e depois foi embora. <br>  <br>  Alguns anos mais tarde, fiquei sabendo que ele se casou com uma brasileira e nos encontramos num jantar oferecido na casa da minha tia.<br>   <br>  Bom, outra vez aconteceu no Brasil mesmo, numa praia, época de carnaval. Eu estava engatando um namoro na minha cidade, mas fui para praia com algumas amigas e uma prima. Estávamos num quiosque quando vi um loiro dos olhos verdes (o rosto dele era tipo Richard Gere mais novo) e fiquei hipnotizada.<br>  <br>   Era um jogador de futebol, hoje é técnico. Ambos éramos solteiros e bem mais jovens, ficamos juntos durante o período que fiquei lá e parecia coisa de novela.  <br>  <br>  Mais tarde tentamos namorar, mas n?o deu certo. Fiquei insegura  pelo fato de ele ser jogador, n?o sei se aguentaria segurar a onda...<br>  <br>  Pois é, ambos foram inesquecíveis.

dUPiT1JSaa	Fizeram a gente acreditar que amor mesmo, amor pra valer, só acontece uma vez, geralmente antes dos 30 anos. N?o contaram pra nós que amor n?o é acionado, nem chega com hora marcada. <br>  Fizeram a gente acreditar que cada um de nós é a metade de uma laranja, e que a vida só ganha sentido quando encontramos a outra metade. N?o contaram que já nascemos inteiros, que ninguém em nossa vida merece carregar nas costas a responsabilidade de completar o que nos falta: a gente cresce através da gente mesmo. Se estivermos em boa companhia, é só mais agradável. <br>  Fizeram a gente acreditar numa fórmula chamada "dois em um": duas pessoas pensando igual, agindo igual, que era isso que funcionava. N?o nos contaram que isso tem nome: anula??o. Que só sendo indivíduos com personalidade própria é que poderemos ter uma rela??o saudável. <br>  Fizeram a gente acreditar que casamento é obrigatório e que desejos fora de hora devem ser reprimidos. <br>  Fizeram a gente acreditar que os bonitos e magros s?o mais amados, que os que transam pouco s?o caretas, que os que transam muito n?o s?o confiáveis, e que sempre haverá um chinelo velho para um pé torto. Só n?o disseram que existe muito mais cabe?a torta do que pé torto. <br>  Fizeram a gente acreditar que só há uma fórmula de ser feliz, a mesma para todos, e os que escapam dela est?o condenados à marginalidade. N?o nos contaram que estas fórmulas d?o errado, frustram as pessoas, s?o alienantes, e que podemos tentar outras alternativas. Ah, também n?o contaram que ninguém vai contar isso tudo pra gente.

E é a partir daí que o casal passa a ter mais certeza dos sentimentos, pq a paix?o de ínicio inebria tudo. Ent?o, quando passa essa fase, o casal alcan?a n?o só estabilidade, mas sobe um patamar na rela??o, agindo de forma mais madura, ponderada, comprometida, companheira e tal.|`|3GnBG3zPaa	a  paix?o sempre passa e normalmente n?o dura muito acho que  manter  um relacionamento  baseado na  paix?o n?o tem futuro hem.Quando estamos apaixonados n?o  vemos defeitos  achamos  que a pessoa e a  ideal  fantasiamos  muito,e  se  casarmos  com  a pessoa  na  primeira  noite já acaba a paix?o,pq  dai vemos que  ela tem defeito.o amor e  diferente a  gente ama mesmo com os defeitos  ama nas dificuldades.queremos  ver a outra pessoa  feliz mesmo n?o sendo com agente .|`|70c352650f271f880707efc64916620faa	Eu acredito que toda paix?o seja passageira. Paix?o é um estado de espírito em que nos encontramos quando acreditamos que aquela pessoa possui todos as qualidades que admiramos e que precisamos para nos sentirmos como seres humanos perfeitamente realizados; Ao conhecer uma pessoa com características que nos agradam, ficamos nas nuvens e passamos a viver dependentes da presen?a da pessoa em nossa vida, porém com o tempo os defeitos da pessoa v?o aparecendo, porque todos nós temos defeitos, e ent?o na medida que vamos descobrindo que a pessoa n?o é tudo aquilo que imaginávamos rasga-se a véu da fantasia e passamos a encarar a realidade. Por isso que a paix?o é diferente do amor, porque só quem ama é que consegue conservar o mesmo sentimento puro e cristalino, sabendo aceitar a pessoa amada com as suas qualidades, e também os seus defeitos. A estabilidade entre o casal somente poderá ocorrer quando ambos entendem o que acabo de explicar aqui. Te desejo muita felicidade no amor.|`|767dcb7f3af4ae203bdd38a1b7a9b4e0aa	passa sim, e falo com experiencia, pois já passei por todas as fases de uma rela??o, sou casada há trinta anos, e hoje só resta a amizade e solidariedade, o que é uma coisa triste, pois eu queria muito reviver a paix?o do come?o, talvez com o mesmo homem ou n?o!.beijos.|`|UGV0gzPKaa	claro depois de dezoito meses, n?o há quem aguente. aí se tudo estiver bem a coisa passa para outra fase, o amor|`|2uxXubKuaa	Acho q a paix?o dura o tempo suficiente para a gente conhecer melhor a pessoa que está do nosso lado. Ela camufla os defeitos e depois q todo esse encantamento inicial passa é que chegamos a conclus?o se vamos adiante ou n?o. Daí chegamos numa fase mais tranquila da rela??o, qdo obtemos a aprova??o do outro. Oq posso dizer é que todo relacionamento tende a ficar monótono se n?o cuidarmos dele. Depende de vc e seu parceiro cultivarem a cada dia o amor de vcs. Após longos anos, creio q oq resta mesmo é o companheirismo... Cabe a vc conformar-se com isso ou correr em busca de um novo amor!|`|DtTIuXdVaa	oi gata.<br>  tudo e relativo. aprimeima paixao e inesquecivel devido ser aprimeiva vez que isso acontece. mas sa~so coisas que variam de pessoa para pessoa . quando amadurecemos vimos qwue muita coisa foi bobagem e tudo n?o passou de uma emo??o.<br>  beijos|`|KDXv070maa	Nao sei, viu.. ainda mais se for a 'primeira fase' aih fica mais dificil..principalmente pq a paixao eh uma coisa meio rapida, paixao nem sempre dura muito.. mas conforme for passando o tempo e tu come?ar a gostar cada dia mais da pessoa, tu pode AMAR aih eh diferente.. ai com crteza pode haver uma estabilidade sim ! bah se tu for pensar, depende mais da situa?ao.. bjoo!!|`|eZEG1YEHaa	Com toda certeza.Nessa estabilidade combina-se a raz?o com o cora??o...há maior equilibrio nas emo??es.|`|fcc3bb0bc34889210c6df15f7f2eece0aa	é o que confunde as pessoas de achar que acabou o relacionamento pois a paixao dura muito pouco o que fica de verdade é o amor a paixao ve roupa corpo tesao etc o amor vem de dentro nao ve cor nem raca nem nada só apenas acontece amor nao discrimina e a paixao sempre vem com forca deixando a gente doida mais se depois da paixao nao ficar o amor nao adianta que nao tem jeito existem pessoas que passam pela nossa vida causando a tal da paixao um fogo doido que depois vai se apagando agora o amor a gente nunca esquece|`|q2dwatV4aa	passa, no come?o é a explos?o de querer ficar junto, pois aquilo na sua vida vc p?e como prioridade, conhecer a pessoa que vc está se relacionando, isso vc faz sem erceber, naum e premeditado, depois que vc ja a conhece um pouco naum ha mais a necessidade de firem t?o juntos.... depois fica com saudades... akela vontadesinha de estar junto....<br>  agora como os outro responderam, falar de amor, é um assunto muito polêmico, pois eu sou do principio que amor naum é um sentimento e sim uma decis?o, vc decide amar e decide deixar de amar....por isso algumas vezes amor se transforma em odio, pois vc decidiu isso e realizou esse a??o...<br>  e isso|`|AA12005596	Nenhuma paix?o resiste ao tempo. Tudo vira uma grande e tediosa ROTINA. Você deve rezar pra que, nessa ocasi?o, seu parceiro n?o procure novas aventuras. Geralmente é o que acontece. Digamos, em 99% dos casos.

E eu me julgo feliz, tento sempre. Esses dias mesmo, eu estava super chateada porque n?o fui a um show que gostaria muito; por isso estava maltratando todos da minha casa. Mas depois fui pensar bem, e descobri que isso é o mínimo, qu?o egoísta e mesquinha eu estava sendo. Tanta gente sofrendo por aí, com fome, sem teto, sem família.

O que poderia ser parte do amadurecimento do homem, mostrando para ele que de vez em quando é preciso retroceder para avan?ar.<br>  <br>  O homem poderia despencar da escada e se ferir bastante, e seria a decis?o mais difícil:  recome?ar do zero ou desistir. é preciso muita coragem e for?a interior para n?o desistir, mas a op??o é do homem.<br>  <br>  !|`|a9f4abfc1dcc7f26b870e7311b84e6daaa	Realizei o sonho, de estar ao lado da mulher que eu amo, foi o máximo|`|hjBQQM8zaa	Olá....meu final de semana foi muito bom...pois o + importante é que na segunda-feira estou aqui respondendo no Y!R...e é  muito bom come?ar a semana lendo pensamentos que nos fazem refletir....<br>   Obrigado e desejo a vc também uma ótima semana e um ótimo feriado!!!!|`|AA12005596	Puxa Mineirinho os pensamentos diários que você tráz s?o muito significativos.

HmbhAJb4aa	Ser perfeita é ser lindinha, fofinha, meiga, inteligente, independente e acima de tudo que seja sonhadora, que busque seus objetivos e que jamais fique atrás de min, e sim ao meu lado.|`|af9ace2e555a5cfb533ec610c2511011aa	Ser perfeita? Ser desencucada e aceitar-se como é.|`|0c18d04ee3f270924046568abae03c74aa	é a mulher que é ela mesma, sem disfarce e tentando só querer agradar.|`|AA12005596	Mulher perfeita n?o existe, assim como homem perfeito também n?o. Todos têm seus erros, mas eu acho, sinceramente que ambos devem procurar, num relacionamento, a CUMPLICIDADE. Esse é o único caminho viável para que ambos se percebam um pouco mais "perfeitos".|`|I8wAbqiSaa	Mulher perfeita é aquela que sabe utilizar das três armas poderosíssimas que têem consigo: 1) Lágrimas, 2) Cosméticos, 3) N?o preciso citar aqui!!!|`|MhiR7Mmaaa	Depende do ponto de vista, ser "perfeita" para mim, é n?o ficar no meu pé o tempo todo, ter caráter, assumir o seu verdadeiro papel como mulher, n?o só se considerar um símbolo sexual, se ela estiver feliz consigo mesma, ent?o estou feliz com ela. A auto-realiza??o conta muito também...|`|2c603a78f065db4e6025f617542b44f9aa	Homens e mulheres s?o iguais, mas as mulheres ficam insuportáveis quando querem ser iguais aos homens. Isso explica o fato porque elas querem ser perfeitas.|`|AXTqNuOYaa	Na realidade n?o s?o as mulheres que querem ser perfeitas, s?o os homens que n?o sabem valorizar a vaidade da mulher. Que por outro lado n?o deve ser excessiva, deve ser moderada na medida do possível. Para que n?o hajam perguntas  desse tipo. A mulher sempre tem algo a melhorar e o homem sempre tem algo para reparar! Para mim mulher perfeita n?o é aquela que tem muita beleza física, mas sim aquela que sabe dar muito amor e  carinho para um homem sem levar em conta seus pequenos defeitos!|`|NULvYvSOaa	é ter conteúdo na cabe?a.|`|XbToUHZjaa	Já ouviu aquele ditado que diz que a grama do vizinho é sempre mais verde e bonita que a sua???? Ent?o, para mim mulher perfeita é aquela que se cuida e produz sem exageros e que seja uma ótima dona de casa e realizada profissionalmente, será que pedi demais?????

BjTp5Lz9aa	N?o, n?o é. Minha amiga casou-se com 37 e a outra n?o casou mas teve uma filha com 41. Isso n?o quer dizer nada, se os dois est?o a fim, os preconceituosos que se danem! Tem gente que quer determinar idade para tudo como se fosse regra a ser fielmente cumprida, n?o existe nenhuma lei que diz que a pessoa tem de casar com essa ou aquela idade. O Oscar Niemeyer vai fazer cem anos em dezembro e se casou um dia desses e está feliz da vida. Imagina se tivesse lei para n?o se casar depois de uma certa idade, ele n?o teria se casado e com certeza estaria infeliz. Portanto, seja feliz você também ou com 36 anos ou mais, isso n?o importa. Feliciades!

Agora, n?o existe época para casamento, porque casar n?o é cronometria, mas sim uma quest?o de você encontrar a pessoa com  quem está disposta a viver essa experiência de vida.No Brasil, as mulheres com mais de 30, s?o consideradas coroas,  praticamente velhas pela maioria das pessoas, o que é uma pena porque na Europa mulheres de nossa idade est?o come?ando a vida delas.<br>  Portanto n?o se sinta velha para casar ou ter seus filhos. Apenas fa?a as coisas n?o em fun??o do tempo, mas em fun??o do que é bom para você e para a sua vida. N?o case por desespero ou press?o social. Beijos!!!|`|sglK6hoDaa	eu achou que n?o..............

AA12005596	Por que tanto medo? Ele n?o está bem num relacionamento e vai procurar algo melhor pra ele. Saiba que ele está sendo sincero, pois n?o ocultou o fato de estar saindo de um relacionamento. ele bem que poderia mentir e ficar quieto sobre a outra, mas te falou.

Só te pe?o cautela, talvez ele esteja sendo sincero, mas como ter tanta certeza se vocês se correspondem a maior parte do tempo por msn, aliás atrás do teclado existem muitos atores, ent?o querida, tenha muita cautela, como ele pode achar o futuro se n?o consegue se resolver no hoje???<br>  <br>  Kalinka|`|SXSnfQtYaa	Assim que ele terminar?

Acontece que n?o podemos culpar as pessoas por suas falhas, pois também somos falíveis. Saiba de uma coisa Carlos: n?o existe ninguém perfeito... as pessoas vêm e v?o de nossas vidas... novos "amigos" aparecem e assim vamos caminhando. Todo mundo quer ter um amigo especial, um amigo do peito, daqueles que a gente pode botar a m?o no fogo, mas, infelizmente  um dia haveremos de ver que tais pessoas n?o s?o super-heróis, pois elas também têm suas fraquezas, seus deslizes, seus martírios e por   que n?o, suas decep??es. <br>  N?o se lamente. Fa?a uma coisa: lavente a cabe?a, sacuda a poeira e dê a volta por cima.|`|c9a2fce30d200e2fd551431cb5e73b88aa	Peraí, só vc q n?o percebeu q algumas mulheres usam a amizade como arma pra ter mais próximo o homem por quem elas est?o apaixonadas.<br>  As filhas devem ter enfiado isso na cabe?a dela, de q n?o vale a pena ser conselheira sentimental e nem psicóloga de uma pessoa q acelera o cora??o.<br>  Talvez ela tenha se cansado, se fazendo de boazinha, boa ouvinte e td mais, chega, acabou!!!<br>  Se vc só quer esta mulher pra ser sua conselheira, a deixe, assim ela sofrerá menos!!!|`|IdfVFqCmaa	Você assiste malha??o?

Vc já se questionou quanto a isto? Será que ela era sua "melhor amiga", esperando a oportunidade  de reatar um grande amor?<br>  Amigo, vc deveria primeiro saber se ela, estaria disposta a te ouvir realmente seus casos amorosos...<br>  <br>  Boa sorte...|`|qg0nQv1Paa	Você já parou para pensar se fez alguma coisa que á magoou??<br>  As vezes ela tomou essa atitude pq está magoada com você! Nem sempre o jeito em que tratamos uma pessoa é o jeito que ela irá nos tratar, e infelizmente é isso o que esperamos. Amizade acima de tudo é saber compreender e aceitar as pessoas como elas s?o. E nunca desistir e procurar saber o que está acontecendo. Pois as vezes acaba-se perdendo a amizade por motivos inuteis.
KskpPIhTaa	Olá... Amiga a sua situa??o é engra?ada e complicada ao mesmo tempo, mas n?o é de rir... Mas posso dizer que o destino se é que você acredita nele está próximo de acontecer... N?o sou vidente nem nada parecido, mas vejo que vocês gostam um do outro mas n?o se encaixaram em algumas coisas ou pensam da mesma maneira. Acho que falta muito diálogo entre vocês os dois.

Para você conseguir esquecê-lo, você teria de estar longe dele, n?o vê-lo t?o cedo, n?o conversar, n?o telefonar, n?o passar e-mails, etc. Se ele diz que te ama, o que está esperando, garota, caia nos bra?os do seu amado e viva muito feliz, mas muito feliz mesmo!!!!

3VMWojbgaa	Viver a dois n?o é fácil, mas poucos resistem a um cora??o batendo acelerado, resultando no casamento. Só que com o tempo surgem as diferen?as e muitos casais acabam desgastando o relacionamento por caírem no mesmo erro repetidas vezes. O casal que mantém um diálogo aberto supera com mais facilidade os momentos difíceis. <br>  Assim que é detectado que algo n?o está certo, é preciso imediatamente tentar o diálogo. Isso é benéfico para o relacionamento a dois. N?o deixe acumular conversas, para depois sentar e dizer o que está incomodando. Se a mulher optar por isso, pode correr o risco de deixar o parceiro paralisado com tanta informa??o afetiva. <br>  Para o casal recém-formado, é importante deixar definidos os pontos específicos do dia-a-dia a dois. Diga o que você gosta e o que n?o gosta para que a rela??o cres?a saudável. Essa é uma forma de evitar desgastes na rela??o. <br>  Muitas s?o as pessoas que buscam encontrar a sua alma gêmea, e nesta busca muitos acabam se decepcionando por n?o encontrar uma pessoa que realmente corresponda este amor que está em seu cora??o. Outros n?o sabem como vencer as diferen?as e as brigas e lutas fazem-na desistir. <br>  Uma das coisas mais importantes na vida de qualquer pessoa é o casamento.é ter alguém para compartilhar as lutas e tristezas mais também muitas alegrias com suas vitórias.<br>  Antes de você se casar e se comprometer com alguém, que vai desempenhar um papel t?o importante em sua vida, certifique-se. N?o tome atitudes somente pelo amor que você sente por ele, porque isso n?o é o suficiente. Quantas pessoas se casaram por causa do amor, mas agora est?o sofrendo?|`|24529ae0aff0b97bef5aa9658f043f58aa	Vai de encontro à natureza humana, pois nossos horm?nios têm vontade própria!

Hj em dia para se assumir um casamento é preciso ter estrutura psicológica, pq concerteza mexe com todos os seus sentimentos. N?o vou dizer q ? é maravilhoso ter a pessoa com quem vc sonhou a vida inteira dormindo ao teu lado, é a realiza??o de um sonho.

No casamento uma mulher para ser feliz tem que se sentir muito amada, desejada e principalmente respeitada. Já passei por uma situa?ao um pouco parecida em que meu marido só queria estar com amigos ao invés de estar comigo, chegou uma hora que tive que dar um basta pois as pessoas estavam comentando que ele estava com outra pessoa ent?o achei que ele n?o estava me respeitando.e disse que ia embora me mudei de onde eu estava morando e ele opinou vir comigo para outro lugar e hoje estamos come?ando do zero, pois temos duas filhas e para mim elas s?o as pessoas mais importante da minha vida ,amo meu marido mas pela minha felicidade e de minhas filhas eu preferir abrir m?o de tudo. por isso converce e reflita diante de tudo que ele te disser e tire a conclus?o que você achar melhor .

Ou1miaKsaa	Penso que hoje em dia as pessoas n?o querem assumir um compromisso sério. Se repararmos, as pessoas se casam já pensando no "e se n?o der certo?", ou seja, já entram no relacionamento inseguras, sem a certeza de que ele/ela é a pessoa certa. Outro fator que penso destruir os casamentos é o egoísmo. O casamento é pra "eu fazer o outro feliz" e n?o só pra "me fazer feliz", as pessoas têm que se sair delas mesmas e estarem dispostas a abrir m?o do que querem pelo outro, isso é o verdadeiro amor e se um casal age assim se mantêm firme diante de qualquer coisa.|`|AA12005596	Faz muito tempo que casamento é uma institui??o falida.|`|142b1aab2f576ee2448a664261d35a26aa	porq falta o dialago...<br>  bom,qdo estao namorando é uma coisa,nao podem dormir na mesma cama,nem fika o dia todo junto..qdo casam,passam todas as noites juntos...e nao conseguem lidar com iso...|`|31f6fa3ccfe85c7ee511bbdc00933245aa	Porque a concorrência é grande.|`|86c963ea9f578eb933ea079cb81f7320aa	A falta de amor e a amizade acabam com a convivencia, os jovens ainda indecisos, e o trabalho dificil, tambem terminam os casamentos|`|WZEjOngWaa	Eu n?o sei.

A ESCOLHA DE AMAR A MESMA PESSOA TODOS OS DIAS.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Estou prestes a casar em 2008.<br>  <br>  Bjos e que Deus aben?oe a todos!|`|3a6824e08e1831555ce5d5dfe5784ee0aa	ent?o...acredito que veja bem....<br>  <br>  mais por causa das mulheres (infelismente) eles no namoro querem parecer a mulher perfeita e acabam se anulando. Suas caracteristicas pessoais, como gostos, vontades, interesses, dentre outras para viverem o que o parceiro quer, isso tudo somente para agradá-los e eles acharem que que elas s?o a mulher da vida deles. Ai meu caro, quando ele (já certo, enganado, iludido que ela é a mulher ou pode ser a mulher da vida dele ele se casa)....<br>  <br>  Daí como n?o tem como ser asssim  sempre, pois no convívio direto dia-a-dia é bem dificil de n?o ser você! Acaba....pois é ai que ele encherga que essa n?o foi a mulher com quem ele andou e conheceu!<br>  <br>  Espero que consiga entender minha teoria!!!<br>  <br>  N?o acredito que o fim do casamento esta t?o voltado a diferen?as de personalidades, pois quem ama compreende e respeita as diferen?as , principalmente que é inteligente!

989b880d0cf1e9075c80d658afbe9d87aa	I think that your sister is being very ignorant and I'm guessing that she probably has no children.  You need to explain to her that your very sensitive about the subject of weight and that you would appreciate it, if she kept those comments to herself.  It sounds as though your husband was sticking up for you and that he realized she was being ignorant and that is why he didn't encourage her behavior.  When you are pregnant, your emotions go haywire, but you had every right to be upset at your sister, that wasn't right of her to do.|`|1kwYDb85aa	Yeah, you are overreacting. Why do you care what anyone thinks?  Are you happy being pregnant? Are you looking forward to raising children? We all change as we age, and I'm sure you're sister's body isn't perfect. You have more important things to concern yourself with right now and the stress you are creating in yourself isn't helping your babies right now. Relax, be happy, you'll be fine soon enough. Besides...it's not what's outside that makes you who you are, it's what's inside, behind those beautiful eyes that matters. <br>  <br>  Okay, so it's time to grow up.  Everyone is entitled to their opinion and your sister is no different than any other woman on the street, she's just another person that happens to be your sister...and quite possibly a jerk. You may be related, but you don't have to like her, or see her, or talk with her...just like anyone else. If she says hateful things, let her opinion roll off, you know the truth about you..not her.<br>  <br>  Good luck with those babies!|`|3PCcQu2vaa	I, personally, don't know how to react....I never had that kind of experience, so...yeah.  But I think it's okay to react like that, you change.  Everyone does, and everyone who has a baby change as well.  It's all normal, and even though it's sad to see your body change, you have to learn to live with it.  Hope you feel better soon:D|`|AA10046329	a real man don't care what you look like. wait until u had the twins and  u get more Mother I Like Fudge look.   i know u get  small looks now.mmmmph./|`|f0f49830d899d32e723fa4545fb903ebaa	Who cares about what your sister thinks. If you and your hubbie like it then i don't think much else matters. If your having twins then she really can't say anything because you have to small people inside of you. She is probably just jealous so don't let if phase you.

Dentro da fragilidade da pontua??o,cada um lê o que quer ou que lhe parece. Quantas vezes dizemos olá!! E leêm Olá! Gosto de vc!!! etc... Temos ent?o que explorar bem o<br>  teclado!!! Quantas vezes nossas inten??es s?o lidas de maneira diferente, à mercê do humor e da pontua??o de quem está do outro lado? Inúmeras, todas! Já<br>  pararam para pensar: Eles vem e v?o de nossas caixas de mensagens,e nós entramos e saimos de suas listas de e-mails..etc... Quantoas morreram e n?o sabemos?<br>  Quantoas digitam piadas com os olhos emba?ados de lágrimas!  (isso eu fiz tantas vezes) Quantos retratos mentirosos...talvez!!!..ou n?o?!...ou sim!!! Quantas<br>  verdades nas entrelinhas... N?o podemos saber, n?o vemos de fato. Mas podemos ter a sensibilidade da sintonia humana, a fé no semelhante,a inocência pretendida,podemos sentir quando se v?o, e quando n?o nos querem mais? Podemos sim, tratá-loas com o respeito que merecem, respondendo todas as sua perguntas, mandando todas as mensagens, repassando  todos os seus créditos, considerando-os do bem. Para que um dia,quando n?o estiverem mais aqui,se tenha só saudade,e n?o mágoa e raiva. Porque esta é a frágil liga??o virtual,as vezes<br>  e muitas vezes t?o realmente importante para fazer o dia de alguém, melhor. Mas que,quando nos deparamos com a realidade de que os fatos s?o virtualmente frágeis... E que esseas que se foram de nossa telinha podem nunca mais<br>  retornar... ou sim!! Conhecemos enfim,a morte virtual...ou n?o!! Só resta o luto de uma simples,mas sincera, poesia in memorian, por uma perda sentida e virtualmente real...e se sente. E existe. E antes que você se perca de mim também, saiba que meu endere?o principal é: ee.paulovargas@hotmail.com, aonde estou diariamente e de lá, você terá acesso ao meu orkut, meu Yahoo, meu Gmail etc, etc, etc...

AnTriKmlaa	Mel<br>  Laika<br>  Penelope<br>  Brenda<br>  Menina<br>  Nina<br>  Pipoca<br>  Vick<br>  Teka|`|AA12005596	LAIKA.<br>  <br>  A EMOCIONANTE HISTóRIA REAL DE UMA CADELA:<br>  <br>  Laika (em russo: Лайка, "latidora") foi uma cadela do grupo de cachorros do programa espacial soviético e se tornou notória por ser o primeiro ser vivo a entrar em órbita. Originalmente Kudryavka, foi rebatizada para Laika, nome de sua ra?a.<br>  <br>  Sputnik II<br>  Depois do sucesso do Sputnik I, Nikita Khrushchov, líder soviético à data, quis lan?ar um segundo engenho espacial a 7 de Novembro, dia em que se comemorava o 40o aniversário da Revolu??o Bolchevique. Um satélite muito mais sofisticado estava já em constru??o, mas n?o ficaria concluído antes de Dezembro. Este satélite viria a ser o Sputnik III.<br>  <br>  De forma a cumprir o prazo de Novembro, um novo e menos sofisticado projeto teria de ser executado. De acordo com fontes soviéticas, a decis?o oficial de lan?ar o Sputnik 2 foi tomada a 10 ou 12 de Outubro, deixando a equipe com apenas quatro semanas para projetar e construir a nave espacial. O Sputnik II foi, desse modo, uma espécie de trabalho feito às pressas, com a maior parte dos elementos da nave a serem constuídos a partir de esbo?os rudimentares. Para além da miss?o primária de enviar um ser vivo ao espa?o, o Sputnik II também continha instrumentos para medir a radia??o solar e raios cósmicos.<br>  <br>  Laika foi instalada em seu habitáculo no satélite três dias antes do lan?amento. A miss?o tinha o objetivo de obter informa??es científicas sobre o comportamento de um animal no espa?o.<br>  <br>  3 de novembro de 1957: Pouco depois do lan?amento, os soviéticos declararam que Laika n?o voltaria à Terra, e morreria no espa?o (já era previamente sabido que n?o haviam procedimentos para a recupera??o da nave). Tal revela??o viria a ser motivo de muitos protestos de organiza??es de defesa dos direitos dos animais em todo o mundo.<br>  <br>  Depois de chegar à órbita terrestre, o cone do nariz foi ejetado com sucesso, mas o Bloco A n?o se separou como planjeado, fazendo com que o controle térmico n?o funcionasse corretamente. Parte do isolamento térmico também se soltou. Conseqüentemente, a temperatura na cabine subiu até aos 40°C (104°F), a partir daí foi registrado pelos sensores ligados a Laika um ritmo cardíaco três vezes acima do normal.<br>  <br>  Em novembro de 1997, 40 anos depois, uma placa comemorando as contribui??es de Laika e outros animais que foram estudados no programa espacial foi descerrada no instituto onde a cadela foi treinada.<br>  <br>  Em 1998, após o colapso do regime soviético, Oleg Gazenko, um dos cientistas responsáveis pelo envio de Laika ao espa?o desabafou: "Quanto mais o tempo passa, mais eu sinto por isso. Nós n?o devíamos ter feito isso. Nós n?o aprendemos o bastante com essa miss?o para justificar a morte da cadela."<br>  <br>  As autoridades soviéticas contaram na época que Laika morreu sem sofrer nenhum trauma, cerca de uma semana após o lan?amento do foguete. Entretanto, Dimitri Malashenkov, um dos cientistas soviéticos envolvidos no projeto Sputnik 2 revelou em um congresso espacial internacional (The World Space Congress) realizado em Houston, Texas em outubro de 2002, que Laika morreu numa situa??o de calor e panico, entre cinco e sete horas após o lan?amento, momento em que se deixou de receber os sinais vitais da cadela. "Era praticamente impossível construir um sistema de controle de temperatura confiável dentro do prazo estabelecido", disse o cientista.<br>  <br>  Em decorrência desta história, atualmente milhares (sen?o milh?es) de cadelas por todo o mundo respondem pelo nome de "Laika". Este nome tornou-se t?o popular que algumas pessoas batizam seus c?es de "Laika" sem mesmo saber por quê.|`|3ff1e06de8e4ea4eee58e86188a04a65aa	SPICE|`|1746871ca673d357665890957fcc30c1aa	XULA.....CHULA...UMA DAN?A GAúCHA TCHê!|`|a0987232fa306599f13f8463b24bf6daaa	Gostei de ver uma cadela...era da ra?a labrador...e se chamava Africa...gostei..pq era diferente...e com personalidade!

Perhaps she watches it because that is the only porn out there. Would you rather she watch gay porn? Or is it the entire porn watching that you disagree with? Does she watch alone, or only with you?<br>  <br>  Another thing to think about. Porn is by and large about women having sex with other women.

A trai??o nao está simplesmente no ato fisico, mas sim na intens?o, se ele se masturba pensando nessas mulheres, é porque ele as deseja, e se ele as deseja vc deve pensar se considera ou nao trai??o.<br>  <br>  Dizem que, nao se deve reprimir os desejos e que algumas pessoas separam muito bem o amor do sexo, mas sinceramente,     hoje existe desculpa pra tudo enquanto é coisa errada e sem lógica, <br>  <br>  Na minha opniao, se fosse o contrário ele nao gostaria, e se sentiria traído.   Ent?o fa?a o seguinte, pelo menos algumas vezes comece a falar sobre outros caras e a olhar homens nús perto dele, ai vc vai ver se isso o encomoda, com certeza no início ele vai achar que é só provoca??o, mas com pouco tempo vc vai atingir o seu ego, assim como ele faz com você,<br>  <br>  Lembre-se nao existe principe encantado e a maioria dos relacionamentos, sao jogos de interesses.<br>  <br>  Você tambem pode pensar o seguinte, ele gosta de voce, mas como vc talvez nao seja do jeito que sao essas mulheres, talvez esse tipo chame mais a aten?ao.<br>  <br>  <br>  Sintetizando seu namorado é um babaca que nao sabe valorizar as pessoas que gostam dele. Se ele nao é capaz de descobrir desejo em você entao ele nao te merece.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Boa sorte! e nao perca seu tempo com babacas!!!!!!|`|coruAjlMaa	bom me desculpe mas eu acho qui o seu namorado nao está mais afim de vc ..<br>  pra ele fala dese jeito com vc ..<br>  arruma alguem que te ama!|`|e330877bb960303ade365fd65bb2baa0aa	N?o pense nunca que está sem atrativos para ele ..isso é como uma fantasia e em fantasia n?o′há trai??o ou troca ...se masturbar é uma coisa deliciosa...eu sempre fa?o pela manh?...mesmo quando durmo acompanhado...desencane.. é por sermos t?o bem resolvidos neste campo que tratamos o sexo com mais desenvoltura...seja menos maleta e deixe o cara em paz...aproveite e fa?a o mesmo ...ele aposdto que vai curtir ...<br>  <br>  beijinhosssss...na sua boquinha ""!!!.|`|mT4FwKwOaa	acredito que voce esta pegando pesado é lógico que vc deve se sentir mal mas isso é instinto e n?o quer dizer q ele naum te ame, com vc ele faz amor naum é?|`|ms0Yd7kuaa	é apenas um tipo de fetiche<br>  <br>  onde o homem sente prazer em realizar|`|oYwoVEU2aa	Me desculpe, mas serei machista. Eu entendo os homens eu axo q isso n?o passa d uma nessecidade. Axo q sou diferente pq eu n?o penso no meu namorado se eh eu q to, mas eu tive um namorado q se masturabava bastante, e era increvelmente tarado por mim e me satisfazia 100% E ele dizia q podia ver fotos mas pensava em mim tbm. E eu nunk tive nóia. Mas dai vai d vcs. Se entre vcs eh tudo ótimo na cama. E vc tbm pode ajudar a fazer ele so qrer pensar em vc. mulher tem seus metodos. capricha numa langerie, uma fantasia!! Vale tudo!!!|`|tqaB4Ep1aa	Iiiiiiiiii, homens? A grande maioria faz isso, n?o se sinta inferior por isso, nada mais é do que um fetiche. é a forma como eles s?o educados, que homens tem que achar mulher gostosa, assobiar, gritar, tem que ter sexo a todo momento que sentirem vontade, é da natureza deles. O mundo que vivemos é um mundo machista, n?o se preocupe, tire umas fotos sua e salve no pc, mostre a ele que o que as outras tem vc também tem. E muito melhor do que elas pois vc está ali perto dele, e as outras só pode ser na imagina??o.|`|vLzRjhT9aa	? te sintas mal nem feia!NEM PENSAR!!tens d lhe mostrar k tu és muito melhor do k akelas mulheres e sabes dar tanto ou mais tesao do k elas.por isso, poe uma roupa bem sexy e mostra o k vales!!boa sorte!|`|xv9E50Xeaa	voce n?o esta exagerando,apenas se encontra confusa.<br>  o homem tem uma nescecidade de conquista insaciável.<br>  como ele n?o pode buscar isso fora do relacionamento,acaba encontrando outras formas de se realizar.<br>  n?o fique chateada com ele,pois todos temos os nossos defeitos e o mais importante é q isso nunca influencie na vida sexual de voces dois.<br>  e quer saber:de gra?as a Deus que ele só se masturba que do jeito que as coisas est?o,o mais normal é trair mesmo.
