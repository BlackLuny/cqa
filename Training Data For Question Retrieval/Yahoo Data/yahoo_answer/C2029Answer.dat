kmQRtw30aa	Not sure why you would stream Blu Ray movies from your laptop to your PS3 as it is capable of playing Blu Ray movies itself. If you have Windows Media Player 11 on your PC then you already have the capability to share all your PC's media library with your PS3. This includes movies, photos and music.    The PS3 supports DLNA which allows it to talk to a media server over your local area network, whether it's wired or wireless. On your PS3 go to the 'Network Settings' area of the dashboard and ensure that 'Media Server Connection' is enabled.  On your PC, open Windows Media Player 11, click on the 'Tools' menu and choose 'Options'. There is a tab called 'Library' which contains a button called 'Configure Sharing'. Click it and you should see an 'Unknown Device' listed - which is actually your PS3. Allow it access to your media and your done! You may want to click the 'Monitor Folders' button to set which folders you want to share.    Now if you go to the 'Photo', 'Music' or 'Video' areas on your PS3 dashboard you will see an icon for your PC which you can choose and browse your media.|`|53sVKcOeaa	You just set a directory to aim at where the movie is stored. It has to be on the hard drive not a disk.
xazut5X7aa	all xbox's make that noise when they are in use. there are things you can buy to help cool it down so it does not make that loud of a noise anymore. xbox 360 is still definitely worth it though :)|`|aMz996KDaa	I got the same 360 at about the same time, i think something might be wrong with youre 360 cause mine makes noise, but not to the point where it gets annoying. Try calling 1800-4-myxbox, if its broken theyll charge you only $100 to get it fixed or replaced.|`|s3YmrM9zaa	that happens to me sometimes as well    im pretty sure it happens because either the fan is covered up on the xbox and it cant cool off or you have been playing for too long. i dont think its anything serious|`|fa3CBc6Taa	It might have extra trouble reading the disk and the disk is pushing up against something, I'm not sure. It probably isn't but beware of red ring of death which the processer lighting on fire.|`|smFfcmYuaa	Is it only now getting louder or has it always been the same volume? The main sources of noise for a game system itself are the cooling fan (mostly this), the hard disk drive (which spins), and the dvd/cd drive (in other words the game spinning around at high speed as the data is read). All of which are annoying and none of which you can really do anything about.     My personal attempt at a workaround is shoving game systems in the drawers and cabinets of my entertainment center and leading all the cables out through the back. This doesn't block the noise out all the way but it does curb it a bit.    Conversely if the noise has only recently gotten bad it could be due to any of those parts wearing down or failing but it shouldn't be any kind of chip issue.|`|aIVVv4A0aa	It is getting old. You could also check the chip by using this,   http://xbox.joystiq.com/tag/jasper, and  http://www.anandtech.com/gadgets/showdoc...    also, it could be the Xbox itself|`|T3weBwCTaa	well what kind of noises, mine sometimes makes this ugly short grinding noise so i just dust it off and blow in the holes.    so just try getting the dust out|`|7c6hkUbTaa	...it growls at you? it wants you to play better games! :)|`|VFOyzZJIaa	Could be overheating. Maybe one of the fans is broken. This may make it a bit noisier, but you could go out and buy a cooling unit.  If you already have a cooling unit on, take it off, they are pretty loud.      By the way, my 360 use to do this. Guess what I did? Smacked it on the side so hard it shut up for good.|`|8szFciqnaa	This is how my xbox is. When i'm in the dashboard it is very silent, but when i start up a game disc it becomes loud and humming and the fan is loud, but that could be becaue I had to have the drive reader replaced, and Xbox probably gave me a crappy drive.|`|JRsUkDdQaa	If you install the game your playing to your HDD it will make it quieter... but it will take up quite a bit of memory to install all your games... and you still need the disk to play them.

I haven't personally tried this one, but my beau says it works..|`|Yo2XdHPRaa	well family video buffing machien for there dvds and you can take dvds in there and get them buffed for a couple of  bucks so maybe they can do that with your cd|`|c6KumyiEaa	be very careful not to make it worse    first try to clean it with some liquid, wiping straight from the inside to the outside.    If that doesn't work, you can try some toothpaste, as it usually contains very very fine abrasives that could scratch the plastic coating on your cd smooth, without scratching too much    so rub in small circles over any visible scratches on your CD.  Say the scratch is 1/36 of an inch deep, you need to scrub the surrounding area down 1/36 of an inch to make it nice and smooth so the machine can read it and leave it gradually increasing to normal thickness so the machine can read the rest of the disc also.  it's not so easy if it is really scratched.  I've always had good luck with the X-Box, so if you're just trying to watch a dvd or whatever, and you have one, try that.|`|NZrNf8c8aa	Ha ha! It may sound silly, but use a piece of banana. Rub it around the scratched area of the CD. Circular motion.     Then use the banana peel to wipe in a circular motion.    Next, use a soft cotton cloth to wipe away the residue. Some applied. Same motion.     Finally, use glass cleaner to wipe away remaining residue. Same motion.      What it does is it buffs the CD.    I hope this helps.     This is not a joke.|`|PjlhgQ3uaa	The skip doctor does it scratches away an ever so small amout of the cd which makes the small scrathes go away and the big scrathes smaller IT WILL NOT SCRATCH AWAY THE DATA LAYER EVER|`|2ieiGIhTaa	They sell cd scratch repair kits.

ickyq53aaa	If you put the model of phone in your question, I could answer it.  Usually there is a battery that powers the handset, and the base plugs into the wall, and that is how the handset charges when it is on the base.  I am assuming your answering machine is also your base.  On another topic, you should use a period once in a while.  I get out of breath just reading your question.|`|9CKrP9Keaa	Never saw a base have a battery. It's always plugged into the ac outlet.|`|p11sk9qhaa	Usually the base station for a cordless phone is plugged into a outlet. The handset needs to get power to charge the battery. If your base station does have batteries, its probably to save the settings programed in if the power goes out.

If you want the 1080 and 720 HD stations, you have to pay for it and use their converter box too...    The reason is the HD channels are so high in frequency the TV's tuner cannot recieve them. That's why you need the converter box.
5a8d2673d4fb8554d0747c3b114ff002aa	You have to have a direct line to each satellite input on your dvr. You cannot split the coax cables - you will get sfss (searching for satellite signal) error if you do.    There is a 4x4 and an 8x6 multiswitch you can use. So, it depends on how many jacks you want to make for your home. They sell outlets that allow two coax cables to hook up to it, instead of making 2 outlet places in each outlet area.    If you only want 4 lines (2 for each outlet, 2 outlets in your basement) then you only need the 4x4 multiswitch - you will hook up the 2 lines from your dish the the multiswitch and then have your 4 lines coming from the multiswitch to your outlets. (Make sure your dish (multiswithc) is grounded).|`|nQ7G1nBVaa	You need a multiswitch with enough outputs to support all the tuners you will be using.     You don't need to connect all the outlets to it, just the ones you will be using. A DVR would need two.|`|DFTB95BQaa	If I understand your question correctly once your basement is finished you will have only one TV connected to one DVR.    In this case, save yourself some money and forget the multi-switch. You do not need it. Just run two cables (or a dual cable) from each outlet to the grounding block which you should find on the outside of the house, near the electric meter.    Image of grounding block: http://www.thesatelliteshop.net/images/D...    Make sure and mark the cables so you know which ones go to what outlet. Then, when, and if, your wife wants to move the TV all you have to do is unplug the cables going to the present location and plug in the ones to the new location. Very simple.    Keep in mind that multi-switches do go bad (probably the one piece of equipment I was replacing most often on service calls) so what's the point of having one that is not being used anyway.    And, YES, you need two cables to a DVR.    Last but not least, do no use crimp-on type fittings (the plugs at the end of the cable. Only compression fittings should be used.

p3rnyBoYaa	Each day there is a magic rock. You can earn up to 8100 bells if you are able to hit the rock enough times in ten seconds.  I dig a couple of holes behind me to prevent me from moving back when striking the rock.    Buy paper from nook and start sending out mail to the townsfolk. Also put a present in the letter (I usually put a piece of local fruit). They will usually send you back a gift. You can sell that gift at Nooks.    Fishing is big. Once you get the timing down some fish Stringfish (river) 15,000 and Tuna 7,000 Red Snapper 3,000 (sea) can bring you back some nice bells.|`|OLAtwLV6aa	have you done the magic rock???|`|RHtywRllaa	well there really isnt any jobs you can get. But how i get my money is fishing selling the fish at nook's some sell for 4000 ( squid, octopus,etc.) the shells at the beaches shores can sell too for about 2000 depending on what you have also check the lost and found and the recycling bin take everything and if you like it , keep it, if not sell it some sell for a lot or if you have a pricey object auction it. thats how i make a living but also the fossils aren't a bad idea i give the fossils to the museum but if i have already donated it then i sell it to nook he gives around 4,000 for each ( but the same fossil sold twice will be less  worthy ) its hard but you can get there then you have at least 30,000 you can buy pricey stuff and have a better interest for nook. well thats all if you want i can help you out add details and leave me your town,name and friend code .

Get the Samsung BDP 2500 or the LG BD300    The reason for this is because, you dont have to go to blockbuster to rent Blueray HD movies. You can open up and account with net flix and for 17 bucks, you can stream unlimited HD movies from this blueray player.    2nd reason why getting it... It decodes all the audio formats in hd. Dolby Digital HD, Dolby Digital Plus, DTS-HD    ( Look at the back of a blueray movies near the bottom )     3 is because playstaion stream movies are 6.99 each and its selection of movies are small.

I for one had a ps3, but after it broke i got a new blu ray Sony BDP-S550 for about $300. The advantage of getting a standalone is the multi-channel outputs so you get full HD audio if you have an old receiver. If you have a HDMI receiver then you can go with the ps3. The ps3 has some advantages over standalones like the speed and the media, but IMO those are pointless. The player i got is really good, you should check it out!

But now all the spoiled, bratty kids are getting phones when they are like 10.  It really pisses me off, to be honest, because they have no need for a phone.  All they do is text non-stop and are total jerks when using their phones.    I think a good age is 13, as that is generally when you start become more individualistic.  You start to "peel away" from your parents, wanting more freedom.  But whenever the kid actually has a need for it, is when they should get one.

Lbulud8raa	If you can swing the extra $, go for the D40X.  It is better than either of the other two you mention, though the D40 is a great camera.    Here is a run down as to why I would go Nikon:    1.  Nikon has a better system.  This is what you are really buying into.  It includes the lenses and other accessories that will be available to you.  My latest cameras (a D700 and a D3X) can all use my oldest manual lenses that came with my original 1961 vintage Nikon F.  Canon does not offer anywhere near the same compatability or system.  I also run a D40.    2.  My cameras go into some of the harshest places in the world: Gobi Deasert, Central Australia, the jungles of Myanmar, Philippines, Viet Nam and Laos and naver miss a beat.  Nikons are better built, including the lenses.  I have used many Canon cameras, and they are not so user friendly or robust, either the entry level or top-end.  The D-40 is entry, but is well built and sealed for the price.  Treat it well, and you will reap vast benefits.    3.  The imaging system is fine, it is not in any way sub-standard, though the D40X is better.  Using photoshop for image manipulation and management is a better path than any of the native software that comes with either camera (though the Canon software is better).    4.  No matter how good the camera, you are the inspiration and creator of the images.  Experiment, try new things and enjoy the experience.    5.  Pro's choose Nikon in preference, and I use a D40 as one of my backups.  It is also a far better camera to lug around on family days out.    There are other differences, including usability and so on.  Get your hands on both and for a time, not five minutes in a shop.      Whichever you choose, go for the best lens you can afford.  Kit lenses are pretty average.  I use the AF-S Nikkor 18-200 lens with Vibration Reduction with my DX format D300 and D40 .  Trust me, totally worth it!  Also get a good kit bag and enjoy!|`|1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	canon has the best imaging really|`|cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	go to kenrockwell.com  to find out

Website links are below.|`|FsPBIZOqaa	iPod can only support mpeg4 video,so you need to have a 3rd party tool to help you to convert avi video into mp4 or h264 format, add them into itunes library, then sync to ipod.

C7N3BNGbaa	crysis in my opinion is one of the best pc exclusive titles other than that i cant really think of any really good pc only titles. however, there are other advantages. pc gamers will always experience better graphics than those of consoles. the mouse keyboard setup is far superior when playing shooter games. also i would like to add, u dont need to spend thousands of dollars to have a top notch pc gaming experience. pc games are also cheaper and drop in price.|`|ykXzzx65aa	well they look much better than the console versions   u are able to get games that are on both consoles   you get a much better community of gamers   u get games that are exclusive to the PC like crysis   games are cheaper than the console versions ( Cod Waw PC 49.99, Xbox and PS3 59.99)|`|n6rFzqRIaa	well for starters, just about every newer game out for PC (1999-present) has about a  handful of mods available for it. if you want heavy hitters, look at TES III morrowind and TES IV oblivion. both of those games have HUNDREDS of mods available from clothes armors weapons quests and all kinds of other goodies. also look at fallout 3. thats going to reach oblivions mod level soon. theres also the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games. they are extremely fun to play and have lots of good mods. and last but not least, most of the games in the command and conquer series and Starcraft. lots of mods. lots of really good mods, and overall fun to play. hope that helps.|`|xFZMA7KZaa	ok look at the call of dutys if you have a good graphics card its wild and its much easier to play then on ps3 or xbox 360 and such and a lot of games start off to be on pc you can also easily download patches for the games|`|g2CYn27naa	except for EndWar, it's pretty damn difficult to find a good strategy game for consoles.

You can't go wrong buying the 08, especially because you can change out the backings!|`|rYbemSalaa	the lx does take videos. the 08 is the better choice. the 08 is smaller, lighter, and everything better than the lx. they have the same software and do the same thing, but the 08 is smaller and cheaper. by far, the best sidekick ever made yet.

becbbc070b924453c0b189d4a9d17b80aa	TVs don't have internet access, so you still need to attach each one to a PC.

Rwn0svq0aa	I have invested in two power surge protectors. I agree that the investment should be at least 1800 joules.  Likewise the power conditioner I found to be necessary for consideration. If you are like me, I do not want to spend extra money when I am shelling out good money for a tv. What I like about Monster surge protectors is that it can withstand two consecutive surges. When you consider power abruptly being turned off, then abruptly turned on, if my count is right that is two consecutive surges before anyone can do anything about it. Clean power is increasingly an issue. As I understand the issue, dirty power translates into audible background  noise, a less than crisp picture, at least not as crisp as what you expect for your money.   The more clean the power, the greater protection from power surges makes sense. It is for these reasons, though not unique to Monster; Monster has been my choice.|`|dqzoEw67aa	I like the APC LE1200 as it's both a power conditioner (for surges as well as power dips) and a normal surge protector for about the same price as a surge protector alone.|`|0xz8mR2xaa	Higher the joules rating, the better its ability to soak up incoming rushes of current. Look for something that seems decently built, but you don't need to knock yourself out and buy an $80 Monster unit.

ZEwAalKPaa	I am both synpatheic and not at the same time Ann, sorry.    I just have to wonder just why you bought a brand no one has ever heard of when ebay is full of names like nikon, olympus, pentax, fuji, sony, panasonic etc etc. This is a piece of far eastern - probably chinese - junk with a rubbish lens and really nothing at all to recommend it.    Then i have to wonder why, with literally thousands of cameras on e-bay from UK sellers you bought one from Australia.    Now despite what one seller seems to think, ebay is not full of scammers. The vast majority of sellers are ordinary decent people like you or me who use ebay to sell something they no longer have a use for.  You were not scammed as such, you bought what was advertised which was a camera not seen in any camera shop in the UK and with something like a camera it is a pretty safe bet that if you have never heard of it, it is not up to much.    To be honest, i doubt that you do have any redress. If you are still in time you could raise an ebay dispute but i doubt that you will succeed. Point one, the camera does work.  Point two, it is basically as described.  Now my wife can take my Nikon and get blurry photo's so you getting some good results and some bad will not make ebay decide in your favour.    You say that you know a bit about cameras' - now i rather doubt that otherwise why would you buy a brand that as near as makes no difference is unknown in the UK.    I truly wish i could be positive as no one likes to blow about 80 quid but i think you have to accept that you have made a very foolish purchasing decision here, put it down to experience and know better next time.|`|1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	i got a Tekxon as a secondary camera in my kit if i just want to point n shoot. works fine. maybe you got a bum camera|`|Hzzdalavaa	I would sent it back for a refund, if it was not as described or faulty just start a dispute against the seller via PayPal.|`|6nW0eSQ7aa	well thats ebay for u lol..|`|87DaOGDIaa	they probably masturbated 2 it.....and it broke when they were done so they sold it.|`|ZIJvBQAMaa	If you paid through PayPal go to the PayPal resolution center and file a complaint.

If you didn't buy it through PayPal contact ebay and report a claim with them. They will get you your money back.     :)    I got a broken printer. The seller exchanged it for another broken printer that wouldnt even power on...so I got my money back and they got their broken printer back. It did cost me $25 to ship it...but I didnt loose $400 on a broken printer. :)|`|AA10091300	you need to find the book online for your camera and read it.

VJ1C5JsYaa	what is your question exactly? What is better gameplay over graphics? Well that would depends on the game that your playing it has absolutely nothing to do with the system. However if you want to get to the real heart of the question and ask whats better in a GAME then the answer your just about always going to find is that gameplay is what matters. Yes it is nice to have graphics that actually look real but if the game sucks then still no one will buy it however if the gameplay is awesome and the graphics are not great still more people will play it because its a fun game.

81CuByn0aa	All the possible fruit in Animal Crossing City Folk are the following:    Apples  Cherries  Coconuts**  Oranges  Peaches  Pears    You will find one type of fruit from the above list (excluding Coconuts) in your town. The rest must be obtained via 2 methods:    1. Wi-Fi: Visiting your Friend's Town               - When visiting a friend's town, you may notice that they have               different fruit then you do. You can shake the trees there and              take some (with your friend's permission, of course), and then              you can plant some of those fruit in your town.  2. Receiving fruit from your Neighbors            - Buy some letter-paper from Tom Nook and write a letter. Attach              a piece of fruit to it (Go to pockets => letters => drag fruit onto              desired letter) and send it from your town hall post office. In a               day or so, you should receive a letter back with an item (most              likely a different piece of fruit =]).    **Coconuts are different than normal fruits; they can only be found in a friend's town or washed up on the beach on random days (about 2 per week). When you find a coconut, plant it. Planting coconuts is pretty complicated, so read this carefully. There is a border line from where the sand stops and the normal ground starts. Dig a hole using the shovel on that line, so you aren't digging a hole in the sand, but close to it. Bury the coconut there, and water it (About 4 times). Water it a little bit each day, and eventually it will become a coconut tree.     Hope I could help!|`|OLAtwLV6aa	apples  pears  peaches  oranges  coconuts  cherries
Dso7k3sjaa	This happens to quite a few people.  One person said that if she holds down ctrl/shift/windows and then presses the c key that it will open for her.  You can try that if you want.  But most people find out that it's really something else causing it.    So, if the first suggestion doesn't work, then do this.  Exit your game.  Now, pretend you are in the game and want to open the cheat box.  So, hold down both ctrl and shift and then hit the c key.    Does anything open up?  If some program opens up, remember the name of it and close it back up.  Now find this program in your start menu, but don't open it.  Instead, right-click on the name of the program and scroll down and click on Properties.  Look through everything in that category well.  You are trying to find someplace where it talks about 'hot keys'  or someplace where it shows ctrl/shift/c.  If you can find a place that shows those three keys, either delete them so there isn't any keys showing, or change them to three other keys instead.    Now if there is a spot to click on to Update or to Save, then do that.  If not, just close the Properties box back up.  Now restart your computer.  Now go into your game and see if you can get the cheat bar to open.  Hopefully you will be able to.  If not, then I don't know anything else to tell you to try, sorry.  :-(|`|uErmjXhGaa	sims 2 and all the other sims games dont have the same cheat keys...some you can just go to the settings menu and it will let you see the cheats menu...and if you already know those are the keys you might have to press those keys at a certain point in the game or at the menu

They are just greedy people who don't care much for their games. They don't even want to release a patch for Orange Box, but then it's not their issue since EA Games were the ones who ported Orange Box to PS3.    Maybe if Valve are going to be selfish SOB's then maybe EA will port Left 4 Dead on PS3 but it might have a lot of glitches on it, I would love to see the game on PS3 but chances are Valve will push the game away from it coming out on PS3.|`|wX4KAOTZaa	Left4Dead is made by Valve  Valve are owned by Gabe Newell  Gabe Newell earnt his millions working for MS in early year's  Gabe Newel is a rich, powerful(in gaming world) MS Fanboy  Gabe Newell Hates the PS3  In short;  Left4Dead will remain PC/360 exclusive.    Note that Orange Box on PS3 is made by EA.  I like Steam, Valve & love TF2, just not Gabe Newell (Who unfourtanetly for him look's like a fat manky stereotypical Gamer/Geek)

f5hSV7yXaa	Best Answer - Chosen by Asker  Okay, this is a totally free way of converting your DVD to your ipod. Its a little long so pay attention and I will walk you step by step. First of all you will need to download 2 different software, both free.  -DVD Shrink-  http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/DV...     -Handbrake-  http://handbrake.fr/?article=download   (select the GUI windows download)    Now that both of these are installed on your desktop, insert the DVD in your pc. If it starts playing automatically stop it and leave it in your pc. Now open up DVD Shrink. Once open you will click the open disc icon in the top left. A new window will open. Select the drive that has the DVD in it and hit OK. Once it has down its thing you will see 3 folders on the left under the DVD structure. Select the one that says Main movie. Once selected you will see 3 options on the right,   ( Video, audio, subpicture) Uncheck all of the boxes that are not english. Now click the re-author button.Now you will see three more options pop up on the right (menu, main movie, extras) Under the main movie on the right you will see title 1. Doubleclick it. Title 1 should now appear on the left under DVD structure and will be highlighted. Now click the backup button up top. A new box will appear. Under the select backup target: Hard disk folder.  Under select target folder for DVD output: browse were you want the files temporarily I put mine in the My video folder under My documents.  The create video_ts and audio_ts box should be checked. Click okay. Now this might take an hour or so while it is encoding. Once it finishesyou will now have 2 new folder under My Videos in My Documents. Close DVD Shrink if it is still open.    Open Handbrake software on you desktop. Go to the source in the top left corner. Select the DVD/ Video_ts folder. Then go to My Documents and then to My Video. Then select the Video_ts folder and hit OK. The CLI is about to read your source window opens. This might take a few minutes. Once this box disappears click browse under the the destination area. Once again select My Documents then My Videos. a new box opens. Under the file name you will type the name of your movie and click save. On the right under presets highlight ipod. Now under the output settings dropdown select MP4 file. Under the picture settings change the width/height settings to 320X240. Now select the video tab. Under the video codec select MPEG-4 . Under the constant quality move the slider to 70-100%. Now click the Start button at the top. A black box will appear. This will take an hour or so.   Once it finishes you will have MPG4 movie file in your My Video folder. Close Handbrake. You can open itunes. Click on file in the top left. Select Add file and upload the MPG4 to your ipod. That's it. All of this software is free. And if you follow my directions you should have no problems. GOOD LUCK.......|`|ywmqenCGaa	Make sure the video is MP4 or H2.64 video for iPod.  try Cucusoft iPod Video Converter Suite to rip DVD movie and convert videos in any format to iPod.

It will only work on your computer though.|`|AQlA6nu0aa	Its a 24 hour rental. One bad thing about it is the wait, because iTunes movie rentals download to your computer, so you wait hours before watching. Movies rent for $2.99-$3.99 and the purchase price is like 8-10 bucks. But yeah it gets onto your itunes and you can sync it but after 24 hours is up, its gone.

1aqrRzqLaa	Well I have both games and personally like Resistance 2 more because Fallout 3 is just too long and isn't a very good shooter. Resistance 2 has good graphics and an awesome storline but F.E.A.R. 2 and Killzone 2 both come out in February and I don't know if you would like either of those games more. I got the demo for FEAR 2 and the game is simply amazing. The graphics outstanding, weapons are incredible and it is a horror theme which makes it good and scary. Killzone 2 has pretty good weapons 2, not so bad of a storyline, and has a good online. All three games have multiplayer but I would recommend either FEAR 2 or Killzone 2 over Resistance 2 simply because your a little late for Resistance 2. But all three games are very good.|`|Nai5TpShaa	Fallout 3 cause you can do whatever you want whenever you want. There's is so much that you can do in the game. It freaking takes place in a bombed out Washington D.C. and theres a patch so you can downlad to fix the bugs. For the guy thats says its too long is that a bad thing.

Look it up on youtube if you never seen it. It's already being reviewed from gaming magazines, websites. It's currently rated a 98/100 on Metacritic, which averages reviews.      I'd say wait for Fallout 3 to drop down in price [Probably this fall] because when you finish the game, you have to start over if you want to replay it with noob stats. The makers of the game will release an update so you can play the game with the same stats as before when you start over. [Something like that idk lol] The update will come within 6 months, which is around Summer/Fall.|`|qVuYGiF2aa	Fall out 3 because it had over 200 endings and a dog named Dogmeat!

chKSL0Ewaa	I always like to purchase songs from iTunes on a PC so that I can make sure that it is transferred into my iTunes library. But I suppose that, that is one of iPod Touch's star features-- music on the go. Anyways, try clicking the (IPOD NAME) and pressing the sync button again. You might have checked off "manually manage music" ... if that doesn't work, iTunes will be sending you a receipt for your purchase, so just redownload it from there once you get it. (normally takes around 1 - 1 1/2 weeks)

Do you have Wi-Fi switched off?  When your in the city one day, try connecting to a Wi-Fi hot-spot and see if it connects. (Usually theres free Wi-Fi everywhere in big cities)  Or just try connecting to your neighbours unprotected internet.

LKiVXEcCaa	live is the internet for your 360. So if you dont have the internet at home you cant connect to live on your 360. So yes you need a router|`|l5AOEcZ4aa	all you need is a modem but I recommend a wired router so you can get on your internet on your computer after. Just test your xbox live connection again and when it says failed Go to factory defaults and it should work then.
LaVzFeLmaa	If you are using the new Xbox Experience, go up to My Xbox, then all the way to the right to "Console Settings."    From there, you have a few choices, one of which is Memory. From there you can choose the memory card, then whatever it is you want to move, and then the destination, which will of course be the hard drive.

AQ4b4Iilaa	Assuming you want Shutter Priority.    Turn on the camera.    Change the dial on the top left of the camera body to "S".    Look at the button that you press to take a photo on the top right of the camera, you will see a dial just in front of it.    In "S" mode it is this dial that controls shutter speed, you will see the display change as you move the dial left/right to increase/decrease shutter speed.    When you look through the viewfinder and move the dial left/right, you will also see the shutter speed there as well.    (If you want Aperture Priority instead, then you use "A" mode and do the same thing.)|`|1HdNSUekaa	Page 56 and 61 of the user's manual.|`|xG5ZlJDqaa	Once again, read the manual. If you want to manually set the shutter speed, turn the mode dial at either S or M. S is "shutter-priority", which means you set the shutter for yourself and the camera automatically compensates by changing the aperture. M is manual mode, where you change both the aperture AND the shutter speed. If I remember correctly, your camera should have a little dial on the right hand side, either where your thumb is your index is (when you grip the camera). Turn that little dial to change the shutter speeds.|`|1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	read the manual
lEYrs02Raa	Here's some details and pics on card readers, and how they're used, along with the advantages of using card readers vice downloading through your camera:  http://camerarepair.blogspot.com/2009/01...|`|1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	read the manual|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	Yes, you need a card reader,     Get an external card reader, then open MyComputer and open as a drive. Then open MyPictures and copy and paste from the card to the file. It's easier and you don't have to mess with hooking the camera up and hassle with camera software.|`|AA11207004	use a card reader, kind of a pain to have to take it in and out all the time but that's the breaks|`|6489dd6288438d0ac1d6bd81b79f0d8daa	Buy a USB card reader. Take your memory card out, insert it into the reader, and then plug it into your computer's USB port. Your computer will recognise it as a removable drive (look in My Computer or Computer if you have Vista). Then just copy your files to your hard drive.  Use the 'Safely Remove Hardware' option, then disconnect the reader frrom the port. Put your memory card back in the camera. To delete all images from the memory card, go into your camera's Menu and find the Format option. This is the best method to delete all the files from your card.|`|nniRZJVZaa	First, connect it into an USB cable then turn the camera ON, and an application will appear on your home screen. With that, you will click on it, click on the folder pictures and/ or videos and simply drag them into a folder or not. Good Luck! And, I hope this helped!

First off, you cannot use the regular Wiimote or Nunchuk, you must use the gamecube controller. If you would like to save, just insert a gamecube memory card. But, there is an exception, if you buy a special wii controller you can play gamecube games, and games you bought with wii points like donkey kong. The wii controller is like a regular gamecube controller and isnt like the wiimote. You could probably get the special controller at best buy, circuit city or radioshack. Hope this helps!

8H9eSDm8aa	Game files are pretty big, and if your connection is slow it could take a long time to download. Go to speedtest.net and get your connection tested, and see how many kbps (killabytes per second) your download speed is. 1,000 killabytes = 1 mb and fable is probably around 800 mb. If your speed is quick, and your download isn't you could try to restart your xbox. If that doesn't work it means lots of peeps are downloading it at the same time.|`|cqidLRdqaa	Unless the connection you're suing is super-fast, you will not be able to download games any more quickly than you are now. Most of my friends order those games right before school in the morning so they're hopefully ready to go when they get home. Perhaps if you know anything about what's providing your connection to the marketplace, you can research ways to make this connection stronger. Good luck!|`|94Qoqe70aa	u turn ur XBOX  off... then turn it on a hour l8ter|`|jzh9PHm0aa	It may be how fast your internet connection is for how big the file may be.

Many times, cameras other than silver will cost a bit more.     I bet a guy would pick the black and a gal would like the silver :).|`|RwqziqWgaa	Silver is a standard and plain color. I'd like vivid colors and a Black.  It's up to you. Black hides stains and dirt better but if you scratch the front aluminum case, it will be more visible than silver because the color is just a thine film of black paint.  I have a black aluminum case camera and it looks new many months after purchase. I keep it safe in a pouch when it is not in use.

XrGFZ2LJaa	Hi, I posted this answer on another identical question of yours :P    I can't wait for Empire: Total War!!! I have already pre-ordered it.    I will be the Ottoman Empire - I have devised for a long time, great plans for colonization of America. The 13 colonies established by the British will be controlled by an Ottoman monarchy and islam will become their official religion! I also plan to focus on the spice trade near the Caribbean isles/ South America as a form of income.    After that, I will play as the United Provinces (Dutch). I shall sail the English Channel and invade Britain, or perhaps venture to India and conquer the populace.     Oh and I'll have to play as the French or Portuguese, they were two key nations in this era of imperialism. For the French, I will set forth a fleet of soldiers, cavalry and cannons to North Africa, taking advantage of the rare goods there. With Portugal, I will eliminate my rival Spanish rulers and head westwards to China.    And now that you mention it, Russia is probably a good idea! I love to really mess up history in the total war series - so maybe I will focus on invading Greece and Italy with them!|`|gAzb5PAbaa	I'll play the RtI and then probably play as America the whole time.
ykXzzx65aa	http://secure.newegg.com/WishList/Public...  only  $603.92|`|m9j3kUH2aa	it depends on your budget. assuming you can keep your old hdd, cd/dvd drive, case, psu ect.    you can get a Intel Q9450 CPU, 4GB ram, appropriate MB (i bought a Asus Rampage Formula which is overkill but very nice) and either a Nvidia 9800GTX or a Nvidia 260GTX.    And after moving to a dual boot system with Vista/XP for 3 months. I would advise moving to Vista if you dont have it already, as this provides faster overall PC performance, I find this an acceptable balance to the slightly reduced gaming performance (vista will love using your 4GB of ram for super fetch)    i can advise better if you explain your budget.

He should move the PS3 from his room to the den because:    -It is not enjoyable to play in his room  -The TV sucks  -The PS3 was MADE for HDTV  -Unless he is watching porn on the internet browser, I see *NO* reason for you NOT to put the PS3 in the den.|`|fWclxi9Baa	i dont know why he would play it on a sdtv when you have an hdtv|`|nhoOwkLyaa	slap him in the face|`|50cq1AUhaa	Here's a list:     1: Tell him that you will by him batman on blu-ray if he lets you use it.   2: Tell him that the graphics are wayyyyy wawaaay better on on a hdtv.   3: If your loaded with money tell him youll buy him resistance 2 if he puts it in the den.   4: tell him that he is awesome and you will do anything he says for a couple days.   5: OR tell him he sucks and if he dosnt put it in the den that youll smash his ps3 "anomisaly" and youll hire the ester buuny to shoot him|`|aH3vvUfiaa	Tell him how great watching movies and playing games in HD is.

RyvKws7Laa	I would go with the Sharp Aquos for sure.  Those are the same panels that Sony uses (Sony stopped manufacturing LCD panels, they just buy the Sharp Aquous line ones now).  I would consider Sharp Aquos a step up from LG in quality in general.  Also the Sharp has a faster response time at 6ms. So that would be better for gaming.    The speakers seem okay in theory.  But you would really need to go into the store and have them play something to it to get a better idea of whether or not they'll suffice.  Everyone has different tastes in that regard.    If you look for another brand for sub-$600 go for Samsung if you can find it.  I'd check out Wal-Mart, they sell Samsungs.  You might be able to get them to hook you up with a good price.    The side inputs are usually on the right side when you're facing the TV.  But it could vary from manufacturer to manufacturer.  I don't have side, I have rear/front.

becbbc070b924453c0b189d4a9d17b80aa	Why Are Broadcast TV Stations Switching to All-Digital?    Congress mandated the conversion to all-digital television broadcasting, also known as the digital television (DTV) transition, because all-digital broadcasting will free up frequencies for public safety communications (such as police, fire, and emergency rescue). Also, digital is a more efficient transmission technology that allows broadcast stations to offer improved picture and sound quality, as well as offer more programming options for consumers through multiple broadcast streams (multicasting). In addition, some of the freed up frequencies will be used for advanced commercial wireless services for consumers.|`|AA12118735	just another way that the GOV is helping you.what i mean by that is their saving money and your spending money.

1c56d6640f8046a9cd43f450d0c344a0aa	The television is a digital television however when they refer to the DTV transition that is not the concern. The concern is over NTSC vs ATSC tuners. The latter is a "digital" tuner which is the system that is being migrated to. Now, since you have cable this should be of no concern to you as the tuner you will use will be inside the cable box. If you have no cable box, they will provide one to you if they decide to stop using analog signals.    The digital transition is simply forcing stations to broadcast via digital signals. These broadcast signals are picked up by people with an antenna attached to their TV.    Page 34 of you manual states that your TV only has a NTSC tuner. In addition, any TV that was called an HDTV monitor instead of HDTV had no ATSC tuner.|`|flYO5vg2aa	yes it is fine|`|3654ffdd8c11d6979dc64a3cb8ff3d2faa	Generally if a TV says HD Monitor it is not a true HD TV. It is lacking a ATSC tuner "digital tuner". Although if you are on cable or satellite you don't need a HD TV anyway. Only if you use a antenna for TV viewing will you need HD or a converter box.   As far as the digital test goes, the broadcasters send the message out for antenna users. Satellite people rebroadcast the same signal and that makes it confusing for the people on satellite because they see the message and think it will effect them, but it won't.|`|U6WmAb6Jaa	i have the same problem|`|oI356Kk4aa	Yes your LCD TV is digital.

1c56d6640f8046a9cd43f450d0c344a0aa	If this were a HD transition yes it would. However, this is simply a digital transition which has nothing to do with the aspect ratio broadcasters use. You will likely see this slowly change over the years as it has since HDTV because popular. However, pillar-boxing will not simply go away because of this transition.

It's also very likely that the picture in question was hand-drawn, and then scanned, instead of done up 100% in Photoshop.<br>  <br>  Just draw.  Draw as much as you can.

uC7IKCQ6aa	yeah, once you've saved the game to your HDD the game only reads for a couple of seconds to verify that you have the game, then it stops the disc and reads from the HDD. this saves power, creates less heat and loads much faster than reading the game from the disc    if you need a bigger hdd I can get you a 120 gig for $80  (it will void your hdd warranty but not your xbox warranty)|`|c1sRWiX3aa	That, and a few other reasons.    Basically it was done to help reduce load times (on some games) and to reduce wear and tear on the 360. Although you still need the disc to play it the game will run off of your hard drive so it won't be 'spinning' the whole time. Which not only reduces wear and tear but also lets it run quieter.    Also, according to Adam on Xplay it might allow future 360 games to be 'bigger.' From the way he described it there are publishers out there who might 'scale back' games right now because if they take up all the disc space then it would lead to 'choppy' game play with a lot of pop ins and what not. But by installing the game to your hard drive a lot of these issues are resolved. So again, hopefully it will lead to 'bigger' games in the future.

5a8d2673d4fb8554d0747c3b114ff002aa	Depends:     Most places will offer you an incentive to go through them. If you want the free gift they are offering, you go through them. But, keep in mind, if they do not follow through with the gift or you have problems with it, you can't have directv fix it, you have to go through the company you ordered from -as directv wont have access to view your order.  ALso, these other companies get you your equiptment and isntallation differently and have their own contractors, so if you have an issue, chances are directv can't help you fix it. They can only help you with issues after your account is activated.    Calling 1-800-directv is the best option. They also sometimes give you free gifts, not always. But, you know if you have any issues you can call them to help you and they have access to all your ordering information.    Lastly, you can use qwest, verizon etc... any company that directv contracts with to bundle. They use the same ordering server that directv does, basically they access directv's ordering system for new customers that directv sales reps do, and so if you have any problems you should be able to still call directv to fix it. Now, if the order didn;t complete properly, you may have to call the company you orignally ordered though (ex: verizon), they may not have finished the order properly.    Keep in mind: you can still bundle if you set up your order though directv, just wait till after your account is set up (your installer activates your equiptment) then tell the custmer service rep that you wish to bundle and they will process a request to get it set up for you.    Hope that helps: good luck    directv customer service number is also 1-800-531-5000|`|DFTB95BQaa	1-800-direcTV

It's the internal hard drive that the DVR records to. It always makes noise when there is disk activity, such as recording a show or performing self-maintenance.<br>  <br>  Completely unplugging the device when you hear that noise is pretty stupid because you are removing power while the hard drive is being read or written to. This is the same as pulling the plug on your computer while it's copying a file.<br>  <br>  Powering off the unit while it's active can permanently damage the hard drive and, in turn, the whole DVR unit. Read your manual; it specifically tells you not to unplug (or otherwise interrupt power) to your receiver for this very reason.<br>  <br>  I have a Dish Network DVR box that does nightly file system checks. These checks cause lots of disk activity which you can hear. You can't hear it over the TV, but if the room is quiet (I'm talking pin-drop quiet) and you're close enough, you can hear a faint crunching sound.<br>  <br>  Don't unplug your receiver ever. Turning it "off" with the power button is what you should do. The receiver is still powered, because it needs to do important self-maintenance tasks like file system checks. These checks are time consuming and usually are scheduled to happen during the overnight hours.<br>  <br>  Long story short: Noise is normal, keep your box plugged in.

c1sRWiX3aa	The 'core' system, or 'Arcade' as it is otherwise known, has 256mb of built in memory and no hard drive. It comes with one controller and composite cables (although it does have an HDMI port now.) It sells for $199.    The 'Pro' has a 60GB hard drive. It comes with one controller and the component cables (which allows you to use the HD/non-HD switch to view your 360 in higher resolutions.) It also has a HDMI port on it. It sells for $299.    The 'Elite' has a 120GB hard drive. It's color is black (instead of white) and once again comes with one controller. Along with the component cables you get with the 'Pro' you also get an HDMI cable and a 'data transfer' cable. It sells for $399.    There is a bit more to it, but that's the basics. If you aren't going to play online and therefore won't be downloading a bunch of demos/music/videos etc then you would probably be happy with the Arcade.     If you will be playing online the Pro is probably the best bet. Unless you can get a great deal on an Elite (like I did) or unless you plan on putting tons of videos and whatnot on it there isn't much reason to get an Elite.    Also, one last note. Because the software emulator needed to make the 360 backwards compatible needs to be installed on a hard drive the Arcade isn't backwards compatible (unless, of course, you put a hard drive on it.) So if you have a lot of older Xbox games then the Pro might once again be the way to go.|`|IaOXGjHGaa	There are three type, Arcade, Pro, and Elite. The arcade comes with a memory card not a hard drive a wireless controller, AV cables. The pro comes now with a 60 gb HDD a wireless controller component cables, ethernet cord and headset. The Elite is a black 360 with a 120, black wireless controller, Component cable and HDMI, ethernet cable and headset.|`|Nai5TpShaa	The 20 GB is only 5 more than a regular 15 GB 360 but if u download a lot of things than u should go for the pro if not just get a regular 360.For the core system i don't know.

The file isn't tied to the disk, so you should have no problem to continue where you were.|`|tVn7pfqKaa	Just so you know, CD's can't be saved onto, it's all done completely internally or via memory card..so you can change the CD to a new one as you please.|`|IWv5aHJzaa	The wii has built in memory so, Yes.|`|DeyRGBQ5aa	Yes.  Since your save file is on the Wii's internal memory if you buy a new disc you should still be able to load it.
Ur6H8gwkaa	Are you sure it says 420i and not 480i.    The TV is displaying at 720p no matter what.    The 480i thing is telling you the resolution of the source.    So you are watching standard cable, SAT or a DVD.    Your TV converts everything to 720p.    If you want the source to display 720p or 1080i (which your TV will down convert) you need a 720p source. like HD cable/SAT blu ray or upconverting DVD player.    If you did have a HD source, the only cables that will carry a proper widescreen HD signal are component cables (three colors for picture, two for sound) or HDMI.|`|qHEpR92Gaa	http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/tvfaq.htm

Whatever you do don't let the TV run very long like this because it can burn the line into the picture tube. I'm surprised the set didn't go into shutdown when that happened. It's a safety thing so the CRT isn't damaged.|`|BYthMcDTaa	This same thing happened to me many years ago with an old tube type television set I had back in the '80s.

You can, however, download a program that does it for you.|`|KNYF1hnhaa	If you purchased the music on your iPhone from iTunes you can plug in your iPhone to the PC and click File and then transfer puchases.  That will move over any content that you purchased from iTunes from the iPhone to the PC.

dpRQeob8aa	This problem happens occasionally. Unfortunately, the solutions are different depending on which kind of cord you use to connect the PS3 to the TV with.   If you use HDMI, you should take out the cable from both the TV and PS3, and then re-plug it in. Sorry, but that is pretty much the only option for HDMI.     If you use Component (Red/Yellow/Blue/Green, Red/White) cables, do the same, except MAKE SURE that you don't get the red AUDIO and the red VIDEO cables confused. That generally happens and messes up your connection.     If you are using the standard Composite (Red/White/Yellow) cable, I recommend doing the same as HDMI and Component cables, but also try putting the outputs into the other available slots (normally TVs come with 2).    That is all I really have, if it still doesn't work, then consult your warranty and then Sony.
j5Apt8hWaa	If you don't both have broadband internet connections, it may not be possible.  Streaming video uses a lot of bandwidth and dial up just cannot support it.

Go to the Privacy menu, and see if there are some settings that need changed. Try, for starters, allowing the camera to be seen by "Anybody". If they work, then go to "Only people on my Contact List". You want the most secure setting that still allows you to see each other. Also, be sure the camera isn't being used by another program. Most USB cams will only work in one program at a time.

cb3bd247b2615d55426b48f5842eba2caa	off course man|`|m13Se2dAaa	According to the T-Mobile website, the Dash is a Windows Mobile phone and has a Micro SD memory slot. So there are at least a couple ways you can transfer videos...    Do you sync your phone to your computer via a USB cable? If you do, Activesync (or whatever the heck it's called on Vista) will let you explore the folders on your phone and you can just grab the videos and copy and paste or drag them onto your computer.    If you have a Micros SD card (I'm guessing the phone came with one, though it may not have had much storage capacity), you can use the File Explorer on your phone to move the movies onto the card. Then you would take the card out of the phone and put it in your computer. There's a good chance you will need a card reader to do this, though most new laptops and even some desktops come with them built in. If you have a built in reader - you may still need the Micro SD to SD card adapter, but that hopefully came with the card.    Windows may automatically convert the file for use on your computer or the movies might work right away in Windows Media Player or Quicktime. But if it doesn't, you'll have to either convert the videos or find a player.    It's not as bad as it sounds ;-)

Go to music and check mark "sync music"    That should work, if not then sorry i don't know what to do.    Good Luck...
Xxviy63Paa	Depends on whether you mean a spin-roll, a simple helical roll, or a real barrel roll. Simply spinning around while you're moving forward isn't a barrel roll.    Since you didn't say which game, I'll tell you about real barrel-roll. procedure. Your plane starts out in straight level flight. You yaw to one side and roll the opposite way, at the same time increase pitch so your plane moves up. If you're doing a clockwise barrel roll, this turns your plane to the right, at the same time tilting left and up. It's tricky but if you apply the controls just right you can fly in a curve that traces the edge of a cylinder. Once you are at the "top" of the cylinder, your plane will have turned to a 90-degree angle with your original flight path. Just keep the same pitch and roll angle and your plane should trace the rest of the "barrel" and end up on its original flight path. You may need to tweak the rudder to get it to look good.     Here is an image of a proper barrel roll:    http://www.bss214.com/tactics/Image4.gif    As you can see, it is essentially a stretched-out loop. If you can keep a constant pitch and roll, and make it continue in the same direction at a significant velocity, congratulations, it's a barrel-roll.|`|AQPmrsVSaa	Press Z or R twice.

I own a A590is and I like it. People have reported problems with turning it on and having a lense error, but I leave it on the playback symbol so the lense won't activate when I turn it on. It is a good camera, and I have had no problems.|`|xG5ZlJDqaa	Wow. You do know the cameras you listed range from simple point-and-shoot cameras to DSLRS with full manual control? Have you checked the prices in your local electronics/camera store? Have you learned about what real photography is- the rule of thirds, exposure, lighting, etc?     The first thing to look at before buying any camera is, logically, you're budget. If you're not-so-stinkin-rich than go after the A509IS, if you have loads of money to spare for the camera and several lens, go for the Canon XSi.     The second thing is to look at what you're gonna do with your camera. If you're a snapshooter and wan't minimal fuss, the A590IS should do just fine. If you're a serious enthusiast thats want the most comprehensive manual controls, the XSi is your ticket. If you want good image quality and manual controls without the bulk of a slr, then the Canon G10 is one of the best in the category. Keep in mind that purchasing a slr is never a one time purchase, you're much more likely to spend way more on assecories and lens than the on the body itself.
qGfAlDd2aa	Since you asked, the technical term is "macro blocking".  Macro blocking is caused by a disturbance in the digital bit stream somewhere between the camera and your TV.  The most likely cause is somewhere in the cable company's system.    You are paying for cable and deserve better quality than that.  Call them and complain.

oQSzZeubaa	Hello!  The Fender Squire Affinity Series Stratocasters (see http://www.squierguitars.com/products/se... for current models) do have a thinner body than the standard Fender guitars.  Keep in mind, you are giving up some quality in components, overall fit and finish, playability, and of course tone with the Squire models as opposed to a more-expensive American or Mexican-made guitar.  Guitar Center does show the Affinity models (see http://www.guitarcenter.com/Squier-by-Fe... and http://www.guitarcenter.com/Squier-by-Fe... ), but I would recommend that you visit a store carrying both Squire series and Fender standard instruments, just so you can play the different models and make an informed choice.  You can always make your purchase on-line later.  Hope this helps.  Best regards, Dana

Usually you are able to change the shutter speed, but it depends.|`|fp9bOiVFaa	For a point-and-shoot camera that's fine.|`|xG5ZlJDqaa	It should work just fine for most amateurs/snapshooters. 1/2 a second  limits you from doing long exposures (the cityscapes you see in books, etc) but that's hardly a problem for most people.    I think what really matters is shutter lag. Shutter lag is the time it takes for the camera to actually take the picture after pressing the shutter. It is what causes huge fustration among compact camera buyers when they're trying to capture a fleeting moment in time. Times range from 0.5 sec to 1 seconds in good light, 2-4 seconds in darker conditions. I found Sony, Canon, and Panasonic cameras to have reliable and fast autofocus systems, consider them if low shutter lag is a must.|`|e76f94644ba717d14e758eb9252c03a8aa	Normal for a point and shoot    For a dSLR it is kind of limited.|`|o9AMqmygaa	yes

so95ktlIaa	umm they will send you a bill around the 15th. They will prorate your service from the previous month....meaning they will charge you an amount for every day you had service in the last month.

For example February is coming up and say you get a bill the 9th, it will be for billing cycle Dec 10- Jan 9. So if you got a new account Dec 25, you're bill will be from Dec 25-Jan 9th. The people at verizon are idiots but that phone company is the best one ever. I just switched to AT&T after having verizon for 7 years and I have never had so many dropped calls in my life. good luck|`|1hciyvKdaa	I dont remember all the specifics to be honest, but you will not be charged for any days that you did not use, they have a confusing system but never do you pay more than you should, and if you see something odd, call them, they do right it.  Something good about Verizon if you see your going over, you can up the plan for that month only, now you need to cancel that on the first day of the next month plan, back to the original, they do up the bill for that month and it is all confusing and all, but for 2 years I had to do this back and forth and it always in the end did not cost me more, and even I upped one month, then at the starting of the next month went down, went up again, went down again at the middle exact day of the month and then terminated service, I was done with my 2 years, even with all that mess, It was completely fair and worked out great. Their ways are confusing, thier service is good. They even offered a secret plan of less mins and less price to not have me cancel that I wish I had of known about it was a 29.99 plan that you can only get if you ask or something, but I had already bought a cricket. So anyhow, they give a long time to pay the bill its not due the day its in your mail box, so dont worry. Hope this helped a little.|`|0IjomiJ2aa	they prorate

tHjBr4L4aa	My 3-second answer.    I'd chose the Sigma 24-70mm f/2.8 because I already have and love my Nikon 18-200mm VR.    Different lenses for different needs.    The Sigma's great for low light photos, while the Nikon's designed as a carrry around lens covering a wider range.|`|1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	niether, i like canon|`|qIR9DB9Haa	18-200 for these reasons. I have read the Sigma lens is incredibly heavy and the image quality is just so so, with a lot of lens flair and vignette. The Nikon glass is bound to be higher quality and you get a really awesome range plus it has VR. Obviously the Sigma does have f/2.8, but unless you need to stop motion indoors its not going to help more than having VR.|`|xG5ZlJDqaa	What you're comparing is a superzoom do-it-all camera and a professional wedding lens. They are simply not really comparable. The 18-200mm offers a wider wide end a further telephoto reach, but is hindered by it's slower aperture (3.5-5.6), and more chromatic abberation, softness, and distortion at various focala lengths. The 24-70mm doesn't have such a versatile zoom range, but it offers the low-light flexibility of its large aperture (2.8) and it has better control of distortion, ca, and vignetting.    If you prefer a do-it-all lens in a compact package, consider comparing the Sigma 18-200 with the Nikon 18-200. The Nikon sells for more, but has a better anti-shake system and better build quality.    If you want a 24-70mm "normal" zoom lens, compare the sigma 24-700 with Nikon's own equivalent. Again, Nikon wins fairly easily in most respects, but also sells for considerably more than the Sigma.

9sRUf4zEaa	Ok, if you can't find anything after contacting customer support the worst case is you need to send it in for repairs. But before you do that, you can try use the recovery menu. You access the recovery menu by holding down the reset button until you hear 3 beeps (note you may just go to standby mode, just attempt it again and this is assuming your problem is a system problem rather than a mechanical)    There 6 options, basically you can say it's the order of operation. First is a simple restart, restore to default settings (if problem with theme for example), restore system file (this will completely reboot the ps3 system to when you first got it but keep all of your personal content like save files and games and firmware), rebuild database (like it says, wipe your personal content), and finally restore ps3 system (complete reboot, start from scratch, this is if all else fails) and just the defult system update.

Go to your computer and if you have a sensor, wait until it loads.  6. If the PSP folder does not open automatically, go to My Documents, then click the dropdown box and select My Computer.   7. Search for the folder name with E:\ or F:\ (most common) in the beginning.  8. If that doesn't work, click the Start button on Windows.  9. Click the Run... button.  10. Type in E:\ (in caps) or F:\. If none of them do anything but say there's an error, then buy another PSP to PC USB connector (this problem happened once and I bought another one, mine wasn't powerful enough.)    Good luck!|`|klkt4VAqaa	connect both ends of the usb cord to the psp and computer    then go to home on your psp  and find "USB connection" in the settings section, which is above "Video settings" and below "Network update"    press "x"  or "o"  (depending on what country you bought your psp in or your settings).............then an autorun should start up on your computer    go to the folder"MUSIC" and thats where you put your songs ad you can listen to them at "Memory Stick" of the Music section    if there isnt a "MUSIC" folder, then you can make a new folder yourself......and make sure that every single letter have to be in capitals or else it doesnt work|`|XpaEk0KFaa	i agree with acornpuff

They say you can pause live TV because when you pause the show it was currently live once you come back it is now a recording however once you catch up it is now back to live TV and no longer a recording. please feel free to email me any other questions you might have.

A digital coaxial cable from the sound card's digital output, to the A/V receiver's digital input, will eliminate all of the interference and sound great.

Dso7k3sjaa	Have you tried playing the Nancy Drew games?  I know, I know...I don't like the books either.  I loved them when I was a little girl, but wouldn't want to read them now, lol!    But, I was just given a couple of them by a friend and even though I was really doubtful that I would like them, it turns out I do.  :-)    They are point and click and they are not super hard.  Plus, if you get really stuck you can just type the name of the game into your browser's search bar and there are walkthroughs  for each of them.  Also, the company that makes the games has a website where you can go on and ask questions of other players if you get stuck but you don't want to read an actual walkthrough.  The website is called, HerInteractive.  You can buy the games directly from them, or you can go to stores such as Target, Walmart, Best Buy, etc. and buy the actual game so you have a disk.  That's what I did after I played the two my friend gave to me.  I went and bought more.  They even sell them where you can get 4 games in one box for only $20 at Target.  (Or maybe the one that had four games in one was a little more than $20, but not much if it was.  I bought 6 games -- two single and one 4 pack, lol!)  Love those games now.  The two single ones I bought were older games (some of the first few ever made in that series) so they were less than $10 a piece.    Anyway, there isn't any fighting and I find that they definitely keep me interested.  They can be a bit frustrating at times though, that's why I told you where to go on the web if you get really stuck.  And, when you're actually playing, it's not the same at all as trying to read those old books.  It's a lot more fun then that.  ;-)    Oh, and I just looked at the requirements on the box and they are XP/Vista compatible.

3CJAUyqPaa	The DV port on ALL miniDV tape based camcorders is ALWAYS 4 pin. The other side of the cable - when used with Macintosh computers equipped with a firewire port - can be either 6-pin or 9-pin.    The newest MacBooks have no firewire port - neither does the MacBook Air. ALL other Apple Macintosh computer made in about the last 10 years or so have a firewire port.    For the most part only non-Macintosh computers with a firewire port might use a 4-pin firewire port, so you do not need to worry about this in your Mac environment.    HOWEVER... DVD based camcorders have no DV port - so firewire is not used. In order to transfer video from a DVD based camcorder to a Mac - or any computer, for that matter, your computer needs to have a drawer loading DVD drive. If your computer does not have a drawer loading DVD drive, you need to get one - an external is fine. I like the externals from LaCie. NEVER put a small or odd-shaped disc in a slot loader - the disc will get scratched and you will break the drive.  Download and install HandBrake  http://handbrake.fr/  Finalize the disc in the camcorder. Take the disc out - put it in the drawer loading DVD drive. Launch HandBrake. Rip the video to a format your editor likes - in this case, iMovie likes mov, DV or MP4 files.    When the ripping is done, quit HandBrake and Launch iMovie. Name the video project, select the destination, etc... when the iMovie windows opens, drag the ripped video to the clips/log-capture pane or the timeline. Edit. Burn to iDVD or export as an uploadable mov file...|`|jLTDqVHsaa	Look for the port on your Mac.  I'm not familiar with Macbooks, I forget whether they're 4-pin or 6-pin, but if it's a Mac desktop, you'll almost certainly have a 6-pin there.  Your camera has a 4-pin port ("i.Link" on Sony camcorders, same thing).    EDIT: A quick search shows Macbooks having 6-pin ports (some seem to have 9-pin ports as well, actually), but double-check yourself.  Look up images of 6-pin ports, compare them to what you have on your Mac, and then you'll know for sure.

fwnqB0dTaa	No one should ever need to call their service provider to block a number, as most phones have the facility to do it yourself.    You need to call up the number from your call log, call up the options menu from there, there should be an option to block that particular number.    Of course if they block their number when calling you have a problem as your phone won't recognise who it is and will let the call through.    NB: Sometimes it is only possible to block calls, and not text messages    Also NB: This is phone specific as the setting is stored directly on the phone. If you change phone you will need to set up the block again, and any blocked text messages will suddenly arrive.|`|ZtECjEPyaa	try pulling up his number, select options, and select BLOCK.

m9j3kUH2aa	i've played both and found both thoroughly enjoyable.    You'll get more play time out of Fallout 3, as it is built on Elder Scrolls 4 : Oblivion technology (i had some crashing prpblems but i think that was a vista 64 bit problem).    Crysis : Warhead was very impressive visually but i found didnt give me the same immersion as fallout. the storyline wasnt as engaging. but as the other answer said, its up to what kind of game you prefer. they are 2 different game genre's.    Crysis is a FPS  Fallout 3 is a RPG through an FPS perspective.    Crysis is my personal choice but i grew up playing doom 2 and duke nukem 3d.|`|ykXzzx65aa	well it really depends on waht u like  if u like FPS get crysis  if u like RPG get fall out   if u like both get Fallout, u wont regret it

Y5MvGoSraa	It depends, if you like hardcore games then I would suggest buying a xbox 360, but if you like fun entertaining games then buy a wii  my opinion would be to buy a wii because I have one and I think it's awesome because its so much fun to play and never gets old.    Also if you are looking for a wii I would suggest calling stores everyday to see if they have wii's in stock if they do go right away and buy it, that's how I got my wii. Hope I Helped|`|CcyC26mpaa	it depends..  if your into hardcore gaming, go with the xbox 360  if your into more casual, easy going games, go with wii.  i have both of them and i personally like the wii more, but go with what your gaming style is.|`|HmAYw6W5aa	wii love the wii!!!|`|mQEANwhOaa	The wii is very fun, but I like the xbox360 games a lot better.

BBOR7Vwmaa	Ipod Touch    Touch is at least 10 times better    It looks great.    Its great for listening to music, and is laid out perfectly    Watching a movie is actually good. I do it often, unlike I would on a crappy little screen made for text like on the Classic.    It can view photos in awesome quality and make them your background. It can even take a screen shot of your iPod and keep it as a photo.    It has a handy home button and a lock button which is clicker instead of switch.    You can access the internet on it using Wi-Fi, use it as a good calculator, time, navigator in the city hot spots, weather, video watcher, keeping your contacts, mail the lot.    You can get third party applications (which I use MORE than music videos and photos put together) which do things for me like night clock, thousands of games, torch, drawing art program, facebook and myspace, the train, tram and bus timetables, language translator, it even has a cool application which connects to your computer so you can control its iTunes. The apps are free or paid (from a dollar up)    Its slim, and has in built speakers (but mine doesnt because I have the first gen) and fits great in your pocket    the Classic is still good of course but if your not worried about size or money or whatever go the Touch    I payed $500 for my 16gb and its worth every cent seriously dude get the touch    Sorry to make it long  Alex|`|RyDWXeYcaa	touch..its realy sweet!|`|qiVE00ecaa	You should probably get the touch, as it has very fun games on it.  Unless you want like 50,000 songs and dozens of videos, then the touch is the way to go.|`|FcqOie0zaa	If you have a large or growing library, go for the classic.    If you want a good picture to watch stuff on, go for the touch.
w4I9oj2Maa	Why are you attempting to calibrate a DLP TV set? They don't need calibration, the factory has already done that WITH professional calibration systems; and they   DO NOT AGE like CRT and Plasma TVs do....    Those are the ones that need calibration AFTER 5 - 7 years !  DLPs will never need calibration.    You just bought it, hook, line and sinker...  But you are NOT alone...about 50% of the people out there get it.

This typically takes years and depends on how hot the battery has been stored. In direct sunlight, sooner than in a refrigerator where it will last lots longer.

If that's the case, you can just download psp isos from any torrent site, really. I prefer demonoid, but right now it's a referral invite site only.     Anyways, if you didn't crack your psp yet, visit dgemu.com. Register on their forums, so that you can see their forum and you'll find a good amount of helpful guides about emulating/cracking your psp. Also, if you don't want to sign up for dg emu, just google something along the lines of ,"psp crack." You'll find a bunch of helpful sites, but also keep in mind you'll find a handful of malicious sites along with the helpful ones. Keep your antivirus on if you go google hunting. DGemu is safe though. I can personally vouch for them.|`|mexKpN6iaa	go to www.pspiso.com and register but don't worry it is free
IOGSCjVxaa	Whatever you do, don't throw it on the ground and step on it!  That can't be good for the warranty lol.    I have some suggestions:  1) go into settings and make sure the pop-up blocker is on.  2) try resetting your ipod on itunes  3) maybe try a different email address and see if it happens?  4) ask an expert on apple.com or look for support  5) if none of that works, take it to the apple store to the genius counter and get them to look at it.    sorry if i'm not much help...i tried.|`|Pwqx6yZvaa	alright, so what has happened is you prob dont have internet connection, i have the iphone and that same boxy thingy comes up and says u cant read it and stuff, u basically have to go to settings and check your internet connection, if thats not it i would suggest going to best buy or a near by apple store and maybe they could help you with it.

0PVp8Okoaa	Okay,  well you mean your internal memory right?  On my old kodak camera, you could transfer pictures from internal memory to memory card. check the manual or just browse through the options. Look out for the options with 'copy' or 'move..'
eByVtEyNaa	Ok if you still have your receipt, take it back to where you bought it, it may still be on warranty. If not you could just do what they would and send your psp to sony and they will probably fix it for you.|`|lhuJ5K5caa	go to game they do free replacements|`|OzNfhmaEaa	probably not, I would try ebay (even though you said not online)|`|Gw4vYwVDaa	check gamestop youll probably have to buy a new one though|`|IzRkIqPEaa	Where are you from?

xG5ZlJDqaa	Those cameras are not really comparable. The 10D came out five years ago, while the XS came out last year. The 10D is fine in terms if image quality, but you're missing out in terms of live view and anti-dust systems. It's antique compared to its successors, the 40 and 50D. A better comparison would be to pitch the Canon XS against Nikon D40.   dpreview.com offers in-depth reviews of both.
SBcxooLsaa	plug out everything then plug it back in after like 10 mins-1hr|`|9AR6B4ELaa	just send it to microsoft and they'll fix it for you
