JWjlyztBaa	The case in California centers around the principle that fundamental revisions of the California Constitution cannot be made through mere initiatives that require a mere majority vote. When one attempts to exclude a significant portion of the population of the equal enjoyment and protection of the law, a fundamental revision must occur.      When the Court finds for Petitioner on this basis, the Prop 8 "Amendment" will be nullified.|`|eCZ6YW4Paa	The government should never have passed any laws concerning a religious practice (separation of church and state). There should be no government regulated marriage and no laws concerning any form of marriage.     There should only be government sanctioned contracts between two people granting specific legal rights. If those two people want to then get married under their church they then have the option to do so; provided the church is willing to do so.|`|lTx8Hoheaa	I don't see any good arguments for it, really.    "The very purpose of the Bill of Rights was to withdraw certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political controversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities and officials and to establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts.     One's right to life, liberty, and property, to free speech, a free press, freedom of worship and assembly, and other fundamental rights may not be submitted to vote; they depend on the outcome of no elections."    Supreme Court, 1943, West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette|`|3qqvFEsHaa	the arguments against same sex marriage are gay...|`|bxxwhP04aa	First and foremost, gay relationships are not normal.  Two men cannot produce a baby, and two women cannot produce a baby.  Therefore, this behavior is abnormal.    This abnormal behavior has led the gays to become quite militant.  They get violent at times, demanding rights that they already have.  They can still vote, live together, play together, buy groceries together, and all the things all the rest of us do.  They ought not be allowed to shove their agenda down the throats of everyone who disagrees with them.      Gay relationships are perversions of what God intended for mankind to be....and they lead to heartache and pain for most or all of them.  And children being brought up in such an atmosphere will never likely know the truth of real, honest, God-given relationships.|`|UujliMsCaa	Separation of church and state.    As long as marriage is "legally binding" it is a matter of the state.    Why are so many Christians saying gays should be denied marriage rights when they are getting divorced left and right? Sanctity of marriage? Where? Haven't seen much of that going on.    *Expanding - Christians say that "Civil Unions" are the same, but they're not. I think we should make "Secular Marriages" and "Religious Marriages". All having the same rights but allowing the religious to deny whoever they want their version of marriage.    **Oh.. and one more thing - If marriage is a "religious" thing, why are atheists allowed to be married by a judge? The "vow" is supposed to be made between man and God. If they didn't vow anything to God, it's not religious and therefore part of the State, not the Church.|`|ulwXFrrJaa	I made a youtube movie for my argument.     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_xNsY3Gp...|`|bbb54bf0ec8402ddca69477ca36c6ddeaa	i don't have an argument.... if your not gay it not like your being forced to have one... i'm not gay so i'm not having one|`|mSFjbetxaa	To deny gays the protection that a legal marriage bestows is discrimination based on gender.    Civil Unions are not federally recognized, thus making them no where near the same as marriage.    The religious nut jobs have no right to force their ignorance and bigotry on others by putting it into our laws.              "The civil rights of none shall be abridged on account of religious belief or worship, nor shall any national religion be established, nor shall the full and equal rights of conscience be in any manner, or on any pretence, infringed.'' - James Madison (Original wording of the First Amendment; Annals of Congress 434 (June 8, 1789).)            *It cracks me up when the ignorant fundies compare this to marrying an animal.  First of all, their dog is probably way too smart to marry someone with inferior intelligence.  Second of all, an animal is not capable of signing the license.*|`|io7nHB3Oaa	A constitutional amendment that would fundamentally change both the definition of marriage and the civil rights to a large minority is a fundamental revision and should therefore require 2/3rds majority approval.   On a federal level giving benefits based on discriminatory state marriage laws is reprehensible, and marriage benefits should be offered to gay (and straight) couples who enter into civil unions or similar binding legal contracts.|`|AA10096992	1. It should get overturned because there is no compelling reason to prevent consenting adults from marrying.    2. The consequences are fairly insignificant if it gets overturned. People who currently can't get married, will be able to. Non-gays will not be affected AT ALL.     But if it stands, it would destroy thousands of legal marriages that currently exist. Christianity will have dealt a historic blow against marriage, freedom, equality, and family values. Way to go, Fundies!|`|BQ6WmoHiaa	I vote no on gay marriage.  If it's civil rights they want, they can have a civil union.  It's really that simple, no matter how dramatic an "issue" they make it.  If a civil union isn't suitable, make it suitable at the federal level and get on with it.  You can whine about "bigotry" and "hate" all you want, that has nothing to do with it (just more dramatics to cloud the issue and vilify the majority).    Equality isn't device for distorting everything in sight until it's the way A FEW want it.  That's called something else altogether.    As with most other things, this is how it is here and if you don't care for it, I suggest identifying a better place for you to live and moving there.  Not meaning to be insulting, but I really don't understand why 9 people disagree with 1 person and the 9 people are apparently "bigots" who "hate" the 1 person.  Whatever.    My favorite part is that it's not just Christians who don't agree with this, yet we take all the heat from ignorant supporters of gay marriage.  Like I said...there's 1 person and then there's 9.    God bless you.|`|TyRfv0eoaa	I'll give two arguments in favor of gay marriage:  1. Despite what some claim, gay marriage is not new. It has existed in nearly every culture on earth since the beginning of time. Even Europe didn't stop such marriages until the 13th century, and it was European colonists who taught the rest of the world to fear and/or hate homosexuals. Marriages have been defined by cultures. Thus, we have monogamy, polyandry, same sex marriage, and the one that is most common in scripture: polygamy.  2. The Hebrew Old Testament contains the record of one same-sex marriage. It was not condemned by God or any of the prophets alive at the time. It also mentions another one in passing, again, with no condemnation. (You won't find these in your English Bibles, thanks to the translators.)    Finally, just in passing, marriage is a civil right today. Religious involvement is not required. If your church doesn't want to marry gay people, it will not be required to.|`|fAn14yGSaa	Is it going to matter anyway....when Obama revokes the the Marriage act, and removes the States rights to say who can marry, it will be all out craziness with the Homosexual crowd, hurrying to marry.  WHY they want to is beyond me....unless it is to be seen as "normal". That is nuts too.  Because being married is not always NORMAL!    Oh well,  to each his own.  We have no say in the long run anyway....  What is a vote anymore?  Courts can toss out what the majority want, and say NOPE, you have to do it this way.....

No, they can't have children. Are we going to stop infertile heterosexuals from marrying for that reason too? or are you grasping at straws because of your RELIGIOUS VIEWS?

I do wish people wouldn't come on here just to slam religions, or ask questions like "Why are Christians so stupid?" or "Should it be legal to take Christian kids from Christian parents, so they're not brainwashed?" or "Why does it offend my Jewish neighbor when I tell her she's an idiot for believing in God?"

It sounds like you got reported...    I'm sorry.  That always stinks.  I'd never report you, ?Dan?s!|`|m29eEm57aa	I find that asking an honest question; no games, no trolling, no agenda usually elicits at least four honest answers .  .. the problem, of course is that almost any question that does not refer to Jesus as "Lord" gets reported or, from the more cowardly sect, "thumbed". I once asked Christians why they would deign to use the Roman signal for death in the arena (usually Christian deaths) to voice an anonymous concern (the question was reported of course). This doesn't apply only to the pseudo-religious of course. The so'called "rational" side (usually attributed to "atheism") is, some times even more ridiculous and sophomoric in their unfounded, and usually less than stellar "logic".     Still, I agree with you. Beyond the amusement factor there are good people here.

9e71236ddd91a1ac14a12c704616491caa	I saw it.  I did feel genuinely bad for him.  As I see it, he didn't really hurt anybody, he just used some drugs and had some gay sex, and then lied about it (or at least failed to tell anyone).  It's not like he murdered anyone or molested children.  In fact, I thought his treatment was somewhat outrageous since certain priests and pastors who are alleged to have molested children don't get the same punishment at all, and instead are just shuffled into another congregation and hidden from public criticism.      The church can do what it wants, but the fact that Haggard is an outcast from society at large and can't even get a job in the secular world because of his public scandal sickens me a little bit.  But not too much, because I can't muster that much sympathy for someone who refuses to be honest with himself.|`|Pm8EpAbhaa	He's been judged in the same way he's judged others.|`|lmWqwpygaa	No.  I do not feel sorry for him. He knew what he was doing. He was cheating the people who trusted him. He is a criminal-period.   As for his church.....well, conservative Christians have been pointing  fingers at those phony baloney churches for years, but nobody listens. Most all of those Independent Charismatic churches are fake.    Another BIG problem here is that most non-Christian (and play-like Christians) people can't tell the difference between a real church and a false one.   So.....what do you expect?|`|bxxwhP04aa	Yes, I do feel bad for him.  Each and every one of us deals with some issue on an ongoing basis, Christian or not.  That man is in a trap of the devil, and he did not know how to get out.  Many people are in devilish traps and know not how to get free.  What a shame, for the Lord Jesus did come to set captives free.  Our churches lack when they cannot use their spiritual authority to set people free.

He is forgiven, but he must be cleansed of all inequity within. He let his lust fester until it went out of control. Who knows what is going to happen to him now, unless he repent and change. But truth is was he ever of God in the first place? So many seek to serve yet have not been conditioned for service.|`|FpMS47sXaa	I did not see it, no. I don't pay for HoBO.    However, poor poor Ted. While I take issue with this "heterosexuality with homosexual issues" I still feel bad for the poor guy. YES, he has made his bed and now must lie in it. I'm all for that - I just wish, Hell, I hope and pray that one day people can live as they were meant to without some self-righteous-know-it-all-bigot coming after them screaming "turn or burn, f a ggot!!".

oGVvEl3Maa	i wish that i could help you with this question...  but i have been considering 'surrender' much myself lately... i was even thinking about asking a question about it but i did not know how to phrase the question properly.    i think it is a process where we die to the old self... ego (pride, vanity and self-conceit... etc...) and come into a blessing from our LORD.  (Gifts of the Spirit... fruits of righteousness... Galatians 5:5)    insha'Allah.    i believe that full surrender to God is very difficult... but with His Help... all things are possible.      may Allah Subhana wa Ta'ala forgive us, guide us and bless us as we strive to surrender to Him.  [Shahada]    it is written that when we take a step towards our LORD... He takes MANY towards us... (paraphrased)    i got this from our brother in the faith...  [Within ones inner most heart, ones likes and dislikes must conform to God's pleasure.  All things both good and bad must be turned over to Allah.  One must give thanks for the good and for the bad.    This is better known as "Surrender".]    "For if anyone thinks himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself."  Galatians 6:3 [?]|`|wWL934E8aa	To surrender means you put up your hands, so to speak and sometimes literally, and saying, not my will but yours and let God rule.

""  It was a miraculous Christmas day when young Arthur pulled the sword from the stone. In all the tumultuous crowd that witnessed the deed, none was more surprised than Arthur himself.    "Where is Merlin?" he thought, certain that the wizard had accomplished this feat with magic. But Merlin did not show his face. Deep in the night, long after everyone else had gone to bed, Arthur still sat up wondering if his destiny really was to be king.      "I need you master," he prayed. Suddenly there was a light under the door. Arthur leapt to his feet and opened it, but the old wizard hadn't come. It was only Kay, his adopted brother.      "How are you faring?" Kay asked. Arthur did not know what to say, but as he turned back into the room he took a sharp breath.  "Hold your light higher." Arthur said. Kay raised the candle, and its light fell upon three objects that had appeared on Arthur's bed. A straw doll, a broken slingshot, and a cracked mirror.    "Do you see those?" Arthur asked in a strange voice. Kay looked confused and said, "I see them but they mean nothing to me."    "I wished for Merlin's help and now these have appeared," said Arthur. "This moldy straw doll was my first toy. I must have been two when Merlin made it for me. This broken slingshot I made from deer skin, and fought willow when I was eight. This cracked mirror I found in the woods when I was twelve. Do you know what they have in common?" Kay shook his head.    "They were the most important things I ever owned, each in its own time. And now look at them," said Arthur, whom seemed very moved.    "Worthless trash," Kay muttered.    "Yet I am overjoyed to see them," Arthur said, "for now I know that Merlin has guided me all along. You see Kay, when I was two I only wanted toys. When I was eight I only wanted to hunt sparrows and squirrels. And when I was twelve I only wanted to look in the mirror wondering if girls would find me ugly or handsome. All these things I have put behind me, and yet each one was a stepping stone to this very moment. One day, so shall I put away the crown, although it is my sole wish and destiny today."    Kay was a simple stout soul who revered the monarchy, and was shocked. "Why would anyone throw away the crown?" he asked in bewilderment.    Arthur replied, "I shall throw it away when it becomes as trivial as a doll, as useless as a broken sling, and as vain as a mirror. I think that's what Merlin wanted me to see."  ""    "Giving up power seems very frightening. But it's really like giving up a little child's toys. You grow out of it. And then the surrender is easy.  The same holds true for any stage of evolution, once it is no longer true to our inner being." ~Deepok Chopra      Surrender is constantly happening within life, in one form or another. Whether it be a child surrendering his old toys for new joys, or an adult surrendering egoistic vanity for the giving of true love.  To surrender are the steps of our journey.

Now, if someone will say, 'well, it is ok to use the term Father about someone, but Matt. 23:9 precludes one of calling someone 'Father' (which is another way of using Mt. 23:9 against Catholics) who is spiritual, Jesus himself shows that is not his way of thinking. Here there is someone who appeals for mercy from Abraham. He specifically calls and uses the term 'Father' directly to Abraham. Now, Jesus himself uses the term 'Father' to apply to Abraham in the parable, with Abraham not only accepting the title but legitimizing the title by calling the person 'Son' (Lk 16:25) even if he refuses the request|`|WQvqLnnhaa	There is only one Father and He is God.|`|587e1cb8d798bdb9902f704f41a32cc2aa	God is God...Father is someone whose part of DNA you have or has the definition changed since I last used a dictionary??|`|1K2koRWiaa	This text is not meant to be taken literally.  It simply says that we should look to things above.  Do not keep our eyes solely here on earth, but know that our true father, the father of all, is in Heaven.    Catholic priests, are called "Fr. ..." because as we look to our biological fathers to raise us, we look to these priests to represent our Father in heaven, and to guide us in his ways.  "Father" is a word, a name that we use out of respect.  But our ultimate respect, and our father of all is God.  This is the message our Lord was trying to convey.    And I also saw some blogs about Mary, the Virgin in heaven.  She is out Mother, for the same reasons God is our father.  Catholics do not worship her "more than God".  Catholics pray to her asking her to intercede for us, her children.  Who knows Jesus better than his very mother?  She looks out for us, and prays for us, and we are called to go to her to ask for help.  When we say "Mary" she says "Jesus".|`|FGcwxZz0aa	The short answer is because the Bible says to and because it has been done since biblical times.    From the early Church we find that clergy were addressed as father. There are those with little knowledge of history or hermeneutical discipline such as understanding Scriptures within context, who believe that the Bible prohibits one from calling a priest father. The words they rely on come directly from Christ:    (Mat 23:9 DRB) And call none your father upon earth; for one is your father, who is in heaven.    Keeping the verse in context let us look at the verse preceding this verse:    (Mat 23:8 DRB) But be not you called Rabbi. For one is your master: and all you are brethren.    Rabbi means teacher and the Latin word for teacher is doctor so anyone using these terms as well are violating the literal interpretation of the text.     Let us look at the verse after verse 9:    (Mat 23:10 DRB) Neither be ye called masters: for one is your master, Christ.    There is no way that the interpretation could be correct if one reads and understands the Matthew passage in context. He is clearly teaching that one should not look to any human authority as our teacher, father, master, doctor or other titles of respect but instead give to God those things that are reserved for Him. Do you also refuse to call people doctor, teacher, professor, mister, or master? All of these are forbidden as well if we are to accept a literal understanding.     Context also requires that we investigate what the other Scriptures say as well as the understanding of these words by those who followed Christ. There are many instances where the writers of the New Testament contradict a literal understanding of not calling a man father, teacher or master. Consider the following verses:    (Act 5:34 DRB) But one in the council rising up, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, respected by all the people, commanded the men to be put forth a little while.    (Col 4:1 DRB) Masters, do to your servants that which is just and equal: knowing that you also have a master in heaven.    (2Ti 1:11 DRB) Wherein I am appointed a preacher and an apostle and teacher of the Gentiles.    Let us examine the statements of St. Stephen to see if he understood Christ to be speaking literally.In is soliloquy (Acts Chapter 7) before the Sanhedrin before his stoning to martyrdom he used the term father in referring to Abraham Isaac and Jacob as fathers and also to his Israelite ancestors as fathers.     St. John the beloved disciple also did not understand Christ to be teaching literally as we can see in the following verses:    (1Jn 2:13 DRB) I write unto you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because you have overcome the wicked one.    (1Jn 2:14 DRB) I write unto you, babes, because you have known the Father. I write unto you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and you have overcome the wicked one.    (1Jn 2:15 DRB) Love not the world, nor the things which are in the world. If any man love the world, the charity of the Father is not in him.    (1Jn 2:16 DRB) For all that is in the world is the concupiscence of the flesh and the concupiscence of the eyes and the pride of life, which is not of the Father but is of the world.    St. Paul also had a different understanding of Christs words than the literalists:    (1Co 4:14 DRB) I write not these things to confound you: but I admonish you as my dearest children.    (1Co 4:15 DRB) For if you have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet not many fathers. For in Christ Jesus, by the gospel, I have begotten you.    (1Co 4:16 DRB) Wherefore, I beseech you, be ye followers of me as I also am of Christ.    St. Paul was speaking of the fact that he is called to shepherd the flock as are all priests. We not only give birth to the Christian through Baptism but also nourish the faithful with the Holy Eucharist and Gods Word. We care for them and bind their spiritual wounds through the delivery of the Sacraments. It is no wonder that we are called father as we care for our Church family as a father cares for his own family.    In Christ  Fr. Joseph|`|MfjWoVtgaa	thats a good question but do you know that catholics don't worship Jesus as much as Mary the mother so mayb hes not seen as so important. Also the priest is representing god, and letting people know of his word so maybe its father representing God.  JESUS IS NEVER WRONG AND NEVER LIES|`|wxBFZ41Taa	No, Jesus was not wrong. But taking what Jesus obviously meant and trying to make a case for something obscure is pointless.     Matthew 23 in context, Jesus is talking about those who make a name for themselves and use their position and titles to gain undue power, praise and adulation. Read in the original language we should call no man teacher, doctor, or father. But those of us who understand what Jesus was saying do not take his words down to the trival level of refraining from using the name "father." St. Paul refers to himself as "father" to those he shepherds. We also have the parable Jesus told of the rich man and Lazarus. The rich man goes to hell and calls out to "Father Abraham." Why would Jesus use a title he condemed, even in a story? Obviously, Jesus did not condemn the title father, but the misuse of all titles to gain personal or public glory and praise.     All seven sacraments can be found in the Bible. Not all are listed as being done by Peter though, although we can be assured that he did them. We also have th early Christian writings, that tell us exactly what the new Christians believed and practiced. Ignatisu, Bishop of Antioch, was ordained by Peter and he is the first (in writing) to refer to the Christian Church as the "Catholic Church."    Making everything reliant on a Bible verse limits your ability to know God. The Bible does not say that everything must be in it in order to be valid.

vwZvxNevaa	Well since it isn't possible why do you need to know how you can? Oh sure it would be awesome to go around biting people. I don't think it is all fake though. I do believe vampires are more than fiction. I think there can be a genetic flaw. There has actually been some sort of research done that says they have existed. Prof. Eftimiou recently conducted calculations on the assumption that the first vampire came into being in 1600 at a time when the Earths population totaled about 600 million. The original vampire bit his first victim, which bit another one, and thus triggered a chain reaction of sorts. Eftimious calculations indicate that the whole world would have been populated by vampires within two years; everybody would have gone for the jugular had the scenario proved correct. Yet nothing of the above took place in reality. Therefore, there is no such thing as vampires.   I guess if you wanted to be one then you should look into witchcraft and athiest stuff and try that out and maybe find some sort of spell or contacting the devil. If you just want some teeth then that is easy you can file to make it look like real fangs or buy some that look real at Hot Topic! Then maybe look into finding chat sites or cults with people of the same ideas as you and thoughts as you.  In the mean time you should really try out this awesom app on myspace called bloodlines.

d20feb0d03f94b65cc82fb1a12566011aa	I consider Zeitgeist to be an intellectually dishonest documentary, not because of the filmmakers personal bias, but because of its disregard for the truth. There is so much questionable statements that can easily be refuted, or controversial points that have legitimate opposing views that should have been presented.    - Regarding part 1: Jesus    The "Mythology of Jesus" theory was an obscure and generally dismissed theory.   It has gained exposure due to author "Acharya S" and her collaboration with the Zeitgeist filmmaker. (She is also author of the films companion guide). But even the casual but astute viewer will find considerable silliness in the some of the conjectures where practically any numerical or astrological connection 'proves' mytholical derision. Son=sun? Three stars in Orions belt = three kings? Virgo = Mary because the astrological sign sort of looks like an M? Who buys this stuff?    Some other views:    " The idea of Jesus as a myth is rejected by the majority of biblical scholars and historians. In 2004, Richard Burridge and Graham Gould stated that they did not know of any "respectable" scholars that held the view today. Robert E. Van Voorst has stated that biblical scholars and historians regard the thesis as "effectively refuted"."    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_myth_...    For a point-by-point analysis, see http://www.conspiracyscience.com/article...    For more rebuttals, see http://webskeptic.wikidot.com/zeitgeist-...      - Regarding Part II: 9/11    It should be noted upfront that being skeptical of the 'official version' of anything presented by the government or media, is a good thing for society. And it should also be noted that questioners of 9/11 'offical versions' range from genuine intellectual pursuits of greater truths, to bizarre interpretations specifically intended to support a unwavering point of view.     The Zeitgeist filmmaker is part of that spectrum that has bought into the theory that the government orchestrated the whole thing. Unfortunately the evidence they selected and presented was sloppy and much of it easily disproved, even by members of the Truth movement. (I've heard some speculate this may have been a red-herring to discredit the 'truth' movement).    For a point by point analysis, see http://www.conspiracyscience.com/article...        - Regarding Part III: Men behind the curtain    As a liberatarian, I found this part to have had the most potential in exposing abuses of government and men in power. Instead, it trots out tired long disproven conspiracy theories.     "Income Tax law Doesn't exist" theory - Very stale. Consistently disproven over-and-over again. No new information, just new victims going to jail that fall for these arguments. Very sad.     "Federal Reserve System is owned by international bankers" - Still a common conspiracy theory. Still wrong. The Federal Reserve System, is headed by the Board of Governors, a Government Agency (look it up - http://www.whitehouse.gov/government/ind... ). The Federal Reserve branches can definitely be considered tightly regulated corporations owned by their member banks, all of which must be American-owned by law. It is receives regular audits, and is overseen by congress.     For a point-by-point analysis, check out:  http://webskeptic.wikidot.com/zeitgeist-...  http://webskeptic.wikidot.com/zeitgeist-...  http://webskeptic.wikidot.com/zeitgeist-...    Other views:    "There is no shortage of information which refutes this viewpoint. But this type of conspiracy relies on two elements common to web surfers: First, they're only willing to check facts at the most superficial level, which usually means they'll read a message or watch a clip just once before forming an opinion and moving on. " Ref:   http://media.wildcat.arizona.edu/media/s...    "...(a) common problem in the film: presenting something in such a shallow manner without further corroboration or scholarly evidence." - Ref:   http://gauntlet.ucalgary.ca/story/12284    There are those who defend the film because they believe that agenda+motive is more important than truth.

Some of what it says is true, much is not (with regard to christianity). This film qualifies as propaganda because of the lack of diverse sources, the fact that the narrator tells the viewer what to think (about the "facts") and that the presupposition is that the information contained in the film is privileged information that would be difficult for the viewer to find.       It basically says "We know more than you could ever know, all evidence supports our conclusions and this is what you should think about christianity."|`|mrzeXJ6Eaa	I watched it, because I keep hearing about Zeitgeist.     As far as Christianity, we celebrate Christ's birth on December 25th. That date was purposefully chosen to compete with celebrations that worshiped Pagan gods. Jesus was not born on December 25th though.     As far as three wise men. The Bible doesn't say how many there were. We put three wise men in nativity scenes, because there were three types of gifts.    So, it is not exactly like the other pagan gods. It is interesting about the coincidences though. Perhaps it's a result of creation testifying about God? Don't know.     I've looked into the evidence about Christ's grave being empty and it looks very convincing to me. I haven't looked at the evidence for the pagan gods to compare.     The other parts are interesting, but they seem kind of far fetched with a lack of concrete evidence.

I belive Jesus might be separate - the trinity is pagan based.|`|vxzyYVeYaa	Matt. 26:39, RS: Going a little farther he [Jesus Christ] fell on his face and prayed, My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt.    [Jesus answered the Jewish Pharisees:] In your law it is written that the testimony of two men is true; I bear witness to myself, and the Father who sent me bears witness to me.    So when reading both of these scriptures, Jesus is one person, and then his father is another.    Another Scripture is Mark 13:32, RS: Of that day or that hour no ones knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. (Of course, that would not be the case if Father, Son, and Holy Spirit were coequal, comprising one Godhead.    Here is another good one John 14:28, RS: [Jesus said:] If you loved me, you would have rejoiced, because I go to the Father; for the Father is greater than I.

Then he suffered him.     16 And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:     17 And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.     Jesus goes with John the baptist to get baptized he is physically being baptized by john. Meanwhile the holy spirit is SEEN in the form of a dove. Meanwhile God says this is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased. Each part of the god head is present at this point and are quite seperate. If they were the same wouldn't he have said this is beloved me, I am well pleased in myself? Something to think about    Many like to point out that Jesus could have meant that he and god are one in purpose (the salvation of man). Others believe that the god of the old testament is jesus and the god of the new testament is God the father (the whole Jehovah/God the father etymology debate) To me it is all bs but interesting to debate.    Hope this helps  Keep thinking :)|`|WyICbuPqaa	The problem stems from a bad interpretation.  A better translation than   "I and my Father are one." (John 10:30) would be "I and my Father are united."    When Jesus was baptized, there was a voice from heaven, saying "This is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased." (Matthew 3:17)  After Jesus was resurrected, Stephen saw him standing next to God.  This is a case of people believing what they want to believe, the facts be damned.  People expect God to change the universe to support their versions of reality.    P.S. - Paul taught that the saints should be "Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;" (Ephesians 5:20)  It is obvious that he considered them to be separate beings.    It is also a weak argument to quote the verse in Galatians that says that God is one, since in that very same chapter Paul says that Jesus and his followers are "one" too.  It is clear that he isn't advocating that we are physically the same.  Again, he is saying that we are united.     "There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus. " (Galatians 3:28)    The fact that Jesus is eternal, or that he also has the title of Everasting Father, doesn't show that he himself is without a literal father.  Jesus really was the literal Son of God.|`|hR7OsqtRaa	In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"

There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27.

Right?      I've asked this question (or similar) more than a few times, and the basic answer that I get every time is that every different person has a different belief to what the trinity actually is. Somehow all three are separate, but are all a part of the one god, who himself is a third of the trinity. It doesn't really make sense, and it is one concept that causes a LOT of confusion.|`|macZI2dzaa	I fear you are trolling..... trolling.  But, Jesus is fully God, He is called God in Isaiah 9.6, John 1.1, 8.58, 20.28, Colossians 1.16,17 and Hebrews 1.7-10.    Truth is every time Jesus is called the Son of God, He is also effectively being called God.  In the ancient Middle East, as well as today, a son is never necessarily less than his father.  3 other times Jesus is called a son, of David, of Man and of Joseph.  No one can show that Jesus is anything but greater than all three.|`|AA10096992	Absolutely.

We Catholics do not worship Mary or the Saints or Statues or the Crucifix. We honor Mary for saying "Yes" to God's Will that she be the Mother of God. Likewise we honor the saints for living their lives for God's Will and not Man's will. We ask Mary and the saints to pray for us in our time of need just like we ask our family and friends here on Earth to pray for us. To pray isn't just to worship it also means to ask or request. Worship is for God and God alone.|`|AA10239241	You are quite misinformed.  We have them in our churches and homes but we do not worship them!  I know of born-again Assembly of God people and others who put up Christmas mangers with statues in them...they do not worship the statues...neither do we Catholics worship them.  One AoG member that I know keeps her statue of the Christ Child in his manger in full view year around.  She packs up the angels, sheppards, wise men, etc. but keeps Baby Jesus out on her desk.  She's quick to tell me to "take Jesus off that cross because he is risen" and so I tell her to put away the baby Jesus because he grew up!  Its the same exact argument.    As for Mary and the saints, they are among the "cloud of witnesses" that I happen to admire.  See HEB 12:1.  As for the crucifix, Paul says that "we preached Christ crucified..." (1 Cor. 1:23).  He purposely does not say that we preach Christ resurrected -- even though, of course, he is!  In fact, Paul also tells us that we are called to be joint heirs with Christ IF ONLY we suffer with him!  That's pretty strong language but it is what Paul insisted upon.  See Romans 8:17.    Incidentally, it was a Catholic saint -- Francis of Assisi -- that began the tradition of putting up manger scenes.|`|hvNqywbBaa	They are NOT WORSHIPED !    In Scripture, the term "worship" was similarly broad in meaning, but in the early Christian centuries, theologians began to differentiate between different types of honor in order to make more clear which is due to God and which is not.     As the terminology of Christian theology developed, the Greek term latria came to be used to refer to the honor that is due to God alone, and the term dulia came to refer to the honor that is due to human beings, especially those who lived and died in Gods friendshipin other words, the saints. Scripture indicates that honor is due to these individuals (Matt. 10:41b). A special term was coined to refer to the special honor given to the Virgin Mary, who bore JesusGod in the fleshin her womb. This term, hyperdulia (huper [more than]+ dulia = "beyond dulia"), indicates that the honor due to her as Christs own Mother is more than the dulia given to other saints. It is greater in degree, but still of the same kind. However, since Mary is a finite creature, the honor she is due is fundamentally different in kind from the latria owed to the infinite Creator.     People who do not know better sometimes say that Catholics worship statues. Not only is this untrue, it is even untrue that Catholics honor statues. After all, a statue is nothing but a carved block of marble or a chunk of plaster, and no one gives honor to marble yet unquarried or to plaster still in the mixing bowl.     The fact that someone kneels before a statue to pray does not mean that he is praying to the statue, just as the fact that someone kneels with a Bible in his hands to pray does not mean that he is worshiping the Bible. Statues or paintings or other artistic devices are used to recall to the mind the person or thing depicted. Just as it is easier to remember ones mother by looking at her photograph, so it is easier to recall the lives of the saints by looking at representations of them.     This question is brought up sooooo many times....and then, answered and explained, that when I see it continue, it just shows  ignorance  with a judgemental tone.    Shouldn't your focus be on worshiping God?  .........like us Catholics do.    You know, if we were judgemental like you, wouldn't we be asking why do some Christians worship WORDS from Scripture?    Statues, a Crucifix  and other icons help us to see  as they inspire us to meditate on the specific divine realities they mean to convey just as the words we read in Scripture do.    Christian understanding of the consequences of this reality is evident from the beginning, as far back as the Catacombs, and two-dimensional painted icons, statues, and mosaics have always been used as aids to Christian worship.    Rene O:  Please read ALL of Revelation, instead of picking and choosing.  Rev. 1:4  this verse shows that angels (here, the seven spirits) give grace and peace. Because grace and peace only come from God, the angels are acting as mediators for God.   Rev. 5:8 - the prayers of the saints (on heaven and earth) are presented to God by the angels and saints in heaven. This shows that the saints intercede on our behalf before God, and it also demonstrates that our prayers on earth are united with their prayers in heaven. (The 24 elders are said to refer to the people of God  perhaps the 12 tribes and 12 apostles - and the four living creatures are said to refer to the angels.)   Rev. 6:9-11  the martyred saints in heaven cry out in a loud voice to God to avenge their blood on those who dwell upon the earth. These are imprecatory prayers, which are pleas for Gods judgment (see similar prayers in Psalm 35:1; 59:1-17; 139:19; Jer. 11:20; 15:15; 18:19; Zech.1:12-13). This means that the saints in heaven are praying for those on earth, and God answers their prayers (Rev. 8:1-5). We, therefore, ask for their intercession and protection.   Rev. 8:3-4  in heaven an angel mingles incense with the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar before the throne of God, and the smoke of the incense rose with the prayers of the saints from the hand of the angel before God. These prayers rise up before God and elicit various kinds of earthly activity. God responds to his childrens requests, whether made by his children on earth or in heaven.|`|AeQL0j3maa	i don't think its worship. statues of Mary and the saints are icons of your faith. like a good luck charm type of thing. like people have rabbit's feet, clover leaves. even lucky articles of clothing and days. and numbers. they don't worship their good luck charm.     and the crosses and crucifixes.   the Crucifix is to Remind you what Jesus did for us a constant reminder that he died for our sins. that he suffered many pains so that we might be saved from hell. (its the reason i think all forms of christianity should have one.)    The cross (w/o crucified Jesus) is to remind you that you have your own cross to bear. that life isn't easy. and it will never be easy. just as Jesus carried His Cross. We must carry ours. and its never easy for any one.    Christ suffered more in a few months than we will in and intire life time. The Crucifix Reminds us of that.   The Cross reminds us that we have our own Cross to bear.|`|7JIhZ0R0aa	So you still think Mary, the mother of God..........and the Cross of Our Lord are idols or graven images?    Hmmm, so: images of Mary and crosses are bad (whether they are truly "graven" or not); graven images of bears are OK, at least if you sell them for food; glass images of bears are most definitely OK, at least if given to you by your son. In fact all images -- even "graven" ones! -- seem to be OK unless they're Catholic or the Washington Monument (which probably is a Masonic thing).

Need that correction.    Scripture provides two examples  Nehustan and Gideon's Ephod     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nehushtan  King Hezekiah instituted a religious iconoclastic reform and destroyed the Nehustan (2 Kings 18:4). It is identified with the bronze snake mentioned in the biblical Book of Numbers, which was said to have been used by Moses to cure the Israelites from snake bites.[1]       Because the Lord was not present with Gideon's ephod, the ephod itself came to represent God and be worshiped (Judges 8:27)    Sin is in the Will, not in the wood.

At the time of ancient Israel it refer to the pagan gods like Bel of Babylon, Jupiter of Rome, Diana of Greece and Isis of Egypt,  Aseroth, Baal, Molech, etc. few examples  Commandment of God is: Ex 20:3 "Thou shalt not have strange gods before me."   Statute of Mother Mary and Cross are NOT idols as defined above. Catholics church {CC] do not worship them as God; they're being honored and venerated as God's very special messenger. Therefore it does not contravene Comm 3. Further, any biblical student knew that the Holy of the Holies has images of angelic cherubims and seraphims, the dove descending on Jesus's baptism, the serpent cross of Moses, the Holy Cross of Jesus, etc are images that represent God and His dominions.    So, idols = devil; holy images = God's dominion.|`|AA11707311	No one worships statues of Mary, or Crosses.  You seem to be misinformed.|`|iHDYncuXaa	There is no biblical teaching at all that states we are to pray to those who once were alive on earth and are now in heaven.  Revelation, the same book used by them to justify their position says the following:     "And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said to me, "Do not do that; I am a fellow servant of yours and your brethren who hold the testimony of Jesus; worship God. For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy," (Rev. 19:10).  John wants to bow the knee and worship the angel.  But the angel tells him not to do that because he is a fellow creature.  If the angel says that he is a fellow creature like John, and that John is not to bow to him, then neither should anyone else bow to an angel, or any creature so as to offer worship.  Worship includes prayer.  Therefore, no one should pray to any created thing.    Biblically, prayer is always offered to God, and is a form of worship.  All religions view prayer as an act of worship to their gods since they contain petitions, confession of sin, requests of intercession, etc., things which are received and answered by God, not by created things.  Also, prayer is not the same thing as talking to someone face-to-face.  Prayer is a humble petition to the Lord in and not to a friend who's in the same room with you or on the other end of the phone -- or in heaven.  Prayer is offered to God, never to any created thing.  To do so is to offer worship that should only be directed to God, which is idolatry.  Prayer should be offered only to God and the Roman Catholic Church needs to repent of its false and idolatrous practice of praying to the saints.|`|74b1131cf5ddd01a70564ef108e130bfaa	They aren't worshipped, so your question is moot.|`|kH6HL5smaa	An idol is something that a person worships.

e08zWhUjaa	Well lets put this all into perspective at least from my view - a person outside the relationship....    1. you are partnered for 14 years... this alone is a miracle considering most gay men usually just hang around till something better comes along... 14 years in gay life is like 30 in the hetero world  - so congrats.    2. Your partner wants to have a reminder of you and your commitment on his hand all the time.  He wants to let people know that hes taken... and hes yours... so he asks for rings... you on the other hand really don't want rings and cant wear one because it affects your work... not construction, not carpentry  or welding - but typing on a keyboard..    3. Your on a nice romantic vacation and you break down and buy the rings... he is thrilled,  you are unaffected....    4. He after finally getting this beautiful ring from you  after years of asking.. is just happy to have it puts it on and doesn't ever want to take it off.    5. you  both go swimming he loses it - you yell you scream you call him careless and tell him your returning yours and you don't ever care to have another...    hmmm.....im trying to decide whether this guy has any reason to be hurt...... how you should of handled is to act as if someone you loved had  accidentally lost a ring...  deal is putting it all in perspective dont you think that after all this time of him begging for rings and being trilled to have them and then he loses his a few days later - that he has already ripped his own heart out about the situation? that he probably was saddened horribly by it..I mean after all they really meant something to at least him....then to find out that his partner of 14 years says HELL im selling my ring and dont even ask me again about getting another....    what you should do first is... evaluate your relationship.... do you really care about this guy?  are you in love with him?  have you just started to be jaded about the entire relationship and are taking for granted whats right in front of you... and hey if there is something wrong you should address it..     so after all that if you still want to make it up to him.. I would plan a really really special night out at a special restuarant.  I would buy 2 more rings and surprise him with them.. Tell him that you have taken a step back and realized that you didn't act the way you should have, you lost sight of how much he truly means to you and that more importantly it will be an honor to wear a ring that means that your his.... simple enough... hey i know i have been kind of harsh in this answer - i guess i just want you to realize that you have what thousands of people want to have.  why not do a little something extra to make it even better... best of luck...|`|AIuN5Lw9aa	Whoa. Talk about drama!    I know how you feel about the jewelry. I sometimes take my engagement ring off and my husband gets upset with me. (We haven't bought our wedding rings yet, but we are married.) It just annoys me.    I feel bad for ur partner; the poor guy prob WAS hurt. But all couples have these sorts of arguments. Forgive him, go kiss and make-up - life is tooooo short.

He probably just didn't realize it wouldn't stay on when he was in the water.  Perhaps you should apologize and the two of you should discuss why it mattered so much and what you should do about it now.  I understand the symbolism of the ring, but if he didn't lose it intentionally (and if he loves you I'm sure it wasn't intentional) then you need to address the issue before it festers into a relationship ending monster wound.|`|N73oZyY8aa	Maybe you should each choose a nipple and have a ring pierced through there, so you can't lose it and it won't bother your keyboard time.|`|Dkylapi6aa	this happens all the time whether in straight or gay couples.

Hope it goes well!|`|gpQm5ZPpaa	Yeah, I understand your side of it, but I understand why he's upset as well.

That'd make him VERY happy.|`|0DnVKwIeaa	Uhhh, quit being a dick and go buy a new set.....for both of you.He didn't lose it on purpose, and really, they aren't that expensive. You should be glad that he wants to display a high level of commitment to you.     This time he should get a smaller size of ring...they shouldn't come off that easily.    As for you not wanting to wear yours using the keyboard...try a smaller width if it gets in the way, but really, after wearing your ring for a while, you don't even notice it and it won't get in the way...|`|f4lTQpG4aa	I think u have to remember that he means more to you than a piece of mettle. The reason you bought the rings was as a show of your love for one another and commitment.     Perhaps you could buy another pair of rings, this time even place your on a chain around your neck, that way it would not get in your way but you would still have it. Just make sure to explain why the chain to your lover.

I also pray for him every single day since he does not know the Lord .He lives about 5 miles away and I am going to check on him to see how he is doing as soon as I stop typing this.   I have prayed for him everysingle day for over 3 years. Please, my brothers and sisters , pray for Vic also. He needs to come to Christ.

The Bible writers created the story of the Jewish God that is worshipped by gullible Christians mainly in America. This God forced the Jews to eat their own children for dinner NOT AS A PUNISHMENT, but as an option in times of famine. Not even as an option, but as the WILL OF GOD! God NEVER objected about slaughtering and cooking children for dinner. God wont let the Jews eat pigs, but children YES! The Christians always cover up anything negative about the Bible God! I dropped out of Christianity and religion after many years serving in the Christian ministry! A preacher has to be very dishonest not to admit any of these facts! The Bible was written to control low IQ religious people who need a crutch to function in this world. Any religion back then was as savage as you cant possibly imagine. The Bible is a hangover from those days... Rather recently America became officially ONE NATION UNDER GOD and IN GOD WE TRUST under Christian pressure after the collapse of the US gold monetary system!     This Bible God is totally powerless to teach any lesson without FORCING the Jews to eat their own children for dinner. The Bible writers say that Palestine was a Land Flowing with Milk and Honey ONLY before the Israelite invasion. The former dwellers used to live in plenty! After the invasion (SURPRISE!!!) suddenly the milk and honey stopped flowing! So now the Bible writers are promising that God will make the desert (Israel) blossom like a rose! The perennial carrot hanging at the end of the stick is working!    Gods sadistic pleasures are the kinkiest ones ever to be imagined! None of the Godless dictators in the world EVER thought of forcing his people to eat their own children for dinner...! That is so repulsive that no smut publication is publishing anything like that either, but any pervert can enjoy reading all about it in the Holy Bible! The rest of Christians are totally brainwashed with the GOD IS LOVE bit! No wonder the Clergy hid the Bible from public view for so many centuries! To their great relief hardly any Christian today pays attention to what they read in the Bible!     Leviticus 26:29 - (God is impatiently saying) YOU WILL eat the flesh of your sons and the flesh of your daughters* (*without warning of any evil! Christians are trained to believe that no matter how pervert it may sound if God says it I believe it and that settles it!)    Deuteronomy 28:53-57 - Because of the suffering that your enemy will inflict on you during the siege* (*God is conditioning the mind of the Israelites 700 Bible years into the future! In our society today anybody promoting the idea of any crime like that is put in jail!), YOU WILL EAT THE FRUIT OF THE WOMB, THE FLESH OF THE SONS AND DAUGHTERS the LORD your God has given you* (*God WILL NOT do anything to protect the innocent children, but his chosen people will enjoy eating them! Praise the LORD! Sweet Jesus Amen?) Even the most gentle and sensitive man* (*not a sinful homosexual or a Godless atheist, but a CHOSEN CHILD OF GOD!) among you will have no compassion on his own brother or the wife he loves or his SURVIVING children, and he will not give to one of them any of the flesh of his children that he is eating* (*according to the Bible writers, not sharing is THE SIN! Only religious perverts can dream on feeding on their own children for ever!)    Jeremiah 19:9 I* (*God, NOT SATAN, but GOD!) WILL MAKE THEM EAT THE FLESH OF THEIR SONS AND DAUGHTERS* (This sick God has to FORCE the Jews to eat their own children! During the real historic Roman siege of Masada [do Google] all the Jewish families killed themselves before even dreaming about eating their own children!)    God wont force the Jews to eat PIGS, but their own children YES! The Bible writers say that when the 666 mark will be instituted Christians wont be able to buy or sell food without it. Based on Bible precedents, will the heart bleeding Christians of the Westboro orientation eat their own children for dinner? Christians would deny it or say that if God forced the Jews to do it, it was because they were very sinful!    Ezekiel 5:10 - Therefore in your midst fathers WILL EAT THEIR CHILDREN...    Any secular government would offer its citizens better protection than the Bible God. They would certainly allow them to eat pork instead of children! It took Moses 2 men to carry a single bunch of gigantic size grapes to show Israel how plentiful was the Land of Palestine that they were going to invade (Num 13:23)! Actually that was just another trick in the Bible script to motivate well fed Jews into COVETING* (*the heck with the 10 Commands!) to leave Egypt and to invade the Holy Land. (BTW, there is not a shred of historical evidence that millions of slave Jews ever lived in Egypt or that they ever ate their children!) Now the Jews can eat their own children in the Holy Land for Gods kinky pleasure! Actually, for the pleasure of wanking Bible writers and some freaky Bible readers today!    Lamentations 4:10 - With their own hands COMPASSIONATE WOMEN* (*GODLY WOMEN! Not lesbians or atheistic ladies, but MANY God loving heterosexual ladies) HAVE COOKED THEIR OWN CHILDREN...!    Here is a case in FULL EXPLICIT CONTEXT in the Bible that is IMPOSSIBLE for any Preacher to spiritualize and make it go away!    2 Kings 6:26-29 As the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried to him, Help me, my lord the king* (*a God related King)! The king replied, If the Lord does not help you, where can I get help for you? Then he asked her, What's the matter? She answered, This woman said to me, Give up your son so we may eat him today, and tomorrow we'll eat my son. So we cooked my son and ate him* (*BTW it came out delicious!!!).

I offered her a safe place to stay in my garage and she wanted to know if I would let her boyfriend stay there too, and if she could have some money to buy beer and drugs.

Present day muslims are generally far more tolerant and moderate than those of Muhammad's time.  They also accept Islam more uncritically than the Muslims of muhammad's time.  Most of the Muslims of Muhammad's time accepted Islam expeditiously, either to go with the flow, or as a vehicle to tap into the flow of riches that was pouring into Mecca through aggressive conquest.  INdeed, shortly after the capture of mecca, Ansari Muslims protested vehemently to Muhammad (and roughed him up a little) that the new meccan muslims were getting a greater share of booty from raids.  Muhammad's reply wasthat the greater share was necessary because their faith wasn't as strong.    Examining Islamic history, the Muslims today that best represent the muslims of the time of the prophet are the Wahhabis.  If this upsets you, then re-examine your history.    A couple of points on that article:  Mecca was not a trade center on the way to anywhere.  It was a terminus for a trade route, totally insignificant in the overall scene of trade in the 7th century.  See http://calculatedrisk.blogtownhall.com/2...    Islam did not spread to India and south Asia through trade connections, it was exported by conquest and force, killing 80 million Hindus who refused to submit.

God turned Moses' rod into a serpent, but Moses was still scared, and said: "I am not elequent, I am slow of speech and slow of tongue."  The Lord continued to tell Him: "Who has made this man's mouth? Who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing? Have not I the Lord? Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say."  Moses still continued to beg the Lord to let someone else do it..but the Lord wanted Moses.

As human beings we are given a consciousness and a duty that has placed us at the top to creation. Man is created to be God's deputy on earth and it is important to realize the obligation to rid ourselves of all illusions and to make our lives a preparation for the next life. Anyone who misses this chance is not likely to be given another, to be brought back again, for it says in the Qur'an Majeed that when man is brought to account, he will say, "O Lord, send us back and give us another chance.' The Lord will say, 'If I send you back, you will do the same.'    My early religious upbringing    I was brought up in the modern world of all the luxury and the highlight of show business. I was born into a Christian home.     We know that every child is born in his original nature, and it is only his parents that turn him to this religion or that. I was given this religion (Christianity) and thought this way. I was taught that God exists, but there was no direct contact with God, so we had to make contact with Him through Jesus, and Jesus was in fact the door to Good. This was more or less accepted by me, but I did not swallow it all.    I looked at some of the statues of Jesus; they were just stones with no life. When they said that God is three, I was puzzled even more but could not argue. I believed it, simply because I had to have respect for the faith of my parents.    Pop star    Gradually, I became alienated from this religious upbringing, and started making music. I wanted to be a big star. All those things I saw in the films and on the media took h old of me, and perhaps I thought this wa my god: the goal of making money. I had an uncle who had a beautiful car, and I thought "Well, he has it made". He had a lot of money. The people around me influence me tho think that this was it, this world was their God.    I decided then that this was the life for me, to make a lot of money, to have a 'great life'. My examples were the pop stars, and so I started making songs. But deep down, I had a feeling for humanity, a feeling that if I became rich, I would help the needy. (It says in the Qur'an that we make a promise, but when we make something, we want to hold on to it and become greedy)    So it happened that I became very famous, as a teenager, and my name and photo were splashed in all the media. They made me larger than life, so I wanted to live larger than life, and the only way to do that was to be intoxicated (with liquor and drugs).    In Hospital    After a year of financial success and 'high' living, I became very ill, contracted TB and had to be hospitalized. It was then that I started to think: what was to happen to me? Was I just a body and my goal in life was merely to satisfy this body? I realized now that this calamity was a blessing given to me by Allah, a chance to open my eyes, 'why am I here, why am I in bed', and I started looking for some of the answers. At that time there was great interest in great interest in the Eastern mysticism. I began reading and the first thing I began to become aware of was of death, and that the soul moves on, it does not stop. I felt I was taking the road to bliss and high accomplishment. I started meditating and even became a vegetarian. I now believed in 'peace and flower power', and this was the general trend. But what I did believe in particular was that I was not just a body, this awareness came to me at the hospital.    One day when I was walking and I was caught in the rain, I began running to the shelter and I realized, 'wait a minute, my body is getting wet, my body is telling me I am getting wet.' This made me think of a saying that the body is like a donkey and it has to be trained where it has to go, otherwise the donkey will lead you where it wants to go.     .............http://www.islamawareness.net/Converts/y...
wxBFZ41Taa	It's easy to judge in hindsight...have you ever heard hindsight is 20/20? Everyone knows what they would have done, given the knowledge they have now. But those who lived at the times these things went on did not have that advantage.     The Spanish Inquisition, which I assume you refer to, was not Church run but State run. Ferdinand and Isabella, the king and queen of  Spain, took it upon themselves to run an Inquisition. They were actually told to "stop" by the pope. Isabella truly wanted to root out heresy, but Ferdinand was in it for money and profit. But whatever their purpose, neither had the sanction of the Catholic Church. They used the Church causes as their justification, but they were not doing so with the Church support.     It helps if you know a little more about what exactly went on, the society and culture of the times etc. All Christian people were Catholic at that time, also, Church law and civil law were one and the same. You could be tried and punished by the civil authorities for be a heretic. Many of the people deemed heretics asked, begged to be tried by the Church because the Church was easier on them and they were more likely to be allowed to live.     Also, during the Reformation, the Protestants killed, tortured, raped and burned many, many Catholics. You have to realize the time in which these things took place. A time in which public torture and execution were standard practice. People showed up with their families to see heretics or Catholics drawn and quartered. It was a more barbaric time, not just in the Church but in all of society.    http://www.geocities.com/capitolhill/323...  http://www.catholic.com/library/Inquisit...  http://socrates58.blogspot.com/2006/11/i...|`|D9lMg7A2aa	I don't usually defend such people, but you give no evidence of even knowing what those people thought they were doing -- and it wasn't ONE thing that they all thought they were doing.|`|bmhnXEsVaa	It was the Dark Ages.

The Crusades.  The Inquisition.  Witch trials in Europe and America.  The Divine right of Kings (valid until killed by another Divinely-appointed King).  Missionaries destroying/converting smaller, "heathen" religions and cultures.  Missionaries such as Mother Teresa.  The demonization of other religions, e.g. Christianity demonizing Pagans ("They're devil-worshippers!"), the Romans demonizing Christians ("They're atheists and cannibals!").  Persecution of Heretics - e.g. Galileo for daring to suggest that the Earth orbits the Sun.  Children dying because their parents refused them medical treatment on religious grounds; relying instead on faith-healers and prayer.  Slavery, supposedly supported by scripture ("Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, just as you would obey Christ.", St.Paul, Ephesians 6:5)  Holy wars - followers of different faiths (or even the same faith) killing each other in the name of their (benevolent, loving and merciful) gods.  The destruction of great works of art considered to be pornographic/blasphemous, and the persecution of the artists.  Censorship (often destructive) of speech, art, books, music, films, poetry, songs and, if possible, thought.  Persecution/punishment of blasphemers (Salman Rushdie still has a death sentence on him), and blasphemy laws in general.  The requirement of theism in order to stand for public office or to testify in court.  Serial killers believing they are doing the work of Satan (or sometimes Jesus).  Often-fatal exorcisms by priests believing they are destroying the work of Satan.  People suffering dreadful injury or death in the belief that their faith has made them invulnerable (e.g. people climbing into lion enclosures at zoos, with a Bible as protection).  Whole societies divided by minor differences in belief or doctrine, often resulting in violence.  Mass suicides of cult-members following a charismatic leader who believes the world is about to End  The attempted genocide of followers of a particular faith (e.g. the Jewish Holocaust, "ethnic cleansing" in former Yugoslavia).  Blood sacrifices to appease the Gods, or to ensure a good harvest. (The Aztecs made daily human sacrifices to ensure that the Sun would rise. Or did they? )  The practice of "female circumcision" (more accurately termed genital mutilation).  The discouragement of rational, critical thought (resulting in young-earth creationists, for example).  Uncontrolled population growth caused (or at least helped) by churches prohibiting birth-control and abortion. (You can also add : unwanted pregnancies, ill-fated forced marriages, and pregnant teenagers condemned to a life in mental institutions to avoid embarrassing their families.)  The spread of sexually transmitted diseases (e.g. AIDS) due to churches prohibiting the use of condoms.  Believers whipping, impaling, poisoning or crucifying themselves during religious festivals as a demonstration of their faith and piety.  Suicide bombers taught to believe that martyrs go straight to Paradise.  The indoctrination of children into the religion of their parents, giving them an arbitrary, life-long belief that is almost entirely dependent on their place of birth.  Women treated as second-class citizens or even slaves  Pentecostal snake-handlers  Persecution of homosexuals  Abuse of power, authority and trust by religious leaders (for financial gain or sexual abuse of followers and even children).|`|xWi4ua0Iaa	The idealistic will justify any behavior necessary to advance their beliefs - regardless if their beliefs are naive and nonsensical and superstitious.|`|Zzhgpe0Paa	Sinful man using religion as an excuse to do that which God says is evil.

Only churches would be allowed to read from the text, and before the printing press there weren't any copies of it for people to get their hands on.    In other words, this is an environment rife with abuse, none of which is obviously from God.    God bless you.

QIQNzE11aa	I don't know how many times i've had my hand shaken only to wonder if i had a broken bone afterwards. I doubt highly she was joking. I would bet it hurt as badly as she claimed. Many men do this and don't seem to have a clue. So much so that i often try to flip my hand now so they cannot get a grip and crack my bones.     You don't want a handshake that feels like a limp noodle either. I'd find a nice girl, who doesn't work on a farm, and ask to practice with her how hard or not hard to shake a woman's hand. Firm, but refined enough to not squeeze the bones together. Here's how to perform the perfect handshake. http://www.careerbuilder.com/Article/CB-...    You do want to perfect the handshake so that you never hurt a female again. Even men don't love their hands to be nearly broken just over a greeting. I actually chose to not go with one vendor as he shook my hand every time he got near to me and it hurt for hours afterwards. I didn't want to see him anymore and i dropped that company for that man's handshake. True story.|`|U4V6TkZEaa	Why are you so worried about it?

Also we sometimes have somewhat more delicate hands than men and yes, it can hurt. She is a ditz to have made such a big deal of it though. You could have embarrassed her by profusely and repeatedly apologizing, just as loudly and acting really upset that you wounded her so.|`|6f812b070bb6a7494447f70abb1119fdaa	Handshakes should be firm, but not gripping like you're about to Indian wrestle.  I think she was just being melodramatic.  Don't give a girl the "dead fish" unless she's extending more her fingers to you than her hand, and be aware that older people may have arthritis and that even a gentle one can hurt.  I don't think you did anything wrong.|`|00ad97897648101cc10f52e12966697daa	It depends.  I wear a couple of rings on each hand.  When I shake hands during the course of business or whatever, if someone grips my hand hard, it causes my rings to crush the inside of my knuckles on the adjacent finger.   It really hurts, try it.  It's best to grip lightly, but not so lightly that you feel like a dead fish.  It's something you may need to practice.      yes, shake hands lightly!|`|DF22BQ3yaa	Not supposed to.

There is joy in heaven over one sinner who repents...and if there was only ONE person who needed salvation, Jesus still would have gone through everything that He did to bring it about....    In John's gospel...Jesus said that no one can come to Him unless they are drawn to Him by His Father...and my paraphrase...and also in chap.18,  He told Pilate that who ever was of the TRUTH listens to Him....    1 COR. 1:18....The preaching of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing...but to those who are being saved, it is the power of God.    Those who hear the TRUTH and reject God's offer of salvation are with-out excuse.,...Creation itself witnesses to the world of God's existence and His Sovereignty throughout the universe....  Rom. 1.    We are called to be ambassadors of Christ. 2 Cor.5:20....God is urging  and imploring the world, through us, to be reconciled to Him.....    2 Cor. 4:3 --- Paul wrote, "But even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing.    Romans 10:14 --  "How then shall they call on Him in Whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe on Him of Whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher?    God's Word does not return unto Him void...but it accomplishes that for which He sent it....    When we speak and witness the Word of God and not our own thoughts or opinions, God will take care of the rest...  He will use His Word and the witness of the Holy Spirit in this world   reach those who can be reached....    What will be the end of those who obey not the gospel of God?    In Revelation 20:15, it says that whoever was not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the Lake of Fire....    Imagine what the great Apostle Paul could do if he could be here right now!!!! :-) And not only on ANSWERS, but on the Internet. period.   And then there is also the print and broadcast media that Paul could use......and you can be sure he wouldn't put up with any political corr-ectness garbage!!!    Keep in mind Jesus' parable on the Word of God and the four  different kinds of ground that it falls on....but for all who reject  God's Word and His mercy, it is worth more than ANYTHING to reach just 1 person....    Jesus told His disciples - and us - that the world cannot hate us, because it already hates Him.......and Paul wrote in galatians that if he was still trying to be popular among men, he would not be preaching the gospel.....    In Matt. 7, Jesus paints a picture of how most of the world's population will follow the broad path that leads to destruction and that there are only a few people who follow the way that leads to life.   Matt. 7:13-14. Very sad....    I remember hearing or reading somewhere that out of ALL of the people who have ever lived or will live, MOST of humanity  WILL sadly reject God and His mercy....

AA10246871	I am pretty certain that they did not use an Iron Maiden as we think of it now during the Inquisition. I think they came into being later. My reason for thinking that is that I remember there was a very famous one destroyed by Allied bombing during WWII. It was of German make, and was on display in a German city. (Go ahead and pick a city of your choice--most of Germany was reduced to rubble by Allied bombing.)    If they had used one during the Inquisition, and if it had had a human likeness on it, I would imagine it would have been of either the Virgin Mary or one of the female saints. Those wacky Inquisitors had a sense of humor, and would have probably reasoned (if we can call anything they did "reasoning") that having a holy image of some sort was going to make the tortured person repent and feel all holy and clean and lovey-dovey about their experience right before they expired. That's just a guess, though. Who knows what those wack-jobs where thinking?    **EDIT**  You clarified, so I will clarify. The Iron Maiden, at least around these here parts, bears the face of a woman called Gail Ruzicka. Try Googling her. Seriously--you'll get hits. She's very active here in Utah, and her message is one of hatred and intolerance for everything and everyone. She will take cheap shots at anything and everything from her glowy white marble pedestal, and the sickening thing is that there are actually a lot of people who swoon at that pedestal and want to elevate her to the status of a demi-goddess because of her vitriolic spew.    I think most communities have their own Iron Demon, be it male or female. I think if I thought of it long enough, I could come up with someone on the national or international stage who is as hate-filled as Ruzicka is, but she is just so hateful that I don't have time to spend hours trying to figure out who is uglier than she is.    And on a historical note, I checked with a friend who has a book about the history of torture. The Iron Maiden was not used during the "Holy Inquisition." (Yes, the historical one which is over with.) She made her debut later. They did have a variety of spiky things, but they preferred other methods. Interestingly, most maidens did not actually have faces on them. The inquisitor had to be able to hear what the poor tortured person was saying, so the face was generally left open. He said his book has drawings, woodcuts, and some photographs. (The one I mentioned which was destroyed during WWII was called the "Maiden of Nuremberg," which is kind of ironic on a variety of levels.) He said most of them show an iron band or other device to hold the forehead in place, and some of them have a funny device like spoons to go over the eyes and keep them shut, but most of them have an open face area so that the person could be heard clearly if they chose to speak. I know from what I have read that the confession was all-important during the Inquisition--there were usually several scribes in the room with the inquisitor at all times so that there was a fairly accurate record of what the person said. That would jibe with the no face thing, because a person who is slowly bleeding to death usually cannot speak at a healthy volume, and the inquisitor would need to be able to get really close to them to hear what they were saying. I can only hope that at least one of them heard a weak but clear, "Go to hell," and nothing else.    And do google Gail. See what she's up to. Find out why so many people around here think she's a very ugly person.|`|AA11562077	Donald Rumsfeld?    Actually, the "cleansing of souls" by putting people to death was the explanation for the inhuman treatment, both then and in later witchhunts where burning at the stake was the preferred method.    I recall seeing a poster for a movie about that era in Paris -- historically accurate I would guess, which showed someone engulfed in flames on the pyre, while a priest stood beside holding a cross (safely at the end of a long stick) so that the body's smoke passed over it "on the way to Heaven".

y8yLVQJnaa	Interesting stuff!  I guess it doesn't necessarily mean probably as far as evidence for LDS, but is still good stuff.    I noticed some brought up suicide rate and anti-depressants.  This is what I found out about them:    According to these "same statistics" as far as 2004, from the American Association of Suicidology, all of the states in the Intermountain United States are ranked in the top 11 for suicide.  Utah ranks 9th, and is the 2nd least likely to have suicide out of all the Intermountain States.  If something about Utah being Mormon truly resulted in suicide, then we'd reasonably expect Utah to still commit a lot of suicides even after controlling for simple factors like being in the Rocky Mountains.  Since it then ranks as not being so big on suicide after that, it seems reasonable that something else has to do with its suicides (maybe what causes all of the other Mountain Time Zone States to commit suicide).  Since many who accuse Mormons are those from the Bible Belt States, those same statistics say that most of the Bible Belt States make it into the top half of states for committing suicide.    http://en.fairmormon.org/Suicide_rate_am...    Below is a good scholarly reference:    John L. McIntosh, "Rate, Number, and Ranking of Suicide for Each U.S.A. State*, 2004," American Association of Suicidology  http://www.suicidology.org/associations/...    Utah being high for anti-depressant use also "doesn't necessarily" mean it has to do with Mormons http://en.fairmormon.org/LDS_use_of_anti...|`|AA10031161	There are a number of answers that state that Utah also has a very high rate of depression and medicated depression.    Here's my theory on that.    Because the LDS church teaches that we are here to find happiness, we're more likely to think that depression is a problem, we're more likely to go to a doctor about it.    In addition, because the Word of Wisdom, we're probably also less likely to self-medicate through OTC medications found at the pharmacy and those "medicines" found at the State Liquor Store.    As for these statistics, Chances are that you're probably right, but at the same time, this info was found on Wikipedia, which is a somewhat unreliable source. Anyone who wants to can go on and edit/change/post what they want to.... kinda like here on Y!A.|`|cTUAB7nraa	Find a better source than wikipedia, but I'm not surprised.|`|d093427de5232cf50f9f2c8bdeb9cd70aa	I don't know, but Utah also has the lowest abortion rate in the country as well as one of the lowest teen pregnancy rates. Thumbs up for us!|`|DVDYDaVSaa	Utah also has one of the highest rates of bankruptcy and prescription drug abuse (oh, and antidepressant use as well).  If you want the high mormon population credited with the good, you have to accept the possible blame for the bad as well.    BTW, the FAIR site is not an unbiased source of info on this (run by the LDS church).      Thanks for the laugh, Falisrm--you're always a hoot!|`|WNWKDw4uaa	Mormons rock!  Utah rules.

They also have a way higher birth rate, suicide rate and depression rate.    But to tell you the truth, I don't care about community service.|`|i3lXJbtFaa	Wikipedia is not a primary source.    Also, these statistics are generally based on the assumption that tithing to a church counts as "charity". But since churches do little more than help their own members, it is really more like participation in a coop than genuine charity.    Same for your "voluntarism" thing. Mormons came out in force "volunteering" to rob same-sex couples of their right to marry in California, but that is hardly the same as benevolent acts like feeding the homeless or restoring wildlife habitat.|`|ZtEVlc0yaa	"It also ranks highest for the rate of suicide and anti-depressant prescriptions, so don't read too much into it."

So are the psychiatrists breaking their code of ethics and speaking about their patients or are the drug companies biting the hand that feeds them.  Either way neither could talk without ruining their practice.    So I find it odd that people believe the depression notion, and I also find it odd that after reading about people giving away to charity the first though of others seems to be "ya, but those people are depressed".    That's both irrelevant and illogical.|`|8Ak1FehYaa	sorry, but depression, I can say I was definately one of those suicidal mormon.|`|0qhRIKpSaa	Tithing is the reason for the high charitable donations. Tithing is considered a charitable contribution by the IRS. What does the tithing money go to? Church buildings, temples, nothing that actually helps the poor or those in need. That's what fast offerings are for. Fast offerings are also considered a donation, but the majority of contributions come from tithing.   I don't know if church work is also considered volunteering. I think the IRS does consider it to be, but I don't know about this corporation. LDS church work actually does a lot to help out the members of their own congregation. So, good job mormons.|`|P5ZkSjyQaa	Charity and volunteerism is the payment for the magic underwear.

Regarding the second, it depends on if the statistics are counting the 2-year missions that many Mormons do.

AA10024451	Boy are you an ignorant one, aren't you?     Saying "agape" simply means "Christian love", as in when you'd close a letter or an email to someone.|`|4hsl2toNaa	What Greek word did Paul use at 1?Corinthians 13:13, where he mentioned faith, hope, and love and said that the greatest of these is love? Here the word is a?gape, the same one that the apostle John used when he said: God is love. (1?John 4:8,?16) This is a love guided or governed by principle. It may or may not include affection and fondness, but it is an unselfish emotion or feeling concerned with doing good to others regardless of the merits of the recipient or of any benefits accruing to the giver. Love of this kind caused God to give the dearest treasure of his heart, his only-begotten Son, Jesus Christ, in order that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life. (John 3:16) As Paul so well reminds us: Hardly will anyone die for a righteous man; indeed, for the good man, perhaps, someone even dares to die. But God recommends his own love to us in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. (Romans 5:7,?8) Yes, a?gape does good to others regardless of their status in life or the cost to the one expressing the love.  We had a study on this subject a while back.  Was very interesting, enlightening.|`|AA11536715	I don't know, but agape is a Greek word that means a type of love that is unconditional.  P.S. Agape is not brotherly love - that is phileos (spelling might be wrong). Phileos is the root of "Philadelphia", the city of brotherly love.|`|NWcBNAgdaa	If I understand it correctly, they are using the Greek word Agape (love) instead of the other Greek word for love which is eros. Eros is physical love, agape is spiritual or 'brotherly' love. I guess they're using the word to make a point.|`|AA11025703	Agape, is a form of love.    Agape.org is presumably a Website, which until this question, I doubt I'd ever even read of it.    2 Very different things.    I surmise that you are trying to raise awareness for said site, or simply trying to make a joke, either way your effort has been in vain.|`|EsvJ9ji3aa	its a kind of love  it's greek from the bible here's what i found besides in our info on the JW official website watchtower.org (i couldn't find it on our website we have info on it but not on the computer)  Agap (IPA: /??g?pi?/[1]) (Mod.Gk. ? [a??a.pi]) (Ke. ? IPA: [a?ga.p?]), is one of several Greek words translated into English as love. The word has been used in different ways by a variety of contemporary and ancient sources, including Biblical authors. Many have thought that this word represents divine, unconditional, self-sacrificing, active, volitional, and thoughtful love. Greek philosophers at the time of Plato and other ancient authors have used forms of the word to denote love of a spouse or family, or affection for a particular activity, in contrast to philiaan affection that could denote either brotherhood or generally non-sexual affection, and eros, an affection of a sexual nature. The term 'agape' is rarely used in ancient manuscripts, but was used by the early Christians to refer to the self-sacrificing love of God for humanity, which they were committed to reciprocating and practicing towards God and among one another (also see kenosis).  Agape has been expounded on by many Christian writers in a specifically Christian context. Thomas Jay Oord has defined agape as "an intentional response to promote well-being when responding to that which has generated ill-being." Oord also argues that agape is not the only form of Christian love. Philia and eros can also be forms of love appropriate for Christians to express.|`|9Dq2176oaa	Well Agape.org was never publicized.     Agape refers to love that is guided by principle. So it is more than just an emotional response to another person. It is broader in scope, more thoughtful and deliberate in its basis. Above all, agape is utterly unselfish.

The number itself does not bring bad luck; if it did, then you'd have back luck for having it in your question!    666 is the number of the beast (not its mark), and the mark is something different. (See Revelation 13, especially versus 17,18)    The number of the beast (666) is just one of 19 clues that help you identify who the beast of Revelation 13 is. Once you have all 19 clues, you will know beyond any shadow of a doubt who the beast is, and also what his mark is.    Do a word study on the word "worship" or any derivative (worshiped, worships, etc). Get an exhaustive concordance, and make a list of all scriptures in the Bible that has any of these words, and study those verses. Also study Daniel chapter 3.    When you read Revelation chapters 12 and 14, you will see that they talk a lot about a certain topic, and chapter 13 is right in the middle between them. Chapters 12 and 14 are like book ends to the topic of chapter 13.    When you study this, you will know what the mark of the beast issue is all about.    The mark of the beast is not a chip implant, it is not a supercomputer somewhere, it is not a bar code, or any of the other fanciful or sensationalistic ideas you hear out there.|`|jj9G0BBraa	It makes no difference one way or another.Trust me, if you have it just keep it...It's just a number.I know its religious significance, but until they try to put it on you, don't worry about it.|`|k7FD3rt5aa	No, not bad luck.

For I would not have known covetousness unless the law had said,  You shall not covet.    James 1:22-25 - But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man observing his natural face in a mirror; for he observes himself, goes away, and immediately forgets what kind of man he was. But he who looks into the perfect law of liberty and continues in it, and is not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work, this one will be blessed in what he does.

The Song of God not only redefine sin and evil, but also what it means to be human.  This new definition frees people from the constraints of perfectionism, judgment, shame, guilt, and control through moral tyranny.      Sin is considered to be acts of inhumanity.  This understanding of sin separates acts of inhumanity from that of imprudence and vice.  Many religions consider acts of imprudence and the natural drives of humans to be sinful and punishable by God.  This imposes a standard and culture that puts the religion in the power position of judgment, while the followers find themselves trying to live up to unattainable standards that imprison them by their very nature (i.e. their humanity).   Many behaviors that are considered to be sinful by other religions such as homosexuality, masturbation, and nudity are not only free of sin, but are natural responses to the persons environment, genetic structure, and nature of humanity.      God celebrates the nature of humanity while also differentiating between acts of prudence and sin.  Smoking, drinking, lying, stealing, promiscuity, taking Gods name in vain, etc. are acts of imprudence, vice, and personal impediment that can only be sinful within the degrees of inhumanity.  Some of the above could meet the definition of sin if it was consciously done to significantly harm other human beings.  For example:  Stealing and lying are destructive behaviors but they are not sin, unless it is done to consciously create acts of inhumanity.

Adorn yourself with jewelry and other fashion accessories.    * Propose your partner and tell her/him how special and important he is for you and that it is difficult to imagine your life without them.    * Hold each other's hands and go for a short walk.    * Appreciate each other and read out romantic poems for your lover.|`|22Gba6Cdaa	I say a great experience can always be a far better gift than a little trinket. Remember if its the thought that counts you can put much more into a day spent together having fun. Do something unique like a treasure hunt that eventually leads to a box of chocolates and a note explaining how you are happy to have found this person like they have found the chocolates. Depending on the time you would like to put into it you could spread it across town or just in your own apartment / house etc. Something like that can create memories that last a life time and cost next to nothing.
XEBpv9gwaa	This isn't likely what you'll want to hear, but you should let him choose his own spiritual path even if it doesn't match yours.  Then the two of you ideally would support each other in your respective religious choices.  You will have challenges ahead, such as how to raise the children, but I would suggest that they experience what both of their parents believe.  Many men spend their weekends golfing or sitting on the sofa watching sports, yours is choosing something else and it is a lot of time but its probably not worse than other things he could be doing.  Since you are not married, you still have the option of seeking a different partner if you cannot accept his spiritual choices.  He may not be matching what you always dreamed of, but that is really your issue, not his.  Good luck.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Unlike your other respondent, who fights to make sure religion tears people apart...I would only say that  I would be surprised if he acts this way ONLY with regard to religion. Your other respondent finds that normal, it isn't.|`|C1SOqQSkaa	Religion has an existing record of tearing things apart going back thousands of years.    Sometimes, the things are people's bodies.
QIQNzE11aa	Not better than before. When you make it far enough in an interview, most will be shown around the office. Gives a chance to ask the other employee's what they think... the feeling they get off of you.|`|dST3XrkNaa	Yes, if he is positive then ONly he would spend that much time to take you around. Enough of inquiry he would have done in your interview, so no need to do further by taking you around....    There would be many more in queue for interview, if he is not interested in you, why to waste time on you?|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	No, don't read into it, I had that many times and didn't even get a rejection call.|`|rThIVk2maa	Don't read into it, they're giving you a chance to see if you like the workplace. Did the employees there look happy? Were their desks bare and empty or did they have photos and fun things out? This is your chance to look around and decide if you want to work there or not.|`|FcZU29W6aa	I think that is a very good sign.  If he was not interested in hiring you, he would not have done that.  However, you may be one of three or four people, so it is not a guarantee.    I once applied for a job that I really wanted.  So, the next day (after the interview), I called the person and said I just wanted to let them know that I had been thinking about the job and knew that it was what I wanted and that I wanted to let them know that I was very interested and felt I would be an excellent employee for that job.    Well, I got the job and my boss and I worked great together.  After I was there for about a year we were talking about him hiring me.  He said that 44 people applied for the job and he chose me because of that phone call.  I had made it to the top ten, but he said that phone call clinched it.  So, call your interviewer right now.  Good luck.  Let us know what happens.|`|xnsU60hhaa	It only means that you are in the final running. Make sure you send out thank you letters and follow up with a phone call.  Good Luck!|`|DF22BQ3yaa	Yes, it happened to me and I got the job. Plus I sent thank you cards to them via postal mail the same day after the interview.|`|f48d10d4bec5b5e25f9894010aed2c69aa	think people think....what do you think???? geesh|`|b2CxzUmwaa	most likely but they could be seeing how you react to others or how others react to you|`|pUUyYz4gaa	No...it is not.  It is usually a test to see how people act in an office setting, and is usually a normal procedure for someone who is being considered.      If you weren't being considered, then you wouldn't have had a tour.     You may be in the running.|`|jCMSybAnaa	It's a pretty good sign that they think you are perfect for the job, but you may be in a small pool of good candidates.  If they didn't think you were great however, they would have shown you the door after the interview and told you that they will call you or something.  Final decisions are being made, so be sure to follow up with a thank you letter right away.  This could make a big difference.  Best wishes.

DfDss68haa	I really hope you are a troll and there aren't people this stupid. You are aware many Cubans are black or mixed with black right? Latino is not a race, it is a culture. Latinos can be black, white, native american, asians, mixed etc.     In fact many Afro Latinos have contributed to Cuban society and influenced the words, dress, music, foods, and lifestyle. You are likely mixed with African or the native people of Cuba somewhere in your family tree, Neither of which are European. And even if you are completely European descended (unlikely if your family has been in Cuba or the US for a long time) that does not mean you have to put yourself in a little box labeled white.    White people are diverse socially, ethnically, politically, linguistically, physically, culturally, etc. Pull your head out of your butt son.    EDIT: Troll, Republican. Same diff. lol|`|GxV4jGKMaa	Why do you want to be white?  White people are republican, democrat, communist and all parties.  They are all religions, all economic levels, etc.  Just be yourself and be happy.  Be proud that you're Cuban.|`|URHkLqeKaa	I am Cuban also, but you sound like a real immature, insecure person. Are you just trying to antagonize people with your sweeping generalizations and stereotypes? People like you are one of the reasons I hate Miami. Oh and by the way, how does a Black person refuse to become white? I didn't realize there was a choice involved.|`|2gyJUTzRaa	wow this is the dumbest question i've read all day...    so, you're racist against blacks because "black people refuse to become white and still consider themselves black"  LOL...well, i'm white and refuse to change my race too, mainly due to the fact that it's physically impossible.    and if you're latino, you're not white...you're latino.    "we are republicans like all white people!"  LOL that one just made my day|`|tJeS4SZCaa	in my opinion?

Not everything people tell you is true. How about you go make some black and white friends and you'll see we're not as bad as people say.|`|PvPPivLJaa	Yea you're wrong, but you can think how you want. There are just as many people who don't like Cubans so I think we're all even...|`|bFfdbWk2aa	All that i can say is wow    you don't like black people because they are not cuban     hmm    how can black people become white if they are black this just makes no sense honestly i don't get what your trying to say bottom line on how i see it    if your white your white    if your black your black    if your hispanic your hispanic     you can't become what your not.     race does not determine who you are in life     seems like your just using it as a clutch     What is the point in being racist it won't solve your problem and i still can't tell what your problem is     your mad because your not white? and won't be accepted as white? when your not white.  are you mad because black people do not want to become white? ( which is not even possible anyway) and you don't like black people because they are not cuban    ?|`|azKH25wZaa	I cannot believe how white-washed some people are. BE PROUD of your heritage and your Exotic, Mixed Race. It seems like everyone is trying to be something they are not. Look at the President of the US. (The Best Looking, might I add).

If you don't like the way black people or white people act, then that's fine...but you shouldn't assume that ALL black people act one way just because they are black or that ALL white people act one way just because they are white. I am not crazy about the African-American culture...but I realize that not ALL black people act the same way. You can act white or black, or a mixture of both...don't worry about how other people expect for you to act or how they define you.|`|f48d10d4bec5b5e25f9894010aed2c69aa	yes..stop holding racist views. and most whites are not republican. most republicans are white though. thinking anyone is inferior is the wrong way to think and anyone black or white that thinks that way is wrong. be yourself and love it. P.S. you should not be republican. it is because of democrats that minorities have any rights at all|`|iybezfi6aa	Everyone on this earth thinks (for one reason or another) that their group is the superior one.   Also, people take what contact they have had with another group (usually negative) and make a blanket judgment. It is called generalization.  Even among white people this happens. Where you live, what kind of car you drive, what your job is, do you own or rent and on and on.  So join the club.|`|Dv5HiSSraa	Whatever floats your boat.|`|nJwSUv8vaa	We are all humans and from the inside there is no telling us apart racially.    I don't really think your family is trying to make you  "act white", I think they are encouraging you to assimilate to the American Culture and speak proper English.  There is nothing wrong with that!    I think your family is discouraging you from falling into the young crowd that speaks ebonics and wears their pants hanging below their a** crack.  BTW... today the kids that do this come in all races... but they are definitely trying to emulate the Gangster/Rapper lifestyle started by black rappers.    This should not be your only view of black people, the gangster thugs do NOT represent the race as a whole.  Black people are also doctors, lawyers, teachers, social workers, fire fighters, police, serve in the military... etc. etc. etc.    Instead of hating a race simply because of the color of their skin, why not try to learn more about the people of that race that have contributed to society and set great examples for others to follow.  For example, if you get a chance watch the History Channel Biography of George Washington Carver... I guarantee once you tune in you won't be able to change the channel.    BTW... not that is matters... but I'm white.|`|dR26voahaa	i'm sorry but your such a idjit. You have the same dna as all human beings. Being racist is what screws the world up, and your not white and your never going to be white. you need to think for yourself, how about having an origenel thought. Blacks , latinos and other minorities there awesome people. you just need to get to know them.|`|eskZfVBkaa	Are u 4 real? Not all Cubans are White but u r right, there are some White Cubans descended from Europe i.e. Spain. The people that say u r not white because u r Cuban r stupid because being Cuban is a nationality meaning that they can be of any race, but u r stupid for letting certain people's ignorant behaviour turn u in to a racist.    Lmao i'm looking through the comments and many people are saying that Latinos cant be white!! dont be stupid...Latino is NOT a race, it is an ethnicity. There are lots of people who are classed in the US as Latino but who are also racially White (i.e. those who are descended from Spain.) For example, Alexis Bledel is Latina but her ancestors are European so because she was born in Latin America, is she not White? The ignorance of some people amazes me! I am beginning to understand y the person who asked the question feels the way he does!!
qoHOHDIaaa	no, God did not create the pair with original sin, but rather, 'posse non peccare,' from the latin meaning possible not to sin. If you follow Judeo-Christian theology, humans are, since this sin, 'non posse non peccare,' "not able not to sin." what that means is, besides Jesus (who really doesn't count) Adam and Eve were the only two humans who were ever truly free to make all the available choices. They had the option to disobey; they took it. Because of this, now humans don't have the option Not to disobey. hope i helped.|`|Jyxi74x0aa	God created mankind with the capacity to reject him, so that if we choose to love him, we do it of our own free will.|`|IkS3sx6maa	The concept of original sin does not exist.  It's been wrongly passed around by churches.       God has a limitation to His power in that He cannot create a spiritually perfect being.  The being has a spirit but has to mature to perfection.  The best way to do this via obedience to God and learning lessons.      Adam and Eve were tested for their obedience, not because God wanted to trick them as so many, many people have wrongly assumed.  Remember what happened before Adam and Eve, a big war in Heaven from a disobedient and greedy angel named Lucifer.  He wasn't satisfied with being in charge of the earth.  He wanted everything, to include God's throne.    Like the angels, humans have free moral agency to obey God, disobey God or to rebel.  Rebelling often is more trouble than its worth.      So who's going to get to be in charge of the Earth?  Christ.  He passed the obedience test.|`|SclGVXl3aa	No. When God created them, they were in the image of God.  They obeyed God, he was their father. God was their teacher. God did create them with intelligence and choice. Remember, God did warn them. Granted they weren't in the Garden long before war broke out in heaven and had never heard a lie. The bible tells us how cunning satan was. He knew they never heard a lie from the father.  Sin is the transgression of Gods law. Thank God he loved them enough to set in motion the plan of redemption. Nothing God asks of us or requires of us is to our harm. If today's preachers would stand up and tell it like it is, more people would know that sin originated in satan when he wanted to be God. See God is Love. He doesn't force us to love him, he invites us to learn of him and make intelligent decisions regarding what he says. We know satan is the prince of this world, we see how far man has gone and will go to get his agenda accomplished. Sin is the transgression of Gods laws, death is the penalty of sin. We still die today. Sin is ramped in this world. Satan knows his time is short. He is very busy. He would be happy if everyone had a wrong conception of Gods character. Most do anyway now days. |`|eAMq1iBWaa	choice and sin are not synonymous    God does not create sin|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	No.  What they had available to them was choice.|`|THoNCUVEaa	Quran 6:164. Say: What! shall I seek a Lord other than Allah? And He is the Lord of all things; and no soul earns (evil) but against itself, and no bearer of burden shall bear the burden of another; then to your Lord is your return, so He will inform you of that in which you differed.   17:15. Whoever goes aright, for his own soul does he go aright; and whoever goes astray, to its detriment only does he go astray: nor can the bearer of a burden bear the burden of another, nor do We chastise until We raise an apostle.   35:18. And a burdened soul cannot bear the burden of another and if one weighed down by burden should cry for (another to carry) its burden, not aught of it shall be carried, even though he be near of kin. You warn only those who fear their Lord in secret and keep up prayer; and whoever purifies himself, he purifies himself only for (the good of) his own soul; and to Allah is the eventual coming.   39:7 If you are ungrateful, then surely Allah is Self-sufficient above all need of you; and He does not like ungratefulness in His servants; and if you are grateful, He likes it in you; and no bearer of burden shall bear the burden of another; then to your Lord is your return, then will He inform you of what you did; surely He is Cognizant of what is in the breasts.   53:38. That no bearer of burden shall bear the burden of another |`|7d647be57724929a656a84a04d156140aa	God created man with a will to choose, meaning he could say yes or no at any given time.  Everything God made was good and perfect, no strings attached.|`|jCgnnWmuaa	Neither! Adam and Eve did not sin because they were perfect immortal human beings. They had transgressed. They disobeyed God. Only mortal human beings commit sin.   You could say that Cain had committed the first sin, murder!.|`|503991d7e18cf8ad3b3864e35df39ec3aa	this story is really funny !    you are right about that . but how about satan ? .. where all this evil came from ?     all believers in one and only one God face the same problem !    if God is so perfect and holy , where things like evil and sin came from ?!!!    if God is the source , then ..... he is the source of evil and good . not just one of them . but they can't imagine it , and can't accept it .  if they did ... God wouldn't have the right to send anyone to hell or heaven .. and all religious systems will fall !    if Adam and eve had a choice , then why God would punish someone for simply making a choice ?!!!    because it's against the command of God ? ... the idea of a "command of God" itself , is against "free" choice .    "believe or go to hell" is against the choice that God himself gave us and created for us .    how can free will and free choice be a gift from God if he would send some one to eternal hell if they used it ?!    but , you know what ... the whole story is not to be thought of as a real event or real story . it's just a symbol . like children stories .. that's why we are not allowed to question it .. we are only allowed to believe it !    the meaning behind the story is the reason it was created for us : you have a choice , choose to do the will of God , not your own will .. or God will send you to hell . ( even worse ! )    think about these symbols in this story :    the tree of life , the tree of knowledge , satan , being naked after eating from the tree of knowledge .    and here is a question :    do you know that , according to the bible , the reason God send Aam and Eve away from the garden of eden was NOT what they done , but the fear that they would do more ( eating from the tree of eternal life ) ?    another question :    if this is the real reason , then why did God send his son to give us eternal life ?!!!!!! .... he could just let us eat from the tree of eternal life !    can't understand this God ... he keeps changing his mind all the time .    :-)  |`|ec02b3b2ac0531db23e2884c415edc09aa	Interesting.    God created mankind with a "Free Will"...not with a sinful nature as they were in the presence of God and walked with him.  Remember, Eve was fooled by satan, but Adam was not fooled.

Would not that person be at least a measure more wise?      However, if the person following the fool witnesses the fool plunge off the cliff and continues off the cliff himself, then the greater fool is he.

PERSONALLY... my Father is my Dad, AND , spiritually speaking,  My God.   Physically speaking..any higher up then my biological father and person who raised me,  is meaningless.  And spiritually speaking, going any farther down the chain is also meaningless.    So Physically speaking -- I start at the bottom.   Spiritually speaking -- I start at the top.
xWi4ua0Iaa	Is he good friends with (or dependant in some other way on) your dad?  It's very strange that he won't at least hear your side of the story and then agree to at least talk to your father about abuse.    Maybe you could talk to a school counsler or principal about the issue, since it's obvious your religious "leader" feels comfortable turning his back on you.    EDIT:  Right, you should not give info out to people you don't know on the internet (they may claim Christian beliefs and what not, but you can't ever really know that and they may be a pedophile or something)...just get to somebody in the school system, even ask a teacher if you can meet with them privately at lunch or something...you need to share this with an adult who can offer you some type of protection against further travesties...and he CAN help the beating - he just needs to know that the world is going to make him stop...he won't listen to you alone, but he will listen to the world around him.

Religion is just a tool of tyranny, a way of keeping people under control, and in modern America where independence and freedom is permitted if not encouraged, you're obviously expecting something more than your religion can ever offer. This man won't help you because he thinks you ought to obey your parents even if they're abusive, just like he thinks you should obey him, your future husband, your president, police officers, and anyone else who has more authority than you. He's probably angry you even asked for help, because he thinks, "How dare you? Sit back down and shut up." He thinks suffering brings you closer to God because when you're the weakest you'll have nothing else, and "closer to god" is all he cares about, even if it meant you died.    It's time you wake up, realize religion is a dead end, that America has been telling you what's right all along, independence and freedom from tyranny, and you have to not only stand up to your father for your own sake, but because it's the right thing to do. Contact your local child protective services and tell them exactly what has been happening and someone will help you.|`|LSJ8BmHVaa	I'm sure some people can find Bible verses that say your dad is the king of the home, so if you believe that then maybe you're out of luck.

For one thing, you can always try hard to honor your parentseven when their behavior seems unbearable. (Ephesians 6:2) Talking back or, worse yet, screaming back at them is displeasing to God and usually succeeds only in escalating the conflict.  So when your dad says something mean responding to rage with kindness is not easy, but it may very well put out the fires of contention.Proverbs 26:20.   One thing too to think about is;  parents may be profoundly unhappy for any number of reasons. Some try to escape misery and frustration by immersing themselves in work, alcohol, or drugs. Your accepting the fact that your parents are imperfect and learning something about their background can go a long way toward helping you to understand them. Proverbs 19:11 says: The insight of a man certainly slows down his anger.  Keep in mind too that, there are other negative feelings that may afflict you because of the situation at home. You may have feelings of anger or even diappointment. All these feelings are understandable, given the circumstances.  However, Always remember to stick to Bible principles and standards. That includes showing your parents honor. (Ephesians 6:1,?2) Such honor would rule out adopting a vengeful, vindictive attitude. Remember, no amount of apparent wrongdoing on a parents part can ever justify wrongdoing on your part.  There is no doubt that the lack of a parents love can hurt. But parental failure need not determine the kind of person you will become.|`|XYmrJs9Oaa	Hi baby girl,  Does your mom know that he beats you? Have you two talked about this?

To love them, and desire them more than to love God and man, to be more anxious to obtain them, and spend more time in their acquisition, than in efforts to glorify God, and save the souls of men, is to love the world in the sense of the text. Where the love of God and of men is supreme in the heart, there may be a suitable desire for worldly objects; but where an individual manifests a disposition to give the acquisition of wealth, or of worldly objects, the preference, and aims rather at obtaining worldly things than at glorifying God and of doing good to men, it is certain that the love of the world is supreme in his heart.       |`|o9Ckf0h4aa	No!

However, many Christians also put up a Christmas tree and that certainly isn't from the Bible.    I know when my son was little, I did not want to deny him the fun of going out and getting candy.  The same for Christmas, we had a tree and we exchanged gifts.    As for Halloween, we would pass out Bible tracts along with the candy.  We were surprised at how many parent's appreciated that.  Of course, the kids loved the candy.  Me too.      And for Christmas while Jesus was not born in December, it is a time that we can find many occasions to share our faith, visit others, sing to our neighbors, get out and mingle, so there's a lot of good things, Christ-like things, we do and share.    But somewhere in each of our Christian lives, we have to draw the line as once we dabble with the occult, we are messing with fire.      "When you enter the land the Lord your God is giving you, do not learn to imitate the detestable ways of the nations there. Let no one be found among you who sacrifices his son or daughter in the fire, who practices divination or sorcery, interprets omens, engages in witchcraft, or casts spells, or who is a medium or spiritist or who consults the dead. Anyone who does these things is detestable to the Lord." Deuteronomy 18:9-13, NIV|`|9J8ciEwWaa	Halloween  All Hallows Eve  The Eve of All souls day    Whichever we prefer to call it, It is not a Holiday/festival which Christ would ever celebrate! A Born again Christian lives with Christ at the centre of his/her life.    If you read the following,    Halloween is on October 31st, the last day of the Celtic calendar. It was originally a pagan holiday, honoring the dead. Halloween was referred to as All Hallows Eve and dates back to over 2000 years ago.     All Hallows Eve is the evening before All Saints Day, which was created by Christians to convert pagans, and is celebrated on November 1st. The Catholic church honored saints on this designated day.  The Church(Catholic Church) has incorporated not only a day to help convert pagans to Christianity but also Christmas and Easter have developed from pagan festivals.  Now it has grown into a hybrid festival between Christianity and Paganism that it is hard to define anymore....but for sure, Christ is not upheld during Halloween. The pagan origins are celebrated and in many counties just treated like an evening of fun dressing up, but in Wicca for example it is celebrated with rituals.    Halloween culture can be traced back to the Druids, a Celtic culture in Ireland, Britain and Northern Europe. Roots lay in the feast of Samhain, which was annually on October 31st to honor the dead.  Samhain signifies "summers end" or November. Samhain was a harvest festival with huge sacred bonfires, marking the end of the Celtic year and beginning of a new one. Many of the practices involved in this celebration were fed on superstition.         The Celts believed the souls of the dead roamed the streets and villages at night. Since not all spirits were thought to be friendly, gifts and treats were left out to pacify the evil and ensure next years crops would be plentiful. This custom evolved into trick-or-treating.    So given the history and origins should a Christian dress up as gouls and ghosts? Should a Christian decorate thier hoomes with Jack o lanterns to scare away evil spirits? Should we encourage our children to practice these things even?   That is up to each Christian family to discuss. But adult individuals should know the origins in ALL Festivals celebrated throughout the year because mixing traditions with Paganism leaves Christianity diluted and loosing its identity! I mean who do we follow as Lord?|`|5512018d53cae3a1c939ecb7fdca2d55aa	Yes...paganism is not for followers of God. You can only server ONE master!|`|AA12346187	yes I think  we should  its  playing with evil.|`|b660102b2fc9513dd1125d9410450d92aa	 First off us Catholics did not invent Halloween. Nice try...We ripped off the concept from the pagans. We wanted to make nice with the pagans to convert them so we came up with All Saints All Souls Day to allow them to celebrate under the Catholic umbrella. Fault me not for my honesty. I am required for I am a Catholic....  |`|yAvTxh47aa	Why would they, Halloween is a Christian holiday.    I mean, I know "born-agains" don't like the Catholic church, who came up with the day, but they practice *other* holidays the Christian church came up with, like Easter and Christmas.    Sure, Halloween shares a date with November Eve, but that doesn't mean much.    Christians who oppose Halloween tend to be ignorant of what *they* are supposed to be honoring that night.|`|7d647be57724929a656a84a04d156140aa	You first need to read and research what Halloween is all about and then you wouldn't be asking that question.

Look, in thousands of years the sex industry has thrived, it's not going away.    |`|AA12189772	I didn't know that California had allowed Prostitution, but I think it's a great idea.    When prostitution is legal, it is much safer both to the prostitutes and the people who buy sex.  As a legal business it can be taxed.  The prostitutes can have regular check-ups to make sure they don't have any sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).  It's not a shadowy crime fraught with danger, but a legal business.    Your attempts to frighten the rest of us with your religious rhetoric won't work.  Both Jews and Muslims avoid pork as a part of their religious beliefs, but you don't see Americans who are Jewish or Muslim trying to shut down the pork industry; they simply abstain from eating pork themselves.  Why is this so difficult, then, for Christians?  If your faith doesn't allow you to have sex outside of marriage, then that's your business, but not everyone shares your views.      BTW, there are no "babies" killed at conception; they are "babies" once they are actually born.  Here is another religious diversion;  according to my faith, life starts with birth.  Don't like abortions?  Then don't have one.  Don't like gay marriages?  Then don't marry someone who is of your gender.  Don't like prostitution?  Then don't buy sex.  Do you think they should all be illegal because they go against your beliefs?  Then we'll have to cater to every single religious belief out there. I hope you don't like pork or shellfish or alcoholic beverages or celebrating holidays or any of the forbidden practices of the multitude of religious beliefs of Americans.  Better to let our nation follow the Constitution.   Or is that too difficult for you?    P.S. How can Christians claim that Jesus is all about love when his followers love to condemn others to eternal suffering, if they could?    PPS to Donna:  Prayer hasn't been "taken out" of schools, but rightfully restored to believers.  It is a clear violation of our Constitution to have schools choose prayers for students.  Now students can pray when they like, as long as they are not disturbing class or harassing others.  As a teacher, I periodically pray in class, but I do it quietly.. it is between me and my deity.  No need to make my students pray my way.    And you can certainly carry a Bible to school, and read it, too!  Again, there's some common sense involved:  if your teacher is trying to teach you math, it's rather rude to be reading the Bible.  People of other faiths can also bring their holy scriptures to school if they like.  Contrary to your post, the sky is not falling.|`|7d647be57724929a656a84a04d156140aa	I am with you 1000%.

Trumpets, in all cases in Scripture, are used for practical purposes - as a signal of warning or as a signal of an incipient public event.

The first trumpet causes hail and fire that destroys much of the plant life in the world (Revelation 8:7). The second of the seven trumpets brings about what seems to be a meteor hitting the oceans and causing the death of much of the worlds sea life (Revelation 8:8-9). The third trumpet is similar to the second trumpet except it affects the worlds lakes and rivers instead of the oceans (Revelation 8:10-11).    The fourth of the seven trumpets causes the sun and moon to be darkened (Revelation 8:12). The fifth trumpet results in a plague of demonic locusts that attack and torture humanity (Revelation 9:1-11). The sixth trumpet releases a demonic army that kills a third of humanity (Revelation 9:12-21).

The trumpets is from the story     of Pharoah and Caesar in early Roman history that signalled the    arrival of Gods, Deities, Spiritual faiths, and Ancient God of the    longest histories of Egypt.

Red trumpets     were used such as in the plagues of Egypt, the passover, the      condemnation to purgatory and beyond signalling the end of event.     Green trumpets and blue trumpets are often written to mention     miraculous ascension of nations with miracles that belong to the     family of God showing mineral knowledges to harvest and grow the     most advanced horticultures, agrocultures, and orchards.  These     are today sometimes called the flag, scottish, and crown cultures     having crests, logos, plaids to signify oldest farm homes.
a0b1f8c0a89f6e9a6fb1048bcf570db3aa	I used to be very dedicated and accustomed to it. It truly did help manifest amazing miraculous blessings in my life. I used to fast for four days at a time and then resume normalcy for four days. Not that you "do it" for the results, but it is true what scripture says, "Some come about [out] only by fasting and prayer."    The key is to communicate with God and never fast without prayer and without confirming it to Him and asking Him to substain you.  Blessings.|`|iMGgBH5jaa	I've tried fasting before but then I realized that I was being irrational, if not stupid! I didnt fast for religious purposes... I just fasted because I thought it was healthy and that I also wanted to follow the fad/fashion at the time!    It's kinda absurd if you ask me! That's because there are two ends of the spectrum of eating.. on one end is pigging out, overeating, obesity, gluttony etc.... on the other end is fasting, anorexia, bulimia etc.    So the question is really about where the right balance is. That right balance is in BETWEEN the two ends of the spectrum.    If you decided to spend some time as a serial killer... and let's say you killed 10 people... then devoting the rest of your time there after to create 10 other people doesn't even things out! The right balance is in between killing humans and creating humans...    So... as far as eating goes.. the right balance is to eat in between obesity and anorexia... i.e. eat fricken normally!.. Three meals a day dont over-eat dont under-eat.    |`|BA1wzb7maa	well when you fast you usually spend that day with God and pray and you don't eat food but you can eat sweats :)|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	It gives your digestive system a much needed break from processing all that food and it helps you get rid of some of the 8-10 pounds of waste you lug around 24/7 in your bowels. I fasted for five days once and had as many bowel movements as when I was eating, so there you go, all that waste has got to come out. You can also try acai berry, you can drink it or eat the fruit most markets have it now and all health food stores do incl Whole Foods.|`|eAMq1iBWaa	it is beneficial both physically and spiritually    gives your digestive system a rest    acknowledges spiritually that man does not live by food alone but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of GOD    Deu 9:9 When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, [even] the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat bread nor drink water:|`|Ue2u4q6Saa	It makes you mentally stronger.

Fasting helps strengthen you, humbles you, self control and also brings healing to your life.  |`|2RMmU8Ghaa	I think it's pointless and people should eat whenever the hell they want to.|`|mQsotPCaaa	I do pure fasting. I once was catholic, but once I left the church I kept occasionally doing it. It helps me clear my mind and focus on what matters. It also forces me to preserve my self control. And it really does have health benefits, but I mainly do it for the mental ones.|`|Lvtezxt5aa	you dont eat or drink for a month you eat at like 5:30(b4 sunrise) then can eat at like 7:30(after sunset)after its done we have eid(its sorta like christmas) we do it to see what poor people feel like and other reasons ,at firstits really hard(the first3 days) then after it gets really easy plus you loose some pounds too(i lost 10 but i gain it back :'( ) btw this is how muslims do it|`|OkKZItpPaa	I'm not a big fan of it really. Well, its different. When someone tells you fasting you think of not eating AT ALL for that whole time, when really its just while the suns up, so they could stuff themselves when its night time. Even so, it seems weird to me and I dont like the idea of not eating (not that im fat =P). But hey, it's there religion, live and let live. |`|fgISdJsWaa	If your religious then fasting can bring you closer to God and make you appreciate the life he gave you a lot more.  If your not then it is really good for detoxing your body. Just drink water and smoothies for a week it flushes your system.  Fasting can also be good for making you stronger as a person, because if you can mentally survive a fast then you will be good at other will powered things like stopping smoking. |`|m2fozkYuaa	I fast a month every year from dawn to dusk its called Ramadan ............no water no food just  Air.....lol .........it has so many benfits .....1)feeling for the poor 2) cleaning up toxins in ur body 3) it also strength ur avoids for temptations

True believers should be humble and loving, just as Christ was humble and loving.    Having been there and done that allows me to help other who have the same problems or similar experiences.  So a bunch of law breakers can help each other.  The closer we get to Christ the more we realize how much we need his loving grace to forgive us because we are sinners.  That is the closer we get in our relationship with Christ, the higher up on that ladder to heaven, the more we recognize our own shortcomings and wrong doings.|`|fOfJz9OMaa	The church is a great company of reforming sinners.

Saul Alinsky says that Christians can't live up to the tenets of Christianity.    Folks go to church because the bible tells them to congregate to worship.      If one were to draw a parellel from your question to a parent telling children not to hang out with certain types, then it doesn't make sense to go to church.    If one were to take the more traditional stance, it would be to attend church to become more informed on your religion, ostensibly to live more in keeping with what your God wants of you.|`|zDJX84raaa	My Dreams Of 8, you are wrong,. so wrong, open your eyes  think, feel, be.    don't go to the church, if you want to follow the lord,you can do it in your own accord, you do not need to do it infront of lots of pretend fakes|`|Nbr5mEnpaa	Go to church and understand why.

Go to church and strive for the best because at the end of this world you'll stand alone before God. No excuses. God to church and pray daily.

Church is not about sin.  Church- organized by man- is about making us all 'good kids '- and getting paid to do it.        According to the Bible, however, 'The  Church'  is  a body of peoples (timeless) who believe in Christ, and has nothing to do with the gathering together of a group of people who all share the same exact religious beliefs. Nor does Christ ever imply that a building is his church.    Throughout the ages- some of us will have believed in God - and lived in Faith, despite our religious beliefs and/or memberships- or more likely- the lack of them.  This is a group of people that Christ prophesied would be his followers- or his 'Bride',  or his 'Church.'     I will add that the Bible also states, " where two or more are gathered together in my name- there I am, in the midst of them. "  This goes for Christians, Wiccans, Muslims, Etcetera, Etcetera.      Lastly-  No one is with out sin. Jesus says to the crowd who was ready to throw stones at a sinner- 'he who is without sin-cast the first stone.|`|1a75a55deed459f0f0430e0b8ed4e39caa	Everybody's a "law breaker."

Worship God on your own time, but attend church as well, as they often have programs that you can join that help others in ways that you are not able to do on your own.     Religion should not only be about pleasing yourself, but about pleasing God, and he is pleased when Men and Women come together in fellowship to worship him and help others.

In addition to the bible they have the book of mormon and an Italian Angel named Moroni. They are nice people who reject others not of their faith. Since the religion was founded in the 1800s  I can not accept their claim that Angel Moroni appeared and gave a golden plaque to their founder. If that actually happened, then Moroni would not be the a messenger from God. Why? Because God does not change his mind every few centuries. All Churches in the Protestant fold were founded by men. The Christian Church founded by Jesus became the Catholic Church by proclamation of St. Augustin.|`|93fc57ca1c692acd2bd8f1bc7a446e6eaa	Since you have "always been interested", then I recommend that you talk to your friends and ask them to answer some questions for you.

As for me, I have been a member for over half-century and I am a sixth generation LDS.    Is it valid?  Of course it is.  I have studied it all my life, tried the tests of faith and prayer that are recommended and have felt the confirming influence of the Holy Ghost, testifying to me that it is all true.

Gal 1:6 I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:        Gal 1:7 Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.        Gal 1:8 But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.|`|oxTdJ4B8aa	No religion is valid, they are all based on mythic stories that have nothing to do with reality.|`|LLey4VRzaa	Yes they are Valid, Anyone who Believes Jesus came in the Flesh is of God! And Mormons believe in Jesus!      1 John 4:1-3  1 Dear friends, do not believe everyone who claims to speak by the Spirit. You must test them to see if the spirit they have comes from God. For there are many false prophets in the world. 2 This is the way to find out if they have the Spirit of God: If a prophet acknowledges that Jesus Christ became a human being, that person has the Spirit of God. 3 If a prophet does not acknowledge Jesus, that person is not from God. Such a person has the spirit of the Antichrist. You have heard that he is going to come into the world, and he is already here.|`|6DmsiLGbaa	I do feel strongly about it.

Just because it's a pumpkin pie and not a cherry pie, doesn't mean it's not a pie.     I'm not sure exactly what you mean by "valid", but I can safely say that it is.

Who are you or anyone else to say her or anyone else's religion is VALID or not.  Religion is based on ones FAITH - and it is as valid as anyone needs it to be FOR THEM individually.  Certainly she nor the other several MILLION other mormons in the world do not need your approval to VALIDATE their faith & love of Jesus CHrist, do they?    And "My 5 cents" comments are completely inaccurate (lies) like SO many others who lack knowledge about what Mormons REALLY believe.
j6jG5hg8aa	if you wanna call it karma...thats fine...but dont mistake its not karma...its actually because you dont allow God to work in your life...your giving the devil the ability to....and there fore...not doing the will of God has it downfall cause the devil is doinging...and those who are saved by God who think their reeping from the sins of their lives b4 they were saved....that can't be so...because Jesus died for your sins...and therefore took the consequences for us...so bottom line put God in ful control and give him the glory and you'll see your "Karma"...start to diminish...    With love|`|137wNE3haa	yes  i believe Karma is real  though i get yelled at all the time for believing in it  CUX Karma is the devil  but i think that karma is not always bad i think it can be good sometimes    bad karma i had  i took sum1 Else's money so i could get stuff  and later on 40$ that i worked my *** for to pay off a fine disappeared  ^KARMA!    good karma  one day i got grounded for the whole summer so i decided to start listening helping around the house yada yada yada  and i had to go every where with my mom because i wasn't allowed to be home alone i don't know why y   so one day i had to go to this church carnival ugh SO didn't want to go because i wouldn't be able to do anything but i did because i didn't want to get  in any trouble SO i was at these place and i see an girl i knees mother and im like UGH! so my mom starts hanging around her and she brings up that her daughter is here and i hated her daughter we were enemies for the past 8 years couldn't stand her and shes like you guys should hang out i turn around so she  couldn't see me roll my eyes  l8ter on that day  were hanging out and i ended up spending the Note over there and we are now the best of friends  VERY GOOD KARMA|`|ulwXFrrJaa	Karma is real!

I also don't gain anything from not believing in leprechauns, Cthulu, or the Keebler elves. The reason should be obvious: belief concerns what is real, not what might have great utility.    When I was a believer, I derived my greatest times of happiness from my belief. Now that I'm not a believer, I found that the same heights of happiness can be found here on earth. Just because my source is different doesn't mean that I don't have any joy in my life at all.|`|IIhiSprlaa	No, we get more sleep sunday mornings.|`|C1SOqQSkaa	If god doesn't exist, it really wouldn't matter if not believing in him caused an instant heart attack - it would still be correct.

Only as an individual can I embrace my humanity, pursuing happiness through reason, honesty, and benevolent self-interest. As a slave one can only find peace through blanking one's mind and threatening one's master's enemies.|`|kZeu2Dyzaa	A person who claims to be an atheist yet constantly discusses divinity in a negative light (either in person or via a forum such as Y!A) falls into one of two categories:    1. They do not really believe that there is no God even though they want to. Their doubt of the validity of atheism leads them to attempt to validate their belief in it through the persecution of people who do not believe in it.    2. They were mistreated, abused, neglected, or otherwise harmed during their formative years by an outspoken proponent of some brand of divinity and their adamant belief in atheism coupled with their preoccupation for harassing non-atheists is their misguided attempt to "get even" with the person who wronged them.|`|3GAiVmEAaa	What does that have to do with anything? I am agnostic. I don't get "peace", my answer is "I don't know and I can't know", if anything admitting that makes thing scarier sometimes. Admitting the world is a big place, and we can't just stick on the label "science" or "God", that we need to keep question but will likely never find the answers.    But what am I supposed to do? Its nice people get "Peace" by saying they believe in God. I can't force that on myself. Yes, sometimes I do wish I could feel more certain. I wish I could convince myself that the pain is there for a reason, or that when I die there will be something wonderful out there for me. I can't though, that just isn't how my mind works.  I would take honesty over lying to myself just for my own comfort any day.    Instead, I find comfort in the here and now. I focus on trying to make this life count, learning about it and just living. I still leave for the possibility of something bigger out there, but I am not counting on it. Its worked so far.|`|6KpZ2fIRaa	When I first disbelieved, it was bothersome and uncomfortable. I got used to it fairly quickly though.

I get happiness from other places. I don't feel any need to get it from faith, no.|`|jMPA2CSYaa	Actually, I've been much happier since I gave up on religion.  I used to fear that most of the people I cared about were doomed to eternal torment, but now that doesn't bother me.  I also feared that Satan was lurking around the corner and that this world is some sort of punishment for Original Sin.  I don't have that psychological burden any more...|`|IBOuhyWoaa	i think it is all relative...i know religious people who aren't happy and i know atheists who aren't happy    but me being an atheist has nothing to do with my happiness|`|5tMCDu8gaa	It does give me inner peace, yes. Being free from guilt and fear is a wonderful thing.    The things I am allowed to do as a result of being an atheist give me joy. Learning gives me joy. Experiencing new things that most religious people's minds are closed to gives me joy.    Atheism itself is just a tool towards living a free life, and freedom gives me joy.    I don't wish I could experience what the religious do. Even if they are happy, they are happy while they persecute others, and spread intolerance through the world. They are just too ignorant to realize it. I would never want to live like that.|`|PlBYWZ8Saa	Do I get joy? Well, yes. It allows me a unique world view where I am my own agent, and this life is not just an entry test for the afterlife.     That same notion gives me some measure of peace also. It makes me happy that I am allowed to be kind and generous to my fellow man without worrying if they are a sinner, or if they are the same religion as me, because it just doesn't matter.     Do I wish I could have the same happiness as a religious person? No. Not really. To use an anecdote from my own life; In the home that my grandfather had to be placed in towards the end of his life, there was a woman who was suffering from quite severe dementia. She thought she was eight, and played with a dolly constantly. She acted like an 8 year old, had the childlike joy and innocence of an 8 year old. She thought she was really and truly happy. To everyone looking in on her though, it was just heart-crushingly sad.   Not to be mean, but I feel that same sense of heart-crushing sorrow when I see some of the religious who claim to be so filled with joy.|`|0RcnOgA7aa	No|`|ysJusb21aa	Many atheists I encounter are very moral people.  And on the flip side, many immoral people I have come across are proclaimed Christians.  I think religion is an important part of society for people to strive to be moral human beings.  When you discover there is a person who is an atheist in your life, observe them carefully.  I have observed that an atheist treats people very kindly and justly.  Kindness is a symptom of joy.  Oh, and I am a Christian.|`|raTZT7e0aa	i'm more then happy not believing in a 'god' It makes me feel, i don't know, that i'm in control of my life. that i don't have to be constantly trying to impress some man/women in the sky, sea, ground, or space. i can be me. on top of that, i can accept all religions because i myself don't have one to believe in. :)|`|LqyOHY37aa	When I finally resolved that there was no god, I was relieved of a bunch of things...    Depression, anger, fear, misery, dependency.  I am much happier and have such a better outlook for myself.    Best decision of my life!|`|355JLlcLaa	I experienced joy and inner peace when I was religious.    I realised in mid-teenage that faith was based upon nothing but itself, that science explained nature satisfactorily without needing supernatural beings, and that religious beliefs were no different to those of ancient beliefs in gods and goddesses. And I've been free to think for myself, and read about scientific theories - modified as evidence is discovered - that really do approach the truth about how nature works.    I have joy and inner peace now that I'm free from faith, only more so.|`|o2fkN88paa	I dont even think about God or religion in my daily life, I think about my future, my family, friends, boyfriend, my hopes, ambitions, my dreams.

They're very old-fashioned (she was active from the 1800s to the 1940s, and many of her books have a 1920s feel to them), but I think they're kind of neat at times. I'm definitely not part of the target audience for romance novels (I'm an Italian Catholic guy), but somebody turned me on to those books, and they can be a fun read. They're quite easy to read, and Hill has a flair for writing idiomatic dialogue.

8hEVh44faa	Hola, soy italiana! Te voy a explicar...    La verdad, sin duda, es que la mayora (99,5%!!?) de las palabras italianas terminan con vocal, pero no es una regla gramatical, sino simplemente una peculiaridad de nuestro idioma. De hecho, tenemos algunas palabritas que terminan con consonante, como, por ejemplo, non, con, un, al, del, nel, per, sul.....  Ademas, tenemos muchas palabras heredadas del ingls (u otros idiomas extranjeros) que hoy forman parte del diccionario italiano (puedes encontrarlas en todos los diccionarios italianos), porque no se podrian traducir en nigun otro modo diferente y las utilizamos diariamente en nuestra comunicacion: computer, slip, top, gel, pullover, tram, scanner, souvenir, snob, zig zag....  Y an, existen casos concretos en los que se puede (o se tiene que) quitar la vocal final de una palabra:  amore=>amor, sole=>sol, andare=>andar, bello=>bel, grande=>gran........

Questo evento dovrebbe sconvolgere la natura del nostro   pianeta con eventi catastrofici, quali eruzioni, tornado,   tsunami, terremoti ecc..  Questa data la si  tratta da tante fonti;quella pi ufficiale   e quella che riguarda il calendario Maya che interpret   questa data come la fine del lungo computo, come l'inizio   o la fine di un era passata, per dare l'inizio dell'era   dell'Acquario.  Nel calendario maya la fine del lungo computo deriverebbe   dalla loro mitologia che affermerebbe che sono esistite   5 ere nella storia dell'uomo,ognuna della durata di 12.960   anni,ed ognuna finita con una catastrofe,le 5 ere erano   quella dell'acqua, della terra, del fuoco, della terra e quella   attuale che sarebbe quella dell'oro.  Difatti, in ognuna di queste ere,l'inclinazione dell'asse   terrestre avrebbe subito una variazione che avrebbe   portato all'inversione del campo magnetico terrestre.  Da quello che posso pensare da questi dati, potrebbe   esserci un filo di verit, ma non penso che il fare delle   supposizioni possa rispondere appieno alla tua   domanda.  Allo stato attuale non conosco dei reali dati che potrebbero   dire che cosa succeda,anche perch le possibilit   d'interpretare male il messaggio dei Maya potrebbe   essere alto.Tuttavi una cosa di cui possiamo essere certi    il surriscaldamento globale,che molti avvalorano ome   conseguenza dell'inizio dell'inversione dei poli,  tuttavia il surriscaldamento globale  anche dovuto dagli   scarichi delle auto che inquinano le citt.  Nel frattempo si puo solo sperare nel bene,   ed avere la pazienza di attendere questi 5 anni.|`|qxL3zkPWaa	avr 20 anni!!;-P|`|s0vckpZ4aa	mah...tanto il mondo peggio di cosi non puo andare....di sicuro saremo di 4 anni piu vecchi....e quello e un bel problema...ciao!|`|lTR6aPPxaa	Proprio niente, secondo me sono le solite storie di maniaci visionari.

Ephesians 4:26 is familiar to anyone who has ever experienced any Christian counseling, and like many Bible verses bears closer examination.     If you allow satan any sort of an opening, he will march right through it, guns blazing.    The complete verse reads, "In your anger do not sin: Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry, and do not give the devil a foothold.  Ephesians 4:26-27 (NIV)    In this verse, it shows that anger towards others is a huge opening for the devil to exploit.    Leviticus 19:17-18   Do not hate your brother in your heart. Rebuke your neighbor frankly so you will not share in his guilt. Do not seek revenge or bear a grudge against one of your people, but love your neighbor as yourself. I am the LORD.    Psalm 37:8  Refrain from anger and turn from wrath; do not fretit leads only to evil.    Psalm 145: 8-9   The LORD is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and rich in love. The LORD is good to all; he has compassion on all he has made.    Proverbs 14:17   A quick-tempered man does foolish things, and a crafty man is hated.    Proverbs 15:18   A hot-tempered man stirs up dissension, but a patient man calms a quarrel.    Proverbs 16:32   Better a patient man than a warrior, a man who controls his temper than one who takes a city.    Proverbs 17:14-15   The beginning of strife is like releasing water; Therefore stop contention before a quarrel starts. He who justifies the wicked, and he who condemns the just, Both of them alike are an abomination to the LORD.     Proverbs 19:11   A man's wisdom gives him patience; it is to his glory to overlook an offense.    Proverbs 20:3   It is to a man's honor to avoid strife, but every fool is quick to quarrel.    Ecclesiastes 7:9   Do not be quickly provoked in your spirit, for anger resides in the lap of fools.

AA12245463	It says, "It shall be on that day that the Lord will once again show His hand, to acquire the remnant of His people..."  In other words, He showed His hand when He redeemed the Israelites from slavery in Egypt, just as He will once again redeem the lost tribes of Israel.      16.  There will be a road for the remnant of His people that will remain from Assyria, as there was for Israel on the day it went up from the land of Egypt.    The "redemption" is NOT from Babylon -- it is from 400 years of slavery in Egypt.  The Exodus is the quintessence of Judaism.  .|`|4807230affa1ab91b912bc7830a4b01baa	Many people believe this prophesy was fulfilled when the state of Israel was established after WW2.

Only country to completly disappear for thousands of years, still manage to have it's people hold to their heritage throughout the whole time, and then return to the land of their forefathers.    and have this same event foretold two-thousand plus years prior to it occuring.|`|jOEM2i17aa	That's a good question; I'll post the verse again, mostly for my own help (I read the KJV)...    Isaiah 11:11  And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.    I believe this verse (as you suggested) is speaking of when our LORD Jesus returns (very soon).  Which will be His second coming.    You're right that He (yes Jesus, who is Jehovah God!) delivered the children of Israel out of Egypt a long time ago.    Not sure about your reference to the second temple, but maybe you are referring to the temple Jesus is currently building, which is comprised of all true believers (even now He is gathering them all over the world, even out of all of the local congregations (see Rev. 18:4)).    I think the language of the verse ("from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.") shows that God is speaking of the WHOLE WORLD and again this shows it is speaking of the LORD Jesus' second coming.    So when it says "the Lord shall set His hand again the second time to recover the remnant of His people, which shall be left..."  I believe God is speaking of how when the LORD Jesus returns He will rapture all of His people who are alive and remain (the remnant), because He will already have all of the others that He has saved (with Him in spirit in Heaven although their bodies are still in the graves for now - but will be resurrected at the same time all of the true believers who are alive at His coming are caught up with Him in the air.  Halelujah!  What a day that will be, and it's coming very soon!    God doesn't refer to this as the "third time" because the first deliverance from the land of Egypt (although it really historically happened, and God showed His marvellous works), was a picture of the spiritual deliverance (Egypt representing Satan and his dominion from which all children of God are delivered).  And God set His hand the first time when Jesus came the first time to be the Lamb of God, and start His salvation program, and He brought in a lot of souls down through the ages, even before the time of the cross, but I believe when Jesus was born/lived/died/rose again - this is when He set His hand the first time.  Of course He was/is the "Lamb slain from the foundation of the world" (see Rev. 13:8), so, maybe we can say that His hand was set the first time all the way back at the foundation of the world!|`|myowidoNaa	I'm not sure I'm following your question. Israel (northern 10 tribes) had already gone into captivity)722 BC) when this was written and the Babylonian captivity (Judah or southern kingdom) was still future.(587 BC). Assyria attacked Judah around 700 BC.  Isaiah chapters 9-12 predicts the defeat of Sennacherib's (Isa 37:36)  as well as the still future in-gathering of all of Israel including the lost tribes(Isa 27:13)     This passage doesn't have anything to do with the Babylonian captivity and although a few  from the lost tribes may have been mixed in with Judah for the most part the northern tribes never returned.

The people that today call themselves Jews (i.e. practice Judaism) are still waiting for the Savior to come.

(we are talking sex outside of marriage here...the other part I won't even attempt, that is between you and God once you become a Christian or get BACK with Christ).    Repent means...  1. To be sorry for your sins  2. Turn away from your sins  3. Do not knowingly continue to sin...    If you are talking about becoming a Christian...  1. Repent (remember what repent means)  2. Be baptized in the name of Jesus  3. Walk a daily walk with Jesus (Once saved always saved is a lie from Satan).    TO BE A CHRISTIAN:   1. Believe: (NO ONE CAN BELIEVE FOR YOU)    2. Repent: (NO ONE CAN REPENT FOR YOU)    3. Be Baptized: (By immersion) (NO ONE CAN BE BAPTIZED FOR YOU-NO ONE CAN DECIDE FOR YOU-NO OTHER FORM OF BAPTISM IS BIBLICALY ACCEPTABLE...)    Being dedicated has nothing what so ever to do with becoming a Christian...    Since I was raised a Baptised (even I am independent now) I feel I can safely use this as an example)...many baptist parents will dedicate their baby to God...no baptism, just a promise to raise the child the best they can, a nice ceremoney.    But that does not mean the child is a Christian or even a Baptist...it just means that the parents, the Pastor and the members of that local church has promised before God to help raise that child (in) a Christian atmispher until he/she is old enough to understand about Christ and Salvation and decide for themself (if) they will repent and be baptized thus becoming a Christian.    As for living together with out being married...    HERE IN THIS FORUM: let me just say this...    AS A CHRISTIAN: to just move in together and start living as husband and wife is wrong (This falls back to sex without marriage) what is the difference if you live together and have sex or each live somewhere else and then get together to have sex? SEX BEFORE MARRIAGE IS SEX BEFORE MARRIAGE...    Remember I am talking about Christians...if you have not accepted Christ then you can do what you want good or bad and it makes no difference...you will not spend eternity with Christ....|`|Sy9XGcl8aa	Do the best you can and all you need to do to repent is apologize to God you say you pray everyday? good. As long as you dont do it again is fine.Things happen we make mistakes. we often find out wat we will do, by doing what we will not do. i found myself in a similar situation not the whole anal things but i felt really bad bout something i did. But if you read your bible it clearly says that he will forgive and thats all that matters really thats what i think read  Isaiah 55:7-9  Jesus does not think like us.     you seem very sincere and like you have a good heart. As long as you dont do it again okay? and who am i to say if you will go to hell. But think about it. If you where convinced you where would you ask that question?    IF you need anything or would like to talk bout this or anything i have said email me okay!     good luck  oh and no guy should ever pressure you to do ANYTHIng you dont want. if they really care for you they would respect your wishes.  and you will be forgiven for any sin except for blasphamy against the holy ghost but thats a wHOLE diff story

wRBfUgI2aa	The answer to the question is found at 2 Timothy 3:1, 5.    "But know this, that in the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here. .....having a form of godly devotion but proving false to its power; and from these turn away."    Yes, they ALL claim to be Christians.  Just claiming does not make it so.    1Corinthians 1:10 is where it says we must all speak in agreement.  While Jesus says at John 13:35 his people would be known by the love among themselves.  This principled kind of love would also lead to something else.  Philippians 1:9 shows,  "And this is what I continue praying, that YOUR love may abound yet more and more with accurate knowledge and full discernment;."    Today, you can drive down a 5 mile road and see 3 churches of the same faith teaching different things.  That is not unity.  Neither is joining in the world's wars which kill those of the same faith as yours, just on the other side.    Clearly the problem with Christians you describe is being false Christians.  Not following Christ in the way his Father approves.    The most obvious way is to find the one religion without divisions where ever in the world they are teaching the same thing.  Also those that do not kill one another, most obviously in wars.  Following the Bible closely is just as important.  That is what is right with Christians.|`|OoH6VG7haa	yes I have long ago before I grew up...

However, if any argument comes up about religion.  In the book of James says we fight and argue because of the struggle within us, which is lust.....  another thing you have to remember, not every person who say that he is a christian is a mature one.  When I looked back at some of the past things in my life as a believer, I have to shake my head in shame, to think that I used to think and say and do the things I once did; but thank God for the blood and the grace of Jesus Christ I am maturing every day as I stay in pray, the word and fasting.

We should always be ready to give an answer for the hope that is within us but it's not up to us to beat someone over the head with the Bible. Discussions are fine and we are to present the Bible "as is" but if the person that we are speaking too becomes contentious then we shake off the dust from our shoes and move on. The seed has still been planted regardless.     Titus 3:9-11   "But avoid foolish controversies and genealogies and strife and disputes about the Law, for they are unprofitable and worthless. 10 Reject a factious man after a first and second warning, 11 knowing that such a man is perverted and is sinning, being self-condemned."|`|Yl5biTQXaa	"Do you see how silly that sounds?"

He gives us free will to cooperate with Him, serve Him, and thus liberate ourselves from material existence, or ignore Him, and deeply implicate ourselves in the reactions of karma .Homosexuality comes as a result of a male associating sexually excessively with women, not only from this life, but previous lives. One develops a pre-disposition . Whatever we focus upon expands.  According to Mathuresa Dasa : "Changing partners only adds more fuel to the fire of sex desire, forcing frustrated individuals to seek further alternatives. If more sex with more partners proves dissatisfying, then what next? Well, how about changing the kind of partner? How about bisexuality, homosexuality, bestiality, incest? Get the sexual fire hot enough, and anything goeseven child abuse."    The oldest reference to homosexuality comes from the Srimad Bhagavatam which is over 5000 years old :    Lord Brahma, approaching the Lord, addressed Him thus: My Lord, please protect me from these sinful demons, who were created by me under Your order. They are infuriated by an appetite for sex and have come to attack me.  PURPORT  It appears here that the homosexual appetite of males for each other is created in this episode of the creation of the demons by Brahma. In other words, the homosexual appetite of a man for another man is demoniac and is not for any sane male in the ordinary course of life.    >>> Ref. VedaBase => SB 3.20.26    The 'homosexual revolution' is a publicists' game. Do you think the Meida is reporting the average person's feelings? They're pushing atheistic materialism, that's all. And one of their current ploys is the 'homosexual revolution. Actually, they should call it the 'homosexual revulsion. Most homosexuals -- and heterosexuals who've forgotten procreation and turned sex into a sensual game -- are inwardly in agony, because they know they've smeared excrement all over their spiritual identity.                            |`|5BoZsFesaa	A Human God created the myth of a gay gene..|`|rz4AUvbaaa	Go one step further with the line of questioning and you arrive at, "what kind of a god creates with a substance that ages and then comes to a halt, known as death, a loving god?"    The human reality is not God's reality.  If it were He would be awfully tired of hearing human suggestions as they die one by one at an incredible rate.  It boils down to this.  Something is a lie, either God or the mortal, material seeming consciousness that we experience in this age.  The serpent is subtle and goes undetected as many are in sympathy with it.|`|A1kcSX3Zaa	That same God created the straight gene.

I have the genetic tendency toward alcoholism, thanks to my parents and grandparents.  I choose not to drink.      Genetics doesn't force you to do anything, it just makes it a little harder to resist.      God will purify us like a silversmith purifies silver.  He does that by holding us over the fire until all of our impurities are burned out and his reflection is in the metal.  Doesn't sound like a walk in the park, does it?|`|7d647be57724929a656a84a04d156140aa	You know that there is no gay gene.

Then read Genesis 19:7-8; Romans 1:26 and Timothy 1:10.|`|Rt4bJfVAaa	What are you talkiing about?      Get this. The Bible says we are all sinners.  And you can find a gene for all kinds of sins.  Doesn't matter. In fact if anything it shows how man succumbs to sin.  Do we say because a person has a homosexual tene then he will always be homosexual?  So now if we can find a killer gene.  Do we look for that and discover that.  Do we say a killer has rights and he is not accountable for his actions to other people?    Get off this gene problem.  The Bible already says all have sinned and have come short of the glory of God.  If a person is a homosexual it is because he is born in sin.  And he still needs to repent and ask God to forgive him.  So he can be free of his sin.   And homosexuality is not the worst sin there is.   There is adultry, lying, stealing, killing, greed, hypocrisy,wife and child abuse.   Think about that.  A 2,000 year old book describes this very thing today.  Yes it's good that man has discovered genes for certain problems.  But now the question is if it is a bad gene.  What is the solution to cure the person of his problem?    But God does not want anyone to die in the state of sin that is the natural man.  Instead God is willing to make all people new creatures in Jesus Christ.  He can change the old sinful nature and make it new and holy so that you can feel like a child again that is pure and innocent.       Edut.

God didnt create anything to be detrimental, and if he did, it would be a test to see who can beat their own weak, trust me not everyone who has homosexual desires practice them, how can you explain those men who practice this sort of lifestyle then miraculously stop it? Didn't they claim they were born with this mental ailment?    Science is biased, if they found such a thing it would only be to tell people that it's okay, if you can't do gene assignment, I would suggest that you take the knowledge with a grain of salt.    Get smart, seek Gods word, know that he is true love. Their are movies all over the net that tell you who God really is, He is a God of love not Hate, don't allow others to confuse you.

Uh oh, RETARD ALERT!!! RETARD ALERT!  Prove it. I'm sure that many homosexuals come from good parents. It's your sexual prefrence and you can't change it. One can also say the same thing about you and god. You didn't get love from your father so you look through via god.    I don't know about any "gay gene". But your sexual preference is part of your chemical makeup kinda. You can't change it.    And guess what, It IS okay to be gay, just like it's okay to be black or a red head. It's not a choice either, try choosing your sexual prefrence sometime. Get your head out of your fat asses and deal with it.

They are influenced by things we watch and hear.  Watching shows like Buffy the Vampire slayer puts thoughts into your mind that can appear in your dreams, for example.    Now about the family's reaction.  If they are shocked, then you should realize that they do not have sufficient understanding of the Holy Scriptures - Holy Bible and what it contains or such things would not shock them.    About your dream, the sword is the sword of truth that is talked about in the Bible.  Use a concordance to look up the word sword in the Bible to see how it is used.    As for the demon, you cannot slay a demon, only God has the power.  But you can bind a demon so that it cannot come around or harm you.  That is also in the Bible.  Please look up scriptures to see which ones promise that ability to believers/God's followers.      Considering those promises that are in the Bible that permit believers to do certain things like bind the devil or force him to leave in any situation, this is not a gift unique to you or any one person.  It is a gift that all believers have, if they have faith - that is if they believe what God has promised to be true and act upon those promises.

Ephesians 6:12  Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of His might. 11 Put on the full armor of God, so that you will be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil. 12 For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places. 13 Therefore, take up the full armor of God, so that you will be able to resist in the evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm. 14 Stand firm therefore, HAVING GIRDED YOUR LOINS WITH TRUTH, and HAVING PUT ON THE BREASTPLATE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS, 15 and having shod YOUR FEET WITH THE PREPARATION OF THE GOSPEL OF PEACE; 16 in addition to all, taking up the shield of faith with which you will be able to extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. 17 And take THE HELMET OF SALVATION, and the     sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.|`|15jfF0tKaa	So I would take up saying my rosary with all my heart. I would go to the cross of Jesus and ask for healing. In part also would do a sit down with a psychiatrist and very accuratly recount your reoccuring dreams.  |`|sgavSanxaa	Are you a Christian...meaning have you asked and accepted Jesus in to your heart by faith?    If so, then I can offer further possibilities to your situation, but I do not ultimately know what the dream means because it could mean a lot of things.    As Christians, we are against and always warring against the devil and his angels, I've had encounters in sleep and out of sleep with demons, but God was always there to help me.    When you picked up that sword and having it make you feel stronger, the Bible mentions that the Word of God is like a sword and is in fact stronger than a double edged sword.    So, when we as Christians speak of the Word in evangelism, where have you, then we are speaking the very words of God to strike down heresy, false doctrine, etc.    The next time that you have one of those dreams, if you have Jesus in your heart, call on Jesus and the demons have to flee, they are VERY afraid of Him because he has the power to ultimately destroy them, each and every one of them.    If you are not a Christian, still use Jesus' name and tell me what happens next.    Good day Bambi.    I hope this has helped you, if not, feel free to contact my friend Shane @ captainunload@yahoo.com and tell him that Ricky referred you to him.    God Bless You!

AA10285707	I respect Muslims very much because of their core beliefs. Muslims are so diversified it's hard to speak in general terms.  Islam is great, not all Muslims follow it the same way.

He encourages his followers to do good stuff and avoid bad stuff.    So, what's wrong with them?  I think the same thing that is wrong with Christians.  I'm not sure, but  I think they believe that if you are not a muslim, you are condemned, just like Christians believe if you are not a Christian, you are condemned.      Religions like the Native North American religion or Buddhism are much kinder, with fewer inherent flaws.  North American Natives respect  Mother Earth....we could have learned a lot if we had listened.....    And Buddhism still preaches doing good and not doing bad, be the best you can be etc...but it also accepts other religions, rather than condemning them.....

I mean, he could just appear in the sky and tell us stuff, and then there would be no question, right?  "Hey, Harvey, abortion is WRONG! Didn't you hear God last Tuesday?"    Instead, he leaves us alone to figure stuff out for ourselves.  And he gives us the curiosity and the intelligence to learn by ourselves.  It's that intelligence that makes us unique, that separates us from the animals and plants.  Obviously he WANTS us to figure stuff out, to make up our own minds.    I love the Bible, just as a collection of ancient literature, but it is no help in telling us what to believe.  Read it for yourself and you'll see.  People who believe stuff learn it not from the Bible but from what others tell them about the Bible.    God will forgive you if you make mistakes because making mistakes is human.  He designed us that way.  We ALL make mistakes!  That's how we learn.  Obviously he wants us to learn.    There's no such thing as Hell.  Who could do enough damage in one lifetime to deserve to spend ETERNITY in punishment?  Let alone just for not believing something.  You can't believe stuff that you don't find believable, you can only -say- you believe it.  Do you think that's what God expects of you, to PRETEND to believe stuff because someone tells you you're supposed to believe it?    We believe in God because it's wired into us.  People have always seemed to have a need to believe in something bigger than ourselves.  It's human nature. And there's nothing wrong with it, so long as you don't fall into the trap of believing that YOUR beliefs are the only -true- ones, and that your true beliefs entitle you to some special rights or privileges.|`|ITnQEUQTaa	Wow - that's a lot of questions in one ....  I'd stop drinking coffee if I was you!    No you will not go to hell because there is no such thing.  The bible is not a manual- it is a collection of early myths and stories told by the peoples of the middle east.

Not religion, beliefs, political party, skin color... just sin. We are all in that boat, because we have all sinned.    God does not send anyone to hell. However he does send a Savior to rescue us from hell.    Hell was intended for Satan and his daemons, to quarantine sin. Satan decided to take as many of Gods creation, made in Gods image with him as possible.    God from the beginning of time devised a plan to save us by sending His perfect Son to rescue us from hell.    Sin always tries to get in the way, keeping us from God. Christ perfect sacrifice cleanses our sin so we can live eternally, with God, like in the beginning. His salvation is available to all. No restrictions or exceptions. It is those who reject Christ's work of salvation who restrict Christ through their beliefs.    So you see, it is we and our sin that condemns us to hell, not God. The entire plan, laid out in the Bible,  is His manual to reveal His rescue plan.    Like any gift, receiving the gift and belief(faith) in the gifts value is required if the recipient is to benefit from it. God is not going to force anyone to receive his gift, but the gift is freely available non the less.    Acts 13:38  "Therefore, my brothers, I want you to know that through Jesus the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you.    John 3:16For God so greatly loved and dearly prized the world that He [even] gave up His only begotten ([a]unique) Son, so that whoever believes in (trusts in, clings to, relies on) Him shall not perish (come to destruction, be lost) but have eternal (everlasting) life.|`|Vs0PQbG3aa	Those are a bunch of unanswerable questions that no one Truly has the answer to. If you want my opinion though:    I don't think you are going to hell because I don't believe in hell, god, or sin for that matter. I believe people do wrong things, but i don't' like the word sin. I've always wondered... what happened to christians being accepting of everyone. You're allowed to ask questions and be open minded but as soon as you do, all those other people pounced.

I think that is just some horror story people tell to little children so they can be good. Like the boogeyman.|`|KclUlBw1aa	You won't go to hell either way. Kind of like why you can't go to the gods kingdom on top of Mt. Olympus. It doesn't exist.    Just like God.    The bible is much less than a manual. It's a blatant lie, and a contradictory source for information on anything.    They believe because they're afraid of life as it truly is, and because of indoctrination. Life without an external purpose imposed on it seems pointless to them, and that's scary. What they don't realize is that the purpose YOU give your life is more important than the purpose anyone else (including some god) can give it.    Hell, if it were real, would be either brimstone and fire, or reliving all your sins over and over, or having to watch Star Trek 24/7, depending on who you ask.    The Grim Reaper is too cool for God. The Grim Reaper is the idea of death personified. The Grim Reaper was created to personify peoples fear of death, and give them a common enemy. Now-a-days, the idea of the Grim Reaper has been romanticized, though that was not always the case.    If God were real, then you would think so. However, the bible tells you that he won't even forgive your childrens childrens childrens children for something you did wrong, so why would he forgive you, but not them?    Hope this helps clear things up.

God does exist without question.  The bible has been proven and is still being proven by every discovery of science, archaeology, etc.  Just the universe alone proves the existence of a creator.  Nothing in this universe came about by random chance, that has never been proven, nor has evolution for that matter.    I believe in God for many reasons:  The complexities of the universe beg for a grand designer, science and archaeological finds have proven the bibles accuracy over and over again, God is love and loves all of His creation.  Hell in the bible is called Hades (or the place not seen from here).  Hades is seperated into two sections by a great trench.  You can find this description when Jesus is telling the story of the rich man and Lazarus in one of the gospels (sorry I dont remember which).  One side is Abrahams Bosom which is where Old Testament saints (or righteous people) went after they died it is a place of peace until Christ returns.  The other side of Hades is said to have flames and is a place where the unbelievers are tormeted by flames as well as the knowledge of never being with God.  There is also Tartarus which is mentioned only in 2 Peter 2:4 and this is where some of the fallen angels are bound in chains of darkness.  God is not the grim reaper but the righteous judge.    God will forgive you and all sinners when they do wrong.  Thats why Jesus died on the cross, to forgive all of mankind their sins.  Jesus said "those who are well dont need a physician but those who are sick." He also said "I have not come to condemn but to bring the sinner to repentance."  |`|pL0kPtXSaa	 yes ,yes,no,because he first loved them,the bible says there is gnashing of teeth,fiery pit.God is God 'The great I am''he will forgive you of your sins if you accept his son Jesus as your salvation,being washed in the blood of Jesus.|`|NLi51W1Saa	the most dependant thing on going to hell or not is getting saved, if your saved, your going to heaven, but you still have to answer for your sins that you have not asked for foregiveness for. god does exist, just because you dont see him doesnt mean he's not there, he works in mysterious ways. the bible is gods word and you should live by it. people belive in him because they have gotten saved and seen what he has done for them. you have to give him a chance. he is not like the grim reaper. he will without a doubt forgive you if you ask for him to.  hope that helped|`|NjnU2DVWaa	Something you should watch is ...http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muuKV0mEs...

It has to do why God is sending practically everybody to Hell...  That is if you believe what the Bible says...    Regardless of any free will the Bible GOD COULD HAVE PREVENTED Eve from touching a fruit from the tree of knowledge of GOOD AND EVIL simply because GOD IS LOVE and Eve HAD NO KNOWLEDGE AT ALL that it was EVIL to touch this fruit! She wanted to know! Unlike Satan, God wants to keep people gullible! She saw that the fruit was good to eat and she ate it in all her innocence!!! She probably thought that God was wrong again! God already admitted that he was wrong for creating man alone! So God created Eve, too as an afterthought! And Eve ate from the forbidden fruit WITH A CLEAR CONSCIENCE AND CLEAN HANDS. She had no knowledge that the Serpent was EVIL, either! Nobody told her and she wouldnt know anyway!    The Bible writers created an original whimsical God who loves to kill and hurt people to satisfy his unique orgasmic craving for justice and holiness. Almost immediately after God created Heaven one third of the angels rebelled on the spot! The rebel angels were not evicted from Heaven, but they became known as demons. They will be evicted from Heaven during the Tribulation of the last days. So God already had Satan and Hell set up before Eve ever touched the forbidden fruit! The Bible God didnt have a single Guardian Angel available to watch over EVE to protect her and NOT ONLY HER, but the WHOLE HUMAN RACE from going to Hell, but God set up a flaming sword moving back and forth to protect the Tree of Life so no matter how much free will Adam and Eve may have had they couldnt touch it. God couldnt care less about humanity going to Hell, but he doesnt want anybody to live for ever at least in Genesis!      God PREVENTED any assassin from killing Cain no matter how much free will he/she thought to have! God could have done something similar to protect Eve from touching the forbidden fruit unless it was a set up!    Regardless of any free will that is not even mentioned in the Bible (free will is a rather recent idea) God personally intervened and PREVENTED that the Heathen King Abimelech had sex with Abrahams sister/wife/hooker Sarah so King Abimelech wouldn't sin against God"! God himself (NOT A GUARDIAN ANGEL) was present in the Kings Royal Bedroom to PREVENT a questionable sexual activity that King Abimelech might have enjoyed with Sarah!* *(BTW Abimelech means my Dad is [God] Moloch) But the Bible God or a Guardian Angel is nowhere to be seen near Eve or Gods untouchable fruit tree to prevent that the WHOLE HUMAN RACE that he loves so much go to be tormented for ever and ever in a sulfuric burning Lake of Fire!  That is gross negligence sanctioned in any court of law in the world! It doesnt take too many neurons in anybodys brain to figure out that the Bible writers were a bunch of perverts creating a God so full of Holy Crap!     Genesis 20:2-6 and there Abraham said of his wife Sarah, "She is my sister."* (*incest [inbreeding] was ALLOWED, COMMANDED and ENFORCED all along WHEN CONVENIENT by Gods Holy Law [Numbers 36:8]!) Then Abimelech king of Gerar sent for Sarah and took her. But God came to Abimelech IN A DREAM ONE NIGHT* (*only God knows how many nights he was already watching him perform in his royal bedroom!) and said to him, "You are as good as dead because of the woman you have taken; she is a married woman.* (*it would have been perfectly OK with God if Sarah had no husband!) Now Abimelech had not gone near her* (*at least that night), so he said, "Lord, will you destroy an innocent nation?* (*God and this Heathen king discuss National Security issues in a dream!!! Too bad CNN was not there to interview the king!) Did he not say to me, `She is my sister,' and didn't she also say, `He is my brother'?* (*can you imagine this holy man of God handing over his horny sister/wife Sarah without any objections for the unrestricted sexual pleasure of this Heathen king? BTW, Abraham already pimped his sister the same way before to the king of Egypt and he came out it filthy rich out of it!) I HAVE DONE THIS WITH A CLEAR CONSCIENCE AND CLEAN HANDS."* (*just like EVE did!) Then God said to him in the dream, "Yes, I know you did this with a CLEAR CONSCIENCE* (*as long as you do it with a clear conscience and clean hands you cant possibly commit a sexual sin against this Bible God!), and so I have kept you from sinning against me. That is why I did not let you touch her.* (*Christians tell you that this God very apologetically prevented Sarah from having sex with this Heathen king because she was going to be one of the ancestors of Jesus Christ! But this same God didnt provide the same kind of anti-sin protection with so many other lecherous ancestors of Jesus!)      Can you imagine the Bible God Creator of this humongous Universe peeping-tom into your own bedroom to find out what kind of sexual activities you are performing tonight? BUT HE IS SO NAIVE NOT WATCHING EVE or doing anything like setting up an angel with a flaming sword flashing back and forth like he did around the tree of life TO PREVENT EVE from eating of the forbidden fruit tree! Obviously he is either very incompetent or he is a sadistic peeping tom pervert and ought to be put in jail!    Compare the story of King Abimelech and Sarah to the story of King David and Bathsheba King David and Bathsheba committed adultery of the kinkiest sort! She was a married woman. After Bathsheba was done having sex with King David she was probably drenched in royal sperm so she took a shower to "purify herself and be clean (2 Sam 11:4). She became pregnant, too with a baby boy while God was delighted to watch them performing in bed! No sin here because God planned for Bathsheba to be the ancestor of Jesus Christ and she was a go|`|6nrBpd64aa	How can you go to a place that isn't?  The bible is just a book.

YES  Does God exist? YES  Isn't the just a bible a manual? NO  Why do people believe in him? Because God is our creator and saviour  What is hell like? REALLY BAD, Torture, agaony never ending  Is God the Grim Reaper? No  Will God forgive me if I do something wrong? Yes if you have faith and repent.    I encourage you to find a good church in your area. Go in the phone book. Call a few of them in the middle of the week and ask if they have a bible basic course, or leave a message and a number and time to call back. They will get back to you. No pressure.    Many Bible basic classes go for a several weeks, one may be two week nights a weeks. Some will be Sunday bible studies but you want a A-Z bible basics, know nothing about Bible.    These Bible basic classes are free and it will answers all your questions. THERE WILL BE NO STRINGS ATTACHED. They will not harass you or come to your house.     Why should I tell you about God? Let God talk to you direct. Even academic scholars, not religious people, people who study history, archeology, sociology, science and philosophy regonize that the Bible is an important book from historical standpoint and is very accurate in many respects.     Sure the miricles and faith part is BY FAITH. You can not prove or disprove God.     However physicist and astronomers that study the universe are often left with the feeling that something GREATER than an accident created everything. These are SCIENTEST that don't let God get into their science, but often run up into the prospect that things are too ordered and too perfect, they defy science. One answer is of course another force or a designer, creator. They don't use the word God.      DO IT FOR KNOWLEGE.    The power of God is through his words and the holy spirits works for it. I think you will find it interesting and find a lot of wisdom even if you don't become a church member. Shop around and talk to a few churches in your area and talk to the pastor. I am partial to Lutheran (WELS or ELS), however Baptist are good. The reason I suggest these is because they are most STRIPPED down. There is less bells and whistles (dogma or theology of the church), more pure word of God less about what that particular group believes or their interpretation. Catholic has the most bells and whistles and would no recommend them for Bible basics.     Again bible basics is not Sunday school; it is an adult short course, casual discussion of the bible from Genesis to Revelations, old and new testament's. Of course the Bible is so complex and people spend thier life studying it, but this will give you a GOOD feel for the Bible.|`|ln6H934faa	Yes if you don't believe in God you will go to Hell.    God is the Alpha and Omega the beginning and end, he does exist and he is everything.  The Bible is not just a manual.  It is the inspired word of God and it teaches us what we need to do to become a christian.  I believe in God because I know that there is proof all around us that He is real.    Hell is a horrible place, it will be dark and there will gnashing of teeth and weeping.  Just imagine stepping into the hottest fire and not being able to ever leave.  That's a place I never want to be.  God will forgive you if you do something wrong but first you must have salvation.  The steps of salvation are.      Hear - Romans 10:17 So then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God.    Believe - Hebrews 11:6 6 And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.    Confess - Matthew 10:32 Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven.    Repent - Acts 3:19 Repent therefore, and turn again, that your sins may be blotted out,    Be Baptized - Mark 16:16 He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned. Also read 1st Peter 3:20-21 because they formerly did not obey, when God's patience waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were brought safely through water. 21. Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ. This verse clearly shows baptism as a crucial step of salvation.    Lead a christian life - Hebrew 10 25-26 Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching. For if we sin willfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,  So as we can see from the verse above we must also go to worship God and fellowship with other Christians.  Matthew 7:21-23 21Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.  22Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?  23And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.  We have to obey ALL of Gods words not just what we pick and choose. 1st John 2:3-4 And by this we know that we have come to know him IF we keep his commandments. 4. Whoever says "I know him" but does not keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him.

Romans 3:23 "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God"    Your biggest thing to learn about life is just because everyone else is doing something don't make it right. But this not something that you should beat up on yourself about. Just don't let kissing lead to anything else. Hold out on sex and wait for God to send you who he wants you to have, "Be a peach out of reach, and a plum that ain't giving up none."|`|4p6ciV3aaa	Naw I don't believe it is. It ain't sex yet.|`|WTPziKSyaa	I'm not sure what sin it is but I think it could be one.  thats soo funny cause last weekend was my dance and i was grinding too and i couldnt help but wonder if it was a sin|`|da8fiXGZaa	Pray.    Kissing in itself is not a sin, but be sure to avoid lust.|`|y6SEfINYaa	well think of things this way, would you have done it if Jesus was standing next to you? Maybe the grinding was a bit much, not the kissing part though|`|rGn0MO1Faa	Why would God give desires if not to act upon them? Does he punish the desires he so freely give? If so, he is indeed evil.    Enjoy yourself and be happy, if there is such a thing as a benevolent intervening God or gods or Goddess or goddesses then surely your happiness would be his/her/their prime goal.    Your punishment and condemnation would not even be on the table.|`|6Q4xh4F1aa	Kissing in itself is no sin.  However depending on your denomination you may be judged sinful for the grinding.  It is wrong for men to judge others, but church people seem to like doing a lot of that.  Not all, but a great majority of the churches I have been to (Jehovah's Witnesses in particular) are VERY judgemental in stark disobedience to the Bible I might add.    Be careful, sweetheart.|`|O1QBA5XSaa	Grinding is the only questionable thing.  Only because it gives guys the wrong idea.  You're just dancing, but he has other things going on in his mind.    Do you have an older sister or an older female member of your church that you feel comfortable talking about this kind of stuff with?  You can email me if you want, but I recommend talking to someone you trust.    Boys are out for one thing.  Just keep that in mind.|`|bce49af4b285a96d81e7186b9e756de9aa	lust is a big no-no    that's kind of the core of it. if you had lust (or still do) get rid of it. it's oozing with sin |`|d08rkYlpaa	The only sin is in harm. If nobody was harmed or could be harmed by your actions, then no sin was committed.   Mind you, I'm not saying you didn't do something wrong - if you were kissing and groping this boy when you never expected to keep him as a BF, or you have a different BF, etc. that would be a sin. Teasing is a terrible thing to do...|`|uAMzmAwaaa	i would say that you were probably getting pretty close to that line.... there is nothing wrong with dancing or kissing but i would have to say grinding is going a little too far...|`|7d647be57724929a656a84a04d156140aa	Are you a follower or a leader?

Just remember sin is always going to feel good because it's what you want.  The devil will give you all of your desires if you neglect the love of God and neglect His commandments.  But I would be more concerned of where I spend eternity than my pleasures in this short life.|`|NLi51W1Saa	this is a tough one, i would just pray about it just in case:)|`|MEny7pBHaa	wow... high school has gotten pretty unashamed since my day. it is supposed to feel good, it is meant to, but in the right confines. kissing is the spark that ignites the inferno of sexual intimacy. no it wasn't a sin to kiss and grind, but those things lead to further events that could be classified as sinful unless of course you have espoused your body to another before God in sacred union.|`|ehrWPRjwaa	There's nothing wrong with kissing as long as you can maintain willpower and self-control.  Grinding is probably crossing the line.  As innocent as it may seem, it *is* a sexual act.  It alludes to intercourse and can cause you and your date to lust -- and lust is a sin.    If something is going to lead you to disobey God, its best not to do it.  I wouldn't beat yourself up over it, but just remember for future reference that it might give guys the wrong idea about what you're interested in.

Read his word daily, study his word daily, pray continuninly for and through all things. Mediate on his word so they are burned into your heart.    As for the husband: try asking God to prepare you to be the wife your future husband will need and to prepare him to be your husband for which you will need. Let it go and trust it will happen when you least except it.|`|gpwI2sbvaa	Jump|`|azq1win0aa	Jesus is the only way to God, You have to believe Jesus existed, That you are a sinner, that Jesus died for your sins, repent of your sins and turn from them(stop sinning, the sins you are actively participating in) then you can pray to God and ask him for a husband but ask according to God's will for you. This is the only way to be close to God, this was his only plan so that we could talk to him and have a relationship with him, any other way is pointless. |`|4068ddb702bdc41558e963e223abc40eaa	"Be still and know that I am God."

This is what God tells us to do.     1 Thessalonians 5:17 Pray without ceasing.    Study your Bible daily.     2 Timothy 2:15 Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.    Do everything for the glory of God.     1 Corinthians 10:31 Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.    Praise and thank the Lord daily.     Ephesians 5:20 Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;|`|KcAehrrKaa	As much as I always hope that God will help in that sense, I think praying is a form of keeping faith.

Some people say being close to God is by going to church and reading your bible but to me i think it's just having faith. If you just became a christian you should read the book of John 1 in the bible. it explains alot! If your a teenager or a young adult i'd encourage getting involved in a youth group at church because thats what i did and ive met so many amzing people that i look up to that have taught me so much about God. i hope this helped!|`|BgxM6Hv9aa	I would say choose one or the other, if you really want to be closer to God you will choose God over your great husband.

He will lead you to where He wants you to go if you TRUST Him!     Ask for wisdom, guidance, and strength!     But the most important way to growing closer to God is reading your Bible!!!

They say that when you read the Bible, you can hear God's voice more clearly.  But not literally.  I kind of forget the whole story. x3  Regardless, reading the Bible helps you get closer to God.  You'll find out why once you start reading it more.  Or you can ask this same question to a local pastor or preacher. :3  Best of luck, hun!|`|kHaSKkQtaa	Go to church. Read the bible every day.

Several years ago during one of her many appearances on the Montel Williams show, Browne told the parents of missing child Shawn Hornbeck that their son was dead. His body, she said, would be found in a wooded area near two large boulders...    ...According to a spokesman for the Hornbeck family, following the Montel broadcast Browne tried to get money from the family: She called Pam and Craig about one month after the show and pretty much offered her services to continue their discussion for a fee. Pam was that desperate that if she had had $700 in her bank account she would have put it on the table. We are talking about a mother who would have sold her soul to have her boy back.    In fact, Hornbeck and another boy were found very much alive January 16, 2007, in the home of Michael Devlin, a Missouri man accused of kidnapping them. Hornbeck had been missing for four years, but his parents had not given up hope of finding him despite Brownes misinformation. |`|7d647be57724929a656a84a04d156140aa	She is a phony and who cannot see that then.....????|`|AaKZekyRaa	Yes, she is a fake and she is not helping anyone overcome their grief.

Love, be bless.|`|YNIcVaQoaa	 As 1 Corinthians 1:18 says, "For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God" (NKJV).  |`|LJHOAZYbaa	i am a christian, and i am not like that but i absolutly know what your talking about!  the sheltered sons of bitches that think anyone that dosnt fit they're perfect expectations they deserve to burn in hell. i hate the fuckups that are like that|`|dYOpKvOCaa	Can I remind you that we where all in the same boat at some point or other.

God makes it so easy and we disobey him. you may not like to believe that satan and hell exist but dude its true. you can deny it all you want but it wont prevent the outcome of not trusting in God.|`|IkS3sx6maa	God's Truth:    (1) Everyone goes to hell when we die.  Hell does not burn.  It is just the grave.  No one has been to heaven.  Christ said so.      (2) Some people do relish the idea of people burning in hell, and that is sick.  No one should be relished to hell unless he makes a concerted effort to be unrepentant.    (3) Many of us "Christians" have been taught false traditions since the days of the first apostasy of the true church of god centuries ago.    (4) Halloween, Easter, Birthdays, Anniversaries, New Years and Christmas are all Pagan holidays that are not accepted by God.    (5) Atheists vs. "Christians":  the blind leading the blind. Pointless fighting.     Look again at God's true words and see what HE said about HIS laws and HIS true gospel, not the ones we grew up believing.      I'd start here and read along with the bible: |`|pTVIeQsZaa	If you are using the Westboro Baptist church of Topeka, Kansas as your example of Christians being evil....I would have to say you are right.    The bible teaches Christians that the one true way to God is through Jesus. What does that say about LDS (Mormons) and Jews?     Some would also argue that we are living a hell on earth. Could it get any worse than this? Maybe, maybe not...|`|DR2LJV2Eaa	I explain you. No better the Word of God    1 Corinthians 1:18 (NASB95)   18 For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.     1 Corinthians 1:23 (NASB95)   23 but we preach Christ crucified, to Jews a stumbling block and to Gentiles foolishness, |`|vaKpWe6kaa	You know the reason i said I cant wait till you go to hell is because so you can be proven wrong. That is also going to be a very sad thing too when you do. |`|AA10024194	Thanks for calling me Evil, We love you too.    Yea, I know what your talking about. TIP: Tell them you Love them too and carry on. Expose their own hypocrisy instead of telling them they are hypocrites.|`|PgORFUi1aa	Couldn't agree with you more!|`|vAbATcTcaa	who are you talking about?  I don't believe true catholics are like that at all. so if you would rephrase your questions to say all non catholic christians,  to differentiate the two.  Many good catholics spend their lives praying, making sacrafices for conversions, many catholics go to daily mass and offer their graces received from the Eucharist for "others"  No catholic, actually "wants" anyone to go to hell. Why? Because they love Jesus, who suffered and was tortued for love of sinners , since Jesus loves them so much, they cannot help but also love who and what their Lord loves. So they pray hard to save sinners from hell, also we believe in the message of Jesus given by Mary at Fatima in 1917, calling us to pray and make sacrafices to save sinners from hell. Saying many go to hell out of sins of the flesh are the multitudes falling into hell from this sin, as she said this was the reason most went to hell. so, please, don't blame catholics for our non catholic brothers for their lack of love to their neighbor. Catholics "Know, they are obligated to love their neighbor" protestants (the ones you know, have not got this revelation as yet) to love.
QS4P4axgaa	No, hell does not exist|`|1TYZDRUqaa	The commandment should read, THOU SHALL NOT DO MURDER.  Self Defense is not murder.  There is a fine line legally speaking between self defense and murder.  If you shoot someone who is running away from you after robbing you, you have no grounds to claim self defense, as your life was not in immediate danger.  If you shot the guy while he was holding a knife or gun at you (or someone else), then you have defended yourself.  You cannot kill some one in the act of running from you and get away with it.  |`|p6wwiQG3aa	IS JESUS YOUR LORD      that defines where you go.|`|9mLOH7bpaa	Go where?

Murder is the act of taking a human life without cause. |`|fUDlbOP0aa	no  he should be more worried about if he gets tried for murder if he shot guy in a state like california, which makes all legal gun owners like criminals.

It's only obvious. |`|hwGUthV2aa	No, because HELL is a make believe land.    Secondly and most importantly you need to stop associating with this person you call a friend for they hang around some shady characters and you do NOT NEED to be involved with people who put you in the position to have to kill others!|`|EvGLQbVfaa	If you kill someone in self defense, I doubt you will go to hell. God would probably prefer you don't kill them, though, and just shoot them in the leg or something so they can't kill you but you don't kill them. That would be better than killing them. If they're holding a gun, aim for the hand with the gun, if they have a knife, just shoot their leg so they fall down. If they don't fall down, shoot their other leg. If they still don't fall down, shoot their shoulder or something. Just keep shooting them until they fall, but try your hardest not to kill them.|`|HqsiNMf2aa	It really depends on a lot of things.    However, I would say not automatically. God does not condemn those who fight honestly in war (soldiers honorably serving their country and leaders). If the situation is unavoidable and un-provoked, I don't think you will have given yourself a one way ticket to hell. |`|7d647be57724929a656a84a04d156140aa	No, he wouldn't, but I don't think that he should be walking with a gun, because he could really hurt someone and get himself in trouble with the law. That's like taking the law in his hands, he should go to he police and make a report, so in the event that it happens another time, he has a report inside.|`|xF8TvlhYaa	You know cow is sacred for Hindus.

OKAY(!!!) if you or anybody else did it in their past and then later repented and got Saved, they will go to heaven.

I'm not a pro. at any of this but I can tell you my opinion which is IF he isn't saved, don't preach to your friend b/c they'll be annoyed and you'll PUSH them away, as I said.

wsoj5vLcaa	You forgot to mention that the only part of the bible that mentions homosexuality contains a bunch of other mandates which are completely ignored by Christians. If Christians are to deny homosexuality, they need to first throw away all of their clothes made from blended fabrics and stop eating pork and shellfish.|`|7d647be57724929a656a84a04d156140aa	It's up to you or anyone to believe what they want to.  Whether the Bible is old or new, God is not going to change the way He feels about sin.  He hates sin and will certainly judge it, however he loves man and has made a way out from sin into eternal life by forming a personal relationship with him through His Son Jesus Christ.  Another thing, God did not make any homosexuals the Bible says that God created man in His own image and likeness and let me tell you God is no homo He is a Spirit and we must server Him in spirit and in truth.  About human rights - every man have a right to choose and God offers him a choice; God said that he should choose life.  Love, be bless.|`|DB9QbZoQaa	You have to remember The Gay lifestyle is a "lifestyle choice",  just like I choose to be a fisherman.  There is no credible evidence homosexuality is innate, period.  So why should society give them any special leeway in anything?  Human rights do exist for homosexuals; it is legal to sleep with anyone you like.  Just do not tell me I need to be tolerant of such people, i simply am not tolerant of acoholics eather.|`|yDJiiqcsaa	They can. But if you're asking why Christianity doesn't approve of it - you need to ask God.   Edit :  "Not a choice. Why would they lie ?"  Uhhh, because they want to rationalize DOING it !  Duh.  If I could announce that "God made me the way I am and the way I feel therefore it is perfectly acceptable to do it" don't you believe EVERYONE would make their own custom-made proclamation depending on what their desired whim is ?   You know they would !    "What about human rights ?" you ask ?  You have them. You have the right to use your free will to indulge your desires or deny them.  Which are you asking about ? The right in society or the right within religion ? You have both - however you don't have the right to force other people to accept YOUR values. You don't have to accept theirs.  You just want to whine and manipulate until everyone redefines Christianity to suit YOUR desire to be accepted.    You have the right within society to marry and you can. No one hunts down homosexual couples and puts them in jail. But society/religion doesn't HAVE to accept what they want either.|`|Dv1UMYqUaa	The Bible doesn't specifically say that homosexual relationships are wrong.  It only contemns sodomy, which is generally associated with homosexual males, although not every homosexual couple engages in anal sex.  Bible thumpers are reading into it all wrong, and it seriously disquiets me.  They deserve the same rights as everyone else.|`|db78dc0ce258db7b938cfce1bdc4901baa	Question: "What does the Bible say about gay marriage / same sex marriage?"    Answer: Before we look at gay marriage / same sex marriage, first we have to remember what the Bible says about homosexuality. While the Bible doesnt address the concept of gay or same sex marriage, the Bible does clearly and consistently tell us that homosexual activity is a sin (Genesis 19:1-13; Leviticus 18:22; Romans 1:26-27; 1 Corinthians 6:9). God does not create a person with homosexual desires. A person becomes a homosexual because of sin (Romans 1:24-27), and ultimately because of his or her own choice. A person may be born with a greater susceptibility to homosexuality, just as people are born with a tendency to violence and other sins. That does not excuse the person choosing to sin by giving in to their sinful desires. If a person is born with a greater susceptibility to anger / rage, does that make it right for them to give into those desires? Of course not. The same is true for homosexuality.    We also have to remember that homosexuality is just as forgivable a sin as all other sins. Gods forgiveness is just as available to a homosexual as it is to an adulterer, idol worshipper, murderer, liar, proud man, etc. Gods love and desire to save extends to homosexuals (John 3:16; Romans 5:8). God also promises the strength for victory over sin, including homosexuality, to all those who will believe in Jesus Christ for their salvation (1 Corinthians 6:11; 2 Corinthians 5:17).    To give sanction to homosexual marriage would be to give approval to that lifestyle, which the Bible clearly and consistently condemns as sinful. I believe that Christians should stand firmly against the idea of gay marriage / same sex marriage. Marriage is ordained by God to be between a man and a woman (Genesis 2:21-24; Matthew 19:4-6). Homosexual marriage is a perversion of the institution of marriage and an offense to the God who created marriage. God forbids and condemns homosexuality, so He clearly is opposed to homosexual marriage. As Christians, we are to seek to share the love of God and salvation through Christ with homosexuals. We are to be loving and kind to homosexuals, while at the same time not condoning their sinful lifestyle.|`|TBSuF2n6aa	Read Romans... Christians aren't right to judge so i dont|`|rxlxw2ZHaa	The way you asked the question and the lead-in to the question makes me think that you aren't "religious".

XPO5e7bNaa	Most of society lives in the fast lane these days. They want convenience. They want it quick and they want it now. It they don't get it, the first emotion to show is anger? Have you noticed that too? I have. Family values went out the window with the 80's. These days, no one knows when to take a minute to reflect, to be thankful for what they have, and to treat other people the way the Lord says we should treat them. With respect and dignity. If more people would turn to the Lord in their time of trouble, then maybe they would come away with a sense of morals. There is a song from the late 60's titled "Eve of Destruction". Listen to it and then you can see for yourself how even back then, people felt the way you do today. God Bless|`|ZphAhwy6aa	It is sad but true most people feel better about them selves buy looking down on others but Jesus said the most important thing was too Love one and other.Everybody is guilty at one point in there life of not forgiving and also blaming someone else for there life.You should do your best too live a life of forgiveness and bettering yourself.No matter how good of a person you are there is always room for improvement.Buy asking this question I think you are on the right road.|`|NCRfZRopaa	Yes, but one does not need God to be a better person.|`|8v40KEd0aa	 I always forgive because I want to be forgiven.

Forgiveness is not for the other person, but for the person who was wronged, so it is a release in itself.  It is a good thing to forgive.|`|u7LSohRyaa	Well, we're only human and sometimes you have to set an example for others. Basically, you can't make others be what you want.

That's sad.|`|xHcQSLiVaa	I'll forgive you for that.  Lead your life the best you can.  Treat everyone the way that you would want them to treat you.  Try never to judge your fellow man.  always look for the good in him and maybe, just maybe you will find it.  Someday we will all be held accountable for what we do and believe me, when the day comes, we will probably be our own worst judge.

Well, just try to know, whats makes God as god, the Power, isnt it? So what the power can do? Ah? Well, it can give the ability to organise all things & it can give the ability to separate everything and most importantly, the Ability to control everything, isnt it? Isnt it good? Ah? So, what I try to say here is, from my hard study and research effort with the help from god, I realized that the ability to control everything, the Power of God is gradually increased in the full amount to use so; The Power of God is always the omnipotent and existed among everything. & The God now is always the same omnipotent for us, who is organised us and we are growing towards perfection. The perfection is the final stage, not the end. & The Power of God, the Ability is the reward for us to control everything in a proper manner, like the true God of goodness. & Everlasting Happiness is the final stage. & it cannot come alone without the final stage perfection of God. & if god always perfect in perfection then there have to be beginning with God for the organizing progress of all things. So, there is No end and also No beginning for all things, including this on going organizing progress. So we cannot get anything from nothing. & how could that be possible to be perfect in perfection always, ah? No way has the perfection of god come first or the growth towards perfection. There is No End and there is No beginning and so the Ability is for the Love of Joy & ~ LOVE IS THE ABILITY ~   If you dont still agree, then note this important point: - you can use any thing for Good or Bad so, whenever possible If you ask the god for the good reason to give you the ability perfection, because of your obedience, then the God will give you, if the god is good and Almighty. Simple logical prove (the evidence) for this concept. So,   If you are humble, please... Pray to know the truth from true God by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit with great faith and. Good in Bad & Bad in Good so the values are most important. God gave us the rights to do what is right for you & sometimes, things can be right in your point of view but wrong in Public point of view so Basically, just pray about it for the Good Answer and try to do the God's will first always & If you think, why so much trouble and pain in this world? Then there is only one reason, without pain, No pleasure and without pleasure, no pain. So without them, we cannot enjoy this life so always we need them in our development towards the perfection of God. So-so you use pain and pleasure instead of pain and pleasure use you. I mean the vision of your future should be clear & it have to pull you rather than you have to push so you must link a lot of pleasure in order to succeed in the Best job. When you feel strong enough links a lot of pleasure in your subconscious mind and your desire for success should be greater than your fear of failure. & It is wonderful nature for us by the true God. And we all make mistakes so it is hard to look for star in daylight. So just in faith it is possible. Like that the faith in true God. & If you think, even expert can be wrong then you have to make the fine research in all most everything so It is hard and some time, it is impossible to achieve so Why we need inappropriate action to find the owner of higher power? So, because of Lack of faith in true God, we do not have the great gift of understanding of things. & All things are spiritually first, to govern by God with glory so closely, Have a look at this world of wonders of yours and then you know the truth, when you listen to your real voice and then Having a strong desire to do the best every day then stick with the best to do your best. And most importantly, try to be grateful for what you have now & try to know where you come from to have the great gift of understanding and then, have the faith to become the best winner in your life. & The Law of mercy cannot rob the Law of justice so Justice demands the punishment of our sin but The Law of mercy requires the forgiveness to give to us and God is perfect in perfection so cannot violate his laws so The God provided the way to our salvation to overcome our sin so Jesus Christ sacrifice is much needed to return to live with God, so Jesus Christ is our savior.  Well, It is the time to make the great decision.   Good luck.   The power is focus with the great mindset   If you are interested, Please visit to the web side http://www.mormon.org & if you find this useful, please help others.

The anti-christ is not a person but a system set up by the evil one.  There will be a leader of course in the forefront of things but as we speak the system is already in place and many people are taking the mark of the beast ignorantly.  I am sorry for any President who will be in power at this coming election, because they will be in the thick of things, but no, Obama is not and could not be anti-christ.|`|XwXRY8JCaa	the anti-christ will deceive everyone...i just dont  think it will be osama oops obama ....i think it will be a man from europe... what is up with america picking a president named barrack obama look back at all our presidents names! lol its really funny when u put his name last! |`|D7cbSxgCaa	I will pray for you.

You also believe that the end of the world will bring about peace on earth and your personal salvation.  So, if anything, you should be happy as a clam to see Obama win the election.

54d03e78f8f7d6a3e33b875f46a6abe2aa	First of all, thank you for your openness to what you're going through. The truth is, most people have/are/will gone/going/be going through what you are experiencing right now. I used to be very depressed, angry, confused, feeling incomplete, etc. I had looked everywhere for the answer to these problems. I thought that having lots of friends would cure all of this. Nope. I thought maybe alcohol would do it, but it just made the pain worse. I thought maybe having a girlfriend would be the true answer. Not true really though I have been with the same girlfriend and she does make me very happy but the relationship itself is not what filled the void I had in my life. Shortly after I started my relationship with my g/f, I had truly found what I was looking for. The answer is simply one man. That man's name is Jesus Christ. Ever since I accepted him as my savior, my heart had made a complete change, not right away but over time and through Him I had found ways on how to deal with different situations. You may be saying "Well, he's not for me." or "Well maybe it worked for you but it won't for me." Just know that Jesus does and will work in the life of a believer every time and He will get you through all the troubles you're going through. If you would like to talk more, my email is ssj5evilgoku@yahoo.com. I will definitely be praying for you though.|`|7d647be57724929a656a84a04d156140aa	In these times everybody is going through something or the other and to throw salt on the wound the economy is crashing.  I have my own problems on hand and this have been going on over a year now, I had to find peace in the Lord.  It wasn't easy, but I had to make a willful decision to not give up, cave in or quit.  I continue to read positive books, cry to the Lord, I even went to a christian counselor who helped remarkable and got positive books for me to read.  I hang around people who were supportive and cared for me.  One of the things I did was to volunteered with the Catholic Outreach, by feeding the homeless and getting involved in an outreach ministry.  It happened slowly but praise God I made it with the help of God and positive actions I made it.  I never took any drugs or medicines, just wholesome talk, music and watch a lot of comedy shows to make me laugh.  At nights, I cried when I needed to and next morning, when I opened my eyes, I would say, this is a new day, pray, thank the Lord for my blessings and go again.  You can make it, just keep on, be positive  and involve God in your life with wholesome people who is very positive.  If you need positive literature,  I can try getting you some and I will most definitely pray for you.  I am doing it right now.  Love, be bless.|`|SRi8Qc4Iaa	http://www.prayerrequestsite.com/|`|6HxjUdNWaa	You can be comforted by looking to the word of God for encouragement,    read psalms for encouragement and proverbs for advice |`|nE5q7VXaaa	You are going through a hard time.

He guides me in paths of righteousness          for his name's sake.      4 Even though I walk          through the valley of the shadow of death, [a]          I will fear no evil,          for you are with me;          your rod and your staff,          they comfort me.      5 You prepare a table before me          in the presence of my enemies.          You anoint my head with oil;          my cup overflows.      6 Surely goodness and love will follow me          all the days of my life,          and I will dwell in the house of the LORD          forever.    read that passage everyday and stick to it..i know together you and God can make it throught this!!

Set your clock a few minutes early so that you get to school on time tomorrow.  Try to take small steps.  Look at the first question on your homework.  Do the easiest assignment first.  |`|AA11096726	How about some promises from God to all who belong to HIm?    Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due time,  casting all your care upon Him, for He cares for you.    Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.        |`|41ISfvXmaa	You nailed it when you recognized that you need strength.  It takes a lot of strength to do the right thing sometimes. Remember that it's easy to slack off and do things wrong, but it takes effort to work hard and do things right. You can do this....I don't know how old you are, but by student, maybe you mean you're in HS and still living with your parents.  If this is the case, maybe you can ask your parents to help get you back on track.  Ask them if they can get you up in the morning, remind you to do your homework etc.  Kids need guidance from their parents. If parents don't follow up and ask their kids how they're doing in school, then a lot of times kids just brush it off.  I will certainly pray for you. I will pray for you to have the strength to get up in the morning and the determination to focus on your studies.  You can do this! You can do this! You can do this!!|`|XPO5e7bNaa	 I will totally not sit in judgment against you. We all have our good moments and our bad moments. I believe that what you are feeling is totally real and totally a bummer. I can say a prayer for you. I remember times when it felt like no one understood me or my feelings and thought I was just feeling sorry for myself. That was until the doctor diagnosed PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder). You might want to try seeing a psychiatrist and telling them how you are feeling. Another great source would be the Lord. Maybe you could say a prayer for yourself and just give your problems to the Lord. He has a great way of making us feel better. God Bless
Hsz0Qn6Eaa	Jesus didn't actually put a time on the arrival of the kingdom he just said that the kingdom of god was at hand. that could be interpreted as your opportunity to enter into the kingdom of GOd is now. or he could have been saying that from this point the wait for the kingdom begins. I prefer the first interpretation. it makes more sense  . |`|11ZxWK6jaa	"A few years" is pretty vague.  A few years to you could be a million years to someone else.|`|q8tVAPblaa	He said that his kingdom was near. It also says in Peter that one day is as a thousand years to God. It shows how patient God is and how amazing the fact that he isn't constrained by time is.|`|uQTzqKwZaa	Not completely since Satan sometimes tells the truth and sandwich it between lies and He is the liar and father of it...    No offense it's just my belief that Jesus is Lucifer in disguised.    "I am that bright "MORNING STAR" - Jesus|`|Sl3HQTsoaa	Jesus was clear.  Many people don't 'get' what he said.    He said 'The Kingdom IS AT HAND'.  He wasn't talking about time.  He was telling you that it is SO CLOSE you can touch it.    Once you are reborn, you enter this Kingdom.  I am a part of it and so is every one that has accepted Jesus and is letting him lead the way on this journey through life.  The Kingdom is HERE.  You can't see it, because you are 'of this world'.  There is a whole other spiritual world that exists on this planet.  You are welcome in it.  To find it you must find God.  To find God you need to search for him with all your heart.  |`|Jfuep3kZaa	I one knows when the kingdom is to come only God not Jesus. Yea not even Jesus knows but God does. So be PATIENT!!! Geese|`|Lmd9HUNyaa	Jesus words in your midst have at times been translated within you. So some have thought that Jesus meant that the Kingdom of God reigns in the hearts of Gods servants.     But, obviously, the Kingdom of God is not within the hearts of these unbelieving Pharisees to whom Jesus is speaking. Yet, it is in their midst, since the designated King of Gods Kingdom, Jesus Christ, is right among them.|`|t5nZRgWLaa	Answer. It is statements like this that are no doubt meant to incite anger and spontaneous remarks from people of faith and values. You don't know what the Bible says about Jesus, or His words about His coming Kingdom. Jesus said when he was ask about the Kingdom by the ignorant and self centered Jews that the Kingdom of God does not come by observation, but that it was within you. That means He didn't come to set up a worldly kingdom like the Jews thought. He came to establish a spiritual Kingdom that began no later than His Crucifixion, and will continue forever. It is a theological system known as Amillenialism. Go to a website called The Riddleblog and learn about it. I don't mean to offend you but sir you must watch the way you speak about the creator of the universe. It brings about very strong responses. |`|AA11582502	According to the Bible, Jesus's resurrection marked the beginning of the End Times, which we are STILL in.  Since God always was and always will be, time isn't as important to him as it is to us.|`|Zbx3uG4Eaa	Jesus was never wrong ever thing in the Bible is correct end of story|`|MLBeAK2Laa	how was he wrong? time doesnt matter to Jesus. to him the age of the earth IS a few years|`|MEReSvZeaa	The kingdom arrived as described on Pentecost, 30 AD.

MnWhYqEgaa	You are 100% right.  As a matter of fact, I ask all christian women to stop shaving right now!!  Don't be a lukewarm christian!!|`|Wg63M6A2aa	Who wants to go the beach with hair sticking out everywhere  NOT ME  Hair is the body's natural defense against antigens from entering the body  That's why its there  Not from god  Also many changes are perfectly fine, mole removals reduce skin cancer!  and plastic surgery may be life saving and braces..well no one wants there eye poked out|`|szZj0YvFaa	Not trien to insult you but isn't that question like if you brush you teeth you could be insulting God.After all shaving is keeping up on your Hygienees think about the more hair under your arms the more you sweat.God made beautiful things for us and there is nothing wrong with us making our selves beautiful.Look at this planet it was made for us and he even adored the plants trees and flowers with beauty and we have to take care of them,Look at the differents between a yard taken care of and one that just gets mowed once a week.|`|5jX9Glglaa	Its the same kind of thing as being eligible for Santa's "naughty" list.|`|ToBUlekzaa	God cares about the inner person, his heart....not so much about the exterior.|`|lPaSuakqaa	this lady above just said no good christian should shave anything - UM SUPER GROSS|`|rzRFDAsbaa	I hate to be the bearer of bad news but.... God doesn't exist.|`|jLD3lNZdaa	Not really, I mean I don't think so. We're not God, we're just an image of him. Your body is a temple...    1 Corinthians 6:19-20...    Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your body.    So plastic surgery, if it's just for looks, then I would think it's a sin, if it's for health, then no. Shaving your legs I don't think is, but worrying about shaving them is. Don't let physical appearance take over your life and you'll be fine...    Remember this is just my opinion... But honestly don't worry about it... I'm pretty sure that women that shave there legs got into heaven, and I'm sure that people that have had surgery have gotten in, but if you let your life be controlled by physical beauty, then your not putting God first...|`|XXZiNuvZaa	sure we are made in God's image and we our life and bodies could be viewed as a gift of God.  But god also granted us creativity, individuality and free will.   We could all be using our creativity, individuality and free will to ulter our appearance better to suit our will and personality.  I think insulting God would be changing an appearance or feature inspite of God.  To curse or revenge what God has given.  Otherwise in my opinion we're taking God's gift and using it.    What about having plastic surgery for a women who lost hundreds of pounds but have the difficulty of ridding extra skin layers?   Would that plastic surgery be insulting?|`|XLXncQu9aa	No its not an insult to God.  It was a standard that was supposed to be upheld in the old testament.  A great example of this was Samson, when the Lord had a mandate on his life and he was not to have a razor to his head.  (Judges 13:5)  However in these days its not a mandate to keep unwanted hair.  These are modern times, and of course that is where the New testament comes in.  Many of the customs were not seen as important in the New Testament.  Basically my point is that in those days it was more of a tradition and on occasion it was God that spoke to individuals to keep their hair and never cut it.  Now a days its something that isn't common but only in certain cultures.  To God that isn't important in these times, our spiritual condition matters more than physical appearance. |`|MEReSvZeaa	If your son or daughter did this, would YOU be dishonored?    If not, and if you wouldn't even think about it that way, why should God?  He's your father, and his affection is greater than superficial stuff like that.|`|IIhiSprlaa	uh no.    creating false images of yourself through these methods blinds you of who you are. you only hurt yourself. this is the problem with teenage girls and self esteem.|`|E9chZY74aa	Do you cut your toenails?  |`|AA10192697	God isn't a person, He is spirit, He is love.     Shaving any hair from your body isn't against any of God's laws.  Men can shave their beards.    The image of our bodies that are made in God's image is our spirit, our souls. We are physical and spiritual beings. Plants and animals are only physical.    Our bodies are temples and we should take care of them. Puttin only good things into them, like foods, drinks, music, readings, movies, no drunkenness, no drugs, etc.        I personally think that asking a stupid question that would mention that God would get insulted by any human beings is insulting in itself. God doesn't get insulted.|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	no|`|206820c72192d15525008e6de3c12f85aa	Legitimate question...........    But no.

You weren't born with a tooth brush either...|`|7d647be57724929a656a84a04d156140aa	Why would you want it if it is unwanted.  Didn't Jesus heal people who were born blind, deaf, crippled and mute and all other diseases?  If so why didn't he left them as is.  Some people can go over board by restructuring themselves, but if you want to adjust somethings why not go for it, it is not a sin, but enhancement.|`|GVcO1dtnaa	You should go to Europe you'd fit right in|`|yfxM0P8taa	I don't know about you, but I was born naked.  Should I also reject clothing and not shave my face each day?  It would save a lot of time and money, but unless my body hair grew quickly, it would get pretty cold in winter.  I think I'll take my chances and do my best to explain it to God.|`|da807e7e17ab4dd2a5d678db7a393207aa	You'd make a good cult leader.|`|SGFti1xNaa	It's all vanity. No good Christian should shave anything.|`|c85dfb73b5d99dcbc373b5a788901bc7aa	Well, even if it is, I don't care. If God wants to send me to hell for plucking my moustache, at least when I get there I won't have upper lip hair to get singed.|`|yN3fWUCuaa	What makes you think we are made in His * physical * image?  Our image has to do with His traits that are * not * physical.|`|q8tVAPblaa	It says in Deuteronomy not to shave the "corners" of your beard, and Jesus said nothing about this and the fact that he came to complete the law not the amend or destroy it so in essence yes. It's just a question we will have to ask Him when we see Him, because you will.|`|56aupEoPaa	Well, if you searched you'd find I already asked a god question about plastic surgery and apparently as long as your happy u can do what ever you god damn want to.|`|s7eo998Raa	Thats why I leave my pubes 12 inches long.|`|Dv1UMYqUaa	Going by the logic in this question, God should have a vagina and a penis, breasts, and a beard.  He should also have imperfect teeth, be deaf, and blind.|`|54d03e78f8f7d6a3e33b875f46a6abe2aa	No removing unwanted hair is not an insult to God. When Job lost everything, he shaved his head and praised God.|`|rBCQBHSHaa	The Bible doesn't tell us that Eve was hairy.. so you know what.. It doesn't matter in the least. Nope it's not an insult to God to remove unwanted hair. If that were the case then we wouldn't brush our teeth cause it would be an insult to remove unwanted plaque...|`|Tb4L3GqOaa	That's the reason The Quakers didn't allow mirrors.    That's also the reason The Quakers are all dead now.|`|fnF2ZSFkaa	 I don't cut my hair for the reasons in 1 Corinthians 11, but no where in the bible does it say anything about hair elsewhere. Personally, I think it's super gross to have any on my legs and pits... can't even sleep if i'm stubbley.|`|9zc74hkuaa	It grows back. And it is a culture thing as well as a hygiene thing for people. I think plastic surgery is frowned upon because it is a drastic change to your body. I feel that is telling God you are not happy with the way you look so your are going to try and permanently change things to your or the worlds liking. Some people hardly grow any hair in certain areas. Men are usually hairier than women. What about them shaving their beards? God isn't going to frown upon it. Some people just like less hair. That goes with cutting the hair on your head too. God gives me different hairstyle ideas so I know He can't be mad about the way I change it. |`|a3ozyZ5Vaa	yes. god is perfect and he doesn't make mistakes. if god wanted man to fly he would've gave them wings. if god wanted man to breath underwater he would've gave them gills. I think shaving and altering your body (cosmetic surgery) is wrong. if you were born with an astigmatism, its sinful to wear glasses because obviously you weren't meant to see.
AjcxPl7Uaa	When I analyze your question, it seems that only your dog follows all the commandments. Your dog has better chances than you. Follow the footstep of your dog if I were you.|`|4S5NnT7aaa	Quite possibly.  But you'll have to watch out that the Mormons don't re-baptise him after he's dead.    |`|TnquzeM5aa	Your dog is going to hell for humping my leg.|`|1bd7361886f753dc29575d47b7fb14d0aa	I think you better check out where you are going, the dog was not born in sin, you were.|`|H8WqMK1eaa	I don't know...but my dog doesn't follow ANY of mine...and I still want her to go with me.|`|AA10192697	I doubt your dog knows about his creator. So he can't obey the first 3 commandments.  The last 7 commandments are for mankind, not animals. So by that atone and the lack of intelligence, your dog and all animals can't obey the commandments.    We have no idea what happens to animals. It'd be nice to see them in Heaven but it's not the purpose of animals to live eternally. We do because we are made in God's image, hence, we have a soul, the spiritual part of us.

NaM4ZT64aa	Yes, that is a form of envy, though completely natural.

It's a low self-esteem issue. You're probably not ugly. It could be based on something you've heard someone say about you, or it could be that you feel bad about yourself. God didn't make a mistake in making the way you are. To make friends, you just have to show yourself friendly. And then keep being friendly. No, that's not material stuff.
AA10296028	i believe in god.  i really don't understand why people choose not to.      as in every day life no matter who you are or what you do you will notice the following, everything has a creator, every classification of people or of Society does have rules, and every thing has a purpose. (rather we agree with it or not). and every where there is good and bad.    and every where you look there is a higher power.    so to answer your question yes i believe in god.    |`|hpHyTQwIaa	Of course I believe in God.  At one time I was atheist and then became agnostic.  Now I am a true believer because how is the world does the body work the way it does.  There is no scientific answer for this.  Only God could create a human body, the beautiful earth, oceans, seas, etc. etc. etc.  I also had a friend, who is a true believer, take a photo of myself, the day after my mother was buried, and in the photo appeared my mother sitting right next to me.  She was wearing a bathrobe that I wouldn't let her wear during her illness, because it inhibited the use of a feeding tube that was used to feed her because she couldn't swallow.  I believe she was showing me that she no longer needed the tube and that she was alright.  Now, explain that one.  I was flabergasted when I saw the photo.  It showed me that yes, a God does exist, and that was her way of showing me that because she knew at the time the trouble I had in believing in God.  This particular camera was a polaroid and the pic came out very clear.  After that incident, I really believed in God.|`|4ea01eb67de198f5298b06e46769030aaa	Yes, I do believe in God.|`|8ibIQu2eaa	No, no god bye|`|oXKLf3hMaa	no.    i am atheist/agnostic.|`|wcmjTrBDaa	No, atheist, doesn't exist, no.|`|cCmNjqdNaa	ATHEIST!

So I do have some of the qualities HIM(God), have had, if HIM was the creator, so I'm also creative, in my own way, an let us assumed I have begun to create something new, let us said a new Image of HIM(God), that in my mind its and have become a new image. "God is a learning God" to which many who read this will say, Impossible, because seemingly HIM(God), should know, or HIM should have know everything before HIM became a creator.    So, you agree, my question is How come, and why can we agree?  well because its dificult to believed that when HIM(God) begun his creation, he didn't knew that was what hIMwill achieved, and pursue, and becoming a creator, was for HIM to achieve.  God energy of awareness, that also conscious of the forms?, was in pursue of his own evolution a/o the evoluton of his own energy into essences, as matter pursue her own evolution into better substances, insearch for a better environment?, because since God begun to use the matter to create the Human Body, matter have been able to assimilate, the experiences the heavenly energies, of God, have left behind in the material world throuhg their own experiences. Just like Jesus did, by dying in the cross for what him Jesus, believed to be the right cause. and the effect produce are producing better effects for the matters and the substances and not for God own material creation, because the Humanism been toad by the Humans from heaven, hasn't been yet assimilate by man, or intelligent being, which are supos to, practice Humanity in search for the perfection of our own physical entity.     although the evolution of the energies into essences can't be scientificaly proven, against the evolution of the species, the only species we can see evolution in this material world are the ones been create throuhg the use of Matter which can achieved an evolution with the help of her own substances, our physical evolution its for the achievedment of perfection and perfection is and will be achieved when with our own mind we can achieved control of the elements and the substances that are harmful to our physical (Body) entity.    The perfect Body its God goal to perfect and allow time to his own heavenly energies to experience, that is our gain, to learn his desires to achieved a Human Body which HIM(god), gave us also although we where emanation of matters a/o elements of matter, for us to elevate our self to a better standar of Humanism God, Adam and Jesus among others came to this material world to experience, why bcause God, nor Adam nor jesus among others, are Not from this world of matter a/o material world they are heavenly existences.   free will to choose, if we want to became like then or Not. my self I want to, and I want to because they are infinite and eternal human entities.         my reason to believed I just have exposed to you, from my own creativity, which is thruth.     . |`|9GMcPrHGaa	No, I don't believe in God.

However, it is not wrong to pursue irrational goals, because there is no such thing as right and wrong at the elementary level. We will want to do this because our mind are only part rational, the other part irrational. The most straightforward goal would be then to pursue happiness. Which we can keep on pursuing.

If you are honest, you would admit that you have sinned in life.  God is holy, perfect.  A sinful person cannot enter the presence of a holy God.  God loves you and wants you to be with Him in heaven when you die.  But you can't enter heaven with sin.  How do you purge that sin?  Well there's nothing we can do to wash it clean, nothing.  So God made a way.  He gave us Jesus, who was fully God and fully man.  He agreed to take the penalty for every sin we have ever committed onto himself.  When He died on the cross, He said "it is finished".  That means, the work of salvation was completed.  God has made a way out of eternal separation from Him.  All He asks is that we are sorry for our sins and believe in His son.    Is that so much, really?|`|IIhiSprlaa	ahh, the frustrations.      nuff said.|`|tManvxfQaa	Jesus is God and He is the Only Way to Heaven  there is No Other Way    And you can do as you wish , its your choice and its your life and its also your death .|`|AA11387815	Someone's forcing you?

They believe He exists, but they don't believe that He is the son of God or the true Savior.  Doesn't make them wrong.  Doesn't make you wrong for not necessarily believing in Him, either.  It's not worth worrying about something you don't believe in anyway.  Strive for the personal relationship with God that you want, and make the best of whatever you achieve.  It's your belief, you can practice it any way you want.  Some people choose to adopt an established religion because they like what they do, or what they say, or how they do or say it.  Nobody is forcing you to believe in Christ, at least I'm not.

This topic of choosing the right religion has been a struggle I have had. I know that God is my choice, and I am truly happy with the religion I have.    Yes, God teaches good things.

That's a part of it, but you're right, anyone can try to be good.  Christianity is accepting that God created the world and us, and has ultimate control over it, it's giving Him the respect and worship he deserves as God, and it's because "being good" isn't what gets you into heaven.   Hell is the just punishment for sin.  The only way out of Hell is being a perfect human (not possible) or having the price of your sins paid by Jesus, and thus forgiven.  Jesus was the ultimate sacrifice that payed the price for sin that allows you access to heaven - that's the difference.|`|lUFBlZ6haa	only Jesus died for our sins.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	You're absolutely right; you can believe in anything you want to, all roads lead to God whether you believe as your neighbor does or not.

We ought to read about the acounts of persecution in The Bible, Fox's Book Of Martyrs, and in stories of currant overseas persecutions.     The majority of "christians" you (Eloy G) see around are fakes. They are hypocrits. They go to most christian churches. They ARE NOT believers in Jesus! They don't walk the talk, and don't show The Fruit of The Spirit in their lives. They even preach an excelllent gospel message, but don't believe in Jesus, and are not saved. These are people such as Billy Graham, the TBN network, pastors, on down to most congregation members.

And the the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with the Lord. Therefor comfort one another with these words. If the world had long been accepting that Jesus had come 2,000 years ago then the world must accept also that He will come again. He is coming very soon for the signs of His coming He mentioned in Matthew 24 are all visible now. This sinful planet of ours will be destroyed by fire and a new heaven and a new earth will take its place. Those who take part in the Rapture will live with God in heaven for a thousand years after a thousand years they will inherit the new heaven and the new earth throughout eternity. Revelation 21:1-2 Now I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away. Also there was no sea. Then I, John, saw the holy city New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. We should believe this and the proof is the Jews are now back in their homeland. God will prepare them again for the second coming of the Messiah who is Jesus Christ. He came as a Savior He will come as a King and Judge. He will separate the people as goats and sheep, the goats as the wicked and unbelievers and the sheep as the righteous and believers. The sheep go to eternal life. The goats go to eternal torment where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth and their worm does not die. |`|kyTDQEWaaa	"our planet"? ???

Hell is a place for those who refuse to accept God and worship Him in truth.    2.  God IS a loving God .... for now.  Later on, when time is over and all human opportunities for salvation are gone, God will become a God of Justice (each will reap what they sow - if they sow evil, they will reap evil).    3.  If the reality of a fiery burning Hell doesn't invoke fear, then why would God had Jude (1:21-23) to write:    "Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.  And of some have compassion, making a difference: And others save with fear, pulling [them] out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh."    Hell IS a place for those who do not wish to worship God.  The only problem is, you won't get to dictate the conditions.  If you are lost when you die, you have condemned yourself for counting the Blood of Jesus Christ an unworthing thing.  Since you are condemned already, you will await your final sentencing at the Great White Throne judgment of Jesus Christ (Revelation).    And you are wrong on a few counts:    1.  Human nature fears fire far worse than cold.  For the eternal lost person, they will have a body that will be literally bathed in flames.  Unfortunately, there will never be any recourse, no appeal, no water or beer, no getting out.    2.  "Anarchy" is a human word.  It doesn't apply to God.  The Bible is quite specific: one is either lost and doomed in Hell and the Lake of Fire for eternity, or one is saved and will enjoy full happiness for eternity.    3.  You are "doing your own thing" now, but that is contrary to what God would have you do.  After dying, you won't have a choice.    You have a choice now - put aside your preconceived and preinfluenced ideas and study the Bible with an open mind.  Sincerely ask God, that if He exists, to reveal His salvation to you.           |`|pfNnuD5saa	I don't.

Resurrection for everyone.  But not everlasting life for everyone.  Obviously, there are some folks who would make eternal life misery for themselves and everyone around them.  For them, there is "the second death".   What of people who are fairly decent folks, but just never accepted Jesus Christ because a) they never heard of Him, or ever had a chance to really learn about Him or b) the people who did tell them about Him misrepresented Him so badly that they didn't understand Who He actually is?  I dunno...but I don't believe they will ether be in Heaven, which is the place prepared by Jesus for His followers where they can be with Him, nor will they die the second death. I honestly do not know, I can only speculate.    One thing I do know.  Your "place of anarchy" scares me more than the fundy version of hell...everyone doing their own thing, with no fear of ANY reprisal? What a playground for sadists!!

0NOiAlJOaa	We must not lose sight of the most important truth about Godthat God the Father and Jesus Christ the Son are Beings of infinite love. John perfectly summarized Their divine character and nature when he wrote that "God is love" (1 John 4:8, 16).    The love of God is selfless, outflowing concern for the good of others. When He showed his glory to Moses, God revealed Himself as "the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness, maintaining love to thousands, and forgiving wickedness, rebellion and sin" (Exodus 34:6-7, NIV).    Love is the foundation of the character and law of God. It is the basis of everything that God has revealed to mankind in the Holy Scriptures (Matthew 22:35-40). Paul called love the greatest Christian attribute (1 Corinthians 13:13). It is the first aspect of the fruit of God's Spirit that he mentions (Galatians 5:22). Love is the bond of perfection, binding everything together in perfect unity (Colossians 3:14, NIV). It is the fulfilling of God's divine law (Romans 13:10).    This amazing quality of godly love even encompasses love for one's enemies (Matthew 5:44-45; Luke 6:35).    Upon repentance, we can begin to exhibit this kind of love through the Holy Spirit. God wants us to learn to think as He thinks and do as He does.    In exercising this kind of love, we express the image of God (reflecting His character), even though we are still human. Paul encourages us to "let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus" (Philippians 2:5), who perfectly personified God's love to the point of giving His own life for us.    One of the Bible's best-known passages tells us that "God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life" (John 3:16). God not only wants to grant us the priceless gift of eternal life, He wants to share all things with us in His divine family (Hebrews 2:6-8; Romans 8:16-17). Time and time again the Scriptures reveal that God perfectly personifies love.  |`|36ff857df7ec751866efe603f8e9b6aaaa	This situation is way above what you're capable of handling.  The best thing you can do is point this young man to someone or some place where he can otain the help he needs.      If, as you say, he is suicidal, you can  say the wrong thing at the wrong time and drive him over the edge.     Please, please, direct him to a Christian pastor or a qualified Christian counselor.    It's great you're wanting to help, but sometimes the best help we can give is to point the person to someone who is qualifed to help him.    I wish you well.  May the peace of God go with you.

One approach would be to follow the same model of progression which God followed in revealing himself. Start with the basic facts (God is one, eternal and uncreated. God is the creator. God is a person, not a force) and only move on gradually to the more complex issues (the Trinity, Atonement, etc).    Another way would be to start with the historical person of Jesus. Who was he? what did he say about God? why did people believe him? why should we believe him?     A third way would be to take a philosophical approach. Does life have meaning or purpose if there is no God? Can there be any absolute moral law if there is no God? I would be careful with this one though, as if the person really is suicidal then there is a danger that this line of discussion could be counterproductive.    In a fourth scenario you may have to do some groundwork before you move onto a discussion of God Himself. Show how a belief in God is not irrational or arbitrary, and how it doesn't have to be in conflict with science. Show that there is good evidence for God's existence, even if it does not amount to proof.    More generally speaking (and I hope I am stating the obvious here) it is important to engage with questions this person may ask. Don't just give stock answers or a barrage of Biblical quotes. If you find you can't answer a question adequately then be honest about the fact.    Regarding this person's sexuality and cross dressing, you have a tricky job. You have to be clear that gay sex is wrong and that cross dressing is wrong if its done for sexual reasons, but at the same time you must be sensitive about it how you say this. Emphasize God's mercy, that we are always able to repent and  do not have to be bound by what we have done in the past. Perhaps explain how he is not alone in having a burden to carry. His life's struggle will be to preserve chastity, but there are millions of other people out there will be struggling with other problems - illness, depression, addiction, bereavement, unhappy family relationships and so forth. Suffering such problems is a normal part of life.    How you explain why homosexuality is wrong will depend on what you believe. Personally, I take the traditional line that sex was given for the purposes of procreation and for strengthening the bond between husband and wife. Hence any attempt to perform sexual intercourse in a way that is not open to the possibility of procreation is an abuse of God's gift. If you take this line, then you can point out that homosexual sex is, fundamentally, the same sort of sin as pre-marital sex, or adultery, and thus not uniquely sinful.    As a final thought, it may be useful to consider your objectives and to prioritise them. The first objective has to be to guide this person away from suicide, and not say anything to drive them over the edge. If this means holding back on the more uncomfortable issue for a while then so be it. How you prioritise things beyond that will depend on the specific circumstances of the case. In the end you may not achieve all you hoped to, but at least if you can prevent suicide you can preserve hope for the future.       Good luck, and God bless.|`|gkmaYqdZaa	God IS love, now love is not the touchy feely thing that hollywood produced, it is just and righteous but also merciful and full of compassion.

Letting him know what Jesus has done for you is a great start.  And having him pray the prayer, then Jesus will be in his heart to help him get his life wonderful and truely happy.    God is not angry at him, Jesus loves him heart and soul, I once lived in sin and thought this till on the week i was going to commit suicide someone shared the truth with me.  Pray to the great heart, mind, and soul doctor Jesus, not my will be done but thine/yours be done  He will let you know what to do, and he uses earthly doctors too, whatever we need to get us through.      to you the sweet princess to look up and live in inner peace, joy and fun;     this fits true love and most of all from above;  "Help me Jesus, I am sorry for my sins against your love, come into my heart and be my best friend, amen"  His words Revelation 3:19&20 "I love you and ask you to repent quickly, let me in your heart's door to be your friend."    For all those times you stood by me For all the truth that you made me see  For all the joy you brought to my life     And I am everything I am because you love me ~    Thank you Lord ..I love because you first loved me ..      When I say... "I have come to know Jesus" I'm not shouting "I'm perfect"  I'm whispering "I was lost," Now I'm found and forgiven.    When I say..."I believe the bible and asked Jesus to forgive my sins and come in my heart;   I'm confessing that I stumble and need CHRIST to be my guide.    When I say... "I have Jesus in my heart as my best friend"   I'm not trying to be strong.  I'm professing that I'm weak and need HIS strength to carry on.  With Jesus Hebrews 13:5 there is NO abandonment "I will never leave you"    Every good gift is from above." James 1  remember Those that have stuck by you.  remember His blessings.    Have you ever loved Jesus so much It makes you cry happy tears and when out of fellowship with him sad ones? I have 3 times, once i told him i was tired of witnessing to my   Jewish born people because they were so mean to me when I share=  Isaiah 7:14 the virgin birth Isaiah 9:6 that the Messiah will be Mighty God  Isaiah 52:13-53:12 that Messiah will be exalted but first marred more than any man and die as a lamb for our sins.    The other 2 times also only lasted for a day and made peace with Messiah Jesus at night, weeping bitterly asking forgiveness, those two times I just had told God earlier in the day, i was tired of being used by him. lol now you would think i would have learned the first time not to do that again. Well as the day went on I would say Jesus should i talk to this man, He would speak to my heart "No David just praise me to yourself"   Jesus here is a man with a bible i know you want me to talk to him?" Just praise me, David.   By the end of the day i realized what he was telling me, "David i was used for you, I went down calvary road, beaten spit on and gladly went on the cross to forgive your sins, how much am i asking of you, If you dont want to be used, I will not use you again....oh I begged him in hot tears, "Please dear Jesus use me again." Now every week on Sunday i pray and give him the glory for using me in the past week, and ask "Jesus if you would like to use me again this week help me give you all the glory again.    Have you ever needed Jesus so bad You can't sleep at night? then get up pray close your eyes and ask Jesus, whatever he brings to your mind = "Jesus I am sorry I am out of fellowship with you, help me Jesus, amen   Are you in Love totally with Jesus?     happy :)David |`|Mum9nU20aa	In the name of the LORD.

ewWUFWyWaa	Not really, but you can sell your daughter into slavery... even today!  The Bible will let you do that and you can go to Heaven after you die!    Christians still have the option in the New Testament era which is today to buy a suitable slave and do with him/her anything that their naughty heart desires with all of God's blessings like they did in Colonial America up to the 1860s!!! The only obstacle now is the secular government laws NOT THE WORD OF GOD! If you had a slave you can use him/her even for the kinkiest gay, bizarre or straight sex imaginable! In spite of any Biblical interpretation, there are plenty of arguments in the Bible to justify ANY KIND OF KINKY SEX OR FETISH especially with slaves!!! Believe it or not, pedophilia in all its extreme forms is CONDONED and totally unregulated in the Bible, Old and New Testaments nothing has changed because GOD NEVER CHANGES!!! If a man likes to have a little girl for a while for whatever pleasure HE DOESNT NEED TO DATE HER! He can buy her as a slave from a set of some God fearing parents IN NEED OF MONEY! Sometimes you dont even need to buy her you can trick her! God the Holy Ghost sent the Archangel Saint Gabriel to sweet talk the very young and naive Virgin Mary so he could have her pregnant without any problem. The Blessed Virgin Mary was very horny. She didnt hesitate one moment to go along to be laid with a perfect stranger. She didnt tell her fianc Saint Joseph until 6 months later and only because he noticed that she was getting big around her slender belly     Titus 2:9 (NIV) (Saint Paul commands!) Teach slaves* (*including young little boy and girl slaves) to be subject to their masters in everything* (*EVERYTHING without restrictions no matter how kinky!), to try to please them, not to talk back to them,* (*Hallelujah! Praise the LORD! Sweet Jesus! Amen? --Please dont judge me wrong here Im being sarcastic just to make a point! The day that the extremist Christian Fundies will rule America, Biblical slavery will be reinstated!)    Exodus 21:20-21 NIV If a man beats his male or female slave with a rod* (*i.e. for lack of submission!) and the slave dies as a DIRECT RESULT* (*not for any pre-existing condition! Especially if the master is drunk or plain abusive!), he must be punished* (*but how? will the master get a slap on the wrist?), but he is not to be punished if the slave gets up after a day or two, since the slave is HIS PROPERTY* (*The Infallible KJV says, his money a slave is not even a human being, but property or money! That is why Christian America up to the 1860s justified Biblical slavery including all forms of imaginable pedophilia with the black and white slaves we had white Irish slaves, too that nobody talks about!)     So you can keep beating your male or female slave to a pulp every third day or so and as long as he/she recovers you are a HOLY and RIGHTEOUS person before this Loving God and Heavenly Father! Gods Law is SOOOO GOOD for the wanking Christians!!! The whole Bible is decisively pro-slavery of the kinkiest sort! In the New Testament, escaping slaves were ALWAYS TOLD TO RETURN to their masters and to go free only if allowed! The whole book of PHILEMON in the New Testament is dedicated to teach Christian escaped slaves anywhere in the world to return to their masters! Modern day Preachers are shrewd enough to ignore any unfavorable rap in the New Testament!     1 Peter 2:18 (NIV) (Saint Peter, the First Pope commands!) Slaves* (*including young little slave girls!), submit yourselves to your masters with all respect, NOT ONLY to those who are good and considerate, BUT ALSO TO THOSE WHO ARE HARSH.* (*Hey! hey! hey! how kinky can the Christians get even today? As kinky as the clergy and the militant Christians allow and the secular arm of the law wont catch them! Smart preachers do it in their closets! Christians have no moral standards to draw from the Bible! They borrow from our real secular world!)    Exodus 21:7-8 (NIV) "If a MAN SELLS* (*for whatever reason like for being short of money) his DAUGHTER* (*NOT HIS SON, but his daughter! Can you sense the sexual innuendo in Gods Holy Law?) as a SLAVE, SHE IS NOT TO GO FREE as male slaves do. If she does not please the master who has selected her for himself* (*by then she must be all worn out, sexually speaking, of course!), he must let her be redeemed. He has no right to sell her to foreigners, because he has broken faith with her.    Can you imagine the slave girls fate if her God fearing daddy doesn't want her back and her master is a sadistic sexual pervert? Another more subtle way of getting a GIRL for a wife in the Bible is to be a predator at a PURITY BALL watching the virgin girls dancing and grab for yourself anyone that you wish to have for a wife The Law of God allows MEN this pleasure! No silly dating necessary! That's about how the Blessed Virgin Mary got pregnant, too! She was talked into it and she agreed on the spot! At least she was not kidnapped!    Judges 21:23 * So that is what the Benjamites did. While the girls were dancing, each man caught one and carried her off to be his wife (Praise the LORD! Sweet Jesus!)     In the Holy Bible days women had no noticeable rights and were worth much less than men! As long as the master follows the Bible injunctions he is always a Holy man of God, like RIGHTEOUS LOT who shortly after his wifes death was getting drunk and was having sex with his young virgin daughters until he got them pregnant, or even the Levite priest of God in Judges 19-21 who pleasured himself carving up his gang raped concubine in 12 pieces. He sent the chunks of her body by messengers to all Israel to get the Benjamin clan exterminated in a Holy Vendetta! (Amen? Praise the LORD! Sweet Jesus!)

Nobody/nothing showed up...no God, no Devil...nothing, nada, zip.    Pretty good way to prove that soul obsessed deities do not exist when you offer yours up for free and there are no takers.
77b2610047fd4e5f740d75e96c9a88a2aa	It just says hot drinks and it means coffee and tea.  And it's in the Doctrine and Covenants, not the Book of Mormon.  If it said hot AND cold drinks we'd be dehydrated wouldn't we?    As has already been said, it has nothing to do with caffeine.  It really doesn't have anything to do with temperature either.  Apple cider, hot chocolate, etc are fine.  Even herbal tea is considered fine by most Mormons.  It means coffee and black or green teas.    Trish....are you sure they didn't have hot chocolate?  While undoubtedly, there are Mormons that drink coffee there is no gray area on that one.  We are not supposed to drink coffee.  And the requirements of members of MoTab are fairly strict so it would surprise me to find out that "plenty" of them drink coffee.      EDIT:  Why do I have a thumbs down?  Everything I said was accurate.    Anyway, here is a link to the doctrine called the "word of wisdom".  http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?vg... If you click on additional info, it will give you specifics about the few dietary restrictions we have.    EDIT:  You know, there are many theories about the "why's" but the truth is, we don't know.  Some speculate that it's the tanic acids, others speculate that it's the temperature.  The truth is, it doesn't matter why.  We believe that it was a revelation from God.  Perhaps it's just to test our faithfulness.  Who knows.|`|3bc6709f9978822792e144f5259dd14baa	We are asked not to drink coffee, tea, or alcohol.  We're also asked not to smoke, abuse drugs, use tobacco, or smoke.    The fact is that there is no official reason given.  We believe that these instructions came from a prophet of God.  Perhaps we'll find very strong health reasons for this, perhaps we will not.      Jesus Christ taught "love one another".  He didn't go into great detail about the reasons for doing so, he simply stated that we should do so.      What it has do do with is obedience.  Not temperature, not caffeine content, but obedience to this very simple request regarding what we do and do not consume.  At the end of the day, the choice is ours.     I know that isn't the answer that you were hoping for, but it is the right answer.|`|Y6odIQgJaa	I have never heard that, but I do know they are not allowed to consume caffeine or other drugs that harm the body.  That would include sodas and coffee, so maybe that's where you got the idea about cold or hot drinks.    Hope this helps!|`|AA12383652	It says hot drinks, but that has been clarified thru further revelations to mean coffee and non herbal tea.      It is NOT about the caffeine!|`|49c07573b2ef8b7f4c512a10de7d7febaa	Ok - the following is from my personal experience.      My ex-husband is in a chorus called The Vocal Majority that sang with the Mormon Tablernacle Choir quite a few years ago in Dallas, Texas.  The VM put them up in the Lowe's Anatole Hotel in Dallas, and hosted a banquet in their honor.  The "Tab Choir," as they often refer to themselves, made it very clear that they would find unacceptable a meal at which caffeinated beverages or alcohol were served.  Decaffeinated/uncaffeinated drinks were provided, both hot and cold - coffee, tea, 7-up, etc.  I saw plenty of Mormons drinking decaffeinated iced tea and hot coffee, as well as a variety of non-caffeinated sodas.    I was fortunate enough on that evening to sit in their midst and listen to them sing, albeit informally.  Whatever I may think of their theology, it is undeniable they have an amazing choir!|`|6DmsiLGbaa	Just another rumor, I'm afraid.  If we weren't allowed to drink "hot or cold drinks," after all, then we'd sort of not be able to drink anything at all, because that seems fairly inclusive to me!        Seriously, though, we've just been asked to avoid coffee and tea.  Anything else is fine, cold or not.  Now that it's winter and freezing, I pretty much drink my weight in hot chocolate every day.  I'd be very, very unhappy if all hot drinks were banned!      And this isn't from the Book of Mormon, because they probably didn't have coffee or tea back then anyway.  This comes from modern prophets and can be found in the Doctrine and Covenants, which is, more or less, a book of revelations and commandments given to prophets in our day.      And no, it's not the caffeine that's the issue.  If it were, we wouldn't be allowed to eat chocolate, either (and that would be a sad, sad day).  Tea has things like tanic acid, which is extremely unhealthy, but I'm not sure about the coffee.  Some scientist some day will figure that one out, but in the meantime, I'm just not gonna drink it.|`|KAI2WUqpaa	just more xtian wackos|`|Rq4e4rROaa	I am a mormon. In the book of mormon there is this section called the "Word of Wisdom". Not to lecture- but basically it says no smoking and such. It says no hot drinks because typically they have a lot of cafiene and are addictive. Anything addictive isn't recommended, but i have diet coke all the time and hot chocolate and all sort of things. It's a personal choice but not enforced at all.|`|7YVon6dsaa	Certain hot drinks (coffee and tea) are the drinks that mormons don't drink, along with alcohol. Cold drinks would be: iced teas and very caffeinated soft drinks. Herbal teas are ok.    These drinks have some negative effects, such as addictions, car crashes, heart problems etc. The Doctrine and Covenants is where this commandment is given, not the Book of Mormon.    I don't think its the temperature thats too important (although God obviously doesn't want us scalding our throats), its more the negative effects certain drinks have on people.    If you want the official answer, here is a link to the church's website:http://mormon.org/mormonorg/eng/basic-be...|`|hg8ufwM1aa	The Word of Wisdom is a physical and spiritual health code, revealed to Joseph Smith.  We are simply told that some foods are harmful to our physical body, which could also effect or spiritual lives.  Some things are mentioned specifically such as Tobacco, and wine or strong drink, and Alcohol.  Later Hot drinks were interpreted to mean Coffee and Tea, which was common at that time.  But the bottom line is the Lord expects us to use our heads in what ever we take into our bodies.  If there are things there that could become habit forming, they should be avoided.  The Lord has declared.."For behold, it is not meet that I should command in all things; for he that is compelled in all things, the same is a slothful and not a wise servant; wherefore he receiveth no reward."  D&C 58;26    Also the Lord tells us in the Word of Wisdom revelation..."Behold, verily, thus saith the Lord unto you: In consequence of evils and designs which do and will exist in the hearts of conspiring men in the last days, I have warned you, and forewarn you, by giving unto you this word of wisdom by revelation"  D&C 89;4.  Apparently evil and designing men will put things into our food for their own profit, not caring what it may do to us.  Now this revelation was given Feb. 7, 1833.  And guess what?  Much of our food today does contain many harmful, unnessary ingredients, which allows companies to put less product and more fillers in our food, and charge more for them.  We live the Word of Wisdom because it is a commandment, and we are much healthier for so doing.   whew6

6173ede5e3ea0a8b44522ccd89de7fe0aa	You cannot communicate with the dead. The Bible says that "the dead know not anything." They don't float around as spirits, and they do not go immediately to Heaven or Hell. They sleep in the grave in an unconscious state until Christ returns to resurrect the Saved. The Wicked will remain dead for another 1,000 years, until Christ and the Saved return to judge the Wicked, who will then be destroyed permanently.  What people perceive as "ghosts" are actually demons, fallen angels impersonating the dead. They know everything there is to know about anyone, and they use this information to deceive the Living.   Those, like John Edward, who claim to be able to "speak with the dead", have what the Bible calls a "familiar spirit", or what they call a "spirit guide", which is really a demon who gives them specific information about someone.   The Bible is quite clear that consulting "a medium, necromancer or those who have a familiar spirit" is forbidden - because God knows the state of the dead, and He knows that people would only be contacting demons. |`|5HbQ6Pwiaa	No!,...  But demons do come as if they are dead people.        The Bible makes it clear in 2 places that I know of one says   not sure the verse  's  "absent of the body is present with the lord."  also  "The dead have no conscious thoughts"|`|Lmd9HUNyaa	What happens at death is no mystery to Jehovah, the Creator of the brain.     He knows the truth, and in his Word, the Bible, he explains the condition of the dead. Its clear teaching is this: When a person dies, he ceases to exist.     Death is the opposite of life. The dead do not see or hear or think. Not even one part of us survives the death of the body. We do not possess an immortal soul or spirit.    The demons mislead people is by encouraging them to inquire of the dead.     People grieving over the death of a loved one are often deceived by wrong ideas about those who have died. A spirit medium may give special information or may speak in a voice that seems to be that of a dead person.     As a result, many people become convinced that the dead are really alive and that contacting them will help the living to endure their grief. But any such comfort is really false as well as dangerous.     Why?     Because the demons can imitate the voice of a dead person and give a spirit medium information about the one who died. (1 Samuel 28:3-19)     Moreover,  the dead have ceased to exist. (Psalm 115:17) So anyone who inquires of the dead has been misled by wicked spirits and is acting contrary to the will of God. (Deuteronomy 18:10, 11; Isaiah 8:19) Therefore, be careful to reject this dangerous bait used by the demons.|`|1WisnX8naa	No|`|8mHA8gqcaa	I was very close to my grandfather who passed away about 4 years ago. I would plead with tears in my eyes for him to communicate with me "right then" as I stood at his grave. That never happened, but he has visited me in my dreams on several occasions, one shortly after his death to tell me that I was going to be o.k and that he had to go. So I suppose my answer is that you may not be able to communicate with them, but if you're open to it they can reach you in your dreams.|`|fswv9lRIaa	so these people all quote bible verses and all that but i know there are plenty of places that mention angels and being watched over. and im pretttty sure that it says when you die you die or whatever that one said that was in the bible. what is heaven then idiot. a place after death. why post on here and be negative. I believe some people are more sensitive to talking to the other side . maybe try a legit medium (not some crappy one with a crystal ball and turban) ask around, i have friends that have incredible stories about loved ones coming through and saying things only they could know. some may say this is evil, i really think that is ridiculous. if your loved one contacts you it can definitely make you feel better and maybe put to rest some questions you had. either way i believe its possible.   best of luck!    i have never heard about this whole staying in teh grave for 1000 years and all that and that doesnt really go along with heaven and going to a better place. buut  i have  heard of all this about demons impersonating the dead, but really what reason would they have? why come in a dream form to someone and let them know everything would be okay? if that helps someone cope, so be it. what right does anyone have to say God or whatever higher power there is doesnt let it happen. If God doesnt exist how would you prove this wasnt truly the spirit? stop making others feel bad, theres plenty of things in the bible that are no longer valid or used. i believe that whole passage was in the old testament (i could be wrong) but take a look at other things in there. live your life and let others believe there is something else out there.|`|7d647be57724929a656a84a04d156140aa	No, the dead cannot communicate beyond the grave.  That's why it's so important to live right with people here on earth.  When we try to communicate beyond the grave it is not of God but demonic connection.  It is a sin, God hates it.|`|fER8XF68aa	Since people who died no longer exist, there is no way to communicate with them.  .|`|pGMVzFbnaa	Here is my take on communicating with the "dead". Think of people who have passed over as cats. Cats pick their owners. We, as people can go adopt a cat but the cat has to pick us. If the cat does not pick us it runs away. Their is no way for you to communicate with the dead unless they want to. This is my theory on why some people see ghosts and other people don't. I am not even sure if ghosts are real but if they are... obviously they pick us. I do not know if I would trust a dream. How can you know for sure it is not just a dream? It could be your imagination. Based on stories I have heard I do believe that the dead can communicate with us but I do not believe that we can really communicate back.|`|OI29tkSoaa	I believe that their is a way But I would not recommend doing it .|`|uB36zOplaa	bible book of Ecclesiastes 9: 5 - 6 & 10|`|kXhAERt3aa	No - the only thing left is echoes of their conscious in the Universal Subconscious, and those are distorted and incomplete.

There was a Lords supper which is much like the passover feast but it was interpreted to be communion in the end. However, it helps people to love God doesnt it? There are a lot of traditions set by God, that man doesn't follow, and then their are many set by man that the bible doesnt follow. In the end, it all came down to a meeting held by the biships of the catholic church 1700 years ago. They set the traditions and rules most commonly practiced. protestant churches still follow many of those traditions yet and assume they broke free of Catholic law. No one really goes completely by what the word of God says. There may be a few churches that are close however. Matthew 22:37 said it all.

Christmas is an interpretation of the principal message of the Bible-the incarnation of the Son of God. it is only a commemoration, to help christians recall and renew their commitment to their faith. the dates are not important. it's only a means to an end not an end in itself.       |`|7d647be57724929a656a84a04d156140aa	Some of the things, yes.|`|46e820e9ba704c6776305bf6a1b991efaa	From some of the answers you received, people do not know what the Bible says.

Or the one who says about being put to death for working on the sabbath or killing her kids because they acted up at Disneyworld.  She doesn't even know that the commandments were given to the Jews only.  And that when Jesus died he replaced those commandments with only two. To love God with all your heart, soul and mind and to love your neighbor as yourself.  We were never commanded to keep the Sabbath.  Unless we were Jews.|`|lR6Ocjm1aa	We can all agree that the words of the apostle Paul at Ephesians 5:16 are true of our time: The days are wicked. Yes, we most certainly live in a wicked world, a world of unrighteousness, where mens thoughts and deeds are bad. The conduct of men and nations does not bring glory to God and is unworthy of his kingdom. We have grown up in this world, amidst its traditions and customs, many of which are contrary to Gods righteous principles, and in company with people whose conduct falls far short of the standards we find in the Bible, Gods Word. This has all had its effects on us and on our way of life. Also, having grown up in a divided world we have acquired different loyaltiesloyalties to family, tribe, race and nationoften resulting in division, hatred, suspicion and false pride, a feeling of superiority over others. But when we read about Gods kingdom from the Bible we learn of another loyalty that is required of those who will gain everlasting life. This is loyalty to Jehovah, the Supreme Ruler of the universe, and to his kingdom under Christ Jesus, and we learn of a new way of life in obedience to the rule of that kingdom. This calls for conduct different from that of the world. It calls for one to behave in a manner worthy of the good news.Phil. 1:27.|`|P6atY3xXaa	The NT never calls the memorial of Christ's death communion.  That was a Mosaic law sacrifice that could be done at any time.  THe person sacrificed and animal usually a lamb or bull, and ate a meal with the priest.  Thus he communed with God by eating with and talking to a Levite priest.    Communion in the NT is prayer.

They don't equate these things with their roots which in most cases is honoring, worshiping false Gods.   Sun God, Fertility God, these are Gods of old but the holidays are fashioned around them.

Why wait for some certain day when you can have family gatherings any time.   We are to worship the one True God, Jehovah with Spirit and Truth.  He hates the ritual of man.  Shame on these churches for misleading and encouraging the celebration such unclean things.  Jesus never celebrated his birthday, nor did he command anything but the anniversary of his death, Nisan 14, to be observed.  How many know he was on earth 40 days after his death?  It is in the scriptures.  Read the Gospels.  People cannot rely on their churches clergy to lead them and think for them.  Sometime they have say enough and do their own research, then make their own decision.

And why should they be tied to each other for life when the bible clearly says adultery ends the marriage as death does.  He said we discourage the use of the bible.    I commented that if he was a man of God why wasn't he using God's word?    And that's when he said they pass down the spoken word from of old and do not read the scriptures to dispute what they are taught.    Then I explained they were keeping people in a loveless state for life when God had called one to peace and one could remarry but is stuck watching the other go on with their life.    He repeated many things in a loud tone...not in peace.    So there is proof they follow traditions of men and not the word of God.

dc5579dda31633fb3c2d8612ff7583cdaa	I do, defiantly! I have a hard time believing that we "living" are the only ones to exist. I have some small experiences that I couldn't explain. One, being my heavy drapes in my bedroom blowing out from the window from the bottom. Thinking it was the fan doing this I looked up and the fan was off. Another story is hearing a extremely loud crash in our utility room. Sounded like the whole cabinet fell over. I thought maybe it was our German Shepherd but she was lying right next to my chair. She jumped up scared out of her wits. Went to the room and everything was in place. My mom always told me that she believed we had a spirit in our home because of things that would happen, she would never tell me what they were though???  This one is freaky, at least to me. My best friend and I were in my camper trailer at night goofing off. She had this "spell book" and one was that you thought about the boy you liked and said a spell and he was supposed to call you on the phone (we had our cordless out there with us). Well, we did that and the freakin phone rang, I picked it up and the voice on the other end said "I'm gonna slit your throat". Won't ever do that again!!! Learned my lesson. My dad didn't believe us.    My cats will look into space and then the hair will stand up on their backs!    I do believe in God too!!!!!!!!!|`|i0OVwfcyaa	Nope.|`|nyP3Yk8haa	nooooooo lol|`|ij5Sv6staa	yes, heard one    very real indeed|`|lue3QssOaa	i do i think theres ghost in ma house cuz i hear noises in ma attic. the doorbell sometimes rings at 12:00 pm n i hear things whispering in my ears|`|TBXG4yXDaa	Sometimes.

My husband and I were in a bad accident and we were barely able to take care of ourselves for several days. We raise long and short coat Chihuahuas. We had often seen the dogs on their backs and their fur moving as if someone was petting them and we knew our ghosts loved our dogs. Anyway we were really out of it for at least four days yet our dogs were fed and watered and happy. We thought perhaps a friend or relative had done it but to date no one has come forward. The ghosts were two children and a man and we got to communicate with and see them through a friend that is a Cassadaga Medium.|`|0i4sNq2waa	Nope.

Unlike in the movies though, I never engaged in conversation with one, or even tried to communicate.      It was not until my latter years that I began to develop my own beliefs on the spiritual world.  Through meditation I have begun to believe in the separation of body and mind. I believe that ghosts are created through the permanent separation of mind and body through death.     But like I said I haven't seen a ghost since childhood (for better or for worse), so maybe it was just the result of an overactive imagination and too much spare time, or maybe it was something else. We all have our own beliefs on spirituality and religion, and it is solely up to us to decide whether or not those beliefs become reality.|`|GtazNrplaa	OOooh Yes I have seen the Holy Ghost once or twice or was that three times.

It is always active and there are demons but no ghosts.  There are angels we're unaware of in our presence as well.    Before I was dedicated to Christ, I experimented with occult practices. I used to be drawn to gravesites and once began to ask a 9 year old girl to visit with me who was burried in a gravesight in PA. After a while and without the protection of the blood of Christ (in a spiritual sense which means I accept Him as the only God and see the price He paid for my sins on the cross as holy in what has been the act of my salvation), a young girl's shadow appeared on my wall and moved across it in  my bedroom (in a different state than the one I was visiting and talking to a girl who could not hear me in the grave).   After that night I could be upstairs and audibly hear my piano playing downstairs frequently, had school books (I'd left inside my backpack-this was in high school) slam onto the floor in the center of my room in a pile and wake me from my sleep, lights would occasionally turn themselves on or a toilet seat would slam down on it's own. Once I could feel a cold hand on my shoulder at work and a deep, scratchy voice in my left ear yell "Oh ****!" I was DONE with that. It was oppression from the devil and his demons. I ended up coming to Christ later in high school after lots of questions and reading the Bible for myself and even debating in Sunday school at chruch until I discovered the God of the Bible-not the superGod or the love-only God we hear of today. Couldn't be more peaceful now.    None of that is false. Don't play with this stuff. It's more real (the supernatrual) than the skin you can pinch.

93fc57ca1c692acd2bd8f1bc7a446e6eaa	You have it right.  Baptism for the dead was practiced in the early church because baptism is essential for all of God's children, living and dead.  Paul was debating with the Saducees that didn't believe in resurrection but were still familiar with baptism for the dead.  Paul asks them why they do useless ordinances if there is no resurrection to worry about.  Clearly there is resurrection from Christ, therefore baptism is still important and God provided a way for all of His children to have baptism, via the vicarious ordinance for the dead.|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	If this isn't an obvious example of misinterpretation of scripture, I don't know what is.  Truly!  Since the bible says the things of God are spiritually discerned, and since Mormons are not born again and don't have the spirit of God, I don't doubt they have this exactly backwards.    The meaning of this verse is that baptism for the dead avails NOTHING.    Edit:  Becca, I'm sorry.  I thought you could put two and two together.  Since it comes to nothing, no one but Mormons, who misunderstand much of scripture, do this.|`|p6wwiQG3aa	Context  Always Helps    20 But now Christ is risen from the dead, and has become the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. 21 For since by man came death, by Man also came the resurrection of the dead. 22 For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ all shall be made alive. 23 But each one in his own order: Christ the firstfruits, afterward those who are Christs at His coming. 24 Then comes the end, when He delivers the kingdom to God the Father, when He puts an end to all rule and all authority and power. 25 For He must reign till He has put all enemies under His feet. 26 The last enemy that will be destroyed is death. 27 For He has put all things under His feet.[a] But when He says all things are put under Him, it is evident that He who put all things under Him is excepted. 28 Now when all things are made subject to Him, then the Son Himself will also be subject to Him who put all things under Him, that God may be all in all.  Effects of Denying the Resurrection       29 Otherwise, what will they do who are baptized for the dead, if the dead do not rise at all? Why then are they baptized for the dead?      It was a discussion about whether or not Jesus had ressurected and that the people who had been baptised in his name were baptised to life.    What  a hoser|`|0f6a1cdae0a3ce3617b1109a091741bdaa	God does love all human beings...but not all human love God. It is by accepting Jesus Christ as the Savior that one is saved from eternal death.     According to scripture, Jesus will not return until all those living have heard his name.     I don't know where the LDS church gets its belief from. You would need to ask someone who knows.|`|FyLfEPv0aa	Paul not only mentions it, but mentions it in support of the resurrection.    This shows that not only was he supportive of it, but had taught it beforehand.    Someone suggested that since he said "they" it means not Christians - then why is he using it to support his argument?    Now I'm a bit taken back at the audacity to say that since we LDS aren't "born again" we can't have the spirit and thus can't know what it really means written by the person who then clearly admits to not knowing what it means.  Just so you know, by definition of being "born again" by making promises to God, LDS people easily fit into that category.|`|2059629ba703ea51b813a449b0cb4431aa	Trying to make sense out of nonsense and superstition is truly a tremendous waste of time and effort. Have you considered reading a good book? Not "the" good book, "a" good book.|`|8jhACvtlaa	I take the context of that question to be a good discussion on resurrection as well.  I see the point of the question being, why in the heck are you guys practicing baptism for the dead, if you don't believe in the resurrection, because obviously if you're doing baptism for the dead, you should believe in a resurrection.    One Christian calling another Christian a hoser doesn't get any of us anywhere.|`|mrzeXJ6Eaa	Please read it again:    29: Else What shall THEY do which are baptized for the dead if the dead rise not at all? Why are THEY then baptized for the dead?    Paul did not say Christians baptized for the dead. Paul did not say Christians should baptize for the dead.     Why did Paul talk about those that do? 1 Corinthians 15 is talking about the resurrection. Paul is saying, "Even THEY believe and have hope in the resurrection, how much more should we."    The reason that "WE" don't baptize for the dead is:  Hebrews 9:27  And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:    After we are dead - it's too late.|`|8ipxhmNTaa	Most people don't believe in a God who sits up there with a big ledger and keeps track of who has what ordinance done for them.

FmazIF6Maa	It sounds to me like you need to begin with a lot of preliminary research. Start reading.    To answer your title question: One is a religion, the other is a practice, they can go together or be mutually exclusive.    - Wicca is a religion that originally was based on Pagan religions and the practice of Witchcraft.    - Witchcraft is a practice that can be combined with any religion, or no religion at all    - All Witches do not choose to be religious Wiccans    - Times have changed, and now, not all Wiccans bother practicing Witchcraft.      As for spells-- put that out of your head for now. You need to study first, educate yourself on the principles of magic, meditate and learn to focus, discipline your mind to alter your state of consciousness at will, raise and direct energy. These things take months to years of learning and practice before you'll be ready for spells.     Witchcraft is not an instant gratification shortcut, it is a complex discipline.|`|dPJr1Lbmaa	t, h, r, n, a, and f....      Emmm I did answer it!|`|tx4bRDrXaa	Deuteronomy 18:9-13|`|mMPjXbvcaa	Translation: Hi, I'm a 14 year old girl with evangelical Christian parents. I want to join the occult because I'm young and rebellious and have an active imagination. What's the best way to brainwash myself?    NO, IT DOESN'T WORK.|`|PRAd6MWwaa	okay so Wicca is a religion. A Witch is someone who practices witchcraft.  you can be Wicca and not practice witchcraft or practice witchcraft and not be Wiccan.|`|SDDgbtQ4aa	Wicca is but one of many pagan religions. One that mostly focuses on building a relationship with and honoring the God(s) AND Goddess(es), attuning to nature and the natural cycles of the year (keeping the Sabbats, the 8 holy days in the Wiccan wheel of the year), and living by a code of ethics based on the Wiccan Rede and the Law of Return.  http://wicca.timerift.net/    Witchcraft is a magical practice. Most commonly associated with spell casting, but also tends to include methods of divination and alternative/natural healing.  A witch is one who practices witchcraft.    Wicca and witchcraft can be practiced together, and they can compliment each other nicely, but one is not necessary to the other. There are Wiccans who are also witches, as there are Wiccans who are not also witches, and there are witches who do not practice the religion of Wicca.    "and does it work ?"  -  Does what "work"?  And how exactly are you thinking it should "work"?  If you have to question this, then how can you say you want to become a witch?  How do you know?  What is it about witchcraft that interests you?  Hopefully you are not getting your ideas about witchcraft and spells from TV and movies - because sorry, we just don't have all those flashy special effects and camera tricks to make our spells look cool and "work" instantly.      Spells are focused magic.  Magic is the manipulation of natural energies to bring about desired change. It's much much more than just lighting a couple of candles and reciting a catchy little rhyme.  One must learn the basic mechanics of magic - the hows and whys it works and doesn't work.  And how to control your mind, raise energy within yourself, focus/direct that energy, and release it into your spell.  That is the driving force behind making a spell work.  All the "ingredients" and other tools one may use in spellcrafting are just aids to help you focus your energies on your desired goal.    Becoming adept at witchcraft (becoming a "good witch"), is going to take years of study and practice.  In my opinion, it is a lifetime and lifestyle of continuous learning and growth.  If you are serious about studying this craft, I would start here:  http://www.amazon.com/Inner-Temple-Witch...  http://www.amazon.com/Before-You-Cast-Sp...    Blessings on your journey.|`|PM9MQHjRaa	Witchcraft is very bad, and very dangerous. My sister was into it, and it hurt her. After she left, we found all her books and burned them.  Stay away from witchcraft, and stay in the BIBLE. If you get in enough, you can get more power then any witch. No witch can raise the dead or cause missing limbs to grow. Christians can if they have faith.|`|W4CVo97daa	There are Wiccans (although very few) who do not practice magic. They would not be Witches, although the word Wicca and Witch come from the same roots.  Likewise, you can be a nondenominational Witch and not make it a religious thing at all, or you can blend other faiths with witchcraft that are not Wicca (although usually those faiths may not approve, it is still done). To be a good witch, it takes years of study, and no dabbling here and there. Read about it for a long time before you try anything. And the new age section of the book store is full of spellbooks, but until you study about things like poisonous herbs and safety, you should not try anything elaborate. Never leave candles unattended. If you can join a Yahoo group to get input from others, that should be more helpful than just asking here.|`|dz5Og81Qaa	Wicca is a religion. Witchcraft is a variety of practices some of which can be very dangerous. The best way to start is to read a lot and do a ton of research. You can start at the links below.    I have problems w/ some of the typical practices and rituals in Wicca. I've seen too many people have psychological changes (not in a good way) because of the material forces they use. Be careful what you wish for.     Magic is all about intention. To maintain safety and avoid problems it should be performed in group formation and w/o any hint of selfish intention. Your intention should always be to serve others and lift them up.|`|hoPAcskqaa	Okay Wiccans only: protect, banish, Bless, bind, and heal.  Witchcraft is just older and people link it to satansism( AND BTW SATANISM ISNT BAD IT IS ACTUALLY THE PURPOSE THAT THE DARK IS THERE TO MAKE THE LIGHT LOOK BRIGHTER).  Witchcraft is just older and deals with curses, hexes, holidays called sabbats, and they also do other interesting things. ITS NOT bad its just old and the catholic religion is afraid because they think people will turn to witchcraft because it doesnt have as many rules.  for more info on witchcraft go to my website  http://www.spellsformagic.co.nr

bK5MJCxhaa	Help?  In what way?    Meditation, as I have practiced it for the last four decades, is about creating a still mind with which to see things clearly.  I don't see how an intoxicant would aid that process.|`|77af9dfbcad746672b88d19627087b3aaa	I've done "journeys" using a few things.  a little ganja wouldn't hurt your meditation.  Shamans have been using "enhancers" forever.  Just don't over do it. a few tokes should be more than enough.|`|4Zbjx8bCaa	Meditation is supposed ot be able to do that without marijuana.    But yeah, a lot of people did that, interpreted it as trances and enlightenment. I've never been able to get a natural high.    But yes you can do that, some people used incense to get high, other hyperventilated for oxygen highs, or didn't drink water for dehydrations highs, you know those African shamans who frequently went on spirit walks using drugs and potions.    That's what they were doign.    I still  believe in the paranormal and all occult stuff though.|`|Y6odIQgJaa	I wouldn't, nor would I consume alcohol before meditating.    It is important to have a trust in the meditation, and low-level spirits love to mess with your head when you're in an altered state of consciousness.|`|4068ddb702bdc41558e963e223abc40eaa	Not a good idea.    I know people who have been meditating for a long time, and they regret ever having done drugs.|`|bGUWUgUqaa	In the Buddhist practice, smoking is a human addiction, an attachment, that works against the purification process.|`|aCXca3WEaa	No. both are sins to our savior.|`|UR4mWefGaa	It certainly would not hurt|`|YNMnVjltaa	It helps to smoke a cigarette.|`|b9WPmK9Raa	No.Many people seem to think mind altering substances such as marijuana or LSD may help with religious or spiritual experiences but in reality all it does is distract one from a true spiritual path and it only clouds the mind and prevents true spiritual growth.

AA11648578	Christ is not a division. Christians are the body of Christ and should be one as God is one. No one is called by Christ to be Catholic or Baptist.|`|eBKJRmEgaa	They decide between themselves of course. They're both of the same religion, so there's hardly a problem there.  Personally, I'd rather let the kids decide for themselves.|`|NCRfZRopaa	Leave it up to the kids to decide.|`|8pQrIL90aa	The man should choose to follow the LORD first, and his wife should be willing to follow him as he prays to make the right choice for his family.|`|JyAUAbsjaa	Instead of "choosing" one religion, why not explain to them when they are older the pros and cons of each religion and let them decide?|`|HOQp0gA7aa	If it means that much to you as to which splinter sect of Christianity your kids are raised to believe, then I highly suggest you don't marry outside of your splinter sect then.|`|9q7UPZIfaa	Who is more dominating in the relationship?    Well, wait, allow the kids to spend time with both religion, they will make the decision.|`|WZ6YXDODaa	let them decide for themselves|`|DArAz67Caa	they should not be married in the first place-----God prohibits marriages of the like in the bible----both should find middle ground----such as Evangelicalism|`|VmGcNErkaa	Satanism OMFG hands down!|`|zMcHYQeBaa	According to the Catholic church, you must be baptized into Catholicism or you are not Catholic. You have to go through the sacraments|`|Iw9YK558aa	I have a friend who is evangelical. Her husband is an athiest (and a physicist as it happens!) Apparently it works really well as they both give their opinions and beliefs. I think the child will be more well rounded because of it. At least any decision about religion will be entirely his choice and an independent decision, which is more than I can say for a lot of Christians... or people of any religion, actually.|`|cf84769c39c0ba4a53a95535563ec1e3aa	Kids shouldn't have to choose.  Initially they'll follow which ever parent  takes them to Church/Temple...After a time they should be allowed to question that faith and do some exploration on their own and develop their own belief system. Of course there will be possible conflict as a result of being given that freedom...but religion is a choice and should made freely.  Suggest Unitarian Universalism check it out at www.uua.org.|`|0f6a1cdae0a3ce3617b1109a091741bdaa	That is something that needs to be discussed before you have kids. Then each of you need to support whatever the decision is. Or, if you want to be a little inventive, take the kids to both churches and let them make their own decision when they are old enough.    Better yet, don't concentrate on churches...concentrate on the personal relationship with God and Jesus that they can have. Religions and traditions were made by man, not by God or Jesus so why push for one or the other. God and Jesus are the center...and they have that with both or with none.|`|saDjgQkxaa	Give the kids a choice. People have the right to choose which religion they follow, if any.|`|Lk4aCBACaa	I'd say leave it up to the kids to decide when they're old enough.    But if someone is Catholic, the Church wants them to agree to raise any children of the marriage in the Catholic faith. It depends on how devout the Catholic is.

I hope she does not waste her time or ours.|`|r8rykCkGaa	Really?  I thought she made a comment to the tune of she wanted to do what was best for her family (and now she had the chance since she didn't make it to vice president).  So, you think it's God's will for her to be president in 2012?  Someone gave a prophecy saying she will be running against Hillary Clinton for president.  That would be crazy!!!  I sure hope not.  Don't want Hillary at all!!!|`|t315IBLNaa	NoNoNoNoNoNoNo    I'm glad she's gone.|`|PNwr3JgBaa	Sarah Palin vs Obama for 2012, I couldn't imagine more of a landslide.|`|nPfxPidTaa	Bahahahhhhhahha|`|AA6Aq94vaa	I'm praying she goes away and doesn't come back|`|g6OlCaOlaa	NO WAY!

Nothing would do more to completely eliminate any chance of a return to Republican misrule than for the idiots to nominate that clueless snake-handling secessionist.|`|AA12257580	I don't pray. On my list for 2012 is to move to England.     "She's on mine?"    I'm Ron Burgundy?|`|Limt9t5Qaa	I actually do NOT pray for any specific person to lead this great country of ours. All we have left in the end is to pray simply for Gods will to be done. No matter who is elected Gods will will be done and what he said will cometo pass. Pray for our leaders regardless of who they are. God Bless President Obama. God bless former president Bush and god bless any future presidents to come.|`|ATsdSM7saa	Sarah Palin is utterly one of the stupidest people to ever run for any form of higher office.

Maybe you're exotic looking or you're just that hot.|`|buD1m0S7aa	Hi! Thank God i'm not the only person with that problem. I couldn't tell you why they stare because i don't know what you look like but i can only assume that you must be very beautiful to look at. Maybe you are tall and skinny and you know what that means.....Girls are usually envious of girls who they think look better than them.They start having what i call the 'wish factor' conversation in their heads. Most of them wouldn't tell you to your face, they would just think it and stare. Don't know, have you ever thought of asking why they are staring?     It's not rude to ask, it can be done in so many different ways. Like you could politely ask if you remind them of someone they know....I would and have asked before, there's nothing wrong with asking just do it with a smile.|`|AA11155768	Could it be because you have this paranoid look on your face because you think everyone is staring at you?    I know someone else that thought the same thing, I had to tell her it was because of her B.O. She thought it was because she was beautiful. LOL.     I'm not trying to be a smartass but seriously, you sound a little paranoid.  |`|YKZuidoRaa	ur interesting to look at maybe?|`|YZMRB68xaa	Same thing happens to me at college, I have no clue why :S|`|e70ad6c3a63e2f345c6a1d43c5a535d0aa	Are you sure they are staring at you and not your boyfriend|`|SvQ1s6zraa	because they are just jealous of what they cant have. hey... if you got 'em, flaunt 'em!

jtEOvGKsaa	Yes I have doubted my faith many times.  I resolve my doubt by researching with a counter claim on whatever claim they put on me or my religion and when I understand that their claim is either wrong or misunderstood, I resolve my doubt..|`|OAjN34M4aa	All Christians go through spiritually dry seasons, times of doubt and spiritual confusion. This doesn't mean God isn't with you; usually it is a time of testing that precedes a greater revelation or closeness with God. Don't give up on God and He won't give up on you.    I know this doesn't answer your question, but I am addressing any Christians who state that they have never doubted or questioned their faith. They may even be telling the truth. But their time will come. All the people of the Bible who were closest to God (except Jesus) did. Even Elijah.|`|4068ddb702bdc41558e963e223abc40eaa	Christians and all religions need to question their faith because "by their fruits ye shall know them." If a religion is giving bad fruit, like leading to violence and destruction, then the faith is bringing bad fruit.    So I think that everyone has to question their faith from time to time.|`|atAZlwGdaa	I am Muslim, but I have questioned my religion and assumed it was my faith. Recently I find that my religion and faith are completely different and I only rely on my faith. I kept researching and still am to find all the additions men have made to my religion, which has helped me come back to the scripture and eliminate all other writings and sayings etc.|`|564d359090a6d360bec9ee3849107a51aa	No I never question my faith or relationship with God and His Son Jesus. |`|jg5Ii27Vaa	i question God all the time....i do not doubt Him. that's something different. with questions you find answers.|`|b7Lo5IAZaa	Actions coincide with faith.

And then I found mine, and I learned to have a good foundation as well.|`|7d647be57724929a656a84a04d156140aa	I can't ever remembering doubting my faith, but I felt like giving up many times, however, when I remember how good God is to me, I can't do it.  I just began to pray and ask God for His strength which is sufficient for me.  Read His Words, listen to hymns and pray.|`|so3f7mzOaa	I was going on a bender a minute ago, but I'm going to calm myself and give you a real answer.  I was raised Christian, but a lot of it felt wrong to me.  Like, why should I hate a gay person?  I mean, if he killed my family I'd hate him, but one I never met?  That's not right.  So I just sat and thought about it, and realized that God is love and the things that the Church teaches are man-made ideas, in addition to God's word.  You know, mixing a lie with the truth makes a lie so much stronger.  I decided that listening to a fellow human being on how to get close to God was stupid, because even preachers have agendas.  They teach what they're supposed to or they'll lose their position.  I have a very strong faith in God, but I learned that humans are way too fallible to trust with something like that.  So I don't follow any religion anymore.  I simply have a relationship with God, which is what I believe he wants. 
2Gvzy9y3aa	The difference is that Jesus wasn't alive in the new testament and the Hebrew's god wasn't the real God and they worshiped the wrong god.  Hope this helped!:)|`|SsB7aRExaa	The salvation that was possible in the Old Testament was based on the sacrifice of Jesus Christ.  God, knowing all things (including what we call 'the future'), imputed the sacrifice of Christ to the OT believers.  The sacrifices of the Mosaic Law simply POINTED to the future sacrifice of Christ.  By themselves, they could not pay for sin at all.  That required a perfect, holy sacrifice, who could be what Job called a "daysman", or mediator. A man who could act as our representative to God, because he did not need a sacrifice for himself.  That man was Jesus Christ.    "For there is ONE mediator between God and Man, the Man Christ Jesus."   1 Timothy 2:5|`|ewWUFWyWaa	Basically the preachers will tell you that salvation in the OT is for Jews only... The NT especially the Gospel of Saint John teaches that "he came to his own and his own received him not" so now there is a need of a New Testament..!!!  that's in a nutshell is the "sweetest story ever told..."|`|X9rXRNUxaa	People did NOT create the New Testament !    GOD DID !    Matthew 7:14  Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.     John 14:6  Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.     May God bless you as you study His Word    |`|AA11008046	Salvation in the Old testament was gained through the killing of a lamb, bullock or whatever and the blood being put over the door of your residence and so on.  Salvation in the New Testament was obtained by the precious blood of the Lamb; Jesus being shed for all mankind from the time of the cross until the end of time as we know it now.  Slight difference but the meaning is the same and it was still shed blood that was the sacrificial atonement for sin.|`|0f6a1cdae0a3ce3617b1109a091741bdaa	In order to achieve salvation is the Old Testament, a person would have to have been perfect in action and thought. When they could not be, God asked them to sacrifice animals to him in repentence of their sins. But, even though the forgiveness was given, man continued to go back to the old ways and needed more forgiveness ...and on and on and on.     God found that man was not capable on his own of achieving perfection (meaning without sin)...so he sent the one perfect sacrifice to cleanse men for all time if they would only believe. Jesus came to the earth to take man's sins upon himself. He was the perfect sacrifice because he had no sin of his own...because he was of God.  We can not free ourselves. The people of the Old Testament proved that conclusively.    That is why Jesus is referred to as "The Lamb of God". Lambs were the traditional sacrifice of the nation of Israel.|`|OkPDVfh6aa	I'm just guessing ..so don't delete my answer. MAYBE... the OT people were "saved" ... but MAYBE after they died they didn't know where to go..so MAYBE Jesus came to show them the way (to God/Heaven) . In the NT... Jesus had Moses etc. appear on the mountain and Jesus said  "God is the God of the Living...not the dead." It also says that Jesus ..after He died... went and got the people who were hanging around somewhere in the spirit world...maybe they were the saved ones.  I'm NOT saying this is true ..and I've never thought of this before now. Just thought of it. Don't take it as the "Gospel Truth". Besides...how would anyone know what Jesus did after He left the earth? Maybe He told his disciples that's what He was going to do.  SO MUCH is left out of the NT...and probably the OT too. Remember...it wasn't a book until people put all the writings people left into a book. Just like history books. Stuff happens..and people leave  letters and writings and word of mouth stories about what happened..then people put it all into a history book and it's taught to kids.|`|M7rdNZgVaa	I believe no one was getting to heaven because God is holy and can not look at sin - so he sent his son Jesus to take away the sin of the people and the new testament is about salvation-     Take a look at this website :    http://www.freecdtracts.com/    all you questions of salvation should be answered. also check out the heaven & hell   7 youths of columbia section and you will see what salvation is|`|vMFKIc4Jaa	Well, if there's already an Old and a New, why did the JW's make a new one after that too?    Same thing, they keep adding what doesn't need to have additions.|`|vvgodUChaa	they never received salvation in the old it was atonment and that had to be done every year,but christ ussered in a new covenant where our sins are all taken away and we receive his life this is salvation eternal life,if you could lose this it would not be eternal hope this helps!|`|vmv1rP76aa	Interesting point Sirius (always love your posts). I cannot answer for you totally, but what I do think is that Jesus WAS a messenger to try and address the people who took the OT the wrong way and he tried to reform some aspects of Israel, but he never wanted to be worshipped or anything like that. (again just my opinion).     In the movie "The Last Temptation of Christ", Jesus has a dream with Paul. Paul tells Jesus if he wants him to die for everyone's sins he will.     I believe that totally happened in real life.    Edit: Blue Foot has a great point.|`|pakIAYWoaa	jesus told a story of Lazaruz and a rich man both dead and in the center of the earth, the one man was in torment and agony the other was in comfort but not in heaven...It says jesus when he died descened first and he led captivity captive...this is the redemption of the Old testament saints were saved by faith seeing the savior afar off; Christ death was the payment for their sins as well they looked forward we look back..the old testament promised another prophet like moses, another covenant(in jeremiah) another high priest according to the order of Melchezedek...the book of Hebrews deals with this subject well..|`|b0NccAFFaa	Salvation is received by faith in God. This is the way it was done in the Old Testament, although on a limited basis. The New Testament is an extension of the Old Testament in that it offers this same gospel of salvation by faith, to everyone. So nothing different is being taught, just expanded.|`|LlurBCwnaa	SKEPTICAL IS RIGHT!    SALVATION HAS ALWAYS BEEN THROUGH CHRIST ALONE.  THERE IS NO OTHER WAY TO SALVATION!    GOD GAVE ALL THE CEREMONIAL RITES SO THE MINDS OF THE OT FOLK WOULD BE DIRECTED BY FAITH TO JESUS WHO IS THE LAMB OF GOD SLAIN FROM THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD!|`|MiAOnwN6aa	It is believed no one actually went to heaven before Christ died & rose from the dead. But salvation was guaranteed for the good ones while they existed in another state of bliss.

If you'd like to learn how to defend yourself (if you want to learn to defend yourself quickly, versus taking years to learn a combat sport like boxing, or a traditional martial art like Karate), it would probably be best to look for a school that teaches Krav Maga or Jeet Kune Do in your area, or just a gym that teaches generic class called something like ''self-defense for women.''

The   Melchizedek Priesthood was a special priesthood and was spoken about only a few times in the Old testament and the book of Hebrew.  Gen 14:18, Psa 110:4 and Heb 5:6-10, 6:20 and 7:1-10.|`|dc00e6f724cc094e75dc0475843d0e44aa	Mormon doctrine teaches that the Priesthood of Aaron is a preparatory priesthood, a lessor priesthood, a priesthood of training whereas the Priesthood of Melchizedek is the greater priesthood, the priesthood held by Melchizedek and Jesus Christ.      Named after Aaron and Melchizedek respectively.      Its in the Bible.|`|AA10637643	Others have given some good answers.  Remember that the Priesthood is literally the power to act in God's name...    Basically, the person who holds the type of Priesthood has the authority to perform different ordinances.  There are many ordinances in the gospel pertaining to salvation and exaltation.  Aaronic Priesthood holders can bless the sacrament and baptize.  That's about it, because it is a "lesser" Priesthood, so less responsibility is given.  The higher Priesthood, Melchezidek, has more responsibilites, as well as the Aaronic resposibilites.  A man who has the authority to seal a marriage for time and all eternity, or to give a Patriarchal blessing, must have the Melchezidek Priesthood and be ordained to that office.  (As a Patriarch or Sealer).|`|OxuLUCX9aa	This is not Mormon or LDS theology. This is Hebrew Yahwist theology.

All those who gave me a thumbs down please go check correct history because you don't know what your talking about. Your taking Hebrew history and merging it in with this pagan Christianity.|`|ybpUb6HCaa	None. It's all bull, because it's JEWISH, not Mormon, and like the rest of the christians, they've taken jewish scriptures and perverted them for their own uses.    The Jews have writings that show that Melchitzedek was Shem, a direct paternal ancestor of Aaron. Since the Priesthood is a bloodline inherited position, passed down paternally through the males, father to son, this means that Melchitzedek and Aaron are the SAME lineage priesthood.    Here is the lineage:      Noah   Shem ( = Melchizedek)   Arpachshad   Shelah   Eber   Peleg   Reu   Serug   Nahor   Terah   Abraham   Isaac   Jacob   Joseph   Levi   Kohath   Amram   Aaron ( = First High Priest)   Moses         I'd always go with what the Jews have for their book, they have the original meanings of whats in there instead of the later changes and omissions that Christians made.    EDIT: Tony, yes he did. Just because you don't know about it doesn't mean it doesn't exist. It's in ancient jewish writings and it names exactly who he was and who his parents were. You are probably unaware that the Written Torah (the old testament) is a very small part of the entire Torah. When the Catholics stole it from the Jews they neglected to take the entire thing, which is why Christians are basically clueless about what anything means in it. The Oral Torah was also given to Moses on Mt. Sinai, and is the largest part of the Torah, containing all the explanations given by God as to what is in the Written Torah.     This is Judaism. These are Jewish books, not Christian. Try to remember that, and remember that your knowledge of it is very small. Then go and learn, if you want to know more, rather than rejecting what you're taught about what actually exists out there.    Oh and when the Catholics discovered the Oral Torah in the 1200s they actually held a TRIAL for it, for BOOKS, and then burned them at the stake. LOLOL!  Of course they were not able to find and murder enough Jews to get all of the copies.  You can imagine what else contradicts the ridiuclous meanings that Christianity has given to the Written Torah, that's only the tip of the iceberg. If you're interested, go learn!|`|32xRsYa9aa	The Melchizedek Priesthood was a fore-shadow of Jesus. Read the passage in Genesis.  And He had no geneology, Schmo.

E7Ulqodqaa	Baptist is Christian actually. It's just another denomination like Lutheran and Catholic. Baptism doesn't wipe away your sins, that is done through repentance. Baptism is an outward sign of an inward change. It is to show others that you dedicate your life to follow God. If you are asking how to be saved, here is a verse form the Bible "if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved." Romans 10:9. I hope this helps! :)|`|eAMq1iBWaa	It's the first step in the Christian walk.

We believe that getting baptized is following in obedience to what the bible says....believe and be baptized.    It is public confession of the change that has taken place in you. Gone is the old you, and now that Christ lives in you, you are made new.    It is an outward symbol of a change that  has been made inside of you.    It does not make you perfect. We can never be perfect. It is a sign that Jesus lives in you and that because He died on that cross, your sins are forgiven. Your sins are washed away, you are made clean.|`|7wMZIuooaa	I was also baptized again for the second time and I was 30 at the time.  You do feel clean when you come up out of the water.  You can also feel a little tearful, you have accepted the gift that Jesus gave you freely, so just enjoy every minute of it.  Of course this is only the beginning, its up to you then to use all the gifts that Jesus has waiting for you and there are many.    God-bless you and may you have a truly wonderful day and life.|`|7d647be57724929a656a84a04d156140aa	Baptizmn doesn't take away your sins.  It symbolizes the death, burial and ressurection of Jesus Christ.  You must accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your own and personal Saviour that what takes your sin away.|`|lUFBlZ6haa	getting baptised does not wash away sin.

I am pointing this out as it saddens me to hear of Christians sounding like they are separating themselves from each other because of the church they choose to attend.  Remember.. it is because of Jesus' disciple who carried forward His word is what formed the many churches and denominations we have today.  At the end of the day, all that matters is that we accept Jesus, act in a manner that makes others want to seek out Jesus and have their lives changed because of Him.    Being baptized you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit, which is an awesome feeling.  Yes, you will be forgiven of your sins.  And a the great part is that you are now embarking on continuing to change from the inside out.    As a Christian, I am always changing, growing, making better decisions for myself and trying to improve myself.    God bless!|`|i6Mi8uWIaa	Well, we Catholics believe that baptism washes away all previous sin, especially the stain of original sin. We acknowledge one baptism, that is, baptism in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. As such, because the only two sects that don't baptize in this form are the Mormons and the Jehovah's Witnesses, those are the only two sects whose baptisms we don't recognize as valid.    I feel for you, being baptized in December, especially if you live in a colder region. I was baptized at the Easter Vigil, and the water was cold enough! It's worse if you're dunked instead of having the water poured on your head.     Just remember that just because your baptism has washed away all of your previous sins, that doesn't mean you can go on sinning with impunity. You still have to repent when you screw up! |`|crJ0fHZhaa	Baptism means dedicating your life to Jesus to do the will of Jehovah. (Psalm 40:7,?8) The baptism in water doesn't cleanses our sins. It is the blood of Christ. Consider these verses..    1?John 1:7: If we are walking in the light as he himself is in the light, .?.?. the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin. (Thus, not baptismal water but the blood of Jesus cleanses us from sin.)    Acts 22:16: Rise, get baptized and wash your sins away by your calling upon his name. (Also Acts 10:43) (Calling upon Jesus' name is necessasry for our sins to be washed away)|`|AA12055082	According to the Bible, baptism is the public declaration of the private dedication that you have made to God himself to put his will ahead of your own in your life.

You should know that it is a commitment to serve God not just to be washed clean. Study your Bible and then get baptized.|`|q2dl4yaCaa	Congratulations!! Getting Baptized will help you develop your relationship with Jesus so that you may live in Him, and obey Him. Yes this will wash away your sins and provide you with a new life in Him, as long as you repent. In fact repenting and truly accepting Jesus as your Lord and Savior is the only way our sins get washed away, and we get to start over. It's just when you get Baptized you physically dedicate yourself to Christ.     To be Baptized is to be buried (be submerged in the water, saturated) and resurrected (born again, taken out of the water) as a new creature in Him (Christ Jesus). So be sure you are Baptized in Him (in Jesus name), not just the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit because Jesus is the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit as you can see in the following passage.    NKJV 1 John 5:6 This is He who came by water and bloodJesus Christ; not only by water, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit who bears witness, because the Spirit is truth. 7 For there are three that bear witness in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one.    Be Baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.    Ac 2:38 Then Peter said to them, "Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.      This important because there is much power in the name of Jesus, and the following.    NKJV John 14:13 And whatever you ask in My name, that I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.     NKJV John 14:14 If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.       Jesus has called us to be Holy. Which can be done if we abide in Him, submit to Him, and be lead by His Holy Spirit.    1 Peter 1:13 Therefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and rest your hope fully upon the grace that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ; 14 as obedient children, not conforming yourselves to the former lusts, as in your ignorance; 15 but as He who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct, 16 because it is written, "Be holy, for I am holy."    NKJV JohN 15:7 If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you    Also the following will happen when getting closer to Jesus.    NKJV Joh 14:26 But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.      I was a member of the Baptist Denomination at one point. Now I belong to a Non-denomination Church considering there are no man made Denominations mentioned in the Bible only "The Way" of Jesus.
1pFcDyeDaa	The Old Testament (Tanakh) was written long before the New Testament.  The New Testament wasn't written until after Yeshua's death.  While He walked the earth, there was no NT.

I lived in a house for 3 years that had something going on in it. My mom & I would see things, for a whole month our spoons would be gone. They'd show up a month later. Things would fall, be moved, disappear. My room was always cold, I swore I had somebody in there. Just a feeling. My dresser drawers would be open, clothes on my floor as if someone was looking for something. Doors open & close, curtains shifted, animals meowing, barking, staring at nothingness. Shower curtain would always be open, even though we closed it. Phone, tv static, tv volumes going way up, phone ringing, no one there. Webcam  being weird.|`|ZGVoOImqaa	Nope.|`|wUMDl0Gvaa	No.    I think that there is life before birth (or conception).    "For the past forty years, doctors at the University of Virginia Medical Center, beginning with Dr. Ian Stevenson, have conducted research into young childrens reports of past-life memories. Now, in Life Before Life, Dr. Jim B. Tucker shares these studies with the general public.    Children who report past-life memories typically begin talking about a previous life when they are two to three years old. The children tend to show a strong emotional involvement with the apparent memories and often cry to be taken to the previous family. In many cases, parents have taken their children to the places they named, where they found that an individual had died whose life matched the details given by the child. During the visits, some children have recognized family members or friends from that individuals life. Many children have also had birthmarks that matched wounds on the body of the deceased individual.    Life Before Life explores the various features of this worldwide phenomenon, describing numerous cases along the way. It is a landmark workone that has the potential to challenge and ultimately change our understandings about life and death."  http://www.lifebeforelife.com/|`|haBrp4BAaa	I believe that you roam the earth as a spirit for a little while after you are dead, then you get reincarnated. I believe in ghosts because I always feel something watching me at night. I once heard a ghost whisper and saw a spirit at night leap from a tree.|`|Tl8taAGAaa	i blive that ghosts are life after death. but the only way you can sense them is through astral awarness. and ghost aren't evil. if you say all ghosts are evil your saying the ghosts who are mere children are evil.   however some are evil as well. i personally. i contact my dead friend through astral projection. i stay astral at least an hour everyday just to spend time with her. i also have had other experiences. my great grandmother and my moms friend both reside in my house to watch over me. i also have my guardian. or familiar as i refer to him as    haha papa g. do you realize you disproved your life after death belif of heaven. if you are concious of nothing in death then there must not be life after death which therefore means no heaven. hahahahahahahahahahaha. ironic how the bible disproves itself for me|`|tFzREDgFaa	Death is the opposite of life. The dead do not see or hear or think. Not even one part of us survives the death of the body. We do not possess an immortal soul or spirit.  They are conscious of nothing at all. The dead are at rest; they do not suffer.  There is no after life and you dont become a ghost.     Most people who experience seeing a ghost or the paranormal its not their loved ones but actually they are demons.|`|b7nooJXEaa	let get this stright the Spirit don't die, take a good look.  1. Revelation 20:10 And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.  if you or dead, why are you tormented day and night for ever and ever  2.Revelation 20:15 And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.  Have you ever seen a Spirit die? if so you are trying to make God a lie, because is a Spirit.  John 4:24 God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.|`|TUxfoPpHaa	Most cultures believe in life after death as do most religions in some form or another. I am a ghost hunter and have had a few experiences. I do believe that they exist. I had my first real encounter when I was 12 moving into an old home. I was to stay and wait for the movers to come with our stuff and my family went into town to purchase the stove and refrigerator etc. I went up to check out my room (it was the first time to have my own room and the first time I had seen it since we moved cross country). I heard a noise downstairs and saw a man in the kitchen. I figured he must be a mover so I started talking to him, chattering on like a young girl would "Hey, can you bring my stuff in first? I have my own room now! Its really cool. you wanna come see it?" He never spoke back, and when we turned the corner into the living room, he disappeared. I decided to wait outside for the movers after that. Later others in the family and friends would see this man downstairs and sometimes you would see a woman upstairs. Months later we found a painting in the attic of the house and this man and woman on the front porch. This was a historically proved fact that this couple existed in this house. It sparked my believe in ghosts and since then I have had a hand-full of my own experiences to continue my belief.|`|JbaW27KNaa	Yes, they do exist. I will be SOON.    They're those souls of the dead who cant rest in peace coz they still have some unfinished business to do.     These are souls who can't accept they're dead and still want to join the living world.     Some souls do not know they're dead and still around us, mingling with us.    I MIGHT BE ONE OF EM SOON...  |`|8di5Wn3naa	No. Ghosts do not exist. When you are dead, you are dead.|`|55q8s8aAaa	I believe there's something after death, but I don't know what.

You can just come right out and say it, but if you just go about BEING that way rather obviously they'll be less shocked. You decide who you love and who you marry, if they want to think it's a phase or immaturity, fine, doesn't change who you are.     Besides, they can eat their words at your wedding someday.

18be83adf26491424d29aa61ef0530d6aa	Yes, without a doubt.  I'd put my hand on a bible and say that, if it would help you believe me--and I don't take doing that lightly.|`|ZJ2k7Ynqaa	It's not love as some define it, it's more of a caring for your well-being.|`|aWcD7Ou5aa	I Absolutely, 100%, beyond a shadow of a doubt, love the crap out of you.  I'm not here to judge you.  I don't understand why you believe what you do, but I would defend with my life your right to believe it.  I believe Christians who do not love you and treat you poorly will be judged more harshly by God then those who do not believe.|`|PkBMMvqTaa	I have many friends, some are not Christians.  Yes, I love them, they are wonderful. I pray for those who are lost. I hope no one should miss out on the love Christ has for them.  All the rest of religion, is just a big mess. That is what i don't like.|`|7d647be57724929a656a84a04d156140aa	I don't know about everybody, but I am a Christian and I truly do love everybody, that surely mean you atheist, I truly do love you.  I might not love what someone do to me or say to me at times, but I practice forgiveness and release that person, so that I can have peace and live with myself.  However, do you love other people, really???|`|f3nwI8ytaa	Sure.  I almost never say something I don't mean unless I'm joking.  But I don't understand Christian love to be a feeling.  So experiencing love for you doesn't quite connect.  I honestly think you are more important and valuable than I am.  And I'm willing to sacrifice my well-being for your sakes.  That's love as I understand it.  Do I ever struggle to love you?  Of course.  I'm a selfish, cold-hearted bast*rd.  I struggle at times to care about you at all.  It would be far easier to simply decide you don't exist.      peace|`|517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	Yes. There are different kinds of love. Christian "love" doesn't mean experiencing an emotional love. It means we intend out of charity to love you as a brother or sister, not worse or better than anyone else, because we're all creatures of God. In some ways, this type of love is similar to the dynamics of love in a family. Family members can disagree and argue view points and about what is right and wrong, but in the end, it's with the best of intentions; they accept the reality of each other for who they are, even if they don't agree, and they pray for the very best for each other.  So yes, I love you.    If sometimes Christians seem pushy, it's because Christianity started out as missionary faith and our way of showing charity (love) is to share the truth as we've found it. You may not agree with the truth, but again, it's with the intention of charity that we want to share what we've found. We also want the space to live it.|`|thX0nH8Aaa	I actually do LOVE YOU!! As hard as that is to believe. Once a person has given their life over to the Lord, and He fills them with His Holy Spirit, then you have this love for people that you just can;t describe. I think it comes straight from the heart of God. I think He allows us to feel a little of what He feels for you. So go to bed tonight knowing that not only I, but Jesus Christ loves you VERY VERY MUCH!!!  God bless you my friend!|`|9e250a05d954f6c73a9b8b369c78dd43aa	Listen for a moment yourself. You try to insult our beliefs and you think we won't get upset at some point? If you came to me personally and you didn't insult my God I would not get angry.  I have some people in my life that are not Christians and I still Love them and believe me I love everyone. You must know that when someone confronts you with the truth it is because he loves you. When someone though says what "you like to hear" he is only looking for your favor and attention right?   So when you ask me something I will answer with truth in what I believe in because I am looking for your own good. Why would it be otherwise? I am trying to make you see what I see and not what I don't!  God Bless|`|5TyZJTFsaa	We're all people!Not all Christians are weird and I don't get why people on Yahoo!Answers think we are.At the end of the day,we're all equal.Some of my best friends don't believe in God and I still love them.We're all entitled to our own opinions and it's just wrong for people to try and impose their beliefs on other people.I love who I love,Christian or not.|`|AA10265685	Dude, are you serious?  That is quite hateful, if you think that we can't love an atheist?  Man, I genuinely love atheists. Some are easy to love.  Some, it is a choice.  But then again, I have struggles loving some "Christians" too.|`|6B0vOqD9aa	Yes I can honestly say that I love atheist . And no I can't say that I always feel love for them, But anyone who knows anything about true love knows it has absolutely nothing to do with feelings anyways . Love is an action a commitment , Feelings and emotions are the shallowest most unreliable part of a persons personality. God bless.|`|4xLqf5ASaa	When I first got on R&S I got into a couple of back and forth argumentative questions to "win debates".  I don't do that any more. I just try to answer serious questions and let the chips fall where they may. Sometimes I get thumbs up and sometimes I get thumbs down. Often I get thumbs down from other Christians.  I am a Christian, which means I am a HUMAN BEING who is saved, therefore, I make many mistakes.  I can honestly say that I do love atheists, agnostics, fellow Christians, and people of other faiths. Many years ago, I was an atheist.  I also checked out other faiths and even occultic beliefs, and unknowingly joined a "Christian" cult.  I cannot look down on other people.  I think you are deceived, but, you think that I am deceived.  You are entitled to that opinion.  I struggle with getting angry at, not just atheists, but Christians and anyone else who answer questions out of meanness and one up-manship.  That's OK. I'm learning to just pass on most of that stuff here.  Have a nice day.|`|e29cLlyBaa	How many stars have you received from the church going Christians who answered your question and gave lip service to loving Atheists,  but wouldn't as much as say that your question was interesting.   Churches follow Paul, who taught the death of Jesus. A very selfish doctrine (emphasis)  of we are lucky that we will go Heaven. Few churches teach the life and death of Jesus.    ***I am a Sermon on the Mount Christian. We don't believe in church buildings or pep rallies.

Another big things is:     In spanish, you can say "(s)he is 'name'". You have to say, their name is.     You can either say "se llama(n)" or "Su nombre es / Sus nombres son"|`|tQsxsuNPaa	Una papa  = a potato.  you have a potato in your family?   and no such thing as una hermano...adjectives and nouns MUST MATCH.      vivamos is incorrect.    Don't forget to add your accents.  Best if you always do that correctly from the beginning.   chef is French...look up the Spanish word for the same.   comico is wrong...you have two people you are describing, you need a PLURAL adjective...and I would use divertido, anyway.   Cantar is not conjugated...you need the l form.  El gustar is COMPLETELY INCORRECT!  Go back and learn how to use gustar properly.  Connie atraccin mucho.  This doesn't mean anything...you need a verb to make a sentence.  In all languages.   again, gustar is incorrect...and so is nade.  uno anos is wrong.  llamas...that would be the t form...not ellas.  ellas tiene...what is wrong, here?   todos mascotas (agreement, plus you need a definite article, here.) son muy guardo????  what?  They are very I keep?  Shipshewana!  My aunt's dog is named Shipshewana!  They found her there!  (just an aside!:))  Minta??? Is that her name?  then ok...if it's supposed to be Spanish...nope.  Sus viven...you know better.  I know you do.   perro...two rs.  I'm gonna assume that's just a typo.  Mi familia is singular...use mira.  common mistake    Interesting diet, there!  I didn't learn Zanahoria until I was 20!   Escuchamos msica...no a.  Escuchar = to listen to.  the only time you use an a is when there's a person you are listening to...then it is the personal a.   Cantar needs to be conjugated.  vamanos is a command, and no la.   pero miramos mi abuelos = but we look at my grandparents (which needs that personal a, btw, as does amo).  son...again, familia is singular. and mi must be plural to agree with abuelos.  but you don't go look at your grandparents...you SEE them.

Thus agnosticism is in a way atheism, but the dynamics of this semantic debate are a little more complicated.    Agnosticism originally meant (and still means for those who care to actually look it up) one cannot have absolute certainty on a given topic (not necessarily God). When it comes to supernatural claims agnosticism is the only real position one can take since the supernatural is untestable by definition. However being agnostic on the supernatural doesn't mean to give the idea of supernatural any sort of validity as one can assign a probability of supernatural occurrences so low it can generally be rounded to nonexistence while leaving the door a crack open for further evidence. In this respect one can be an agnostic while simultaneously being either an atheist or theist. Theism from a purely philosophical standpoint is quite compatible with agnosticism, but agnosticism doesn't work well with mainstream religion since any room for doubt is filled with the notion of faith.    Today agnosticism has become an imaginary middle ground. Agnostics are usually people who have lost faith and who either incorrectly define atheism, are unwilling to accept the social stigma of atheism, or someone who is indeed in the sliver of middle ground trying to decide whether they should stick with their old belief or drop it (a precarious position at best).|`|1TYZDRUqaa	An Agnostic believes it is impossible to know weather or not a Deity exists, and an Atheist believes no Deity exists.|`|cNniG2L0aa	An atheist knows there are no invisible sky critters.

An agnostic essentially refuses to take an identifiable position, accepting that "ultimate knowledge is unattainable" on this subject.    However, I'd point out that in no other facet of life do we claim to need to have "ultimate knowledge" of something to conclude a probably determination.  We know enough about the Universe to disprove religious Gods, and the science does not support the God hypothesis of deism.

31a44d3fbbb802ac1df4fd2582bed746aa	Alot of times we put our faith in something expecting it to make it all better. Unfortunately we are never taught that we are responsible for our own actions. Undoubtedly there are times when bad things happen to good people. All I can tell you is yes everything happens for a reason. Your job is to look at the situation and learn from the lesson. My life was anything but great when I was younger. I attempted to take my own life twice and thought about it more then I care to remember. I am older now and although the hurt from the past is still there it did teach me to make stronger decisions and I can sit back and feel smug over the people who were involved with my hurt. I made it through and so will you, if you put your effort into fixing it yourself  instead of waiting for "GOD" to fix it. I know it's hard, sometimes unbearably so, but you are worth it and you will reap. Not only does everything happen for a reason but what goes around comes around. Trust me you will see.|`|nzdDdKtyaa	You are a child of God, and as a child you must be allowed to grow and develop.  Mankind lives in a world of sin, and thus bad things can and will happen. It is how we deal with these things that allows us to grow and develop both physically and spiritually.    Just because God does not bail you out of every bad situation does not mean that He does not love you.  It's like saying that you are a bad parent just because you don't hover over your kid waiting to pull them out of any bit of trouble.  Just as a few scraped knees help a child grow and mature in the long run, a few bad experiences help us to mature spiritually.    If you are a christian(which I assume)  then you need to realize that no matter what happens to you here on earth, it means nothing in the end; all that matters is how you deal with is and grow in serving God as well as developing a closer relationship with Him.|`|dPJr1Lbmaa	Your not.

Look at the life of David and Bathsheba.    What God did promise was that he would join you in the midst of the trials (ala Shadrach, Meschach, and Abednigo).

God may answer your prayer in ways you don't think He would. God loved Jesus Christ and had to see His Son die on the cross, he went through the pain of seeing His Son there dying to save us. He does love you, He is in pain along with you. Do not worry, if you stay faithful all will turn out well.

Me, I don't *believe* anything.  I follow the evidence.  If evidence shows something is probably true or correct, then I accept that it's probably true or correct.  If evidence (or lack of it) shows something is probably not true or correct, then I accept it's not true or correct.  No belief, period.

Ask them if they believe that the universe with all of its complexities and universal laws could have arisen by random chance.    If they say yes then tell them you want to conduct an experiment. You wanna throw a bunch of leaves up in the air a million times and before the millionth time coming down they will eventually form magically into a donkey.    The atheist will tell you that this is ludicrous and impossible and that he doesnt believe that it could ever happen. You will tell him that this is correct and that why this universe and all of its complext scientific-universal laws could not have been created by random chance or accident. Some grand force had to have had a hand in it.    He will then be forced by logic to admit that there is even a remote possibility that there is a god.

It is also defined more broadly as an absence of belief in deities, or non theism.    Many self-described atheists are skeptical of all supernatural beings and cite a lack of empirical evidence for the existence of deities. Others argue for atheism on philosophical, social or historical grounds. Although many self-described atheists tend toward secular philosophies such as humanism and naturalism, there is no one ideology or set of behaviors to which all atheists adhere; and some religions, such as Jainism and Buddhism, do not require belief in a personal god.    The term atheism originated as a pejorative epithet applied to any person or belief in conflict with established religion. With the spread of free thought, scientific skepticism, and criticism of religion, the term began to gather a more specific meaning and has been increasingly used as a self-description by atheists.|`|AA11521494	The entire point is that they believe there is no god.

Now, if you want to know what atheists believe in regards to morality, ethics, politics, etc., then you'd have to ask each one individually. Atheism does not carry with it any prescribed dogma, practices, standards, rituals, customs, morals or ethics. The only qualifying attribute is the lack of belief in any kind of god or deity.

You can't just "pick" a religion...hear about it and believe it.   You have to experience it, practice it, prepare for it.    If you are Catholic don't get confirmed yet because you know you're not ready to make a commitment.   I can tell you, I am Catholic. And I wear v-neck shirts, short skirts, I'll dance around in leotards. It doesn't mean I'm any less Catholic. People in ancient times hardly wore clothes, but they were all the same God's people. Clothes shouldn't be how you decide a faith.   You've gotta look at the fundamentals.    If you don't believe Jesus Christ is the Son of God, who if you were the only girl in the world, He would still die for your sins...  Then how will you believe in Mohammed, Buddha, etc. etc...  Faith is something that inspires you, moves you, makes you into a better person.    So look for it in your every day life, and make the decision when its right.   It's a forever thing.   I'll pray you go back to the Catholic faith, but if that isn't what you want...Then I just pray you make a choice that will make you a better person, a happy person, and a faithful person.  Good luck, and remember even in this time where u don't see much God, He IS there...|`|lmQYJEp4aa	By catholic, I assume that you mean 'church of Rome'.  Anyways, the best religion you should convert to is the one delivered to the church by the Apostles of Jesus Christ.  Why?  Because they, including Paul, were eyewitnesses and were commissioned by Christ to establish the message concerning him.  It is significant that nearly all of them, as well as many early Christians, suffered horrible deaths for holding fast the teaching that Jesus is the Son of God and that he was resurrected.  Would you die for a lie?  However, not only did the Apostles establish the message, first orally and then by writings, they committed the message and care of the churches to the early bishops.  The early bishops or church fathers claim to have preserved what the apostles taught without adding to or taking away from it.

You should not convert to a religion because of its rules (or lack of rules).  Do your research and try to determine what is true about God.  Then do your best to do what He wants you to do.  The primary purpose of a religion is to bring its followers closer to God.    There are many different denominations of Christianity (and Judaism), many of which have similar beliefs.  I recommend that you try attending different churches to see where you fit best.  Remember though that the best choice isn't the one that is easiest; it's the one that brings you closer to God.    Finally, you say that you don't believe Jesus is the son of God.  I am a Christian precisely because I am convinced that He is.  I would like to recommend the book "More Than a Carpenter" by Josh McDowell.  I too went through a long period where I had doubts, and this book changed my life.  McDowell lays out the facts in simple, easy to read language, and presents the evidence that what the Bible says about Jesus is accurate.    It is not a bad thing to have questions, but it is important to search for answers.  I hope you find them.|`|PiqSB4qyaa	Islam is a beautiful religion, it's very balanced and everything fits together perfectly, it doesn't contradict itself. Don't go by radical muslims or how the media protrays islam, they are not muslims in fact, and are using the religion. Really read a Quran that has explanations, it's amazing how everything flows so miraculously and makes so much sense. Just read it with an open mind. Muslims love all the Prophets, including Prophet Jesus, we just don't believe that he is the son of God.

As morals and ethics change - what do we still hold as true, or how do we re-interpret the scripture so that the words remain true.    And, at the same time, how do we behave, how do we treat others, how should we be in the world so that we are "righteous."    We are good, we are "written in the book of life" because of our deeds, not our beliefs.    Reform Judaism (its official name!) is a wonderful way to join a community, feed your spiritual needs, and learn how to think and live.  You aren't required to believe any particular belief, but you are asked to think, and to behave well, and to atone for wronging others.|`|Eo7KcX3Waa	Yes, go to a Pentecostal Church, you can get dressed any way you please and that is where you will see healing and miracles...but they do believe in Jesus, if you don't believe in Jesus, there is no reason to believe in anything else, because He went to the cross and died for your sins, so that your debt could be paid and you would have the right to be in heaven after you die...  And the bible says that the only way to God is through Jesus, there is no other way, everything else you try will be a god that you make up in your mind to fit your needs, but remember that god does not exist, then you might as well get a doll and play with it...it would just be the same...like an imaginary friend...|`|78b08f7b83f9b99a6c130bef60b55b7aaa	There are so many I have no specific allegiance to any one denomination myself I truly believe is one man, Jesus Christ, and his teachings and that through him we have a way into the next better life.

Good luck!|`|JXMpZiwxaa	I'd recommend praying the rosary:    http://www.ewtn.com/Devotionals/prayers/...    The fifteen promises of Mary to Christians who recite the rosary:  1. Whoever shall faithfully serve me by the recitation of the Rosary shall receive signal graces.  2. I promise my special protection and the greatest graces to all those who shall recite the Rosary.  3. The Rosary shall be a powerful armor against Hell, it will destroy vice, decrease sin, and defeat heresies.  4. It will cause virtue and good works to flourish; it will obtain for souls the abundant mercy of God; it will withdraw the hearts of men from the love of the world and its vanities and will lift them to the desire of eternal things. Oh, that souls would sanctify themselves by this means.  5. The soul which recommends itself to me by the recitation of the Rosary, shall not perish.  6. Whoever shall recite the Rosary devoutly, applying himself to the consideration of its sacred mysteries, shall never be conquered by misfortune. God will not chastise him in His justice, he shall not perish by an unprovided death; if he be just, he shall remain in the grace of God and become worthy of eternal life.  7. Whoever shall have a true devotion for the Rosary shall not die without the Sacraments of the Church.  8. Those who are faithful to recite the Rosary shall have during their life and at their death the light of God and the plenitude of His graces; at the moment of death, they shall participate in the merits of the saints in Paradise.  9. I shall deliver from Purgatory those who have been devoted to the Rosary.  10. The faithful children of the Rosary shall merit a high degree of glory in Heaven.  11. You shall obtain all you ask of me by the recitation of the Rosary.  12. All those who propagate the Holy Rosary shall be aided by me in their necessities.  13. I have obtained from my Divine Son that all the advocates of the Rosary shall have for intercessors the entire Celestial Court during their life and at the hour of death.  14. All who recite the Rosary are my sons, and brothers of my only Son, Jesus Christ.  15. Devotion to my Rosary is a great sign of predestination.    Our Lady has 117 titles. She selected this title at Fatima: "I am the Lady of the Rosary."    St. Francis de Sales said the greatest method of praying IS- Pray the Rosary.    St. Thomas Aquinas preached 40 straight days in Rome, Italy on just the Hail Mary.    St. John Vianney, patron of priests, was seldom seen without a rosary in his hand.    "The rosary is the scourge of the devil" -- Pope Adrian VI    "The rosary is a treasure of graces" -- Pope Paul V    Padre Pio, the stigmatic priest, said: "The Rosary is THE WEAPON"    Pope Leo XIII wrote 9 encyclicals on the rosary.    Pope John XXIII spoke 38 times about Our Lady and the Rosary. He prayed 15 decades daily.    St. Louis Marie Grignion de Montfort wrote: "The rosary is the most powerful weapon to touch the Heart of Jesus, Our Redeemer, who so loves His Mother."    Pope Pius XII: There is no surer means of calling down Gods blessings upon the familythan the daily recitation of the Rosary.    Pope Pius XII: The Rosary is the compendium of the entire Gospel.    God bless!  Dave|`|VsCrYYMeaa	If you do not believe that Jesus is the son of God anymore, then you are technically no longer a Christian.  There is therefore no point in converting to another Christian religion.  There are religions that do not recognize the divinity of Christ but claim to be Christian.  I think Jehova's Witness is one of them.      The other Abrahamic religions are Judaism and Islam.  Like in Christianity, there are different sects within this two religions.  I don't think all female followers of Judaism wear ankle length skirts and long sleeve shirts.  Maybe the members of the more conservative Jewish sects do.    But why the urgency to convert? I am Catholic and when I was younger, I doubted a lot of things about my faith.  I even doubted the existence of God.  Then I got interested in other religions like Islam, Buddhism and Hinduism.  I read up on the teachings of these religions and I found some of their doctrines interesting.  I also started reading up about Christianity and the history and practices of Catholicism.   As I matured I was drawn back to the Catholic Church and I have remained Catholic, stronger in my beliefs but respectful of other religions.       I do not question your decision to leave the Catholic Church, but I suggest that you take your time.  Read more about the history of the Catholic Church, its practices and doctrines. A lot of Catholics, even those who studied in Catholic schools, have very little knowledge of their faith.  Read also about other religions. And since you seem interested in Judaism, research what they really believe in.  And when you read about Catholicism, be aware that there are a lot of misinformation being spread by anti-Catholic groups.  There are also misinformation about Islam and perhaps also about Judaism.  So when reading about Catholic doctrines and practices or what Judaism or Islam teach, go to official sources.     Since you belong to a Catholic family and go to a Catholic school, talking to your priest or a guidance counselor is a good idea.  It will help you see other issues including those related to family relationship.      In the meantime, abstain from taking the sacraments until you resolve your issues.  And since you still believe in God pray and ask Him to lead you.|`|IwlE0oFbaa	When you say your reasons are valid for not believing Jesus is the son of God anymore, I would say just because I think something is true does not make it true.  God is true, but what I think is usually based on what someone else told me, or what I prayed about.  Those who pray believe in God and those who don't, are practical atheists.  If you live with your parents why not honor them and ask them about  your questions?  Or since your grandparents are into the Catholic faith, ask them as it sounds they might have some answers.    Talking to the priest or a good teacher may help you or not.  Some are better than others at answering questions.  Last January I was by Gulfport FL and met a couple excellent priests.  Two good resources for looking more into your faith are organizations founded by Catholic converts from other religions because they can tell you what is out there.  There are many former ministers at this website called the Coming Home Network      http://www.chnetwork.org/    And many questions on Catholics can be answered here as the convert Karl Keating founded this place and has studies many faiths.  His people have especially studied what the first Christians wrote in the first centuries of Christianity on the earliest teachings of the Apostles.    http://www.catholic.com/      Many people watch a movie like Da Vinci Code and believe what Dan Brown says are his researched facts, but Dan Brown is really  one of the biggest liars of all time.  Whatever Dan Brown said about Catholics in his book, is almost guaranteed not to be true cause I think he wrote that book to make people doubt Christianity and to promote his religion.|`|HLpNruweaa	Mandingoism|`|jYSS41T0aa	yes|`|3vBe3owiaa	we need a facepalm in here, pronto!|`|e11Z6QfJaa	no religion is best! not having a religion is better!|`|S9j2Jjqxaa	Islam - it's the religion of peace|`|ZaVPaDGhaa	there is no god, get over it|`|ovSX3H0Baa	Religion is a terrible thing it could kill a man honestly    Religion is a set of codes and customs you have to live up to in order to be part of a faith.

He would be able to end his life and his life is his own, but when his life and death affect the lives of others then it is controversial whether he still posses that right anymore.

I suggest that you read a legitimate book on Egyptian mythology rather than whatever it is that you've been reading so you will actually know your facts and not misinform other posters in the future. God Bless!  +?+    Continued :  I am employed at a Federal Prison. I minister and council inmates daily. Many of them are pagan. So it is my job not just to know the Bible, but also the beliefs of other religions as well. Many of the inmates I work with choose to use the Egyptian Pantheon in their worship. So my sources  do not come only from my education or some book that I may have read, but they are also derived from actual daily participation.|`|G3vJ5eflaa	Here is why I believe in God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit-  Read Genesis 1:26-27. Here God creates man in His own Image- whose? Gods' own image. Male and female He created them. Just male or just female? No, male and female so that there could be reproduction.    Now go back to Gen 1:1 and follow through all 6 days of creation. Be very careful to read the way in which everything was created. Oh, BTW, in Hebrew the first time the word creation is used, the word means that everything was created from nothing. The next time creation is used, the Hebrew word means created from what was then present.     Everything that was created was created in such a fashion that everything that came after could live. Finally,, on the second half of the 6th day, man was created. Not only was he created but was created in the image of God. WOW!!! There may be similarities with other religions, but NO other religion man man the centerpiece of creation. That everything else was created so that man may live, flourish, and worship God his Father and Creator.     NO OTHER RELIGION makes man the focal point! Not only the focal point but that we were made to worship God.    I am excited and in awestruck wonder that God considered me so special that He made me in His image. Not likeness, but image- that means taking an original and pressing it into clay and then pressing more clay on the back and removing the model. You now have a fulle likeness of the original and that IS what I am- a likeness of God my Maker.|`|evStsOQiaa	Jesus wants to thank you for being so interested in Him.

Not to mention the fact that they don't mention kiddie fiddling, rape or slavery as being wrong.  Not the most moral set of rules to live your life by then, eh?    The first 4(3) commandments deal with God and Sabbath, we can scrap those as not obeying those has no impact on morality.    4(or 5 if non-Catholic)=Honour thy father and mother.  Some parents are terrible and deserve no respect.  See kiddie fiddling above.    5(or 6 if non-Catholic)=killing (or murdering).  Well, that is justified in a just and righteous war, can anyone say stopping Hitler was a bad thing even though it was at great human cost across the globe?    How do you get past 5 rules before you get to one that says killing other people is wrong?    6(7)=No adultery.  Why?  If no-one finds out then it's not a problem.  If anyone does find out it's a civil matter and that's that.  never mind the fact that a person taking part in an adulterous relationship who isn't married is doing nothing wrong.    7(8)=No stealing.  If you and your family are starving and you steal bread from a supermarket that's not morally wrong.    8(9)=Lying.  We lie all the time - "does my *** look big in this?"  what do you answer?    9+10=Coveting.  Capitalism dies on the day we stop coveting what other people have.  Look at the Amish, they live a simple and happy life, but they do not drive technology or productivity.    So the commandments are bull.    Our conscience comes from our empathy for other people, our own set of morals that are not aligned (but may be related to) religion and our sense of fairness that all higher primates have.  We have more of it and a better understanding of it, but other animals also have it.|`|SoY4IiYBaa	sucks for him...    our conscience comes from inside our brains...|`|6TuyXuJRaa	It is the holy spirit.

For example: not having a lover regardless of gender.  It's human nature to love and be loved.  God (assuming there is one) didn't specify who/whom should be a companion/mate only religion took that on.  Hence we have guilt.  Additionally, men and women are not designed to be monogamous...yet another religious bunch of junk.|`|ZunJKYVDaa	God created us, including our conscience shouldnt that be enough proof for you? and the ten commandments arent like totally religious things to do almost all of them just make you generally a decent person so maybe this dude just realized hes kinda a loser and he should change his ways|`|FsX5VoXKaa	Im amazed that no one had made any reference to the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil as the origin of Sin.    The first time the word ashamed appeared, was in the garden of Eden. Before Adam disobeyed God and ate from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, he had no consciousness of what was Right and What was Wrong. He only knew what was God. Was it wrong to eat from a tree? No. God gave him EVERY tree to eat from. Just as a sign of respect, do not touch that ONE tree.  Isnt it amazing how the devil can point you to the one thing you cannot have even though you own everything else?       What is as bad as knowing evil, is knowing good. Why? Because there is none good but God.    Luke 18:19 " Why callest thou me good? There is none good but God."      God is holy, therefore He cannot grade along a curve. There is no "i'm pretty good..  nothing major.."  nope.. Good = not even a single speck..    Anything else is evil...  Evil doesnt always mean harmful to others, but rather, if its not God's will, it is evil.     It is evil to fall sick. It is evil to be depressed. All these things are evil becasue it is not God's will for those things to happen to you.Thats why He sent Jesus to redeem us. I love my God because I know, if I fall sick, Jehovah Rapha, God IS HEALING.  If I am poor, Jehovah Jireh, God is my provider!   A very present help!  Hallelujah!     Bottom Line is this..  Our guilty conscience came from the Tree of knowing Good and Evil, but fear not! Jesus came and reversed that all on the Tree( Galations 3:13) and then took us with Him, to the Right Tree that we were meant to be all along.. the Tree of Life!     Have i helped any? haha|`|b0AvMRqbaa	The conscience is developed in an individual by the nurturing received from parents, family and society. It is easy for religion to make a person think they have sinned, when they have not. Religion intensifies any self doubt the person's environment imposed on them from childhood.|`|ctOge9SLaa	Praise the Lord for that testimony. Thank You Lord for this one's turn to you, that he was obedient to the speaking of his conscience and in doing so, found YOU! Bless and strengthen him wherever he is, that he will grow in grace daily as he continues to seek you with a pure heart.    Our conscience is such an amazing part of us.  It is the leading part of our spirit and is God's way of directly letting us know what He approves of and disapproves of.    Even though man's spirit became deadened because of the fall, this part of man's spirit still functioned and from our conscience God is able to speak to us concerning sin in our lives and our condition.    This brother's testimony is so encouraging because many a time, the conscience is not cared for and it becomes numb and dull and seared with a hot iron, losing its sensitivity.    How we have to praise the Lord for our conscience.  When our conscience bothers us regarding sin, it is with the intention that we will have a turn to Christ who is the Only one who can fix the problem of a guilty or nagging conscience.  Only the blood of the Lord Jesus, through our confession of our sins, can spirinkle us of a guilty and evil conscience.    Heb 10:22  Let us come forward to the Holy of Holies, with a true heart in full assurance, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water."    This is the kind of heart God has toward us. He has made a clear way for us all to be freed from a condemning conscience.  Only the Lord's blood is qualified to answer to God on our behalf.     Heb 12:24  And to Jesus, the Mediator of a new covenant, and to the blood sprinkled, which speaks better than that of Abel.    Abel's blood spoke for accusation and vengence to God against Cain for the murder (Gen 4:10-15), but Praise the Lord, Christ's blood speaks of better things, His blood speaks to God for our forgiveness, justification, reconcililation, and redemption.  His blood also shuts up the accusing mouth of the devil. Once we are under the perfect redeeming blood of Christ, satan has no more grounds to accuse us before God.  Our conscience is at rest and we can continue to have fellowship with the Lord.    The main purpose of our conscience is to bring matters to our attention that offend and cut off our fellowship with God.  Its not just there to nag us, but to guide us to take the Blood as our cleansing and covering so that we can get back to whats important to God... FELLOWSHIP.    1 John 1:7  If we walk in the Light as He is in the Light, we have fellowship with one another and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin"    This fellowship is vertical, between us and God and also horizontal, between us and others.    May we take care of this part of our being. Not letting it become dull and smeared and lose its sensitivity.  May we always avail ourselves to the Lord's blood as our only provision.  We are not perfect, but we are indeed under the Perfect Blood of the Lord.    Thank you for this awesome post sister  In Christ  sandy|`|kdo6qnS9aa	God's Holy Spirit constantly convicts us of the sins we commit.

gASz3hDWaa	My german spiritual brothers and sisters refuse to serve Hitler or give any obedience to him. Not just individuals but the whole organization.  The Nazis put german citizens to the concentration camps who were not Jew but Jehovah's Witnesses. Because we would remain not against Hitler but neutral to any human government. In Britain and the world over Jehovah's Witnesses remained out from participating in the war, even being imprisoned for it.    We truly remained "no part of the world"    The SS guards offered Jehovah's Witnesses in the camps freedom to leave the camps if they renounced their faith by signing a paper. Barely a soul did. In fact more people came out of those camps with the faith than went in. Even some SS soldiers amazed of the godly conduct of their peaceable prisoners and the staunch clinging to their faith even under the most brutal treatment even death.|`|AA10181489	I am not Christian, but the Pope threatened to bring all Catholics off the battlefield for both sides during WWI.  This resulted only in persecution and arrest of Catholics and eliminated the papacy from peace negotiations.  Such things had been tried before and only made things worse.  If you go on the offensive you force the other side on the defense and you only get war.  Not a very Jesus like thing to do, so the Church has tried over the centuries to influence bad leaders by interacting if at all possible.  If you read Mein Kampf the Catholic Church was one of the few fears Hitler had.  He felt Protestants would be easy to get to go along and mostly he was right.  The exception, Jehovah's Witnesses, were the only Protestant group to hold firm against him as a collective whole, although specific local groups were oppositional.  The Witnesses will not pledge allegiance to any flag, so he had them all killed.  He was successful in going around the Catholic Church because he spent great effort in developing a strategy to neutralize them early.    Catholics were a mixed group, some tremendous opposition and some easily rolled over or supported him.    While you point out that Hitler was never excommunicated, it is Church teaching that he had self-excommunicated, so no public excommunication would have been necessary or even thought about.  They don't excommunicate murderers, for example, or bank robbers.  Likewise, Hitler was not only raised Catholic, he was also likely of Jewish descent.  Although it was never shown for sure one way or the other during his life, Hitler had his fathers home town shelled to the ground when he attacked Austria so any evidence was burned with the town.    The Vatican did know of concentration camps as did the Americans who turned away ocean liners filled with refugees which were returned by the Americans to Germany who executed them.  The Vatican did in fact help Jewish refugees escape, but also clearly did far too little.  The pope of the time was probably the worst possible person for the job.  He didn't mind doing things in secret, but he rather foolishly seemed to believe that the Nazis could be dealt with like reasonable people through diplomatic means.    The Church also believes in martyrs.  It lived its first three hundred years as a martyred church.  Since God takes martyrs to Heaven, it tends to be less concerned with physical life than eternal life.    Truthfully, the Catholic Church was one of the better opponents of Hitler.  I know a Holocaust survivor who lived in a convent shielded by the nuns.    Finally, the pope does not have the authority to make those types of moral choices for individuals.  Freedom to be holy is also the freedom to sin.  The Papacy should clearly have done more and stood up more to Hitler, but the Pope of the time was not someone who really had a grasp of who or what Hitler was.    I am an atheist, but you don't understand Catholicism or history.  If you want to attack Catholicism, it is better to attack them for the silly idea that Jesus was a God, but they did better than most in the Holocaust.  That is tragic of course because that says how terrible almost all groups did, the Witnesses excepted of course.|`|c73cac86901ee77d1060c607b55ea156aa	Hitler hated the Church and persecuted Catholics.

Other quotes from the New York Times:  http://www.catholicleague.org/pius/piusn...|`|mfSp38yzaa	Though not nearly to the extent that Jews and Gypsies were persecuted, Catholics were hated by Hitler as well. Catholic newspapers were banned, monasteries and churches were forced to close, and many Catholics died.    It took years before the world realized what Hitler was really up to. When the Church saw what was happening, it finally did speak out. Even Albert Einstein said this of the Church:    "Being a lover of freedom, when the revolution came in Germany, I looked to the universities to defend it, knowing that they had always boasted of their devotion to the cause of truth; but, no, the universities immediately were silenced. Then I looked to the great editors of the newspapers whose flaming editorials in days gone by had proclaimed their love of freedom; but they, like the universities, were silenced in a few short weeks...Only the Church stood squarely across the path of Hitler's campaign for suppressing truth. I never had any special interest in the Church before, but now I feel a great affection and admiration because the Church alone has had the courage and persistence to stand for intellectual truth and moral freedom. I am forced thus to confess that what I once despised I now praise unreservedly."    EDIT: You say that like he was a faithful Catholic. Looking past the heinous acts he committed for a moment, he did grow up Catholic, and even attended a Catholic university I believe. But as an adult, he did not practice his Catholic faith. As a matter of fact, he got into a Protestant movement within Germany for a time. So tell me this, should we condemn the religion people grow up in, even if they no longer espouse it as their Faith if someday in the future (while not practicing that Faith) they end up as bad people? Given than so many people to not stay with the Faith they were given as a child, this could make for a messy situation.|`|7bd794308643a48ae46003172864a1f5aa	Because the Nazis were acting in accordance with Christian tradition.

I'd guess the simplest explanation is that the Roman Catholic Church (RCC) - in general - no longer interferes with political matters, and this was true at the time of WWII.    More:  the RCC had an "accord" with Hitler in his early days as chancellor, but that accord was violated later by Hitler.  So, since Hitler did not have a consistent policy with regard to the RCC, it's hard to demand that the RCC have a consistent policy with regard to Hitler.    I find this interesting: (look at the italic text in the 4th paragraph - a quote by Einstein)  http://users.binary.net/polycarp/piusxii...    and this  http://catholiceducation.org/articles/ap...    How - or IF - the RCC officially opposed later Nazi policies is still a question.  The archives of that pope's "reign" were opened to Vatican historians a couple of years ago, and we will probably see definitive (that is, verified) histories of that pope's official position with regard to the Nazis within the decade.

No one saw it as bad until after the war.    In truth, there is absolutely nothing wrong with national socialism in itself.  Its just the killing and concentration camp part that is wrong.     Its like the Pope trying to tell Catholics not to be a republican.    Not to mention the Nazis were against Communist who did not believe in God.   Fascism and Nazism did.

The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead.

The best thing you can do to keep your bond is keep praying and go to church and if you haven't already done this get saved. God is telling you he loves you. And do good where ever you go. That feeling you have is God telling you to believe in him and he is letting you know he loves you and he hears your prayer. And he is letting you know your ready to become a good christian. God just washed your sins away when you started to cry. So see God is real and God loves us all. Just don't stop believing in him and you will do alright. And also go to church and testify on what just happened to you right there. Tell the preacher what you experienced, cause chances are he will pray over you and you will get to feel that feeling even more.|`|27vAxPSnaa	You seem to be open to God and searching.

Evolution does not say there is no god, nor does it try to prove that there is no god. Evolution is a proven fact that should the development of all life on earth. You obviously have no idea what Darwin is talking about because you have used the term "evolutionist", if we are evolutionists... we are also gravitationists or oxygenists.    You obviously have no idea because your thick skull cannot give a reason why Darwin's theory is false. "The devil" is not a reason... there is no such thing. We evolved, why and how can you not accept that?.. Please respond with suitable evidence.|`|1f2movZZaa	No, I do not agree. I think you are being eccentric, defensive, and illogical, though. If we can, over the years, domesticate wolves, breed them to have specific characteristics, and after hundreds of years end up with things like miniature poodles, great danes, beagles, etc... why is it so hard to believe that it happens in nature as well?    Take a population of creatures, we will call them giraffes... and put them in an environment where the only food they can get is from trees. Those with longer necks will eat, live, and have offspring. The ones with short necks will die, and can't pass along their genes. After awhile, the only ones left have long necks, because they were most adapted to survive their environment.    But, animals and humans tend to mate with the most attractive possible mate. I know people don't go around looking for the ugliest, as shallow as that sounds. They look for someone healthy, and beautiful. If you have a population of birds, and they are attracted to colorful feathers in a mate, all of the most colorful birds will find mates, and the dullest ones will die without having offspring. Out of the offspring of that generation, those with the most colorful feathers will find mates, and the dullest ones will not have offspring. Eventually, all the birds in that area will be very, very colorful.    It's the reason why we are on average a foot or more taller than humans in the middle ages. :)    Oh, and you know, Darwin never said we were descended from apes. He said we had a common ancestor. From that one race of animal came multiple branches of primates and humans. Why is it that you think from just two people (Adam and Eve) we can get such a diverse world of people, who look very different form one another, and yet you can't accept that we evolve, too?|`|cf84769c39c0ba4a53a95535563ec1e3aa	Since I don't ascribe to any belief in the Devil I can't believe that anyone would be under his/her/it's influence.

To suggest that just about every scientist in the world who studies these subjects is under the influence of Satan and falsifying the evidence is too silly for words.    As the judge said after the trial six-week trial there was overwhelming evidence establishing that intelligent design is a religious view, a mere re-labeling of creationism, and not a scientific theory.    Is this the last desperate attempt by the fundamentalist christian church who can no longer dispute the facts so they have to resort to suggesting some overpowering evil figure has control over the scientists and those of us who dare to believe facts.

bRAmXcowaa	have lived South Africa? Are you South African?......if not then you have no right to make such ridiculous comments    South Africa is in desperated poverty, alot of the population cannot read or write, most do not have acess to clean running water and live in shanti towns. There are not nearly enough jobs and education is expensive.    Corruption is rife in all of South Africa, from goverment to police, and often desperate people in poverty are used as henchmen and assistants, with the promiss of nothing more that electricitry connected to their camp site.  These people are unable to provide for their children and would do almost anything to keep food and water in the camp, or even for the chance of a job.    The educated, employed minority can see what is goin on and often vote against the dictaorship style politicians.   That leaves over 70% of the population, who are either corupt and being paid off by political factions, or the desperatly impoverished who only know what they are told (usually by the henchmen of the   dictators) and have golden carrots dangled in front of them.    I suggest you investigate your topic as making comments such as yours are highly offensive and unfounded

I don't have the french accents on my keyboard but there's a ` on the u in ou .. but only for the word "where" .. without an accent that would indicate the word for "or"    Some examples for clarification:    Je ne sais pas ou (with an accent on the U) sont mes clefs.

If it doesn't, you can find a more liberal branch that does.  Even the most anti-gay religions that people can think of have "gay" counterparts.    Instead of focusing on whether they accept your sexuality, try finding out if you can believe their beliefs.  Go on your own for a while and figure out what you believe and then find a religion that matches those beliefs.  Sexuality should not define who you are, or what religion you choose.

This is why Christians are thought to be small-minded, judgmental, Bible banging jerks. While it is true that Christians believe that Christ is the only way to get to heaven, the truth is that (sadly) many (if not most) Muslims are more devoted than the average Christian.     So for one thing, it takes a lot more than reading the Bible to convert a Muslim to Christianity.     Secondly, I don't think that any Christian should speak this way about anyone else, regardless of their religious background. Otherwise, how are supposed to win people over through love?     I think that, though I believe that Muslims are mistaken and will not go to heaven, they are included in love your neighbor, love your enemies, etc.    This was not an appropriate way for this "pastor" to be speaking, and I just hope that you will not allow this to bias your opinion of Christians as a group. Hope this helps.|`|Z5KvRSRCaa	It certainly doesn't represent me.|`|5KSumfw6aa	thats a bit to EXTREME for a pastor...|`|88f525847b73501f8d60644421168159aa	He's not in harmony with the idea of Christianity.  odd|`|Po2UqfvWaa	you can call yourself anything you want, doesn't make it so.|`|JGSHTVBQaa	Maybe|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	My god it's like you've known me all these years!|`|1vZ1n0agaa	wow, not at all. did you honestly expect a true christian to answer in the positive?    no it is not appropriate for a christian pastor. although jesus said that there is only one way to heaven he also said to respect people of other religions and that is NOT what that pastor did. he is just tossing a regular old insult at a religion with millions of followers and it's not even remotely true.     jesus christ!    edit: there's a difference between asking if this is appropriate for a pastor to say and asking if he has the right. everyone has the right to say anything in america except 'i want to kill the president' but a lot of what people say is hardly 'appropriate'|`|6TuyXuJRaa	Not only is it inappropriate, he seems to know nothing about the Bible, true Christianity, Islam or the Koran.

I don't believe what the Karan is teaching  I don't believe in socialism and I don't believe in Liberalism either....I also Believe Jesus is the way and the path and pointing fingers at people and belonging to a church will not get you into heaven.

But you may think that he is being mean to musslims but remeber, in america, we do have the freedom of speech.|`|o6BnI70Daa	Well, its only true if that person knows this from a personal point of view.

But a Christian would not openly bash another person or group like that.  Jesus loved everyone, even those who were lost.|`|58THMcy5aa	Ummm if you can't respect others religion you have no right to say its wrong or your religion is better then their. I am a sikh and sikh people had so many fights with muslims but I don't hate on People cuz they are Muslims, I don't care what religion they are, what really matters is what kind of person they are, their attitude and that has nothing to do with their religion. Who ever wrote that is not a christian, he is just a person with Ego and arrogance in them. The Quran is on its own place and the Bible is on its own place. Thats just a stupid and Useless statement.|`|s2xXo1Ojaa	Its a very poor representation of himself. My first impression is that hes uneducated and trying to shock for attention. Whats the source?  Even if he's none of these things his point is lost in a poor choice of words.  I don't preach for numerous reasons, but namely I'm uneducated.|`|erKAzxG9aa	I don't see anything wrong with the statement as long as the Koran WAS written by a pedophile.  I don't know anything about that abominable book, so I can't know for sure.  But as long as that holds true, then sure, I think it's perfectly appropriate.    See, what you need to understand, is that pastors, nor any other Christian, has to be "politically correct".  That is a world view, and a worldly saying. And we Christians are supposed to be separate from this world.  We should all call it like we see it.  If you are not for Christ and His salvation, then you are against it.  If you are against it and remain against it, then you have your ticket to everlasting hell and torment.  Plain truth--that's all it is.  There is no gray area here; only darkness and light; truth and lies.
QE77Oxtqaa	What happens when we die? This is a question no one can answer, given that no one has been to death and back to tell us the truth. Christians believe that the good go to Heaven while the sinners go toHell, and Buddhists and Hindus believe we are reincarnated until we reach nirvana. What do Wiccans believe? Well, as the Wiccan religion isn't exactly an organized religion, it depends on who you ask.    Most Wiccans believe in the Summerland, which is a paradise much like the Christian heaven. All people, except spirits who remain behind lost and wandering, go to the Summerland, even the wicked. The Summerland will be different for everyone, their own version of Shangri-La. There, they can be reunited with their loved ones, look over those they left behind on Earth, and take time to recuperate from life. Our time in the Summerland is spent processing what we learned, recovering from the hardships, walking with the Lord and Lady and being one with them, and then planning our next life.    Most Wiccans agree that when you are ready, you are reincarnated. You may choose what form you take and even a little about your situation. You decide this based upon which lessons you wish to learn in your next life. Someone who was very selfish and arrogant may choose a life of humility to humble himself, for example. People even choose lives of hardship in order to learn their lessons, although they don't get to plan specifically what the circumstances will be.    Wiccans do not believe in Hell or in an eternity of punishment for one life-time of sin. Some, however, do believe that you may be punished for the harm you do. I believe that you may kept from reincarnating, if you are not yet ready, or reincarnated into an undesirable life as a means of punishment. There are other Wiccans who believe this, as well as Wiccans who don't. Like Buddhists, I and some other Wiccans believe the point of living is to learn and to perfect your soul, until you reach an enlightened existence.|`|kksq9BtOaa	I believe it featured in spyro the dragon 3: year of the dragon.

Most Christians believe that the water would have submerged all of the world..because that is what the Bible says.....not just parts of it. It is man's scientific theory that perhaps the part of the world that was flooded was where the people lived who eventually wrote the Bible. Nothing conclusive. To my knowledge, there is no proof that Noah's Ark has ever been found. Again, some theories based on findings of ancient wood on the side of what is now a mountain suggests this, but again it has not been proven that it was associated in any way with Noah.

People have "thought" they found it in multiple locations...|`|TinNG7k7aa	Religious people are so quick to believe anything the religious authority in their life tells them.    The problem.....it's all truth-by-assumption. Not very accurate and open to doubt. REAL truth has no loopholes.    So can you please provide links and proof of such "research"?    The dead sea scrolls proved nothing. They were old writings which only specialists could decipher.    Flood? Don't floods still occur today too? Hurricane Katrina victims know too well the damage.    Ice age happened too, why isn't that in the bible?    Why aren't Woolly Mammoths in the bible? They existed as well. People have found the fossils, even preserved specimens, in the permafrost.     Ever been to a museum? Why aren't dinosaurs in the bible? They left their bones behind. Why aren't they in the bible?    How could anyone have written Genesis? By it's own account, nobody was alive. Yet apparently it was experienced and witnessed, and written. Very contradictory and full of loopholes.    Noah's ark? They found some wood up on a mountain, but nobody can positively say what it is. There's no sign on it or words stating what it is. It just happens to fit an old story so religious people blindly assume it's truly what they read about.|`|7mhRDbvsaa	just to piss off a bible fan|`|4c979acd3ee945a6e63181337a60c6e7aa	So if Muslims say the same about the Koran why do Christians challege that book?|`|NaM4ZT64aa	This, kids, is why we stay in school.|`|kyFwz7kYaa	Because they are perfectionists and they have to have an explanation for everything, but they need to know that God doesn't have to have an explanation.|`|brX80VS0aa	It's fun to point out just how wrong it is.|`|YOWnMp0Xaa	Actually, maybe YOU should explain how researchers found Noah's ark because I missed bit of news that in the Oxford Journal of Archaeology.|`|BYTrrqN6aa	People should challenge and question everything.

You should look into it before you yourself believe in EVERYTHING that is written in the bible. The bible was written by men, yes... and there were also parts that were not deemed "worthy" of going on there... by men again.   There HAVE been parts of the world that have been submerged under water, yes, but NO ONE has discovered Noah's Ark.. now think about this, his ark would be over 2000 years old, it was made out of wood, it would have rotted by now... what ever you watched.. watch it again, they said it COULD be his ark..not it IS.|`|PClzVRSEaa	There is no proof that it's Noah's ark, number one.  The scrolls just mean that someone wrote it down, not that it's true, number two.  And you yourself just said "parts of the world" flooded...that does not prove a worldwide flood, that just means that there were regional floods, same as there are today.    Gone With the Wind was a book written down too.  And it had facts in it, like the burming of Atlanta...but that doesn't mean that Tara really existed or there was a really a woman named Scarlett.|`|T8X7mrtHaa	People don't challenge the bible because they "don't want to believe what's in it".      Intelligent, logical people do not base thier beliefs on what they 'want to believe'.  They base their beliefs on experience, thought, and logic.    Most people would LOVE to believe that a super-nice, all-powerful sky-daddy is protecting them and promises to give them eternal bliss in heaven.  That sounds delightful to me!  It's just illogical and unrealistic as well.    So people challenge what the bible says because there is no good reason to accept it as being the 'Word of God' or any such nonsense.    The 'facts' and 'evidence' you mention do nothing but show you have a LOOOOONG way to go before you have put as much thought and research into this question as some of us have.|`|UGPiSvhraa	Because they really don't believe or do not want to believe.|`|a5ef125f73c7e0507eb991485e86abc2aa	They challenge the Bible because they don't want to believe what is in it.

We have facts too.|`|gQeesoTPaa	You answered your own question. The Bible was written by men, and has been prove to be false in many ways. For example, science has proven that the earth is very very old. Not just a few thousand years like the bible would have you believe. Do you believe in dinosaurs? If you do, then you are going directly against the Bible.    And science has completely explained how different parts of the world have been covered in water.     Read a little more. Do your research before just trusting one source like the Bible.|`|oN519wDmaa	Its Because So many Christians believe the Bible is infaulable and Atheist are just pointing out that it is not     There are many inconsistencies contained in the The bible ,,and Because it was written By Man It is not 100% accurate Its more like 40% ,,But still that is good compared to other historical Documents     And I personally think its a good thing that Atheist do point out the Contradictions ,,,As that promotes Believers to do their research and find other sources of information    The best way to prove something is to try and disprove it     Plus it build our faith|`|vDPn7CaUaa	No one can explain how they discovered Noah's ark, because it never happened. And the Dead Sea scrolls still do not prove anything. Sure they give a little more back story, but anyone can write a story or create a scroll. I believe the people in the bible may have existed, but the story of Jesus being magic is not. As for the flood, they found possible evidence of a flood in many areas, but they can hardly say conclusively that it was the great flood. There have been many floods, volcano eruptions, and earth quakes in years past.|`|BBDdyYgZaa	There was no global flood. Regions flood at times, but there simply isn't enough water on Earth to completely cover the entire globe. The Noah's Ark story is impossible for numerous reasons (I can list them, but they should be obvious to everyone over the age of 10). Nearly every region that tended to have floods in early recorded history also had a great flood myth.    Researchers have not discovered Noah's Ark.|`|CWjlEp6Zaa	They believe that if something cannot be proven by physical means, it is false. But the thing is, Science actually proves that God exists!    First thing is first. God does not exist in a physical realm, therefore he does not have to abide by physical laws, specificly, Time. Time has only existed since the beginning of this physical realm. Wether it be 13.7 billion years or 10,000 years (I chose the latter, but thats just my faith). Now were going to use the Big Bang Theory model for this. They said that the universe began in a explosion casued by all the mass in the universe in the area of a needle point. But what came before this? Another law of physics is that something cannot come out of nothing. Which means, this theory is fundementally flawed because something had to create all of that mass, out of nothing. Which means, something which does not have to abide by our universes rules had to made that. And that thing is God, because he has existed before the Big Bang, due to the fact that he does not have to abide by the laws of our universe, becasue he does not exist in this universe, and he exists outside of Time, becsaue time is a law of this universe.    But in the end, it all comes down to faith, but I think what I stated above gives some pretty good evidence.|`|oxc0VSAOaa	The Dead Sea scrolls did not prove that the Bible was factual (it just proved one event in the bible was factual)    The Earth was not submerged in a great flood.(just parts of the middle east)    No one has ever found Noah's Ark.

I challenge all of you to actually learn about your religion The History of it Read the actual book from cover to cover and not let some guy in a dress and silly hat tell you what it Really Means.

That the whole common perception of what Hell is based on nothing more then a Fiction Writers account of the Fiery Pits of the 9 levels of hell in 1320 AD?    Dantes Devine Comedies?    Before Dante wrote his series of books on what hell is There was no biblically approved description of what hell would be like and what the punishments would be?    Did you know that there are really 8 Deadly Sins? That the list was changed 200+ years after it was written?     That the original 8 are nothing like the Official 7? That the sins are not in the bible At all    The Original 8 were written by a Christian monk from Constantinople who traveled to Egypt to live alone in a cave and wrote up his list of thoughts that most tormented him in 375 AD? That the list was to be followed by Monks ONLY? That no one paid him any heed until over 200 years later?    The actual, original list of Thoughts consisted of:  Pride  Gluttony  Lust  Sloth  Greed  Anger  Vain Glory  Sadness    Yeah Sadness So all of us diagnosed with Depression are really just being lead astray by the devil Yeah    The idea that Lust is bad wasnt even considered until the 4th Century Bishop Epithanious decided to denounce the Gnostic Cult known as Carpocrations (Pronounced Car-Po-Crate-shions) in 325 ad? They used ALL 60+ books of the Christian Bible as their guide and it is said in the Book of Mary that Jesus said that there is no such thing as sin     The Bishop wanted to gain a foothold of power in the area so he described the Gnostic Cult as starting their worship by disrobing and that the worship ended with a sex act between priest and priestess and ordered that all Gnostic books be burned and that the cult be banned?     It wasnt until 200+ years later, after the fall of the Roman Empire, when the dark ages took hold in 590 AD and the Official church wanted iron fisted control over Official Christianity that the list was written by the Reformer Pope Gregory The Great?     (Who also decided that Holy Men could not marry Not because Chastity was good but because he didnt want a priests family to be able to inherit Church Property and to consolidate the Churchs base of power? Before it was decided that priests couldnt merry They had wives and kids and could have sex)    Though found no where in the bible This guy wrote them up and published them and they became part of the Christian Doctrine.     The Official 7 Sins written by the Reformer Pope Gregory The Great:  Lust  Envy  Gluttony   Sloth   Greed   Anger   Pride    Did you also know that just THINKING about these sins means that you have actually committed the act? And that by committing the act, you are sentenced to hell?     Do you even know what the Seven Heavenly Virtues are? What they stand for?  Chastity  Liberality  Kindness  Patience  Humility  Abstinence  Diligence    Does ANYONE that believes this stuff actually do their research and understand their own deluded belief structure?    http://www.nobeliefs.com/DarkBible/darkb...  The salvation doctrines of Christianity survived and flourished because they afforded the priesthood considerable power. The priests alone held the keys to salvation and could threaten the unbelievers with eternal punishment. Hence, in the evolution of Christianity in the last two thousand years with priests preying on human fears, the religion has demonstrated extraordinary powers of survival. Even without the priests, the various versions of the Bible have had more influence on the history of the world, in the minds of men than any other literature.    Unfortunately, the beliefs in Scripture produced the most violent actions against man in the history of humanity up to that time. The burning of competing Christian cults (called heretics) by early Christian churches acted as the seeds of violent atrocities against man. There later followed the destruction of Rome by the Christian Goths, and the secret pagan sacrifices consented by the Pope, the Vandals that had the Bible with them as they destroyed imperial North Africa, the crusades in the eleventh century fighting in the lands around the eastern Mediterranean, Palestine and Syria, capturing Jerusalem and setting kingdoms from Anatolia to the Egyptian border. In 1204 the Fourth Crusade plundered Constantinople the most holy city at that time, with Christians fighting Christians.

Human civilization requires large amounts of fresh water. This is found mainly in rivers. Rivers flood. Floods happen all over the place. There is, however, no geologic evidence for a single global flood.    Noah's Ark? Don't make me laugh. Despite numerous expeditions, no one has brought back any evidence that there is a boat on a mountaintop in Eastern Turkey. A few photos of a rock formation that looks like a prow in certain lighting, but nothing else.

Unless you believe somebody can know God's position on this matter, the question is pointless.    If you believe somebody can know the mind of God, how exactly would that happen?

The Catholic Church has the highest regard for human life and human dignity from the beginning of life at conception until natural death.    Human cloning, that is the creation of a human embryo through scientific means, does injury to the dignity of humanity. Will these children be brought up in loving families or treated as laboratory experiments or sources for spare parts?    Will these children be treated as required in Article 7.1, Convention on the Rights of the Child, United Nations General Assembly, 1989: The child shall be registered immediately after birth and shall have the right from birth to a name, the right to acquire a nationality and. as far as possible, the right to know and be cared for by his or her parents.  http://html.knowyourrights2008.org/media...    Every human being is entitled to human rights including cloned human embryos. If created, they should be treated with the same rights and respect of any other human being as a child of God.    The Catholic Church is not just against cloning, it is pro-life in the widest sense. This is often called a "Consistent Ethic of Life."    This pro-life stance stresses the highest regard for dignity of human life including that of:  - All people in objecting to unjust war and nuclear arms.  - The unborn in objecting to to abortion, in fitro fertilization, frozen embryos, embryonic stem cell research, and cloning  - The elderly, sick and dying in objecting to assisted suicide and euthanazia  - Prisoners in objecting to the death penalty  - The poor and minorities in supporting social justice issues.

The complexity of our planet points to a deliberate Designer who not only created our universe, but sustains it today.    Many examples showing God's design could be given, possibly with no end. But here are a few:    The Earth...its size is perfect. The Earth's size and corresponding gravity holds a thin layer of mostly nitrogen and oxygen gases, only extending about 50 miles above the Earth's surface. If Earth were smaller, an atmosphere would be impossible, like the planet Mercury. If Earth were larger, its atmosphere would contain free hydrogen, like Jupiter.3 Earth is the only known planet equipped with an atmosphere of the right mixture of gases to sustain plant, animal and human life.    The Earth is located the right distance from the sun. Consider the temperature swings we encounter, roughly -30 degrees to +120 degrees. If the Earth were any further away from the sun, we would all freeze. Any closer and we would burn up. Even a fractional variance in the Earth's position to the sun would make life on Earth impossible. The Earth remains this perfect distance from the sun while it rotates around the sun at a speed of nearly 67,000 mph. It is also rotating on its axis, allowing the entire surface of the Earth to be properly warmed and cooled every day.    And our moon is the perfect size and distance from the Earth for its gravitational pull. The moon creates important ocean tides and movement so ocean waters do not stagnate, and yet our massive oceans are restrained from spilling over across the continents.4    Water...colorless, odorless and without taste, and yet no living thing can survive without it. Plants, animals and human beings consist mostly of water (about two-thirds of the human body is water). You'll see why the characteristics of water are uniquely suited to life:    It has an unusually high boiling point and freezing point. Water allows us to live in an environment of fluctuating temperature changes, while keeping our bodies a steady 98.6 degrees.    Water is a universal solvent. This property of water means that thousands of chemicals, minerals and nutrients can be carried throughout our bodies and into the smallest blood vessels.5    Water is also chemically neutral. Without affecting the makeup of the substances it carries, water enables food, medicines and minerals to be absorbed and used by the body.    Water has a unique surface tension. Water in plants can therefore flow upward against gravity, bringing life-giving water and nutrients to the top of even the tallest trees.    Water freezes from the top down and floats, so fish can live in the winter.    Ninety-seven percent of the Earth's water is in the oceans. But on our Earth, there is a system designed which removes salt from the water and then distributes that water throughout the globe. Evaporation takes the ocean waters, leaving the salt, and forms clouds which are easily moved by the wind to disperse water over the land, for vegetation, animals and people. It is a system of purification and supply that sustains life on this planet, a system of recycled and reused water.6    The human brain...simultaneously processes an amazing amount of information. Your brain takes in all the colors and objects you see, the temperature around you, the pressure of your feet against the floor, the sounds around you, the dryness of your mouth, even the texture of your keyboard. Your brain holds and processes all your emotions, thoughts and memories. At the same time your brain keeps track of the ongoing functions of your body like your breathing pattern, eyelid movement, hunger and movement of the muscles in your hands.    The human brain processes more than a million messages a second.7 Your brain weighs the importance of all this data, filtering out the relatively unimportant. This screening function is what allows you to focus and operate effectively in your world. The brain functions differently than other organs. There is an intelligence to it, the ability to reason, to produce feelings, to dream and plan, to take action, and relate to other people.    The eye...can distinguish among seven million colors. It has automatic focusing and handles an astounding 1.5 million messages -- simultaneously.8 Evolution focuses on mutations and changes from and within existing organisms. Yet evolution alone does not fully explain the initial source of the eye or the brain -- the start of living organisms from nonliving matter.    2. Does God exist? The universe had a start - what caused it?    Scientists are convinced that our universe began with one enormous explosion of energy and light, which we now call the Big Bang. This was the singular start to everything that exists: the beginning of the universe, the start of space, and even the initial start of time itself.    Astrophysicist Robert Jastrow, a self-described agnostic, stated, "The seed of everything that has happened in the Universe was planted in that first i|`|mWFlRQHRaa	*cricket*|`|W1XZ4kAVaa	Well he created you and me he's son saved us by being crucified on the cross|`|9mLjDa5kaa	Jesus is God, and He loves you so very much! :)     Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation.     The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|rMB71kZ8aa	Why believe in Evolution?  I am christian.  I don't believe in evolution.

But the basic reality of God is plain enough. Open your eyes and there it is! By taking a long and thoughtful look at what God has created, people have always been able to see what their eyes as such can't see: eternal power, for instance, and the mystery of his divine being. So nobody has a good excuse. What happened was this: People knew God perfectly well, but when they didn't treat him like God, refusing to worship him, they trivialized themselves into silliness and confusion so that there was neither sense nor direction left in their lives. They pretended to know it all, but were illiterate regarding life. They traded the glory of God who holds the whole world in his hands for cheap figurines you can buy at any roadside stand.     Psalm 14:1  The fool has said in his heart,There is no God. They are corrupt, They have done abominable works, There is none who does good.

aWHvHIr1aa	As Jeffrey, an expert in Judaism since birth, said in an earlier post,    ***Is Christianity a sick religion, or not. YES it is!!***  and in another post    ***If the story of Jesus is even partly true, he was born, and lived as a Jew. No one knows what he looked like, and the answer quoting Isaiah is wrong since that passage does not refer to Jesus in any way!  The artistic depictions of Jesus want to remove the idea that he was born and died a Jew, and was never a Christian. Christianity was started by Paul!***    This is an example of what happens when you can't hear the voice of God.  In every verse of the Tanach, the picture is that God is speaking and talking to His people.  After the fall of Mankind, God ALWAYS is trying to capture Israel's attention like a Father has to capture a 2 year old's attention.  Judges is an example of how God was always running after Israel....not Israel running after God.    But this all changed about the time Solomon's Temple was rebuilt and renamed "Herod's Temple."  According to non-Messianic Jews, God stopped talking to His people personally or through the prophets.  Thus started the era of the rabbi.    So when the Jewish Messiah came, Jesus was called rabbi and Jesus was the only rabbis hearing the voice of God.  As Jesus said, Jn 3:*** 10"You are Israel's teacher," said Jesus, "and do you not understand these things? 11I tell you the truth, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony. 12I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things?***  http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?sea...    It is as cat's meow said, ***Atheism doesn't, strange as it may sound, violate Judaism; there are Jewish Atheists. As Atheism doesn't involve worshipping idols or other deities, and as Atheists can and do enjoy and respect the complex ethical structure within Judaism, there's not the conflict that one might expect to find.***    Judaism has more in common with Atheists that don't believe in God or the Hebrew scriptures than they do with Christians who believe in Monotheism and the Tanach / Old Testament.    ***please no antisemitic comments***    This is not possible given that the Tanach is what Jews would consider antisemitic.    ***Furthermore HaShem spoke unto me, saying: 'I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people; 14 let Me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven; and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.'***    HaShem made antisemitic statements through out the Tanach.  Isn't the cause of all the problems of Israel because HaShem is antisemitic?      Nehemiah 9:26 ***Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against Thee, and cast Thy law behind their back, and slew Thy prophets that did forewarn them to turn them back unto Thee, and they wrought great provocations.***    How can anyone say that the Hebrew Bible isn't antisemitic with its harsh things that God and the prophets say?  As allonyoav said,    ***As for people claiming that jews see the events in the Christian Scriptures as accurate- that is absolute nonsense. We see the Christian scriptures as a highly anti-Semitic, inaccurate document that completely misrepresents jews, Judaism and any events that may have happened.***    Therefore, any Messianic Jew or Christian following the Tanach or NT is anti-semitic.  The only way not to be anti-semitic is not to bring God in the picture.    As the era of the prophet has ended, this means that Elijah, the prophet, can't come either....until the prophets and God can speak.    Hope this helps|`|hR7OsqtRaa	In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"    The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com|`|NaM4ZT64aa	Because the Hellenistic pagans were the majority, so Paul cared more about converting them than converting the Jews.

Christianity does not teach the teaching of Jesus it is the teachings about Jesus.    That being said do not overlook the value of your spiritual heritage, the river of truth running down through the centuries, even to the barren times of a materialistic and secular age. In all your worthy efforts to rid yourselves of the superstitious creeds of past ages, make sure that you hold fast the eternal truth.

Scripture ALSO states that the Gentiles would hear the message and believe.  And no human being, Jew or Gentile, will believe unless God wills it.    Isaiah 65 starts by God acknowledging that the Gentiles would accept Him:    1 I was sought by those who did not ask for Me;        I was found by those who did not seek Me.         I said, Here I am, here I am,         To a nation that was not called by My name.     But then, God goes on to say that the Jews were a rebellious people who had rejected Him time and time again:    2 I have stretched out My hands all day long to a rebellious people,         Who walk in a way that is not good,         According to their own thoughts;          3 A people who provoke Me to anger continually to My face;         Who sacrifice in gardens,         And burn incense on altars of brick;          4 Who sit among the graves,         And spend the night in the tombs;         Who eat swines flesh,         And the broth of abominable things is in their vessels;          5 Who say, Keep to yourself,         Do not come near me,         For I am holier than you!         These are smoke in My nostrils,         A fire that burns all the day.          6  Behold, it is written before Me:         I will not keep silence, but will repay         Even repay into their bosom          7 Your iniquities and the iniquities of your fathers together,         Says the LORD,            Who have burned incense on the mountains         And blasphemed Me on the hills;         Therefore I will measure their former work into their bosom.|`|A8LCP4Bkaa	Well, actually, it didn't.  At first, the Nazarenes (early "Christians") were a persecuted minority.  It wasn't until the Roman emperor Constantine made Christianity the state religion of Rome that folks started to convert, on threat of DEATH.    (Constantine was NOT a nice guy. When a fellow Roman, Maxentius, openly rebelled over Constantine's ascension to the rank of Caesar [which he shared] and naming as heir to the seat of Emperor, Constantine slaughtered not only Maxentius' troops, but also all his followers, including whole families.Later on, not even his own family was safe from his whims, as he had his wife and eldest son put to death.)|`|C9nOqOZKaa	For starters, most jews did not believe that JC was the Son of God, the Messiah, just as the muslims do not believe JC is the Son of God.  You have to understand that the Name of Jesus Christ was already spread out in the Hellanistic world by the romans and greeks, as several apostles traveled through those areas to preach the gospel of JC.    The teachings appealed more to the gentiles because they were inclusive and God is real, not like the pagan idols.  JC works (miracles) were a manisfestion of God to the living.  God is a loving God, merciful, and forgiving, unlike the pagan gods who "brought" malice to humans, so they thought.    The Teachings of JC were about justice, equality, discipline, forgiveness, and above all Love.  Arent all of them what we all strive for?  In essence, we can say that JC came to replace the pagan gods through his teachings, works/miracles, and human love for all, poor and rich, men and women.|`|AA10405801	It didn't.

The only thing that seperates the human animal from other animals is we think more.    i used to be "saved"  i used to think lieing, killing, stealing was "agienst god" and such.   but when i joined the Army and practiced shooting at picutres of people, i realized that eventhough the "lord" was in me i didnt want to see the paper move, i wanted to see the blood spatter of the person. Eventualy i thought about everying for a very very long time and ended with the conclusion that god isnt there.    to me, you can say "god has a plan for you" and "everyhing happens for a reason"   but to me its more comforting to think "wow, that bullet missed me, god must have been watching out for me" than "well luckly that time the bullet didnt hit me"  and if "god has a plan" for me then how do i know that plan dosent involve killing other people in war? or am i supposed to kill alot of people (who may not have belived in the "correct god" and went to "hell") and THEN be "saved" agian?   if "god" has a secret plan for me how do i know im actualy doing what "god" wants? hes not telling so how can i know?    but hey, thats just me, and my soldier point of view... :)|`|Hqan62xzaa	No Santa, No Easter Bunny.

He is my foundation and I am never letting go of Him.|`|hXHQ8mk7aa	yea     in my religion we have evidence for are god    so it also depends what religion are u    u know before all that     being a human bean  that matters       because god was a human too|`|vYQOVxguaa	Yes,Cause then if we didnt have god who would of made us.And we go to heaven when we die,thta or riencarnation.But i think god is real.|`|z5mQGdIAaa	Yes, God is awsome!

But I do believe that a God created the world. For me a God makes a lot more sense then the Big Band Theory. It is hard for me to believe that once upon a time there was absolutely nothing. There wasn't even blackness because there was nothing. There wasn't any space, there was just nothing and then suddenly there was something. It's just too hard for me to comprehend, so I do believe something created all of this.|`|5Xk1oVSSaa	absolutely. when i look outside i can clearly see the stars the sky, the ground, and human life. and i truly believe the the one and only God, my God, and whether you like it or not, your God, created everything and everyone. Some people might argue, how could a God that you say is so good cause people to die, and murders, and lying, and kidnapping, and starvation and war. well, its simple. SIN.  The devil is the one who tempts us to believe that God is not real, and that if he is he's evil. well obviously we shouldn't believe the devil, considering he's in hell. Even the Devil believes in God. and i do too.  "Believe on the Lord Jesus and you will be saved." Acts 16:31    "what is faith? it is the confident assurance that what we hope for is going to happen. it is the evidence of things we cannot yet see."  hebrews 11:1    i'm not trying to push anything on you, but God is real. I fully believe that. everyone has different oppinions, but just think about that. who created the world? it definitly didn't just POOF up like the big bang theory suggests.  God Bless,  Macie.  (i'm only 13 by the way.)|`|SbN2cXE5aa	Have you ever witnessed child birth?    Have you seen the Sunset?    Have you ever marveled at how complicated and intricate is your body, not to mention a Single cell?    Have you seen true love where people give of themselves to the point of dying for someone else, defying the idea of "survival of the fittest"?    Have you seen someone who has forgiven a murderer on death row for killing their child, spouse, etc.?    Have you ever read and understood the intricacies of the Scriptures that declare His truth?    Have you ever experienced so many "coincidences" in your own life or someone close to you that it defied all probabilities?

As for a reason, there are several, but I will confine my answer to the inability of evolution to explain the inherent ingrained concept of morality that all humans have. If you look at all cultures upon the Earth. All of them know that it is wrong to steal from one another. They all know that it is wrong to kill a member of their own tribe, they know that it is wrong to tell a lie. Most cultures have some form of punishment for not honoring their elders (some are tougher than others, but you get the point).These cultures vary widely, and a large percentage of them were not influenced in any way by Jewish or Christian beliefs. Evolution can not explain morals. The exact opposite would be a much better fit with the concept of survival of the fittest, but as we all know this is not the case. There are a multitude of reasons, both scientific and based upon philosophy as to why I believe. I could literally go on for hours, but I believe this is a good starting point, and worthy of contemplation on your part.|`|qRue8Xdraa	No, I like to believe in myself.|`|jhOxhnEuaa	Ok.. So lemme ask you this.. How is the world created? There is no scientific explanation to it yet..  Here listen to this: You agree that God is the greatest  and most perfect thing alive wether you believe in it or not right?  -You have an image of God right? Everyone does.. even if you don't believe in it.  -Anything that exists in real life is more perfect than anything that is imaginary..  Hence: God exists.|`|y0JoBMk8aa	yes i do even though its still hard even though i saw an angel while i was sleep.  he's very real.

I believe because it gives people faith in life. If dont have faith you wont really want to succeed and do well in life, because there will be no point. Faith is what keeps people going and gives hope. Even if you dont believe in God, its good to believe in something because it gives a reason to keep on living|`|JhEboCmDaa	I say I believe in god, but I use god very loosely.    I don't think anyone can know what god is, exactly. I basically believe that there is a point to life. There has to be some reason that the universe exists, it just seems right. It's very deep, but why would time and space even be here if it didn't have a purpose? People are not meant just to reproduce, because WHY would you want to live just to reproduce?    Anyway, I believe there's some force somewhere that is the very basics of our universe, and that it's inherently good. What it is exactly, I have no idea.|`|vVNs6nglaa	yes i do believe in God ,because he is wonderful he is what put me on this earth and i pray to God every night and day for letting me wake up every morning and getting to spend another day with my mother and with my 5 week old son Jeremiah ..life is good and i love it life is what u make it when u have God in your life it is so much better i love him so very much and im thankful to have God in my life ..GOD LOVES US ALL ...|`|2445122a71cbfe6773e3f6c3c401a3a4aa	After having lived through a war for most of my teens, I believe that there is a higher power.    Because of the above said war, I also believe that churches are nothing short of business places very much like the one Jesus went ballistic about.|`|7UX5V3AVaa	Yes I believe in the holy trinity, the Father Son and Holy Spirit.    The Bible is alive; it speaks to me. Quoted by Martin Luther. What does this mean to me? Well, it means that the Bible inspired Martin Luther as it does me. A Bible verse that really speaks to me is Zephaniah 3:17 which reads, The Lord your God is among you, a warrior who saves. He will rejoice over you with gladness. He will bring you quietness with His love. He will delight in you with shouts of joy. This Bible verse speaks to me because it clearly states many examples of what our God does.   First, Zephaniah tells us that God is among us. This reminds me that God is always there for me during the good times and the bad. He always hears my prayers and always answers them.  To me when Zephaniah compares God to a warrior who saves, its true. What I always find amazing is how people from the Old Testament talk about Jesus coming before he even came. Here Zephaniah tells us how God will save us all by sending His Son, a warrior who saves.    The rest of this verse reminds me of Sunday School when they always taught us how Jesus loves us. I think this is saying that Jesus loves us and He is happy that we are His children. Also when you are going through hard times God will embrace you with His love and comfort you when you go to him in prayer.   I know that through Gods Word, specifically this verse, I am reassured of Gods love. Whenever I am going through difficult times I can go to Him in prayer and know that he is always there for me. How comforting! My wish is for everyone to feel that comfort by going to God in prayer.    That was my Confirmation speech.|`|gMBSvalzaa	eh, i pretty much hate thinking about that sort of thing because nobody really knows, there's so many un explained things in the world, and science seems to come up with different theory's that out do believing in faith and all those things.. but i guess when your down in the dumps or having a rough time, looking to religious things might just feel good, like you have something to believe in? i dunno..|`|sgL0Vt6Daa	I really don't believe in God, i mean i do it to make my mother proud but my belief is what your actions are they do the most like if u get treated badly ur gonna treat the other person the same way i mean its the saying what comes around goes around God i think is a person that we think that has sacrificed his life for our sins, i mean isnt there freedom of religion? there could be so many so called "Gods" for instance Zeus and Hades, those are roman gods (i think) and my parents are Roman Catholic|`|UTgz8yNnaa	well yes i do believe in god.  I was brought up around him.  He has helped me grow to be who i am plus when times were tough for my family i prayed to him and he answered my prayers.  I know you might not bealieve in him but if you dont beleave he can never help you.  You need to have faith and know that god is there and if you make bad choices he will forgive but never forget.|`|G9liglrwaa	Yes, why shouldn't I?      A true story..When I was about 19 my family were having really hard times and I prayed..I said God I need new gym shoes and my parents can't afford to buy me new ones..The shoes I wanted were the cheapest I would wear they were $40... So I walked to a near by beauty supply store to get something( I can't remember what it was) and while standing in line i looked down and there was money on the floor! I couldn't believe no one noticed it so i picked it up and waited to checkout..I didn't count it until I made it in the house. It was $43 which was enough for the bus ride to buy the shoes and for the shoes as well. That is just one of the instances where I recall my prayer to GOD being answered right away... So like I said why shouldn't I?|`|6FX5mQctaa	yes times infinity.|`|qvNeo0G8aa	I believe in God because this world is too big and scary and amazing for me to understand on my own so I need an imaginary friend to hold my hand the whole time and to tell me that I'm worth something and life is worth living because without this figment of my imagination I'd feel like I was a pointless little insect with no direction or self-belief.     In fact I HAVE no self-belief. All the confidence I have comes from my unshakable knowledge that there's a big beardy dude in the sky who made everything and has a big plan set out for everyone and makes sure all the bad people go to a horrible place when they die and stay there forever and ever in searing hot pain. But he loves us all.    Of course not, if God exists - he'll delete this message.    You're reading it? Point proved.|`|1ZhB0mxCaa	110% yes!!!   god is real no doubt about it, i know this because me and my family have experienced the works of god maaany times, and once someone accepts god, they will see what i mean.    http://www.christian-faith.com/forjesus/...|`|yWng4fICaa	No,I don't believe in the human description of god, and the books that humans wrote about it. I think there could be a god of some kind, but I'm sick of humans saying this is the answer or that is a sin and this war or natural disaster is a sign from their particular book. Whatever. Nobody knows. It's not logical to believe in religion and it's funny to me how people can seem so smart in every aspect of life and also believe in a god that lives in heaven. It is impossible to debate religious people because all they have to do is say its faith and that ends any logical discussion.     This is the real life. This life is the only thing that anyone knows is real. It's a pretty sick life and it's hard sometimes and it's challenging but it's real and it's complex. I look at how complex the world is and that's what makes me believe there probably is a god or whatever. I don't know what I would call it, but the it's not the gods in the books. They are human creations. They are stories. Fiction. Fair enough, I am pretty sure there was a guy named Jesus and he probably did some good things and was probably a great speaker and very charismatic, but so is Barack Obama. He was a human and he died. He is not living in space somewhere waiting to defeat this Satan dude and let certain people in heaven and cast certain people to hell. I think that the religions are simple explanations for simple people.|`|mVWwOQbwaa	Yes.  I believe in A God (remember that "God" is just a title, and everyone has a god that they are religious about.  Whatever you "worship" - whatever you build your life around, whatever is the focal point of your life - that is your god).    I look at the laws of nature - and the miracles that defy them.  I look at the precision that is required for things as mundane as, a planet's orbit, and how everything has to be in balance for it to be steady.  Looking at the secondary gravitational influences as reflected by a comet's orbit, and realize that if the theories of accidental creation were true, the sheer physics just don't work.    So, I have to believe, logically, that an intelligent planner put this stuff in motion, already mature.  I look at babies - all species - and look at the "primitive" life forms, and I don't see any SIMPLE life forms.  If the theories about spontaneous generation of life were true, and about the random, accidental mutation of evolution being true - we would still see it happening in nature.  We would see, in the fossil record, parent species for the multitude of animals that died out in the Precambrian explosion.    We are told that evolution took places over "millions an millions of years", and that's why we don't see fossil evidence.  We happen to have "millions and millions of years" worth of fossils, and we don't see any transitional forms.  We see partial skeletons / fossils that the zoologists and biologists speculate about, but we have no hard evidence to support the THEORY of a godless universe.    Scientific method is ignored by anyone that tries to tell you that there is proof, or that evolution and / or the big bang are more than just theories - don't accept that just because "gravity is just a theory, too" that all theories are true.  We can observe, test, and record our own experiments to prove the basis of gravity ...     The scientific method dictates that to prove a theory, you must be able to observe the phenomena, you must be able to test the phenomena (your test results should also be repeatable), and you must be able to record the results.    Logic dictates that without proof or compelling evidence, you can't just accept something as true.    I believe in A god because of that ... I believe in a personal God, based on the Judeo/Christian histories for more reasons than I can list here ... but I do believe that He is active in the world, and in our lives.    I joke when I say "I don't have enough faith to NOT believe in God" ... but it's true ... I love how mathmatics has the "imaginary number" as an important part in higher maths.  There is something that we can't do, but it consistantly works in reality, so rather than call it something like "the God effect" or some such - they made the imaginary number, so they can apply it to their calculations where something happens that they can't explain (the something is where you have a negative square - in reality, for example, you can't multiply anything by itself, and get a negative number ... 7X7=49, and -7X-7=49 ... but when they do higher calculations, in engineering, where they have to rely on the laws of the physical universe, they have to accept that something they can't explain, happens ... thus, the imaginary number.)|`|Se8PTW62aa	yes, and fritoz makes the best point here.|`|q9075Yawaa	no,  I can not bring myself to accept the idea of loving parent allowing his/her children to slaughter millions of each other in his/her name.  god told me to kill?|`|ODTe2l77aa	No.|`|MGjMjWwaaa	yeah|`|Z2EzfQFvaa	Yes I do.Why?I believe in God because its my choice to.I wasn't raised Christian...I was raised to not believe in God..but as I grew up I looked into Him,and started going to church and made my own decision to believe in Him.|`|NCRfZRopaa	No, because there is no scientific evidence nor is there a good logical argument for a god.    All the theists have is their belief and personal experiences. And that cannot be proof from a outside perspective. If I said I believed that a rainbow colored unicorn talked to me and that unicorn did things, even producing "miracles," people would think I was nuts.    However, if enough people believed in that unicorn... well, you get the picture.|`|jJwuMTSqaa	I am not sure. I was raised with high hopes that he is real. But honestly, with the hardships and emotions I have dealt with throughout my life, I am unsure at this point. I understand that God makes you go through things in life to learn, but somehow, I feel that it is hell what I am going through and how could something so "caring" do this to one person. I am a good person inside. It is sad because it is nice to have that safety comfort of faith behind you.|`|2567c53ea5be1f53420408d56fd5f4b4aa	Of course not.|`|EuYO2qFbaa	NO|`|wnI04x8Kaa	Every 3.6 seconds someone dies of hunger.

I don't believe in God because too many terrible things happen in the world. You can't say it's because of a needed balance because too too many things happen that the balance of evil vs good is way too damn uneven. Also if you believe in a God that means you believe in a sadistic person who enjoys watching people suffer like it's a game. So why believe in someone and worship someone that horrible? I prefer to believe in no God than someone that enjoys suffering of innocent people and has all the power to change it but does nothing. I don't criticize those who believe in God, to the contrary I admire them for believing and having faith after all of this.|`|VshAeKqtaa	i believer there wasa man name jesus  that was a magician  and was not this all mighty man  he was just a normal man just liek all of us  im wiccan btw

Even if you chose to go thru the motions of any other believer and did your best to believe to cover your tail, the omniscience, omnipresence and omnipotence attributed to god would mean that you wouldn't get away with it.    SERIOUSLY.      Are you suggesting that people can actually PUT ONE OVER ON GOD???|`|Gn6jwmzCaa	Nope. The Soul, once freed from the constraints of the human body, IS a God. But to remain a God upon death of the human body, a Soul must retain it's individuality throughout the life of the human body.    During life, if the Soul is led to believe that it's existence is dependant upon a currently existing God, then such will be the Soul's eternity...spent groveling at the feet of a God that very well could be a lesser God had you had the nerve to rebel and challenge while in the confines of human life.    I don't expect you to understand, or anyone for that matter, nor do I expect you to believe as I do...what I do know is that when MY soul is freed I will become one more God out of many, equal to and possibly superior to all other Gods.|`|4obQz3FSaa	o.k.     Now the question is, which god?    There's thousands. you're probably going to say Christianity, but that's only because that's all you know, you have heard of other religions, but your friends and family don't practice those religions.

PikFGAXYaa	I do not believe there is proof of their existence.|`|tFoFchuEaa	You'd need either direct or indirect physical evidence to prove something exists.    Direct: a sample of life from another planet.  Indirect: a spectral analysis of a distant planet's atmosphere which contains a signature for an compound that has so far only been created as a byproduct of life forms.    The burden of proof is on the believer. So anyone stating that life does no exist doesn't need the evidence.|`|3RsV1ZHBaa	statistically, given the number of stars & planets in the universe, life exists on other worlds.|`|b7ae34ab971653d02308ce805affb7baaa	Well - now there are missions to Mars it should be easy to check at least THAT  planet - evidence is pointing to there being a fair to excellent chance that Mars had life and maybe even still does.    -Shouldn't this question be in one of the Science sections?|`|ebe9af0dbeaeb8a4623c52d9fc71c05faa	Well, over time, there are a few ways we will know if life existed or exists on other worlds.    1. Radio or electromagnetic evidence, this is by far the most likely method by which we will discover far off civilizations. With large, sensitive space-borne radio-telescopes, we will be able to detect faint and distant signals - either intentionally sent to US or just the back-ground noise of any radio using civilizations within a few hundred light years of our star-system. It's possible we could discover alien signals from millions of light years away - which could mean that the civilization in question has been dead or evolved onward, for millions of years before we ever received the signal.    2. Within 50 years we will probably know whether life exists elsewhere in our own solar system. It may very well be that heat + water  + chemicals + time = life, in which case the better question is not does LIFE exist, since (if this is true) then it will exist on almost every moon and planet, but whether intelligent life exists, which after all is really the question. But if you find pond-scum kinds of life-forms everywhere, it tremendously increases the odds of advanced life existing elsewhere.    3. In the most immediate future, space-probes like Corot and Kepler will be used to identify Earth-like worlds, in the years to come , even more advanced space-observatories may allow us to resolve the planets and surface features of the planets in distant star-systems, so we could see the homeworld or space-borne artifacts of some far-off species.    4. Artifacts - It's possible that we will find artifacts or crash debris or some other similar such evidence either in space or on the surface of any of the 60+ moons and planets we could send probes or establish colonies upon. So whether it's a giant Black Monolith, or just the alien equivalent of a Mc Donald's receipt, such an artifact would have all sorts of implications.    5. Direct contact - while this is the most unlikely possibility - it's not impossible that there are star-faring civilizations close enough to our star-system to travel here OR given enough time, it's very likely that we will eventually start sending star-ship space-probes to neighboring star-systems, such expeditions could certainly find life on other   worlds. So whether it's our landing on their world , or our ships meeting in space, or joining some interstellar alliance or some such, that might be how it happens.    6. Super-powerful space-based races, might have created  / engineered whole sections of some set of star-systems in a peculiar fashion which cannot be explained by natural causes. Finding stars in odd orbits or some similar situation, you might be able to infer that such an arrangement was not natural and be in the position of saying aliens exist on account of that super-stellar structure.    This all surrounds the idea of Drake's famous Equation , which basically lays out the odds of finding life in the Universe.    http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/origins/dra...    A good examination of the idea of our future as a space-faring civilization is presented by the folks over at Orion's Arm, the rule is simple, you must use HARD science (stuff that could actually exist) and describe some future situation.     http://www.orionsarm.com/intro.html    List of Orion's Arm "aliens" or xeno-sophonts as they are called.  http://www.orionsarm.com/xenos/index.htm...|`|IGu4bx51aa	You could have a word with my neighbor He's a Grey|`|d529cebfe13576f3ddee3e55b4cd08ffaa	We ourselves are plenty enough proof that it's possible.

The next alternative is a similar probe to Titan that can differentiate between organic produced molecules and those that are not.  (And yes, there is a detectable difference between organic methane and non organic).      If these two attempts fail, then we'll need to examine the other earth like planets and moons, but those are light years away.    Edit:  Just to be clear, there are around 400 billion galaxies, each consisting of around 100+ billion stars.  In the few stars that we have checked (it takes about 150 days per star) we have found 5 or more earth like (rock) planets.  From a planet perspective, this suggests that planets that could have earth like life are fairly common.  There is simply no way of knowing what other conditions could produce not earth like life.|`|2567c53ea5be1f53420408d56fd5f4b4aa	Detecting it by direct contact or indirectly by detecting the biological processes of life at a distance.

(Deut. 1:15) The Chief One over all the angels is Jesus Christ, the Word, the lone archangel, Michael. (Dan. 12:1; John 1:1; Jude 9; Rev. 12:7) He is also termed the angel or the messenger of the covenant at Malachi 3:1 and is the angel referred to at Revelation 20:1, 2 that binds Satan and his demons and casts them into the abyss of death for a thousand years. Without a doubt he also was the angel God appointed to lead the sons of Israel during their wilderness trek: Here I am sending an angel ahead of you to keep you on the road .?.?. my angel will go ahead of you. The angel of his person saved them.Ex. 23:20-23; Isa. 63:9, ftn.    Included among the angelic hosts are the seraphs. Isaiah alone refers to these, having seen them in a vision of Jehovah in his temple. Their name means burning or noble ones.Isa. 6:2, 6.    More frequently mentioned in the Scriptures are the cherubs, being noted some ninety times. It was a cherub who was in Eden and whose ambition caused him to become Satan the Devil. Cherubs guarded the entranceway to Eden when man was expelled from Paradise, and representations of cherubs were placed on the ark of the covenant that was housed in the most holy part of the wilderness tabernacle and later in Solomons temple. The cherubs appear to be bearers or escorts of Gods throne, upholding its majesty.Ezek. 28:16; Gen. 3:24; Ex. 25:18-22; Ps. 80:1.    And then there are the great body of angels or spirit messengers. We are not to think of these merely as errand boys but as agents and deputies, not only serving as a means of communication but also carrying out Gods purpose, be it the protection and deliverance of his people or the destruction of the wicked.|`|19922ecff123841b68f933197d10192baa	1)Seraphim,  2)Cherubim,  3)Thrones,  4)Dominations,  5)Virtues,  6)Powers,  7)Principalities,  8)Archangels,  9)Angels.|`|hmsMpECkaa	Well there's God.

Nobody knows what it was that he fell for (what did he do?) But I have my own beliefs why he has fallen.|`|AA11832138	Angels fall into two categories: the unfallen angels and the fallen angels. Unfallen angels are those who have remained holy throughout their existence and accordingly are called holy angels (Matthew 25:31). In Scripture, generally when angels are mentioned, it is the class of holy angels in view. By contrast, the fallen angels are those who have not maintained their holiness. Holy angels fall into special classes, and certain individuals are named and mentioned. Michael the archangel is likely the head of all the holy angels, and his name means who is like unto God? (Daniel 10:21; 12:1; 1 Thessalonians 4:16; Jude 9; Revelation 12:7-10). Gabriel is one of the principal messengers of God, his name meaning hero of God, and was entrusted with important messages such as those delivered to Daniel (Daniel 8:16; 9:21), to Zacharias (Luke 1:18-19), and to Mary (Luke 1:26-38).    Most holy angels are not given names but are described only as elect angels (1 Timothy 5:2-10). The expressions principalities and powers seem to be used of all angels whether fallen or holy (Luke 21:26; Romans 8:38; Ephesians 1:21; 3:10; Colossians 1:16; 2:10, 15; 1 Peter 3:22). Some angels are designated as cherubim, which are living creatures who defend Gods holiness from any defilement of sin (Genesis 3:24; Exodus 25: 18, 20; Ezekiel 1:1-18). Seraphim are another class of angels mentioned only once in Scripture in Isaiah 6:2-7 and are described as having three pairs of wings. They apparently have the function of praising God, being Gods messengers to Earth, and are especially concerned with the holiness of God. Most of the references to holy angels in Scripture refer to their ministries which cover a wide field of achievement. They were present at creation, the giving of the Law, at the birth of Christ and at His resurrection, at the Ascension, and they will be present at the Rapture of the Church and the Second Coming of Christ.    In stark contrast to the company of holy angels, the fallen angels are also innumerable and are described as fallen from their first estate. Led by Satan, who was originally a holy angel, the fallen angels defected, rebelled against God, and became sinful in their nature and work. Fallen angels have been divided into two classes: those who are free and those who are bound. Of the fallen angels, Satan alone is given particular mention in the Bible. When Satan fell (John 8:44; Luke 10:18), he drew after him one third of the angels. Of those, some are reserved in chains awaiting judgment (1 Corinthians 6:3; 2 Peter 2:4; Jude 6), and the remainder are free and are the demons, or devils, to whom reference is constantly made throughout the New Testament (Mark 5:9, 15; Luke 8:30, 1 Timothy 4:1). They are Satans servants in all his undertakings and share his doom (Matthew 25:41; Revelation 20:10).

[POSSIBLE, whether or not it's allowed is a different question.]    How does one define marriage?  Is marriage an institution of convenience or is it part of human society from the beginning?  If it was an invention of man, who invented it and when?    Whether or not a person has a right to [or may] marry a person of the same sex  seems to be less of an issue than CAN a person do so.  e.g. The government can pass a law that says men may not give birth to children.  So, I'm discriminated against!!!! If the government then rescinds the law and says I now have permission to do so, does that now mean I am ABLE to bear children???    In this context, I think religion is not the main issue, but logic and reason.  How does one define marriage and does "same sex marriage" change the original meaning and substance of what marriage is?    BTW:  Does one have to marry a person in order to love him???    Can you love someone deeply without attempting to put your penis in him?|`|G9VBTg47aa	who are we to judge|`|AA11849917	It's rather presumptuous to assume that just because someone disagrees with you that automatically makes them wrong.    Thieves also think that cops are wrong!  Just because YOU think something is OK, since the universe doesn't revolve around YOUR opinions, there is the possibility that YOU might be the one in the wrong.    Or are you just too narrow minded and bigoted to accept other people's views and opinions?    Additional thought:  After reviewing the answers, I notice that mostly atheists accept same sex marriage (for the most part).  Strange that (again, for the most part), people who don't accept God and the higher moral standard that comes with believing in God, accepts same sex marriage; and (yet again, for the most part), people who accept God and the higher moral standard that this entails, does NOT accept same sex marriage as valid.    God - even just the very idea of God - represents the very highest morality.  That's why people swear over a Bible.  That's why when people curse, they use God's name ("God D" this, and "God D" that - never "Buddha D it" or "Krishna D it"), and that's why people are asked "Do you swear to tell the truth ... so help you God?" - because it represents a higher morality.    So, why is it that people who do NOT accept this higher level of morality (i.e. atheists who do not believe in the existence of God) accept gay marriage, while (for the most part) people who DO believe in God (and this higher level of morality) do NOT accept gay marriage?    To the christian, even LOOKING at another person with sexual desires or thoughts is considered a sin (adultery, according to Jesus), and even just being ANGRY at another person is considered a sin (murder, according to Jesus).  So, while Christians are called to a higher level of morality, I guess the rest of the world resorts to a lower (ergo a non) moralistic stand.  (When it comes to morality, anything less than perfection is non existent according to Jesus).    And you wonder why Christians say that atheists have no morals!  Good grief, Charlie Brown; they reject God's morality for something that God says is NOT moral at all!|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	marriage is wrong. a couple shouldn't have to prove how much they love each other by signing some paper work and having a ceremony.

Human beings are the recipients of countless mercies. Providence watches over and shields them. Upon them are poured the choicest gifts in heaven's treasury. Yet notwithstanding this, men show a growing disregard for God and a growing contempt for His law and for the salvation placed within their reach by the death of the Saviour.          Men have lifted themselves up in pride and self-sufficiency, casting down the needy and oppressing the hireling in his wages. Against them have been registered covetousness, pride, and self-indulgence. They show contempt for the laws which govern God's kingdom. God has borne long with them; but in response to His amazing forbearance, men are approaching that degree of iniquity which the antediluvians reached, to perish in the waters of the flood, and which the Sodomites reached, to be destroyed by fire from heaven.          Some believe Satan's assertion that there will be a second probation. They say that even though they now resist the Spirit of God, refusing to improve their day of grace, they will be given another opportunity to gain heaven. But those who cherish this belief are under a deception which leads to ruin. When God gave Christ to our world, He gave in this one gift all the treasures of heaven. He held back nothing. He can do no more than He has done to bring men to repentance. He has no means held in reserve for their salvation.         God bears long with the rebellion and apostasy of His subjects. Even when His mercy is despised and His love scorned and derided, He bears with men until the last resource for leading them to repentance is exhausted. But there are limits to His forbearance. From those who to the end continue in obstinate rebellion, He removes His protecting care. Providence will no longer shield them from Satan's power. They will have sinned away their day of grace.|`|saDjgQkxaa	Same sex marriage is in no way wrong. It's perfectly natural to be gay.      Atheist.|`|ZjSgawcpaa	I'm an Atheist.

While the Bible doesnt address the concept of gay or same sex marriage, the Bible does clearly and consistently tell us that homosexual activity is a sin (Genesis 19:1-13; Leviticus 18:22; Romans 1:26-27; 1 Corinthians 6:9). God does not create a person with homosexual desires. A person becomes a homosexual because of sin (Romans 1:24-27), and ultimately because of his or her own choice. A person may be born with a greater susceptibility to homosexuality, just as people are born with a tendency to violence and other sins. That does not excuse the person choosing to sin by giving in to their sinful desires. If a person is born with a greater susceptibility to anger / rage, does that make it right for them to give into those desires? Of course not. The same is true for homosexuality.    We also have to remember that homosexuality is just as forgivable a sin as all other sins. Gods forgiveness is just as available to a homosexual as it is to an adulterer, idol worshipper, murderer, liar, proud man, etc. Gods love and desire to save extends to homosexuals (John 3:16; Romans 5:8). God also promises the strength for victory over sin, including homosexuality, to all those who will believe in Jesus Christ for their salvation (1 Corinthians 6:11; 2 Corinthians 5:17).    To give sanction to homosexual marriage would be to give approval to that lifestyle, which the Bible clearly and consistently condemns as sinful. I believe that Christians should stand firmly against the idea of gay marriage / same sex marriage. Marriage is ordained by God to be between a man and a woman (Genesis 2:21-24; Matthew 19:4-6). Homosexual marriage is a perversion of the institution of marriage and an offense to the God who created marriage. God forbids and condemns homosexuality, so He clearly is opposed to homosexual marriage. As Christians, we are to seek to share the love of God and salvation through Christ with homosexuals. We are to be loving and kind to homosexuals, while at the same time not condoning their sinful lifestyle.|`|P3Fg1K2Vaa	christian;   Gay marriage goes against god's nature  Satan is what makes you think it's alright  Gay marriage entered the world after man's sin  God did give us freewill though  Sometimes I myself want to argue wit the idea but god didn't create us for it so I just have faith in god about it.|`|NI0cNU22aa	I am a Jew  I believe that marriage refers to a union sanctioned by G-d.

To have blind faith is illogical, but to have a faith that is wise, intellectual, and based on a good foundation, that is something we all need.      There are many answers out there, and many dont seem that good.  Believing in Jesus is not stupid, but based on logical, historically accurate documents, as well as personal experiences (but beware, personally experiences dont justify everything!)

For instance, even in Catholicism, every religious order has a shelf life of about 200 years....some have fared better than others.      Yet because we have a recorded history that's fairly accurate, we still have to take into account the social atmosphere of the time those records were written.  We shouldn't assume too many things about their attitudes or emotions (that is to say, we cannot foist our own upbringing and education on them).    For the most part, it appears that both religion and science have made progress, in a way that we may even put on a piece of graph paper so that we can see the social implications of both.    I bet they're more intertwined than the DNA molecule.    Far as I can see we seem to be going in an "up" direction on both counts.  Religion cannot thrive without opposition any more than science cannot thrive without a mystery to unravel.    Religion is content to let mysteries lie, and simply admire  Science is never content, but a restless catalyst of potent energy.    Sometimes, both can go horribly wrong.

Because God is very very real.  . when i look outside i can clearly see the stars the sky, the ground, and human life. and i truly believe the the one and only God, my God, and whether you like it or not, your God, created everything and everyone. Some people might argue, how could a God that you say is so good cause people to die, and murders, and lying, and kidnapping, and starvation and war. well, its simple. SIN.  The devil is the one who tempts us to believe that God is not real, and that if he is he's evil. well obviously we shouldn't believe the devil, considering he's in hell. Even the Devil believes in God. and i do too.  "Believe on the Lord Jesus and you will be saved." Acts 16:31    "what is faith? it is the confident assurance that what we hope for is going to happen. it is the evidence of things we cannot yet see."  hebrews 11:1    i'm not trying to push anything on you, but God is real. I fully believe that. everyone has different oppinions, but just think about that. who created the world? it definitly didn't just POOF up like the big bang theory suggests.  God Bless,  Macie.  (i'm only 13 by the way.)|`|JREs9K0Gaa	I don't believe everyone has the same questions.  Some are looking for a close relationship with God and believe they can have it through their religion.|`|ZdUfMuGGaa	People need something to believe in, and simply can not let it all go and admit that we do not know what happens when we die, and can not admit that there are things we do not know. I am an athiest, but my girlfreind is not, and she even told me that she needed something to believe in and (since she was raised in a christian / thiest society), she is going to believe, even if its wrong.   We believe what ever we are raised to believe, whether it is right or wrong, and most of us will not change that belief because it is imbedded into our fragile minds and brains that it is truth and everything else is wrong...  You cant reason with people who wont admit they are wrong.  The Bible even contradicts itself tons of times, but people will simply close their eyes to things they dont want to see.   There is no use in trying to reason with thiests.|`|angW1Lkfaa	When it comes to religion right, wrong, indifference, they all thing their right.

Very good movie.|`|YupMCYHlaa	For me it would be more like  film festival.  I can think of more than one or two films.    1. The Ten Commandments.  It has always has been my favorite, though it's kind of dated these days.  I was raised Jewish and I remember going to see that film at our little neighborhood theater when I was about eight with some other Jewish friends of mine, and walking home from the theater being so proud to be Jewish.  Strangely, one of the 'user' comments in the IMDB site calls it a 'Christian' film.  8^)    2.  King of Kings, the 1927 silent version.  GREAT film!    3.  The Last Temptation of Christ.  This is not a film about Jesus having sex, it's about Jesus having sexual -thoughts-.  If he didn't then he wasn't human.  Besides, I'd like to see all the fundamentalists' heads explode. 8^)    4.  The God Who Wasn't There. After all, not everyone on R&S is religious.    If there's time, then Ben Hur also.

One girl asked about how often she should read her Bible, and that she had trouble finding time to read it every day.  I told her, using knowledge that I had from my English class, that it's easier if she set out a certain time each day (say, 8:00 in the evening) and plan for an hour or two of strict reading.    I've answered similar questions in such a fashion.  I don't just go on every question that is directed towards Christians to tell them that belief in God is stupid--that would be childish of me.    I am, however, pretty frank with the Christians who ask stupid questions ("If we all came from monkeys, why are there still monkeys?").  I have low tolerance for ignorance.  I also have low tolerance for conversion tactics (the only problem I have with Christianity--I understand why it's done, but I like the religious diversity in this world).|`|78VY1OiHaa	Most Atheists that I know are former Christians and most that I'm acquainted with know a lot more about the Bible and Christianity than many current Christians on this website.

b845752fe1a81266746c1f68e850090baa	Something tells me this question is legit.    You are unbelievably precious in the sight of God, and don't you doubt it for a minute. I guarantee you that as insignificant as you may think your role in life is now, there will come a time when you'll look back and wonder how you could ever doubt your own worth. In all likelihood, one day you will have a family of your own. You will have an unimaginable influence on your children as they carry your genetics and your influence. And how could you express to them their incredible value, if they posed this same question to you?    No, the world will not be the same without you. Stick around and make a difference.

Perhaps the world will then be a better place.  At the very least, you might make some money from your writing.  On the other hand, you can make the world a better place by making someone happy.

If you are thinking about committing suicide, then you really need to get your head out of your ***, and think about how your family would take it.  Besides, suicide is pointless, since God will just reincarnate you back into the same kind of life to teach you a lesson.  So, dont be a coward, do the things you need to do to defeat the enemy, whatever it is, loneliness, romantic relationships, money problems.  No problem is so big that taking your life would be the correct answer.

HOQp0gA7aa	Personally speaking I am not afraid of the Islamic world.  However, I am highly distrustful of all extremists and their hate filled teachings.  So that means much like with Christians, the Islamic world is judged on the world stage by the actions of the worst examples of the faith, not the actions of the best.  They may be a minority, but since you leaders fail to condemn their horrible acts, you get painted with the same brush by their actions.    This also happened to the Catholic Church when they failed to condemn the actions of pedophile priests.  As well as some Protestant faiths when their leadership has been caught in lewd and compromising behavior with youths and prostitutes.  This doesn't mean all Christians are bad, just like it doesn't mean all Muslims are bad.  However, if you want to avoid being lumped in with the bad ones, you can start by not defending their actions just because they carry the same membership cards as you.    I hope this helps.|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	I'm not afraid of Islam nor Muslims.

Now it is in the world already.     2 John 1:7 -  For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who don't confess that Yeshua the Messiah came in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the Anti-messiah.  ~~~~~~~    It cannot be dismissed that the Islamic religion teaches that Yeshua isn't the Messiah.    It is all-be-it the extremist of their religion that is willing to slay all that do not bow and adhere to their god 'Allah.'    This is no different than when Daniel was thrown into the lions den or when he was put in the fiery furnace because he refused to bow to anything other than the Almighty God.    These extremist believe that they are in a holy war - who is that holy war against?    Could it be those that follow the true God of Israel?    We all know that they have a great hatred toward Israel, is it such a leap that they also hate Israel's God fearing followers?    It is a little bewildering that this group of people would strap bombs on their women, children and young men all in the promise of having 72 virgins when they die!

The don't even love their own children to let them do such a thing.      Islam uses Jihad (holy war) to force religion. The Hadith (another "holy" book of Islam) says that Jihad, or holy war, is the second best thing to believing in Allah and his apostle (Muhammad). Allah's apostle was asked, "What is the best deed?" He replied, "To believe in Allah and his Apostle." The questioner then asked, "What is the next?" He replied, "To participate in Jihad in Allah's cause." (Hadith vol. 1, no. 25).     7) The Quran requires violence. Sura 9:5 says, "Fight and slay the pagans wherever ye find them, and seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every strategem of war." Sura 5:33 records what is done to infidels who resist Islam: "Their punishment is...execution, or crucifixion, or the cutting off of hands and feet from the opposite sides, or exile from the land." Muhammad also burned out eyes with hot irons (Hadith vol. 1, no. 234) and deprived people of water until they died (vol. 8, no. 796).|`|Wi0LBsVbaa	I am just as "afraid" of the rabid self righteous people who claim to be Christians, who think its OK to persecute those who do not believe as they do.

The problem is, there are many Muslims out there who take out parts of Islam and twist it and mould it to how they see fit.  Like people who talk about Jihad.  There are two Jihads.  the Jihad within yourself where you have to fight the obstacles within yourself to become a better Muslim.  The second Jihad is if you are living in a country where as a Muslim, you are being ill-treated and you can not practice your faith.  You have these scholars who talk about Jihad and they talk about the West like it's an evil place.  They will stand inside mosques and tell other younger Muslims that they will go to heaven if they kill western people.  These younger Muslims will go and do their evil bidding and spread all of this hatered to other people.  How are Muslims being treated unfairly in England?  Muslims can pray,however they want, there are even Mosques being bulit in this country and no one has a problem with that.  It becomes very frightening when  you are sitting on a bus and you hear Muslims born in this country, talking about how kufars (non-believers)  should be forced to convert to Islam.  I've never heard anyone form any other faith speak like that but I see and hear many Muslim people on the buses, in the streets talking about it.  Openly, as though it were nothing.  It doesn't help that the media are always showing lots of extremist Muslims on television and in the papers.    When i was younger I had a  teacher who was a Tunisian Muslim and he was extremly peacefull and knowledgeable about Islam. He was a devote Muslim and he didn't go around threatening non-believers with violence.  His wife wasn't a Muslim either.  I know that enlightened people like him are few and far between but if there were more Muslims like that, in the public eye.  I don't think that people would be so frightened of Muslims and, they would be more willing to learn about Islam.  Rather than hearing some distorted view of it on the t.v, or  through the speakers of their radio.|`|Oj5WKasmaa	Not enough information, ignorance, lack of understanding among others.

2a15567c279249eba1fd60e6cb9ad41baa	The thing is, there are certain things mentioned in the Quran as specificall and out right haram--flesh of swine, dead meat...etc. Then there are things that are "in doubt." When in doubt--go the safer way. Fruits and plants have these chemicals NATURALLY--meaning by the will of God. Toothpaste--well, we humans put those chemicals in there. I think you'll agree that this is a question of faith and abedience rather than just chemicals. We do not know whether or not God approves of chemicals derived from animals, why not avoid it altogether? It can bring us benefit since we are doing this to gain God's pleasure. Get it?  Also, it's best to stay away from the limits set by God. Meaning--if God says that haram animals are not to be eaten, why test that limit by thinking that their cheical derivatives are okay? Today we use Colgate, tomorrow we say we can eat pig soup cause it's got chemicals but no meat (lol). We shouldn't get all nit-picky about things when there are other alternatives---like crest :)    --------------------------------------...  I think I did answer your question: once again, the fruits and plants that are formed out of animal waste and byproducts are formed by GOD--He is the One who naturally created everything out of His Wisdom. We can not control the natural life cycle. He has his own methods of purification and creation. When we pick a fruit off of a tree, that fruit was made by nature. Toothpaste is man-made, and we can control what we put in it. So why argue with God and say "Hey, you put animal by-products in your fruits, how come we can't put them in our toothpaste?" Don't try to argue with God. He tells us what we can do, and we do it because He knows what is best for us.  Again, it is a matter of faith.|`|AA12383474	yeah we do but not that much. i use colgate. and i don't think toothpastes may be haram. we just eat what we should eat and we don't eat what we shouldn't eat. because the things we don't eat are all harmful for us/all the people. that's why god makes it haram for us. because he knows everything.|`|AA10061646	hi....

You answered your question above by saying, that the product has overgone total chemical transformation, so it is not what it is when used as a fertilizer, etc..Islam has prohibited blood of any type. You will agree  that a chemical analysis of blood shows that it contains an abundance of uric acid, a chemical substance which can be injurious to human health. The toxic nature of uric acid, in the human being it is excreted as a waste product and in fact we are told that 98% of the body's uric acid is extracted from the blood by the kidneys and removed through urination. Now I think that you'll appreciate the special prescribed method of animal slaughter in Islam.You see, the wielder of the knife, whilst taking the name of the Almighty (GOD), makes an incision through the jugular veins, leaving all other veins and organs intact, this causes the death of the animal by a total loss of blood from the body, rather than an injury to any vital organ. If the organs, example the heart, the liver, or the brain crippled or damaged, the animal could die immediately and its blood would congeal in its veins and would eventually permeate the flesh. This implies that the animal flesh would be permeated and contaminated with uric acid and therefore very poisonous; only today did our dietitians realize such a thing. Again, while on the topic of food; Why do Muslims condemn the eating of pork or ham or any foods related to pigs or swine. Actually, apart from the Quran prohibiting the consumption of pork bacon (pig flesh); in fact the Bible too in Leviticus chapter 11,verse 8, regarding swine it says,         "of their flesh (of the swine another name for pig)shall you not   eat, and of their carcass you shall not touch; they are " unclean to you."   Further, did you know that a pig cannot be slaughtered at the neck, for it does not have a neck; that is according to its natural anatomy. A Muslim reasons that if the pig was to be slaughtered and fit for human consumption the Creator would have provided it with a neck. Nonetheless, all that aside, I am sure you are well informed about the harmful effects of the consumption of pork, in any form, be it pork chops, ham, bacon.The medical science finds that there is a risk for various diseases as the pig is found to be a host for many parasites and potential diseases.even apart from that, as we talked about uric acid content in the blood, it is important to note that the pig's biochemistry excretes only 2% of its total uric acid content, the remaining 98% remains as an integral part of the body.    Note: Islam forbids not only pork but meat of all those animals who eat their own or some one else's body waste; the most commonly known animal in this category is pig or swine whose meat is commonly known as pork.    about colgate, it probably has some thing derived from pigs or prohibited animals, and as you read above anything from such animals is purely harmful to humans. This is what I know, and from this you can reason out why islam prohibits things of the such. I hope you understand why chickens are not prohibited now, (if the chicken was slaughtered the islamic way of course).ANd you might ask if everything gets broken down, then we can eat any animal...think about it, a pig (for example) eats its or other animal wastes, so what good will it derive from that?? While a chicken who eats worms or insects as you said is eating a complete living thing, no matter what, it will derive good products from its complete body and excret the harmful ones...i hope my point is clear.|`|AA11959964	What are you saying? I'm Muslim and I use it ... it's not Haram ... for a very good reason ... I don't eat it or drink it ... it doesn't participate in my body construction process...    And as for the other matter about things mixed with other things derived from Haram Stuff:  ==========================  Plants and trees and animals have such a system in its bodies that takes only what it needs , things that are vital to it ... that's why nothing Haram in it ... and everyone knows what this plants contains ... unless it was grown in a field contains Chemical stuff...    But as for products made by Humans ... when I buy some product ... I don't know how was it made ... but anyway I can't trust it ... God didn't tell me that eating it under any circumstances is allowed like plants and animals...    Because Plants and Animals are the work of God when these products are made by humans...     You can trust God's work ... But you can't trust Humans' work...                                   And why Pork meat is Haram:  =====================  1.  Pork prohibited in the Bible:  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^...  As Pork is prohibited in Islam, Pork prohibited in the Bible  The Christian is likely to be convinced by his religious scriptures. The Bible prohibits the consumption of pork, in the book of Leviticus  And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be cloven footed, yet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you.  Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcass shall ye not touch, they are unclean to you. [Leviticus 11:7-8]    Pork is also prohibited in the Bible in the book of Deuteronomy  And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not the cud, it is unclean unto you. Ye shall not eat of their flesh, nor touch their dead carcass. [Deuteronomy 14:8]    A similar prohibition is repeated in the Bible in the book of Isaiah chapter 65 verse 2-5.    2. Consumption of pork causes several diseases:  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^...  The other non-Muslims and atheists will agree only if convinced through reason, logic and science.     Eating of pork can cause no less than seventy different types  of diseases. A person can have various helminthes like roundworm, pinworm, hookworm, etc. One of the most dangerous is Taenia Solium, which is in lay mans terminology called tapeworm.     It harbors in the intestine and is very long. Its ova i.e. eggs, enter the blood stream and can reach almost all the organs of the body.    If it enters the brain it can cause memory loss. If it enters the heart it can cause heart attack, if it enters the eye it can cause blindness, if it enters the liver it can cause liver damage. It can damage almost all the organs of the body.    Another dangerous helminthes is Trichura Tichurasis.    A common misconception about pork is that if it is cooked well, these ova die.  In a research project undertaken in America, it was found that out of twenty-four people suffering from Trichura Tichurasis, twenty two had cooked the pork very well.     This indicates that the ova present in the pork do not die under normal cooking temperature.    3. Pork has fat building material:  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^...  Pork has very little muscle building material and contains excess of fat. This fat gets deposited in the vessels and can cause hypertension and heart attack.    It is not surprising that over 50% of Americans suffer from hypertension.    4. Pig is one of the filthiest animals on earth:  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^...  The pig is one of the filthiest animals on earth. It lives and thrives on muck and dirt. It is the best scavenger that I know that God has produced.     In the villages they dont have modern toilets and the villagers excrete in the open air. Very often excreta are cleared by pigs.    Some may argue that in advanced countries like Australia, pigs are bred in very clean and hygienic conditions.    Even in these hygienic conditions the pigs are kept together in sties. No matter how hard you try to keep them clean they are filthy by nature. They eat and enjoy their own as well as their neighbors excreta.    5. Pig is the most shameless animal:  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^...  The pig is the most shameless animal on the face of the earth. It is the only animal that invites its friends to have sex with its mate.    In America, most people consume pork. Many times after dance parties, they have swapping of wives;  I.e. many say you sleep with my wife and I will sleep with your wife. If you eat pigs then you behave like pigs.    I hope I answered your question the best way I could...     With my best regards...|`|AA11368537	islam is  quite one wierd religion.|`|AA10980590	huh? serious? i'm a muslim and i use colgate, sensodyne and all sorts of items! but honestly, conservative muslims are ultra-senstive about things they use/consume/drink.     i mean, i do not eat pork or any meat that did not go through the muslim slaughter ritual and neither do i drink alcoholic drinks. it's really about not consuming the obvious.    and goodness me, people! be matured in your thinking! for muslims who havent seen the world like those living in maybe, say, afghanistan, may think that christianity and other religions are weird!    and, the reason why it is haram for muslims to consume pork is because WE CONSIDER it as dirty for a pig's life basically is to roll around in the mud, and because they are lazy. it might sound weird to people who know nuts about islam, but MAKE AN EFFORT TO STUDY SOMETHING BEFORE JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS!    if the jews can have kosher meat, we are entitled to the halal meat rite?|`|19b77f159858ac9dbb2d173dc3598738aa	Because they're pretty dumb.

0663cd60bdf0f9da5f5ec28de5ff0e0baa	Pedro  Irm?o do Apstolo Andr, era um pescador no mar da Galilia, mais precisamente da cidade de Cafarnaun. Seu nome era Sim?o, mas recebeu de Jesus o sobrenome de Pedro ou Cefas, que significa pedra em grego e hebraico, respectivamente.  Junto com os irm?os Tiago e Jo?o Evangelista, fez parte do crculo ntimo de Jesus entre os doze, participando dos mais importante milagres do Mestre sobre a terra.  Existe uma passagem peculiar nos Evangelhos, em que Pedro nega por trs vezes que seria Apstolo de Jesus. Quando, como Jesus predissera, o galo cantou depois da terceira negativa, Pedro verteu-se em lgrimas.    tido como fundador da Igreja Crist? em Roma, considerado pela Igreja Catlica como o primeiro Papa. Depois da morte de Jesus, despontou-se como lder dos doze Apstolos, aparecendo em destaque em todas as narrativas evanglicas. Exerceu autoridade na recm-nascida comunidade Crist?, apoiou a iniciativa de Paulo de Tarso de incluir os n?o judeus na f crist?, sem obrig-los a participarem dos rituais de inicia??o judaica.  Foi morto em Roma no ano de 64 D.C., na persegui??o feita por Nero aos crist?os, crucificado de cabe?a para baixo, conforme a sua vontade, pois n?o se achava digno de morrer como Jesus.  Seu tmulo se encontra sob a catedral de S. Pedro, no Vaticano, e  autenticado por muitos historiadores, sendo validado pelo Papa no ano de 1968.    Andr  Foi o primeiro dos doze a ser chamado por Jesus. Era irm?o de Pedro e tambm pescador. Antes de seguir o Mestre, era discpulo de Jo?o Batista, que o mandou junto com um outro n?o identificado (talvez Jo?o Evangelista), para segui-lo.  As tradi??es indicam que ele tenha ido a lugares distantes para pregar o Evangelho, e que tenha morrido em uma cruz em forma de X na Grcia, de onde o seu corpo foi levado para Constantinopla, tornando-se padroeiro desta cidade.    Jo?o Evangelista  Filho de Zebedeu e irm?o de Tiago, o Maior, que junto com este e mais Pedro participaram do crculo mais ntimo junto a Jesus.  Autor do quarto evangelho, de trs cartas aos crist?os em geral e do Livro do Apocalipse. O seu evangelho difere dos outros trs que s?o chamados sinticos ou semelhantes, sendo que a narrativa de Jo?o enfoca mais o aspecto espiritual de Jesus.    considerado "o discpulo amado". Era muito jovem na poca da vida do Mestre, e na crucifica??o foi designado por Jesus a tomar conta de Maria, demonstrando a o quanto este confiava em Jo?o.  Jo?o viveu o resto de sua vida em feso, juntamente com Maria, onde teria escrito o Evangelho e as cartas. Durante o governo de Domiciano, foi exilado na ilha de Patmos, onde escreveu o Apocalipse.  Morreu em feso, em idade muito avan?ada, tomando conta da igreja que estava nesta cidade.    Tiago, o Maior  Pescador, irm?o de Jo?o, o Evangelista, filho de Zebedeu, fazia parte do crculo mais ntimo de Jesus. Aps a morte deste, permaneceu em Jerusalm, junto a Pedro, sendo executado em 43 D.C., por ordem do rei Herodes Agripa, logo depois da morte de Estv?o, dicono grego e exaltado pregador crist?o.    Tiago, o Menor  Filho de Alfeu, conhecido tambm como Zebeu, tornou-se um membro altamente respeitado da recm-nascida comunidade crist? em Jerusalm. Foi um observador da normas judaicas, defendendo que estas normas deveriam fazer parte do Cristianismo. Com isso, tornou-se adversrio de Paulo de Tarso nesta quest?o, mas tambm foi conciliador e um pregador fervoroso do ensino de Jesus.   Foi atacado por se recusar a denunciar os crist?os, sendo apedrejado at a morte, por ordem do sumo sacerdote Ananias.    Mateus  Tambm chamado de Levi, filho de Alfeu. Era publicano, ou cobrador de impostos, classe muito odiada na poca de Jesus, por cobrarem impostos dos judeus para serem entregues s autoridade romanas. Escreveu o primeiro evangelho, onde d mais nfase ao aspecto humano e genealgico de Jesus. Pregou no norte da frica depois da morte do Mestre, prosseguindo at a Etipia, onde foi morto.    Felipe  Aparece rapidamente nos Evangelhos, n?o nos deixando muitas informa??es sobre ele. Diz-se que evangelizou na Ituria, reunindo-se a Andr, no mar Negro, sendo morto na Frgia, para onde seguira.    Tom  Tambm chamado Ddimo ou Gmeo, era o terceiro apstolo em idade depois de Pedro. Ficou famoso pelo fato de ter duvidado que Jesus tinha ressuscitado, e disse que s vendo acreditaria. Ent?o, Jesus apareceu para ele e respondeu que muitos n?o iriam ver e acreditariam. Depois da crucifica??o, passou a pregar na Prsia e na ndia, mas seus restos mortais s?o venerados na Sria.    Judas Iscariotes  Judas de Kerioth, localidade da Judia. Dizem as tradi??es que este apstolo era designado para cuidar do dinheiro comum, por ser um dos poucos instrudos.   Foi enganado pelos sacerdotes que o induziram a mostrar onde estava Jesus a troco de 30 moedas de prata, prometendo que s o prenderiam durante as festividades da Pscoa Judaica.  Depois que viu a crucifica??o de Jesus, Judas, amargamente arrependido, jogou as 30 moedas aos ps dos sacerdotes, indo se enforcar. Estes pegaram o dinheiro e compraram um terreno para servir de cemitrio aos estrangeiros, sendo posteriormente chamado de Campo do Sangue.    Judas Tadeu  Tambm chamado Lebeu Tadeu,  um dos doze citados nominalmente por Mateus e Marcos. Contam as tradi??es que trabalhou na Mesopotamia e na Prsia.    Bartolomeu  Tambm chamado de Natanael no Evangelho de Jo?o, evangelizou na Armnia, junto ao Mar Negro, onde, segundo uma lenda posterior, foi esfolado vivo, vindo a morrer.    Sim?o, o zelote  Era chamado assim porque pertencia a uma seita chamada de "Os Zelotes, ou zeladores", que lutava para a liberta??o de Israel dos Romanos. Seita ultra-nacionalista e n?o religiosa.

KPjvW0Auaa	From what I hear, If the pharmaceutical companies have their way, they might have a pill for "shyness".    Answer for Question 1:  For the most part, it's not even "cured", but "treated".  It's a way to make money.  I mean no cure for A.D.D, but they do treat it.  Pharmaceutical companies will make more money treating a disorder/disease than they will by curing a disorder/disease.  By treating, you go back more times to get more medication.      Also, the FDA (if i'm right) labels anything not right with a person (like A.D.D. or Depression) a "Disease", then conjures a rule that only a "drug" can cure a disease (and by cure, I think they mean treat), then conjures a rule that labels a drug as "something man made", ergo not natural.    Added answer for Q1:    A: people don't want to deal with the problem by confronting it. By that I mean people would rather buy a diet pill than eat right and exercise to stay thin (at least this is the way for most people - for some, it's a lot harder than that).  People will argue their point by saying "I don't have time to exercise", but people only complain about the things they can change.  You notice nobody complains about gravity - it's just there and nothing can be done about it, so nobody complains.      For confronting depression, what is a cause - why is a person depressed today and not 5-10 years ago?  feeling of failed accomplishment in life (not doing what one wanted to do in life)?  Not living where one wants to live?  Kids?  Bad marraige?  Believe it or not these problem all have solutions.  The trick for people is to find the solutions which may mean making a drastic change in life or lifestyle.  Most people don't want to do that.    B:  All the commercials you see on t.v and hear on the radio have an impression on people    Answer for Question 2:  From what it seems, anti depressants may just stall it (if not make the problem worse). From what I hear however, it does work for some people.    Did this give any answer to your questions?|`|AA11221077	I doubt that one anti-depressant did anything of the kind for you. It takes roughly 2 weeks for the medication to get into your system and you need to use it consistently to keep the effects.     Anti-depressants are great if your symptoms are caused by a real condition like a chemical imbalance.     But we are a highly over-medicated society and to go one further, we're over-analyzed, too. We don't need medication for every little thing. And why do we need a shrink every time we hit a little bump in the road? Get up, dust yourself off, and learn from the experience.    edit:  We sure did. People are spoiled now. There are many advantages to living in a society like ours, but plenty of disadvantages that people don't recognize.|`|Mcf6Jcycaa	It doesn't but this is how doctors make their money.|`|776589002e81a2ccbdeac49289e4a235aa	the pharmaceutical industry is one of the top businesses in the united states alongside oil companies and big tobacco. in order to make money, the companies convince American consumers that they have "symptoms" for various diseases, disorders, and other medical issues.     you've probably seen those commercials where they keep listing symptoms until they get one related to you. the pharmaceutical companies bank on Americans being hypochondriacs.     also, you know all those anti-drug commercials you seen against marijuana and other illicit drugs? they are paid for by pharmaceutical, tobacco, and alcohol companies. they don't want you to stop taking drugs. they just want you to take THEIR drugs. this is why marijuana is illegal in this country because it can do what aspirin does without the silly side effect caused by overdosing...which is death.|`|vPRx0dseaa	Because the pharmaceutical industry is playing us for suckers.

Most people think the only one that's real is the one their parents told them was real. Coincidence?    Nobody has ever provided any evidence that any gods, much less a specific god, exist. People believe in specific gods because of indoctrination from an early age, tradition, apophenia, hallucinations, fear of torture (for gods sadistic enough to threaten it) and other similarly illogical reasons. But no gods exist in reality; these are all stories, created for people who were scared of the world long before we understood it. Now we have no more reason for these superstitions.

The Feminine Goddess is just as important. To say that there is only one god is to say that there is only one path for religion or spirituality.  These crazy new ideas for religion (which include the beliefs of all of the children of Abraham) make little sense to me. Especially the demonisation of sex and The Old Religion, the coconcept that you are not worth anything and you can not enjoy life until you are dead and the uneven bias towards the Male over the Female.   To my mind The Old Religion is much more compatible with science (which grew out of Alchemy) and to the world around us. That and you can actually do something with it and takeresponsibility forr your own life, mind, body and soul. Why sasacrificeverything in this life just to get to the afterlife when you can have more in life and after death?    There is also the problem that none of the known historians from the same area and peperiod that JC was supposed to be around have evmentionedd him or anything he has done.  The best thatcurchcurch could come up with was finding words ths looked like "Christ" in history books (ie. "cristos" - the anointed) to "prove" that he existed. And the biggest thing is the one document that was used as proof of his existance has been proved to forgeryrgary for over one thousand years, just as all of the so called relics that have been subject to scientific testing.  This along with allatrocitiesitise that the churchcommittedmited has led mbelieveelive that YHWE is a god not worth my time.  Please dinterpretrprut this as an attack on you or your religion, I am just answering your question.  We all find what works for us for religion is a personal thing.    As for who created the bible it was human kind that created it, look insnide the cover does it say "(c) YWHE, printed in heaven" ?|`|vp9dHjQkaa	I respect your belief, but have my reasons for not believing in God:    1.  I have faith in the scientific method.  When something is supported by evidence, I am more inclined to believe it.  For this reason, I do not believe in God; likewise, I do not believe in some scientific theories.  If someone presented me with convincing evidence (involving repeated experiments with statistically valid data) of a Supreme Being (s), then I would certainly consider it.    2.  Scientific theories, such as Abiogenesis and Evolution, "ring true" to me, just as the idea of a God "rings true" to you.  I admittedly have no way of knowing without a shred of doubt that these theories are true (Although repeated experiments show that the above theories are likely true, we have no way of absolutely knowing.  That's why they're theories).  In a way, science is my religion.  It takes faith in the human senses to believe in science:  If we cannot trust what we see with our eyes, then nearly every scientific idea is invalid.      Imagine that our lives are elaborate dreams, and that really we are neural tissue blobs floating in some sort of nutritious sludge.  Everything we know, all of the measurements we've taken, the people we go to church with, are figments of our imaginations.   Unlikely, maybe.  Or maybe not.    3.  Even if there is a God, I disagree with his/her ideals as they are stated in the Bible.  God, if he/she exists, doesn't support equal rights, and wants to damn everyone who doesn't believe in him to hell.  There are many good Samaritans who are atheists or have other beliefs; it seems that God is being -- forgive me -- rather childish to take only a person's beliefs into account.  The Bible has many examples of contradictions, bits that don't quite make sense (why did jesus have to die for our sins to be erased?  Couldn't god just erase them if he was all powerful?), and changes in tone throughout that make me doubt its veracity.  I would rather burn in hell than support a God I don't agree with out of fear.    If there is a God, I believe that he/she is more alien and non -human than we can imagine.  However, if he/she has a moral code, I would be willing to bet that it would involve your kindness and compassion far more than your loyalty.    4.  "Religion" is limiting.  The tree of knowledge is forbidden.  Throughout history, ignorance has often been a tool to control large numbers of people.  I have a feeling that that's what the bible is:  a way to control people, written by an ancient politician.  By denying people the option to seek a second opinion, or take another look at what they're being told, they're denying people the right to make the decision.  If I am born a Christian and stay that way only because I know nothing else, am I truly a Christian?  I think that being a true Christian would involve looking deeply at my faith, both good and bad, and still feeling that it was right.    5. In my experience, many (though not all) devoutly religious people are not tolerant of others, and are no more moral than their godless peers.  Contrary to what many religious persons believe, atheists DO have an incentive to follow a moral code:  We desire fair and compassionate treatment from others, and seek to treat others fairly and compassionately.  It's groupthink.  It's the golden rule.  Humans are social animals, and naturally seek acceptance from others.  The best way to gain acceptance is through kindness.      6.  Blind faith is cowardly.  Think over your beliefs.  If, after weighing the pros and cons, you still believe in and respect your God, than you are a stronger Christian (or whatever) for your loyalty in the face of opposition.  If anything, your faith will be strengthened.  If you find that the faith you have does not hold up to your scrutiny, then that's fine too (since your belief in God would cease to exist, so should your fear of his wrath).  So long as you remain kind to others and tolerant of their beliefs, you're a good person.  I bet God would think so too.|`|8sxffX7Qaa	simply put?    evolution  makes  more   sense  to  me.    end of story.

Revelation 20:14 explains that death and hell were hurled in the lake of fire this means the second death.  How can you put fire in fire the lake of fire symbolizes total destruction of death and hell mankind's common grave.    If they did what would be the purpose of the resurrection Jesus spoke of?

A person who becomes strong ("evolves") does not need a crutch.|`|AA11991317	If you believe in a spirit you will answer this question one way and if you don't you will answer another way.   Life is like a circle it you believe in a spirit. One point on the circle is at the moment of birth. The spirit joins the body at that point and is carried away into this reality by the body. The farther around the circle the body goes, the farther away from the spirit's source it is and the easier it is to disbelieve in that source.     But with increasing experience in this reality, the intelligent mind learns more and more. At some point the wisdom reaches a point where it dawns on the mind that the more one knows, the larger the awareness of what one does not know. The small, inexplicable details, the mathematical impossibility of certain events, and the personal experience with philosophy, physics, astronomy, logic, and the awareness of personal death, brings the mind to the point where the source of the spirit is once again perceived to be real, and not simply a myth.     The blindness brought about by this world fades away and the personal enlightenment begins. But probably most people live most of their lives in the middle ground, where they only follow what they are taught to believe. The don't know. They only have faith that what they are told is true. During this time many experiences in this world lead many people to reject the idea of the spirit in the first place. They become blind to both faith and spirituality. So, during the middle phase, it is true that many become blind. But they are not dead until they die, except that they may do things that a spiritual person might not do. Their actions spring only from the mind. In that aspect of behavior, their spirit might as well be dead, since it is not affecting their behavior.  But life proceeds around the circle.  At the end of life the spirit leaves the body and returns to the source, carrying away whatever lessons it learned from the experience...     For those who lived life as if there were no spirit within them, they will go back with the wisdom that such a person gains from those kinds of experiences.     For those who lived life as if there were a spirit within them, they will go back with the wisdom that such a person gains from those kinds of experiences.     Probably you are in the middle of life. You can try to attain more wisdom by hard study and contemplation.     Science can explain a lot of the mysteries of the universe. It can not explain the origin of life, the origin of miracles, the reality of love, prophesy, healing, visions, or any of the events we ascribe to the spiritual realm. In many cases science can only describe, without knowing what something is. There are so many things beyond our comprehension. The most intelligent first believe that they can understand it all. But in the end, the most intelligent know, that they can not.    Grasshopper is a reference to a student of Oriental Philosophy who one day surpasses his master. May it be true in your case.|`|58bd0e644de710ca2b2dce7effc23144aa	http://www.notreligion.com/|`|395ba13b6215bd11920db288b39e6959aa	First, Bible translations can vary from book to book. I know of one reference to a grasshopper in my bible and it's saying eating them is not kosher. (Maybe eating you isn't kosher either?)    We all grow in different ways spiritually as we grow older. Whatever path you take is your business and if this Christian is your friend, he needs to respect your beliefs. That IS being Christian. If he's not your friend... why are you talking to him? Ignore him, that's what they fear the most.|`|AA12363172	In a way, yes. it's been well established that the higher the IQ and the higher the level of education, the less likely that someone will be gullible enough to fall for the lie that is religion.  So don't think of it as being "spiritually blind" think of it as opening your eyes to reality.|`|284035f02b8fbda312a9d2931616d63aaa	I'm not sure about the grasshopper reference. And I can't tell you for sure what he meant about how the "more I evolve or grow, the more spiritually blind and dead I become." But I think what he meant was that the more you grow in the way the world calls growth, the more spiritually dead you become. God's wisdom is called foolishness by the world. So if you're pursuing worldly things, like wealth, power, sex, happiness based on yourself, friends for the sake of having more friends, then that may be what he's talking about. He might also be saying that you may become prideful as you do the things that are "churchy" or "good," so you stop looking at how far you fall short.|`|AA11537777	LOL, I think I get it.     (But if I don't... well, I'll give you something similar to chew on.)    I've said it myself -- "The more I grow and learn about God, the less I feel like I know and the more uncertain things become."    The "riding a bike" example is cliche, but it gets the point across. With the training wheels, you feel very safe and stable. The bike will stay up. You can depend on the structure of the bike. All you need to do is pedal/coast. You can even sit there and not move at all, and not fall over.    When the training wheels come off, the bike gets very unstable. You have to commit to moving forward, without assurance the bike will stay up. It wobbles, you feel like you will spill any moment and get hurt.     But you can't be free to fly until you take off the wheels.    Soren Kirkegaard talked a great deal about not knowing things for sure, about the anxiety of what faith really is. You finally have to make a dreadful leap through darkness, in order to have faith and continue the search for God.    As a final idea, God doesn't want us to be rigid little clones who do the right things because we are following rules, he wants us to be like him and love him.     When you first "find God," you often have the security of the "rules" of the faith. You feel zeal, everything is black and white and clear to you, everything seems simple. Just follow the rules and all will be well. God's presence feels as if it is always there beside you; you feel as if you experience him.    Then comes the dark nights of the soul, where nothing makes sense. Tragedy strikes, and it no longer feels like God is there. You have been abandoned, seemingly, and just hearing "You have to believe and all will be well," is not good enough. Your faith is challenged and you seriously have to question God.    See, he lets himself feel present when you're spiritually young, to give you encouragement and foundation; but there is no way to grow further until he backs off. So God seems to disappear, and things become unclear... because you now have to make choices about whether you will pursue him or abandon him. Do you want him or not?    So the older you get spiritually, I think the more common it is to have experiences where nothing seems to make sense and where God seems absent in many ways. You no longer have "all the answers" and in many ways feel blind.     All you have left to give is yourself: Love.    Oh, there are also moments of clarity, where God "touches" base after you've sought for him anyway, but in order to shape us into an active, loving force like himself, he "weans" us off mountaintop experiences and often lets us walk seemingly by ourselves, without apparent help, so that our legs will get stronger.    So the impersonal rules grow more vague and meaningless, whereas what changes is your attitude towards others and life: how you treat other people and care for them in love.|`|4e4cc5399a94567bdb60a5cc3c0d9056aa	Maybe he was trying (badly) to express the contradiction between spirituality and worldly knowledge?  But you never can really tell what anyone means when they say things like that.  Honestly it sounds like this person isn't really sure what they mean themselves, I'd ask him to elaborate.  Could be that the grasshopper reference was not biblical at all, (Unless he was likening you to one of the plagues of Egypt?) but instead, it is possibly from and old television show called Kung-Fu.  In it, they used a 'grasshopper' reference to show an immature student of the marshal arts who hadn't quite learned enough yet. His teacher often referred to him as "grasshopper."
AA11192489	Do you mean English from, say... The Scarlet Letter era - Goodwife Hester Prynne?    In that instance, it is used as a courtesy title for a married women, rather like Madame (or the shortened term Ma'am) is used today. But it is an antiquated term.    If you mean just a good wife (2 words) in general, that is the woman married to a man that puts up with his mess, his crap, his family, his friends, his moods, his habits, his neverending interest in sports, weapons and tools, and gives him lovin's all because she loves him.

A cult is a religion that tries to place a barrier between the lost human and God. Jesus cleared that way for us 2000 years ago. Most conservative Christian Apologist would call these churches cults: Catholic, Mormon( LDS, RLDS), Jehovah's Witness, and many of the hundreds of Pentecostal/Charismatic churches. These are called Pseudo-Christian cults because they do seem christian, but they do not follow the Bible or place Christ as the head of the church.|`|AA11902108	those people need to rationalize why their ego's won't allow them to worship something that requires delayed gratification.|`|46e1cd462731e0d27d0f22b42a8e4494aa	For the same reason they do the same to Islam    In religion and sociology, a cult is a cohesive group of people (often a relatively small and recently founded religious movement) devoted to beliefs or practices that the surrounding culture or society considers to be far outside the mainstream. Its separate status may come about either due to its novel belief system, because of its idiosyncratic practices or because it opposes the interests of the mainstream culture. Other non-religious groups may also display cult-like characteristics.    In the English-speaking countries since about the 1960s, especially in North America, the term cult has taken on a pejorative and sometimes offensive connotation. This largely originated with highly publicized cults that purportedly exploited their members psychologically and financially, or that allegedly utilized group-based persuasion and conversion techniques. These techniques may include "brainwashing", "mind control" ("thought reform") and "love bombing", whose scientific validity, modern and historical use, and effectiveness (for religious conversion) are discussed within the linked articles.|`|3c561ed23c558a69cb5d2b89ac25967faa	It is not just Christians but many different types of religious groups that are considered a cult. Part of it is some of the things that members do.   They have services about life and death with lots of symbolism and statues. People go to church and pray to a statue, but the bible says make no thing on earth that is in heaven.  They go around the world recruiting members. If God was so knowing all powerful, and the only God, you would not need to walk around telling people about him, they would know. But instead Christians go to remote places to introduce God to people who did not need him before they came.   There is a confusion about when you die, some say go to heaven, others say come back to life. Pick just one.

1595a0e9e412912fd096bc1b0d5507c3aa	Everytime is prayed to God, I'd feel Him there, very still, in my room. And when i closed my eyes, I'd feel so calm and feel His presence around me as well... It's very peaceful and I pray often.    Once, my friend, was so hurt, so down, depressed and everything... and nothing seemed to help. He couldn't relax and was always so tensed up. His health was affected and everything turned against him. He then finally prayed to the lord, pouring out his woes and pain, and then started crying and weeping.    He then felt warm, caring arms embracing him and telling him in his ears, "Find rest in me... I am the Lord, in whom you can trust." My friend has changed ever since that incident. He shared his wonderful testimony to the church...    Wow....    God works miracles... Praise Him!

Needing something like goosebumps or a warmth or something like that.  Now that I'm older and have learned more I understand truth, faith, and the word.  You don't need to feel something.  If the word tells you the Lord is in the midst of a situation (depending on which verse you read) Faith should take over and trust the truth of the word.  I don't pursue a feeling anymore.  I know he is there.  I know because the word tells me and that's enough for me.|`|a9e9a33434fc889694cecc671b241442aa	The question is, if you dont feel His presence, is He still listening and there with you.  Nobody feels God everytime we pray, but He is there and and He is interested in what each one of us, individually, has to say.  We dont pray to feel His presence cause its just not biblical, but we pray cause He promised we would come before His throne when we did.  When i was going through trials or away from God, i would feel like He was so distant from me, but as i matured, i realized that He was with me all the time and its that sin that makes us feel left out in the open without Him.|`|3f66740e90250df1cbe3cb5559ceda56aa	yes I do...Only if I've put everything else out of my mind though...if you aren't focused on Him then there is no way you can feel Him....|`|cfd629454428a62c17f3a2bb85a96110aa	If you think you feel God, then you do.

Yes, there are "wrong" ways to be Neo-Pagan, in that the result is not Neo-Pagan religion, or the result is not functional spirituality at all. They tend to be fairly extreme, though...

In terms of neo-Paganism in general, likely not - there's simply too many religions that fall under that religious umbrella, and many of them are fairly permissive in their practices.  If you're referring to a particular neo-Pagan religion, then I can see how there would be certain ways (such as consistantly acting against the precepts of that particular religion.)|`|a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	I would say that atheistic beliefs would not meld well with neo-paganism.

People are always trying to prove or disprove each of them - even though it was something like 40 years ago.      We're all interested in knowing the "truth" about how Marilyn Monroe died too.

d51fde6d673575897dc9ede2bbb81cf9aa	Te envio esto que me enviaron a mi... :-)  Una vez, alguien le pidi a un filsofo espaol, muy conocedor   del pueblo argentino y con un gran cario por ellos, que hablara de los argentinos, pero que lo hiciera con visin objetiva, como se dice "desde fuera del bosque", lejos de toda pasin.  Esto fue lo que dijo:  Los argentinos estn entre vosotros, pero no son como vosotros.  No intenteis conocerlos, porque su alma vive en el mundo impenetrable de la dualidad.  Los argentinos beben en una misma copa la alegra y la amargura.  Hacen msica de su llanto -el tango- y se rien de la msica de otro; toman en serio los chistes, ... y de todo lo serio hacen bromas.  Ellos mismos no se conocen.  Creen en la interpretacin de los sueos, en Freud y el horscopo chino, visitan al mdico y tambin al curandero todo al mismo tiempo.  Tratan a Dios como "el flaco" y se mofan de los ritos religiosos, aunque los presidentes no se pierden un Tedeum en la catedral.  No renuncian a sus ilusiones ni aprenden de sus desilusiones.  No discutais con ellos jams! Los argentinos nacen con sabiduria inminente!  Saben y opinan de todo!  Arreglan todo en una mesa de caf y en programas de periodistas/polticos.  Cuando los argentinos viajan, todo lo comparan con Buenos Aires.  Hermanos, ellos son "el pueblo elegido"...por ellos mismos.  Individualmente, se caracterizan por su simpata y su   inteligencia, en grupo son insoportables por su gritero y apasionamiento.  Cada uno es un genio, y los genios no se llevan bien entre ellos; por eso es fcil reunir argentinos, unirlos imposible.  Un argentino es capaz de lograr todo en el mundo, .... menos el aplauso de otros argentinos.  No le hableis de lgica. La lgica implica razonamiento y mesura.  Los argentinos son hiperblicos y desmesurados, van de un extremo a otro con sus opiniones y sus acciones.  Cuando discuten no dicen: "No estoy de acuerdo", sino: "Usted esta equivocado!".  Aman tanto la contradiccin que llaman "brbara" a una mujer linda, a un erudito lo bautizan "bestia" a un mero futbolista "genio" y   cuando manifiestan extrema amistad te califican de boludo; si el afecto y confianza es mucho mas grande, eres un Hijo de puta...  Cuando alguien les pide un favor no dicen simplemente "si", sino "como no!".  Son el nico pueblo del mundo que comienza sus frases con la palabra NO.  Cuando alguien les agradece, dicen: "NO, de nada!" o "NO" con una sonrisa.  Los argentinos tienen dos problemas para cada solucin. Pero intuyen las soluciones a todo problema.  Cualquier argentino dir que sabe como se debe pagar la deuda externa, enderezar a los militares, aconsejar al resto de Amrica latina,  disminuir el hambre de Africa y ensear economa en USA.  Los argentinos tienen metforas para referirse a lo comn con palabras extraas.  Por ejemplo, a un aumento de sueldos le llaman "rebalanceo de ingresos", a un incremento de impuestos "modificacin de la base imponible" y   a una simple devaluacin "una variacin brusca del tipo de cambio".  Un plan econmico es siempre "un plan de ajuste", y a una operacin financiera de especulacin la denominan "bicicleta".  Viven, como dijo Ortega y Gasset, una permanente disociacin entre la imagen que tienen de si mismos y la realidad.  Tienen un altsimo nmero de psiclogos y psiquiatras y se ufanan de estar siempre al tanto de la ultima terapia.  Tienen un tremendo super ego, pero no se lo mencionen porque se desestabilizan y entran en crisis.  Tienen un espantoso temor al ridculo, pero se describen a si   mismos como liberados.  Son prejuiciosos, pero creen ser amplios, generosos y tolerantes.  Son racistas al punto de hablar de "negros de mierda" o "cabecitas negras".  LOS ARGENTINOS SON ITALIANOS QUE HABLAN EN ESPA?OL.  PRETENDEN SUELDOS DE NORTEAMERICANOS Y VIVIR COMO INGLESES.  DICEN DISCURSOS FRANCESES Y VOTAN COMO SENEGALESES.  PIENSAN COMO ZURDOS Y VIVEN COMO BURGUESES.  ALABAN EL EMPREDIMIENTO CANADIENSE Y TIENEN UNA ORGANIZACION BOLIVIANA.  ADMIRAN EL ORDEN SUIZO Y PRACTICAN UN DESORDEN TUNECINO.  Son un misterio....|`|d7097ad8ea3a228abb40cfd861294d01aa	Son unos dioses con el balon, muy cultos y educados (algo que suele escasear ultimamente).

Os macacos, os homens, as aranhas, as bactrias, os peixes, as plantas, todo ser vivo evoluiu de um ancestral em comum, que existiu h milh?es de anos.    Este ser inicial, um replicador (algo que pode se multiplicar), era algo muito simples, minsculo, rudimentar.    Desde ent?o surgiu a evolu??o. Quando algo que se multiplica surge, com possibilidades de muta??o, surge a sele??o natural, a sobrevivncia dos mais aptos.    Ent?o a evolu??o tem trilhado seu caminho inconteste pelo mundo, forjando novas espcies e ampliando os horizontes da natureza.    O homem n?o descende do macaco, como muitos dizem. O homem tem um ascendente comum ao macaco!!!     Quanta ignorancia! Basta abrir um livro de biologia. Venda sua bblia e compre algo que preste!    Sem ressentimentos! Desejo lhe esclarecer a mente!

N?o existem infernos ou cus, seja de qual religi?o estejamos falando.    Cu e inferno s?o cria??es remotas, desde antes do surgimento do cristianismo, ou das outras religi?es de maior monta de hoje.    Lderes espirituais criaram tais conceitos como um meio de impor medo e angstia no esprito dos fiis. Como o conhecimento humano ainda era limitado quela poca, alegorias e mitos eram criados para explicar todo o tipo de acontecimento: as chuvas, os dias e as noites, a cria??o, a vida e, justamente, a vida aps a morte, que nunca houve nem nunca haver.    Posteriormente, com o surgimento do cristianismo, a igreja catlica apostlica romana acolheu tal mito como um modo de manter seus fiis "na linha". Cu e inferno eram lendas manipuladas pela igreja para intimidar os crist?os e impor a doutrina do Vaticano, para conseqentemente ampliar seu poder sobre a Europa e o resto do Novo Mundo.    Mas os conceitos de cu e inferno n?o s?o exclusivos do cristianismo. Tambm o judasmo e o islamismo se utilizam de tais conceitos para impor a f majoritria aos seus seguidores, e doutrin-los intelectualmente.

208912a8605462d2ec452a9e3ec6bcceaa	I think Chuck (who asked the question) is working hard to get lots of questions into the Yahoo Answers system.  Some recent prior questions included goodies like "why do people pick their nose" and "do you think the world will end soon".    Reminds me of the joke by Bill Cosby in his album "Why is there air", where Bill replies that any physical education teacher knows why there is air: There's air to fill up volleyballs and basketballs and stuff like that.      The answer to your question will be: It depends.    If the gal is reasonably good looking and not too fat, and the breasts are not too gigantic, then yes, I like women with big breasts.    Women who have big breasts are often overweight - and overweight people aren't as appealing as people who have a reasonable weight.    Magazines and movies have made a fortune from fully or partially exposing big breasts to their audiences.  It's been said that Playboy magazine single-handedly changed the American society from thinking that small breasts were in style, to thinking that big breasts were required for the gal to be in style.    Who knows, maybe small breasts will someday again be viewed as 'preferred' or 'in style'.|`|AA12064314	Yes|`|54a8e0354bc847720c2fa2bf164d4cc3aa	no|`|AA11172694	I likes All women|`|8f94b7113f43f66409cce5cf435c00a3aa	NO.|`|fabbcf11b50a8bd33c9209b74f2a514faa	Not usually.|`|6dc081259bf26e63ff6a918cfdfa685baa	yes but and a cup is fun to so what is your fave size
AA11648615	I don't know where most people get their info from, but Jesus is the Father.|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	God is a Trinity made up of three co-eternal and co-equal persons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.    When you worship one person of the "Godhead" you worship all of them.    Jesus, in his humanity, rightly showed respect and reverence for his father, and likely still does in heaven, but that doesn't make one less godly than the other.    Jesus certainly is the mediator between God and man, but once you're an adopted child of God, he doesn't make you go through your brother every time you need to pray. Once baptized, you're a member of God's immediate family, and you can pray to which ever person you choose.    If you're not sure about this, just listen to the words of the "Our Father" prayer the next time you pray it.    Once you're baptized, you can even call God the Father "Dad" (Abba).|`|AA12235811	Jesus and the Father are one. When Jesus was here, he glorified the Father in everything he did.

God is supposed to be the one worshipped.  There is nothing saying we can't worship Jesus who is His son.  But God is the one that created us, He is the one to be worshipped.  People hold Jesus at such a regard because He is the one that was nailed to the cross to save us from sin.  The end result of sin is death.  Jesus saved us from that.  So some people feel that he deserves more than God.  But in fact Jesus was just doing what His Father told Him to do.|`|7233e6830ebf71c4ccb9929bb7662552aa	You should worship the Goddess!|`|2889b7708743bbca0b71792f90a65926aa	Jesus came here to tell us about the Father (among other things).  We often attribute human qualities to God...but He is above all that...it's sometimes the only way we have of relating to Him, I suppose.  He's "all that" but so, so much more.  We had to know Jesus was held most high...so we could trust in His word...and He sits at the "right hand of God"...and therefore, He was declared Son.  I hope this makes sense to you.  He was a very real, and loving spirit, who often guides us through the chaos.|`|AA10273874	Anthropomorphisation.  i.e. man understands another man, Jesus, better than man understands God, a spirit.    What you really have to ask yourself is why no one talks about the Holy Spirit, since that is the presence of God in the world today.  I think it is because the Holy Spirit never was anthropomorphised.   He's represented as a "tongue of fire", or a "dove".  People can't wrap their brains around that, so they ignore it.|`|2006b8954c1947b9429c00b39378e779aa	"He that honors the Son honors the Father also, He that denies the Son, denies the Father also."  - from the Bible|`|d069f92a5a294de73234a8876d46ccc6aa	Jesus and God are ONE.

Some religions do hold Jesus as dearer but then some also think he is God when he himself in the Bible prayed to his Father at John 17:3 that it means eternal life for people to know the only true God and the one he sent forth Jesus Christ.  At John 20:17 he told Mary Magdalene he had not yet ascended to his Father but to go to the brethren and say "I am ascending to my Father and your Father to my God and your God."  Jesus commanded at Matthew 4:10 it is God you should worship and to him alone you must render sacred service.  Don't be discouraged by what the majority of people do. Remember Gods attributes (some are listed at Nehemiah 9:17) and then realize that yes Jesus showed those attributes also in a perfect way, but it is always to "God alone you render sacred service."   Hold them both dear to you, God for all his love and mercies shown to imperfect mankind, his willingness to give his only begotten Son so we could have hope of everlasting life and his Son for his love of mankind enough to be willing to come as that sacrifice.

But what's the truth for me isn't always the truth for anyone else.|`|h11oTtQraa	The message of sacrifice and  forgiveness.|`|qKSn0AVsaa	I reviewed these questions t glean the answer.  1. Jesus started one true Christian religion. So today there must be just one body, or group, of true worshipers of Jehovah God. (John 4:23, 24; Ephesians 4:4, 5) The Bible teaches that only a few people are on the narrow road to life.Matthew 7:13, 14.    2. The Bible foretold that after the death of the apostles, wrong teachings and unchristian practices would slowly come into the Christian congregation. Men would draw away believers to follow them instead of Christ. (Matthew 7:15, 21-23; Acts 20:29, 30) That is why we see so many different religions that claim to be Christian. How can we identify true Christians?    3. The most outstanding mark of true Christians is that they have real love among themselves. (John 13:34, 35) They are not taught to think that they are better than people of other races or skin color. Neither are they taught to hate people from other countries. (Acts 10:34, 35) So they do not share in wars. True Christians treat one another as brothers and sisters.1 John 4:20, 21.    4. Another mark of true religion is that its members have a deep respect for the Bible. They accept it as the Word of God and believe what it says. (John 17:17; 2 Timothy 3:16, 17) They treat God's Word as being more important than human ideas or customs. (Matthew 15:1-3, 7-9) They try to live by the Bible in their everyday life. So they do not preach one thing and then practice another.Titus 1:15, 16.  True Christians love one another, respect the Bible, and preach about God's Kingdom     5. The true religion must also honor God's name. (Matthew 6:9) Jesus made God's name, Jehovah, known to others. True Christians must do the same. (John 17:6, 26; Romans 10:13, 14) Who are the people in your community that tell others about God's name?    6. True Christians must preach about God's Kingdom. Jesus did so. He always talked about the Kingdom. (Luke 8:1) He commanded his disciples to preach this same message in all the earth. (Matthew 24:14; 28:19, 20) True Christians believe that only God's Kingdom will bring true peace and security to this earth.Psalm 146:3-5.    7. Jesus' disciples must be no part of this wicked world. (John 17:16) They do not get involved in the world's political affairs and social controversies. They avoid the harmful conduct, practices, and attitudes that are common in the world. (James 1:27; 4:4) Can you identify a religious group in your community that has these marks of true Christianity?|`|C1IwpPwPaa	Every Religion Claims That It Is The Truth - The Criteria Of The Truth  There are so many sects, cults, religions, philosophies, and movements in the world, all of which claim to be the right way or the only true path to Allah (God). How can one determine which one is correct or if, in fact, all are correct? The method by which the answer can be found is to clear away the superficial differences in the teachings of the various claimants to the ultimate truth, and identify the central object of worship to which they call, directly or indirectly. False religions all have in common one basic concept with regards to Allah. They either claim that all men are gods or that specific men were Allah or that nature is Allah or that Allah is a figment of man's imagination.  Thus, it may be stated that the basic message of false religion is that Allah may be worshipped in the form of His creation. False religion invites man to the worship of creation by calling the creation or some aspect of it God. For example, prophet Jesus invited his followers to worship Allah but those who claim to be his followers today call people to worship Jesus, claiming that he was Allah!  Buddha was a reformer who introduced a number of humanistic principles to the religion of India. He did not claim to be God nor did he suggest to his followers that he be an object of worship. Yet, today most Buddhists who are to be found outside of India have taken him to be God and prostrate to idols made in their perception of his likeness.   By using the principle of identifying the object of worship, false religion becomes very obvious and the contrived nature of their origin clear. As God said in the Our'aan:  " That which you worship besides Him are only names you and your forefathers have invented for which Allah has sent down no authority: The command belongs only to Allah:  He has commanded that you only worship Him; that is the right religion, but most men do not understand ".  (Soorah Yoosuf 12:40)  It may be argued that all religions teach good things so why should it matter which one we follow. The reply is that all false religions teach the greatest evil, the worship of creation. Creation-worship is the greatest sin that man can commit because it contradicts the very purpose of his creation. Man was created to worship Allah alone as Allah has explicitly stated in the the Quran:  " I have only created Jinns and men, that they may worship me "  (Soorah Zaareeyaat 51:56)  Consequently, the worship of creation, which is the essence of idolatry, is the only unforgivable sin. One who dies in this state of idolatry has sealed his fate in the next life. This is not an opinion, but a revealed fact stated by Allah in his final revelation to man.  The following criteria can best serve as a gauge to find out the authenticity of the last revelation (the Quran) as words of God:  1. Rational Teachings: Since our Creator bestowed reason and intellect upon us, it is our duty to use it to distinguish the TRUTH from falsehood. True, undistorted revelation from God must be rational and can be reasoned out by all unbiased minds.   2. Perfection: Since our Creator is all perfect, His revelation must be perfect and accurate, free from mistakes, omissions, interpolations and multiplicity of versions. It should be free from contradictions in its narration.   3. No Myths or Superstitions: True revelation is free from myths or superstitions that degrade the dignity of our Creator or man himself.   4. Scientific: Since our Creator is the Creator of all knowledge, true revelation is scientific and can withstand the challenge of science at all times.   5. Factual Prophecy: Our Creator is the Knower of the past, present and future. Thus His prophecies in His revelation will be fulfilled as prophesied.   6. Inimitable By Man: True revelation is infallible and cannot be imitated by man. God's true revelation is a Living miracle, an open book challenging all mankind to see and prove for themselves its authenticity or veracity.  read these books:  1- Dr. Maurice Bucaille is a french scientist converted to Islam and write this book  "The Bible,The Qur'an & Science" it is amazing book you can download it here http://www.ef7am.com/Files/Books/En/The_...  2-  Dr. Gary Miller is a scientist also converted to islam he wrote this book  "Amazing Quran" you can download it here   http://www.ef7am.com/Files/Books/En/Amaz...  3-  Dr. zakir Naik  wrote this fantastic book it show you the truth   "Concept of GOD in major religions" you can download it here  http://www.ef7am.com/Files/Books/En/GOD_...  http://www.islamreligion.com/ provide live help (online) by chat you can ask any question you want about Islam

qjcrMtdhaa	(It would be nice if you had put all your questions together)      The benefits of a translator, like the work, very on the area that you are in and how capable you are. There are some people, who are capable enough that they can work translating books/documents and that's the only work they ever have to do.     Another aspect that effects benefits is how many languages you can speak and how quickly you are capable of translating documents. It also depends on how accurately you translate as well.     Economy & the area that you choose to work in also have an effect on everything.     This again, is just another thing that you are going to have to research about your area or the area you plan to work in.
EHozsofQaa	These are all adverbs that stand for some noun:    Nous EN avons envie de 10. (means "We would like 10 OF THEM".)   Qu'EN penses-tu? ("What do you think ABOUT IT?"  J'Y ai assiste. ("I attended IT.")    We often use "EN" to stand for objects in the context of grammar (can be both material and non-material) and "Y" to stand for places.
Xsen794Aaa	In the pass compos (perfect past tense):  I did (have done) - J'ai fait.  You did (have done) - Tu as fait.  He/She (It) did (has done) - Il/Elle a fait.  We did (have done) - Nous avons fait.  You (plural or polite) did (have done) - Vous avez fait.  They did (have done) - Ils/Elles ont fait.    In the imparfait (imperfect past tense):  I did (was doing/used to do) - Je faisais.  You did (were doing/ used to do) - Tu faisais.  He/She (It) did (was doing/used to do) - Il/Elle faisait.  We did (were doing/used to do) - Nous faisions.  You (plural or polite) did (were doing/used to do) - Vous faisiez.  They did (were doing/used to do) - Ils/Elles faisaient.    These are just the conjugations for the verb "faire" ("to do").  Unlike English, you can't just add "did" to any verb to get the past tense.  If you were looking for something specific, you should tell us exactly what you want to know because just this isn't going to help you if you don't know French basics.|`|hvIrXa9Gaa	I'm not positive about this because I only speak Spanish for a romance language, but you can't make a verb past tense by adding "did." If they want to change a verb to past tense in the romance languages, they add a different ending onto the end. For example, "llevar" in Spanish is the verb "to wear", to conjugate that verb, you take of the ending "ar" and substitute an alternate ending depending on who is wearing something. If I wanted to say "I did wear" it could either be "Yo llevaba" or "Yo llev", both of which could have "did" incorporated, so it really depends on the context.|`|wlEBP4HEaa	you need to conjugate it.

They feared he was a false prophet soliciting around to other people..Plus, at the time, the Romans had ruled over the territory and they didn't want any type of disputes going on.

Jesus I charge you with breeding your children like animals? what do you say? When you are done working billy gramm with his wife and getting his children and when you are done working them no different then the animals, to give life. You separate them, and they are like the angels in heaven. "After" you are done working them. How does it feel to be a sex God? and servant of the beast? So you sex them up all so you can be worshiped in heaven.      Sense Jesus is God? Jesus I charge you of murder to save the innocent. You call yourself a holy God and righteous God and place yourself like the rest and sin when you need to(suicide). But are really no different then the sinner that steals when he is hungry. Sinner is a sinner. YOu also breed adam and eves kids together and and produce incest. Oh that's right, when you need sin it is ok, but when we sin we are thrown into hell. But for you, sense you are God sin is ok.YOu are a sinner no different then the rest. When you need it, you will sin.  You also tell everyone that they can not be perfect, because no one is. So in a way we are retarded in sin and we have to fall from glory. How is grace good when we are Innocent as in we are all born in sin.     so God you are a retarted sin breeding loving God, that sacrificed his son probovely because it brought you great joy. So work Billy gramm and the children of God. Build his heavenly kingdom up. After God sexes you up for his purpose.... and you are done working. I hope he pays you well when you are done working as sex slaves for heaven.

yMqWvG8naa	Because I believe in the water cycle.  According to the bible all that water came from god.      You can't flood the entire earth to the height of a mountain with just rain because the rain has to come from the water that was already on the earth.    Super Volcanos, on the other hand, function perfectly naturally and have the capacity to occur without supernatural intervention.    EDIT:  No, there isn't a flaw in my thinking.  The flaw is in yours.  If the entire world had flooded to the height of a mountain, that means that the 70% of earth that had been covered with water is now more than 90% of the earth. The only way you can flood the entire earth is by introducing more water that was not previously in the system.  Localized areas can be flooded by moving water from one area to another, but in order to flood the entire planet, you'd need more water than is currently on the planet.    Did you learn about the water cycle in school?|`|B7TFX4wUaa	Several reasons.    There is simply not enough water to cover the land area of the Earth.  This is actually a trivial calculation.  Essentially all of the planet's water is already in the ocean.  It doesn't cover up the land.  The current distribution of animals does not match a single point of origin that is in the Noah story.  The entire ark is ridiculous.  A water covered world would have a different atmosphere, namely it would be much, much more humid, to the point anything with lungs would suffocate.    On the other hand, we know volcanoes are capable of altering climate on a global scale.  Krakatoa dropped the temperature of the entire planet.    A large enough volcano, such as Yellowstone, would be much worse.    Also, to my knowledge no one has proposed a super volcano causing the Permian extinction, which was the only time 90% of life was ever killed.|`|mLccTAhLaa	Your knowledge is clearly restricted.|`|T8X7mrtHaa	I find anything easier to believe if it has creidble, peer-reviewed, scientific facts supporting it.

Even if you melted all the permafrost, ice caps, and glaciers, there would only be an increase of about two percent. This is not nearly enough water to flood the entire surface of the Earth, therefore, there couldn't have been a "universal flood." However, volcanic activity has shown to have a great effect on the atmosphere. The explosion of Mount St. Helens, which occurred in 1980, in particular is good evidence for this. About 230 square miles of surrounding forest were either covered in deposits or completely blown down. A massive cloud of ash was released into the skies, and some of this ash was found as far as the east coast in less than a mere three days. And this is nothing compared to the remains of some ancient volcanoes, such as the Yellowstone Caldera.|`|Ja7v7ZVBaa	One has evidence to support it, the other doesn't. There's no evidence for a global flood. Now there may have been a great flood that caused a lot of devastation in that region of Mesopotamia (the epic of Gilgamesh, I believe, also mentions it), but there's not a shred of proof that would support the claim that water covered the entire planet at the same time. Now you're more than welcome to believe whatever you like, just as long as you know that what you believe is based on faith only, and there's no real, physical evidence you can point to that supports your position.

As you leave your body  you realize something is happening. You hear a sound. . . getting louder and louder. . . screaming . . .weeping. . . wailing. Terror and fear beyond anything you could imagine overtakes you. "This cant be happening!" you scream. Your nostrils are filling with the awful stench of burning souls. Your face ignites from the heat. Flames are now blazing from your eyes, nostrils, ears, mouth  every opening in your body, flames are roaring out. Your body is sizzling and crackling from the flames.   Your body is now madly thrashing and convulsing from the horrible pain. "Why dont I die?", you scream. You begin weeping and gnashing your teeth with the millions. "When will this pain stop?" But you know it will never stop. . .  the darkness is so terrifying, it begins engulfing you. You feel something moving in the darkness. . . something horrible is happening. "No! No! This cant be happening" you scream  as your worm is emerging.   You begin cursing the day you were born. You scream  "Oh God, why didnt you warn me?" but you remember the preacher pleading with you to receive Jesus Christ. You remember reading that gospel tract. You cry  "God dont you care?"  but you remember John 3:16 "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son,. . ." "God is a God of love  He won't allow this", you cry  but you remember John 3:36, ". . . he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him."  And you soon realize, that Jesus Christ was right!  There is a place called hell. AND YOU ARE THERE______ FOREVER.     In heaven there will be no sin, suffering, sorrow, or pain. We will never do anything to displease God. There will be no persecution, division, disunity, or hate. In heaven there will be no quarrels or disagreements. There will be no disappointments. There will be no weeping because there will be nothing to make us sad.   And this is how heaven is described in the bible  Rev 21:16 And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.   It says that this city is foursquare. That means that it is cube shaped. The length, breadth, and height are all equal.   The city measures 12,000 furlongs.   There are 8 furlongs to a mile. So that means that this city is 1,500 miles in length and 1,500 miles in breadth, and 1,500 miles high.   Heaven is foursquare like a cube. You could set one corner of it on the city of New York. Another corner would reach to Denver, Colorado. From New York one side would reach all the way down to Miami. And the other corner would go on down across the Gulf of Mexico. And this city is just as high as it is wide. God said that this city is foursquare.   This city is huge. We are given the outside dimensions of the city but we are not told how high the levels are. If each level was a mile in height, there would be 1,500 levels. If each level was a half of a mile high, there would be 3,000 levels. If each level was ? of a mile high, then there would be 6,000 levels. If the levels were 1/8 of a mile high, then there would be 12,000 levels. We simply do not know. Regardless of the number of levels, There will be plenty of room for all of the saved thru all of the ages. We will not be packed in like a bunch of sardines. There will be elbow room. Jesus is preparing us mansions and not condos.   Now stop and think about the height of it for a minute. Mount Everest is only about 5 miles high. This City is 1,495 miles higher than mount Everest.   We are also given the measurement of the height of the city walls.   Rev 21:17 And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred [and] forty [and] four cubits, [according to] the measure of a man, that is, of the angel.   The city is 1,500 miles high, but the city wall is only 144 cubits.   A cubit is about 18 inches. That works out to about 216 feet.   So the city wall is taller than a 20 story building.   And listen to these building materials for the city wall.   Rev 21:18 And the building of the wall of it was [of] jasper: and the city [was] pure gold, like unto clear glass.   Rev 21:19 And the foundations of the wall of the city [were] garnished with all manner of precious stones.   Just think of how much jasper and precious stones that is. Just to walk around this wall one time you would have to walk 6,000 miles. And this wall is about 20 stories high. If that is the beauty of the city wall, just wonder what the mansions must be like.|`|ch9ipCTKaa	No, because I will always exist, either in heaven or hell, but my faith is that it will be in heaven.|`|mfwDnMupaa	Naw, I just think about how I will have no one to annoy me for the rest of eternity.

Think of it more like the way artwork reflects the character of the artist. You can see the artist's essence shine through.    So if there are intelligent life forms, they may look like Cantina bar customers, but more in harmony with the nature around them. Unless they also sinned in their first generation, conflict and sin wouldn't have entered into their society.    The only reason Jesus was needed to come to the descendants of Adam and Eve was because of an inherited failure (Cain inherited it big time. World's first murderer)    ONE PROBLEM:  How can we tell if they are more intelligent than us? They only universally acceptable test I can think of is:  Does their chocolate taste as good or better than ours?|`|gRObakpZaa	I've wondered about this as well.

Satans job is to cause pain, suffering, sin, etc. So that we will turn away from God. For those who experience pain or a loss, may get upset and think God does it to hurt. Then those people turn away from him and stop believing, or start sinning in their lives. That is what Satan wants, because he is trying to defeat God. He used to be an angel of God, that would come down to earth and report back to God about what was going on, on Earth. Then, Satan wanted to be God. That is when he was thrown down from Heaven. Since then, his job has been to cause a bunch of hate and pain in this world, to try and defeat God, to turn us away from him. That way he will be the winner of Good vs. Evil. This world is full of pain. But if you keep your faith in The Lord, no matter how bad it gets, it always gets better on down the road. You will see, some day!

QVKWVValaa	19 year old Susie just finished her first semester at Harvard Law. She busted her butt all through elementary, junior high and senior high because from the time she was 7 years old, she knew she wanted to be a lawyer. Being a lawyer could have helped her when her Mommy died from brain tumor caused by living under power lines. Since the power company had great lawyers, they were able to argue that Susie's father had no case against the power company and her family got nothing. Her father slipped into depression, lost his good job and now Susie's family struggles to make ends meet.   She struggled with her father in poverty. She avoided going out to parties with her friends so she could be with her father because she was all he had. She never had nice clothes, or got a chance to be popular in school, because she had other things that were important to her.  The only time Susie saw her father happy again was the day she was accepted into Harvard Law School on a full scholarship as long as she maintains a 3.5 GPA. She had to leave her home in Rawlins, Wyoming to go to Harvard, but that was okay. She saw something in her father's eyes she hadn't seen in years. Pride.   He turned his life around a bit after finally realizing he had done such a good job raising her. He started taking better care of himself. Others way this too and he was promoted at work. Susie busted her butt through all her courses and finished with a 4.0 GPA so she could make her father, who was her whole life, proud of her. Her life was going just the way she planned.  Until one night, she met "Nick." Being on her own, Susie made some friends. One night, she went with them to a local pub. "Nick" caught her eye from across the room. They talked, had a wonderful night and exchanged telephone numbers. And promised to call.  "Nick" was a student at a nearby community college, studying urban planning. He was charming and sweet. He even called when he said he would and Susie and "Nick" went out for a nice, romantic dinner. Another date was planned. Another dinner and a walk on the beach. One thing lead to another and they ended up back at Susie's place were intercourse ensued.   Susie was smart. She was on the pill and even used a condom. However, the condom broke. "Nick" assured her he was clean, but she worried anyway. She went to the student health clinic the next day to be tested for STDs. The health clinic did what they could for her and told her to come back in a few more days for results.   The results came back negative. She was fine. She tried to call "Nick" but there was no answer at his number. A few weeks later, she started getting sick, throwing up in the morning, and thought the worst. A home pregnancy test later, a trip to the doctor to be sure and there you have it: Susie is pregnant.  Now, I know of very few pro-lifers who are so hardcore pro-life that they will deny medical abortions if the mother's life is in danger. What I feel that pro-lifers get wrong is the definition of life.   Susie has no complications that will endanger her physical life during the pregnancy. Nothing will kill, or permanently harm her. However, her life is entirely in danger. Everything she has dream of and worked for since she lost her mother at 7 years old is about to end. How is a single mother, living away from her whole family, supposed to maintain a 3.5 GPA while trying to raise a baby by herself?   Oh, some may say she should have thought about that before she had sex. She had. She took precautions. They just failed her. And even more wrong about that way of thinking is placing all the burden for the sex act on Susie. "Nick" was also involved. Why shouldn't "Nick" have thought of that before having sex?   Now, the issue with what is life is bigger than physical, biological life. A friend of mine was in a horrible car accident. He suffered massive brain damage and was declared brain dead. His body was physically alive, but all the things about him that made him who he was were gone forever. He was alive, but had no life.   Life is not breathing and circulating blood. Our lives are all our memories, hopes, dreams and ambitions. Our lives are who we've been, who we are and who we are going to be. Remove those things from a human and all you are left with is a biological machine for pumping blood and processing oxygen.  Susie's life is going to be completely destroyed by having a child. She may lose her scholarship when her grades slip. She is going to let down her father. Everything about who she was, who she is and who she is going to be are going to go away. Her life is over.   No one who is pro-choice is going to look at this story and demand Susie have an abortion. That isn't what being pro-choice is about. It is not our goal to mandate abortions for everyone. All we want is for Susie to have the choice of looking at her life and deciding if she wants to change it to have a baby, or continue on with the hopes and dreams of her life.|`|LUGCxeuNaa	Lower population    All those people below me that say that no one believes that abortion is good are wrong.

I don't see any difference besides that the ant is a k-selected specie, but nothing in the value of the life and yet we kill ants all the time without any care in the world.

I think it is sad.  It truly is a sad thing to see a woman who is in such a bad situation that she is forced to terminate her pregnancy or risk losing her livelihood.    However, I still support a woman's right to choose and I always will.  Reasons being:  pregnancy is tough on a woman's body.  My mom gained over a hundred pounds with me, couldn't "bounce back", and she also got diabetes during pregnancy.  And because she got diabetes, she now can't get bariatric surgery to help lose the weight (because diabetics get baaaad infections).  Some women work for a living and wouldn't be able to support themselves on pregnancy leave.  There are a number of things women half to take just to stay healthy because a fetus robs them of a lot of their nutrients.  Furthermore, a woman shouldn't have to go through pregnancy if they don't want to--especially in cases of risking the mother's life, incest or rape.  There have been cases where a twelve-year-old has gotten pregnant--do you really think she should be forced to keep that baby?  Can you even imagine how much being pregnant would have done to that poor girl's body?    When it comes down to it, a woman should always have the right to do what she wants to her body.    Personally, I consider something a human being once it is able to live outside the womb.  Until then, it's like a parasite.  If the baby is unwanted, it is just sucking away at nutrients and possibly damaging the body and the mother wouldn't get anything in return.    And though I wouldn't have an abortion except in certain circumstances, I think that women should always have a choice.|`|wkmdKFxJaa	Well first, your flawed by saying that "abortion is good", many people oppose it yet recognize the right of a woman to make descions about her own body.  Second your flawed by calling it a baby, killing babies is illigal and generally consitered immoral. They are fetuses as in not able to think anymore than sperm can.  -Third it's unborn as in, why is it any worse to "kill" (if you can call it that) a non-child if your not ready for it than to claim not having sex is killing the potential baby you might create from it.  -It's not seperate from it's mother's body, therefore, the mother has control over her own body.|`|ucuP0boCaa	The controversy is not about whether we will have abortions or not.

We can have it done by certified pros are we can have them done by hacksters. Nobody thinks abortions are good; nobody. Realistic people make realistic decisions about abortions. My reason for being Pro Choice is that I know I should have no say so about what somebody does with their body or the fetus in that body.|`|GEfUTyi8aa	Do you have kids?  Are you a woman?   Do you realize the commitment to having a child and if that child is unwanted its life can sometimes be horrendous?      check this out : A report of child abuse is made ever 3.5 SECONDS! The average time served for crimes against children is 3.5years! Even to go as far as to beating to death a persons own children can land them as little as probation! When are we going to stop this? When are we going to save enough is enough!  60% of people reoffend in just the first thirty six months, 33% of victims repeat the cycle, and 56% of victims end up imprisoned for other crimes, which they hold the abuse accountable for.    Just think about the first two figures if there are 906,000 child abusers (we know there are many more now, but I will use this figure as out of the 3million cases these were the ones which led to a conviction) 33% would repeat the cycle which is 298,980, and 60% of the 906,000 of them reoffend, that is 543,600. Out of the 543,600, 179,388 will go on to repeat the cycle meaning that we now have 1,384,368 abusers and 1,927,968 victims. Now this is just assuming that the abuser has ONE victim.    this is the reason some people should consider abortion.|`|9pc4lzF9aa	It's not ur body so it's none of ur bussiness|`|ZQaeTgNEaa	BECUZ THEY TASTE GUD|`|8btdOy50aa	In my opinion its horrible but im pro choice because peoples beliefs should be free.|`|pUOkWQ1yaa	I think having unwanted children is horrible. A child needs parents - one that loves them. While adoption is a great work around, only 2% of orphans become adopted. In some areas, the suicide rate of aged orphans is 40% while the other majority live lives of drug addiction and prostitution. It's like throwing children into impending doom and not much different as ending their lives - in my mind. I'm an atheist, but my moral structure tries to minimize suffering of ALL conscious life. So while ending a unborn life is bad, throwing a living child away to fend for him/herself is by far worse.     I don't want kids of my own - I want to adopt. But if I was to become pregnant, I hope I would choose to keep the baby. But if another person couldn't find the heart to keep theirs, they should have the choice.    And I do know people whose parents hated them. My X boyfriend was told daily, "Your father saw your birth. Then he left. You are the reason why he left." He used to tell me, "I wish I was aborted." Being hated by your parents or not having any can do such damage to many. It's so sad.    I think we need to instill in our culture not only take responsibility for our actions but WANT to also. Forcing someone to do something becomes counter productive. Convincing them they should make the better choice leads to better success - however, much harder to accomplish.|`|L6Ko87r9aa	Because a baby is not a punishment.|`|MMImKRAgaa	it is an good and acceptable way to kill some one, and not suffer harm|`|U7cJYik4aa	Abortion is nasty but carrying the child of your molester is worse.

Abortion should be seen as an option and a womans right. At the same time I do not feel that abortion should be used as "contraceptive". Personal experience speaking here, think about this. If you are a female, and molested by a family member, end up pregnant, abortion is my only answer. You tell me to keep the child who 1) Could have mutations d/t being inbred  2) How to explain the babies father molested and raped you (the mom) with violence and hate and is probably locked up somewhere (where he should be) listed as  sexual offender.  3) I work in the medical field, and abortion is necessary if the pregnancy is causing serious life threatening complicatioins to the mother  4) Rape, all I can say is rape and molestation, babies are conceived through rape and molestation. Shouldn't these women have a choice in this situation, if you say no, i can guarnatee you have  never been in the situation.|`|Ii4BbhL2aa	What OTHER people fail to realize, is that the abortion issue is the concern of the woman who is pregnant, and her doctor!

I personally think that the mother should have the choice of bringing the child into her life as the child's life can be adversely affected if the mother is forced to give birth. I think that quality of life is very important and the love of a mother for her child has a large bearing on that, if she isn't ready to be a mother, then don't make her as it will affect the child.   I also don't consider the baby to be alive at 3 or so months in the womb, so it can't be murder. In fact it's probably more humane than anything else.|`|9BeUbORtaa	Nobody thinks abortion is "good". Many people, however, think that prohibition is a greater evil.|`|qnt1wAfiaa	There isn't anybody who thinks it good but I think it should be a personal matter between a woman and her doctor.

I'd like to ask when a functioning brain capable of perception and memory develops. birth is too late, and conception is too early. somewhere around 10 weeks might be best. one does have to draw the line somewhere, but drawing the line in a place that has (to me) no bearing on reality is hardly the best solution. also I think there should be provisions for late-term abortion if the mother's life is at risk from the pregnancy.|`|q9C46Wuqaa	I am Pro-Life100%    Abortion is not good.

ADD: If you are really willing to see the other side of the issue, stop calling it murdering an unborn child and learn about exactly what that child is in the first trimester.    Most pro-choice people still expect women to make up their mind within the first trimester, so don't fall for the propaganda pictures from anti-choice websites.|`|BABcrdMKaa	I didnt say it was good, I said choice was good    choice + free speech = important    comprende?|`|g0lKlQGnaa	Abortion is about convenience, thats it ultimately    That's why those pro abortionists fight over semantics because it makes their task seem less brutal, and create such nice sounding terms as "pro choice", even though in reality, it is the same    Especially the "ball of cells" argument.  When you dehumanize something, it makes it easier to deal with and judge it as a "non human being".  WE ourselves are simply "balls of cells" just more developed than a fetus|`|YOWnMp0Xaa	you're asking a manipulative question.    No one ever said abortion was "good". Pro choice people simply say it should be "accepted".    Why? Well we don't believe that a human fetus in it's early stages is alive (scientifically backed up - no neural activity, therefore no life). And christians can''t back up their views on the matter, because all they can cite is "Thou Shalt Not kill", but can't offer an explanation as to how aborting a fetus is "killing"    EDIT:  If you don't mind, I'm going to go ahead and address each of your arguments and explain where your fallacies lie.    1) FROM THE MOMENT A BABY IS CONCEIVED, ITS A SEPARATE BEING. WHY I KNOW THIS?  2)IF IT WAS PART OF THE MOTHERS BODY, THE MOTHER WOULD HAVE 4 ARMS, 4 LEGS, 4 EYES, 2 MOUTHS, AND SO ON. IF THE BABY IS A BOY, SHE HAS BOY PARTS TOO??    Borderline nonsensical. How is it that a lump of congregative cells must have a transformative effect on the rest of the mother's body? This is a completely unscientific postulation.    3)WE DON'T HAVE ZYGOTE SHOWERS. WE HAVE BABY SHOWERS PEOPLE. WE SAY THIS EVEN BEFORE A BABY IS BORN.    Semantics do not lend credence to any arguments, even this one. When a woman has a "hen's night" before she gets married, are there actual hens present?    4) A BABY WHO IS STILL IN THE WOMB HAS POTENTIAL LIFE. SO, IF IT "ISN'T ALIVE" WHY DO WE HAVE TO KILL IT?    Potential life does not equal life. You could easily argue that every sperm is potential life, yet God seemed to find no problem in designing a reproductive system that wastes several million of the things everytime an ejaculation occurs.    5) ITS WRONG! ITS KILLING ONE OF GODS PRECIOUS BEINGS!    Rhetorical argument. Does not support your viewpoint with any real logic.|`|fc711dee0348a3fa4c47b0371bd359d5aa	Well, when someone has an abortion they are not in fact killing an unborn child.  They are killing a fetus.  A potential child.  Of all implanted fetuses only 50% make it, if we look at it your way then children are dying by the dozen and god is the supreme abortionist.  Pregnancy (no matter what anyone says) is still a health risk, so I think the woman deserves to choose what she wants to do with her body.  It really is that simple.  If she doesn't want a child or feels she doesn't want to be a mother or feels she can't she is going to find a way to terminate the pregnancy whether it's legal or not.  The fact that it is not illegal says by law it is just a simple medical procedure, no Murder like some would like to think it is.      Adoption as an option?  There are already more children waiting for adoption then there is people wanting to adopt.      Does a child deserve a quality of life?  yes.  Well tell that to the child who's mother is a crack head and can't afford nor is she interested in feeding her.|`|IaU6PS23aa	If the mother does not want the baby, why should she be required to keep it. I am sure you are going to say well what about adoption, and besides, abortion is murder, but that entirely depends upon a soul, because otherwise there is no difference between killing an animal and a baby. When exactly does the soul come into play? Is it when the baby is conceived? If that is the case, then when the zygote splits into two does each baby have half a soul? If it is at birth, then you should not care about abortion. The mother should make the choice of the child, maybe she does not want it to spend time in an orphanage, or maybe (as selfish as this sounds) the mother does not want to deal with pregnancy. A baby should be conceived in love, and it should not be an accident or a result of rape.

The Bible is about lessons learned and guidance down the right path. The story of Mary is just that, her story. While she played a huge part in Jesus' life (most mothers usually do) the most important person for that era was Jesus. He is the one that is focused on the most.

Your question shows a great deal of insensitivity.|`|ikDoMPgbaa	Political Correctness is all about lies.    Everyone and everything is equal.    Nice sentiment. Too bad it isn't true.|`|38vza5Gxaa	answer: because you're lying when you say it.  Check the stats for Africa.  Its a straight disease there and its pandemic (look it up)    using the "logic" of others that it's G-d's punishment on gays = G-d must REALLY love lesbians. They're among one of the groups that is the least likely to contract HIV|`|YOWnMp0Xaa	Cause the statement is a load of bollocks?    Straight people get AIDS. Therefore it is not a "gay" disease.    EDIT:    Hellooo - your logic is idiotic. A person's sexual orientation does not make them more succeptible to AIDS. All you can say is that anal sex is more likely to put someone at risk, due to greater chance of blood transmission. For this reason, it is highly unlikely lesbians could contract it.   And then there are cases of people catching it through blood transfusions and dirty drug needles, neither of which are dependent on the subject being gay.|`|I6D7xdcVaa	AIDS infects a lot fewer gays then it does people in Africa. Gays just don't use protection as much so they can catch the disease easier. If less heterosexuals were paranoid about getting knocked up then the numbers would even out.|`|6173ede5e3ea0a8b44522ccd89de7fe0aa	I believe that AIDS is a punishment from God on our sexually immoral society. If everyone in the world stayed faithful to their spouses and never used drugs, there would be no AIDS. The fact that innocent people are infected by the blood of the guilty just shows how other people's sins affect others. No man is an island.|`|jR8mclWIaa	I doubt that all the babies in Africa that are born with AIDS are gay.|`|uxvskU7Xaa	gays are not the only people to get aids so its not a "gay" disease|`|z74a7wvlaa	You did not qualify your answer. Other people have AIDS too but it is the gay community that popularize the disease. So it became their  symbol.|`|AA11297267	And which "fact" are you repeating?    The *fact* that AIDS has affected more heterosexuals than homosexuals world-wide?  Or the nonsense you made up about it being a "gay" disease?    Yes, ignorance and making things up that aren't true -- those are often signs of bigotry.  You'd rather make statements that match your bigoted ideas than find out facts.    Peace.|`|s6stLtvLaa	Because it isn't a gay disease.  I have HIV and I have a husband and a son.  I have two female friends who have HIV and are both happily married.  You are not repeating a fact, you are merly repeating something that is someones OPINION.  You say you are not anti gay, but when you go around saying AIDS is a gay disease it makes you anti-gay.  You need to read up on your statistics.
AA11047076	Judaism is very clear in the subject- you are only Jewish if your mother is Jewish or if you have converted to Judaism.  On top of that, your friend was raised Catholic- thus even if his mother was Jewish he would be considered outside of the community and not treated as a Jew because he is following another religion- in the case of a person with a Jewish mother following another religion all it means is that they don't have to comvert to come back to judaism, just drop the other religion!|`|FI916ISFaa	Ethnically he is half Jewish (if his father was ethnically Jewish) .  Religiously he is not Jewish.  Whether a person is jewish or not is determined by the person's mother.|`|4807230affa1ab91b912bc7830a4b01baa	Your friend is correct. There is no such thing as being half Jewish. Either you are Jewish or you are not. To be Jewish requires either your mother being Jewish or converting to Judaism.|`|Tvc6Tmz5aa	Jewish is  both a ethnic group and a religion. You can be one without being the other ( Example: Sammy Davis Jr.)|`|teeQmWsBaa	He is right about the mother statement. He is genetically half Jewish but, not culturally.|`|49c07573b2ef8b7f4c512a10de7d7febaa	Being Jewish is passed through the mother by Jewish law.    As far as being Jewish is concerned, to Jews, there's no such thing as "half-Jewish."  It's a yes-or-no question - either your mother was Jewish or she wasn't.  The father's background is not considered.  In your friend's case, since he was not born to a Jewish woman, he is not considered Jewish by halacha.    The only other way to become Jewish is to convert; the children born to a female Jewish convert are considered to be Jewish because THEY are born to a Jewish mother.|`|AA11796124	>    It all depends on how "Jewish" is being defined here. The term "Jewish" refers to both the ethnicity of the Jewish people as well as the religion itself.    One is ethnically Jewish if his/her parents are ethnic Jews.  and/or  the parents are part of the Jewish religion.    If he says he's not Jewish, and given the fact he's Catholic, he probably means he isn't Jewish in terms of religion.    >    Let's say, for the sake of argument, that his father is ethnically Jewish and his mother is not. That would make him, ethnically speaking, half Jewish.    Well, I hope you're not too confused!|`|QF4W5aYRaa	And this has to do with what???|`|PClzVRSEaa	While he can choose to be Jewish, he is right.  In the Jewish religion, affiliation is carried by the mother.|`|28216207e17752f6c782dd9a28e07f1faa	He's right. In the Jewish tradition, the line of heritage is matrilinial. Though in strictest anthropological terms, there is no such thing as a "Jewish race."

If you accept the family and they accept you, neither  one should need any more help.|`|d529cebfe13576f3ddee3e55b4cd08ffaa	Assuming he genetically IS Jewish...perhaps he should take up an interest in the history and details of the culture. Not the bad stuff, but interesting things. Especially if he can trace some of his own family back generations ago and there whereabouts. It might help him to feel some pride in where he gets his features and who from.|`|qRue8Xdraa	Tell him, it can get worse?

It means nothing   'tis the mind that makes the body rich.|`|QF4W5aYRaa	I left here once, then came back, the rest of the world is whacked, I like it up north, no one but God, wolves, and me. We are ALL unique, God made us that way. Sorry about the Catholic part, I'm a recovering one of those myself. My recommendation, is to get over that part, loose the "religion", and get right with God by a close, personal "relationship" with Jesus Christ. Being Catholic, your friend more than likely never read the Bible. Start with Romans & Ephesians, read, study, and learn who he is in Christ, and what Jesus really did for him on the cross. Let him know, that when he goes to "other" churches, Jesus is not still on the cross, He does indeed sit at the right hand of The Father. There are many more issues to share on that topic, bottom lone, God loves him just as he is, that's the way God made him, and God NEVER makes a mistake, regardless of what we think. That's just the way it is.|`|qXh2FZHEaa	He just needs to learn that he is special  He was made in Christs image   He needs to learn how to love himself|`|oy9gOMTuaa	it is relative to who or what he is afraid might see him as he was made.  If it is women then he should know that every woman's taste is different and for every one man there is a woman that absolutely adores the way you look.  There are over 6 billion people in the world there has to be someone for everyone.  I'm latino and could be characterized as jewish, but some girls digge the appearance and you really caint help your appearance and time is too precious to be wasted sulking over what you could look like.  Friends, Family, and Others should accept you for what you could contribute to the world rather than if your face is presentable.|`|27kOfUbZaa	i think you should just tell him that it realy doesnt matter how he looks i mean there are so many people that can make someone feel ugly when they are not and that can bring out the worst in people...so just tell him that reguardless of how he looks he should be proud and happy for himself because thats how he is and everyone has something that they can be ashamed of but he doesnt have to be upset about it because thats him i mean he cant change how he is so yeah just tell him that it doesnt metter what other people think about him and that he needs to stop thinking bad of himself because its just going to make him more upset!!|`|Vf4g4xwnaa	Someone that is ashamed of the way they look isn't right. They need to be proud of their outer appearance and to remember that it really is what's on the inside that counts. Remind this person that you were born with this body but you weren't born to make it look good. You were born to serve the true God that this person believes in.

Spiritually, there is nothing you can do to change your hair color...  Although you can always pray really hard and see what happens.    Nutritionally, malnourishment sometimes causes dark hair to turn orange-ish, but it also causes fine body hair called Lanugo, and a distended stomach.  In the long run, it can lead to sterility and death, so I'd say don't go down that road.    If you really want orange hair, you can try dyeing it (I recommend clairol perfect 10, but the shade will be different depending on your current shade.      If you want a more natural approach, buy some henna (Colora 100% vegetable in Red Sunset will make your hair briliantly, luxuriously orange-red... GORGEOUS).  Just make sure it's green and smells like grass clippings.  Shampoo your hair but don't condition it.  Mix it with 1 T. olive oil, one egg, cheap black tea, and a couple drops each of lemon juice and tea tree oil.  Apply it to your hair for a couple of hours and then rinse it out with conditioner.

LJkPRqN0aa	i seem to be having the same issue you are having, cept im actually christian and this girl keeps saying im not. my religious background is Mormon, and yes we are christian. yet others dont think we are (even though we are) and think they should take it upon themselves to take us away from our "brainwash ways" and save us from our "cult" which i find very offensive and rude. for someone to tell me that what i have learned and been taught all my life is false doctorine and that i need to get out now and be a christian is completely not loving and not christ-like..no matter how many times i have told not just this girl but others that have attacked me for my beliefs they just tell me im wrong, and that the Christ i worship as my savior is not the same Christ as the "Christian christ" its rediculous... so i totally understand where you are coming from. i have always been taught that what i believe is the truth for ME and i should respect others beliefs but it does make it hard when i am badgered to not believe what i have believed and KNOWN my entire life i hope you find happiness in your life and may you be blessed|`|luwBPdE8aa	I am looking for people that are not content; people that want something they don't have.

If you know that a house is soon going to blow up (explode) and burn to ashes, wouldn't you tell the people in that house to get out of the house?

You may think Christians are wrong, and you have the right to think so, but you should try to see their motives.

FsX5VoXKaa	God sees the believer today the same way He sees Jesus at His right hand.     1 John 4:17 As He is, so are we in this world.       Is Christ perfect? So are we. Where? In Heaven in the future?  No, but now, in this earth we live in.     "but i still sin! doesnt God see that?"     Dearly Beloved, if Christ who had no sin, was judged on the cross as if He was the world's greatest sinner, in the same way you who is unrighteous, will be regarded as if you are righteous.     Thats what Christ came to do. His name is Yeshua, Saviour..      Acts 13:39  And through Him, everyone who believes is justified from all things, even those that could not be justified while under the law.      Breakdown of the phrase:  .. "through Him(Jesus)"  ..  "everyone(including you and i)" .. "who believes ( believe what?  believes that Jesus is Yeshua, who came to die for sins)" ... "is justified from all things, even those that could not be justified while under the law."          I have used this reference before, ill use it again.  Even in the Old covenant under the 10 commandments, there is temporary "cover up" of sins...  What the sinner has to do is to bring a lamb to the priest, and the priest examines the lamb and not the sinner. Many people still think when we go to God, we examine ourselves. We should never do that. Why? God knows why you are there. You have sinned. Rather, He wants you to focus on Jesus, the true lamb.      So what happens after examining the lamb is that the sinner places his hand on the head of the lamb, in a transfer of righteousness from the lamb to the sinner, and the sins of the sinner to the lamb.. and the lamb is either set loose into the wilderness, so symbolize as far as the lamb is from the sinner, so is his sin separated from him, or the lamb is slaughtered in front of the sinner, so show him that his sins have been put to death.          Our Lamb, Jesus, did this very same thing. He took our sins and God's wrath fell on Him, and paid once, for all the world, and for all the sins.. for the believer to walk free.         I preached myself happy..  haha...|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	At judgment, you will be one of two places.  You will be either before the throne of God, at the white throne judgment (this is for those who did not repent of their sins and did not accept Jesus as savior) or you will be before the judgment seat of Christ.    Those before God at the white throne judgment will be judged out of the books (the bible says this) of their deeds, but there will only be one consequence, and that will be condemnation.  This is because they denied Christ.    Those at the throne of Christ will be given rewards for what they did on earth for the kingdom of Jesus, these are all believers in Christ.|`|A01w1dHqaa	He doesn't.

The truth is that death brings IMMEDIATE heaven or hell, depending ONLY on whether you believed the truth about Jesus in this life or not.

It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation.     The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead.

If you ever decide that you want to learn more about Judaism than what you've learned up to this point, that's cool too! Orthodoxy is a beautiful tradition, and I have a lot of respect for its adherents, but it's not for everyone. If you're up for some studying, the other branches of Judaism -- Reform, Conservative, Reconstructionist, etc -- might be of more interest to you than Orthodoxy.    Also, don't worry about not coming across as Jewish. I like trucks. I like country music. And yes, I too am politically conservative. There is a definite tendency for Jews to gravitate towards the left, but you'll find diversity in political viewpoints in Judaism. There are also plenty of Jews with "light" features, as we're not really a race.    Oh, one more thing. If you ever decide to investigate Judaism further, you don't ever have to worry about being pressured to convert. That's not something we do. :-)    Hope this helps!|`|gBoUrlrKaa	I have British heritage and I can't stand how they talk.    You don't have to feel connected to what you are.|`|ucuP0boCaa	You are not a racist.|`|9onFys4baa	Have you had your penis handled and mutilated by a bearded man yet. This may explain why you can't connect with your faith.|`|79f8c9e8b5ba6a3ba210d3fbac9f9681aa	free will or shamefullness or ignorance or you simply feel no emotional link to judaism because you are not raised that way......|`|hceNM6Uxaa	I guess I'm curious about why you're asking.  There's no obligation to feel connected to Judaism or Jewish heritage!      There are Jews who drive trucks (and taxis, and planes, and trains); there are Jews who are liberal, Jews who are left-wing, Jews that are right-wing, Jews that are conservative.  You might be right that the balance among Jews is a bit more liberal and left-wing than among the rest of the population, but there's still a big spread.      Jews in every country are patriotic.  Our prayers on shabbat all include prayers for the rulers of the state we're living in.    If you want to explore any of your Jewish heritage, I think you'd find it interesting, but if you're not interested, it's fine - just leave it!|`|q9075Yawaa	you are human, what else matters.  it is up to you to decide how you want to live,  not your ancestry|`|UIJorsD7aa	You are Jewish if your mother is Jewish or if you convert to Judaism.  According to this definition, you are not Jewish, which explains why you feel no affinity with Judaism.|`|q9C46Wuqaa	Maybe because your not a Jew... If you were not brought up in the Judaic religion than you not considered a Jew.|`|LQQAQDkIaa	If you didn't grow up with religious Jews, you can't identify with them. That is one thing about the melting pot culture we have. It is supposed to make us feel American, and not "foreign"|`|8rbQBaIeaa	Your beliefs sound as if you are Christian and that bothers you. In a way you want to honor your heritage and part of that is to follow Judaism. It sounds as if you are fighting with yourself, yet your heart is with the Christian belief. I've said this over and over. Just pray. Ask God to guide you in your decisions. Also since mom is of  Christian beliefs, hopefully you guys communicate well   enough that you could freely talk about your feelings. It doesn't matter at this point that you say you are not extremely religious. You are who you are. Some Christians can get up and praise the Lord to the highest heavens, go to church every day twice on Sunday and thats their personalities. Your personality sounds more conservative and thats absolutely o.k.  Not all of us was made to be....shout'n and a danc'n   yet...we all have the same goals...we love God...we Believe in God and ya know...lots of times actions speak louder than words

AA10471892	The Israelites were a stiff-necked, rebellious and faithless people, and as such, were given those commandments as a witness against them to prove their true natures.    Deuteronomy 31:26 ?Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a witness against thee.  27 ?For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the LORD; and how much more after my death?    They were commanded not to have other gods because they were prone to do so.  They were commanded not to have idols, because they were prone to do so.  Need I go on?    The commandments do not prove a person to be good; they prove a person to be sinful.    .|`|CBUPymktaa	actually its pretty deep ..

God wasn't correcting wrong. The Ten Commandments were part of a covenant between God and the nation of Israel.    In the covenant, the Israelites agreed to follow God's laws, and in return God promised that Israel would be His treasured people among the nations of the world, and would inhabit the land of Canaan just like God originally promised Abraham, and through them all nations would be blessed.    What follows in the rest of Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy are the rest of the rules for the covenant. God gave Israel these laws so that other nations would see the purity and wisdom of Israel, and would come to praise Israel's God for making them a wise, great, holy people.|`|z4FZlLxyaa	good question! i dont know! let me know when u find out|`|9btru19waa	Exd 34:28 Moses was up on the mountain with the LORD forty days and forty nights. In all that time he neither ate nor drank. At that time he wrote the terms of the covenant--the Ten Commandments--on the stone tablets.         Rom 3:19 Obviously, the law applies to those to whom it was given, for its purpose is to keep people from having excuses and to bring the entire world into judgment before God.         Rom 3:20 For no one can ever be made right in God's sight by doing what his law commands. For the more we know God's law, the clearer it becomes that we aren't obeying it.         Rom 3:21 But now God has shown us a different way of being right in his sight--not by obeying the law but by the way promised in the Scriptures long ago.         Rom 3:22 We are made right in God's sight when we trust in Jesus Christ to take away our sins. And we all can be saved in this same way, no matter who we are or what we have done.         Rom 3:23 For all have sinned; all fall short of God's glorious standard.         Rom 3:24 Yet now God in his gracious kindness declares us not guilty. He has done this through Christ Jesus, who has freed us by taking away our sins.         Rom 3:25 For God sent Jesus to take the punishment for our sins and to satisfy God's anger against us. We are made right with God when we believe that Jesus shed his blood, sacrificing his life for us. God was being entirely fair and just when he did not punish those who sinned in former times.         Rom 3:26 And he is entirely fair and just in this present time when he declares sinners to be right in his sight because they believe in Jesus.         Rom 3:27 Can we boast, then, that we have done anything to be accepted by God? No, because our acquittal is not based on our good deeds. It is based on our faith.         Rom 3:28 So we are made right with God through faith and not by obeying the law.         Rom 3:29 After all, God is not the God of the Jews only, is he? Isn't he also the God of the Gentiles? Of course he is.         Rom 3:30 There is only one God, and there is only one way of being accepted by him. He makes people right with himself only by faith, whether they are Jews or Gentiles.         Rom 3:31 Well then, if we emphasize faith, does this mean that we can forget about the law? Of course not! In fact, only when we have faith do we truly fulfill the law.|`|Wz3OzkmKaa	Exodus chapters 19-20  he didn't exactly give the Israelites the 10 commandments he gave it to Moses but whatever. Haha.        Wikianswers - The Ten Commandments represent the law given by God to his people by way of Moses. In addition to defining God's idea of perfection, they provide a moral code for governing our lives. Most of us believe we are able to keep these commandments, but the truth is-none of us can. God's standards are so high, they are impossible to perfectly meet.|`|UwzsgxU6aa	I truly think that God the creator was establishing a community in which God was honored and that the duties towards our neighbours were being defined.  Jesus comes along later and answers the question from one of the teachers of the law who came and heard them debating. Noticing that Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked him, "Of all the commandments, which is the most important?" "The most important one," answered Jesus, "is this: 'Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one. Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.' (NIV, Mark 12:28-30) and then he added The second is this, 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no other commandment greater than these. (NRSV, Mark 12:31)|`|JTu1cLkYaa	The Israelites had been living among the Egyptians for generations and had incorporated many of the Egyptian beliefs into their lives.

Rabbinic literature holds that the Ten Statements in fact contain 14 or 15 distinct instructions;      The first three commandments govern the relationship between God and humans, the fourth through eighth govern public relationships between people, and the last two govern private thoughts.

The monastic tradition from Christianity, Hinduism, and Buddhism religions is echoed in the strict code by which the Jedi live. The Jedi do not seek after material possessions.   Both Obi-Wan and Yoda spent considerable time living as hermits.

AA10754000	First of all, as always, I am not a lawyer.    Whether the clerk could hold your son and whether the police can arrest him are different matters.  Can the clerk lock him in the store trying to get information. I doubt it, but I'm not a lawyer, and I'm not particularly confident on this issue. Because on the flip side, if your son did not give the shopkeeper the name, and would not give his name, and left, and then the police had to track down your son, you have to figure there would be further penalties for that.    Can your son be arrested for obstruction of justice in this case? I expect so. Why not? Because he's a minor? That doesn't make you immune from the law, it just can change the penalties if you are found guilty. I guess the only question I'd ask is what the crime was. If no crime was committed, then most of this doesn't make any sense. That is, why do the police want/need to speak to the other boy? Arguing in a store is not a crime that would have the police trying to track down this other boy...|`|AA10726551	I would talk to an attorney.

AA12180795	To  be forgiven and recieve salvation, you must do much more that get baptised.   1)If you ask for forgiveness in a sincer meaning and accpect Jesus, yes your sins will be forgiven according to Roman 10:9.  2)You can't do enough good to recieve salvation. Thus you can do bad enough to lose salvation. Only the act of Roman 10:9 gets you salvation. I could kill one person a day and SINCERELY apologize and be forgiven. However, if I killed one everyday, my apology must not be sincere. I hope you understood that. I couldnt quite get it in the right words.  3)No matter the sin, you can be forgiven. Now there are some spectulations that suicide can not be forgiven. The bible makes no reference to that, so it's only a logical theory. But in an essence, my life bag can be full of sins, and as long as I sincerely pray for repentence, it will be forgiven.

Histria  Fundado por Josemara Escriv de Balaguer em 2 de Outubro de 1928 em Madrid, na Espanha. Em 14 de Fevereiro de 1930, o seu fundador compreendeu que a institui??o tambm deveria desenvolver o seu apostolado entre as mulheres, vindo, desta a forma a ser fundada, em 14 de Fevereiro de 1943, a Sociedade Sacerdotal da Santa Cruz, inseparavelmente unida ao Opus Dei.    Aprovado definitivamente pela Santa S em 16 de Junho de 1950, no dia 28 de Novembro de 1982 foi erigido como uma Prelazia pessoal, assim declarado pelo Papa Jo?o Paulo II  conforme o Cdigo de Direito Can?nico , que tem como finalidade contribuir para a miss?o evangelizadora da Igreja.     poca do falecimento do seu fundador, em 1975, a institui??o j se estendia pelos cinco continentes, contando com mais de 60.000 membros de 80 nacionalidades.    Incio em Portugal e no Brasil  O Fundador do Opus Dei, foi pela primeira vez a Portugal em 5 de Fevereiro de 1945, a convite da Irm? Lcia, uma das videntes de Ftima, que conhecera em Tuy.    Essa viagem, acompanhado pelo Bispo de Tuy, e viagens subsequentes, permitiram-lhe contactar com o Cardeal Patriarca de Lisboa, com os bispos de Braga, Porto, Coimbra e Leiria e decidir o come?o do apostolado do Opus Dei no pas. Um ano depois chegavam a Coimbra vrios membros do Opus Dei em estudos de ps-gradua??o, montando uma residncia universitria nessa cidade. Posteriormente seria a vez do Porto (1948) e Lisboa (1951).    O trabalho apostlico do Opus Dei no Brasil teve incio em 1957, em Marlia (SP), devido ao interesse e  prolongada insistncia do ent?o bispo dessa diocese, D. Hugo Bressane de Arajo. Os primeiros membros do Opus Dei que chegaram em Marlia foram: Pe. Jaime Espinosa Anta, licenciado em medicina e doutor em direito can?nico, o mdico recm-formado Jos Lus Alonso Nieto, e o advogado Flix Ruiz Alonso.    Caractersticas  O Opus Dei tem como lema "encontrar Deus no trabalho e na vida cotidiana". Procura a santifica??o de cada crist?o no meio do mundo, atravs do exerccio profissional cotidiano e no cumprimento dos deveres pessoais, familiares e sociais de cada um, de maneira a que cada indivduo se torne um fermento de intensa vida crist? em todos os ambientes em que se encontre inserido.    Para essa finalidade a Prelatura proporciona os meios de forma??o espiritual e atendimento pastoral aos prprios fiis e tambm a muitas outras pessoas. Atravs desse atendimento pastoral, as pessoas s?o estimuladas a colocar em prtica os ensinamentos do Evangelho, mediante o exerccio das virtudes crist?s e a santifica??o do trabalho. Isto significa, para os fiis da Prelatura, trabalhar segundo o esprito de Jesus Cristo: realizar as prprias tarefas com perfei??o, como forma de dar glria a Deus e servir aos outros, e, deste modo, contribuir para santificar o mundo, tornando presente o esprito do Evangelho em todas as actividades e realidades temporais.    Os fiis da Prelatura realizam pessoalmente a sua tarefa evangelizadora nos vrios ambitos da sociedade em que est?o inseridos. Por conseguinte, o trabalho que levam a cabo n?o se limita a um campo especfico, como a educa??o, o cuidado de doentes ou a ajuda a deficientes. A Prelatura prop?e-se recordar que todos os crist?os, seja qual for a actividade secular a que se dediquem, devem cooperar na solu??o crist? dos problemas da sociedade e dar testemunho constante da sua f.    Atualmente, a sede da Prelazia do Opus Dei encontra-se em Roma, onde est a Igreja do Prelado, sob a dire??o do Bispo Dom Javier Echevarra.    Vida Diria  O crist?o est chamado a procurar a santidade, isto , a identifica??o com Jesus Cristo, atravs das circunstancias da sua vida e das atividades em que se ocupa. Segundo o fundador do Opus Dei: "A vida corrente pode ser santa e plena de Deus; o Senhor chama-nos a santificar as ocupa??es habituais, porque tambm nelas se encontra a perfei??o do crist?o"( Cristo que passa, 2a. ed., Quadrante, S?o Paulo,n 148). Portanto, todas as virtudes s?o importantes para o crist?o: a f, a esperan?a e a caridade, apoiadas nas virtudes humanas: como a generosidade, a laboriosidade, a justi?a, a lealdade, a alegria, a sinceridade, etc.  pelo exerccio das virtudes que o crist?o vai-se configurando com Jesus Cristo.    Outra conseqncia do valor santificador da vida corrente  a transcendncia das coisas pequenas que preenchem a existncia de um crist?o comum. "A santidade grande est em cumprir os deveres pequenos de cada instante" (Caminho, Quadrante, S?o Paulo, n. 817), ensinava S?o Josemaria Escriv. S?o coisas pequenas, por exemplo, os detalhes de servi?o, de boa educa??o, de respeito aos outros, de ordem material, de pontualidade, etc.: quando se vivem por amor de Deus, esses detalhes n?o s?o de pouca relevancia para a vida crist?.    Dentre as realidades quotidianas sobre as quais um crist?o corrente deve edificar a sua santifica??o e s quais deve dar, portanto, uma dimens?o crist?, encontram-se -- para a maioria das pessoas -- o matrim?nio e a famlia. "Para um crist?o, o matrim?nio n?o  uma simples institui??o social, e menos ainda um remdio para as fraquezas humanas:  uma autntica voca??o sobrenatural(...) Os casados est?o chamados a santificar o seu matrim?nio e a santificar-se a si prprios nessas uni?o (...). A vida familiar, as rela??es conjugais, o cuidado e a educa??o dos filhos, o esfor?o necessrio para manter a famlia,|`|7a5628614f96282f412b8ec2dab17b21aa	O Opus Dei, Obra de Deus, tem a imagem de ser uma prelazia catlica boa, pois assim divulga sua imagem, vetando qualquer opini?o negativa. Na verdade o Opus Dei cria uma classe de seguidores chamados numerrios dos quais abusa financeiramente e os faz trabalhar como escravos, separando-os do convvio social com as pessoas que n?o s?o do Opus Dei. Quem tem um parente que mora em um centro do Opus Dei precisa saber que essa pessoa est sofrendo abusos mentais, fsicos, morais e financeiros!

Mas deixe-me responder a sua pergunta afinal:  Durante a Segunda Guerra Mundial (1939-1945) os pases ocupados pela Alemanha foram: a Pol?nia, a Fran?a (metade dela, a outra ficou sob um governo colaboracionista), a Blgica, a Holanda. O norte da Itlia (depois de 42 ou 43 se n?o me engano). A Grcia e os pases que compunham a antiga Iugoslvia,bem como a Albania (onde os alem?es foram em auxlio aos seus aliados italianos) e, finalmente... tcham!Tcham!Tcham.... a Uni?o Sovitica, especificamente a parte sul, onde hoje temos a Ucrania, chegando at onde hoje se encontra no mapa a cidade de Volgogrado (antiga Stalingrado), foi l, na Rssia, que come?ou o incio da derrocada alem? na Segunda Guerra Mundial.

668316a1f72794486828026e72315b93aa	You know.. i actually took time answering your physics question... now for your psychics question ... Most consider them frauds or crazy (like christian evangelists on tv that think they heal people).. My old religion claimed that they were people led by demons... yeah..  when "boo" got old, so did my religion.. Jehovah's Witnesses.. they aren't into the hocus pocus that alot of religions are into... but they believe in demons and fear of god.. anywho.. my perception.. a mix.. although i think it's all just good fun and games.. though i had a good friend who claimed to be psychic.. swore they'd give me a reading some day.. but never did.. eh..|`|338bfdec602da3d0e810e79c55f5a351aa	Any "psychic" lends himself to similar tests. If you were really able to talk to the dead (like that hack with a syndicated TV show), then you should be able to have some sort of proof of this. It would stand to reason that if you were capable of talking to somebody's dead mother, you could tell that person all sorts of intimate details about him or her without said person's constant feedback (unless the dead really like playing 20 questions). Still, these psychics seem to be undergoing a current wave of popularity.     I talk to a lot of people who seem to have more vague beliefs in magic or psychic powers. What's interesting is that these people seem rather uninterested in pinpointing the exact nature of these powers. If I believed that people existed with the ability to communicate telepathy, I would certainly be trying to figure out how it worked! It would be among the most important discoveries in human history.|`|b0bd7cf81b87c8404900e3790467d2efaa	I think that society, for the most part, views them as quacks.

Not all spirits have equal access to some mysteries, since their knowledge depends on the extent of their evolution.  Ordinary spirits, in fact, don't know any more than the average human being, and sometimes even less.  There are even spirits, just as there are men and women, who presume to know more than they actually do.  There are also those who concoct elaborate theories to support their own ideas, which they construe to be the truth.  Finally, there are highly evolved spirits, completely free from matter and immune to earthly conceptions and prejudices.  We are aware, however that less honest spirits won't hesitate to deceive others by taking names that don't belong to them, all in an attempt to impose their Utopian ideas.  As a result, every new piece of information received by spirits, especially in topics that go beyond moral teachings, should be taken as an individual expression, subject to verification and authenticity.  Such revelations should be considered (until otherwise proven) the personal opinions of this or that spirit, making it UNWISE  FOR US TO ACCEPT THEM AND SPREAD THEM THOUGHTLESSLY AS ABSOLUTE TRUTHS.    "What is received freely, should be given freely"|`|AA11192489	By and large, my opinion is that they are not only fake, they are deceitful.

e0d71f1cc0ece24998336831f3062254aa	This is very possible.  Our parents shape our perspective on life. If we grew up constantly being criticized or put down, we'll put that spin on the rest of life and our perspective of ourselves.    So, someone who grew up in a very unloving home might tend to think of God in the same way.  The wonderful experience is, however, to seek God and find out that He is not at all like our parents.  Our parents are imperfect and sin ridden just like you and I and everyone else on the planet.    Reshaping your perspective on God, life and yourself is a life-long and worthy pursuit.    A good place to start would be to do a study on "love" in the New Testament.  Personally, I think that is the over-riding theme of the New Testament.  But, many people don't see it because of just what you're referring to- a pre-shaped perspective on a God that is not so loving.  Look at all the New Testament has to say about love and the love of God and see what happens.    Love, joy and peace!|`|AA10973117	Most definitely. That's why it's important for men who are fathers to BE fathers and above all make sure your children know you love them. It's much harder to understand a relationship with The Heavenly Father if you don't have a good relationship with your earthly father.    Remember, kids know more about you than what you said, they know what you did, and they love you anyway. All our children want is for us to know what they did, and love them anyway, whether they are 5, 15 or 50.|`|AA11274366	YES - and it is as a result of the pain that you experienced with your parents, that you now have difficulty in loving yourself.  God IS everything and each and everyone of us are minute parts of the whole - we are all, tiny parts of God!  We are called to love ourselves, and accept ourselves, exactly as we are in this here and now!  When we learn to love ourselves then we can feel/receive the love that is extended towards us.  God's love is more than you can ever imagine possible - it IS unconditional, it is pure, it is all that is good!  Consider the sun He provides daily, the flowers He places in your garden, the air that you breath, this is all Gods love and so much more!|`|AA11962957	If you are comparing God's love to parental love, you probably have a mis-understanding between the two.  As we all know, humans are flawed and as a rule self-centered.  Parental love often seems like "I love you if..... (fill in the blanks here with good grades, proper behaviour, obedience etc.)    God's love is completely different.  He loves us in spite of our flaws.  There is nothing we can do (or have to do) to earn his love.  As his creation we are built to desire his love and want to feel his love for us.  And God is perfect love.  I don't think we will understand that until we get to heaven.    Think of it this way.  You were saved because the sacrifice (Jesus) was acceptable to God.  It's not based on your works or how well you think  you measure up.  It says in the bible that none of us measures up on our own.  But that's ok, God provided a solution.  The debt is paid.  Accept it.  Be free.  Be happy.    And remember you've got one good parent in heaven at least that loves you like mad!|`|b7daa69002c642e255f866a0ab326755aa	If you believe in God you will realise that tests will always be thrown at you through life whether they be family, money, health or love problems, its how you handle them that will give you the answers, try working on your relationship with your parents first sit down and talk to them if you concentrate on this you will find in time.....god will let you know he loves you.    Peace out|`|a8821b2576243714f61b6091905d589eaa	read the Power of Intention by Dr. Wayne W. Dyer---when you change how you look at things, then things will begin to change.  you were created with the ability to "create" your reality. your thoughts create your world. if you think you have no friends, then you have no friends. think about how you want life to be, dwell on it, dream about it, and you will see it. Imagine you already have life as you wish it to be, see it from the results you want to be, then think in that direction.|`|AA12333411	Unless you know exactly what your relationship is with God then you will always find it difficult to understand His love.    It is explained in all the scriptures that our first and foremost relationship is with God and that we should not become too attached to our other relationships. In fact it is our other relationships that often cause us to forget about God.|`|AA12265577	You have a relationship with your parents as everyone does. Experience in this relationship might be good or bad. There is always a reason and teaching in everything for us. If you have had a bad relationship then u need to introspect, WHY?

But He does love you unconditionally and He is there for you. Seek Him out.|`|AA10027931	You might have strained relationships with your parents because you don't believe in the 5th commandment. Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long upon the land which the Lord your God is giving you.|`|2df62b129c1a848c5b5f53b87e8f9620aa	I think this is one of the most intelligent, insightful questions I have ever seen posed here.  You are completely, 100% correct -- many people who have poor family relationships (particularly with their fathers) have a very difficult time believing in God and relating to Him as the awsome Creator of the universe.    God's Word, the Bible, explains that He gave us family relationships with the express purpose of teaching us through example how we are to love Him.  Since the family is under such strong attack now, it is not at all unanticipated that we should see it spill over into our relationship with God.    If you seek to understand exactly how much God really loves you, read the Gospels from the New Testament:  Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.  John 3:16-18 tells us:      "16 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. 17 For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved.   18 He who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God."    It is easy for those of us who come from a rough family background to assign the same characteristics we see there to God.  But the passage quoted above should tell you this:  God loves YOU so much that He sent a part of Himself down to earth to show you the way back to Him; He would rather go through humiliation, torture and physical death than to live without you in Heaven.      Surely, neither your earthly father or mother would die for you.  But God did.  All you have to do is seek Him out -- get to know Him.  Read the Gospels and pray to Him to help you with your unbelief.  I promise you, He will answer.    May God bless and keep you.|`|AA11470673	some people who had difficulty  with authority figures do transfer it to god|`|3a6011cbf69332819dc814d3881ac6aeaa	How the heck are any of us suppose to know that!|`|AA10707135	Yup sure does... Your parents were authority figures in your life and that image taints your view of God. I know... I was once like you... matter of fact... I still struggle with this. But I must look to the Bible and believe what it says about Him as the truth... and transform my mind into His image. That is going to take a lot of help with other Christians... you should not keep to yourself... you need others to help you be encouraged.

The Bible and the Quran tells us that we must honor our parents--and we must Forgive them for their shortcomings. Its hard indeed--but if you want a better relatinship with your parents---you must forgive them for all the mistakes they make--they are human beings--not gods...

d93569f577829db1c895d0867a499a44aa	I personally believe there are definitely two sides to the Bohemian Grove! One, the accepted and acceptable face, is a 'good old boys' club' for the influential of the world and the other (that many members may not be totally aware of) is a sinister 'black arts' ritual that gets participation and power from its members under the guise of 'innocent fun'!    I watched the "Dark Secrets" documentary and although I have no issues with an exclusive club where the powerful get together to network and relax... The pageant was not that! It was purely occult and the invocations were straight from the teachings of the dark arts, or black magic.     These people, Our Leaders!, are professing the highest ideals and morals and most claim to be Christians, and yet, here we see them practicing, if not Satanism, the next thing to it! Most of the folks I have talked with who have seen this film poo-pooed the idea of this being an occult ritual. That is only because they have no knowledge or experience with the occult.     Words have power. Invocations such as the ones used in this "play" call up forces of nature that can be used by those of the group who do know what they are really doing. The rest of the idiots participating in what they view as a party, are being duped. They unwittingly give energy and receive direction from dark forces (was it Baal they invoked?) that subtly and subconsciously influences their very thought and the decisions they make. This is a terrifying prospect and certainly helps explain why our civilization is seems to be on a fast ride to hell.    I dabbled in the occult as a youth... enough to manage to call up an energy that was not only totally alien to myself and my 'playmates', but frightening enough to make us all wake up to what we were doing. This is not just 'fun and games'! It is deadly serious and all I can say is "God help us all!"
1cf89bcd699d60dafcbbc55b92e0071caa	I'm not so much concern by your question as I am what is causing you to ask it.  If you are feeling in any way suicidal, I want you to understand that the feeling is normal, however you do need help to get you past why you are feeling that way.  Did you just have a breakup, your best friend moved, a loss of a loved one, or are you just not feeling understood?  You are not alone in the fact that you feel this way.  I too went through a very rough stint in HS, and the after-effects of not getting help right away have followed me all the way up to now, and I am 31.  I have found that getting help, even if it is just talking with a counselor or a friend that you trust.  If you have found yourself actually starting the actions of killing yourself, then don't stop to think....get help now.  With the right help, and in some cases the right medication, you will begin to feel more "normal" (whatever that is-right?) and feel yourself.  Good Luck!|`|3e01a31d15abfc0a8fe60d5d794e2ef4aa	Yep sure have. Even attempted it and almost succeeded. Life as we know it can be such a hard task to deal with.

AA12118308	1. The string tied around the wrist is called as Kankanam.  It's an indication that the person under some religious obligation. Be it pooja or Yagna or Vrat.      2. After specific religious rituals the diety is said to have establised and the there is a lot of cosmic energy in the diety.  Circumbulating around the diety helps in drawing of the cosmic energy into self.  This is called as Pradakshina    3. This is called as Aatma Pradakshina i.e., Circumbulating around oneself.  It is because, according to hinduism there is god in one's ownself.  More so, in puja's there is something called as Aavahana, Angannyasa, Karanyasa through which you invite the diety into  the bodies of all present in the Puja.   Hence, the reason as told in 2.|`|AA10457208	Ans 1: String.. it is a scintefic process.. Enery can be transfered in three ways viz. Mechanical energy, Light Enery and Sound Energy. String is a process of supplying enery in the form of sound energy. Every string have perticular Amplitude and perticular frequency. Our body is made up of Chemicals. To make a chemical reaction happen a perticular amount of energy is required which is called threshold energy. After marriege we need to do some extra jobs to be done. To perform these jobs we need to do some chemical reactions in our body. to make this chemical reaction we need threshold energy. This energy is provided by chattering Strings.    Ans 2: While circumambulating around the deity our body get heated and the chemical reactions can take place easily.    Ans 3: Stringing and turning around in a circle places the sound energy in all direction of yours.|`|AA12027599	You are asking about the rituals which many hindus take.    1 -  it is sort of vow to remain pious while doing the ritual and complete the rituals perfectly.      2- circling around diety and turning around is a sort of ritual, to absorb all the positive energies emitted by god and take the energies fully in your complete body    Hindus rituals may look alien to others due to cultural differences, but they were designed for the common public who were unable to understand the deeper philosophies of hinduism, hence they were told to do rituals in simple forms    hope next time u ask some question on Hindu philosophy which is unique of its kind.

c3f21897197e7d7f7d55e035a49a3218aa	The Wiccan Rede (Long form)  (also known as The Rede of the Wiccae and the Witches' Creed)  Generally credited to Doreen Valiente          Hear now the word of the Witches, the secrets we hid in the night,   When dark was our destinys pathway, That now we bring forth in the light.    Mysterious Water and Fire, The Earth and the wide-ranging Air,   By hidden Quintessence we know Them, and we will keep silent and dare.    The birth and rebirth of all Nature, the passing of Winter and Spring,   We share with the life Universal, rejoice in the Magical Ring    Four times in the year the Great Sabbat, returns, and the Witches are seen,   At Lammas and Candelas dancing, on May Eve and old Halloween    When daytime and nighttime are equal, when sun is at greatest and least,   The four lesser Sabbats are summoned, again Witches gather in feast.    Thirteen silver moons in a year are, thirteen is the Covens array,   Thirteen times at Esbat make merry, for each golden year and a day.    The power has passed down the ages, each time between woman and man  Each century unto the other, ere times and the ages began.    When drawn is the Magickal circle, by sword or athame of power,   Its compass between two worlds lies, in the land of shades of that hour.    Our world has no right to know it, and the world beyond will tell naught,   The oldest of Gods are invoked there, the great work of Magic is wrought.    For two are the mystical pillars, that stand at the gate of the shrine,   And two are the powers of Nature, the forms and the forces divine.    And do what thou wilt be the challenge, so be it in love that harms none,   For this is the only commandment, By Magick of old be it done.    Eight words the Witches Rede fulfill:  If it Harms none, Do what Thou Will!      There is another verson of this on http://www.wicca.com/celtic/wicca/creed....  This part I don't agree with what good will silence do, spread awareness, and help your brothers and sisters learn the "secrets" of the craft.   "Mysterious Water and Fire, The Earth and the wide-ranging Air,   By hidden Quintessence we know Them, and we will keep silent and dare."|`|AA11584380	I'm Pagan not Wiccan so the Wiccan Rede has no more importance to me than the Lord's Prayer.|`|a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	I am one of the many pagans who do not have this rede in my religion.  It is a nice thought and would probably be a good thing to think about sometimes.  I wouldn't use it as any kind of absolute though.|`|AA12367014	Since I'm Pagan but not Wiccan I don't concern myself with the Rede too much. My general opinion is that its ok, but its just not something I fully want to pledge to. In a way it sounds kind of....exclusionary. To me there are groups of Wiccans like that and I totally disagree with keeping secrets. People need to learn about it so they stop being afraid of it.|`|9fa1adb1c8a5e488f13a34915c1381ceaa	None, because I'm not a Wiccan. Its a common misconception to think all Pagans are Wiccans, and some Wiccans encourage this. Wicca is a religion. Many, many Pagans follow no religion, but seek thier own answers.|`|7aca9b657bf95d9de752b4d158578be4aa	For reference sake, here's the basic Rede:    "Eight Words the Wiccan Rede Fulfill:  An It Harm None, Do What you Will."    Simple enough. It's basically a poetic variation of the Golden Rule: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.     As for agreement, I am not sure what you mean, since this is not really a binding statement for all Pagans. There are Pagans and Witches who do not acknowledge or utilize the Rede, or who have modified it or replaced it with other things that are more in line with their beliefs. The Rede is specifically Wiccan.
AA10541105	I get your point, but America is known for being a nation of immigrants. We are also one of the youngest countries in the world.

And add that ninetynine percent of those you encounter in normal Occidental circles who "claim" it ... are just "fanciful" ... having grabbed a few occult store books, and echoing mumbo jumbo - is not enough to say that they "have" such a tradition ... or for that matter- that the "tradition" has them ...    Selfstyled Celts (some are genuine) ... goth Anne Rice styled vampires and ghosthunters ...and voudon ... fancy, imagination ... one has to sift away the fads and fakes ... and pop culture of it ... and someone needling a cloth doll ,lol ,is usually gonna be just another such idiot ...     Understand someone genuinely in that tradition ... a life sworn to serving the Loa ...or Orichas ... is not going to dabble at making a curse over some superficial and trite thing ... they incur considerable risk in such an undertaking ... if they are in the tradition they would know that ... and the majority of people in that tradition are likely to live and practice all their lives without wanting to put a curse on anyone ... realise that that aspect is simply sensationalized in our medias ...      As for imitators , dabbling with some booklearned curse ...I wouldn't worry about it ... if they reach any current- it is more likely to bounce back and zap them ... lol|`|7aca9b657bf95d9de752b4d158578be4aa	You can't because real practitioners of this faith don't do stuff like that.|`|9f1588726094d30fc956bc877ff90d0daa	If you truly believe that a voodoo spell has been placed on you, then it has been...but it was placed by you.

But correlating to feelings felt when attached, bereaved, obsessed, happy, connected, in a field, content...    Glad you're in love. Love life; have a good turbulent relationship with it. Only get divorced as a last resort.|`|c915100ce31dbb32679d927bbf715fdbaa	As Bob Dylan once wrote...Love is just a four letter word.|`|AA12001621	Love is something you feel yet you can't touch it, it's infactuation the first 2 years then it's all lust and roses, then comes the next 2 years and now starts another period were people now start to notice the small things about others, the things that get on your nerves, etc. then comes the next 3 years were people either drift apart or come closer together, it's these next 3 years that will define your relationship for the rest of your lives, and that's when you will either get to respect each other or part ways.Respect earned towards each other will normally carry your relationship through to your old age . People it's the 7 YEAR ITCH.Think of it like a piggy bank the more respect you get towards each other the more you will have to draw on when hard times happen and therefore your LOVE towards each other survive another test in life.

He fills you up with His Spirit when you seek Him.  And it seems He has found you!  :)  Enjoy His presence!    The Sandy Beach Bum

Then I told her that that happens to almost everyone who goes to church and the feelings she was feeling was relief.

It is not the job of the pastor, either are from the church members.  The only one that can convert of person to see the truth is the Holy Spirit, and the only one that can convert a person to sin is Satan.  No men can make you be converted into nothing.    Pastors and church member are just messengers, as well, the unbelievers are messengers from Satan.  So I really don't know where you got this from.  Because the word of God says clear "Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, say the Lord (Zechariah 4:6).    Do you allow Christs peace to reign in you? Do you resist his gift of peace?

We all do it in different ways. (I'm referring to how a person "Witnesses".) Some do it literally (ie. Preach), and some do it through just the normal way they live their life (i.e. setting the example ~ allowing their actions to speak.)    Secondly, it is the work of the Holy Spirit to "convert" ppl....not a 'pastor'.     The role a Pastor plays is: to shepherd the flock...lead them...give them sound instruction...    A mere man/woman cannot convert anyone.    I realize I'm sounding "exact" and sorry if it sound condescending, but there are people here who will read your remarks and take them literally...so I figured I'd edify the obvious.

(Mar 16:15)  And he said to them, Go into all the world and preach my gospel to the whole creation.    In Protestant Christianity, evangelism by the laity has always been allowed.

The pastor's job is not to convert people, it is to take care of people.  They do that by teaching, preaching, helping, etc.    2.  The Christian's job is not to convert people.  It is our job to live a life pleasing to God and teach other people about His great love for them.    3.  God will work on the "conversion" part of it (though i don't like that word - it sounds so rough).  I'd like to say God will lead them into understanding.  Then each individual CHOOSES to believe or not.    4.  So it is nobody's "job" to convert people.  It IS our job to teach, live, and show others about God and His will for their life.  Then they have the the "job" to believe or deny.    Thanks for the great question!  be blessed!

d17dab2f5223f525668cd6b49aa634e2aa	Here is the answer posted at my blog which was answer to Barry R question.     According to Qur'an there is no compulsion to believe in religion.    2:256 Let there be no compulsion in religion: Truth stands out clear from Error: whoever rejects evil and believes in Allah hath grasped the most trustworthy hand-hold, that never breaks. And Allah heareth and knoweth all things.    There is no punishment for anyone who wanted to covert to any other relligion. The punishment for that person will be with God.    16:106 Any one who, after accepting faith in God, utters Unbelief,- except under compulsion, his heart remaining firm in Faith - but such as open their breast to Unbelief, on them is Wrath from God, and theirs will be a dreadful Penalty.    This question is posted again by Beam G the same question with differnt wording including the link to faithfreedom which is a hate promiting website and forum to keep this Islam hatred spread.    I do not visit any anti Christianity websites and I certainly don't visit faithfreedom. I did not click the link but with doing so am sure that Ali Sania tried to prove that leaving Islam is not allowed and the punishment is to kill the person. They sure would have included the fabricated hadith to prove their point. What really is the origin of that hadith? It can't be Qur'an and it must not be Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) because there is no such punishment or restriction mentioned in any of the Qur'an verse. The answer is that this hadith is imported from Book of Mark the Chrisitian religious and sacred scripture.    Book of Mark - 14:64    "You have heard the blasphemy; R731 how does it seem to you?" And they all condemned Him to be deserving of death.|`|6ec1ae2eb7e1e37edffcc2d3aad45110aa	They are not confied by Islam.

Tarot cards are not a toy,,, they have power and yes they can be truthful to a point. But ultimately, their power is limited because God has the greater power and if you would just go to the source... you would find someone who really loves you and will help you in ways you can not fathom or begin to understand.

All things have archtypes, ultimate versions of them, which they are connected to, if not dozens of such (the Perfect male, the Perfect Carpenter, the Perfect child).  These archtypes adjust VERY slowly as reality changes, but also influence all reality.  The cards are older than people realize and represent these archtypes (the cards are incomplete in that not all archtypes are represented, but that is because they represent a particular spiritual path that has been lost to mankind due to the secrecy surrounding them).    The archtypes, the cards called up are those that most influence the situation, and it depends on what connection you have with those archtypes, how firm that connection is.    Fortune telling is a rather superstitious way to use them, vs. spiritual, (and neglects the potential of the cards as tools), but then again, running around with holy water to fight vampires is fairly common as well.

Aposto que nem Deus sabe por que tem essas coisas na bblia|`|c71a2a6c6369c1ad647478f29ef41631aa	Eh, com um deus desses a humanidade nem precisa de satans...|`|3a398f34dfad7fd10d7ea1d733192bbfaa	Os anjos decados foram tomados pela arrogancia e presun??o e quiseram o lugar de Deus, porm eles n?o tinham cacife suficiente para tomar o lugar DELE , ent?o eles levaram um pontap.    Vc sabe o que  morte? morte  separa??o, eles morreram sim , espiritualmente, e hoje ainda o salrio do pecado  a morte a bblia diz, mas mesmo qdo vc blasfema deste jeito e peca seja como for vc n?o cai duro morto pois a morte ela acontece espiritual primeiro, pois todo o ser humano j est sentenciado a morte que vai chegar...a morte espiritual  a separa??o de Deus , a pessoa passa a ter morte e escurid?o dentro de si, ela precisa de coisas externas para sentir -se vida, se n?o der um gole, drogas, ou coisas para iludirem o seu interior ficam sentindo um vazio e n?o adianta nada deste mundo, nada preenche cada vez que a pessoa t s ou sem seus subterfugios ela fica na escurid~~ao de novo... Ad?o e eva morreram sim espiritualmente e foram sentenciados a morte fsica coisa que eles n?o passariam...Deu disse certamente morrers... e realmente eles que eram seres eternos receberam a senten?a que voltariam ao p.  Ele colocou os querubins para impedir que Ad?o e Eva por que estavam agora em pecado, comessem daquele fruto eterno e vivessem eternamente naquela condi??o de pecado, mentira, esta rvore da vida ainda existe diz em Apoc. e Deus pelo perd?o dos nossos pecados  nos limpa para que viovamos por toda a eternidade com ele , sem enfermidades, morte, lgrimas, dores e mentiras...o pecado abriu a porta para o mal entrar , as doen?as, a morte, a mentira, etc...   Ele sabe de tudo mas ele deu ao homem o livre arbitrio, Ele queria que eles obedecessem e o amassem, ele n?o queria robos, ele criou pessoas como Ele aptas para raciocinarem e fazerem o que  certo, assim como uma pessoa que ama a outra n?o quer que a outra esteja com ela for?ada...Ele deu a liberdade a eles a fim de que optassem por obedece-lo.  J pensou vc ter uma namorada e ela n?o te trair por que vc t com os olhos em cima dela, vigiando e dizendo n?o...isso n?o vale...vc vai deix-la e se ela tiver que ser sua vai ser por que quer...  A idolatria atrai maldi??es e o povo de Israel levava o nome de Deus e se eles permanecessem servindo a estas entidades decadas elas mesmas iriam trazer dano, como a morte no Antigo Testamento n?o era eterna Ele mesmo j iria providenciar a salva??o para todos, tanto que JEsus depois de seua morte desceu ao inferno e pregou ao que estavam presos por satans que  todo este povo desta poca, e a bblia diz que todos aceitaram "levou cativo o cativeiro", e todos estes foram salvos.  Os seres humanos tomados pela maldade e violncia, foram criados por Deus e para serem a glria de Deus e n?o serem a vergonha e desonra...ent?o como eles s estavam se autodestruindo e s estavam causando maiores dores entre si e ao prprio Deus , Deus os exterminou fisicamente...porm n?o esque?a de lembrar que Ele os salvou eternamente, pois eles que estavam mortos ouviram a prega??o de Jesus qdo desceu ao inferno e pregou-lhe e hoje eles est?o diante de Deus...  Leia a Bblia no Novo Testamento e ver tudo isso.|`|2c47b70e308f13e7f021d3d6023bba11aa	Ns temos o direito de argumentar, ns podemos fazer tudo o que quisermos pois o Bom Deus nos permite, porm nem tudo nos convm. Se vc entendesse um pouco da Bblia entenderia que no momento em que Eva comeu aquele fruto e Ad?o tambm eles morreram, e juntamente com eles eu e vc. Como assim morreram, primeiro Deus nunca mente OK? Apartir deste dia, existiu a morte, fomos expulsos do paraso porque merecamos isso, e apartir deste dia morremos ou vc pensa que vamos ficar para semente! RSRSRS...  Ele tem seus guardas e os usa sempre quando precisa, e se ele quis colocar querubins, serafins ou qualquer outro de sua tropa ele pode, se vc fosse um rei n?o iria dispor de seu exercito!?  Quando pecamos ele n?o nos acusa se voc se sente acusado quando peca  o inimigo. Ele esperou pra que Eva confessasse seu pecado.  Porque eles renunciaram a vida a partir do momento que adoraram ao Bezerro de Ouro. J n?o eram o povo de Deus e que para as gera??es futuras conhecessem a vida.  Toda a humanidade foi morta n?o pelo diluvio em si, mas pelo seus pecados j n?o havia mais geito e tanto que para n?o ter que fazer tudo isso de novo ele mando seu unico filho para morrer em nosso lugar, se essa n?o  prova de amor suficiente para vc ent?o eu sinto muito. Voc mataria um filho seu, um filho unico por pessoas que n?o gostam de vc, e por pessoas que n?o gostam de seu filho e ainda duvidam de que vc faria isso por amor...  Os anjos tambem tem livre arbitrio e como tem muita gente revoltada, cega por varias raz?es assim tambm os anjos. O anjo dele que queria ser mais, ent?o p?e ideais na cabe?a deles ent?o vem S?o Miguel Arcanjo e diz:QUEM COMO DEUS?!  Ninguem absolutamente ninguem como DEUS ninguem  t?o bondoso, onipotente, onisciente, amoroso como o meu DEUS...  DEUS TE ABEN??E!!!!!!!!!!|`|48c22738ecf2d1afe9fc3afc0f08fcb9aa	Huuummm!...  hora de despertar n?o  mesmo!?    Eu tambm tinha vrias perguntas meio confusas e contraditrias, fazia assim:    Porque Deus no seu infinito amor,deixam que as pessoas de "bem" v embora t?o cedo?  Porque se o Ceu  t?o bom e ningum quer morrer?    e assim ia.....    Mas eis que consegui saber que esse realmente n?o era o Deus que achava que era e sim que tudo que acontecia nesse mundo, existia influencias de outras for?as que est?o acima de ns ( infelizmente ).    O nosso Deus Verdadeiro s quer ver o Bem de tudo e todos e n?o deseja mal a nenhum ser aqui da terra. Ele  um Deus de infinito amor e bondade sim.    Agora  preciso chegarmos a um concenso na vida, at aonde chegam os nosso limetes se realmente queremos acreditar em tudo que nos dizem e aprendemos ao longo do tempo da nossa vida.    E para isso  preciso despertar o "Raciocnio"... at agora s pensamos e imaginamos.    E Fase do Verdadeiro Deus j esta a, que  a Fase Racional. a Fase do Desenvolvimento do Raciocnio.

Stop quoting out of context just so you can prove an invalid point.|`|AA11652335	This was an interesting article.

Good point.|`|fda173b91a9226e690a30878407feda0aa	No more than the Bible, which is full of people killing infadels and their god raining down vengance on the unbelivers.|`|4125df15996c0bc6fb9f8e202f40ad1eaa	I don't think that the Quraan teaches violence as we understand it now.  We are reading language written so many years ago, during a time we can't begin to understand what life was like.  It's easy to take things out of context... it's easy to read phrases and certain sections and then draw quick conclusions.  I will be honest and say I've not read the Quraan.  I have read the Gospels and I know that Jesus spoke in parables... that He was not intending us to take His word literally.  Perhaps this is how the Quraan should  be approached??  I don't know.    Maybe I'm naive, but I can't imagine... I can't/won't believe that any religion would condone violence.  How could civilization maintain itself if it condoned violence??  It just doesn't make sense.      PEOPLE transform religion into violence.      Thank God that those people are the minority.|`|6e791ab2d1b84a5c220aec428b5cafb6aa	Yes Quraan Teach Violence..!  lemme know if you still have confusion.      ||Jai Shri Krishna|||`|AA11692620	Quran 2:191 And kill them wherever you find and catch them.

Muslims aren't like Buddhists or like Jehovas Witnesses, where it is impermissible to ues violence. The Witnesses refused to fight in WW2.

Most of the rich people who buy nice cars are dropouts or have never had an education.|`|AA11995878	You're basing your question on something called the "model minority" stereotype. Asian people, whether recent immigrants or multi-generational Americans are the same as other people in our country. Many of them struggle to learn and struggle to make ends meet like everyone else in our country. It's the ones who stand out with their nice cars and high intelligence that you notice. But, do you notice the ones driving average cars or working in service industry jobs? Do you notice the ones who have learning disorders or who get average grades in school? It's the ones who stand out on top who draw our attention.    To go back to your original question perhaps you are talking about the phenomena where many young men in their late teens and early twenties like to do car mods (modifications for aesthetics and performance) and race their cars. It's a very popular interest in young Asian American men in particular, as I understand it. I think they call the supped up cars "ricers."

AA11808736	Como Criar uma ONG     Agrupar pessoas, que tambm tenham afinidade com a causa , discutir uma minuta ou proposta de estatuto em uma reuni?o. Tal reuni?o dever ser convocada (panfletos, jornais, rdio..) para que o maior nmero de pessoas participe com a finalidade de formar uma Organiza??o N?o Governamental sem fins lucrativos (modelo vide GRUDE: e-mail grude@grude.org.br ou telefone/fax: (021) 447-3693)     Estando pronta esta proposta convoca-se a todos os interessados em oficializar a entidade para participarem de uma ASSEMBLIA GERAL DE FUNDA??O. Aqui  importante que se fa?a esta convoca??o com maior rigor, isto , atravs de uma carta convite, conhecido como Edital de Convoca??o, com dia, hora, local os objetivos e a pauta de discuss?o. Nesta Assemblia deve haver um livro de presen?a, um livro de Atas.     No dia e hora marcado elege-se uma mesa coordenadora ou dirigente provisria (presidente e 2 secretrios) Inicia-se com a leitura da pauta e debates para aprova??o do estatuto. Seria importante que cada participante tivesse um cpia do estatuto, se n?o for possvel copiar o estatuto (minuta) em lousa, ou cartazes.     Na reuni?o, aps a discuss?o e aprova??o do estatuto, elege-se a diretoria de acordo com o que foi determinado na Assemblia. No mnimo Presidente e vice, indicando no estatuto o tempo de mandato, etc, pois tem que existir uma pessoa que represente a institui??o.     Escrever uma Ata que de denomina: ATA DE CRIA??O DA ASSOCIA??O (nome) onde escreve-se que: no dia (data), as pessoas que abaixo assinam, no local tal, no municpio (cidade), (estado) com tais objetivos( elencar considera??es), se reuniram com a finalidade de montar a ONG que se denominar (nome) aprovando o estatuto que segue em anexo.     O presidente eleito tem que assinar e rubricar todas as folhas da Ata e Estatuto. Todos os presentes na reuni?o assinam e colocam o RG na Ata de Reuni?o.     Aps estes tramites h necessidade de registrar a ONG, reunindo a documenta??o e levando ao CARTRIO DE REGISTRO CIVIL DE PESSOAS JURDICAS de onde ser a sede da ONG.     Normalmente variam as exigncias para oficializar a ONG dependendo do Cartrio. Mas deve-se em princpio providenciar:     ? Estatuto e a ata de cria??o (reconhecer a firma do presidente eleito e dos diretores)     ? Preencher e assinar um requerimento de registro de estatutos que deve ser solicitado ao cartrio;     ?

It is individualistic, barbaric and kinda stupid.    You can only save your own soul since it is the only thing that is yours and yours alone.    Of course there are people who would say that they can save your soul or follow this follow that if you want to be saved just so you would be under control, to do what they want you to do or be what they want you to be. It is called Power-Play. Imperialism at psychological level.    But then again, ever ask why your soul needs saving in the first place?    Is there really a thing called soul? Who has it? What species? Earth has a soul? You have a soul? My neighbour's cat has a soul? What is a soul? Anyone ever seen it? Any significant proof that soul exists?    Power-play. The same way they sell you soap after they tell you about bacteria. Only in that case, there is realy such a thing as bacteria.

My truth might not be your truth...and vice versa...but it makes it no less valid.  The problem does not lie in a book or the written word; but in its multiple interpretations, subject to human error.  What turns most people off is that it then used in a self-serving manner to further ones own belief system.  The wisdom it contains is still wisdom and contains truth.  When you add it to other truths; you begin to form a whole...and therein is where the answer lies...we are all part of a whole and no one person will have all the answers.  We are equipped with innate knowledge unique to us...and all knowledge is valid...but often makes no sense until it is combined with further knowledge.  We were created this way for a reason...it forces us to share and combine our own internal wisdom until it becomes an absolute...and when this happens...you have a small concept of God.  It is too big to wrap our minds around it.  It isn't as divisive as it first appears...as it is actually designed for unity...and it has taken me a long time to see it...but it is a start...and we have to begin somewhere... through shared ideas and concepts.|`|AA11582363	To teach a person something is not brainwashing.

92971e8cafba11758bed8920064e37d0aa	Um dos argumentos mais comuns para argumentar a favor da existncia de deuses  a suposta necessidade de que "tudo tem que ser criado, tem que vir de alguma coisa". Ora, mas se isso  verdade, ent?o os deuses tambm precisam ter sido criados por alguma outra coisa, e assim por diante. Os religiosos costumam dizer que seus deuses s?o "incriados" (ou seja, n?o criados), mas se eles podem ser incriados, ent?o o universo tambm pode ser incriado, descartando a necessidade da existncia de deuses criadores.     Resumindo: alguns deuses tm "pais" (vide a mitologia greco-romana), mas sempre sobra pelo menos um deles que n?o tem "pai" -- inclusive o deus judaico-crist?o. Os crist?os n?o tm resposta para esse problema, e assim os descrentes apontam que a origem de todo tipo de deuses  a nossa prpria ignorancia, pois s se invocam explica??es divinas para mascarar o fato de que n?o temos nenhuma explica??o convincente.|`|676ca7a4ca48599c048d221cf10702f1aa	deus n?o existe, portanto n?o existe "pai de deus"|`|b8b8644ebe50d7ec7090f621029e793baa	deus nunca existiu, foi uma elabora??o humana para aplacar suas angstias relativas  ignorancia dos fatos da vida.

Soares e os pastares da Igreja Universal do Reino de Deus, ganham por volta de 7.000 a 8.000 reais por ms !!!!    Os dizimos e ofertas que os fiis fazem, alm de campanha de ASSOCIADOS para manter o programa no AR, toda esta renda vai para os bolsos dos bacanas!!!!    Isso tudo sem contar os livros, os CD's, e toda a explora??o comercial ensima do produto chamado JESUS!    Jesus  vendido em cada esquina como um produto.  Essa que  a verdade!    E n?o  s as igrejas evanglicas que fazem isso n?o!  A catlica engana o povo tambm.  Os dizimistas catlicos d?o suas rendas para sustentar o padre que cuida da comunidade a qual pertence.  O Vaticano tem muito dinheiro e poder, tem at um Banco, o Banco Esprito Santo.  Eles tem muito poder e dinheiro.    A doutrina que os religiosos usam pra exigir o pagamento dos dzimos e das ofertas,  um texto do livro de Malaquias no Antigo Testamento.  L fala do povo israelita, que tinha um sistema de adora??o em que se exigia o pagamento da dcima parte (10% - dzimo) para o templo (casa) de Deus.    Pois naquele sistema, a tribo de Levi que era sacerdotal n?o trabalhava na terra nem em outra atividade normal, ,comum e corriqueira do dia a dia, mas somente trabalhava no templo de Deus.  POr consequencia, quem alimentaria aquele povo todo?  Ora... todas as outras tripos da na??o de Israel.    O templo era usado para ora??o, ,para ensinamentos, ,consultas aos profetas e tambm para sacrificar os animais pelo perd?o dos pecados.  E pra manter todo o funcionamento daquele templo, gastava-se muito, por isso cada cidad?o israelita pagava 10% dos seus rendimentos para financiar,  custear, sustentar, manter aquele templo e seus trabalhadores internos.    Com a vinda de Jesus, e o abolimento da Lei de Moiss, o templo fsico foi tornado obsoleto, e nada daquilo era mais necessrio...  Nem mesmo pagar o dzimo  mais necessrio.    Mas por conveniencia, os caras tiram da Bblia somente as interpreta??es que lhes convm...   por isso que eles continuam a manter esta doutrina at hoje.     pra explorar os trouxas que acreditam neles.|`|746245fa01b56d52f29059e0b518081faa	Igrejas s?o um comrcio de receita quase lquida.

Pode-se dizer que ele  t?o antigo quanto o trabalho.    A novidade reside na intensifica??o, gravidade, amplitude e banaliza??o do fen?meno e na abordagem que tenta estabelecer o nexo-causal com a organiza??o do trabalho e trat-lo como n?o inerente ao trabalho. A reflex?o e o debate sobre o tema s?o recentes no Brasil, tendo ganhado for?a aps a divulga??o da pesquisa brasileira realizada por Dra. Margarida Barreto. Tema da sua disserta??o de Mestrado em Psicologia Social, foi defendida em 22 de maio de 2000 na PUC/ SP, sob o ttulo "Uma jornada de humilha??es".    A primeira matria sobre a pesquisa brasileira saiu na Folha de S?o Paulo, no dia 25 de novembro de 2000, na coluna de M?nica Brgamo. Desde ent?o o tema tem tido presen?a constante nos jornais, revistas, rdio e televis?o, em todo pas. O assunto vem sendo discutido amplamente pela sociedade, em particular no movimento sindical e no ambito do legislativo.    Em agosto do mesmo ano, foi publicado no Brasil o livro de Marie France Hirigoyen "Harclement Moral: la violence perverse au quotidien". O livro foi traduzido pela Editora Bertrand Brasil, com o ttulo Assdio moral: a violncia perversa no cotidiano.    Atualmente existem mais de 80 projetos de lei em diferentes municpios do pas. Vrios projetos j foram aprovados e, entre eles, destacamos: S?o Paulo, Natal, Guarulhos, Iracempolis, Bauru, Jaboticabal, Cascavel, Sidrolandia, Reserva do Igua?u, Guararema, Campinas, entre outros. No ambito estadual, o Rio de Janeiro, que, desde maio de 2002, condena esta prtica. Existem projetos em tramita??o nos estados de S?o Paulo, Rio Grande do Sul, Pernambuco, Paran, Bahia, entre outros. No ambito federal, h propostas de altera??o do Cdigo Penal e outros projetos de lei.    O que  humilha??o?    Conceito:  um sentimento de ser ofendido/a, menosprezado/a, rebaixado/a, inferiorizado/a, submetido/a, vexado/a, constrangido/a e ultrajado/a pelo outro/a.  sentir-se um ningum, sem valor, intil. Magoado/a, revoltado/a, perturbado/a, mortificado/a, trado/a, envergonhado/a, indignado/a e com raiva. A humilha??o causa dor, tristeza e sofrimento.    E o que  assdio moral no trabalho?     a exposi??o dos trabalhadores e trabalhadoras a situa??es humilhantes e constrangedoras, repetitivas e prolongadas durante a jornada de trabalho e no exerccio de suas fun??es, sendo mais comuns em rela??es hierrquicas autoritrias e assimtricas, em que predominam condutas negativas, rela??es desumanas e aticas de longa dura??o, de um ou mais chefes dirigida a um ou mais subordinado(s), desestabilizando a rela??o da vtima com o ambiente de trabalho e a organiza??o, for?ando-o a desistir do emprego.    Caracteriza-se pela degrada??o deliberada das condi??es de trabalho em que prevalecem atitudes e condutas negativas dos chefes em rela??o a seus subordinados, constituindo uma experincia subjetiva que acarreta prejuzos prticos e emocionais para o trabalhador e a organiza??o. A vtima escolhida  isolada do grupo sem explica??es, passando a ser hostilizada, ridicularizada, inferiorizada, culpabilizada e desacreditada diante dos pares. Estes, por medo do desemprego e a vergonha de serem tambm humilhados associado ao estmulo constante  competitividade, rompem os la?os afetivos com a vtima e, freqentemente, reproduzem e reatualizam a??es e atos do agressor no ambiente de trabalho, instaurando o 'pacto da tolerancia e do silncio' no coletivo, enquanto a vitima vai gradativamente se desestabilizando e fragilizando, 'perdendo' sua auto-estima.    O desabrochar do individualismo reafirma o perfil do 'novo' trabalhador: 'aut?nomo, flexvel', capaz, competitivo, criativo, agressivo, qualificado e empregvel. Estas habilidades o qualificam para a demanda do mercado que procura a excelncia e sade perfeita. Estar 'apto' significa responsabilizar os trabalhadores pela forma??o/qualifica??o e culpabiliz-los pelo desemprego, aumento da pobreza urbana e misria, desfocando a realidade e impondo aos trabalhadores um sofrimento perverso.    A humilha??o repetitiva e de longa dura??o interfere na vida do trabalhador e trabalhadora de modo direto, comprometendo sua identidade, dignidade e rela??es afetivas e sociais, ocasionando graves danos  sade fsica e mental*, que podem evoluir para a incapacidade laborativa, desemprego ou mesmo a morte, constituindo um risco invisvel, porm concreto, nas rela??es e condi??es de trabalho.    A violncia moral no trabalho constitui um fen?meno internacional segundo levantamento recente da Organiza??o Internacional do Trabalho (OIT) com diversos paises desenvolvidos. A pesquisa aponta para distrbios da sade mental relacionado com as condi??es de trabalho em pases como Finlandia, Alemanha, Reino Unido, Pol?nia e Estados Unidos. As perspectivas s?o sombrias para as duas prximas dcadas, pois segundo a OIT e Organiza??o Mundial da Sade, estas ser?o as dcadas do 'mal estar na globaliza??o", onde predominar depress?es, angustias e outros danos psquicos, relacionados com as novas polticas de gest?o na organiza??o de trabalho e que est?o vinculadas as polticas neoliberais.|`|c609a09cfeab7c2a47fd291bc3a8b912aa	O que  Assdio Moral no Trabalho     a exposi??o dos trabalhadores e trabalhadoras a situa??es humilhantes e constrangedoras, repetitivas e prolongadas durante a jornada de trabalho e no exerccio de suas fun??es, sendo mais comuns em rela??es hierrquicas autoritrias e assimtricas, em que predominam condutas negativas, rela??es desumanas e aticas de longa dura??o, de um ou mais chefes dirigida a um ou mais subordinado(s), desestabilizando a rela??o da vtima com o ambiente de trabalho e a organiza??o, for?ando-o a desistir do emprego.  Trata-se de uma situa??o evidentemente delicadssima numa Na??o com altssimas taxas de desemprego e uma tradi??o autoritria egressa do escravismo, na qual o agressor informa sempre (irritante e persistentemente) estar querendo somente ajudar, dar um toque, uma dica. A depress?o  a doen?a mais freqentemente observada como oriunda do assdio moral. O agredido, usualmente sente-se humilhado, diminudo. A depress?o acaba trazendo novos problemas, agudizando o quadro do algoz que compreende o quadro depressivo do agredido e o ajuda mais um pouquinho com a sua pseudo-crist? piedade aporrinhando-o com mais e mais conselhos, em geral na linha do eu j fui assim quando jovem, com o tempo voc amadurece, etc. Complicado ouvir isso de gente com menos forma??o intelectual e menos idade que o agredido, n?o? Pois  o mais comum, agudizando ainda mais o quadro numa espiral que s tem final no rompimento total da rela??o trabalhista.  O que provoca o surgimento do Assdio Moral? Em geral inveja, mesquinhez, pequenez de mentalidade, medo de determinadas ousadias que quem sabe o que faz perpetrar intimoratamente. Claro, o agressor informa sempre estar ajudando e n?o assediar, mas o faz por compaix?o, por comisera??o do agredido. Suma hipocrisia, em sntese.|`|b8b8644ebe50d7ec7090f621029e793baa	Sei l.|`|82b1f299e218d21b0ce795fea270e480aa	Olha neste link tem muitas coisas sobre o Assedio Moral|`|ce6199e01d8a835eb990c1b893f7b2f6aa	Assdio Moral   a exposi??o dos trabalhadores a situa??es de humilha??o repetitivas e prolongadas durante a jornada de trabalho e no exercicio de sua fun??o.S?o atos de intimida??o e vexame no local de trabalho.

AA10571948	Are you friggin kidding me? I see white beggars all the time. how DARE you try to make it seem like black people are standing around looking for hand outs all the time? I'm extremely insulted. And I can't believe the answers that people wrote. New York is a breeding ground for black people? what the hell? are we rats? Black culture wants us to be on welfare??? No race has a culture that encourages people to be on welfare. Maybe you should stop stereotyping and look around you at all the black people who do have jobs, do own houses, do own cars, and do have families. All you see is one begger and you ignore everyone else walking around on the sidewalk next to you. I can't believe you said why arent there any white or asian beggers. Have you been to a homeless shelter idiot? You'll find them there. Why are all white people living in trailer parks and on Jerry Springer?? How do u like that?|`|AA12328826	Guess someplace else where its predominantly white, you will find the whites begging more.

The Asians in NYC were raised to not beg, but to be self-sufficient.    The black culture, at least in New York City, was raised to be dependent upon someone else, be it the welfare system, the black leadership, a labor union or whatever.  Growing up, they learned that anytime they want something, the best way to get it is to either beg for it or demand it.    This in no way means that people with black or brown colored skin are in any way less capable than any other group.  It only means that the 'black culture' in NY city, fostered by the Liberal Welfare State there, has conditioned their minds to think differently about how to get what they want or need.    It is unfortunate, I know, but it is true.    In Portland, OR, there are very few black people, so all the freeway ramps have white beggers.    There is a large Asian and Hispanic population here, but sorry, only white people seen begging at the off-ramps.  Facts are facts.

You can pray in Jesus name standing kneeling, driving, sitting, etc.  Just pray.........|`|c92b2aa00acae60221b8367646ac76b7aa	Okay let me explain, Allah made prayers according to our lives:   What I mean...  Fajr is 2 farz and 2 sunnate because we are lazy in the mornings  Zahur, most of us have time to pray (its mid day so we're not so lazy)  Asr, people want to sleep so only 4 farz  Maghrib- 3, 2, and 2 nafil because we come home from work or whatever  And Isha is the longest because we are about to go to sleep  Its funny how Allah knew this ahead of time, what can I say only he knows.   Anyways, if you cannot make a prayer, it is totally not possible anyway anyhow than you can SKIP it. This doesnt mean forget it.  You have to read QAZA namaz/salaat. Qaza is where you read only the farz of the prayer. So say I was reading asr qaza and maghrib qaza with my isha namaz.  So before reading isha, i would read 4 farz and 3 farz then isha namaaz/salaat. Email me at hitechmal@yahoo.com for more info or questions. You have to make up qaza. Also, talk to your school to let you pray during your break or something. Its different with us muslims we postrate. We dont pray like others. At work during your break you can read on or two. Even if you can read the farz at work or school it is okay. Allah understands.|`|a79f92fa510ca11d454820fd402d90b3aa	I was researching this myslef and i had read that you could for instance if you knew you couldn't make asar prayer you could combine it with dhuhr but there would have to be a good reason,then if you find that you can do asar at the time of prayer then you are to di  it at the alloted time.i don't know what you do but could you change a break time or lunch time.with school,my daughter will be praying,there are certain accomindations that must be met,unless it causes work or school undue stress then they are to meet our needs .have you tried talking to you work place about this,insha'allh theywould be understanding

Your question does not deserve an answer and people who have replied me have done a good job of answering it for you but since I have read it I can't help it but to join then in telling you what a narrow minded opinion you have. It's like saying that everytime some one gets knocked down they should give up their believes because it's not working for them. And no it isn't just a Muslim thing, it's just a very simply thing that you don't understand.    You know last year there were all those Huricanes that destroyed Florida and New Orleans and all - do you believe it was a sign from God that he doesn't like them and that they should all die? And maybe the same would be true for all the people who died in the tsunami and all the other natural disasters and wars and maybe God loves noone and everyone should be wiped from the earth. When you apply your very faulty logic on Muslims make sure you first justify on every other religion and everything else because when you point a finger at someone there are three fingers pointing back at you.    It would do you good to pick a book and read about Islam.

We weren't indoctrinatized into hating anyone as kids, these conspiracy theories you guys are coming up with is such a joke............

The crusaders and their apologists "hating" came much later.....  they weren't very nice,.......... don't ya think?      The Tauhidic concept in Islam insist that plurality , tolerance and universality of shared values be the mantra of islamic civilisation,........that diversity is accepted and allowed to flourish.

You are revealing a considerable lack of historical knowledge when making this statement.. The hatred being evidenced today is the result  of the indoctrination of hatred in the children from the time they are old enough to read... teaching them to hate those who were the "Crusaders." The ones responsible for forcing the Ottoman Empire back out of Europe.    Just in case you don't keep up with the news, the latest pronouncement by the terrorists was; take back the lands of Spain and France. They want the entire Mediteranean coastal area as the land of Islam. Then expanding into Africa (ongoing at this time), Indonesia (ongoing), Russia (ongoing).    This enmity goes way back to the time of Abraham. The son delilvered from his wifes maid was the beginning of the arabic people. That son was not given the recognition that the son delivered from his wife Sarah. So the enmity has been long in the making.. And fulfills what we now understand  as Gog and Magog.    You may be totally surprised with the events unfolding, should you actually read your Bible..Or the sacred book of any religion.    Biblical prophecy does not happen over night.. It takes many years for it to be fulfilled.

c67cc7c32453611179e6518cf694cdc0aa	Die Alchemie (auch Alchimie) ist ein alter Zweig der Naturphilosophie und wurde im 17./18. Jahrhundert nach und nach von der modernen Chemie und Pharmakologie abgel?st. Die Alchemisten bezeichnen die Alchemie auch als K?nigliche Kunst. In heutiger Zeit nennen sich manche Vertreter der Pseudowissenschaften ebenfalls "Alchemisten". Oft wird angenommen, die "Herstellung" von Gold (siehe Goldsynthese) und anderer Edelmetalle (siehe Edelmetallsynthese) sei das einzige Ziel der Alchemisten, die Adepten (gro?en Alchemisten) sehen diese Transmutationen eher als Nebenprodukt einer inneren Wandlung.|`|0a19bae0b0cd10f54bd8b508ff221814aa	Alchimie, alte Kunst, die vornehmlich im Mittelalter ausgebt wurde. In der Alchimie ging es haupts?chlich um den Versuch, gew?hnliche Metalle in Gold oder Silber umzuwandeln. Ein weiterer Aspekt war die Suche nach einem Mittel fr die Unsterblichkeit. Obwohl die Absichten und Praktiken aus heutiger Sicht fragwrdig und illusorisch erscheinen, war die Alchimie der Vorl?ufer der modernen Wissenschaft, insbesonders der Chemie.    2  Geschichte und Entwicklung     Druckerfreundliche Version des Abschnitts  Die Entwicklung der Alchimie begann im ?gyptischen Alexandria. Etwa zur gleichen Zeit entstand auch in China eine Schule fr Alchimie. In den Schriften einiger alter griechischer Philosophen findet man die ersten chemischen Theorien. Im 5. Jahrhundert v. Chr. entwickelte Empedokles die Theorie, dass alle Dinge aus den vier Elementen Luft, Erde, Feuer und Wasser bestehen. Diese Theorie hatte einen entscheidenden Einfluss auf die Alchimie. Der r?mische Kaiser Caligula soll versucht haben, Auripigment, ein Arsensulfid, in Gold umzuwandeln. Auf Anordnung des Kaisers Diokletian sind s?mtliche Schriften der ?gypter, die sich mit der Chemie von Gold und Silber befassen, verbrannt worden. Diokletian wollte damit derartige Experimente unterbinden. Zosimos von Panopolis (350-420 n. Chr.) fand heraus, dass Schwefels?ure Metalle aufl?sen kann. Er setzte au?erdem Sauerstoff aus rotem Quecksilberoxid frei. Zosimos ist der ?lteste alchimistische Schriftsteller, der in Alexandria als Gnostiker (siehe Gnostizismus) gelehrt und geschrieben haben soll. Sein Hauptwerk ist die ?Enzyklop?die, welche das gesamte Wissen seiner Zeit zusammenfasst.    Ein Grundprinzip der Alchimie stammt aus der Lehre des Aristoteles, nach der alle Dinge zur Perfektion hinstreben. Da Gold als das ?edelste der Metalle angesehen wurde, war es denkbar, dieses Metall werde im Erdinneren auf natrlichem Wege aus den anderen Metallen gebildet. Somit k?nnte ein Mensch mit entsprechenden F?higkeiten und dem n?tigen Eifer diesen Prozess in seinem Labor nachvollziehen. Die zu diesem Zweck unternommenen Anstrengungen waren anfangs empirisch und praktisch. Sie fhrten sp?ter zur Magie und schwarzen Kunst, aber auch zu frhen Formen der Astrologie.    In den Kalifaten der Abbasiden blhte von 750 bis 1258 eine Schule der Pharmazie. Die ?lteste bekannte und sp?ter ins Lateinische bersetzte Arbeit dieser Schule ist die Summa Perfectionis Magisterii, die dem arabischen Wissenschaftler und Philosophen Abu Musa Jabir Ibn Hayyan (im Mittelalter Geber genannt) zugeschrieben wird. Die arabischen Alchimisten waren sowohl im Umgang mit Gold, Quecksilber, Arsen und Schwefel als auch mit Salzen und S?uren bewandert. Au?erdem kannten sie bereits einige der heute blichen chemischen Reagenzien. Nach der damaligen Vorstellung bestanden Metalle aus Formk?rpern, die sich wiederum aus unterschiedlichen Anteilen von Quecksilber und Schwefel zusammensetzten. Nach wissenschaftlicher berzeugung war eine Transmutation m?glich. Mit ihrer vergleichsweise willkrlichen Suche fanden die arabischen Alchimisten erstaunlich viele neue Stoffe und entwickelten ntzliche Verfahren.    Von Arabien bahnte sich die Alchimie ihren Weg ber Spanien nach Europa. Die frhesten noch vorhandenen Arbeiten europ?ischer Alchimisten stammen von dem englischen M?nch Roger Bacon und dem Philosophen Albertus Magnus. Beide glaubten an die Umwandelbarkeit minderer Metalle in Gold. Die Idee an sich erregte natrlich die Phantasie, sp?ter auch die Habgier der Menschen im Mittelalter. Gold war fr sie das edelste aller Metalle. Sie versuchten, den so genannten Stein der Weisen herzustellen oder zu finden, mit dessen Hilfe niedere Metalle in Gold umgewandelt werden k?nnten. Roger Bacon glaubte, das Lebenselixier sei in K?nigswasser aufgel?stes Gold.    Die Fundamente der wissenschaftlichen Chemie entstanden im 15. und 16. Jahrhundert. Zu den wichtigen Sammelwerken von Rezepturen und Verfahren dieser Zeit z?hlen die Pirotechnia (1540) des italienischen Metallurgen Vannoccio Biringuccio, De re metallica (1556) von dem deutschen Mineralogen Georgius Agricola und Alchemia (1597) des deutschen Naturforschers und Chemikers Andreas Libavius.    Dass es unm?glich sei, den berhmten ?Stein der Weisen zu entdecken, erkannte bereits Paracelsus im 16. Jahrhundert (1493-1541). Er forderte die damalige Fachwelt auf, diese sinnlose Suche nach dem Allheilmittel aufzugeben und stattdessen Arzneimittel herzustellen. Paracelsus gilt als Begrnder der Iatrochemie. Allerdings findet man in seinen Schriften nicht nur berlegungen, die auf rein wissenschaftlichen Erfahrungen und Beobachtungen beruhen. So spielten z. B. in seinem Weltbild das Prinzip des Flchtigen (Mercurius), das Prinzip des Brennbaren (Sulfur) und das Prinzip des Rckstandes (Sal) eine wesentliche Rolle. Diese Bestandteile repr?sentierten Geist, Seele und K?rper des Menschen. Paracelsus vermutete auch, dass es einen wesentlichen Zusammenhang zwischen dem Menschen und dem Kosmos gebe.    Sp?ter gab es in Europa zwei Richtungen in der Alchimie. Die eine widmete sich der Erforschung neuer Elemente und Reaktionen. Sie sind die legitimen Vorfahren der modernen Chemie, die mit der Arbeit des franz?sischen Chemikers Antoine Laurent Lavoisier eingeleitet wurde. Die andere Gruppe schenkte der vision?ren, metaphysischen Seite der ursprnglichen Alchimie gr??ere Beachtung. Sie entwickelte sich in eine Richtung, die auf Hochstapelei, schwarzer Kunst und Betrug beruhte. Erw?hnenswert sind in diesem Zusammenhang die zweifelhaften Bestrebungen des Casanovas und des Cagliostros.|`|75535cb1965b6742a7d069205bf15c8eaa	Gold herstellen|`|95230f8eac1d3ff49eaca5df1c14e7faaa	die chemie vor etwa 100 jahren, bei der versucht wurde, aus wertlosen stoffen (z.b. quecksilber etc.) gold zu machen|`|f735ea55ef126d04f8f616f10cf51eb2aa	Alchemie war sozusagen der Vorg?nger unserer heutigen Naturwissenschaft der Chemie.

Und wird das Bild von Schlacken bemht, vielleicht wie Lava, die anf?nglich von Leben glht und v?llig erstarrt... weil die Seele in sich weder g?ttliche Kraft noch Licht bewahrt.     Die Seele ist unvollkommen, solange sie an eine Form gebunden ist, und sie ist darum auf Erden, um Kraft der uneigenntzigen Liebe  aller Form ledig und frei zu werden, auf da? sie sich in das Reich des Lichtes wieder erheben und in dasselbe eingehen kann.  So ist ihr Erdenlauf entweder ein K?mpfen und Ringen, oder sie kann durch ihre Liebekraft die Umhllungen und Schlacken wegbringen, was ihr mit der Hilfe und Gnade durch die Erl?sung Jesu Christi auch gelingt, da? sie die einstige Vollkommenheit in der Gott sie erschuf, sich wieder erringt.  Dann wird sie teilhaftig sein aller g?ttlichen Gaben, wie sie im Anbeginn geschaffen war, und sie wird keinereli Begrenzung in ihrer Erkenntnis noch in ihrem Schaffen haben, sondern wird wieder "g?ttlich" sein, wie sie war.    Der uns ins Leben rief, Der ist in Seinem Wesen, das Liebe ist  unbegrenzt, "unendlich" weit und hoch und tief, und es konnte aus Seinem Wesen nur etwas ebenso Vollkommenes hervorgehen, weil wir als Gesch?pfe Seiner "Liebe" vor Ihm stehen. So sind unsere Seelen im Grunde des Grundes ganz von eben derselben "Liebesubstanz"...     Aber wir haben gegen die Liebean- und durchstrahlung Gottes aufbegehrt.. wir haben die reinste Liebesubstanz, die wir waren, in das Gegenteil verkehrt. Denn am Widerstand mu? die Liebekraft Gottes unwirksam bleiben, die verbliebene Kraft verbraucht sich v?llig und es ist der folgende Zustand nur als gleich dem Tode zu beschreiben, was soviel hei?t, es erlischt der Geist und damit Gottes Gegenwart, weil das Wesen keinerlei Liebe in sich bewahrt.    Tiefe, Weite, H?he ist nur im Licht , auf Erden wie in Ewigkeit und es ist die Liebe, aus der es hervorbricht.. Darum, macht fr die Liebe die Tren hoch und die Tore weit. Folget Dem, Der uns ewiglich unabl?ssig rief, dann findet ihr Sein Reich in der Seele, unendlich tief, wenn ihr den Geist Gottes in euch zum Leben erweckt, was also ein jegliches Gebot Gottes bezweckt, alsdann, da? euch Gott inwendig belehren kann...|`|cf4da68c1195d221cc6c432dedb40459aa	unglublich tief|`|2ce7ff5358e47fd1c5e6cebaaa25bac4aa	sehr tief|`|5d37eb2e5f33301dc1e147aaa06a1c42aa	Sch?tze `mal so 173 cm hoch und und ca 22cm tief ;o)|`|ab1bb0ace9f8c951720db8da9edaba68aa	Sprst du die Tiefen deiner Seele   wie sie regungslos liegt,  wie sie von frher erz?hlt,  wie sie weint?|`|cb91360b5a6f2048cb870ab9b7b510eeaa	Sie ist nicht tief irgendwo, sie fllt mein ganzen K?rper|`|aca86d9f73989c4f0bf454d9e41d3e12aa	so um die 3,50 m.|`|205abd62e46618d0495f9ec4942e3c74aa	musst du fleissig graben, dann findest du es heraus.|`|94868a4556e2508e11dc2c3fc2ded1a1aa	Meine Seele ist nicht tief,nicht gro? oder hoch!

Existen criterios diagnsticos  para denominarlo de esta manera y son:     -Identificacin fuerte y persistente con el otro sexo (se manifiesta por tener el deseo de pertenecer al sexo opuesto).  - Uso de ropa del sexo opuesto.  - Deseo de vivir o ser tratado como del otro sexo.  - Conviccin de que se tienen los sentimientos y reacciones tpicos del sexo contrario.  - Creencia de que el otro sexo tiene una mejor calidad de vida.  - Incomodidad persistente con su sexo, o la sensacin de que se es inapropiado en el rol desempe?ado por ese sexo.  - Creencia de que se naci con el sexo equivocado.    A menudo estas personas buscan procedimientos para alterar fsicamente el aspecto al administrarse hormonas sexuales, electrlisis para la eliminacin de vello, ciruga plstica y ciruga para reasignacin de sexo (transexuales).

Un hombre homosexual (o gay) es un varn que siente atraccin sexual por otro hombre. Punto.

Caim foi o primeiro filho de Ad?o. Em Gnesis 4.2 encontramos Caim como lavrador, ou seja, j como homem adulto. Ent?o ele matou seu irm?o e saiu da face do Senhor (versculo 16), indo habitar na terra de Nodeversculo (evidentemente ela deveria ter este nome quando Moiss escreveu o Gnesis e significa "n?made" ou "errante"). N?o nos  dito quanto tempo se passou do versculo 16 at o versculo 17, quando Caim encontra uma esposa. A Bblia n?o nos diz e s podemos nos basear em conjecturas. Mas s?o conjecturas perfeitamente possveis e nada tm de estranho.    Alguns, que n?o crem, procuram usar desta passagem para desacreditar o escrito divino. Em Gnesis 5.3 nos  dito que Ad?o estava com 130 anos quando gerou Sete, e esta idade deveria ser um pouco mais que a idade de Caim. Lembre?se que Ad?o foi criado adulto e deve ter cado em pecado logo aps a cria??o de Eva pois, embora Deus j tivesse ordenado que se multiplicassem (Gnesis 1.28), Ad?o s conheceu sua mulher aps ter sido expulso do den (Gnesis 4.1).    Embora a primeira impress?o que se tem  que Sete tenha sido o terceiro filho de Ad?o e Eva, n?o podemos afirmar isto com certeza, pois a Palavra de Deus geralmente assinala apenas o nome daqueles que tm alguma importancia no contexto ou de quem viria uma genealogia.  comum tambm se omitir o nome das filhas. O fato de, por exemplo, n?o encontrarmos os nomes dos descendentes dos bisnetos de Caim n?o significa que n?o tenham existido. Simplesmente n?o s?o citados pois nada tinham a ver com o relato divino.    Porm, supondo que Ad?o n?o tenha tido filhos alm de Caim e Abel, depois de haver gerado Sete, Ad?o viveu mais oitocentos anos e "gerou filhos e filhas". Quantos? N?o nos  mostrado, mas voc pode imaginar. Se um casal brasileiro consegue gerar uma mdia de 4 filhos, vivendo uma mdia de 60 anos, o que n?o faria durante 800 anos, em condi??es de sade muito menos prejudicadas pelo pecado do que a que vemos em nossos dias! Junte?se a isto os filhos de sua descendncia e voc chegar a nmeros enormes.    Creio que se Caim viveu uns oitocentos anos (que era a mdia da poca), quando estava com uns trezentos anos j podia escolher, entre milhares de primas, sobrinhas e parentes distantes, uma esposa para si. E n?o somente isto, como tambm j podia construir uma cidade para abrigar tanta gente, como realmente o fez no captulo 4.17. N?o faria sentido construir uma cidade se n?o existisse j uma popula??o para ela. J li um clculo que foi feito da popula??o da Terra na poca do dilvio, que aconteceu cerca de 1700 anos aps a Cria??o, e  fantstico o nmero de pessoas que poderiam estar habitando a Terra.    N?o h nada de anormal nisso se multiplicarmos a gera??o de um homem de nossos dias por dez, que seria o equivalente aos oitocentos anos em mdia que se vivia ent?o. Pela extens?o dos anos de vida do homem naquela poca,  possvel que netos de Caim, ou at mesmo filhos de sua velhice, tenham perecido no dilvio. O problema maior para entendermos tudo isso reside no fato esquecermos que o tempo de vida de um homem antes do dilvio era muito maior que hoje. Mas podemos ficar sossegados; Caim teve tempo suficiente para ter vrias op??es de escolha at tomar uma esposa para si.    ------------         Algumas pessoas que jamais tiveram na m?o uma Bblia costumam fazer aos amantes da Palavra de Deus uma pergunta que imaginam muito embara?ante para os crdulos seguidores das Escrituras: Quem era a mulher de Caim?    Esta pergunta , em geral, acompanhada de um ligeiro histrico sobre a tragdia que envolveu a famlia de Ad?o, histrico que em geral n?o est em harmonia com o relato Bblico.    Dizem: Ad?o teve dois filhos: Caim e Abel, Caim mata Abel e foge para uma terra distante; l conhece uma mulher, e casa-se com ela. Com quem se casou se n?o havia habitantes na Terra?    Tal pergunta quase nunca  feita pelos que tm o bom hbito de ler a Bblia. Esperamos que o leitor seja destes. Mas procuremos elucidar este passo bblico. Primeiramente ajustemos a pergunta ao relato. N?o diz o texto bblico que Caim saiu para uma terra distante, e l casou-se, como querem os que formulam a pergunta.    O relato diz simplesmente: -  E saiu Caim de diante da face do Senhor, e habitou na terra de Node, da banda do oriente do den.  E conheceu a sua mulher, e ela concebeu, e teve a Enoque.               Gnesis: 4:16,17.    A regi?o para onde Caim se mudou era chamada terra de Node, mas isto na ocasi?o em que Moiss escrevia o fato, isto , cerca de 2.500 anos depois da cria??o do mundo.    Mas, surpreenda-se o leitor, o mundo j poderia ter na ocasi?o em que Caim prostrou morto seu irm?o, segundo clculos de grandes estudiosos, quase meio milh?o de habitantes. Sabia disso? Ent?o vejamos:    Segundo boas autoridades, o assassnio de Abel ocorreu no ano 128 ou 130 da cria??o do mundo. Ora, ns sabemos que alm de Caim, Abel e Sete, os trs primeiros filhos mencionados, Ad?o e Eva tiveram filhos e filhas. Gnesis 5:4    Mas admitamos, para sermos bem liberais, que Ad?o n?o tivesse tido outros filhos alm de Caim e Abel. Quantos poderiam ter sido os descendentes diretos de ambos at o ano 128, quando ocorreu a morte de Abel?    Vejamos esta opini?o de Clark:        N?o  exagero supor que os primeiros filhos de Ad?o tenham sido mulheres. Mas para n?o sermos rigorosos, vamos supor que somente aos 19 anos o filho primognito de Ad?o, Caim, tenha tido uma irm? em idade de casar-se (n?o se espante o leitor com o fato de haverem os filhos de Ad?o casado com as irm?s. At o tempo de Davi, isto ainda era comum entre todos os povos do mundo).

Se voc limita a possibilidade de resposta, como revelar os fatos.    se voc se escandaliza com a possibilidade de Caim casar-se com sua irm?, como voc agiria se soubesse que Tambm Abra?o fez isto    "E disse Abra?o: Porque eu dizia comigo: Certamente n?o h temor de Deus neste lugar, e eles me matar?o por causa da minha mulher. E, na verdade,  ela tambm minha irm?, filha de meu pai, mas n?o filha da minha m?e; e veio a ser minha mulher;" (Genesis  20:11-12)    A proibi??o quanto ao casamento de irm?os s vai acontecer 500 anos Depois com a Lei de Moiss:  "A nudez da tua irm?, filha de teu pai, ou filha de tua m?e, nascida em casa, ou fora de casa, a sua nudez n?o descobrirs.

Vou fazer a minha boa a??o agora: vou converter um crente!    Se vc est desesperado, nada d certo em sua vida, se sua vida s anda pra trs, est na hora de conhecer um centro esprita.     Ao contrrio do que as pessoas pensam, espiritismo n?o  coisa do diabo. Isso se chama PRECONCEITO. Ou seja, ter uma opini?o formada antes de ter o conhecimento adequado para formar opini?o.    Se voc pesquisar um pouco, deixar a ignorancia de lado e ler alguns livros espritas, voc descubrir que n?o tem nada de demonaco em seus textos.     Ah t, eu sei, o diabo veste pele de cordeirinho para enganar as pessoas.     Isso foi coisa da Igreja (na poca que era apenas uma) para colocar medo na cabe?a de seus fiis e imped-los de pensar.    N?o sei como muita gente ainda acredita nisso. Ah sim, eles ainda n?o pensam, he he he.    Mas voc eu sei que pensa. Ent?o, deixe o preconsceito de lado e vai ver como s?o os centros espritas. Voc vai descobrir que eles possuem uma energia boa, um ambiente leve, muito gostoso, propenso  medita??o,  ora??o. Bem diferente daquela gritaria estrica das igrejas evanglicas. Lembre-se: Deus n?o  surdo. N?o precisa gritar para Ele nos ouvir.    Ai, j ia esquecendo. A Bblia nos pobe de falarmos com os mortos. Hum, mas ser que ela deve ser levada ao p da letra? A Bblia tamabm diz que as mulheres devem ser submissas aos homens, que as mulheres menstruadas ficam impuras e todos que tocarem nela tambm se tornam impuros. Tambm fala que  justo termos escravos, que devemos sacrificar animais (tadinho do meu cachorrinho), e que quem comete o adultrio deve ser punido com a morte.  nessa bblia que voc acredita?    tsc tsc...    Aposto que voc n?o tem a mnima idia de como  a vida aps a morte? Talvez ache que vai ficar "dormindo" at o dia do juzo final e depois, se for salvo vai para o cu assistir os anjos tocarem harpa, sentado numa nuvem branca.     Pois bem, muitos espritos (esprito nada mais  do que um ser humano desencarnado) nos contaram como  a "vida" no mundo espiritual. E muitos de ns (encarnados) conseguimos deixar o nosso corpo enquanto dormimos (a chamada viagem astral) e vamos para o mundo espiritual. H vrios relatos impressionantes de l. E pode ter certeza, N?O  NADA DIABLICO!!!!!    Eu j disse, essa histria de diabo  s para enganar os trouxas.    Mas como voc n?o  troxa, n?o precisa mais acreditar nele, n?o  mesmo?    Muito bem, agora que voc j deixou o preconceito de lado, come?ou a pesquisar sobre o espiritismo, n?o acredita mais nessa histria de diabo, vai procurar um centro esprita, voc ver como sua vida mudar. Voc ser uma pessoa mais leve, mais compreensivel, mais feliz. Pois sabe que tudo o que acontece em nossa vida, n?o  culpa do diabo, nem de "trabalhos" feitos para nos derrubar. Mas sim de ns mesmos, de nossas atitudes frente  vida, nessa, e em outras encarna??es. E isso nos torna mais livres, pois sabemos que para melhorar, s depende de ns. Basta fazer por merecer. Orar, praticar o bem, n?o desejar mal a ningum, evitar os mals pensamentos. E logo logo atramos maravilhas para nossa vida.    Ent?o,    que assim seja.    E bem-vindo ao espiritismo!!!!!|`|cefed8b45c29fd9a85495545cf161956aa	sim pois na biblia diz que devemos levar a palavra em tempo e em fora de tempo.|`|fdb2522bed068e37901f11d0776214f1aa	Nossa que ridiculo...

O que devemos entender por infinito?   O que n?o tem come?o nem fim; o desconhecido; tudo o que   desconhecido  infinito.    Poderamos dizer que Deus  infinito?   Defini??o incompleta. Pobreza da linguagem dos homens, que  insuficiente para definir as coisas que est?o acima de sua inteligncia. Deus  infinito em suas perfei??es, mas o infinito  uma abstra??o. Dizer que Deus  infinito  tomar o atributo de uma coisa por ela prpria,  definir uma coisa que n?o  conhecida por uma outra igualmente desconhecida.    Onde podemos encontrar a prova da existncia de Deus?   Num axioma que aplicais s vossas cincias: n?o h efeito sem causa. Procurai a causa de tudo o que n?o  obra do homem, e a vossa raz?o vos responder. Para acreditar em Deus, basta ao homem lan?ar os olhos sobre as obras da cria??o. O universo existe, portanto ele tem uma causa. Duvi-  dar da existncia de Deus seria negar que todo efeito tem uma causa e admitir que o nada p?de fazer alguma coisa.    Que conclus?o podemos tirar do sentimento intuitivo que todos  os homens trazem em si mesmos da existncia de Deus?   A de que Deus existe; de onde lhes viria esse sentimento se repousasse sobre o nada?  ainda uma conseqncia do princpio de que n?o h efeito sem causa.    O sentimento ntimo que temos em ns da existncia de Deus  n?o seria o efeito da educa??o e das idias adquiridas?   Se fosse assim, por que vossos selvagens teriam tambm esse sentimento? Se o sentimento da existncia de um ser supremo fosse o produto de um ensinamento, n?o seria universal. Somente existiria naqueles que tivessem recebido esse ensinamento, como acontece com os conhecimentos cientficos.    Poderemos encontrar a causa primria da forma??o das coisas  nas propriedades ntimas da matria?   Mas, ent?o, qual teria sido a causa dessas propriedades? Sempre  preciso uma causa primria. Atribuir a forma??o primria das coisas s propriedades ntimas da matria seria tomar o efeito pela causa, porque essas propriedades s?o elas mesmas um efeito que deve ter uma causa.    O que pensar da opini?o que atribui a forma??o primria a uma  combina??o acidental e imprevista da matria, ou seja, ao acaso?   Outro absurdo! Que homem de bom senso pode conceber o acaso como um ser inteligente? E, alm de tudo, o que  o acaso? Nada. A harmonia que regula as atividades do universo revela combina??es e objetivos determinados e, por isso mesmo, um poder inteligente.    Atribuir a forma??o primria ao acaso seria um contra-senso, porque o acaso  cego e n?o pode produzir os efeitos que a inteligncia produz. Um acaso inteligente n?o seria mais um acaso.    Onde  que se v na causa primria a manifesta??o de uma  inteligncia suprema e superior a todas as inteligncias?   Tendes um provrbio que diz: Pela obra reconhece-se o autor. Pois bem: olhai a obra e procurai o autor.  o orgulho que causa a incredulidade. O homem orgulhoso n?o admite nada acima dele;  por isso que se julga um esprito forte. Pobre ser, que um sopro de Deus pode abater! Julga-se o poder de uma inteligncia por suas obras. Como nenhum ser humano pode criar o que a natureza produz, a causa primria  , portanto, uma inteligncia superior  humanidade.  Quaisquer que sejam os prodgios realizados pela inteligncia humana, essa inteligncia tem ela mesma uma causa e, quanto mais grandioso for o que ela realize, maior deve ser a causa primria.  essa inteligncia superior que  a causa primria de todas as coisas, qualquer que seja o nome que o homem lhe queira dar.|`|b8b8644ebe50d7ec7090f621029e793baa	N?o acredito em deus algum, por um puro exerccio da raz?o.

63a62ef730a0a77b58e62788c6d5fdeaaa	Acho que a resposta n?o pode ser generica. Eu n?o conhe?o totalmente os fundamentos da psicologia sobre simbologia em sonhos, mas uma boa maneira de interpretar algum sonho  tentar isolar as partes mais significativas e analisar aquilo que elas representam para voc, sem deixar de relaciona-las com a situa??o no sonho, em quest?o.     Por exemplo, um unicornio pode ser uma express?o de pureza para a maioria das pessoas. Se ele apare?er entre arvores, isso  refor?ado com a ideia bucolica da natureza. Se ele apare?er correndo em um campo, pode representar liberdade, de uma forma agressiva e decidida, pois ele adiciona um chifre ao cavalo. Dessa forma, sonhar com um unicornio poderia significar stresse e um grande desejo de partir para outra situa??o, ou simplesmente um momento de paz interior.     Ent?o eu diria que de forma geral sonhar com seres miticos pode ter liga??o com um assunto com o qual vc anda lidando muito, tanto de forma direta (filmes, livros, etc) como de forma subjetiva (por meio de uma simbologia) ou tambem uma fuga da realidade (afinal uma liga??o comum para muitas pessoas para mitos seja simples fantasia). Mas como mitos em quest?o j s?o interpreta??es muito especificas de varias quest?es por meio de simbologias, dizer apenas isso seria generico demais.       Seria melhor buscar o significado de um sonho em particular.

f35c9511e4538715e24e634fc1c5b8f1aa	Falando de distancias entre cora??es.      Um dia um pensador indiano fez a seguinte pergunta a seus discpulos;  "Por que as pessoas gritam quando est?o aborrecidas?"  "Gritamos por que perdemos a calma, disse um deles"  "Mas, por que gritar quando a outra pessoa est ao seu lado?"    Questionou novamente o pensador.  "Bem, gritamos porque desejamos que a outra pessoa nos ou?a, retrucou outro discpulo"  "Ent?o n?o  possvel falar-lhe em voz baixa?"  Vrias outras respostas surgiram, mas nenhuma convenceu o pensador.  Ent?o ele esclareceu:  Vocs sabem porque se grita com uma pessoa quando se est aborrecido?  O fato  que, quando duas pessoas est?o aborrecidas, seus cora??es se afastam muito.  Para cobrir esta distancia precisam gritar para poderem escutar-se.  Quanto mais aborrecidas estiverem, mais forte ter?o que gritar para ouvir um ao outro, atravs da grande distancia.  Por outro lado, o que sucede quando duas pessoas est?o enamoradas?  Elas n?o gritam falam suavemente. E por que?  Porque seus cora??es est?o muito perto, a distancia entre eles  pequena.  As vezes est?o t?o prximos seus cora??es, que nem falam, somente sussuram,  e quando o amor  mais intenso, n?o necessitam sequer sussurrar, apenas se olham, e basta seus cora??es se entendem   isso que acontece quando duas pessoas se amam.  Por fim, o pensador conclui dizendo:  Quando vocs discutirem, n?o deixem que seus cora??es se afastem, n?o digam palavras que os distanciem mais,  pois chegar um dia em que a distancia ser tanta que n?o mais encontrar?o o caminho de volta.

Naturalmente, s?o inmeros os ensinos promovidos pelo Diabo para desviar as pessoas da verdade ensinada na Bblia. Se quiser saber mais, contate-me pelo e-mail: cunhafrnnd@oi.com.br    Sem dvida, muitos sacerdotes levam uma vida moralmente casta, mas um grande nmero deles n?o o faz. Segundo o 1992 Britannica Book of the Year, noticiou-se que a Igreja Catlica Romana pagou US$300 milh?es para conciliar casos de abusos sexuais praticados por clrigos. Mais tarde, a edi??o de 1994 disse: A morte de vrios clrigos causada pela Aids trouxe  tona a presen?a de sacerdotes homossexuais e observa??es de haver um nmero descomedido de . . . homossexuais atrados ao sacerdcio. N?o  de admirar que a Bblia declare que proibir o casar-se  ensino de dem?nios. (1 Timteo 4:1-3) No conceito de alguns historiadores, escreve Peter de Rosa no seu livro Vicars of Christ (Vigrios de Cristo), [o celibato sacerdotal] provavelmente contribuiu mais para prejudicar a moral do que qualquer outra institui??o no Ocidente, inclusive a prostitui??o. . . . Na maioria das vezes tem maculado o nome do cristianismo. . . . A imposi??o do celibato sempre tem provocado hipocrisia nas fileiras dos clrigos. . . . O sacerdote pode fraquejar mil vezes, mas pela lei can?nica  proibido casar-se sequer uma vez.    Um abra?o do Jacar.|`|a7eacb444c28222c5f8926e37c232bb5aa	"Mas o Esprito expressamente diz que nos ltimos tempos apostatar?o alguns da f, dando ouvidos a espritos enganadores, e a doutrinas de dem?nios." (I Timteo 4 : 1)  ______________________________________...  A Bblia explica-se a si mesma. Portanto, vejamos alguns versos relacionados:  No mnimo 7 vezes eu encontrei a seguinte express?o:  "Quem tem ouvidos, ou?a o que o Esprito diz s igrejas."  A pesquisa completa est em: http://www.cvvnet.org/cgi-bin/biblia?1-t... (como  muito longa,  melhor olhar no site)    Apocalipse 12:17 Irou-se o drag?o contra a mulher e foi pelejar com os restantes da sua descendncia, os que guardam os mandamentos de Deus e tm o testemunho de jesus; e se p?s em p sobre a areia do mar.|`|40602698900e05d0692fd0a57b6acb49aa	A bblia tb diz :que todo aquele que n?o confessa que Cristo  o Senhor e que veio em carne, esses s?o anti cristo. ent?o toda doutrina que reparte a glria com outros deuses, que n?o cr que Jesus vive, que coloca outros mestre como guias, s?o anti-cristo, e os que s?o "religiosos". por isso devemos conhecer a Deus, ter intimidade com Ele, e n?o h outra forma a n?o ser lendo a palavra dEle, porque quando vc conhece bem uma coisa ningum pode te enganar dizendo outras coisas. Leia a bblia, relacione-se com o Pai, e ningum vai te enganar, porque o Esprito Santo te conduzir a verdade: Jesus.|`|23b7097e1379099ca92b7155b14b0d2caa	H muitas doutrinas, que at s?o fundamentadas,mas que n?o se enquadram s verdades bblicas, por exemplo em Levtico 19:4 diz:  "N?o vos volteis para os DOLOS, nem fa?ais para vs deuses de fundi??o. Eu sou o Senhor vosso Deus." No entanto, muitas doutrinas acolhem a idolatria, sendo que ali diz que n?o  podemos nem  fazer dolos. Tb em APOCALIPSE       9 : 20 : "Os outros homens, que n?o foram mortos por estas pragas, n?o se arrependeram das obras das suas m?os, para deixarem de adorar aos DEM?NIOs, e aos dolos de ouro, de prata, de bronze, de pedra e de madeira, que nem podem ver, nem ouvir, nem andar". A doutrina de dem?nios geralmente n?o prega o arrependimento dos pecados, mas diz, por exemplo, que vc ter outras vidas e que n?o precisa se arrepender agora, vai melhorando, etc. Outro exemplo: em Glatas 1 : 9 diz "Como antes temos dito, assim agora novamente o digo: Se algum vos pregar outro EVANGELHO alm do que j recebestes, seja antema" (reprovado). H doutrinas que pregam outro evangelho, que fazem outro evangelho ( como o de Alan Kardek), no entanto  dito que n?o se pode mudar o evangelho de Cristo,  nem fazer outro texto que o suprima. H muitas outras passagens que condenam prticas como adivinha??o, consulta aos espritos, etc, sobre as quais  aconselhvel que pesquisemos e tomemos conhecimento. O que entendo, portanto,por doutrina de dem?nios  aquela que "d um jeitinho" ou modifica completamente as escrituras sagradas ou at atrapalha. N?o podemos ser ingnuos para n?o acreditarmos em tudo que nos dizem.

A a??o pode custar  igreja R$ 3 milh?es, mais os custos mdicos. Provas foram colhidas na Casa Paroquial e no Stio de Nazar, onde os jovens eram internados. Um dirio e uma pasta intitulada "Contos Homossexuais" foram achados no computador do padre, segundo o procurador Cludio Takeshi Tuda, autor da a??o.    Entre elas, duas tinham cinco e seis anos e uma era deficiente mental. Eram carentes, com histrico de conflito familiar e, na maioria dos casos, foram encaminhadas por tutores.    Processos contra a igreja s?o comuns nos EUA. As arquidioceses de Boston --a mais processada no pas-- e da Califrnia, que pagou US$ 100 mil (R$ 215 mil) a vtimas de pedofilia, foram pressionadas pela opini?o pblica.

A maior parte das riquesas da Igreja Catlica vem dessa poca, outra parte significativa advem do turismo s reas que sobraram, e um percentual significativo de doa??es e dzimos. Mas n?o se pode negar que, ano a ano, suas receitas vem caindo.   A Igreja Catlica relaciona-se com causas mundanas. Ela  a principal defensonra da castidade em substitui??o aos mtodos anticoncepcionais, entre outras quest?es que ela chama "pr-vida". Muito de seu dinheiro  gasto em patrocnio s tais atitudes. Parte do dinheiro que ela arrecada ainda vai para a constru??o de novos templos, ou em miss?es para pases n?o-crist?os, e para a forma??o de sacerdotes (os padres catlicos possuem uma forma??o mais cara que os demais sacerdotes crist?os).   Outra fonte de despesas da Igreja Catlica s?o os internatos, monastrios e conventos, que n?o formam exatamente sacerdotes, e n?o revertem em receitas em momento algum. S?o locais para recolher pessoas que querem viver livres de tenta??es e pecados. Coisa inadmissvel numa empresa, mas que a Igreja faz por uma quest?o de cren?as pessoais de seus organizadores.   N?o podemos esquecer que a Igreja Catlica est caminhando rumo  falncia. H anos ela tem perdido pblico pagante sem diminuir as despesas de forma proporcional. Um exemplo de eficincia na administra??o religiosa s?o justamente as igrejas evanglicas, em especial a Universal do Reino de Deus. Elas conseguem obter uma receita sempre crescente sem aumentar despesas com obras de caridade, solidariedade, etc. Os profissionais animadores de cultos n?o fazem voto de pobreza, mas como possuem participa??o nos lucros possuem um grande comprometimento com a Igreja. Prega??es que salientam a responsabilidade do fiel para com seus pecados, e afastam o consumidor, s?o substitudas por exibi??es, legtimas ou n?o, de milagres, o que atrai o povo e aumenta a receita.|`|08471bb7858e028acba5d5df725ae13eaa	antigamente as igrejas era construidas com luxo e riqueza pq acreditavam que era para agradar a deus, elas eram construidas bem altas para chegar mais perto do ceus, isso eu aprendi na escola, ai o homen evoluiu e hoje ja se sabe que nao  preciso nada de luxo|`|d61ca62cac012bc628b5ee2f1a5a1be8aa	Isso n?o  verdade a Igreja Catlica presta uma grande ajuda a humanidade coisa que outras igrejas n?o fazem exemplo aqui aonde eu moro a minha igreja ajuda uma mulher que nem catlica  e sim da igreja Deus  amor .ent?o n?o fala besteira.

Agora, prepare-se pra chuva de censura religiosa deles..... mas aqui vai meu pensamento:    Concordo que existe uma chance enorme de Deus ser um nico fator de cria??o da Antiga Era. mas pense bem - Quem inventou o computador fomos ns, n?o Deus. Ent?o, pq Satan n?o pode ser criado por alguma outra coisa alm de Deus tb?  N?o se deixe enrolar apenas pelos livros... mas j vi que vc n?o se permite enrolar.....  Deus, na minha opini?o, depois de muito tentar criar algo perfeito, e se cansar de ser adorado por "rob?s", viu que s haveria perfei??o num ser como ele - Um ser que decidisse por si mesmo o que fazer, ou ao menos desejasse tal. Haveria real contentamento, sim , em ver este ser ador-lo SEM SER FOR?ADO A ISSO. Ent?o Deus primeiro criou o Livre Arbtrio dos Seres, e depois os seres em si....  Agora apenas classifique cada tipo de ser enigmtico pelas suas ESCOLHAS, pois todos ns hoje nos tornamos aquilo que escolhemos.    Dem?nio = "Eu decidi praticar o mal"  Anjo = "Eu decidi praticar o bem...."  Ser humano =  "Eu.. Eu n?o sei..... Me ajuda?"    Se podem mudar? Claro oras,  hbito dos sbio mudar de opini?o, e dos copiadores tb.. ^^    Duvido muito que Deus tenha dado Fun??es predefinidas a todos ns! Ele j teria visto que ningum colabora e teria refeito tudo do zero ^^ LIVRE ARBTRIO. Fun??o predestinada e inescapvel  incompatvel com Livre arbtrio.    Ent?o, ao se pegar em duvida sobre as contradi??es do Mundo, sempre se lembre que tivemos e temos o Livre Arbtrio - Que exatamente como a Democracia, pode funcionar... Ou n?o. N?o pense no Livre Arbtrio como apenas seu - Se um desejo n?o se realiza sozinho,  porque o Livre Arbtrio de todos precisa ter o mesmo direito e prioridade. A teia de todos os livres arbtrios infelizmente parece gerar o caos ^^ Leia qualquer Bblia  o quanto quiser, e se for inteligente, encontrar mais perguntas ao invs de respostas diretas.. respostas diretas n?o existem em livros de mitologia, comportamento e filosofia.

Unidos a corpos materiais, eles constituem a Humanidade que povoa a Terra e as outras esferas habitadas; separados do corpo, constituem o mundo espiritual ou dos Espritos que povoam os espa?os. Deus os criou perfectveis; deu-lhes por objetivo a perfei??o, e a felicidade que dela  conseqncia, mas n?o lhes deu a perfei??o; quis que a devessem ao seu trabalho pessoal, a fim de que lhe tivessem o mrito. Desde o instante de sua forma??o, progridem, seja no estado de encarna??o, seja no estado espiritual; chegados ao apogeu, s?o puros Espritos, ou anjos segundo a denomina??o vulgar; de sorte que, desde o embri?o do ser inteligente at o anjo, h ma cadeia ininterrupta, da qual cada elo marca  um grau no progresso.    Disso resulta que existem Espritos em todos os graus de adiantamento moral e intelectual, segundo estejam no alto, embaixo, ou no meio da escala. H Espritos, por conseqncia, em todos os graus de saber e de ignorancia, de bondade e de maldade. Nas classes inferiores, h os que est?o ainda profundamente inclinados ao mal, e que nele se comprazem. Querendo-se, pode-se cham-los de dem?nios, porque s?o capazes de todas as a??es feias atribudas a estes ltimos. Se o Espiritismo n?o lhes d esse nome,  porque se liga  idia de seres distintos da Humanidade, de uma natureza essencialmente perversa, votados ao mal pela eternidade e incapazes de progredirem no bem.    Segundo a doutrina da Igreja, os dem?nios foram criados bons, e se tornaram maus pela desobedincia: s?o os anjos decados; foram colocados por Deus no alto da escala e desceram. Segundo o Espiritismo, s?o Espritos imperfeitos, mas que se melhorar?o; est?o ainda na base da escala e subir?o.    Aqueles que, pela sua indiferen?a, sua negligncia, sua obstina??o e sua m vontade permanecem tempo mais longo nas classes inferiores, disso carregam a pena, e o hbito do mal torna-os mais difcil de sair dele; mas chega um tempo em que se cansam dessa existncia penosa e dos sofrimentos que lhes s?o a conseqncia;   ent?o que, comparando a sua situa??o com a dos bons Espritos, compreendem que seu interesse est no bem, e procuram se melhorar, mas o fazem por sua prpria vontade e sem serem  constrangidos a isso. Eles est?o submetidos  lei do progresso por sua aptid?o em progredir, mas n?o progridem apesar deles. Para isso Deus lhes fornece, sem cessar, os meios, mas s?o livres para aproveitarem ou n?o. Se o progresso fosse obrigatrio, eles n?o teriam nenhum mrito, e Deus quer que tenham o de suas obras; n?o coloca nenhum na primeira classe por privilgio, mas a primeira classe est aberta a todos, e a ela n?o chegam sen?o por seus esfor?os. Os mais elevados anjos conquistaram o seu grau como os outros, passando pela rota comum.    Chegados a um certo grau de depura??o, os Espritos tm miss?es em rela??o com o se adiantamento; eles cumprem todas as que s?o atribudas aos anjos das diferentes ordens. Como Deus criou de toda a eternidade, de toda a eternidade se encontram Espritos para satisfazer a todas as necessidades do governo do Universo. Uma nica espcie de seres inteligentes, submetidos  lei do progresso, basta, pois, para tudo. Essa unidade na cria??o, com o pensamento que todos tm um mesmo ponto de partida, a mesma rota a percorrer, e que se elevam por seu prprio mrito, responde bem melhor  justi?a de Deus, que a cria??o de espcies diferentes, mais ou menos favorecidas de dons naturais que seriam tantos privilgios.    A doutrina vulgar sobre a natureza dos anjos, dos dem?nios e das almas humanas, n?o admitindo a lei do progresso, e vendo, contudo, seres em diversos graus, disso concluiu que eram o produto de tantas cria??es especiais. Ela chega, assim, a fazer de Deus um pai parcial, dando tudo a alguns de seus filhos, ao passo que imp?e aos outros os mais rudes trabalhos. N?o  de se admirar que, durante muito tempo, os homens n?o tenham encontrado nada de chocante nessas preferncias, ent?o que as usavam do mesmo modo em rela??o aos seus filhos, pelos direitos inatos e os privilgios de nascen?a; poderiam crer fazer mais mal que deus?    Mas hoje o crculo das idias se alargou; eles vm mais claro; tm no??es mais limpas da justi?a; querem-na para eles, e se n?o a encontram sempre na Terra, esperam ao menos encontr-la mais perfeita no cu; e aqui est porque  toda doutrina onde a justi?a divina n?o lhes apare?a em sua maior pureza, lhes repugna a raz?o.|`|912910c9e1993f1d7c9ce2c83662c090aa	Deus da o livre arbitrio,e ensina os mandamentos,so e ruim quem quer ser,eu sou bom e assim espero ser ate meus ultimos dias vc escolhe...|`|cce04ec55210b86cedb0edb1318de677aa	Deus criou os seres e Lucifer (como um anjo de Luz).

5271d37756712761c5750194552cecfeaa	Hola yo soy budista y te puedo compartir mi experiencia.    El Buddha Dharma indica que una de las 10 aciones no virtuosas es tomar la vida de otro ser vivo, sin embargo, se reconoce que es imposible no da?ar a alguno.     Simplemente, cada vez que respiramos o caminamos, accidentalmente matamos a millones de microrganismos e insectos como las hormigas. Adems, hay que alimentarnos y aunque se coman slo vegetales, estos siguen siendo seres vivos.    La idea de esta filosofa es respetar a todas las formas de vida en la medida de lo posible, ya que creemos que todos los seres vivios estamos hechos de lo mismo y por eso podemos reencarnar en seres como las hormigas.     Nosotros creemos en el Karma, que se puede traducir como la Ley de la causalidad universal, es decir que todo acto tiene consecuencias. Para que se concrete el karma de matar, tiene que existir lo que ustedes llaman premeditacin, alevosa y ventaja. Adems, el budismo contempla que vivir tiene riesgos y cada forma de vida pose los suyos. Digamos que uno de los riesgos de ser hormiga es que le pisen.     En resumen lo que los budistas proponemos es jams matar concientemente a un ser vivo por demostrar nuestro poder, por la diversin de verlo sufrir, o por motivos destructivos, egoistas o sin sentido.|`|948f07a6197c89b25cd1941ed0eb1e8aaa	entiendo que estas haciendo una broma, y como broma esta buena, es como preguntar como hace un cura pederasta pora decirte que las relaciones extramatrimoniales son pecado,  La respuesta de jorge montes es muy buena porque explica su posturapero te toma muy en serio|`|6069c3d73db9e8d30e3fd286cffacffcaa	los que se cuidan de no matar a los insectos son los monjes jainistas, no los tibetanos. mal chiste.|`|2d29ea7ac28728be4e72df180cec5fb3aa	Usa cesped artificial|`|7092b0898776f458de8a96bdeabcdb0daa	Pues segn su filosofa de vida, el no las mata intencionalmente, sino accidentalmente, en la prctica de las artes marciales, creo yo, que se pone en consideracin, un montn de cosas, el espacio, el aire, los sonidos, los colores, los olores, las vibraciones, pues todos confluyen en una excelente concentracin.

78821eabadaaa2ce8bc80e66a57d58deaa	Hola "sabrinita"!  Yo creo en Dios y mucho, lo amo con todo mi corazn. Es verdad que no podemos verlo con nuestros ojos porque es un ser espiritual, no tiene cuerpo como la gente que nosotros conocemos. Pero s podemos conocerlo, sentirlo, relacionarnos con l de otras maneras. Te estoy hablando desde mi experiencia personal y no desde lo que me hayan contado o lo que pueda haber estudiado.  Yo tuve y tengo experiencias de Dios muy fuertes. No puedo negar que l exista. Me da mucha paz, alegra, esa alegra que aunque te pasen cosas, sos feliz.  Y es cierto, como decs vos que nos pasan cosas. Yo creo que muchas veces es porque no estamos cerca de l, porque queremos hacer lo que a nosotros nos parece, porque no hacemos lo que l nos dice y que en el fondo es lo que va va a hacer que seamos felices. Te pongo un ejemplo: a mi hija chiquita yo no la dejo que se tire a la pileta sola porque no sabe nadar, y por mas que ella quiera hacerlo y llore y patalee, no la voy a dejar, porque s que eso es malo para ella. Con Dios pasa un poco lo mismo. El nos dice que es lo que nos conviene hacer, pero nosotros somos libres de hacerlo o no. Y cuando elegimos distinto de lo que nos propone Dios, es cuando no somos plenamente felices.  Y vos preguntas por qu deja que pasen las cosas que pasan. Es que creo yo que todo tiene que ver con la libertad que tenemos. Somos libres para hacer lo que querramos, Dios no nos va a obligar a hacer nada porque, si lo hiciera, no nos dejara libres. ?Me explico?  Esto que decs que a la gente buena siempre le pasa lo peor, no s si es tan as. Yo creo que a todos nos pasan cosas: a los "buenos" y a los "malos". S es cierto que a a algunos les pasa ms que a otros. No s porque ser.  Y conts que tu abuela se muri de cancer y que era buensima y que crey siempre en Dios. Estoy segura de que va a estar con l; pero a vos te duele que no siga con vos. Y como no crees en Dios, no pods ver lo que vemos con los ojos de la fe: que tu abuela est bien, que est en un lugar mejor, en donde ya no le pasa nada malo, en donde ya no tiene que sufrir; y que te sigue acompa?ando, que sigue estando al lado tuyo, que puede seguir guindote, y que pods seguir "hablando" con ella (aunque ya no te responda como lo haca antes).  Espero que te haya ayudado en algo.  Saludos.|`|d7beeb446a1c2e995731604a621c8281aa	Porque creemos en Su Palabra:La Biblia y en todo esto me baso,     En la ciencia  En la historia  En la ley  En la sabidura  En los testimonios  En la existencia  En las profecas  El amor  En absolutamente t o d o.

Por que no le han hallado un solo error a la Biblia?      18 Porque la palabra de la cruz es locura a los que se pierden; pero a los que se salvan, esto es, a nosotros, es poder de Dios.   19 Pues est escrito: Destruir la sabidura de los sabios, Y desechar el entendimiento de los entendidos.   20 ?Dnde est el sabio? ?Dnde est el escriba? ?Dnde est el disputador de este siglo? ?No ha enloquecido Dios la sabidura del mundo?   21 Pues ya que en la sabidura de Dios, el mundo no conoci a Dios mediante la sabidura, agrad a Dios salvar a los creyentes por la locura de la predicacin. 1 Corintios 1:18-21      22 Porque los judos piden se?ales, y los griegos buscan sabidura;   23 pero nosotros predicamos a Cristo crucificado, para los judos ciertamente tropezadero, y para los gentiles locura;   24 mas para los llamados, as judos como griegos, Cristo poder de Dios, y sabidura de Dios.   25 Porque lo insensato de Dios es ms sabio que los hombres, y lo dbil de Dios es ms fuerte que los hombres.   1 Corintios 1:22-25      PD. Algunas de las preguntas que haces las he respondido anteriormente y s que los verdaderos cristianos tambin te  respondern con sabidura.     Hay mas que decir, pero despus no lo leen porque es mucho.     Puedes tener la seguridad de que tu abuelita est en la presencia de Dios, porque ella CONFIO en EL. Cuando una persona cristiana muere es llevada por una escolta de ngeles a la presencia de Dios. Despues reinar con Cristo mil a?os, depus de eso, la Eternidad  conforme al propsito original de Dios.      Bendiciones|`|8271b77aa17e8c1a5256ee53fe34aeb6aa	Sabrinita es tu derecho en no creer y se respeta. Pero no son algunas personas que creen, son muchisimas un numero incontable. Yo creo en Dios porque el cambio mi vida. Antes andaba mal en pecados y creia que estaba bien. Pero un dia conoci a Dios por medio de Jesucristo. Despues de ese dia todo en mi vida comenzo a cambiar positivamente. Senti que Dios perdono todos mis pecados y comence a vivir para agradarle. Luego le hable a amistades y algunos de ellos lo aceptaron. En los anos que vivo creyendo Dios no me ha fallado, los hombres si me fallan y son injusto. Pero mi confianza esta en Dios. Me han pasado muchas situaciones malas pero gracias a eso voy madurando mas y mi fe crece. Ya no le creo a Dios por lo que el me pueda dar sino por amor Y pase lo que pase le sere fiel.

Con esa solita, tienes para ser una buena persona. Ejemplo. Siembras manzanas, cosechas manzanas, siembras peras, cosechas peras, siembras traicin, eso cosechas, siembras amor, eso cosechas. Y tu forma de ser, nada tiene que ver con lo que las diferentes religiones del mundo han escrito. Simplemente eres y ests hecha a imagen y semejanza de Dios. Otro ejemplo. Eres creador, creadora por naturaleza. Todo lo que piensas, sientes y haces, se manifiesta tarde o temprano, es tu creacin.  La casa que tienes, la creaste en tu mente, le mandaste energa y la casa se manifest fsicamente. As es todo lo dems. Dios es energa. Dios es tan malo o tan bueno, de acuerdo a tu propia creacin. Y si crees en la reencarnacin, muchos males o bienes, los heredamos de vidas pasadas. Hay mucho que decir de Dios, pero no puedo escribir mucho aqui.

CASO seja agnstico, est num meio-termo entre ser ateu e ser testa. O ateu est convicto de que Deus n?o existe, ao passo que o testa nutre firme cren?a de que Deus existe realmente, e que se envolve nos assuntos humanos.    O agnstico n?o acha que existe evidncia suficiente para se afirmar que Deus existe ou n?o. Antes, reserva-se a fazer um ajuizamento definitivo, ou afirma que, se Deus existe, ele  ignorado e incognoscvel.    Possui amigos agnsticos? Ou  vc leitora uma agnstica? Se for, por qu? Talvez ache que o agnosticismo  a posi??o mais razovel a se adotar neste racionalista sculo 21. Se este for o caso, te convido a considerar as palavras de certos homens que ajudaram a moldar o modo de pensar das pessoas deste sculo e a verificar o que criam a respeito de Deus, e por qu. Talvez isso o ajude a entender um pouco melhor as raz?es de suas prprias cren?as.    O termo agnstico (do grego gnostos, ignorado) foi cunhado por Thomas H.?Huxley, cientista britanico do sculo 19, que tambm ajudou a popularizar a teoria darwiniana da evolu??o. Huxley observou que as igrejas afirmavam ter uma gn?sis (conhecimento) especial sobre Deus e a origem das coisas. Ele forneceu uma raz?o pela qual n?o podia aceitar esta gn?sis, e, assim sendo, era agnstico:    Se apenas pudssemos ver, de uma s espiada, as torrentes de hipocrisia e de crueldade, as mentiras, a matan?a, as viola??es de toda obriga??o da humanidade, que fluram desta fonte [as igrejas], no decurso da histria das na??es crist?s, nossas piores imagina??es sobre o Inferno sumiriam diante dessa vis?o.    Sem dvida a f de Huxley na existncia de Deus foi abalada pela aceita??o da teoria da evolu??o. Todavia, a f que nutria foi adicionalmente abalada pela conduta dos que deveriam ter estado em condi??es de ajud-lo, as igrejas. A folha de servi?os delas, no decorrer dos sculos, n?o era nenhuma recomenda??o para a cren?a em Deus.    CERTAMENTE  possvel ter princpios sem crer em Deus.     Esta foi a afirma??o duma pessoa agnstica. Ela disse que havia criado os filhos com elevados valores de moral e que estes, por sua vez, tinham criado os filhos deles com similares normas elevadas ?tudo sem terem f em Deus.    Significa isso que  desnecessrio ter f em Deus?  evidente que esta pessoa achava que sim. E  verdade que nem todos os que n?o crem em Deus necessariamente s?o pessoas ms.     O apstolo Paulo falou a respeito de pessoas das na??es que n?o conhecem a Deus, mas que fazem por natureza as coisas da lei. (Romanos 2:14) Todos, inclusive os agnsticos ?nasceram com uma conscincia. Muitos procuram seguir os ditames da sua conscincia, mesmo n?o crendo no Deus que lhes deu este senso inato do certo e do errado.    No entanto, a f slida em Deus ?baseada na Bblia ? uma for?a muito mais poderosa a favor do bem do que apenas a orienta??o da conscincia.

Abra?o, porm, lhe respondeu: Se n?o ouvem a Moiss e aos Profetas, tampouco se deixar?o persuadir, ainda que ressuscite algum dentre os mortos.    Lucas Capitulo 16 versiculo 19 ao 31.

That is because their are dictatorships and monarchies and other such governments in the middle east where citizens do not have rights. If the governments can constantly blame the USA for their lot in life, well then that is much less attention on the government that continually oppresses its own people. They keep their people in control via fear and anger toward the USA. Since their citizens (via a state controlled media and somewhat state controlled religion) are raised with this anti USA propaganda, it is a hot button that gets pushed especially whenever a segment of the oppressed society starts to get antsy, shall we say. The poor dumb ignorants pour into the streets burning American flags and chanting, and then they all go home feeling like they Had their little outlet. It is all very controlled. I mean, do seriously thing you can keep half the population in Burkas in that heat otherwise?

For this to happen, you must shed the plated armor that covers your heart and let that heart become sensitive to others' sufferings.  Coldness smothers the sentiments of the heart.  Christ, you will notice, never avoided or rebuffed anyone who came looking for Him, no matter who they were.  He helped the adulterous woman and the criminal, and had no thought that His reputation might suffer as a result.  When will you take Him as your model for action?  If loved ruled the earth, evil ones wouldn't prevail.  They would fade away in shame; they would hide themselves.  Everywhere they went, they would feel out of place.  This is how evil will one day simply disappear, and you can be quite sure that this will happen.    Begin by being examples yourselves.  Be compassionate to everyone without distinction, and try not to pay attention to people who show contempt for you.  Leave justice to God, Who separates the wheat from the chaff every day.    Selfishness is a denial of love.  Yet without love, human society would find no rest.  To take the matter a step further, nothing would be safe.  For if selfishness and pride dominated, and they go and in hand, life would be a race in which the winners would always be the most cunning.  It would be a war of personal interests in which the holiest and most delicate feelings would be trampled underfoot, and even family ties would go unrespected.  --Pascal (Sens, 1862)|`|f0a5c1440a8fad39d135e3b21df98e5daa	yes, and not necessarily a common belief, but just a common realization that every religion has its own beliefs and each is entitled to them (except martyrdom of those more fortunate for the supposed glorification of their "god")|`|ea5368811fcb78da5c0cad8f0d0a012faa	i think so.|`|AA12263336	I think religion does matters but not so much, there should be a peace between all peoples.

Hezbollah launches hundreds of rockets into civilian areas and Israel drops leaflets and warnings, even giving Hezbollah fighters the chance to escape.  Instead, Hezbollah surrounds themselves with civilians, digs tunnels under civilian areas, won't let civilians leave, then decries civilian deaths at Israeli hands after Israel strikes specific Hezbollah targets.    Propaganda won't do it any more.  People get both sides of the story (their's, too!) and get ALL the facts.   Is anyone decrying the deliberate targetting of civilians by Hezbollah?    Fortunately, this time, yes.    Covering up?  Nonsense.  You are using the very free speech and media you decry to show this, it is shown on google, in the U.S.A.    Cover up?  Nonsense.

Mas eu vou tentar responder numa boa, se n?o der, desculpe-me pelo menos, eu tentei!     o seguinte: A coisa certa e verdadeira  a que diz a Bblia. O homem ( Ad?o ), foi mesmo o nosso antecessor, antepassado, como queira. Em Gnesis 1:26 est escrito que Deus criou o homem   Sua imagem, conforme  Sua semelhan?a, e em Gnesis 2:7, est escrito que o homem ( Ad?o ), foi feito do p da terra, e que Deus lhe soprou nas narinas o f?lego de vida, ou seja o esprito do homem para que este passasse a ser alma vivente. Somente depois deste acontecimento histrico, e por perceber Deus, que o homem n?o poderia viver s, e trazendo-lhe toda sorte de animais para ver qual o homem escolheria entre eles para lhe servir de auxiliadora, foi que Deus criou a mulher. Portanto a mulher ( Eva ) ou varoa, foi feita n?o do p da terra diretamente, mas da costela de Ad?o - at dizem por ai que os homens tm uma costela a menos que as mulheres - n?o sei se  verdade. A verdade,  que o homem foi criado do p da terra e a mulher de uma parte deste homem, da carne dele, da costela dele - indiretamente do p da terra, pois o homem  feito disso.  Quanto a quest?o de homem ter vindo do macaco,  pura invencionice de cientista maluco que n?o aceita a existncia de Deus, e se aceita, n?o estudou os fatos a fundo, pois, se fosse assim, porque os macacos que hoje conhecemos, n?o evoluram para uma forma humana? Por causa do tempo, n?o isso n?o pode ser, pois o homem como o conhecemos, s tem 6000 anos de existncia, contrariando o que dizem os cientistas que tentam inutilmente afirmar que o homem descendeu de um animal, por isso dizem que pertencemos ao reino animal, o que n?o  verdade. Existiram de fato, criaturas ou seres antes da cria??o do homem, que s?o chamados de seres pr-adamicos, os tais homem de neanderthal, australopythecus e por ai a fora, mas estes nunca foram homens criados  imagem e  semelhan?a de Deus. Somente ns os seres atuais  quem possumos o direito de nos parecermos com Deus. Foi Charles Darwin quem criou toda esta confus?o, mudando radicalmente a histria do mundo, transtornando a cabe?a das pessoas e dando meios pra que o atesmo fosse ainda mais propagado.  Em tempo: Charles Darwin, arrependeu-se em seu leito de morte, de tudo o que havia dito com rela??o  esta quest?o e confessou que n?o cria no evolucionismo e sim no creacionismo. Sentia que havia conturbado a mente dos homens, mexendo de tal maneira catastrfica na histria da humanidade. Um erro sem precedentes. Deus com certeza o perdoou. Mas sabe aquela historinha de que voc pode errar e falhar e ser perdoado, mas dependendo do erro cometido, o resultado pode ser terrvel. "  o mesmo que dizer que os erros, as falhas e pecados s?o como um prego que voc prega na madeira. Ser perdoado  ter retirado o prego da madeira, mas o furo que ele causou ficar na madeira pelo resto da vida; ou seja - Darwin foi perdoado com certeza, mas o seu grave erro n?o encontrou concerto na histria da humanidade".|`|78890c43f740970e4a7f66e041f1b769aa	Concordo com o Fernando|`|53635314e9ba18323d71d76d553dd491aa	Muitos cientistas modernos s?o materialistas. Isto , eles acreditam que a matria fsica  a nica realidade final. Eles presumem que tudo no universo, incluindo a vida, pode ser explicado em termos de intera??o de matria. Materialistas n?o aceitam a existncia de for?as espirituais ou sobrenaturais.     Bilogos que acreditam no materialismo est?o particularmente preocupados em: (a) provar uma origem puramente materialista da vida, e (b) provar que a vida pode ser criada em laboratrio.     A maioria dos cientistas n?o  estritamente materialista. Bioqumico, Dr. Arthur Wilder-Smith:     This article is also available in English: Where did life come from? Is evolution the best scientific answer? English answer...       "A vida anda sobre a matria, e a matria tem de ser altamente organizada para carregar vida. Os materialistas dizem que a vida, uma vez que  feita de tomos, molculas e rea??es qumicas,  simplesmente apenas qumica e nada mais - e que a vida originou-se por rea??es qumicas acidentais.   Agora, se a vida consiste de simples qumica, e nada alm de qumica, a melhor maneira de compreender suas reais potencialidades  olhar para algumas substancias qumicas da vida. E ns veremos que N?O  uma mera quest?o de qumica." [115]     Foi o famoso cientista e criacionista francs, Pasteur, quem providenciou a primeira evidncia cientfica de que seres vivos n?o s?o produzidos a partir de matria sem vida. [116] Durante a Idade Mdia, algumas pessoas pensavam que a matria sem vida freqentemente dava origem a seres vivos (gera??o espontanea). Pensava-se que vermes, insetos, ratos e outras criaturas eram geradas pelos materiais presentes em seu meio ambiente.     gera??o espontanea: a idia de que criaturas vivas podem ser produzidas naturalmente a partir de matria bruta. [117]  importante notar que a cincia nunca observou tal ocorrncia. [118]            Todas as coisas vivas passam a existir a partir dos pais.                          Todas as criaturas tm um pai de algum tipo. Todas as instru??es est?o no cdigo de DNA do pai. No momento da concep??o, o cdigo de DNA passa a trabalhar, usando os nutrientes para construir uma pessoa inteira; corpo, crebro e personalidade humanos a partir de uma simples clula-ovo fertilizada.      Ningum jamais encontrou um organismo que nunca teve algum tipo de pai. Hoje, esse  um dos fatos mais aceitos na biologia. Todas as criaturas vivas s?o produzidas por um ou mais pais. Surpreendentemente, contudo, muitas pessoas modernas ainda acreditam fielmente em uma forma de "gera??o espontanea."   Materialistas assumem que a vida surgiu espontaneamente no meio aqutico da Terra primitiva - gua que n?o continha absolutamente nenhuma vida, apenas minerais e substancias qumicas usadas pelos seres vivos. [119]     Porque o oxignio na atmosfera destruiria toda possibilidade de vida surgindo por processos naturais, os materialistas erroneamente assumem que a atmosfera n?o possua oxignio. [120] Eles tambm assumem que a atmosfera continha certos ingredientes necessrios, incluindo am?nia, nitrognio, hidrognio, vapor de gua e metano. [121] Entretanto,  bem sabido que a mistura desses ingredientes n?o cria vida. Ent?o, materialistas teorizaram que algo mais seria necessrio - talvez uma descarga de energia. [122]     Cientistas Tentam Criar Vida      Dr. Miller com seu famoso aparelho. Cientistas tm falhado completamente ao tentar produzir vida em tubos de ensaio. At esta data, todas as tentativas de provar que a vida poderia ter surgido na Terra por qualquer meio natural tambm tm falhado. (Foto da srie de vdeo ORIGINS.)        O Dr. Stanley Miller e o Dr. Sidney Fox foram dois dos primeiros cientistas a realizar experimentos laboratoriais com o propsito de tentar provar que a vida poderia surgir espontaneamente. Eles projetaram um aparelho de pyrex contendo metano, am?nia, e vapor d'gua, mas sem oxignio. Por essa mistura eles passaram descargas eltricas para simular choques de relampagos. [123]     Qual foi o resultado? Nenhuma vida foi produzida,  claro, mas a eletricidade combinou alguns tomos para formar aminocidos.           aminocidos: compostos que s?o as mais simples unidades a partir das quais as protenas s?o formadas. [124]  Os experimentos de Miller/Fox provaram que a vida poderia eventualmente ter aparecido em algum oceano antigo atingido por relampagos? N?o, seus resultados de fato enfraqueceram o caso. A mistura de aminocidos e outros simples produtos qumicos produzidos n?o  correta para produzir vida. Todas as formas de vida conhecidas usam aminocidos que s?o exclusivamente levgiros (do tipo "m?o esquerda"). [125]           Molculas levgiras: um termo usado para se referir  "estereoqumica" da constru??o da molcula. Um aminocido pode ser quimicamente levgiro (m?o esquerda) ou dextrgiro (m?o direita) em sua orienta??o. Essas duas formas s?o idnticas em seus tomos, mas opostas em seu arranjo tridimensional. Uma  como a imagem da outra no espelho. [126]        Nenhuma forma de vida conhecida pode usar uma combina??o de ambos "m?o esquerda" e "m?o direita" aminocidos. Adicionar sequer um aminocido de "m?o direita" a uma cadeia de "m?o esquerda" pode destruir toda a cadeia! [127] Quando aminocidos s?o sintetizados em laboratrio, h sempre uma mistura de 50% das duas formas. Apenas atravs de processos altamente avan?ados e inteligentemente controlados essas duas formas podem ser separadas.                At mesmo se esse insupervel obstculo n?o existisse, outros problemas bem maiores restariam para a produ??o de vida.

E, se eu for e vos preparar lugar, virei outra vez, e vos tomarei para mim mesmo, para que onde eu estiver estejais vs tambm.   Os anjos prometeram que Jesus viria de novo. A Bblia diz em Atos 1:10-11 Estando eles com os olhos fitos no cu, enquanto ele subia, eis que junto deles apareceram dois var?es vestidos de branco, os quais lhes disseram: Var?es galileus, por que ficais a olhando para o cu? Esse Jesus, que dentre vs foi elevado para o cu, h de vir assim como para o cu o vistes ir.   Como regressar Jesus? A Bblia diz em Lucas 21:27 Ent?o ver?o vir o Filho do homem em uma nuvem, com poder e grande glria.   Quantos o ver?o quando Ele vier? A Bblia diz em Apocalipse 1:7 Eis que vem com as nuvens, e todo olho o ver, at mesmo aqueles que o traspassaram; e todas as tribos da terra se lamentar?o sobre ele. Sim. Amm.   Que veremos e ouviremos quando Ele voltar? A Bblia diz em 1 Tessalonicenses 4:16-17 Porque o Senhor mesmo descer do cu com grande brado,  voz do arcanjo, ao som da trombeta de Deus, e os que morreram em Cristo ressuscitar?o primeiro. Depois ns, os que ficarmos vivos seremos arrebatados juntamente com eles, nas nuvens, ao encontro do Senhor nos ares, e assim estaremos para sempre com o Senhor.   Qu?o visvel vai ser a Sua Vinda? A Bblia diz em Mateus 24:27 Porque, assim como o relampago sai do oriente e se mostra at o ocidente, assim ser tambm a vinda do filho do homem.   Como nos preveniu Jesus para que n?o sejamos enganados sobre a Sua Segunda Vinda? A Bblia diz em Mateus 24:23-26 Se, pois, algum vos disser: Eis aqui o Cristo! ou: Ei-lo a! n?o acrediteis; porque h?o de surgir falsos cristos e falsos profetas, e far?o grandes sinais e prodgios; de modo que, se possvel fora, enganariam at os escolhidos. Eis que de antem?o vo-lo tenho dito. Portanto, se vos disserem: Eis que ele est no deserto; n?o saiais; ou: Eis que ele est no interior da casa; n?o acrediteis.   Algum sabe a hora exata da Sua vinda? A Bblia diz em Mateus 24:36 Daquele dia e hora, porm, ningum sabe, nem os anjos do cu, nem o Filho, sen?o s o Pai.   Sabendo qu?o humano  adiar tudo, que nos diz Cristo que devemos fazer? A Bblia diz em Mateus 24:42 Vigiai, pois, porque n?o sabeis em que dia vem o vosso Senhor.   Como nos preveniu Jesus para que n?o sejamos surprendidos por este acontecimento? A Bblia diz em Lucas 21:34-36 Olhai por vs mesmos; n?o aconte?a que os vossos cora??es se carreguem de glutonaria, de embriaguez, e dos cuidados da vida, e aquele dia vos sobrevenha de improviso como um la?o. Porque h de vir sobre todos os que habitam na face da terra. Vigiai, pois, em todo o tempo, orando, para que possais escapar de todas estas coisas que h?o de acontecer, e estar em p na presen?a do Filho do homem.   Porqu que Jesus est demorando tanto? A Bblia diz em 2 Pedro 3:8-9 Mas vs, amados, n?o ignoreis uma coisa: que um dia para o Senhor  como mil anos, e mil anos como um dia. O Senhor n?o retarda a sua promessa, ainda que alguns a tm por tardia; porm  longanimo para convosco, n?o querendo que ningum se perca, sen?o que todos venham a arrepender-se.   Enquanto esperamos por Jesus, como devemos viver a nossa vida? A Bblia diz em Tito 2:11-14 Porque a gra?a de Deus se manifestou, trazendo salva??o a todos os homens, ensinando-nos, para que, renunciando  impiedade e s paix?es mundanas, vivamos no presente mundo sbria, e justa, e piamente, aguardando a bem-aventurada esperan?a e o aparecimento da glria do nosso grande Deus e Salvador Cristo Jesus, que se deu a si mesmo por ns para nos remir de toda a iniqidade, e purificar para si um povo todo seu, zeloso de boas obras.   Como estar o mundo quando Jesus regressar? A Bblia diz em Mateus 24:37-39 Pois como foi dito nos dias de No, assim ser tambm a vinda do Filho do homem. Porquanto, assim como nos dias anteriores ao dilvio, comiam, bebiam, casavam e davam-se em casamento, at o dia em que No entrou na arca, e n?o o perceberam, at que veio o dilvio, e os levou a todos; assim ser tambm a vinda do Filho do homem.   Ser a Vinda de Cristo uma altura para recompensas? A Bblia diz em Mateus 16:27 Porque o Filho do homem h de vir na glria de seu Pai, com os seus anjos; e ent?o retribuir a cada um segundo as suas obras. A Bblia diz em Apocalipse 22:12 Quem  injusto, fa?a injusti?a ainda: e quem est sujo, suje-se ainda; e quem  justo, fa?a justi?a ainda; e quem  santo, santifique-se ainda.   Porqu Jesus regressar? A Bblia diz em Hebreus 9:28 Assim tambm Cristo, oferecendo-se uma s vez para levar os pecados de muitos, aparecer segunda vez, sem pecado, aos que o esperam para salva??o.   Na Segunda Vinda de Cristo, finalmente teremos a completa realidade da nossa salva??o. A Bblia diz em 1 Corntios 1:7-8 De maneira que nenhum dom vos falta, enquanto aguardais a manifesta??o de nosso Senhor Jesus Cristo, o qual tambm vos confirmar at o fim, para serdes irrepreensveis no dia de nosso Senhor Jesus Cristo.

Deus  o Criador. A Bblia diz em Gnesis 1:1 No princpio criou Deus os cus e a terra.   Deus revela-se a si mesmo atravs da cria??o. A Bblia diz em Salmos 19:1 Os cus proclamam a glria de Deus e o firmamento anuncia a obra das suas m?os.   A cria??o aponta em direc??o da existncia de Deus e da nossa responsabilidade com rela??o a Deus. A Bblia diz em Romanos 1:20 Pois os seus atributos invisveis, o seu eterno poder e divindade, s?o claramente vistos desde a cria??o do mundo, sendo percebidos mediante as coisas criadas, de modo que eles s?o inescusveis.   Deus criou o mundo com a Sua Palavra. A Bblia diz em Salmos 33:6, 9 Pela palavra do Senhor foram feitos os cus, e todo o exrcito deles pelo sopro da sua boca. Ele ajunta as guas do mar como num mont?o; p?e em tesouros os abismos. Tema ao Senhor a terra toda; temam-no todos os moradores do mundo. Pois ele falou, e tudo se fez; ele mandou, e logo tudo apareceu.   Deus criou o mundo em seis dias. A Bblia diz em xodo 20:11 Porque em seis dias fez o Senhor o cu e a terra, o mar e tudo o que neles h, e ao stimo dia descansou; por isso o Senhor aben?oou o dia do sbado, e o santificou.   Atravs de quem criou Deus todas as coisas? A Bblia diz em Colossenses 1:16 Porque Nele [o Filho de Deus] foram criadas todas as coisas nos cus e na terra, as visveis e as invisveis, sejam tronos, sejam domina??es, sejam principados, sejam potestades; tudo foi criado por Ele e para Ele. Jo?o 1:3 Todas as coisas foram feitas por intermdio dele, e sem ele nada do que foi feito se fez.   Qual foi o propsito de Deus em criar a Terra? A Bblia diz em Isaas 45:18 Porque assim diz o Senhor, que criou os cus, o Deus que formou a terra, que a fez e a estabeleceu, n?o a criando para ser um caos, mas para ser habitada: Eu sou o Senhor e n?o h outro.   Como criou Deus habitantes para o mundo por Ele criado? A Bblia diz em Gnesis 2:7, 21-22 E formou o Senhor Deus o homem do p da terra, e soprou-lhe nas narinas o f?lego da vida; e o homem tornou-se alma vivente. Ent?o o Senhor Deus fez cair um sono pesado sobre o homem, e este adormeceu; tomou-lhe, ent?o, uma das costelas, e fechou a carne em seu lugar; e da costela que o senhor Deus lhe tomara, formou a mulher e a trouxe ao homem.   Em que imagem foi o homen criado? A Bblia diz em Gnesis 1:27 Criou, pois, Deus o homem  sua imagem;  imagem de Deus o criou; homem e mulher os criou.   A que posi??o foi o homem destinado por Deus? A Bblia diz em Gnesis 1:26 E disse Deus: Fa?amos o homem  nossa imagem, conforme a nossa semelhan?a; domine ele sobre os peixes do mar, sobre as aves do cu, sobre os animais domsticos, e sobre toda a terra, e sobre todo rptil que se arrasta sobre a terra. Salmos 8:3-6 Quando contemplo os teus cus, obra dos teus dedos, a lua e as estrelas que estabeleceste, que  o homem, para que te lembres dele? e o filho do homem, para que o visites?

O obscurantismo do processo da cria??o do Universo vem instigando a inteligncia humana a formular vrias hipteses a respeito.A Cincia progride a passos largos e o pensamento religioso deve acompanhar a soma destes novos conhecimentos. N?o adianta as religi?es enfiarem a cabe?a num buraco, tal qual as avestruzes, ignorando o que est ocorrendo em volta.  O notvel cientista Albert Einstein lan?ou, em 1905, a Teoria da Relatividade, que revolucionou todo o conhecimento cientfico sobre o Universo, que prevalecia na poca. O Espa?o e o Tempo, tidos como matrias abstratas, passaram a ser realidades concretas, sujeitas s influncias de for?as fsicas. Mais recentemente surgiu a teoria da cria??o do Universo atravs de uma formidvel explos?o - "Big-Bang" - de toda matria altamente concentrada, que teria ocorrido h, aproximadamente, 20 bilh?es de anos. O Tempo e o Espa?o n?o seriam eternos e infinitos como se pensava, mas teriam surgido no mesmo instante da grande explos?o. O Universo, portanto, seria finito, tanto no tempo como no espa?o. Assim, n?o haveria sentido em especular sobre o tempo antes do momento da cria??o do Universo, porque, simplesmente, o tempo n?o existia. Estima-se que o planeta Terra tenha se formado h bem menos tempo: cerca de 4,5 bilh?es de anos.  Infelizmente, a grande complexidade desses estudos, dificulta, em muito, o seu conhecimento para a maioria das pessoas. No entanto,  importante que, pelo menos, se tenha  no??o do posicionamento do nosso mundo no espa?o sideral. O planeta Terra pertence a um sistema planetrio que tem uma estrela-sol como centro. Entretanto, nossa estrela-sol pertence a uma galxia (Via-Lctea) que, por sua vez, contm outras 100 bilh?es de estrelas-sis, cada qual, com possveis sistemas planetrios. Por sua vez, nossa galxia integra um Universo que contm bilh?es e bilh?es de outras galxias, cada qual com bilh?es e bilh?es de estrelas-sis e, conseqentemente, com bilh?es e bilh?es de outros sistemas planetrios, contendo bilh?es, bilh?es e bilh?es de planetas. Isso tudo, sem considerar a hiptese de que a Cincia, atravs da teoria dos colapsos gravitacionais - "Buracos ******" -, assinala a existncia de outros Incontveis universos!  Diante de tanta grandiosidade, ainda existem pessoas que pensam que o homem  o soberano e nico ser pensante deste Universo.  Coerente com a lgica, a Doutrina Esprita sempre proclamou a pluralidade de mundos habitados, conclus?o esta que fatalmente a Cincia ir confirmar brevemente.  O surgimento da vida na Terra tambm  motivo de polmicas. Dentro da escala evolutiva das espcies, proposta por Charles Darwin, em 1859, estima-se que as primeiras formas rudimentares de vida teriam surgido h 3,5 bilh?es de anos; os peixes, a cerca de 500 milh?es de anos; os anfbios, cerca de 325 milh?es de anos; os rpteis, cerca de 300 milh?es de anos; os mamferos, cerca de 200 milh?es de anos e as aves, cerca de. 180 milh?es de anos.  A Cincia, at o momento, tambm n?o conseguiu desvendar por completo, o momento e o local onde surgiu o espcime que pode se considerado como, efetivamente, o elemento da atual ra?a humana.O espcime "australapithecus", homindea de forma animalesca antecessor do gnero humano, data de cerca d 4 milh?es de anos. O "Homo Halis", considerado o primeiro espcime pr-humano a utilizar rudimentares ferramentas de pedras, viveu h cerca de 2 milh?es de anos. O "Honro Erectus", um pouco mais evoludo, viveu h cerca de l milh?o e 500 mil anos. O "Honro Sapiens", j corri razovel grau de inteligncia, viveu h Cerca de 250 mil anos. Finalmente o "Honro Sapiens Sapiens", que possua a mesma anatomia do homem atual, data de, apenas, 50 mil anos.  A Cincia atual estima que o Homem primitivo deve ter surgido em algum ponto da escala evolutiva situado entre o "Honro Erectus" e o "Honro Sapiens". Obviamente, as datas e as classifica??es aqui mencionadas n?o podem ser tomadas com rigor absoluto, embora possuam certo consenso cientifico. Este  um campo no qual tanto a Cincia como a Doutrina Esprita ainda tem muita a revelar.  Deve ser ressaltado que, em princpio, a Teoria da Evolu??o das Espcies, proposta por Darwin, se harmoniza perfeitamente com o que prega a Doutrina Esprita. O conhecimento da cronologia da cria??o do Universo e da evolu??o da vida nos permite um entendimento maior sobre o caminho evolutivo percorrido pelo esprito, magistralmente sintetizado por Lon Denis: a Alma dorme na pedra, sonha no vegetal, agita-se no animal e acorda no Homem. A espcie humana, portanto, continua em constante evolu??o em todos os sentidos: fsico, moral e espiritual.  Como vemos, apesar do progresso cientifico, as quest?es e as incertezas ainda s?o muitas, mas a Cincia continua a avan?ar de forma inexorvel. E n?o h duvidas, como afirma Djalma Motta Argollo, que o prximo milnio presenciar o encontro do cientista com a realidade do Esprito e, conseqentemente, com a Divindade.|`|25093b29d956ea57069b790f613fbe79aa	Acho que a sua pergunta poderia ser formulada de outra forma.

A FINALIDADE DA CRlA??O DO UNIVERSO   Todas as vezes que Deus criou uma nova espcie na cria??o, disse que aquilo "era bom" (Gn 1.4-31). Isto indica que Deus queria que toda a Sua cria??o fosse bons objetos. Isto tambm  porque Deus queria sentir felicidade sempre que olhasse para Sua cria??o.   Como, ent?o, deveria ser Sua cria??o a fim de fazer feliz a Deus? Depois de ter criado o universo, Deus finalmente criou o homem segundo Sua imagem, seguindo o modelo de Seu prprio carter, com tremendo potencial. O homem devia desfrutar e apreciar sua posi??o de objeto de Deus. Por isso, quando Deus criou Ad?o e Eva, deu-lhes as trs grandes bn??os: de frutificar, multiplicar e encher a terra e, subjug-la e ter domnio (Gn 1.28). Se o homem tivesse seguido as palavras desta bn??o, tornando-se feliz no reino celeste de Deus, Deus teria sentido muita felicidade.   Como deveriam ter sido realizadas as trs grandes bn??os de Deus? Isso teria sido possvel somente com o fundamento de quatro posi??es, se o fundamento bsico da Cria??o, tivesse sido realizado. A finalidade de Deus ao criar o universo era sentir felicidade, vendo a finalidade do bem realizada no reino celeste, reino este que toda a Cria??o incluindo o homem, poderia ter estabelecido, depois de terem completado o fundamento de quatro posi??es centralizado em Deus, realizando Suas trs grandes bn??os.   Conseqentemente, a finalidade da existncia do universo, centralizado no homem,  devolver alegria a Deus, o Criador. Todo ser tem uma finalidade dual. Como j foi explicado, toda existncia tem tanto carter como forma; conseqentemente sua finalidade  dupla. Uma finalidade pertence ao carter interno, e a outra,  forma externa. O relacionamento entre as duas  exatamente idntico ao do carter e da forma de qualquer ser individual. A finalidade pertencente ao carter interno  para o todo, ao passo que a finalidade pertencente  forma externa  para o indivduo. Em outras palavras, o primeiro e o ltimo relacionam-se entre si como causa e efeito, interno e externo, sujeito e objeto. Por conseguinte, n?o pode haver qualquer finalidade do indivduo separada da finalidade do todo, nem qualquer finalidade do todo que n?o inclua a do indivduo. As criaturas de todo o universo formam um vasto complexo ligado entre si por tais finalidades duais.   2. O OBJETO DO BEM PARA A ALEGRIA DE DEUS   Para entendermos mais precisamente as quest?es com respeito  finalidade da cria??o de Deus, devemos primeiro examinar como se produz alegria. N?o se pode criar alegria somente pelo indivduo. A alegria vem quando temos um objeto, quer seja invisvel, quer seja visvel, no qual nosso carter e forma prprios s?o refletidos e desenvolvidos, possibilitando-nos assim sentir nosso prprio carter e forma, pela estimula??o derivada do objeto.   Por exemplo: O homem sente alegria como criador somente quando ele tiver um objeto, isto , quando ele v o produto de seu trabalho, seja uma pintura, seja uma escultura, no qual seu plano est substancializado. Desta forma, ele se torna capaz de, objetivamente, sentir seu prprio carter e forma atravs da estimula??o derivada do produto de seu trabalho. Quando a prpria idia permanece na posi??o objetiva, a estimula??o derivada dela n?o  substancial; por isso, a alegria derivada dela tambm n?o pode ser substancial. A alegria de Deus  produzida do mesmo modo que a do homem. Portanto, Deus sente alegria quando sente Seu carter e forma originais objetivamente, atravs da estimula??o derivada de Seu objeto substancial.   J explicamos que, quando o Reino celeste estiver substancializado atravs da realiza??o das trs grandes bn??os no fundamento de quatro posi??es, isto formar o objeto perfeito, pelo qual Deus poder sentir alegria. Estudemos como isto pode formar o objeto perfeito para a alegria de Deus.   A primeira bn??o de Deus para o homem era para aperfei?oar sua individualidade. Para que o homem aperfei?oe sua individualidade, sua mente e seu corpo, que s?o a forma dividida das essencialidades duais de Deus, devem tornar-se unidas atravs da a??o de dar e receber entre si. Assim elas formam um fundamento individual de quatro posi??es, centralizando-se em Deus. O homem cuja mente e corpo tiverem formado o fundamento de quatro posi??es da natureza original, centralizada em Deus, tornar-se- o templo de Deus (I Co 3.16) e formar um s corpo com Ele (Jo 14.20). Isto significa que o homem atinge a deidade. Sentindo exatamente o que Deus sente e conhecendo a vontade de Deus, viver exatamente como Deus deseja que ele viva. O homem, com sua individualidade assim aperfei?oada, tem perfeito dar e receber entre sua mente e seu corpo. Ao unir-se, sua mente e corpo formam o objeto substancial de Deus. Nesse caso, Deus torna-se feliz, pois pode sentir objetivamente Seu prprio carter e forma, atravs da estimula??o vinda de tal objeto substancial. A mente do homem, como sujeito, sente a mesma coisa com rela??o a seu corpo. Por isso, depois de realizar a primeira bn??o de Deus, o homem torna-se um bom objeto para a alegria de Deus. O homem de individualidade perfeita sente tudo o que Deus sente, como se os sentimentos de Deus fossem dele mesmo. Conseqentemente, ele n?o pode fazer coisa alguma que cause sofrimento a Deus. Isto significa que tal homem jamais pode cair.   Para que o homem possa realizar a segunda bn??o de Deus, originalmente Ad?o e Eva, os objetos substanciais de Deus divididos, depois de terem aperfei?oado suas respectivas individualidades, refletindo assim plenamente as essencialidades duais de Deus, deveriam tornar-se marido e mulher para formar uma s unidade, multiplicar-se pela procria??o de filhos e estabelecer o fundamento de quatro posi??es em um nvel de famlia, centralizado em Deus. Toda famlia ou sociedade em que tal fundamento de quatro posi??es centralizado e|`|ba02c5deaf741c29792204be3698bfe8aa	 difcil dizer mas eu ainda acredito na evolu??o|`|48c710e3faccc964fdb1c2b64f99f5b5aa	acredito na evolu??o!    A quest?o do primeiro homem, Ad?o, ter sido a nica fonte que originou a humanidade n?o  o nico ponto sobre o qual as cren?as religiosas tiveram que se modificar. O movimento da Terra pareceu, em certa poca, de tal modo oposto ao texto bblico que n?o houve forma de persegui??o da qual essa teoria n?o tenha sido o pretexto e, entretanto, a Terra gira, apesar dos antemas5, e ningum hoje poderia contest-lo sem depreciar a sua prpria raz?o e submeter-se ao ridculo.     A Bblia diz igualmente que o mundo foi criado em seis dias e fixa a poca da cria??o por volta de 4 0006 anos antes da Era Crist?. Antes disso, a Terra n?o existia, ela foi tirada do nada; o texto  formal,  claro.     Mas, eis que a cincia positiva, a cincia inabalvel, vem provar o contrrio. A forma??o do globo est gravada em caracteres ntidos e indiscutveis no mundo fssil 7, e est provado que os seis dias da cria??o representam perodos que podem constituir-se, cada um, de centenas de milhares de anos. Isso n?o  um sistema, doutrina, ou opini?o isolada;  um fato t?o constatado quanto o movimento da Terra, que a teologia8 n?o pode recusar-se a admitir, prova evidente do erro em que se est sujeito a cair por tomar ao p da letra as express?es de uma linguagem freqentemente figurada. Devemos por isso concluir que a Bblia est errada? N?o. Mas podemos concluir que os homens, em muitos pontos, se enganaram ao interpret-la.     A cincia, ao escavar os arquivos da Terra, descobriu a ordem em que os diferentes seres vivos apareceram na sua superfcie, e essa ordem est de acordo com a que  indicada na Gnese9, com a diferen?a de que toda a Cria??o, em vez de ter sado miraculosamente das m?os de Deus em algumas horas, conforme est escrito no Gnese, se realizou sempre pela Sua vontade, mas de acordo com a lei das for?as da natureza, em alguns milh?es de anos. Deus  por isso menor e menos poderoso? Sua obra  menos sublime por n?o ter o prestgio da instantaneidade? Evidente que n?o. Seria preciso fazer da Divindade uma idia bem mesquinha para n?o reconhecer Seu grande poder nas leis eternas que estabeleceu para reger os mundos. A cincia, longe de diminuir a obra divina, mostra-a sob um aspecto mais grandioso e mais em conformidade com as no??es que temos do poder e da majestade de Deus, em raz?o de ter se realizado sem anular as leis da natureza.   Eis aqui, porm, alguma coisa que o  menos. Admitindo-se que o homem tenha aparecido pela primeira vez na Terra 4.000 anos antes do Cristo e que, 1650 anos mais tarde, toda a ra?a humana foi destruda, com exce??o de uma s famlia, resulta que o povoamento da Terra data apenas de No, ou seja: de 2.350 anos antes da nossa era. Ora, quando os hebreus emigraram para o Egito, no dcimo oitavo sculo, encontraram esse pas muito povoado e j bastante adiantado em civiliza??o. A Histria prova que, nessa poca, as ndias e outros pases tambm estavam florescentes, sem mesmo se ter em conta a cronologia de certos povos, que remonta a uma poca muito mais afastada. Teria sido preciso, nesse caso, que do vigsimo quarto ao dcimo oitavo sculo, isto , que num espa?o de 600 anos, n?o somente a posteridade de um nico homem houvesse podido povoar todos os imensos pases ent?o conhecidos, suposto que os outros n?o o fossem, mas tambm que, nesse curto lapso de tempo, a espcie humana houvesse podido elevar-se da ignorancia absoluta do estado primitivo ao mais alto grau de desenvolvimento intelectual, o que  contrrio a todas as leis antropolgicas.

Cioe`, dov'e` la discrepanza? La filosofia, e spero che sia una scienza della cognizione umana, puo` spiegare l'esistenza di un Creatore intelligente. Fin qui. Poi avanti con la scienza, che di problemi non ve ne sono. Big Bang o qualsiasi modo di creare l'universo va benissimo. Anche (mia idea), la creazione dell'uomo da parte di evoluzione da scimmie o come preferisci. Anche costruzione dell'uomo da una precedente civilta` sparita nello spazio. Anche la presenza di tanti ceppi umani o simili all'uomo ed esseri estraterrestri intelligenti o non, non conosciuti dai terrestri. Tutto va bene per una CAUSA prima dell'universo intero: questa Causa prima e` Dio. Gli accessori imparati dalle religioni, dimenticali !  Non sei satanista? Non aver paura che non c'entra niente.

Por isso, leia e se prove (ou n?o) a voc mesmo, a existncia de Deus    O universo funciona com leis matemticas, leis cientficas exatas, perfeitas e harm?nicas.    Esta harmonia funcional da natureza Berkeley, Descartes, e Spinoza atriburam a Deus. N?o acredita? Ent?o vejamos (os dados a seguir s?o do cientista americano Bert Thompson - Ph.D.):    1) A temperatura do interior do Sol calcula-se ter 20 milh?es de graus centgrados (Lawton, 1981, 89[1]: 102). Porm, a Terra  localizada a distancia correta do Sol para receber a quantia exata de calor e radia??o para sustentar a vida como ns conhecemos. Se a Terra fosse movida s 10% para mais perto do Sol (aproximadamente 150 mil km), haveria absorvidas muito calor e radia??o. Se a Terra fosse movida 10% mais longe do Sol, pouco calor seria absorvido. Qualquer altera??o implicaria destrui??o para a vida na Terra.     2) A Terra est girando em seu eixo a 1,6 km/h no equador, e no Sol a 112, 65 km/h (aproximadamente 30 m/s), enquanto o Sol e seu sistema solar est?o se movendo pelo espa?o a 965.61 km/h em uma rbita t?o grande que levaria mais de 220 milh?es de anos para completar uma nica rbita. Porm, de maneira interessante como os movimentos de Terra em sua rbita ao redor do Sol, ns vemos que, se f?ssemos ficar meio centmetro mais pertodo Sol seramos incinerados e se ficssemos meio centmetro mais longe seramos congelados ( Sumrio de Cincia, 1981, 89[1]: 124). A Terra  equilibrada a uns 386,24 km da Lua cuja gravidade produz mars de oceano. Se a Lua fosse movida s 1 quinto para mais perto da Terra, as mars seriam t?o enormes que duas vezes por dia elas alcan?ariam de 10-15 metros acima da superfcie da Terra.     3) O que aconteceria se a taxa de rota??o da Terra fosse cortada ou dobrada? Se fosse diminuda, as esta??es seriam dobradas em sua dura??o, o que causaria um severo calor  e severo frio na Terra que seria difcil, se n?o impossvel, cultivar bastante comida para alimentar a popula??o da Terra. Se a taxa de rota??o fosse dobrada, a dura??o de cada esta??o seria cortada, e seria difcil ou impossvel de cultivar bastante comida para alimentar a popula??o da Terra. A Terra  inclinada em seu eixo a exatamente 23.5 graus. Se ela assim n?o fosse, muito da gua do planeta se acumularia num s ponto deixando outros desrticos. Se a atmosfera que cerca a Terra fosse mais tnue, os meteoritos poderiam acertar nosso planeta com maior for?a e freqncia e poderiam causar devasta??o mundial.     4) Os oceanos provem um reservatrio enorme de umidade que constantemente est evaporando e est condensando caindo assim na terra como chuva.  um fato famoso que o calor da gua esfria-se a muito taxa mais lenta que uma massa de terra slida que explica por que regi?es desrticas podem ser quente de dia e fria  noite. Porm, gua segura sua temperatura mais tempo, e d um sistema natural de resfriamento para as reas da Terra. Extremos de temperatura seriam muito mais irregulares que eles s?o, a despeito do fato que aproximadamente 3/4 da superfcie da terra s?o de gua. Alm disso, os humanos e animais inalam oxignio e exalam gs carb?nico. Por outro lado, as plantas absorvem gs carb?nico e exalam oxignio. Ns dependemos do mundo da botanica para nossa provis?o de oxignio, mas freqentemente n?o percebemos que aproximadamente 90% de nosso oxignio vem de plantas microscpicas nos mares (veja Asimov, 1975, 2:116). Se nossos oceanos fossem um pouco menores, ns n?o poderamos respirar.     Pode-se pensar que estas circunstancias adequadas  vida foram criadas s "por acidente"? A Terra est a distancia certa do Sol; a distancia certa da Lua; tem o diametro certo; tem a press?o atmosfrica certa; tem a inclina??o certa; tem a quantia certa de gua oceanica; tem o peso certo e massa ; e assim por diante. Ao ver esses fatos e outros com rela??o  vida, a idia que eles tinham surgidos s por acidente seria imediatamente descartado como absurdo. Mesmo assim, os ateus e agnsticos sugerem que o Universo, a Terra, e vida na Terra sejam resultado de acidentes. O fsico John Gribbin (1983), escrevendo sobre as numerosas exigncias necessrias para a vida em nosso planeta, enfatizado em grande detalhe a natureza e a essncia dessas exigncias, curiosamente escolheu chamar seu artigo de "a Parte Afortunada da Terra"como se toda a precis?o, mtodo, e desgnio complicado no Universo pudessem ser explicados dizendo que a Terra simplesmente recebeu, por acidentes csmicos, uma "Chance Afortunada".    Como acabamos de ver, o acaso (que quer dizer "sem causa") n?o pode ser causa de nada e o universo s pode ser obra de uma for?a criadora, de uma inteligncia suprema a qual chamamos de Deus.  .|`|28657677083eb0faee13af2019ed4203aa	a existencia de Deus e uma questao de fe,se vc acredita ele existe se vc nao acredita ele nao existe p vc e claro.Mas uma grande prova da existencia de  Deus e o propio ser humano,leia um livro de medicina por exemplo q vc vai ver como  complexo o funcionamento dos nossos orgaos como coracao,rins,olhos,cerebro etc.Ao contrario de q muitos imaginam muitos cientistas acreditam em Deus,eles veem Deus quando nao conseguem uma resposta p sua pergunta.Entao eles dizem existe uma forca maior q criou isto,e esta forca e DEUS|`|676ca7a4ca48599c048d221cf10702f1aa	n?o d pra provar o que n?o existe|`|effe808ebad6b155a64d3f73656b22b2aa	Ningum pode provar,sei que ele ja me salvou de varias veses de situa?oes de morte...|`|eb4f50359753682afb1cd25b0627757aaa	Se Deus n?o existe,quem foi q pregou as jaboticabas no tronco da rvore???|`|a5dcac44d98fc9a7dabdecef13f6f000aa	Posso provar, desde que a pessoa que deseja que eu prove, esteja realmente interessada em descobrir a verdade e n?o de tentar iniciar uma polmica, defendendo a todo custo uma convic??o contrria.

Assim sendo, eu espero que voce entre em contato comigo, via e-mail, e poderemos conversar, um pouco por vez, para que voce possa ter tantas quantas forem necessrias, as provas de que O Senhor  Deus, e que esse mesmo Deus  Perfeito Criador.

Through Him all things were created, the character of God is revealed, the salvation of humanity is accomplished, and the world is judged. Forever truly God, He became also truly man, Jesus the Christ. He was conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary. He lived and experienced temptation as a human being, but perfectly exemplified the righteousness and love of God. By His miracles He manifested God's power and was attested as God's promised Messiah. He suffered and died voluntarily on the cross for our sins and in our place, was raised from the dead, and ascended to minister in the heavenly sanctuary in our behalf. He will come again in glory for the final deliverance of His people and the restoration of all things.

Para entender o problema da encarna??o tem que entender o sentido na vida, de onde viemos o que viemos fazer aqui e para onde vamos. Ja falei em outras ocasi?es que ns n?o somos esse monte de carne e osso, ns somos a imagem e semelhan?a de Deus, ou seja, Espirito de Luz ( N?o confundir com o mesmo termo usado no espiritissimo )  esse Espirito que nasce e continuar nascer, esse corpo fisico que pensamos ser ns,  apenas um veiculo de espress?o desse Epirito na Terceira Diemns?o. Esse Espirito na condi??o de Filhos de Deus, sendo sua Imagem e semelhan?a temos no outro Espirito ( Somos aproxidamente 40 bilh?es de Espiritos, sendo que 6,5 bilh?es encarnardos e o resto por encarnar ) um irm?o, o que acontece no Plano Fisico n?o interfere nessa condi??o, no instante em que o corpo fisico fica sem vida, acabou ali,  como um filme, onde um ator vive vrios personagens sem se confundir com nenhum deles, acabado o filme ele parte para outro,  assim somos ns, e quando digo ns, n?o me refiro ao corpo fisico e sim ao Espirito, esse sim,  o verdadeiro Eu. Na nossa cultura, conhecemos esse Espirito como alma, na verdade  um equivoco, porque alma  uma das varias partes que forma o Espirito. Portanto  esse Espirito que veio de Deus,  esse Espirito que se encarna varias vezes e esse espirito n?o tem filhos, nem tios, etc.etc. etc. Ele tem t?o somente Irm?os que s?o outros que somam esses 40 bilh?es.

d372918aa0bd2d31225e0cbc1b0f22d5aa	I found mine, and I am sure that he is the one.    When you find your twin flame you cannot imagine ever being with anyone else. You feel suddenly incomplete in a way you never felt before.    You simply must be with them. You find yourself caring about nothing else.    And if you don't get together with that person, you may be happy, but only marginally so. Your happiness will be limited, a weak compromise.    I had had someone else in my life who was a regular soul mate. When I reconnected with my twin flame, he knocked my soul mate off the playing board.    I'd researched it on the web: a twin flame is the soul mate you'd been married to (or with romantically) the most number of times in the most past lives.    A soul mate can be another close relationship -- sibling, parent, etc, not necessarily a romantic partner.    If you hurt your twin flame, or he hurts you, it is a mortal wound.    That's one reason I know for sure about mine -- I hurt him so badly years ago before I knew he was my twin (I was 20), I'm not sure he'll give me a second chance.    I also knew when I reconnected with him over the phone. I heard his life in his voice -- his disappointments, everything. It was frightening.    I felt a kind of psychic reverb when I said "it's you", in another context. I knew that he knew the double meaning, and so did I.    Really weird, but I was sure.    Here's Wikipedia's answer:    Soulmate  From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia  (Redirected from Twin flame)    Soulmate (or soul mate) is a term sometimes used to designate someone with whom one has a feeling of deep affinity, friendship, love, strong intimacy, sexuality, or compatibility.    A related concept is that of the twin flame or twin soul - thought to be the ultimate soulmate, the one and only other half of one's soul, for which all souls are driven to find and join.    However, not everyone who uses these terms intends them to carry such mystical connotations; they are sometimes used simply as an expression of strong emotional feeling for someone.    Definitions  Classical - Greek mythology - Originally humans were combined of 4 arms, 4 legs, and a single head made of 2 faces, but Zeus feared their power and split them all in half, condemning them to spending their lives searching for the other half to complete them. This theory was first explained in Plato's Symposium.    Spiritual and religious - concepts of reincarnation and karma. Soulmates have spent many previous lifetimes together.    Companion soulmate - People with whom one has made a connection.    Twin soulmates - Very close friends with whom one has strong bonds.    Twin flame soulmate - A popular romantic belief that there is only one true soulmate.    Scientific Soulmate - (If) a relationship can be quantified, and scored according to an internal happiness scale. A scientific soulmate is the person with whom you are the absolute happiest. You would therefore be less happy with any other person in existence.    Balance Partners and Messengers Balance Partners are the people you meet along the way who help you create balance in your life.[1]    Concepts   The neutrality of this article is disputed.  Please see the discussion on the talk page.     New Age concept of Soulmate    There is a prevalent concept in some segments of the New Age movement that some "souls" are literally made and/or fated to be the mates of each other, or to play certain other important roles in each others' lives. These souls are thought to have created something in a past life and they have chosen this lifetime to help each other "heal." Following this concept, one can have many soul mates. For example: One could see another person they have never met in this lifetime and instantly hate or love them because of previous interaction(s) with the other in one or more previous lifetimes. The most popular use of this concept is in applying it to those who were loved intimately in other lifetimes which were then found in this one.    Also, being conscious of the "soul mate connection" is not necessary, according to this idea.    Soulmate Emotional Destruction Theory    Ultimately the consequence of this notion is the unfortunate reality that soulmates often possess the ability to inflict serious emotional injury unto their twin flame, greater than any other being could. This often results in the separation of idealized love, due to the severe emotional impact. Many soulmates are destined for an eternal search, not for lack of meeting, but rather lack of acceptance. The encounter is often analogous to the collision of matter and anti matter, a violent explosive will occur, but if held through to completion only pure energy, and thus harmony, will result. Unfortunately few encounters are held through to completion.|`|c5684c1eea9174757697f60cf1f073b2aa	i try not to think of a twin flame but many sparks from one fire  we can have many people in our life that are just meant to be there... who we can learn from and love  so try to broaden your view to all those beautiful sparks and not just a little flame xx|`|AA10710172	The taste of the pudding is in the eating - it is said. So when you know deep within your heart that the twin flame is echoing the beat of your heart - do what Shakespeare said " grapple what friends thou hast with hoops of steel". Then first experience the many flavours of love like laughter and happiness and elation at the friends accomplishments and by and by you will be sure that it is time to move on in love and put the wedding band on the others finger .. and 'tis done!  Always remember it is said "Marry in haste and repent at leisure"  All the best

Ti rispondo in modo molto semplice, secondo la mia modesta opinione;  dicono che l' erba cattiva, non muoia mai, e forse  cos; e dicono anche che Dio, sceglie gli esseri pi speciali, per tenerli accanto a se in un meraviglioso mondo;  Credo che possa accadere di morire a 18 anni per errore(manovre sbagliate del vicino o sue),  ma credo anche che molto spesso le persone pi speciali, siano anche, quelle che ci lasceranno prima delle altre.  Se Dio lo voleva con se cos presto, b di   certo era il suo destino, e forse gli ha dato la possibilit, di lasciare questa vita accanto alla persona che pi amava.  Io voglio pensare e mi auguro con tutto il cuore per il tuo giovane amico, che sia proprio cos, che la sua morte sia stata per rinascere, e non per errori umani.|`|4ee1c282fb4305e4b3557176a692041baa	No, il destino non esiste, secondo me ed  questo che deve farti trovare dentro di te la forza di reagire a questa perdita terribile, che al momento ti sembra devastante. Ma ora non cercare di scacciare il tuo dolore e la tua delusione, piuttosto ascoltali e buttali fuori. Hai tutto il diritto di stare male e di esternare qualcosa che senti come troppo grande per te.  Ma poi cerca di riacquistare la fiducia in una vita che non  assolutamente scritta in cielo n in nessun altro posto, perch tu non sei una pedina nelle mani di una forza occulta, ma una persona che ha la capacit di modificare le cose, se ci crede. Chairamente non tutto pu andar bene e ci sono sempre cose che sfuggono al nostro controllo, ma perch dipendono dalla casualit (non dal destino) o da altre persone, ma ci che  nelle tue mani lo puoi fare, devi trovare il coraggio di farlo.

In certi momenti  normale pensare a certe cose, ma credo che se hai voglia di fare cose grandi ci devi provare a prescindere dal destino, forse esiste o forse no, l'unica certezza e che non ci  dato conoscerlo. Per questo motivo si dovrebbe vivere ogni giorno al massimo rivalutando ogni singolo istante della nostra vita. Prega per il tuo amico se sei credente, lui sar sempre vicino a te. Anch'io ho perso un amico in giovane et, non passa giorno che io non pensi a lui anche se sono passati ormai 10 anni.

Sai, nella bibbia c' scritto che ogni cosa ha il suo tempo (Ecclesiaste), c' un tempo per ridere, c' un tempo per piangere, c' un tempo per soffrire, c' un tempo per vivere e c' un tgempo per morire. C' un tempo per ogni cosa. Ecco perch Dio ci ha raccomandato di ravvederci, perch noi non sappiamo l'ora della nostra morte. I pesci, per esempio, non sanno quando verranno pescati, perch  sempre all'improvviso.  Detto questo, rimane da dire che Dio non  causa del male, ma permette che avvenga il male (Libro di Giobbe), affinch, queste sono le parole di Ges, l'uomo sia provato. Questo  capitato, non insegner nulla al tuo amico, te lo scrivo con tristezza, ma insegna qualcosa a tutti noi che rimaniamo qui.

d427c53307ccfdc3c2045ed2328a2835aa	A tradi??o do coelho da Pscoa foi trazida  Amrica por imigrantes alem?es em meados de 1700. O coelhinho visitava as crian?as, escondendo os ovos coloridos que elas teriam de encontrar na manh? de Pscoa.     Uma outra lenda conta que uma mulher pobre coloriu alguns ovos e os escondeu em um ninho para d-los a seus filhos como presente de Pscoa. Quando as crian?as descobriram o ninho, um grande coelho passou correndo. Espalhou-se ent?o a histria de que o coelho  que trouxe os ovos. A mais pura verdade, algum duvida?     No antigo Egito, o coelho simbolizava o nascimento e a nova vida. Alguns povos da Antigidade o consideravam o smbolo da Lua.  possvel que ele se tenha tornado smbolo pascal devido ao fato de a Lua determinar a data da Pscoa.     Mas o certo mesmo  que a origem da imagem do coelho na Pscoa est na fertililidade que os coelhos possuem. Geram grandes ninhadas!|`|29b347b9749df89fac2378b2b85df9c6aa	A Histria do coelhinho da Pscoa e os ovos     A figura do coelho est simbolicamente relacionada  esta data comemorativa, pois este animal representa a fertilidade. O coelho se reproduz rapidamente e em grandes quantidades. Entre os povos da antiguidade, a fertilidade era sin?nimo de preserva??o da espcie e melhores condi??es de vida, numa poca onde o ndice de mortalidade era altssimo. No Egito Antigo, por exemplo, o coelho representava o nascimento e a esperan?a de novas vidas.     Mas o que a reprodu??o tem a ver com os significados religiosos da Pscoa? Tanto no significado judeu quanto no crist?o, esta data relaciona-se com a esperan?a de uma vida nova. J os ovos de Pscoa (de chocolate, enfeites, jias), tambm est?o neste contexto da fertilidade e da vida.

O coelho simboliza a fertilidade na mitologia grega e  conhecido como "coelho da Pscoa" no norte da Alemanha h cerca de cem anos. O coelho tambm  o animal sagrado atribudo tanto a Afrodite, a deusa do amor dos romanos, como a Ostara. O hbito teria surgido, segundo Franckenau, h mais de 300 anos na Alscia (Fran?a), no Palatinado e no Alto Reno (Alemanha). Como os lpidos coelhos e lebres se multiplicam na primavera - a Pscoa cai na primavera no Hemisfrio Norte - os padrinhos teriam inventado uma ca?ada ao coelho, na qual as crian?as encontravam os ovos coloridos escondidos nos parques e jardins.

A Bblia diz em Mateus 9:37-38 Ent?o disse a seus discpulos: Na verdade, a seara  grande, mas os trabalhadores s?o poucos. Rogai, pois, ao Senhor da seara que mande trabalhadores para a sua seara.   O evangelismo  um trabalho para todos os Crist?os em todo o mundo. A Bblia diz em Mateus 28:19-20 Portanto ide, fazei discpulos de todas as na??es, batizando-os em nome do Pai, e do Filho, e do Esprito Santo; ensinando-os a observar todas as coisas que eu vos tenho mandado; e eis que eu estou convosco todos os dias, at a consuma??o dos sculos.   Compartilhar Jesus Cristo com outros deve ser parte do nosso estilo de vida. A Bblia diz em Colossenses 1:26-29 O mistrio que esteve oculto dos sculos, e das gera??es; mas agora foi manifesto aos seus santos, a quem Deus quis fazer conhecer quais s?o as riquezas da glria deste mistrio entre os gentios, que  Cristo em vs, a esperan?a da glria; o qual ns anunciamos, admoestando a todo homem, e ensinando a todo homem em toda a sabedoria, para que apresentemos todo homem perfeito em Cristo; para isso tambm trabalho, lutando segundo a sua eficcia, que opera em mim poderosamente.   As Boas Novas devem ser pregadas em toda a parte antes de Jesus voltar. A Bblia diz em Mateus 24:14 E este evangelho do reino ser pregado no mundo inteiro, em testemunho a todas as na??es, e ent?o vir o fim.   N?o precisa ser sofisticado, ou ter muitos diplomas para compartilhar Jesus Cristo com outros. A Bblia diz em 1 Corntios 2:1-5 E eu, irm?os, quando fui ter convosco, anunciando-vos o testemunho de Deus, n?o fui com sublimidade de palavras ou de sabedoria. Porque nada me propus saber entre vs, sen?o a Jesus Cristo, e este crucificado. E eu estive convosco em fraqueza, e em temor, e em grande tremor. A minha linguagem e a minha prega??o n?o consistiram em palavras persuasivas de sabedoria, mas em demonstra??o do Esprito de poder; para que a vossa f n?o se apoiasse na sabedoria dos homens, mas no poder de Deus.   Deus nos chama a ser representantes de Jesus. A Bblia diz em 2 Corntios 5:20 De sorte que somos embaixadores por Cristo, como se Deus por ns vos exortasse. Rogamo-vos, pois, por Cristo que vos reconcilieis com Deus.   Evangelismo  falar sobre Cristo, mas  tambm ser um modelo da verdade. A Bblia diz em Marcos 16:15 E disse-lhes: Ide por todo o mundo, e pregai o evangelho a toda criatura. . A Bblia diz em Jo?o 13:35 Nisto conhecer?o todos que sois meus discpulos, se tiverdes amor uns aos outros.   Evangelismo  mais que pregar e dar testemunho. A Bblia diz em Isaas 61:1 O Esprito do Senhor Deus est sobre mim, porque o Senhor me ungiu para pregar boas-novas aos mansos; enviou-me a restaurar os contritos de cora??o, a proclamar liberdade aos cativos, e a abertura de pris?o aos presos.|`|7e4d0eb42aa9a49edc6a5f450f6555d2aa	Vc acha inteligente generalizar as pessoas que vc nem conhece?

Normalmente o que acontece  que a maioria dos religiosos, principalmente os evanglicos, s?o totalmente leigos e n?o sabem o ponto de parada, normalmente o que o pastor ou padre diz  lei. Ent?o eles querem a todo custo que vc acredite no mesmo q eles, pois  isso que eles acreditam ser verdade absoluta. Na verdade isso  mais uma quest?o de educa??o do que realmente de religi?o. Nossos colegas que responderam e dizem n?o ser chatos  pq s?o mais inteligente e consequentemente mais racionais, ent?o conseguem discernir certas coisas, n?o enchendo o saco de quem n?o quer ouvir, na verdade, n?o fazendo descer goela a baixo o que n?o interessa. S?o mais espertos, incutem as coisas em nossa mente devagar... com conceitos verdadeiros e com amor. Algumas vezes eles tbm enchem o saco pq gostam de coisas diferentes de ns e acham que temos obriga??o de gostar das mesmas coisas pq  o q Bblia diz. Usam o livro sagrado como arma, isso est errado. Sou evanglica agora, e isto observo sempre, a maioria dos crist?os ou catlicos fervorosos quer usar a Bblia como arma e acabam conseguindo o contrrio do que desejavam. Mas esta filosofia est mudando, aos poucos est?o percebendo que est?o perdendo pessoas e n?o as ganhando. Com o tempo as coisas tendem a mudar.|`|1c71b8ac465a2afa9770c1ac4b0b6f26aa	Olha, voc n?o pode generalizar as coisas,  triste saber que existem pessoas que pensam assim ao nosso respeito.

S?o apenas outras pessoas, com pensamentos, ideias ou comportamentos diferentes de voc.    A percep??o que voc tem sobre outros,  um fator interno, relacionado ao seu psique. Portanto o mundo  para voc, apenas o que voc consegue ver.    O azul que que voc v, n?o representa o mesmo em outro cerebro, as outras pessoas tambem tm cerebro, ou cora??o como alguns preferem.    Cada individuo tem uma percep??o nica do mesmo mundo em que vivemos.    A medida em que voc for crescendo, as suas proprias concp??es ir?o mudando, e aquilo que voc acha "legal" hoje, se tornar diferente, o mesmo podendo ocorrer com as coisas "chatas".    A unica certeza da vida  a morte. Voc ir trilhar um caminho at por fim encontr-la. Neste caminho voc encontrar pessoas.    Aproveite ao mximo o convivio com essas pessoas, porque ao fim, voc ver,  s o que importa.    O espirito que te norteia agora, foi o mesmo que fundamentou a escravid?o dos povos derrotados em guerras, a chacina dos incas, dos maias, dos amerindios, a persegui??o aos judeus, a guerra entre protestantes e catlicos, as fogueiras da inquisi??o.    A "Cincia" n?o  mais que uma cren?a, uma tentativa de entendermos o universo que se estende para fora de ns mesmos, o ateismo tambem.    Ou?a a opini?o dos que te rodeiam e exija o direito de expressar a sua. A isto chamamos democracia e liberdade de express?o, milhares morreram por este ideal.

Na capital paulista, o curso acabou sendo acolhido pelo Convento S?o Francisco, um edifcio de taipa construdo por volta do sculo XVII. As primeiras turmas formadas continham apenas 40 anos. De l para c, nove Presidentes da Repblica e outros inmeros escritores, poetas e artistas j passaram pela escola do Largo S?o Francisco, incorporada  USP em 1934.

Como a alma, que n?o alcan?ou a perfei??o durante a vida  corporal, pode acabar de se depurar?   Submetendo-se  prova de uma nova existncia.    Como a alma realiza essa nova existncia?  pela sua  transforma??o como Esprito?   A alma, ao se depurar, sofre sem dvida uma transforma??o, mas para isso  preciso que passe pela prova da vida corporal.    A alma tem, portanto, que passar por muitas existncias  corporais?   Sim, todos ns temos muitas existncias. Os que dizem o  contrrio querem vos manter na ignorancia em que eles prprios se encontram. Esse  o desejo deles.    Desse princpio parece resultar que a alma, aps ter deixa-  do um corpo, toma outro, ou seja, reencarna em um novo corpo.  assim que se deve entender?   Evidentemente.    Qual  o objetivo da reencarna??o?   Expia??o, melhoramento progressivo da humanidade. Sem isso, onde estaria a justi?a?    O nmero de existncias corporais  limitado ou o Esprito  reencarna perpetuamente?   A cada nova existncia, o Esprito d um passo no caminho do  progresso. Quando se libertar de todas as suas impurezas, n?o tem mais necessidade das prova??es da vida corporal.    O nmero de encarna??es  o mesmo para todos os Espritos?   N?o; aquele que caminha rpido se poupa das provas. Todavia, essas encarna??es sucessivas s?o sempre muito numerosas, porque o progresso  quase infinito.    Em que se torna o Esprito aps sua ltima encarna??o?   Esprito bem-aventurado;  um Esprito puro.    Em que se baseia o dogma da reencarna??o?   Na justi?a de Deus e na revela??o, e repetimos incessantemente: um bom pai deixa sempre para seus filhos uma porta aberta ao arrependimento. A raz?o n?o vos diz que seria injusto privar, para sempre, da felicidade eterna todos aqueles cujo aprimoramento n?o dependeu deles mesmos?  N?o s?o todos os homens filhos de Deus? S homens egostas podem pregar a injusti?a, o dio implacvel e os castigos sem perd?o. Todos os Espritos est?o destinados  perfei??o, e Deus lhes fornece os meios de alcan?-la pelas prova??es da vida corporal. Mas, na Sua justi?a, lhes permite cumprir, em novas existncias, o que n?o puderam fazer, ou acabar, numa primeira prova.  N?o estaria de acordo nem com a igualdade, a justi?a, nem com a bondade de Deus condenar para sempre os que encontraram, no prprio meio em que viveram, obstculos ao seu melhoramento, independentemente de sua vontade. Se a sorte do homem estivesse irrevogavelmente fixada aps a morte, Deus n?o teria pesado as a??es de todos numa nica e mesma balan?a e n?o agiria com imparcialidade.  A doutrina da reencarna??o, que consiste em admitir para o ho-  mem diversas existncias sucessivas,  a nica que responde  idia que fazemos da justi?a de Deus em rela??o aos homens que se acham numa condi??o moral inferior; a nica que pode nos explicar o futuro e firmar nossas esperan?as, porque nos oferece o meio de resgatar nossos erros por novas prova??es. A raz?o nos demonstra essa doutrina e os Espritos a ensinam.  O homem que tem conscincia de sua inferioridade encontra na  doutrina da reencarna??o uma esperan?a consoladora. Se acredita na justi?a de Deus, n?o pode esperar achar-se, perante a eternidade, em p de igualdade com aqueles que agiram melhor do que ele. Contudo, o pensamento de que essa inferioridade n?o o exclui para sempre do bem supremo que conquistar mediante novos esfor?os o sustenta e lhe reanima a coragem. Quem  que, no trmino de sua caminhada, n?o  lamenta ter adquirido muito tarde uma experincia que n?o pode mais aproveitar? Porm, essa experincia tardia n?o est perdida; tirar proveito dela numa nova vida. (O Livro dos Espritos, de Allan Kardec)    A REENCARNA??O EST NA BBLIA  Autor: Carlos Csar Barro    Jesus Cristo havia subido ao monte Tabor com trs de seus discpulos para orar: Pedro, Thiago e Jo?o. Chegando ao topo, o Mestre se transfigura perante os apstolos e eis que aparecem junto deles Moiss e Elias, j falecidos h centenas de anos, que conversam com o Senhor. Depois, Ele e seus seguidores desceram da pequena eleva??o e se envolvem no dilogo que colocamos ao lado.  Nas Escrituras Sagradas, mais precisamente no livro de Malaquias, h uma profecia afirmando que antes da vinda do Messias, o profeta Elias deveria novamente retornar. Sem entend-la direito, os Escribas e os Fariseus, religiosos da poca e inimigos de Jesus, apegavam-se nela para afirmarem que o Mestre n?o era o Filho de Deus, pois n?o tinham visto a Elias.  Indagado sobre a vinda do profeta, Jesus responde que ele j havia nascido, e que ningum o tinha reconhecido. Ent?o, os apstolos compreenderam que se tratava de Jo?o Batista, a quem o Mestre se referia.  Em outra passagem anterior  citada, Jesus tambm afirma que Jo?o era Elias : ...Porque todos os profetas e a lei profetizaram at Jo?o. E se quereis dar crdito,  este o Elias que havia de vir. Quem tem ouvidos para ouvir, ou?a (Mateus 11: 13 a 15).  Jo?o Batista era primo de Jesus, filho de Izabel e Zacarias.  importante n?o confundir este Jo?o com o apstolo do mesmo nome, chamado o Evangelista. O Batista come?ou a pregar no deserto, onde morava. Vestia-se de pele de animais e comia mel silvestre e gafanhotos. Sua prega??o era muito enrgica, conclamando o povo a seguir os ensinamentos morais das Escrituras.

b266ee5c193ec4459bd2886dd19dd68caa	As ChrisW said, it is an adaptation of the Thelemic "Do what you Wilt shall be the whole of the Law" but the "harm none" part wasn't added on to appease mundanes.  In fact "harm none" doesn't mean not to cause harm, not exactly.  Not causing any harm is pretty much impossible.  Every action we do has the potentional to cause inadvertent harm to someone else.  What it really deals with is personal Will.    The "Do as thou Wilt" part involves seeking out your true Will, your higher self if you will, your true purpose and following that purpose to the best of your abilities.  The "An it harm none" part means that while you are seeking out your own Will, you should try your best not to impose on the Will of others...let them find their own purpose, their own Way, don't interfere.  This is why most Wiccans look down on evangelizing.    The Rede for the most part has been misinterpreted nowadays, mainly to appease the mundanes.  Quite frankly though most Wiccans I know are generally not going to "turn the other cheek" when attacked.    Still other Wiccans don't see the Rede so much as a law, but merely as a piece of advice that you may or may not follow, and some change "Harm none" to "harm least" meaning that they should strive to cause as little harm as possible.|`|4c874e283dd92b6b16b07e3f459300f8aa	Wackos|`|9fa1adb1c8a5e488f13a34915c1381ceaa	Its actually an adaptation of Aliester Crowley's "Do as thou wilt shall be the whole of the law."

If you wish to have a precise and true knowledge concerning God and Religion please read the Holy Books of Baha'u'llah, the Messenger of the One true God for our time, at the Gutenberg Project.    "The divine Prophets have revealed and founded Religion. They have laid down certain laws and heavenly principles for the guidance of mankind. They have taught and promulgated the knowledge of God, established praiseworthy ethical ideals and inculcated the highest standards of virtues in the human world. Gradually these heavenly teachings and foundations of reality have been beclouded by human interpretations and dogmatic imitations of ancestral beliefs. The essential realities which the Prophets labored so hard to establish in human hearts and minds while undergoing ordeals and suffering tortures of persecution, have now well nigh vanished. Some of these heavenly Messengers have been killed, some imprisoned; all of Them despised and rejected while proclaiming the? reality of divinity. Soon after Their departure from this world, the essential truth of their teachings was lost sight of and dogmatic imitations adhered to.  Inasmuch as human interpretations and blind imitations differ widely, religious strife and disagreement have arisen among mankind, the light of true Religion has been extinguished and the unity of the world of humanity destroyed. The Prophets of God voiced the spirit of unity and agreement. They have been the founders of divine reality. Therefore if the nations of the world forsake imitations and investigate the reality underlying the revealed Word of God they will agree and become reconciled. For reality is one and not multiple.

Belief is usually defined as a conviction to the truth of a proposition without its verification, therefore it is a subjective mental interpretation of the perception results, own contemplation/reasoning or communication.    there are two ways which I define "real" as:  1. To make it happen by following scientific ways. (I do, therefore I am) For example: boiled water is hot because I used my hand to touch and test it.  2. To make it happen by believeing it. (I believe, therefore I am)  For example, boiled water is not hot for me because it is just my body, my soul said that it is not hot! (Since you believe in soul or superpower.)    Same situation, you can have totally two different elaborations.  Which one is real?

La prima  quella ufficiale:  No, odio leggere la bibbia, perch propone una visione del mondo antiscientifica, lassista, buonista, che porta alla rassegnazione e non alla lotta, che rimanda la verit a dio e non a chi la verit la deve cercare. Aggiungo che non amo la bibbia, anche perch designa un popolo eletto e maledice gli altri (e poi parlate male della jihad islamica), condanna i diversi (omosessuali prima di tutti). Infine ti dico che odio leggere la bibbia anche perch quelli come te che credono contenga tanta speranza mi hanno insegnato a disprezzare la sua dose di saggezza fatta di rassegnazione e di umilt fatta di umiliazione.  Poi l'altra risposta: amo leggere la bibbia, uno dei libri )e non ho scritto sacri) pi antichi in assoluto, ricco di miti e leggende affascinanti, di usi linguistici eccezionali e di rimandi all'arte e alla filosofia. Basta pensare agli incredibili collegamenti coi presocratici, con la cultura babilonese... e poi i Vangeli sono fra i primi romanzi... Insomma, la bibbia per me  un bellissimo libro, ma se aggiungete la parola sacro, o sapienzale, sono pronto a bruciarla.|`|cef406b71f2b3f7fc150e47062f07d04aa	se hai ben pochi motivi per essere tranquillo,prendi un calmante,esci un po' piu' spesso di casa.certo essere tranquilli sull'avvenire dopo aver letto un libro mi lascia un po' basito.non sei piu' tranquillo quando ti senti pronto di affrontare il mondo con le tue mani?e come un bambino che si addormenta con una bella favola.il fatto e' che biancaneve non esiste.e' vero che per affrontare la vita ci vuole spiritualita',ma per campare ci vuol vender cara la pelle quando siamo in mezzo agli altri.io non potri difendermi dietro ad un libro,posso difendermi dietro al conforto della famiglia,dietro al calore dei miei amici,dietro l'amore della mia donna,dietro alla voglia di vivere che ho.la bibbia come libro non lo giudico perche' non ho mai approfondito,ma come "libro rimane nei miei confronti.la tua tranquillita' fai comunque bene a cercarla dove piu' ti senti rassicurato.salute..

I (subject) might as well do (verb phrase) it (subject). Passive voice usually starts with the object. It (object) might as well be done (verb phrase). It is generally used when the speaker wants to avoid identifying the doer of the action or when the doer is unknown. For example, "The money was stolen".      From your question, it seems that you may be confusing modals (may, might, should, etc.) and adverbs (rather) with passive voice structure. Usually with a passive voice sentence you can add "by someone" on the end and the sentence will make sense. For example "The money was stolen (by the boy)".|`|3a48e4258c4ed215b18428c77ebe4446aa	No|`|AA11632704	The passive is used to talk about objects / people that cannot do something for itself / himself. e.g a book cannot read itself, so a book has to be read.

A histria de moeda na China havia enormes influncias na cultura monetria oriental.     Segunda a forma da moeda, a histria monetria antiga chinesa  dividida em 4 fases:     1. A fase de moedas de conchas, desde a Comunidade Primitiva at a Dinastia Shang (do sculo 16 ao sculo 11, Antes de Cristo).   2. A fase de moedas Dao Bu, no Perodo da Primavera e do Outono, e no Perodo dos Reinos Rivais (770-221, Antes de Cristo).   3. A fase de moedas da forma redonda com um furo quadrado no centro, da Dinastia Qin (221-207, Antes de Cristo)  Dinastia Qing (1644-1911).   4. A fase de moedas da forma redonda sem furo, feitas  mquina, desde o final da Dinastia Qing (1644-1911) at o Perodo de Min Guo(1912-1949).

Penso que nosso dever  evoluirmos como seres humanos conscientes e auxiliarmos Deus fazendo nossa parte, em manter em harmonia e paz este maravilhoso planeta, humanidade e universo, come?ando por nossa prpria vida, que deve ser conscientemente vivida e fundamentada em princpios ticos e espiritualizados, sem fechar-se na estreiteza da incompreens?o de dogmas.   N?o penso que Deus seja o juiz que muitos acreditam ser, que fica registrando o que fazemos de bom ou de ruim para depois nos julgar se merecemos o paraso ou o inferno. Penso que esta  uma vis?o ainda medieval de Deus. O Supremo Criador do Universo n?o poderia ser, penso, um ser antropomorfizado, ocupado das atitudes mesquinhas dos seres humanos que n?o O compreendem, mas sim, uma Inteligncia Universal que demonstra seu amor pela sua Cria??o atravs do cumprimento de Seus desgnios, dos princpios lgicos que demonstram que h uma inteligncia por trs do Universo, e que nos dotou de um esprito, uma partcula divina, que nos permite compreende-Lo, ama-Lo e respeita-Lo, vivendo uma vida consciente e fundamentado no bem, aonde temos a oportunidade de evoluir e nos aproximar da compreens?o deste Deus atravs das sucessivas etapas evolutivas de nossa existncia humana.  Sugiro para quem estiver na busca por um novo e fantstico conceito sobre Deus e a prerrogativa humana de evoluir conscientemente, que busque conhecer sobre a Logosofia. Tenho estudado alguns livros de Logosofia e  impressionante. N?o trata-se de nenhuma religi?o, e por isto me fascina mais ainda.|`|9e448a657bd870e4f6a3fb8de3da21c8aa	 A MINHA VIDA E A MINHA SALVA??O

I once asked a well known Arab scholar a similar question and he answered me as follows:  "We consider a woman to be a diamond, she is the head of the family and the bearer of the children, and a diamond you always cherish and cover".   And you know what, if that means that he doesn't want his daughters to walk around in sleezy clothes and being eyed by h*rny guys - I must say I tend to understand him.   It is true that in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia women do have a less rights than men in certain things.

De igual manera, The Catholic Encyclopedia declara: Estos pasajes [1?Timoteo 3:2, 12; Tito 1:6] parecen derrumbar cualquier afirmacin de que al clero se le haya obligado a vivir en celibato desde el principio.?[...] Esta libertad de elegir parece haber existido durante todo lo que podramos llamar?[...] el primer perodo de la legislacin de la Iglesia, [es decir] hasta aproximadamente el tiempo de Constantino y el Concilio de Nicea.    Curiosamente el origen de esa norma es pagano, mira:  En los tiempos paganos de la antigedad se haba considerado el celibato como algo honorable, indica la Cyclop?dia de MClintock y Strong. Otras obras de consulta indican que tales tiempos paganos de la antigedad se remontan a los antiguos Babilonia y Egipto. The New Encyclop?dia Britannica declara: Al surgir las grandes civilizaciones de la antigedad, apareci el celibato en varios contextos. Por ejemplo, estaba relacionado con la adoracin de Isis, la diosa egipcia de la fertilidad, tal como lo indica la Britannica: El abstenerse de las relaciones sexuales era un requisito absoluto para los que celebraban los santos misterios de ella.

La relajacin y el relax generado por el contacto sexual, limitan la necesidad de hallar pensamientos profundos.    En la prctica, lamentablemente, los instintos suelen dominar a los sacerdotes y entonces los resultados no son lo que debieran.    Se suele decir que un cura es aquel individuo a quien todos le dicen Padre, menos sus hijos, que lo llaman "To".

AA10009772	It all becomes a lot simpler if you just think that there's no God at all.|`|4eb65c12497840f599500825222da691aa	God is forever, so he will not die or fade away, so he needs nothing.  That is not to say that he does not want certain things.    He certainly has the capacity to produce his wants, of that there is no question.    God is three in one.  God the father, Jesus the son, and the comforter, also known as the Holy Spirit.    Jesus and the Holy Spirit do not act independantly of GOD, they do his will and his way.  They are part of the whole, and the whole is GOD.    No decendents needed, they will continue on in eternity.    We are creations of GOD, and therefore just like our own children , we know that they do not understand things that we have come to understand.  As children of God, we may have many questions that we simply cannot yet understand, as we grow and mature in Gods will and way, we do receive understanding of more and more, but not all.    Of course, self willed, spoiled, stubborn children learn much slower than obedient ones.|`|2dda5b5609cc4cb0f79d28c4908e9a6faa	That is such a messed up question I would not even know where to start, so I will just take my 2 points for this comment.|`|AA12122449	It is assumes that God cannot "die" and Jesus was Gods way of sending a messenger we could relate to and believe in a little easier than the "all-knowing, super diety of power... called God"|`|56b64aab30cc765efad950e86c3e6c11aa	God sent Jesus to the earth so Jesus would free us of our sins so we could go to heaven.

Others thought that Jesus wasn't as high a god as the Father, or that he wasn't a god at all.|`|d1b5ba9c62442a6c459d0bc6ae833d13aa	You have to look at  God as one, Jesus is God, in otherwards God came on earth in a form man could handle and that is in form of  Jesus.Otherwise if he came as GOd in his state we would all perish, its just like standing next to the sun..u would burn in less than micro seconds and so it is the same with God he is sinless there is no way he would come in his  form and state on earth, man would not survive in his fallen state. So he came on earth as jesus, in a fallen state as us, to die for our sins and take up our iniquity and infarmity on that cross and thus came about the new testament, u realise everything changed, the customes handled in the oldern days were nolonger relevant in the new testament, he gave us a second chance, Jesus is Gods son coz he is a living example as to how we are supposed to live on earth inorder to be a son of God.We are to follow Jesus example of the way he lived and worshiped. God cannot be cruel to send his own son to die. He took a part of him self to come to us. Isnt his grace sufficient??

To some people, perhaps the biggest and worst sin of all is not to believe in God but that in no way means they do approve of moral evil.  To them, to not believe in God means your immortal soul is in grave danger.  Other evils can be repented of and forgiven.  Now with that said, I must sa y that I may be wrong in my assumption of the reasoning behind their answer but it is worth considering because neither you, nor I know another's motive's and reasoning.   You were asking for opinions not absolute moral fact so lighten up a bit and perhaps try to rephrase your question a little differently.|`|AA12226369	every time i hear that hitler could have gone to heaven if he repented in jesus's name i laugh and say thankfully im not in a cult that would think hitler is going to heaven|`|AA11353730	You may have missed this news story from earlier this year; it's an eye-opener:    http://www.mndaily.com/articles/2006/03/...|`|AA11929231	Thank you for your PROOFS.

How about the fact that Christians preach about how it's not our right to judge others and then they come down against homosexuals, going so far as to keep them from getting married. Religions are supposed to make you tolerant, happy and at peace with yourself. Treat others as you would be treated. Judge not lest you be judged. Love they neighbor and all that good stuff. I see a lot of atheists and agnosts that are likely to follow these morals as opposed to true believers. Just because someone thinks they have found "the true path" in life some people think that makes them better, or gives them license to push it off on other people. I really have no animosity towards religion, just the sect of believers who use it wrongly. I say sect because some people do try to make their lives better.. but it seems nowadays I find more of the other, judgemental type.    I am not religious btw.|`|15687a3aecf5d6f77cc8e556265cd851aa	you religious people make me sick!!|`|128dabda8f0778ce2ae141936e4f22f8aa	No, that just proves that there are religious idiots in the world. I'm a God believer, but my God doesn't need to give me a book to tell me what's right or wrong. Common sense skills were given to me by God to choose right and wrong. Besides, my view of right/wrong could be completely different than your view of right/wrong without religion even being involved.|`|AA11785862	So, just because their prejudice is different than yours, that makes them sick?|`|e2d06c1f417f8267e3f77ccc465ad7cfaa	what is an Atheists|`|d7d749acc9ca46660273d8c1fd131214aa	Atheists see the world and hereafter dark for themselves But there is always a hope for finding the truth and open their eyes for the light until the end of their life So it is for the gang as well If A gang says I know there is God but I do not care about what He order us, he/she is also atheist...All the best :)|`|91a8e11ad451c7891d7ab5f0dab8a125aa	It's just another example of how narrow-minded religious people are.  If they follow the goofy statements of Pat Robertson, John Hagee, Jimmy Swaggart (see the attached) and all of the other wind-bags who make bigoted statements against others, then it's no wonder that many people believe that gang bangers are better  than atheists.    It's the same with the argument about Hitler possibly being in heaven, while religious people believe that millions of Jews will burn in hell.  Bigotry ... their beliefs give them the right to say hateful things with joy.    So much for the love of jesus and how it is supposed to show in the hearts of his followers.

Good luck.|`|AA12079216	Yeah, I think international students can only work for their university unless they can get a work permit from the employers outside of school ...  The employers can sponsor them for a work permit but that is usually kind of hard if you don't have a lot of credentials or can show them that you are exceptional for the position.  I think it will be hard for you to get a job working for Abercrombie because they have enough local applicants and probably won't need to sponsor and pay for someone's work permit for positions like that.  Only for higher-level positions would it be more likely that the employers will sponsor you for the work permit.  If you want to get around this, then maybe like if you know some relatives in the U.S. who can sponsor you for residency or something or get a degree in a good field that will give you a better chance.

Personally I think there is both a tendency to animism and a theurgic part of the brain ... that is impossible to suppress .. such that humanity as we know it will always create these things ...    theurgic part of the brain: There is a helmet in experiment in labs that sends theta waves to a part of the brain ... painless .. no injections .. just waves to stimulate .. some people report bliss .. some cry ecstatically .. some see light ... and all outside of any religious contexts .. so my assertion is that it is "wired" into us .. such that some will always have "theurgic experiences" ..    As we can't make a big white room devoid of characteristics ... our tendency .. to find and make symbols .. which develop to ideas and deeper layers will never end as long as we are .. it is as basic to us as evolving language, and perhaps precedes it ..

I may be a baptized Christian, but I do not go to church because I do not believe everything that is being taught or discussed in that religion. However, if I actually found a group of people who congregated together that believes in the same things as I do, I might attend "church" as well, but I think that highly unlikely.    Also, like the quote from the movie, "Dogma" ... a character denounced the notion of "belief" and wished man was more accepting of the notion of an "idea".  It is very easy to change an IDEA, but people will DIE for a BELIEF. This is another reason why I'd rather not be a part of organized religion.|`|AA10377827	God maid us. In his image. Some chose to follow him others choose not too. Man has a soul and it yearns to be close with it's maker. Still others choose not too. Man did not make God. So the question remains what came first the chicken or the egg. Men make mistakes God does not. If man chooses not to believe, in God, then God does not believe in them. But man must ask God into their hearts and minds and there in lies a newly created creature. Christians call it being born again. Man chooses to claim heaven as their own and appointed people whom follow them. But Jesus put it plain and simple. You must come to him as a child. For every man will seek his own answers in his own time. No one can make a choice for a man. Yet man makes clubs and fraternities and call them religious societies.

As  asserted in the Bhagawad Gita human beings by their freedom of choice over actions are only empowered  to perform them in a legitimate manner but have no justification to get expected results. This is because of the complexities involved in this phenomenal world both due to gross physical as well as subtle mind causes. Otherwise all probability theories and psychological studies if all results were predictable as one wished for would be meaningless. If  we think of someone's karma it is related to the result of our thought  of that person's assessment which we ourselves may or may not accept in toto but definitely not indicative of the persons doings. Even if we find a way to hasten someone's karma we yet do not know the end result  because the person's soul programme may decide to terminte the present existence resulting in death which we may not wish for but only add misery and unpleasentness to our own existence.The best way, hence, is to live freely not causing harm unto ourselves or to others and the environment we live in and leave others also to do the same way.|`|98d3cfd933ba69f8fb1c5e03d11b411daa	One's own? .. or someone else's ?  ... A "developed" (loaded semantic here) person can do both ... In fact the 1st (escalating one's own karma) implies the development .. and likewise this "development" would make the choice of the second "escalating anothers karma" .. much less likely ... but there are certain synchronicities that might orchestrate this for varied reasons ...    re: sastry m ... thanks sastry for the Eknath Easwaran paraphrasings ... we seem to get those parts ...      But this question is beyond asking another rote definition of "karma" and is more in an area of application ... though your paraphrasing of Easwaran picks his thoughts well ... Your quotes seem more the Easwaran Gita than the Prabhubeta, correct?      Perhaps the questioner desired something original and experience based ..

d1c0b6136660d5094a668bc29a1f17e8aa	Historicamente, com evidncias cientficas e reconhecidas pelas "autoridades bblicas", os evangelhos da Bblia datam a partir do ano 60, alguns chegando ao ano 120, sequer existem vestgios de um peda?o que seja de um evangelho anterior a isto. Este fato demonstra, com o consentimento das autoridades teolgicas, que os evangelhos foram provavelmente escritos por pessoas que n?o conheceram Jesus, mas que conheceram os apstolos e ouviam suas narrativas. Algumas bblias inclusive trazem em suas notas as explica??es disto, est l. Busque saber sobre o evangelho "Q".    Nos primrdios do cristianismo prevalecia a tradi??o oral, tudo era contato verbalmente e passado de pessoa para pessoa, at que vendo-se que os apstolos j estavam velhos e morrendo, surgiu a necessidade de come?ar a escrever, segundo o que lembravam de suas histrias... imaginem quanta confus?o, por isto haviam tantos evangelhos divergentes, e tempos depois, a necessidade do Conclio de Nicia para decidir quais seriam os "evangelhos oficiais", quando o cristianismo foi reconhecido como religi?o e oficializado por interesses pelo Imprio Romano, pois at ent?o era uma simples seita.    Lucas, por exemplo, sequer conheceu Jesus, ele era um acompanhante das viagens de Paulo, sendo que Paulo tambm n?o conheceu Jesus nos tempos em que andava entre o povo. Paulo e Pedro discordavam em muita coisa, e isto tambm se observa na prpria Bblia. Est l nas notas da Bblia que Cefas era o mesmo nome de Pedro, e nas cartas de Paulo h vrias men??es de discordancia com Cefas, sendo interessante que, segundo a prpria Bblia, foi  Cefas(Pedro), que Jesus confiou seu postulado. H muitos fatos intrigantes, como por exemplo, ver que Lucas (que n?o estava l)  o nico a falar do milagre da viva de Naim, e os demais evangelhos n?o fazerem nenhuma referncia. Da mesma forma, observe que o milagre da transforma??o da gua em vinho consta apenas em Jo?o, e ele diz que todos os apstolos estavam presentes, se fosse verdade, pela grandiosidade deste fato todos n?o deveriam ter deixado registrado este acontecido? Os outros acharam irrelevante e n?o escreveram a respeito?    Algum me escreveu certo dia dizendo que questionar a existncia de Jesus  como questionar a existncia de Plat?o, Napole?o, Shakespeare ou Santos Dumont. N?o  verdade, pois todos os outros personagens histricos est?o registrados em documentos histricos, e todos eles deixaram seus escritos de prprio punho. A Bblia n?o  um documento histrico, o novo testamento n?o foi escrito por Jesus, alis, a Bblia contm o nico testamento que existe que n?o foi escrito pelo prprio testamentrio    Por isto, para mim, quando me refiro a Jesus de Nazar, considero a figura humana, um ser humano especial, sem artifcios fenomnicos como descreve a bblia, que provavelmente, pela histria que se criou em torno dele, ensinou muitas coisas a seu povo e deixou novos valores que foram transmitidos para a humanidade, mas penso que em cima de sua (provvel) verdadeira histria se criou uma religi?o, se criou dogmas e se criou um mito, muito parecido com outros preexistentes a ele, para atender interesses e privilgios mundanos. Penso que ele foi um idealista de uma nova humanidade e que ensinava novos conceitos, como foi Scrates para os gregos, mas Jesus falava para as massas, falava o idioma do povo, e por isto se tornou querido entre as massas da poca. Depois disto, foi quest?o de tempo para que os homens poderosos, com maus propsitos, oficializassem o mito criado em torno dele para atender a interesses de domnio e controle sobre estas mesmas massas e refor?assem seu poder.|`|a8c0aae20d45f4e13ee3b1d56526d52aaa	pq nem todos os apstolos conheceram Jesus.|`|c29d6edfd37efb4d2fd348bd578e6d3eaa	Eu creio que porque mesmo estando com Ele os apostolos n?o creram o suficiente e tiveram muitas duvidas,mesmo assim Jesus os ensinava sempre e com certeza eles foram vitoriosos.|`|cb7efcc931876abbb974c05c836cef5aaa	Acho que se baseiam ,nos ultimos momentos de Jesus na Terra quando ele morreu e no caminho de emaus dois homens conversavam e pensavam sera que aquele n?o era apenas mais um profeta que morreu, muitos desacreditaram em Jesus por isso acho eu que os discipulos estavam sem realmente conhecer Jesus mesmo estando sempre ao seu lado. amm|`|9b150da6707442a54f3d4dde1d3c648faa	Eles viveram em pocas diferentes,  portanto s conheceram a lenda sobre ele ou o que diziam nos botecos  Essas historias nunca se emendaram  Leia o site www.mphp.org/ingerso1.htm|`|3cd90e2901d5727b4d9adfb911923546aa	os apstolos conheceram sim a Jesus!n?o entendi sua pergunta...|`|272b6cfe86c021eae7ef1057eb90acdeaa	Na bosta que eles dizem que escreveram.|`|3f0a42c6294f39b140f63093f6aed4d7aa	vc deve ta confundindo, eu nao sei mtosobre isso.. mas parece quequem escreveu a biblia foi alguem que nao conheceu Jesus, mas viu ele depois de ressusitado.|`|241508894a8f1afe9186c17b23dc8217aa	SE BASEIA NA IGNOR?NCIA DE N?O CONHECER BBLIA,

Belief in something in my view is a mind set or program that is in place and accepted by the individual who does have it and uses it.    There are those that even if they do have some kind of so called encounter, they will explain it away. Likewise there are those who just accept the existance of ghosts because their mom or pop told them that ghosts do exist.    That "why" you ask is a big question and to answer that you must ask every individual humankind who will admit that they do believe. I am sure you will find many varied reasons for such.    I personally do not accept them for me, but I do accept that they do exist for others who do accept them. I never had an encounter but I also do accept the story of anothers encounter as being their story. I just assume that to them it is their truth and let it be.    This is all a "NO"s view and approach. You must of course have your own that is best for you my friend. With it, do smile a lot and enjoy the day. A smile will keep a lot from questioning your view OK.|`|181d777e6c674ff88a0e6b17266afc98aa	i beleive in ghosts and spirits even tho i never really experienced any real encounters... just a few things i cant explane... like i thought i saw a person walk past a tree but she didnt show up at the other side and i walked around the tree she wasnt anywhere... or the old house i used to live in i thought i would hear tapping n whispers in some of the rooms when nobody was home... even tho there was no deaths or anything horrible that happend in the area.. so i dont really call those encounters they could probably be explaned by a few people but not by me

En un sentido espiritual, s se aplica toda a nosotros. Es importante y bueno leer TODA la Biblia porque en ella encontramos principios espirituales que nos pueden servir para no cometer ciertos errores. Pero eso no quiere decir que todo lo tengamos que leer literalmente. Para darte un ejemplo, los primeros libros (lo que sera la Tor hebrea, de Genesis a Deuteronomio) contienen un montn de leyes (por ejemplo, qu comer, cmo vestirse) que para el cristiano hoy da no son requeridas. Los cristianos creemos que Cristo cumplio la Ley de Moiss en forma perfecta, y nos eximi de tener que cumplir todas esas obras, que bien podan ser algo externo, para darnos una ley superior que es la del Espritu. El creyente recibe al Espritu Santo y l nos va guiando en todas las cosas, nos va cambiando de adentro hacia afuera.     Otro ejemplo podran ser las promesas que figuran en la Biblia, algunas Dios se las dio a determinadas personas y no a todos. No creo que sea correcto EXIGIRLE a Dios que, como le dio un hijo a Sara, tambin me TIENE QUE dar un hijo a m... Dios es soberano... Obvio que le puedo pedir, pero dejarlo a El que decida.     En 1 Corintios 10:6-12 hay una explicacin de por qu tantos hechos quedaron registrados en la Biblia.   Mas estas cosas sucedieron como ejemplos para nosotros, para que no codiciemos cosas malas, como ellos codiciaron.  Ni seis idlatras, como algunos de ellos, segn est escrito: Se sent el pueblo a comer y a beber, y se levant a jugar.   Ni forniquemos, como algunos de ellos fornicaron, y cayeron en un da veintitrs mil.   Ni tentemos al Se?or, como tambin algunos de ellos le tentaron, y perecieron por las serpientes.   Ni murmuris, como algunos de ellos murmuraron, y perecieron por el destructor.    Y estas cosas les acontecieron como ejemplo, y estn escritas para amonestarnos a nosotros, a quienes han alcanzado los fines de los siglos.   As que, el que piensa estar firme, mire que no caiga.         Lo que s te puedo decir es que TODA la Biblia es Palabra de Dios y que tiene poder para transformar tu vida completamente. Lo digo por experiencia y porque la Biblia misma lo dice.     Hebreos 4:12 La palabra de Dios es viva, eficaz y ms cortante que toda espada de dos filos: penetra hasta partir el alma y el espritu, las coyunturas y los tutanos, y discierne los pensamientos y las intenciones del corazn.     2 Timoteo 3:16-7 Toda la Escritura es inspirada por Dios, y til para ense?ar, para redargir, para corregir, para instruir en justicia, a fin de que el hombre de Dios sea perfecto, enteramente preparado para toda buena obra.     El Salmo 19 habla de la Palabra de Dios usando distintos trminos (ley, testimonio, mandamientos, etc)  Salmos 19:7-10 La ley de Jehov es perfecta, que convierte el alma; El testimonio de Jehov es fiel, que hace sabio al sencillo.  Los mandamientos de Jehov son rectos, que alegran el corazn; El precepto de Jehov es puro, que alumbra los ojos.   El temor de Jehov es limpio, que permanece para siempre;   Los juicios de Jehov son verdad, todos justos.   Deseables son ms que el oro, y ms que mucho oro afinado;  Y dulces ms que miel, y que la que destila del panal.

e7ff52c263368130e172ca5a2c0ebf26aa	Dear Bastet,    From what you have said, it sounds like your fianc has not been honest with you. Abortions are prohibited in Islam except in extreme cases such as when one becomes necessary to save the life of the mother. Your fianc might be telling you otherwise because he is afraid of shame he will face in his family and his community for having a child out of wedlock. The way he is treating you is completely against the teachings of Islam.    None of what has happened is your fault, and you should demand to be treated with the dignity and respect that you deserve. I suggest that you ask your fianc to take you with him to get advice on the matter from a local muslim scholar or imam.  This way he will be forced to be honest with himself and with you, and he will have to admit more responsibility for his actions.    Even though things sound bad, don't give up hope of resolving the issue with your fianc. His behavior that you described is certainly unacceptable, but it isn't too late for him to reform his ways and seek amends for his maltreatment of you. This is why I believe that if you insist that he talks to a religious leader (with you present) that he might see the error in his ways and start acting less selfishly. It seems that he is trying to dodge all accountability by keeping a barrier between you and his family, since they would probably be ashamed of their son treating someone in this way.    People often behave despicably when they are allowed to act with impunity, but many will repent when they are held to account. So although bringing this issue before his family or a leader in his community is the hard way, it might be the only solution.    However, if your fianc refuses to reform, and continues to behave abusively and unsupportively, then it might be better for you to leave him and look for support from your family if possible.    I understand that this is a very difficult situation for you, and I wish you the best in resolving these problems.    Imran|`|AA12155242	This is a serious situation.  If he is a good Muslim he would never have agreed to live with you or even have sex with you without having married you.  He is not a good man.    Do you have family you can turn to?  Do you know his family?  I have no idea how they would take the news.  If they are extremely religious, it would be a very difficult situation.      Even if this man agrees to marry you, even if you got married in the Mosque, he will never treat you with respect.  That is my opinion knowing how Muslims think.    Whatever you do, don't go it alone.  If you have a supportive family, put yourself in the middle of them.  From what you are telling me, if your family is loving, you are better off raising your child with them than with this man.    This is only my opinion.|`|AA10520051	First of all the guy ur with is not a proper muslim hes not following Islam u need to point this out to him first tell him if he is so religous and loves it so much and wants to do right by it then why did he sleep with u in the first place? muslim men and women are not allowed to have sex outside of marriage there not even allowed to live together out of mariage, so point this out to him.     Secondly what makes this even worse is he made a mistake it was not just ur mistake it takes 2 to get pregnant it was his mistake too and he should be helping u now in the eyes of islam he has already commited adultery and now he wants to commit murder too????? This is NOT acceptable in Islam u are not allowed to get an abortion, an abortion in islam is just like killing a living breathing kid, and it is clearly stated in the quran that killing one person is like killing the whole of mankind!!! He commited the biggest sin by telling u to get an abortion and u did the right thing by keeping the baby! U are allowed to use any type of birth controll to prevent pregnancy but under no circumstances are u allowed to have an abortion!    Here is what I think u should do, go and talk to his mother tell her everything tell her what he said about his mother hetting abortions and u'll see how much he was lying, the reason i am telling  u to go to his family is because i can pretty much garuntee u they will help I know someone who did exactly what ur husband is doing the only difference is he didnt tell his girllfriend ot get a abortion but he wasnt a hands on father either and none of his family knew about the girl or the kid one day the girl came to the guys parents house and told them everything and his parent made him take responsibility for his actions! So i think this will be a big help.    Mail me if u need more help, i'll do my best to tell u the basis of what islam says about what he is doing! :)|`|ac002590f7dfff2eee6a41eea4330ed7aa	First of all I am a Muslim sister and let me start of by saying this brother knows better.First of all if he really had any intentions on doing the right thing he would have never had sex with you with out being married to you.I"m pretty sure that you are aware being Muslim or not that that was a grave sin.Secondly he's trying to force you to have an abortion is another major sin.God says that if it is not life threating you should not abort the child for fear of not being able to support the child.Yes this is some what true about it not being a baby for the first 3months  but that does not take away from the fact that God odained it to be.I truly feel that you need  to study ,and search for self love rather than worrying about this man who clearly does not understand the religion.If you are still in doubt go to an Islamic Web a site and you will clearly see that you are being lead astray.The only soul you should worry about is your own ,and your child to be.Seek help from those who can direct you to the right path.|`|AA11243819	I am an American who is married to a Tunisian and now I livein Tunisia. Here the culture is more like America was in the 1950's. I got pregnant before marrying my husband as well (we didn't get married until a month before I delivered).     In Tunisia abortions ar performed, but they are looked down upon and if you do get one they are only allowed up until the 3rd month maximum. I personally would never have an abortion, but that's a whole different topic.    What your boyfriend is doing is completely wrong. There are some couples who have kids before marriage, even though it is rare. My husband and his family took care of me from the moment they found out I was pregnant. If your boyfriend is as bad as you say, then I would highly suggest you move on. I know it's hard to say, but if he's acting like this before the baby, think of how he'll be when the baby gets here. I've been in an abusive relationship before - they only get worse and worse.    If you need someone to talk to, or someone to listen to you, please do not hesitate to contact me. I truly hope things work out for you.|`|ad2a9588bb1ab308d1734d1320c55e10aa	I am not Muslim, but I know a few. This is not right in any culture.  Do you have any family to turn to?

And it is a really big shame that he is asking you to get an abortion. But before all that he has to convert you to a Muslim and then only is your marriage valid in the true sense of islam.

6c6ec3a602ea36388606bdba50f32b7daa	Me alegra mucho por t que cuestiones lo que lees en lugar de tragar como borrego lo que dos grandes religiones y un montn de otras peque?as consideran "palabra santa e inerrante".  . Hay en el gnesis dos partes que hablan de la creacin del hombre, una dice " ... entonces Dios cre al hombre y lo cre hombre y mujer" as noms, sin dar grandes detalles, dice que cre un hermafrodita. Luego en otro inconexo captulo viene el cuento infantil del barro amasado a su imgen y semejanza y el soplo de vida para luego plantearse: -no es bueno que el hombre est solo- (como si Dios estuviera improvisando y arreglando a cada paso lo que haca, ?acaso no es omnmodo? ?si sabe todo lo que vendr cmo se le escap ese detalle?) y esperando que Adn estuviera profundamente dormido cre a Eva a partir de una costilla de ste (como si semejante cirujano necesitara que su paciente se durmiera y necesitara una materia prima tan ridcula para crear a la mujer, como si no pudiera crearla omnipotentemente como corresponde)  . En fin, toda una zarta de tonteras. Hasta que llega la parte sobre la que formulas tu atinada pregunta (que ya estoy votando como buensima). Can mata a Abel y huye a la tierra del Nod, donde segn cuenta el contradictorio librito era el sitio donde se refujiaban ladrones y asesinos. ?Eres capaz de decirme quin puso ah a los ladrones y asesinos cuando la tierra estaba poblada por solo 3 personas como dices en tu pregunta?  . Por supuesto que quien se trague sin agua el cuento de la tierra del Nod no tendr reparos en aceptar que all tambin haba mujeres con las que fornic Can. Todo un cuento para ni?os tontos, porque un ni?o listo no se lo traga.  . Sigue leyendo, lee lo del diluvio, otro disparate astronmico, otra prueba de que al pobre Dios le salan mal las cosas, tan poco omnmodo es Dios que tuvo que deshacer ms de una vez lo hecho porque su creacin no lo obedeca. Claro, los chupasirios te van a contar lo del "libre albedro", otra taradez, si Dios di libre albedro pero saba lo que iba a pasar lo poda haber corregido de antemano sin tener que asesinar a toda la creacin ahogndolos vivos, flor de sdico sicpata ese Dios errante.  . Te deca, No era hijo de Matusalem, segn la historia Matusalem sigui teniendo hijos unos 200 a?os despus del diluvio, yo me pregunto, ?como hizo Matusalem para sobrevivir al diluvio si Noe no lo llev en el arca? ?ni eso le sala bien a Dios?   . La mejor manera de hacerse ateo es leer la Biblia bien a conciencia, pocos escritos contienen tantos disparates y errores como la Biblia, que la tierra era plana, que era el centro del universo, que blablabla.  . Hazte el favor, sigue leyendo y plantea aqu los interrogantes que te surjan, no solo abrirs t los ojos sino que ayudars a muchos a abrirlos.  Saludos,  ROBERTO|`|5daf7df9f4cf64c6f3e3c600599f00ebaa	MI estimado Braveheart, lo interesante del planteamiento biblico es que primero te establece un proceso de inspiracin divina por lo tanto simblico, segundo es una experiencia de aprendizaje y tercero est enmarcado en momentos histrico de la humanidad.  El gnesis segn los estudiosos, fue escrito por inspiracin divina, en una momento en que los hebreos eran nmadas, alrededor de unos 900 a?os antes del nacimiento de Jesus. En este momento historico, los cananeos, que habitaban las tierras de canan, que despus sera palestina y fenicia, en donde hoy estn establecidos los israelitas, eran politeistas creian en muchos dioses, mientras los hebreos que se estaban estableciendo como una comunidad dentro de su cultura eran monoteista, pero sus comunicaciones eran orales,no escritas.Por tal razn los guias, los sacerdotes, teman que estos absorbieran en su mayora la cultura de los cananeos y sus creencias politeistas, es as que surge la necesidad de escribir una propuesta que sustentara y fortaleciera el monoteismo de los hebreos y les sirviera de referente dando surgimiento al libro del Gnesis, el comienzo, la creacin. Pero resulta mi estimado braveheart, que el planteamiento es simblico, una respuesta de las creencias de los hebreos frente a las creencias de los cananeos, que en ese entonces estaban mejor organizados politicamente.  As surge una hermosa poseia, que nos lleva de la mano al planteamiento filosfico espiritual hebreo de la creacin del universo por el Dios creador Jehov.  En este planteamiento Adan representa a la humanidad, Eva a la vida, El arbol el conocimiento, la fruta las consecuencias de tus actos, la famosa serpiente se?al de peligro...es toda una poesia metafrica, pero tambien con un fuerte contenido politico. Porque lo ltimo, porque se supone que la ense?anza desde un principio se debi hacer con la esencia de la inspiracin a los hebreos, pero para algunos sumos sacerdotes, que desde entonces comenzaron a disfrutar las mieles del poder, miraron conveniente plantear la poesa literalmente, y se llevaron de encuentro a la mujer sacandola de la vida poltica y espiritual y planteando al hombre como amo y se?or de todo, que cae por los arteficios de la mujer, refuerzan la mea culpa y las consecuencias a la desobediencia, en ese entonces los sumos sacerdeotes eran los ms fuerte polticamente hablando y eran hombres, entonces el planteamiento les cayo como anillo al dedo. Talvs te preguntas porque Dios permit todo esto, no olvides que estamos en el mundo para aprender, para evolucionar, para fortalecer el espritu, para crecer como humanidad. Te imagina si todavia estuvieramos en el paraiso, sera genial, pero te imaginas todo perfecto...que chiste tendra hacer todos los dias la misma cosa, ser feliz eternamente en este cuerpo...no s, pareceriamos idiotas....bueno eso es lo que aprend con este asunto de adan y eva...investiga sin apasionamiento y encontraras las respuestas adecuadas. chao|`|94f40a050bdbb276c8441bbf9cb52bf0aa	mira no lee as el gnesis es un cuento que se contaba porque los hombres de aquella poca no entenderan la teora de la evolucin|`|453ed29841f0e8a1725dcf9fa262e28eaa	contactame y entenderas y comprenderas.  te lo prometo.|`|ae50321c69b7b67bf360235f1082abadaa	ES ms fcil creer que venimos del mono no??, te comprendo, hay cosas que se contradicen en la Biblia, pero la mayora de esas cosas las quitaron, para no comfundir al hombre ms de lo que ya estamos confundidos.

El genesis es como un cuentito. Todo lo que encuentres ahi vendrian a representar otra cosa. Adan y Eva simbolizan que todos venimos del mismo lugar pero no significa que ellos fueron los que procrearon a toda la humanidad. La Biblia no te cuenta como se hizo el mundo y el hombre, solo te dice quien lo hizo. Deja que las cuestiones logicas las explique la ciencia. Solo tenes que saber que cuando lees la Biblia, especiamente esos libros del Antiguo Testamento, tenes que buscar el simbolismo que traen.

Lo que imagino es que las personas que crearon la Biblia no tenan la ms mnima idea de como o de donde salimos nosotros y tuvieron la gran creatividad de escribir eso, ms lo que he escuchado que en cuanto como se era el universo anteriormente de existir las galaxias si la pegaron, sobre que todo era oscuro.|`|20208a45a3fdb9440ea91698382be7fbaa	mi opinin muy personal:    1.- tu no puedo comprender, me suena a un ?por qu? muy comn (en el sentido de frecuente, todava no te estoy ofendiendo, no lo pretendo, pero todo puede pasar) en "asuntos religiosos" y acontecimientos humanos, como la muerte, es decir, quiz por tradicin ancestral, mnimo desde nuestra admiracin casi idoltrica por los as llamados clsicos (griegos) por su cultura, filosofa y ciencia, hasta su muchas veces mal interpretada "espiritualidad" (su panteon lleno de dioses y otros), de ellos principalmente heredamos esa cuasi lgico-curiosidad explicalo-todo, de la que dependemos tanto para movernos por este mundo lleno de tantos, "no me lo puedo explicar, debe ser un error, obra de los alucinados, perdn iluminados"    2.- es muy dificil explicarse, (yo no puedo enga?arme de esa manera), un relato como el de la creacin del hombre en el gnesis bblico, (y muchsimos otros) con y en medio de la fijeza de mi mente cartesiana (ya menos, afortunadamente), aunque tambin hay quienes as lo hacen, muy respetable, aunque lo que yo haga para ellos no lo sea, espero que ese no sea tu caso, porque entonces ya te habr insultado.    ahora bien, como lo veo, dentro de las tradiciones espirituales del mundo, incluyendo la judeo-cristiana, existen por as decirlo distintos niveles de lectura, uno exotrico y otro esotrico, el primero abarca todo lo que es aprendido casi mecanicamente, por la prctica y la repeticin, lo que lleva a que en "textos" mas "avanzados" se caiga en confusiones, paradojas y dolores muy fuertes de cabeza, algunos llegan hasta el atesmo (segn yo, claro) para defenderse de esa masa amorfa de contradicciones que envenenan la mente. (el aspecto exotrico de la religin es obvio mas amplio, pero lo has de concer bien, nada ms preguntate con cuidado)    y finalmente dentro de los mismos "textos" hay y se puede hacer una lectura en un nivel esotrico (ojo, no hablo de en lo que ha degenerado este trmino), simplemente quiere decir reservado u oculto, sin caer en barrabazadas como el codigo da vinci (al menos entretenidas) ni las otras peores en que suelen caer algunos,  como los "prncipes de las iglesias".      a por cierto, segn le o vi en un documental, tu duda se la explican tambin, como un error en la traduccin, de las lenguas originales de los libros que conforman la biblia, del gnesis por esta va se dice, que en la creacin hubo la intervencin de varios dioses o seres divinos, entre otras de este tipo, adems no olvides que el antiguo testamento es primordialmente "judo" es decir del pueblo elegido, y de esta lectura se puede extraer que adn (hecho de tierra) y eva (compa?era, o algo as, pues al fin salio de una costilla de adn no), can abel y seth (el tercer hijo de adn y eva, que lleg a ocupar el lugar de abel) y dicen que hubo mas hijos e hijas, son ancentros del pueblo elegido y que ms all del paraiso existian otros, los "no elegidos", de donde podan tomar esposos y esposas,  aunque si explica un poco de ese desprecio del hombre sobre todo de aquel que tiene una cultura-religin monoteista, a los extranjeros, obviamente creado, sabr dios por cual dios.    le paro aqui, espero no aburrirte y te sirva de algo.     quiz, al menos yo as lo creo, depende de la lectura que hagas y la intencin, para qu haces la o las preguntas, si para clarificarte o solo para explicarte algo ms.  ambas y las que se te ocurran son vlidas, aunque con distintas consecuencias.  una confusin, un dolor de cabeza, ampliar o disminuir ti horizonte...la claridad.

Well, there is a verse in The Holy Quran, which states sthg like that, The Holy Quran has been made easy for all to understand. Dude, these are Not words of me and u, in our easy-going language. These are The Words of The Only GOD (ALLAH), The CREATOR. These Words Not only tells us the best way to lead our life, but They also Practicall Show us the best way to lead our life. The Eloquence of The Holy Quran, is So High, that It has many Layers of Meanings (all well), and it depends on how deep can u go? do u know, that The Holy Quran is the only book, which, if a janitor reads, he will be very impressed, as well as if a Phd. Philospher reads, he will be more impressed. The deeper u sink into it, the better u get The Message. The Holy Quran is without any Contradictions/faults/mistakes as it is The Final/Last Word of GOD. The words also are strong, so that we may Not take it Lightly, like a novel or a story book, But we Learn from it, we have to Read It with Understanding, even if u Read only 1 verse with understanding and applies its message to ur life, u'll get the reward of 1000 prayers (Sa'lats), if u can't apply the message, u still will get the reward of 100 prayers (Sa'lats).  So, the point is, my brother, The Holy Quran is NO ordinary book, Its a Book of ALLAH (GOD) teaching and showing us the best way to live our life. Peace to All.  P.S. ............. It's like an instruction manual, u get from the manufacturer of ur latest Plasma TV, explaining u different features, and the best way to use the product to its maximum features.|`|75904d0be03743b52fc7804dfd5cd2e4aa	actually you should find it yourself than you know it does touch your heart.read it,think it, feel it and you will now something that is magnificent in ISLAM.get help if you need so.

They will have a form of Godliness and talk peace, but the Bible is very clear that when Jesus returns, He will come to defend Israel. There will be no dought and out of His mouth will come destruction. That is why it is so important to receive Jesus as your Lord and Savior today. Otherwise, it maybe too late. Is Jesus going to be your Judge or Friend on Judgement day?|`|AA10286882	a false christ

Fredericus2|`|fc6d5c5ab49dd2c1010c87f51d03f6c3aa	ich denke, dass es aus frheren Zeiten stammt, als der Mensch noch nicht geforscht hat um z.B. herauszufinden, dass Affen sehr intelligent sind oder auch andere Tiere.    Und so hat man nur die beobachteten Eigenschaften der Tiere herausgefiltert, wie z.B. die Sturrheit der Esel, oder die Vorliebe der Schweine fr Schlamm und Dreck oder die augenscheinliche Langsamkeit der Elefenten usw. und diese dann auf die Menschen bertragen.

Los catlicos pedimos perdn por nuestros errores y eso les agrada muchsimo a los ateos y los de otras confesiones porque creen que nos humillamos a sus pies, en definitiva , no entienden nada . Cuando nos atacan no hacemos como los judos que aprietan filas y salen con los botines de punta, para emplear un trmino futbolero,o como los rabes que decretan "guerra santa", todo lo contrario bajamos la cabeza perdonamos y nos retiramos y hasta confesamos culpas en demasa para no irritar al ofensor , y es aqu donde redondeo mi idea , ellos creen que esto es cobarda o debilidad y aprovechan para atacar aun mas, ( la tcnica del len que elige al mas dbil para comerlo) En fin, no somos los mejores pero tampoco y muchsimo menos los peores. El catolicismo esta bajo agresin y ataque en los ltimos sesenta a?os e ira "in crescendo" en el futuro , cuando mas se comprenda esto, mayor sera la fortaleza para soportar.

e3c2ed462851c4c6d6796055b93e6970aa	I grew up working poor. That's when one or both of your parents works but make so little money that you still qualify for food stamps, housing assistance, and other welfare.     My father worked at a country club with lots of rich people. The truely rich people were always nice to us.     It was the upper middle class folks who wanted to be rich that were terrible. Those were the people that were always reminding us of how poor we were. Those were the people who would show off all the new, high priced stuff they had and pick on us for buying clothes at the Salvation Army. The "new" money. Like the celebrities on TV wearing "grillz" and other tacky bling just to draw attention to themselves.    The truely rich people would do nice things. Like the year we were all given new ice skates. Or the time one of them talked to me about why I should try to go to college. They were always hush-hush about being nice because they didn't want other people to think they were doing it for the wrong reasons.     Its the upper middle class people who are insufferable snots.|`|7c0dc89d8120ee4d8d34c4295c6b65deaa	Yes I do because they demand it|`|AA11317014	It goes both ways, some poor people have a complex and think that they are frowned upon by better off people. Obviously a business person (doctor) will be more inclined to go for the money, thats why he does that job. I don't think police give a damn how much money you have. I do believe alot people keep themselves poor with bad habits (like drinking, smoking and eating out).|`|0f4a47d6260af20884c8c0b96ab2c5faaa	Yes, I find that wealthy people look down on those who have little or no money... or even people they -perceive- as having no money, even if that isn't true.  The rich tend to think the poor are dirty, uneducated (and incapable of being educated), diseased...     I've had my share of problems with this sort of thing:  doctors who assumed that my health issues were caused by drug abuse, teachers who refused the possibility that I might belong in their exclusive little "gifted" class, various people who got offended at my "educated" accent (because clearly a low-income person such as myself can't -possibly- speak more precisely and intelligently as a person of significant wealth), all because I'm not rich.    As for doctors specifically, I could quote actual writing from a doctor who said that people without insurance -- poor folks -- should not get health care because it is a waste of resources to provide such for people who aren't contributing to society...    A friend of mine was raped by her landlord, and when she tried to report this, she was told that she was falsely accusing 'a good, upstanding member of the community' -- even before she had a chance to tell the guy's name -- and that she'd be the one to go to jail if she didn't let it drop, because after all, he owned property, so he must be a better person than she was... Things like that really p*** me off.    That was probably more information than you wanted, but you kinda touched a nerve with that question...

Read Corinthians,Thessalonians, and so on and look at Paul and the apostles, and what they did, and what was expected of them by Christ! But mostly look at the book of Acts. Jesus gave clear instruction to His church! Consider this - On the day of Pentecost, there was a crippled man who laid in front of the Temple and asked for alms every day. When Paul came, after receiving the Holy Spirit from God, the man asked him for alms. Paul told him," I have no silver to give to you, but what I can give to you is worth much more." He then told the man to take up his bed and walk, and the man did just that! The sad thing about this is that there are very few churches today that can say 'I have no silver (or money) to give'! And even fewer than that which could say' take up your bed and walk' and see it happen! And as far as you being religious, girl - religion isn't going to save you, or anyone else! Religion is of man. The Holy Spirit comes from God.If you are not filled with the Holy Spirit, you are lost. Sorry if that offends you, but READ YOUR BIBLE!

There is no church organization today like that of the 1st or 2nd century.

All the other things you listed are denominations (they're all Protestants), not religions .. they are denominations within Christianity (which is not a man-made religion).    The differences in Protestants (Christians) really shouldn't be there, but they are because of human differences, beliefs and interpretations of the Bible...... some do not use the Christian Bible, or they have added to or subtracted from it or use books that man has written instead, or some are liberal and some are conservative. Ideally, there should be the one belief of the one Bible in the same one Trinity ... we should interpret the Bible as God meant His Word, and that takes some studying and praying.  Also, denominations are organized differently ... their structure in their disciplines, their church staff .. things like this, so different people are geared towards, or more comfortable in, different churches.  This may or may not be good, it depends on what they believe and if they are right and true to God and His Word.|`|AA12275506	At Matt. 7 :13 and 14, Jesus used an illustration of two roads to say that out of all people who claim to be followers of the one true faith, only a comparative few were on the road to life. He then said in verse 21-23 that many who professed to be doing the will of the Father were doing just the opposite. He proceeded to tell them in verse 23, "I will confess to them: I never knew you! Get away from me, you workers of lawlessness." At 1Cor. 1:10, we are told that in true Christianity, "there should not be any divisions among you, but that you be fitly united in the SAME mind and in the SAME line of thought." There is only one true faith.|`|b5b26df8e4d3363ba97caa423b1ba753aa	They all have something different, some differnent doctrine.  The Lutherans evolved from the Catholics, Baptists fro lutherans, Methodists from Baptists, etc. For example, I'm a Seventh - Day Adventist because the Bible says to worship God on Sabbath [Saturday, the seventh day] and we believe in the advent, the second coming of Christ. We don't believe in the rapture, and we interpret the Scriptures differently. A lot of Seventh -Day Adventist are vegetarian also [not me] and lead conservative lives. Other Protestants and Cathlolics worship on Sunday. If you do some historical digging, you'll see it does make a difference and WHY.  If you want to join a church that doesn't mess with all that, you could join a non-denominational church.|`|bd861129d3433f1d5311b4b620b0955eaa	In the early 1500s, a German monk named Martin Luther was so conscious of his sins that he spent up to six hours in the confessional. Through study of the Scriptures he found that salvation didnt come through anything he did, but simply through trusting in the finished work of the cross of Jesus Christ. He listed the contradictions between what the Scriptures said and what his church taught, and nailed his "95 Theses" to the church door in Wittenberg, Germany. Martin Luther became the first to "protest" against the Roman church, and thus he became the father of the Protestant church.     Since that split, there have been many disagreements about how much water one should baptize with, how to sing what and why, who should govern who, etc., causing thousands of splinter groups. Many of these groups are convinced that they alone are right. These have become known as Protestant "denominations."     Despite the confusion, these churches subscribe to certain foundational beliefs such as the deity, death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The Bible says, "The foundation of God stands sure, having this seal, The Lord knows them that are his" (2 Timothy 2:19). Thomas Jefferson once wrote of a preacher, Richard Mote, who "exclaimed aloud to his congregation that he did not believe there was a Quaker, Presbyterian, Methodist, or Baptist in heaven, having paused to give his hearers time to stare and to wonder. He added that, in heaven, God knew no distinctions."|`|365027a9f89c072f781b06ed82844749aa	These are all man made religions...We all have one thing in common we believe the Lord Jesus is our Savior.

We are always defending ourselves against the non stop barrage of insults from the other denominations. Mostly Lutherans do not do that or Methodists or the other major religions. It is usually the ones who spout twisted theology from a basement where they camp out and never go to Church. For the most part THE Christian religions get along pretty good. The Lutherans have now started praying the Rosary in some Churches and you would be surprised how many questions are asked on the ewtn website on Protestants going to a Catholic priest for confession.|`|500d6fc36eb98b82443dc02f01ab5214aa	The only reason why there is so many different Christian Religions is others wanted some money, and it's all religions, they are basically man made.

Du erkennst ihn erst, wenn es zu sp?t ist ;-)|`|ab3b88b1ca7eb56e6f1907cfab287a99aa	Rot ist eine Farbe der Leidenschaft und Zgellosigkeit, repr?sentiert also sowohl leidenschaftliche Wut und Hass als auch die von der Kirche ebenso gehasste leidenschaftliche und zgellose Liebe und Sexualit?t. In der H?lle brennt das Fegefeuer, das ist auch rot. Die Gestalt des Teufels ist vor allem eine Mischung aus verschiedenen G?ttern wie dem geh?rnten Gott der Kelten (Cernunnos), dem griechischen Pan und Dyonisos. Diese hatten ebenfalls H?rner. Cernunnos war ein Gott der Fruchtbarkeit und der Natur mit Hirschgeweih, er war halb Mann, halb Tier, Pan war ein Wald- Hirtengott, der ebenfalls die Fruchtbarkeit symbolisierte, und so auch die Sexualit?t. Er wurde meist mit Bocksh?rnern und dem Unterk?rper einer Ziege dargestellt, oft auch mit hoch errichtetem Phallus. Dyonisos war ein zgelloser, stierh?rniger Gott des Weines und der Sexualit?t. Seine Anh?nger sollen mit ihm regelrechte Orgien gefeiert und sich betrunken haben. Schon den anderen Griechen und besonders den R?mern waren diese "Bacchan?le" (Bacchus war der r?mische Name von Dyonisos) sehr suspekt, und man erz?hlten sich darber die grausigsten Geschichten. Man bezeichnete diese ganzen Gestalten als b?se, weil sie den christlichen Moralvorstellungen widersprechen, also nicht christianisiert werden konnten. Das war auch eine gute M?glichkeit, die Priester dieser G?tter zu Teufelsanbetern und Hexen zu machen und sie zu verbrennen.  Warum der Himmel oben ist und die H?lle unten? Ja, den Himmel unter die Erde zu legen w?re ja auch nicht besonders logisch, nicht wahr?    Nein, ernsthaft jetzt, der Himmel wird mit h?heren geistigen Sph?ren und N?he zur Sonne (die ja oft mit Gott assoziiert wird) in Verbindung gebracht. Man ist beim Licht. In der H?lle jedoch scheint kein Sonnenlicht, kein Strahl vom christlichen Gott und seinem Sohnemann. Nein, es ist dort bis auf das flackernde Fegefeuer immer dunkel.    Da die H?lle unter der Erde liegt, ist sie nahe dem Erdkern, und der ist bekanntlich ein bisschen hei? ^-^  Die Vorstellung von Himmel und H?lle war in verschiedenen Religionen ?hnlich, aber sie stammt vor allem von den Germanen, die auch an zwei Jenseitsm?glichkeit glaubten: Walhalla, das Reich der G?tter und der ehrenhaften M?nner und Krieger, und die Hel(!), ein unterirdisches Reich des Leidens, in das die "schlechten" Menschen kamen. Die Hel wurde nach der gleichnamigen G?ttin, der Tochter Lokis (Loki ist so etwas wie der germanische "Teufel", wenn man das so sagen kann. Er war ein Gott der List und der Tcke, sp?ter auch des B?sen. Und die liebe Hel ist halt seine Tochter), regiert. Eines Tages, am Ragnar?k (Weltuntergang), wird Loki mit seinen Kindern die G?tter strzen und versuchen, die Macht zu bernehmen, wird aber dann doch von den "guten" G?ttern besiegt. Also auch sehr verwandt mit der christlichen Geschichte der Apokalypse.    Aber woher wissen wir denn, wie es in der H?lle aussieht? Hat jemand von euch sie je besucht? Ist jemand je daraus zurckgekehrt?    Es gibt da einen Witz: Ein Heide (oder Atheist oder Satanist) muss in die H?lle. Statt aber im Fegefeuer landet er auf einer wundersch?nen Wiese voller lachender, sich liebender Leute. Er entdeckt den Teufel, einen gebr?unten, geh?rnten Kerl mit Sonnenbrille, und fragt ihn, ob das denn wirklich die H?lle sei. "Natrlich." antwortet der. Der Heide sieht sich weiter um und entdeckt pl?tzlich ein Loch im Boden. Flammen zngeln von dort hoch, und dort brennen schreiende Menschen. "Du hast mich belogen!" ruft er dem Teufel zu. Der Teufel schttelt nur den Kopf und sagt: "Ach, das ist fr die Christen, die wollen das so."    Aber die Farben und die H?rner sind nur Metaphern und Sprachbilder. Wenn es einen Teufel gibt, dann ist er ein spirituelles Wesen ohne jeden materiellen K?rper, der sich in den verschiedensten gestalten zeigen kann.

H?ufigste Farbe bei Teufelsdarstellungen ist allerdings Schwarz/Dunkelbraun.    -----------    Zur Farbe Rot: Rot war immer die Farbe der M?chtigen, des Adels, eine K?nigsfarbe. Und vor allem auch die Farbe Christi. es Feuers und des Blutes, des Opferblutes Christi und der Blutzeugen, auch der Bu?e. Aber da Macht und Liebe unkontrolliert in Machtmissbrauch, Hochmut und Hass umschlagen k?nnen, wird das Rot die Farbe des Frsten der H?lle (Mephistopheles) und der gro?en Hure Babylon (Offbg. Joh. 17, l ff.), w?hrend auf der anderen Seite die Kardinale das Rot der Frsten der Kirche tragen.    Der Teufel wurde u.a. auch mit Grn dargestellt. Obwohl Grn Hoffnung, Menschlichkeit und Auferstehung symbolisiert.    ---------------    Warum H?rner?    Er wird nicht nur geh?rnt dargestellt. Auch mit Vogelkrallen, Flgeln, Bocksfu?, Pferdefu?,  etc.     In Deutschland und England des 12. Jahrhunderts erfolgt eine Neuorientierung des Teufelsbildes am Vorbild der r?misch-antiken G?tterbilder. Die Satyrgestalt, ein Begleiter des r?mischen Bacchus, wurde bernommen  eine Verbindung von menschlichem Oberk?rper und Bocksbeinen, mit Schwanz, H?rnern, langen Tierohren, gestr?ubtem Haar und zottigem Fell.   Der Pferdehuf ist ehre selten zu sehen und wohl eine Abwandlung des Satyr-Motivs. Dass der Teufel mitunter hinkt, wird mit dem Sturz aus dem Himmel in Zusammenhang gebracht.    Und nur als Anmerkung: Nicht nur Khe haben H?rner ... Auch Ziegen, Widder, Steinb?cke, etcpp.     ---------------------    Warum ist der Himmel oben u. die H?lle unten?    "Oben" ist das Licht, die Sonne, sind Luft und freier Raum. "Unten" liegt das Verborgene, das Dunkle, etc. - Es entsprach der Logik, dass sich alle Glaubensvorstellungen ein Bild ihrer G?tter derart schufen, dass das Gute oben ist, das B?se unten.     ---------    Warum ist die H?lle in der Fantasie hei??

2bf1706dd4a4508dd3d7da51b963a14caa	Currently, the highest at risk for transmitting HIV / AIDS are young black women 16-24.   Actually, HIV / AIDS is the number 1 deseaces contributing to death in black women between 25 and 34.  It is suspected that, at this rate, in 10 years blacks will make up nearly 45% of Americans infected with the virus.  That's extremely high considering one person every 6 sec. contracts it.  The site son the bottom are proof of this so don't listen to anyone saying that gays started this virus... it affects everyone and is no longer just a "gay" problem, it's everyone's.  Gays are not the number one drug users, it's a human problem not a sexual preference problem.  There's also conspiracy theories that say the government made AIDS for population control (a virus that breaks down your immune system, seems fishy don't you think lol)    PS: Don't listen to people being mean to you, you just needed to be explained to a little that's all.  Drug use is not higher with homosexuals not is the lack of condom use... if that was the case there wouldn't be thousands of unwanted children and teenage moms.  Education is the best tool you have.

Obviously it would spread faster when you double the amount of men involved.  You can't totally link AIDS to gays because of IV drug use.  Sharing needles is the problem with IV drug users and that doesn't have anything to do with sexuality.  I happen to know many  recovering drug addicts and a high percentage are gay even though more are straight.  I do not believe that HIV is more prevalent in the gay community based on IV drug use although that may add to the amount of gay people with HIV in the long run (as with any other group).  To link the two, you'd have to be saying that one of the first people to contract/transmit HIV through IV drug use was gay and then only continued to share needles with other gay people.  Irresponsible IV drug users will share needles with anyone, not just gay people.    *I can't provide information comparing the percentage of IV drug users among gays vs. straights.  I also can't rely solely on my own experience because I know a larger amount of recovering/currently active IV drug users than the average person.

Please talk to your health teacher at school or a local medical clinic - your "mother" is woefully misinformed.    More than 90% of the new cases of AIDS are caused by heterosexual transmission, primarily due to unprotected sex or infected mothers giving birth to infected children.  And yes, people who share bodily fluids like IV drug users can get AIDS as well.    Please don't cite rumors, like the one about LGBT people being IV drug users, without facts.  This is completely false.  So was the "documentary" that speculated about HIV's origin.    Do some research.

Menciona tus virtudes y defectos.  4. Menciona tu edad y patria (la nacionalidad no es lo suficientemente precisa para mis intenciones, las cuales no son molestarlos de alguan forma).    veamos...    1. virtudes: los chicos son buenos consejeros, buenos amigos, son honestos, tratan de decirte las cosas de la mejor manera y si no hay atraccion de por medio... pueden ser los mejores amigos.    Defectos: menosprecian mucho a las mujeres, no creen que ellas tengan ciertas capacidades, si hay atraccion de por medio solo las ven como objetos sexuales, no toman en cuenta muchas cosas que les decimos.    2. Desafortunadamente la "mayoria" de las mujeres aman hablar sin parar, son chismosas, les encantan los problemas, son muy metidas, siempre quieren saber de todo, no siempre piensan en el otro primero ven que beneficio tiene para ellas y luego para el otro, son demasiado sentimentales, cuando se enojan son insoportables y para peor... se enojan con frecuencia.      3.   Virtudes: Soy buena escuchando, se que doy consejos buenos... la mayoria de las veces, no hablo casi nunca, no me gusta hablar de mi. Creo que soy bastante inteligente, algo ingeniosa y amable.    Defectos: cuando me enojo soy maliciosa, soy demasiado sarcsticas, siempre tengo que contestarle a la gente de tal manera que no puedan decir mas nada, a veces me enojo tanto que me molesta que la gente me hable, puedo ser vengativa (nunca al punto de lastimar a alguien) pero se ingeniarmelas para que ALGO les pase, soy de atacar mas por el lado psicolgico que fsico... y muchos mas.    4. tengo 21 Argentina      Ok... fui bastante honesta... ni una mentira en estas respuestas...|`|c500e728ae38a1737724d744b924961aaa	no seria facil responderte a el cuestionario, pero lo trataria de hacer, claro honestamente!  buen dia!|`|fe0eeb1dfbd8b38e74d309ddff72494faa	1- Virtudes de los chicos: generalmente son mas valientes. No son tan indecisos. Son mas fuertes. Nos hacen sentir bien. Algunos son respetuosos y caballeros. y defectos: son medio bruscos o brutos algunos, no miden su fuerza. Les cuesta ser infiel y suelen mentir u ocultar. No muestran ni andan contando todo lo q sienten.    2- Somos sencibles, cuidadosas, nos preocupamos por los demas (tal vez al extremo sea un defecto eso), somos mas cari?osas y no nos da verguenza mostrar lo q sentimos (genrelamente). Defectos: somos impasientes, indecisas, criticonas, chusmas.    3- me concidero divertida, sociable, con facilidad para aprender, comprenciva, despreocupada y me gusta vancar a los que quiero. Defectos?: la comida :P no me gusta mostrar lo q siento, por ahi miento un pokito :S ...    4- Tengo 19 a?os y soy de Argentina!|`|ada80b26d24e18ed7aa96eea9a5bc89baa	me parece tonto cada uno tiene virtudes y defectos y no tiene que ver con el sexo de cada uno
AA12059450	He MAY believe it, but it sounds like fraud is going on. The basis is NOT a valid exegesis or interpretation of scripture.|`|7d647be57724929a656a84a04d156140aa	Do you think that everything a minister/pastor or whosoever does has to be lined up with the Bible.  It's the same like someone called your phone and asked for your SSN or banking or credit information - many people are fooled by these life old tricks and falls for them day after day.  People perish for lack of knowledge.|`|1726c5ad16505749720aef77b05b8ef8aa	I received something like that one time and thought I would never quite the requests for money (donations) ever since.

The Lord will heal if it is His will. The word faith movement is actually a form of witchcraft.|`|6e3b631a4bd05e7de188f5d693d228deaa	lol guy is a fraud, I remember seeing his commercials on television "Send money now to receive your miracle prayer package"... I'm sorry but the only televangelist that I believe is truely out for the good of humanity is Billy Graham. In my opinion if they ask for money to be sent then they are a scam, if they are truely christian pastors they should have faith that "god" will provide them with the money to operate the ministry in the first place. If they feel required to beg for money then obviously they don't have faith that their god will provide for them.    Also I remember him talking about taking baths in olive oil or something like that, and saying how it will cure you of AIDS or cancer or stuff like that. That's straight up ignorant and all that does is give people false hope, as well as putting their health and well being in danger, as many "miracle healings" say you should give up your medications and try the "miracle olive oil" instead. Very dangerous indeed.|`|e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	That is just a little to weird for me. God bless. Well I just viewed the website and that explains it all, they are Pentecostal, their beliefs are a little strange to me anyway. They do not think that anyone outside of their denomination believes in the holy spirit. that should tell you something. They are a very different sort of people  God bless|`|8fb27a6ae3e561f071dc79e655c0e2d8aa	I hope they like popcorn|`|AA10566013	Scam, looking for money.

Ever since then, the misunderstandings about the Message and the Biographies of the Muslims have been accumulating. And the West has suffered, not the Muslims. There has been no dent on Islam and its lovers. According to sane European writers like Thomas Carlyle, the Life of the Prophet was a life of  piety .  The Asker shall never be able to quote from the Quran, an evidence in support of the abusive language used in the question.|`|eb7854082aac5c49617eeac0e251b43baa	Allah has no beginning and no end, he just exists and in his teachings through the Koren and the various prophets he sent to this earth does not justify paedophile and criminal lifestyles. The prophet Mohammad PBUH did not have a paedophile and criminal lifestyle. It is man in today's society who justifies this lifestyle through the media and its "sex sells" attitude towards everything. Those who do not believe in Allah and judge others will burn in hell. There is no greater than Allah!

This year there are 175 children and our staff has been whittled down to bare bones. I would take 1000 and do what I could to make sure these 175 children had something for Christmas.

f4cb2808ee259c3557351a60f4420e31aa	A Cuba c' l'embargo perch la maggioranza del popolo cubano non si ribella a Castro e non vuole la " democrazia " americana.   Gli Usa  vogliono punire  la stragrande  maggioranza dei cubani che danno e mantengono  coscientemente, intenzionalmente e volontariamente i loro consensi a Castro delegittimandolo come dittatore. Castro non potrebbe stare un decimo di secondo al potere se ci fosse una consistente minoranza organizzata che si oppone perch, gli Usa e la comunit internazionale pomperebbero cos tanto quella opposizione, la finanzierebbero, la valorizzerebbero esageratamente e, se necessario l'armerebbero e per Castro sarebbe la fine. Se questo non succede  perch non c' una opposizione cos forte e organizzata da competere con la maggioranza del popolo cubano e allora giu embargo cos imparano questi morti di fame comunisti a volere un dittatore come Castro invece della democrazia della libert di fare di quell'Isola quello che la mafia e gli Usa ne favevano ai tempi di Batista ma,  oggi, non potrebbe pi essere cos, i cubani sono troppo abituati a considerare Cuba la loro terra, la loro Patria conquistata con una rivoluzione popolare vincente contro la tirannide di Batista e degli Usa e non permetterebbero mai a nessuno di gestire le sorti di Cuba e del suo popolo.|`|a1015d3192b2ddc14537ef47088b6386aa	perch gli stati uniti non riconoscono il governo comunista di fidel...|`|25936f2f218372b81fb23ee143c4b440aa	beh...  come inizio del discorso puoi pensare al fatto che trattasi di Paese sottoposto a DITTATURA...|`|7a5021bc8ca75b5ec28935d2f2066fb9aa	rivolgiamo questa domanda agli usa|`|19e78cab59254c302e9e5ffb46acfc2baa	come ? c'e' ancora l'embargo a cuba ?? e che caxxo questo e' troppo eh !|`|97e2add9de75bd503efae01150e71956aa	Finch Fidel rimane e rimangono le sue idee, gli USA non toglieranno l'embargo.

Sin torcerle el brazo, sin presionarlo. Sin expresiones del tipo de, "Usted simplemente tiene que creer." ?Slo las razones sencillas y sin vueltas que lo llevaran a uno a concluir que hay un Dios?     Este artculo es una oportunidad para que usted le d una mirada honesta a la posibilidad de un Dios. Intentar contestar la pregunta, "?Hay un Dios que es poderoso, personal y amante? ?Existe tal Dios?"     Tal vez sea algo sorprendente, pero mucha gente cree en Dios no por desesperacin o para concretar sus deseos, sino como una respuesta honesta a los hechos convincentes que estn frente a ellos.     Sin embargo, antes que usted vea los siguientes hechos considere esto. Si una persona se opone a la posibilidad de que exista Dios, entonces cualquier evidencia puede ser racionalizada o explicada de otra forma. De la misma forma en que si alguien est completamente opuesto a la idea de que hubo gente que camin sobre la luna, no habr ninguna cantidad de evidencia que haga que cambie su pensamiento. Las imgenes satelitales de los astronautas caminando sobre la luna, las rocas lunares de una composicin extra?a, el testimonio de los astronautas, los informes escritos de su misin. . . toda la evidencia no tiene ningn valor, porque la persona ya ha llegado a la conclusin de que la gente no puede ir a la luna.     Cuando se trata de la posibilidad de la existencia de Dios, la Biblia dice que hay personas que han visto suficiente evidencia pero han suprimido la verdad acerca de Dios. Por otro lado, para aquellos que quieren conocer a Dios si l est all, l dice, "Me buscarn y me encontrarn, porque me buscarn de todo corazn. S, yo dejar que ustedes me encuentren. . . " As que antes que considere los hechos para probar la existencia de Dios, es vlido que se pregunte, "Si Dios existe, ?quisiera conocerlo a l?"     He aqu, pues, algunas razones que apoyan la existencia de Dios:     1. A lo largo de la historia, en todas la culturas del mundo, la gente ha estado convencida de que hay un Dios. ?Podra uno decir, con algn grado de confianza, que todas esas personas han estado equivocadas? Miles de millones de personas, que representan distintas conformaciones sociolgicas, intelectuales, emocionales y educacionales . . . todas llegaron a la misma conclusin de que hay un Creador, un Dios que debe ser adorado.     "La investigacin antropolgica ha indicado que hoy, entre la gente primitiva ms lejana y remota, hay una creencia universal en Dios. Y en las historias y leyendas ms tempranas de las personas alrededor del mundo, el concepto original era de un Dios, quien era el Creador. Un alto Dios original parece haber estado en su conciencia aun en aquellas sociedades que hoy son politestas."     2. La complejidad de nuestro universo, nuestro sistema solar y nuestro planeta Tierra apuntan todos a un Dise?ador conocedor y deliberado quien no slo cre nuestro universo sino que lo sostiene en el da de hoy. Se podran dar aqu pginas y pginas de ejemplos que muestran el dise?o de Dios, tal vez sin terminar nunca. Pero aqu van algunos:     La Tierra. . . su tama?o es perfecto. El tama?o de la Tierra y la gravedad correspondiente sostiene una delgada capa de gases de nitrgeno y oxgeno, bsicamente, sobre la superficie de la tierra. Extendindose slo unos 80 kilmetros sobre la superficie de la Tierra, nuestra atmsfera contiene la mezcla correcta de gases para sustentar la vida. Si la Tierra fuera ms peque?a, una atmsfera sera imposible, como el planeta Mercurio. Si la Tierra fuera ms grande, su atmsfera contendra hidrgeno libre, como Jpiter. La Tierra es el nico planeta conocido que est equipado con una atmsfera adecuada para la vida de las plantas, los animales y los humanos.     La Tierra est localizada a la distancia exacta del sol. Considere las oscilaciones de temperatura que enfrentamos, aproximadamente entre 0 grados y 30 grados. Si la Tierra estuviera ms lejos del sol, todos nos congelaramos. Si estuviera ms cerca, nos quemaramos. Slo una variacin mnima en la posicin de la tierra respecto del sol y la vida en la Tierra sera imposible. La Tierra permanece a su distancia perfecta del sol mientras gira alrededor del sol a una velocidad aproximada de 100.000 km/h. Y la rotacin de la Tierra alrededor de su eje permite que toda la superficie de la tierra sea calentada y enfriada adecuadamente cada da.     Nuestra luna es del tama?o correcto y est a la distancia correcta de la Tierra. La luna crea importantes mareas ocenicas y movimientos para que el agua de los ocanos no se estanque, y sin embargo impide que nuestros gigantescos ocanos rebalsen sobre los continentes.     El agua. . . incolora, inodora e inspida, y sin embargo ninguna cosa viva puede sobrevivir sin ella. El agua no ha sido encontrada en ningn otro planeta, pero cubre el 70 por ciento de la superficie de la tierra. Las plantas, los animales y los seres humanos consisten en su mayor parte de agua. . . unos dos tercios del cuerpo humano es agua. Las caractersticas del agua estn adaptadas en forma nica a la vida:     Tiene el punto de ebullicin y de congelamiento inusualmente altos, permitindonos vivir en un medio de cambios constantes de temperatura, manteniendo nuestros cuerpos a unos 37,6 grados constantes. El agua es un solvente universal. Tome un vaso lleno de agua, agregue una taza de azcar y no se derrama nada por los costados; el agua simplemente absorbe el azcar. Esta propiedad del agua le permite llevar miles de elementos qumicos, minerales y nutrientes por nuestros cuerpos y has|`|3a82e1047277945c249d540685a9608eaa	Pues sigue asi, es decir, respetando su ideologia, y tu conserva la tuya, trata de hablar con el al respecto, q de la manera mas atenta l pides q respete tus creencias, y q eso no debe influir en la relacion de trabajo, si tu jefe es maduro lo comprendera, y obvio evita, ser muy grotesca en tu respuesta a los malos chistes q el hace, a  mi m paso mas o menos igual, hasta q ellos se dieron por vencidos y terminaron respetandome.|`|0a2ed2abb691fb8655ffe7fb084a7d08aa	respeta su decision de ser ateo.....y tu no trates de influir en los demas.... recuerda que no todo lo que brilla es oro, no todo lo que escuches es bueno o malo.

En una ocasin estaba un hombre creyente en una peluquera, el peluquero era ateo y le comenz a hablar al creyente sobre esto y le deca que no haba Dios.  En eso pas en la calle un hombre gre?udo, barbn y desarreglado.  El creyente le dijo al peluquero, sabes que me acabo de dar cuenta de que los peluqueros no existen....si existieran ho habra hombres as con el cabello sin cortar, desarreglados y barbudos.  El peluquero le deca , claro que existimos lo que pasa es que esos hombre no vienen con los peluqueros.... por eso es que andan as.  El creyente le contest, Exacto, Dios tambin existe, lo que pasa es que hay muchos hombres que no van a su encuentro....    As que karlita, no hagas caso, dice el Sagrado Corn que los incrdulos no cesarn hasta verte renegar de tu fe....  El insistir, pero ten paciencia, no entres en debate y haces bien en no intentar evangelizarlo... a esas personas da lo mismo que les hables de Dios a que no lo hagas.

d5491f278e41eb08d6e9a671f7b7426faa	Although God can give us any material thing, it is not very wise to approach God for material benefit. This is like approaching multi-millioner and asking him five dollars.  When approaching God we should ask to be engaged in His pure devotional service, because by pure devotional service we can come to the point where we will be able to even control God.  The way of praying is as follows:    Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare  Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare    It means "O energy of the Lord (Hare), o All-attractive One (Krishna), o Supreme Enjoyer (Rama), please engage me in your pure devotional service."  This prayer has a tremendous effect as showed by practical experience of many people. This prayer is extremely pleasing for God, if chanted purely.|`|266faf01fc038aa504a132b780d9b24aaa	Through prayers of the prophets nations were saved, disasters were stopped and sick people were healed.     In this prophet-less time, people do not see anymore these kind of incidents - seeing the prayer of the prophet being answered in front of their eyes. Therefore general public somehow has lost their belief in the powers of the prayers (this is not the case for practicing Muslims. We Muslims believe that God can answer your prayers if He wishes).    God has prescribed unto believing men and women to do the following:  1. Believe in God alone and not associate any other gods with Him  2. Establish 5 Daily Prayers  3. Fasting during the month of Ramadhan  4. Almsgiving to the poor  5. Pilgrimage to Mecca (for those who are financially able)    If we do all these, then Ishallah (God willing) Allah will be pleased with us. However it is certainly not enough if we want to thank Allah for everything He has given us. One day in Paradise wouldn't be comparable to your whole life prayers, even if you prayed non-stop.    Allah encourages us to ask, therefore we should always ask - first of all for forgiveness, so that we can meet Him in Paradise, so that we can be together with the ones He loves (prophets and righteous people), so that He saves us from Hellfire, so that we will be in a state of peace on the Judgement Day (everybody will be in a shocked state on Judgement Day). It's not a sin to ask for daily things that you need in this world, but we should give preference to Afterlife.    And Allah knows best.|`|bca33bc8dd2a297b50f236d767137d74aa	Well I don't know.

Prayers can make a difference (if we pray with right motives);  2. We please God with our prayers because we are talking with him.      To use an earthly analogy:  Does it please people that love you when you talk with them?  Even if it's about "meaningless" things?  Or just to say, "hello"?  Of course it does.  God's love far surpasses anything on earth and if we pray in this same way (i.e., talking with our heavenly Father) He will be pleased.      Does it please the ones who love you if the only time you talk to them is to ask them for something for yourself?  "Hi, Dad. I know it's been months since I talked with you.  I spent all of my money on junk, but now I really need something important.  Please send me some money! Please!"     Because he loves you, he might send you the money, but he probably won't be pleased to hear from you if that's the only time you call.    In the same way, God is more likely to give you the thing you requested if you are constantly talking with him and NOT always asking for stuff for yourself.  Have you prayed for your enemy?      Have you asked for something for yourself only so that you could help others?  Are your prayers only for stuff for yourself?      God is not your "genie-type of wish grantor" and neither has He promised you abundant wealth and health.  He has promised to take care of your daily needs.      The charlatans on TV that promise you God will give you a lot of money if you pray for it are wrong.  Even the Apostle Paul (who certainly did God's will) was beaten numerous times, was jailed numerous times, was hungry, shipwrecked, etc.  If you think you deserve better than he did, you would have to be one super individual!  God gives us what we need and only what we are able to handle with His help -- most of us can't really handle wealth:  we think we did it ourselves and don't need Him.|`|457454b885f8b5a78cb4f6115ebbf2d4aa	Pray coz Jesus told us to pray.|`|AA10551261	No, you can't get what you want by praying as in selfish desires.

Mis hijos tampoco me acompa?an, pero ellos ven que yo voy todos los domingos a misa y aunque muchas veces me dicen que no alguna vez me acompa?an para no dejarme ir sola. Y al final terminamos hablando del sermn del sacerdote, que por otra parte tambin los conocen...  Yo prefiero insistir desde mi humilde ejemplo, no solo cuando voy a misa, sino en mi forma de vida...pero te aseguro que  no es fcil ser buena cristiana...cuesta mucho.

7a8dd868925c4732d854879f4b8d27ccaa	Status quo es una frase latina, que se traduce como "estado de las cosas", que hace referencia al estado global de un asunto en un momento dado. Normalmente se trata de asuntos con dos partes interesadas ms o menos contrapuestas, en el que un conjunto de factores dan lugar a un cierto equilibrio (status quo) ms o menos duradero en el tiempo, sin que dicho equilibrio tenga que ser igualitario, (por ejemplo, en una situacin de dominacin existe un status quo a favor del dominador).    Relacionada con ella, la frase mantenimiento del status quo hace referencia a la continuacin de la situacin de equilibrio, aunque los factores individuales pueden cambiar, pero de forma complementaria, haciendo que se mantenga el estado de equilibrio global.    El concepto proviene del trmino diplomtico status quo ante bellum, que significa "como era antes de la guerra" en el sentido de recuperar la situacin de poder y liderazgo que haba antes de una guerra.    En el mbito de la poltica y la diplomacia, el trmino status quo se utiliza frecuentemente con el objetivo de mantener la ambigedad sobre la situacin a la que se refiere, de forma que se evita explicitar los factores de enfrentamiento que existen, aunque los interlocutores saben de qu se trata. En otras ocasiones simplemente se busca simplificar la conversacin, como resumen de los distintos elementos que intervienen.|`|3f010515157081418df39dc479c4870caa	?Hola!

Es por este motivo que se usa la frase "mantenimiento del status quo" haciendo referencia a que los grupos de poder dominantes en cada poca y contexto van a utilizar todos los medios a su disposicin para que permanezcan las condiciones que les permiten mantenerse en el poder y por lgica, evitar y contrarrestar cualquier situacin que atente en su contra.|`|ee99168bee2b607103dd19d3cd8a02ecaa	un estado de estabilidad y calma|`|d8b94901d8c31a1941fe3660f9b7599baa	para no ponerte lo que sale en wikipedia y confundirte mas el status quo es la manera en la que se encuentran las cosas a favor de alguien como en la pelicula national treasure el status quo esta a favor de los malos y casi siempre es asi cuando tienen algo con que chantajearte.|`|9ae075a691a26d99597fbcc28c114e6aaa	es el estado anterior de las cosas, suponiendo ke luego paso algo ke hizo ke esas cosas cambiaran. por ejemplo, el statu quo anterior a la revolucion francesa, era una situacion en la cual no todos tenian acceso al voto, ni a la libertad, habia muchas personas sometidas por los se?ores feudales. la revolucion francesa termino con ese estado de cosas, pero habia kienes kerian volver al "statu quo", o sea al estado de las cosas anterior a la revolucion francesa.|`|f8c7dcd195c7748e1062333d8a2ca464aa	Status quo es una frase latina, que se traduce como "estado de las cosas", que hace referencia al estado global de algo en un momento dado.

Para falarmos da Palavra de Deus  necessrio fe, por mnima que seja. A palavra de Deus se tornou necessria por causa do pecado. Antes porm,  preciso esclarecer que o homem levou algum tempo para aprender a escrita e, por isso, Deus nos Deu dois tipos de relvela??es: uma chamada Revela??o Geral e outra a Revela??o Especial. Como voc mencionou, a Revela??o Geral de Deus se fez e se faz atraves da Natureza; Rm 1.19 diz: "porquanto o que de Deus se pode conhecer neles se manifesta, porque Deus lho manifestou. Porque as suas coisas invisveis desde a cria??o do mundo, tanto o seu eterno poder como a sua divindade, se entendem e claramente se vem pelas coisas que est?o criadas, para que eles(os homens) fiquem indesculpveis". Leia todo o captulo 1, de Romanos e ters uma compreens?o melhor. O Salmo 19, tambm lan?a claridade a essa quest?o: Ele diz: "Os cus manifestam a glria de Deus e o firmamento anuncia a obra das suas m?os. Um dia faz declara??o a outro dia, e uma noite mostra sabedoria a outra noite. Sem linguagem, sem fala, ouvem-se as suas vozes em toda a extens?o da terra, e as suas palavras, at ao fim do mundo". Essa  a revela??o Geral. Mas houve a necessidade de uma revela??o especial, a escrita, por causa da queda do homem, e ai, veio a Palavra Escrita, que nos conhecemos como a Bblia Sagrada. O que esta Bblia diz para voc ela diz a qualquer um. O Problema  que a Bblia arrebenta com o ser humano. Ela acusa o ser humano, Ela mostra a podrid?o toda do homem e, ai vem a discordancia e as desculpas de "supostas interpreta??es", querendo se dar um "jeitinho". Deus n?o privilegiou, segunda a Blbia, apenas um povo para a Salva??o. "A gra?a de Deus se  manifestado, a todos os homens". Por causa desse negcio de que algum n?o sabe ler  que a Igreja catlica monopolizou o conhecimento das Escrituras apenas para a Igreja, proibindo-se mesmo que algum consultasse a Bblia e, deu no que deu; voc deve conhecer a histria. Veio a era das trevas, a idade mdia; um verdadeiro caos de conhecimento no mundo. Para se fazer a interpreta??o de um texto  necessrio um pouco de conhecimento,  obvio, mas uma pessoa que n?o sabe ler, n?o quer dizer que ela seja burra somente por isso. Ningum  burro. Voce pode ler para a pessoa ouvir e ela mesma entender, perfeitamente, o texto lido, se vc for explicando o significado das palavras. O fato  que, o ser humano  duro de cora??o e procura arrumar tudo que  desculpa, para permanecer em seu estado de rebeldia contra Deus.|`|f9e3fcd1894febe4e314829560e1b6adaa	Porque naquela epoca ainda n?o haviam DVDs, VHS, MP3, gravadore e etc !

Voc esta certo mas lembrese que o livro tem fun??o apenas para nos humanos.|`|18a11168033473076496c7e1ee802b4faa	Em primeiro lugar, DEUS usou pessoas, escolhidas a dedo, para que registrassem tudo que Ele falasse.   A grande curiosidade,  que profetas por exemplo, que viveram sculos antes dos apstolos, escreveram muitas coisas. Passados sculos, os apstolos, escreveram praticamente as mesmas coisas, sem tomar conhecimento destes escritos...  Muitos apstolos, escreveram separadamente o mesmo assunto, minuciosamente e com precis?o, sem que houvesse discordancia de um para com o outro. Como isto pode acontecer? Seria obra do acaso? N?o! Relataram ou aquilo que viram, ou aquilo que lhes era revelado. Percebe voc como realmente s poderia ser algo inspirado e verdico para que isto acontecesse?  Quanto a sua interpreta??o, cada um quer ler mas praticar da maneira que lhe convm, por exemplo: A Bblia diz que n?o devemos comer o sangue dos "animais", pois o sangue  a vida, entretanto, algumas pessoas interpretam que n?o devemos doar sangue. O que tem que haver o comer sangue de animais irracionais, com o doar sangue de ser humano? Por acaso a Bblia diz, que podemos comer carne humana, e tirar o sangue do indivduo, para n?o comer a vida?   Voc percebe que a interpreta??o da Bblia  clara e nica? Infelizmente, cada um quer por uma desculpa sobre o que l, e fazer n?o da maneira como est escrito, mas da forma como "ACHA" correto.  Praticamos aquilo que temos como sagrado, e confiamos, portanto, nossas obras s?o fruto daquilo que acreditamos...   comprovado que a Bblia  um livro verdico, confivel e inteiramente espiritual.   A salva??o de um pessoa, est limitada quilo que ela l e pratica, e n?o aquilo que acha ser correto. Todo ser humano, tem esta oportunidade, de entender qual  a vontade de um DEUS, que n?o quer libertinagem e sim; ordem e uni?o. Esta ordem e uni?o n?o vem de "interpreta??o individual", pois se fosse assim, cada um faria o que lhe fosse conveniente, e n?o seria preciso a presen?a de DEUS.   A interpreta??o da Palavra de DEUS, n?o est sujeita a minha opini?o, ou s minhas ansiedades.   Durante sculos, antes de que a Bblia fosse elaborada, as pessoas, seguiam o que os seus descendentes viam e ouviam, daqueles que tiveram um contato direto ou indireto com DEUS.   E depois que os livros da Bblia foram elaborados, todos n?o contradiziam esses contatos (boca-a-boca). Apenas complementaram...  A natureza como voc afirma,  capaz de mostrar muitas coisas, mas n?o de impor experincias ou ordens "morais", com  atitudes  e regras definidas... A natureza muda de uma hora pra outra expontaneamente, ou de acordo com a interferncia de seres humanos e DEUS n?o. A Palavra de DEUS  exclusiva (nica), e n?o est sujeita a intenpries, ou interferncias humanas.  Agora pense sobre isto....    Boa sorte|`|e4f86b719754b3c8127ebb3190162057aa	A prpria bblia declara que Deus se revelou aos homens atravs dos patriarcas, depois pelos profetas e depois atravs de Jesus, o qual designou alguns para apstolos que ensinaram a muitos discpulos.  Havia muita coisa escrita, desde Moiss at alguns apstolos e discpulos do come?o da era crist?. Foram juntados alguns  deles que n?o se contradiziam na essncia, e principalmente que trouxessem maior esclarecimento para aqueles que pudessem ler ou ouvir o que l est registrado.  Posso dizer que nunca havia me interessado pela bblia, e tambm j argumentei muito igualzinho a voc e outros que perguntam e respondem aqui sobre esse tema, s depois que conheci melhor seu contedo e comparando com as coisas que ocorreram, est?o ocorrendo e que diz que v?o acontecer,  que pude ver que h mais do que simplesmente letras em um papel.  Quando um discpulo (Felipe)  foi chamar seu amigo (Natanael) para que viesse conhecer Jesus, este duvidou que Jesus pudesse ser profeta ou o Messias, ent?o Felipe lhe disse: Vem e v !  O mesmo eu posso lhe dizer, porque eu vi e cri, quanto  a voc, pelo que escreveu, e a outros pela resposta que deram, tenho certeza de que n?o conhecem o contedo da bblia.

Y como asunto adicional, debera abrirse otra fundacin con fines parecidos al Teletn, pero con destinos diferentes, me refiero a todas las poblaciones, que por cierto, son incontables, pero existen, y se ven solo cuando los postulados hacen campa?as, las visitan y hasta mandan gente para recolectar su voto, les prometen de todo y luego las olvidan, ah, donde abunda la pobreza, la enfermedad, el intenso fro y creo hasta la desesperanza, ah se podran ir destinando todos los recursos recaudados, tanto de dinero para financiar a los campesinos, hasta los de especie de aquellas empresas que aportan todo lo concerniente a las instalaciones elctricas, la cementeras para la construccin de sus calles y todas las dems que se encargan de abastecer las redes de agua y alcantarillado, sera maravilloso que existiera una fundacin as, y no es un sue?o, ojal alguien apoyara esta idea, porque si somos honestos, los recursos que el gobierno supuestamente destina para estos asuntos, jams llega a su destino y los pobres, sobre todo los ni?os y ancianos mueren sin haber tomado nunca un vaso con agua potable, o haber sabido que era darse un ba?o con agua caliente, ni tan siquiera enterarse que existen caramelos y chocolates que le dan a la vida un poco dulzura.......parece un sue?o, verdad????

Queremos que la felicidad llegue como por arte de magia, eso aunado a que hay personas que tratan de negociar con la felicidad, hace que se convierta en un negocio redondo.

Sie besteht aus einzelnen Schriften. Darin haben Menschen aufgeschrieben, was ihnen der gro?e Gott gesagt hat.     Die Bcher der Bibel werden in zwei gro?e Teile geteilt. Der erste Teil ist gleichzeitig fr die Juden und die Christen ein heiliges Buch: das Alte Testament. Der zweite Teil ist nur fr die Christen ein heiliges Buch: man nennt es das Neue Testament.     Ein Buch ber die Anf?nge   Am Anfang des Alten Testaments wird berichtet, wie Gott alles gemacht hat; z.B. die Welt, die wir sehen. Zuerst war alles gut. Dann haben die ersten Menschen sich von Gott abgewandt, und so fing die Not an. Vieles ging sehr schlimm aus. Und immer wieder hat Gott versucht, die Menschen zu sich zurckzuholen. Manche wollten dies, die meisten aber nicht.     Einmal hat er alle Menschen in einer Wasserflut vernichtet, die die ganze Erde berschwemmte. Nur die Familie des gottesfrchtigen Noah lie? Gott am Leben. Aus dieser Zeit stammen die versteinerten Pflanzen und Tiere, die man finden kann. Und wieder lange Zeit sp?ter hat er einen Mann gerufen, ihm zu gehorchen, Abraham. Von ihm stammt das jdische Volk ab.     Ein Buch ber die Geschichte Gottes mit dem jdischen Volk   Dann wird ber die Geschichte Gottes mit dem jdischen Volk berichtet. Von seinen Anf?ngen, seiner Gefangenschaft in ?gypten und anschlie?enden Befreiung. Wie das Volk Israel das von Gott versprochene Land einnimmt und darin wohnt, und wie es sp?ter auf Grund seines Ungehorsams gegen Gott aus dem Land wieder vertrieben wird. Dann erz?hlt die Bibel, wie die Juden nach siebzig Jahren wieder in das Land zurckkehren durften. Hiermit enden die geschichtlichen Bcher. Es folgen Gebete des Volkes Gottes, die Psalmen. Und dann die Bcher der M?nner, die Gott immer wieder beauftragt hat, dem Volk seinen Willen zu sagen. Man nennt sie die "Propheten". Damit endet der erste gro?e Teil der Bibel.     Ein Buch ber Jesus Christus und die ersten Gemeinden   Vor fast 2000 Jahren ist Jesus, der Sohn Gottes, in Jud?a geboren worden. Und davon wird nun im zweiten Teil, dem Neuen Testament, berichtet. Von dem, was er gesagt und getan hat. Wie er auf dieser Erde lebte und dann fr die Menschen starb und wieder auferstand. Es wird auch berichtet, wie anschlie?end an vielen verschiedenen Orten Gemeinden entstanden. Hier treffen sich die, die Jesus Christus lieben und ihm nachfolgen wollen, und in der Gemeinde feiern sie Gottesdienst. Sp?ter wurde aus vielen Gemeinden eine Organisation: die Kirche.     Die Schriften, die dann folgen, sind Briefe an verschiedene Gemeinden. Die meisten von ihnen sind von dem Apostel Paulus geschrieben. Die Bibel endet mit einem Buch, das uns ber das Ende der Welt und Gottes Sieg erz?hlt. Es hei?t die Offenbarung. Der Apostel Johannes hat sie geschrieben.|`|e2b23e965833125c0fc5119c66212cf1aa	Eigentlich glaube ich nicht einen Mann oder eine Generation die Bibel geschrieben hast, sonder ist es eine berlieferung von Wissen und Gedanken ber Jahrtausend.

M?nche und Geistliche in Kl?stern brauchten ca. 3 - 4 Jahre fr das Abschreiben eines Buches. 616 n. Chr. schrieb Tuma (Thomas) Harkloyo die letzte Ausgabe. Von dieser alten Bibel werden heute noch in der Wiener Kaiserlichen Bibliothek 26 Seiten aufbewahrt.     1452 wurde die Bibel erstmals durch die Erfindung des Mainzers Johannes Gutenberg gedruckt. 180 Gutenbergbibeln wurden vor Ablauf des Jahres 1456 gedruckt, heute sind noch 48 Exemplare davon erhalten.|`|d8e4ab3a9c417e922f1630e0d8c01b38aa	Die Bibel besteht aus ca. 66 Bchern.

Bis mir mein Pastor erst mal klar gemacht hat, wie umfangreich das Thema ist.. Da hatte mein Lehrer ein Einsehen, und hat das Referat auf das NT beschr?nkt.    Nun gut, wie allgemein bekannt, teilt sich die Bibel in zwei Bcher.    Die Frage lautet, zun?chst einmal, warum genau diese Bcher ausgew?hlt wurden, Bestandteil der Bibel zu sein, die es jetzt sind.  Dazu geh?rt auch die Frage, wer diese Auswahl getroffen hat. Und warum andere Schriften au?en vor geblieben sind.    Und dann folgt die noch Frage, wer diese einzelnen Bcher geschrieben hat und wie sie entstanden sind. Ob es einzelne Autoren waren - oder sie selber eine Sammlung von mehreren Autoren sind.    Ach ja, und dann bleibt da noch die Frage nach Verf?lschungen durch versehentliche oder absichtliche Schreibfehler bei handschriftlicher Vervielf?ltigung. Und natrlich wem diese Verf?lschungen zuzuordnen sind.    Also, viel Spa? bei der Recherche der vollst?ndigen Antwort!  Der Platz dazu reicht hier wohl kaum aus.

September 2001 in den USA/Ablauf    Das erste Anzeichen der Entfhrungen war das Ausfallen des Transpondersignals von American Airlines Flug 11 um 8:20 Uhr Ortszeit (12:20:40 UTC). Kurze Zeit sp?ter wurde durch einen Anruf der Stewardess Madeline Amy Sweeney bei der Bodenkontrolle best?tigt, dass es sich um eine Entfhrung handelte. Sp?tere Ermittlungen ergaben, dass die Entfhrung gegen 8:15 Uhr geschah, als auch United Airlines Flug 175 abhob.    Gegen 8:38 Uhr wurde NORAD, die zentrale Stelle zur Luftverteidigung, ber die Vorf?lle informiert, verbunden mit der Bitte um eine visuelle berprfung von Flug 11 durch Milit?rflugzeuge. Um 8:45 Uhr, ungef?hr zur selben Zeit, zu der auch Flug 175 der United Airlines entfhrt wurde, starteten zwei F-15. Der abgeschaltete Transponder hinderte die Fluglotsen jedoch, deren Piloten sofort die Position von Flug 11 mitzuteilen.    Um 8:46 Uhr Ortszeit (12:46:40 UTC) flog American Airlines Flug 11 in den Nordturm des World Trade Centers. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt ging man noch von einem Unfall aus. Im Sdturm wurden die Menschen durch Lautsprecherdurchsagen aufgefordert, Ruhe zu bewahren und an ihrem Arbeitsplatz zu bleiben. 17 Minuten sp?ter, um 9:03 Uhr (13:03 UTC) flog das zweite Flugzeug (United Airlines Flug 175) in den Sdturm des WTC.    Damit wurde den Beh?rden klar, dass es sich nicht um einen Unfall, sondern einen gezielten Angriff handelte. Daraufhin wurden nach und nach alle Zivilflge in den USA eingestellt und Abfangj?ger gestartet, um New York zu schtzen.    American Airlines Flug 77 war zwischen 8:50 und 9:00 Uhr entfhrt worden. Um 9:37 Uhr Ortszeit flog der Jet in das Pentagon und schlug einen Tunnel durch das Geb?ude. Die Sch?den und das nachfolgende Feuer bewirkten dann gegen 10:10 Uhr den Einsturz der besch?digten Abschnitte.    Als Reaktion auf diesen weiteren Angriff wurden gegen 9:45 Uhr alle Flugzeuge unter Androhung eines Abschusses aufgefordert, den n?chstm?glichen Flughafen anzusteuern. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt befand sich das vierte Flugzeug, United Airlines Flug 93, allerdings schon in der Gewalt der Entfhrer. Als sein Anschlagsziel werden das Wei?e Haus, das Kapitol in Washington oder der Landsitz des US-Pr?sidenten in Camp David vermutet. Um 10:03 Uhr strzte es infolge eines Kampfes zwischen den Entfhrern und den Geiseln an Bord in der N?he von Pittsburgh ab. Entgegen ersten Berichten brachten die Entfhrer, nicht die Geiseln, das Flugzeug zum Absturz.    Mit zusammen rund 90 m3 Treibstoff wirkten die in das WTC geflogenen Jets wie gro?e Brandbomben.

You don't know what kind of person will show up after you arrange a meeting.  Stop dating that way and you will be safer.  There are 2 known sexual predators in my neighborhood and one is using the Internet.  Until he commits another crime, there is nothing the police can do.    You want to meet decent guys, try going to church, though that is no 100% guarantee, but it is much less risky than on-line stuff.

Elle est universellement considre comme un idal.    Au plan collectif, la paix dsigne ainsi l'absence de violence ou de guerre entre groupes humains. En ce sens la paix entre les nations est l'objectif de nombreux hommes et organisations comme la dfunte SDN ou l'actuelle ONU. Dans cette acception, certaines idologies comme le nazisme rprouvent la paix, qui amollit les hommes, et au contraire exaltent la guerre. Un bon contre-exemple en est le "village de la paix" de Neve Shalom - Wahat as Salam qui oeuvre pour la paix entre israliens et palestiniens.    Au plan individuel, la paix dsigne galement un tat d'esprit personnel, exempt de colre, de crainte, et plus gnralement de sentiments ngatifs. Elle est donc souhaite pour soi-mme et ventuellement pour les autres, au point de devenir une salutation (la paix soit sur toi, salam alei kum en arabe, shalom en hbreu) ou un but de vie.    L'articulation entre la paix et son oppos (guerre, violence, conflit, colre, etc.) est une des clefs de nombreuses doctrines, religieuses ou politiques, clef fondamentale bien que gnralement non explicite. Savoir quel est l'tat naturel ou originel de l'Homme (paisible ou violent), et comment il passe de l'un  l'autre, conditionne en effet :        * le statut de l'individu, (fauve  dompter ? esclave  librer ?), tout particulirement dans son jeune age (idal  retrouver ? ou animal  surveiller ?), mais aussi en tant que majeur (prdateur goiste, que la socit et l'tat doivent surveiller ? ou paisible responsable, qui ne fera appel  la force publique que pour se dfendre d'abus ?)      * la formation des enfants (part respective de l'ducation et de l'enseignement, dure, etc.).      * les moyens admissibles (force aussi brute que celle du violent rebelle, ou douceur librale ?)      * la valeur de la civilisation (corruptrice du bon sauvage ou apaisante du barbare ?)      * le statut et la place des organisations (tat, entreprises, syndicats, etc.) : nuisibles  dtruire, moindres maux ncessaires, ou bien piliers du systme ?      * la place absolue et relative des activits matrielles et spirituelles (dans quelle mesure sont-elles, pour le maintien ou l'acquisition de la paix, indispensables, utiles, inutiles, ou nuisibles ?)      * etc.    Dans le yi-king, l'hexagramme oppos  celui de la paix est celui de la stagnation. Symboliquement, cela indique que la paix n'est pas un absolu, mais une recherche permanente. Et que le conflit n'est pas l'oppos de la paix. Il convient dans une dmarche de paix de transformer le conflit, non pas de le supprimer. Les dmarches non-violentes incarnent cette dmarche de transformation pacifique du conflit.    Comme l'indique le prambule de l'Unesco ? c'est dans l'esprit des hommes que naissent les guerres, c'est dans leur esprit qu'il faut riger les dfenses de la paix ?.    Au cours des dernires annes, plusieurs universits de paix ont t fondes, comme l'universit de la paix de l'ONU, au Costa Rica (UPEACE), l'universit de la paix de Brasilia (UNIPAZ), ou l'Universit de Paix de Namur. Elles dispensent un enseignement qui permet de prendre conscience de l'action individuelle sur la paix, et de l'impact collectif de cette action (chef d'?uvre de paix inspire par le compagnonnage  UNIPAZ). Ces formations touchent l'cologie intrieure, sociale et environnementale.    Dans la mythologie grecque, Irne ou Eirn est une divinit allgorique personnifiant la Paix.|`|b522fd5480df4a866bfc9a5365ff51d7aa	Non c'est une honte de faire des difference de nos jours y'a plus de frontiere on devree etre libre chacun d'aller et venir comme bon nous semble non.

Conocida como Masonera, Francmasonera, Fraternidad, o Logia, los masones son, con toda seguridad, la sociedad secreta ms influyente de la historia. Sin embargo, no est tan claro cual fue su origen y, mucho menos, la naturaleza de sus actividades. La Francmasonera toma su nombre de la etimologa francesa: Franc: libre y mason alba?il, es decir, alba?il libre.   Con ello se alude a lo que ellos mismos consideran su verdadero origen: la comunidad de alba?iles que, bajo la direccin del arquitecto Hiram de Tiro, construy el Templo de Salomn de Jerusaln. Este personaje habra sido el primer mason e hijo de una mujer viuda, de ah el apelativo que tambin reciben los miembros de la fraternidad: Los Hijos de la Viuda.|`|e270ca7c9f392cc9bcf8ff6a748352a7aa	SI CLARO ES ALGO METAFORICO, PERO ESTA RELACINADO DIRECTAMENTE CON LA MASONERIA, EL HIJO DE LA VIUDA , NO ES SOLAMENTE A AQUELLOS A QUIENES SE LES AYUDA, SINO QUE HAY UNA HISTORIA MUY ANTIGUA DONDE SIEMPRE ALGUN MASON ES "HIJO DE UNA MADRE VIUDA"  DE AHI EL TERMINO HIJOS DE LA VIUDA

A Biblia n?o diz nada de um primeira pessoa, segunda e terceira pessoa.Mas sim, que Deus foi manifestado em carne:    "E sem dvida alguma grande  o mistrio da piedade:Aquele que se manifestou em carne, foi justificado em espirito, visto dos anjos, pregado aos gentios, crido no mundo, e recebido acima na glria." (1 Tim. 3:16)    Isso devia por fim ao assunto.Deus veio em forma humana.    Ele era Senhor e Cristo, porm o tabernculo de fora que os homens podiam ver foi chamado Jesus.    "Esteja absolutamente certa, pois, toda a casa de Israel, que este Jesus que vs crucificaste,Deus o fez Senhor e Cristo."(Atos 2:36).    Podes ver ai? SENHOR JESUS CRISTO.    Se Jesus  Senhor e Cristo, ent?o Ele (Jesus)  e n?o pode ser outra coisa menos que "Pai, Filho e Espirito", em uma pessoa manifesta em carne.E n?o trs pessoas, mas um Deus manifesto em trs ttulos maiores.    Em Apocalpse diz plenamente que Jesus  "O que ","O que era", e"Oque h de vir".Ele  o Alfa e o ?mega, o que significa que Ele  o"A at o Z",ou melhor, o Tudo.Ele  o Deus Poderoso. Ele  a Rosa de Saron, o Lrio dos Vales, a Estrela resplandecente da Manh?, a Videira Verdadeira, o Pai, o Filho e o Esprito Santo.Ele  Deus,Deus Todo Poderoso.O nico Deus.    "Deus construiu para S mesmo uma Casa(Jesus) e nela habitou em plenitude"(Colossenses 2:9)    N?o sou unicista e nem trinitariana..ambos est?o fora da Palavra de Deus.    Agora, em meio a tanta confus?o religiosa, ao se deparar com a Verdade,  muito natural que algumas indaga??es surjam na mente daqueles que realmente anseiam pela verdade.E  sabendo disso que me proponho a tirar qualquer dvida atravez da Palavra de Deus.

Entenda que n?o pode haver uma roupagem para Deus, porque  muita arrogancia da maioria das religi?es reputar a Ele uma imagem humanizada. Afinal, at hoje NINGUM viu Deus. Ele criou tudo, portanto le  uno e indivisvel.     Alis me desculpem os catlicos e evanglicos, mas a ora??o Ave Maria possui o erro mais calamitoso das religi?es quando diz "... Santa Maria, m?e de Deus...". Que que  isso ! ! ! Deus n?o tem e nunca teve m?e, sen?o ele n?o seria Deus. Deus  Criador e n?o criatura. Fosse assim, Maria seria Deus, pois ela O teria criado.    Jesus Cristo, um dos espritos mais elevados e mais prximos  perfei??o de Deus, a exemplo de Maom, foi-nos enviado para transmitir o que o Pai Supremo deseja de ns e como devemos nos portar afim de que trilhemos o caminho do crescimento espiritual, que passa necessariamente, pela depura??o moral.

Santo ao mesmo tempo. A doutrina n?o  nova. Os escandinavos tinham-na como Odin, Thor e Frei. Os Egpcios antigos, sis, Osris e Hrus. Nos antigos escritos vdicos, Brama, Visnu e Shiva, e assim por diante. A cristandade apenas aproveitou a dica. Certa fonte evanglica, que n?o acredita nessa doutrina, diz que um +um+um s?o trs e n?o um. Realmente as Escrituras Judaicas e crist?s mostram claramente que Deus  eterno. Cristo, o princpio da cria??o e o E. Santo, a for?a ativa de Deus sendo derramada sobre as suas criaturas. Mas eu acredito que a trindade, mesmo n?o sendo um termo bblico,  apenas mal-entendida. De fato quem v Jesus v o Pai, como ele disse a Felipe. Tambm disse que "Eu e o Pai somos UM", mas em outro lugar declara: "contudo o Pai  MAIOR do que eu". O que podemos deduzir dessa toada? Deus n?o  uma pessoa como ns,  mais como um oceano eterno de energia espiritual viva, onde todos ns, como peixinhos, vivemos imersos. Deus, portanto, est em ns e fora de ns. Como declarou o Rei Salom?o na inaugura??o do Templo de Jeov, Deus transborda todos os universos densos ou espirituais, logo n?o poderia ser uma pessoa finita, como ns. Imaginemos uma gotinha do oceano. Ela poderia dizer: "eu e o oceano somos um" e poderia dizer tambm: "mas o oceano  maior do que eu". Jesus foi a maior e mais pura gotinha. Ns ainda estamos arrolhados como garrafas dentro deste oceano, precisando nos tornar unos com ele, mas tambm somos gotinhas, como Jesus. Creio firmemente, que O Esprito Santo se manifestou como o Pai no antigo pacto da Lei, como Filho, na pessoa de Jesus Cristo, mas sempre como um Santo Esprito, alm da cria??o e das criaturas, que precisam retornar a Ele como parte e parcelas conscientes do Esprito Santo Universal, para que, como disse Paulo," Deus seja tudo em todos".

Uma cabe?a com 3 faces   encontrada em objetos religiosos datados de eras pre-crist?s. Portanto a trindade n?o  crist?. "O pai (Jeov)  maior que Eu", disse Jesus.

Galen KittlesonEquipo De Nellist     En una sociedad donde estn duros los hroes verdaderos de venir cerca, los lectores necesitan parecer no ms futuros que el raider de Charles W. Sasser (St. Martins, 2002). De acuerdo con la carrera militar extraordinaria de la leyenda Galen Kittleson, que de las fuerzas especiales lleva a cabo la distincin de ser el nico hombre en la historia militar de ESTADOS UNIDOS a participar en cuatro tentativas de la liberacin del PRISIONERO DE GUERRA en dos guerras, el libro chronicles el viajede Kittleson s de un muchacho de granja fresco-hecho frente de 19-year-old Iowa en la Segunda Guerra Mundial a una boina verde sazonada 45-year-old en Vietnam.    Como paracaidista joven en WW II, Kittleson gan una estrella de plata en la isla de Noemfoor en el sudoeste el Pacfico. Despus de ser seleccionado como explora un miembro de la lite Alamo, la sexta unidadespecial del reconocimiento del ejrcito s, Kittleson particip en dos liberaciones acertadas del preso. El primer en Nueva Guinea holandesa, en donde dos equipos de los exploradores de Alamo liberaron a 66 holandeses, a Javanese, y a civiles franceses del japons en el cabo Oransbari. Cuatro meses ms adelante en enero de 1945, Kittleson e igual los equipos del explorador, junto con 121 guardabosques y unidades filipinas del guerrilla, liberaron POWs aliado 513 del campo del PRISIONERO DE GUERRA de Cabanatuan en una incursin brillante de la noche. La incursin era el primer lanzamiento en grande del preso en las Filipinas y electrified la nacin.    Despus de una vuelta de diez a?os a la vida civil, Kittleson pic para la accin. l contest a militares y fue aceptado en las fuerzas especiales, donde l pas el resto de su carrera, retirndose en 1978. Durante la guerra de Vietnam, Kittleson procur localizar y liberar las fuerzas especiales capitn, mella Rowe. En 1970, el golpe de 45-year-old Kittleson fuera edad de las boinas verdes de la mitad de su para conseguir una grieta en la liberacin de los mecnicos de ESTADOS UNIDOS sostuvo en el campo infame del PRISIONERO DE GUERRA de Tay del hijo fuera de Hanoi. Aunque la incursin atrevida profundamente en el territorio enemigo dio lugar a ningn POWs que era recuperado (los haban movido), fue granizada como un xito militar y otra validacin del concepto de las fuerzas especiales.    El raider es efectivo, bien-escrito, y abrogara a todos los lectores. Es incluso una mezcla de la biografa, de la historia militar, y de los valores midwestern de las aw-vainas asperjados con un tacto de la empanada de manzana y del pan hecho en casa. Pero en un sentido ms grande es una historia del amor. Amor del pas. Amor de la familia. Amor de camarada-en-brazos. Kudos a Sasser para superar el obstculo cercano-insuperable de conseguir Kittleson para hablar s mismo y para un trabajo masterful que transportaba los sacrificios y las dificultades personales aguant por Kittleson y su familia con perodos largos de la separacin y de la guerra. Pero el libro no es una bandera estril duda con un super hroe chillo'n-limpio en su base. Algo, es una mirada apasionada en un hombre ordinario con las averas de que, con dise?o o sino, era el hombre adecuado en el lugar derecho en el tiempo derecho, y de las cuales, con los hombres del mettle y de la ayuda similares am unos hogar trasero, hizo cosas extraordinarias.     La nica desventaja al raider es ese tenido que para terminar. El libro vuela cerca y dejan el lector el deseo ms, sacando las pginas para cada gota pasada de lo que es ese Kittleson tiene que necesitamos en nuestros hroes, pero no podemos poner un nombre a. Esencialmente, es Kittlesons reservado, carcter unassuming; la yuxtaposicin del granjero-guerrero que resuena a travs del libro y hace que el lector se pregunta si existe la gente como Kittleson realmente. Cualquier persona que sea siempre un prisionero de guerra, espermoslo.    ?Consiga el libro!

Non si pu fare un discorso serio.  Direi che al nord sono realmente pi circospetti e controllati, per pi facilmente che al sud un discorso si pu svolgere in clima civile.  Al sud sono pi calorosi ma hanno meno controllo sui loro impulsi. Questo credo dipenda dalla repressione familiare che  molto forte nel sud. I figli sono allevati in modo molto meno libarale per cui a volte gli istinti repressi esplodono.   Credo che serva un equilibrio fra razionalit e istinti, se prevale l'uno o l'altro o c' freddezza o impulsi non filtrati, cio non ragionati.|`|7454885700e3258a1680eb776cb73790aa	 l'impressione del momento, dipende dall'educazione che si riceve, non essere invadenti, ma non  che siano pi fredde e distaccate, in realt sono come quelli del sud, semplicemente hanno modi diversi per esprimere i sentimenti, basta conoscerli bene|`|f9c522953148dab2ddc40efd9c91d630aa	E perk al Sud sono cos  socievoli con tutti?

Dunque , quella che in noi nordici viene erroneamente scambiata per "freddezza" in realt e' semplicemente un modo differente di relazionarsi col prossimo dovuto in massima parte dallo stile di vita notoriamente frenetico che ci porta a consolidare un minor numero di relazioni (nella maggior parte molto durevoli) piuttosto che avere una lunga serie di conoscenti della cui amicizia non puoi essere mai veramente certo.spero di averti risposto esaurientemente e ti auguro una buona giornata|`|579f854f1cfa0d84c89cfe371ef907a9aa	basta coi pregiudizi please...siamo persone razionali suvvia!|`|bede625fbabe7735ef9aa4c56f573ba5aa	forse non conosci davvero le persone del nord...  le parole come educazione, riservatezza,professionalit non ti dicono niente?  la prima impressione  quella che impongono il ruolo ed il contesto: se incontri uno del nord per lavoro quella che definisci freddezza  universalmente reputata professionalit, se invece la contingenza riguarda rapporti meno formali  riservatezza..se ci incontri sulle spiagge e per le strade  educazione....  forse non hai amici del nord e non fatico a capirne la motivazione visto il pressapochismo di questa domanda, e poi i razzisti eravamo noi.....|`|5b7f867048ea7d9111d19e337b32b3deaa	Prova a condividere una bottiglia di vino con un tedesco e scoprirai che sono tutt'altro che freddi e distaccati.|`|41e34de8fed395e02ba5e5075078a1dfaa	Ti volevo dire che non lo credo assolutamente vero, pur se cos dicendo hai fatto un complimento a quelli del su, me comprasa che sono di Napoli e fiera di esserlo.

Io per esempio ho vissuto 3 anni a La Spezia e tutt'ora ho un ricordo magnifico sia della citt che delle persone, ma penso ci sia una spiegazione a questa differenza di carattere. Io non parlerei proprio di freddezza quanto di indipendenza, ho infatti notato che su al Nord le persone tendono a staccarsi dal nucleo familiare molto prima (certo al sud questo non capita per via della mancanza di lavoro), di conseguenza diventano subiti indipendenti e si dedicano alla loro nuova vita. Al sud invece i rapporti familiari sono pi sentiti, e non parlo solo di quelli con la propria famiglia ma anche di zii, cugini ecc, si da grande importanza all' amicizia... io per esempio esco ancora con i miei amici delle elementari e non posso pensare di passare un Natale senza di loro o la mia famiglia... Comunque ci tengo a precisare che non tutte le persone del Nord sono fredde, infatti, io ho molti amici che sento regolarmente e che non mancano di venirmi a trovare quando possono.  E vorrei dire alla persona che dice che al nord sono freddi perch lavorano anche per noi di non affannarsi tanto, visto che lavoriamo, quando possiamo anche qui, il mio fidanzato lavora 10 ore al giorno e non dietro una scrivania eppure non manca di coccolarmi o di organizzare un' uscita con gli amici anche se  stanco morto... forse dovresti farti qualche amico anche tu caro amico del Nord...|`|0900bebd2e82896a91f178644619c156aa	Ma non  vero....anche qui al nord c' gente calorosa.....sono per tutti gli immigrati che son venuti dal sud!

Ora, non voglio generalizzare, siamo tutti diversi, e io sono cresciuta nella realt di un piccolo paese, ma la tendenza di pensiero che ho avvertito,  questa. mi spiace vederlo e mi spiace ammetterlo, ma al sud si sta meglio con molto meno di quello che abbiamo qua.|`|cf116737a6db7f16f93dce44f0a36b48aa	...non  vero....io sono socievole con tutti!!|`|4c9b611458b3866a8d72aaba481f63d2aa	Siamo Meno invadenti e passionali ( un passionale inteso come  esagerato come al sud ke si uccidono per amore.. ke romantici!!!!)

Fr mich eine gute Frage, die ich mir auch oft stelle. Ich wei?, wie ich bin, wie ich auf andere wirke, was ich mache und wie ich es mache. Dementsprechend kann man so schonmal damit umgehen, wie wahr das Kompliment von dem Gegenber ist, da man im Normalfall schon wissen sollte, wer man ist und was man kann. Jedoch kommt es hierbei auf die Pers?nlichkeit des Individuums an. Wenn ich mein Gegenber schon l?nger kenne und das auch nicht nur sporadisch, und man sich eben selbst auch kennt, dann wei? man eigentlich, ob es wahrheitsgetreu ist oder eben nicht. Bei flchtigen Bekannten ist das anders, denn die kennen einen meist noch nicht so gut und haben vielleicht einen anderen Eindruck von der Person, und k?nnen einen somit vielleicht auch ?fter und eher falsch einsch?tzen. Es gibt auch Menschen, die selbst gar nicht wissen, wer sie berhaupt sind und denken sie seien anders, als sie selbst denken. Oft gibt es Menschen, die sehr von sich selbst berzeugt sind und denken, sie seien die besten und machen alles perfekt, was auch immer sie angreifen. Wenn man also auch eine gute Menschenkenntnis hat und das Pers?nlichkeitsbild eines Menschen ziemlich gut einsch?tzen kann, dann tut man sich leichter, wie man mit einem Kompliment umgehen kann udn wei? ob es vertrauensvoll ist oder nicht.  Ich selbst tu mich eigentlich ziemlich schwer mit Komplimenten, z.B. wenn es auch mit der Arbeit zu tun hat. Denn meistens wei? ich, dass es nicht perfekt ist, was ich gemacht habe und ich wei? auch, dass ich es besser kann. Ein Kompliment hebt einen davon dann weg, doch ich glaube es dann eher nicht, weil ich eben wei?, dass ich es besser kann und es so nicht stimmt, wie es mir mein Gegenber versucht darzustellen. Ich selbst kann auch gut mit negativer Kritik umgehen, im Gegensatz zu positiver Kritik, da ich eigentlich ein sehr selbstkritischer Mensch bin und mich nicht schnell mit etwas zufrieden gebe. Ich m?chte, dass es perfekt ist, doch oft fehlt mir dann noch das n?tige K?nnen dafr, dementsprechend empfinde ich positive Kritik dann eher als unwahr.    Es kommt meiner Meinung nach also eigentlich immer auf die Pers?nlichkeit des Menschen an, wer er ist, wie er aussieht, was fr ein Selbstbildnis er hat, was fr eine Einstellung er hat, wie er auf andere wirkt, welches Auftreten er hat usw. und auch was fr eine Menschenkenntnis er hat. Und natrlich auch, mit welchen Menschen er es zu tun hat, der ihm/ihr ein Kompliment macht.|`|af367b0318938ae6d1148e206d2799a0aa	zun?chst mal sollte man jedes kompliment h?flich annehmen. ob du daran glaubst, ist eine andere sache und h?ngt wohl auch von der vertrauenswrdigkeit der person ab, die das kompliment ausspricht.  ich sage mal, grunds?tzlich ja. du kannst komplimente glauben. doch da jeder grundsatz auch seine ausnahmen hat solltest du fr dich von fall zu fall entscheiden.|`|80435cdbc6f18bac0ea873dfa63c82ebaa	Kommt immer darauf an,wer sie ausspricht.|`|399dbb4439b4602d032000fc20d99acbaa	Hoer auf Deine Gefuehle, dann weist Du Becheid.|`|e3ddc41cc99c92477aaaff30ad842128aa	Glauben, nein ... genie?en, ja  !|`|50de2c0dbf9bf97bb160bd0574c96bb5aa	Kommt velleicht drauf an, von wem man die Kompliment bekommt und vor allem, was fr welche.

Su presencia o su ausencia en el cielo determinan, respectivamente, el da y la noche. La energa radiada por el Sol es aprovechada por los seres fotosintticos, que constituyen la base de la cadena trfica, siendo as la principal fuente de energa de la vida. Tambin aporta la energa que mantiene en funcionamiento los procesos climticos. El Sol es una estrella de la secuencia principal, con un tipo espectral G2, que se form hace unos 5 mil millones de a?os y permanecer en la secuencia principal aproximadamente otros 5 mil millones de a?os. El Sol, junto con la Tierra y todos los cuerpos celestes que orbitan a su alrededor, forman el Sistema Solar.    A pesar de ser una estrella mediana, es la nica cuya forma se puede apreciar a simple vista, con un dimetro angular de 32' 35" de arco en el perihelio y 31' 31" en el afelio, lo que da un dimetro medio de 32' 03". Por una extra?a coincidencia, la combinacin de tama?os y distancias del Sol y la Luna son tales que se ven, aproximadamente, con el mismo tama?o aparente en el cielo. Esto permite una amplia gama de eclipses solares distintos (totales, anulares o parciales).

Gracias a la metalicidad de dicho gas, de su disco circumstelar surgieron, ms tarde, los planetas, asteroides y cometas del Sistema Solar. En el interior del Sol se producen reacciones de fusin en las que los tomos de hidrgeno se transforman en helio, producindose la energa que irradia. Actualmente, el Sol se encuentra en plena secuencia principal, fase en la que seguir unos 5000 millones de a?os ms quemando hidrgeno de manera estable. Cuando el hidrgeno de su ncleo sea mucho menos abundante ste se contraer y se encender la capa de hidrgeno adyacente, pero esto no bastar para retener el colapso. Seguir compactndose hasta que su temperatura sea lo suficientemente elevada como para fusionar el helio del ncleo (unos 100 000 000 K). Al mismo tiempo, las capas exteriores de la envoltura se irn expandiendo paulatinamente. Se expandirn tanto que, a pesar del aumento de brillo de la estrella, su temperatura efectiva disminuir, situando su luz en la regin roja del espectro. El Sol se habr convertido en una gigante roja. El radio del Sol, para entonces, ser tan grande que habr engullido a Mercurio, Venus y, posiblemente, a la Tierra. Durante su etapa como gigante roja (unos 1000 millones de a?os) el Sol ir expulsando gas cada vez con mayor intensidad. En los ltimos momentos de su vida el viento solar se intensificar y el Sol se desprender de toda su envoltura, la cual formar, con el tiempo, una nebulosa planetaria. El ncleo y sus regiones ms prximas se comprimirn ms hasta formar un estado de la materia muy concentrado en el que las repulsiones de tipo cuntico entre los electrones extremadamente cercanos (degenerados) frenarn el colapso. Quedar entonces, como remanente estelar, una enana blanca de carbono y oxgeno que se ir enfriando paulatinamente.

I like to build things, and to do things for others who cannot to relieve stress....    sometimes when I am totally stressed out I turn to comfort foods ( pasta starchy foods - they release a substance in your body called amylase I think, and that helps in stress.)    too, when I press my ring finger into my palm of the same hand,while keeping the others strait helps too ( I don't know why)

Bueno ten en cuenta que estos son personas y nadie est excento al error.

Yo tambin soy catlica y creo en todo lo que vos cres.  De la Iglesia te puedo decir un par de cosas:  Primero y principal: que la Iglesia sos vos mismo!!!! Iglesia sos vos, soy yo, y somos tantos de los que compartimos preguntas y respuestas en este foro. Y justamente, porque la Iglesia es como es, es que Dios nos cre a nosotros para que trabajemos por una iglesia mejor. Estudio en un seminario catequstico. El lema de ese seminario es: "otra Iglesia es posible". Y me encant ese lema. Porque siempre va a ser posible mejorar a la Iglesia si entre todos aportamos nuestro granito de arena.  Por otro lado, la Iglesia tuvo sus altibajos a lo largo de toda la historia, y justamente en los peores momentos de la iglesia, en donde se encontr ms perdida, fue cuando surgieron los Santos ms renombrados. San Francisco de Ass surgi para decirle a la Iglesia: "si Jess fue pobre, qu hacs entre lujos y apariencias??" y as como l, tantos Santos y Padres de la iglesia que, "desde adentro", la pelearon intentando mejorarla.  Hoy, a?o 2006 nos toca a nosotros ser los Santos que intenten mejorarla; pero as como ellos, la iremos mejorando desde adentro, con crticas que construyan y sobre todo, con el ejemplo del testimonio vivo del cristiano que con su vida, da muestra del Amor de Cristo. Hoy, lo dijo Juan Pablo II, el hombre contemporneo necesita ms testigos y menos maestros.  Animmonos a vivir el amor de Cristo, a irradiarlo. Puede ser que la misma Iglesia se contagie, ya que, como todo, es un grupo de personas, con todo lo bueno y todo lo malo que tenemos.  La Iglesia es santa a pesar de nosotros. Apostemos por que cada da sea mejor.  Saludos|`|211dd64874d5e8d6bfe31eb469be604eaa	Las pruebas revelan k la iglesia catolica desde k se fundo no ha dejado de ser una mafia.  Ten en cuenta la historia de las matanzas de conversion hicieron para obligar a las nuevas colonias a bautizarse catolicos segun ellos para k tengan salvacion. Solo fue para convertirlos en esclavos espirituales con el fin de aprovecharse de ellos economica y socialmente. A cuantos k discrepaban con lo que creia la iglesia los kemaban como si fueran trapos sucios y viejos. La "santa" inquisision y el oscurantismo la desenmascara. por otro lado, adivinen kienes son los principales accionistas de frabricas de armas.....jua. Tambien esta el hecho de k sacerdotes hayan bendecido a los ejercitos combatientes de las pasadas dos guerras mundiales para k se maten entre catolicos.

Outro detalhe  que o diabo  pai da mentira(Jo?o 4:44); N?o podemos tambm nos esquecer que Jesus tomou a forma humana em todos os sentidos:   " De sorte que haja em vs o mesmo sentimento que houve tambm em Cristo Jesus, Que, sendo em forma de Deus, n?o teve por usurpa??o ser igual a Deus, Mas esvaziou-se a si mesmo, tomando a forma de servo, fazendo-se semelhante aos homens; E, achado na forma de homem, humilhou-se a si mesmo, sendo obediente at  morte, e morte de cruz.   Por isso, tambm Deus o exaltou soberanamente, e lhe deu um nome que  sobre todo o nome; Para que ao nome de Jesus se dobre todo o joelho dos que est?o nos cus, e na terra, e debaixo da terra, E toda a lngua confesse que Jesus Cristo  o SENHOR, para glria de Deus Pai.

Por que o Deus bblico permitiu que o Rei Herodes sacrificasse tantas criancinhas para que Jesus pudesse sobreviver? Muitas passagens bblicas citam que Deus se arrependeu do fez e amaldi?oou ou castigou seu povo. Como pode Deus se arrepender? Se arrependeu foi porque fez alguma coisa errada ou se enganou e falhou no ato da cria??o. No meu entender o Deus verdadeiro n?o se engana, n?o toma partido,  eternamente justo e de forma alguma castiga com o fogo eterno do inferno seus amados filhos.

Veja tambm Jo 1:1,14; 8:24; 10:30-33.   1 Jo 4:2-3: "Nisto reconhecereis o Esprito de Deus: todo esprito que confessa que Jesus Cristo veio em carne  de Deus; e todo esprito que n?o confessa a Jesus n?o procede de Deus; pelo contrrio, este  o esprito do anticristo, a respeito do qual tendes ouvido que vem e, presentemente, j est no mundo."   Os versos acima precisam ser cruzados com Jo 1:1,14 (tambm escrito por Jo?o) onde ele afirma que o Verbo era Deus e que o Verbo se tornou carne.   1 Jo 4:2-3 est dizendo que se voc nega que que Jesus  Deus em carne ent?o voc  do esprito do anticristo.   Jo 8:24: "Por isso, eu vos disse que morrereis nos vossos pecados; porque se n?o crerdes que EU SOU, morrereis nos vossos pecados."   Jesus diz aqui que se voc n?o crer que "EU SOU" voc morrer nos seus pecados. Em grego, "eu sou"  'ego eimi', que significa 'eu sou.' Estas s?o as mesmas palavras usadas em Jo 8:58 onde Jesus diz "... antes que Abra?o existisse, eu sou." Ele estava atribuindo a si o ttulo divino usado em xodo 3:14 na Septuaginta Grega. (A Septuaginta  o Antigo Testamente hebraico traduzido para o grego.)   Jesus  o prprio objeto da f.   N?o  suficiente apenas ter f. A f  vlida somente se colocada em alguma coisa. Voc deve colocar a sua f no objeto apropriado. As seitas tm falsos objetos de f; portanto, sua f  intil -- n?o interessa quanto sejam sinceros.   Se voc colocar a sua f em um tubo de vcuo, ent?o voc ter um bocado de dificuldades no dia do juzo. Voc pode ter uma grande f, mas s isso n?o pode salvar voc. Ela deve ser colocada na pessoa certa, Jesus.   A doutrina da Divindade de Cristo inclui:   A Trindade - Existe um Deus que existe em trs pessoas: o Pai, o Filho e o Esprito Santo. Eles s?o co-iguais, co-eternos e da mesma natureza.   Monoteismo - Existe um nico Deus e nunca existiu outro (Isaas 43:10; 44:6,8; 45:5). Os Mrmons acreditam que existem muitos deuses que servem e adoram somente um. Portanto, eles s?o politestas, o que os exclui do campo do Cristianismo.   Uni?o Hiposttica - Jesus  tanto Deus como homem.   A suficincia do sacrifcio de Cristo - o sacrifcio de Cristo  completamente suficiente para pagar pelos pecados do mundo.   Como Deus - Jesus deve ser Deus para poder oferecer um sacrifcio de valor superior ao de um simples homem.  Ele teve de morrer pelos pecados do mundo (1 Jo?o 2:2). Somente Deus poderia fazer isso.   Como homem - Jesus deveria ser homem para poder ser um sacrifcio pelo homem.  Como homem Ele pode ser o mediador entre Deus e os homem (1 Tim. 2:5).   Salva??o pela gra?a   "Pois vocs s?o salvos pela gra?a, por meio da f; e isto n?o vem de vocs,  dom de Deus; n?o por obras, para que ningum se glorie" (Ef 2:8-9, NVI).   "De Cristo vos desligastes, vs que procurais justificar-vos na lei; da gra?a decastes" (Gl 5:4).   Este versculo e seu contexto ensinam claramente que se voc cr que ser salvo pela f e pelas suas obras, ent?o voc n?o ser salvo. Isto  um erro comum nas seitas. Porque eles tm um falso Jesus, eles tm uma falsa doutrina da salva??o. (Leia Rm 3-5 e Gl 3-5).   Voc n?o pode acrescentar nada ao trabalho de Deus. Glatas 2:21 diz: "N?o anulo a gra?a de Deus; pois, se a justi?a vem pela lei, Cristo morreu em v?o!" (NVI).   "Portanto, ningum ser declarado justo diante dele baseando-se na obedincia  lei, pois  mediante a lei que nos tornamos plenamente conscientes do pecado" (Rm 3:20, NIV).   "Todavia, ao homem que n?o trabalha, mas confia em Deus que justifica o mpio, sua f lhe  creditada como justi?a" (Rm 4:5, NIV).   "Ent?o, a lei op?e-se s promessas de Deus? De modo nenhum! Pois, se tivesse sido dada uma lei que pudesse conceder vida, certamente, certamente a justi?a viria da lei" (Gl 3:21, NIV).   A Ressurrei??o de Cristo   "E, se Cristo n?o ressuscitou,  v? a nossa prega??o, e v?, a nossa f" (1 Co 15:14). "E, se Cristo n?o ressuscitou,  v? a vossa f, e ainda permaneceis nos vossos pecados" (1 Co 5:17).   Ignorar a ressurrei??o fsica de Jesus  anular a Sua obra, Seu sacrifcio e a nossa ressurrei??o.   Estes versculos afirmam claramente que se voc diz que Cristo n?o ressuscitou da morte (no mesmo corpo em que Ele morreu -- Jo 2:19-21), ent?o a sua f  intil.         (Um comentrio em Gl 1:8-9: "Mas ainda que ns ou um anjo do cu pregue um evangelho diferente daquele que lhes pregamos, que seja amaldi?oado! Como j dissemos, agora repito: Se algum lhes anuncia um evangelho diferente daquele que j receberam, que seja amaldi?oado" (NIV).       Estes dois versos de Glatas poderiam ser considerados a quarta doutrina essencial. Mas, Gal. 1:8,9 est simplesmente estabelecendo a necessidade de crer na mensagem do Evangelho que, na sua integridade, diz que Jesus  Deus em carne, que Ele morreu pelos nossos pecados, ressuscitou da morte e d graciosamente a vida eterna queles que crem.         1 Co 15:1-4 define o que  o evangelho: "Irm?os, quero lembrar-lhes o evangelho que lhes preguei, o qual vocs receberam e no qual est?o firmes. Por meio deste evangelho vocs s?o salvos, se se apegarem firmemente  palavra que lhes preguei; caso contrrio, vocs tm crido em v?o. Pois o que primeiramente recebi, tambm lhes transmiti: que Cristo morreu pelos nossos pecados, segundo as Escrituras, foi sepultado e ressuscitou ao terceiro dia, segundo as Escrituras." (NIV).  Nestes versculos est a essncia do evangelho: Cristo  Deus em carne (Jo 1:1,14; Cl 2:9); Salva??o  recebida pela f (Jo 1:12; Rm 10:9-10), mediante a gra?a; e a ressurrei??o  mencionada no versculo 4. Por conseguinte, esta mensagem evanglica inclui as doutrinas essenciais.)

Por outro lado, a experincia de dj vu pode ser devida a ter visto imagens ou ouvido relatos vivos muitos anos antes, como no caso de Virginia Tighe.  Essas experincias podem ser parte de uma fraca recorda??o de infancia, erradamente acreditada como tendo ocorrido numa vida passada s porque "sabe" que n?o ocorreu nesta vida.     Finalmente,  possivel que a sensa??o que tem seja disparada por ac??o neuroquimica no crebro que n?o est ligada a nenhuma experincia do passado. Sente-se estranho e associa a sensa??o com j ter experimentado isso antes, mesmo se a experincia  completamente nova. Ou seja, dj vu (j visto em francs) pode n?o envolver um falso reconhecimento de algo que que j se viu antes.     O termo foi aplicado pela primeira vez por Emile Boirac (1851-1917), um homem com forte interesse em fenmenos psiquicos. O termo de Boirac dirige a nossa aten??o para o passado. Contudo, uma pequena reflex?o revela que o que  unico no dj vu n?o  algo no passado mas algo no presente, nomeadamente, a estranha sensa??o que temos quando experimentamos o dj vu. Temos muitas vezes experincias em que a novidade n?o  clara que nos levam a levantar quest?es como, J li este livro? Isto  um episdio que j vi o ms passado? Este lugar -me familiar, ser que j c estive? Mas isto n?o  acompanhado de sensa??es estranhas. Podemos sentir-nos confundidos, mas a sensa??o associada a dj vu n?o  de confus?o mas de estranheza. N?o h nada de estranho acerca de n?o nos lembrarmos se j leu um livro antes se tem cinquenta anos e j leu milhares de livros. Quando isso acontece n?o se sente estranho. Mas com o dj vu sentimo-nos estranhos porque n?o pensamos que devamos sentir-nos familiares a essa percep??o.      Portanto,  possivel que a tentativa de explicar o dj vu em termos de memria perdida, inaten??o, vidas passadas, clarividncia, etc, possa ser completamente errada. Deviamos falar da sensa??o de dj vu. Essa sensa??o pode ser causada por um estado do crebro, por factores neuroquimicos durante a percep??o. A sensa??o de dj vu  comum entre pacientes psiquitricos. Tambem precede ataques de epilepsia do lbulo temporal. E, em 1955, quando Wilder Penfield fez a sua famosa experincia na qual estimulava electricamente lbulos temporais, encontrou um bom numero de experincias de dj vu.|`|6bbe8de2248b5e252dd6794519b18e81aa	Dj vu  uma express?o da lngua francesa significando literalmente "j visto", no sentido figurado de que a nada de novo apareceu ou surgiu com a a??o ou objeto da express?o.     uma express?o tambm muito utilizada pela crtica artstica, seja ela literria, cinematogrfica, teatral ou musical, no sentido de que o objeto da crtica n?o trouxe nada de novo, nenhuma originalidade ao mundo artstico.  Sabe-se que nossa memria s vezes pode falhar; nem sempre consegue-se distinguir o que  novo do que j era conhecido. Eu j li este livro? J assisti a este filme? J estive neste lugar antes? Eu conhe?o esse sujeito? - essas s?o perguntas corriqueiras de nossa vida. No entanto, essas dvidas n?o s?o acompanhadas daquele sentimento de estranheza que  indispensvel ao verdadeiro dj vu. Eu posso at me sentir um pouco confuso, ou indeciso, ou triste por sentir que minha memria j n?o tem a limpidez de outros tempos, mas isso  natural; o sentimento associado ao dj vu clssico n?o  o de confus?o ou de dvida, mas sim o de estranheza. N?o h nada de estranho em n?o lembrar de um livro que se leu ou de um filme a que se assistiu; estranho (e aqui entra-se no dj vu)  sentir que a cena que parece familiar n?o deveria s-lo. Tem-se a sensa??o esquisita de estar revivendo alguma experincia passada, sabendo que  materialmente impossvel que ela tenha algum dia ocorrido.    No entanto, sabe-se que o uso pode mudar o significado das palavras, seja para ampli-lo, seja para restringi-lo. Embora se possa lamentar algumas dessas mudan?as (nos casos em que se gostasse mais do significado primitivo, originrio),  preciso ver, nesse processo de muta??o semantica, um fator extremamente benfico e enriquecedor do idioma. Colocando em termos bem concretos: os dicionrios engrossam n?o apenas pelos novos vocbulos que entram no lxico, mas tambm (e principalmente) pelos novos significados que s?o acrescidos aos verbetes j existentes. Quando a express?o dj vu saiu das publica??es especializadas em Neurologia e Psicologia para entrar na imprensa comum, o pblico, atrado por sua tradu??o literal ("j visto"), passou a us-la para designar aquelas situa??es em que a pessoa tem a sensa??o de estar vivenciando algo que lhe parece familiar. Pode parecer ironia, mas a express?o que a linguagem tcnica associa  estranheza passou, na linguagem usual, a indicar familiaridade.  nesse sentido que escreveu um conhecido comentarista poltico: "Assistir  instala??o na nova CPI trouxe-me uma triste sensa??o de dj vu" -, um lamento que equivale  forma popular "eu j vi esse filme".    Parece que o deslizamento semantico da express?o ainda n?o estabilizou: j h quem use a express?o para designar simplesmente uma situa??o que est acontecendo pela segunda vez: "Eu n?o fiquei embara?ado com a cena, porque para mim ela j era um dj vu". No filme Matrix, Keanu Reeves v, com um intervalo mnimo, um gato passar duas vezes por uma porta, e descreve o fato como um "dj vu" - aqui num emprego ainda mais distante do primitivo, pois designa o fato de ele realmente ter visto uma coisa acontecer duas vezes. Com essa atual indefini??o de significados, recomenda-se cercar de todas as cautelas possveis o uso desta express?o, pois nada assegura que os leitores v?o entend-la da mesma forma que quem a escreveu.    Os especialistas em bobagens reagem contra a limita??o do "vu", que restringiria ao mundo do que pode ser "visto", e j soltaram por a formas paralelas que fariam referncia mais especfica aos vrios tipos de situa??o: "dj vcu" ("j vivido"), "dj lu" ("j lido"), "dj entendu" ("j ouvido"), "dj visit" ("j visitado") - o que pode um dia acarretar um "dj mang" ("j comido") ou um "dj bu" ("j bebido").|`|07998e6fd7c35a024a11df7481819ae5aa	olha... de ja vu  uma sensa??o de que voc j viu aquela cena antes.

Jesus was born in the line of David.(Matthew 1:1) In telling Mary that she would have a son called Jesus, the angel declared that God will give him the throne of David his father. (Luke 1:32) Jesus Christ, son of David, was both the legal and the natural heir to the throne of David. (Matthew 1:1,?17; Lukr 3:23-31) Paul said that Jesus was the offspring of David according to the flesh. (Romans 1:3; 2Timothy 2:8) The common people also identified Jesus as the Son of David. (Matthew 9:27; 12:23; 15:22; 21:9,?15; Mark 10:47,?48; Luke 18:38,?39) It was important to establish this, for, as the Pharisees admitted, Messiah would be Davids son. (Matthew 22:42) The resurrected Jesus himself also bore witness, saying: I, Jesus, .?.?. am the root and the offspring of David.Revelation 22:16; also Revelation 3:7; 5:5.  2. David had strong faith - enough to defeat a giant, with just a slingshot and a few stones.(1Samuel 17: 45 - 54)  3. He was a man agreeable to God's heart (1Samuel 16:1-3), contrary to King Saul.(1Samuel 13:14)  4. He composed most of the verses of praise in the book of Psalms.  5. Expanded worship of Jehovah at the Arks new location by assigning gatekeepers and musicians and seeing that there were burnt offerings .?.?. constantly morning and evening. (1Chronicles 16:1-6, 37-43)   6. Jehovah made a covenant with him promising that the kingship would everlastingly remain in his family, and in connection with this covenant God assured him that his son Solomon, whose name is from a root meaning peace, would build the temple.2Samuel 7:1-16, 25-29; 1Chronicles 17:1-27; 2Chronicles 6:7-9; Psalms 89:3, 4, 35,?36.  7. God permitted David to expand his territorial rule from the river of Egypt to the Euphrates, securing his borders, maintaining peace with the king of Tyre, battling and conquering opponents on all sidesPhilistines, Syrians, Moabites, Edomites, Amalekites, and Ammonites. (2Samuel 8:1-14; 10:6-19; 1Kings 5:3; 1Chronicles 13:5; 14:1,?2; 18:120:8) These God-given victories made David a most powerful ruler. (1Chronicles 14:17)   8. David was always conscious that this position was not his by conquest or inheritance but that it was from Jehovah, who had placed him on the throne of this typical theocracy.1Chronicles 29:10-13.  9. The prophets often referred to David and his royal house, sometimes in connection with the last kings of Israel who sat on the throne of David (Jerimiah 13:13; 22:2,?30; 29:16; 36:30) and sometimes in a prophetic sense. (Jerimiah 17:25; 22:4; Amos 9:11; Zechariah 12:7-12) In certain Messianic prophecies attention is focused on Jehovahs kingdom covenant with David. For example, Isaiah says that the one called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace will be firmly established on the throne of David to time indefinite. (Isaiah 9:6,?7; compare also 16:5.) Jeremiah likens Messiah to a righteous sprout whom Jehovah will raise up to David. (Jerimiah 23:5,?6; 33:15-17) Through Ezekiel, Jehovah speaks of the Messianic Shepherd as my servant David.Ezekiel 34:23,?24; 37:24,?25.|`|AA11610394	He was a man after Gods own heart...Yes he was important...Jesus was in his bloodline..|`|AA12059450	He was in the ADOPTIVE/LEGAL family line of Jesus.|`|AA10333475	Jesus was of his "house and lineage."

Also, he is a great example that we don't have to be perfect to find favor with God. David shows us the baseness of man. Also, his brokeness of spirit when he realizes his unworthiness. He is a great example for us in that regard.

And after Armageddon passes that God will restore the earth to its original paradise form. The ones that make it through Armageddon will enter the paradise earth. Then that he will resurrect the dead and those who choose to be his followers and listen will inhabit the the earth and live forever as well.|`|eb743179f7c633d4475a3b0ba80f4963aa	Man is not destined to be without a body, Adam and Eve were originally created perfect, never to die and live forever in the Garden.  All who die will once again have a body at the Resurrection.      This is why there is a debate what happens to us while between bodies, some say you are a spirit in heaven or hell fully conscious until you receive a new body, or you are a resting spirit until the resurrection, dwelling in paradise (R.I.P. - Rest in Peace), or you may be in some subconscious state like a coma or dream until you arise in your new body either to be condemned or saved.    1 Corintihians 15  20But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. 21For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man. 22For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive. ...42So will it be with the resurrection of the dead. The body that is sown is perishable, it is raised imperishable; 43it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power; 44it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body. 45So it is written: "The first man Adam became a living being]; the last Adam, a life-giving spirit. 46The spiritual did not come first, but the natural, and after that the spiritual. 47The first man was of the dust of the earth, the second man from heaven. 48As was the earthly man, so are those who are of the earth; and as is the man from heaven, so also are those who are of heaven. 49And just as we have borne the likeness of the earthly man, so shall we bear the likeness of the man from heaven|`|9fc53e35171aca92510becfcec18c7b1aa	no, you are thinking too linear - God is not just an almighty entity.

In the third chapter it talks about the serpent decieving Adam and Eve and after they had par-taken of the forbidden fruit they realized they were naked.  This, I believe, was when the glory of God fell off of them.  They were spirit beings, clothed in God's own glory, but when they sinned their bodies were no longer in this perpetually glorified state.  I'm no theologian, though.  One day we will, once again be restored to the perfect glorious state.|`|b8d649b01a761f36658840e72942e0daaa	When God created us, he didn't know that sin was going to enter the world, he didn't know that Adam and Eve were going to sin. But when they sinned, he then realized that we were not perfect in our human bodies, so then he decided to send his son, so we can become perfect. I guess what I'm trying to say here, is that God didn't know Adam and Eve were going to sin when he created them in their human bodies.|`|ca75cfc98650f91a8f742dd9775462a5aa	God did not create the human body, we did, every time you chose to come back here you need a body.

(Genesis 1:28) Because they became disobedient, this couple failed to fill the earth with righteous families who would lovingly care for the earth and its plants and animals. But their failure does not make Jehovah's purpose fail. Thousands of years later, it was written: "God, the Former of the earth . . . , did not create it simply for nothing." He "formed it even to be inhabited." It is not to be destroyed, but "the earth endures for ever." (Isaiah 45:18; Ecclesiastes 1:4, The New English Bible) Jehovah's purpose for the earth will be realized: "My own counsel will stand, and everything that is my delight I shall do."-Isaiah 46:10.    We are purposed to stay on earth, not to be come spirit creatures.|`|a75022df96606c1956a8041320d24fadaa	Life is a test.  God did not force us to love Him; that's the equivalent of making robots. THAT is not genuine love.     So, the reason why God put us here, on earth, is because He wants to test us of our FAITH and our trust TRUST Him.  Love is when we believe what cannot be seen. That's true love.

Do the warfare, terrorism, and corruption perpetrated by those who claim to serve God offend your sense of Justice?  Why does religion seem to be a t the root of so many problems?    The fault lies, not with all religion, but with false religion.  A widely respected religious figure, Jesus Christ, indicated that false religion produces bad works, just as a rotten tree produces worthless fruit.    Matthew 7:15-17.  Wouldnt false religion?      meddles in war and politics:  Across Asia and beyond,  says the Journal Asia week, power hungry leaders are cynically manipulating peoples religious sentiments for their own needs.  As a result, the journal warns:  The world threatens to sink into madness,  A prominent religious leader in the USA declared: Youve got to kill the terrorists before the killing stops.  His solution?  Blow them all away in the name of the Lord.  By contrast, the Bible says, If anyone makes the statement; I love God, and yet is hating his brother, he is a liar [1 john 4:20]  Jesus even said:  continue to love your enemies.

f0ab5773489610816891e78f27e89a12aa	Jelly "Sex" Bracelets Banned At North Layton Jr. High  Dec. 12, 2003    "IT'S AMAZING HOW SOMETHING SO SIMPLE CAN TURN INTO  SOMETHING HORRIBLE LIKE THAT."  Jelly bracelets are making a comeback. But this time around, instead of making a fashion statement, they could be making a  statement about your teen's sex life. One Utah school has banned them.  Schools all over the nation are banning the jelly bracelets that young people are now calling sex bracelets. The different colored bracelets are said to represent different sexual favors. News Specialist Kimberly Houk joins us live to explain.  These are the controversial bracelets that have been banned at North Layton Junior High School. Each color represents a certain sexual favor. In a game called snap, if a boy breaks the bracelet off a girl's wrist, he gets a sexual coupon for that act.  Mary Watson/Student, North Layton Junior High School: "THE GIRLS WILL PUT THEM ON THEIR WRIST, AND IF THE BOYS CAN BREAK IT LIKE THIS, THAN YOU HAVE TO KISS THE BOY."  "THEY WERE STARTING TO GO FROM THEIR THUMBS TO THEIR ELBOWS, WITH SO MANY BRACELETS AND SO MANY COLORS. "  Jelly bracelets are the biggest fad right now in schools across the nation. But they're a fad with a hidden meaning. A meaning recently made clear to teachers at North Layton Junior High.  Katherine Ashton/Vice Principal, North Layton Junior High School: "IT CAN SYMBOLIZE SOME SORT OF SEXUAL INVOLVEMENT, AND SO WHEN WE LEARNED THAT WE DECIDED TO BAN THEM FROM OUR SCHOOL."  "I'VE SEEN THEM RIP THEM OFF EACH OTHER, AND THEY'VE HAD TO KISS."  But some students may be doing more than kissing. And it all comes down to which color of bracelet gets ripped off the wrist.  For example, yellow means hugging, purple bracelets are for kissing. Red means lap dance. And black?  BLACK'S ALL THE WAY."  "IT'S A 5 CENT BRACELET THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO, AND IT'S A SHAME THAT IT TURNS INTO SOMETHING WITH SUCH A HORRIBLE MEANING."  David Turner/Vice Principal, North Layton Junior High School: "WE ARE TAKING THE BRACELETS PUTTING THEM IN AN ENVELOPE AND CALLING THE KID'S PARENTS TO COME GET THEM. JUST IN THE HALL TODAY, WE SAW A GIRL WITH THEM AND WE ASKED HER TO TAKE THEM OFF, AND SHE DID."  "THEY DON'T MAKE A BIG SCENE OUT OF IT. THEY'LL USUALLY PULL THE STUDENT OUT OF CLASS AND SAY I NEED TO TAKE THOSE BRACELETS CAUSE THEY HAVE A BAD MEANING TO THEM. "  Some of the students I talked to earlier say they like to wear the bracelets because it's the style right now. Everybody's wearing them. But they don't all play the snap game.|`|0f94a0446ef41fc35c6a1ad63c613630aa	I thought Jelly bracelets meant that you shop at Claire's....

Ele estudou pra isso, portanto, ele se capacitou pra isso. Com os padres acontece algo semelhante. Eles passam 07 anos em um seminrio, aprendendo filosofia, teologia, fazendo cursos, aprendendo sobre liturgia, recebendo orienta??es para conquistarem o direito e a gra?a de se tornarem sacerdotes. Uma caminhada longa, difcil. Eu, que conhe?o alguns padres sei o quanto  complicado chegar ao sacerdcio. Confiss?o  um sacramento, assim como a eucaristia, a un??o dos enfermos, o batismo, entre outros. O sacerdote  o representante de Deus, que no decorrer da histria sempre enviou pessoas para absorver nossos pecados. No, salvou a famlia dele, Moiss, libertou o povo do Egito (aqueles que queriam ser libertados), Jesus, entregou a vida por cada um de ns. Nos tempos atuais, podemos sim pedir perd?o a Deus. Se somos catlicos, observamos os mandamentos de Deus e da Igreja. E a igreja orienta seus filhos a confessarem pelo menos uma vez ao ano (pelo menos na pscoa). O padre, naquele momento,  figura divina (ningum  perfeito - todos somos pecadores), mas o padre estudou pra isso, ele recebeu a bn??o pra isso. Ele  a figura de Deus no momento da confiss?o. O padre d a bn??o, absorvendo nossos pecados, que  a prpria bn??o de Deus. Muitos n?o concordam, mas  importante confessarmos nossos pecados com o padre. Somos parte da igreja, somos seguidores de Cristo, precisamos aprender que, a tradi??o e o magistrio da igreja (no qual a confiss?o com o padre est includa), deve ser seguido por ns, que formamos a igreja!! Um abra?o!!|`|259cf839be9e6e36b09a8d6aafd484f7aa	Quem negava a Jesus o poder de perdoar os pecados, e at taxava de blasfemador, eram os orgulhosos escribas. Jesus , porm, lhes respondeu (Mc 2,10) : Para que saibais que o Filho do homem tem na terra o poder de perdoar os pecados...Jesus curou o paraltico perdoado  vista deles.    Este poder de perdoar os pecados, Jesus o confiou aos homens pecadores, aos Apstolos e seus legtimos sucessores, no dia mais solene, na Ressurrei??o quando lhes apareceu e disse (Jo 20,21-23): Assim como o pai me enviou, tambm eu vos envio a vs. Tendo dito estas palavras, soprou sobre eles e disse-lhes: Recebei o Esprito Santo. quele a quem perdoardes os pecados, ser-lhes-?o perdoados, e queles a quem os retiverdes, ser-lhes-?o retidos.    N?o resta dvida que o sopro de Cristo ressuscitado e as palavras: Recebei o (dom do) Esprito Santo...expressam claramente que os Apstolos n?o obtiveram o poder de perdoar os pecados em virtude de sua santidade ou impecabilidade, mas como um dom especial, merecido por Cristo e a ele conferido em favor das almas, remidas pelo sangue derramado na cruz.    Da dizer: Eu n?o me confesso com os padres, porque eles tambm s?o pecadores, demonstra igual insensatez, como afirmar: Eu n?o vou, com minha doen?a, procurar conselho e remdio dos mdicos, porque eles tambm ficam doentes.    Por isso os catlicos, mesmo que sejam, cardeais e reis, dobram humildemente suas cabe?as diante de t?o claras palavras de Jesus e confessam seus pecados diante dum simples sacerdote, para receber o perd?o de Deus.    Os outros crentes, porm, preferem ignorar estas palavras de Jesus, e desprezar o grande dom de Jesus, no sacramento da Penitncia. Para motivar este procedimento, procuram na Bblia vrios textos no sentido: Convertei-vos... fazei penitncia... arrependei-vos, para que vossos pecados sejam perdoados,... para que sejais salvos.    Ningum duvida de que o sincero arrependimento dos pecados, com firme propsito de n?o pecar mais, e satisfa??o feita a Deus e aos prejudicados, eram no Antigo Testamento condi??es necessrias e suficientes para obter perd?o de Deus. O mesmo vale ainda hoje para todos os que desconhecem Jesus e seu Evangelho ; para os que n?o tem nenhuma ocasi?o de se confessar ; e s?o ainda condi??es necessrias para obter perd?o na boa Confiss?o. Mas quem no seu orgulho n?o acredita na veracidade e obrigatoriedade das palavras de Cristo Ressuscitado, com as quais instituiu o sacramento da Penitncia, e por isso n?o quer se confessar, dificilmente receber perd?o !    Cada pecado  um ato de orgulho e desobedincia contra Deus. Por isso Cristo se humilhou e tornou-se obediente at a morte na cruz (Flp 2,8) para expiar o orgulho e a desobedincia dos nossos pecados, e nos merecer perd?o. Por isso ele exige de ns Confiss?o sacramental, na qual confessamos os nossos pecados diante do seu representante, legitimamente ordenado. E, conforme a sua promessa: Quem se humilha, ser exaltado, e quem se exalta, ser humilhado (Lc 18,14).|`|5bd4aaca1c13c56b85157f384ebf8230aa	ningm  perfeito e n?o podemos comparar nossos pecados com os dos outros pq os nossos podem ser muito piores.........|`|19ffb9d791f0b8facbc77f8a76bfd959aa	O nico que  digno de ouvir a minha confiss?o  Deus atravs de Jesus, mais ningum!!!!|`|23fd29bf3f9a01fd41632610e71b8329aa	Quem optou pela religi?o catlica, tem o hbito de seguir certas coisas, como por exemplo a confiss?o.  Pela igreja, a confiss?o se faz muito importante para a salva??o da alma e acalmar o cora??o....e para termos conscincias dos nossos erros.  O padre estudou e se formou para ser o representante de Cristo aqui conosco, ent?o para os catlicos, o padre merece nosso respeito.

A religi?o catolica  cheia dessas coisas. Na verdade, ns temos que nos arrepender dos nossos pecados, confessar eles a Deus e pedir o seu perd?o, cuidando para n?o pecar novamente no mesmo ato. Tudo que pedir ao Pai deve ser em nome de Jesus, com certeza Ele te perdoar, pois,  misericordioso.

Entendo que confessar deve ser um ato de arrependimento por algo n?o t?o correto como deveria ser. Deus odeia o pecado, mas ama o pecador e nos d a chance do arrependimento. Expressar a um padre  muito relativo, pois alguns acreditam que ele representa a divindade, apesar de suas diversas falhas como homem. Algo que aprendi e acredito piamente  que quando erro perante outra pessoa, se me arrepender, devo perdir perd?o diretamente a esta pessoa, s assim reparo minha falha. Pe?o, ainda, o perd?o a Deus pela minha omiss?o perante aos necessitados da minha participa??o ativa. Evite sempre reparar nos pecados alheios, pois todos temos e cometemos a todo instante.     Penso ser muito oportuna a passagem da crucifica??o de Jesus, onde o bandido ao seu lado pede a Jesus que se lembre dele quando estiver no paraso. O outro bandido afirma que se ele tem poder, que se retire de l. Porm, o primeiro bandido reconhece que est sofrendo pelos seus pecados cometidos, mas Jesus era inocente. Assim, Jesus retribui dizendo que ainda naquele dia eles se encontrar?o no reino. Ou seja, houve uma confiss?o!!! Pequei, e reconhe?o minha falha!!!|`|f5177269c3cc691504f9a96320471c4baa	A confiss?o  um ato instituido por Jesus em sua passagem na terra. (detalhe: Jesus n?o disse para nos confessarmos aos Padres, Sacerdotes ou alguem especfico, ele disse para confessarmos uns aos outros - ou seja aos irm?os em Cristo).    O erro est em pensar que isso nos tornar "santos" ou que com isso ns seremos perdoados por aquele a quem confessarmos (Deus  o nico que pode perdoar alguma coisa).    O ato de confessar expressa o nosso arrependimento e o compromisso de que este fato n?o se repetir pois dizendo a outros seremos mais vigiados e teremos mais chances de sermos melhor ajudados a n?o pecar/errar. O Aconselhamento do Padre ou do Pastor ou mesmo de um irm?o (em Cristo) de confian?a s ser efetivo se esta pessoa tiver uma real comunh?o com Deus.|`|b9e3baaea5af2344ce5db5604124a99daa	Oq torna um padre melhor do vc : Nada, a n?o ser q ele tenha uma f genuna, mas se vc tb tiver, ambos est?o em igual patamar.  se tem o meswmo efeito flar diretamente com o Senhor?

These people want to fit in with everyone else so they constantly monitor their behavior and change it in the hopes others will like them. They probably are just nervous to meet new people and want to fit in.

0f7f885eaa0f55f08ee60e284fa72fedaa	In my opinion, political correctness is not just another form of oppression, it's down right unconstitutional!  Freedom of Speech people!  I see a lot of things on here gets me steaming mad!  but when it's all said and done, they have the right to say it!    This is a lawsuit happy land.  Every time some one gets a bruised ego, it PC! PC!, **** that.  We're all adults here.  If you can be mature enough to hear what I have to say, how I have to say it, then I'll extend you the same courtesy.  Let's all grow up a little.  Best wishes.|`|2bf8dd7ac8ead0194f19aadf49225b35aa	Look I'm not so much PC as in "politically correct" because to me, mind you just to me, that means that I'm trying to say only what I think other people want to hear.  That I'm afraid of standing up for my beliefs if they're not popular.    I think with people you know you tend to hold on and listen a little longer and usually you find out that what they're about isn't really so bad or you had misunderstood them.    With others, it's easy to just get offended immediately and start reeling off the accusations.  This is small minded not to mention a clear manifestation of someone feeling threatened.    Folks, just because the entire world doesn't agree with you on everything does not make either you or the other person wrong or "bad".  It's just a difference of opinion.  If you respect others, you are first and foremost showing respect for yourself.|`|123ee302d1616984a14f8f299cd5cbbaaa	Honestly I think it's just another BS trendy term left over from the 90's that has somehow made its insidious way into our cultural frame of reference.    As long as you are not disrespecting someone, and as long as you can listen to other views as much as you spout off about your own then say what you want.  Hey, I'm a guy that gets accused right and left of being gay when I'm not.  Check out my web page if you don't believe me.  Yes, I'm not afraid or ashamed to say that I like Hello Kitty but does that make me gay? Hell no!    Do I have a problem with gay people?  See, to me that's still a word my Mom and Dad and Grandparents used to describe a happy, carefree mood or feeling.    I have all sort of friends of all genders, races, nationalities, religions and sexual orientation.  You name it, I'm probably friend with them.      And I can take all a person has to say on a subject even if I disagree so long as they do so in a respectful manner and show me the same courtesy when I want to share my own point of view.  Hey, that's what life is all about to me.  Sharing what's on my mind with others and hearing what 's on theirs.  Communication, Respect and Tolerance.  It's more than a concept to me, it's a way of life.    Cheers!|`|AA11317014	I think close friends can often get away with saying offensive things when no one else would. If it is someone that soes not know you at all it's probably really offensive.
7c5c73cfd2be655e972a1e8c7a719e7faa	Zusammenfassung in 5 Worten:  Lieben und geliebt zu werden!  :-)|`|6336b9c408931b5cd90c754980633db8aa	Der Sinn des Lebens ist zu versuchen, ihm einen positiven Inhalt zu verleihen und den Rest damit zu verbringen, eben diesen letzten Sinn des Lebens zu finden und ihn zu sch?tzen!  Was wir Menschen hier alles treiben, es fhrt dazu, dass Leben keinen Sinn mehr haben kann und wird, wenn wir so weitermachen.  Die Erde ist eine berladene Nu?schale und wir selbst vergiften den Ozean, auf welchem sie dahindmpelt!  Wir geben uns alle Mhe, auch die Nu?schale noch unbewohnbar zu machen und streben danach, wenn mal nichts mehr gehen sollte, einen kmmerlichen Trupp an berlebenden ins Weltall "reisen" zu lassen, wo dann an anderer Stelle wom?glich dasselbe Drama erneut seinen Anfang nehmen wird. So lange, bis unsere Sonne nicht mehr kann und will und wir alle - so noch berlebende da sein werden - heller als tausend Sonnen im Nichts verglhen werden!

Das ganze Leben w?re nur dazu da, Nachfahren zu produzieren und dann wieder von der Bildfl?che zu verschwinden. Mindestens doppelt so viele Leute meinen, die Liebe w?re der Sinn des Lebens.    Pers?nlich denke ich, der Sinn des Lebens liegt im Leben selbst. Wenn man alles mitnimmt, was das Leben zu bieten hat, gro?e Abenteuer, Freud und Leid, kleine Details des Alltagslebens, Kunst, Essen, Sport, Musik etc, dann hat man den Sinn des Lebens erfllt.    ps: die anhalter-antwort hei?t richtig brigens "42"!!|`|a88be1a5d84c2f126d3490ef6a40e033aa	Den Sinn des Lebens muss jeder fr sich selbst definieren.

You have to know that guys have a very short term memory. They may want to call but they forget. now some times this is okay you may want to give him a period of time before you get too mad. he aslo may be testing the waters. talking for a while to see if he likes you enough to keep talking. finding out how long he can go before you get upset & that will tell him how long he wants to know you. If you like him so far give him a little time. maybe talk once or twice a week at first. Also, just a side note, I think if he actually apologized then he does care but again they are VERY forgetful at first.|`|c4bc9f2ca13244e331c58538c5849521aa	sweetie, by asking us not to tell you to grow up means you are acknowledging the fact that you might be a bit immature but are not ready to accept it. i think that you shouldn't make a big stink out of it. if he doesn't wanna talk then you shouldn't have any reason to want to talk to him. if he said some things that made you fall for him over the phone, then good for you but a relationship is not and should not be based on phone calls. the number of calls you have and the duration of the conversation is not a gauge on how much he likes/loves you or how much of a brilliant guy he is. test him. see how he is when you are together. he shouold be consistent. it looks like you are really into him but nothing exclusive yet. don't rush, talk to other people and hang out wiht them too...good luck.|`|cdf5c7b5e0c338252ba1da0c820dba0caa	call him and tell him if it don't work out with the other girlfriend that you still likely will be interested.

Aqu en Colombia la gente (y en especial -no por discriminar- la gente de estratos 1 y 2) se deja llevar por otras que creen que el espritu de la navidad est perdido, que ahora slo es regalos, y que no hay que celebrarla as, y siempre se andan quejando.  Esto va para no slo esa gente, sino para todos los Colombianos y Latinos:  LOS REGALOS NO TIENEN LA CULPA DE SI SE HAYA PERDIDO LA NAVIDAD O NO.  La culpa la tienen las personas que se dejan llevar por eso.  EL ESPIRITU DE LA NAVIDAD NO EST EN LOS DEMS, NI EN PAP NOEL, NI EN LOS REGALOS: EST EN NOSOTROS MISMOS.  As que no nos dejemos llevar, y mas bien unamonos para celebrar EL NACIMIENTO DEL QUE NOS SALV A TODOS, Jesucristo, el hijo de Dios.|`|383be108af88a708289d477a68ae7ee1aa	pues la verdad cada a?o se va perdiendo un poko de la tradicion como antes los que traian regalos eran los reyes magos ahora es santa clous eso esta mal por que realmente de lo que se trata es de los regalos que los reyes magos llevaron a jesus cuando nacio y    no de solo pensar en "que voy a pedir este a?o?" se supono es algo humilde.  parte de el problema, yo creo que la mayor parte del problema, es de la publicidad por que apenas son finales o mediados de noviembre y salen todas las promociones con supuestos desuentos.  en mi pais si se esta perdiendo mucho la "magia" de la navidad a se me olvidaba vivo en MXICO0O...|`|f8c7dcd195c7748e1062333d8a2ca464aa	creo que sea comercializado, pero no necesariamente que ha perdido sentido|`|d8d27bd23f3b49f7ff0648ca1cfde1d9aa	la navidad ha pasado de ser algo tradicional ha algo capitalista q solo se describe como un frenesi consumista de fin de a?o|`|a52faacf8fef4d5c9c0c94a3c7f8401caa	Si|`|6201be3883ab73f73c8d73f8fb644bc6aa	Como veo la vivencia de la navidad en mi pais??? Un negocio y uno muy lucrativo, tu sabes ventas de arbolito, luces, adornos, chocolate y paneton, el famoso y pobre pavo.    Para mi la navida no existe, es solo un dia creado por alguien que se le dio la gana y pudo hacer la navidad. Es un dia mas.    Jesus nacio en Abril y no en Diciembre, cualquier persona que esta al tanto de la historia lo sabe.

I relied on it to get an appetite, enjoy watching tv, enjoy listening to music. Basically, I needed it to enjoy life. It also made me extremely unmotivated but maybe that's just me. If it's done in moderation I see no problem with it but I couldn't control myself...lol|`|9fa1adb1c8a5e488f13a34915c1381ceaa	Government propaganda.

It can cause laziness I dont have proof of this but I know people who have done the drug and have gotten lazier. It does kill brain cells all drugs kill brain cells but marijuana is the drug that doesn't kill as many as inhalents or heroin. Where did you get that , can I have your source about chocolate being more addictive then marijuana? Even if that were valid. Chocolate doesn't kill brain cells. It's be proven to actually help people. Chocolate doesn't cause slight laziness.     Marijuana should be legal? If marijuana were to be legal Alcohol should be illegal. It kills more brain cells than marijuana. a certain percent of deaths in world is caused by drunk driving.|`|13ce3bf1c3f8b7d54cdbc88b826663faaa	Because they want you to believe what they say.

Weed was put here on Earth by God, so therefore what's the sin in smoking it... It's all natural and way better than alcohol or cigarettes... But to answer your question, I have no idea why there are so many myths out there... I think it's because they just want to scare out of smoking the ****!!! And just one more thing, for a pot smoker you sure sound like an educated person... Which some of the smartest people in the world smoke weed... ALL THE POWER TO THE POT PEOPLE....

Historia y tradicin  La festividad de Jnuca evoca la poca de la hegemona helnica en Israel, iniciada con la conquista de Alejandro Magno, en el a?o 332 adC; y como tal, no se hace mencin a ella en las Escrituras. Cuando se corona como rey de Siria a Antoco IV Epfanes (175 y 164 adC), ste decide helenizar al pueblo de Israel, prohibindole as a los judos poder seguir sus tradiciones y costumbres. Un grupo de judos conocido como los macabeos, provenientes de la zona de Modi'n, comenzaron a revelarse contra los soldados griegos, ya que se negaban a hacer actos que iban en contra de su propia religin. Tuvieron una lucha difcil, y eran una minora luchando contra el ejrcito griego, sin embargo sus estrategias, su decisin y fe les llevaron a lo que es el milagro de Jnuca, ganar pocos contra muchos. Cuando terminan la guerra, los macabeos regresan a Jerusaln a las sinagogas y las encuentran destruidas, ellos encuentran la menor (un candelabro de siete brazos) apagado, y aceite para encenderlo un slo da. Tardaron ocho das en tener listo ms aceite y sin embargo ese poquito aceite que tenan mantuvo prendido la menor durante los ocho das hasta que tuvieron ms aceite.       Celebracin  La fiesta de Jnuca se celebra durante ocho das, del 25 de kislev al 2 de tevet (o el 3 de tevet, cuando kislev cuenta con slo 29 das). Durante esta festividad se prende una januqui o candelabro de ocho brazos (ms uno mayor). En la primera noche nicamente se prende el brazo mayor y una vela, y cada noche se va aumentando una vela, hasta el ltimo da en el que todo el candelabro se enciende completo. Este hecho conmemora el milagro de que el aceite dur ocho das.    Es costumbre que los ni?os jueguen con un sevivon o pirinola. Este pirinola de Jnuca tiene cuatro caras, cada una de ellas con una letra en hebreo:    ? ("Nun")   ? ("Gumel")   ? ("He")   ? ("Sin")   Las cuatro letras son las siglas de "Nes gadol halla sham" lo cual se traduce a Un gran milagro ocurri all.

Me parece que habls con mucha autoridad moral, no necesits ser perfecto para hacerlo.     Todos tenemos derecho a cuestionar, hay gente que lo hace de formas destructivas o intolerantes, ese no es tu caso.    Este es el tipo de debates que yo promuevo que se haga dentro de los grupos cristianos: menos teologa y ms vida prctica, o como decimos en mi pas "menos charla y ms trabajo".    En una carta de Pablo a una iglesia que estaba peleando mucho y argumentando por diferencias tontas, l dice: "Ahora ir a ellos y ver qu son capaces de HACER esos presumidos! Porque el reino de Dios no se trata de palabras, sino de poder". Tantos dogmas y aprendizajes, y en el da a da no hacan nada que reflejara tanta "sabidura".     Eclesiasts tambin dice que "las muchas letras cansan", que el fin de todo lo aprendido finalmente es disfrutar de la vida y hacer el bien, porque de eso es que Dios pedir cuentas (no de cuntos libros lemos ni cuntas discusiones "ganamos").    Apocalipsis profetiza que Dios "vomitar de su boca" a la iglesia tibia, esto no es una religin en s, sino el conjunto de creyentes que no son ni fros (incrdulos, por as decirlo) ni calientes (no viven de acuerdo al amor y la compasin). Son tibios porque tienen conocimientos y viven de una forma cmoda y ajustando las reglas a su conveniencia. Ese pasaje es fuerte, Dios tambin dice "te recomiendo que te pongas colirio en los ojos para que puedas ver bien". Jess en su poca llamaba "guas ciegos" a los maestros fariseos, que ahogaban al pueblo con sus leyes. El simbolismo de esa profeca acompa?a el lenguaje que usaba Jess varias dcadas antes.    Bueno! me entusiasm, pero realmente me gusta el tipo de material de debate que ests proponiendo, te felicito!|`|fadfd02117851064a88151d248baaccbaa	?Cmo se fabrica un martillo paso por paso?

Siempre que lea la biblia trataba de aplicarle una integral triple, derivadas de laplce o una formula algortmica y me di cuenta que por ah no era.    El hecho de que no uno a veces no entienda algo o trate de interpretar de forma literal y no a travs de los simbolismos de la biblia, nos hace perder el rumbo.    Son validos todos tus comentarios, para ti. Pero a saber: se requiere todo un magisterio con a?os y a?os para interpretar una biblia, y en lo personal solo busco leerla para ver "que me dice a mi" en ese momento.

f3b0eb3fe6f92240d8367c680a78ea40aa	Yo creo que a ciencia cierta no se puede definir con exactitud si existieron o no, Siempre ha habido una fascinacin por los dragones, A muchas culturas del mundo se les ha unido o han unidos partes nuevas al mito, y cada cultura se refiere a los dragones a su manera.    Hoy en dia la idea de que los dragones aun existen fascina a cualquiera que crea que es posible, pero tal como muchas criaturas pudiera existir y no haber sido descubierta, o tal vez extinguidos o tal vez nunca aparecieron, lo mas importante de un dragon y parte innegable es lo que representa, para cada cultura y para cada persona, asi como existen diferentes formas de verlo, hay diferentes formas de describirlo, algunas veces representara un animal, otras magia, otras la fuerza de la naturaleza, y hasta puede significar miedo y respeto.|`|3e83e9700ddc376d232ad736c812b8afaa	Hay unos lagarto grandes parecidos al cocodrilo llamados dragones pero lo que arrojaban fuego son definitivamente un mito.|`|f42b972f9c0125591981142fd8d267c2aa	Hay unos como cocodrilos raros, que no vuelan y no sacam fuego por la boca, pero s tienen un aliento espantoso, como si quemaran.

Las prostitutas, as como hoy ocultan sus negocios hacindolos pasar por casas de masajes, en aquella poca los disimulaban como si se tratara de tabernas, colgando en su puerta un ramo.    Por esa razn, las comadres empezaron a llamarlas rameras, una palabra que les sonaba ms pdica que prostituta. La palabra aparece registrada por primera vez en espa?ol a finales del siglo xv, como por ejemplo en La Celestina (1499) de Fernando de Rojas:     Esta mujer es marcada ramera, segn t me dijiste, cuanto con ella te pas has de creer que no carece de enga?o.

4a7735258795195142c32934b00c96beaa	Absolutely not. Archaeological discoveries show that Europeans have been in Europe (in various stages of evolution) for 1.8 million years.     Modern humans first appeared in Africa about 70,000 years ago and gradually spread out to colonise the world. Modern humans have been in Europe for at least 50,000 years.     You may be thinking of the Indo-European people. These folk originated in Eastern Europe (probably the Ukraine) and gradually spread out to mix with the existing populations they came across, west and east.    Some Indian stories tell of fair skinned invaders coming in from the north about 4,000 years ago. So in fact it is the other way around - people in India, Pakistan and Iran "evolve" as you put it, from ancient European arrivals.

9fa1adb1c8a5e488f13a34915c1381ceaa	Actually what bothers me even more is when I see people acting out their stereotype to perfection. Examples: A woman being completely stupid in a car, a black guy being loud and obnoxious and accusing everyone in sight of discriminating against him. I hate seeing people do things to perpetuate the stereotype.|`|031f82ea0f3e8ca118b8c64da4c2d9d5aa	The 'big blonde, dumb Swede' stereotype really bothers me.  I happen to be average height, slender and redheaded.  I'm also very intelligent, highly educated, extremely hardworking and creative.      Religious stereotyping bothers me, too.  I ask a lot of questions because I want to avoid stereotyping most of the time.  Sometimes I get a tad cranky and do it just because I can (or I'm being sarcastic/silly), but most the time, I ASK before I assume.  If it's an opinion, I give mine and then ask the other person's view.  I never assume anything about another person's faith, so it really bothers me when people assume things about mine when they most likely have never even heard of it before.      Unmarried women at my age want to be married - WRONG!  I like being single and plan to stay that way.  If I find someone I would enjoy spending my life with, then that's fine.  But a big wedding and a bunch of kids is not my idea of a good time.  I also don't feel it's my cultural or religious responsibility to try to repopulate any particular country/region with a bunch of pasty white, redheaded children.      People who dress all in black/paint their nails black, etc are depressed/goth/devil worshippers.  Wrong again.  I hate this one with a passion.  Black has been my favorite color since I was a tiny child.  It is elegant, goes with anything and is easy to grab in the morning when you're dashing out the door.  It also doesn't show stains very easily, though you may want to keep a lint roller handy if you happen to own furbabies (pets).    Speaking a language other than English in the store means I don't speak English at all.  Ohhhh!  This one annoys me!  I speak three languages, thanks.

d96e98e14d438f7eefcf735a75273305aa	Hola, primero ke todo quiero decirte que todos somo humanos y no perfectos, que podemos caer o fallar pero la mano de Dios siempre esta extendida para el de corazon arrepentido porquevivimos por su gracia.  La biblia nos dice que si nos keremos casar y si tenemos el don de abstinencia bien, nos podemso kedar asi esto lo puedes descubrir asi=  si miras un hombre guapo y  musculoso y para ti es como mirar un nopal entonces tienes el don de abstinencia pero si no es asi dice  la epistola de Pablo la cita aca(1cor7:8-9. Digo, pues, a los solteros y a las viudas, que bueno les fuera quedarse solteros como yo;pero si no tienen don de continencia, csense, pues mejor es casarse que estarse quemando.)  Si una chica no escasada y se mete con alguien  esta fornicando o adulterando  esta cita contesta tu pregunta (1cor 6:9. ?No sabis que los injustos no heredarn el reino de Dios? No erris; ni los fornicarios, ni los idlatras, ni los adlteros, ni los afeminados, ni los que se echan con varones, - 1 cor6:18-19.Huid de la fornicacin. Cualquier otro pecado que el hombre cometa, est fuera del cuerpo; mas el que fornica, contra su propio cuerpo peca. ?O ignoris que vuestro cuerpo es templo del Espritu Santo, el cual est en vosotros, el cual tenis de Dios, y que no sois vuestros?) Nuestro cuerpo no es nuestro es el templo del Espiritu Santo,no lo sigas destrullendo, espera en Dios ke el te dara lo ke tu anhelas.  Asi que ya sabes, en la biblia si aparece y recuerda ke la biblia fue inspirada por Dios, el hombre tan solo fue un instrumento para escribirla, si tu lo crees bien por ti, y TE FELICITO, pero si no lo crees en vano es tu pregunta al igual ke mi respuesta, pues tu no lo creeras.

Cuando Jehov creo a Adan y Eva los unio como matromonio y les mando tener hijos mediante las relaciones sexuales y fisicamente as los creo, por lo tanto es una bendicin de DIOS, y para l son limpias si se hacen dentro de la institucin sagrada del matrimonio. Pero como todos somos imperfectos, si alguin las tiene antes del matrimonio, puede obtener el perdon mediante la f en el sacrificio de nuestro se?or Jesucristo, pero ademas es necesario el arrepentimiento sincero y debe ir aompa?ado de obras propias del arrepentimiento.

Los trminos originales indican toda clase de relaciones sexuales ilegales.  La prohibicin del 7o mandamiento (Exodo 20:14) incluye la fornicacin, que era parte de los ritos religiosos de los cultos cananeos y en los que a veces los israelitas se mezclaban (2 Cronicas 21:11).  Jess afirm que un hombre no poda divorciarse de su mujer "a no ser por causa de fornicacin" (Mateo 5:32).  El elemento gentil en la iglesia cristiana primitiva fue amonestada contra esta forma de impureza (Hechos 15:20, 29), y Pablo tuvo que escribir claramente a la iglesia de Corinto por causa de la fornicacin que haba entre ellos; tal que ni siquiera se practicaba entre los notoriamente licenciosos paganos de la regin (1 Corintios 5:1).  Advirti a los miembros de la iglesia que no deban mantener contactos con un fornicario aunque pretendiera ser creyente (1 Corintios 6:9, 11).  Adems, se?al que los tales no tienen parte en el reino de Cristo (v 9).  El libro del Apocalipsis usa el trmino en sentido figurado para indicar apostasa espiritual (Apocalipsis 17:2; 19:2).  Te recomiendo buscar informacion acerca de el Adulterio y Sodomia.    La Biblia expresa este concepto de diversos modos e involucra los siguientes trminos:    I. Abadn - "destruccin", "ruina", "perdicin"  Palabra que, en algunos pasajes, aparece en paralelismo con Seol (Job 26:6; 28:22; Sal. 88: 11) y describe un lugar de perdicin (Proverbios 15:11) o el reino de los muertos (27:20); en sentido genrico se refiere a la ruina total (Job 31:12).  En el NT ocurre como nombre simblico del rey -el "ngel del abismo"- de un ejrcito de langostas (Ap. 9:11).  Busca informacion acerca de Apolin; Seol.     A. ngel del abismo.   B. Apolin - "destructor", "el que extermina" equivalente a Abadn.    II. Abismo - "profundo/a" "mundo inferior" Al lugar de los muertos (Salmo 69:15; 71:20; Ezequiel 26:19, 20; Job 38:16, 17).    En el NT:  lugar solitario, alejado del cielo y de los hombres. Morada de los demonios y/o un lugar de tormento (Lucas 8:31; Mateo 8:29; Marcos 5:7), y tambin la morada de los muertos (Romanos 10:7; Salmo 71:20).  En Apocalipsis 9:1, 2, 11 se refiere el lugar de donde salen langostas destructoras, smbolos de agentes  destructores; en los cps 11:7 y 17:8 describe el lugar donde ser encerrada la "bestia"; y en el cp 20:3 es la morada de Satans durante los 1.000 a?os.  III. Eterno   En Mateo. 25:41 se presenta a los impos como reservados para el  "fuego eterno", que se equipara con castigo eterno" (v 46).  El fuego que purificar la tierra (2 Pedro 3:10-12; cf Mateo 3:12; Lucas 3:17) se encender al final del milenio* y aniquilar tanto el alma* como el cuerpo de los impenitentes (Mateo 10:28; Apocalipsis 20:9).    IV. Gehenna    Trmino que denota un lugar de castigo.  Aparece 12 veces en el NT.  Guenna es la forma helenizada de  G Hinn?m, "Valle de Hinom", un desfiladero cercano a Jerusaln que aparece a menudo en el AT (Josue 15:8; 2 Reyes 23:10; 2 Cronicas 33:6;  Jeremias 7:31 ). All se llevaba a cabo el brbaro rito de quemar vivos a los ni?os en honor de Moloc (2 Cronicas 28:3; 33:1, 6), abominacin que aboli el rey Josas mediante la profanacin de los lugares elevados donde se haba practicado esta forma de culto.  Jeremas predijo que por causa de este pecado el Se?or convertira el valle de los hijos de Hinom* en un "valle de matanza", donde los cadveres de los israelitas arderan hasta que no hubiera lugar para uno solo ms, y el resto servira de alimento para las aves de los cielos (Jeremias 7:32, 33).  Sin duda, esto contribuy a que se considerara ese valle como lugar de juicio para los impos. La palabra guenna aparece 3 veces en el Sermn del Monte (Mt. 5:22, 29, 30). La RVR y la DHH traducen la expresin por "infierno de fuego" o sencillamente por "infierno". En el cp 10:28 Jess menciona al que es capaz de "destruir el  alma y el cuerpo en el infierno", y en el cp 18:9 habla del "infierno de fuego". Amonest  a los fariseos acerca "de la condenacin del infierno" (cp 23:33).  Afirm que era mejor ser lisiado, pero lograr la vida eterna, y no serlo y, en cambio, ser arrojado al fuego del infierno (Marcos 9:43, 45, 47).  Su referencia al infierno en Lc. 12:5 aclara que sta ser una experiencia que se producir ms all de la muerte.*|`|a7e71056eaab649e303fe85460a10a38aa	En Nmeros y Levtico..., pero eso es TAN ARCAICO que sinceramente es contra la humana naturaleza en stas pocas.|`|c23280104ec8bec55207f2a36a60fc3eaa	juato al lado de donde dice que si no das limosna te quemaras por hereeeeje jejejeje|`|93aa93ec609e5f0e930aefa6f3c1db5faa	Dios no castiga, cuida!|`|10adfa92228a08de08fe989d7735b990aa	no dice que vas a ir al infierno. pero si que estas en falta con Dios|`|d904e7b0eecc021fd56e3bb2de5b769eaa	Tambien dice que si te arepientes sinceramente sers perdonado.

La palabra hebrea za?nh y otras formas afines transmiten la idea de prostitucin, ayuntamiento o relacin sexual inmoral y fornicacin. (G 38:24; x 34:16; Os 1:2; Le 19:29.) La palabra griega que se traduce fornicacin es por?ni?a, un trmino que, segn explica B. F. Westcott en su libro Saint Pauls Epistle to the Ephesians (1906, pg. 76), se usa en sentido general con referencia a relaciones sexuales ilcitas, tales como  el adulterio, la fornicacin, como es el caso que nos ocupa [Ef 5:3]. A este respecto, el Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament (de W. Bauer, revisin de F. W. Gingrich y F. Danker, 1979, pg. 693) define esta palabra como prostitucin, incontinencia, fornicacin, toda clase de relacin sexual ilcita. Se entiende, por lo tanto, que por?ni?a implica el uso crasamente inmoral de los rganos genitales de por lo menos una persona, aunque hayan debido tomar parte en el acto dos o ms individuos (bien otra persona que se presta al acto o un animal) del mismo sexo o de sexo opuesto. (Jud 7.) La violacin es un acto de fornicacin, pero, por supuesto, no convierte a la vctima en fornicador.  Cuando Dios bendijo al primer matrimonio humano, dijo: Por eso el hombre dejar a su padre y a su madre, y tiene que adherirse a su esposa, y tienen que llegar a ser una sola carne. (G 2:24.) La norma que Dios fij para el hombre y la mujer fue la monogamia, y estaban excluidas las relaciones sexuales promiscuas. Tampoco se contemplaba el divorcio ni las segundas nupcias. En la sociedad patriarcal, los siervos fieles de Dios odiaban la fornicacin, y la consideraban un pecado contra Dios, tanto si eran personas solteras, como si estaban comprometidas o casadas. (G 34:1, 2, 6, 7, 31; 38:24-26; 39:7-9.)  Bajo la Ley. Bajo la ley mosaica, el hombre que cometa fornicacin con una muchacha que no estaba comprometida tena que casarse con ella y pagar a su padre la dote estipulada para una novia (50 siclos de plata; 110 dlares [E.U.A.]). No poda divorciarse de ella en toda su vida. Aunque el padre de ella rehusara drsela en matrimonio, el hombre tena que pagarle el precio de compra prescrito. (x 22:16, 17; Dt 22:28, 29.) Sin embargo, si la muchacha estaba comprometida, el hombre tena que morir lapidado. No se castigaba a la muchacha que gritaba cuando era atacada, pero si no lo haca (indicando as que consenta), tambin se le daba muerte. (Dt 22:23-27.)  La ley que castigaba con la muerte a una muchacha que se casase fingiendo ser virgen, pero que hubiese cometido fornicacin en secreto, realzaba la santidad del matrimonio. Si su marido la acusaba falsamente de tal delito, se consideraba que haba acarreado gran vergenza a la casa del padre de ella. Por tal difamacin los jueces tenan que disciplinar a tal hombre (posiblemente azotarlo) y multarlo con 100 siclos de plata (220 dlares [E.U.A.]), dinero que se entregaba al padre de la esposa. (Dt 22:13-21.) La prostitucin de la hija de un sacerdote deshonraba el sagrado puesto de su padre. A ella deba drsele muerte y luego quemarla como algo detestable. (Le 21:9; vase tambin Le 19:29.) La fornicacin entre personas casadas (adulterio) era una violacin del sptimo mandamiento, y aquellos que cometan tal pecado merecan la pena de muerte. (x 20:14; Dt 5:18; 22:22.)  Si un hombre cometa fornicacin con una sierva designada para otro hombre pero que an no haba sido redimida o liberada, se les tena que castigar a ambos, pero no deba drseles muerte. (Le 19:20-22.) Esto era as porque la mujer todava no era libre y no tena completo control de sus acciones, como lo habra tenido una muchacha comprometida que estuviese en libertad. An no se haba pagado el precio de redencin, o al menos no en su totalidad, por lo que todava era esclava de su amo.  Cuando el avaricioso profeta Balaam vio que no poda maldecir a Israel por medio de artes adivinatorias, procur hacerles incurrir en la desaprobacin de Jehov, inducindolos a tener relaciones sexuales ilcitas. Por medio de las mujeres moabitas, consigui que participaran en el sucio culto flico del Baal de Peor, por lo que 24.000 israelitas perdieron la vida. (N 25:1-9; 1Co 10:8 [es probable que 1.000 cabezas del pueblo fuesen ejecutados y colgados en maderos (N 25:4) y los 23.000 restantes fuesen pasados a espada o muriesen debido al azote].)  Prohibida a los cristianos. Jesucristo restaur la norma original de Dios acerca de la monogamia (Mt 5:32; 19:9) y conden la fornicacin, equiparndola a razonamientos inicuos, asesinatos, robos, falsos testimonios y blasfemia, todo lo cual proviene del interior del hombre, de su corazn, y lo contamina. (Mt 15:19, 20; Mr 7:21-23.) Ms tarde, el cuerpo gobernante de la congregacin cristiana, compuesto por los apstoles y los ancianos que estaban en Jerusaln, escribi a los cristianos en 49 E.C., prohibindoles la fornicacin, que coloc al mismo nivel que la idolatra y el consumo de sangre. (Hch 15:20, 29; 21:25.)  El apstol Pablo se?ala que la fornicacin es una de las obras de la carne, lo opuesto al fruto del espritu de Dios, y advierte que el practicar las obras de la carne impedir que un individuo herede el Reino. (Gl 5:19-21.) Su consejo es que el cristiano amortige su cuerpo en cuanto a fornicacin. (Col 3:5.) Pablo advirti a los cristianos que la por?ni?a ni siquiera debera ser tema de conversacin entre personas santas, tal como a los israelitas se les mand que no mencionasen l|`|211dd64874d5e8d6bfe31eb469be604eaa	1.-El infierno de fuego no es ensenianza biblica.    2.-La biblia expresa en Hebreos:13:4:   "Que el matrimonio sea honorable entre todos, y el lecho conyugal sea sin contaminacin, porque Dios juzgar a los fornicadores y a los adlteros."       3.-Aunk muchas personas creen que el sexo antes del matrimonio es para conocerse mejor, sepas tu que eso no lo aprueba Dios quien es a la ves quien tiene el derecho de decidir que es lo bueno para nosotros pues es quien fundo el matrimonio por lo k esta en su justo derecho de exigir cuenta por ello.

Pero no se te olvida algo? confiesate!. Si es que lo hiciste.    Entre otras cosas estan: El Vaticano,de forma irresponsable se opone al uso de anticonceptivos, ya que segn l, los actos sexuales solo deben estar destinados a la reproduccin; Este mismo personaje se opone a que los estados establezcan una legislacin que permita las uniones de homosexuales.    Cientos de testigos de Jehov han dejado morir a familiares suyos por negarles una transfusin de sangre, mientras que otros grupos cristianos no consultan al mdico porque creen que esto es desconfiar del poder de Dios    La condena a Galileo Galilei     etc etc.  Cada quien con sus creencias, y lo ms importante es no ser hipocrita, por ejemplo, alguien que diga que es catolico, pero en el fondo no le gusta esa religion.    y si crees en algo, debes tener en cuenta las consecuencias.

a14c497f259e212762edecb5af3a805eaa	Darwin pensaba que el registro fsil apoyaba su teora, pero realmente l admiti ms de una vez en su famoso libro1, que el registro fsil es un estorbo para su teora de la descendencia de un ancestro comn. l saba que si su teora era cierta, debera haber incontable nmero de formas transicionales (por ejemplo. 100% reptil, 75% reptil  25% ave, 50% reptil 50% ave, 25% reptil  75% ave, 100% ave y muchas formas transicionales entre cada una de ellas). Darwin atribuy la falta de evidencia a nuestra ignorancia del registro fsil. Pero hoy nuestros museos estn cargados con fsiles y los eslabones perdidos siguen perdidos.  Como el gelogo evolucionista de Harvard, Stephen Gould, lo puso:   La rareza extrema de las formas transicionales en el registro fsil persiste como secreto de oficio de la paleontologa. Los rboles evolucionistas que adornan nuestros libros de texto tienen informacin slo de la punta y los nodos de sus ramas; el resto es inferencia, quizs razonable, ms no la evidencia de fsiles.      1.Charles Darwin, The Origin of Species, pp. 206, 292 y 307, Penguin Books, London, 1982; reimpresin de la edicin de 1859.|`|f26ba0c74c85760988a9f69dd8937aefaa	Mhh mira no te molestes, pero me parece que te hace falta leer un muchote, pues de verdad estas confundiendo la luna con su reflejo en el agua.

674e0ad95f862cc2fdd12dc536cb6c86aa	Because Christians like arguing endlessly about non-verifiable points|`|AA10663644	Well, even if the people you are talking about are full of hate, as a Christian, I think that you should try to understand that Jesus was forgiving to even the worst people. And we are supposed to try to act in His image. So however ashamed that you are of those people, you should strive to be Christlike, and not full of hate like the others.    To me, it is very unimportant what they feel. They can hate all they want; I will continue to be forgiving. I will continue to be nice. I will continue to treat them respectfully. Because that is what I believe that God wants from us!|`|RdxuJGjwaa	got it in one and i like your honesty not many christains would have the guts to say it|`|A8AjT33iaa	Theyre brainwashed to the point of mental illness. This is the internet and they think they have a captive audience. They just dont realise that being gay isnt a choice and theres no way we could change sexuality even if we desperately wanted to.     If a Christian comes to the gay section and asks a valid question, then yes thats fine. If some gays want to debate with them they can and the others will move onto another question. The problem starts when a gay asks something like are there any lesbian clubs in Manchester. At that point you get Christians jumping in saying things like you have a perverted lifestyle and youll burn in hell. Now what the does that have to do with the original question being asked? They know their comments are unrelated to the question, theyre just saying these things to be as offensive as possible. Then they wonder why we dont respect them.|`|6946e6d5e868e0b91ff73b7e55329484aa	because we hate homosexuality  not homos the people - homosexuality the perversion|`|qgJDdCiHaa	I don't think we can lump all Christians into HATING homosexuals. While it's true that many in our faith have taken to cruelty and bad behavior towards those of a homosexual nature, they shouldn't, however they shouldn't say that it's OK and great to be homosexual either when that's not what we believe. I believe we should be tolerant and loving to ALL people without promoting this kind of behaviour as what we accept. Society seems to have 2 views. Either you are totally into homosexuality and think it's wonderful or you loathe it and wish God would strike down all those who participate. I believe it's got more levels than that though. As a very smart priest I knew once said all the time "Hate the sin but love the sinner". I don't wish ill of any homosexual, but I don't believe that homosexuality is what our Lord planned for us. I think it's one of those things caused by original sin that deformed us...like being born with one eye or having a grave disease...surely we don't hate people for having 1 arm or having a seizure disorder but we don't love the idea of people suffering from Seizures and missing body parts either.|`|rJC3EWmzaa	There is a difference between disagreement and hatred. Just because I believe that homosexuality is a sin, doesn't mean that I hate homosexuals. Homosexuals hate hearing that what they are doing is sin. Nobody likes to hear it. It is human nature to hate the idea that anything you want to do is wrong. Do you believe that it would be wrong for me to be an adulterer?  If so, then why?  Just because you say so? No. I don't do it because my Creator told me not to, even though my fallen human nature wants to. We must appeal to a higher power  other than  humans. The same God of the bible which tells me not to cheat on my wife also tells me that homosexuality is wrong. Again, I don't hate homosexuals, I simply think they are fooling themselves if they think that God is okay with it,  just as I would be fooling myself if I thought God was okay with me if I chased other women.|`|6737bc1385aaa269c889b6f7c3e1c1e7aa	Because difference is not accepted by many; those who choose to be different from the general group are hated, feared and avoided, because people are afraid of change.

Many have violent tendencies by which they physically harm gays in the name of "God".  Since Jesus was a non-violent person and would not be pleased with gay people being bashed, it seems sensible that gays rightfully accuse some Christians of hate.|`|vtu0D50jaa	Like you, other Christians aren't homophobic due to theology.

I just cannot tolerate hypocrites who point fingers and judge. We are all sinners. I dont care what anybody thinks or says about me. The choices I make in my life are between my God and me, period.  Another thing that bothers me is people saying God hates this and God hates that. I personally have never found the words 'God hates' in my Bible.|`|KxFfD9nhaa	ignorance.

Mat 16:19 A ti te dar las llaves del Reino de los Cielos; y lo que ates en la tierra quedar atado en los cielos, y lo que desates en la tierra quedar desatado en los cielos.?    "Tu eres pedro y sobre eta piedra edificare mi Iglesia" La unica Iglesia que ha mantenido a Pedro como base y a Cristo como cabeza es la catolica.  "Las puertas del Hades no prevaleceran contra ella" Entonces esa es la razon porque el error (como tu lo dices) no ha acabado, esta protejida por Cristo    Con esto pretendo decirte que la Iglesia catolica no esta equivcada, es la unica que mantiene un orden obispal desde Pedro y hasta el momento le han sucedido 256 obispos de Roma.

Como ateo te puedo decir que no me siento ni ms inteligente, ni ms tonto que cualquiera de mis semejantes. Admiro a Newton salvo por su creencia en la trinidad. ?Vaya inteligencia! ?No?    W. Dyer deca que - en igualdad de circunstancias - "...todos los seres humanos somos capaces de desarrollarla (la inteligencia)..."    Por otra parte, el que a la fecha muchas personas no comprendan el cmo de las cosas no les hace ni ms ni menos inteligentes.    Newton no conoci la teora del Big-Bang (entendiendo como "teora" algo que est demostrado en este caso particular.    No obstante, la ciencia tiene por cierto que luego de las tres fases del Big-Bang, en la segunda de ellas - si no me equivoco - la explosin fue tan fuerte que borr todo vestigio de lo que antes exista.    Si la ciencia pudiese establecer ese momento y no el "punto cero", lo hubiese dicho. Sin embargo, todo apunta a que no hay dioses detrs de eso.    Al igual que fueron siglos enteros para terminar con la "teora" del geocentrismo, date unos a?os ms y quizs entonces obtengs la respuesta.    La ciencia est trabajando en ello. Pods tenerlo por seguro. Hace no muchos a?os, el cielo estaba "arriba". Luego de los primeros viajes espaciales, TODAS las religiones, salvo algunas que permanecen en el oscurantismo, tuvieron que cambiar su opinin.    De nuevo te repito, que la falacia de apelacin a la autoridad est ms que trillada. Es un truco muy a?ejo.

Porque sus palabras y su ejemplo irritan las conciencias,   Porque defiende la verdad aunque incomode,   Porque no se deja manipular por la moda, aunque le critiquen,   Porque no puede ser etiquetado como de derechas o de izquierdas,   Porque es fiel a la misin que Cristo le ha confiado.   Pero no nos enga?emos, no es con argumentos como mejor defenderemos al Papa y a la Iglesia...     sino haciendo nuestro su mensaje y su ejemplo. En pocas palabras: slo si vivimos el Evangelio sin mediocridad haremos que nuestra defensa de la Iglesia sea un ataque.       --------------------------------------...    La lucha comienza con uno mismo:     ?Eres capaz de reconciliarte con tus adversarios, como Cristo Rey en la cruz, como el Papa fue a visitar a Al Agca, quien intent asesinarle en mayo de 1981?   ?Dedicas tiempo a la oracin, como Cristo que sola retirarse en la noche a orar, como el Papa que dedica diariamente varias horas a la oracin y vive con espritu de oracin todos los acontecimientos de la vida?   ?Eres sincero para expresar tus convicciones en pblico, como Cristo ante los fariseos que buscaban atraparle en sus palabras, como el Papa que no duda en expresar el rechazo de la Iglesia al aborto y a los anticonceptivos, aunque incomode?   ?Buscas formarte en tu fe y capacitarte intelectual y profesionalmente, para poder ayudar a los que dudan en su fe, como Cristo, a quien la gente le segua porque hablaba con autoridad, como el Papa, quien ha sido obrero, actor, poeta, profesor y cuya palabra convences   ?Es tu vida testimonio de dedicacin a los dems, de defensa de la justicia y de la paz, de bondad y humildad con todos, de esperanza, como Cristo, quien pas haciendo el bien, como el Papa, quien habla en nombre de los que sufren la guerra, el hambre, la injusticia y siempre a favor de la paz?   ?Es Mara tu madre a quien concias tu vida y es ella modelo de virtudes, como Cristo, hijo de marca, como el Papa, todo de ella?   ?Aprovechas tu tiempo a fondo, sin preocuparse de intereses egostas y placeres pasajeros como Cristo, enteramente dedicado a anunciar el Evangelio y curar a los enfermos, como el Papa, quien todo su tiempo lo dedica a la Iglesia, al mundo, a sus hermanos los hombres?   --------------------------------------...    Algunas cosas concretas que puedes hacer:     Defiende al Papa noblemente si escuchas que alguien lo critica en tu presencia. Guardar silencio puede ser una cobarda.   Frmate bien para poder responder con fundamento a quienes ense?an doctrinas diversas de las del Papa. Estudia la doctrina de la Iglesia, lee los documentos del Papa.   Difunde en tu ambiente de trabajo, en tu familia, en tu escuela y con tus amistades el pensamiento del Papa y de la Iglesia. - Tambin puedes ayudar mucho a otros dando a conocer el contenido de este folleto: imprmelo, scale copias y dalo a tus conocidos.   Manifiesta pblicamente tus convicciones. Si en revistas, radio o televisin tienes oportunidad de expresarle, aprovecha para defender al Papa y a la Iglesia. Si son atacados, puede ser bueno escribir una carta al editor o llamar al programa.   Ora diariamente por el Papa y por la Iglesia, por sus necesidades e intenciones. Ora por la unidad de la Iglesia bajo la gua del Papa.   Seamos sinceros: ?Ests poniendo todo de tu parte, con generosidad, sin excusarte en que tus posibilidades son pocas o porque te falta formacin?     Benedicto XVI, cuando tena tu edad sinti lo que t sientes ahora. Pudo haber encontrado mil excusas.    Sin embargo, dijo s a Cristo y hoy t y yo nos beneficiamos de ese s.     Por eso, di s a la Iglesia que te necesita.   Di s al Papa que te necesita.   Di s a tus hermanos que te necesitan,   Di s a Cristo que te necesita,   Tu vida puede ser una continuacin de la del Papa.    Tu vida puede ser testimonio y esperanza para los dems.

Por qu? porque si te has arriesgado a tener sexo sin haberte cuidado, ahora debes enfrentar las consecuencias.  Suicidndote pierdes todo irremediablemente. Abortando: haces pagar a otra persona (por que ya existe vida en ese embrin) con su vida un descuido tuyo, ?te parecera lgico?  Tu ests creciendo, y debes tomar en cuenta que uno debe ser responsable por lo que hace. Una de las consecuencias de tener relaciones es que puedes quedar embarazada, y si te sentiste suficientemente independiente para tener relaciones, no debes culpar (y hacer pagar) al nuevo ser por lo que es responsabilidad tuya.  Tambin piensa que al hacerte un aborto casero, pones en serio riesgo tu vida, y seria peor porque tus padres se enteraran tarde o temprano, ya que seguramente te quedaran secuelas importantes en tu cuerpo, de las cuales probablemente te arrepientas luego toda la vida.

Un aborto siempre deja consecuencias psicolgicas para toda la vida que se evidencias en problemas sexuales como frigidez, por ejemplo. O sea que no te soluciona nada, solo te complica mas la vida para siempre que tener un hijo, que por lo menos te trae alegra. Un trauma psicolgico no.Y tus padres , seguramente van a reaccionar mal al principio, pero cuando vean esa carita de beb que hace "pucherito", sonre mientras duerme, despues dice "gu-gu", "paaa...paaaa..." , despus "abuuuu" , te aseguro que se les va a derretir el corazn. ?FUERZA, VALOR, Y ENCAR LA VIDA COMO VENGA!!|`|732f7f0e2c460245e3a7f5c452b2e905aa	No hags locuras y hablalo con tus viejos.

Entiendo que solo tengas 15 a?os, y el tema de tus padres, pero no conozco a la madre que no quisiera tener un nieto, puede ser que si buscas por la buena y de a poco, puedas llegar a decrselo a tu padres. Y si definitivamente no quieres tenerlo.... mmm.... Podras consultar a un medico de todos modos, porque como eres muy ni?a aun, podran haber algunas complicaciones, supongo, creo que habra que hablar con alguien que sepa bien del tema, porque en la bsqueda de como  sacar a ese ni?o(a), puedes poner en peligro tu vida al intentar el aborto, y eso seria lo peor que podra pasarte a ti y a tu familia.

Ac estoy de regreso y transcribo esa Poesa que contiene la SABIDURIA solo hay que entender el significado oculto  ?Porqu ?  " Hay un viejo misterio en el universo:  ? porqu la Vida ?  ? Para qu la Creacin? "  Los intelectos se afanan, buscan...y no encuentran  y como no encuentran inventan teoras, pero el antiguo misterio...  solo al AMOR se revela,  (a la conciencia iluminada por amor).  Privilegio de simples y sencillos, como ni?os."  AMOR es un ingrediente sutil de la conciencia.  Es capaz de mostrar el sentido profundo de la existencia.  AMOR es  la nica droga legal.   Algunos buscan equivocadamente en el licor y otras drogas lo que produce el AMOR.  AMOR es lo ms necesario de la vida. Los sabios conocen  el secreto,  y buscan slo  AMOR. Los dems lo ignoran,  por eso buscan lo externo.  ? Cmo obtener AMOR ?  Ninguna tcnica sirve porque....  AMOR, no es material. No est sometido a las leyes del pensamiento y la razn.    Ellas estn sometidas a El.  Para obtener AMOR, primero hay que saber que AMOR  no es un sentimiento sino un ser.  AMOR es alguien, un Espritu viviente y real que,  cuando despierta en nosotros llega la dicha, llega todo.  ? Cmo hacer para que venga?  Primero hay que creer que existe (porque no se ve, slo se siente) (algunos le dicen Dios)  despus hay que buscarlo en su morada ntima:  el Corazn.  No hay que llamarlo, porque ya est en nosotros.  No hay pedirle que venga...  sino dejarle salir, liberarlo, entregarlo.  No se trata de pedir AMOR sino de dar AMOR.  ? Cmo se obtiene AMOR ?  Dando AMOR      AMANDO ???  y cuando los seres humanos destierren de sus mentes y sus corazones  el odio, la envidia, el miedo, las fobias, el rencor y la avaricia   all encontrarn la PAZ y el AMOR?|`|AA11411121	"Porque de tal manera am Dios al mundo, que ha dado a su hijo unignito, para que todo aquel que crea en l, no perezca, sino que tenga vida eterna" (San Juan 3:16).     "Estas cosa os he escrito a vosotros que creis en el nombre del Hijo de Dios, para que sepis que tenis vida eterna" (1 Juan 5:13).   Es cierto, el cristianismo es una religin, pero uno puede ser religioso sin ser Cristiano. Cristo conden a los fariseos religiosos porque se escondieron tras una fachada de religin y una moralidad externa.    Parece extra?o, pero Dios no es religioso ni tiene una moralidad externa. A El le importa solo una relacin ntima y la realidad. Es decir, desea que tengamos una relacin correcta con El igualmente el uno con el otro y con si mismo. El desea que seamos verdicos, es decir confesar lo que realmente somos para que pueda ayudarnos.    Tampoco es el propsito de Dios el hacer a uno bueno. ?El quiere hacernos completos, nicamente al punto que nuestras acciones, estilo de vida y relaciones sean sanas!    La religin desea repararnos por fuera. Dios desea repararnos de por dentro por fuera. El por fuera puede ser una tarea imposible. El por dentro es lo que nos da la libertad. El cristianismo no es una serie de reglas y ordenanzas. Es experimentar un amor divino, una aceptacin y perdn divino.    Es de ayuda reconocer que Dios no existe solo para castigarnos por los pecados cometidos. De hecho, no importa lo que hayamos hecho o no, l nos ama con un amor eterno y tiene un prposito para nuestra vida. ?Para esta vida y tambin para la otra! Cmo Jess dijo: De tal manera am Dios al mundo, que dio a su nico Hijo, para que todo aquel que crea en l, no perezca, sino que tenga vida eterna.1 Tambin nos dijo: Yo he venido para que tengan vida, y la tengan en abundancia.2    Nos presentamos a otros dando la impresin de que todo anda bien, pero interiortmente cada uno de nosotros tiene un problema mayor. El filsofo romano Seneca, dijo con brusquedad: Todos han pecado. Algunos ms y otros menos. La Palabra de Dios est de acuerdo. Dice: Por cuanto todos pecaron, y estn destituidos de la gloria de Dios.3 El pecado, sin embargo, no es solamente el cometer hechos da?osos. Es cualquiera cosa que no llegue a la norma perfecta que Dios haya proyectado para nosotros. Esto incluye el tener inquina y otras emociones negativas, orgullo, celos, motivos mixtos etctera. La mayora de nosostros, tambin pecamos en omisin; es decir, no practicando lo que sabemos es nuestro deber y lo que se debe hacer.4|`|d6a6cbd9747014932f8771c3bc66eda4aa	No creo,sino no haramos tantas barbaridades.|`|d904e7b0eecc021fd56e3bb2de5b769eaa	Lamentablemente no tods, sino el mundo sera mejor.  yo lo he sentido personalmente, he sobrevivido a una ciruga casi imposible, sobrellev una quimioterapia en pie ( y los das en los que no estaba tan bien Jess me llev en brazos  para que siga en mi camino) y hoy estoy disfrutando de mis hijos.

Por ejemplo, ms o menos a los tres o cuatro meses despus de una enfermedad o de una ciruga mayor usted puede repentinamente perder una cantidad grande de cabello. Esta prdida de cabello se relaciona con el estrs causado por la enfermedad y es temporal.    Problemas hormonales pueden ocasionar la prdida del cabello. Si su glndula tiroide est demasiado activa, o si est menos activa de lo normal su cabello puede carsele. Esta prdida del cabello usualmente puede ayudarse con el tratamiento de la enfermedad tiroidea. La prdida del cabello puede ocurrir si no hay un balance de las hormonas masculinas o femeninas conocidas con el nombre de andrgenos y estrgenos.

Algunos medicamentos causan la cada del cabello. Este tipo de prdida del cabello mejora cuando usted para de tomar el medicamento.

Ciertas infecciones pueden causar la cada del cabello. Los ni?os pueden tener cada del cabello por causa de una infeccin por hongos en el cuero cabelludo.

God, the Most Compassionate, didn't leave man to go astray without an unadulterated reference. Indeed, He revealed the Quran and promised to preserve it as the final revelation for humankind for all times. It is the word of God which He revealed to Prophet Muhammad (mercy and peace of God be upon him) through the Angel Gabriel. It was revealed in parts over a period of 23 years. The Quran deals with the basis of creeds, morality, history of humanity, worship, knowledge, wisdom, God-man relationship, and human relationship in all aspects. Comprehensive teaching on which, can be built sound systems of social justice, economics, politics, legislation, jurisprudence, law and international relations, are important contents of the Quran. The Prophet Muhammad (mercy and peace of God be upon him) dictated the revelation to his companions who wrote it down during his lifetime on palm leaves, parchments, bones, flat stones, etc. In addition, the Qur'an was committed to heart by many of Prophet Muhammad's companions. One year after the death of Prophet Muhammad (mercy and peace of God be upon him), the first Caliph (Ruler), Abu-Bakr, instructed the Prophets companions to collect the whole Quran in one volume. The third Caliph, Uthman, prepared several copies from the original text and sent them to the major centers of Islamic Civilization. From that time onwards, more than 1400 years ago, the same Quranic text has been in use with the exact wording, order and language (Arabic). Not a single word from its 114 chapters has been changed since it was revealed. Indeed, God promised in the Quran to preserve it forever. He said: Verily, I have sent down the Quran, and indeed, I will guard it from corruption.   (15:9). An essential point to understand about the Quran is that it is a miracle both in its revelation and content.  I advise you to see the following links which show the evidence that the Holy Quran is a miracle.    http://www.jalyat.net/          www.miraclesofthequran.com    At the time of the revelation and since, there have been those who have denied the divine and miraculous nature of the Quran saying that Muhammad (mercy and peace of God be upon him) was either taught by others or that he wrote it by himself! In order to counteract this claim, God lays  down a challenge to the whole of humankind saying:  If you are in doubt concerning what I have revealed to My slave (Muhammad), then produce one chapter like it and you may call on your helpers beside Allah, if you are truthful. (2:23) .These are from the prophecies which the Quran foretold as no one from the time of the Prophet (mercy and peace of God be upon him) until this day has been able to produce the like of one chapter or even a verse of the Quran.    Note that the Quran was revealed to Muhammad (peace be upon him) in Arabic only. So, any Quranic translation, either in English or any other language, is neither a Quran, nor a version of the Quran, but rather it is only a translation of the meaning of the Quran. The Quran exists only in the Arabic in which it was revealed.

That's why the Catholic church has such a heirarchical/feudal structure--because it was created during the time of the Roman Empire, and that was the way they knew how to run things. On the other hand, look at the new "mega-churches" popping up that are all about mixing entertainment with their services, with music and big-screen projection and whatnot? We're an entertainment culture, so why not?      I can't think of a lot of "new" religions.  Maybe Neo-Paganism which, although it takes a great deal from older paganism, is its own entity.

Because they have been brainwashed with a repressive and unatainable moral code since early childhood, the assumptions of this moral code are often found as elements in the new religion.    You can point to the same reason for the differences. People who have managed to break partially away from this repressive and unattainable moral code are trying to create something a bit more sane and conducive to mental health.

I do not spend any time in that section.  I am generally in this section answering questions.  If you have a few minutes, please read on...    To become a real Christian, we are told that we must HEAR the WORD in John 6:45, Jesus said, It is written in the prophets, And they shall all be taught by God.  Therefore everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to Me.  We are also told so in Romans 10:17 So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.  We are told the we must BELIEVE in Hebrews 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.  We are also told so in Mark 16:16, Jesus said He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned.  and in John 5:24 "Most assuredly, I say to you, he who hears My word and believes in Him who sent Me has everlasting life, and shall not come into judgment, but has passed from death into life.  We are told that we must REPENT (or turn from sin) in Luke 13:3 I tell you, no; but unless you repent you will all likewise perish.  Also in Acts 17:30 Truly, these times of ignorance God overlooked, but now commands all men everywhere to repent.  We are told to CONFESS CHRIST in Romans 10:9-10 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.  For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.  We are also told in 1 Timothy 6:12 Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, to which you were also called and have confessed the good confession in the presence of many witnesses.  We are to be BAPTIZED according to Acts 2:38 Then Peter said to them, "Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. and Mark 16:16 He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned.  We are to CONTINUE to be FAITHFUL UNTIL DEATH according to Revelation 2:10c Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life.  We also know that Paul wrote in Romans 14:12 each of us shall give account of himself to God.  It is important that we not ignore what is written, change what is written, or add to what is written in the New Testament which is our Christian Guide.  Have a great week.

The group of people you mentioned are generally more accepting than the population at large, because they accept themselves and therefore accept others.    Be certain to avoid holding this against the hateful ones though as it is out of pure ignorance (not knowing any better/different) that "they" are hateful.  Plus, if it weren't for hateful ones, you may not have found your freedom to begin with.  Be thankful for the hateful ones, since they have helped you to find who you truely are and also to find others like you.  If the hateful ones were not hateful, you may not have ever made this discovery.    Plus, hateful ones are only hateful because you have discovered something they would greatly love to reconcile within themselves, but have yet been unable to do so.|`|da0efa9a4c9cd0cf1e51d2eb30746cf6aa	the correct answer is no. Jesus and the apostles mostly befriended prostitutes, lowlifes, homosexuals, tax collectors and various people who were considered by Jews to be the dregs of society. the bible condemns homosexuality because it isn't the natural use of the human body. it also condemns having sex between straight people who aren't married. and if u get divorced and you aren't the victim of a cheating spouse you can never remarry again. many of the early church members of the church were homosexuals, who either changed over or became celibate. the bible says that homosexuality arrives from worshiping pleasure and other aspects of the creation in opposition of worshipping the creator. also it should be noted that the bible condemns ANYONE WHO HATES HIS FELLOW MAN OR WOMAN TO DEATH. THE BIBLE CALLS HATE MURDER.|`|0a6c712a8bcefcb178d03401236a3645aa	more importantly why is your face blotched out on your avatar? nice body......to answer your question... I don't know....

484512cde8bfb0d25916588b41a80a5faa	Primero los padrinos de Velacion son los unicos que canonicamente son requeridos para una boda.     Su funcion es un compromiso muy fuerte.     Van a asistir al enlace matrimonial de una pareja y dan fe como todos los demas asistentes, de que se realiza por la libre voluntad, sin que nada ni nadie los presione, y ellos Velaran por que la pareja funcione segun lo ofrecido en la misma ceremonia de Matrimonio.     entonces tienen que Velar que se cumpla lo que los novios prometen durante el sacramento, que es lo siguiente:     Permanencia del matrimonio, que es para siempre.     Recibir com amor los hijos que dios les de.     Educarlos en la fe de nuestra Iglesia.     El esposo promete fidelidad a la esposa, amarla y respetarla todos los dias de su vida, y tener cuidado que nada falte en el hogar.     La esposa promete fidelidad al esposo, amarlo y respetarlo todos los dias de su vida, y cuidar que todo se aproveche en su hogar.     Entonces la Velacion se extiende desde cuidar y aconsejar a fin de que haya fidelidad y respeto en al pareja, reciban con amor a los hijos, los bauticen, confirmen y lleven al catecismo, para iniciarlos en la fe, el esposo no gaste lo que ahora pertenece a su esposa y a sus hijos en otras cosas  y la mujer no despilfarre. bueno en fin velaran por todo el compromiso matrimonial.     Seria bueno que cuando nos inviten a ser Padrinos de Velacion de una Boda, les dijeramos que si van a aceptar con respeto la guia y correciones que les demos a nuestros ahijados.     y no aceptar serlo si no estamos dispuestos a adquirir un compromiso tan grande, pues tambien seremos juzgados por lo que prometimosen la iglesia misma, velar por un matrimonio y luego lo olvidamos, seria muy grave.     Espero esta informacion te sea util.     PD. cuando somos Padrinos de Bautizo el compromiso no termina con el Bautizo sino que ahi empieza, debemos ver que nuestro ahijado (a) continue su iniciacion cristiana, se confirme en la fe, lleve su catecismo y se acerque a la comunion o eucaristia, y si dios nos presta vida llevarlo al altar a que se case por la iglesia, ahi nomas., asi que si tienen ahijados por ahi olvidados, ponganse las pilas y a trabajar que eso fue lo que se prometio.|`|936bdac2f4f04e5c2526d82fcee7e9aeaa	la funcion es que el alma del difunto no vaya para el camino incorrecto. eso queda a manos de dios segun la conciencia de los que apadrinan al muerto.|`|32ddae48d97b597ca9cadad91b4e5babaa	jamas habia oido de eso! pero pues ya no saben ni como gorrear el ataud o los gastos funerarios!|`|AA11411121	Un padrino de velacin es  son los responsables de velar por el bienesar de un matrimonio, de estar con ellos guandolos y apoyandolos en las buenas y en las malas.

Creo que el juicio a Hussein fue irregular (as le en diversas noticias), por ende, no tuvo juicio justo.  Y ms all de que fue una persona que hizo mucho da?o, nadie merece la pena de muerte.   Adems, ?fue juzgado por mandato de EEUU? Ja, justamente, un pas que se dedica a matar gente de una u otra forma. Justamente Bush!!! Por favor!!!  Siempre pens que si las leyes se cumplieran como se debe, y no se aplicarn  el 2 x1 y esas cosas que inventan los legisladores (al menos en Argentina), los criminales tendran su justa condena, encerrados de por vida, sin la posibilidad de volver a da?ar a nadie.

Alguien dijo que cada persona es un mundo y eso es una realidad. Como seres humanos tenemos necesidades y areas de nuestra vida que deben ser llenadas. Todos necesitamos ser amados y amar, ser felices y tener un hogar, una familia. Necesitamos tener los recursos suficientes para suplir nuestras necesidades econmicas tales como la ropa, la comida, un techo donde vivir. Necesitamos sentirnos realizados, que nuestra vida tiene un propsito y que hemos logrado algo, que no hemos luchado en vano y hemos alcanzado las metas que nos hemos propuesto. Aunque existen exepciones, todo esto y mucho ms es necesario para la mayoria de nosotros.    Sin embargo, existe un rea en nosotros que ha sido reservada para Dios y que solo El puede llenar. Quizs pienses que Dios est muy ocupado con los asuntos del universo para ocuparse de t. O quizs no creas que Dios existe, o que Dios es un viejito de barba blanca sentado en un trono en el cielo con un rayo en la mano esperando a ver quien hace algo malo para enviar un corrientazo...Tenemos buenas noticias para t: Dios no es ni un viejito, ni esta esperando para mandarte un rayo, ni tampoco es algo abstracto y misterioso. ?Dios es real y est vivo! y tu lo puedes conocer. El nos ha dejado su biografa escrita para que le conozcamos y sepamos que quiere de nosotros y como podemos acercarnos a El. Asi como el manual que viene cuando compras un equipo electrnico o una computadora, la Biblia es el manual que vino con la creacin de Dios.    A travs de los tiempos, muchos han tratado de negar la divinidad de las Santas Escrituras, pero han fracasado. Biblias has sido quemadas, destrudas y pisoteadas, pero se cumple lo que dijo Jess en Mateo 24:35, "...el cielo y la tierra pasarn, pero mi palabras no pasarn..." Pruebas cintificas, la ciencia y la arqueologia han confirmado la veracidad de la Biblia, pero las pruebas mayores son las vidas transformadas, alcoholicos y adictos liberados, familias salvadas, matrimonios restaurados y enfermedades curadas milagrosamente. Los hechos y testigos a travs de los siglos hablan por si solos de la existencia de un Dios Todopoderoso y que es todo amor.|`|e8b454fddfa626c8e195e4248916ea16aa	creo que lo que existe es el libre albedro , la vida muchas veces te presenta situaciones y si eres lo suficiente inteligente las tomas  o las dejas y as te iras labrando tu camino de aprendizaje en este plano|`|56720eaa9f823d16dc356528637a169aaa	nosotros asemos nuestro propio destinos|`|7f9a1acd5fcaf8e99c1c2b68d3956168aa	Nosotros hacemos nuestro propio destino.|`|3d2b58d6f6b78129a3e9272cf5fa3763aa	Elijo la 2.|`|3d5f7f73ee2bae0d0cb0f49bd7448261aa	Yo soy de los que creen que uno es el que crea su destino|`|ee9749f042edb55922f15ed9fe5cf25faa	Cada cual es el artfice de su propio destino, es una frase muy antigua, pero an sigue teniendo vigencia.

Era hablada por casi 364 millones de personas en el a?o 2000[1]. La estimacin actual se acerca a los 400 millones[2], convirtiendo el espa?ol en la segunda lengua con ms hablantes en el mundo (luego del chino mandarn), y la ms difundida y ms estudiada de las lenguas romances. Es la lengua ms difundida y estudiada por angloparlantes[cita requerida] debido a su perceptivo sentido prctico en un siglo XXI globalizado, teniendo ambos idiomas nmeros similares de hablantes nativos, estando bastante disperso a nivel mundial, y hablado en un gran nmero de pases. Por razones similares, es tambin el segundo idioma ms estudiado en Brasil, que est casi completamente rodeado de naciones hispanoparlantes.    El espa?ol se origin como un dialecto del latn, en las zonas limtrofes entre Cantabria, Burgos y La Rioja, provincias del actual norte de Espa?a. De ah, fue extendindose en el Reino de Castilla, donde eventualmente se convirti en el principal idioma del gobierno. Fue luego llevado a Amrica y otras partes del mundo en los ltimos cinco siglos por exploradores, conquistadores, colonizadores y constructores de imperios. El espa?ol es un de los seis idiomas oficiales de la Organizacin de las Naciones Unidas y uno de los idiomas ms usados en el mundo, junto con el ingls. Es ms hablado en Norteamrica y Sudamrica y Europa. Con el mercado globalizado, hay una gran expansin y reconocimiento del idioma espa?ol en literatura, la industria del cine, televisin (notablemente telenovelas) y bastante en msica   Historia  Artculo principal: Historia del idioma espa?ol.  La Historia del idioma espa?ol comienza con el latn vulgar del Imperio Romano, ms especficamente, tiene su origen en el latn vulgar presente en la zona central del norte de Hispania. Tras la cada del Imperio Romano en el siglo V la influencia del latn culto en la gente comn fue disminuyendo paulatinamente. El latn hablado de entonces fue el fermento de las variedades romances hispnicas, entre ellas el castellano, origen a su vez (al menos en la proporcin mayor), de las variedades que constituyen la lengua espa?ola. En el siglo VIII, la invasin musulmana de la Pennsula Ibrica hace que se formen dos zonas bien diferenciadas: en Al-ndalus, se hablarn los dialectos romances englobados con el trmino mozrabe, adems de las lenguas de la minora invasora (rabe y bereber), mientras que en la zona en que se forman los reinos cristianos, desde pocos a?os despus del inicio de la dominacin musulmana, comenzar una evolucin divergente, en la que surgen varias modalidades romances: la catalana, la aragonesa, la asturiano-leonesa y la gallega, adems de la castellana.    El dialecto castellano primigenio se origin en el condado medieval de Castilla (oriente de Cantabria y norte de Burgos), con influencias vascas y rabes, y se expandi al sur de la pennsula gracias a la Reconquista. En el Siglo XV, durante el proceso de unificacin espa?ola de sus reinos, Antonio de Nebrija publica en Salamanca su Grammatica, el primer tratado de gramtica de la lengua castellana, y tambin primero de una lengua vulgar europea.    Con la expansin del Imperio Espa?ol, el espa?ol se expandi a travs de los Virreinatos del Per, Nueva Espa?a, Nueva Granada, el Ro de la Plata y la colonia Filipina.    Algunas de las caractersticas distintivas de la fonologa incluyen la lenicin (latn vita - espa?ol vida, latn lupus - espa?ol lobo), la diptongacin en los casos fonticamente breves de la E y la O (latn terra - espa?ol - tierra, latn novum - espa?ol nuevo), y la palatalizacin (latn annum - espa?ol a?o). Algunas de estas caractersticas estn tambin presentes en otras lenguas romances.       Dialectos del espa?ol     Mapa dialectal del espa?ol de Espa?a.Las variedades del espa?ol difieren entre s por infinidad de razones, entre las que estn el empleo del fonema //  /s/ para la "z" en la palabra "zorro", por ejemplo, y la distincin de los sonidos para indicar /d?/, ya sea [?] (espa?ol rioplatense), [j] (espa?ol centroamericano)  // (espa?ol de Andaluca).

41fc7f1fd75de3804683f56d513c55a4aa	MAR SALADO    Una de las designaciones bblicas del gran lago o mar conocido en la actualidad como el mar Muerto. En el mar Salado (Yam ha-Melah) desemboca el ro Jordn.    Nombre. "Mar Salado" es la primera denominacin que aparece en la Biblia para designar este mar, y tambin la ms frecuente. El trmino es muy apropiado, pues esta es la masa de agua ms salada que hay en la Tierra. (G 14:3; N 34:3, 12; Jos 15:2, 5.) Est en la gran falla en la que se encuentra el Arab, por lo que tambin recibe el nombre de mar del Arab. (Dt 4:49; 2Re 14:25.) No obstante, a veces se a?ade el nombre "mar Salado" despus de decir "mar del Arab", quizs para dejar claro a qu masa de agua se hace referencia con este ltimo nombre. (Dt 3:17; Jos 3:16; 12:3.) Como el mar Salado estaba en el lmite oriental de la Tierra Prometida, tambin se le llamaba "mar oriental", distinguindolo as del "mar occidental", el Mediterrneo. (Eze 47:18; Joe 2:20; Zac 14:8.) Josefo lo llam el lago Asfaltites, pues saba que de vez en cuando emergen manchas grandes de betn o asfalto a su superficie. (La Guerra de los Judos, libro I, cap. XXXIII, sec. 5; libro IV, cap. VIII, sec. 4.) Parece que no se le lleg a llamar mar Muerto hasta el siglo II E.C. El nombre rabe es Bahr Lut, "Mar de Lot".  Agua. El agua del mar Salado es nica en el sentido de que es unas nueve veces ms salada que la de los ocanos. El mar Salado no tiene ninguna salida, de modo que la mayor parte del agua que le llega se evapora debido al intenso calor, y deja tras de s ms sales minerales. La concentracin de sal es tal que ningn pez, ni siquiera las variedades de agua salada, puede vivir en l; los pocos peces que hay en la zona salobre, la zona donde el agua dulce se mezcla con el agua salada, mueren si son arrastrados al mar. Este hecho a?ade significado a la referencia de Ezequiel a un torrente que flua del templo de Jehov hasta el "mar oriental" y sanaba su parte superior, de manera que haba una abundancia de peces, como en el mar Mediterrneo, y poda sostener un prspero comercio pesquero. (Eze 47:8-10, 18.) La gran densidad del agua hace que los objetos floten con facilidad y contribuye a la mar llana, pues las brisas ligeras no pueden agitar el agua.    Sodoma y Gomorra. Por lo general se cree que Sodoma y Gomorra estaban situadas cerca del extremo S. del mar Salado. Los reyes de esas ciudades estaban entre los que guerrearon en "la llanura baja de Sidim, es decir, el mar Salado", lo que da a entender que la llanura baja de Sidim lleg a quedar cubierta por el mar Salado. (G 14:3.) La regin de Sodoma y Gomorra donde Lot se estableci estaba 'bien regada, como el jardn de Jehov'. (G 13:10-12.) Incluso hoy en da hay abundante vegetacin en la llanura situada a lo largo de la costa sudoriental, y se puede cultivar trigo, cebada, dtiles y vides. Las grandes cantidades de betn y sal que se encuentran especialmente en esta zona meridional tambin encajan con el relato bblico de Sodoma y Gomorra. (G 14:10; 19:24-26.)|`|005ce9bc604d1ed82e1cc4a832600b3faa	por que esta muerto|`|91f3df7df18052499c8af52294aade8baa	mar muerto  su verdadero nombre: IAM HAMELAJ, del hebreo:  aguas de sal  debido a su alta proporcion de sal en agua, no es posible la vida en el|`|AA11411121	Porque es tan tan salado que ningn pez puede vivir en esa agua.|`|0f07c1ec0d4da4bbf610f0f7536f28e3aa	Se sigue llamando as, se dice mar Muerto porque la gran salinidad de sus aguas impide que haya peces u otras especies.|`|2aa5bce176a61626a265ab1b7a4dd740aa	contiene 6 veces ms porcentaje de sal que cualquier mar, la vida alli, subacuatica es imposible, es de color casi transparente, como vidrio, y si te sumerges flotas irremediablemente|`|33315295bf0d2502d7154fc233f96a23aa	por la gran cantidad de sal que contiene.|`|b4ea085f3747bcbacb62d06ef7bddc6caa	Porque su concentracion de sal es tan alta que ninguna forma de vida puede vivir en el.|`|4059b499162cf66b3243127e21f2dac2aa	porque no alberga vida en el por la gran cantidad de sal en sus aguas!|`|3642b31d6c2b974244a135f84f073aceaa	Se le llama mar muerto aunque sea un lago por que sus aguas son mucho mas saladas que las del resto de los mares y que por eso no tiene ningun ser vivo en sus aguas solo uno que otro que otro microbio.

Pero, por otra parte, debe tener una relacion con todas ellas, porque todas las religiones fomentan el amor.    Escuche por ahi algo sobre la reencarnacion en las otras religiones, cosa que la religion catolica no tiene. En realidad, se que existen fragmentos de la biblia sobre la reencarnacion, algunos fueron quitados, pero otros persistieron por ser mas leves. Eso sucedio en los principios de la iglesia catolica, cuando muchas personas se suicidaban en calidad de martires creyendo que reencarnarian, y la iglesia debio detener eso. Por esa razon "dejaron de creer" en la reencarnacion.  Es en serio, puedo equivocarme en un par de datos, pero no estoy errada. Si quieren saber mas informense con alguna fuente mejor. Esto lo escuche en el History Channel, pero tmb lo lei en un libro de un psiquiatra.    Saludos!    PD: no se peleen, yo creo que no hay que decidir que religion es la mejor, la mas emocionante, la mas real, que profeta es el que tenia razon... si lo mas importante es que todos hablaron sobre el amor, la vida, el respeto, etc. Asi, que hay que ser tolerantes con las religiones, porque todos somos iguales!|`|c7b9040ad05f67d31e67f6862d803a0caa	Claro que si, la que lleva uno adentro y se apoya uno en ella.  No hay que confundir religion con iglesia, la iglesia la constituyen los hombres y ya saben, el hombre es imperfecto y le da en la torre a todo, pero la religion, eso ya es otra historia, tu te puedes hacer de tu propia religion siempre y cuando se crea en algo y tener fe.
iYS6syrGaa	Del Corn ninguno de nosotros est capacitado para interpretarlo porque para eso pasan hombres toda su vida estudinbdolo y ni as acaban, as que el que quiera ponerse a leer el Corn y sacar sus propias conclusiones obviamente encontrar errores, ya que nuestro sentido comn no es suficiente para hacer este tipo de investigacin.    Y para el que le gusten los nmero les dejar este estudio que se llama: El Milagro Nmero del Sagrado Corn.    Si segn tu cualquiera puede escribir un libro como este, a ver dime si lo puedes hacer con tanta precisin (y no me digas que el Profeta Muhammad -la paz sea con l- lo escribi porque l era analfabeta, ni escribir saba as que no pudo hacer tan maravillosa obra, ni l ni ningn ser humano)    SE RETA A CUALQUIERA que intente encontrar un error, JAMS lo lograrn, muchos cientficos han querido hacerlo, pero no han podido, todo tiene su por qu y una paginita barata como la que pusieron arriba no es vlida ante este milagro.    El milagro numrico en el sagrado CORN es un tema efectivamente admirable.     Han empezado los sabios musulmanes, como Dr. Rashad Khalifa, el Profesor Abderrazzaq Nufal, y otros, a estudiar el milagro numrico en el sagrado CORN recientemente: Menos de 20 a?os, y si no hubieran existido las maquinas estadsticas y los ordenadores no se habra podido estudiar y concluir este milagro numrico admirable.     Este milagro es establecido de los nmeros, y los nmeros hablan de sus mismo, as no hay comprobante para rechazar este milagro, porque los nmeros comprueban que el sagrado CORN sin duda es palabra de DIOS, y nos ha llegado intacto sin ninguna alteracin ni a?adido ni defecto. Porque decrecer una letra o una sola palabra o a?adirla, desarregla todo el orden numrico del CORN.     Ahora les presento algunos milagros numricos en el sagrado CORN:     En el CORN hay un equilibrio numrico sorprendente, por ejemplo la palabra 'SHAHR' (MES) se mencion en el Corn 12 veces como el nmero de los meses del a?o; la palabra 'YAWM' (DA) en singular se mencion en el CORN 365 veces como el nmero de los das del a?o; la palabra 'AYYAM'(DAS) en plural se mencion en el Corn 30 veces como el nmero de los das del mes.     En el caso de la palabra y su antnimo, encontramos en el Corn un equilibrio maravilloso. Mirando la palabra escrita en rabe y su significado en castellano y el nmero de repeticin en el sagrado CORN en estos cuadros abajo:     ' LA PALABRA' (SU SIGNIFICADO)    'AL HAYAT' ( LA VIDA) 145 VECES   'AL MAWT' (LA MUERTE) 145 VECES     'ADDUNYA' (LA VIDA TERRENAL) 115 VECES   'AKHERA' (ULTRATUMBA) 115 VECES     'MALAEKA' (LOS NGELES) 88 VECES   'SHAYATIN' ( LOS DIABLOS) 88 VECES     'ARRAJUL' (EL HOMBRE) 24 VECES   'AL MAR'A' (LA MUJER ) 24 VECES     'ARRAGHBA' (EL DESEO) 8 VECES   'ARRAHBA' (EL TEMOR) 8 VECES     'ASSALIHAT' (LOS HECHOS BUENOS) 167 VECES   'ASSAYYI'AT (LOS HECHOS MALOS) 167 VECES     'AL LAYL' (LA NOCHE) 88 VECES   'ANNAHAR' (DE DIA) 88 VECES     'ANNAFAA' (BENEFICIO) 50 VECES   'AL FASAD' (CORRUPCIN) 50 VECES     Acerca del campo semntico o palabras relacionadas encontramos en el CORN otro fenmeno sorprendente:     'LA PALABRA' (SU SIGNIFICADO)    'ANNAS' (GENTE) 368 VECES   'RUSUL' (ENVIADOS) 368 VECES     'AL MOSIBA' (ADVERSIDAD) 75 VECES   'SHUKR' (AGRADECIMIENTO) 75 VECES     'AL JAHR' (EN PUBLICO) 16 VECES   'ALANYA' (NOTORIEDAD) 16 VECES     'MUJAMMAD' (MUJAMMAD) 4 VECES   'SARI ' A' ( LA LEY ) 4 VECES     'AL AQL' ( EL CEREBRO) 49 VECES   'ANNUR' ( LA LUZ) 49 VECES     'AL LISAN' (LA LENGUA) 25 VECES   'AL MAU' IDA' (SERMN) 25 VECES     'ASSIHR' (LA MAGIA) 60 VECES   'FITNA' (FASCINACIN) 60 VECES     'ASHSHIDDA' (APRETURA) 114 VECES   'SABR' (PACIENCIA) 114 VECES     'QUL' (DI) 332 VECES   'QALU' (DIJERON) 332 VECES     EL PORCENTAJE DE LAS AGUAS Y TIERRAS EN NUESTRO PLANETA     La palabra ' BAHR' (MAR O AGUA) mencion en el sagrado CORN 32 veces y la palabra ' BARR' (TIERRA) se menciono en el CORN 13 veces.     *NOTA:     Si sumamos el nmero de repeticin de la palabra (MAR) con el nmero de repeticin de la palabra ' BARR' (TIERRA) conseguimos 45.     ('MAR': 32 + 'TIERRA': 13 = 45)     Ahora permtanos hacer algunos clculos:     1) Para encontrar el porcentaje de la palabra ( MAR ) necesitamos hacer una ecuacin:     El TOTAL de las palabras 'MAR' (DIVIDIR) por el TOTAL de las palabras 'TIERRA y MAR' (MULTIPLICAR) por 100 %:     * 32 (DIVIDIR POR) 45 (MULTIPLICAR POR) 100% = 71,1111%   2) Para encontrar el porcentaje de la palabra (TIERRA) necesitamos hacer otra ecuacin:     El TOTAL de las palabras ' MAR' (DIVIDIR) por el TOTAL de las palabras ' TIERRA y MAR ' (MULTIPLICAR) por 100%.     *13 (DIVIDIR POR) 45 (MULTIPLICAR POR) 100% = 28,8888%   As despus de esta simple ecuacin, hemos conseguido este milagroso resultado que esta en el CORN desde 1400 a?os, porque la ciencia moderna ha descubierto que:     EL PORCENTAJE DE AGUAS EN NUESTRO PLANETA ES = 71,1111%     EL PORCENTAJE DE TIERRAS EN NUESTRO PLANETA ES = 28,8888%     Estos son unos peque?os ejemplos donde se muestran asombrosos e inexplicables milagros numricos.   mas :     El milagro numrico del Corn     El milagro eterno del Profeta del Islam lo constituye el Co|`|AA11411121	El Corn declara abiertamente ser perfecto. El Corn declara ser preservado en unas Tablas, que por estar escrito con una T mayscula, tiende a sugerir que esta Tabla se encuentra en el cielo. Ms an, de acuerdo con la tradicin en el Hadit, esta Tabla se encuentra en el cielo.       "?S es un Corn glorioso, en una Tabla bien guardada!" (Sura 85:21-22)     Si el Corn es un libro perfecto de parte de Al, entonces ?no debera haber contradicciones en l!     Lo ms esperado es que los musulmanes nieguen que exista algn error en el Corn, sin embargo, los hay.     Primero definamos a lo que nos referimos cuando nos referimos a que existen contradicciones. Cuando una declaracin sobre un tema excluye la posibilidad de otra es una contradiccin. Por ejemplo, el Sura 19:67, declara que el hombre fue creado de la nada. Pero en el Sura 15:26, el hombre se dice que fue creado a partir del barro. Eso representa una contradiccin en el sentido de que si el Barro ES algo, entonces el hombre no fue creado de la nada, sino del barro.     Todas las citas son tomadas de esta versin del Corn.     ?De qu fuimos creados   de la tierra, del polvo, del barro, de una gota de sangre, de una gota de esperma?   Conclusin. ?Se imaginan ustedes que los que defendemos la posicin Creacionista desde el punto de vista cientfico tuviramos que defender una amalgama de versiones sobre la forma en la que la creacin del hombre sucedi? ?Los evolucionistas nos hubieran hecho picadillo!

En el nombre de Dios, El Graciabilsimo, El Misericordiossimo      El discurso es en primera persona; y en numerosos puntos. Dios manda a Muhammad dirigirse a la gente diciendo: 'Di' (Qul en rabe); de hecho; este comando aparece ms de 332 veces en el Corn3. Otros imperativos como: 'Proclama', 'Recita', 'Glorifica a tu Se?or'  'Pstrate' y muchos otros imperativos han sido tambin usados4. Aunque afirmar que el Corn es una revelacin divina ya es una negacin de cualquier autora humana; el Corn tambin hace la afirmacin categrica de que ningn ser humano  genio puede haberlo producido5:      Di: Aunque los humanos y los genios se reunieran para producir algo semejante a este Corn, jams haran nado parecido, aunque se ayudasen mutuamente.           Aparte de la afirmacin de que el Corn es una revelacin divina, ms la enftica negacin de algn origen humano; el Corn mismo proporciona el mtodo que servir para probar su falsedad y refutarlo6:      Y si dudis de lo que hemos revelado a nuestro siervo componed una sura semejante a ste, e implorad para ello a vuestros dolos en vez de Dios, si sois sinceros. Pero si no lo hacis - y ciertamente no podris hacerlo -, temed pues, el fuego infernal cuyo pasto son los idlatras y los dolos; es fuego que est destinado para los incrdulos.      Y en respuesta a la acusacin de que Muhammad era el autor del Corn, a ste se le manda decir:7            Diles: No me incumbe modificarlo por mi propia voluntad; solo me atengo a lo que me ha sido revelado, porque temo el castigo del da aciago, si desobedezco a mi Se?or.         Atraves de los tiempos este ha seguido intacto no ha sufrido modificacion alguna por el hombre como los libros anteriores revelados a otros profetas( moises,abraham,Jesus, la paz sea con ellos) estos han sufrido ya modificaciones cada vez pasa el tiempo,    Antes de poder hablar sobre una religion deben saber de esta , deben aprender de esta,  este sito que han recomendado ....antesdelfin no hacen mas que  echarle tierra al islam busacndo contradicciones en el sagrado coran y otros articulos intentando desviar y extraviar mas ...porque no mejor intenatn leer, que es islam, que es un muslman, que es el coran, como fue revelado, quien lo revelo, acerquense a los creyentes que realmente puedan explicarles no alos incredulos...antes de hacer cualquier comentario estan invitados a estos sitios que realmente podran contestar a sus dudas....saludos  Alguien mensiono a jesus como hijo de dios, pues no es asi por una sencilla razon: dios es uno, eterno, creador de todo cuanto existe, no engendra y no hay nada que se le compare.  Jesus paz y bendiciones es el ungido hijo de Maria, un profeta anterior a mohammad saw que ocupa un lugar muy importante a el le fue revelado el evangelio.    Dios les bendiga y les pueda orientar en el camino, ameen!
e1a1f381a6a593980ed750f67bf70f11aa	Su nombre es Pu Tai y es el dios de la riqueza y de la fortuna. Su origen se encuentra en una figura del budismo hindu, el buda Amithaba. El nombre Amithaba significa en snscrito "Luz infinita". Este personaje, gracil y delgado, de color rojo, es el buda (ser iluminado) del oeste. Posee un reino fantstico, paradisiaco, llamado Sukhavati. Su nombre era invocado en forma continua (mantra) y eso permita, al morir, reencarnar en su reino, donde se vivia una existencia feliz consagrada al perfeccionamiento espiritual para, tras una existencia prolongada y gozosa, volver a la tierra bajo forma humana y, entonces s, alcanzar la iluminacin, que es el estado en el que se trasciende todo dolor.   Al trasladarse el culto de Amithaba de la India a China, el nombre de este buda de la luz infinita, se convirti en Ami To Fo. Ami To Fo es el protector del monasterio Shao Lin y el protector del Kun Fu.   Sin embargo, al difundirse el budismo fuera de los monasterios, los campesinos chinos, siempre hambrientos y miserables, imaginaron un paraiso lleno de comida, donde podan saciar su hambre y concibieron a una especie de Ami To Fo obeso y risue?o. Le llamaron Pu Tai (en ocasions tambin se le llama Go Tan) y se convirit en el dios de la riqueza.  Los occidentales e incluso algunos chinos carentes de educacin tienden a confundir al buda Siddharta Gautama, un asceta hindu que alcanz la iluminacin, con Pu Tai.

Esta declaracin, aunque tiene algo de verdad, debe ser clarificada para evitar serios errores doctrinales. Ciertamente Dios es amor infinito y nos cre para que amemos. Jess ense?a sobre los Mandamientos de Dios:    ?El primero es: Escucha, Israel: El Se?or, nuestro Dios, es el nico Se?or, amars al Se?or, tu Dios, con todo tu corazn, con toda tu alma, con toda tu mente y con todas tus fuerzas. El segundo es: Amars a tu prjimo como a ti mismo. No existe otro mandamiento mayor que stos.? (Mc 12:29-31)    Pero para llegar al amor perfecto es necesario comprender el don del "temor de Dios".  No se trata de tenerle miedo a Dios sino de temer ofenderle. El temor de que hablamos no es el que paraliza y lleva al desespero sino que es un temor que nos mueve a renunciar al pecado y recurrir a Dios. Tememos al realizar nuestra propia debilidad y que con facilidad podemos caer en pecado mortal y condenarnos. San Agustn deca "ama y haz lo que quieras" pero por su propia experiencia tambin   escribi ampliamente sobre la necesidad del temor como motivo para el arrepentimiento (5) El temor, ense?a San Agustn, lleva al dolor del corazn por el pecado. "Compunctus corde non solet dici nisi stimulus peccatorum in dolore penitendi"(6).    Los buenos padres no solo hablan de amor sino que tambin ayudan a sus hijos a comprender los peligros. Y, como saben que la comprensin de los peque?os es muy limitada, inculcan un sano temor al castigo. Se trata del sano temor, la justa medicina. No el temor excesivo que quita la confianza y traumatiza. Recordemos que Dios es el Padre perfecto, modelo de todo padre. El sano temor es parte de su pedagoga divina para que nos mantengamos en guardia contra el grave peligro que acecha a todo hombre en la batalla espiritual contra el mundo, la carne y el demonio    Si somos humildes y realistas sobre nuestra tendencia al pecado, comprendemos que nuestro amor no siempre es perfecto. Somos ni?os ante Dios. Por eso, tener conciencia de las consecuencias del pecado y tenerle un sano temor nos ayuda a ser sobrios y no racionalizar el pecado, ni pretender que no ofende a Dios.|`|a92575cf390de3d6ec695579b70e1837aa	Respeto....!!!

Primero debemos entende que la sabiduria de la que la Biblia habla quiere decir vivir y pensar de acuerdo con la verdad, los caminos y el designio de Dios.  Significa abordar la vida toda desde el punto de vista de Dios, creyendo que todo lo que Dios dice es fiel y recto, y la unica forma digna por la cual vivir.  La ganancia de sabiduria es mucho mejor que poseer plata y oro.  La alcanzan solo quienbes la buscan mediante una adecuado relacion con Dios y un dirigente estudio de su Palabra.  Cristo, de quien en Nuevo Testamento dice que es la suprema sabiduria de Dios, ense?a a los creyentes que ellos obtienen sabiduria al guardar Su Palabra, al permitir que sus palabras permanescan en ellos, y al rendir su mente y corazon al Espiritu Santo que esta en ellos.    EL TEMOR A JEHOVA.  Un temor reverente del poder, la majestad y la santidad de Dios produce en los creyentes un temor santo de quebrantar su voluntad revelada.  Tal reverencia es esencial para tener un corazon sabio.  El Nuevo Testamento indica que el sincero temor del Se?or en el corazon ira acompa?ado del consuelo del Espiritu Santo.|`|e06619323ecbcb36c68f1263f7bf3f54aa	Temor a ofenderlo o a desobedecerlo u obrar mal, an cuando no es con intencin.|`|67fbb316a1e23f419bbaf56b33a26a06aa	Que tal a todos, buen dia!

Well, if that's true, and our world is riddled with problems and difficulties, then we can't give up. we need to find our common ground as humans and strive incessantly to build a better world!    I think we common people should start volunteering in our own communities. We should send money to credible charities helping people abroad. Maybe we could travel and volunteer our efforts elsewhere on occasion.    We should offer the world our smiles, cheerfulness and goodwill. We should never stop working for the good and stay positive. There is a solution.    Politicians could do little things to facilitate people coming together as a nation and as a world. If we all work together then nothing can stop us.    You are joking about the war, poverty and greed n stuff? Right?  If not, I think I'm going to be sick!|`|9fa1adb1c8a5e488f13a34915c1381ceaa	Utopia is not an option.

mOZMMRkpaa	Good question ! About the inverted psychology I mean. Yes he, Hitler was indeed a sexual pervert. I don't see your question inferring that " gays are perverts " but some obviously have that immediate attachment of guilt or self doubt, like one of your answering members. Now that raises a new question for everyone interested !  Don't some people tempt controversy ?

These were the ancestors of the Germanic tribes that populated the general geographic area of 1933 Germany. The traits were tall, strong men of blond hair and blue eyes and women appropriately fertile to repopulate this race throughout the land.  Obviously Jews could not do this (though his hatred of them was multi-faceted.)  Catholics and most other strong religions of the time would not follow his whims of "breeding" neo-Aryans like cattle, so he hated them for their resistance and Fidelity to higher law than himself. Poles were another mixed-breed he would get to in 1939. Gypsies and other independent unfortunates would not conform to his will. Homosexuals could not reproduce at all, not even to provide basic infantry as cannon fodder. They not only could not reproduce, but their same-sex proclivities were unnatural under the eugenics program. They befouled the gene pool and fell under the "final solution." Yes, he detested them.  While Hitler did have a single testicle (monorchism), this led to no complications in virility, nor did it predispose him to homosexuality. He would have, again, considered homosexuals as a drain on society and of no use to the gene pool. He was a hypocrite, along with his more serious flaws, and ignored the many members of the high command who were themselves homosexuals and/or pedophiles. They served a useful function in advancing his Third Reich.  In addition to his despising homosexuals for the reasons given, he did himself maintain relationships with women. One of his last acts in the Berlin bunker in 1945 was to marry Eva Braun before they were shot. What a swell guy.|`|TbNInfUGaa	he was a fascist (in other words, a right-wing extremist - imagine the bnp but much, much worse).

So, if you were a short, dark haired man with no children then....hey, wait a minute!    Seriously though, yes, Hitler was against gay people and for that matter, ANYONE who wasn't within that very tight margin of 'the supreme race'. True, Hitler was, by some accounts, sexually depraved (his relish of women's bowel movements has been noted), but this was a separate issue to homosexuality being against the regime. Besides, I should think that amongst Hitler's numerous sins, blatant hypocracy might be one of them.|`|4798eafe385a2dd3a58c247394a4ab81aa	Hitler was anti everything, and he particularly hated those that were mentally handicapped, homosexuals, and Jews, he was personally a sexual pervert himself behind closed doors, he really did want to create a perfect German that was one of his goals, If he had won he would have committed world genocide, and you and I would not be talking on YA right now.

129a3b17aac3ba0abf85b4a5074ba3edaa	Every religious Dispensation has a Spring, Summer, Fall and Winter. In the springtime, the religion is small and persecuted. Gradually, pure hearted people accept the Faith and help to spread its teachings. Eventually, a civilization develops which is based on the teachings of the Founder of the Faith, in this case Jesus. This is the spiritual summer-time of the religion. Eventually, the religion becomes entrenched in ecclesiasticism, man-made dogmas and the spirit of the religion dies. Only the forms, dogmas, institutions, priests remain. By the 7th century, Christianity was in the Dark Ages. It has fallen from its glory and splendour and the time was ripe for the appearance of a new Manifestation of God. Jesus had promised that the Comforter would come, the Spirit of Truth who would testify of Jesus and renew the Faith of God. This Comforter was Muhammad. Only by turning unto Muhammad and accepting Him and the Qur'an could Christian Europe have truly become a peaceful, spiritual society. Unfortunately, they did not accept Islam and history shows the results of their failure: wars, conflict, divisions, etc.|`|96cd1744acaf1e87751ac1ec9c729b19aa	Because God told them to.

The fact is, the English have virtually criminalised their own culture and heritage.     They condemn anything English and yet promote and cheer for every other culture.

I ran into the same problem you're having with my work pants, which are tight but don't have the strength to hold everything back themselves. I work back at a dock, so I do a lot of moving around also that could cause everything to come loose. I wear 2 pairs of tight, bikini-cut panties. It's enough to hold everything back and in place for an 8 hours shift in a fast-paced, physical environment. Just tuck the testicles back in and move the penis back into place, then pull up the first pair of panties while holding everything in place. Then pull up the second pair and make sure the lines match so that if your panty line shows only 1 shows. If that's not enough for ya, then go out and buy a gaff for crossdressers/transsexuals that's made to hold everything back.|`|f7fe854f34875855e7bddc879f7c8ff9aa	It's been an hour since you asked this and I was wondering if you had figured it out yet.

In the top half divide it in two, in the bottom half divide it in three. Your task is to draw a continuous line that crosses each line segment exactly once. You can't pick up you pencil or retrace your line.|`|JYTePNX6aa	Yes it is.    Start at the bottom line.  Go from left to right.   At the right, hook back straight to the middle.  Halfway there, hook back to the bottom left line you have.  Now you should have a line & triangle shape so far.    Hook straight up & stop.  Hook down towards the middle & stop.  Hook back up to where there would be a line & stop.  You now have a bottom with triangle, left side, & top triangle shape with no top line.    Hook straight down to connect to the bottom line to close in the side. Now your square with an x is finished except for the top line.    Now curve from the bottom in a circular shape back to the top left line, then straight across.    The last part involves drawing a half-circle to loop back to the square top so that you don't redraw any lines, but it IS possible|`|AA11360519	It can be done if you use more than one circle and square|`|AA11545211	yea its easy took me a while though
3734b5f7e7c27b91d0268c00d9e7ed41aa	so your mom browbeats you?  It sounds as if, you are on your way to becoming responsible for your own take on what to believe, good for you!  I, after many years of researching the evidence, came to the conclusion that the doctrine of the lutheran church is seriously flawed, and left that church. as the lutherans are as close as one can get to being catholic, i can only hope that you will study the origins of the doctrines of the catholic church.    Some places to look?   Get a book, called religions in america by leo rosten. In it you will find a side by side comparison of the teachings of the major religions in america, and the support, or lack thereof, from the bible.  You will be quite astonished to see how much of what many religions teach, have absolutely no source from the bible, but rather have their origins in either paganism or traditions added 100s of years after Jesus returned to heaven!    In the bible, you will also not find these words:trinity, rapture, or a doctrine of immortal souls.  Good luck to you!|`|031f82ea0f3e8ca118b8c64da4c2d9d5aa	Tell her "At least someone is taking an interest in my spiritual development without being judgmental".    ~Morg~|`|9fa1adb1c8a5e488f13a34915c1381ceaa	Just move out.|`|8c672d24114a86bbf23f9c57d2161c62aa	I always thought it was illogical to have to pray through a saint.....but if Catholics want to, that's their choice.  I think your mom is just confused; I don't know what else to say.|`|4ea312759f0c31e32f205d5717b6d39faa	First, next time ask her if Satan is getting time and a half wages for going into overtime.     Second, you pray only to Jesus, not to any other human being. Her soul is in serious jeopardy!|`|AA11707311	Honor your Father and Mother seems to be your problem. Maybe you should research the Ten Commandments and get back to us before you lecture on theology.|`|vKaHmpxQaa	i pray to God directly Mary was just the carrier of Jesus not JESUS. yes she was a wonderful woman but she was not the one who died for us. I pray to Jesus when i have problems in my life i know he can help me and he has.|`|b9b0ee4dee3513860da35d94752971f1aa	it could cause me to lose my patience - or leave home!
AA10688069	If all you want is a one night stand, make that clear in the pickup line.  "Hi, you look good for a lay but I never want to see you again after that, is that okay with you?"  This way you both know what you are getting into.|`|VVSEue6Maa	I'm heading to Vietnam tomorrow.    Or "Nice shoes - wanna fvck?"|`|03c3881fd24bfb93aa59a952408c38d7aa	Do you want to hook up?|`|9fa1adb1c8a5e488f13a34915c1381ceaa	Nice boots. Wanna fvck?
AA11456982	They still thought the world was flat and Columbus was looked at as a mad man for thinking that the world was round.  He wasn't even trying to get to the Americas, he thought it would be a faster trade route to sail to the Far East than going by land.|`|9fa1adb1c8a5e488f13a34915c1381ceaa	Because the Vikings had gotten there 500 years earlier. Thats the smart@ss answer because I'm proud of my Viking blood. LOL    But seriously, in 1492 England was in the midst of a continuing war with France, so the motivation and resources just weren't there.|`|fbOBRz5Xaa	They had a good trading system in place.  Portugal, however, was separated from the rest of the world, and they needed to trade.  Therefore, they had more inspiration to invest in going overseas.

MRu49Obiaa	Don't say "You're the Bomb" OR "You Rock the House"....please. It depends on how old the person is and if it's a boy or girl. Compare them to someone that they idolize. I'll tell my niece that she sings just like Hannah Montana and she reacts more to that than when I say "Good Job". No matter what, everyone loves to be complimented and any acknowledgment will make them feel special.|`|48c286b828494072a0a06f4f8f0b74bcaa	How about "Way to go"?|`|2b48276b9853c62d36478108dff9629baa	A compliment like "you da bomb" is usually used around young teenagers up to and including mid to late twenty somethings, I like the previous guy's answer of "you rock", that's cool man.................  :0)      PEACE|`|4MHtp7HOaa	I think that your compliment is totally up to you. Anything positive would drive and motivate anyone. You could tell them, "Keep up the good work!" or "Someday, you're hard work will definitely pay off for you!"|`|9fa1adb1c8a5e488f13a34915c1381ceaa	Just 'you rock' would be good.|`|30fa959a822a34981976dd54e8d2cd23aa	Keep it simple & sincere.  If it is in regards to someone having done a good job, just say, "Thanks so much - you did a really nice job".|`|AA12316977	I'm impressed - great job! You're the best.
