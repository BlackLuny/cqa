LGd4fUyPaa	Yo creo que ni la madre de Rosello cree en su inocencia y no lo digo por nada de política pero a la verdad que hay que estar como enamorado (bruto, ciego, sordo y mudo) de el para no ver las cosas con la claridad que están. Lastima que Cho no lo conoció por allá por Virginia de seguro los 32 se hubieran salvado. Es difícil entender como alguien que ha hecho tanto da?o a su pueblo pueda dormir en las noches y aun querer continuar haciéndolo. <br>  <br>  Creo que no tiene que ver con que seamos del PPD, PNP o PIP, cuando alguien da?a a nuestro pueblo nos tenemos que unir y luchar por nosotros mismos. Conozco a alguien que era adoración con el hasta que una familiar murió de VIH en momentos que se robaban lo que le pudo haber otorgado varios a?os mas de vida y para colmo su  esposo perdió su trabajo en la PRTC cuando Rosello la vendió. Si ese hombre vuelve al poder esconderé hasta mi ropa interior no sea que a el o a alguno de sus amigos les interese y me los lleven o que a Rosello no le piense que son lo que deba usar y me insulte, pisotee o difame como dices tú, solo por no estar de acuerdo conmigo. Y me da muchísima lastima que cuando ese demente que parece hermano del "jesucristo ponce?o"  hizo todo lo que hizo Puerto Rico no grito.|`|4CverYYgaa	ERES UN  POPULAR REVENTAO  MEJOR PREGUNTA CUANDO VAN ARRESTAR A ANIBAL ACEVEDO VILA<br>  QUE MUCHAS COSITAS QUE HACE A ESPALDAS DEL PUEBLO .

El turismo propiamente dicho, nace en el siglo XIX, como una consecuencia de la Revolución Industrial, con desplazamientos cuya intencion principal es el ocio, descanso, cultura, salud, negocios o relaciones familiares.

Sicuramente però New York è la città più importante dell'intera nazione per diversi motivi. Il principale è che quando gli italiani erano emigranti, così come altri popoli europei, per accedere agli Stati Uniti, potenza economica di allora e di oggi, dovevano obbligatoriamente passare per Ellis Islan, che si trova nella Baia a nord della città. Alcuni, soprattutto chi non aveva parenti da raggiungere nella zona interna del paese, si sono fermati proprio lì, dando vita a una città che è formata soprattutto da immigrati. Infatti molte persone  appartenenti ad una stessa cultura, hanno creato dei quartieri: basta pensare a Little Italy, Chinatown, Harlem... In una città che si era così formata, quindi, era impensabile che non ci fossero edifici e monumenti, palazzi e grattacieli interessanti, belli e destinati a diventare famosi. Le Twin Towers, la Fifth Avenue, la Statua della Libertà (creata dall'autore della Tour Eiffel di Parigi), e tante altre belle cose. New York City è meta di molti viaggiatori, nonchè una delle capitali della moda, della vita notturna, di riviste note in tutto il mondo. Da piccolo credevo che fosse la capitale degli Stati Uniti. <br>  In fine ti dico: Secondo me sì, è la città più bella, nonchè il mio sogno.|`|VSppqj4kaa	New York è uno stato.<br>  E' come dire che la città piu' bella dell'Europa è Italia.<br>  Secondo me comunque non è New York City.<br>  Si, è bellissima, ma preferisco San Diego, piu' piccola, ci si diverte di brutto e il clima è da Dio.<br>  Peccato io stia nello stato del Rhode Island, dove fa un freddo porco.|`|YJCt5zqoaa	Dipende.... a me piace!<br>  ma anche Las Vegas o Orlando o Miami o Dallas sono belle!|`|c5a3504f7ba4ef578608ff29663ad805aa	PER RISPONDERE A QUESTA DOMANDA BISOGNEREBBE AVERLE GIRATE TUTTE LE CITTà DEGLI STATES!<br>  NEW YORK SARà SICURAMENTE BELLISSIMA MA DA QUI A DIRE CHE è LA PIù BELLA NON SAPREI...

A volte hanno anche una piccola vita che serve ad impostare il giusto voltaggio. Attenzione però al ritrno in Europa, se non rimetti la vitina su 240 volt ti si brucia non appena metti la spina e lo accendi.<br>  Ciò vale anche per qualsiasi altro apparecchio elettrico, negli USA c'è una tensione più bassa di circarsonale in quanto non sono riuscito a fare funzionare in Italia u 110-120 volts, oltre ad uno spinotto differente.<br>  Dovrai quindi comperare, in Italia, un semplice adattotore (alla coop sotto casa mia costa 1 euro circa ) - che però NON modifica la tensione. Se i tuoi apparecchi quindi possono sopportare anche i 110 volts funzioneranno, altrimenti dovrai munirti di un trasformatore apposito.<br>  Codesti trasformatori non sono molto grandi e sono anche relativamente economici, tuttavia si possono uttlizzare per apparecchi di una potenza massima fino ai 60 watt circa. Per apparecchi che richiedono potenze superiori ci vogliono altri trasformatori, ben più grossi e molto più costosi (quindi non vale la pena portarseli dietro). A volte si trovano sempre dei piccoli trasformatori economici, che sopportano potenze fino ai 1600 watts - possono tuttavia essere uttilizzati soltanto per asciugacapelli, e pochi altri apparecchi che richiedono una corrente non stabilizzata, quindi NON usarli per computer e altri apparecchi elettronici. <br>  Un buon trasformatore di corrente stabilizzata di potenza massima ad esempio di 'soli' 200 o 400 watts, puo pesare anche un paio di kg. e costare quasi 100 euro!!<br>  Te lo dico per esperienza personale.<br>  <br>  Per quanto riguardo i farmaci:<br>  Richiedi al tuo medico tutti i farmaci con prescrizione che devi portarti dietro.<br>  Per quanto riguarda i farmaci da banco, quelli senza obbligo di ricetta, per intenderci, come aspirina, altri antidolorifici ecc... è assolutamente inutile portarseli dietro dall'Italia - in america sono disponibili ovunque, se ne trovano persino dai benzinai, e nei negozi 'tutto a un dollaro' costano molto meno che in Italia e sono anche molto più numerosi comprendnedo anche antistaminici, farmaci per il sonno, il tutto spesso a prezzi quasi ridicoli (400 compresse di difenidramina, un antistaminico di prima generazione e uttilizzato come sonnifero, 5 o 6 dollari da Costco).<br>  <br>  Le tua paure sono giustificate, è normale quando si va in un posto lontano e nuovo, vedrai che ti ambienterai presto - anche se la vita li sarà molto diversa.|`|e380b92b0815e50596d23a27843cc25caa	take it easy!!!!!!!! stai tranquilla. dovresti essere eccitata per l'esperienza, non nel panico. <br>  1 mese a new york? beata te!!! ma vai li per imparare la lingua o solo per divertimento?<br>  <br>  1. vai in un negozio e spieghi al commesso che devi andare a ny. di darà quello giusto. cmq dovrebbe essere adattatore+trasformatore insieme. è una scatolina.<br>  <br>  2. La mancanza di casa?vai un internet cafè e manda delle mail. <br>  se i tuoi amici fanno delle cose non sei obbligata a stare per forza con loro. puoi startene semplicemente nel vostro alloggio o se di giorno andartene in un parco, un museo a fare quello che ti pare.<br>  se stai male e ti serve un medico chiama il consolato italiano. <br>   ITALIAN CONSULATE in NY  <br>  ADDRESS  SERVICES  <br>  690, Park Avenue <br>  New York, NY 10021<br>  tel: +1 (212) 439-8600 <br>  fax: +1 (212) 249-4945 <br>  io anni fa, ero a londra e il mio inglese era pessimo.stavo male ed ho chiamato l'ambasciata. in  2 minuti mi hanno dato il nr ed indirizzo. <br>  ogni volta che vado all'estero i riferimenti italiani me li annoto sempre. <br>  <br>  vai e goditi questa esperienza. verrei volentieri con te.<br>  <br>  l'unico consiglio che ti do è quello di mostrarti sicura nel passo qua|`|Q4Ze0Bojaa	Nooooo stai tranquilla!<br>  Goditi il tuo bel viaggio, non aver paura :)))<br>  Allora per l'adattatore, vai da un Radio Shack e porta il phon e fatti dare il trasformatore. Costano dai 2 ai 10 dollari.<br>  Sentirai la mancanza della tua famiglia e del tuo ragazzo ma un mese volera' , sii serena e goditi questa bella vacanza. <br>  Le medicine le vendono al CVS, un drugstore che si trova ad ogni due block (isolati), ce ne sono a bizzeffe, ma i piu' comuni per i dolori sono tylenol e aleve. <br>  Ah e se non vuoi andare ai pub e discoteche non ci andare... stai tranquilla, non aver paura a dire no, ma comunque divertiti che manhattan pure farti una passeggiata la sera e' divertente.|`|Ypl4Rrryaa	concordo con tutto cio' che ti hanno gia' detto le ragazze qui sopra..penso proprio che non ce la farai a stare a casa e lasciare i tuoi amici che vadano in giro da soli...ci sono cosi' tante cose da fare qui..se vuoi qualcuno che ti faccia vedere la citta' io vivo qui..bacioni Andrea|`|sV9rMBSHaa	Sono sicura che sarà un esperienza bellissima e che alla fine ti divertirai senza sforzi.<br>  Io sono stata a new york e me ne sono innamorata, vai e divertiti|`|arCZIJ5Gaa	1. l'ideale sarebbe trovare un adattatore/TRASFORMATORE. è importante che sia anche un trasformatore perché gli elettrodomestici italiani lavorano a 220V, mentre negli USA hanno la 110V. Usando un semplice adattatore l'asciugacapelli va alla metà della potenza, la piastra non arriva mai a temperatura, ecc. <br>  Se non trovi l'adattatore/trasformatore, non impazzire a cercarlo: comprati quello che ti serve (asciugacapelli o altro) in un grande magazzino (il meno caro: CostCo www.costco.com - ce n'è uno a Long Island e uno a Brooklyn). Con l'euro alle stelle, fai un affare! ;o)<br>  Basta l'adattatore invece per tutti quei congegni che hanno già il trasformatore (notebook, carica batteria cellulare o fotocamera...).<br>  <br>  <br>  2. A NYC ci sono talmente tante cose da fare/osservare che non avrai tempo per angosciarti! Ricorda che lì non sarai fuori dal mondo: con un computer/telefono puoi parlare con i tuoi cari. Ed è un'occasione fantastica per osservare da vicino lo stile di vita americano, molto diverso dal nostro, in meglio e in peggio. Vedrai che sarà un'esperienza importante!<br>  <br>  3. Farmaci: io porto sempre con me alcuni farmaci. Di solito un antibiotico ad ampio spettro e l'aspirina. I farmaci statunitensi, anche gli stessi marchi in vendita da noi, hanno dosaggi diversi (è per questo che troverai confezioni da 100 aspirine...) e - se proprio devo - preferisco usare quelli che ho già preso in passato. NON DIMENTICARE UNA BUONA ASSICURAZIONE SANITARIA per quel mese che stai fuori. Negli USA è fondamentale!
98963ee5e28cb31619811d370d48a04daa	Io fossi in te, prima di andare a vivere in qualche posto all'interno degli Stati Usa, mi informerei sul costo of living (costo della vita)ogni Stato ha il suo. Gli Stati con il cost of living alto sono:  New York, California, Chicago, Florida ecc ecc.  Detto questo, posso dirti che nelle grandi città hai piu' possibilità di trovare un buon lavoro che nei piccoli paesi.<br>  Io vivo in Texas, in una grande città (San Antonio) a me qui piace perché il clima e' tropicale, la gente e' molto simpatica, si mangia bene, il cost of living e' basso, ci sono parecchie cose da fare e vedere, abbiamo la squadra di basket piu' forte del mondo (gli Spurs) insomma e' bella. Houston poi e la piu' grande città del Texas e dista da San Antonio a 2 ore di macchina. A Houston c'è la NASA  :)<br>  Dallas e San Antonio sono a pari merito' le 2 città piu' grandi dopo Houston.

h3gZKRNpaa	Io sono stata alla UC Berkeley un mese l'estate scorsa. Devo dire che mi sono trovata veramente  bene. Per quel che riguarda la mensa immagino possa variare da college a college, ma frutta e verdura dovrebbero esserci in abbondanza, almeno così è stato nella mia esperienza, anche perchè negli states hanno parecchi problemi con l'obesità anche tra gli adolescenti quindi l' "healthy food" è sempre presente.  La cosa funziona penso ovunque a buffet..quindi sei libera di scegliere il cibo che preferisci.<br>  <br>  <br>  Per quel che riguarda i test, a parte che variano da college a college  e anche rispetto al corso che segui non credo dovresti preoccuparti. Se frequenti un corso di inglese servono solo per capire in che livello inserirti. Se frequenti invece un corso tipo summer session del college (ma non credo) la funzione probabilmente è la stessa ma potrebbero essere un po' più impegnativi.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  -------Prego figurati e vai tranquilla!!!...io sono andata da sola e per di più frequentando un corso dedicato a studenti americani ma mi sono trovata benissimo!!!!<br>  ..quindi...HAVE FUN!|`|Q4Ze0Bojaa	L'America e' super attrezzata per i vegetariani , vai bene e basta che dici di essere vegetariani e ti saranno d'aiuto. <br>  Per i 'test' non capisco cosa intendi, test di sanita' o scolastici? poi dipende anche da che corso e', ecc. Solitamente un corso di due settimane ha un esame finale e basta, ma e' un periodo cosi' breve che non so proprio dirti come sara'...<br>  Le mense sono okay ma varia da college a college. Cmq l'america e' un paese avanzato, nn aver preoccupazioni. <br>  Divertitevi!

Insomma, alla fine mi sono portata del Lexotan per paura di avere crisi in aereo ma non l'ho preso, una volta partita ti assicuro che ti prende un  senso di impotenza che ti annienta e crisi non te ne vengono, non che sia diventata coraggiosa anzi volare mi fa ancora paura ma non stai male , tranquillo ! Pensa che il primo viaggio è stato Formentera quindi breve mentre il secondo Thailandia, un viaggio infinitivamente lungo eppure attacchi di panico zero !!!

Dipende dopo quanto tempo dall' assunzione inizia a fare effetto e per quanto tempo di fa effetto; io non l' ho mai preso perchè in aereo ci viaggio bene.<br>  Buon viaggio !!|`|sYxCcNBBaa	io l'anno scorso ho volato x la prima volta e ho preso 0,25 mg di xanax. xò t premetto ke non avevo attacchi di panico ma solo ansia, ma come te ero terrorizzata ke mi venissero degli attacchi. lo sbaglio ke ho fatto è ke l'ho preso quando sono salita sull'aereo, perchè fino a poco tempo prima pensavo di resistere. quindi durante il volo (1 ora e mezza) non mi ha fatto effetto ma x fortuna la paura mi è passata subito. quando sono arrivata a destinazione, però, è iniziato l'effetto rincretinimento... secondo me, prendi 0,25 mg di xanax un'ora prima di partire, considerata anke la lunghezza del viaggio. ciao!
UIJorsD7aa	On November 2, 2008, the Balfour Declaration was 91 years old. It was the crucial first official recognition of Jewish national aspirations.<br>  <br>  Although the declaration itself had little legal status, it was later incorporated into the Sèvres peace treaty with Turkey and the Mandate for Palestine, adopted unanimously by the League of Nations in the San Remo Resolution of 1920. This lent Zionism a legitimacy enjoyed by few national movements before or since.<br>  <br>  Perhaps most astonishing today, the leader of the Arab movement, King Faisal, supported the declaration when it was referred to in the Faisal-Weizmann Agreement of 1919.<br>  <br>  After his meeting with Faisal, Weizmann reported that Faisal was "contemptuous of the Palestinian Arabs whom he doesn't even regard as Arabs".<br>  <br>  Weizmann and Faisal established an informal agreement under which Faisal would support dense Jewish settlement in Palestine while the Zionist movement would assist in the development of the vast Arab nation that Faisal hoped to establish.<br>  <br>  Main points of the agreement:<br>  <br>      * The agreement committed both parties to conducting all relations between the groups by the most cordial goodwill and understanding, to work together to encourage immigration of Jews into Palestine on a large scale while protecting the rights of the Arab peasants and tenant farmers, and to safeguard the free practice of religious observances. The Muslim Holy Places were to be under Muslim control.<br>      * The Zionist movement undertook to assist the Arab residents of Palestine and the future Arab state to develop their natural resources and establish a growing economy.<br>      * The boundaries between an Arab State and Palestine should be determined by a Commission after the Paris Peace Conference.<br>      * The parties committed to carrying into effect the Balfour Declaration of 1917, calling for a Jewish national home in Palestine.<br>      * Disputes were to be submitted to the British Government for arbitration.<br>  <br>  Weizmann signed the agreement on behalf of the Zionist Organization, while Faisal signed on behalf of the short-lived Arab Kingdom of Hedjaz.<br>  <br>  For more info:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faisal%E2%80%93Weizmann_Agreement" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faisal%E2%8...</a>|`|i00SbscLaa	King Faisal was not the king at that time.|`|lh2H5oSOaa	Little wonder. King Faisal was neither the first nor the last Arab head of state who was intimidated and lured to sell long term interests of Arab Nation. King Hussain of Jordan, Anwar Sadat and Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and Emirs of  Kuwait and Qatar are a few examples.<br>  <br>  But time is not too far, when any and all Arabs who have any shame left, will rise and overthrow these stooges of Judo-Christian Alliance bent upon to destroy Muslim Ummah. By God, we will fight unto the last drop of our blood and will give the most stiff  resistance ever given by any nation in history.<br>  <br>                                                 Muhammad Javed Iqbal|`|2573c76efdef879eda46ec9df6a90d3daa	He was assassinated by his nephew, who was pushed by the americans, because he wanted to fight Israel.<br>  <br>  P.S.

eUJE7XEwaa	Depends on the area I think. Luckily where I live  the Blackouts were never that bad, and the municipality kept us very updated.<br>  <br>  Best is, if you on your way to South-Africa or just doing some traveling as a citizen call the local municipality in that area you will be staying in. They should be able to keep you updated.<br>  <br>  Enjoy|`|m3jhPllTaa	Yes we do.Not as bad as before but Eskom is now blaming it on power station malfunctions|`|2UomwjfEaa	No, we have not had any planned blackouts for over a year now.|`|53adca422c280d605197c5d02cab2b26aa	No <br>  Not anymore we are save electricity now.<br>  But now Eskom is complaining saying we are saving too well as a result they did not make enough money.<br>  So Eskom is asking for a price increase on top of last year's 20% increase. <br>  Ain't that a B!tch.<br>  We just can't win as the consumers.|`|IORkiAhsaa	I'm staying in Port Elizabeth & last night we had the power cut off from 7.30pm till 9.30pm, so i think its heading back for us.<br>  There has been power cuts in various areas in PE this whole week...
TmKl6nXOaa	dont forget your ID <br>  <br>  arrive to the airport with plenty of time to check in and make it through securtity... an hour before your flight should be enough<br>  <br>  you cant bring liquids on the plane in your carry on unless its less than 3oz and the items that are liquid are in a ziplock bag<br>  <br>  wear shoes that are easy to take off in security line<br>  <br>  wear something that will keep you warm on the plane but that u can remove if its too warm... wear layers<br>  <br>  bring gum to chew so your ears dont pop<br>  <br>  never leave you bags unattended and never take or help anyone you dont know with their bags|`|vNeTmHu9aa	Don't wear a lot of metal stuff that will set off the machine when you go thru security.  <br>  <br>  Wear comfy shoes that are easy to put on and take off.  <br>  <br>  Laptops have to be taken out of their carrying bags and sent thru the xray machine separately.<br>  <br>  Don't try to take a bottle of water thru security; it will be confiscated.  <br>  <br>  All liquids and gels have to be in containers smaller than 3 oz each, and they all have to fit in 1 zipped, quart-size ziplock bag.  <br>  <br>  Most sharp objects are forbidden.  <br>  <br>  Remember to be courteous to other passengers on the plane.  The rule of thumb is pretty much that the people sitting in front of you get off the plane before you.  Also, if someone brings along some reading material, don't try to carry on a conversation with them.  <br>  <br>  Relax and enjoy.  |`|cpM8GQ5Yaa	Very smart to start out small and work your way to longer flights.  It's thrilling to say the least for the first one and then afterwards it's a piece of cake.  Listen to the flight attendants as they explain safety procedures in case of an emergency.  Nothing too major than that.  Ask for a second helping of pretzels if they offer them still for free unless it's already cancelled due to high gas prices.  Safe first trip and enjoy!!|`|6Klrs74Waa	I swear you will be fine!<br>  BELIEVE ME...I am 35 years old and just took my first flight on July 31st..I was terrified. I cried for weeks before hand.<br>  But the day arrived and I got to the airport (I was flying alone to back home St. Louis to Philly...1:45 minute flight.)  I was OK.<br>  I just psyched myself up , took my anxiety pill and a dramamine. <br>  I took an aisle seat...So I could feel like I had more room. I got two great seatmates who talked me through everything.<br>  <br>  I also had my MP3 player ..but I was so interested in what the flight attendants or pilots were saying or even my seatmates....I didnt listen much at all.. Before I knew it..we were 10 minutes to our approach!<br>  I was AMAZED!!!!!!!!!!<br>  I did get a little nervous when it got bumpy...but I just remembered that it is NORMAL!  <br>  I went on Southwest Airlines...<br>  It sure beat driving 14 hours!!<br>  And it was nice seeing my parents in Philly when I landed..and just 2 hours previous..I was in St. Louis!<br>  Good luck!<br>  |`|sSjrt1WJaa	Just take a deep breath :) I love flying on planes I think its great, and especially for your first time, it'll be an amazing experiance. If you get nervous about the flight just know that it is more likely to get in a car crash than a plane crash! People fly every day. Especially celebs. Sit back and enjoy your flight - and your holiday!|`|5IcPdD4Paa	If you get sick a few days later, what does that have to do with the plane ride? Meh, anyway. If it's your first time, get a window seat. |`|g2B67E98aa	hmmm... nothin.. just act like everybody does|`|Xtqq71KGaa	chew gum.|`|s9Cs4q5aaa	You should know all the basic stuff like the airport goes:<br>  <br>  Check in-<br>  Wait a while get something to eat maybe-<br>  Security-<br>  Departures-<br>  Go to your gate-<br>  <br>  Any the rest is easy.<br>  <br>  You should know that your only aloud 100ml of liquid in a single container. Each of the containers must be put in a 15x20 seethrough bag. For your hand luggage that is. <br>  <br>  All the normal stuuf like your not aloud sharp stuff in your hand luggage, it must be put in your suitcase.<br>  <br>  My tips: Dont put anything extremly valuable or breakable in your luggage because the bags do get threw about without care.<br>  <br>  Arrive an hour or two early because you need to check in.<br>  <br>  If you want you can go on to the website and check what you are and aren't allowed.<br>  <br>  You should take a book maybe and some sweeties cus your gona need to suck them when the plane is taking off and landing. Orelse you'll get sore ears. This happens because of the silly cabin pressure change.<br>  <br>  The most important one.<br>  Enjoy yor flight.|`|k9frbelIaa	There are two things I always make sure I do.  1)  Chew gum during the flight.  Your ears can get clogged up at the high altitude.  Chewing helps pop your ears.  (That's why they serve peanuts.)  2)  Don't take off your shoes.  Your feet swell slightly.  If you keep your shoes on you won't even notice.  But if you take them off you will have a little trouble putting them back on.|`|aWrwIiIaaa	oohh! perfect for me to answer.. my daddy's a pilot! :)) It's PERFECTLY safe. they go over ever inch of the plane before it leaves the gate. just remember on the take off to lean back in your chair.

It's very beautiful and very interesting with an amazing variety of experiences and scenery packed into a (compared to Australia) small space.<br>  <br>  If you have 6 months or so, come to Australia. That will give you time to visit the unforgettable Great Barrier Reef; the tropical rainforests; Sydney, Melbourne and 1 or 2 of the other cities; perhaps the Gold Coast and the magnificent beaches of southeast Queensland, Northern New South Wales and the rest of the NSW coastline. Drive the Great Ocean Road and go across to Adealide and the Barossa Valley. You may even have time to get to Uluru, Kakadu and some of the other amazing places in the Northern Territory. If you have time, go to Perth and then to the north of Western Australia - some truly amazing places up there.<br>  <br>  If you have long enough, do both countries. We're only a few hours apart and fares are cheap.|`|zfrPmiFtaa	Australia for sure! We are studying both places, and it's amazing. Not to mention a lot of the people there are nice. You will have to learn some of the lingo there though. They use a lot of words and phrases that would confuse anyone who hasn't been there before.

But, honestly, if you want to go into teaching, there is no need to go to a super-great college.  A state school with a good teacher ed. program would be fine.  Anything more is kind of a waste.  <br>  And that's a great list that Native New Yorker has given you, except you can't just go to a community college to be a teacher; it has to be a four-year degree.  And I don't know for sure if everything on that list offers teacher education.|`|rT43plWoaa	Queens College has an excellent program and a beautiful campus.

Listen yourself<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7M27Z8tOKE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7M27Z8tO...</a><br>  One reason why everybody speaks English better than in other countries is the Dutch television. They do not overdub English or American movies with Dutch language but transmit it in the original language with Dutch subtitles. So people can learn English by watching TV. I have spent three years of my military service at the NATO military headquarters near Mons/Belgium working with other soldiers of all NATO countries and I must confess that my co-workers from the Netherlands, the northern part of Belgium and Denmark were able to communicate in the English language better than me. All these countries do not overdub British or American movies. I wish Germany would do that too, at least on some movies to serve as an additional way to learn the language.

Claro, como mis compa?eros han dicho...tienes que visitar el carneval de Colonia. En estos días todas las personas son locas....pero....divertidas. <br>  Vale, en Munich hay muchas cosas culturales como arquitecturas, museos, parques etc. No lo sé qué quieres visitar o qué te interesa.

(Zugspitze) Pero...la ciudad más bonita es Dresde (en mi opinión), y Berlín también. Una buena posibilidad viajar más barato es la "Mitfahrgelegenheit" en el internet.

However,...Jeng...jeng..jeng...,<br>  Najib would not hold the position for long, maximum up to December 2008. Dato Seri Anwar will take over the post. Currently, Anwar has enough Member of Parliaments to support him. The minimum he require to form the government is 112 numbers and now he has more than that. According to Westminsters countries ( countries under British rules previously ), any Member of Parliament who has enough support can ask for Vote of nonconfident against the current Prime Minister. However, due to inexperince in changing the government by this process Malaysia has to be very carefull so that the instability among the races would not happen. For this reason also the wise and charismatic Dato' Seri Anwar has not cry for power eventhough he has enough MPs behind him. <br>  Anyway, another solution for Dato Seri Anwar and Pakatan Rakyat to form the government is by seeking the Yang Dipertuan Agong and sumbitted the names of the MPs. The Yang DiPertuan Agong will call the MPs and ask them personally which party that they do support.<br>  If all the MPs support Dato' Seri Anwar, then the Agong will terminate Najib and appoint Anwar as a Prime Minister.<br>  So, the Prime Minister in waiting is Dato' Seri Anwar Ibrahim NOT Dato' Seri Najib Razak.<br>  Makkal Sakthi<br>  Reformasi.<br>   |`|gSwm0CpCaa	I think at the next Parliamentary session the PM will given a vote of no confidence as the cross overs to the opposition is very real .Then of of course there will be a snap election or the opposition will take over . <br>  <br>  This of course means that however you look at it by year end Anwar Ibrahim will the next PM <br>  <br>  People want change and even in event of an election Anwar is set to create history . |`|BT0MXAOnaa	My choice is Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim but in politics, they play dirty ...

The US dollar is better now than a month ago.  Perhaps your currency will improve a little more too!<br>  <br>  I will take the currency exchanges in Thailand any day over Hong Kong!  Thailand uses real banks and the rate is almost uniform throughout the country except for a few satang.  Rates change every day, today you get one rate and the following day the rate will be a little different, either up or down.    <br>  <br>  I thought all of the money changers in Hong Kong stink, but that is a personal opinion!   You can get money from ATM's pretty easy though in both places.<br>  <br>  If anyone you can trust approaches you with some genuine Thai baht that he wants to unload at a good rate (use links above for comparison) do it!  Otherwise I would wait until February.  Up to you!<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|M7n2EPMXaa	it wouldn't be changed so much.. don't worry about it. if you wanna save.. try to save on other cost like accommodation ... try this site <a href="http://www.discovery-thailand.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.discovery-thailand.com</a>   they offer lowest rate guarantee... you can try to compare with other.... have a nice trip|`|44f68ad0694db9770268e88589cc4279aa	Change your currency when you arrive in Thailand

It's very cheap compared to the fare at park and fly ( I think they charge over 500 pesos per night).|`|046yAvJAaa	I just came from an overnight trip from singapore via cebu pacific. Yes, just drive the car to the carpark but make sure you are given a parking stub for those who are taking an overnight parking. I paid P50 for my (1) overnight parking upon exit.

KS2OHXCRaa	I have never tried buying online but from visiting experiences, they do not check passport/nationality to enter Disneyland. At most they may ask for their demographic survey purposes that you can confirm orally.<br>  <br>  There will be problem if you're buying physical tickets, as the address allows on UK site is an UK address in order for the tickets to be posted. But if you're buying e-ticket, I don't see how it could be any problem.

wOA2Mf6Naa	You pay like 500 or thousand every time the woman goes to a checkup. On the first checkup you agree on a package deal.<br>  I can recommend Sacred Heart Hospital, my son was born there december 17th last year. My wife had payed 3000 altogether on her previous checkups. So the bill amounted to 5,380  not very much and very priceworthy I think. If you are not filipino you also should know that after birth you are required to get the medecines yourself from the pharmacy and pay a separate bill for the child.<br>  If you are well off you can of course choose a hospital like Chong Hua .|`|ZSAbJEv6aa	A package deal is like this:<br>  <br>  Usually, when a pregnant woman goes on her first pre-natal check-up, she is asked whether she would opt for a package deal.  This means that for every pre-natal check-up she does, she pays a certain amount.  And the hospital reserves the right to appoint an ob-gyne in case she goes into labor and her regular doctor is unavailable.  One of the conditions she has to meet is to donate blood...no, not her but someone in her family or a friend.  I think it is like 2 bags of blood, screened and examined of course by the hospital itself.<br>  <br>  After delivery, she stays in a maternity ward...not a private room.  All medicines, paraphernalia she uses she buys from the pharmacy and are not chargeable to her account.  For normal delivery, it costs something like 3 to 4t...2 days stay in the hospital.  I am not, however, sure if they charge for the nursery.  Anyway, if a CS is done, the woman pays additional because the package deal is only good for a normal delivery.  The additional payment would cost like 15 to 20t.<br>  <br>  Most hospitals in Cebu offer package deals to pregnant patients.  If you think of availing this feature, the hospital itself has their own ob-gyne to attend to these women.  These are doctors being paid or are employed by the hospital for such purpose.

I worked there for a while and came to the conclusion that it was great, but actually no better or worse than Britain. Could you get yourself on one of those gap year or Work America schemes to actually get a taste of life over there.<br>  <br>  Bear in mind that LA is full of people desperate to take any film job no matter how small. You may actually be better off trying to get your foot in the door of the TV/film industry over here and then go over to America with something on your CV. Remember, there is a lot of international respect for many of the behind-the-scenes people in British film and getting some experience at a British studio definitely won't do you any harm.<br>  <br>  You also need to bear in mind that a lot of people who start out at the bottom do actually have film degrees or have been on technical courses. I am a big film buff and on some of the forums I go on there are 15 year olds who spend every school holiday getting as much work experience as possible and are studying film studies at college in the evening. You are going to be up against a lot of competition from people with more experience.|`|4IC78le4aa	Just think about how far you are away from home and on your own. It sounds like an adventure but the reality is when you are 19 are you are far from the place that is familiar to you and you dont know a soul, you feel very very alone.<br>  <br>  It might help if you studied film directing or acting or anything at the National Insitute of Dramatic Art in your city. Give yourself a couple of years before you make the leap. It will be near impossible to even get a job as a runner without any credentials whatsoever. And when you are far from home, no money and no-one to turn to, your dream will fade into oblivion. <br>  <br>  Better to prepare yourself and think about what you do before you take such a leap.|`|ZTlD1adpaa	I think that it is great to have something to aspire to and it is good that you recognise that you are going to have to start at the bottom - but i know that not having done anything in the way of directing/acting/degree will definitely keep you back. America is obviousley "the place to get started" in many peoples eyes but what most people dont realise that many of the "big shots" in america, the big hollywood actors and directors came to England to be trained as here is where some of the worlds best training is offered! If you are serious about getting into directing then i would suggest staying in England for a few years and possibly looking into getting into somewhere like RADA or LAMDA or somewhere that offers a directing course/or any course that you are interested in - in RADA for example. while doing your course you will be receiving the best tuition available and will also be given the chance to get work experience! RADA has a respected name in America. <br>    Obviously it is possible to get your foot in the door but it is very unlikely- better to stay put for a while, gain a little experience, even a degree then see where you can go as you will also be more likely to be noticed by an agent or director that will help you if you go to a course as at the end of it you will showcase your work to people already well established in the business! <br>  Remember the film business is notoriously hard to break into, even if you do have a degree so be prepared to fail a few times! <br>  <br>  Good Luck xx

Again they tell us that the 6 north eastern counties of Ireland which are part of the Province of Ulster are Ulster, and that the other 3 Ulster counties are not in Ulster, but in a place called Eire. Somebody forgot to tell them that Eire is the irish word for Ireland. We have been told in the past, and still today by some people in England that we do not live in Ireland but in Eire.

HCvF4Bm1aa	Pirates are pirates and know no rules... innocent people shouldn't suffer because of them xxxx|`|B3FBgxjEaa	Somali pirates have hit commercial vessels 100 times, just in this year. The U.S. Navy and its allies have admitted than they don't have a big enough fleet to ensure every ship's safety. So ship owners are now reaching out to Blackwater for protection, according to Executive Vice President Bill Matthews<br>  <br>  "Blackwater Worldwide today announced that its 183-foot ship, the McArthur, stands ready to assist the shipping industry as it struggles with the increasing problem of piracy in [Somalia's] Gulf of Aden," the firm says in a statement. "As a company founded and run by former Navy SEALs, with a 50,000-person database of former military and law enforcement professionals, Blackwater is uniquely positioned to assist the shipping industry."<br>  <br>  It's not eactly a brand-new idea. Mercenaries have been battling pirates for a good eight centuries, off and on. Back in 2005, the Somali government tried to hire a U.S. security contractor for maritime protection -- only to have the company fall victim to scandal. This June, there were conflicting reports that a French security outfit had won a $150 million deal to take the American firm's place. One U.S. admiral even joined in the pirate-fighting mercenary chorus, allegedly. But it "raises more legal issues than anyone could possibly count."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://blog.wired.com/defense/2008/10/blackwater-well.html" rel="nofollow">http://blog.wired.com/defense/2008/10/bl...</a>|`|6e8af9deff7a2588bb4959771651cb16aa	You've said it. They are pirates. During WWI the British used 'Q' ships, heavily armed  decoy ships diguised as merchantmen, to lure German 'U' Boats into ill advised attacks. The Germans employed the same tactic for commerce raiding, Hilfskreuzers, fast passenger ships (HSK - auxiliary cruisers). These were fitted out in Germany, or at colonial outposts, and also at sea by transferring guns from warships. <br>  <br>  Now that might suprise our Somali pirate friends. Once captured (the pirates), assuming they hadn't been drowned at sea, they could be put on trial in an International Court. Trial at sea by the capturing ship would do for me, coupled with summary justice. Personally I'd have all my decoy ships fitted with yard arms!|`|av3vmWSHaa	kill them the best way to deal with the somalian piractes|`|1GUtSVhsaa	We should sink their ships and feed their copes to Komodo Dragons.|`|4e01ea3c043d72bb0dcd6600971480b9aa	ships should sail further out to sea|`|3904bf9cec60af77f3ce3e9dfcd8c007aa	Sink their boats and let them drown.|`|ZTc7rE1Haa	Well, I know what should NOT happen. That is, their demands should never be met as that sends out the message to potential pirates that there is money to be made in that way.<br>  <br>  Perhaps crack troops like the SAS should board the ships in question and take the pirates into custody. If they resist they should be shot.

So, a limited answer will have to suffice:    <br>  <br>  When you're dealing with people like this, I think it's best to draw a line and stick to it.  What that consists of is up to you and other family members.  But everyone HAS to be on board and everyone HAS to be firm and consistent in your responses to him and to the behavior.  People like this will take a mile if you offer them an inch.  <br>  <br>  --Insisting on counseling is a reasonable option.

Insist he leave the house immediately and find somewhere else to live, IMMEDIATELY, and then FOLLOW THROUGH by calling the cops.  He also needs to know you absolutely will put his stuff out on the sidewalk or street by dawn if he's not gone.  <br>  <br>  Make absolutely NO threats if you can't or won't follow through.  This only helps him ignore you, disrespect anything you say.   For him, all this has become a game, and he knows he can easily "win" it.  He's  also "slithered out" of being resonsible for his actions and for his own self control.  <br>  <br>  If you threaten to call the police to have him removed, then you MUST totally DO IT, esp. if his behavior includes violence to ANY other member of the household.  <br>  <br>  --Say you've heard "sorry" a million times and that you no longer believe him.  Further say that every time he's "sorry", but turns around and does it again, then that makes him a LIAR.  At that point, you're just not willing to listen to or trust ANYthing he says.  <br>  <br>  Make it clear that his actions speak louder than his words and that everyone in the house WILL BE watching him from that point on.  <br>  <br>  BTW:  Call the behavior what it is, PLEASE!  <br>  <br>  If he's repeatedly doing it when he's been told to stop, it's not a "mistake", it's not an accident.  And, unless he's seriously mentally ill, tell him that doing a particular behavior others find truly offensive, once or twice is a mistake.  <br>  <br>  To do it a third time and beyond, now that is a freakin' CHOICE and it's a freakin' HABIT.  Tell him that you'll not take anymore apologies from him.  <br>  <br>  Walk out of the room if he continues to offer his "sorry".  He needs to accept that the sorrys and the behavior are so done.|`|9R8uYHcPaa	it gets tiresome after a while ... and desperate measures should be taken ...

hRnEf90Naa	Ummm... Happiness! It is like Water for the fish and Oxygen for us!<br>  <br>  In my opinion there is a secret to a happy.... my friend Happiness and Sadness are two frames of mind and can be controlled/ extended/ reduced with practice. It sounds queer but you can actually do that. One has to find happiness in small things and only waiting for some thing big to happen to feel happy.. never happens as one get out of practice when it comes. <br>  <br>  Life is a series of small happenings/ events and if you try to enjoy those little occasions/ moments, when accumulated it leads a happy life. On the other hand you can also control your sadness to some extent, for example one person looses a few bucks and he may moan about it for weeks or on the other hand another person looses his car or a large sum of money and he might just say what the hell, I will somw how get that again and why lament for it.<br>  <br>  With a little practice/ effort you can lead a happy life.. My friend start enjoying small occasions and try to shred your worries by accepting them right there and then and then just get on with your life...<br>  <br>  So be happy, always.|`|VBJol3W2aa	happiness is a simple thing but hard to get ......happiness don't care about money or place ... it just to have cool mind .. to have the people u love ...........may small piece of Chocolate make u happy .....and million dollar make u sad|`|AA11860198	Living with contentment and honoring commitment.|`|AA10729493	happiness is a dream once you think you're happy, you wake up and its gone|`|iMGh7zBmaa	happiness is just a bunch of letters putting together H A P P I N E S S|`|HrewRe7saa	Contempt.

171093536a1d7095d02740cf4e719a5baa	The latest eruption of tensions began with an argument Friday night near a cemetery in Medina, Islam's second holiest city, that contains the graves of revered imams.<br>  <br>  A Saudi official put the blame on the Shiite pilgrims, saying they triggered the dispute by practicing rituals deemed by others to be "religious infractions," such as the practice of Shiites to grab a handful of dust as a blessing and pray at the graves of the imams.<br>  The official, who would not allow his name to be used, said such "infractions" are frequent at al-Baqee and usually are dealt with quietly by asking pilgrims to stop. But last week, he charged, a large crowd of Shiites was bent on provoking other worshipers and authorities at the cemetery.<br>  Asked if members of the religious police had videotaped Shiite female pilgrims, the official said that if there was filming it was to take evidence of the infractions and not for voyeurism.<br>  The official said nine of the Shiite visitors to the cemetery were arrested. He said the government was keen to find out the truth and the reasons for the escalation. He said the perpetrators would be held responsible, but did not elaborate.|`|82LusQuKaa	Because the can!

ey3JN1Zaaa	I went two years ago. You need to book as soon as possible. It's next door to Sea World, on International Drive. Book through the website <a href="http://www.discoverycove.com/DCO2/" rel="nofollow">http://www.discoverycove.com/DCO2/</a> or through other reliable ticket websites (<a href="http://www.orlando-ticket-deals.co.uk/discovery-cove/index.html?source=adwords&adgrp=discovery_cove&gclid=CI2cvv2MjJkCFRK7ZwodmRh0oA)" rel="nofollow">http://www.orlando-ticket-deals.co.uk/di...</a><br>  <br>  Its a fantastic day. Try to get your dolphin swim in the morning to avoid it being cancelled by storms. The day starts early and guests a limited to 1000 a day. Everything is included from breakfast to sun cream. The service is excellent.<br>  <br>  I swam with a dolphin called Diego, his mum was Sandy and the two were from San Diego :-). Do not wait until getting to Orlando to buy tickets!<br>  <br>  Need any more help feel free to ask. Hope this helps :-)|`|d7908def95c72a79cbe9300435adf2d2aa	Hi,<br>  Discovery Cove is owned by the same people who own Seaworld it is at the top end of International Drive so not far from where you are staying. We went about 4 years ago for my husbands 40th and can tell you that although it is expensive it is totally worth it, once you are in the park all your food is free for the day. We booked our tickets online before we went at www.discoverycove.com or you could look at www.seaworld.com as there is a link to discovery.<br>  Hope you have a great time.|`|JLayHNZCaa	If you still have questions or want reviews of this, you could visit tripadvisor.com a free site with reviews,  recommendations and links to hotels, attractions and restaurants in the area you are interested in.  Go to the Orlando forum and someone will have personal experiences to share.|`|qO7nbSQVaa	Discovery world is owned by Seaworld and it really is a fantastic place to visit, we were there in March last year and we lolved every minute of it. It is rather expensive , i think it is currently about ￡130  per person for the day but when you consider everything is in with the price from all your food and drinks right down to your sun cream and you are treated fantastically well in every way .The actual dolphin swim is more of a dolphin tow from the middle of the lake to the shore but you also get to interact with the dolphins for about 40 minutes and seeing that it may be a once in a lifetime opportunity it is well worth it .I am guessing that it will be ery busy in June and spaces are limited to 1000 people per day so you really should be booking it now , i think you need to book it online either with Discovery cove direct or any of the many websites who sell the tickets online, dolnt forget to select the dolphin swim package as a non swim package is also available for a cheaper price .Dont miss out , get it booked now and have the time of your lifr , enjoy your trip.|`|2q1XI0j9aa	Its owned by Anheuser Busch, it is expensive but sooo worth it. last I looke dit was 369 for the dolphin adventure, which gets you swim with dolphins and all day entrance to the rest of Discovery Cove, lunch is included and you also get 7 days to sea world so it more than pays for itself. It is so much fun! you should be able to do it online, and you need to do it asap I recommend and earlier dolphin swim over a later swim because you can go do your swim time and you wont need to worry about looking at the clock the rest of your day and potentially missing the swim. I have done the dolphin swim twice and just absolutely loved it!<br>  <br>  the website should have all the info you need.<br>  www.discoverycove.com/|`|tV7ZYIeEaa	Sea Worlds discovery cove is just across the street from Sea World. If your hotel is in the I drive area check out the I drive trolley it can take you there.<br>  The best way to book DC visit is by the website they do sometimes offer discounts if you do it it advanced.<br>  <br>  Other than Discovery Cove there is also Aquatica Sea worlds water park near by and also outlet malls on either ends of I drive
YmXq50C0aa	We stayed for five nights and six days at Hedo II. Not gonna lie, when we first got there we were intimidated by the age group we found, definitely older (we are 25 and 21)  However, we quickly made friends with the younger people on the resort and had a blast. This place is crazy, ANYTHING goes, and it really goes. You have to visit the nude side of the resort, believe me, that's the whole reason you're visiting Hedo. No matter where your day takes you, you always end up at the nude hot tub with forty of your new-found friends, naked and watching some craziness happen. There's never any pressure to join in, and you're usually more than welcome to watch. The whole vibe of Hedo is do whatever you want with whomever you want, as naked, free, and drunk as you wanna be. I highly recommend Hedo to couples that are looking for a unique but unforgettable vacation. We can't wait to visit Hedo II again.|`|YnNhr3eIaa	Spanish 7 gave you good insight. I would like to add that the rooms are somewhat in need of upgrading. I wouldnt give them a high star rating. The food is just OK. But of course, for most of us, we are not going to Hedo for the rooms or food. It is what it is and it is also what you make of it.

With the current exchange rate, I wouldn't plan on doing much shopping (unless you want to buy drink and fags) because currently, prices in Spain are much the same as England.  I would have a bit more money available just in case the food at the hotel is bad and you want to eat out some evening meals.  You will probably eat lunch out on some days too.<br>  <br>  I would take cash and change it at the post office before I left.  Keep hold of your bag at all times on the way there, then just stick some money in the safe in the room when you get there.  If you don't want to carry cash, the cashpoint fees are not exorbitant.  You get the daily exchange rate, around 1.10 euros to the pound and the machine charges you 2.5% commission to withdraw the money and charge it back to your account in pounds, so you don't pay your banks fee for taking money out abroad  So taking out 100 euros will cost you approx ￡2.50 which may be less than your bank's fee for withdrawals abroad.   If you have a nationwide cashpoint card it doesn't cost you anything to withdraw abroad.|`|AA11719683	Impossible to answer as we don't know what part of Spain you're going to.

People are much more stuck up in Toronto, and think that it is odd to exchange a look, a smile, or a hello.  In vancouver, people are much more pleasant and approachable, and they do not have as much of a "snobby" air about them.  <br>  <br>  The community in vancouver is much more european-like.  There are alot of cafes and social gatherings and events that you cnanot find in Toronto. <br>  In starbucks for example- in Toronto- people are so formal, rude, and expect perfection- afraid to say anything but the order.  People seem to be so tense, rude and egoistic. In vancouver, the staff and the overall clientel was much more happier, and pleasant.  <br>  <br>  There is just a notion of tension in Toronto- i dont know my neighbours, people keep to themselves.  In vancouver, I met more people than I have ever met in Toronto on the streets.  Public transit was much more safe and pleasant, and i felt rather safer than I had ever felt in Toronto. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps!|`|29ZL58Xjaa	I would have to say that Vancouver is a lot more laid back then Toronto.

MMAAntxLaa	If you are spending wisely, then 15,000 Baht is more than enough. A fair few expat teachers up country earn and are able to survive on 30000 baht per month. <br>  For me though, Bangkok is a great city, and one that can be really appreciated more by lashing out a bit. Nothing like a good soapy massage @ about 2000baht, a great meal at the Seafood Palace, from 1000baht up, and a look around the bars at Soi 33. <br>  If your traveling alone, Thailand and Bangkok is a great place for the single traveler. Pop down to the open air bars in Nana or all along Sukhumvit, and you can meet lovely hostesses, with no hassle or pressure for those just wanting a fun time. Shoot pool or play games and just enjoy the atmosphere. A few drimks are always welcome though! <br>  15000 baht is just over $80 per day, and if you are paying for a hotel out of this as well, then depending on what you want, this will also eat into this<br>  However, you can still hang out down Khao San Rd with other travelers for next to nothing, if that's your thing|`|2wYFvVKJaa	Cheap accommodation..... 500 per night.<br>  Hire motorbike................. 200 per day.<br>  Breakfast lunch dinner...... 400 per day.<br>  Tuk Tuk fares................... 300 per day.<br>  One hour massage........... 300 per day.<br>  4 beers ........................... 400 per day.<br>  <br>  Thats starting to look like a good holiday, it depends what extras you are looking for, like shopping etc.<br>  I think you would be safer with 20000.<br>  Enjoy your trip.|`|NbeIwkr9aa	I don't think so in my opinion, as I like to spend some money on my vacation and this without being extravaganza.

urHPuzMsaa	A little secret. Don't tell anyone. If you go over to the Rio or to the Excalibur they have male shows for girls only. The Chippendales and The Thunder From Down Under gets the girls into a frenzy and when the shows end and all the girls come streaming out they are in the mood for one thing and it isn't gambling. The number of clubs that operate here nightly increases the chances too. Not a myth and not an urban legend but a fact.|`|rUvaitfLaa	This city is run on alcohol!  Most people will sleep with anything once the beer goggles are on.|`|pTLcvsVfaa	Well the reason it has gained the repuation of being easy to get laid, is mainly because of the number of working ladies. I had a buddy who had a girl hitting on him, and he didnt even realize she was a hooker until they were half naked making out on the bed. By then he could not resist paying her. That kind of thing happens to guys often in Vegas.<br>  <br>  But as far as with regular girls, its like any other place that is fueled by alcohol. If you put enough effort into, its not hard to get laid. Groups of single girls often go to Vegas looking to have fun. That doesnt mean they will just throw themselves at guys like sluts, but if you are nice you probably have a decent chance of banging one of them. Although its not quite as easy to get laid as spring break, its somewhat like that.|`|dFBccLExaa	Depends on your standards lol.

One of her aunts had recently attended someone elses marriage and this young girl was also there.. She was videotaped during the marriage party danceing around with other women at the party.. The aunt then took the video of her and showed it to one of her friends who knew a lady with 2 young guys of marrying age (single and looking also)..<br>  the first brother said no, the 2nd brother was interested.. So they set up a meeting.. they both (the girl and boy) was interested in each other, so they met a few more times.. <br>  now here is where some disagree in the west.. <br>  they declared or set the intent to marry..and got formally engaged..<br>  this is where they can date with chaperones etc..<br>  he would go to her town/house and sit and get to know her, and she was invited to his home (accompanied by an elder aunt, mother, uncle etc) and would sit and get to know him.. He could now take her out to a restaurant etc...<br>  NO hanky panky though till the wedding.. then after around 6 months, they formally married..<br>  <br>  so if during this engagement time, they felt they were just not compatable, they could seperate and with no ill feelings. no ones chastity broken.. all would be ok...|`|A5ZQmmW1aa	It is illegal for an unmarried man and woman to be alone together unchaperoned, so this cuts out the possibility for men and women to meet socially.

xcDwLp4uaa	You shouldn't need to pay to volunteer there are many local organisations in need of volunteers. I used to volunteer at the Animal Anti Cruelty League and I also did on and off stuff for Avril Elizabeth homes, the World Primate Sanctuary, Acres of Love etc I was also an honorary ranger for San Parks and a police reservist (B) and in high school I was a first aid respondent with St John’s. Some of my friends volunteered at the zoo, the fire station and other children’s homes. There are many ways you can help without paying (sometimes you have to pay for courses but it is a nominal amount and you get certificates to boost up your CV anyway). If you are looking for something to do for just a month I would suggest calling your local animal shelter or if you are in Gauteng and want to work specifically with primates then call the World Primate Sanctuary (if you want the number e-mail me). Habitat for Humanity also sounds like a great option. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|AA11326712	You could also approach private places and offer your services in exchange for board and lodging or similar.

AA10919524	You can find flights to Hawaii for as low as $39 each way!! (assuming, of course, you live on Oahu and mean The Big Island when you say Hawaii).  Since you don't indicate where you are flying from, my best advice is to search on a big travel site such as expedia and then book directly through the airline that expedia lists as the cheapest.  You can usually save $10-20 this way.  <br>  <br>  Depending on where you're flying from, it may also be worthwhile to check flights to Hawaii from the west coast (Los Angeles/LAX) and then book your flight to LA separately.  This can be a lot of legwork for not much savings though. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|6RGQ8lNmaa	Try sights like expedia travelocity bookit and hotwire. I found the cheapest plane tickets on expedia.

rvFqdocjaa	I know that Hotel room rates climb during the summer months as people from around the world gravitate to Tunisia for its many pleasures.|`|OHfZFR31aa	No, especially if you get away from the tourist resorts, it's very cheap to stay and eat. The main things that are expensive are alcoholic drinks in a bar/restaurant and car rental. If you don't mind eating in "locals" restaurants, it's really cheap and the food is better than what you get in most resorts|`|Dfeemjagaa	you know it's not bad for some things. food and drinks are cheap. coke cola run about 80 cents for a liter,  a bottle of water will cost 40, this is in a store, in a restaurant they charge a lot, a can of coke can be anywhere from $1-$2 and water is close to $1(US) now souvenirs will cost a bit more and can be quite expensive. i recommend sticking to buying from places with clear, set price(on the item) or tell them you do not want 'a tourist price'. (some people will triple the price) do not be afraid to bargain, it's part of the experience. now eating, sandwiches with fries(street food) should not be more than 3 dinars, restaurants can range from $20 for 2 meals and drinks (Planet food in sousse is great) or $40 for a fancier place( like a pirate ship that was turned into a restaurant) when taking a taxi( walking and taxi is really only way to get around) make sure your driver runs the meter and does not over charge you. other than that Tunisia is a great place to vacation. any more question feel free to ask.|`|fRgqgBhmaa	asalama (hi, hello)<br>  no, tunisian dinnar is very cheap<br>  we have many of things for good price, you can have a 5 course meal for 30dinar about just lest the 15 english money, its very cheap :)<br>  <br>  <br>  salam (peace)

94b8KImYaa	Below is a link which might can give you some guidance. <br>  The registration you are talking about is not as a German citizen - but you need to register as living in the country. <br>  <br>  Yet I also found the following, which is contrary to what the link says below: Entry requirements for UK nationals: UK nationals require a passport. No visa is required for a stay of up to 90 days in six months if the passport is endorsed British Citizen, British National (Overseas), British Overseas Territories Citizen with the right of abode in the UK, or British Subject with the right of abode in the UK. If the intended stay exceeds 90 days, British Citizens can obtain a visa after arrival. In all other cases a visa is required.<br>  <br>  This question should have been asked before leaving the UK. <br>  I suggest you go to your local "Einwohnermeldeamt" to find out. <br>  Why would registering in Germany jeopardize your job opportunity ? You will only register that you are living there - which is the law in Germany. It will not make you a German citizen. <br>  <br>  Since you are applying for a job at the base, also the base should be able to give you some guidance - since military is always treated a little different.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	You need to register as a foreign national living in Germany, and as you're from an EU country, it's just a matter of some paperwork. You can stay in Germany for up to 90 days without doing this. Why don't you go to the local city council office where you are in Germany and ask them about it, or you can also go to the local police. <br>  <br>  You can't become a German citizen unless you live there for several years.|`|bhNaTYjOaa	You are a citizen of the European Union. Both the UK and Germany are EU member states. You don't need any visas.|`|17103f1748af3e37b30568fa758fd4d3aa	As germany is part of the EU you are entitled to work there and live there without doing anything|`|CvGEdIUiaa	Enquire with the German embassy or local "Ausl?nderamt" as to what to do. As far as I know, since you are a citizen of a member state of the "old" Eu countries, all you have to do is go to the local "Amt" ("Einwohnermeldeamt") and register there. That does not mean you register as a German citizen. Becoming a German citizen takes eight years and you would have to do a test to prove your German language skills and so on, and obviously, that's not what you want or need to do at all. All you are doing when registering with the local "Einwohnermeldeamt" is telling them that you are there. As a member of one of the "old" EU states, you do have the right to stay in Germany for as long as you want, as long as you have the funds to support yourself. You do not have the right, however, to apply for any kind of financial aid. You do have the right to register with the local job "Amt" to see what (other) jobs are out there for you.<br>  But as far as "registering" with the Amt: Like I said, you only tell them you are there. That's all.|`|Jm3vMKx3aa	It depends on your status in the UK. All answers given before were based on the fact that you are a British citizen but you write that you are a UK resident.<br>  Holding a residence permit for the UK would not authorize you to come to Germany except if you hold a residence permit as a dependent of a EU citizen. It this case you would be granted to stay for 90 days in a 6 month period.<br>  <br>  If you should hold a British passport forget what I have told before. In this case you just register at the town-hall of the city you are living in and get a residence card (Aufenthaltstitel) as proof of registration. You will keep your British passport and may get a job at the NAAFI under British working conditions based on the NATO Security of Forces Agreement (SOFA).|`|ozJUrCiPaa	hi im an army wife too, who lives in germany, are the army giving both a flat or house?|`|9886899d6f135552d9c3c4f7e401043daa	Should be ok, we're all in the EU.<br>  My mum's Austrian and she's lived in the UK for 32 years.
nAeoCVgyaa	Not to worry. Spaniards are generally some of the friendliest people you will meet. Spaniards go to bars to chill out from their heavy work schedule, to socialise with friends, and of course to eat tapas, which you must try when you go there. Some of Madrid's bars are situated in the central part of the city along the Gran Via and Puerta del Sol which has a buzzing night life and is perfectly safe. The only thing you should be conscious of are pickpockets. Spain is notorious for them, the majority of them are of Romanian/Bulgarian descent. Don't let this deter you though, just be vigilant, and don't leave your handbag on the floor, or on a chair when you're in bars and restaurants.<br>  <br>  So be sure to soak up the Spanish atmosphere and enjoy every moment of it for however long you'll be there because Madrid is unlike any other city you'll ever experience anywhere else in the world! Also, if you get a chance, make sure to visit Barcelona! There's a lot to see there too, and is very beautiful. Madrid = atmosphere, Barcelona = culture|`|94b8KImYaa	They have a drink, eat some tapas and talk with each other. <br>  What do you mean by safe ? You expect people running in with machine guns ?

EBJkbitJaa	Only planned on coming here for 3 months, still here nearly 5 years later!  I enjoy living here.  It's safe and clean, convenient (24 hour shopping), cheaper than my home country, and now I suppose work is one of the main things keeping me here too.  Also, dig the food, many aspects of the culture, and it is the first time I have actively tried to learn a language.|`|l3wuqZwnaa	I suppose it is because there is something about the people and the place that I find is somehow in step with my personality. It is comfortable in a way I've not experienced elsewhere. <br>    <br>  I came here on vacation by chance and liked it very much. After my vacation I thought about it for about six months and then decided that I would regret not trying to live and work there, so I came over and I'm still here 10 years on.<br>  Initially I couldn't speak Japanese at all so that was a challenge, but I've studied, and continue to study, and that has made an enormous difference. <br>  <br>  Japan is not perfect and living here has not been easy, but it is a lovely, infuriating, confusing, and continually surprising, wonderous place. <br>  Most likely Japan finds me equally infuriating and confusing, hopefully with little snippets of surprise and wonder as well.<br>  <br>  I don't know what I'd do if I had to leave.  I do worry about growing old in Japan and how that is going to be. Most things work out though, I guess that will too.|`|AA11231409	I'm another one who's only here because my hubby is Japanese. We lived here once before, a few years ago, and he said we'd be here this time for less than one year. That was more than two years ago though.<br>  <br>  If it wasn't for him I'd go back to my own country, where at least I can communicate with the people around me. (That's not totally selfish, he speaks English very well and it's never been a problem for him when we lived in English speaking countries.)<br>  <br>  That's not to say I don't like Japan though, it's a lovely place with nice people and a good low crime rate. I feel much safer here, but I just dread people speaking to me.|`|HkWTYhjDaa	Because my husband is a Japansese.|`|0eT9mNhdaa	Because I'm an otaku who likes anime too much.|`|AA11286432	It was a career advancement decision.

4NxXKJBjaa	Softbank's White Plan is going to most likely be your best bet.  The basic plan is very inexpensive (￥980/mo), calls to family members are free, and calls within Softbank's network are heavily discounted (though rates to other parties are more expensive).<br>  <br>  If you take basic handsets that are not the newest models you'll get off very inexpensively on costs.  Subsidies on handsets have been cut quite a bit but older model handsets are still relatively cheap.
X4hz3a9haa	i think its a good idea to use different cars to learn in as it will prepare you for when you buy a car of your own in the future, but if your concerned you can ask to use the same car each lesson. your paying them for a service, so they will want to be helpful.|`|PiMcAb0Haa	hi there<br>  really you should drive the same car as the one you learn in.

Obviously all the cars have the same equipment - steering wheel, pedals etc but they also have different biting points and some things may be in different places. The reverse gear in our car is in a different place to the car my driving instructor had. Your instructor should know this and should not be making you practice in different cars. Good luck on the test anyway|`|oKFAt7Lsaa	Its best to drive the same car all the time. By changing cars , especially to a larger car , you will have to learn how to judge its size for parking and general driving.Although its good experience, to drive all sorts of different cars that can wait until you have passed your test.<br>  This is an added complication that a learner does not need to have especially when paying for driving lessons.|`|JoTbfOnjaa	Tell them you would much prefer to stick with the same car for every lesson. It certainly can't help your self confidence to have to keep chopping and changing cars. A lot of experienced drivers take time to get used to a different cars, so a learner is going to find it harder still trying to adapt to a strange car.|`|AE9dKMEFaa	hi, i'm, learning with bsm and i have always used the same car, my instructor tells me that he has to change the car every 3 months so maybe this is why your car has been changed, but it should have been changed to the same model, if you are been messed about, just contact bsm and tell them how you feel, after all it's you that is paying..good luck

Either way, you won't cause any trouble or attract attention.<br>  <br>  Usually when I ride the subway, it's rush hour and people who beg are not on the train at that time. Also, the train is so crowded that they can't beg efficiently. Saturdays and Sundays are nights are common because there are a lot of tourists hanging around and it's easier to get money then.|`|4WdbOIa9aa	I always ignore them and never had a problem.

I usually get asked it a lot.
fM7CwTwzaa	Outstanding idea! Big weddings are just SOOOO overrated and such a waste of money.<br>  <br>  I'd suggest Zihuatenejo, or maybe Manzanillo. The reason I say Zihua is because they have some simply outstanding romantic boutique hotels, especially the Casa Que Canta and the Tides. Luxury and romance with unbeatable Pacific sunsets. I say Manzanillo because it's very, very mellow, upscale, beautiful, and well off the usual gringo path. <br>  <br>  Just a couple thoughts....|`|b3AZpHbnaa	to tell you the truth i've never been there.

It's got museums, the zoo, jewel box (flowers), boathouse restaurant (and renting a boat to paddle along the waterway in the park is fun if the weather permits). Here are a couple of Web sites:<br>  <a href="http://www.slfp.com/ForestPark.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.slfp.com/ForestPark.html</a><br>  <a href="http://stlouis.missouri.org/citygov/parks/forestpark/" rel="nofollow">http://stlouis.missouri.org/citygov/park...</a><br>  <br>  Laclede's Landing is the name of the area that the person who suggested the Arch was trying to think of, and it does have some bars, and kinda cool atmosphere. That's down by the riverfront in downtown St. Louis. <br>  <br>  Another area with bars, ethnic restaurants, shops, is the "Loop," an area around the 6000 to 6700 block of Delmar Boulevard (near Delmar and Skinker) at west end of St. Louis, east end of University City. Chuck Berry's show on March 18 is sold out, but he's there every month (see blueberryhill.com)<br>  <br>  Check out an Italian restaurant (I like Rigazzi's or Lou Boccardi's) in The Hill neighborhood (<a href="http://stlouis.missouri.org/thehill/);" rel="nofollow">http://stlouis.missouri.org/thehill/);</a> you can play bocce at Milo's Bocce Garden.<br>  <br>  Interested in Native American history? Go to Cahokia Mounds State Park just across the Mississippi from St. Louis (www.cahokiamounds.com).<br>  <br>  Folks rave about City Museum, but I'm pretty cheap, so I haven't been. <br>  And speaking of cheap, if you go to Union Station, check out the whisper arch at the entrance to the hotel. You can stand on one side of it, whisper into the wall, and the person on the other side of it can hear you. Cheap thrill.<br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|HBdHRC8aaa	Don't miss the Arch, not because it's super awesome, but because it's such a major thing for St. Louis. It would be like going to Chicago and not having deep dish pizza, or going to Disney World and not getting a picture with Mickey Mouse! : ) <br>  <br>  If you're in to science, go to the Science Center. It's free, as others have mentioned (although if you park by the main entrance, you'll have to pay for parking. There is free parking near the entrance in Forest Park, and several exhibits that you won't want to miss on your walk into the main area of the Science Center.) If you do go there, I'm not sure what exhibit is in the dome thing, but if it's still the dinosaur one, I would skip it. We went a couple of weeks ago, and it's basically designed for grade schoolers, with very little to do other than color their pages.<br>  <br>  There's some great shopping in St. Louis. One of our favorite places to go is St. Louis Mills Mall. In the Mills mall, there are several outlet stores (including GAP and Nike), as well as Cabelas and an indoor ice skating rink. <br>  <br>  Another fun place to go is to Historic St. Charles. There are TONS of shops there, and some things I guess related to Louis and Clark. We really enjoy that area. <br>  <br>  If you're into museums, there are several different ones in Forest Park. Also in Forest Park is a really great, FREE zoo! I've been to the San Diego Zoo, and I think the St. Louis Zoo is better. <br>  <br>  St. Louis has it's own style of pizza, and if you like pizza, I would recommend trying it! A lot of people recommend Imo's, but I don't like Imo's at all! I think the 2 best places to get St. Louis style pizza are Krieger's and Cecil Whittakers. If you go to Cecil's, go on a Tuesday or a Thursday, and you can get a large cheese pizza for I think $3.99. My husband and I always get two, and always ONLY cheese! For dessert, if you're here when it's open, try to find a Fritz's Frozen Custard. It's absolutely AMAZING!! We love it, but be warned, you'll have cravings for the rest of your life!<br>  <br>  I hope you enjoy your trip!|`|V6ZX6qseaa	The Arch, Forest Park, Union Station, Science Museum, Art Museum, City Museum, The Hill(lots of Italian restaurants), La bonne bouche(French restaurant), Around Busch Stadium, botanical Gardens, history museum.

Well worth your time and money!!1|`|wVoU5D05aa	The Loop, City Museum, Forest Park and Ted Drewes!<br>  <br>  <br>  AND There are NOT a lot of shootings in the downtown areaa round the arch.

The reference has a set of 4 for different types.<br>  <br>  The hair straightener needs a transformer. these are expensive and heavy and you need one powerful enough for the power rating of the straightener. <br>  <br>  I'd recommend you just buy a new straightener that works on 120 or 240 volts. they usually have a switch on them and are listed as "dual voltage". That is probably about the same price as the transformer, and is one less thing to haul around. With a dual voltage one, you just need another plug adapter. <br>  <br>  PS, most of the other answers are wrong, you do not need a converter for small appliances.<br>  <br>  .|`|kfMcRr1Vaa	try---<br>  <br>  walmart<br>  target<br>  radio shack<br>  amazon.com|`|TAjtr6otaa	You can buy a converter and plug your laptop charger into that.

Pike Place Market, the Public Library, the Space Needle, and Washington Mutual tower are all very fun to explore/look at.  You'll probably want to ride a ferry boat, too.<br>  <br>  Avoid Tacoma - it's the lint-filled navel of Western Washington.<br>  <br>  Go see Mount Rainier!  Seriously, the mountain is gorgeous at any time of the year...it's like walking in a calendar when you visit the park - there is nothing more impressive than looking across glacier-created valleys at a ice-covered volcano that blots out the sky. The paradise visitor's center is a must for anyone visiting the area, and very easy to get to.  See if you can get someone to point out the "elk head" on the West side of the mountain. <br>  <br>  The cities on the coast are pretty fun in the summer, but more tourist traps than anything else.  If you live on the East Coast, you probably won't be too impressed by our beaches, but places like Pacific Beach are fun and off the beaten track a bit.  A ferry ride through the San Juan islands would be a great way to see the sea - especially if you can go whale-watching.<br>  <br>  I'm assuming you're visiting Western WA, but if you go to the OTHER SIDE, try to stop at Grand Coulee Dam.  Very impressive.<br>  <br>  Have fun!  And make sure you pack everything from parkas to shorts.  I'm looking out the window right now at snow, and two hours ago it was a clear, warm, sunny day...|`|GktbBr4Oaa	Well there's the obvious Twilight places like Forks, La Push, Port Angeles, Seattle and that sort of places really.

9rFLdntlaa	Okay lesson 1. You're looking for a state school if your child is between 5 and 12 and a state high school if 13 and over.<br>  <br>  Now there are good and bad schools no matter where you go. The important thing for you to know is this. Your children will generally be expected to go to the nearest school to where you live. Most schools have a boundary around them and will only take kids within that area. This is due to limited resourcing of public schools.<br>  <br>  The best bet is, decide which state you are going to live in, look at the areas and then do some research for specific areas. For example, if you decided to live in Hobart, you would need to some research  because you would want your child to attend Lansdowne Crescent Primary School because it is the best, however if you moved to the wrong suburb, your child might be forced to attend another school in Hobart like Bridgewater State School where all the bogun kids go. The school has a very poor attendance record, massive social and bullying problems and very poor resourcing.<br>  <br>  So, to ask generally for a good school in Australia is too vague. There are more than 15000 public schools in Australia.|`|AA12074269	Also public primary schools - you cant choose - the primary school in your catchment area is the one that HAS to take you. Nearby ones, might if they have not filled their quotas but you cant choose a particular school - private schools are another matter.|`|NyJeK6NSaa	Glenunga International High School (Glenunga IHS), now widely regarded as one of the best public schools in South Australia, was founded in 1898 as Adelaide Technical High School.<br>  <br>  <br>  I think you should pick the elementary school that offers the best fit for your child. The teachers should be warm and caring, the school as a whole should work with your child's temprament, and your child should be excited about learning there.|`|KZ30PZZvaa	Yeah, alot of the time (in melbourne atleast) you can't choose what school you go to ezaclty . Because most schools can only take a limited amount of kids, you'll probably have to go to the school that is closest to you or get your kid on a scholarship. It's hard to tell which is best. They'll show you tours around the school but will only show you the good classrooms. Hard to say unless you know what city you're going to live in.

I have a couple of picks for you that will hopefully fit for you.  All are very, very reasonable.  <br>  <br>  The two places that I like are sister properties in Negril.  Legends and Samsara.  There are cheaper places, but safety is a concern in Jamaica if you're an inexperienced traveller.  <br>  <br>  Samsara is on the cliffs just a short ride from the beach.  Its more secluded and spartan than Legends.  There's a free shuttle to Legends (on the beach) and vice versa at 10am and 4pm.   I usually catch the shuttle in the morning and hang out at the beach all day.  Then I catch the shuttle back to the cliffs and I find a nice locally owned place for dinner.  <br>  <br>  Legends is right on the beach and is a pretty laidback hotel.  The staff is great and comforting.  They're very friendly and will gladly talk about Jamaica with you.  There's plenty of inexpensive places to grab a meal--whether its i-tal or Western style.  <br>  I use travelocity.com to book my trips.  I haven't had a bad experience with them.  I generally pay $600 for a week w/air and hotel.  I fly out of a major hub in the midwest.  If you pay attention and sign up for email alerts, you can sometimes book a trip there for $510 or so. <br>  <br>  If you're thinking of moving there, remember that you'll need a TRN, work permit, and of course, meet the residency requirements.  The biggest obstacle most people have with moving there is money.  Jamaica is a developing country (I hate the term 3rd world).  The average Jamaican will be lucky to make $4500 a year.<br>  <br>  Most importantly, enjoy your vacation and make sure you experience the real Jamaica!!|`|Qtcgnwg8aa	Go to bookit.com trust me!!

xIHgTqVhaa	I'm a former Flight Attendant and I fly alone with my three children about twice a year between Europe and California, which is 11 1/2 hours. I either have to connect or take a 2 hour bus...<br>  <br>  Three is a good age to fly. They are more reasonable than toddlers. I have never, ever had any problems with any of my children's' ears on any of the flights we've done. I also rarely saw it as a Flight Attendant working long-haul international flights. It's very overrated as a problem. <br>  <br>  Please make sure to schedule a doctor's visit before going. Heathy ears can handle pressurization changes but blocked ears are horribly painful and no amount of sucking will help. <br>  <br>  For adjusting ears, a common myth is that the child is supposed to drink during take-off and landing. Their ears have much more time than that to adjust. Please do not wake him if he falls asleep, especially on take-off (they often do). <br>  <br>  In fact, in your long journey, just let him eat, drink and sleep when he wants. Don't keep him up thinking it will make him sleep on the long flight. This can backfire. <br>  <br>  You can bring toys but nothing that makes noise. Bring snacks too and an empty sippy cup to use on the flight. Bring a water bottle and drink it before security. You wont be able to take it through.<br>  <br>  Cold medications to help children sleep can work but it can also go horribly wrong. Benadryl landed me in the emergency room at age 7 since I'm one of the many who are allergic. I twice saw children go wired from these drugs. Yes, they can have the *opposite* reaction. <br>  <br>  Talk to your doctor and get advice on this. The dosage should be much smaller as drugs are stronger at altitude. I suggest a medication he has taken many times. I obviously never used anything for my own kids (given my history) and I personally didn't find my 3 year olds that difficult (18 months- 2 years is a different story!) <br>  <br>  For more information, I wrote an article on this subject. It's based on both my personal and professional experience of flying with kids. It's totally non-commercial and other parents have contributed;<br>  <a href="http://flyingwithchildren.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://flyingwithchildren.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  An edited version appeared on the Expat Women website in December;<br>  <a href="http://www.expatwomen.com/mothers/flying_with_children.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.expatwomen.com/mothers/flying...</a> <br>   <br>  Both of you get plenty of sleep the night before and good luck!|`|dTAQYe2daa	Give him Benydrl (sp?) it will make him sleep.|`|3Wxx2FPkaa	Personal experience, if you take window seat, the child will enjoy seeing outside and will not bother you.

You will then find the best rate but don't expect much for it.<br>  You can also try flying direct (no on route changes) also try landing at more out of town airports (such as easyjet does).

17236f2a8f333b3a2a3252e2a5c82aabaa	It is a common misconception that California is warm all winter long.  Every part of the state has a very noticeable winter season, except some parts does not have snow.  San Diego is the furthest south so it would have the most Mediterranean climate. <br>  <br>  I live in the Los Angeles area and last night some parts of the city got down to the high 30's and the predicted high for today in in the mid 60's. <br>  <br>  Remember also that California is now the most expensive and highly taxed place in the country. The cost of living here is roughly 50% higher than in most other parts of the country, and we also have the highest unemployment rate (10%), Jobs are almost nonexistent.|`|pTLcvsVfaa	Southern Californina has the warmest climate. San Diego is mild year round. About 65-70 in winter, and only 75-80 in the summer. Inland souther cal can get chilly in the winter, and MUCH hotter in the summer.<br>  <br>  If you are looking for the best climate, SD is where you should go.

Places I'd suggest you not miss are --<br>  obviously the Statue of Liberty & Ellis Island<br>  a Broadway play (get 1/2 price tickets at TKTS)<br>  Times Square at night<br>  Empire State Bldg<br>  Central Park<br>  World Trade Center site<br>  China Town / Little Italy<br>  a walk across Brooklyn Bridge with a stop at Grimaldi's for pizza on the Brooklyn side<br>  shopping at your favorite store<br>  make sure you have a slice of Juniors Famous cheesecake<br>  and don't go home without having a street vendor hot dog<br>  I don't think it's a good idea to bring much cash -- all you need it for is buying food from a street vendor, tips for the bell hop/doorman at the hotel and 1/2 price Broadway tickets -- otherwise use your credit card  <br>  <br>  I grew up in Chicago but lived in Tulsa for a few years as a teen and now live in the Dallas area, so I know coming from Oklahoma what a big deal this trip is for you. NYC is amazing. Enjoy<br>  .

17236f2a8f333b3a2a3252e2a5c82aabaa	Stay in New hampshire. California is a basket case financially speaking. The recession has hit us harder than most other states. Unemployment is the highest (10%) in decades, and jobs,are almost impossible to find. We are now he MOST expensive and highly taxed state in the dountry. This is NOT the time to be moving to California.<br>  <br>  By the way, we do NOT call our state "Cali". That is a drug city in South America, and most of us find that reference to our state insulting. We call it "Cal".|`|IvMPh09baa	uh... if you haven't read the newspaper or checked the news lately, then you must not know.  but california is really not a prime place to live right now, taxes are increasing, jobs are decreasing and businesses here are struggling.  if you dont have a job, and also dont have money its going to be hard to survive here.  we are a big state with alot of people, and alot of californians are looking for jobs as well.... so if your looking for a job, be prepared to compete with alot of people for work.  <br>  <br>  i think... well i wouldnt recommend it right now, with this economy its hard to survive in california... alot of californians are trying to leave this state, not stay here.|`|e6deba47bc9cb7fb188c260b4681f676aa	I live in the same area.  You should check Craigs List for SF area to check out availability of jobs.  There are a hundred applicants for one position.  Retail stores are closing, and CA is in the top 5 for the highest unemployment.  Maybe now is not the time to make a change.  If you dont have a degree, finish school, then your job options will expand.  Good luck.|`|3c7af99d45cd29de4b5830261c158f92aa	I would stay in New Hampshire and join the Free State Project.<br>  But I'm looking for freedom, what are you looking for?|`|AA11307565	No....stay home|`|RFK9sG6zaa	Just Do It !!|`|EEfd3WLhaa	I moved to San Fran from Michigan (where unemployment is among the highest) and am very glad I did.  I don't know about the rest of the bay area, but here in the city there are jobs.  Recently my work closed for business, but the next day I found a new job.  Minimum wage in the city is almost $10/hr so even if you find a retail position, it is usually around $12-15hr.  I would say go for it...worst case senario you have to go back.  <br>  GOOD LUCK!

AA10353250	A couple of towns meet your requirements. El Valle, and Volcan come to mind. They are both in the low mountains. El Valle is closer to Panama City. Volcan is about a five hour drive away. Both are little towns with one super market and little shops and a hand full of restaurants.  You will have to get into the outdoors life style there as there is really nothing else to do.<br>  <br>  Boquete is the darling of the retired, American community. More Americans live in Boquete than anywhere else. It is "spring like" all year round. But you might not like all the white haired gringos as it is THE retirement village.<br>  <br>  Stay away from Coranado. It is closest to the city, but it is not in the mountains, so the temps there will be hot, though cool at night.<br>  <br>  There is another "settlement" called Cerro Azul.  It is a wooded area, up in the hills, east of the city. It is cool there and it is more undeveloped. You might have a tough time getting broad band there. But the views of the city and the Pacific are nice and the woods are beautiful, not as much like a Jungle as in other places.  They have wild critters there, including snakes.<br>  <br>  At the far western border area are two villages, one is Bambito, the other is Cerro Punta. The former is a wooded settlement and quite remote and the latter is about as remote as you can get. It is the "bread basket" of Panama where most of the fruits and vegetables are grown. It is lovely too;.<br>  <br>  Of all these, I'd suggest El Valle. It is closer to the city, not as remote and has more of what you want and would like.|`|PmgQC0ptaa	You should go to Boquete, There are lots of american's and young people.<a href="http://www.boquete.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.boquete.org/</a>|`|AA10154693	I like El Valle.It's quiet and it doesn't get so humid like in the city.|`|U1SdGbGaaa	I am Panamanian and I live in Texas.  I will like to move back to Panama when I retire.  The city is absolutely out of the question, so dont apologize, I was born and raise there, and there is no way I could live there now.  Some of the nice towns are Santiago, Chitre and if you would like to live by the ocean then I recommend Bocas del toro.  IF you like the mountains you can try El Valle or  some place in Boquete.   IF you have kids, you might want to research more, education can be an issue, so you want a place close to a good school.|`|AA11774701	I would recommend Boquete which is a nice place. Check it.

TskZHzZyaa	I would take Amtrak over if you can.  It is very expensive to park a car downtown in Chicago, and it would be ideal to stay downtown close to everything.  If you can get a deal at Palmer House that would be a neat historic place to stay.<br>  <br>  You could fly and the nice thing is that the CTA goes to both airports.  If you're pressed on time that will give you more time here.<br>  <br>  Pricey but the neatest restaurant to go to is the Signature Room on the 95th floor of the Hancock.  Great food and views,.  You'll want to dress formally for that one; though it is not mandatory most everyone else will be.  A good budget restaurant I like is across the street in the Bloomingdale's Mall - Tucci Bennuch.<br>  <br>  Consider that if you do go to the Signature Room you can take in the views for a nice meal and save the $15 or so cost to go to the observation deck of the Hancock or the Sears.  If you do go the obs deck route do the Hancock - you see more from there as the Sears is so close to everything, everything is harder to see.<br>  <br>  The only club I know of is Excalibur - been there forever it seems.  A great thing to do is to go see the Blue Man Group at the Briar Street Theater.  They have a deal right now - two for $99.  Something everyone should do at least once.<br>  <br>  And of course we have great museums - most of which are close to downtown.  The exception is the Museum of Science and Industry but three Metra commuter trains go by rather frequently and it is a few blocks walk from the 55th street station to the MSI, through some nice park area.  You'll want to hang out at Millennium Park and see what a masterful place has been created for our dynamic city.<br>  <br>  If you're here for several days consider an evening in Chinatown, south of downtown along the red line to the Cermak/Chinatown stop.  If it's just a weekend that may be too much.<br>  <br>  We hope you have a great time!|`|AA11948690	Pick up a copy of Time Out Chicago magazine, or look at it online. They publish every week and list nearly everything that is going on in the city that particular week, including tons of free and cheap events, etc. I'm looking at the current issue right now and the cover advertises 411 free and cheap events listed. It's a great source. Most of  the listings also include how much, if anything, it costs, and even how to get there on public transportation if you're feeling adventureous.<br>  <br>  The magazine is broken down into categories so you cna look up the clubs section and it will tell you what kind of music the clubs plays and what the cover is, if any (a lot of clubs are free up until a certain time). As far as hotels, I'd just check a website like Hotels.com and see what you can find. If you find something you like but are unsure of the area, come back here and ask.<br>  <br>  As far as public transportation it may seem daunting but it's pretty easy to use. It costs $2.25 per ride per person. You can put money on a transit card, available at every train station or on the Chicago Transit Authority website, and use that to pay your fare. It's a lot simpler.|`|pdotzsPJaa	I'd start with Craigslist.com and look in the events section.  You can find ideas and purchase tickets from private or commercial sellers.
