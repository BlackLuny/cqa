But I've gotten to the point where I feel like people are plotting again me. I feel like people on here or even people in person etc etc are plotting again me, etc etc. It really bugs me, and I get so much anxiety.      also, I feel like everyone hates me. I feel like if I don't have the same opinion as other people then they will hate me. In a way, it's hard for me to say my opinion and have someone hate what I think, because then I feel like they hate me. I have had a rough life-- I was abused in my past, etc. But, I'm afraid for people to get to know me because I'm afraid people will hate me. There is no reason for someone to hate me at all. I'm kinda a weird person, but that's just because of how I was raised and what I've gone through. Anyway, I don't want to be going through this stuff anymore. It's really hard to deal with. I don't want to freak out everyday and be severely depressed because I feel like people hate me or are plotting again me. Why do I feel like people are plotting again me? It has only really getting bad just recently. Is this a sign of schizophrenia?      --and I've tried getting help for my problems.. therapy and even medication, and nothing has helped.

Here's the story:                      I am a 21 year old healthy female and for the last two weeks, I thought I was pregnant (The day of intercourse was January 14th). I had experienced weird sensations around my lower abdomen region, and a few days prior to when my period was due (It was due January 29th and came that day) I started experiencing dulling pain where my right ovary or fallopian tube would supposedly be located. I still have this dull pain, which is at times more intense than others, but is always there. I got my 'period' when I was suppose to, with quite a few clots the first day (sorry for the detailing). I have taken a few pregnancy tests to make sure, and got negatives, however, I've read of women who don't show a positive in a HCG test until they were like 9 weeks along. (For the record, I am not trying to conceive, but wouldn't mind the blessing, so please spare me the criticism   I know many people are going to suggest that I go to the doctor (which I am going to do tomorrow) but I just want to see if anyone has gone through something similar. I've searched the net to see if I found anything...               I don't think it could be appendicitis because the pain is not absolutely excruciating as associated with appendicitis. I've come across everything from ectopic pregnancy to a cyst and I really don't know what it could be.... Anyone have any ideas??? Thank you so much for taking time to read this.. I sincerely appreciate it, and I hope you guys can help me!

It usually only lasts 2 days but for those 2 days I am not able to function. I have to take an overdose of Ibuprofen and lay the whole day in bed with a heating pad. I've tried many different pain killers including a few prescription narcotics but nothing helps much. My other symptoms include (but not always) Diarrhea, vomiting, blackouts, cold sweats accompanied by hot flashes, and pain throughout my entire body especially my abdomen, thighs, and lower back. I have been to several Docs who have all done paps, blood tests, & sonograms to check for any cysts or endometriosis (not sure of the spelling on that one). They've found nothing. Recently  I have noticed that I will start spotting about a week or so before my period and even occasionally when I am ovulating. Does anyone have an ideas? Could there be something wrong with me that the docs are missing? Could there be some hormonal thing going on?Or is it that I am just a very unfortunate woman who gets bad cramps? Oh, I don't know if this has any relevance but my mom started going through menopause in her early 40's. Could there be some genetic correlation?

20090202112207AAh45jv	Health;Mental Health	What does my childhood dream mean?	When i was much smaller i used to have this nightmare over and over again every time i slept in my old bedroom. It would start with me just lying there most of the time i thought i had woken up,that's what made it so real. Then randomly voices started filling the room saying different things each time and most of the time meaningless for example the football scores from that day or something. Then the cupboard doors would swing open and something started like tickling me but really hard. so hard it hurt rather than made me laugh. i could never see what it was or where it was but once it started tickling me it wouldn't stop. So i would climb out of bed screaming and look into the hallway where my mum and sister would be standing, chatting. I'd scream for their help but they just can't hear and can't see me. So i use all my energy to struggle across the floor and as i would put my first touch outside the door of my room, i'd wake up. I'd be exhausted and sometimes wake up on the floor. The strange thing is it never happened if i slept any where else, just that one room. As i grew up hating that room i started to be able to even tell myself in the dream that i was dreaming and i should wake up because i know whats going to happen but i never could wake up until it was over. I moved rooms and after that i was fine and since have also moved house. i have never had i nightmare ever since. in fact my whole life i can only remember having 2 diffrent nightmares that one that kept happening and another random one. Was there some reason for this dream? Was it something to do with the room or was it my imagination?

20090202125158AA2FFv7	Health;Women's Health	A lot of Brown discharge?	*PLEASE PLEASE answer, bare with me on the long notes!*      Some Factors:   I've been in and out of the doctors for what they thought might have been a UTI or Bacterial Vaginosis. None of the four medications (just finished up 1 week ago) did any help but I have been drinking cranberry juice to help.    Also, I just started exercising on Thursday and the following day I got this discharge.       I am supposed to get my period on the 9th but a couple days ago I started getting a very heavy brown discharge, enough to fill up a whole tampon.  This is normal for me AFTER my period but NEVER before or even a week before my period for that matter.      This morning I also still have the brown discharge and I am beginning to feel the symptoms of a UTI again. I think this is because I stopped drinking cranberry juice.       I did have protected sex (condom) on the 24th and 25th, condom was checked for holes before and after and all was good, but I do understand there is still that chance. We used polyurethane condoms for the first time as well. We used latex the 1st time.      All my test run at the offices have suggested that everything is negative and looks fine but my gyno told me to consult a urologist because it looks bladder related.      But why the heavy, heavy brown discharge... what is going on with me?? and why am I getting is so early? I'm worried :(       any suggestions or experience with this?   ty in advance! :)

20090202140517AAcnVOr	Health;Diet & Fitness	Why am I not growing taller?	Why am I not growing taller?   18 years old male. Height ~174cm i.e. 5'7" (5 foot 7 inches tall).      I'm a lot taller than my mum, but not yet as tall as my dad. Most of my features resemble my dad but my dad is still taller than me by almost a foot (he is in his 40s now). Same as my grandfather, also as tall as my dad and I also have acquired his features too. My dad still plays football to date and used to body build when younger, but now he's a bit big around the belly lol. Anyway one of the features we share is metabolism, I have an extremely high metabolism which makes it hard to train/body build to gain muscle, or even fat, because it just burns so quickly, I can eat so much and it will have no affect on my weight yet if I don't eat then obviously I become a lot more skinnier as no energy/food/calories to burn. My dad was also like this in his teens but he and my mum both tell me that when he hit his mid 20s his metabolism slowed right down and that's when he started gaining the weight.      My mum also tells me that I started really growing (growth spurt) around 13 years of age.         Why am I telling you all this? I'm not entirely sure, just consider it some background info which *could* help. Lastly just a little more info; In the last couple of years my 'healthy living' has taken a huge plunge, as in, I don't exercise (unless you call walking everyday exercising...), when I was 14/15 I used to go training and boxing for 2 years and quit. A little while after joined gym and stopped after about a week. My diet/food intake is poor, i.e. very unhealthy I guess, I rarely eat fruits anymore (mainly junk foods), but I do consume copious amounts of water, I love water.      In the hope that the above may shape your answer, or any advice for that matter, I would be really grateful.      Question: Why am I not growing as tall as my dad and what can I do? I'm 18, will I continue to grow taller each year until around ~ 21 years of age? To be honest, I haven't actually measured how much tall I grow each year.

20090202140628AAyhaHz	Health;Diet & Fitness	Do you know a good workout for me?	Well, I've been doing cardio for a while but now I've hit a plateau and need more ideas. I usually do 3-4 days a week, rest in between, of straight 40 min jogging sometimes 60 min. Right now its not cutting it. So what can I do? I watch what I eat, drink lots of water and no soda at all, and I used to do weight lifting but my weights only went up to 15lbs...which really doesn't do much for me. Also, I used to do HIIT but that really sucked for me, it failed immensely I lost maybe 1 lb in a month and I'm pretty sure I was doing it right. So, is there anything you'd recommend doing? Like a good cardio workout? Oh and I can't really do push ups if that's something you were going to mention for a muscle workout. THANKS!!

20090202142758AA96lvg	Health;General Health Care;Injuries	Herniated Disk question?	Hi, I've had a bulging/herniated disk(not really sure since the doctor's I have seen for it seem to use them interchangeably) for 2 years now.  I was originally prescribed physical therapy that didn't do much for the pain after 2 months and continued home exercise. I then went on to see a chiropractor who worked my body like it was a pretzel and actually alleviated the pain.       I'm in college, 20 years old, I know it's rather young for this back problem, but I'm 6 foot 6 and an IT major so naturally I do a lot of sitting probably with poor posture.  The problem is I can't just get up and see my chiropractor due to distance and I dont want to go to one I dont trust.  I've had ups and downs with pain, and have only been bedridden from it once in the last 2 years.  Other than that it's really just a minor annoyance, and not nearly as bad of a pain as others seem to have.        I've done the stretches my chiropractor has given me religiously three times a week, and haven't had to take a pain killer in over a year, but the pain is still there, but not really affecting any part of my life. I just want to know if it should really take more than two years, or am I doing something to hinder the progress to a full recovery?

I've been seeing the dermatologist and doctor on and off for my acne for about 3-4 years now. When I went to the dermatologist 4 weeks ago he gave me 2 options: roaccutane or an isotretonoin gel (and then roaccutane if that didn't work). After hearing all the bad press about roaccutane I took the gel. But it's been a month and my face has got progressively worse since then. It is horrendous! I can't even look at myself and my face just looks like a mess of lumps, holes and explosions. My next appointment with the dermatologist isn't for another 2 months, how do I see him as soon as I can (nhs), preferably in the next few weeks to get this mess fixed with roaccutane.   (I've decided it's worth the risk after my friend had miraculous results with it.)

I've been doing that every day for the last 13 years and I have my own 'technique' of doing it. Recently I've got my first serious boyfriend and we do stuff, as in touch each other,etc. HOWEVER, I can never... org...a...s...m... with him. I always fake it,and it's been bugging me for ages. He is very gentle and he touches 'down there' in a different way than I touch myself alone. I prefere to please myself over my clothes and laying on one side, while he uses completely diff technique. And well.. it's just, I can't tell him that what he's doing is not right and that it does not satisfy me, as I am very..un-relaxed during the moments we get close and often stop the intimacy between us, so I don't wanna hurt him.   1- Am I abnormal for starting mastrubating so early and will this affect me in later life   and  2- Can I adapt my bfs 'technique' and reach the big O, or is my body too used to my old 'technique'?      --- Have in mind that this is very embarassin for me, but I just don't know what else to do.

Him and I were close friends until the abuse started and then I knew that he didn't care anymore.    I also feel that his mother mad things 100X's worse. On the phone she was like, "don't EVER call this house again or else I'll call ur parents. And oh, u harassed his friends and my son and i've been getting calls from parents about you."  I lost it and said, "ur son abused me" and then she started screaming at me over the phone how i was the abusive one. So even tho I took his abuse, I felt like she really threw me down in the dumps and I don't even know his friends.      Now I feel like I won't be able to trust a guy friend or anyone else for that matter of fact.  I'm hurting so much & crying all the time. I want to go back an apologize and ask for his forgiveness even tho I know I didn't do anything wrong and I was being abused.      Will these scars heal? Has anyone else been abused, and if so, how did you heal? Will  I ever trust again? Will I live with what he did to me forever.       Someone please help me. Thanks.

20090202154253AAyy2Bs	Health;Diet & Fitness	Is running a good form of exercise?	We currently have two months before our prom, and I would really love to tone up just a little before then.  Lately, about every night, I have been running again (I was on the Cross Country Team at school back in the fall) and afterwards I usually try to do sit-ups and push-ups (so far I'm up to 30 sit-ups and then 30 push-ups, but I increase by 5 every night) and I also just recently bought two 8 Ib. weights, and I do 30 arm bend thingys with those (sorry I'm not sure what the proper term for that is)  and thats bascially my exercise routine for the past week.  However, I just don't feel like I'm getting anywhere, (even though I know it takes time) and I'm just worried what I'm doing isn't right, like theres better forms of excercise I should be doing in order to tone up my arms, legs, and stomach.  Any one with any type of physical fitness experience or advice would be really helpful.  I just want to know if what I'm doing is going to pay off in two months, or if I should switch up my excercise routine???  I'm also currently on a diet, but I just started two days ago, so I'm trying to watch what I eat as well.  Any advice would be great though guys!!  I'm wondering if all this excercise and dieting will make a difference by the time prom gets here too...I know it's healthier for me, but I'm scared I'll still look the same as I am now.  I weigh 126 Ib. and I'm 5"3, so losing another 10 to 12 Ib. would be WoNdErFuL, but is it possible to do that in two month???  I'd love to look cute and skinny, because obviously I don't feel that way right now, and my arms look horrible, as well as my legs.  I just feel fat compared to all the other girls at school, and I was pretty happy when like two months ago I had finally managed to get down to a size 4 in jeans, but now I feel like I should be even smaller, like a size 2 or 3!!  Sorry I know I just bombarded this page with so many different questions, and A LOT of random, useless information, but I'm just very eager to find out whether what I'm doing now will work or not.  Thanks for any help guys, I really appreciate it!!

Hey guys well, the first time I was going to have sex with my girlfriend we spent like 2 hours (at least) with foreplay and all that time I (well, my "friend") was up and hard, ready for the action, both of us were naked and she was on top of me but just rubbing each other, BUT when we wanted to actually do it she asked me if I had a condom which i did and i put it on but by the time i had it on my penis wasnt hard enough anymore and we couldnt do it! I mean it was less than a minute and it suddenly wasnt hard enough to penetrate her...someone told me that it was the anxiety of my first time and that the next time I should be more relaxed BUT the thing is that I know myself and I know that when the time comes, if I start thinking about not being nervous, it is just going to happen again! so my idea is to use some pill or something to help me stay hard just this one time so I can overcome this situation with my girlfriend and kind of gain confidence...has any of you experimented this before?? any helpful comments??

20090202182901AAUObHC	Health;Women's Health	Girls did you know this?	not eating doesn't only get rid of your muscle mass and increase your fat per pound ratio, it also eats away your bones. When woman who were anorexic reach an old age, say around 50-60, they are permanently hunched over because their vertebrae is so weak and you will break your bones by simply falling down. Did you know this, and did my informing you of this fact make it any less likely you will stop eating?

20090202190324AAMLyy7	Health;General Health Care;First Aid	Gauze keeps sticking to wound - any tricks for dressing?	Per the doc - remove old dressing, soak, then apply ointment given & apply non-stick gauze, apply bandaid over the top.      Every night the old NON-STICK gauze is STUCK! I let it soak to make it more bearable to remove but it never really IS bearable. It sucks everytime. I carefully read the ointment directions & lightly wetted the gauze first (nothing for the ointment to soak into?)  before applying. I plan on dressing the wound in a few minutes so I have yet to find out if it worked.      Is there a trick to getting a wound to "let go" of a bandage (non-stick no less!)????

20090202164617AANIigJ	Health;Women's Health	Question about my period?!!?	Okay, I am 13 going on to 14 yrs old. I am a virgin. I had my period since 11 1/2. I get really bad cramps and backaches that midol can only make it to a dull pain ( i get sharp pain). Sometimes I have to lay down from the pain but overall I complain about it. I have heavy periods for the first 2-3 days sometimes more if it is a longer period. My period can very from 3-8 days long. Well I had my period 12 days ago with it starting out with a dark brown discharge than to a light hazel brown color, that period I had was only for a day and 1/2- 1/4 of the next day. I just got my period today at around 2:55 p.m. When I went to the bathroom at 4 or 5 today I had this blood clot hanging out of me so I kind of let it fall out of my self by just rocking my self and when it was about to fall out it was at least 6-12 inches long, than it shriveled up to a nickel size or a quarter size. Oh and my boobs are hurting really bad, feels like someone hit me there. Lastly, I have a bad headache that makes me feel like someone hit me in the head. P.S. I usually complain to my peditrican and she says it is all normal but this should not be happening right? Also, before I forget yesterday I was really tired probably from about to have my period, I fell asleep for two hours and I have really a hard time to fall asleep at night. Thanks to any one who answers my question, it really means a lot. ~Kay~

I'm 25 and have 2 great jobs which I love (65hours per week -don't tell me to cut down please, I cannot). I didn't study further than secondary (high) school. I am fairly clever and would like to persue further education later but at the moment am enjoying work (and the money) too much.    I have recently had a failed attempt at a relationship and looking at myself through her eyes, realised that I'm fairly dull. At 21 I was the life and soul of every party, a player and a dealer to boot. Since then i have grown up a bit, abandoned womanising, drugs and most of my old friends. Now I have a very small social circle and few interests.    I'll cut to the chase. I would love some suggestions based on your experiences of something you have done at similar junctures in life which kickstarted another phase of your life.   Like, taking up Tai Chi   Learning to play guitar   Joining a sporting club   Returning to church (I have done this and have found it enormously fulfilling by the way)      Also open to more eccentric suggestions -and more likely to follow!   Like, buy decks and learn to scratch,   Learn all the lyrics to every Wu-Tang Clan song   Go paragliding.       Yeah, in fairness I am fairly happy, but I just feel a little empty and unfulfilled. Perhaps it is just love I need, or do I need to get my head straight before I can find true love?      Remember I am tied to these jobs for a few more years at least.    Thanks in advance folks, any advice will be considered.      (I'm not going to go paragliding, I'm Irish, It's always raining here:D )
20090202134009AANJUwN	Health;Mental Health	Terrifying dream... someone help!!! (10 real points, 100,000,000 imaginary points!!)?	ok, so one night i had this dream. i was packing boxes at this old farmhouse that my family used to own with my step sister. apparently we were moving or something. (real life- one night she told me her dead grandmas spirit lived there but we were like 9) all of a sudden, she disappeared (i think she died actually...) and i was by myself in one of the bedrooms. around me, the walls start to smear and this really old armoir cracks and sets on fire. then the door starts spontaneously swinging back and forth faster and faster. there were voices (not human voices) yelling things at me, screaming. they were saying things in a different language but i knew what it meant (it wasnt a real language). it felt like i was being mauled by something but nothing was touching me. i woke up in a cold sweat screaming for my life.... could anyone pleasepleaseplease help me with what this could mean?? it absolutely terrifies me...

How & why?      Is there such thing as water toxicity by drinking over 96 oz. of water a day? That's what some lady told me. But I take Wellbutrin, & it makes my mouth dry, but she automatically ASSUMES I drink too much water. I don't even think I drink as much water as she thinks.       Ever since my faucet water situation, I've been buying bottled water. Drink about 4 bottles of Ozarka Spring water a day, & they're 1 pint & 0.9 fl. oz. Which is approximately 17 oz. of water per bottle. & I don't urinate enough. My urine is still dark yellow, instead of clear.       That woman doesn't know what she's talking about. Also, I still suffer constipation, irritable bowel syndrome, & SEVERE hemorrhoids that are always itchy enough to make me go crazy, & when I defecate, the veins swell, & I bleed there, & the tissue gets stuck, & then it starts to burn. It also burns when I take a shower, as well. Sorry for too much information, but I need to know what to do about this? My doctor is the only doctor in this small town who takes medicaid, & he never medically treats me properly, so I feel stuck.

20090202184101AAKUN5m	Health;Diet & Fitness	What is a good full upper body work out routine?	What I used to do was:   2 sets of pull ups   1 set of chin ups   2 sets of captains chairs   2 sets of dips   1 set of clapping pushups   1 set of diamond pushups   1 set of regular pushups   1 set of dive bomber pushups    2 sets of finger tip pushups   1 set of wide pushups   2 sets of bicycle maneuver crunches   2 sets of deltoid flys       However I was recently injured and put out of my workout routine for about 2 weeks, so now I'm thinking about starting a new routine.      The workout equipment I have are a powerack (complete with chin up bar, captain chair handles, and dip handles), perfect pushup units, a gyro powerball, and free weights.      The muscles I want to work are pretty much all the major ones in the upper body. I'm not worrying much about my lower body because I already run and hold very low, concentrated stances for martial arts.      Also, I don't use free weights for my biceps or triceps because my right side elbow can't take too much stress from a free weight, which is why I used to only do pull ups/chin ups. Also, I've tried many types of crunches and v-ups, but so far only the bicycle maneuver ones have worked the best because they don't stress my lower back.      Thanks in advance if you can help think of a more efficient routine for me.

I don't know, I guess I like the crunchiness and everything of the spaghetti, while I like the saltiness/overall flavor of baking soda. I know it's weird, but would this be considered pica? I mean, they're not totally nonfood items, but people usually don't eat them as they are.

Recently, to find a light way to bright some extra drink to work, without having to lug more juice containers, I got some of those single-serving Kool-Aid packages.      They say on them that they have 100% of the recommended daily dose of Vitamin C.      Just how MANY of these can you have within a day?  I tend to drink 2 or 3 (sometimes), and I don't want to over do the vitamin C.      [Note : I do drink other healthy things, and I barely ever have 'junk' food, and I just use it to spice up just plain ol' water when it's not a meal or a proper break at work]      Any help would be great to give this paranoid heart a good idea of what to do. :]

I had a CT Scan and ultrasound which came back negative for gallstones.

I am still having the same issues. My doctor said he would send me to see a surgeon if I wanted but don’t think they would remove it.

I used a Trojan Magnum condom (I have to use the larger kind or else it's totally uncomfortable.. It's not an ego thing) but didn't really add any lube.

I know he is experienced and I was thinking he would last a while in bed. Well the first time he came in about one minute. He told me how it was weird for him because that normally doesn't happen. The second time he wore a condom to see if it would slow him down but it didn't. He mentioned to me that its different when its with someone you really like. He also told me that there had to be something special about me that was making him *** so fast.      Will it actually make a guy *** faster if he really likes a girl?

20090202203404AA4Iz2i	Health;Mental Health	Why can't I forgive myself, do I even deserve to?	I've always had  a huge guilt complex, where I feel guilty for everything I do and am.  However, not too long ago I had my best friend randomly stop talking to me for months.  I've been there for her for years, even when she ignored me all that time.  I gave her space, but let her know I was there for her too.  Later she told our other friend she'd done it simply because she needed to take her anger out on someone.       While I didn't know what I'd done I felt horrid, just terrible.  I never told anyone because I didn't want anyone to be upset with her.  It came right at a time in my life when I already was having a breakdown that no one knew about, I'd been depressed (I just spent all these years listening to people at school and I just lost the true happiness I used to have) but acted really happy so no one would know.  I felt so terrible I used to beg my mom not to make me go to school, and then finally I couldn't take it anymore (I'd wanted to transfer for a couple years anyways), and I finished school at home (I kept up my straight As though, grades mean so much to me, haha, I don't want anyone to think I'd let her get in the way of my ultimate dreams).  So the guilt was inescapable and I cut myself for the first time, and I'd had an eating disorder throughout that year already.  Then after months she finally called me and just blamed me more and I apologized and took all the blame and I feel like if she'd just said, "It's okay," that I could forgive myself or if she took a tiny, minuscule amount of blame.  I'm still there for her all the time, but I just wish I could forgive myself.        Maybe it's the scars from cutting, I don't do that anymore.  Or maybe it's because she intentionally hurt me (she told me beforehand everything she does to people to make sure they know he despises them and she did all of that to me), she told me she was upset by the fact that I had all these friends who I talked to and all of this other stuff and I tried to explain but I just hated myself more after the call (I didn't think it was possible).  I never told her she hurt me or that I cut or anything.  I don't blame her at all, I just wish I could stop blaming myself.  Maybe I don't deserve to forgive myself anyways, but I have so much other guilt I just don't know.      Thanks so much for reading!  I'm sorry this sounds so selfish and lame.  Also, I'm sorry this is so long.  Thanks again!

Ok, I'm 16 years old, male, I have had weight issues all my life.   I am 6' 2", and 300 pounds.   The only other time in my life that I've lose weight was in 6th grade, I lost 30 pounds, and was at an ideal size (200 pounds, age 13, 6' tall) a few years after I lost this weight, but then I gained nearly 100 ponds in the next 2 years.   I don't want to say I'm desperate for help, but this has been an ongoing struggle for me for years, hence all the emotional eating (parents' divorce, lack of friends, school struggles,  etc..)   Anyway I really want to get back on track, but I'm afraid that I'm setting myself up for failure again, and I think I need a set plan of what to eat, when to exercise, how much exercise, etc...   Can someone, preferably someone who's lost weight successfully already, please tell me what your plan was, and what you did to succeed?   Thanks so much!

20090202195500AAgDdbE	Health;Mental Health	I think i'm having problems with Paranoia and/or depression?	Ok, well lately i've been feeling a bit weird, going really down for no reason and quite irritable.  The most common feeling emerging is paranoia.  I often get it into my head that peoples conversations are about me, especially if i'm being looked at or people are laughing nearby me.    I'm probably just being uber-sensitive, but i've got incredible low self esteem, which for the most part i hide from everyone i know, and i think this has contributed greatly to my problem.  I see so many flaws in my personality and looks its now impossible to be positive about either, and allthough if i'm complimented on how i look or told im good looking, i secretly love the attention but at the same time completely refuse to believe it.  You understand that at all?  It's pretty strange i know, i don't get it either but i don't know how else to explain it.      I have been prescribed Anti-depressants before, however i only took them for a month and left it after that mainly because i didn't want to get hooked or become dependent on them.      Has anyone got any advice or any similar experiences with this?  All greatly appreciated, thanks.

My other sympotoms are runny nose and i felt dizzy when i got up - but not anymore. I went to the doctor today and they tested for strep, mono, checked white blood count, and for sinus. These were all negative. So basically they dont know whats wrong. If I still have a temperature tomorrow I'm supposed to go back to the doctor for x-rays or something. I was just wondering if this has happened to anyone? Cause i feel fine but my face is bright red from fever that comes and goes.

20090202135302AA5HiBe	Health;Diet & Fitness	Your advice will be much, much appreciated.?	I have about three and a half months til Spring Break. I will be going on a cruise to the Caribbean with my grandparents and my cousin, whose the same age as me and a dude. I want to look beautiful and healthy during Spring and look alright in my bathing suit without feeling insecure. My goal is to lose 20-30lbs, clear most of my acne, and diminish the stretch marks I have on my hips in the 3 and a half months. I know my goal is a little high, but it's probably do-able in that amount of time.      I have asked this before, but haven't gotten enough ideas that I'm satisfied with.      Is there anything you can recommend? Diets? Recipes? Exercises? Acne medication? Creams? Moisturizers?      Thanks sooo much in advance!      And, by the way, I'm 13.

20090202193010AATcGhD	Health;Women's Health	How can i be more aggressive/arrogant? Well actually less passive i guess?	i know this is long but i would greatly appreciate it if yall read it and helped me out. thanks :)      ok so i like this girl and im pretty sure she likes me but is maybe playing hard to get or makin sure im the right person. but my friend who likes to give advice was like: she's an aggresive girl and wants someone just as aggressive w/ a touch of arrogance. i need to step up ur game if u want to date her. u need to talk to her with a little bit of a tone that says "yeah im the {insert f word here}in man.". Now im sorta the kind of person who just goes with the flow and laid back and all. so how can i be this more aggressive and a little bit arrogant that he's talkin bout? i guess he means just be less passive. but he's the kind of guy who says all kinds of disgusting things and does disgusting and rude things around girls and yet girls still like it so i really dont understand that. i cant be an a** or anything cause thats just not me. i just need to be like he said. but does that mean pick more dates on my own or be sweeter to her and pick more dates and make the first move or what? (which reminds me when should i make the first move? is it alright to make it while were watchin a movie or out somewhere with friends or is it best to do it while we're alone at the movies or something? cause alot of ppl act like its ok to do it around friends but i always thought that might startle her and make her a little embarrased or something even if she did want it?) and the arrogant part is what i really need help with because the only thing im really arrogant about is running because i know that i can kick anyone's a** at it and academics too, but not as much, but still im very smart and so is she. so does he mean brag about myself more because if so im not going to listen to him cause thats just not me. so if anyone could give me some advice about all this ide really appreciate it. thanks :)

20090202194815AAS9MWC	Health;Optical	I'm not sure whether my sunglasses provide UV protection...?	I got them in a $27 deal at the mall(from those little stores in the middle of the walkway). When I bought these I was just looking for durable sports sunglasses with reflector lenses. The salesman said the sunglasses they were selling offered UV protection briefly-I bought them rather quick and I didn't ask in detail about it with him.      Later I examined them more in detail...   It says from China - so I don't think it means necessarily that it should follow standards for having 100% UV protection for all sunglasses like the CE label-(the European certification). But it sort of looks the fake CE label which stands for China Export.      I forgot exactly what brand it was, NY something. Surprisingly, it doesn't even have the brand name on the sides of the sunglasses- all it says is       2655 Cat. 3 China      Nothing about the brand name or UV protection. I wore them for one day in just a period of a few hours outside, and my eyes feel a tad sore, I can't be sure if its lack of sleep or whatever.      I also tried to search for these sunglasses by model number above online, and I couldn't find anything.      These are sport sunglasses with metal frames (silver color), reflecting lenses(gray/silver color), clear plastic ear-ends, the brand or the store I got from said N Y - something like that... with label: 2655 Cat. 3 China      They really look good and I would hate to have to return or get rid of 'em.      Any ideas?

I've been working my butt off to control my blood sugars for the past 10 years to the best of my ability despite dealing with severe anxiety issues and being a full time college student with a lot going on and no free time. My endocrinologist has been suggesting the pump and I too agree that I need a change when it comes to how I'm getting my insulin to help control it better, and not have to take so many shots but my doctor says I can't get one because my A1C's are 9. Anybody else have this issue? I don't know it just seems like its odd because the pump is supposed to help with lowering A1C's.

I understand that once you do the cleansing you can easily gain back all the stuff stored in your stomach again if you don't eat well, but how long does it take to actually gain it all back ?

20090202200034AAdmIfB	Health;Mental Health	Question for people who don't drink/drink rarely and former alcoholics? ?	I am a pretty heavy drinker, and I am starting to realize that I may have a problem.  I never really thought that I was an alcoholic because I don't have the "classic" symptoms of alcoholism, I don't miss work and I don't drink every day etc, but I am noticing that alcohol is starting to get in the way of my life. For example, I don't have children even though I really, really want to because I am scared I can't stop drinking while pregnant. Every weekend my plans revolve around drinking. I don't do things I really want to do because I am already drunk too early. I drink every single weekend, most of the time Friday and Saturday, at least 8+ drinks. I have been doing this for yeeeears.  Two months ago I drank 15+ shots and couldn't even remember parts of the night, there were pictures of me with my friends, smiling and somewhat posing for the pictures, that I have no recollection of. I have done so many dumb and embarrassing things and I never want to feel that way again. I want to stop, I want to be healthy! I'm so tired of feeling like crap all the time! I want to change today.    So, my question is this--what do you do in your leisure time? I was just making a list of things I can do with my boyfriend instead of drinking, and all of it leads BACK to drinking. For example-Go to the movies-My first thought is get some drinks before we go. I understand that this isn't going to be easy, I just want to know what normal, healthy people do in their spare time. I have absolutely no hobbies, and I think this makes me drink more. What are some things/hobbies that you do instead of drinking? Should I go to a support group as well?    Thank you in advance! Please wish me luck!

20090202200637AAxAqVx	Health;Other - Health	Is it common to be violent when waking up from anesthesia?	I am going in for surgery on the 13th (Friday the 13th, yes I know) and I am worried about going under anesthesia.       I have had several surgeries in the past and I tend to have an adverse side affect to anesthesia. When I first start waking up I often become very violent. I am 20 years old and I have had 4 previous surgeries.       When I become violent I have absolutely no clue what I am doing. I am fully aware of what is going on and I remember it after the incidents but in the moment I feel so "out of it" that I have no control over myself.       The latest surgery I had I warned my doctor about it; as I have harmed nurses and doctors before, and he said that it was no problem and that it was common for people my age to be violent. So his remedy was to strap my arms, legs, and torso to the bed. Well, it really only intensified my anxiety. I had a full on panic attack on top of the violence and trying to get out of the restraints. I had bruises and cuts from the straps the next day.       This does really concern me and I am wondering if it is normal. It can be very traumatizing because I feel so awful for what I have done. I've broken a nurse's nose, and harmed doctors and myself in these fits of rage.         Is this normal? Why do I do this? Is there something I need to suggest to my physician that is being overlooked?

The first one was the Adenovirus outbreak which is still going on and could be of a sometimes deadly strain.  Then now there's something else out there, I don't know what it is but it involves coughing and fevers, might be a strain of the flu.  Anybody else seeing people dropping like flies?

The injury occurred in october of 2008, I was playing football and then i got tackled and landed on my wrist. It got swollen up and I couldn't move it all without pain. I thought it was just a sprained wrist so i didn't go to the doctors until 2 months later in december the doctor told me that its fractured and i will have to do surgery on it and put pins in my wrist. The doctor also says that it wont heal on its own but other people tell me that it will.  now in febuary 2009 the swelling has gone away but when i bring my wrist back all the way it hurts Ive also been weightlifting everyday since november 2008 with my fractured arm and i don't have any major pain while working out. the only thing that hurts is push ups and bench press and i don't do those any more. So in your opinion should i go with the surgery or try and wait it out? Im 16 yeas old by the way

20090202204331AAEyf3U	Health;Mental Health	Any answers help! PLEEEASE!?	Alright, I'm obviously depressed, I know this. I've been told by three psychologists, and one psychiatrist.      Background: I'm 18, I've lived with my mom for my whole life, and when I was 16 she passed away. She had been battling cancer for 12 years, and she got admitted to Hospice on my 16th birthday and died a week later. I've been battling depression since I was in 7th grade (around age 12). My mom was an only child, her dad was an only child who died when she was four, I have an older brother who ran away and stole from my family and got a felony for it. And her mom got put into a psyc hospital a month after my mom passed because she had/has early onset Alzheimer's disease. I've never really had a good or any kind of relationship with my real dad. I don't really have a big family to surround myself with. After her death, I lived with my step dad, but when my mom's family contested her will he threw me out. Then I moved to my dad's and was so depressed and started skipping school, one day my step dad came into my school and told me I could move back in. So I started to be happier. And then a year later it all went back down hill when my step dad and I got into a fight and i got kicked out/moved out. But I graduated high school, with alright grades. Before the summer my mom died, I kept a 3.87 GPA, and throughout my Junior and Senior year it went down and I graduated with a 3.24 GPA. Oh and I stopped believing in religion when I was Sophomore because my mom's cancer had gotten really bad, and before that I used to be very religious.      Okay so now I live with my real dad and absolutely hate it here. I'm so lonely. It's an hour away from my hometown and I haven't really met anyone I click with at my new college or job. I did have a boyfriend for almost a year, but I recently broke up with him because I have major trust issues.       So my question is, how do I get happy?      Going to a psychologist/therapy doesn't really work for me because I haven't found one that I can be myself with and I went to all the ones my insurance will pay for within an hour drive from my house. The reason I can't be myself around them is that I have a very hard time trusting people, especially around new people. I know they don't judge me but I don't know why I can't but I just will shut off to them.      Help. Please and thank you.      Oh, the reason I ask this is it has gotten really bad lately, I cry myself to sleep 3 times a week, and I had two anxiety attacks in the last two weeks. Oh and I have these little attitude outbursts, like this sounds silly but I got so frustrated over nothing because a microwavable burrito didn't cook like it should have so I demolished it with my hands and threw it at the wall. They've been happening for like a month and it is not usual for me. Not at all. And I can't sleep much anymore, and my focusing is SHOT! its so hard to focus on anything! even as simple as driving or eating which are both simple :(

20090201155407AAtqXFg	Health;Women's Health	As always, a period question.?	My period has skipped about three and a half months now. I know that I am not pregnant, because I'm not sexually active. The same thing happened last winter, but then it came back before I got to ask my doctor about it.      It usually skips one month over every six months or a year.      I assumed it was just hormones because I'm still a teenager, but my friends were a little shocked when I told them and I've had my period for four years now, so I figured it might have already evened out. If it means anything, I gained a little weight in the last year. However, it wasn't much and I'm not overweight or underweight.      Stress ? Hormones ? A serious disease ?   Please tell me if I should be too concerned. Thanks.

So for about a month and a half now ive been on a low carb diet (<25 carbs a day and 1200 calories/day) I work out 5 times a week and i lost a good amount of fat and weight. before that i was on a non low carb diet and lost about 30 lbs. I noticed that my muscles were showing a lot more and were harder. Today i completely stopped this low carb diet and upped my calorie intake to 1500 and im eating around 120 carbs a day but they are complex carbs.

20090202123828AAGiRM3	Health;Mental Health	What addiction has my mum got?	Everyone knows what a 'shopaholic' is right? The word is over used all the time, mainly by us women, who when expressing their love and lust for shopping they call themselves 'a shopaholic'. It is a word that now has very little serious meaning to it. It being a very real addiction, of someone who shops way beyond their means, and get's them selves into serious, life threatening debt.     This is what my mum does. She has done for the last 20 years. Now she is in the worst financial state she has ever been in. She is the ultimate 'debt-aholic'. I'm pushing hard for professional help form all angles, but what do we 'call' her? What would you guys call her? I know it's a 'label', but that is what we need right now. We need a name for what she is.... Thanks

20090202142712AA8qDi9	Health;Mental Health	Co-existant depression and ADD?	I think I've always had a bit of ADD, but the last 2 years its been ridiculous. I think its because I'm also really depressed, but I can't focus on anything for more than a few minutes. I can't even watch a movie! My psychiatrist doesn't want to prescribe ADD meds, but I think I need them. My inability to focus is fueling the depression and vice versa. What should I say to increase my chances of getting them?

20090202112356AAfQlV9	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Skin Conditions	Are skin, hair & nail vitamins worth taking? ?	I'm not really into taking vitamins as I usually think a balanced diet should be enough. I do like other food supplements such as evening primrose oil and cranberry, but Boots had a 3 for 2 offer, so for free I picked up some Skin, hair and nails vitamins and minerals. I was wondering if you can really see a difference in the skin and hair by taking supplements like that?

My niece is 13 and she has a very irregular period.  it comes and goes, some days heavy, others light.  it stops, then she spots and it catches her by surprise!!   she wants to have a regular period of whatever number days and then stop until the next month... well she went to the doctor with her mom and the doctor gave her birth control pills to regulate her period.   I am very worried because of the hormones those pills contain, i personally get vomiting attacks from b/c pills.  My sister told her that she might retain water and look fatter *eyeroll* but as far as I am concerned that is the LEAST of her worries since those pills are FULL of hormones!!   what should i tell my niece to convince her to not take those pills, and what do you think ???

My mom is also 5'8 and my dad is a solid 6 foot. I really wonder what my final height might be. My dad says he thinks that I'll be about 6'1 or 6'2. I would really be happy if I turn out to be 6'2". But I would have to grow about 5 or 6 more inches. And I've also heard that men stop growing & reach their max height until the ages of 20 to 24.   Anyway, how tall do you guys think I'll be?  Thanks.
20090202142935AACONkU	Health;Mental Health	Can a person with anorexia be involuntarily commited to a psychiatric hospital in Texas?	My family and friends belive that I am suffering from anorexia.  I began seeing a counselor (LPC) nearly three months ago.  Since doing so, I have lost more weight.  I have also begun passing out almost daily.  I am afraid that my counselor could consider this as being a "danger to self" and commit me.  I have not yet seen a physician to be diagnosed with anorexia.      I know that anorexia is not good.  I am working on the mental issues, but I am not ready to regain all of the weight I have lost.  This worries me that I could end up in a hospital.  I am over 18 years old.
