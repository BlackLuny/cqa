We rented a house and we haven't moved in yet, since we still have our current place til the end of the month. We tried to get our utilities set up for today. We went and there was nothing on, no water, no electricity. We called the electric company and they said that a city inspector needs to go down there first before we can get services. What exactly is the problem? This rental is turning into a nightmare. We also had our mail forwarded a few days ago and we never got any mail. It turns out the mailman told them that he wouldn't deliver to the door anymore and they needed a curbside mailbox, and they hadn't put it up yet. Another thing is that they previously lived in that house, and they still have junk laying around inside and outside. What are we supposed to do with the stuff, I don't like having too much junk laying around? But my main question is, do we tell him to give us a discount for next months rent since we aren't able to get utilities hooked up, and for obstructing our mail delivery?

20061202080140AA5lm8S	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment	My boss always appraoch assistant accountant rather than me, a three months accountant....?	I have just recently joined a new co. The co culture is complete different to my previous company. I have been asked to work late... and althought given an accountant post, i am sometime asked to do some accounts assistant works... worst still, there is not other accountant but another assistant accountant in my department. For past three months with the company, my controller always(most of the time) approach the assistant accountant rather than me whenever he needs help. I am very piss off with all the job arrangement and treatment. Personally,I don't think i am not performing, but if opportunity is not given, i don't understand why they create an accountant post.    I keep telling myself to bear with the company, but the long working hours culture draw me back from staying with the company. I am wondering what's the reason for my boss not appraoch me... why do they hire an accountant to do simple job.. why dun they just promote the assistant accountant.. i am in a lost.

My ex and I have a joint credit card and when we broke up he took my card and cut it up, then changed all the account information so that I couldn't get on the account online, and he changed the mailing address so that I wouldn't get the statement. After checking my credit report, I found out that he hadn't been paying the bill every month, and now I've paid about 200.00 to this credit card which is at almost 900.00 but the limit is only 650.00. I called Best Buy yesterday and they sent my file to collections. I've been talking to them and have set up to pay half of the bill and my ex is refusing to pay half. Is it illegal for me to give the girl at collections his bank account number if I have it? I'm not sure what I can do here. There is also a second card that was completely paid off and he spent over 200.00 on it and never paid the bill and now it's at 600.00. On top of all of this, he never paid the electrictiy bill in our apartment and since I set up a new account they've been charging me and I'm not paying it. It's not my fault he didn't pay his last bill. What can I do about all of this??

There's a job I like in Career Builder and there's a phone number. I called the contact but he did not answer so I left a message. In the job description, there's no official address but it says the name of  the company and the location and so I googled it  and it appeared the address for that company.      Question is, I can't wait to apply and today I know I don't have time to go and mail and print my application...is it proper to send my cover letter and resume through fax or email to them??? Or is it more considered if I print them out and send them in envelope??      Thanks!
