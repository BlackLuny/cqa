20090223112611AAU2dJK	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	IS there a place where I can sign a petition against affirmative action?	I am not racist and I am a Liberal. I just feel that affirmative action is no longer needed, and it is only hurting poorer white peoples. If my son went to apply for a job at McDonalds , he is less likely to get it because he is white. I was told that business are paid , to hire other groups of minorities and not one. In my opinoin White Men are a minority especially in a big city, because the Minorities outway the white peoples and the poorer white person. I believe everyone should have an equal opportunity, and being hired should not be based on ones race, but wether or not they qualify for a job. Where can I go to petition against this, or to atleast make it more fair, so poorer white people are somehow fit into the loop, aswell.

20090223112746AA9boEP	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	My ex is defaulting on our auto loan- the divorce papers say he's responsible for the payments...please read?	His truck is about to be repossessed and he never refinanced the loan into his name only, but our divorce papers say that he is responsible for the loan payments. So if the truck gets repossessed and he and I are taken to court for a judgment by the finance company, what is the likelihood that the judge will rule that I don't have to pay the company back, since according to our divorce judgment, he's supposed to be responsible for it? I'm afraid they will garnish my wages, since he is now unemployed, and I cannot afford it. He pays me no child support, nothing. It would be highly unfair to burden our children with the penalty for his irresponsibility. He was fired and never seems to be able to keep a job, by the way. What would the judge likely rule in a case like this?

I got a speeding ticket in a small town driving from Norman, OK to Fayetteville, AR and they didn't write how much it was going to be on the back of the ticket. Someone told me when they leave information out or forget to put it on then a lot of times the ticket wont count because they messed up on paperwork. Anyways I called and they said that didn't matter that they normally don't put the amount of the ticket but then they told me it will put 2 marks on my driving record, and this will make my insurance go up a lot. I asked what I could do to not let that happen and the woman said I have to drive back there, and go to court and ask to have it deferred and then I'll have to come back in so many months and prove I haven't had a speeding ticket since. She also said that the judge might not let me have it deferred. I had a speeding ticket 10 months ago and took defensive driving so it wouldn't go on my record, but I was wondering why the judge wouldn't let me have it deferred?

20090223113138AATEvdH	Politics & Government;Politics	Is this the kind of "hope" and "change" you liberals were hoping for?	Siding with Bush, Obama says Afghan detainees have no U.S. rights   The 600-plus detainees at Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan cannot use U.S. courts to challenge their imprisonment, the Justice Department said today in a two-sentence court filing.       Last summer the Supreme Court gave al-Qaeda and Taliban suspects held at Guantanamo Bay the right to challenge their detention. But the Justice Department argues that Bagram is different: it's in a war zone and the prisoners are the result of continuing military action.      "They've now embraced the Bush policy that you can create prisons outside the law," said Jonathan Hafetz of the American Civil Liberties Union, who has represented several detainees.      "The hope we all had in President Obama to lead us on a different path has not turned out as we'd hoped," said Tina Monshipour Foster, a human rights attorney representing a detainee at the Bagram. "We all expected better."      The decision also disappointed Amnesty International, which issued a report calling for judicial review of the detentions.

Is Freecreditreport.com going to go out of business since obviously credit doesn't matter anymore in America??      Last time I looked my credit rating is somewhere in the mid 700's.  My neighbors were 4 months behind on their mortgage.  They moved out of their house and flat out abandoned it.  I pay all my bills on time every month and my interest rate is 4.9% which for my bank and area is the lowest possible rate.  My neighbor has a credit rating so bad I would imagine is doesn't even show up.  And I realized they moved back in over the weekend.  They came and talked to me.  The bank in anticipation of the bailout have let them move back in to their home.  They knocked off 30% of their initial loan amount and have a special interest rate of 3.5% she said.  I didnt' believe her and she actually let me see the papers and she wasn't lieing.  The lady has a sales and marketing degree and she has always worked for some scrapbooking company so she is flat out lazy she didn't lose her job.      Why did I spend my whole life paying off credit cards every month and paying my mortgage on time when I could just have been lazy and gotten this. Does anyone else have a situation like this?

The 62 year old sheriff was driving around with his 17 year old girl friend giving her vodka out of a mountain dew bottle:       http://www.hdnews.net/wirestories/o0124-...       My problem, as a registered republican I can't vote in a sheriff's race. So even if I sign the petition to oust him I get no vote to his replacement. So does it serve this area right to have a freak as a sheriff because only democrats can vote?      The sheriff's rase is always decided in the democratic sheriff's primary. And no one who isn't a democrat runs for sheriff. So Independents and Republicans, though they are registered voters, have no say in who their sheriff is.  Many of us have complained because we don't give a hoot what the sheriff's personal political views are.  He isn't a law maker, he is a law enforcer,  so why does this even need to be a partisan position?

Huh?  Is she SERIOUS?            Crazy Michele didn't even stop there. She went on to claim that:       President Obama's recovery package includes a "national rationing board" to make health care decisions for you (a lie), billions of dollars for the community organizing group ACORN (another lie), and...are you ready for this one...$1,430 for every man, woman, child on earth (the biggest lie of all, or possibly a broken calculator).       Eight years of Bush-Cheney polices are now sending middle class families to the poorhouse by the millions.

My paretns were planning on just staying there for ever since all my parents' family lives over there and it's a better place to grow up than Los Angeles, etc. . So anyway I lived there for about 3 years but then because of family trouble we moved back to America when I was 8. I have always "regretted" this and I'm 17 now and ever since we left I have always wanted to move back. Now it's time to apply to college and I'm applying to a few Irish schools.      So I was wondering if it is possible for a 17 year old to get an Irish accent if my dad has an accent and I used to have an accent? How easy would it be to get it back? Is it even possible? Thanks.       Oh by the way, don't call me a plastic paddy or anything because I'm not. I hacve citizenship to both countries by the way.

20090223121113AAxgnZV	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	So I screwed up big time. What are my chances in court.?	A few months ago, I did something very bad. I stole a couple of laptops from my girlfriend's mother. I know, I know.. thief, etc. I was in a very bad state of mind at the time. I was working A LOT, but at the same time, I had a very bad gambling problem. All of my overtime was dumped into the casino, I pay 265 dollars a month for rent, and I managed to rack up a bill of $900.00. Back to the gambling problem, I was gambling very heavily because I was stressed out about a one nighter i had with this girl 3 years back, she told me her son might be mine ( it turned out not to be ) and i was waiting on the paternity test results. So like an addict of any kind, i allowed my "habit" to take over. Had it been mine, i would have lost my current girlfriend, so that monkey on my back, depressed the hell out of me. I was to the point where I really didn't care.. ok enough of that story. NOW since the "2nd degree burglary" i have done the following. 1. Went to the police and made a statement, 2. Started going to counseling for gambling. 3. Paid the store back that I sold these laptops to.  4. Did the recovery work to restore everything that I deleted off the laptops. 5. Paid my girlfriend's mom the cost of changing the locks to her house.       Yes I know it was a dumb thing to do, and I seriously feel like an idiot about it. I guess a combination of stress and being extremely tired, and feelings of self-hatred got me to do something i wouldn't normally do.  I just felt like I didn't care. I haven't been to court yet at all, This happened late october and it is now late february.      Ok, My question is.. Do I have a chance to stay out of handcuffs? the mother told the police she didn't want to press charges. I know I deserve everything coming to me. I just wanted to know if anyone's been in or witnessed a similar situation, and what happened.

Since I don't have an address to report the court states that they can not help my case. Now how in the heck do I find out his location in this city and where he works so I can get my order enforced. The state has failed me so many times in this case! He jumps from state to state. I don't know how this person keeps being able to bail on this case. Doesn't have to file a tax return, he also received unemployment for about a year and I didn't receive anything either. Thank for any help and guidance in this case......
20090223105406AAYVccW	Politics & Government;Military	Do you know the purpose of of all the surplus Warsaw Pact arms you collect?	Perhaps you never realized that they were built for killing Americans. It is also the reason they were exported to you, so that you could kill yourselves.   When I grew up in Czechoslovakia, you had to do military conscription for 2 years. If you had influence, it could be in a reserve or supporting role. From 1978-80 I served. One job I found myself doing was evaluation of small arms. Moissin Nagants, East German Mauser 98ks, Nazi 98ks rebuilt by Czechoslovakia, SKS, Vz. 52's, Vz. 52/57's and more modern weapons too.   The highest rating was good-no defects. After cleaning, they'd be stored or shipped for export. Poor-no defects meant it was probably going to MPLA or some other insurgency. Good-defective meant it went to someone training to be a gunsmith and repairs were made from other good used parts. These too would be exported to 3rd world countries. We had so much stuff, eventually it was exported to you, because we couldn't ship all this stuff. The lowest grade was poor-defective. All totally worn out parts and defective parts were melted to be turned into ?koda cars.   The truly good stuff eventually was exported I'm certain. My country would not have wanted to see things go to waste. We are known for being practical people. I can also tell you my superiors, regular army, held the USA and its allies in great disdain. Certainly the "Velvet Revolution" of 1990 did nothing to change their opinions of you. As our arsenals were emptied and sold to your country, understand it was done with the hope that these weapons would still fulfill their original intention. By buying them, you are putting money into the pockets of people who consider you an enemy.   The average person like myself really had no hatred for America. I lived there in 1989-90, since 1990 I have split a good deal of my time between the USA and Czech Republic. I only come here for the money.   I'm just curious as to why the interest in our obsolete surplus arms? You understand they are generally well worn. You know what their intent was. You should know that no self respecting Czech or Slovak NCO has only disdain for you. It has nothing to do with communism vs. capitalism. I just don't get it.

Money given to their state is wrong and will not help anyone.....do not see the people in those states complaining so they must be behind their elected officials....do not give them it....      At issue is: a portion of employment assistance stipulated which provides Federals dollars to EXPAND unemployment benefits states they would have expand the number of people who can receive the jobless benefits      example the 100 million given to LA as Jindal said would require him to change laws and that would actually raise taxes...quote from him   So...giving money to the jobless...raises taxes...okay      The other governors are going to put in 'sunset' clause..when money given runs out in 2 years....the law goes back to as is      So....if these red state gov. can not do that ...well too bad...maybe people in those states will think who they elect next time      Using the bs statement on raising taxes because of this bill only shows where their mind sets are      I say...contact your rep and demand they do not get it and the rest divided among the states that do want to help the people and to hell with any more games..agree?      That way...everyone is happy and we do not have to hear and watch the show any longer and move on with trying to get the country back on the road to recovery.....there is 46 other states      Thoughts?

I mean I know raise taxes on everyone and everything that moves from Businesses to a mileage tax, got it but is there any other plan besides that?         President Barack Obama has vowed to cut the country's budget deficit in half by the end of his first term.      Is this a joke        http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090223/ap_o...       you expand our Deficit to large than anything in our nations history and then say oh lets now cut it in half?      So is that like saying lets lay the ground work for socialism and then tax the crap out of everyone to see it through to fruition and then say oh see all fixed?

20090223130205AAh9qFD	Politics & Government;Elections	Why should I ask Bush?	When will people stop with the Bush, ask bush, and all that jazz come on people this is serious business. Bush is gone bye bye birdie ok, let us figure out what our “there can only be one president at a time” President is doing now to Fix all the “past mistakes”       Can we please look at what is and not what was? Can we figure out what our current president is doing and or not doing? Is that possible, do people have the capacity to live in the here and now and make some sense out of what B. Obama is doing? I don’t want to ask Bush, I didn’t like the Bailout or any of the “reaching across the isle” he did to gain the name neo-con in the first place so why would I look back and ask him now, although Barry is following after Bush’s footsteps just making them bigger so maybe you have a point?
20090223132056AAHAvK5	Politics & Government;Politics	Ok how is it Bush’s fault? Why not compare Obama to the Best instead of the worst?	Besides the fact that republicans KNEW in 2003 that we were headed for disaster with the Fannie/Freddie debacle and sat down in a corner to suck their thumbs just because Barney frank and a few others called them racists and fear mongers for daring to say there was a problem. Besides that I would like to know how  where people on Y/A get their information.       There is no way if one is being honest that this can be pinned on the right (except the above reason, which Is no small thing I will admit, but we are fixing that ya see, no more sitting by and hiding in a corner) the only rich and dirty hands on this is those on the left (Carter, Clinton, Barney Frank, Chris Dodd, Reed, Franklin Reins, Pelosi, and their lobbyists) and in all honesty that is why no one is going to jail, have you on the left ever wondered about that?  You can bet if they could pin this on anyone on the right they’d have been done already.       So my question is in KNOWING THE FACTS, the things that are documented, that are true not fabrications but backed up facts all point to the Left how is this Dubya’s fault? The policies of Fannie and Freddie created an unsustainable environment and it crashed and took us all with it and we are not focusing on the problem but reacting to the effects, that never fixing things just prolongs the inevitable, shouldn’t our leader Act and not REACT (like the Bush admin did two thumbs down for the bailout)       Look at what Reagan did, he inherited a mess and turned it around and gave prosperity with his policies through the Clinton years why not compare Obama to the best instead of the worst

The reasons were I couldn't get a security clearance since I didn't have payment arrangements made on this Sprint bill I owed so the only jobs I could qualify for had no clearances needed and that made the options very,very,very slim. So I declined to join (boy were they PISSED)   So I called sprint paid them the $300 I owed them, they did send a letter stating it was done.

I scored a 58 on my ASVAB before, but since I am taking a math class in College next month then I decided to retake the ASVAB again and see if I can score higher once I have refreshed my mathematical abilities... All this should give me a better chance of getting the job I want (Computer technology), and getting a bonus (couldn't last time since "ALL" I had was GED)  and 2.5 credits in JROTC with 15 college credits should at least get me to E3 right?

20090223125151AA18uXU	Politics & Government;Politics	What has happened to the idea of responsibility?	1. If you buy a house you can't afford- shouldn't that be your own problem and not the problem of people who were wise in their purchase of a home?      2. If your business model sucked, you didn't innovate and your business failed- isn't that the company's problem?  Why should we help a business that is failing?  Some companies fail.  That is life.  Deal with it.      3.Bail out banks?  If your funds are insured why bother with the bank bail-out?  If there was illegal activity - jail the bastards.  If it was greed and mismanagement- just let them be made a pubic example of stupidity.  No one will want to do business with them.      Failure weeds out the good from the bad, the good ideas from the bad ideas, etc...      Why should we bail-out institutions and individuals who are doomed to faith through their own actions?

20090223130916AAJItcJ	Politics & Government;Military	I'm a mom thinking of joining the USAF Reserve?	I have three kids and will graduate in the spring with a b.s. I've always wanted to join the armed forces (grandfather & grandmother in the usaf, mom was in the navy). I don't think I'm competitive enough to be full-time military and look for OTS. I'm thinking this might be a good stepping stone. Ultimately, I'm interested in a health career within the US military.      I was thinking of putting it off for a little while longer, but I'm not getting any younger. That, and with the current economy and potential for societal problems, I think having at least one of the two of us in the military would keep us in safer territory than not. I'd much rather live on base and be a member of the services in the middle of a serious economic depression (if it goes that way).      Another question re: military. Does anyone now how to study for the aptitude test? I'd really like to score well for medical placement. Any thoughts? Thanks!

My friends told me that we were moving too fast, but I didn't think anything of it because he told me he loved me. After about a month and a half, he forced me to have oral sex with him. I didn't think of it as forced at the time, I just assumed that it was normal for two people in love. It happened a lot more than once, and we did some other things too. However, looking back, I remember that I said no a lot, but he didn't stop. I remember one time when he admitted to me that he 'needed to get better at listening when I said no'. Was this sexual abuse/assault, and if so, what should I do about it? I am embarrassed to talk to my parents/friends about it, and I would never ever want to get this guy in trouble. I don't want to call any attention to the situation publicly, I just want to know if it was sexual assault or abuse.

20090223132452AAIPZ1Q	Politics & Government;Military	BCT at Ft. Leonard Wood compared to Benning?	I will be enlisted in the Army by the end of this week, I'm going to MEPS tomorrow.  Here's my question, I'm in college right now and after I get enlisted I'm going to go ahead and do ROTC here so I'll be an officer when I come out, thus I will be able to do another MOS than the one I'm going to AIT for after basic training.  Right now they have me as 21B and going to Fort Leonard Wood because it's supposedly the quickest AIT at this time (the goal is to get me through basic and ait as quick as possible so I won't miss more school since I'm going to be choosing another MOS anyway when I graduate.)  So should I go ahead and stick with 21B and go to Fort Leonard Wood or go 11B and go to Benning for sure?  I really want to go to Benning because that's where my dad went, I just don't want basic to be easy.  I know they all do the same thing since they are determined by standards, but the Drill Sergeants can be harder or easier.  I just don't see how a female Drill Sergeant could be as bad as a male one, since you might get a female one at Leonard Wood.  Should I change to 11B really quick and go to Benning or will I get the same experience at Leonard Wood?

20090223132836AAyS23j	Politics & Government;Politics	If people overwhelmingly hate the mortgage bailout, why are they still forcing it on us?	Fifty-five percent (55%) of American adults say the federal government would be rewarding bad behavior by providing mortgage subsidies to financially troubled homeowners. Among investors, 65% hold that view. The latest Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey shows that, among all adults, just 32% disagree. (Snip) Seventy-six percent (76%) of Americans are not willing to pay higher taxes to help people who cannot afford to make their mortgage payments.

By getting the individuals on here that are so against everything that is the current administration to promote their message?  I am asking because this came to me as I was reading some of the questions and comments from so many that are so anti-President Obama.  The man is in office for a month, and there is a lynch mob on here!        Personally, I think he is doing a fine job, and I would rather have him in office doing something for the AMERICAN PEOPLE than someone in office that will only listen to their party and operate with an "all or nothing" attitude.  I mean, he is at least doing something instead of sitting with a thumb up his @$$ and wondering what to do.  And really, what is the bright revelation of the Republican party to cure the economic stagnation?  Tax cuts?  Didn't that fail for the past 8 years??

20090223135231AATsmzD	Politics & Government;Politics	How much do illegals cost the USA yearly?	A report by the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) cited several interesting statistics based on census data. Some of these facts may be familiar to long-time readers… but I wanted each of you to know the enormous costs placed on the United States…       Our government continues to claim that the war on terror is bankrupting us. But what about these numbers? You do the math…      $11 billion to $22 billion is spent on welfare to illegal aliens each year by state governments.    Illegal households only pay about one-third the amount of federal taxes that non-illegal households pay.    Illegal households create a net fiscal deficit at the federal level of more than $10 billion a year. If given amnesty, this number could grow to more than $29 billion.    $1.9 billion dollars a year is spent on food-assistance programs such as food stamps, WIC and free school lunches for illegal aliens.    $1.6 billion is spent on the federal prison and court system for illegal aliens.    $2.5 billion dollars a year is spent on Medicaid for illegal aliens.    About 21 percent of the population of U.S. prisons is classified as “noncitizens” from Mexico, Colombia, Cuba and the Dominican Republic. About 5 percent is listed as “unknown.”    Immigration costs like all “costs" come out of the "TAXPAYOR" hide. These costs represent additional money creation that dilutes all the savings and assets in America.      References:      “The High Cost of Cheap Labor: Illegal Immigration and the Federal Budget.” Steven A. Camarota. Center for Immigration Studies (CIS).       Quick Facts about the Bureau of Prisons.

20090223140356AANXEhO	Politics & Government;Government	Obama supporters, do you agree with this: ?	 http://site.despair.com/despairwear/gove...       It's a T-shirt that says:      Government:   If you think the problems we create are bad,   Just wait until you see our solutions.      I tend to agree.  It seems like just about every problem the government is trying to solve is a problem created by the government.        So, Obama seems to think that the government should have the solution to just about everything and he's aggressively growing the size of the government.         So do you disagree with the slogan or agree with it?  Or, do you agree with it historically, but think that Obama will be the exception?      I'm curious about this.  I posted a similar question the other day, but with no references to Obama and everyone, without exception, who replied seemed to strongly agree.  I don't know who they supported for president, however, or what they think of Obama.    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=2...

"If you expect to be a net saver during the next 5 years, should you hope for a higher or lower stock market during that period? Many investors get this one wrong. Even though they are going to be net buyers of stocks for many years to come, they are elated when stock prices rise and depressed when they fall.      This reaction makes no sense. Only those who will be sellers of equities in the near future should be happy at seeing stocks rise. Prospective purchasers should much prefer sinking prices."      - Warren Buffett

After watching the film, Hotel Rwanda, I done some research and found out the about thr lack of help the Western World gave Rwanda.      The only country that came were Belgium but only stayed to evacuate the White Europeans and some Black Europeans. The UN, were their as Peacekeepers, not Peacemakers, but how can you keep peace, without making it in the first place? And how can you not do anything after seeing countless murders?      The Guardian on April 12, 1994 [14] stated that when viewing a woman "being hauled along the road by a young man with a machete":      "none of the troops moved. 'It's not our mandate,' said one, leaning against his jeep as he watched the condemned woman, the driving rain splashing at his blue United Nations badge. The 3,000 foreign troops now in Rwanda are no more than spectators to the savagery which aid workers say has seen the massacre of 15,000 people"       Why did Britain, France and American do absoloutely nothing in trying to stop this genocide, and the US couldnt even say it was Genocide when over 200 000 Rwandans were killed in the first 2 months. In my eyes, the Western World, especially Europe failed Rwanda and its peoples.      Is there a logical reason why these countries let the massacre of innocent men, women and children go on which eventually lead to up to 1 million deaths? How many more people are goign to die, in Sudan, The Congo? It disgusts me that the Western World, turned their back on a country in desperation, hopefully they have learned.

This resolution, HJR1003, was passed by a very large margin, 83 to 13 on February 18. At least another 20 state legislatures are considering similar resolutions. [Update, February 23, 2009: Click here for "The Tenth Amendment Movement: Status by State, 2009," to see which states have already introduced Tenth Amendment resolutions this year along with links to the full-text of each resolution.]      The official summary of HJR1003 reads as follows:      A Joint Resolution claiming sovereignty under the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States over certain powers; serving notice to the federal government to cease and desist certain mandates; providing that certain federal legislation be prohibited or repealed; and directing distribution.      After nine "Whereas" clauses, the resolution concludes with:      NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND THE SENATE OF THE 1ST SESSION OF THE 52ND OKLAHOMA LEGISLATURE:      THAT the State of Oklahoma hereby claims sovereignty under the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States over all powers not otherwise enumerated and granted to the federal government by the Constitution of the United States....

I thought that we would either file married joint and split the refund, or we could file legally separated since as of december 12th we were legally separated, and then we would just each claim 2 kids each... hes really only entitled to one i feel since one child moved with him on december 23.       well he already took all the stuff down to h and r, and is claiming all 4 kids. so when i go to file i have no dependants, even though im the one who takes care of them.    can he do this?   i dont care about getting audited really, i have all of our info for the past 7 yrs. he doesnt have anything.

20090223133800AAlVDrK	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Would you lie in court to fit up a man for a charge he didn't do....the man is a local scumbag?	Say for example, you were called as a witness in court as from your living room window you had seen a young man being assaulted by one youth (18) whilst another (the accused -also 18) pushed him over and kicked him twice in the leg then stood by and watched his friend kick him repeatedly all over.       The victim, a bangladeshi man in his 30's, suffered broken ribs, a fractured arm and severe bruising to his body and face, he was hospitalised for 8 days.       The accused was well known teenage thug on the estate where you live and had stood by and watched laughing.  He was always in trouble, he had been involved in alot of petty crime and always got off with community sentances if anything, he is currently on an asbo.      The victim said he thought they both kicked him but wasn't sure as he was on the floor.  There are no other witnessess.   In your statement you told the police you saw them both doing it in equal measure.  The case is being heard before crown court and the charge is GBH.      Would you lie and see him sent down?  He was there, he did assault him (but not as much as you told the police), he does terrorise the estate - and so far has gotten away with it.      Does he deserve to go down for it?

I am writing a thesis paper for one of my classes based on the following question:      "Can the American Government successfully handle multiple crises at once?"      For my paper, I am taking trying to use current American issues (Economic Crisis, Global Warming, War on Terror, etc.) in order to prove my point.      Anyway, I have done a great deal of research, but I feel that my views might be much too narrow-minded. I would like to ask the Yahoo!

Please, if you give me an article or two, feel free to include your own personal opinion in your answer! I am trying to become as enlightened as possible before I construct my final paper!

20090223133920AAdB3lS	Politics & Government;Military	Should I join the military?	My friends say I'm rushing into joining the air force? I move out of my parent’s house at 18, because they are both heavy alcoholics and I hated the environment. I'm just confused now, because I hear a lot of people say these are the best years of your life. That scares me, because all I do is work and go to school and I don’t feel like I'm enjoying my life. I feel burnt out. I lost the job I had and now I'm work at a strip club as a bartender. I don’t do any drugs and I'm not sure if I've ever even gotten high off weed. I'm around a lot of drug and it's difficult to see girls strung out on them. I just feel so much empathy for them and it makes me sad. Also my car was rear ended and totaled at a red light and I bought a lemon with the insurance. Any way I just feel so confused. I know I'm 19 and I'm an adult but I sometimes wish that I had parents with good advice or even ones that bossed me around and making sure I was doing what should be doing. You know that whole “If your under my roof you’re going to do what I say” stuff I see on TV. So I've made an appointment with a recruiter tomorrow and really want to get the ball rowling. I think this would be good for me but my cousin who's was in the air force doesn’t and that worries me. I don’t just think it's that I'm not satisfied with my life I thinks its natural to want to travel and get away from where you've lived your entire life. So I feel like this is my way out. I just feel insecure about it and really want some encouragement or advice. Is this a good way to change or get away from my problems?

20090223134219AAOopCi	Politics & Government;Politics	What about Slavery Reparations?	It is commonly argued that whites should be made to pay reparations to blacks for slavery, on the basis that slavery allowed whites to illegitimately enjoy the free labor of black slaves. If we accept the legal premises, then I think that instead a strong case could be made instead that blacks be made to pay reparations to white people. Consider these facts:          * Blacks were enslaved and sold to Europeans by fellow blacks, and the trade was quite profitable for Africans       * Blacks in America are far better off than blacks in Africa            On this basis it is clear that slavery benefited black people, so there is no basis for reparations from whites to blacks. So what is the basis for black reparations to whites?      Rather simple. As we know, blacks commit many, many more crimes per capita than white people, and have also destroyed large amounts of housing stock and other real estate through their regular riots. Blacks also commit more "hate crimes" against whites than vice-a-versa. And lastly, affirmative action and other quotas systematically deny educational and economic opportunities to white people, and has been calculated to cost every white person several thousands of dollars annually.      Thus, I think blacks should be made to pay reparations to whites. End the legacy of black oppression of whites! Reparations now!      What do you think?

I'm planning to go to college, but I have absolutely no money unless I apply for financial aid. I wouldn't join the Guard just for college benefits, but I also want to do something honorable with my life. I love my country, I love adventure and I love a good challenge. I'm a feminine girl, but I don't mind getting down in the dirt when I need to.      No offense to ANYONE, but I hear so many negative comments about female Soldiers, like men are turned off by them and they're branded as "butches" or "lesbians." Most of my family is totally against women joining the Army, but I really feel like this is something I want to do. I just don't want to end up making a HUGE mistake, signing a contract and regretting it later.      So Ladies, would you help me out here? What inspired you to join the National Guard? Do you enjoy it? How has it made your life better and in what ways?      Thanks.

20090223141732AARt2jC	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	How to handle threats from an employee?	I started a small business with my boyfriend about two years ago, where we employed a woman who was friends with my dad and needed a job as they had both been sacked recently. In the event of the sacking my dad needed to borrow some money from her to purchase an important piece of equipment. Now we had forgotten all about it since then, but she hadnt mentioned it to us throughtout this at all, otherwise if we had remembered we'd have paid her back. She has been working for me but apparently has a problem with us due to this, but refuses to consult us and instead, has her 'family' come to our business and threaten us about the debt. We arranged to make weekly repayments until completely cleared.      They requested the weekly repayments in cash, but ive been making them by bank transfer to keep myself safe and for proof its been paid.      We then recieved a second threat from her stating that, her 'nephew would send someone to see us' due to the payments paid into her bank account. So she was fired on the spot.    Now her sister is speaking on her behalf to try and threaten us legally, claiming we 'used' her for longer hours than she was allowed to work (arrangement with centrelink).    We had told her on numerous occasions not to come in early and not to stay back late, but had caught her leave the premises and park outside the building as she was afraid to go home, BECAUSE her sister gave her a hard time! Out of good will, i wrote a letter for her stating her position has become redundant, just so she wouldnt get into trouble for the threats.

20090223140639AA6H2f7	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	How to handle threats from ex employee?	I started a small business with my boyfriend about two years ago, where we employed a woman who was friends with my dad and needed a job as they had both been sacked recently. In the event of the sacking my dad needed to borrow some money from her to purchase an important piece of equipment. Now we had forgotten all about it since then, but she hadnt mentioned it to us throughtout this at all, otherwise if we had remembered we'd have paid her back. She has been working for me but apparently has a problem with us due to this, but refuses to consult us and instead, has her 'family' come to our business and threaten us about the debt. We arranged to make weekly repayments until completely cleared.      They requested the weekly repayments in cash, but ive been making them by bank transfer to keep myself safe and for proof its been paid.      We then recieved a second threat from her stating that, her 'nephew would send someone to see us' due to the payments paid into her bank account. So she was fired on the spot.     Now her sister is speaking on her behalf to try and threaten us legally, claiming we 'used' her for longer hours than she was allowed to work (arrangement with centrelink).    We had told her on numerous occasions not to come in early and not to stay back late, but had caught her leave the premises and park outside the building as she was afraid to go home, BECAUSE her sister gave her a hard time! Out of good will, i wrote a letter for her stating her position has become redundant, just so she wouldnt get into trouble for the threats.    Their basically trying to extort money from us and coming here every couple of days and its really cutting my workflow. Im losing my patience but, i know what these people are capable of.

He is at the vet now, and they aren't sure but they're going to examine him later today. We are fairly sure who did it, as he is the only one near us where Mittens would go. A few years ago, my neighbors cat Feebee was also caught in one of his animal traps and had to have her leg amputated. I need to know if formal charges can be brought against this man and what the procedure is for prosecuting him. Thank you :)

I was in an accident this weekend and was given a citation for failure to yield, even though I was stopped when I was struck by an oncoming car.  I was on a four lane city street turning left, there were two trucks in the lane directly in front of me also turning left from opposite direction.  I slowly crept out and I did not see anyone all of a sudden there is a car.  I had time to stop, before being completely in the lane she was not paying attention and struck me with her driver side front to about the left of my licensee plate.  She pushed me back a few feet.  I was driving a 92 Chevy Suburban and she was driving like a honda(ouch).  I just need to know if I should contest the ticket or not? Its a $131 Dollar ticket.

Two black men were the supposed attackers. His crimee was positively identified by the victim/witness. BUT my friend was NOT positively identified. The guy said "im not sure" and didnt even pick him out of the line-up or six pack. Later, we found out, LAPD were pressuring. In any case, when the case was about to go on trial last month, the charge was DROPPED and re-filed. Duh. they had little to go on...      This is what is crazy. This Friday will be his preliminary hearing. at visiting, he told me, the police never told him his RIGHTS!!!! They just went on and questioned him. the miranda rights right to lawyer, bla bla were never told to him.       His public defender never asked him.      If im not correct, doesnt that mean the case could get DROPPED again?!?!?      ASIDE from that, couldnt the case get dropped any way??       please pray for him. I know he's innocent. He's made mistakes but he most definately NON violent.      Thanks! serious replies please

Bush has to deal with this so he fights it with Tax cuts . Like it or not it worked and not only did it work well. It provided the best economy in 48 years and unemployment rate was 1/3 of what it is now.What screwed it all up? Democrats took Control of Congress and started in with their ludicrous tax hikes. Forbes predicted if the Democrat controlled congress does not stop with these tax hikes they will tank the economy and send us right into a recession and guess what ? That is exactly what happened ! Of coarse democrat's try to spin this and blame Republicans but the time line proves Democrats are responsible for the mess we are in today and that's why you will see head lines like this one from today's yahoo news>> Major stock market indexes fall to 1997 levels<<<  Guess who was President in 97.Want a hint? I did not have sex with that woman! What's funny is democrat's still think he was a good President proving once and for all Democrat's are not very good at thinking!!!

20090223144026AAowQ2F	Politics & Government;Immigration	Americans say they're against illegal immigration, but..?	Hello my fellow Americans.   I am Mexican-Italian and while I visited my sister in Houston, Texas.   I've noticed that many americans were against illegal immigration, but when they wanted cheap labor they hired illegals to pay them have the money they would have have to pay a citizen.       so I'm like: what??!    weren't they just saying that they're against illegal immigrants??   And they talk about why Mexicans are invading their country...but during spring break they're the ones flooding the Mexican beaches.      I personally think that without the ILLEGAL workers living in the US, prices would skyrocket in no time, imagine how much you would have to pay for a tomato or an apple if the laborers would all be citizens the employers would have to pay them at least twice as much than an illegal. :s       I'm not trying to make you a pro immigrant.....this is just my opinion.      god bless you.

20090223144025AAXBv6m	Politics & Government;Elections	Will President Obama succeed in reducing the federal deficit by 50% by the end of his first term?	President Obama announced today that he is setting a goal of reducing the federal deficit by 50% by the end of his first term as President. Do you think he will succeed?      Lots of Presidents SAY they are going to reduce the deficit, but almost all of them fail. Ronald Reagan said he was going to do it for eight years but never succeeded. George Bush Sr. said he would and George Bush Jr. also said they would reduce the deficit but it continued to go up every single year they were President also.    In fact, the only President in recent memory who has actually reduced the deficit was President Clinton. That was after the Democratic Congress passed the Deficit Reduction Act in 1993. I remember how Al Gore was villified by the right for casting the deciding vote in favor of that bill.      What do you think? Will Obama succeed like Clinton did, or will he be a failure like the others were?

20090223144230AA7WxiZ	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	:( Ever lost your wallet?	I lost my wallet, most likely friday night. I realized late saturday night it was gone, and searched for it well into sunday. I retraced my steps and narrowed down the window of time i must have lost it to late friday night. I was at a movie theater, and it's possible it fell out of my purse where I was seated.      I called and visited the theater, they don't have it.   Mall security doesn't have it either.      I checked my online banking, no one has used my credit cards, and I only had about ten dollars cash on me.       It's possible I lost it elsewhere. Maybe walking downtown, dropping it in a parking lot or even leaving it on a table/bench somewhere.      This has never happened to me before, but I was hoping some of you could help me. If someone were to find it and turn it in to a police station, would they call me?      Also, has anyone ever had to get a replacement license?
