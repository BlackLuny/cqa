20090220170034AAF4X08	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why is it assumed that fathers want custody in order to avoid paying child support?	I came across this claim, again, in a recently posted question:      "My ex-husband and I have one daughter together and he is fighting for custody so he doesn't have to pay child support."    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...       Any attorney representing a father would have told him that according to the Federal Office of Child Support Enforcement, less than 15% of non-custodial mothers are ordered to pay child support, of which only 5% ever pay it.    http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cse/       Just who will be providing for the support of the child while in the custody of the father?  Further, up to 10% of custodial fathers are still ordered to pay child support.  Only custodial mothers are guaranteed a child support order, so wouldn't that say that mothers are the ones wanting custody because they get child support?      I know this will raise some hackles, but the facts are the facts.  Personal, I go for no child support paid to either parent and the children getting joint physical custody of the parents.

20090220170612AAUPI0T	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	A Customer Walks Into (adult joke.)?	a pharmacy and asks the assistant for an anal deodorant.   The assistant explains that they don't stock them. The man insists that he bough his last one from this store.   The assistant passes the man onto the pharmacist, who explains that the store has never stocked such an item. The man explains that he bought his last one from this very store only weeks ago and has done so for several years.   The pharmacist asks the man to bring in his last purchase and he will try to match the product.   The following day, the man returns to the pharmacy and shows the deodorant to the pharmacist. The pharmacist asks why the customer thinks this is an anal deodorant, when it is obviously of the underarm stick variety.   The customer explains that the instructions on the reverse side state: "Push up bottom to use."

20090220170319AAs2TvO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What would you call these feelings?	I'm going to try to describe these feelings the best I can.      Ok for a while I was wondering if I was a lesbian because every time I see another girl who is around my age and looks good to me I think she's hot. I'll stare at her for a second to take her all in then I'll tell myself to look away because I don't want to be a lesbian and I don't think i'm one personally. I'm not attracted to all that many guys though either. Only the ones who I think look good but they only come along once in a blue moon. And by good I mean they have to look like an abercrombie and fitch model and flawless. I don't think it's right to classify myself as a lesbian or as completely straight either. And I feel bad that all my friends know what they are, so if I'm ever asked I just say that i'm straight to avoid being questioned. Oh and one more thing. I don't know if it's all that important, but when someone cracks a joke about gays and lesbians I'm the last to laugh and even then it's not a real laugh. I think it's hurtful to the gays and lesbians out there, but i don't want to say anything because I don't want to be classified as a lesbian or anything.

Now that we are in 10th grade, closer than ever, she always copies me or tries to be like me. Ive recently found my own style and Erin is always trying to copy me with it. I really love her so much and I still want to stay best friends with her forever. Were going on a cruise with our other friend Rachel and Erin sometimes copies her too! Like little funny expressions that she says that Erin never said before. Like she will say  "God Dayummm!" or something and its not funny. Erin never tried anything sort of risky like sweater vests or ombre and she will like pick something out online that looks excactly the same as something I own. I am a gymnast so im not super skinny, but im not fat. Erins a little chunky so we cant share clothes.  But, its not only clothes that she copies, its everything from music interests to my camera. I love photography so i bought a digital SLR camera around 5 months ago. Recently Erin said "ohh for my sweet sixteen i think im gunna ask for a camera like yours" Shes going to end up making facebook albums just like mine and its going to be another thing added on to my list of things shes copied. She really needs to stop because its pissing me off. I have tried to talk to her about it but she ends up getting mad at me. ill even say "oh i wouldnt expect you to like something like that" and she will be like oh well i do. and if she sees something in a store that i would like she buys it so i cant get it. i love her so much and i want to stay friends forever but this needs to stop now. what can i say or do to make her stop copying me?! HELP IM DESPERATE!      Thanks in advance :]    nothing rude please, she doesnt need therapy or she doesnt have identity problems.

20090220171726AA1ovhb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys, why would he tell me about all the different girls he likes?	We used to work together, and now we're at college in different states and communicate solely via Facebook chat. About four or five times now he's told me about these girls that he likes (a different one each time), about how much fun they used to have together and how perfect they are, and he's sad because they're all engaged.       Is he telling me this simply because he wants to talk about it and he figures he might as well talk about it to me, or is he telling me this because that's his way of subtly letting me know that he's not interested in me?       And if each time he brings up one of these hot/interesting girls he's talking about a different person, does he *really* like any of them, or does he just like the idea of them?  He's 24, and I'm almost 20, if that helps.

I've heard from someone he doesnt like fat people? sorta racist in fat people isnt it? and the thing is i am fat.      But i was really starting to like him, and maybe he was starting to like me,   until i read a chat someone in my class and him had.   It was: (i'll put the thing, but take out some things and change the names.)      me: idk.     whos on ur team, now?     u, bob, and who else   1:34 PM tim: kelly (name changed- thats me)    me: k.    tim: i wish kelly wasnt though     i wish u were back on my team cause u actually try    1:35 PM me: that doesnt mean im good.    tim: ya it does     it realyl does    me: thanksl, but i kinda suck.   tim no not really      The "I wish she wasnt, she doesnt try" thing really got me sad. Does anyone else feel that way?         Side notes:   I actually do try, as much as i can.   All the names are changed in the chat.

We have moved in with my mum and her partner.  Soon, my brother and his partner are coming too and we are all going to live together (to save money).      The problem is, my bro's girlfriend is really noisy when they do the lurve bumps.  Past experience with being on holiday with them has taught me this.  The first time, I thought it was funny......but then it just got down right annoying.  Don't get me wrong either, I love this chick to pieces, she is the best thing that has ever happened to my bro, this is my only major problem with her.      The walls in this house aren't very sound proof, we will be in the room next to them and I just know its gunna drive me insane.  I sorta think that if you live with other people, keep your love noises to a minimum....I wouldn't want to hear my mum and her partner going for it so I pay them the same respect.      We also have a six year old daughter and I don't want her to have to listen to it either........not ready to explain these things to her yet!      So now I wanna know how to deal with it - should I just wait til they get here and see if it happens?  I am hoping that living with parents might make a difference to her - but what if it doesn't?  Should I raise it straight away or wait til it happens?      BTW we are in our 30's.....serious answers only please!  Thanks in advance for your help!

Is that unattractive cus I used to get asked out alot in high school but now that I"m in college the only guys that are attracted to me are the players so I'm starting to wonder if there is some signal I'm sending to make these guys think that I"m that type of girl when I"m just actually just a real friendly fun loving type of person...any ideas?
20090220172329AAcsEhA	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	The boy that I like has told me that his dad has cancer.He says that he just cant think bout his feelings 4 me?	i like a boy and he knows it. i care about him very much. i have been diagnosed with clinical depression, so it is very hard for me to feel feelings other then anger, sadness, and bitterness. but when i am around ben, i am able to feel other feelings. i love the way he makes me feel, and he is very important to me, but i have not told him how he makes me happy. a few weeks ago i asked if we were just friends and he said for now. seeing this as a good sign, i countinued what i ussually did, which was talk to him at school and ask for hugs (which he gives me). anyways, recently i have been getting impatient, wondering what "for now" means. so yesterday i pulled him aside, and we had this conversation:      me: So, you know a month ago when i asked you if we were just friends? and you said for now?      him: yeah      me: well can you please tell me what that means? do you know what i've been thinking about since then? (i was implying that i was thinking about what he had said)      (he smiled, leaned toward me, and rubbed his chin)      him: i think we both know what youve been thinking about      me: can you please just answer the question? what does for now mean?      him: well, my dad was diagnosed with cancer last night and i dont really know how i feel.      me: oh. god dammit ben your going to make me cry! i cry over people i dont even know. i'm sorry about your dad.      him: yeah      i asked him for a hug, and when he gave it to me i told him that i want him to feel better, and he said i hope you feel better too.       well, i now know for a fact that his dad does have cancer. i am not sure how far along it is or what kind it is. i'm afraid to bring it up with ben. i like him very much and care for him so much it almost hurts to think of him worrying about his dad. i want to show ben that i can be there for him, but i dont know how. and obviously he is worried about more important things then being in a relationship with me, i know that is not an option, but i wish it were. please help me.

Then I've always liked guys who are like American like me and such and well, they're always taller than me but then I moved to an Asian country, the Philippines in where most guys are short. I never liked most Filipino guys, but then I finally fell for someone in such a really long time and I'm 5'6" and he's like 5'5" and I really like him and I can't help myself... but I don't want to date someone shorter than me, yet I can't fight off the feelings.      I feel like I need to be protected from a man and being taller makes me feel like I'm alone. LOL.      what should I do?

I dont freak out about it, its just what catches the eye.      I will agree with them Asian Women are very   beautiful and i  think all this jealously and hatred   is stupid.      What do you think?

20090220174445AAj0g9o	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Really confused!  Does she want me or not??? **10 Points!!**?	Hey guys, I'm REALLY confused right now, so please just bear with me and read my whole thing! I know its long!! :(      I met this girl that I really liked and we are both in first year uni. So After getting to know her a bit, I asked her out to lunch and we did stuff like we went to this dance and she danced with me the whole night. It seemed like we were really clicking, so I told her how I want to be more than just friends and that I like her alot, and I asked her about how she feels. She replied that she needed more time. So about 2 days later, we finished working on an assignment, and it was really late at night and she offered to "stay up with me" for the rest of the night since it was like 6 am and there was no point in sleeping. So when we were walking back from handing in our assignment, she kind of grabbed my arm and rested her head on my shoulder, but I didn't really respond to it, I just let her do whatever. And when we got back, she let me sleep on her lap and she was like brushin my hair and touching my ear.      So I thought this was a clear "YES" to my question earlier. However, the next day we talked again, but this time she wasn't as "intimate". We sat down but like we were kinda far apart and we never really "connected". So I'm asking myself whats going on. and about 2 months she's been just acting like my friend and not doing anything that friends wouldn't do. But one time, she had to go somewhere to buy something and asked me to come with, so i went and we held hands walking, but nothing more. I guess it could have something to do on my part that I didn't really make any move or indicate to her that i liked her?      And so even more time passed and I asked her out again to chill but it was very unsuccessful. So I decided to ask her AGAIn what is going on and how she feels about me. She replied this time by saying that she wasn't really looking for anyone and that she just wants to meet new people.      So I took the "rejection" kind of hard, but I accepted it and respected her decision. I tried to give her time and space and not talk to her, but ever since she told me "she wasn't interested", she's been talking to me WAY more often and getting me to come over to her place, but nothing ever happens.       My friends tell me that she just wants attention, so just get her jealous by getting another girl and she'll want me back? But others tell me that she still likes me and wants me, but I need to "Prove" to her that I really like her instead of saying it???      I'm really confused right now and I DON"T know what to do.. Whether to keep pursuing her or to just move on. I still have deep feelings for her. And ever since I've been at uni I've been living with this stupid thought at the back of my mind. "does she like me?" Even after asking her twice, the answer is unclear.      What do you think? and what should i do?

20090220174457AAFyZ5j	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	A Potential Relationship?	This guy and I have liked each other for months but we're both really shy. I'm scared of getting hurt again, he's scared of dating and because he doesn't have many girl friends.      We've talked on the phone a few times but usually have to stick to texting and IM because of our schedules. We went to a movie together and the date (or whatever it was-we didn't completely clarify, but he did offer to pay) was fun and he was a gentleman. We can talk for hours on end and I'm almost positive there's no one else in the picture. He's told all of his close friends about me. We were each other's valentines and we spent hours that night talking, also he was worried about how he acted when he met my mom.       SO my question is, how do I ask where the two of us stand, how do I phrase it? I know he's shy so I have to nudge him a little more than I would normally, but I'm pretty sure he's wondering too. I just don't want to scare him.

My Friend whose name Im not going to mention has been getting more and more violent lately.Before he used to just push and shove around just jokingly.then he started putting people in headlocks which still wasnt that bad until esterday he started putting people in head locks and choking them. He did it to my friend he did it to me.   When he did it too my friend he didnt let go until he started collapsing.   Today though, He grabbed my friend Krystal and started pulling her arms back and held her there while a guy named took some of her pretzel.Wasnt really a big deal they seemed to be playing around and then Cody just bends her over and starts punching her in the *** as hard as he can repeatedly.   It made me sick.   I pulled him off and was like wtf? he said he was just "******* with her"   Hes always shouting now and  and like standing on tables and headbanging during lunch.   Hes acting like a ******* five year old.   Ivetried talking to him about it. he thinks hes just fuckign with everyone.   I cant talk to his parents because they wont listen.

I thought he had moved on by being with me. He is my first boyfren and we have been living together for almost 2 years. However, things such as his fav songs contains lyrics that relate to him being left behind by her and lost love. Its just so obvious that i am but a subsitute to him. I love him so much and gave up a lot to be with him, sacrificing family, friends and even my dignity and pride by giving in to his tyrannic ways. Right now, we co-share the rent and a car.

My ex gf wants to come see her cat that she left with me (When she left me/went back home to another state and another school). When she left, she gave me her cat bc her dad won't let her have it bc her lil sis and lil bro are allergic to cats. I don't really want to see her AT ALL. I don't know. Have you ever seen "The Notebook"?? We are like Noah and Allie in there. Her dad is a rich neurosurgeon and I am broke and bus tables. Her mom called me white trash bc my family doesn't have any money although her dad said I was a good guy but not "their type." She isn't with anyone right now and neither am I, but I really don't want to even be her friend. It's just too hard bc I really did have feelings for her, but she never told me how her mom hated me for not being rich until like a few months ago. I knew they would've disapproved bc she told me that when we were together but I never got to meet them. I broke up with her last Xmas and it has been a yr. What should I do? I don't know

I have been married for about four years and have no kids (and my parents keep telling me to have a baby now.) My sister and I are both married into the same family, and sometimes I feel like our in laws do it too. Its so frustrating, I want people to understand that just because we are sisters, it doesn't mean we are the same. We are two different people. What should I do?

Vejam essa situa??o: Há alguns dias atrás, uma colega de trabalho (c/ qm trabalho há quase 8 anos), se declarou perdidamente apaixonada por mim. Até aí, td bem... se ela ? fosse casada. é verdade q o casamento dela está pela bola 7, há muito tempo, já q o marido dela é um mau-caráter, mulherengo, canalha, sem-vergonha, e todos os etc. q vc imaginar! Quando ela se declarou p/ mim, eu confesso q já estava desconfiado, mas ainda assim, fiquei sem gra?a, já q ela é uma pessoa evangélica, temente a Deus, correta, cheia de moral e dos bons costumes. Ela me falou, na ocasi?o, q ? esperava q eu correspondesse aos sentimentos dela, mas q, ela estando ao meu lado, em alguns momentos, já era suficiente. Só q, mesmo assim, ela ? larga do meu pé, e vive dando bandeira! A única coisa q admiro nela, é q é uma pessoa inteligente, tem uma boa conversa, mas, no mais, ? dá p/ encarar! rsss... O q eu fa?o???

20070106144320AAJ7Ljg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Could he like me?	Ok, so there's this really cute and popular guy that goes to my school. And he's a sophmore, and I'm a freshman. The thing is, I have a major crush on him but don't have the nerve to tell him, but I do look for signs. What I do see is that everytime I see him I catch him STARING at me (not in a bad way), like he'll just be stuiding me in a curious way like I'm a mildly interesting bug. And I'll give him a hug sometimes, and he justs acts really werd. He doesn't act mad or annoyed or anything, but will lke have this wierd smile on his face. And he only does that to me!! And once when I walked up to him his friend started whispering while covering his mouth, and the guy I liked was smiling and nodding, and his friend kept looking at me. And the most OBVOIUS sign of all was when all the freshman had to leave for this activity and as I turned to leave I turned around and caught him watching me AGAIN, so I waved, and then he actually nodded at me! I almost died! Ladies, what do you think?!!
20061128185551AATvYP3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is Adriel such an idiot???	Ok, there's this fat guy I met at camp, and he was really nice..so I became his friend, got to know him well, thought he was a pretty nice guy, asked him out, and BOOM, we were a couple. But then he cheats on my with my so-called best friend who's actually not that attractive, she's pretty ugly, and he breaks up with me... and he never liked her before!!! So then he starts all this drama, and he says all this stuff, like how he loves her, probably trying to make me jealous - then he asks out my cousin, claims he loves HER, too, and he's never even met her!!! So, my good people, my question for you is - why would someone do all that stuff, and be such a moron? Help me!!!!

I also lost 50lbs. none of it seems to matter...argggggggggh.  Hey, life is tough...at what point do you forgive and forget?

I just don't think I can connect with modern day women of other races, but Latin and Asian women from my observation seem to have all the qualities men want in a women that you won't normally find in other women like great personalities, hard working, appreciative, beautiful, easy going, sweet, feminen, faithful, great mothers, ect. I have a couple of friends dating Cuban women and 1 who has dated a Korean women, they tell they are wonderful definatly marriage material. I have yet to even date a Latin or Asian women, so I'am I better off trying to date Latin or Asian women.

20070121175914AAnLFdX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help! It's about guys. I'm about to fall apart here! =/?	Ahkay here's the deal I've been going out with this guy, David for a month and a half we broke up cause all he wanted is to get me in bed, and he almost did. So, already being emotionally strained about this, during half the time we were dating, my best guy friend, James, had a major crush on me and he still does. I like him too but the problem is that my best girl friend, Missy, really likes James. I talked to her a few minutes ago and she guessed there was something going on between us, and she said she was okay with it, but I really don't want to hurt her, I'm afraid she might be hiding her feelings. I've known James since 3rd grade and it's really wierd that we both feel this way now. After having a brother-sister, best friend relationship for so long. I really like him. I mean he was there for me when David and I broke up. He gave me good advice too. I think I might love him. But I really don't know what I'm supposed to do. I still have some feelings for David too. Help, anyone?

20070411180003AAT2R1U	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need help! Advice Bout a Girl!!!!?	I'm talking to this girl I liked since October. We've been talking for about a month now and I got here number like 3 weeks ago, well last Monday I write her a note telling her I like her and I attached it to her favorite chocolate. I've been asking her out but either the weather was extremely bad or her mom would say no! Well after I gave her that note things have been good we talk on the phone everyday, we talk in the hallway but in third hour she seems different. We never talk in third hour. We glance at each other, but its like nobody in our class know we're talking. It's like we never knew each other, WHAT DO I DO?   And she acts different when shes around her friends, I'm a black boy and she's white but thats not a factor in our relationship. How do I deal with that?
20070419160247AAm7okq	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should I be her friend?	Okay yesterday I was hurt a lot. I was talking to this sweetheart named Sara. I got her number about a month ago and I told her I like about 2wks. ago. We're both juniors in high school. Her parents won't let her date because they are afraid she will hang with the wrong crowd again. You see she use to do meth and other drugs, she's clean now but still. I told her Tuesday I want to take it slow, and she said that she doesn't want to be in a relationship because she's busy, she is though she has meetings, babysitting, cooking and cleaning, tennis practice and matches, school, errands her parents make her do, and church. I told her to be blunt with me and tell me she is trying to let me down easy. BUT she says "No I really wanna be friends with you still because I do like you". I like her, do I say forget it annd leave her alone, or be friends with her like she wants to be, and give it time?

Immediately, this 18-yr-old girl came out of nowhere.  She and her mother are full blown narcassists.  They have treated Zoe', me and Jeff HORRIBLE. Recently, birthmom comes back, demands DNA test and of course Jeff is not Zoe's biological father.  Jeff's dad is a well known child molester. Jeff and Natalie had a baby, didn't want to be bothered with Zoe' so she was sent to the pedaphile.  Zoe' stayed with her other grandmother, Carol. Carol's 16 yr-old daughter on probabtion for meth, has been waking Zoe' up in the night making Zoe' suck her nipples and God only knows what else.  This child is in severe trouble.  Her mother Jessica has mentioned that her new husband wants to adopt Zoe'.  This guy is bad news, I just know it.  Zoe' needs to be completely taken away from ALL of those people, including my beloved son.  Please someone...help

He was in a relationship with a girl for 2 years & he talked to me more than to her + He was always hinting to me that we have a special history. I love him but don't know if he feels the same. He talks about future. He cares about what his parents think of me. He gives me obvious hints of interest. He says Im the only girl he can open up to and he does talk to me about everything on his mind, but he doesnt talk about us.I acts different when were alone. He says male/female friendship doesnt exist, If a guy is friends with a girl he hopes for sex with her. That made me wonder what his intentions are with me. He mentioned that hes' never had a lover, that might be a hint.   I don't know what he feels & that hurts. I have hopes for a future with him.   What do you think?  For the past 4 years destiny keeps pulling us together. Are we meant to be?      Does he love me?

20070121173223AAqPZr3	Family & Relationships;Family	Is it abuse? my emotionally verbally abusive ex has weekend visitation rights w/our daughter.?	my question doesn't involve her directly; it has to do w/her half sister. one of the things my ex and his family were "freaky" about was potty training. it was one of the many things we disagreed on. i know it sounds weird but in order to train children they believe in berating and telling kids things like "your stomach will explode", etc if you don't go on the potty. of course this causes children to "hold" their b.m.s (sorry) until they are constipated and then he gives them enemas! (when married i fought this and NEVER let him or his mother do that to my children) today my daughter told me that he is doing that to her sister and that she was screaming and crying and couldn't sit down. i honestly don't know whether i should report this as abuse or who to talk to. (no sense in talking to him or his wife)

I like this girl at work alot ive never felt this way towards any girl before, we started flirting back and forth about 3 to 4 months ago at work.

The only problem is she has a BoyFriend they dont have a good reltionship at all, she complains about him alot. Then about 2 weeks ago my friend kyra said that Melinda (the girl i liek)  likes me. Then today my friend Ashley asked her if her and her bf were doing good she said not really. Then she asked if me and her were talking like talking talking and she kinda timidly shook her head no. Please help wat does this mean, she stilll flirts and smiles and is always toching me  on my arm or smacking me lightly in my stomach. Should i tell her how i feel or just move on to someone else.

20070223190611AAQWW4H	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My world feels like it is caving in on me? any advice?	I am about 5'5 freakishly green eyes, strawberry blonde hair, skinny and 17 years old (by far the smallest in the family), my younger brother is 15 years old, he is 6'4, black hair and blue eyes (like everyone else in my family). My younger brother takes advantage of my size, the fact that i am the only one in the family with my characteristics and dominates me.  The only person i really spend a great deal of time wiht is my older sister (19, and she, like the rest of my family is a bazillion feet tall), i get along extremely well with her, but I feel like she is the only one who understands me. Aside from being the non dominant sibling at home, at school, everyone looks up to me (not literally) why is this? What can i do to get to my little brother? And one off topic question, next year i am going to univ. should i stay home for it, or go somewhere else?

20070225204635AA5xGkI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I know this is wrong, but how can I get over it? I'm in love with my choir teacher?	Okay, so last year I had a choir teacher, and he was amazing. In every possible way. Fun, appreciated music like no one else I've ever known (we both share a passion for Handel), and cute. He resembled Orlando Bloom a bit. Everyone else had a crush on him, so I told myself that I definitely would NOT, cause that's just wrong. But soon I was falling for him.       I improved my classical singing so much because I tried so hard in his class. I never talked, but I wasn't really a suck-up, just a sweet innocent girl. He liked me very much, I could tell. I've had lots of girls jealous of me, because apparently I was his "pet."      Here's the problem. He's 28. I'm 13. He left last year to move in with his girlfriend--they're engaged now. I'm heartbroken. I thought I was over him, but I saw a picture somewhere of him, and now I'm completely devastated again. I feel so empty. I'm really in love, but I know this is wrong. How do I get over something like this?

Bésame, soy tuyo ahora,    siempre lo he sido,    ámame, a vos me entrego    siénteme, por vos he muerto y he vivido    mírame, embelésate en mi ego.       Dame la vida con tus punzantes colmillos,    tortúrame, entre tus manos frágiles;    Hazme tuyo como la vez primera    deléitame con tus besos ágiles,    átame a tu cuerpo lascivo,    degústame, adué?ame,    envuélveme en besos cautivos,    os juro he de amarte por los siglos.       Invitación para consagrase entre dos cuerpos,    congregación de mentes inmortales,    fusión de espíritus inclementes,    amor que traspasa humanos portales

Ok, so I've known this guy for about 3 months now, and we have just starting hanging out as more than friends the past couple weeks. He already says he loves me (not sure if he means he LOVES me, or if he loves me like a friend and maybe more). But we are both just getting out of long-term relationships and I know that I'm not ready for another long-term. I really love spending time with him and everything, but I'm afraid that he's going to get too attached. We have been completely honest with each other and have agreed that this isn't going to work out in the long run but we can still be together right now, but I don't know if I can take the chance of hurting him. He's been hurt by so many people in the past. Should I keep going as more than friends or should we slow it down for a little while? Also, I don't know if he really means he loves me or if this is just a stupid thing that guys say to try to get you to have sex... HELP!?!?!?! Again, we have talked about not being serious!

We've been friends for months now, we sit beside each other in the class we have together, we always talk to each other, and i really thought she like me. Also because she is such a shy person, she talks with me the way she wouldn't with most people. I know she is single. So today we were talking by here locker and asked her something like, "if you're not too busy this weekend would you like to see a movie?" she said, "I'm going going downtown with some friends Saturday.", meaning no. So i asked if she's still like to go some other time, i don't remember exactly the words she said but sometning like, "i don't think so." The weird thing is that she was smiling the whole time I asked her. Not in a mocking way, but as if she was afraid to say yes. Maybe because she's so shy. The thing is i know i won't get over her because i really do like her alot. but i don't want her to be uncomfortable around me. Can i still be friends with,,,,,,,,,,,

Habia llevado una vida sexual maravillosa con mi novio por más de 2 a?os. En los ultimos, 2 meses él no quiere tener sexo conmigo. Le he preguntado porque no lo quiere hacer más y siempre me dice que es q no me quiere embarazar. No creo q sea una buena excusa ya q siempre nos hemos protegido. He tratado de seducirlo de mil maneras pero no me da resultado. El me manosea toda y cuando le pregunto que si quiere tener sexo conmigo (ya sea indirectamente o no) como sea me dice que no. El se mansturba delante de mi y cuando le digo para que me toque, él no quiere. Esta situación me hace sentir mal emocionalmente y dudar de la estabilidad de nuestro noviazgo. Ya no me da el animo suficiente para estar con él. Yo lo amo pero no se si él sabe, por más que se lo he dicho, que eso que me esta haciendo me deprime. ?Qué puedo hacer al respecto??Cómo logro que vuelva ser el de antes, con la misma pasión?

20070412141018AA8mZQn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	So I'm having a double crush ... so please HELP!!! I know that Raj likes me, but I'm not sure about Jack. Eep!	So, I have these two guy friends ... Raj and Jack. Jack is a prep - smart, dominant, funny, a little arrogant (but it's in a cute way), . Raj is a desi frat boy - bit of a poser, super sweet, funny, loyal, likes to partayy! I have more in common with Jack, but I seem to get along better with Raj.      Two days ago, I found out that Raj likes me ... he told one of my friends. But, he is afraid to admit it to me or ask me out because he knows that I am a premed major and I am really career-oriented and not a party type of girl, and so he thinks that I will reject him (which is not true). On the other hand, Jack is kind of intimidating and is the kind of guy who will never make the first move. I can't tell whether he likes me as more than a friend or as just a friend. I mean, he does seem to want to be around me and he's always friendly.       Should I tell Jack that I like him? How should I do it? Or, should I stick with Raj and ask him out because I know he'll say yes? What if both like me?

A partir des annees 60, les femmes ont beaucoup luttees pour etre reconnues dans la societe, pour que leur talents et leur capacites soient reconnus.       Nancy Sinatra a sorti a ce moment-la son titre "These Boots are Made for Walking" (Ces bottes sont faites pour marcher) pour encourager les femmes dans la lutte contre le sexisme. L annee derniere, Jessica Simpson l a repris de facon differente, en se faisant passer pour une femme quasi-sadomasochiste essayant de faire plaisir aux hommes, et non pas a elle-meme.      Que pensez-vous? La nudite des femmes dans les medias est-elle un progres pour la liberation feminine, ou au contraire represente-t elle l objectification des femmes, un pas en arriere vers le sexisme finallement?

20070514143116AAZXRwX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please help...advice needed...?	My bf just broke up with me over the weekend.  I'm 23 and he's 24 and we'd been dating for about 9 months.  I thought this guy was "the one."  We met for lunch today to discuss, and he said, "I still love you, and I want to be with you, but I just don't think things are going to work out."  Before I left, he hugged me and kissed me passionately goodbye.  I am so lost and upset and depressed.  I feel so incredibly alone.  He was my world - we spent every minute together.  He says he still wants us to be best friends, and that we should still hang out all the time.  I can't imagine hanging out with him and not being together, but at the same time, I don't want to lose him completely.      All I want is to win him back.  His reason for us breaking up is that we've been getting into stupid little spats lately.  But, all couples go through rough patches.  Please help...how do I try and get over this?  How can I win him back?  Do you think there's any hope?      So lost...

Let's sleep there together as snow melts to water,   and know that our hearts and our dreams will go farther.

20070602123014AAEoPbg	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Necesito consejo, ?me puede demandar?	Desde hace mucho tiempo mi relación marital estaba mal y mínimo una vez a la semana mi esposo me corría de la casa pero yo permanecía ahí, hasta que hace 3 días nuevamente me corrió, nada más que esta vez le cumplí y me salí.   Ahora me dice que me va a demandar por abandono de hogar (yo levanté un acta informativa cuando me corrió porque me quiso pegar, para que haya un antecedente) además de que me acusa de fraude, robo, peculado porque dice que hice mal uso de su dinero y tarjetas de crédito durante el tiempo que estuvimos juntos, reconozco que tal vez tenga yo que aceptar parte de esa responsabilidad económica. Ojalá me puedan dar su punto de vista, si es posible que proceda la demanda por lo que comento y hasta dónde tengo yo que responder por los compromisos bancarios.   Estamos casados por bienes mancomunados y la última vez que hablamos le dije que la mitad de todo me corresponde y que si le debo que se quede con todo porque no le voy a pedir cosas materiales. Necesito consejos.

20070827115713AArOy4H	Family & Relationships;Family	E la "colpa" di chi è?	di solito la fase adolescenziale è un momento critico,si tende a vedere i genitori come "nemici"da combattere e si fa il possibile per andargli contro.Ci sono poi quelli che hanno un ottimo rapporto con loro, mamme-amiche e super-papà. ogni adolescente ha i problemi della sua età.......molte volte si da la "colpa "ai genitori se un/a ragazzo/a è in un certo modo o meno...ho fatto i due esempi per non tralasciare quasi nessuno.Ma è possibile che questa "colpa" è sempre la loro? le scelte che fanno alcuni ragazzi non sempre dipendono da loro e così è giusto che sia,l'indipendenza non va insegnata da giovani? o magari ci si ritrova con 40enni a casa per l'abitudine del fatto che ci sono i genitori a decidere per loro?

20070503001309AAyfIH8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How Can A Friendship Be Weird?	I've been friends with this guy for five months now and I really like him, but he got a girlfriend after we had been talking for 2 months and I still ike him and he knows.      Anyway we were arguing and he said that I never went to any of his games when I said I would and I never wanted to go anywhere with him. So I revealed to him that I went to one of his games, but he didn't see me.       He asked me why I didn't tell him and I said because I didn't think he would believe me. Then he responded with we have a weird friendship and that was the last time I talked to him.      What does he mean by that? How is our friendship weird?      BTW I'm 19 and he's 17.

20070702223104AAYpNNY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Old enough to be my daddy..totally grossed out.. how can I get rid of him?	i am friendly and speak to everyone i work with. A guy that works in my dept asked for my phone number one night as we were having an intersting debate but work interrupted us and he asked if we could continue the conversation over the phone. i really dind't want to give him my number but he caught me off guard and I didn't know how to say no so I did. This man has never called but yesterday he inquired about my work schedule and plans for the holidays as co-workers sometimes do. The man knows I got some days off and have no plans because he was there when another co-worker asked. Last night he suggested we should go out together , do something or hang out on the 4th. I am 30 but this man is old enough to be my father, as he is a year younger than my mother. "John" is a nice man, and looks nice for his age, but not my type, and the though of his mustache, chest hair, height and age gross me out! How can I just say no to outside activites with him politely.

20070710154144AAlrHB8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Well, mm, you see, this turns out to be a big problem....?	I went to this talent/church camp thing. ANd I made lots of new friends. This one guy was pretty popular within the group and all my friends like him. he was very touchy, he wouldn't stop touching me. I really wanted him to, but I didn't want to be reallly adamant about it in front of everybody else. He's 19, he has a gf and a little girl. I told him I had a bf back home. He said I'd just be his designated gf. he wouldn't stop it. It ended up somehow we got seperated from everyone else and he tried to rape me but one of my unsuspecting walked in, so he stopped, but the other guy didn't notice anything like that was going on. So, anyways, this guy left camp early, and my other friend had given him my phone # and he wouldn't stop calling me. I stopped answering him. Now I don't want anything to do with guys, I ended up breaking up with my bf because of this even though he was really awesome. I'm just scared, I have no interest in dating anymore. I don't know what's wrong with me. Help?
20070728113242AAJd4hh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I save what i've destroyed?	in the past couple of days i've asked similar questions to this topic about my recent ex who I had dated for two years, i've been told to move on, but I won't I can't I love him too much to just let go of the bond we shared, the magic we had he left for various reasons, all of them at their very essence being me. Now i'm not beating myself up...I really had no clue I was doing these things to him, and the stuff I did know I was working to fix, not well but trying. I became an obsessive girlfriend, I stopped trusting in him, and he has never given me any reason to doubt. never lied never cheated. yet I saw him as my previous ex joe, who was all that liar and a cheater...now my recent ex did everything he could to prove himself to me to cheer me up when I put myself in a deep rut and took more sh*t from me than anyone else would have. he really tried whereas I didn't, I've been afraid to really give in because i am so tired of being hurt. I never gave him a chance and now I want to? how?
20070602200244AAyK8rA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Where do we go from here?	first off if you are going to judge me in any way...don't bother answering this, now with that out of the way. I've been in a two year long distance relationship with this guy that I am madly head over heels in love with. we rarely see each other and I was trying to get him to move in with me. well a few days ago he dumped me.... i've known him for 4 years and he loves me....don't think cause he dumped me he doesn't. he left because I was extremely negative...no matter what he did...I wasn't happy, not because he didn't make me happy because i always saw everything for what it wasn't not what it was. I've been hurt in the past and he's tried so hard to change it all for me....but i never appreciated him. and what he has done for me...until now that is, funny when you lose someone you see what you had. anyway i've been working on seeing things on the bright side and slowly i feel the love he has for me bring him closer....I want him back. and i think he's coming around... what do i do?

20070504092410AAdN9Q9	Family & Relationships;Weddings	I'ts only been a year is it too soon to propose?	C. and I have been together for about a year now (both 24 yo) and I am positive that she is everything I want in life. I am content in the idea of never having to date again. She will be finishing her master degree soon and I am a semester behind her. Upon completion she will be taking a 5 mo. job overseas for experience. I feel it would be a great time and way to show her that I really care and will wait for her to return. I know she is the one but I don't want to pop the question too early. Also, her parents are a bit conservative although she is more liberal. I would like to ask his permission first as well. Although finding a way to talk to him face to face will be difficult. Finally, we talked about our relationship and my worries about her leaving and I told her that I was intending to ask her before she left for Ireland. So she may be expecting a ring b4 she goes and I do not want to let her down if she is anticipating the question, because she seamed to have liked the idea.

Hey all,    There is this girl I know (I am a girl too) We are in the same program at university but we do not have the same interests or goals. She entered into our program just so that she can TELL other people including her parents that she is in pre-med and wants to go into medicine (she admits it). She is barely passing her classes. She ALWAYS tries to call me over for movies or just to hang out. EVEN during exams. She ALWAYS asks for a ride to university, when I have already told her car pooling is really not my thing. She is 19, yet she doesn’t have a car or a license. She NEVER asks our other friends for a ride or to hang out. It is always only me. We have a group of 4 friends who always hang out together; all of us made sure we take the same classes but not the same sections. But she got hold of my schedule (through other people) and changed into my sections. And she tells me, that I am stuck with her in all the classes and I can’t change, as its too late, which is true.   HELP!

We're colleagues and get along splendidly at work. We do touch/slap (at the upper arm) at each other sometimes when we're joking.

While doing that, she didn't look at me at all. This is the first occurence - I was surprised; I don't know what to make out of this? FIY, she's married.

20070531020444AAvTAiW	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Whats The Social role of women in islam?	 http://www.islamawareness.net/Women/        a) As a child and an adolescent       Despite the social acceptance of female infanticide among some Arabian tribes, the Qur'an forbade this custom, and considered it a crime like any other murder.       "And when the female (infant) buried alive - is questioned, for what crime she was killed." (Qur'an 81:8-9).    Criticizing the attitudes of such parents who reject their female children, the Qur'an states:    When news is brought to one of them, of (the Birth of) a female (child), his face darkens and he is filled with inward grief! With shame does he hide himself from his people because of the bad news he has had! Shall he retain her on (sufferance) and contempt, or bury her in the dust? Ah! What an evil (choice) they decide on? (Qur'an 16: 58-59).    Far from saving the girl's life so that she may later suffer injustice and inequality, Islam requires kind and just treatment for her. Among the sayings of Prophet Muhammad (P.) in this regard are the following:    Whosoever has a daughter and he does not bury her alive, does not insult her, and does not favor his son over her, God will enter him into Paradise. (Ibn Hanbal, No. 1957).    Whosoever supports two daughters till they mature, he and I will come in the day of judgment as this (and he pointed with his two fingers held together).       A similar Hadeeth deals in like manner with one who supports two sisters. (Ibn-Hanbal, No. 2104).    The right of females to seek knowledge is not different from that of males. Prophet Muhammad (P.) said:       "Seeking knowledge is mandatory for every Muslim". (AlBayhaqi). Muslim as used here including both males and females.    b) As a wife:       The Qur'an clearly indicates that marriage is sharing between the two halves of the society, and that its objectives, beside perpetuating human life, are emotional well-being and spiritual harmony. Its bases are love and mercy.       Among the most impressive verses in the Qur'an about marriage is the following.       "And among His signs is this: That He created mates for you from yourselves that you may find rest, peace of mind in them, and He ordained between you love and mercy. Lo, herein indeed are signs for people who reflect." (Qur'an 30:2 1).    According to Islamic Law, women cannot be forced to marry anyone without their consent.    Ibn Abbas reported that a girl came to the Messenger of God, Muhammad (P.), and she reported that her father had forced her to marry without her consent. The Messenger of God gave her the choice . . . (between accepting the marriage or invalidating it). (Ibn Hanbal No. 2469). In another version, the girl said: "Actually I accept this marriage but I wanted to let women know that parents have no right (to force a husband on them)" (Ibn Maja, No. 1873).       Besides all other provisions for her protection at the time of marriage, it was specifically decreed that woman has the full right to her Mahr, a marriage gift, which is presented to her by her husband and is included in the nuptial contract, and that such ownership does not transfer to her father or husband. The concept of Mahr in Islam is neither an actual or symbolic price for the woman, as was the case in certain cultures, but rather it is a gift symbolizing love and affection.       The rules for married life in Islam are clear and in harmony with upright human nature. In consideration of the physiological and psychological make-up of man and woman, both have equal rights and claims on one another, except for one responsibility, that of leadership. This is a matter which is natural in any collective life and which is consistent with the nature of man.       The Qur'an thus states:       "And they (women) have rights similar to those (of men) over them, and men are a degree above them." (Qur'an 2:228).    Such degree is Quiwama (maintenance and protection). This refers to that natural difference between the sexes which entitles the weaker sex to protection. It implies no superiority or advantage before the law. Yet, man's role of leadership in relation to his family does not mean the husband's dictatorship over his wife. Islam emphasizes the importance of taking counsel and mutual agreement in family decisions. The Qur'an gives us an example:    "...If they (husband wife) desire to wean the child by mutual consent and (after) consultation, there is no blame on them..." (Qur'an 2: 233).    Over and above her basic rights as a wife comes the right which is emphasized by the Qur'an and is strongly recommended by the Prophet (P); kind treatment and companionship.    The Qur'an states:       "...But consort with them in kindness, for if you hate them it may happen that you hate a thing wherein God has placed much good." (Qur'an 4: l9).       Prophet Muhammad. (P) said:       The best of you is the best to his family and I am the best among you to my family.       The most perfect believers are the best in conduct and best of you are those who are best to their wives. (Ibn-Hanbal, No. 7396)       Behold, many women came to Muhammad's wives complaining against their husbands (because they beat them) - - those (husbands) are not the best of you.       As the woman's right to decide about her marriage is recognized, so also her right to seek an end for an unsuccessful marriage is recognized. To provide for the stability of the family, however, and in order to protect it from hasty decisions under temporary emotional stress, certain steps and waiting periods should be observed by men and women seeking divorce. Considering the relatively more emotional nature of women, a good reason for asking for divorce should be brought before the judge. Like the man, however, the woman can divorce her husband with out resorting to the court, if the nuptial contract allows that.    More specifically, some aspects of Islamic Law concerning marriage and divorce are interesting and are worthy of separate treatment.       When the continuation of the marriage relationship is impossible for any reason, men are still taught to seek a gracious end for it.       The Qur'an states about such cases:       When you divorce women, and they reach their prescribed term, then retain them in kindness and retain them not for injury so that you transgress (the limits). (Qur'an 2:231). (See also Qur'an 2:229 and 33:49).       c) As a mother:       Islam considered kindness to parents next to the worship of God.       "And we have enjoined upon man (to be good) to his parents: His mother bears him in weakness upon weakness..." (Qur'an 31:14) (See also Qur'an 46:15, 29:8).    Moreover, the Qur'an has a special recommendation for the good treatment of mothers:    "Your Lord has decreed that you worship none save Him, and that you be kind to your parents. . ." (Qur'an 17:23).    A man came to Prophet Muhammad (P) asking:    O Messenger of God, who among the people is the most worthy of my good company? The Prophet (P) said, Your mother. The man said then who else: The Prophet (P) said, Your mother. The man asked, Then who else? Only then did the Prophet (P) say, Your father. (Al-Bukhari and Muslim).    A famous saying of The Prophet is "Paradise is at the feet of mothers." (In Al'Nisa'I, Ibn Majah, Ahmad).    "It is the generous (in character) who is good to women, and it is the wicked who insults them."

20070602184625AAAjTHm	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Todo ha acabado ya?	Tengo 39 a?os, casado desde hace 2, con un hijo de 4 a?os al cual adoro y una hija de 12 (del primer matrimonio de mi esposa).  Me comprometi envuelto en una aventura pasional, pero no quise casarme, sin embargo hubo un momento de mi vida que ya no pense en mi, sino en ella y en los BBs, yo ya habia vivido lo suficiente y me propuse quererlos.   Solo dios sabe que hice todo lo mejor que pude, pero ella (no deberia decirlo) hizo que ese amor se acabara.   He estado deprimido en etapas de altas y bajas y aparecio una jovencita que me ha devuelto la vida.   Mi esposa me ha encarado, le han dicho que me han visto con ella, y parece que nunca me lo va a perdonar.   Ya me case de dormir en el sofa y de tratar de hablar con ella para salvar la relacion.   Me voy, se que empezare desde cero, pues mi sueldo solo alcanza para pagar una habitacion y cumplir con mis hijitos (mi esposa se queda con la casa, espero quiera seguir pagandola).   No se si pueda salir adelante, no se si sera lo mejor.

Once he was dating my friend and when they were making out he sayd my boyfriends name out loud. And he once said that he would buy my boyfriend anything just so he would be his friend. I have had talks with my bf and he keeps telling me it isnt true. So I dont bring it up anymore but it is bugging me!! What do you guys think?

20070702013149AAcjK6D	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I will never fall in love?	I am 18 year old guy and like to be alone. People say u cant control love, maybe u cant control the feeling, but u can control your actions towards that feeling. I dont have feelings like that and only give a damn about myself and only need myself and no one else. I will not lose my edge by falling in love never happen, I am a warrior. I highly doubt it will anyways cuz I just have never had feelings of love in any form towards anyone. except maybe before my parents died when I was 6, but I dont think I felt anything when they died so I dont think I really cared. But why do people think everyone needs love, I never needed it in my 18 years and never will?  Maybe I am just unique in that I need absolutely no one in my life, I am an Island and people dont understand how I can be like this.  Sometimes I feel I dont fit in anywhere, but thats just because I really dont, I dont think there are many people like me who need absolutely no one and have almost no emotions.

Then the last 2 days he has been distant, not texting me as much etc. I asked him, he has been busy with work, which I know is true since he is the manager. I told him i need to know how he is feeling; he is not very expressive with his feelings at all. Is it too soon to expect him to be expressive with me or should it have happened already?

On se c?toie, on phantasme, on est tenté, intentionné, puis on se fait des avances. Même si la relation ne tient pas à un fil d'affection, le sentiment d'avoir un courant d'intimité s'éveille toujours et brise les liens d'amitié.Or, il s'avère que la vraien et pure amitié est celle qui vit en l'absebce de pensées intimes, de sentiments d'amour, de conquête. Rares sont ces quelques personnes, de sexes opposés ou quelquefois de mêmes sexes,  qui tissent un lien d'amitié fraternel, et, le plus souvent, sont-ils déjà en couples.L'amitié entre deux personnes de sexes opposés n'est possible que si l'une et l'autre renferment déjà des sentiments pour quelqu'un d'autre, si elles sont déjà amoureuses d'autrui. Ou encore, en l'absence strict de tout sentiment de ce genre. Le cas échéant se verra formidable d'exister...

20070728172503AA6iBnf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Did taking a break from the relationship help or hurt your relationship?	Fiance decided that we needed to take a break.  He said that he needs to find himself, that he's not happy, that he doesn't love me any more, that picking me up feels like a chore.  If he misses me and wants to get back together than we'll get back together.  If not then in a few weeks when he's sure he'll tell me and we'll break up for real.  We spend our entire weekends together, which is the only time he has.  He's over worked and under paid.  His grandma who lives with him died 7 days ago.  I think that maybe a break would be good for us because we are so dependent on eachother, or maybe it's just me.  I'm very needy and I guess he feels smothered by me.  He wants to have some free time without me always whining for attention.  I said that I would work on it and try to be better, but he was determinded that we take a break.  I'm really hoping that he comes back to me quickly.  Did a break help your relationship, or did you end up breaking up for good?

20070802224922AAdIEEj	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Comment s'en remettre?	mon amoureux vient de me larguer, il dit qu'il ne veut pas passer à l'étape supérieure qui serait vivre ensemble, qu'il ne m'aime plus assez pour cela. je n'arrive pas à comprendre comment il peut tout d'un coup ne plus m'aimer. tout me semble très soudain. j'ai vraiment l'impression que je m'en remettrais jamais. surtout que avant lui je n'ai jamais été très doué pour séduire ou garder un mec. je reste persuadée que mon ami était parfait en tout cas pour moi. je suis s?re qu'il fait une énorme erreur mais finalement c'est moi qui en souffre. je l'aime tellement que je n'arrive même pas à lui en vouloir où à le détester. Aidez-moi, c'est la première fois que je me fais larguer, je suis restée des années avec lui. comment pourrais-je vraiment vivre hors de ses bras? je suis comme un poisson abandonné par son bocal.

He's at a party, while I'm at home recovering from a car accident I go into last night. (No serious injuries. Some bruised ribs, sore back and neck, messed up knee.) He didn't come see me in the hospital last night, even though I was taken there by ambulance. He claimed he didn't have money for gas, plus he had hurt his back at work. His friend took me to the clinic, where I was then transported by ambulance, and his friend met me at the hospital. Anyways, my boyfriends back is feeling fine enough to be at a party DRUNK AS HELL! He's always mean to me when he's drunk. I've had enough. I want to break up with him, but I have no friends, besides the people he takes me around. I go to college, but haven't made any friends there yet, even though I've tried really hard. I'm afraid to break up with him, because I'll literally be all alone. But he hurts me alot. I'm so afraid of not having anyone to talk to.

20090203082032AABAclD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys, would you get sick of dating a 'p0rn star' look a like?	This is a genuine question   My husband sister is very 'high maintance looking'.  Don't get me wrong she has a amazing body (although part of this is thanks to a boob job), she has long blonde hair (extentions) and bigish lips (not freaky big just bee sting big thanks to injections) and a all year tan and long extentions.  Shes a really nice girl although she doesnt have many female friends, partly cos of how she looks.  Anyways she keeps dating these guys but everytime somewhere along the line they cheat on her.  Its getting her really down.  Shes very sexually forward and i have told her to take a step back but its all she knows.  I would have thought most guys would love having a p0rn star look a like girlfriend but they all seem to tire of her in the end.  Yes she is very into her looks and shes only semi smart but can hold a conversation.   Also i know i shouldnt but i feel i constantly compare myself to her and wonder if my husband wishes i looked more 'polished' like her.  I feel she gives me a very wide gap to fill as i am normal looking (people say i am pretty but i have by no means a amazing body like her).  I don't know why i let it bother me so much...but yeah just wondered what your opinion is?

20090203082205AAkiNJi	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Sisters fighting about their weddings- what is an in-law do to?	I have declared I am Switzerland.......   Sister 1 is getting married in Vegas and after getting the price of everything- we are saying NO THANKS.    Sister 2 just decided after living with her boyfriend for 10 years and having children that she wants to get married right before her sister.  Sister 1 is ignoring the whole thing and refuses to discuss it.  Sister 2 wants all this help and everyone assumes that because I am an artist- I am going to do all this stuff.  So when sister 3 called me last night- I said.   Sister 1 will be getting a we decline/SORRY and a gift.   Sister 2- I can't help and I'll worry about it when I get an invite. (because I don't think it's really going to happen).   Sister 4 is a drama queen and I don't care.      Sister 3 was completely thrown back by my causal replies.... but I just don't have the time to get sucked into this drama....  I don't care about the dates of each shower and each wedding... I don't care about the theme and I don't care who's mother said what!  If I can go, I go, If I can't Oh well......  I figure it out when I get the invites.      Not to be rude but none of my husband family- helped or cared about my wedding.  They complained constantly wanted to plan my shower but didn't want to pay for it type stuff....  They were just a complete annoyance.  They gave me completely thoughless cheap gifts and Sister 2 and 4- didn't even give me a card or a hand written note- NOTHING.  Even my husband is at the point were he doesn't care if we attend either weddings.      Why are they trying to involve me and why are they getting angry that I don't care?

20090203081644AA3xSp3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My Affair Is About To Become a Problem?	I like her alot, almost too much considering I have a girlfriend & it's my fault that I didn't tell her that before we started sleeping together but now she does know that I live with someone.      She's been pretty cool but I see it about to become a problem for many reasons (1) because I really like her, so much that I'm finding myself going to her when she wants me just to keep her around, including dipping off from my gf. (2) because when we're out with friends her & I are very touchy feely & people are starting to notice that something is going on between us. (3) because she's starting to act mad recently about me not returning her calls, not telling her where I work or showing up on time.   I expressed this to her in hopes that she'll get the point and ease up on her behavior a little or I may have to ease up on her just to keep the confusion down. I don't want to end it but I can see things about to get out of control with us.      Please don't tell me I shouldn't be cheating because I'm going to keep doing it. Just advice on how to keep this situation from becoming a problem?

Alright, So theres this guy whos been my on and off again boyfriend for the last 3 years since i've known him. We started off as friends first then he asked me out. After that we broke up and i was really pissed at him because he Broke up with me ( a distance thing), so after i cooled down he told me he still liked me and And that he couldnt keep me off his mind and all his other relationships failed ect... because he hadnt gotten over me ( repeat this same senario for  4 times over the next 3 to 4 years) and everytime i cool down he'll show up and we date for months then something will happen.    But, since we've "gone out" so many times it feels weird when i go out with another guy than him. So I really need to get over him or else i'll be 50 and casually dating this guy. So what can i do to get over him, when everytime he and i are civil towards each other and not fighting i like him all over again and  feel the same way i did in the beginning when i dont want to.      Thnks,      Alyssa

20090203082228AATNJ5C	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Where can I get a thick wedding album?	My wife is working on our wedding scrapbook and has one that holds 12" x 12" pages.  With the embellishments she's putting on the pages, they're proving to be pretty thick.  She did 24 pages in the 12 sleeves, but has at least another 24 pages to go (if not 36), and although the album she got has an expansion kit (12 more pages) the wedding album is very thin and already almost doesn't close.  She's afraid if she adds more pages it certainly wont close.    Does anyone know where she can buy a thicker album that supports the 12" x 12" pages?  Thanks, and any ideas would be appreciated.

20070914215021AANG6Q2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I e-mail my crush?	i found my crush's e-mail address in our class contact sheet.      i didn't 'officially' ask for her e-mail address so if i e-mail her, then she might think i'm a crazy stalker or something      but at the same time, she probably has some interest in me. she definitely glances at me alot. she even chuckles at my silly jokes when i was talkin to the other person, not her.   also we talked a little too but it was about school work so nothing serious.      we can't meet face to face very often(once a week). therefore she might like my e-mail because then we can keep communicate even when we can't see each other      she's a cute girl, she talks to a few guys, but i never seen her hang around in campus with other guys. so maybe she is single right now, but of course i don't know anything about her personal life      should i e-mail her or not?   if it works, then we can get much closer. but if it doesnt work too well, then she might start to avoid me.      oh, and what should i talk about?   examples plz

20070924153336AAXxh9n	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Boy Problem?	Well, I like this guy Taylor. His best friend is David.  We went to six flags once in july and Taylor and I made out twice. A couple months later, we went again. Taylor told me he wanted to kiss me but couldn't. I asked why and he told me this: :      David has this huge crush on you. He's liked you for two years and does NOT want me to tell you about it.  . He told me I wasn't allowed to sit by you today because he thinks you would fall for me. He is so obsessed with you.      So at first I didn't believe him. Then when Taylor was sitting alone and David was sitting with his friend Brad, I looked over at Taylor and told him to come sit by me anyway. Taylor did and David gave him the most evil look I've ever seen.  .       Eventually I got my friend to tell David I just wanted to be friends. He got mad and stopped talking to me for a couple minutes.      So I like Taylor but I'm afraid I won't be able to go out with him in fear of Taylor and I losing our friend David. What do i do??

20080130152748AAt96cs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I sabotaged a great relationship and cannot get over it?	For almost 7 years I was with a really wonderful, supportive guy who loved me for exactly who I am and wanted me to be happy.  He wasn't perfect, but he stuck with me even though I cheated on him and left him.  It took him a long time to get over me- it's been almost 2 years.     But since we broke up, my life has sucked.  I moved away from the town I love and my friends believing that I couldn't share them with him, with the intention of starting a life of my own.  I started dating a guy who is exactly the opposite of him; new guy is jealous and emotionally abusive.  I even told new guy I'd marry him, probably because I wanted to believe that the reason I broke up with guy #1 is because I had met "the one."     I broke off the engagement because he's jealous and abusive, and am in the process of extricating myself from the relationship.  I live in a new town, have few friends, and just really miss my old life, my old friends, my old boyfriend.     I still love him, he has a new girlfriend.

20080306165950AAFvotH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What does this girl want?	Over the past five months I became friends with this girl in my physics class. She always made an effort to talk to me and be nice, and even made me a cd for me after she asked me if I liked a band. She also then copied notes for me and asked me my number so we could study together. When we got done studying and I was walking to my car she stopped and picked me up and we talked in her car. We also went and got coffee at school the next day after she waited a few mins for me to finish our exam. She then later dropped out of her lab project group to be in mine after I couldn't get in hers. She then asked me to goto church with her sometimes, and we've studied together outside of school a few times. In passing one time she said didn't want a relationship when talking about this guy from church that called her...we've been hanging out for a few months now at her house or going out to other places.
20080306170026AANoo1T	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Did you ever become 'great friends' with your ex-boyfriend?	Myself and my ex-boyfriend dated for 4 yrs and that was 5 yrs ago.  He moved to a different state but we kept in contact as friends, by email and sometimes called each other.  I was very close to his family and his parents were always very warm to me.  His Mom was in my city a while back and invited me to come visit them.  She kept saying how glamorour I looked.  So I came to visit.  Now I'm here and his Dad tells me that I am his only close friend (he is  a v quiet, shy & sensitive guy).  We are getting on great but I am worried about restarting in case we break up again.  (He ended it before as he couldn't commit).  Any advice please?   So far, we are just friends with nothing physical.

20080322193632AAxjwrl	Family & Relationships;Friends	Different from peers, feel like loner. Social anxiety. Never drank alcohol or been to party [17 y.o. H.S.]?	I got social anxiety... 17 year old senior.   It seems I don't have anything in common with people my age. Half the people my age are either way more intelligent than I am, so I feel stupid around them. In addition my interests are usually not matched by others. The other half seem to be into the party/getting drunk all the time style of living. (They still manage to get really good grades.) I'd probably turn beet red at a party and feel sick with the amount of anxiety I'd have, and wouldn't have anything to contribute. I am clueless about socializing (especially with girls), unless with close friends. (who are all guys...) I find myself wondering why there's so much underage drinking? Every weekend all these groups of students have partys and get-togethers. People going out, talking to each other, acting all happy and ****... I am usually a nobody at my school. A shadow if you will...    How to cope? I'd feel sick even thinking about going to a party etc... would rather not drink as well

20080330075355AAZzFWb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Advice on relationships...?	Okay so gonna tell you a long and involved story and hopefully you could give me advice on my next move.   Lemme start with me 5'11 185 got a small amount of fat in areas but muscular (I play football) Hazel eyes. Not popular at all but not a nerd and I have few friends that are girls. Also i am very self conscious and have trouble opening up to others and saying what i really feel.   Now onto the story. Last year I was in a latin class and got to know this girl really well. Naturally I had a crush on her and was never brave enough to ask her out or even try to hang out with her. Over the summer i kinda talked to her online but not really. My crush has maybe died. I dunno. So I was talking with her online about a month ago and she suggested i ask her friend to Junior prom. Her friend is in 2 of my classes but i didnt know her real well but I asked her. She seemed excited. Junior prom was last friday and I was really awkward as always.

20080331171224AAVUGx2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is there a chance he will leave his girlfriend for me?	So I work with this guy and we have had an attraction towards each other for a long time.  He has a girlfriend 1 1/2 years who he says he loves.  A bunch of us went out from work and we ended up staying behind.  We were sitting in his car and kissed and he told me how he had been fantasizing about it since he met me.  I told him i felt the same way.  Long story short we have begun a secret affair that no one knows about.  We get along so well, he says all sorts of sweet things about me but only sees me when he can.  He says he thinks his girlfriend is the one for him and he hates lying but we dont stop and it doesnt seem like he wants to....he says he isnt sexually satisfied in their relationship.  I have never cheated on anyone before so i dont know what the chances are of him leaving her for me.  I really like him though and think we could have a great relationship together.  i know its wrong and wouldnt want to be in her shoes he said it would be over with them if she ever found out

20090203081520AA4Il8c	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Divorce and money advice?	I am based in the UK      My wife moved out over 1 year ago. She has massive debts and never contributed towards the house.      I continued to pay for the mortgage and now I have a new job in a new area. My wife will not drop the price of the house as she wants the money but it will not sell at its current price!      This will mean, I have to pay for a mortgage and rent, which I will not be able to afford.      As such, I planned to rent it out, until we sell the property to cover my costs.      Now my wife wants to move back in the house and only pay for half of the mortgage. Can she do this? The mortgage is a joint one but she never contributed to it and no longer lives there!      I am filing for divorce, as we speak and I am worried as she is playing games with me. What can I do please?

When he sits there is this big bulge in his pants.When he walks there is something long showing through his jeans or slacks.  Question is could my eyes be fooling me about him always being excited? Or could there be something else in his pants to give the appearance of a constantly erect penis? When I say constant I mean the whole time were together ALWAYS hard.     If it is some contrapment how should I feel about this?

20090203082300AAEjcK0	Family & Relationships;Friends	How can you find out the age of someone?	My daughter has a friend who is claiming to be 15 but, I believe she is much older.  I also believe that she may be a bad influence on her.  I don't know very many particulars but, there is someone that I am questioning the true age of.  All the details I know are her name, city, schools attended.  I can probably assume the city she was born in.  Is there any way to legally find out her date of birth?   She has a Myspace page but it says she's 71 and this would be a girl under the age of 21 (most likely).  She doesn't have a facebook page. Any ideas?
20090203082643AAq4lQL	Family & Relationships;Family	Lame question, I know. Birthday gift ideas for mom?	My mother's 40th birthday is coming up on Valentine's Day. We are very very close but I have never been very good about gift ideas... I have moved out since last year, and started my own family halfway across the country so we won't get to see her this year :(    She doesn't like jewelry. She's a realtor, and is super busy with work. She's easygoing and very funny. She's not the type to spend money on herself. Doesn't spend a lot of time in the kitchen and she has been on a diet, so having candy or food shipped to her house would not be a good idea.   Best thing I can think of so far is buying something online and having it shipped, or maybe calling a local spa and setting up a spa package. I don't know!!

20090203082522AA9iPcp	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What is the Texas court's view on child support when there is a true 50/50 custody arrangement?	I have heard many things... For instance I have heard there is a formula deference courts use in comparing the ratio of dad's income vs. mom's income. I have heard that there shouldn't be any child support when a true 50-50 arrangement is in place. I have also heard that the judge has a lot of discrepancy since there is not a set guideline like in standard child custody possession order. Please keep your answer specific to TX.

20090203083712AAWnT7Y	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is he ignoring me? What should I do?	So I've been seeing this guy (not officially dating, but it basically felt like it) for about a month now and we were really close, we've kissed a zillion times, I spent the night at his house a ton of times, (but didnt have sex, which is nice that he didnt pressure me) and went on dates and stuff a ton of times. The last time I saw him was last week, after we went out to dinner, went bowling and rented a movie. Then I spent the night and we just cuddled in his bed like always, nothing different. He even paid for everything. When I left he kissed me goodbye and said he would text me later to see if we could hang out that night.      He never texted me. I brushed it off and texted him the next night just saying that I thought I was getting sick again (cause we both had gotten sick) No response. That was wednesday. Then last night I just texted him and said "heyy :)" and no response. Wtf? why is he ignoring me? He seemed really into me and said he missed me all the time and it honestly seemed genuine. I've been played before and this didnt seem the same, and this really hurts.      What should I do? text him or just not contact him until he returns the favor? I dont want to seem desperate and text him again but I dont want this to fall apart either. this really sucks :( why could he be doing this? :(

20090203083221AAqVwh6	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Should She still be my maid of honour?	I have to re-write my question because the previous one was deleted and I really wanted opinions...not sure why it was deleted because, nothing terrible was said!      Anyhow, to make this shorter, We were friends in highschool  became friends again in 2006, slowly but surely.  but now, I question if we truly are friends.  Are they even being friends to me?      I ask that because there have been several times, when I wasn't invited to things or asked if I wanted to join them when they were already there.  Really, I think it's rude to invite someone when you already planned the day without them.    Okay my maid of honor is pregnant, I'm happy for her, I have even changed my wedding date for, was suppose to be in March, but now it's either in June or July, probably July or even August.  Just so she can have time to recoop and get things somewhat settled at home.  I'm not being a bridezilla i'm not even being selfish.    A month ago, I asked her if she could help me out with centerpieces and she never returned my phone call.  So that never got planned or any ideas thrown out.      Another friend is getting married May 30 and she helped plan her bridal shower etc..than I wondered where is mine?  Am I suppose to have one?  So I don't know.    I love this friend of mine that is why I'm willing to hold off my wedding until she is settled with her first born.  But I just don't feel like we are even friends now, well, not how we should be.    She helped me look for my dress BUT she had a doctor's appt on that same day in the same city as David's Bridal.  She even asked me if I could drive myself to the gown store, which didn't make sense at all.  Than to find out she thought I wanted to be in the check up room with her and I had said ummm no, that's personal and I'll sit in the waiting room.      I feel like finding them and being friends with now, has hurt me more than being without them; what should I do?
20090203083638AAOeblS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Emotional dependency or real love?	When I wake up and before I sleep, I think of him.      Whenever I hear any love songs/break up songs, it reminds me of him.      When I feel or see something happy, I wish he's beside me now.      If he's sick/sad or lonely, I'll always be there for him.      I will do his laundry, iron his cloth, can learn how to cook ( just for him )      He just keep lingers on my mind 24/7.      I'll do anything to make him life comfortable.      I do get angry for his nasty habits ( getting drunk ) but I still accept for what he is.      He digs his nose and fart in front of me, I still love him.      I keep reading his IM messages, SMS es over and over again.      The thoughts of him makes me happy and hurt sometimes.      What he said is always very important to me.      Always looking forward to see him or talk to him.      Seeing him sleeping beside me makes me contented.      Likes doing things for him, just for him.      Likes to tidy up his room.            Is this real love for a person?      WE been together for 1 year and 4 months.

20090203082418AAftWys	Family & Relationships;Family	I am confused at how I should be as a step mom and it's been almost 5 years?	I have two step kids 7 and 10, girl and boy. They come over every other weekend and depending on the year a week or two spring and fall or summer and winter. Overall they are pretty good kids, so far 'cause who knows what happens during teenage years! When they are here, we get along pretty well but I am afraid to get too close to them. I don't want to confuse them or their mom to think I am trying to take her place because she has made similar comments like that in the past, even if I just so much as read to them. My husband says it's fine, he loves seeing me spend time with them but I do not want anyone to think that I am stepping on their toes or something. I know that my husband does most of the disciplining. Now that I've had a hyst. she knows I can't have kids and that poses a new problem as well. Plus she thinks that because I don't have my own children, I have no way of knowing what may help when they are acting unruly or my stepson starts having problems in school. I have tried offering her suggestions and the response is always that I'm not a mom so I don't know anything. That makes me feel horrible and I've even considered suicide so I won't have to deal with this anymore. I think about this all the time, it's like I don't matter and I'm intentionally ignored when I know I can help.
20090203082343AAvqkWu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My guy friend is confussing me... are we just friends or is it more?	we have been friends for years but haven't hung out in a long time... about a year ago we bumped into each other and started hanging out again. the first night we really hung out he tried to have sex with me but that was really uncomfortable. we still hung out almost everyday after that and he has always sent mixed signals... everyone we are friends with thought we were dating and would ask all the time and we would both get defensive him more than me though... about 7 month into it we had a fallen out and didn't talk for about 3-4 months. i had decided not to ever talk to him again and then this new years eve he called something about his voice just told me he was really sorry about everything that had happened... i ended up going over there and we talked about everything and we have been hanging out ever since... but know i'm all confused again... i really do like him and i would love to tell him or at least ask him how he feels but every time i bring the subject up he gets all weird and will either hurry up and change the subject or hang up on me... i just don't know what to do...
20090203082452AAOpHDt	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do women complain about men?	Seriously they complain about the jerks mistreating them and because of that they are mean towards guys who actually don't.  They have a thing on dr.phil about men on friday and how they mistreat women.  The thing is not all of us are like that you see you women like bad guys because they are obviously "interesting"  Look I have hobbies and i take risks hell i'm in college as well.   It just bothers me because every time i have a conversation with women they tend to be negative about men.  Advice for women you choose these guys no one tells you to choose them and don't complain then if they are mistreating.  Cause there are very worthy guys out there who are sick of you women being selfish!
20090203082539AApwf1z	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My hubby felt dizzy in the PATH train this morning commuting to work. I am so worried. Please calm me down?	My hubby felt dizzy in the PATH train this morning commuting to work.   Ok here's what happened. We ate dinner at 9.30 pm yesterday and he got up as usual at 7.30 to go to work. I dont know if you know this but the PATH trains stations are unbelievably hot. He did not have breakfast, he usually does not. He eats breakfast inside the office cafeteria. He says he wore his muffler, heavy jacket everything and did not get a place to sit in the train and started feeling dizzy. After this a person gave up his seat for him.      I love him so much and am so so tense today. I am thinking about the worst possible situations.Please help me. Could it be something very bad..should I ask him to go for a whole body check up?

20090203082732AAi8dKH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What book should I have my girlfriend read to help her speak my love language?	I'm a big believer in Gary Chapman's "The Five Love Languages".  It's helped me in my life in dealing with many people.  My love language is words of affirmation and my girlfriend is terrible at it.  She's offered to read a book on it but I'm not sure which book would be best.      Any ideas on which would help her learn how to speak words of affirmation?

20090203084147AAwL6Zx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Last night, my boyfriend of three months broke up with me.. HELP!?	He broke up with me because of his school work. He says he's failing because all he can do is think about me and skips his homework to talk to me. In a way I understand, but I'm still deeply hurt and heartbroken. What really hurts is that he said forever but couldn't make it to Valentines Day. He doesn't know if we'll ever get back together, but I am praying that we do. He is the best thing in my life and now he's gone. I need any help you can give me.       Thanks....
20090203084208AAvO3Uq	Family & Relationships;Friends	Was my friend right to accept the other invite? ( see below) ?	So I called up a good platonic male friend and said I might be able to get a plus one to this really posh, glam black-tie do in 10 days times as my date. if so did he want to come? he said, absolutely, he'd be there. And that I should let him know as soon as I had confirmation. six days before I was still waiting to hear for def re the plus one but it was looking good when I suddenly get a call from him saying someone else had asked him to the same do and as he didn't know whether my invite had come through or not he'd gone ahead and accepted and he'd see me there. Am i right to feel annoyed that he didn't at least call me first to discuss it?
