66da597893d7b1d350884f2a7ae54441aa	I'm not sure why you think anyone on this board would know.    I suggest the creation of a Bestiality board on Yahoo! Answers b/c so many people apparently think that GLBT people enjoy screwing around with animals.  Maybe it should go near the "Religion and Spirituality" page so all the Christian zealots can easily post answers there and leave the GLBT board alone.    The only "animals" GLBT have sex with are humans.|`|d09f9f421df80c0b6d67a419cfaa9464aa	Horsing around ? I should hope not.

I agree that it isn't the right category to discuss it and it isn't.   To answer your question, no it isn't prevelant but does exist in north american society for sure.|`|4cb79d5c81faf052c1c57b347e5c2f5aaa	I dont know about prevalent but i do know its freaking illegal in all states.

b605d25d85af3c4abff6c0dfd990f16eaa	Not all strippers are prostitutes, and not all prostitutes are strippers.|`|AA10819547	They all come under the category of "sex workers".  The differences in role are plain.  The stigma society attaches to one is considerably less than with the other.    Oh but wait there is no market for strip joints or prostitution, is there?    I can't believe people are so far up their own self-importance that they blame the symptoms and not the causes|`|AA12057892	Honey if you don't know the difference between watching a person and having sex with a person....    Well there is just no hope for you.|`|86d3d50ed2a866f1036c8000eabf75aaaa	i dont know...sorry  but i will be waitin for the answers too|`|3a72219446c9a5a85bf1448f6d4a2860aa	Yes it's very different.  For one thing no one has gotten an STD from watching someone strip.  No one has accidentally gotten Pregnant by letting someone watch them strip.  People aren't commonly arrested for watching strippers.|`|d8e6de16dd119fb844027ad5c95eb0f9aa	i think they are both immoral and degrading. but at least strippers don't have sexual contact with their clients, so they won't be catching or spreading diseases..      i'm just amazed that people actually waste money to watch strippers.. look but can't touch doesn't see like a good deal to me..  plus, why look, or even touch, what doesn't love you?
AA10819547	And this is LGBT how?|`|AA11148177	Um, that doesn't justify a double standard at all, it's simply a lame excuse for men to not evolve past cave men.     Grow up.|`|0378ee22f1ad5f3c24b76ceff6d7d372aa	Garbage!|`|7b2eac17b18fffb30ee3959c6f6405fcaa	I think you may has asked this in the wrong section hun!    As lesbians as a rule tend to be more promiscus then stright women I know I got a lot before I settled down with my life partner|`|AA11370896	Ok on this site that does not work.  Men can get men just as easily.  So it seems men are the ones that are easy in either case.  Sorry guys.|`|AA11542626	This double standard was born out of ignorance and the fragile male ego and the need to feel dominant. But nowadays, we all know that guys are not the sex studs they might try to be, and women are not all prudish.  Gay men get what they want when they hook up with men.  Lesbians are happy with other women. This works out because of not only the natural attraction, but also because most women are too smart for men's come-ons. The guys have to work hard to get women into bed because they aren't as smart as women in this aspect. Regardless, there should be no expectation of promiscuity for either sex, nor should there be any expectations of either sex being prudish. It is simply an unfair standard which was most likely patterned after the bible, where most of our rubbish has originated.|`|c0227820f2e346860db7fc930f16205faa	Oh yeah, actually most girls laugh about that,  We make getting laid look sso easy, don't we.      BUT YOU BOYS LOVE US!!!!!    You see but the REAL definition of a playa, is one who doesn't NEED game.     ANd that would be us FEMALES. But I wouldn't want to be called a "stud"  Beautifull is fine.

AA11119479	For some people, it is an anti-Christian symbol.|`|c6ed324bb70246f047e05d3ca9d5e4fdaa	3 meanings: It could mean so much respect for the Lord you cannot bear to have a cross so you have an inverted one. (One religious man was buried on an inverted cross I think.) It could also be part of Satanism. And the third is a form of being anti-Christian and possible atheistic. I have an inverted cross necklace that shows off the third meaning.|`|6103a707907495e73e41bf8515944ed1aa	An inverted cross is a Satanic sign.|`|7211513118a3b8efe064939e53104446aa	some people say that it is satan's symbol|`|AA10831165	Anti-Christianity|`|188ff9805fe165a7e468b9114c7e6b56aa	It has been used as a satanic symbol for the last couple of hundred years (for which read - a Christian-bating symbol, since few satanists believe in either God or satan).    But it can also be used as the cross of St Peter (its earlier use).    A Christian-hating guy in my (british) high-school (where wearing a symbol of your faith isn't banned) used to wear an inverted cross to annoy the Christians. Until the Christian Union got together and decided to make a point of always complimenting him on his cross of St Peter. He stopped wearing it pretty sharpish.|`|f1c684ccacce6e8f901c6f95b35498adaa	i dont see why it is bad because Peter was crucified upside down|`|f57c0d71ffcdf92f926cc8b5116648c7aa	It's largely associated with Satanic cults who's mission is to poke fun at Christianity. Not to be confused with Pagans and Wiccans, who respect all religions and choose not to prevert their symbols. Those same Satanic cults invert the Pentacle for the same reasons.
AA11452268	I'm not sure what you're asking, but I'll give it a shot.    The word "of" is used primarily to show possession or participation in a group. Examples:    He's the father of my child.  Susan is the only one of the students who knows the answer.  Some of his books are quite fascinating.  Which of the items did you wish to order?    The word "at" is used primarily to describe location or time. Examples:  John is at the office.  The kids are playing at Michael's house.  They're going to the play at 9 o'clock.    The word "on" is used primarily to describe a position above or over something else.  There is a squirrel on the roof.  Do you need a ladder to stand on?  What are you doing standing on that table?  Your watch is on the desk.      There are other ways to use these words, too, however.

She's what you call a "f@g-hag". If that term is offensive, i apologize. But its real. These are women who are straight, but just LOVE LOVE LOVE gay men. They have lots of gay male friends but tend to shy away from lesbians (fear of being turned out maybe?) They also tend to treat her gay friends like puppies...."see what my gay friend can do??!!"  They really are quite annoying at times. You just need to shut her uo for a second and make her listen to you. Tell her that you arent her "toy" to be shown off at show & tell. You are an adult and you demand to be treated like one. If she respects you, she'll stop.

You are the first gay guy friend she's had, unfortunately, and so she wants to know what it's like being one.  Just sit her down one day and talk to her about how it makes you feel; she'll listen if she's a good friend.  Tell her that you need to wait to come out until you are ready, and that any sooner would make you highly uncomfortable.  She seems nice, if a little nosy, and I'm sure she will listen to you.

So far every individual person has his/her own path, some parallel so closely others that these people form groups, but if ever asked they are all still individually seeking GOD. This is because of humanities free will.  No two humans agree 100% with each other about all the issues of GOD, getting to heaven, etc.  All the Wiccan believe quite seriously that they have a valid path to eternal rewards - equal to the other religions.  I would never suggest their prayers hold no more or less power than yours or anyone.   That this person insulted you is obvious and hurts this person, not you.   So I would kindly respond that this is a sad event, not a funny one. That a wiccan lost control of themselves, and you were insulted is not a laughing occurrence.  Having read many of your questions and answers I know this wiccan does not know you as the caring person others do. Telling a woman she should never have children is still an effective insult as it has been for over 8000 years.   Be at peace, many know you, and this wiccan may in time - to find out he/she insulted a very good person today. Then he/she will have to deal with the stain on their conscience.|`|fe4bcd707f99297a5c3200c947a6ae8baa	Good point.|`|0b0bcec6a15a46130df62b363e36abe3aa	if you think that religion is child abuse, then you'd let your kids run rampant becoming nightmarish juvenile delinquent for the inability to tell them "NO" Thus I said I hoped you never had any, simple as that|`|81ba51d072770cc82840f6d0500a2b8baa	I'd need more information to determine if it was funny.

Cada pueblo debe conservar su propio idioma, reivindicarlo y valorarlo, porque es uno de los elementos ms significativos que definen su propia cultura.  Por ejemplo, en el caso de la expansin del ingls, no slo se expande el idioma (la variable americana especialmente), sino la cultura tambin, es como una tendencia a la universalizacin o estandarizacin con la cual no estoy de acuerdo, ya que se van perdiendo muchos elementos de nuestra cultura que son los que nos hacen nicos.  Si te refers a un idioma para facilitar la comunicacin entre las personas de distintas partes del mundo, no escuch an que el idioma sea una barrera.

AA11108386	It's when you make a sexual connection to inanimate objects or materials that have sexual properties or that can be associated with something sexual.    for instance- leather is simply the processed skin of an animal, has a distinctive smell, and can be associated with the feel of skin.    Other things, like women's pumps, are only worn by women , and are therefore associated only with women and sexuality.

be3ed505647610d68128dce9055ba546aa	As far as picking between the three countries as to which are the most tolerant towards GLBT people. I wouldn't even put the US in the Top Ten, let alone the Top Three. I realize I'm breaking the rules slightly by making my own list, but it's better you get an educated opinion.    1) The Netherlands  ---They were the first to enact laws to protect GLBT people, including same-sex marriage, so they deserve the top spot.    2) Belgium  ---The second to legalize same-sex marriage, so the second on my list.    3) Canada  ---Though Spain just squeaked by us as far as making same-sex marraige legal, we legalized homosexuality in 1969.    4) Spain  ---Another European country that went down the raod of tolerance and legalized same-sex marriage.    5) The UK and South Africa  ---I declared the two countries a tie for two reasons. First of all, while the UK is quite tolerant of GLBT people, they declared Section 22 legal from 1989 to 2003 which prohibited the promotion of homosexuality as an acceptable lifestyle. They also wussed out on calling their civil partnerships same-sex marriage even though partnerships in the UK give exactly the same amount of priveledges as marriage. While South Africa was the first country in the continent that legalized same-sex marriage, it's only in major cities like Cape Town and Johannesburg that GLBT people are tolerated.|`|AA11279122	Canada we have the same rights as straights..we can marry, adopt..etc|`|a62cb6086e01a3d5c6009c0da596e23aaa	I cannot speak for the U.K. or Canada as I live in the States and am not gay.

My partner and I are thinking of moving there to be closer to her family (they live in the US)    UK is good too..You can have a Civil Partnership (which is exactly like marriage but with a different name). You can adopt kids and you get all the same benefits that heterosexual couples get. You could probably change your name legally by deed poll, and then get hitched using that name, although you would have to declare that you have changed your name when it comes time to get hitched.

You can only do so much on your part on communicating concerns on your relationship. If she is unwilling to communicate, then realize your relationship will not last. Try not to reveal insecurities or trust issues w/ dream stories or straight out asking her if she's cheating. Just get to the bottom line of it, since you could be wasting your time.

It takes getting to know someone's personality to really decide if you love them or not.

We are trying to make it work, but you have to be willing work hard. If you are OK with not having as much physical contact then go ahead, but if you haven't been around each other you should try it before actually committing to the relationship, spend time together.

I can suggest a few courses of action. 1) go to a strip bar, alone, with friends, with a guy, doesnt matter.  2) If you are dating a guy, bring up the idea of a 3some. All you have to do is say you heard most guys fantasize about having 2 women, you dont even have to admit interest until you see his reaction. 3) check out a swingers club in your area. They are usually very discrete and often will have days when singles, especially women, are allowed.  These things would give you an opportunity to get more experience and give you more to base your decision on, whether you want to be bi or not. One thing tho, being bi doesnt involve 'coming out' like being lesbian does. Dont worry about people judging you, its none of their business.  You just need to learn what YOU want, then go for it.|`|AA10611945	in order to be something you have to truly want to be that way, well in this situation its kind of different because in order to be bi you have to have some type of an attraction to females. I myself was confusesd about what i wanted to do with my life and weather or not i wanted to spend the rest of it with a girl or not so  you know what i did?  i took the chance at dating a girl to see if i liked it or not and i told her i wasnt sure about it and she went along with me and well its been 2 months and we are still together and well i am more happy then i could ever be so all i can say for is take a chance and see if its what you wnat if it turns out its not what you want then dont do it anymore.

Eu estudei ingls l durante 7 anos e achei timo.@|`|68788a7fbd176c9cbdb02d350017e61eaa	Meu filho tem 16 anos e comecei o ensino de lnguas com ele quando tinha 2 anos. Acho que esta  a idade ideal para o ensino de idiomas. As aulas devem ser individuais; s?o necessrias de 3 a 4 aulas de duas horas semanais, por idioma. O professor deve ser nativo (se a lngua for ingls, o professor deve ser americano, ingls, australiano, o canadense).  Existem muitos americanos rondando por a, de modo que n?o ser difcil encontra um disposto a ensinar seus filhos. No caso de meu filho, depois que ele j falava ingls como um americano (ou como um londrino, conforme a situa??o) diminu o nmero de aulas para duas por semana, mantendo o professor nativo. Tendo levado-o aos Estados Unidos comigo, onde permanecemos dois anos, ele sempre era colocado no Honors Roll do estado, o que mostra a excelncia do ingls que aprendeu.  Assim, recomendo o mtodo que utilizei sem restri??es. A propsito, pago 25 reais a aula.    Alm do ingls, recomendo que seus filhos aprendam latim e chins. No caso do chins, fiz a mesma coisa que com o ingls. Mas cuidado. Muitos chineses falam uma lngua diferente do putong-hua. Por isto, certifique-se de que o professor fala putong-hua como nativo. Chins  mais fcil do que ingls e, por isso, seus filhos podem ter menos aulas. Duas aulas de duas horas cada uma devem ser o bastante. O custo das aulas de chins  bem menor do que de ingls. Pago apenas 120 reais por ms. Quando estava nos Estados Unidos, pagava 8 dlares por aula de chins.  Gostaria que voc entendesse que a China vai ultrapassar os Estados Unidos em breve como potncia dominante. Ent?o n?o deve deixar de ensinar chins a seus filhos.  Mesmo hoje, mais gente oferece emprego a meu filho pelos seus conhecimentos de chins do que de ingls! Mesmo com 16 anos, ele poderia ganhar a vida trabalhando para importadores, comerciantes e tradutor de manuais tcnicos.    Latim  interessante porque ajuda no aprendizado do ingls. Alm disto, nos Estados Unidos, as boas escolas ensinam latim. Fa?a uma visita no site da Boston Latin School.     www.bls.org    Quando seus filhos estiverem falando ingls como um americano, recomendo que estudem um ano em escola americana. Em particular, recomendo a Boston Latin School.  Recomendo tambm um ano na academia do templo shaolin, na China, para aperfei?oar o putong-hua (mandarim). O custo de vida na China  extremamente barato;  mais barato manter seus filhos um ano no shaolin do que pagar uma boa escola no Brasil.  Eis o endere?o: http://www.shaolins.org/    Acredite, n?o  caro e eles v?o adorar. Aplausos por querer ensinar ingls a eles.

fed9fb03630f6846ae199bb4a164641caa	I think that "normal" is determined greatly by on'es culture/society. In "With Pleasure: Thoughts on the Nature of Human Sexuality," Paul R. Abramson and Steven D. Pinkerton write:     In contemporary Western culture, there are two [gender] choices: male and female. At one level, this two-category gender system makes perfect sense, corresponding as it does to normative assumptions about both genetic differences (XX vs. XY chromosomes) and genital differences (vagina vs. penis). Nevertheless, this sensible, and seemingly obvious, two-gender system is far from universally endorsed.     In both the Dominican Republic and Papua New Guinea, the cultural formation of gender includes a third category, a generic other, in addition to the biologically obvious categories of male and female. ... In cultures where the prevalence of pseudohermaphroditism is high, the three-gender system makes perfect sense. In other cultures, such as our own, genital ambiguities are either ignored, or resolved by assigning children with ambiguous genitals to either the male or female category (often with accompanying surgery). Such a choice is mandated by cultural assumptions that conceptualize gender as a strict dichotomy.     In India, hijras  males who have their penises and testicles surgically removed  constitute a third distinct gender category. ... Other examples... include the Native American bedarche... [men] who have been transformed into women by virtue of their dress and behavior; that is, they are culturally constituted females (although in some cases the transformation is from female to male). In Tahiti, members of the third gender are called mahu, and in Omani they are called xanith. The Burmese equivalent, the acault, are considered to be neither male nor female (despite biological maleness), with the social consequence that a man can have sex with an acault without violating the cultural prohibition on homosexual behavior.|`|AA10819547	It's normal for you.

3c90ab9bfffe34bff700221249b00257aa	I was celibate for a year or two in the early 1990s. It wasn't a conscious decision and certainly not an identity. I saw myself as very much gay, but the reality of AIDS amongst my friends and my patients made it hard for me to see sexuality as the free gift I might otherwise have been able to see it as. There was a lot of suffering, and this was one of the ways that helped me cope.    A distancing thing, I guess.    I got over this feeling, by the way, but I have some sympathy for people who do choose celibacy, and never assume that there ought to be fixed rules about how one should make sense of sexuality.      At the same time, a "too hard basket" should be honestly recognised for what it is, and not elevated into something to be aspired to.|`|AA11279122	yes|`|8c74e0188db5aa159357841d88083e61aa	Some I know wouldnt mind it others would say your a self loather. It all depends on the individual I spose|`|5f568984c834bb49358fc78371558d20aa	I'd assume so.  It's not like straight people frown on straight celibate folks.  Like in the straight community, I think we'd think it was weird, but not bad.  I'd accept anyone into the community, whether or not they practiced gay sex, because sexual orientation is about desire, not necessarily about acting on it.    But if the person was being celibate for religious purposes, I think some people would find it okay, but most would be critical of it.|`|AA10819547	There are those who would suspect a celibate gay's right to call him/herself gay.  Too many people still think it is the activity and not the rationale behind it that makes a person gay.|`|3ddf1a4e1d8899bcf4447cad5cec852eaa	Just about everyone in the LGBT community is celibate, or UNMARRIED, due to the discrimination that still exists in many states and countries.    Some LGBT people choose to remain CHASTE, or to abstain from sex.  As long as they have psychologically healthy and good self-esteem reasons for making this decision, they would be accepted 100%.    [Why do so many people confuse these two words?  Perhaps because just about every media source does, too  :o) ]|`|AA11334305	Are they celibate because they think gay sex is evil or are they celibate because of the reasons straight people become celibate? I don't mind celibacy, per se. That's a personal choice that I can respect, as long as the reasons aren't anti-gay.

The body gives off a certain sent that can only be picked up by the nose and a part of the brain called the olfactory bulb.  The scent that the body gives off is  pheremones.  You cannot smell pheremones but there are registered by the brain.  Females and Males both give off pheremones.  Especially when there is a period of arousal present.    You can also purchase pheremones organically over the internet and apply them to your body, that works even better.

Crossdressers simply enjoy dressing as the opposite gender, but are rooted in their own bodies.  Transsexuals believe they were born with the wrong gender, and are only truly rooted in their own bodies if/when they can have their bodies changed to the gender their head/heart believes they are.  Sexual orientation isn't completely tied to gender, so the question is impossible to answer in broad sweeping terms.

AA11452268	The difference between Sunni and Shiite Muslims is similar to the difference between Protestant and Catholic Christians. Although they don't hate each other per se, there have been periods of mutual strife, oppression, and even genocide between Sunni and Shiite Muslims, just as there have been periods of mutual strife, oppression, and genocide between Protestants and Catholics. Any time power or money is distributed unevenly between the two, there is a potential for resentment, anger, and violence.     What's going on in Iraq right now is basically the same thing that happened in France during the Saint Bartholomew Day's Massacre or any other massacre based on religious persecution. It's not so much that the Sunnis historically hate the Shiites, it's that the new constitution in Iraq threatened to give more power and money to the Shiites than to the Sunnis, and the Sunnis, being the group that formerly held that position, weren't terribly happy with it.

7d7f10be6570269f9a60e1c21de7795aaa	You don't have to be gay to cheat or find the same sex attractive. Bisexuality, unlike homosexuality, does not relate to a preference but the lack of one. Bisexuals have little or no gender preference, while gay people exclusively prefer the same sex. It isn't unusual, however, for bisexuals to lean one way or the other, which is why I said "little or no" gender preference.|`|AA10819547	Enjoy who you are with those who accept you.  The idea that bi-females are more accepted is down to the old male fantasy that it would be great to be involved in an MFF situation.|`|9dacefe0147298c503a128d1950f3628aa	First, the difference of being on the "Down Low" could mean one of two things,  either that you are cheating, like you have previously said, or it could mean that your not wanting everyone to know about your business. Who you sleep with is up to you and doesn't have to be anyone else's business what you do.  Being bi-sexual, is then being open and honest that you like both men and women, and to that it sounds like you already are.    Kudos to you for not cheating.  Bi-sexuals and even gay people get a bad rap because many of them do cheat.  It is nice that there are people out there that won't cheat no matter who they are with!
AA10819547	If you think that you're in the wrong body and that you should've been constructed as a man then you are trangender. If (as a man) you like men then you are a gay trangender.    It happens. I hope you can reconcile yourself and find a partner who understands and accepts you.|`|f14e7634a2f2cb52ab80310b78f8411caa	What you're expressing could be some kind of fantasy, or a hint that you may be transgendered. I'll define:    fantasy/fetish: An idea or image you have that you find attractive. Some people like to role play, others are attracted to certain objects or roles. Others like to become different people or take on different identities. These are only temporary, and generally don't mean that a person is unhappy with who they are "normally", in day-to-day life.    Transgender: When someone feels they are 'born into the wrong body', and feels more comfortable as a different sex/gender than the one they currently have.     It sounds like you're expressing that you want to be male, and that you're attracted to men AS a man. This could possibly make you a transgender gay male, but I'm going on very limited information. See if you can answer these questions - they aren't a "test", just a way to get you exploring questions about your identity in more depth:    Are you unhappy with the body you have now? If so, what would you like to change about it?    Is the ideal identity that you want different from the one you currently live now? If so, how?    Why do you wish you were a gay male, or transvestite? Is it because that seems to "fit" you better, or because you're attracted to the idea of these identites?    Do you wish you were a male because it makes something about your emotions and attractions easier for you? Ex - are you attracted to gay men? What about being a transvestite appeals to you?    If you wish you were a gay man, or a transvestite, because that's who you really feel you are on the inside, there's a good chance you could be transgender. I would recommend looking into a trans-friendly therapist who can help you sort out some of these issues - a gay man and a transvestite are very different things (one is a man sexually attracted to a man, and one is a man who likes wearing women's clothing. Most transvestites are heterosexual, not gay men).      Wishing you were a gay man or transvestite is no indication of your sexual orientation. It doesn't mean you're bisexual, gay, lesbian, or even straight. It has to do with your gender identity, and how you see yourself as male or female.   Your sexual orientation (who you're emotionally and physically attracted to) can be gay, lesbian, bisexual, straight, etc., and you can STILL be transgendered  (or not). The two are not connected, and can operate independantly from each other.     Your issue could have to do with your sexual orientation and not your gender identity, but I'd say to get a good, queer-friendly counsellor/therapist who can help you sort it all out. Ultimately these feelings can be different (maybe even scary), but it doesn't make you abnormal. Many other people are questioning themselves the way you are.       Good luck :D|`|5f568984c834bb49358fc78371558d20aa	If you wish you were a man, and you are attracted to men, then it's possible you are a gay transman, or gay female-to-male transsexual.  There are lots of them out there, but don't get too upset now; there are also many women who identify as "gay men in women's bodies" but aren't at all masculine, nor do they really wish to surgically or hormonally alter their bodies, although some do as well.  I myself know that if given the chance, I would absolutely choose to be a gay or bisexual male rather than a woman.  Gay male sex resonates more strongly for me than heterosexual sex.    But don't worry; it doesn't mean you're bisexual; only if you like women and men both sexually are you bisexual.    Hope that helps; you can go to ftmi.org if you'd like to know more about female-to-male transsexuals.

Es posible que en su forma original fuera ms una filosofa que una religin(por lo menos, si se sostiene que no puede haber religin donde no hay Dios), y un sistema de tica, un modo de vida, ms que una filosofa.   Est basado en las ense?anzas de Siddharta Gauthama Buda, que naci en el norte de la India el el siglo VI a.C.   A pesar de que en el transcurso de ms de dos mil quinientos a?os, han surgido muchas escuelas diferentes, todas ellas conservan las doctrinas de las Cuatro Verdades y del Nirvana.     La mayor parte de nuestros conocimientos sobre el Budismo primitivo( o cuando menos sobre el ms antiguo)se deriva de las escrituras en lengua Pali.   Comprenden los discursos de Buda y las reglas monsticas que dio a sus discpulos, conservadas orlamente durante siglos en la India, y finalmente redactadas en dialecto Pali, por los budistas del sur de la India y de Ceyln.   El canon Pali es dos veces mayor que la biblia.   Contiene tres pitakas o"canastas", cuyo conjunto ha recibido el nombre de Tipitaka(tripitaka, en snscrito).   Son el Vinaya, el Dhamma o Sutta, y el Abhidhamma.     El Vinaya pitaka o "canasta de la disciplina" se ocupa de la orden monstica, el Sangha, fundada por Buda.   Dentro de la orden se eliminan las diferencias de casta. Todos usan una tnica amarilla, todos estn tonsurados, viven con El Vinaya pitaka o "canasta de la disciplina" se ocupa de la orden monstica, el Sangha, fundada por Buda.   Dentro de la orden se eliminan las diferencias de casta. Todos usan una tnica amarilla, todos estn tonsurados, viven con mxima sencillez, y observan estrictamente la castidad y pobreza.   Las mujeres pueden entrar a la Orden.   Una de las secciones ms antiguas del Vinaya es el Patimokkha, las "palabras de descargo", que el monje ms viejo recita a sus hermanos, dos veces por mes(en el plenilunio y en el novilunio).   Consiste en una lista de 72 ofensas, empezando por los 4 pecados bsicos: asesinato, fornicacin, robo y orgullo de poser poderes sobrenaturales.-     El Dhamma. El Sutta pitaka o "canasta de los sermones" es la mxima autoridad en doctrina budista(dhamma)   Consiste en cinco colecciones(nikayas)de los sermones o discursos de Buda.-   Segn el Budismo, la esencia del ser est contenida en las Cuatro Nobles Verdades(satyani), descubiertas por Buda, bajo el rbol Bodhi.   Son la Verdad del Sufrimiento, o el hecho del dolor y la enfermedad. La verdad de que el dolor tiene una causa, sed, ansia o deseo, que lleva al renacimiento, y la verdad de que el dolor puede suprimirse   siguiendo el Noble Sendero ctuple.   Esta cuarta verdad es la base y regla del budismo prctico.   Estas son las reglas:   1-Ideas rectas.   2-Intencin recta.   3-Palabra recta.   4-Accin recta.   5-Vida recta.   6-Esfuerzo recto.   7-Meditacin recta.   8-Contemplacin recta.   El budista debe conocer, y esforzarse por practicar estas ocho verdades.     Si las sigue, no importa qu religin profesa, o si cree o no en el Buda.   La tolerancia del budismo no corresponde , como en otras religiones, a distintas pocas: el budismo siempre fue tolerante.   No ha recurrido nunca al fuego o al hierro, nunca ha pensado que la violencia fuera persuasiva. Un buen budista puede ser luterano, o metodista, o prebiterano, o calvinista, o sintosta, o evanglico, o taosta, o santero, o catlico, puede ser proslito del Islam o de la religin juda, con toda libertad.   En cambio, no le est permitido a un cristiano, a un judo, a un musulmn, ser budista.   De hecho, es necesario no una vida, sino muchas, para que el aspirante a la Iluminacin, se convierta en lo que el sistema hinayana llama un Arhat("digno"), y pueda entonces entrar en el Nirvana.   Estamos tejiendo y entrejiendo a cada momento nuestra vida. Cuando morimos, otro ser hereda lo que hicimos. Eso es el Karma, el hecho de que todo acto de nuestras vidas ha sido prefijado por una vida anterior.   Lo ideal es descubrir las verdades por s mismo y transmitirlas as a los dems.   El Nirvana no es lo que frecuentemente se dice que es, la no existencia o aniquilicacin, sino que todo es susceptible de un cambio hacia el equilibrio.   La doctrina hindusta del Ahimsa(no violencia)que es aceptada por muchos hindes y por los jainistas, tiene un definido espritu budista.     Las dos principales escuelas budistas son: la Ahinayana o theravada( que permanece en Ceyln)y la Mahayana, que florece en el Tbet, China y Japn.   En el Hinayana le discpulo aspira a convertirse en un Arhat o Buda individual(pratyekabuddha), es decir, alguien que conquista las verdades por si mismo y no predica.   En el Mahayana se es ms social, no slo hay que alcanzar el Nirvana para s mismo, sino esforzarse por llegar a ser un Buda y salvar, as, multitudes de sus compa?eros de miseria.   Una persona cuya meta es la budidada recibe el nombre de Bodhisattva ("ser destinado a la iluminacin")   El budismo cree en los nobles principios del Sendero ctuple, an predica el "no matars", el perdn de los enemigos, la importancia de la intencin moral, y el deber bendito de la tolerancia.   Tiene la honrosa distincin de ser la ms tolerante, en la teora y en la prctica, de todas las religiones   del mundo.|`|NEQqf60Iaa	cualquiera que este de acuerdo segun, tus valores, principio, creencias.|`|b2e27df05ce6755cbb0d5c5a33b9cc28aa	Para mi ninguna religion es la correcta, porque todas las religiones son manipuladoras en potencia y carecen de escrupulos.

Incluye un sistema de actitudes, creencias y prcticas religiosas; estas pudieran ser personales, o sustentadas por alguna organizacin. Por lo general la religin implica creencia en Dios o en varios dioses; o trata a humanos, objetos, deseos o fuerzas como objeto de adoracin. Gran parte de lo religioso se basa en el estudio que los seres humanos han hecho de la naturaleza; hay tambin religin revelada. Hay religin verdadera y religin falsa.    ?Por qu hay tantas religiones?    Clculos recientes revelan que hay 10 religiones principales y unas 10.000 sectas. De estas, en frica hay unas 6.000, en los Estados Unidos 1.200, y centenares en otros pases.    Muchos factores han contribuido al desarrollo de nuevos grupos religiosos. Hay quienes han dicho que todas las religiones con su diversidad representan diferentes maneras de presentar la verdad religiosa. Pero en vez de eso, una comparacin de sus ense?anzas y prcticas con la Biblia indica que la diversidad de religiones se debe a que la gente se ha hecho seguidora de hombres en vez de escuchar a Dios. Es digno de notar que, en gran parte, las ense?anzas que estas religiones tienen en comn, pero que difieren de la ense?anza bblica, tuvieron su origen en la antigua Babilonia. (Srvase ver las pginas 53, 54 en la seccin "Babilonia la Grande".)    ?Quin es el instigador de tal confusin religiosa? La Biblia identifica a Satans el Diablo como "el dios de este sistema de cosas" (2 Cor. 4:4). Nos advierte que "las cosas que las naciones sacrifican, a demonios las sacrifican, y no a Dios" (1 Cor. 10:20). ?Cun vitalmente importante es, entonces, que nos aseguremos de que realmente estamos adorando al Dios verdadero, el Creador del cielo y de la Tierra, y de que nuestra adoracin le agrade!    ?Son aceptables a Dios todas las religiones?    Jue. 10:6, 7: "Los hijos de Israel de nuevo procedieron a hacer lo que era malo a los ojos de Jehov, y empezaron a servir a los Baales y a las imgenes de Astoret y a los dioses de Siria y a los dioses de Sidn y a los dioses de Moab y a los dioses de los hijos de Amn y a los dioses de los filisteos. De modo que dejaron a Jehov y no le sirvieron. Ante esto se encendi la clera de Jehov contra Israel." (Si alguien adora cualquier otra cosa o a cualquier otra persona en vez de al Dios verdadero, el Creador del cielo y de la Tierra, es patente que la forma de adoracin de esa persona no le es acepta a Jehov.)    Mar. 7:6, 7: "l [Jess] les dijo [a los fariseos y escribas judos]: 'Aptamente profetiz Isaas acerca de ustedes, hipcritas, como est escrito: "Este pueblo me honra con los labios, pero su corazn est muy alejado de m. Es en vano que me siguen adorando, porque ense?an como doctrinas mandatos de hombres."'" (Sin importar a quin afirme adorar un grupo, si se apega a doctrinas de hombres ms bien que a la Palabra inspirada de Dios, su adoracin es en vano.)    Rom. 10:2, 3: "Les doy testimonio de que tienen celo por Dios; mas no conforme a conocimiento exacto; pues, a causa de ignorar la justicia de Dios pero de procurar establecer la suya propia, no se sujetaron a la justicia de Dios." (Puede que haya personas que tengan la Palabra escrita de Dios, pero que carezcan de conocimiento exacto de lo que esa Palabra contiene, porque no se les ha ense?ado correctamente. Quizs piensen que tienen mucho celo por Dios, pero tal vez no estn haciendo lo que l requiere. La adoracin de ellas no va a agradar a Dios, ?verdad?)    ?Es cierto que hay algo bueno en todas las religiones?      La mayor parte de las religiones ense?an que no se debe mentir ni robar, y as por el estilo. Pero ?basta con eso? ?Bebera usted gustosamente un vaso de agua envenenada solo porque alguien le asegurara que la mayor parte de lo que est bebiendo es agua?      2 Cor. 11:14, 15: "Satans mismo sigue transformndose en ngel de luz. No es, por lo tanto, gran cosa si sus ministros tambin siguen transformndose en ministros de justicia." (Aqu se nos advierte que no todo lo que se origina de Satans quizs parezca detestable. Entre los mtodos principales que ha usado para enga?ar a la humanidad han estado religiones falsas de toda clase, a algunas de las cuales l da la apariencia de justas.)      2 Tim. 3:2, 5: "Teniendo [los hombres mencionados en el versculo 2] una forma de devocin piadosa mas resultando falsos a su poder; y de stos aprtate." (Prescindiendo de las manifestaciones externas de que aman a Dios, si las personas con quienes uno adora no ponen en prctica sinceramente la Palabra de Dios en su propia vida, la Biblia insta a uno a cortar tal asociacin.)    ?Es correcto abandonar la religin de nuestros padres?    Si lo que nuestros padres nos han ense?ado procede en verdad de la Biblia, debemos apegarnos a ello. Hasta si llegamos a aprender que sus prcticas y creencias religiosas no estn en armona con la Palabra de Dios, nuestros padres merecen nuestro respeto. Pero ?qu hay si uno llegara a saber que cierto hbito que tuvieran los padres de uno fuera perjudicial a la salud y pudiera acortar la vida? ?Los imitara uno, y animara a sus hijos a hacer lo mismo, o comunicara respetuosamente a ellos lo que hubiera aprendido? De igual manera, el conocimiento de la verdad bblica impone a uno cierta responsabilidad. Si es posible, debemos compartir con los miembros de nuestra familia lo que hayamos aprendido. Tenemos que tomar una decisin: ?Amamos realmente a Dios? ?Queremos realmente obedecer al Hijo de Dios? El demostrar eso tal vez exija que abandonemos la religin de nuestros padres para abrazar la adoracin verdadera.

Let's talk about the personality/sexuality aspects first:  I read an interesting paper a while ago (sorry, can't remember where I found it. Think it was on Wired News, actually) where a sociologist expresses the opinion that not only gender identity and sexuality, but indeed our entire personality is becoming more and more maleable due to the influences of the digital revolution. Far from just being a medium for the exchange of ideas, she argues, modern man's interaction with technologies such as video games and the internet are allowing us to remake our personalities to fit specific situations, and that we are in essence all becoming multiple personalities. This isn't just about anonimity either, but more a fundamental shift in our relationship with ourselves. Gener, Sexual Orientation and every other aspect of ourselves becomes open to reprogramming as we move further and further away from the biological imperative that makes us straight, gay, transsexual or whatever. It's just an opinion, but interesting. If I find the article again I'll post a question about it.    From a purely biological POV, I just want to correct something another poster said on here about gender being down to x or y chromosomes. Unfortunately it's not that simple. While XX and XY are the most common, you also get people that 'suffer' from Turner Syndrome (X - no second X or Y), Klinefelter's Syndrome (XXY), and XYY syndrome. On top of that you've got various levels of androgen insensitivity to deal with, from us normal transsexuals, to fully androgen insensitive people who are born female, but are actually genetically male. They just never became male because their bodies don't react to the androgens released into the womb. It's not so easy to judge when you know the whole mess of a story...    Sexuality and gender are infinitely more complex than the surface shows. The sooner we all realise that, the happier we will all be. Pseudo-religious guilt-trips have oppressed us all for far too long.

Los libros sagrados tratan de explicarnos cmo es Dios, cmo nos ha amado y que Todos somos hermanos. Dios no tiene nombre ni religin porque nadie ha estado antes que El y porque no las necesita. El hombre es quien le ha puesto muchos nombres y hasta le ha puesto un sexo (Padre), pero acaso no se parece ms Dios a una madre que aun padre? Dios no tiene sexo.    Los libros sagrados no fueron editados por Dios o no fueron impresos en el mismo cielo, por tanto incluyen mucha basura que el hombre al tratar de traducir de lenguas muertas (de manera conciente o inconciente) desvirta sus conceptos originales, de tal manera que pretender regir nuestra vida en base a un libro sagrado no es correcto porque corremos el riesgo de caer en el fanatismo y hasta en matarnos a nosotros mismos o a otros creyendo que as agradamos a Dios cuando es todo lo contrario.    Yo nunca creer en una religin que :  1) Impida el desarrollo de las civilizaciones.  2) Agreda a las instituciones y poderes pblicos  3) Incite a guerras santas o promueva inquisiciones  4) Quite la libertad de pensamiento a las gentes  5) Amenace con infiernos, castigos y falsas culpas  6) Se adue?e de la voluntad de las personas  7) Haga infelices a sus seguidores  8) No sea tolerante con otras religiones  9) Diga que es la nica y verdadera y las dems falsas  10) Que ponga sus principios, sus credos, sus libros sagrados y sus sacerdotes o pastores o jeques o como se les llame por encima de DIOS.    Creo en Dios, en su Creacin, en la Naturaleza, en los seres vivos, en los seres humanos, creo en m, pero nunca creer en una religin que me haga infeliz, porque SOY FELIZ Y AMO A QUIEN NO CREE LO QUE YO MISMO CREO.     Quiz se den cuenta que uso dos respuestas en muchas de sus preguntas. Esto lo hago porque muchas de sus preguntas se originan debido a la confusin que causan los libros sagrados en todas las religiones.      El peor error que podemos seguir cometiendo es matar a Dios. A Dios lo matamos cuando en lugar de buscarlo en el Universo, en los seres que lo habitamos o incluso dentro de nosotros, nos vamos a la basura de papel que poco tienen ya de creble y de bueno. S que esto puede ofender a cualquiera pero simplemente AMO a DIOS y nos comunicamos a travs de nuestros ESPIRITUS; EL est en m y yo en EL, y todos estamos unidos en un slo ser pero no nos damos cuenta de ello.

Start to live your life from the inside out. In other words do not let your body dictate to you soul. It is suppose to be your heart that is a reflection of truth, that dictates to your mind,(SOUL) realm. When you do this thinking adjustment then you will beging to develop a Truthful attitude based on reality and not what your flesh wants. You body is your vehicle and I am sure you do not let your automobile tell you what to do? People that are operating, letting sex be their motivation, may be using it as tempory gratification. It is suppose to be something that you are in control of, not the opposite. I personally believe that you always have a choice, at least to do it or not to do it.I think we would all be like animals in the field if we just acted on every sexual impulse we had. Without operating from the spirit man inside we are like bull dozers without a driver. Our flesh will lead us into all kinds of temptations, if we let it. How about letting the spirit take control of your emotions, will, intellect, mind and character, instead of the World playing you soul like a fiddle?

qGVGhydtaa	Threesomes can be very damaging to a relationship or it can be a positive addition to a relationship.  My experience though has been one that was negative.  We each went into it with different expectations and desires from the encounter.  When it didn't live up to my expectations it put a huge strain on the original relationship.  The thing that each of you has to answer is what do you want out of this type of encounter.  Talk with your partner and find out how each of you look at it and what you want.  Bring up between you the possibility of it causing a rift in your relationship and how you will deal with that if it happens.  If you don't look for what the problems could be before you go into this sort of thing then trying to deal with the problems while in the midst of them will be far harder for you.|`|fcce460d22bccd7ff704e3cb9c7bd7b9aa	the only way to know how YOU will act is to do it|`|kOWcVD2maa	Depends on the relationship.

Your question opens some interesting thoughts.  If not a right, then a privilege, if not a privelege, a responsibility.  So which one?    Consider:  Marriage as a religious institution.  We've all heard this one.  OK, so if churches alone should be allowed to marry members of their congregation, why not allow gay churches (which are recognized by the state, like MCC) to marry their flock.    Marriage is a civil contract (civil marriage): The question then becomes, if not religious but civil, how is marriage harmed, coerced or in any way lessened if gays can take part, and if civil unions are acceptable, what is the litmus test that makes a union a marriage?    The truth is marriage is a right solely in words.  No one, not straight or gay has the implicity 'right' to marry.  Marriage, if nothing else, is a responsibilty and a spiritual choice that people make between themselves and their God.  The government has, over the years, allowed marriage to evolve from a religious ceremony between families to a legal status offering tax benefits and certain protections, both of person and property.   Is it a right?    One could argue the equality angle, and to a degree there would be some legitimacy in so much as Taxation, inheritance, hospital visitation and medical decisions etc. would be conferred upon gays, where now none exists.      If a privilege, then to what extent does that privilege lie.  Do gays have at least the expectation of opportunity.  That is to say, should gays be at least allowed to try for marriage, given that they can (contrary to popular belief) have children, can be in love and be responsible citizens.    Bottom line, it comes down to property and money.  Just as it did in the beginning, because as much as religious people wish to believe marriage is about love, it originally was about property, specifically how much someone could get for marrying into a wealthy family, the word for this property was Dowry.     So if marriage is not a right, but a privilege or even a religious construct, does it not then make sense to offer that privilege via religious institution, and if so, does not the MCC Church have the freedom to marry gays?    Ultimately 'rights' are a social construct that we, as people who form the society, from time to time alter, change, take back, or offer through democratic processes.   As a society evolves or devolves, so the rights go.|`|e9073bca0997150eb894cbd04ac22de2aa	The Christians say that marriage is a divine institution joining one man and one woman only, and that to allow same sex marriages destroys the sanctity of the marital institution. How can Christians say such things? As if marriage were still intact. They say Marriage is supposed to be between one man and one woman only. If this is a true statement to you, then you are a Bible believing Christian and you must also agree that sex is supposed to happen only between two married people. We all know that there are many Christians who have sex before marriage? The divorce rates among Christians are so high it is ridiculous. How many of us have heard of Christians participating in adultery, pastors addicted to pornography? The institution of marriage was desecrated long before the homosexuals asked for the privilege of marriage. It was desecrated by Christians. It isn't non-Christians preachers that must leave their churches due to extra-marital affairs. Its the Christians.|`|3a80002a6f76553b88bf99809efe65f2aa	The U.S. Supreme Court declared that marriage is indeed a protected "right" more than 100 years ago. This was affirmed 40 years ago when they declared laws banning interracial marriage unconstitutional. Three years ago the U.S. Supreme Court, in the Lawrence vs. Texas decision, they declared that laws banning or otherwise punishing homosexuality are unconstitutional. Short of a U.S. Constitutional amendment trashing our cherished concept of equal protection under the Law, I don't see how any law reserving Marriage for a select group could stand a true Constitutional test.|`|883bf8da09b4fa1e475662ce888f1940aa	marriage is the combining of two DIFFERENT things  two men CANNOT marry  neither can two women  it's an oxymoron|`|AA11491405	Marriage is a privledge, not a right.

People are gay, straight, bi etc.      People must have the same rights.    Simple...yet democratic.    NOTE:  There are laws regarding marriage.  Look them up.   Nothing is equal between gay people and straight people under these existing marriage laws.  Gays have the RIGHT be treated equally "by law".  The laws must change and they will.    NOTE: I repeat, the laws will change.  I can wait without further debate.|`|674e0ad95f862cc2fdd12dc536cb6c86aa	If anyone is given the right to marry, than under the laws of the U.S., then everyone should have 'equal treatment under the law.'    If the state can show 'compelling reason' to deny someone equal treatment, then they can restrict a right. To do this, the restriction must be Constitutional, that is, it must not contradict the U.S. Constitution or body of laws and legal precedents.    In the past, states have used the compelling reason argument to restrict gays from marriage, since until Laurence vs. Texas, gay sex could be illegal. But after Laurence, gay sex could no longer be illegal, so the states lost the compelling argument.    Now it is only a matter of time until the Supreme will rule that gays must be treated as EQUAL CITIZENS. That's why the religious extremists are trying to load the Court with conservative judges, to prevent this progress of Equal Civil Rights for gays.|`|AA10819547	Well if it weren't a right then there should be no restrictions placed upon it, would there? It doesn't help that it is enshrined in Law, meaning that there are rights associated with it and requirements to be met.|`|3ddf1a4e1d8899bcf4447cad5cec852eaa	The rights associated with marriage (inheritance, adoption, legal, over 1000 more) are given by the STATE.  Therefore it is called a "right," vs. a privilege or benefit.    If these rights are not given out equally, no matter what the gender of the marrieds are, it is blatant discrimination.|`|5f568984c834bb49358fc78371558d20aa	People have the right to marry because all that marriage is is a contract between two people.  At its least symbolic, marriage financially ties two individuals together, sharing their assets, forming a new entity to be seen for tax purposes, and extending other rights to them over one another.  It is this contract that allows couples to divorce if they so choose and have the law abritrate and settle their business of who gets what.  It is exactly the same as the contracts that corporations and businesses make and then, should they wish to dissolve it, or sue on the contracts' behalf, the courts will do so as well.  This is how our government works; our taxes go into the protection and acknowledgement of contracts that have been publically notarized.  Anyone has the right to make said contracts, and to be disallowed to do so is a violation of one's individual right.    I agree with you; most of the "rights" we have are not guaranteed in the Constitution, or if they are, they are extensions that I wouldn't see there.  I don't think that we have the right to education, the right to healthcare, the right to a secure pension, the right to a living wage (whatever happened to companies' rights to pay whatever they want, and people can choose to work there for that or not?), the right to never be offended, etc., etc..  Some rights we do have- privacy is one of them, however you define it, and so should be adoption, if all parties are willing (nobody should have the right to simply take children from those who don't want to give them, or to those who have been deemed unfit parents).    In my eyes, the difference between a right and a desire or want is huge.  Rights are secured by the Constitution and Bill of Rights; desires or wants are everything else that you can get your lawmaker to pass (like the "right" to healthcare, for example).    Hope that makes sense.|`|4893f5c31cf466d52405524c10faa2bcaa	I have asked many homosexuals why they think they should have the right to Marry.  BTW: THEY CAN MARRY SO THEY DO HAVE THAT RIGHT.    I have yet  to hear a answer that makes any sense, although I have heard many sincere answers. Most say if Hetersexuals can Marry than homosexuals should be able to.    They fail to realize this opens the door to any other alternative lifestyles Polygamy Incest, Beastiality, and it is pretty naive for homosexuals to think that many WHACKED people in the world which we have will want to define thier marraige.

4150877c5eb61a4f366fae61a9e52730aa	Him being 7 years older he should understand- from your description of him, that you're not interested in a romantic relationship just a friendship. He's basically opened the door in hopes that you could be more than just a friend should you choose. You shouldn't over-analyse this and just be open and honest with him about your feelings and not worry so much about hurting his. If he is truly a friend, he'll understand...and if he isn't, then perhaps you'd be better off. Don't alter your feelings just because you're afraid of hurting his...the relationship would be based on an unstable foundation and eventually fail. He probably is a real nice guy and may make a great partner...but if your heart isn't into it, then it would only become misery. Choose wisely.|`|AA11279122	Sit down and talk to him...or show him this question.|`|aa2979e672f17c771e3cf90504fe7826aa	Dude,  if he can accept you as a friend, cool.  If not, move on.      Don't have sex with him if you have no feelings for him.|`|jez6lGk8aa	You probably need to share with him that you value his friendship and you don't want that to end.  From your description, it seems like he was really hoping that the relationship could develop into something more serious, and perhaps that's what the whole purpose of the relationship was for him all along.    If you know that you will never have feelings for him, and if you also know that he will not be content to have a simple friendship with you without it developing into something more serious, then the relationship is doomed on any level, since it can be neither a romantic relationship nor a friendship.    However, if he is content with having a great friend, then there's no reason that can't work out.  That's clearly what you desire in this case, and by making it known to him that his friendship is important to you, maybe you can keep what you'd like to have.  If this works out, he won't be getting the lover he wanted, but at least he will have gained a friend.|`|e414d67399af60c5f47866da367287caaa	There obviously must be some sort of feelings there, deep down you are just unsure of them. Why else would you be so unsure & stutter every time.    The best thing to do, would to be friends & see where it goes from there. Don't over analyse things so much. Go with the flow follow your feelings. You never know this might be the greatest thing in your life.    Love is Life's greatest adventure.    But always be safe if you go the physical route.    Some advice: Always be you and never give up your morals.    Good luck.|`|AA10819547	You like him.  You don't love him.

AA10726551	I get so sick of some of you people using the argument that gays shouldnt be allowed to marry because they cannot reproduce.

I don't see the harm in two people who love each other and want to share a life together being granted the same rights as any other two people.

Oh because they're of the same sex.  What garbage!    That's what I think about that ridiculous argument that marriage is between a man and a woman only.  That's Church Dogma and is based on the Church's understanding of homosexuality from (however) many hundreds of years ago.      Marriage, however is a legal status and as such, by denying it to same sex couples, the State is denying a proportion of society the rights afforded the majority of society.|`|b70599a0829dd4deed571c9132f73590aa	I see we've already got some of the "it's wrong, immoral, they can't produce children" bigots posting already.  why is it wrong for 2 people to love each other?  if 2 consenting, unrelated adults love each other, it shouldn't matter what their gender, race, religion or culture is.   a committed, monogamous couple should be able to get married.   and FYI to those who claim we can't produce kids, yes....we can and DO!  I have many gay/lesbian friends who have biological children...and they are very happy, healthy and well-adjusted.    and to the ignorant who keep equating/comparing us to pedophiles and those into incest and bestiality....grow up!   it's not the same thing.  try getting an education and doing some research.  quit believing in lies, assumptions and generalizing stereotypes.  that only makes you look more foolish and even less intelligent.

A lover second. Being a bottom does not necessarily mean one is effeminate. I'm not the least bit effeminate. It merely indicates a sexual preference or what turns him on the most.

At it's base you must seek the and get in touch with the love that you have for your fellow mankind.

Tutto quello che sentiamo come emozione d'amore e' la riflessione di tutti i concetti che abbiamo circa cio' che ci fa felici.  Se cambiamo i nostri concetti di felicita', anche i nostri sentimenti di amore cambiano automaticamente.  Crescendo e maturando, cambiamo idee di cio' che ci fa felici.  Come valutiamo le cose e le persone a un'eta' cambia ad un'altra eta', e quello che pensiamo cambia automaticamente quello che amiamo.    La parola amore sta a rappresentare unemozione per qualcosa o qualcuno che e a noi attraente.  Il sentimento dellamore e una risposta automatica a cio a cui diamo valore. Il modo in cui il nostro intelletto funziona e che prima deve esistere una nostra idea e valutazione, poi segue automaticamente la risposta emotiva che noi chiamiamo amore.    A volte siamo confusi ed inconsci di come lamore cinveste, o perche amiamo qualcosa o qualcuno.  Sentiamo di amare e sentiamo di non aver controllo su cio che sentiamo.  Come tutte le emozioni, lamore forse piu delle altre, non puo essere comandato.  Non puoi dire a te stesso di amare una persona che non valuti altamente.  Lamore non puo essere ordinato come si fa con la pizza al ristorante.    Poiche amore e una parola astratta, tendiamo a separare lamore in desiderio per cose materiali e amore per cose spirituali.  Ma questo non e che un gioco mentale.  Loggetto dellamore cambia.  Potrebbe essere una bellissima automobile, una vacanza esotica, una persona, o Dio, ma il sentimento ha le stesse radici.      Ogni emozione che proviamo risponde ad una valutazione che facciamo consciamente o inconsciamente.  Quello che valutiamo altamente si fa sentire come desiderio di possedere, e cioe' di amare.  Il bambino da' valore a giocattoli.  Noi diamo valore ad altre cose che ci piacciono.  Siamo pronti a lavorare, a "fare sacrifici" per ottenere quello che valutiamo importante per la nostra felicita'.      Ma l'amore per una persona che non reciproca l'amore per noi (che non ci valuta come noi valutiamo quella persona) ci rende profondamente infelici, finche' capiamo che se l'amore e' irraggiungibile, a poco a poco sparira'.  Possiamo amare una persona solo se l'amore e' reciproco, perche' l'amore e' uno scambio di valori.  Non esiste amore illimitato e senza condizioni.  Come ogni scambio di valori fisici, anche quando amiamo qualcuno c'e' sempre un piacere che ne deriviamo noi stessi in cambio di quello che diamo agli altri, non ha importanza se lo scambio e' materiale o spirituale.      L'amore tra due persone puo' continuare soltanto se lo scambio e' giusto, bilanciato, o equo, allo stesso modo di come siamo pronti a pagare una cifra equa per un servizio o un oggetto.

v7g84mZ3aa	A fairy tale is a story featuring folkloric characters such as fairies, goblins, elves, trolls, giants, and talking animals, and usually enchantments. In cultures where demons and witches are perceived as real, fairy tales may merge into legendary narratives, where the context is perceived by teller and hearers as having historical actuality. However, unlike legends and epics they usually do not contain more than superficial references to religion and actual places, persons, and events; they take place once upon a time rather than in actual times.|`|2HmSwevHaa	They are folklore and stories that were passed down through the generations and gathered together in the 1800s by the brothers Grimm.

They grew up and some be came Doctors, Law makers (Sonny of Sonny and Cher)...but the biggest thing they became was "hippy-crits"  they were the culture of freedom and love and yet they were the first ones to vote against legalization of moderate drugs.  They're the ones voting against abortion.  The ex-hippies are sending kids to Iraq.  Oh yeah, and some of them living on the streets near Haight and Ashbury unable to give up the past.  Still want to live the path of the Hippy?    And by the way, the Hippy movement was a very minor part of the late 1960's culture.

4W4eUVguaa	Human beings just naturally sub-divide and categorize themselves. It's an inborn survival mechanism left intact from our past: i.e. since there's not enough resources to be split evenly amoung everyone, mankind must fight over these resources. In order to fight your fellow man with a clean conscious, you must de-humanize them. Hence the insulting labels. Derogatory terms always have some kind of loose affiliation to an actual meaning, such as the n-word referring to the country from which the slaves came, but the origin or meaning of the term is overall irrelevant. If a word becomes "taken back" by a subculture, that is it is made to be not derogatory anymore, another one will spring up to replace it overnight. The origin is usually picked on the spot and typically doesn't have real signifigance.|`|AA10819547	Out of the mouths of the parents of the babes who subsequently altered it to suit.|`|b2d2733c74578ff6a2dbeb5808c3b787aa	I don't know but I would like to know|`|AA11752666	Same place babies came from.|`|239054fe1c1d53036e2544551be569b3aa	for hispanics, i have been hearing racial slurs used more freely since this whole immigration debate kicked into high gear

If this were true, wouldn't his first edition be perfect as well.    The problem arises that the old testament was written for a lawless and uncivilized people.  Were you to follow any of the twisted morals put forth int he old testament, you would quickly be in jail the first time you caught someone working on the sabbath and stoned them to death.    I would suggest you follow neither.  While the stories may be entertaining, the directive of these books is manipulative, devicive, and evil.  Religion is one of the only things that can drive an otherwise good person to car bombings, murder, ethnic cleansing, and many other stomach turning atrocities.      Now I know you have been taught to think otherwise, imagine for a moment that people are naturally moral and ethical.  Now try to imagine that all the people killed in the names of their imaginary gods were still alive.  There is no way to know at what point our society and civilization would be without the needless murder, execution, and ignorant religious censorship of many creative and intelligent humans.      One more thing to add to my post, a question for you. It has been suggested that people learn their morals from the bible.  It has also been suggested that atheists are immoral by nature. The question i want to ask you is this: Why is it that people pick through the bible and its various testaments for the morals they like? What is it that helps you decide that stoning people on the Sabbath and Sacrificing your child to god is bad while "thou shalt not kill or steal" is right and just?      If you can answer this question I think you will understand that all humans are moral by nature independent of religion, the delusion of god, the threat of hell, and the scorn of their preacher.|`|FKCZKHPIaa	I see the Jews are claiming the Old Testament is only for them again, private club eh?

Jim|`|69755bf80032a14276b76226d108000daa	The Law (Old Testament) given at Sinai to Israel, which included the Ten Commandments, was made only with the nation of Israel and no one else! Gentiles (non-Jews) were not required to keep the Law unless they became converts to the Jewish faith.  Even if the Old Covenant had not been taken away in Christ, it would not be required of non-Jews.  It never was intended for them.    Jeremiah, who lived under the Law given at Sinai, said that this Law was temporary and that God was going to make a New Law with His people: "Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and  with the house of Judah - not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt (Jeremiah 31:31,32). The New Law would be different from the Old.  Jeremiah spoke these words 900 years after the Law was given at Mt. Sinai and 600 years before Christ gave the New Law. The writer of Hebrews in the New Testament quotes this passage from Jeremiah and applies it to Jesus Christ who is "also Mediator of a better covenant, which was established on better promises. For if that first covenant had been faultless, then no place would have been sought for a second" (Hebrews 8:6-13).        Jeremiah 31:31-34 also states some other differences between the Old Law and the New. The Old Law was written on tables of stone, but the New would be written on a believer's heart.  The Old Law did not provide for final forgiveness of sins, but the New did.  The Ten Commandments were part of that Old  Law.  They have not been required of people to keep since Jesus died on the cross 2000 years ago (Colossians 2:14).   Christ at that time gave a "better  covenant, which was established on better promises" (Hebrews 8:6).        What happened to the Old Testament (the Old Law, or Old Covenant)?  The New Testament tells us, "In that He says, 'A new covenant,' He has made the first obsolete. Now what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away" (Hebrews 8:13). "For on the one hand there is an annulling of the former commandment because of its weakness and unprofitableness, for the law made nothing perfect..."  (Hebrews 7:18,19). "Then He said, 'Behold, I have come to do Your will, 0 God.' He takes away the first that He may establish the second"  (Hebrews 10:9). "For the priesthood being changed, of necessity, there is also a change of the law" (Hebrews 7:12).  The apostle Paul wrote:  "Having wiped out the handwriting of requirements  (the Law of Moses)  that  was  against us, which was contrary to us, And He has taken it out of the way, having nailed it to the cross" (Colossians 2:14).  Paul also wrote concerning this Old Law which contained the Ten Commandments: "Therefore the law was our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith. But after faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor" (Galatians 3:24, 25).        When was the Old Law taken away and the New Law given?  It happened when Jesus shed His blood on the cross: "And for this reason He is the Mediator of the new covenant, by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions  under the first covenant, that those who  are called  may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.  For where there is a testament, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator. For a testament is in force after men are dead, since it has no power at all while the testator lives"   (Hebrews 9:15-17).        What  was the  purpose of the  Old Law which was given to Israel at Mount Sinai? Paul answers: What purpose then does the law serve? It was added because of transgressions, till the Seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was appointed through angels by the hands of a mediator" (Galatians 3:19).  The Seed is Christ (Galatians 3:16).  The Old Law, which contained the Ten Commandments, was given to keep Israel under control  until Christ came.  Since Christ has come and has fulfilled this Law, He has taken it out of the way.   He has given us a New Law (covenant or testament).  We must go to this New Law to learn how God wants us to serve Him today!|`|787aed0fbf246f2ca2f1ec59b6bdd29daa	You want to read and understand the entire Word of God, not just part. No one part of the Bible is more important than another;  you need the whole thing, old and new.  Why? Because if you were to choose the New Testament, you've just dumped the Prophets away, and God insists over and over in all of scripture that you read the Prophets writings..  If you were to choose the old, you would have to dump all of the teachings of Christ. Even Christ gave credentials to the prophets.  If a church ever tells a person to only focus on either the old or the new, or to leave out any Book of the Bible, that church has serious issues.  Jesus Christ was the Word of God, made  flesh.  look at John 1:1: In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God, and THE WORD WAS GOD.  As you can see, it did not say 'THE NEW TESTAMENT WORD WAS GOD FOR CHRISTIANS" or "THE OLD TESTAMENT WORD WAS GOD FOR JEWS".  It clearly says the Word was God, that means all of it.

0e3d3703405d946948260502a32b5b26aa	Ya te conteste, pero ahora para callar a todos estos que s emetieron ganar solo dos puntos, te dire un poco de la historia.  Kingston Jamaica 1957, aparecen en las calles un grupos de jovenes llamados Rude Boys.  Ellos eran jovenes obreros, algunos tambien haraganes que protestaban por la burguesia de la corona Inglesa.  Su vestimenta era lo que les alcanzaba para vestir. Pantalon ***** camisa, tirantes y zapatos, sacos casi no, imaginate el calor que hace alla.  Una de la formas de distraerse era sentarse afuera de las licorerias y esperar a que llegaran las camionetas que llegaban a promocionar ron o alguna otra bebida y llevaban un sound system, el cual tocaba los exitos de las Islas (inglaterra y jamaica) y exitos de la musica de estados unidos.  Se volvieron tan populares que comenzaron a salir sound systems independientes (como el Cox o el de Reids), un a?o mas tarde el ska y 1964 con la independencia, el auge del ska y la aparicon de muchos mas rude boys que iban a bailar a los dance halls.  Con la indepndencia muchos emigraron a Inglaterra para buscar una mejor forma de vida y se instalaban en ghettos. Llevando con ellos su ideologia, su historia y su musica en hombros.  Los jovenes ingleses comenzaron a simpatizar con los jamaiquinos y comenzo el intercambio cultural.  Reinventan el ska con el beat ingles y nace el 2 Tone (70's), llevando por bandera los cuadros blacos y ****** que representan la union de las razas. Adoptaron la vestimenta de los Rude boys de la primera generacion y a la daptaron a un estilo ganster de la epoca. Por eso usan los trajes, blanco ***** para reprsentar su ideologia. Pero no simplemente era una cuestion de razas, si no de sexo, de posicion economica, igualdad en general.    Espero te sirva.    Saludos y Suerte !!!|`|3WnEEVQBaa	Yo no lo se..supongo que sera una invencion sin masue tambien puede que se deba al contraste del ***** y el blanco, puesto que ellos son muy radicales...no se jejejeje.

aa2979e672f17c771e3cf90504fe7826aa	In the U.S :   I would believe also in Europe;          Empirical research shows that heterosexuals' attitudes toward gay men and lesbians are consistently correlated with various demographic, psychological, and social variables.   When thinking about these associations, it is important to remember two considerations. First, these associations describe general patterns in the population. Not all individuals fit those patterns.      With these considerations in mind, what characteristics tend to be associated with sexual prejudice?        Demographic Correlates    In contrast to heterosexuals with favorable attitudes toward gay people, those with negative attitudes are more likely to be:   men   older   less well-educated   residing in geographic areas where negative attitudes represent the norm (for example, rural areas or the Midwestern or Southern United States).|`|vtu0D50jaa	That has not been my experience, but hey, around here in redneck USA I am constantly amazed by people who come out to me and reveal that they never finished high school for one reason or another. And let me tell you, most of these people aren't homophobic at all. Oh sure, there is the occasional tough punk trying to show off for his buddies, but in reality most of these people would screw anything with two arms, two legs, and a pulse if they had the chance. Hell, I'm considered a genius just because I have two college degrees. Appalachia is alive and well.|`|3a72219446c9a5a85bf1448f6d4a2860aa	The stereotype would say Yes but that does not always hold true. You'd be surprised how many people that have been around enough to know better still hold that negative attitude, and conversely how many people who have fought and scraped for everything they have ever gotten understand what it is like to be told that you shouldn't do something simply because of what others will think.|`|730dd326e853a6c8595cc8db173220e7aa	Not necessarily. But sometimes, in order to keep the name of the family "honored", they don't allow their children to even get married to a "commoner" and don't allow them also to have homosexual relationships, so that they maintain their social status in the high-class society.|`|AA10819547	I think it is less to do with education and more to do with understanding (from which comes acceptance).      There did use to be a misconception that the upper classes (aristocrats) were all effete (foppish) homosexuals while those of lesser standing (both blue and white collar) were straight.  I could imagine that this would have enforced a negative attitude but rather I would have associated that attitude with persons adopting behaviours that crossed the holy cow of class structure rather than sexuality.      After all, there have always been plenty of "working class" gays.|`|AA11244754	no it is their upbringing, like there for a good while here in the south back in the 40's and 50's people hated african americans and there were a lot of racist hate crimes, also the KKK for example which preached white supremecy, men and women raised their children to hate and I think that has a little something to do with it in this case but I mainly think that they are sad, lonely people that are mad at the world and the gay population is the easiest target for their hatred because the person that they hate the most is:  THEMSELVES.    oh, bomb in the butt you just got reported by me: reason: insulting others and YOU fit the discription of the kind of people that I described to a T.   See ya, sure as h ll would NOT want to be ya!|`|8c74e0188db5aa159357841d88083e61aa	I do not think so. I know people from all walks of life that hate or like gays on about the same level. I really dont know why prejudice is still an issue but if you remember in the past the dislike for minorities ran from the highest levels of the social ladder to the lowest.|`|W0rGtW9naa	As rule, it would appear so, but that said, a generalized statement like that would require some study.   For myself personally, I have noticed somewhat of a correlation.  It just seems that less education or opportunity coupled with a lack of exposure to gay culture or people mixes to create a "perfect" storm if you will of homophobia.      I think more than anything, exposure to gays would be the best response.  Notice that as sports and more "masculine" gays from the world of entertainment come out, there seems to be a slight shift every now and then.      We still, however, have a long way to go.|`|eLG1HZbAaa	I think it has to do with exposure and tolerance. if you are exposed to certain things you see what that they should be socially accepted. I think education can really enlighten a person in a ton of ways, and no always changing the attitude of thinking homosexuality is bad or wrong. As far as social status, thats a really interesting question. I would think that if you are part of a lower social status and gay it would be  harder to come out and such because its much more of a risk. When getting married is a way of moving up in social status, and i'm not saying thats the only reason but i would also think it has something to do with lack of exposure and overall education. If   you dont go to school you are most likely around the same people attaining the same beliefs. Just a thought..|`|x2DImnPOaa	Guess who's back??   Before I report you for no good reason I'll answer your question.  I personally don't have a negative attitude towards gay people.  I have a negative attitude towards people who act like you do.  But, even if I did have a negative attitude towards gay people it would disprove your little theory anyways.  I have 2 degrees in Instrumentation and I am fixing to finish with my bacholers in Electrical Engineering.  I come from an ridiculously well off background as well.  So, there goes your theory.  I wouldn't talk about people being of lower class.  What do you do??  Wait!!!  I got it.  You work at the chevron over on main st???  HAHAHAHAH!!!!!

Iam sure it's been studied somewhere,and their conclusion was somewhere close to 98% of all bigot's,homophobes,anti semites,etc were of low economic and especially educational status.  Their are some however who regardless of degrees have either a low self esteem or they have had other problems perhaps mental ones who hate for hates sake.|`|e6e1e505b06999a4b35b2a5454c90983aa	no|`|5024a5da8cf19cef0ee1546564db3cb5aa	Not really but that would explain a whole lot of other things like there lack of expression!|`|0bb2a42057abc37708b55ad127011683aa	Yes. If you don't know enough about a subject, you are tempted to reject it. Most people who are against homosexuals become more accepting after being educated. Though, there are exceptions in religious leaders and annoying, idiotic politicians. -_^
AA10819547	When you consider how Mystics have been treated since those days - with a few notable exceptions (e.g. Nostradamus) - it's a wonder that the bible holds any sway at all in this day and age.

You'll find bisexual men who are more attracted to men, and those who are more attracted to women.    Overall, because we live in a heteronormative world where gay sex is still the sort of 'exotic' way of being, I think bisexual men hold the male side of the their bisexuality as being more potent, more arousing, and I know for a lot of bisexual men, they find the quality of gay male sex to be different, and more appealing because of that (it's rougher, more equal, allows a man to bottom if he feels he can't do so with a woman, has an anonymous, let's-get-down-to-business male sexual component), while they see women as sexually attractive but more relationship material.  I hear that one a lot.    But basically, it's individual.  I know bisexual men who feel both ways, and a good deal of bi men who would probably be better categorized as being gender-blind.    Hope that helps!|`|0RxANPAxaa	That actually varies a lot. I used to be more sexually attracted to women and emotionally attracted to men.

Leading separate lives might have woken them up.

As long as you live with them, it is disrespectful to fool around in their house regardless of whom you are fooling around with (guy or girl).  If you really want them to respect you and your relationship, you need to act like it.  Don't rub their noses in it.    If you are old enough, move out.  If you are still a kid, then you'll have to earn their respect, but you may never get their approval.|`|Kg0RS7CXaa	You need to ignore your parents, i do.

Good Luck!|`|f5b360475e7e93238b219ab9d8505da9aa	Okay, well them seeing you "messing around," as you put it is going to put a major roadblock on them accepting your sexuality.  So, you may just want to sit down and talk to them. What they saw will probably never fully erase from their minds, however you do have the opportunity to really talk with them now that your sexuality is in the open, if you catch my drift.     First of all, the worst thing you can do is yell at them. That will just ruin you relationship with them and they will cease to respect you, no matter what. You're at a very fragile point with your relationship with them and it isn't fair if you "attack" them, especially when you are the victim in this situation.     Visualize the problem. Okay so your parents don't like the fact that your gay. That's understandable.  Now, you need them to either accept you or ignore the issue, right? One way to do this may be to call up your local Youth Pride, and see if they have a person your parents could talk to about having a gay kid, etc. As corny or ridiculous as that may sound, first of all you don't know if it will work unless you try and, secondly, they may just need to better understand what you are going through. They are your parents after all and more than likely they care about you more than you know.      If that doesn't work, or they simply won't do it, you may just want to sit down and talk to them yourself. Ask them why they are against or not supportive of your sexuality and try to clear up any doubts or questions that they might have.  Help them to understand that you aren't going to come up with a boyfriend next Friday night and that they are going to have to live with that reality.      Next, you may want to bring your girlfriend over for dinner, or simply do something with your family and your girlfriend. Don't shove her in their faces by kissing her at the dinner table or something, just make her appear normal like any other friend, etc., that you may bring home.  This will help them learn to see past her sexuality, and yours, and accept both of you together.    Also, put what happened in the past and keep it there. Expect your parents to do the same in an effort to keep the peace and help everyone move forward.    Good luck!|`|MVgixKl9aa	maybe try to be as discreet as possible and give them time to come to terms with it, dont flaunt it in their faces

And the only way for one well to not find out about the other well is to well... lie.    Women are evolutionarily programmed to protect what they have a stable relationship, a stable family.    If these two things did not happen, primitive men would stick around with women long after they have grown old and infertile, or just stopped having sex with them and humanity would have risked dieing out. And primitive women would have abandoned their children in caves to get eaten by wild animals, and humanity would have died out.|`|AA10819547	This may sound rude, so please forgive any offense - none is intended.

Not all men choose to go out and live a wild lifestyle and not all men are pigs.

If you want loyaty and trust.....get a puppy.|`|FehGwS5Daa	Most guys ARE pigs. Glad you can see that.  I think some guys just lie because they figure they won't get anywhere by being honest about what they really want.  You can meet a guy who is not some pig, but it's a needle in a haystack.  There are a zillion toads, and only a few princes.  All women may not be honest, but I think it is fair to say that the guys are overall more likely to cheat, play games and be abusive in a relationship compared to women. The reason is that men's bodies have more testosterone than women's which puts sex on their brains a bit more than women. Plus, men's minds and emotions work differently than women's. This is why men and women typically don't understand each other, and many guys choose to be dishonest about what they truly want or how they feel about you.  It is easier for them to lie - even if it's at your expense. You have to be choosy about men and take your time getting to know them before getting too involved.....That's my opinion.

Un cientfico, un filsofo y un avicultor resuelven el dilema  Agencias. 26.05.2006 - 09:54h   El huevo, anterior a la gallina segn 'The Times'. (Sierra de Baza) ?Qu fue antes: el huevo o la gallina?   Un cientfico, un filsofo y un avicultor creen haber resuelto, por fin, esta vieja y popular adivinanza de la humanidad.     La respuesta inequvoca dada por los dos pensadores y el granjero es que fue antes el huevo, segn inform el viernes el diario britnico The Times.     En resumen, ste es su argumento: el material gentico no se transforma durante la vida del animal, por lo que la primera ave que en el transcurso de la evolucin se convirti en lo que hoy llamamos una gallina existi primero como embrin en el interior de un huevo.     Pregallina, huevo y gallina    La primera cosa viva que podemos calificar como gallina  sin temor a equvocos es el primer huevo  El profesor John Brookfield, especialista de gentica de la evolucin de la Universidad de Nottingham (Inglaterra), a quien se plante la adivinanza, dijo que la cosa estaba para l absolutamente clara.   El organismo vivo en el interior del huevo tena el mismo DNA que el animal en el que luego se convertira, por lo que "la primera cosa viva que podemos calificar sin temor a equvocos miembro de esa especie es el primer huevo".     Diferente aspecto    Por su parte, David Papineau, un especialista en filosofa de la ciencia del King's College londinense, coincidi con su colega: el primer pollo sali de un huevo, y es un error pensar que el primer huevo de gallina fue un mutante producido por padres de otra especie.     Si un canguro pusiese un huevo, y de l saliese un avestruz, el huevo sera de avestruz y no de canguro  "Es un huevo de gallina si en su interior lleva un pollo", dijo Papineau, quien agreg en plan hipottico: "Si un canguro pusiese un huevo, y de l saliese un avestruz, el huevo sera de avestruz y no de canguro".   El peridico cita a Charles Bourns, granjero y presidente de un organismo del sector avcola, quien quiso contribuir tambin al debate: "Los huevos existan ya antes de que naciera el primer polluelo (...), claro que tal vez no tuviesen el aspecto de los de hoy".|`|57175ff486a7395ef26aa33d0d30d3b2aa	la gallina desciende de una animal prehistorico llamado gallinatus erectus. su forma era de cabeza rojiza con un solo ojo y en una parte de su cuerpo( los investigadores todavia no se puesieron de acuerdo) tenia dos huevos incorporados. cuando estos especimenes se extinguieron solo quedaron los huevos que con el calentamiento global maduraron y nacieron las conocidad gallinas. por eso cuando un nene comienza a descubirse sexualmente ly se esta tocando contantemente las entrepiernas la madre siempre le dice "dejate la gallina en paz"|`|0422364e3b3f0790beea4f989d7b87d3aa	la gallina cana y de donde vino la gallina facil del otro lado de la calle    niegamelo.|`|d973c5fb3b1336fe20c725c40e078561aa	El huevo, no hay duda que resolver.

Think how miserable you would be if you didn't enjoy it but it really rocked her world and she began to obsess over it night and day.  There are other men and women who enjoy this as well the only thing mildly unique about your situation is that you found each other first and then discovered that you share this interest.

On the one hand, high school students who dress in a certain manner and listen to a certain kind of music are choosing their own label. Being an emo, skaterpunk, goth, jock, or geek gives you the right to hang out and be friends with other emos, skaterpunks, goths, jocks, and geeks. It tells you you're not alone.    The downside, of course, is that some high school students will use these labels in reverse, not to forge a common identity but to insult or ridicule others.    The good news is that as people grow older and more confidant, it becomes less necessary for them to use these labels. I'm sure it's annoying to deal with the labels, but this too shall pass!

Too much rude behavior is taken for granted, from what I see.  Keep rebelling!      To answer your question, I don't think I've ever brought my cell phone *into* the theater.  I somehow manage to live without that little life-support box attached to my ear, unlike so many people under the age of 25 or so.  It's only for emergencies, for me.  If I did take it into a theater, yes, I'd have the decency to set it on 'vibrate' AND would get up and leave if I got a call.      I feel almost as strongly about them in restaurants, grocery stores, parks, hiking trails, museums and other public places.  I'm *livid* if I go to a library and someone is ruining my enjoyment or solitude, or distracting my studying by yakking on their phone.      I've complained to the management in several places.  I informed one restaurant manager that I would stop my weekly patronage, and got a nice, understanding call from the district manager.  It helped me to blow off steam about one incredibly obnoxious Nextel user (the worst!) who treated the surrounding tables to twenty minutes of both sides of his Neanderthal conversation, along with the beeps.  Oh, if violence were legal...    Let business owners know you won't tolerate this in their establishment!  Money talks.  If they want to serve decent people and keep a decent atmosphere, it should be they who deal with these cell phone *******, not you and I.|`|AA10097240	I do!!  I put mine on vibrate so i know if somebody needs anything, i can GET UP AND LEAVE THE THEATER, instead of talking right in the middle of the movie and laughing and telling your whole life story!!  That annoys the crap out of me!!  so all of you reading this, TURN OFF YOUR FREAKING CELL PHONES!! it's not complicated!!|`|AA10118367	Haha, I turn it off. I hate when people leave it on and then someone calls and they start talking during the movie. So annoying.

lqYLc0tXaa	Some relationships come really easily to us, which is when we realize we were better off friends, and the toughest turn out to be the best.    I'm not sure what you and your boyfriend did to hurt each other, but what I do know is that trust and honesty go a long way. If you and your boyfriend are willing to sit there and talk it out without anyone getting offended or hurt, you two will see that your honesty and attention to each others feelings is worth it.    My girlfriend and I have had our moments. Most fresh relationships have theirs. She was deployed to Iraq for a long year and in that year we both lost hold of each other. We both made our mistakes and when she got back, it was up to us to try this relationship again. You have to ask yourself first if your relationship is worth it.    If you answered yes, then go forth and work things out. Don't take no for an answer. You love your boyfriend so much, and you know he's worth it!! I know that some men don't really like much talking. So I always seem to face a challenge to offer advice to men, knowing this.    Try to find out what it is bothering him without directly asking him. Maybe he feels a little left out? Maybe he's jealous of someone in your life?    In every relationship, we all need to feel  1. In a relationship where one has cheated, a person needs to feel completely reassured that it won't happen again.    I don't know if that was the case between you two, but whether it was or not, reassure your boyfriend that you love him and that he is your  1.    Don't let either one of yourselves take the blame for the arguement or misunderstanding. I used to do that all the time and I've grown out of it. Make some time for yourself and re-evaluate your arguements. Try to find the root of the problem. There might be another reason as to why "that laundry is bothering you."    Once you realize the root, try and fix that. Talk to your boyfriend and don't let things get out of control. He cares about you as much as you do for him.    Good luck!|`|b3c93c41349a4d0379b1857c81717693aa	I guess the key is what happened after the first 6 months - Something must have triggered the change and it must not have been addressed at the time adequately.  If you can address the original issue without causing some new wounds, then do so.  The only other alternative is to put the past in the past and both of you resolve to start over, key word being both.  In order for the relationship to work, you will both ahve to work at it.  Good luck - the best relationships are those that stand the test of time by working thru issues.|`|AA10819547	Such is real life; the Honeymoon is over and you're having to work at it now.      If everything you each try to do just winds the other up, then perhaps this week's reflection will prove to you (both) that you are not ready for each other - even if you are right for each other.    I suspect that it is time to move on.  Love is also about letting go for the better.    Good Luck.|`|acbffb6d2f86b4463aa059846614090daa	Move on,i know it's easy to say than done but what can you do? keep on thinking and blaming one another,it won't work,just let go and maybe things will catch up sooner.

And the answer is, at the moment, 70%+ yes.    So I'm not 100% sure... but I'm only 19. Eventually I'll completely figure it out and be comfortable with my feelings. Right now, I can't/ am a bit unsure.|`|AA10819547	Gender is not so much of a preoccupation when you're looking for a date and/or a relationship|`|AA11049151	which do you really and truely want to be with, women or men  the most?|`|AA11752666	Well I'm bisexual. First off. haha. Anyways you know because you see the good in everyone no matter what the sex. You feel attracted to the person more than the gender. It means that your sexual pref has no boundaries but it also means that you can have a monogamous relationship. The typical stereotype of bisexuals is that they sleep with multiple partners at the same time and with both sexes and spread disease and before you know it the whole world is infected and that's the end of man. This is not true. We are people too. Sure there is bisexuals that date multiple partners. But there is also gay, lesbian and straight people who do the same. Everyones different.    You may just be curious too. Ya know?

They will become involved with the subject of those elements.     Because of Adam and Eve's disobedience, we are all born sinners. All of us can be homosexuals, murders, fornicators, thieves, adulterers or liars. Maybe even more than one of those. We all sin which is the reason that we all are born separated from God and do the things that He has told us not to do..    Jesus came to the earth for the purpose of becoming the blood sacrifice for the forgiveness of our sins. Those of us who will choose Him as our Lord and Savior and repent (which means to turn away from sin), will be given the free gift of eternal life with God.     God doesn't want anyone to be lost. That is why even though we are born sinners, He has provided Jesus for us. Not choosing Jesus is the only way that we remain separated from God.     Coming to Jesus for love, leadership and forgiveness is the way to go to Heaven and loose our willingness to mess up our lives. The only way.|`|AA11376888	If it's a matter of satisfaction, there's no end to it. Regarding your fantasies, you need to find yourself a woman soon.

No room for ambiguity or interpretation there.|`|ac3b61d1ec0e0bb15564d23df2609274aa	How about this:  The onset of puberty is characterized by wet dreams - erotic dreams so sexually stimulating the dreamer has 'nocturnal emmissions'. These dreams obviously feature sexual situations which are stimulating to the dreamer, or else the nocturnal emmission would not be possible.  When I started going through puberty, my dreams were always about men. Since I do not control my dreams, I did not conciously choose to dream about, or find men sexually attractive. Therefore, homosexuality is not a choice for me.|`|287676ba8794faf30c93bf7fd6ba9c0faa	That's the trouble with "facts" they can be twisted to conform to your own agenda.      You are going about this in the wrong way.  Ask yourself this question: Is it a fact that you chose to be straight?

Everyone must make choices in life.  Once a person makes a choice and receives pleasure from it, the are predisposed to return to it.  Returning to the activity reinforces the action, making it hard to quit.  Its like smoking.  You smoke a cigarette and get a rush.  You want the rush again so you smoke another cigarette, and eventually get into a pattern that you cannot get out of.    I believe it is all in the child-bearing to be honest, but have no support to back it up.  I just find it odd that those places who openly accept gay culture tend to have more gays.  I was raised in the conservative South were homosexuality was shunned upon.  Likewise, growing up there were only 3 gays I ever even encountered coming up through school.  It seems to me that those parents with more liberal values and live in more liberal areas will accept such actions in their children, and the culture is reinforced in that area.|`|EpK9wvf3aa	Why do you feel the need to justify whether or not homosexuality is a choice. You are not, hence you say you want proof. Just ask a gay man or woman. Most gay men will tell you that they have always been that way. and will always be that way. I was born that way and I will die that way. I don't need anybody to try to convince me otherwise. I know who and what I am. I don't feel the need to defend myself from those that think differently than me.|`|5f568984c834bb49358fc78371558d20aa	I would think the sheer staggering amount of gay and lesbian people who never made any choice or decision regarding their sexuality would be evidence enough.    Given, that doesn't necessarily prove that homosexuality is genetic or innate, but it certainly, I think, sheds some doubt on the whole "choice" idea.|`|3a72219446c9a5a85bf1448f6d4a2860aa	Hmmm, theories aren't "concrete" yet there is absolutely no evidence that points to homosexuality being a choice.......

Much research is still required, to positively identify and assess the impacts of a "gay gene" or to confirm the effects of antenatal hormone levels in the expectant mother.    Empirically though, the vast majority of non-heterosexual people (come to) recognise this as their normal and natural state of being and many of these at an early age.    There is no consistency in upbringing of non-heterosexuals to suggest that absenteeism of one parent, over-born mothering, sexual trauma, etc.  (Nurture over Nature) is responsible.    Conversely, there is no suggestion that heterosexuality is a choice and, unfortunately, less well-informed heterosexuals consider non-heterosexuality to be a deviation from the norm; rather than a small - yet fundamental - part of the natural order.|`|zY0fZHJ5aa	There are no facts that point in that direction. as a matter of fact several twin studies found that one twin was gay and the other straight  indicating that it is a choice rather than a genetic factor.|`|zPIdf0HSaa	Homosexuality is not a choice.|`|abbe38a0e24f475ff116f31d99952054aa	Try from wikipedia.

Now, if I am supposed accept that straight people are straight because they say so, since there is no factual evidence to prove being heterosexual is not a choice, could you do me the favour of granting me the same right of statement.    I am Gay, I have always been Gay, I will always be Gay.  I know this and thus it is fact.   For you to dispute it would be dishonest.|`|abac04d6ae3e30286e631b2ce2640de7aa	thats because there is no one true awnser for that, for some its a choice, for others it isnt. i've had my heart rended in two listening to children who pray to god asking them for forgiveness and asking him to make them "not gay".    i from my own experience found that i had no inhibitions to either sex, but after my experiences with both, i've settled on a male partner because i find a male form far more comforting to cuddle up to, not that i am a "feminine" person in anyway.    you'll find there is no evidence as there isn't any, it can be a mixture of both causes which results in it, just as peopel can't conclusivley prove that living with gay parents is more or less likely to make you gay yourself.
13f8ff9adfc1b6c03d5fb6cdc734ca07aa	Sometimes when you change the dynamics of your situation, it becomes a little awkward for those around you to deal. It sucks big time, but its a fact. I went through the same thing at the beginning of my relationship with my current girlfriend. A certain group of my friends who were use to me bein their  1 party girl, down for anything at anytime, now had to accept the fact that i was in a monagamous, serious relationship and that a large part of my singlelife was being put on a shelf. And they didnt like it at all. They werent jealous. They just missed the old times when i could run the steets at all times of nite. But i knew to maintain my relationship.....i cant do that. I explained to them that i dont love them any less & im still the same fun person, but i have to prioritize my life. And that im still there for them & still wanna have go out and do things from time to time.

In your case, maybe your single friends feel pressure to find someone and start their lives together...and you have already started this, so they may feel jealous because you have something they secretly want. Its probably raising alot of insecurities and questions in their own heads. You should talk to them about this if your friendship is important and if not, forget about them because then their obviously not good friends.

Ya that really sucks. Ummm, talk to his parents and other people of authority (psychological doctors etc.). If the bully spread a rumor, why can't you? If it's really as bad as you say, then you should be able to spread a rumor without getting caught, and believe me, if you tell the truth everyone will think that the truth is a rumor. But the smart thing to do would be to forget it, the rumor will eventually go away, people forget. About the girl, she sounds like a s.lut, so forget her, If she really truly liked your friend then she wouldn't have ditched him. Know where your friend is at all times, so he doesn't run away or commit suicide. Give him a lot of support and try to find the good side of things for him to look at. Most of all, I'm sure there are people out there who don't quite completely believe the rumor, find them, and try to be friends. Try to get your friend on the normal life track again, go the movies, or get him to go to a concert, and you never know where you may find friends. And the most important thing you could do is NEVER, EVER be friends with that bully kid.|`|LDbcOBsNaa	You're STILL right from when you asked this question before. You do need help.

His eyes are a flame of fire, and on His head are many diadems; and He has a name written on Him which no one knows except Himself. He is clothed with a robe dipped in blood, and His name is called The Word of God.  And the armies which are in heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and clean, were following Him on white horses. From His mouth comes a sharp sword, so that with it He may strike down the nations, and He will rule them with a rod of iron; and He treads the wine press of the fierce wrath of God, the Almighty.

Such people also go into great detail about what they have seen, and their unspiritual minds puff them up with idle notions.    I really don't think it's the eye's sense of beauty and aesthetic that is the ultimate goal. It's simply the means here to get at the "best" messengers so as to have the closest thing to satisfying rituals. The word worship here in Greek is not the one that means kissing the hand. It's the one that means rites or rituals. Angel means messenger. I don't know what the connection between that and the eyes is. It's possibly showing that one is willing to let others into the "showy display of one's means of life" or at least a description of it. (1 John 2:16)    Meanwhile, you don't happen to have any advice for how to convince my straight boyfriend/husband (we exchanged vows privately) that he acts like he's gay, do you?    He keeps on wanting to describe his entertainment choices to me that he's able to afford now that he's been working for the last couple of years. I'm sure it's the idea of some friend he's made at work. He swears it's not his boss because he's too old.

There is even a wonderful local Spanish newspaper!     I come from South Florida originally when I heard Spanish everywhere, but there are only pockets within Asheville; Especially W. Asheville where there are many  local Hispanic businesses and resources.     The local community is by and large appreciates the Latinos and understands the major role they plan in our community. Of course there are some ignorance, but even farther out in the mountains you find by and large acceptance.    Please come to Asheville and volunteer with the community here.  Hopes that helps!

I would hope you know if you consider yourself a christian.    Whenever some one asks me or I myself wonder the answer to a question about religion I go to the Bible.  I hold the Bible, as all Christan's should, in very high regard.      When I want to know what God wants me to know about a topic I know to find it in the Bible.  Many on this forum answer using their opinion or just using wikipedia or some other online source.  This only tells mankind's opinion that is not what I want or what the "Asker" says they want.    If you are a Christian you should strive to know the Bible because to quote the old saying it's out "Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth"    The bible itself commands us to.  2 Timothy 2:15 (King James Version)  "Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needed not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth"    I am not sure what your point is.

RermzbWgaa	I believe good and evil are defined by God in Scripture, although I would also say we all hold within us some natural understanding of what that is (not to say we hold to it, nor that we cant be taught to ignore it).  Good and evil to societies (as far as political and economic perspective) are not truly good and evil.  They are preferences.  It is true, obviously, that those preferences can be truly good or evil (by my standard) but they depend on the standards mentioned above and not public opinion.    I believe I get my moral system from Scripture and that from God Himself.  My political and economic preferences are simply my preferences, and are not necessarily superior to anothers in a moral sense (but may be superior in other manners, just as theirs may be to mine).    (Don't anyone misread the above to think I am claiming success in following the moral code of God...just that I subscribe to it.)|`|64fe708fc53c52786e4ff17be3e35268aa	ur ryt .. and just because somthing benefits one person or group doesnt make it good by labeling it good to themselves .. its not for men to decide what is good ... what is truley good is evident and thats why i trust Jesus ..|`|4pXGXI5Uaa	No, I do not believe in evil.     Yes, morality is defined by society, and on a sub scale by a person's upbringing. Many socieies past and present have viewed things such as murder, rape, assault, as perfectly normal daily activities of life. A person growing up in such an environment would not know a different. This is the case today with children being indoctrinated to radical Islam. Do I think these people are evil? No, if we were born into the same brainwashing environment we would be doing the same things.    Though even in a society with a solid moral code, the most important part of a person's outlook on life is who controls their daily life. Most criminals in the criminal justice system were raised in horrible, often abusive conditions. Again, when raised with absolutely no role models in such conditions, most would be making the same decisions.|`|AA10785324	i believe that both good and evil exists.    love is a good that exists.

Walt isn't alive anymore.  I just never really understood that corporate culture and I have worked for many other companies since then.    as far as the sex stuff, even if it's mild innuendo, it sells.

Beauty and the Beast is one of  my favorite movies of all time, and was actually requested to be made by Walt before he died. So I consider it one of his.

It neither explains how the world was created, nor is it a science. This bogus science merely takes a phenomenal mystery that is our world, and how it came to be, and provides an explanation that is more confounding than the mystery the answer purports to solve.    To say that God did it, would not fly in any history class to explain the root causes behind WWII. To say God did it, would not pass the mustered in any math class as answer to an equation. To say God did it, doesnt suffice as an answer to why a particular cultural practice exists in any anthropology or sociology class. So why, if such an answer can be easily dismissed in every other major discipline, should we entertain it as a viable theory in science?     The answer is we shouldnt. We are often taught that tolerance is the hallmark of virtue and civility. I think in the realm scientific inquiry we should make an exemption and be virulently intolerant of this faith based nonsense masquerading around as science.|`|AA12346961	Entertainment piece for harried college students -- just like pastafarianism.

En todo caso, tal vez gana la oportunidad de expresar despercudidamente sus convicciones sin la estigmatizacin con que normalmente se reciben estas opiniones en nuestras sociedades mayoritariamente religiosas.    En mi caso, yo casi nunca soy quien inicia una discusin sobre la existencia de Dios. Casi siempre es un creyente que me enfrenta. Las pocas veces que la inicio yo son porque estoy molesto con algo que me ha ocurrido y me ha enfrentado a los creyentes. Por ejemplo, en el colegio de mi hija (que no es religioso) muchos padres de familia han presionado para que haya un curso de religin donde, evidentemente, el nico tema es leer la Biblia. Y lo consiguieron! Yo lo considero una tremenda falta de respeto. Cmo es posible que en un colegio no religioso obliguen a mi hija a leer la Biblia. Yo no soy creyente, podra ser judo o musulmn!    En la vida cotidiana... alguna vez un ateo ha tocado a tu puerta a decirte que Dios no existe? Alguna vez has visto un canal de TV con programacin permanente anti religiosa? alguna vez has visto gente que se dedica a tiempo completo y con salario a predicar que Dios no existe? o has visto a los ateos crear organizaciones jerrquicas excluyentes y montar oficinas en cuanto pueblo existe? o colegios exclusivamente para ateos?... tal vez habra que preguntarse qu ganan todas estas personas.|`|LPLR81t5aa	Pues si demuestro que Dios no existe, (cosa que creo que es imposible, tanto demostrar su existencia como su inexistencia) demostara que mi opinion era la acertada.

Que esta pregunta no la tendras que hacer porque estoy seguro que t sabes que no hay nada de bueno en promover mitos en la sociedad ?Acaso hay algo bueno en que se promuevan mitos como si fueran verdades? Que el asunto entre cristianos y ateos es que no coincidimos con el asunto de dios, para unos es real, pero para otros es un mito. Ahora, si sabes que para un ateo dios es un mito ?Qu tiene de extra?o que est en contra de erradicar un mito de la sociedad? ?Ves algo malo en ello?

Para cualquier ateo es muy fcil demostrar la NO existencia de dios, con argumentos simples....     y de hecho ningn creyente puede demostrar la existencia del dios que profesa...

Y esque muchos creyentes se han envuelto en un juego de RAZN y LGICA y FSICA y dems ciencias... que no competen a las creencias religiosas.    La fe es una cosa, y el conocimiento es algo muy diferente.    Es decir... segn la mayora de las religiones, no pueden demostrar la existencia de su dios, porque su dis no necesita ser demostrado, porque para creer en l, no necesitas purbas, slo necesitas f.... de hecho la f es una de las pruebas m,ximas de todas las religiones... "No debes cuestionar a tu dos, slo debes creer en l"... o acaso t te pondras a exigirle cuentas al dios en el que crees?    Ah est el asunto. T nunca le podrs demostrar a un ateo que tu dios existe, porque tu din no te obedece a ti y no va a darte pruebas de su existencia, pero an as, t crees en el porque tienes FE.    Un ateo no la tiene y puede hablarte de la pobreza del mundo, del sufrimiento que experimentan miles de personas, de las teoras cientficas que niegan a todas las religiones y usar eso como pruebas de la no existencia de tu dios, y l puede hacer eso, porque no tiene fe y no la neesita.

c4c59322f9445bd332e45b8d6a2f175daa	En rgle gnrale, on n'a pas besoin d'apprendre (explicitement) la grammaire de sa langue maternelle pour la ma?triser. Ainsi, les pires difficults de la grammaire fran?aise pour les Fran?aises et les Fran?ais sont les formes devenues inusites, en l'occurrence la formation du pass simple et, pire encore, celle du subjonctif de l'imparfait. Une autre difficult majeure est lie  l'orthographe (en effet, la plupart des Fran?ais de mon age prouvent de grandes difficults avec l'accord du participe pass, mais galement avec les homophonies cens/sens, ces/ses etc.)    Pour les trangers, c'est radicalement diffrent.  Les pires difficults dpendent de l'apprenant, notamment de sa langue maternelle et des autres langues qu'il ou elle ma?trise dj. Elles ne sont pas les mmes pour un Italien, pour un Anglais, pour un Russe ou pour un Chinois.  De fa?on gnrale, j'arrive  recenser trois types de difficults :    - les difficults lies aux diffrences dans la reprsentation du temps et de l'espace : ces diffrences font qu'il est souvent impossible de trouver des correspondances exactes entre les prpositions utilises dans les langues concernes (par exemple, la prposition "of" en anglais ne correspond pas exactement  "de" en fran?ais), et les subtilits lies  l'usage des prpositions sont des sources d'erreurs mme au bout de plusieurs annes d'tudes ;    - des catgories grammaticales inexistantes dans sa propre langue sont difficiles  ma?triser pour un tranger : il en va ainsi du subjonctif ou des articles pour les locuteurs des langues slaves, du genre grammatical pour les anglophones, du pluriel ou des temps grammaticaux pour les personnes originaires de certains pays d'Asie...    - enfin, certaines distinctions inexistantes dans sa propre langue sont galement trs difficiles  ma?triser : par exemple, les langues slaves n'ont qu'un seul temps au pass ; par consquent, les personnes originaires de ces pays ont beaucoup de mal  assimiler la diffrence entre l'imparfait et le pass compos. De nombreuses personnes utilisent ces deux temps de fa?on errone mme aprs plusieurs annes d'tudes.|`|1aa40983ab748891280c937914601a6faa	chaque langue a ses difficults et ...ses verbes irrguliers.

m9SvjVDbaa	It is in fact correct not all transgender people are gay. Can we all just agree on that at least? Not all transgender people are transsexual either. I think for the most part people just honestly forget to mention us as an honest ommission, not a deliberate removal of us from the community. I do know of some people that feel we do not belong in the community both trans and gay alike. They have their reasons and they are entitled to them. If one were to take a look back at the modern LGBTQ movement however it is plainly obvious that the transgender community wer the first to stand at stonewall figting for the rights of all of us alongside the GLB. Anyone that cares to disagree or learn more can do their homework and corroborate this. That's aimed at you marck or whatever your name is, that is what thetrans community has done for you.The entire story is too long to publish here. For some 40 years the LGBQ and T community have gone hand in hand facing and fighting the same discriminatory practices, one group for orientation, one for gender expression. While these aren't the same thing, society at large views them the same. In a perfect world there would be no need for categorizing people in any form, but there is and when groups are being discriminated against and are fighting for rights, rights which require political and legal measures to change (ie; votes) doesn't it make sense for people to band together and fight for them together as one rather than 2, 3, or even 5 distinct arms? That's just my take on it and if you feel the logic is flawed feel free to point out how and why. While certainly there are componenet of the LGBTQ that are not going to get along well, most notably lesbians and MTF persons evidenced over and over again, not all are that way by any measure. The more time passes the more and more it seems we all get along which is in large part due to the youth movement withing the LGBTQ. The transgender portion is by and far the most misunderstood.   Sensual- not to pick a fight but you are aware of the definiton of transgender as an umbrella term which includes transsexuals right? I just see that you continually get aggravated by its use. I tend to notice that for the most part questions about transsexuals tend to use that word specifically and a question about "transgender" is meant to include all the groups it covers. I wasn't aware previously the english found it offensive- none I have met told me this before not even in the 3 months we spent in London, but it is good to be aware of in the future. I'd just suggest you remember questions about "Transgenders" doesn't necessarily mean "transsexual". it refers to many groups of people that have varying forms of gender expression.|`|AA11582562	thats why i say the lgbtq community instead of the lesbian or gay community. But I guess when people say the gay community, the transgendered people are a part of it too.|`|XQBHQCaCaa	i have a better question: why do transgendered people expect support from gay men and lesbians if when they are asked they make it quite clear they're not gay?!    let's define terms here:  'transgendered' and 'transexual' generally refer to those who have had or desire surgical gender reassignment to adjust a perceived error in physical sexual development.  'transvestism' is a fetish, i.e., eroticising the clothing associated with the opposite sex; 'drag' is entertainment and/or an indulgence in social satire and/or an expression of disdain for culturally sactioned gender roles.  to my knowledge, none of the patrons of the Stonewall when the last raid on the joint incited the days-long protests in Sheridan Square had undergone gender-reassignment surgery (though there may have been anywhere from one to a handful of transgendered individuals participating in the riots, this sort of surgery was quite rare in 1969).  The chant, "we are the Stonewall girls, we wear our hair in curls, we don't wear underwear, we show our pubic hair,' smacks more of social satire than the result of a surgical procedure.      For the record, as a gay man, though I have no particular desire to prevent transgendered individuals from the benefits of sexual liberation, an insistence on the part of transgendered individuals that theirs is not a question of homosexuality, but medical exigency, without acknowledgement of the FACT that associating gay men and lesbians with those who desire gender reassignment reinforces the common misunderstanding that homosexuals 'want to be members of the opposite sex,' and is therefore counterproductive to attempts to educate the general public regarding the TRUTH of what homosexuality is.  If transgendered people expect the support of the gay and lesbian community, they should take it upon themselves to devise effective communication of their ACTUAL relationship to the gay community in order to help remedy this unfortunate state of affairs, i.e., that these are entirely separate issues: one is about gender, the other about sexual orientation.  I have yet to hear this distinction elucidated by spokespersons for transgendered issues in a way that doesn't make it seem like gender is a more 'real' (read, 'medical') issue than sexual orientation (read, 'psychological).|`|35468b8b2c2c48f3b2cc38f76c22abf5aa	I'm transgendered, and I'm not saying this to be mean, but only to tell you what I've experienced and how I feel.  It doesn't seem at all like we fit in, like we belong, or are even wanted around.  It seems to me that some LGB's wouldn't mind if we all just died, dried up and blew away.  I have a sister who's a lesbian and her face twists in disgust whenever she sees me express my gender, there's been a book written by a lesbian titled "The Transsexual Empire" which pretty much says us transgendered women are only play acting because we want to infiltrate the lesbian community.  A very close friend of mine, also a transgendered girl was beaten in a gay bar because one man decided trannies don't belong.    I understand the "religious right" hating us so, but I would really like to know why the LGB community seems to hate us too... it seems to me that when we are included in LGBT, it's only as a matter of convenience.  We always seem to be left behind...|`|0l8n5vK8aa	I feel that it has to do with we versus them still. Part of this I belive needs to supported. When do you make a split. When do you want your cause put before someone elses. I support gay rights, I am a straight female I have that luxery to a point because I am also a teacher. My husband is a CD. We always debate if transexuals and transgenders should be paired. Just tonight I was talking about Shrek the 3rd and the ugly step sister, I think that it is good  that children are exposed to her and that it is no big deal. This is something that is good. There are moments that it can be taken as a joke but all of the princesses were friends with her and there was no questions among them that she belonged. There seems to be A LOT in the media lately about transgenders. I think in the long run this is also good, more exposure more acceptance. But what I wonder is where this leaves my husband and other CDs because of this division. It's fine to be Transgendered because of "chemical embalances" yada yada, but the Transexuals are choosing this life. This goes along with the fight to show that homosexuals are not choosing their lifstyele. Since so many people are still blind to this fact, individuals may want to differentiate themselves becasue of what people (read media) will say that. So it does become should I fight for myself or should it be all for one...|`|j77VvZ7Daa	Well not all trannies are gay or lesbians...|`|c3TwDu4Laa	i saw some transgendered questions on her and i answer them .|`|tdYUw3zgaa	Basically they're scared I've no problems with it if you are be who you are with pride sport.|`|a01070e9d9f950bf0965a835cdcc1eaaaa	Not all transgendered people are gay.

He is however bisexual.  Not all crossdressers are gay.  But at the same time... I don't understand why the gay community is so close knit and unaccepting of these people.     A lot of gay people think straight people should be more accepting of the gay community. Why not the gay community being more accepting of the transgendered community?

Segunda deben mantener una organizacin generalmente de tipo piramidal, obviamente hasta arriba su "lider" (take me whit u lider!) y de ah hacia abajo por categorias, como los ejercitos.  Tercero tener un fin comn ?tratar de conquistar elmundo?  Cuarto, medios para desarrollarse, dinero, de menos para tener en sus juntas cerveza y comida... o si son muy puristas leche y galletas =?  Quinto: No decirle a nadie!!  Las "sociedades secretas" dejaron de serlo al darse a conocer, como la de La Rama Dorada, Tule, Masoneria, Rosacruces, etc. Lo mas comn hoy en dia es mantener una sociedad y dentro de ella un crculo interno al cual pocos puedan ingresar.  Busca sobre Aleister Crowley - espero haberlo escrito bien =(- en internet, junto a las sociedades que te he escrito. Checate la pelcula Desde el Infierno, lee El Misterio de las Catedrales de Foucalt - otravez espero escribirlo bin - y te dars una idea.

Western Poison-oak (Toxicodendron diversilobum or Rhus diversiloba) is found only on the Pacific Coast of North America, ranging from southern Canada to Baja California.   Atlantic Poison-oak (Toxicodendron pubescens or Rhus toxicarium) grows mostly in sandy soils in eastern parts of the United States. Since it doesn't grow in other parts of the world it's not widely known to public, among the specialist it goes under it's latin name.|`|q2BRRSHmaa	Poison oak? you mean the tree? oak? I guess so...

Either way if you are in russia, they will still understand you. You will just sound like a foreign person speaking russian. Also i tried to make it sound as best i could with the english pronounciation. If you want more random russian words get a Langenschiedt russian pocket dictionary. good luck.|`|1xqdtJY5aa	There is no exact equivalent because it's an indigenous American plant from the poison ivy group.  So, Russian spelling will be either    [ya-do-vEE-tiy doob]  or    [ya-do-vEE-tiy plyushch]    Try to pronounce "plyushch" ;-)
AA11599370	None of the above. It just doesn't make any sense this way. Normally you just don't take abbreviations like that and translate it into another abbreviation.  Only one exception - KGB :):) Which is a phonetic copy of a Russian abridged name.  As an option that would be somewhat creative and would deliver at least part of the message you can go with standard Russian abbreviation system used for Universities, that would be: First one or two letters from the place the University is at +  (  = State University). i.e:  -    (Moscow State University),  -    (Omsk State University). So I would go with "" or ", . ". To the Russian native it would be an instant association with State University even tho one would struggle to understand which one and where it is but they will get the main message.   Hope it will help. I'm Russian. Degree in linguistics.|`|7RzgNaKwaa	The second one is the better transliteration. It correctly includes the long 'a' sound, which is technically pronounced as 'ei'.

Patience, there's a lot of bull$ !^ in the world and getting angry or frustrated usually don't seem to help unless it drives you to find a solution to a problem.   For me, a strong sense of self, knowing who you are and how you should be treated, in other words knowing when to grin and bear it and when to stand up for yourself and say no.

The bible was written by people, it is not the word of god or jesus or any diety.|`|l7MaQKLpaa	The best you can do is read the "words in red" and read what the original apostles said. Jesus warned about those who come in their own name as false prophets. Paul frequently came in his own name and has an air of self-love in his teachings.    One example on why Paul is a false teacher is the fact that he teaches that it's okay to eat food offered to idols. In Revelation, Jesus rebukes a church that's run by a false prophet, Jezebel, who teaches her followers to do the same as well as fornicate.    Also, Paul wasn't liked by the real apostles and eventually stormed off to gather his own following.    Either way, it's safe to ignore Paul's teachings because Jesus said what he needed to say in his ministry. Why risk listening to someone else when you can get the teachings directly from the source? I personally ignore Paul, which takes a nice, unneeded chunk out of the New Testament.

We recognize some value in virtues, but real practice might cause losses in the physical interest, so one just appears to have such virtues. For example, the worship of God attracts admiration among the believers in a large religious community, but a person doesn't want to learn about God and to worship Him properly, so he just imitates their rituals.   Yes, ignorance of no bounds leads to hypocrisy of no bounds. When a man starts learning something of high ideal, he will sincerely accept dangers for the practice of his ideal. True, only education will make the difference.    GU-UN

i5DVnoDIaa	The Frankish Papacy's Involvement in Judeo-Masonry   [Excerpts from "The Two Babylons," Bible Believer's Newsletter,  167, Sydney, 2002.]      The Pope's Attitude towards Judaism  Journalist Robert K. Dahl says that Pope John Paul II's acquiescence to Judaism "has the appearance of treason, regardless of intent" (The Remnant, [St. Paul, MN], April 15, 1998). Indeed, in 1999, when John Paul II made the unprecedented decree that "the seeds infected with anti-Judaism" must "never again take root. . . " he was forbidding opposition to the religion of the Pharisees and proscribing the basis of the mission of Jesus Christ (Statement of Pope John Paul II in his "General Audience" at Rome, April 28, 1999, as reported in the official Vatican newspaper, L'Osservatore Romano, May 5, 1999).    Since adherents of the religion of Judaism do not have faith in either Jesus or the Old Testament Law and prophets, but in the Talmudic and Kabbalistic traditions, exactly what faith is it that John Paul II shares with these "elder brothers" of his?    When this pope claimed that opposition to the religion of Judaism was opposition to the Old Testament, that the religion of Judaism is "a response to God's revelation in the Old Covenant" and that the "Eucharistic prayers" of Christian worship are "according to the models of Jewish tradition," he was either babbling dementia or falling far short of the truth ("Jews and Christians Share Much Together," L'Osservatore Romano, English ed., May 5, 1999).    When, on Good Friday, 1998, the Pope turned the Christian Gospel upside down and proclaimed that "Jews have been crucified by us for so long," it was one of the most atrocious examples of modern Catholicism's slavishly Judaic orientation.    John Paul II is pretending that Judaism is the Old Testament faith minus Christ. But even if that false proposition were true, the Pharisaic leadership would still be guilty of deicide, as Thomas Aquinas held:    "The rulers of the Jews knew that He was the Messiah: and if there was any ignorance in them it was affected ignorance, which could not excuse them. Therefore their sin was the most grievous, both on account of the kind of sin as well as from the malice of their will" (Summa Theologica, Q. 47, Art. 6 Pt. III).    Moreover, the Bible itself declares unambiguously the guilt of the Jewish leadership and the fact that those who adhere to the dogma of these assassins are under wrath:    "For ye brethren became followers of the churches of God which in Judea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews: who both killed the Lord Jesus and their own prophets and have persecuted us; and they please not God and are contrary to all men: forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins always: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost" (I Thessalonians 2:14-16).    No pope, preacher, president, prime minister, or professor has one scintilla of authority or competence to overthrow the preceding Words. The whole world may be arrayed against the Word of God but its force and validity endures.    The recent movement within the Church to declare opposition to Judaism an accursed form of "anti-semitic racism" is, in its inspiration and praxis, thoroughly Talmudic, for it either extinguishes the New Testament's teachings or distorts them to such a degree that they are effectively made "of none effect."    This movement must also ignore or negate 2,000 years of historic Christian exposition of these teachings.    The extra-Biblical and anti-Christian nature of this fifth column within the Church is patent. It derives its credibility almost entirely from the blind allegiance it commands from Christians duped by usurpers and traitors occupying high ecclesiastical office, and by the tremendous glamour which the media accord it.    Since the great criterion of Jesus Christ for assessing the diabolic or the divine was "by their fruits ye shall know them," we discern that the fruits of today's Protestant and Catholic leaders are mostly rotten in this regard. As such, their actions reveal that they are neither "vicars of Christ," nor His ministers or saints. They are in fact agents of Judaism in all but name.    Therefore, the various anathemas these impostors and apostates thunder against Christians, whose only crime is to believe as all the apostles, martyrs and saints of the Church always did, has about the same moral authority as a pronouncement from the Secretary General of the U.N. or the Master of the Masonic Lodge. (Given that the occupation of even the highest of church offices is no longer a guarantor of fidelity to Jesus Christ, the question of who holds true Christian authority is one of the thorniest questions facing Christians today).    The hidden hand of Talmud and Kabbalah is revealed wherever the Jewish people are made the objects of veneration and sanctity. Jewish supremacy was opposed from the earliest days of the Church. John Chrysostom wrote: "Jesus said to them, 'If you are children of Abraham, do the works of Abraham, but as it is, you are seeking to kill Me.' Here He repeatedly returned to their murderous design and reminded them of Abraham. He did this because He wanted to detach them from their racial pride and to deflate their excessive conceit, and to persuade them to no longer place their hope of salvation in Abraham or nobility of race, for this was the thing that prevented them from coming to Christ; namely that they taught that the fact of their descent from Abraham sufficed for their salvation" (The Fathers of the Church: St. John Chrysostom New York: Fathers of the Church, Inc., 1960, p. 70).    By his radical departure from Biblical teaching and Christian practice, John Paul II and hundreds of thousands of Catholic|`|8pBAyOWYaa	I would advise you to join a cult.

According to Wikipedia, to be a Freemason, you MUST BE A MAN.     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemasonry|`|NB3R77k3aa	My father is an elder in his church and a righteous man.    He is also a long-time member of the Freemasons.  If it were a cult, he would have gotten out a long time ago.    My mother is even more of a strict fundamentalist and she felt comfortable being a member of the Order of the Eastern Star (there isn't a group locally or she would still be a member.)    So based on their experiences, I believe that there is nothing there that a Christian should have any problems with.|`|2642c0193ede53221ec03352dbd54362aa	It's not exactly a cult, but women are not allowed and you need to be pretty rich for them to let you in. Also a member has to sponsor you.   Why not join Jehovah's Witnesses? They're sweethearts and sincere and will go to great lengths to help a member or someone interested in them. Also, you'll have friends all over the world in case you ever need something when abroad.|`|bfmOkE7raa	I applaud you for asking questions and facing hard times.  Some think that Free Masons are a cult only because they are shrouded in secrecy.  My Grandpa was a Free Mason but he died when I was very young and never got to know him.  I would have liked to have known myself.  They will answer questions though.  They aren't evil or anything.  Many famous people were Free Masons and if it was just a cult, I think more would be known because a cult thrives on new members.  I think that by the way you ask a question, you will survive the hard times you mention.  Good luck to you and I hope you don't mind but I'm a Christian and for what it's worth, I will pray for you.|`|MIQiUD6Qaa	Hi.  Since you have become a new christian, I definitely would urge you to continue to study the bible and grow more as a christian than joining an organization that will take your focus off of Jesus.  They may say that they won't take away your focus, but the more you become involved with the free masons and their philosophies, the more you will be dragged away from the word of God and what God tells you.  But, if you still are pondering what to do, I came across a website that may help you in making your decision..............     http://www.gotquestions.org/free-masonry...    I hope this helps.|`|yseCNaJ7aa	Well bro, from the details you inquire, I think that you should do what your heart really tells you to, and not with a wordly heart, pray to God about His will for you and the direction He sees fit for you in this point of life. But even like you said, your a new Christian, so my advice would be to hold off on the Free Mason org. for a little bit and really take in this new way of living first becuase if you wern't a Christian before, there are so many things to be relearned and there is a new way of living. So I just think that it would be a lot on your plate to handle but it could be done if thats where your heart leads you.    Hope I could help bro,  -Cole|`|BKPnG6HKaa	I don't know anything about it.|`|6xU6MJPzaa	My dad and granddad were Baptist ministers and both are/were Free Masons.

They want to keep it all secret.  made me wonder about them as to why they would need to hide anything.  I was very suspicious of the goings on there.    However, they helped my daughter when she had her back surgery through the Shriners Hospital.  I am so very grateful to them as it was all free.

Before you do anything go to the book store and read about them. Try to get both sides of the story (always recomended). Get two books both pro and con. You will find that the lower levels seem compatable but he upper levels teach that Christ is not the only God and not the only way to salvation. Research the entering ceramony, you must state that you are in darkness and wish to enter the light. You know as a Christian that you are Not in darkness and Christ is the light, not the Free Masons.|`|eZbkg3BWaa	I think Christianity in itself comes close to being a cult.  Just a widely accepted one...  The Free Masons are most definitely a cult, yeah.  (At least according to what I have heard.)    Only for the record:  It might be a cult, and there may still be some good things about it. That does not make it less of a cult, though. And the downsides are usually quite many.

0a2z26WNaa	Teenagers are often not ready for the emotional impact of sex, and until they realize is more than physical they shouldn't be having it.  Sex put both participants in a very vulnerable place, and you should be able to trust your partner with that.  You should be able to say you love your partner and that THEY LOVE YOU.   It's a special thing between two people.    Among the obvious risks.|`|AA10021316	It complicates relationships.  If you are in a meaningful relationship and you have sex it makes it so much more difficult to break away and be your own person.  Also you are too young to enjoy it completely.  But, I think it is silly to not have sex before marriage because what if you get married and find you are not sexually compatible with your spouse?  That'd be shitty!|`|7da70dba626f58a71476fe461c368697aa	It is not a question of weather it is right or wrong in that context but weather it is right or wrong for the two individuals par-taking in the sex. If the two feel that it is right then it simply is and if the two feel that it is wrong then it is wrong.  It is how the individual feels about sex with the partner. Society and religion try to govern certain privileges.|`|TV6Fg9bWaa	it isnt wrong i guess. its the parents choice whether or not they care about the rule. but it is your call to disobey or to have sex. as long as you have safe sex (condoms, lubricants) its fine. though when i had sex i felt dirty..... (i have a big consience) i wanted to tell somone but my friends didnt belive in sex in highschool. it can hurt you emotionally. its so much fun to have sex with the person you love, but what your feel afterwards can be a totally differnet feeling. it depends on the person, one girl in my highschool had sex with ALL the guys.. and she didnt fel very dirty afterwoards. its up to you|`|LvWIIJD7aa	is not is just that teen's now a day decide to have sex when ever they feel like it so,the girl ends up pregnant then the drama begins.they are too young,what where they thinking,is she going to have the baby all of this questions come to mind when she gets pregnant.that's why is view as wrong by parent and older people.the reason why is wrong as a teen is because you still have a long way to  go some have not even finished high school.while in the other hand if you are older or married most likely you have a way to support your self and have some one who will be with you by your side.most teen dad's don't stick around.|`|k6aSszgWaa	Because of the risk of having a baby plan and simple .|`|7zZUUZ6uaa	Most likely teenagers are not ready for it.

The concept of right and wrong lies purely with the person. If I say gay marriage is right, another will come along and say it's wrong. It's all how we're raised and our own personal beliefs.      I would discourage teenaged sex only because accidents DO Happen. I got pregnant after being on the pill for three years and never missing a single dose -- Accidents happen. Fortunately I miscarried, but if a child (Teenagers are still children) gets pregnant, how do they expect to take care of it?      I will teach my children about safe sex, that way I know when they DO have it, they'll be safe about it.

Plus you should only have sex if your ready to deal with the consequences. This goes for teens and adults.

BUT and this is the thing, a LOT of people felt that way, and with good reason, during the the outbreak of the US civil war of 1861, the beginning of WWI in 1914, the great depression of the 1930's, WWII in the mid 1940's, the Korean War of 1952, the Vietnam War of the 1960s..... you get my drift here?    Look, the best thing you can do is to try to live your faith the best you can and practice "walking in the light" like John taught and share the "good news" as oppose to this fear based message of getting people to believe what you do in order to avoid "hell."    This message of impending doom does no one any good, not you, not your group and it is certainly not very well received by non believers.

I don't see what makes the Bible different from other books. For example, some kid comes on YA and asks how they can become a vampire because they read Twilight. Everyone tells them vampires aren't real. If someone asks about the Bible, people insist that it is all true. While there may be some historical events described in the Bible (I doubt it, but hey, I wasn't there) I really think it is predominantly a work of fiction.    I'm not trying to have a go, it's just that other people who don't believe will probably have similar reasoning to what I just wrote up there ^

It's just that easy.  They have enormous personal freedom.  They even have time where they are not required by the rules of their group to wear the habit (days off, as it were) should they choose to do so.  If they were coerced into becoming nuns, they could easily leave.    I'm sorry if you get called names or given dirty looks, but the comparison to nuns is OLD OLD OLD and everyone knows it's not valid.  These are women who make a personal choice at adulthood, knowing what will be asked of them.  They are not threatened with anything should they choose not to join a convent, nor if they leave.  There is a whole process one must go through to accept holy orders.      Wear whatever you want.  Enjoy your clothes in good health.  But don't try and tell anyone that every last woman who dresses in a hijab or niqab or burkaa or abaaya or chadour or whatever garment you can think of, does so out of her own free will, because we ***ALL*** know that isn't so.  If it were, why would so many take off these clothes when they come to the west, or when the Taliban was run out of Afghanistan?  Why do the majority of those women who do wear them in the west wear them with knee boots, makeup and skinny jeans, low-cut tops, hair hanging out, etc.....?      I know many women who wear it by choice.  I respect their choice.  But until ***ALL*** Muslimahs have that choice, without fear of retribution, some people are going to assume you're being forced.  It isn't fair, but that's how preception works.    Instead of complaining that non-Muslims give dirty looks, etc., why not complain against those that force your sisters to do something they don't want?  Once the only women wearing them are those that want to, very few people will believe you're forced to wear it.    In the mean time, why not smile at people, show them you're happy this way?  At least you'll be smiling.|`|UpIjgNV5aa	For one nun is not judged by a mere piece of cloth or that piece of cloth makes her symbol of Piety. For nuns themselves covering of hair is not central or the whole religion. Do people cherish Mother Theresa b/c her hair were covered? Is nuns religion merely complete at wearing a scarf. What about looking after the Orphans, looking after people, schools, running charities, helping people . . . . Of course our mothers(Ummel Mominin) Veiled yet was there Islam complete at Veil and others things don't matter?     The problem is not that, you can simply reverse it and ask why in the same way women are demonized, pressured, coerced, bullied in Islamic countries if they refuse to wear a Hijab. There is NO doubt overwhelming majority of women are forced to wear Hijab be it Pakistan, Iran, Afghanistan, Malaysia, Somalia, Iraq, Saudi Arabia . . . . .     So why no condemnation then? How is forcing to wear Hijab and giving them no choice different than not letting others wear a Hijab or stigmatized. There is NO doubt women are controlled and abused in many Islamic countries . . . You NEED glasses? It is abhorred if there is no problem then that simply means there is no need for solution. So what let all these women be oppressed and threatened. In Islamic countries when a woman is beaten it is still the woman that is demonized so you telling me Allah(SWT) would tolerate such thing.     Tell me why is there no such fury when women are forced to wear Hijab, why they must not have a choice. No the point is not that women should be allowed to wear a Hijab but that women MUST have a choice and no stigma attached either way!!!     "49.9":    And if two parties of the believers quarrel, make peace between them; but if one of them acts wrongfully towards the other, fight that which acts wrongfully until they submit to Allah's command; then if it returns, make peace between them with justice and act equitably; surely Allah loves those who act equitably.|`|65Rzxlv2aa	Nuns DON'T WEAR A BURQUA... and they DON'T COVER THEIR FACES.|`|MfLhxmIlaa	I'll tell you why because they're jealous that we're proud Muslims and that we choose to wear our hijabs it just makes them envy us.

You expect too much from the general population of humans in general.  The reason the "nun" is revered is that she has taken a vow of celebacy, poverty, and to be in service of humanity. She is still governed by the male dominated church, but she makes her choice to become a nun. To be a nun you must have come of your own free will, relinquish all worldly possessions, and live as mandated by the church. It has to be of her own free will. But, she can also leave when ever she wants too. She will have to talk it over with her superiors and be able to leave on good terms, but she does not need permission to leave and never ostricized for her decision.  There are many nuns that do not wear the full dress, habit, robes, underclothes, ect. There are many that where mandated modern wear such as below the knee skirts, button shirts, and then the headress or not.  There are some that actually wear jeans and t-shirts but keep the hat or a modern form of cover and wear pins or denominated jewelry to show they are nuns. It is different in every culture.  Just like there are many different muslimah women. Some chose to wear the hijab and others do not. Some only wear it to temple or mosque, some do not. But many Americans have only seen what is on the TV and through the media. There are some areas in the middle east, of the muslim faith, that mandate that women completely cover themselves (the blue or black all over body "tarp" with a screen for the eyes. These are in extreme areas and it is made law of that town not just religious law. There are many areas there that are - as they call themselves - true muslim where the oppression of women is still considered the right of man and women are no more than breeding stock and property. But there are thousands of areas where it is up to the woman to wear it or not. This is not always told over the media. We have to remember that most news stories or observances are sensationalized (especially during the Bush administration) to rally for his war and to keep people watching their programs on the tv.   I hope you will understand and not think all us think this way. There are a lot of people that actually do think for themselves and find the truth to the stories we are fed.|`|a1cLXGwxaa	Nuns have never been in the spot light be for and never have been target by the media !

In some of the ultra-conservative sects of Christianity, which are as oppressive as Islam, they are called out for being the Hippocrates that they are.     In the USA, Muslim woman wear the Hijab, by choice.  If they convert to Christianity there is no problem in continuing to wear the Hijab.     Sharia law/Muslims certainly is not going to ever force Non-Muslim woman in the USA to wear the Hijab.|`|zz6phb8Oaa	I am by no means dissing the Muslim faith.... It has its place / purpose.

Because they're so mired in their own dogma, they assume (wrongly) that any system of thought MUST also be a religion.

They don't "believe" in science, they accept that it has an outstanding track record of sorting fact from BS, always searches for more and better answers, is self-correcting, and has no dogma.

There is no conflict between the two and it may suprise you they are both on a merger.    What many, myself included, find disturbing is how fundementalist pursuade the ignorant away from truth and run them head long into a wall of false beliefs with issues of heaven-hell and so on...    Mindsets amoung scientist crumble when truth is revealed. Religions do not act as such and have the tendency to war against anyone not in line with their thoughts, am I wrong on this or is history inaccurate?    Currently in science we have quantum mechanics being torn down and the very fabric of this physical reality is being revealed.    Guess what science is telling us today as I type?    They are showing that objects at the quantum level can be at more than one place at a time and further, they disapear when not "focused upon" by the human eye. This of course appears as majic to the ignorant but, God is the biggest scientist of all my friend as he contructed All Things. Science is teaching the true nature of reality while religions teach a distorted untruths with talk of fire and brimestone, the words of the ignorant "unbelievers"...:)|`|cO8b7Pniaa	i think so.|`|hE5UmCcRaa	No. Naturalism is about holding no belief in anything supernatural, i.e. gods, demons, miracles etc, or anything else that can't be proven. Religion is about believing or having faith in something like a god. People with a naturalistic world view (which includes the majority of scientists) believe nothing without evidence.    Why does it disturb you? Are you scared they might be right? It disturbs me that people mistake science/naturalism for a religion. Scientists and people with a naturalist world view don't pray, sing hymns, kill non believers, burn heretics or incite others to commit atrocities in their name.

Scientology, which questionably calls itself a new "religion", is the brainchild of 1950s science fiction writer & occult enthusiast L. Ron Hubbard. The organization, by means of Hubbards self created psychotherapy technique called Dianetics, claims to be able to help rid members of any & all mental constraints including but not limited to emotional scarring (from this & "past" lives) due to "engrams" (past negative experiences stored in our unconscious mind), psychological disorders & chemical imbalances (the solution is to convince members that these things don't actually exist) & drug dependence (including legally prescribed psychopharmaceuticals which counteract the effects of psychological disorders Scientologists believe to be nonexistent). Their treatment of substance abuse includes little more than massive, often dangerous doses of vitamins and unhealthy extended sessions in a sauna.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dianetics S...   Dianetics review: http://dir.salon.com/story/books/review/...   http://www.time.com/time/magazine/articl...   http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Narconon/deto...   http://www.nypress.com/20/22/news&column...     Scientology is most certainly NOT a religion. In fact, one of the only reasons they enjoy "tax exempt status" on religious ground in the United States is because they bullied the IRS into a "deal" through extremely aggressive barratry (which is the offense of persistently instigating groundless lawsuits) against said government agency & its officials, & arranged to drop all 2,500 frivolous lawsuits only when an "agreement" was reached. In addition, Scientology's lawyers hired private investigators to dig up any "dirt" on IRS agents which was then used to blackmail or publicly smear all "vulnerable" agents. It was an all-out WAR that Scientology had waged against the IRS, & was even described as such by Scientology's "CEO", David Miscavige, in his 1993 speech to the International Association of Scientologists.   http://legalminds.lp.findlaw.com/list/fe...   http://www.lermanet.com/scientologynews/...   http://www.factnet.org/headlines/give-aw...   http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Cowen/essays/...     The official Scientology organization is composed of a number of levels. One begins as a preclear & works their way up. One must purchase virtually every service crucial to advancement directly from the "church" & at staggering prices. "Auditing", for example, is purchased in 12? hour blocks, costing anywhere from $200-$750 for introductory sessions to between $8,000 & $9,000 for advanced sessions. Basically, Scientology claims to possess exclusive knowledge of the path to religious redemption & then charges obscene amounts of money for every tiny incremental step towards this end. Visit this link to see how $380,000 is a conservative estimate for the total cost of moving all the way up the Scientology hierarchal ladder:  http://www.xenu.net/archive/prices.html   These are the total costs for auditing alone:   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientology...   Heres an explanation of what auditing is:   http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...     At level OT III (Operating Thetan Level 3), some very strange & fiercely guarded secrets are imparted upon worthy members who have paid enough money to advance to such a level (and no, this isn't a joke): The evil alien ruler Xenu killed millions of aliens (Thetans) from around the universe by kidnapping them, bringing them to earth in golden DC-8 space-planes, stacking them around volcanoes & blowing them up by dropping h-bombs into the volcanoes. Scientologists believe the souls of these aliens (these souls are "Body Thetans") were captured, brainwashed & released; they then attached themselves to our ancestors (and according to Scientologys belief in Thetan immortality, they also attached to us during past lives) & cause many of our mental & physical ills to this day. Auditing is said to clear us of these Body Thetans as well as the mental implants they supposedly impose on our minds.  http://www.spaink.net/cos/essays/atack_o...   http://sf.irk.ru/www/ot3/spaink-ot3.html   http://xenu.net/archive/leaflet/Xenu-Let...   http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/OTIII/     Scientology has taken a very hostile stance towards psychiatry & psychiatric drugs irrespective of the fact that some people require medication to remain adequately functional during everyday life.

Therefore abortion is viewed as the murder of an innocent and defenseless human being.    You shall not kill. (Ex 20:13; cf.

u4SJHSgUaa	Slow on here today, maybe no JW's want to answer?  I'm not JW but I will give my understanding.      It's like a rhetorical question.  The man said Jesus was good, yet Jesus replied none is good but God.  In effect the man just said Jesus was God.  Man acknowledges Him as teacher, says He is good (which only God is) and so the question is posed to make the man reflect on what he just said.  He said Jesus was God.      17 And as he was setting out on his journey, a man ran up and knelt before him and asked him, Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life? 18 And Jesus said to him, Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone.    One of my favorite quotes is by CS Lewis:  I am trying here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish thing that people often say about Him: Im ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I dont accept His claim to be God. That is the one thing we must not say. A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunaticon the level with the man who says he is a poached eggor else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is, the Son of God: or else a madman or something worse. You can shut Him up for a fool, you can spit at Him and kill Him as a demon; or you can fall at His feet and call Him Lord and God. But let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about His being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to.    Jesus Himself said He is God in John 10:30 Jesus says; "I and my Father are one."    The Jews tried Him in a court of law because He claimed to be God, which was a crime and punishable by death.    Jesus never said He wasn't God, man has.|`|c981080a505c06221f237c3acf97f037aa	I choose MTfor grace as best answer.

Compared to a murderer, a petty thief might seem pretty good. Compared to the cost of a movie theater, renting DVDs might seem pretty good. But compared to God, no one is good.

"And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent."|`|Q82K0pQFaa	It is a statement that He IS God.  He did not say either "I am not good", nor "I am not God".  The statement was intended to be an eye-opener, just as John 8:58!  God bless everyone!|`|yz6qXwUiaa	Jesus didn't accept titles, he gave all glory to his Father.  In this case he was saying that only Jehovah can set the standard for what is good.|`|JMi0TrC0aa	This is like asking JWs why wasn't Jesus Lord...    Luke 6:45-46...  45The good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart, and the evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart. For out of the overflow of his heart his mouth speaks.  46"Why do you call me, 'Lord, Lord,' and do not do what I say?    In verse 45 Jesus used the same Greek word agathos (good) three times, and then He asked them why they called Him Lord. The Good Shepherd was always called Lord, but He was making an identical statement as He did in Mark 10:18. There is not one word in the Bible saying Jesus is not sinless, therefore He is Morally Good.     In Proverbs 13:2;21-22 the Septuagint Greek word agathos (good) was used once in each of those three verses showing a good man.     2From the fruit of a man's mouth he enjoys good,           But the desire of the treacherous is violence.     21 Evil pursues sinners,         But to the righteous, good shall be repaid.   22 A good man leaves an inheritance to his childrens children,         But the wealth of the sinner is stored up for the righteous.    If Jesus was not absolutely and morally Good in JW standards, then they must be thinking Jesus as an immoral and sinful teacher, which is totally against the biblical understanding of the Messiah, and totally against the True Christ Himself.|`|fxHEZGcCaa	Greetings,    Some Trinitarians interpret this as an example of Jesus teaching that he was really God. Non-Trinitarians interpret this as an example of Jesus denying that he was equal to God.    Trinitarians say that Christ meant for the man to realize that his calling Jesus good meant Jesus was God since only God is good.    Non-Trinitarians say the man was using the title improperly in an absolute sense and that Jesus took the opportunity to teach him that only God should be considered to be supremely good, and not Christ.    Since the man was attempting to achieve everlasting life by means of the Law "The saying of Christ appears especially appropriate in the light of the Rabbinic apothegm, There is nothing else that is good but the law."--Vincent's Word Studies; Mt.19:17    Since this Rabbinic saying is a direct parallel to Christs words it provides evidence on how Christs words would have been understood. So Christ was saying: "Rather than me, you need to look to a higher authority as the source of everlasting life."    What is clear is that the Trinitarian interpretation must arbitrarily import ideas into the text. That is, nowhere in the context is there anything that leads to the conclusion that Jesus should be viewed as equal to God or that his intentions were to lead the man to this conclusion. This conclusion has to be read into the text according to a presupposed theological bias. Neither the grammar nor the context even implies such an conclusion. Further, the context denies such an implication and the grammar argues against it. This is noted even by many Trinitarian scholars:    Interpreter's Bible:  "Why do you call me good? This question shows the primitive character of the story...later theologians interpreted it otherwise: 'If you call me good, you imply that I am God'--but this is wholly impossible, both in the original setting and for Mark. Such identification came later. The perfect goodness of God was a universal doctrine of Judaism (cf. Ps. 145:9). Jesus has the natural attitude toward God of every pious and devout Jew." (Interpreter's Bible 7:801, 1951).    The Catholic NAB:  "Why do you call me good?: Jesus repudiates the term "good" for himself and directs it to God, the source of all goodness who alone can grant the gift of eternal life; cf. Mt 19:16-17"--(NAB ftn. on Mk. 10:18).    The literal rendering of Luke 18:19 is: There is none good, but the one God (EI MH EIS hO QEOS). Use of the article (hO QEOS) here is significant. In Mark, only the Father is hO QEOS, never Jesus (cf. 15:34). Christs words then specifically identify God the Father as the only one who is good and explicitly excludes himself (and all others). Jesus could not have used this syntax to give the meaning that Trinitarians claim. This fact is placed beyond debate when we notice the same exact Greek expression in other passages that have no theological baggage.    For instance: Mk. 2:7: Why is this man talking in this manner? ...Who can forgive sins except one, God?    This question and answer is almost an exact parallel making it very clear that the grammatical structure is designed to exclude the subject from the identification in the response. The Pharisees certainly wanted to explicitly exclude Jesus from being God. Their argument was explicit: "This man is NOT God since ONLY God can forgive sins." Also note Lk 5:21.    The words "except God" (EI MH) except the Father alone (EIS O QEOV) were chosen because they clearly excluded Jesus. Conversely, if Jesus meant to imply that he be considered "good" in the sense the man used why would Jesus use syntax which could only be understood as excluding himself?    The ultimate and final authority on what Jesus meant lies in how the man understood the correction. We get a definite answer when the man in his very next words dropped the "Good" and addressed Jesus simply as "Teacher." It was obviously very clear to the man that Jesus was excluding himself from being called good since he was not God. Jesus obviously thought the man got the correct point since he did not correct the man this time. Rather, Jesus "loved him" and invited him to be his follower! Would Jesus have done this if the man was so obtuse as to miss or reject Jesus' point?    In Mark Jesus and God are always differentiated! (1:24) Jesus is not God but The son of God and The holy one of God. Jesus has a God (15:34) and is at the right hand of God (16:19).    Luke also records Jesus invoking the powerful *Shema Israel* of Deuteronomy 6, teaching that The LORD God (Jehovah) is the only God and by using the words our God Jesus includes himself as having a God (12:29-32). Further, Jesus then cites the words of Ps. 105:1 which decidedly differentiates the Messiah from the One God (12:36)!    In this case, there is no reason for the man to understand that Jesus should be addressed as if he were actually God. No one in Scripture, nor any Christian until the third century, ever viewed Jesus should be addressed as if he were actually God. No one in Scripture, nor any Christian until the third century, ever viewed Jesus as God Almighty. So the assumption that this man was corrected because he should have understood Jesus was Almighty God is a anachronism, and thus a false self-serving argument.    In conclusion, it is first clear that the context and the grammar shows that Jesus gave no indication that the man must recognize he was Almighty God. To the contrary Jesus' response was a clear correction of what was said, rejecting the application of the term "good" to himself in this circumstance.    And second, the abundance of Scriptural proof that Jesus was inferior to God refutes the Trinitarian interpretation here.     The fact that others are properly called "good" in the Scriptures prove|`|5vqo3XzHaa	Jesus is not denying that He is good, neither is He denying He is God.  He is questioning the young ruler's standard of righteousness.  God bless!!!|`|VJnuDRR9aa	If Jesus was not good then what was he? Think about it!!!! If he was not good then how could someone who wasn't good die for our sins?Could someone less then good die for a sacrifice?     In the foreshadow of the lamb of God that would take away the sins of the world,the lamb had to be a good lamb perfect in every way without spot or blemish .The Lamb was examined to see if it was good enough and then (and only then) this was an acceptable sacrifice.Indeed if Jesus was not good then his sacrifice was not valid so he had to be good .If not we continue in our sins forever.Jesus taught as Rabbi.s taught by asking questions.Teaching that he was good .He asked a question that was drawing this  man.s thinking into understanding something that Jesus did not want to come right out and declare ,but wanted him to realize.    He did this many times during his life on earth and they always seemed to understand what he was implying.    This is the reason that the religious leaders wanted to stone him because they KNEW that by saying he was the Son of God it  made him God and they wanted to charge him with blasphemy.    They did understand correctly the implications of his statements and did comprehend what he was teaching them which is allot more then most understand .today.    Jesus knew exactly what he was doing.    He certainly could not have been teaching that the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world was in anyway not good do you think?       How long will people make what the bible actually says into what they want to teach as doctrine? How long will the blind continue to accept it and not recieve sight?    Jesus was and is GOOD therefore he was showing by this question who he actually was since only ONLY GOD is GOOD.

2TGSjrxPaa	It's just a natural thing.     Most guys who are not Muslim, our age are overly concerned with dating. I guess it's the same thing, just within the boundaries of Islam.    Marriage is not compulsary but in Islam marriage is half the deen, becuase of the sins that it protects you from, so strongly encouraged.    EDIT:@Asker: Yeah it's more than possible. I really disagree with those who claim this sort of discussion is for more sinister reasons. From my personal experience, this is truly not the case. Marrige is always an amazing thing, we go to them when we're little and they are so pretty, images of them on the tele, the happiness. Even from when we are little girls we have this same obsession, its a very natural thing and not as 'blunt' as everyone is making it. Fairy tales and wonderland is what most young girls are envisioning when they talk about marriage, it is possible to have one innocent thing in our life and not everything is about certain things.    =)    Well I know  its not fairytales but it's fun to dream, eh?|`|H8WqMK1eaa	Really, it all comes down to sex.

And it provides women with a stable environment and a place to practice her religion. So if you don't get married then it's not like your fulfilling all of your deen.  Plus we're supposed to get married to fulfill each other's lives(our spouse's life) and have children so Muhammad's(SAW) Ummah will be the biggest on the Day of Judgment.  I don't know if you can get punished per say for not getting married but why wouldn't you want to? It's basically the only way you can legally engage in marital relations and bear/have children is through marriage.|`|DYdXrVVeaa	because they have nothing better to do with their lame lives|`|VVk0hHgpaa	natassia said it all..    but some people dont' wait until marriage to have sex.  each to their own and none of our business.|`|QxbOXDFRaa	Because it's exciting! they get to plan everything for their wedding themselves for once, one huge party, and KIDS i LOVE kids, that's the main reason i can't wait till marriage, i am surrounded by little kids that i take care of as my own, and it's not a bad thing cuz in Islam marriage is preferred when able and mature...so WHY not?? btw you can't say you want to get married  like at 21 then just START looking when you are around that age, it takes awhile to find the right person. And plus for me, everyone gets married early, it's a tradition, around 17-19...so thehy enforce the topic on us like HELLA, seriously u have no idea...|`|OJWApbmbaa	Because in many of those societies women are veiwed as nothing unless they are married. Also everyone at that age is all like "I can't wait to be wife and a mommy!" thing.|`|UUT4rj3zaa	u tell me.|`|xLxGgVQyaa	Pashtun im taking a guess but i get the impression that you spread your legs on a regular bases to many different blokes?|`|FhXzlnDOaa	What else is there to do when you are a Muslim?  Think about it.  You're not allowed to date, mingle with the opposite sex.  Most Muslims are craving normal human contact.      It's not natural to stay separate and untouchable.  There's nothing wrong with kissing, hand holding, hugging...normal displays of affection.|`|tUSOzNdBaa	Because mariage can be good. It can be a way to have a family. If you have a family you have someone care for you at an old age. I wan't to get married. But, i won't rush into it. I will wait a few years like 5 years or so.

But it's actually dangerous for hijabis to wear it thinking it will deter men from looking at you.  If you think it protects, you, you are wrong.  The only things that will protect you is by acting smart (don't be out in dangerous areas, kick first, ask second [lol], etc.).      You should say salaam, even if he is perverted.  A cool, well enunciated salaam might just put him in his place, but still allow you to fulfil your obligation as a Muslim.  And yes, leave and don't speak to him further.    Wear hijab if this is your choice, but just know that it doesn't stop men from thinking, and maybe acting, on impulses that are natural and built into us as humans.|`|RtMZ3Ym2aa	They are following the example of your prophet so you can't complain if you think that paedophile is a man of God. Maybe they want you to be wife no 3 or 4 - I thought it was acceptable (if you can bleed you can breed mindset). Also, I thought you were supposed to lower your gaze!    One who claims to be a messenger of God is expected to live a saintly life. He must not be given to lust, he must not be a sexual pervert, and he must not be a rapist, a highway robber, a war criminal, a mass murderer or an assassin. One who claims to be a messenger of God must have a superior character. He must stand above the vices of the people of his time. Yet Muhammads life is that of a gangster godfather. He raided merchant caravans, looted innocent people, massacred entire male populations and enslaved the women and children. He raped the women captured in war after killing their husbands and told his followers that it is okay to have sex with their captives and their right hand possessions (Quran 33:50) He assassinated those who criticized him and executed them when he came to power and became de facto despot of Arabia. Muhammad was bereft of human compassion. He was an obsessed man with his dreams of grandiosity and could not forgive those who stood in his way. Muhammad was a narcissist like Hitler, Saddam or Stalin. He was astute and knew how to manipulate people, but his emotional intelligence was less evolved than that of a 6-year-old child. He simply could not feel the pain of others. He brutally massacred thousands of innocent people and pillaged their wealth. His ambitions were big and as a narcissist he honestly believed he is entitled to do as he pleased and commit all sorts of crimes and his evil deeds are justified.|`|RVWyPicKaa	Don't happen to me, perhaps because I don't bother going out of the house. Just stay in and answer questions on Yahoo Answers. =P|`|UpIjgNV5aa	So what the hell you want guys to do close their ****** eyes, like you don't get tingles or giggly inside. The crap about wearing Hijab so hide from men is exactly what it is . . . Crap!!    So you telling me you don't have eyes? You are not bound by natures laws or inherent laws of attraction. So you telling me you don't find guys attractive . . . so why the hell guys don't cover themselves and hide their beauty just for their wives. There is a such thing called height of naivety. Believe me if you could read men's minds why they want women covered you yourself would burn that Hijab, trust me if you only understood sick male mind and how Hijab and Leash are the same thing.    The point is not that, rather Hijab sometimes makes the girl even more alluring probably due to enhancement of other  features. Doesn't mean just b/c a girl wears a Hijab she is devoid of feeling all the other girls have, she doesn't want other guys to find her attractive no matter what crap some Hijabis come up with. I know that for a fact . . . they are same like very other girls in every regards. If only you knew!!|`|FhXzlnDOaa	It's ridiculous to believe a piece of clothing can stop human nature.  allah should have known this.  Thank you for telling the God's honest truth.  No matter how modest you are, there are men who don't care.  Hijab will NOT prevent molestation, rape or even unwanted attention.|`|tUSOzNdBaa	Alhamduliah, I don't( get hit on wearing my hijab). Oh are you serious? That old man was hitting on you? Read duas.. It can help you. The same thing happened with my cousin.

But the staring bit - now THATS unusual. Its not unusual its usual, but its unusual.

Its like, i thought Islam taught to lower your gaze? obviously they haven't been taught a lesson.     But..you said, old men? ooo thats strange.    And you are right. SubhaanAllah sometimes Hijab makes the girl more beautiful. I mean, sometimes, a Hijab looks more beautiful than your hair. And makes you just look like a mysterious princess being hidden under baggy clothes or a veil. Not a princess lol but a beautiful woman. And its true. I think many Hijab girls are actually so beautiful. It shows that you don't have to show your hair and very revealing clothes to be such an innocent beautiful girl, but to be natural and humble.     Prophet Mohammed didn't say that to wear Hijab you have to look ugly, but to look elegant and it helps men not get so lustful from looks.|`|AA11111862	Sure, I'll say it- Don't make something big out of a possible good intention. They say salaam, how creeeepy (Sarcasm). But I also live in the US and wear hijab. Men sometimes look because they are  1 looking for a wife or  2 they are happy to see a hijabi in america.  Once I did get hit on and it was at the grocery store. I didn't wear my wedding ring all the time ( my husband & i dont feel the need to wear it) and this guy came up asking me questions & then asked me for marriage. People are not always pervs like you think.|`|H8WqMK1eaa	Well considering in Islamic countries it is normal for older men (ages 40+) to marry girls as young as 12...    I'm not surprised to be hearing that older Muslim guys are staring at you.    What I am surprised about is that YOU are surprised about it.    And perverted men will be perverts whether women are walking around naked or covered from head to toe.    EDIT: @ "Everyone is a friend..."    Where have you been?

It's god revealing himself through your life, and leading you to the truth. If your saved, ask for God's spirit. You will see your thoughts, and wants changing. The holy spirit also transforms Christians. If your full of the spirit, you can have the fruits of the spirit, and a compassion for people. The holy spirit is all about God working through you, changing you, and making you a better person. If God wanted you to see dreams and visions- that's his choice.|`|OT4SrmDXaa	I have had dreams and they all came and true. The only one that can give that kind is God,|`|AA11468524	Yes I heve been filled with the Holy Spirit and I have had visions.  If you are born of God from above then you can have a closer and more intimate relationship with God.  The site below will give you some instruction on how to accomplish this.    http://www.cwgministries.org/Four-Keys-t...    Go to the free downloads and articles and download MP3 and ebooks, articles and there may be a video also.    When dealing directly with God we must be careful to test the spirit, as the enemy tries to send false messages.  How we determine the veracity of the communication is ....how does it align with revealed scripture, (The Bible).  God seeks to have a closer relationship with all believers if we will let Him.

I'm still fairly new to R&S but I've seen you ask it several times. And I've seen you get thorough, reasoned answers each time.    As several respondents have said, I've never heard any Christian who has a high regard for biblical authority suggest that these verses aren't inspired by God. As several respondents to this version of your question have pointed out, no atheist, no person who for whatever reason doesn't accept the authority of the bible, is likely to believe these verses are inspired by God. It's because they're Atheists, or whatever. Duh.    Some of us have answered you before, and pointed you to the historical background (which you can easily check if you are diligent enough in your study of the scriptures to use historical material, reference books etc). We have also pointed you to the other passages by Paul and others (such as Romans 16) which unambiguously endorse women leaders. But nothing changes, other than you rejig the headline from time to time (and apparently rejig your nick from time to time).    So, inevitably, we speculate more on your motives than on the question. Are you just a troll? Are you a Christian, fundamentalist, misogynist troll, or an Atheist troll? Are you just a very wilful, proud, disobedient Christian? Are you a very young person or young Christian who hasn't yet learned that the world (and the church) is full of people who sincerely hold different views to you? It's a developmental thing, recognising different views being held by other people; it's a developmental milestone that some just never reach, like recognising that the person in the mirror is actually YOU, and not somebody else who looks just like you. Is it possibly you've just been very badly taught by ignorant parents, pastors, or whatever, and haven't had the intelligence, courage or resources to think for yourself? Are you just a misogynist? Are you just stupid? Do you not have access to books? We just don't know, and in the absence of any frank response from you to the answers your questions produce, we can only speculate. I'm sure that some of us who do still believe in Christ both pity you and pray for you, but I'm sure that many just pity you.|`|TMb076n6aa	MULTIPLE USER ACCOUNTS POSTS THE SAME QUESTION OVER AND OVER     CHANGED  FROM EDDY T P     TO 1COR 14    RUDE AND VERY SEXIST|`|XqpRYh52aa	Because none of the bible is inspired by god|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	never heard any one say that|`|AA11993919	It is because these verses do away with women preachers.

Perhaps your bible reading is so narrow that your understanding of it is narrow also. Why don't you read ALL of it and see for yourself how God has used women down the ages in various ways. There are some things that women have done, under God's instruction, which would have been impossible for them to do if those words were meant to be as literal and narrow as you seem to think they are.

AA11849917	God did not write the Bible.  God inspired the Bible.    The Bible was written by about 40 different men over a couple of thousand of years.    The amazing thing is that these people were not able to communicate, some wrote while in prison or even a dungeon, some were fishermen, some were farmers, and even one was even a king; and yet they all agree in the basic message that God wants all people everywhere to repent of their sins.    The translations may have had some problems, but nothing that would violate the basic message.  Such problems as the number of horses Solomon had really doesn't affect the Scriptures at all.    The bottom line is that it can be relied on to show us the condition of man, the mind of God, and the way of salvation, among other things.    Again, "Holy men wrote as the Holy Spirit inspired them."|`|hR7OsqtRaa	Galatians 1:11-12  I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached is not something that man made up. I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.    In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"    The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com|`|HdmlZdyHaa	Holy word of God is on the cover and there are many interactions with God and Moses and all those people.|`|AA11726497	2Ti 3:16  All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:     God's Holy Spirit guided men to write the Scriptures.|`|LjsRfaskaa	Actually the bible is plagurised from lots of era's and places. From the ancient Ur, Sommerland culture right up to the Northern Animists.    Where do you think most of the symbolic things relating to Christians festivals comes from.

Even the Messiah is plagurised from the Celtic Cross, which is the Sun's rebirth as it is just above the horizon again.

At the same time as he was supposed to have been around there were a number of Jews claiming to be the messiah - all of whom are well recorded!!    He was supposed to have been a huge problem to the Romans and produced wonderful miracles but still not one contemporary record?    Even the bible mentions of him like all other references were not written until many years after his supposed death!!    Pilot is recorded in the Roman record as a somewhat lack luster man but no mention of a Jesus, a trial or crucifixion that would surely have been used to make him look brighter!!    At best he was an amalgam of those others!!      The Roman Emperor Constantine produced the bible and he was a pagan not god!!!   He also organized Christianity into the Holly Roman Catholic Church!!  Not in Israel or any of the countries of supposed origin but entirely Italian!!    Not one word of it is contemporary with the period and was not written until many years after the period the story is set in!!    What a wonder full disinformation and deception campaign he waged against his Christian enemies - so good in fact that Christians are still following the deception to this day!!!    No doubt you will snort and say it is anti Christian but if you have the courage check it out!!

As a human being, an American citizen, and a lifelong atheist, I deeply resent being treated as a hated enemy merely because I have brains enough to appreciate the difference between that which is actually real and that which is merely a commonly held superstitious delusion.      Your deliberate willful insanity is undermining the very country that provides useless parasites (such as yourself?) the right to believe as they please.  If you succeed in undermining American civilization, who will feed and clothe you?  Who will make your medicines?  Who will defend your right to your own beliefs, even though you are a useless bigot and an embarrassment to the human species?  ...that would be we atheist scientists and engineers, and the countless moderate Christians who actually built this Democratic civilization you are so eager to destroy.  Bigot!  You are a traitor to both your species and your country.      Edit:  Your do not know how wrong you are.  92% of the National Academy of Sciences (America's finest) freely admit to being atheists.  The great majority of professional scientists and engineers are atheists, agnostics, or Pagans.  (There is also a significant minority of (generally older) liberal broad-minded Christians.)  This is because, to be a successful scientist/engineer one must understand how objective reality actually operates.  Without a deep understanding and acceptance of the physical truth, it is impossible to be an effective scientist or engineer.  Christian superstition insists that human subjective mental experiences are the basis of reality and the superstitious fools who believe this nonsense simply cannot function as professional scientists or as high level engineers.  One must completely understand objective reality to be an effective scientist or engineer and most deeply superstitious Fundies simply don't have the necessary skill set.   ...and how could they, they've already  deliberately rejected reason, logic, and verifiable facts long before they even began their higher education?|`|ST7WcWfsaa	Respected Sir,    Assuming that everyone solely focuses on commonalities alone & simply respects i.e. ignores differences amongst different religions, sects, denominations, and groups, one of the major problems lie in only one of the controversial "commonalities" itself. That is, all adherents & non-adherents believe in the necessity to advertise & promote their religions or ideas thereabout. Even some atheists, including evolutionists, feel the need to have religions eradicated, and as a result, try to impose their own philosophies in terms of evolution etc. If an atheist or a non-believer is not interested in learning or knowing "religious crap", an adherents' very act of imposing their "religion" may become the first attempt to annoy the atheists, and vice versa.     Your desire to keep our religious or non-religious ideas, all to ourselves, is a great one. However, it is impossible for the long run. Unfortunately, the world was designed to become subject of destruction & peace. If unity really was to be like the way you have laid it out to be, then we wouldn't be divided in the first place. That is, we would all have been shown complete equality, having same kind of face, same amount of beauty, same level of intelligence, same degree of respect for one another, having no jealousy at all. We are designed to compensate for the work, on behalf of nature, if you will.|`|asX2hxFXaa	Well, in a perfect world that would be fine.

What?  Oh he didn't say that?  .|`|9ozLBt5Qaa	Christian Evangelicalism is growing even though there are many denominations.  They all believe in the Son of God, Jesus. Its our job as Christians to unite and pray with people, to help people.  If they dont want to believe I cannot force them.    >>>By the way the Muslims you might meet and talk with  will probably not all hold the same set of beliefs and doctrines.  Just as within Christianity there are different denominations, and individually held beliefs within each.  However several main denominations can be identified.      1.Shia and 2.Sunni strains split within a generation after the death of Mohammed, over disputes about succession.  Doctrinal differences are not great, but bitterness and persecution can be extreme.  (eg under Saddam Hussein in Iraq)    3.Sufi Islam is more mystical and concerned with a personal relationship with the almighty.    4.Wahabi Islam arose in the 18th century in Saudi Arabia, and would probably have remained insignificant, and considered heretical by the mainstream, but for twentieth century oil wealth.  Wahabiism adopts a much more hard-line interpretation of the Qur'an and Hadith,  and indeed added requirements such as the covering of women and prohibition on them driving cars.  The excesses of the Taliban in Afghanistan originated in Wahabiism, as does the al Quaeda terror campaign against the western world.    You cannot unify muslims with the rest, you can try but - their religion is not compatibale with an ever growing Western culture. They do not agree Jesus is the Son of God.|`|pFZtcix8aa	I belong to an organization that promotes exactly what you propose.

OCfI1d0Aaa	This woman is mentally ill.  I don't care how she does it, but she should NOT be allowed to raise these children!  The only reason she had these children was because she wanted to feel loved    I know I'll be able to afford them when I'm done with my schooling,  She should have had them AFTER she was able to afford them when she already has 6!!    Good for the $2 mil. 'cause that MIGHT cover the hospital cost!!!  "theres a looming price tag out here. The hospital bill alone will run $1.5 to $3 million."  The state isn't going to pay that bill, huh???? She's on disability and doesn't have insurance!    "I just longed for certain connections and attachments with another person that I really lacked, I believe, growing up, she replied."  She already has 6 kids, that's not enough for her???    "Suleman said she went to the same in vitro fertilization clinic to have all 14 of her children. All were conceived with donated sperm from the same father, Suleman said.     Suleman told Curry that the father is a bit overwhelmed right now, but she is hoping that he will want to get to know his children when he is ready."   This woman is sick, sick, sick!

Imagine soccer practice, recital, piano lesson, food, clothes, bedtime stories, doctors, etc, etc, etc.    And for those people who say that that she hadn't been living on welfare, how do you expect a mother of 6, who does not have a husband, to feed her families?    And no, she was not aiming for 7th kid, no doctor in the world would do 8 embryos at a time to a woman who already has 6 kids, 2 of them twins.  She was aiming for 8 extra kids, so she can be a freak show.  If she had just another one, it won't be a big story, the hospital will treat it like just another birth out of millions, news will not report it, and media will not offer her any deal.  She knew full well before doing this.    I feel sorry for the kids that were born, just so the mother could get her 15 minutes of fame and money.    She may not need welfare now, but she definitely has contributed to the overpopulation problems.

AstagirAllah!!|`|8FRiJ1GPaa	Is that sunni who have a different Qur`aan or is that Raafidis - shi'ah?    Lets see :    QUESTION : I have also heard by a shia collegue that their is a surat in their book which is not in the QURAN. can u confirm this? the surat in qs is called SURAT AL-WILAYAT.    Praise be to Allaah.      With regard to Soorat al-Wilaayah, some of the Shiah scholars and imams have stated that it exists. Any of them who denies that does so by way of taqiyah (dissimulation). One of those who clearly stated that it exists is Mirza Hussein Muhammad Taqiy al-Noori al-Tubrusi (d. 1320 AH). He wrote a book in which he claimed that the Quraan had been distorted and that the Sahaabah has concealed some parts of it, including Soorat al-Wilaayah. The Raafidis honoured him after his death by burying him in al-Najaf. This book by al-Tubrusi was published in Iran in 1298 AH, and when it was published there was a great deal of controversy because they wanted the doubts about the validity of the Quraan, which were known only to their leaders, to remain scattered throughout hundreds of their major books, and they did not want that to be compiled in one book. At the beginning of his book he said:      This is a good and noble book entitled Fasl al-khitaab fi ithbaat tahreef Kitaab Rabb il-Arbaab (Decisive comment on the distortion of the Book of the Lord of Lords) He mentioned aayahs and soorahs which he claims that the Sahaabah concealed, including Soorat al-Wilaayah, the text of which, according to them, and as quoted in this book, is:     O you who believe, believe in the Prophet and the Wali [i.e., Ali] whom We have sent to guide you to the straight path, a Prophet and a Wali who are part of one another, and I am the All-Knowing, All-Aware      And they have another soorah which they call Soorat al-Noorayn: O you who believe, believe in the two lights (al-noorayn) which We have sent down to you to recite to you My Verses and to warn you of the punishment of a great Day. They are part of one another and I am the All-Hearing, All-Knowing. Those who fulfil the covenant with Allaah and His Messenger mentioned in the verses (of the Quraan), the Gardens of delight will be theirs, but those who disbelieve after they believed by breaking their covenant and disobeying the command of the Prophet, they will be thrown into Hell. They have wronged themselves and gone against the wasiyyah of the Prophet (i.e., the appointment of Ali as khaleefah), and they will be given to drink of boiling water and other such nonsense.     You can see the entire soorah, along with a telegraphic picture of the Persian mus-haf at the following site:     http://arabic.islamicweb.com/shia/nurain...     Prof. Muhammad Ali Saoodi  who was one of the greatest experts of the Ministry of Justice in Egypt  examined an Iranian mus-haf kept by the Orientalist Bryan and he obtained a copy of this soorah; above the lines of Arabic script there is written the translation in the Iranian language.     As it was mentioned by al-Tubrusi in his book, Fasl al-khitaab fi ithbaat tahreef Kitaab Rabb il-Arbaab, it is also mentioned in their book Dabastan Madhaahib, which is in Farsi, written by Muhsin Faani al-Kashmiri. This book has been printed numerous times in Iran, and this false soorah was quoted from it by the Orientalist Noeldeke in his book The History of Quranic Manuscripts, 2/120, and was published by the French Asian newspaper in 1842 (p. 431-439).     It was also mentioned by Mirza Habibullaah al-Haashimi al-Khoi in his book Manhaaj al-Baraaah fi Sharh Nahj al-Balaaghah (2/217); and by Muhammad Baaqir al-Majlisi in his book Tadhkirat al-Aimmah (p. 19, 20) in Farsi, (published by) Manshoorat Mawlana, Iran.     See also al-Khutoot al-Areedah lil-Asas allati qaama alayha deen al-Shiah by Muhibb al-Deen al-Khateeb.     This claim of theirs is a denial of the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning):     Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e. the Quraan) and surely, We will guard it (from corruption)    [al-Hijr 15:9]     Hence the Muslims are unanimously agreed that anyone who claims that anything in the Quraan has been altered or changed is a kaafir.     Shaykh al-Islaam Ibn Taymiyah said:     The same applies to those among them who claim that some verses of the Quraan have been taken away or concealed, or who claim to have some esoteric interpretations that exempt him from having to do the actions prescribed in shareeah etc., who are called al-Qaraamitah and al-Baatiniyyah, and who include al-Tanaasukhiyyah [names of esoteric sects]. There is no dispute that they are kaafirs.     Al-Saarim al-Maslool, 3/1108-1110.     Ibn Hazm said:     The view that the Quraan has been altered is blatant kufr and is a rejection of what the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said.

BBfIXcI0aa	You are attracted to who and what you are attracted to. It isn't a choice, it's part of who you are. The choice comes in what you do about it. For example, there is an incredibly attractive and intelligent boy in one of my classes, and if I didn't think it was morally wrong I would totally jump his bones, but I do, so I don't. I can't help that he makes me think naughty things, but I can keep from dwelling on those naughty things, and I can certainly keep from doing them, at least until we're married. Which, I mean, crossing my fingers here ;)    (P.S.  For the record, I don't think gay people can help it, and I don't necessarily think they're doomed to a life of celibacy. HOWEVER, in light of their legal inability to marry in most places, I do think they should stay abstinent until they're in what is intended to be a lifelong relationship, just like straight people.)|`|rz4AUvbaaa	It is false belief that produces a seeming anomaly.

The Bible if you CHOOSE to belive it is very clear on this matter.. It says Temptation is not a sin but what you do with it is the sin.. Jesus was tempted in the desert for forty days and forty nights and it was so that he could now ALL temptations and provide us ALL a way out. He says the way of escape comes with the problem and you just have to believe and seek him..We can choose right or wrong..Just like you choose to judge right back when you have chosen to not get the facts and not fully understand the bible and the meaning behind WHY he says to not do it..We all have the power to obey Gods word some just choose to ignore the truth.. I really do not mean to be rude but sometimes harsh rebuke is necassary...Its called SELF gratification.. it feels good to them so they do it but the consequeces are life threatening on so many levels|`|U7sBZKUuaa	Speaking as a Christian, I will say that being gay is not a choice. I say this because I cannot make that choice. If it were a choice, then I could decide to give boys a whirl one day, just to shake things up, but I can't. When I see a man, I don't even understand what women are looking at, and cannot possibly just decide to like it for a while. I can't make that choice because I dig chicks, which is also an orientation that cannot be chosen. I'm sure I was born this way. Yet another pseudosexual orientation that cannot be chosen or "un-chosen" is algolagnia (pain lust) which leads to BDSM activity and which I also have. Many years ago I thought that it was wrong to have such feelings and tried to choose not to, but it just didn't work. I now accept it as a part of who I am.|`|AA12187979	I once had a friend that said he'd could cure a gay person.  He said he'd have a bunch of cute girls rape him.

There is good research that says that some gender identify is hard-wired into the brain prior to birth.  There is also some good research that says it has psychological underpinnings.  The real answer is that it's both.  It's definitely NOT "strictly choice."    But the answer to your other question is yes, I control my sexual urges.  I have to.  If I didn't, they wouldn't let me in the supermarket any more, or the mall, or the car dealership.  There is definitely a little on/off switch in there somewhere.    And yes, I definitely chose to fall in love, and chose not to.  I dated only people that I'd consider marrying, so that I didn't fall in love with someone I didn't want to marry.  And I've had close coworkers that I've had an attraction to, but have chosen to not allow those feelings to take hold.    So I think it's entirely possible for homosexuals to have that same power.    Your idea of the sexual drive of homosexuals is actually quite insulting.  They are people with intellect, capable of controlling themselves just as well as any other human.  Your question assumes that they're unable to control what they like and how they respond to their sexual urges.|`|2Us94NUEaa	So, when your mom, dad, or brother walk buy in their skibbies, you get aroused?  I would venture to say "NO"!  They are your family members and unless you are an out of control freak who is capable of sleeping with and being attracted to anything that moves.  You just tell yourself, "Yuck that's my mom."  It's the same thing with someone of your same sex.     The only time a person is gay is when they have been molested by the same sex of person, and that person was the freak capable of sleeping with the family dog as well.  Some people are immoral thus you have: serial killers, child molesters, prostitutes, gays, etc.  Not everybody wants it to go the way everyone else wants it to go.  Maybe they were all born with it and we should start rally's for them all.      Sorry, this question is so over done already.  I'm really a nice person.  .|`|kmAMgkiraa	You're directing this questions to all Christians which isn't fair. It seems like you have a one set idea of that all Christians are one way. I am a strong Christian and I am not against the gay lifestyle, and I don't understand how they could choose to be attracted to what they are. But I am sure you have come across Christians who think other and that's why you're asking this. And instead of arguing about it, say to them, God tells us we are not to judge. Also they are sinners too. And the bible says that NO SIN IS GREATER THAN ANOTHER. The only sin that is high above others is rejecting the holy spirit. And they need to understand that. We're suppose to love one another not judge people and attack them for their sins. Remind them of that.|`|0wUZbRguaa	ONE:Husband and wife,has the power do love,because they are married.TWO:Homosexuality,is a way of life that people choose.THREE:Love is to be share.FOUR:People manipulate love for his own pleasure.|`|a8cb6e0d7dad19ce4b496c95e407fff2aa	i am bisexual and am also a christian. i can't help that i am. if i could be straight i would but i just can't. however i haven't always been attracted to guys, i used to be straight but this attraction for guys just developed and i've prayed  and prayed for God to make me straight but it hasn't happened. i've never "been" with a guy or a girl as i am only 16, so i haven't given into temptation yet.    anybody that hates gay/bi people because they are gay/bi, are arrogant. thats like hating someone because they have brown hair or they hate rap music. you can't help what you are attracted to and you can't help what kind of natural hair color you have. thats like mohammad hating the jews and christians.     as for the marriage in churches i am against. there are civil unions for gay couples. i don't see why they would want to get married by something that hates gay marriage.

I think you need to look at the difference between attraction and action.   Someone can sin in a heterosexual relationship by having sex before one is married. They are attracted to the opposite sex, but the sin is done either in the lust or the action.   It is the same with homosexuality.  Some people are tempted a little stronger in that area just as others are tempted to murder or to lust.  Some stronger temptations are often due to someone dwelling about a certain sin: i.e. murderers have a stronger temptation to murder possibly that are strengthen from other violence.   Temptations in of themselves are not sin and are not wrong.  Someone can be tempted to be a homosexual, but it is the choice to dwell or lust on that temptation or even act on that temptation.  I hope that this helps.  James 2:12-16.

Mnm35sjNaa	I too equate the "Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil" to free will (and to getting royally reamed).    Have you ever done something you regret? Well, if so, how does that compare to eating a fruit from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil? If all sins are the same to God and all sin is disobedience to God, then eating the apple was, by Gods own terms, a pedestrian sin.    Yet God condemned all of us to death because of a single sin by a pair of humans with no life experience. Are you guilty of Eves sin? Of course not! No more so than for Hillary Clintons sins or for mine. Right off the bat, common sense tells us that the Bible, in Genesis, is preaching a twisted morality. It puts us in opposition to ourselves by claiming our nature is sinful. Biblical sin is a tool to manipulate and control us via fear and guilt. I reject that neurosis: I believe most of us are basically good but we sometimes make mistakes. If we live life believing were no good, then we probably wont be.    On the scales of justice, most people are basically good. If theres an afterlife, many people deserve free admission. And many people dont.    But thats definitely not what the Bible preaches, is it? Were ALL unworthy sinners.    The Bible says God created the universe, including Adam and Eve. They were pure and sinless and had all eternity, in Eden, to bask in Gods glory.    Unless they pissed Him off, of course.    And it doesnt take much to piss off God. No sir! And second chances? Forget about it. One mistake and youre history. By the way, all of your offspring, forever, will also be cursed with death. How do you like them apples?    Because of Adam and Eve, were all born guilty of Original Sin. So much for Gods perfect plan (lets call it, plan A). In fact, Original Sin made the human condition so intractably degenerate that God eventually had to wipe out all life (human or not) with a catastrophic flood so that Noahs family could start humanity anew, from scratch. This was Gods idea of plan B.    Well guess what? Gods plan B was all for naught. A few thousand years later, humanity had repopulated itself from Noahs incestuous Ark and  surprise, surprise  was no better than before. I guess thats what inbreeding gets you. Youd think God would know that.    Time for plan C.    This time, instead of genocide, God chose suicide. He came to Earth personally, as Jesus, to act out a script he divinely inspired, in biblical prophesy, that ended with his own trial, crucifixion, resurrection and ascension back home to heaven.    Why did God do this? Original Sin. Because of Original Sin, we can never be innocent enough for eternal life. We must be forgiven before heavens gates will open for us. If you know your dogma, you know Jesus sacrificed himself on the cross so that we may be redeemed from sin (and have everlasting life). Because God cursed Adam and Eve AND all their descendants  in perpetuity  with death, he had to provide some means for our redemption. The alternative was to abandon us. Quite a conundrum God put himself in, no?    Basically, God had to save us from the curse he imputed upon us to begin with. Im amazed that so many people dont see through this preposterous charade. Perhaps the pretzel logic is too convoluted for most to unravel. The Bible would have us believe  and doctrine upholds  that we are all miserable wretches who will be granted eternal life only if we love Jesus. Of course, this assumes we can trust God not to resort to a plan D or E or whatever. After all, God is all-powerful and a perfectionist: whos going to stop him from tossing out plan C if he decides, yet again, that he still hasnt gotten creation right?    God must regret cursing mankind with death. If God is perfect, we cant say he makes mistakes; so I prefer to say he has regrets. Anyway, I suppose God was hot-headed in his youth; the Old Testament clearly depicts him with a short fuse. So once he imputed death upon us, he couldnt un-impute it. I mean, hes God! Right? His word is law and immutable. What kind of self-respecting God would change his mind? If God is love, then I guess its true that, love means never having to say youre sorry.    Eventually, God found a loophole in his own immutable law: leave mankind cursed but offer individuals an exemption by redemption. Yeah, thats the ticket! For Christs sake  why didnt God think of plan C BEFORE plan B? After all, if redemption is a workable plan, God wiped-out humanity for nothing. I hate when that happens!    You know, the more I think about it, the more I think that the Supreme Being should be an elected position. Surely we can put somebody with more foresight onto the throne of the Ruler of the Universe. At least, if we elect poorly, we can vote for a replacement next time.|`|9mLjDa5kaa	Nobody can work their way into heaven.  Nobody.     And the "koran" is false.     The truth is that salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation.     The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)

nsFQH44Uaa	No! Animals do not have soul, they have the spirit of life/ the breath of life/ life in their blood, but only human the Creator blow his breath into - and they become a living soul.  Because Animals do not have soul  so they don't give an account to their Creator for sin, when they are dead - they are gone out of existence -not to heaven or hell -like mankind. That's why Jesus didn't came to saved animals, only humans.

We have been given the knowledge and power of God and have to answer for how we use it. Animals do not have the knowledge of good and evil, and are running on instinct.

That said, there Church is not without it's many families that do indeed live up to their Catholicity.      >    The fact is, the Church has both lax and devout members. To claim the Church is full of lax Catholics is every bit as fallacious and misleading as to claim the Church is full of "fanatics".      >    When it comes to stereotypes, they are most often used by people who have an ax to grind with the Church. Depending on what their particular beef is, they'll claim the Church is full of lax Catholics that don't practice what the Church preaches. And then there is the other extreme, people who think the Church is too strict and claim all Catholics are 'fanatical' stick-to-their-doctrinal-guns, gung-ho Christians!    As in most cases, the extreme views are wrong. The more moderate, middle-of-the-road view is most often the right one.  The Church is not without it's lax sinners. Having said that, the Church is not without it's devoted saints either.

Well there are a lot of apathetic Catholics, unfortunately. That is mostly what I grew up with. But being lukewarm in condemned in Scripture. Also, some people who are "strict" in their religious practices really don't have a growing faith. We all need to develop a personal relationship with God and be reading God's Word on our own.    But there are plenty of Catholics who are totally on fire for their faith. Like the University of Steubenville and also many of the people who attend the Steubenville summer conferences for youth. The Catholic faith is AWESOME! It's soooo amazing and I encourage you to check out the Catechism, your Bible and as a supplement some stuff by Scott Hahn. The more you learn about our theology and how it is backed up by Scripture and Tradition, the more you fall in love with it.    A note for Bartokk- it would be so sad for you to lose your Catholic faith over some struggles you have with it. They are struggles and if you pray and work to overcome them and understand them you will grow in the process.|`|AA10447614	I think it's a stereotype, though my parents are more devout than most. Faith was an important theme growing up, in part because my parents felt this was the best way to teach morality to me.    I've also seen it work the other way - the more you shove, the more the child rebels. My wife and I are raising our children Catholic (which is our shared faith), although we're encouraging more introspection and understanding as they grow older. I'm not a fan of "We do this because this is how we do it." In my spiritual journey, I was presented a choice to leave the Catholic Church several times, and I always studied and came back to the faith, stronger each time. I'd like my children to feel they have the same choice.    You also have to remember that Catholicism is easily stereotyped. Catholic worship is very visual and so lends itself well to entertainment media. My personal favorite stereotype is from the Cage/Travolta flick "Face Off" when the two adversaries enter an open-air mission-style church for the final battle, and there just happens to be a priest in there, wearing seminarian robes, speaking in Latin to an empty church. I happen to speak enough Latin to know that the priest was speaking nonsense syllables - it was actually quite funny. But it was a dramatic moment, and it reflects another stereotype that Catholicism holds a mystical, symbolic but highly incomprehensible nature.

That rejection by so many does not necessitate a lack of understanding. Trying to paint those who reject with a wild accusation of ignorance is foolish. One can easily love God and also embrace knowledge of how His creation works. What you really resent is the fact that many do not embrace the premature claims presented by those who wish to discredit God.  Kinetic-molecular theory may help bolster your own misguided conclusions. It does not take me down the same path.|`|yB0nVXfWaa	Dear Josh,  Do you reject the first and second laws of thermodynamics as vehemently as you reject creation?    First Law : matter is neither destroyed nor created, so where did this great big universe come from - out of?    Second Law : (entropy) the order and system of things has a tendency to deteriorate over time, not the other way round.  So, that means we could never have come out of the 'primeval swamp' in the first place.    The reason people reject creation is nothing to do with science, but rather to do with atheism.  They don't like God, don't believe in him and so refuse to acknowledge his hand in making the world.  Evolutionary theory happened out of an atheistic desire to find a theory to explain things which would cast doubt on creationism.      Darwin was not a Christian, although his wife was, and in his lifetime he refuted many Christian beliefs.  Out of these seeds came the ideas about evolution and they were readily snapped up by all who also believed similarly to him.    You make a good point when you infer that it's a good thing to know more about science and I personally do not reject science per se.  I think it's a very good thing and respect scientists, though I do get weary of hearing about evolution from every naturalist, botanist, zookeeper and nature lover I hear.  Talk about 'ramming it down our throats' - it's like a mantra!  I also try to learn more about what evolution claims (though it is not my favourite subject) just to keep abreast of things.  So, you see, we are not all a bunch of dum dums!    Oh, I read the other day that there are many scientists in the world who believe in creationism, and many turning to that opinion.  The thing is, it's not politically correct for them to say anything, so most people never hear about it.  And it's largely unreported - not 'good news'.  There'd be such a reaction, they might even lose their jobs, so they keep quiet.      However, these people think that evolution is even harder to believe in than creation.  I mean, no matter how many billions of years you give it, Thermodynamics II still says swamp slime to man can't happen.  But - if anything - man to swamp slime is more likely ...|`|A9vvZ6eUaa	Kinetic-Molecular theory is not clearly stated in the Bible so they will not have a sufficient argument to counter you.|`|HSaVBaiaaa	Do you really think that a creationist is going to know what you just said?

I thought most Christions -were- creationist.    In that case, I don't see anything wrong with the KMT. It's useful for explaining chemistry.    You argument makes little sense anyway. KMT and evolution address completely different things. Also, why only mention that a few Christians don't know KMT? Plenty of non-Christians don't either.    Edit: Ok, I see.   Most creationists do know something about evolution, just not the whole picture.   I should probably go read more about evolution ;)|`|TEtOq1XCaa	We have no reason to reject the kinetic-molecular theory. There are more theological and scientific reasons to reject evolution than to accept it, which is why it is widely rejected by consistent scientists and Christians.    Note that it is perfectly acceptable to reject theories (if you have good reason) - the purpose of a theory is to explain a body of facts or set of observations. Christians believe that Creation is a far more reasonable explanation for what we observe than Evolution - indeed, evolutionists always seem to be changing their theory to explain why their predictions differed from reality. Christians have no need to do this, as newly discovered facts are quite consistent with Creation (a good sign that the theory is correct).    The so-called evidences the media trumpet as "proofs" of evolution occurring in the present are actually great evidence against the naturalistic faith, when analysed by suitably competent scientists.

We simply do not believe in a God, though many of us do see it as a nuisance in society, we do not try and convert people or make people feel uncomfortable and embarrassed when it comes to belief, because surely then that's not belief, it's pressured statements.|`|UnLkBsViaa	Look who's calling the kettle black. Aren't you the one trying to ridicule? You obviously know nothing about Atheists. You generalize and assume to know what an atheist feels or believes, you have this erroneous idea that we are all evil and immoral and  and you break your own Christian rule about loving your neighbor.|`|fN3dsHERaa	Ridicule seems like a strong word for satire. Satire is a literary device used by many (atheists and non atheists) to raise awareness/ make a point in a humorous way.     I think there are lots of appropriate times to make fun of people. However, making fun of someone because they simply believe in a god is not a justified reason...  In my opinion, people should be tolerant of others beliefs. I make fun of the people that can't listen to others' beliefs because it's so far from their take on the truth of religion. We all believe we are right, so just have a friendly debate and hear each other out...no need to ridicule others for their beliefs.     Atheists don't have a joint goal... atheists, universally, only share one thing- we don't believe in a god.     I didn't become atheist because I was embarrassed to be Catholic... since it seems like you can't hear why I became atheist without assuming I'm attacking whatever it is you do or don't belief in- I'm not going to share.     And there are a few atheists on yahoo answers that are offensive and what not- but there are people in all groups that people can find to label others as that have offensive people... so try not to generalize so much.|`|2ogimlBxaa	No, atheism is the lack of belief in any deities. That's all it is.    I don't know who pissed in your post toasties, but I suggest you lighten up and get over it.|`|Fpi8im9taa	That's bordering on a strawman.    No atheist thinks that ridicule is okay. Where did you get that from?|`|HOYIAMi2aa	I only ridicule someone if they do something stupid worthy of ridicule.  Or if they annoy me.|`|TfWIcohcaa	It is ok to try to reverse ignorant and dangerous ideologies.  Do you know why Americans are dying in Iraq right now?    Theism.|`|oUNBdN87aa	"Isn't that the whole point and ultimate end game of atheism, to ridicule any belief in God or gods, so that no one feels comfortable, and feels so embarrassed by their beliefs that they become atheists, just like you."     No, that is not "the point" of atheism. There is no point to atheism. It isn't a belief, only the lack of one in God or Gods..|`|KktkViZ4aa	atheists wouldn't be atheist if they don't believe in god,|`|Om4oZd3Vaa	I know what you mean about all the angry atheists, but please don't group us all together.    Everyone's beliefs are different.  Just as different Christians have different views, atheists have different ideas.  We have one commonality that seems to smush us all together: we don't believe in God.    I'm browsing this section, just to see what people think, not to ridicule or flame theists.  I think religion is fascinating, I just don't believe it and it frustrates me when theists say that I'm going to burn in hell, or that science has no foundation.  That's where many atheists start to ridicule and criticize.    Just try to imagine someone telling you that the Earth is flat.  You try to explain that it is round.  But they insist that if you sail far enough, you're going to fall off and die.  Weird example, I know. XD    Anyways, I'm feeling (for lack of a better word) preachy, so I'm going stop now.  Thanks for the question. ^_^|`|7s8JILrVaa	Most atheists I know try to use science and logic, not ridicule to make their point. Indeed, one of the largest groups of atheists are secular humanists. Their main thrust is keeping the separation of church and state. However their core belief is a kind of live and let live etho. Ridicule isn't part of that plan. I can see why some come across as ridiculing. We atheists certainly find the idea of an all powerfull being silly in the extreme, but I think most of us are a more tollerant bunch than we have a reputation for.
12404275a6e62a47f2d36bd0fb0e6886aa	"Isn't it odd that we somehow taught ourselves, but apes today can't?"    I'm calling shenanigans (I've always wanted to say that!) on this  statement.    Read the following article  -- Inside Animal Minds -- and the captions to go along with the pics.    http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/0...    In it, you will learn of the bonobo Kanzi, who taught himself through careful observation how to communicate with humans. So strong is his desire to communicate that his vocalizations are thought to be rapidly spoken English. Linguists are currently studying his speech to see if this is what he is doing.    You will also read about Alex (RIP) an African Grey parrot with a penchant for making up his own words. For example, apples are "ban-erries," because they taste (to him) a bit like bananas and look like big cherries.    Look, I'll be the first to admit that, as far as science, evolution, culture, anthropology, etc. goes... I'm not the sharpest pencil in the box. I don't know how we learned to communicate as we do.    What I do know is this: *All* animals communicate with each other, through an instinctual  language and social gestures  that we are just now beginning to understand. I would assume that the same held true for early humans.|`|lsuVEx0Faa	If monkeys and Gorillas can learn something new, why can't you?  Escape your dogma prison and think for yourself.    Honestly, this question demonstrates ignorance of the world on so many levels.|`|37LKDbtsaa	Our teachers...    How was swords made? Man discovered melting and manipulation of metals.    A "tribe" of apes have been spotted with spear-like weapons.    Not bladed spears, but sticks. That's impressive for their specie.    Why don't you ask your biology teacher about evolution?|`|hiCSVwchaa	Your mom taught you.    But, not well.    Humans don't learn these things instinctively.  A human, raised in the wild, like a monkey, would not know language any better than a monkey.    Primates already have primitive communication skills.|`|7ylYxklsaa	We are teaching them a language we made up so they were supposed to know it beforehand?    Are you serious?    Like my little brother makes up a nonsense language and I'm a moron if I don't know how to speak it before he teaches me?    ** Dear lord, have some common sense. They speak to each other. Their vocal chords are not designed to have our full range of speech. They have their own language that THEY use with each other, that they teach their offspring. No human taught them how to communicate with their fellow gorilla.    *** Just so you know, it's childish, elemantary-level questions like this that give you and your brethren a poor image. I suggest you bump it up to high-school or college level if you don't want people laughing at you.     As it stands, I'd expect this from my little 4th grade cousins, not an adult. It's really sad that our education system has failed this badly or that the only way you can feel superior is to mock something because you can't challange it intelligently. Either way, sad.    **AND the Catholic church ACCEPTS evolution. Now I know you're a troll.|`|2zd9OjeMaa	We made it up. The other apes today also make stuff up (such as chimps making spears to hunt bush babies with) but we're much better at it then they are. It's much easier to teach a gorilla something we have made up than to expect them to create an entire language on their own and then teach it to us.|`|TzY9vkinaa	Gorillas aren't evolving because we teach them sign language.|`|KrTkyc9Faa	Not odd at all, if you believe in evolution...|`|WcxrnINvaa	Sign language is used for us to communicate with Chimps and visa versa, they can get along with their own forms of communication amongst themselves.    As for language, it probably developed slowly at first, then as sizes of families and tribes got bigger the need for more complex societies grew and so more complex language was needed.    Actually there were several other species of men around with highly developed brains, we out competed them to extinction.|`|xWi4ua0Iaa	The origins of Human Language are not instanteously built around a large vocabulary....gesturing and grunts were the initial modes of communication, much like an ape demonstrates in the wild...as evolution would point out, man's brain would have worked in a sort of see-sawing between the environmental adaptations necessary for a larger vocabulary and the minute changes (over hundreds of thousands of years) within the biology of the human brain to adjust to such a vocabulary.  It is true that as Mankind developed a larger vocabulary, his ability to produce more effective technologies within the world around him allowed for a faster growth of his societies (much faster than adaptation could keep up with nowadays), but there would be a point of saturation as Mankind HAD to adapt to His environment as opposed to Him adapting the environment to suit the needs of a larger Mankind.  The closest thing we would have nowadays to this process is the ability of some people to access a larger portion of their brain (say a better memory, or more stable emotional intelligence) than many other people.|`|XqpRYh52aa	Please stop.  I nearly peed with laughter at this one.|`|io7nHB3Oaa	Gorillas have rather complex preexisting language, and that language will vary from gorillas in one valley to the next. Language is a pretty obviously developed skill.|`|lkxFy681aa	We have adapted the first languages and comunication to suit our needs.|`|69750f25faea5e6021c54c23d0dcb774aa	Excuse me, but don't we also have to teach our children?|`|KJHt4hiYaa	Human beings taught each other through social interaction.  It isn't odd because apes don't have a highly developed pre frontal cortex like we do. We naturally exhibit complex behaviour patterns- other primates need to learn them through constant repetition. The key difference between man and other apes is a gene called ASPM that controls brain development. If you really want to understand this topic a short time spent studying websites about the ASPM gene will enlighten you.|`|py57svUyaa	isn't it odd that we somehow taught ourselves, but apes today can't? :)    you think that we learned to do this overnight? Why is it so darn difficult for you people to understand that evolution takes a loooooooooooooooooooooong time?  Apes today probably can, they may evolve to something else in a loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooon... time.|`|AA10137068	the you can't make something out of nothing doesn't hold up. cause....who made god        but hey, thanks for play'en|`|mNyhRGowaa	I bet they will say it came from the soup of the rock that we came from and combined with certain types of bananas we all of the sudden were able to read write and keep records of world history from thousands of years ago, after all the half monkey and half men somehow stopped appearing outside the (christian) universities all over the united states that are now a breeding ground for stupidity. They truly are a bunch of Rocks! Funny how our own laws are turning this great country into a bunch of well you know what ever you think.|`|N9VN9bwfaa	It is believed that people very slowly evolved language ability.  I doubt that you're really interested, but I wrote a book which is available on Amazon for the Kindle, entitled The Human Journey, which has several chapters devoted to a consideration of this topic.  Briefly, apes and humans share the capacity to develop mental symbols, to manipulate tools, to make tools, and to communicate with gesture and with vocal sounds.  Chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, and bonobos all share these abilities with humans.  So humans can teach these apes to use sign language at a rudimentary level about comparable to that of a child at the one-word stage -- that of a child one to one and a half years of age.    However humans have an inborn "Language Acquisition Device" or LAD as posited by the linguist Noam Chomsky which allows us to embed sequences in a fixed order within larger sequences.  This led ultimately to the development of complex syntax and thus to languages, whether vocal or sign.  Apes cannot master these.  This is a complicated subject which I cannot fully explore here.  Apes cannot fully master complex tool-making traditions either, such as hafted tools, but it is true that chimps in West Africa make simple spears, simple hammers, and simple devices for fishing termites and ants out of their hills and mounds.  If you should become interested in these things, I suggest you read the books by Jane Goodall, Diane Fossey, Birute Galdikas, and Frans De Waal.    The language instinct evolved in humans over the course of approximately two million years and at least three species of Homo: Homo erectus, Homo neanderthalensis, and Homo sapiens.  Only the third of these had fully developed language.|`|52246014c6731089215da64339f2d610aa	Who taught us how to make television???

And the sad thing is, she doesn't know what she's crying about... but i think its for attention.|`|1HfLkTrdaa	Yes. I'm nearly 48 years old... and I've been a lifelong cryer. Yes, I cry if I feel the need to, and I do it wherever and whenever I want to and if someone else doesn't like it, then I figure that's their problem, not mine. Yeah, as a young girl, I've gotten called a crybaby and was made to feel bad for it.  I even joined the Marines to try to control my "cry easily" temperment, but it didn't take ... I'm still a sentimental ole softy anyway lol...and over the years, I'd seen many a burly, tough Jarhead or sailor openly break down and cry (and not just at funerals, either. I've seen it at weddings...but usually after getting a "dear john" letter and also under the influence of alcohol but that's another story lol)...so I double dog dare anyone to call those guys whimps lol.    Truth of the matter is I've never understood this taboo against crying publicly...and I think it's wrong and unfair for people to be either bullied or judged because of it. Why do I feel this way? Because crying is a NORMAL human emotion, and shedding tears is nothing to be ashamed of. For the most part, it really doesn't hurt anyone else the way that other emotions like anger does.  People need to ask themselves why is it wrong to cry openly, but perfectly ok to yell or punch a wall?    The real problem with crying comes in from all the societal pressure for people to always keep a "stiff upper life" and to expect people to deny or stuff one's feelings all the time because of fear of what others will think of them.  In my opinion, if more people were allowed to cry freeling and have access to the full range of human emotions (within reasons), the world would be much better off. There's be less mental illness, fewer suicides and the assault and homicide rates would be a lot lower.    Tears are beneficial physical health wise, too. Scientists have shown by shedding tears the body releases toxins.    Also, there have been many times in history where publicly crying did not have a stigma for either women or men...and even some of the greatest people in history openly wept, including Jesus Christ (and that's factoid is documented in the Bible by the way)     If you want to know more about that aspect of displaying tears and society, then I recommend reading the 1999 book Crying: The Natural and Cultural History of Tears by Tom Lutz. I found that book really helped me understand a great deal about myself and the emotions involved in crying. Hence the reason I feel as strongly as I do about it :)    EDIT    I understand your feelings there, but it seems to me that idea of calling attention to onself is one of the things people misunderstand about crying. Seems to me that there's more attention drawn to self when a person is publicly intoxicated, or if they're "going postal" or they commit an act of workplace violence because of their inappropriately dealt with anger. They'd been better off  having a good ole honest cry than getting drunk or weilding a gun and mowing down others.|`|283tO9j9aa	Not if I can help it. I let my boyfriend and my mum see me cry, that's about it. I don't like people seeing what I perceive as a weakness (only in myself, not in others). Pretty sure it stems from being bullied as a kid, where things just got worse if people saw I was upset.    At a funeral, I would cry in public if I felt the need. I think that's the one place you're allowed!|`|4N3Z6fUfaa	erm ya|`|SBFs2Cheaa	sure. i did this morning|`|IuW9zgYcaa	I haven't ever cried in public i don't think..

Hfej50Uhaa	The Lord owns everything, and when tithing, keep in mind that you are giving back part of what he already has given you (and in fact, owns).  So all our financial spending should be under the guideline of: "Lord, it already all belongs to you anyway."    So, then when you do that, you are not limited by the tenth of all your income, or by questions of: gross income, net income, taxable income.  Instead, you gear your whole life to be in accordance with His will.  Financially I personally believe supporting a local church is the biggest part of that.  I also think Christian Education is a very important, so that as parents you work in a triangle with home, school, and church, all within the same principles of faith, and toward similar goals.  Supporting outreach activities etc. as well.  I think you'd be well over one-tenth.      Also, look at your other spending habits, and see if any of them would be diametrically opposed to God's will.  That would be a big indicator of a problem area, regardless of whether you are higher than one-tenth.    I hope this helps, and all the best!|`|AA10471892	Neither.    FYI: A tithe by definition is a tenth of the increase of produce and / or livestock, or what is made from produce, such as wine.    No one was ever commanded to tithe of wages.    And, you cannot give anything to God.  It is God who gave His Son as a ransom for us.  There is nothing you can ever do to repay that. God requires your faith, and not your money.
AA11225694	People have  stumbled into the stereotyping-humans pitfall, and it tends to have them beleive they are rushing toward the sharpened wooden sticks of truth .

Some boxes do seem to be true however. Women have less logic than men. This has been proven to be 100 percent true in over 49 world wide made up studies... thus the box is a good one.

So much of the appearance of the tower that we see today does date back to the Victorian period that it is quite appropriate that the ravens should be a Victorian legend."    An American author, Boria Sax, who has also been hunting down the ravens, has reached the same conclusion: the birds are eminent Victorians, not Ancient Britons.    However Dr Parnell has added another layer to the legend: his research suggests some ravens may have been a punning gift to the tower by the Earl of Dunraven, an archaeologist and antiquarian fascinated by Celtic raven myths, who added ravens to his family coat of arms, or by his son the Fourth Earl.    The tower was definitely raven-less by the second world war, when some were killed in bombing raids, and others understandably pined and died of shock. The myth was already so powerful however, that when the tower re-opened to the public, on January 1 1946, at the heart of the ruined City of London, somehow ravens had been obtained and were back in place.    Dr Parnell first became interested in the ravens story when working on an exhibition about the Tower menagerie, kept by generations of monarchs for at least 600 years until it became the foundation of London Zoo. There were hawks, lions, leopards, monkeys and even a polar bear - but ravens were conspicuously absent.    The full-blown version of the legend is that the ravens have been in the tower for centuries, possibly since Roman times. In the days of Charles II, his astronomer, John Flamsteed, complained that their chattering put him off his work, and the king ordered that they be destroyed - before being warned that dire luck would follow, for him and the tower. Instead he ordered that they should be fed and sheltered forever."    Read more here: http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2004/nov/15...  |`|AA12130542	None especially. There is a legend that says that if the ravens leave the Tower of London, then England will fall. Thats why theres a ravenmaster at the Tower.

Ravens have a place in the myths and legends of many ancient people and are linked to the Greek Goddess Hecate and the Norse God Odin as symbols of the underworld. The croaking of a raven is believe to represent the speech of the dead! During the Middle Ages the relationship of the raven was transferred to the witch and referred to as an example of a Witches Familiar. The raven is also mentioned in Celtic myths and legends and has been associated with raven goddess of Battle and Strife - Morrigan and the son of the Sea God called Bran Fendigaid (The name 'Bran' means Raven). And these myths and legends lead us to the  Tower of London.    The Legend of the Ravens in the Tower of London  The Legend of the Ravens in the Tower of London was instigated, in the main, to a Medieval chronicler called Geoffrey of Monmouth. The stories of many Welsh Celtic legends and Myths, and their authenticity, were raised by Geoffrey of Monmouth. In 1136 Geoffrey of Monmouth wrote a book called Historia Regum Britanniae - the History of the King's of Britain. In this book Geoffrey of Monmouth refers to an early British King called King Bran Hen of Bryneich (born c.485). The Welsh word for Raven is Bran. This ancient King of the Dark Ages was killed in a battle and requested that his head was buried, as a talisman against invasion, on Gwynfryn (the 'White Mount') where The Tower of London now stands. To this day ravens are accepted as highly important and necessary occupants of the Tower of London. Legend has it that should the ravens ever leave the Tower of London the White Tower will crumble and a great disaster shall befall England.    The Ravens in the Tower of London and King Charles II  King Charles II is believed to be the Monarch who decreed that at least six ravens should be kept at the Tower at all times to prevent disaster. The unconfirmed story of his involvement was prompted by a request from John Flamsteed (1646 - 1719), the 'astronomical observator'. The Royal Observatory was housed in the north eastern turret of the White Tower and John Flamsteed complained to King Charles II that the ravens were interfering with his observations. The King ordered their destruction but was told that if the ravens left the Tower of London that the great White Tower would fall and a terrible disaster would befall England. Not wanting to tempt fate by flouting ancient legend King Charles changed his mind and decreed that at least six ravens should be kept at the Tower at all times to prevent disaster.     |`|1739d37859293508b7cfc8e53ab0c413aa	charles2nd

KBBonf97aa	If you've always liked boys and just started having feelings for girls, odds are you're straight.  It's normal and common for girls to have attractions to other girls during adolescence that have nothing to do with what will ultimately become their sexual orientation.  It's just a product of the intense friendships girls form at that age and teenage hormones.    Television and movies have made it fashionable for girls to call themselves bisexual and "dabble" in relationships with other girls.  That actually makes life much harder for kids who are struggling to accept their genuine homosexuality.  For them, sexual identity isn't something they can wear for a while and then discard when it's no longer in style.  Very often, they're used by peers who want to satisfy their curiosity and test their own boundaries without the risk of being labeled gay.  Those kids think they're bisexual now, but if you attend your 10-year class reunion you'll find virtually all of them have grown up to be happily heterosexual (10% will be gay, statistically).    Don't stick yourself with a label, since the odds are huge it won't apply to you in a few years.  And it's a lot easier coming out of the closet than it is getting back in when you realize you've made a mistake.  I have a friend who announced she was bisexual at 15 because she had a crush on another girl.  By the time she entered college, she knew she was 100% straight.  But more than a decade later, there are still people who won't let her forget she made a stupid and very wrong decision when she was basically a confused kid.  And she's the first to admit she wouldn't have thought she was bisexual if it hadn't been considered cool to do so.    A lot of people who post answers will tell you to experiment with both boys and girls and see which is the most fun before making a decision.  But that's stupid, since sexual orientation has nothing to do with sex acts.  A gay man can have sex with a woman, but it doesn't make him straight any more than a lesbian becomes straight if she has sex with a man.  Sexual orientation is as innate to a person as eye color or musical talent.  You don't get to decide what it is.  When kids experiment, they usually wind up more confused than they were before.    Most girls your age go through what you're experiencing.  It's just normal hormonal activity that scares the hell out of kids and makes them question everything they've always assumed to be true about themselves.  But in the vast majority of cases, the same-sex attractions pass as quickly as they started.    Your sexual orientation will sort itself out over the next few years with no action required on your part.  Try not to overthink things, since you'll only make yourself crazy and still not find any answers.  But if you've always liked guys, you're probably straight.  Just be patient and in a few years, you'll know exactly who you're supposed to be.

Sn0CViR7aa	The name of the original Old Testament is the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Hebrew Torah and Tanakh.  The word septuaginta means "seventy" in Latin and derives from a tradition that seventy (or seventy-two) Jewish scholars translated the Pentateuch (Torah) from Hebrew into Greek for Ptolemy II Philadelphus, 285246 BC.      The Septuagint was used at the time of Christ by all scripture students, including Jesus. The New Testament makes a number of allusions to and may quote the books excluded from Protestant Bibles, including these deuterocanonical books:      * Tobit      * Judith      * Additions to Esther (Esther 10:4-16:24)      * Wisdom      * Sirach, also called Ben Sira or Ecclesiasticus      * Baruch, including the Letter of Jeremiah      * Additions to Daniel:            o Song of the Three Children (Daniel 3:24-90)            o Story of Susanna (Daniel 13, Septuagint prologue)            o The Idol Bel and the Dragon (Daniel 14, Septuagint epilogue)      * 1 Maccabees      * 2 Maccabees    Some of these books were deleted from the Jewish canon (Tanakh) by Jewish scholars after the destruction of the Temple in 70AD, probably because they supported Christian interpretations. For example, in Maccabees, people prayed for the dead.  Protestants uncomfortable with the ideas of the original Christians chose the Jewish canon over the Catholic Old Testament.    Cheers,  Bruce|`|QLDMmp6Taa	From the Greek Septuagint translated in stages between the 3rd and 1st centuries BC in Alexandria from the Hebrew Bible.  The original Septuagint had the Deuterocanonical books that the Protestants dropped. The reason for dropping the books appears to be because they were not known to have ever been written in Hebrew (which is why their authenticity was debated).  However, archaeological finds in the last century have provided a text of almost two-thirds of the book of Sirach, and fragments of other books have been found as well. The Septuagint was widely accepted and used by Greek-speaking Jews in the first century, even in the region of Roman Judea, and therefore naturally became the text most widely used by early Christians, who were predominantly Greek speaking.|`|RC5RAzykaa	All the books of the Bible existed as separate books before they were incorporated into the Bible as we know it today. This was done through the canon.  The Old Testament was a whole bunch of separate texts and scrolls before the canon put them all together. The same happened for the New Testament.    A Biblical canon or canon of scripture is a list or set of Biblical books considered to be authoritative as scripture by a particular religious community, generally in Judaism or Christianity. The term itself was first coined by Christians, but the idea is found in Jewish sources. The internal wording of the text can also be specified, for example: the Masoretic Text is the canonical text for Judaism, and the King James Version is the canonical text for the King-James-Only Movement, but this is not the general meaning of canon.    These lists, or canons, have been developed through debate and agreement by the religious authorities of those faiths. Believers consider these canonical books to be inspired by God or to express the authoritative history of the relationship between God and his people. Books excluded from a particular canon are considered non-canonical  however, many disputed books considered non-canonical or even apocryphal by some are considered Biblical apocrypha or Deuterocanonical or fully canonical, by others. There are differences between the Jewish and Christian canons, and between the canons of different Christian denominations. The differing criteria and processes of canonization dictate what the communities regard as the inspired books.    What this all means is that there are books left out of the Bible that might be of some value, but the Bible is sufficient in itself nonetheless.|`|a7fc3089d9e7ba174faf16c6aa239694aa	The masoretic text kept by the masorites.|`|AA11002471	The Old Testament is a compilation of 39 little books, written over a period of 1,000 years.  1500 B.C. till 500 B.C.

In 1947 the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered. Before this only the masoretic text existed. Other excavations at the site uncovered a fragment of EVERY O.T. book, except Ester.    Critics had poked at the masoretic text claiming they couldn't possibly be accurate. Yet when the two texts were compared, even there was a 1000 years between then, THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN MEANING BETWEEN THEM.    While one might say "He went to Israel' & the other said "He went UNTO Israel" the meaning was not changed.

The edition I recommend is the hardcover edition that has 2108 pages.   It has truly outstanding translation and history notes.  Other people have given good answers, so I won't repeat what they have said, except to say that if a Bible is not approved for Roman Catholics, it is probably an abridged version of The Bible.  The King James Version is abridged from the original Christian text.  I was disappointed today to find an online bible site that claims to have The New Jerusalem Bible online,  but actually is missing several books from the Bible.    That website is:  Biblebureau.com,  and what it displays as The New Jerusalem Bible does not have all of the books of The Bible.  I do not know why.  The New Jerusalem Bible has the appropriate Nihil Obstat and Imprimatur that indicate it is free from moral or doctrinal error.  The copy with 2108 pages in hardcover is available from Amazon for a little more than thirty dollars.      The New Jerusalem Bible is a translation into English directly from the oldest available ancient texts.  It was translated under the supervision of The Roman Catholic Church,  and it was done by some of the world's most outstanding translators.   It is very easy to read, and it is faithful to the original texts.      It is very important to keep in mind that The King James Version is missing several books of The Bible that were in The Bible for over 1200 years.  They were removed at the time of the protestant reformation.  In my opinion, the part of the Bible that is included in The King James Version is reliable, but it is an abridged Bible.     I think you will find The New Jerusalem Bible to be so well-translated that you will be inclined to read it more.  The copy I recommend with 2108 pages has such good translation and history notes that you likely  will come away with a better understanding of The Bible than you would be able to get from any other single volume.

The first five books (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy) were most likely written by Moses, except for the last chapter of Deuteronomy that tells about Moses' death.    The books of Joshua through Ester cover about 800 years of Israels' history and is a compilation of a series of books written by different authors.  It is not clear who all the authors were. Ezra is likely the author of the books of Ezra and Nehemiah.    The book of Psalms were written mostly by King David. The book of Proverbs were written by King Solomon, Agur, and Lemuel.

After Alexander the Great conquered most of the world, he brought the Greek language, and Hellenistic culture with him. After several centuries of Greek rule, the world spoke Greek as a second language. A succeeding Greek king ordered 70 Rabbis to translate their scriptures int Greek. The 70 finished their work, and the translations of each were nearly the same. The Septuagint was accepted and copied and became the sacred scripture for the Jews of the Greek speaking world.

The very first single-volume collections of Christian Scriptures were the Greek Codices, and they included the Greek Septuagint in whatever form it was available (note:  these early Greek codices included different Scriptures in their Old Testament *and* in their New).    If you mean:  what was used as the source of the first "official" bible, containing only approved Scriptures, here we are speaking of the sources for the Latin Vulgate.  Jerome translated primarily from original language texts - that is, Hebrew scrolls that were stored in Jerusalem.  Note:  the Masoretic Text did *not* exist at this time.  These Hebrew texts were not really part of any "bible" as far as we can determine.  The term "the bible" was first used to describe the Latin Vulgate.  For the Scriptures that he could not locate in Hebrew, he translated from the Greek Septuagint.  Finally, the remaining Scriptures - the ones not translated by Jerome personally - were "Old Latin" translations, probably translated into Latin from the Greek Septuagint.  Again, these were individual scrolls, not a "bible" such as we *might* consider the Greek Septuagint to be.    SO, primarily individual scrolls were used as a source for the first bible.    Jim, http://www.bible-reviews.com|`|IwlE0oFbaa	The early Church leaders determined the accurate books of the New Testament and added the Septuagint or the Old Testament Scriptures Jesus used and the early Church Fathers used. As Bruce mentioned, the Septuagint is so named because of the 70 Jewish translators who gave the Greek equivalent of their Scriptures (our current Old Testament) to their exiled Jewish brethren in Greek speaking regions.    After the reformation, about 200 years ago, some Protestant groups took out books to match the ones that the Jews removed.  Jews took them out because early Christians were using them to convert Jews to Christianity. I should think Catholics could use those missing books to convert non Catholic Christians also.     Some examples are:    ? Prayers for the dead (Tobit 12:12; 2 Maccabees 12:39-45)  ? Purgatory (Wisdom 3:1-7)  ? Intercession of saints in heaven (2 Maccabees 15:14)  ? Intercession of angels (Tobit 12:12-15)    Jews really didn't like this one, but why would reformers take this out by following the Jews?    Wisdom 2:12-20 Let us beset the just one, because he is obnoxious to us; he sets himself against our doings, Reproaches us for transgressions of the law and charges us with violations of our training. He professes to have knowledge of God and styles himself a child of the LORD. To us he is the censure of our thoughts; merely to see him is a hardship for us, Because his life is not like other men's, and different are his ways. He judges us debased; he holds aloof from our paths as from things impure. He calls blest the destiny of the just and boasts that God is his Father. Let us see whether his words be true; let us find out what will happen to him. For if the just one be the son of God, he will defend him and deliver him from the hand of his foes. With revilement and torture let us put him to the test that we may have proof of his gentleness and try his patience. Let us condemn him to a shameful death; for according to his own words, God will take care of him."      The oxymoron is that most Scripure Alone Christians are not playing with a full Bible.  How can they say they will go with Scripture alone?

Good Luck!?|`|QnH9QuQwaa	I have appealed almost every time (sometimes I can see why they did it or realize there's no hope).      I'm still steamed that an answer of mine was deleted and failed it's appeal.  Why?  At the end of my answer I called a troll a troll.  That troll's name was "OooIluvurpu**y".  He didn't get removed until a month later.   Hmmmm.|`|AA11297267	I just had a question removed last night.  I quoted official statements from the mormon church that clearly demonstrate that church officials lied and broke the law, and asked mormons how they felt about it.  I didn't get a single honest, thoughful answer from mormons -- all the mormons that answered simply denied the facts that their own church's statements showed.  Then one of them reported it and the question was removed.  Rather than appeal, I simply asked the Y!A folks what community guideline my question supposedly violated...the reply was that it was a "personal attack against another Y!A member."    Which makes no sense, since I didn't "attack" anyone, I just pointed out publicly-reported facts and asked how they felt about them.    The point is, Y!A will remove things if anybody complains, period.  Doesn't matter if the complaint is valid or has merit, they don't bother to read or check facts or anything else, if there's a complaint they delete.  So appealing won't do much good -- and "getting back" at the ones who reported it won't do any good at all.    The actions of those who report things like this speak louder than words anyway:  they can't face facts, so they'd rather pretend the facts don't exist and try to make them go away.    I just let it go :)      Peace.|`|AA10641825	Yeah I usually cry, why you ask?  But I recover.    I don't try to get back at them, no.

That way your question should not be deleted.  To the best of my understanding the only ones removed have to be reported by two or more other readers.

I've had a few answers that were reported, most of which were reinstated on appeal. So I guess my answer is that I'd appeal like I usually do. (And I'd probably get it reinstated.)
Iarvsn7yaa	Islam was given to the World by Muhammed. Before Muhammed, Islam didnt exist. How did Muhammed spread his religion? He told everyone that the angel of God talked to him, and that God talked to him. He incited his followers, the ignorant people who believed him, to kill those who were not willing to accept his faith.     The seige of Constantinople in Asia Minor which saw an entire nation changed from Christian to Muslim is well documented in history.    All these attacks by Islam in countries to spread its doctrine was the motive behind the crusades. Islam started it. It started a war on other religions. Coptic Christians suffered tremendously under islamic rule.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	NO, really you aren't asking... Aristotle would say you are committing the logical error of "Emphasis".

They need future generations (sex), and violence (threatening people with a hell, killing blasphemers, and insulting other religion) to hold their position as a strong religion.

They both have the same leader, however. One is called Antichrist and the other Destroyer, in two languages.    The first, Roman Christianity used the sword to eliminate Paganism and Aryan Christians. Thus, God raised up Islam to punish them; in fact, the Bible predicts those fallen nations, 1/3 of the Old Roman Empire, that will destroy Israel at the end  of the days:    "The Rise, Decline, and Death of Islam as Predicted in the Bible" at http://revelado.org/islam.htm    Really bad times are coming, but God has made provisions for His people.    Shalom, peace in Jesus, Ben Yeshua|`|bxYWJAYNaa	Islam and Christianity are probably neck and neck. Both were religions of war and conquest.    Islam was far more successful in this regard up until the C16th when the European kingdoms gained an edge with technology and expanded into Africa and the new world.    The other world religions don't have conversion as one of their main goals. Which is somewhat fortunate, since there were some pretty horrendous ones out there. Imagine if say, the religion of the Aztecs was now the dominant world religion, with its endless human sacrifices and mountains of decapitated heads!|`|VDrNhLMPaa	none of True ones.  i mean when Jesus was alive he didn't spread Christianity by violence nor sex ... but those who followed changed the bible and made many wars to spread the religion in a wrong way    Prophet Mohamed (pbuh) didn't spread Islam by violence nor sex!  and neither didn't do his followers, as when his followers spread islam in a new region .... some people accept it and others deny it, so for those who denies it, the didn't force them to accept, they leave them live freely and do ALL there religious steps ... Muslims never burnt a church nor a temple ... prophet Mohamed before wars used to tell the soldirs not to cut a tree , not to kill a child, woman nor an old man ... never burn any thing ... so he didn't use violence at all.

It might be also an agenda to create an image to people that gay people are doing a terrible thing.

I think when things like that put forth a great effort to pass a prop, they should know that people may not agree and may very well boycott.  However, I don't think that's fair to do to individuals who voted Yes.  And really, there is no way to know which individuals did vote yes unless they admit it, so that's kind of a non issue.|`|kc1IBYMRaa	A great idea!  A few of us a working on something like that here. We hope to "out" all local businesses who have not supported pro-gay legislation in our state.  I'm very careful to know everything I can about the people I do business with or give money to.      The lists should include pictures of the family, there home address and phone number.  Also the name and address of the schools their children attend.|`|WVPYem5Vaa	Right now, while I'm disappointed that prop 8 was passed, I've come to accept the fact that it was. The blacklist is a bad idea, no matter how disappointed you are or how unfair you may find it. It will just give others more incentives to go against gay rights, by pointing out that, if we're disappointed, we'd launch something like this.    Because people also donated money to blocking prop 8.    BTW, I'm a gay man myself. And I feel that we should keep fighting for our rights, but in a civilised manner; blacklisting is a bad idea, in my opinion.|`|asyQpgkHaa	I would've voted no also on prop 8 if I were in California, luckily CT has legalized gay marriage. I feel the government has no right to say who can or cannot marry whom.     it's hypocritical for religious people to say "marriage is a holy sanction between a man and a woman" if it's so "holy" and "sacred" why do 1 in 2 straight marriages end in divorce? why not let gay people share the misery of marriage? (lol)    but to chastise people for giving money towards something they believe in is wrong. it's doing the same thing that the gay&lesbian community are asking them not to do: punish them for wanting what they believe in.    people are so hypocritical! |`|Y7YC2FzZaa	Honestly it makes me trust the judgment of the gay community even less.   Its an act of terrorism and if any of the people they have named are attacked its those who created this list who should be prosecuted along side the other criminals.     How would it be perceived if I created a Black list of Gay activist?|`|5cQaECAkaa	I think it is no different than churches who distribute a list of companies, who the church feels, promote things the church doesn't.  For example, when I was a teenager, I attended a baptist church.  They gave out a list of companies, which included proctor and gamble and asked the congregation to not buy products made by those companies.  The reason they gave was the companies on the list supported things the church didn't (like gay rights etc.)   I don't see the blacklist as being any different.  If someone donates money to anything political, you can find a list of it on the web so I don't see what the big deal is.  I would have voted no to prop 8 if I lived in CA.|`|x44hYu28aa	The left just doesn't get it.......  Just like raping kids is against the law, so too should gay marriage.  "but raping kids is 'harming somebody unwilling', while gays are 'consenting adults'?  The point is, why is harming somebody unwilling not right? It is for the same reason gay marriage is not right.......society says BOTH are wrong. It was voted on and we as a society said keep your sickness to yourselves.  |`|hPfY3uYpaa	Boycotts work. And yes they are fair. Withholding of the all-mighty dollar is a way of saying that individuals and businesses have the right to freedom of speech and thought, but so do the consumers of their services.     According to Lisa Cozzens, "The Montgomery Bus Boycott officially started on December 1, 1955. That was the day when the blacks of Montgomery, Alabama, decided that they would boycott the city buses until they could sit anywhere they wanted, instead of being relegated to the back when a white boarded."   Cozzens goes on to say, "...some members of Montgomery's business community were becoming frustrated with the boycott, which was costing them thousands of dollars because blacks were less likely to shop in downtown stores."   http://www.watson.org/~lisa/blackhistory...|`|91acf4dec3b907fa1dddca164a816d32aa	Yes, it is fair.     Votes may be private, but virtually everybody knows that political donations are public record and regularly published on websites. Those who supported Prop. 8 told businesses that gave money to the state's largest gay rights group they would be publicly identified as opponents of traditional unions unless they also contributed to the gay marriage ban.    If a person is embarrassed about being a donor, they should have thought about that before giving their money.    I live in Kentucky, and there are 13 different donors (8 opposed to Prop 8 and 5 supporters) who contributed from my city alone. I would have voted against Prop. 8 if I were a Californian not only because I am gay, but because I do not believe in governmental discrimination.|`|Y6DUXDfdaa	I don't agree with that at all.  We vote for a reason and our votes are supposed to be anonymous.  Having said that, if you are aware of an organization that supported Prop 8 I think boycotts would be a good idea.|`|AA12165299	the people spoke...the intolerance for our system of government from the gay community only shows their intolerance of others who won't agree with them or sympathize them...this antigayblacklist.com is one of many examples of the intolerance of gays...|`|xbmvlO7iaa	Interesting question!

I have always said, gays should never fall in love, or have crushes on straight people. Because where we have made up in our mines we are coming out one day. Straight people are not thinking that way...so don't empty your heart out on them.    Its bad enough, what we are already going through, and  the added rejection of them. Don't do that to yourself.    You have made the right move by withdrawing. Find some gay people to hang around. Please leave straight people alone.

In other words, there is no way to test is.  People may believe that hell exists, but this is entirely a faith-based belief.  My advice would be to stay away from these kinds of beliefs.  Logic, reason, and evidence have been shown time and time again to be effective at distinguishing things that are likely to be true from those that are likely to be false.  Faith has no mechanism for separating true beliefs from false beliefs, so therefore it makes to sense to ask how you would know if hell is real in that context.|`|QepEDzEvaa	I believe in the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.

You'll never know until youre standing at the gates of either heaven or hell.     Basically what im trying to say is, hell is a horrible place.

It is not only good it is the superlative (and right) - for a homosexual who is comfortable in his or herself and who achieves all that he or she wants from life.    It is not so great (and wrong) for a heterosexual who is forcibly coerced into living a homosexual life.    But, to be honest, it doesn't do to be subjective about ethics and morality.  Just be happy with your lot and don't interfere in anyone else's - as long as they do no harm to you or each other. |`|klkSiZlKaa	homosexuality is awesome!!!    dude, what kind of question is that?  is homosexuality a good thing?  is sexuality a good thing?  is ejaculating a good thing?

I think everything has its good and its bad, Ying Yang...in the bad their is good and in the good there is bad...|`|FschQNeVaa	How did you arrive at believing it was wrong?    This article...  http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=bise...  ...by the Scientific American discusses bisexuality and homosexuality in species as a positive element to life. A natural and necessary aspect of reproduction.     Even the most conservative religions tend to have the ideology of not judging others, and loving other people. So even if you, hypothetically, believe it is immoral, that's for the higher power(s) to sort out. Not the individual (you).    Gay marriage has a lower divorce rate, and the couples have just as much ability to provide loving and stable homes for children (countless examples suggest this, meanwhile heterosexual couples are driving their teenaged kids to foster care in some states where they have laws allowing abandonment, and heterosexual mothers and fathers sexually abuse, emotionally abuse, and physically abuse their children all the time. Heck, sometimes they even microwave them. SERIOUSLY. So while I'd never say a homosexual person is a better parent, they certainly have a lower incident rate of abuse and like I said, broken homes. So statistically that could be better. Thus a "good thing".    Ultimately if you want to know more about it join a website or group devoted to gay rights. Learn about homosexuality and the reality of the people who are homosexual. I bet a lot of misconceptions go out the window and you find yourself far more educated and happier.

For example, I once had a patient who had jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco Bay, intending to kill himself, but somehow the way he landed only broke his back.  He lay in a convalescent hospital for 30 years afterward, thinking about that.  Another fell off a building from even higher than 5 stories, but was impaled on a flagpole, on his way down.  The fact that he was impaled caused irreparable damage to his spine, so he never walked again, but it slowed his fall, so that he survived.|`|AA11124885	Maybe, but you would probably be severely crippled.|`|XdtEEDf2aa	Yes, there is always a CHANCE.|`|b0o2yS0Baa	Nope, unless you landed on something really soft: maybe.|`|SH2ysn6faa	onli if u land on something soft like dat thing those actors use but if u aint got ntn 2 land on u dead

If you think Easter is (April 12) is far enough in advance for her, give her a nice bouquet of flowers for Easter (even if you don't normally celebrate) and on the card, tell her about the trip.  Or a nice box of chocolates!    I think that is so sweet!

I'd suprise her at least two weeks in advance so she has time to get anything she wants to take for the trip ready and not have to rush at it.    If it were me, I might suprise her in a place where a friend could be close by to (in hiding at first) be there to take pictures or even record her reaction.

If you're choosing plane, then thinking of a way to get her to the airport without being suspicious is going to be quite a challenge, if you don't have a plan. Second, have you made hotel reservations there yet? (Venice).  If not, you could probably get the staff in on the big surprise in helping you to make her trip a very special experience.

ovyz3Enyaa	In 2007, Guillermo vargas habacuc, supposedly an artist, grabbed an abandoned dog from the streets,and tied  him to an extremely short rope to the wall of an art gallery and left him there to die a slow death of hunger and thirst. In those days, the author of this horrendous cruelty as well as the visitors to the art gallery witnessed emotionless the agony of this poor animal. Until this animal died of inanition, surely after suffering though excruciating , absurd and  an incomprehensible death sentence.

I've never heard of a church(at least a highly-organized/widely distributed church) that wasn't raking in-it's all that freedom from taxes and tithes and donations that aren't used for charity, and (Catholic church) the "donated" estates of clergymen who never wed or had children because of a rule stating they could not, which was made in the first place to prevent them from wedding and fathering children who lay claim to any fortune/property amassed by said family.|`|qeeem2giaa	nobody wants to come to church everday|`|Fh2IGTpaaa	L Ron Hubbard of Scientology was a science fiction writer.

ed8e2883b996a3685d6359a821a2d765aa	I think 'love' is a word people use in place of what they really mean.    Some people stay together because of friendship, some for sex, some for financial support, some for domestic support, some to have children.

Joe's church are experts on chronology and ancestry and heraldry.  You or anyone can go to a Mormon Church to have your ancestry looked up.  The Arabs and kindred peoples were lost and God had to keep a promise he made to Abraham about Ishmael in Genesis. Islam has brought Arabs to Jesus the Messiah in whom they believe as the Messiah.  Muslims tend to be very righteous- no abortion, bars, girlie shows, no promiscuity, no adultery, put God first, modesty, no homosexuality, no insulting God, no idolatry, no pornography, no alcohol. Smoking is about their only vice. Also, they are forbidden suicide unless involved in war to protect themselves and their families and to get freedom.|`|5JQFCQCkaa	Yeah.

mrMkKFqNaa	Yes, while the JWs are correct about some doctrinal matters, they are woefully incorrect on others.  For example, the JWs twist the scriptures into knots as they try to explain their 607/1914 chronology and their 1919 appointment as the "faithful slave."    One of the answerers ("Uncle Thesis") claims to be a JW and uses the "God has always used an organization" canard.  It amazes me that people are able to say this with a straight face!    So, what organization did Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob belong to?  What organization did Job belong to?  What was God's organization from the end of the 1st century up to C.T. Russell?      If God wanted to have a "Christian Organization," why didn't he spell it out in the New Testament?  Why is the word "organization" not found in the scriptures?  Why do you have to twist a parable (Matt. 24:45-47) in order to find the idea of an organization in the Bible?    What a joke!    The whole concept of God needing an organization is just a self-serving doctrine invented by men in order to consolidate power over other men.  From the early Catholic Church all the way to the Jehovah's Witnesses, men have used this concept to their advantage.|`|zyxY4dbMaa	You are absolutely right. God condemns those who change his word. The Witnesses have a counterfeit form of christianity that is not even christian and should be avoided.|`|AA11002471	God has always had an organization on earth.  Others come to it.  Israel were his 'people' for 1500 years.  Non-Israelites who recognized that the true God was with Israel came to Jerusalem to worship.  They were called prosylytes.  Once God rejected Israel, the christian system became God's people.  Certain ones had authority to dispense interpretation.  At Acts 15:1,2 how was the issue of circumcision settled?  ".?.?.they arranged for Paul and Barnabas and some others of them to go up to the apostles and older men in Jerusalem regarding this dispute".  Why the apostles and older men of Jerusalem?  Because they directed matters ....with God's approval.  Today the pattern holds.  God has a people and certain ones are authorized to make decisions based on scripture.  Matthew 24:45 refers to them as a faithful steward.  You may not believe JWs are that organization, but such an arrangement is the way God proceeds.|`|QDFj9JPfaa	...Oye !  ...I can hardly wait to see the answers to this one !!!!|`|AA11008046	Hi wonderin,  Your last para has it all summed up, me thinks!  In the Bible the Apostle Peter is teaching about people twisting the scriptures and restating them to their own purpose(s).  Peter declare that these warning were also declared in all the epistles written by  Paul.  therefore I suggest when John the revelator wrote "..those who add to or take away anything from these writings (Bible) will have their place in hell fire..: (parenthesis mine) he was referring to ALL who do such a thing.  That would include Catholics for adding books between the Old and New testaments also I would think? and any others who twist the original to suit their needs.  Peter was teaching/writing about the maturity of the christian in view of the Day of the Lord.  You have to go back to the beginning of the chapter and read all the way down to get the complete thinking of Peter.  Uncle thesis has a wraped descriptive para that is "far out"|`|9Dq2176oaa	(2 Peter 3:16) speaking about these things as he does also in all [his] letters. In them, however, are some things hard to understand, which the untaught and unsteady are twisting, as [they do] also the rest of the Scriptures, to their own destruction17?YOU, therefore, beloved ones, having this advance knowledge, be on YOUR guard that YOU may not be led away with them by the error of the law-defying people and fall from YOUR own steadfastness. 18?No, but go on growing in the undeserved kindness and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him [be] the glory both now and to the day of eternity.    It was early in October 1946 that Nathan H.?Knorr, who was then the president of the Watch Tower Society, first proposed that the Society produce a fresh translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures. Actual work on the translation got under way on December 2, 1947. The complete text was carefully reviewed by the entire translation committee, all of them spirit-anointed Christians. Then, on September 3, 1949, Brother Knorr convened a joint meeting of the boards of directors of the Societys New York and Pennsylvania corporations. He announced to them that the New World Bible Translation Committee had completed work on a modern-language translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures and had turned it over to the Society for publication. This was a fresh translation from the original Greek.    Was there really need for another translation? Already at that time, the complete Bible had been published in 190 languages, and at least part of it had been translated into 928 additional languages and dialects. Jehovahs Witnesses have at various times used most of these translations. But the fact is that most of these were made by clergymen and missionaries of Christendoms religious sects, and to varying degrees their translations were influenced by the pagan philosophies and unscriptural traditions that their religious systems had inherited from the past as well as by the bias of higher criticism. Furthermore, older and more reliable Bible manuscripts were becoming available. The Greek language of the first century was becoming more clearly understood as a result of archaeological discoveries. Also, the languages into which translations are made undergo changes over the years.    Jehovahs Witnesses wanted a translation that embodied the benefits of the latest scholarship, one that was not colored by the creeds and traditions of Christendom, a literal translation that faithfully presented what is in the original writings and so could provide the basis for continued growth in knowledge of divine truth, a translation that would be clear and understandable to modern-day readers. The New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures, released in 1950, filled that needat least for that part of the Bible. As Jehovahs Witnesses began to use it, many were thrilled not simply because they found its modern-day language easier to read but because they realized that they were getting a clearer understanding of the sense of Gods inspired Word.    One of the outstanding features of this translation is its restoration of the divine name, the personal name of God, Jehovah, 237 times in the Christian Greek Scriptures. This was not the first translation to restore the name. But it may have been the first to do it consistently in the main text from Matthew through Revelation. An extensive discussion of this matter in the foreword showed the sound basis for what was done.    Thereafter, the Hebrew Scriptures were translated into English and were released progressively, in five separate volumes, beginning in 1953. As had been done with the Christian Greek Scriptures, care was exercised to convey as literally as possible what was in the original-language text. Special attention was given to making the renderings uniform, conveying accurately the action or state expressed in the verbs, and using simple language that would be readily understood by modern-day readers. Wherever the Tetragrammaton appeared in the Hebrew text, it was appropriately rendered as the personal name of God, instead of being replaced by some other term as had become common in many other translations. Appendix articles and footnotes in these volumes enabled careful students to examine the basis for the renderings used.    On March 13, 1960, the New World Bible Translation Committee completed its final reading of the text of the portion of the Bible that was designated for the fifth volume. That was 12 years, 3 months, and 11 days after actual translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures had begun. A few months later, that final volume of the Hebrew Scriptures, in printed form, was released for distribution.    Rather than disband after that project was completed, the translation committee continued to work. A comprehensive review of the entire translation was made. Then, the complete New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, a revised edition in one vol|`|AA10472482	You said "Since one cannot come to the same conclusions that Jehovah's Witnesses do regarding JW's doctrines and beliefs without reading the publication of the WTBTS, would it be something to consider that maybe they are the ones that are twisting the scriptures to their own destruction. Just as the Mormons, one can't get their beliefs without their extra books, and other religions too...WHen one reads the Bible alone..they come to a total different conclusion about the deity of God and Christ and the Holy Spirit."    Debbie is correct. Many others have come to the same conclusion as we  have, only thing is that they are not all one organization, but some in one group reach some of the same conclusions we do, and some in other groups reach other of the same conclusions we do.    Someone else made reference to the fact that the word "organization" is not in the Bible. However, the congregation is specifically likened to the organization found in the human body when it is called the "Body of Christ."    A city is also an organization, and is not the Christian Congregation also likened to Jerusalem? Jerusalem is a city, and what is a city but an organization of people in close proximity?|`|kqnaqakLaa	its called food from the faithful slave.    thank you for being so interested in us.    -have a nice day.|`|etICmXRiaa	This is a great point!

I collect all the non JW references and Bibles online that I can find and conduct studies exactly that way WITHOUT JWs material which is not respected anyway by many....    Debbie  debbiepittman@yahoo.com|`|aGRJ6MPdaa	One answerer said;    "...you CAN come to the same conclusions as JWs without using the NWT or JW publications......many who study history, Bibles and references of other churches DO."    If that is the case, then how do you know that one of these other churches isn't really the "faithful and discreet slave" instead of the JWs?     Having said that, I don't use JW literature anymore and have started over. Many trinitarians who are contact of mine can vouch for me. They have sent me tons of information on the trinity and we have written several lengthy emails back and forth on the subject. Yet, when I read the Bible (any translation), I do not come to the conclusion of a trinity. When I research the meanings of the Greek and Hebrew languages used to write the Bible, I do not conclude that God is a trinity. Nothing I do in my search for the REAL truth leads me to the trinity. Prayer, study, research- NOTHING!     Many have said that I'm not a Christian unless I believe in the trinity. To those persons I like to point to Mark 9:39-41 for starters.     JWs never stop to think that verses like 2 Peter 3:16-18 might possibly apply to their organization. They are trained right from the start to think that any such notion is coming from Satan himself! In fact, anything critical of their organization is to be viewed as coming from Satan or agents of Satan! The fact of the matter is that if anything is from Satan, it is the notion of suppressing our God- given thinking ability!|`|47181414a475aa26d8316adbb0d510d1aa	To determine who is twisting scriptures one has to ask what Peter believed.    If a person or organization teaches or believe something Peter doesn't then you can say they are twisting scripture.    Trinity:  What Peter had to say about it, or better yet what he didn't say about it.    1 Pet 1:3Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,       Peter believed in the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.  If you teach otherwise you are twisting scripture.    It is this God that resurrected Jesus from the dead, so then Jesus was truly dead, which God cannot die.    If you teach God died for us, then you are twisting scripture.    Peter taught that Jesus and his God and Father are two separate beings.    1 Pet 1:20For He was foreknown before the foundation of the world, but has appeared in these last times for the sake of you      21who through Him are believers in God, who raised Him from the dead and gave Him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God.     Peter teaches that it is through Jesus that we become believers in God.    Acts chapter 2 when speacking to the Jews, Peter did not mention the trinity,  Surely something this important should have been explained to these ones so they could be saved.  And yet Peter was silent on this subject.    Thus if you teach that you MUST believe in the trinity to be saved, you are twisting the scriptures.    In Acts 2:21 And it shall come to pass        That whoever calls on the name of the LORD        Shall be saved.    Please notice that Peter in quoting Joel, would have said "call on the name of Jehovah (LORD) to be saved.    If you are not teaching about Jehovah and his name, then you are twisting the scriptures.    --------------------------------------...    As to "only with the WT" I rarely quote the WT because it is so easy to find a non witness to verify a teaching.    Even Vines Bible dictionary will tell you the literal translation of John 1:1 is "a god was the Word".    The Catholic NAB bible at Jn 1:1 tells you that god(2) is NOT AN IDENTIFICATION but is a quality.  (caps by me)    Thus the Word has the qualities of God but is Not God.    .
XN0cYCATaa	After a Fashion However I might point out that a Christian who is not seeking the kingdom of God is not a Christian to begin with|`|yN3fWUCuaa	Nope.

It is from that security that we can not only move into the world with confidence, but also approach God himself.

But God gave each of us different talents to be put to use for His glory, just like each part of the body has a different function in the operation of the body. We cannot ALL do nothing but work at homeless shelters, but there are those that God has called to do that work. The rest of us have been called to be pastors, teachers, evangelists, healers, governments, miracles, prophets, interpretation of tongues, etc.  I believe all Christians should do their part to help the less fortunate; they should also tithe so that their money can go to help these and also to spread the Gospel around the world.|`|AA10401179	I disagree. It should read, "classify himself as an NON-believer as he is no different from an ATHEIST".    There are many well-meaning Christians who are not that old in faith to know about certain stuff. I think that there are many reasons why a person does not serve, so we shouldn't classify them as such. "The steps of a righteous man are directed by the Lord." Now if you were talking about a good deed, I believe all good deeds come from the Lord, whether atheist or not. But as to whether the "good deed" was motivated by a clear conscience or out of love, only God knows.|`|IqwGkk7daa	No, definitely not. Major disagree. That isn't what defines a Christian.

fTGMgTdvaa	Of course not. The human body (especially female) is the most beautiful, graceful form in all of nature. It deserves to be the subject of art.

Art and beauty are in the eye of the beholder.|`|3ZgOAUOTaa	no    the human body is a beautiful thing...    now, some poses are natural, other provocative, and some are just "come f*ck me"    just as clothing can to used to cover and be asexual, or it can be used to entice    the difference lies in a combination of the attitude of the model (as controlled by the photographer) and the viewer ... not in the presence or absence of clothing|`|FmazIF6Maa	There is nothing wrong with the unclothed human body, or even the human body looking sexy. Some pornography is more artistic than others, I agree. I don't think the line between the two is very clear and easy to distinguish, and I also think it is possible for pornography to have artistic value.     I think the difference has a lot to do with what the work is communicating. Is it's sole purpose is to sexually excite and arouse in a very blatant way, is it done crudely and without artistic vision? Even if blatantly sexual, does it communicate anything else and how does it measure up artistically/aesthetically?|`|JqHkgWROaa	Well if pornography is the picture of naked people.... then yes.

As where the general pornography field is not glorified or beautiful, but rather disrespectful the the body, defilement of the true capabilities of the bedroom, and often misrepresents the full potential of a woman. I personally think that pornography disrespects men, and women. Simply on the basis of intelligence. Which is one of the things that drew me to my husband.     Art, speaks. Mona Lisa is still be studied in schools because of that teeny tiny smile. Victorian portraits of plump beautiful women draped over their beds, speaks "seduction" not "stupid pizza girl". Beautiful men captured by the smooth form of a marble statue, glorifies manhood. And is has nothing to do with his package. But rather, his strong stance, chin up, shoulders back, tightened abs. He's stance screams "Respect".     Then there's porn: "Hey baby, did you order an extra greasy pizza?Oops, did i drop it all over you?!" This to me, disrespects men.     There are some pornography movies, that do not degrade men or women.|`|2JQQD4UPaa	NO.  There is a difference between "art" and "porn"....and I don't think Playboy is porn either.  Hugh Hefner takes artistic/tasteful pictures of women, not "spread eagle" pornographic photos lol.

AA11440601	Neither.    Hell is a free will choice to be separated from God forever.    Hell is the state of complete and final self-exclusion from communion with God and the blessed, reserved for those who refuse by their own free choice to believe and be converted from sin, even to the end of their lives     I like to think of it this way. The only way a person will go to hell is if they want to.    God in His (or Her) unlimited love has given us free will to choose. Our most important choice is to freely decide to accept or reject God's constant offer of spending eternity with Him in heaven. God will respect the choice to reject Him.    For more information, see the Catechism of the Catholic Church, sections 1033-1037: http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt1s...    With love in Christ.|`|imWxnK2saa	Everybody is following sinful men or women in this world. That is why the earth is being destroyed by all the things harmful to us that people think are good things. There is no more common sense left. You die in hell. The only way we can be saved is to follow a sinless man, Jesus, made form our beloved father God.|`|PdaUxZMjaa	Neither.  When we die we meet the God of Judgment.  Here on Earth we are in the palm of an all merciful Trinity, a God who only wants our love and is quick to forgive all our sins.  All we have to do is ask, sincerely ask.  When we daily shunt God to the side and die, the term of mercy ends.  But God does not judge us.  He does not say, "CrG! Go to Hell for all eternity!"  However, our soul, stripped of all that clouds our conscience, is totally aware of all our confessed sins, all our rejections of Jesus.  Thus, we condemn ourselves.  But, if we ask for Mercy even then, we may still receive it.|`|32xRsYa9aa	Hey Bruce,         I have never been able to reconcile the teaching that hell is a wicked place where those who occupy it are punished forever. This is not the God I worship. I am more inclined to believe, in fact, do believe, that hell is pure and simple, the absence of God.         I have pondered this many times over, and I keep coming back to the many times the Israelites turned from God, and each time, they were corrected, and each time they were forgiven. This to me is the character of God. Quick and stern where correction is needed, but all the while loving. I also remember that He corrects those He loves, so I am okay with His correction in my life, and there has been plenty.        I am pleased to finally find another with a similar opinion on the same subject, however, I think it important to try to view this, not from our perspective, but rather from His. We can say this and that, but the final decision belongs to Him. With that said, I will still agree with your position that hell is just eternity separated from God. Be well.|`|CmHLKKODaa	lost opportunity !    Weeping and Gnashing of teeth !|`|e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	You analogy is good, except it breaks down at the point of God's omnipotence and all-loving nature.    Even if you drove off a bridge, God could do any number of things to keep you from dying.  If a person dies and finds himself in hell, and at that point understands what he had rejected all his life, is God either not omnipotent enough or not loving enough to forgive him then?    I could not and would not believe in a deity that tells a person "Sorry, too late, buddy" if he ever repents of his sins.  That's not the God that Jesus came to tell us about.|`|93galWG1aa	as Christ will come to judge the living and the dead and hades will be before the throne to be judged, it seems sentence is not yet passed on these poor souls who by one reason or another lost their calling.  I think Purgatory is part of hell on some level and depending on the need are sent to be purified.  i would have great hope for them at any rate.  But i do believe there are people who reject good for the bad, they seek glory and power and Satan is willing to give it, the more they sink into evil the more they hate the light of God and become his enemy and the enemy of all people.  They will become like the demons, who rebelled after knowing his Love and glory.|`|LQQAQDkIaa	Good analogy. By rejecting God and His infinite love and mercy, you lose the opportunity to live in heaven forever, by your own actions you make an eternal mistake. That mistake is hell. Pax Christi|`|lNtwpzpOaa	I don't see it as punishment nor as a lost opportunity, but as a cause of one's decisions throughout one's life.    As C.S. Lewis said "Hell is a door locked...from the inside."     All who are in Hell have agreed to be placed there because they refused God's love and mercy. One Saint said, "If there were but one drop of contrition, Hell would be emptied."     Your analogy is good, but I don't see that as lost opportunity either, only a cause of one's actions.     Many people see Hell as a punishment for those who have sinned against God, but what many people don't see is Hell is also a sign of God's love. Would we love God as we do if we were forced to love Him? No, we wouldn't. And so because God loves us so much, He has set up a place for those who have rejected God's love without remorse.    I do believe that Hell isn't just "fire and brimstone" and thus eternal burning, it is also the complete loss of God's love. Here, on Earth, we feel His love (though filtered), but in Hell...there is nothing.

UH1ipgJmaa	Dinosaurs were carrying the Ark|`|XN0cYCATaa	While the word "dinosaur" is a relatively new word, there seems to be evidence in many places around the world that men and these creatures have co-existed.  In the Bible, when God is responding to Job, in Job 40 and 41, we see two creatures described, the 'behemoth' and the 'leviathan.'  Both are described as extremely large animals and seem reminiscent of descriptions of a dinosaur and a giant sea creature.  Although Bible notes in many modern translations suggest these animals might be a hippo, a crocodile, an elephant, or other known animals, the Biblical descriptions defy those identifications.   http://www.rae.org/pteroets.html        The Bible and Pterosaurs:  Archaeological and Linguistic Studies of Jurassic Animals that Lived Recently         The Chinese histories and legends abound with dinosaurs.  But they are not called "dinosaurs."  They are called "dragons."  The dragon is one of the twelve animals of the Chinese zodiac.  What is interesting is that all the other eleven are commonly known animals and there is no hint of 'mythology' involved with their identities.  It seems as if the dragon was just a commonly known at one time.  The pictures are often fantastical, but so are their stylized pictures of horses and other animals.  I checked the web for accessible information on this.  I was able to find a few things that were not having to do with video games, sculptures, movies, items for sale, and such.  The following links may be of interest.  There are more.  If you have access to books, you might want to check the epic of Beowulf, in which he battles a monster.  If you have access to a good book on the history of art, you may be able to see some dragons and sea monsters painted on ancient Roman pottery.   The legends abound all over the world.  They do not seem to be connected to each other, but each telling of its own place.  We have the story of St. George and the Dragon; there is the reference regarding Alexander the Great of his army disturbing some giant monster in a cave on their way to India.  The American Indian thunderbird may very well be one of the ancient flying reptiles.  An excellent essay by Lourella Rouster is "The Footprints of Dragons," at http://rae.org/dragons.html         A couple of pages which chronicle a bit the possible existence of monsters in Europe are dragon myths from Austria http://www.strangescience.net/stdino2.ht... page includes two paintings of dragons from the seventeenth century that are quite interesting!          Doug Sharp, whose webpage "Revolution Against Evolution" has Rouster's essay, also carries the following:   http://rae.org/tuba.html         The Rhamphorhynchoid Pterosaur --  Scaphognathus crassirostris: A "Living Fossil" Until the 17th Century   All in all, then, there is reason to doubt the evolutionist timeline that says dinosaurs -- or the dragons -- died out before man ever arrived.  There is simply too much evidence in stone, art, writing, and legend which contradicts that idea.|`|0tcpfav5aa	God teaching Noah language? This is incorrect because God is not a human being but  a Spirit and for Him to speak or teach He must come down to the level of Noah.

God lives  in the incorporeal world where there is no sound of a sort so for Him to speak He must come from the world of silence to the world of sound and by natural law have a human body with which to speak.

Can you lend me a hand?|`|246ef99fe9f19ae4da709934694ddcd8aa	Masturbation has been considered rude to do (or even talk about) in public in almost every civilization known to man.    The main problem is that such a strong emphasis has been put against it as a public taboo that it has gotten a reputation for being wrong or a sin to do at all (which it is not).    One of the few biblical references to masturbation has been used to scare children for millennia (into doing it in private).  Genesis 38:9 (38:1 thru 38:30 if you want the whole incest tale) tells the story of god killing a man because he refused to get his brother's widow pregnant.    There are however several real dangers in masturbations (not wrong, but be cautious).    Though some people believe being too lustful by itself is bad there is no direct link between that and "sin" or wrong. Unlike the uptight Christians, many cultures including the Jews celebrate sex when it is done between a husband and wife (even if it is for fun and not for procreation).    Targeting your lust on a real person can be a problem.    It can be de-humanizing to think of them as an object. This can also lead to an un-healthy or unrealistic obsession. Finally, it could, eventually, lead to an inability to have a relationship with a real man/woman.    If they belong to someone else (husband/wife BF/GF, what ever) that can be even worse. Coveting is wanting the exact thing someone else has.  You cannot have someone else's relationship! The best you can do is have one AS GOOD AS someone else's. (Even if you dated that same person, you will never have the exact same relationship they had with that other person).|`|AA11002471	Keep your hands off!|`|93fc57ca1c692acd2bd8f1bc7a446e6eaa	The general theme comes from the sin of Onan, the son of Judah, who refused to do his duty to take over the care and keeping of his dead brother's wife and give her children.  He instead spilled his sead on the ground and was struck dead for failing to perform his duty to his brother's wife.  In the New Testament, it speaks in a number of places about men being lovers of their own selves.  That can be interepreted to include masturbation along with general selfishness.  The sin is an afront to God because it mocks the purpose and function of the procreative powers of men and women.  It is God's design that we should learn to control the desires, passions and appetites of mortality within the boundaries established by God.  In the case of sexual gratification, it is to be within the bonds of matrimony, husband and wife.  We live a life of chastity before marriage and fidelity after marriage.  Sexual relations are between husband and wife and none else, including our own self gratification.  Indulging in self pleasuring leads to other lustful thoughts and desires and develops ungodly behaviors and attitudes.  Therefore, it is better to never go there in order to not develop a habit that you will eventually have to overcome and repent of.|`|EAuMJrs4aa	There was a young fellow named perkin  Who was always jerkin his gherkin  His father said perkin  Stop jerkin your gherkin  Your gherkins fer ferkin not jerkin|`|lkxFy681aa	According to the bible you shouldn't waste your seed.

How can one masturbate? By thinking of a woman and lusting after her. Normally we see a good looking woman and that is what makes us want to go masturbate. In turn, we have committed adultery with her.    What are we told about adultery?    Exodus 20:14  Thou shalt not commit adultery.    Deuteronomy 5:18  Neither shalt thou commit adultery.    Proverbs 6:32   But whoso committeth adultery with a woman   lacketh understanding:   he that doeth it   destroyeth his own soul.    Some say, oh but this is just an OT item. Is it really?    Matthew 5:27  Ye have heard that it was said   by them of old time,  Thou shalt not commit adultery:    Notice its even placed first in this listing.    Mark 10:19   Thou knowest the commandments,   Do not commit adultery,   Do not kill,   Do not steal,   Do not bear false witness,   Defraud not,   Honour thy father and mother.    And again listed as first.    Luke 18:20   Thou knowest the commandments,   Do not commit adultery,   Do not kill,   Do not steal,   Do not bear false witness,   Honour thy father and thy mother.    Galations 5:19-21  Now the works of the flesh are manifest,   which are these;   Adultery,   fornication,   uncleanness,  lasciviousness,  Idolatry,   witchcraft,   hatred,  variance,  emulations,   wrath,   strife,   seditions,   heresies,  Envyings,   murders,   drunkenness,   revellings,   and such like:   of the which I tell you before,   as I have also told you in time past,   that they which do such things   shall not inherit the kingdom of YHWH.|`|c6HfikOHaa	it depends where in the room it is when you kick off your satanic pleasure? :-)|`|fmIDB4ZFaa	The buybull states:    "Thou shalt pleasure thine own self."

tQsxsuNPaa	Ya know, when you are in school, writing and reading are a very important part of learning a language, right?    But if your only real interest is to be able to speak it, then your dyslexia shouldn't be a hurdle...all you need to do is tap into your ordinary learning strengths, which are probably about listening, using pictures, and memorizing, quite possibly better than the rest of us.    I suggest you find some of those sites/cds/etc, which teach you to listen and repeat, while showing pictures of the actions and things that you are hearing.  You'll probably do better at it than people who have no reading/spelling issues.      NO.  No one is EVER just plain out of luck!  I think, without the spelling issue, (and a new alphabet would SURELY mess you up!) You may find yourself right in the middle of where you want to be...what you have run across is the problem of spelling and reading.    That said, Spanish is easier to spell than many, so is Italian.  Russian has no articles, but does have gender, and Swedish (I haven't located a very good program, yet, as this is less in demand) has a more evolved (less to learn) grammar than most that I have come across.  One form per tense in verbs, and I haven't figured out for sure, but I don't think it's declined either...no noun forms.     Rosetta Stone, Livemocha.com and the bbc program are all set up that way.  Try that.  You may find it's tons easier than you think!

Almost all the Hebrew dietary laws can be traced to illness.|`|AA11008046	In the Muslim faith it is not permissable to eat pork.  the pig is considered an unclean animal.  This teaching come from the diet God gave to Moses.  It said you can eat of the animals that have a split hoof and chew their cud.  The pig has a split hoof but does not chew its cud.  Another point - when God talked about the fowl you could eat; a vulcher was not to be eaten because it other meat.  A hog will eat her own piglets.  This could be part of the reasoning god had in not declaring the pig as good to eat.  Modern religious folks say that is just Mosaic Law and we don't have to obey that any more.  well I ask of them when God said "..those who take away or add to these words will have their place in hell fire" does that not mean removal of the mosaic laws?  I don't eat a lot of pork because I find it hard to digest.  However, I feel the Muslims and the Jewish folks have it right.  Don't eat it at all.  My Muslim friend asks at the donut shop how the donuts are fried and if they were fried in lard he won't eat them; so I guess it is a very serious thing for them.|`|BfWxfFD5aa	eat pork|`|YMnTveWuaa	You die and get to be one of the virgins.|`|lkxFy681aa	No.      Muslims I have spoken to say pigs are dirty animals.

Without it we will surely perish."

Re: Put on the Full Armour (above): you're funny.  I checked out the vid on "Creationism in the 21st Century", and the first thing the "scientist" leads with is that he knows Evolution isn't right because of the saviour.  That's not really a scientific approach, you know... rather like saying Gravity can't be true because the elves told me so.|`|AA11120822	"Refusing to learn" is the foundation upon which Christianity is built. Simple-minded, primitive superstition like that can only survive in an atmosphere of ignorance and fear.|`|Qz4oYMlSaa	I know that evolution talks about changes in species over time.

Ever heard of him?|`|A9eJjoBTaa	Yeah, i read the bible twice and took a bible study class in college, and THEN is started to refute the bible.

Time is relative|`|urIm4YaBaa	People don't learn what they've already decided is false.     Consider, for example, Carl Sagan (and others) "faults" of astrology by faulting the assumptions behind horoscopes...when astrologers were always the first to denounce horoscopes (that doesn't mean that astrology is correct...it just means that faulting horoscopes is a poor way of trying to debunk the entire discipline). The scientists who do this don't actually go to any lengths to learn astrology; they just denounce it because they've already determined that it's false.    Creationists (not Christians in general) do the same thing: they assume that the parts of science that don't agree with the Bible must be wrong somehow, so they try to refute it before gaining an understanding.     I think that they have a desire to spread *correct* information while uncovering the "faults" about current scientific theory. Their hearts are in the right place, but they need to actually do some vigorous research to determine what's correct instead of just assuming that they have the truth. The situation is what I like to call "applied ignorance."|`|wywdxhBAaa	When has science ever been right?    Science has proven itself wrong every time a new discovery comes along.    Science said dinosaurs drag their tails.    And science was wrong.    Science said the sponge was the most primordial life form, and now we know it to be the jellyfish.    Science was wrong.    Science said the universe was accelerating in its expansion, and now we know it is slowing down.    Science was wrong.    Science said a giant black massive whole cannot exist in the universe, and now we know a giant black massive hole exists in the universe.    Science was wrong.    Science is ALWAYS WRONG.|`|AA11703455	To show the flaw in your trust in science, you are trusting imperfect men to come to conclusions, which are then sent for peer review. An article on the LHC's claims that they won't create a black hole that would destroy the earth, cited this fact about the process of conclusions reach and sent in for peer review.    Footnote 4: Between 1982 and 2002, 62% of retractions were due to unintentional errors rather than misconduct (Nath, Marcus et al. 2006).    So, only 38% were not retracted in a 20 year period. And this was with "hard" science, measurable and testable.    Evolution is neither testable or measurable, it is based on assumptions that "this happen then and that follows after this".     Even now, the theory that the dinos all died in one massive meteor hit, is being challenged by claims that other events happened not related to the hit in Mexico, but was over millions of years due to climate change.     I would rather trust someone who was on the scene (God and His Son)  who had a hand in the process and who understands it fully, than a bunch of men digging in the dirt, making guesses that change every decade.

The only difference is that they are probably more likely to use birth control, because Judaism in general does not have a major stigma about birth control the way much of Christianity seems to, and has no problem with sex education - learning for information's sake is almost never seen as dirty or encouraging bad behavior. "Abstinence only" sex education is not something most Jews believe in.      As far as religious Jewish teens go, it's a whole different story.  Orthodox Jews not only don't believe in having premarital sex, they don't allow casual physical contact between the sexes at all, other than family.  And when you don't hug or even hold hands, the odds of having sex become much less likely.  Some Orthodox teens do not even talk with members of the opposite sex (aside from immediate family) until they begin dating, and only date for the purpose of finding a spouse. In addition, according to Jewish law, sex is not allowed at all until the woman/girl has been to the mikvah (ritual bath), which in general do not accept unmarried women.  So there are some fairly large barriers in place that help keep religious teens abstinent by choice.       So while I wouldn't say that Orthodox Jewish teens are never sexually active, it is fairly rare in the most religiously observant communities.|`|4BQXYxPYaa	Theoretically, in judaism marriage between a man and woman is sacred and sex is only supposed to occur within the realm of marriage. However, the torah (essentially the old testament) does not explicitly speak against pre-marital sex.    Many rabbis feel that it implicitly forbids pre-marital sex by the term "sexual immorality" which IS a big sin even though what constitutes sexual immorality is not really elaborated on except in Leviticus.    Generally the stance is that though it's not explicitly mentioned, pre-marital sex constitutes sexual immorality and is not to be done. Some rabbis diverge from this somewhat and view the matter from more of a technical standpoint. You see, in judaism, a woman is spiritually unclean after her menstrual cycle and must submerge in a mikvah, which is a ritual bath before she can have physical relations with her husband. Some rabbis feel that in certain instances, when a couple is engaged or in a serious relationship where there is intent to commit to one another, then sex between them does not constitute sexual immorality HOWEVER the woman must use the mikvah, and being most single women do not do this, that is the reason why they would not be permitted to have sex.    These rabbis are in the minority, however they are on to something, in that, in an effort to prevent pre-marital sex in religious community, some rabbis feel that single women should be banned from the mikvah.    But these are religious issues and most jews are not religious.
AA11120822	Well, I'm of the opinion that pretty much any reality-based reason a person comes up with beats the crap out of devoting your life to imaginary deities and spirits.  Personally, I find that acquiring and sharing knowledge and experiencing as much as possible are the most noble and logical reasons for living. They're the only things that truly improve us and make us better human beings.  But we're all individuals, aren't we?

AaKZekyRaa	Beliefs do not deserve respect. People do.    You can demonstrate this by supporting their right to free speech and by correcting them instead of beating them down.

Anyone who doesn't want to participate in that process is immature.|`|ZfN4SSmDaa	Easy, don't judge them. Don't immediately say or even think that they are wrong.

However, there is an error. It ought to read "       ". In terms of how it ought to be pronounced, it should sound roughly like: "Bolshoy spassiba k zhiznyu katoruyu ana davala minye".

Islam doesn't require name change unless it is un-Islamic name.  A teen ager boy came with other Muslim boys in Masjid. Prophet SAW asked his name. He told his name  Abdul Shams.  Shams means Sun.  He had name from the people who worshipped Sun instead of Allah. Meaning of his name was Slave of Sun.  As far as I know, he was the only one whose name Prophet changed saying I change your name to be called Abdul Rahman, instead of Abdul Shams because Sun is not God and you can't be slave of SUN.

7lKJfwEdaa	Some women do, some don't. Some like it a little, some like it a lot. Some women like to have some kind of anal penetration, but not by a penis, rather by something that is smaller. I have also known women that they prefer anal sex to vaginal intercourse.    You just need to be open and honest with your partner, find out what they like and what they don't, and to be in agreement about what you both want, this is key. If you cannot be honest with each other, it is a relationship that is not going to work anyway.    It is one of those things that is a preference. Everybody is different concerning their sexual wants. As a man I don't mind performing anal sex on a woman, but it is something that I don't like a steady diet of. However, there are some men that is all they want.    You should take precautions as well, since you can get some nasty infection if the you aren't careful.

There is no longing in the atheist to know God but rather there exists the desire to suppress the truth of God.    Rom 3:10 As it is written: "There is no one righteous, not even one;   Rom 3:11 there is no one who understands, no one who seeks God.   Rom 3:12 All have turned away, they have together become worthless; there is no one who does good, not even one."      At times a person may be jealous of the confidence the Christian has.  I was once yelled at by a man in tears saying that he was "so jealous"  of me. That was 9 1/2 years ago and he is not a Christian today. As a good friend of mine said, the man obviously wasn't jealous enough.  It is God alone that seeks after man and it is man's responsibility to respond to the mercy of God and repent.  It is very hard for the atheist to believe that the Christian truly does love them and cares about their welfare.

AA12238560	Alot of Witches, myself included, follow the "eclectic" way.  Basically we don't follow any one specific pantheon.  You may like something from one pantheon and adapt it to your specific needs and then move on to find something else from a different pantheon, which you also incorporate into your spiritual needs.    Please remember that in Witchcraft there is "no right way" in which to practice.  You speak directly to the God & Goddess, the Lady & the Lord, of whomever you feel most comfortable with.    If you would like to "name" the Lady & the Lord, (I've done this myself), I refer to them as Jesus & Mary because coming from a Christian background, this is what I am most comfortable with (and can visualize).

Four years ago, while checking out in the grocery store, I said to the clerk, "Thanks and have a blessed evening." As he was handing me my receipt and change. He stopped and stared at me for a second. Then, this 18 year old boy said to me, "My parents never told me about Jesus."     At first, I didn't know what to believe. Was this guy serious? Yes, he was. He said that he'd never been to church and didn't know anyone religious. So I stayed and talked to him for a while. It was late and not many people were there.     Here I was, a relatively new Christian, telling this young man about God and Jesus Christ. He was so hungry for information. I never saw him again after that night. I don't know if he quit, was fired, or what happened to him. But I do know this much.     That kid was raised without any religion. He had no idea what was in the Bible until he spoke to me. The look on his face was that of wonderment and enlightenment. Was God touching his heart? Probably.     That's part of what being a Christian is all about. I was partly raised in church. As I got older I got away from it. It wasn't "cool". Boy was I stupid. From the time I stopped going to church to the time I accepted Christ back into my life. My life was a wreak.     I can honestly say that every single boyfriend beat the hell out of me. I've been thrown into walls head first, punched in the stomach and lost 2 babies, thrown onto the floor and kicked repeatedly, strangled, and a gun put to my head. I've had bruises on parts of my body that even I can't see.     But then God started tugging at my soul around Sept. 1, 1995. Because that's when I met my husband, who's never even raised his voice to me. We married Aug 2, 96' and were both Saved by God in October of 06'. That's how long God kept at us. He didn't give up on either one of us. My husband gave his heart to God one night, I had no idea he'd done it, and I did so the following night.     So, is it moral to raise a child with absolutely no religious upbringing? Due to my own experiences in life, I'd have to say, no. We are supposed to raise our children to be the way that we want them to be morally. "I wasn't raised properly."     Your children will grow up and do what they saw you doing. If they saw you [high] all the time. Your child will more than likely throw their life away too. If you're successful, chances are your children will be also. If you have religion in your life, chances are good that your children will also. However, they still have "free will". If they choose to go against it, so be it. It's up to them. Never force religion down a childs throat! They'll not only resent you, but they'll resent God.|`|56e0ac9f997cfe07a2c89aa1d28490daaa	To me, it is not immoral to raise children with absolutely no religious upbring...Children are being given ALL options by me as a father to them in their growing years for their experiences in the reality of their lives in the real world to sense, to feel and to live about their lives in the real world in relationship with other humans...  What are religions, after-all?  Religions are just laws to restricted our lives into the religious orders,,,  I do deprive my kids from religious knowledge even to the point of not bowing to History,   Who would have the right to tell me how I could bring up my children according to your perceptions?                                          thecode of codes in one way of life for betterment?  A code of codes to control our lives in the political enviroments?  What a parent who needs to do is teaching children a code of ethics in which human must support human in a humanly way.|`|p5F2LtmNaa	Because of what they don't know, or know about. Some people assume that they know of "religion" when the fact of the matter is that they don't! They wil call Christians hypocrites, when  they don't even know what exactly a hypocrite is. Hypocrisy is lying. Everyone has done it, everyone has lied before in one time or another.     Kids should not be deprived of any kind of such teachings! I myself was brought up in believing that there is a creator! when I was 24 years old, I became a Christian.      When I look at the majority of people that were deprived as kids, a good lot of them wound up in jail, or have some sociological problems later on in life.     EDIT: I guess I forgot that it is not up to us to force some to believe! The Bible does state that it is an individual's choice. It is up to the individual to make this decission in their life as they grow to understanding as when they reach maturity! I always believe what can be forced into a Church, can also  force themselves out when at a mature age!|`|FYjf7hkEaa	Why shovel a ton of crap into their heads. Let them find their own way.

Why wouldn't evolutionism be true? I've read your responses, and you've said it yourself - Genesis is a parable, that conveys religious truth. Not scientific or historical fact. As a fellow Catholic, especially one as liberal as yourself (no offense intended), you should have known this by now.  ______________________________________    The Bible is NOT a history textbook. It is a book that conveys religious truth. When reading the Bible, we need to take into account that it's collection of books are like a library - we cannot read each and every book in the same manner. For example, we would not read "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer" with the same attitude that we would read "A History of WWII". Same goes for the Bible. The majority of people's questions about the Bible would be resolved if people would take this thought into account upon their theological study.    The Bible did not just fall down from heaven already printed. It IS God's word, but God did not simply tell the authors what to write, who in turn copied it down on paper. God left the authors the free will to write His Word with elements pertaining to their own time period. So, of course, things that make sense to someone living in 3000 B.C. would not be logical when read by someone living in 2000 A.D. It is still God's Word, however. People just need to take into account that the Bible's scientific and historical elements were based on the knowledge from THAT time period - not ours! Therefore, we cannot assume the scientific and historical elements to be necessarily true!    For example, let's take the ages of some of the famous Old Testament figures. The Bible states that some of these people lived to be several hundred years old! However, we know that this is not possible. This misunderstanding most likely came from a gap in the calendar system between our times and theirs. We follow the Gregorian Calendar, which is a revised version of the Julian Calendar. The inventors of both of these calendars lived long after the Old Testament was written. Therefore, we KNOW that the calendar system used during the Old Testament wasn't the same as today. Thus, with the application of a little logic and reason, we know that the age of Old Testament figures was not actually several hundred years old on the scale of today's calendar system!    The Bible conveys religious truth. Not historical and/or scientific fact. If the Bible was meant for science and history, we'd use it in school classrooms!    By the way: I want to add that scientific evolutionism CAN coexist with theistic creationism. As long as God put the whole thing in motion (but allowed things to evolve from there), there would be no conflict between science and theology. Even the Big Bang Theory can make sense in the picture! Did you know that the Big Bang Theory was hypothesized by an ordained Catholic priest?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Lem...  ______________________________________    Natural selection is like this:    Ok, say you had 10,000 mosquitoes put into a room. Then you spray pesticide to kill them. However, out of the original 10,000, 200 of them survive. They survive because they have a gene defect that makes them immune to the pesticide used. Because these 200 are the only ones left, they will reproduce and repopulate the room with more mosquitoes. Each and every one of these mosquitoes will have the same special gene that makes them immune to the pesticide, since they inherited it from their parents, who passed on the gene. This means that if the pesticide was sprayed again, all the remaining mosquitoes and their offspring would be immune. This makes the species stronger, and more immune to environmental factors that would have otherwise killed them all.    That's where the saying "survival of the fittest" comes from. Only the organisms that are equipped to survive the best will survive. The weaker organisms will die off from various environmental factors. This makes the species as a whole stronger and more durable. That is what it means for a species to evolve.    Natural selection is not really something you can argue about. It's just something that HAPPENS, regardless of whether you want it to or not. Ignoring this fact is pure ignorance on your part.    Besides, how is acceptance of this an automatic conflict with belief in God? I'm Christian, but I am not blinded by my belief in God so much that I stubbornly refuse to accept this fact of life.|`|yywRjouyaa	LOL I can only answer this seriously (which means I need to go to bed)  But anyway with my dogs there are certain barks they have that tell me a lot.

ijDgKdcxaa	The King James Bible was written by men long after Jesus left this earth.  And religious law has nothing to do with it because this country is one that is separated by church and state.

Regardless of where the ceremony is held, anti-gay activists are against the government allowing gay unions in any form.|`|PvgZUzHjaa	What you have said is basically the argument the California Supreme Court made when it declared gay marriages to be legal.  The Prop 8 was actually a constitutional amendment to trump the Supreme Court.  However, it was not the right way to go about it, and will eventually be overturned.    BTW, there are many churches that are willing to perform gay marriages.  And there are many non-Christian entities that are also willing.  The Ethical Society does, for example.|`|nCjkx8qPaa	Separation of church and state was put into place so that the GOVERNMENT could not control the church or impose undue taxes upon the church or it's congregation.

Homosexuality, including their marriages:  GOD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah for these very same sins.  Therefore it should not be tolerated for any reason.

AA11440601	There is talking to the living Saints in heaven, our beloved family and friends and there is claiming that the dead are talking to you. These are very different things.    Before Jesus Christ died for our sins and opened the gates of heaven there were no saints in heaven. Therefore there are no Old Testament writings that would mention them.    Very few of the new Christians died before most of the New Testament was written. Therefore there is little in the Bible about asking saints to pray for us.     However the last book of the Bible does talk about the saints in heaven praying.     Revelation 5:8: Each of the elders held a harp and gold bowls filled with incense, which are the prayers of the holy ones.     Revelation 8:3-4: He was given a great quantity of incense to offer, along with the prayers of all the holy ones, on the gold altar that was before the throne. The smoke of the incense along with the prayers of the holy ones went up before God from the hand of the angel.     The Holy Spirit guided the early Church in many things not explained in the Bible including how does the Body of Christ (believers) living on Earth relate to the Body of Christ (saints)  living in heaven. We are still one Body.    Catholics share the belief in the Communion of Saints with many other Christians, including the Eastern Orthodox, Anglican, Episcopal, and Methodist Churches.    The Communion of Saints is the belief where all saints are intimately related in the Body of Christ, a family. When you die and go to heaven, you do not leave this family.    Everyone in heaven or on their way to heaven are saints, you, me, my deceased grandmother, Mary the mother of Jesus, Mother Teresa and Pope John Paul II.     As part of this family, you may ask your family and friends living here on earth to pray for you. Or, you may also ask the Blessed Virgin Mary, Saint Andrew, or your deceased grandmother living in heaven to pray for you.    Prayer to saints in heaven is simple communication, not worship.    Asking others to pray for you whether your loved ones on Earth or your loved ones in heaven is always optional.    And I have not even began to discuss saints as role models who said "Yes!" to God.    For more information, see the Catechism of the Catholic Church, section 946 and following: http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt1s...    With love in Christ.|`|AA10192697	The Catholic Church teaches that ghosts don't exist. If you have the experience of this stuff, it's due to evil spirits.    Saints are people that are already in Heaven and God can allow them to speak to people, which is very rare. But we, the living, can pray to them, asking them for intercession.  That's why we also pray to Mary, the Mother of God (Jesus' earthly mother).  These people aren't in hell nor purgatory. The Church has rules that it follows before it can declare a person to be a saint. I don't know them all but it's something like that dead person had lived a holy life, was martyred, etc. and 2 or 3 miracles had occurred after a person(s) had prayed to them.  It is said that when prayed to and a miracle happens, it's a sign that that person is with God in Heaven and it's by the grace of God that that person can help answer your prayer.  There's much more to it, though.    Saints aren't dead people, they are living souls in Heaven.  Ghosts are considered to be souls trapped on earth, and the Catholic Church teaches this is false because souls go to either hell, purgatory or Heaven.      I see it's hard to understand and/or belief.  I'm Catholic but I believe that ghosts or spirits of dead people are on earth.  I have experienced ghosts or something 3 times during my life.  If it's not ghosts, it's either demons or my mind playing tricks on me.  I'll find out for wure after I die and God tells me what's what.    Good question!|`|AA12346187	the bible says  not  but the catholic church has always  encouraged  it  as a christian I would  say its a definite no.|`|0312ec6bd9788b0c6bf89b026c84d0c6aa	The fact that we are both spirit and flesh seems to confuse people whenever it comes to death and praying for the dead, it should be remembered that although the flesh dies and withers away the spirit lives on and goes back to God.  It is in our spirit form that we most resemble the Angels who cannot be said to be dead simply because they do not have a flesh nature!  Jesus is Lord of the living and promised us life to the full so it follows that we enter into a new life while we await the resurrection of the body.  To pray to Mary and the Saints in heaven is not communicating with the dead but with the fully alive, however the danger in other forms of communication are very real such as Necromancy and calling up unknown spirits and this is always wrong and against Gods law.  God bless.|`|h5q89E3Haa	Because the New Testament tells us too.    1Pe 3:19 in which also He went and made proclamation to the spirits {now} in prison,      ~~~ "Spirits" in Prison, Spirits have no body~~~     1Pe 4:6 For the gospel has for this purpose been preached even to those who are dead, that though they are judged in the flesh as men, they may live in the spirit according to {the} {will of} God.      ~~~Here we are told to preach the Gospel to those who are now dead~~~    Rev 6:9 When the Lamb broke the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God, and because of the testimony which they had maintained;      ~~~Self explanatory~~~    Rev 8:4 And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up before God out of the angel's hand.      ~~~Why we pray to the Saints~~~    Peace be with you.|`|jard50Yiaa	Here is a site specifically for Catholic Christians... you may find more answers here...    http://christianforums.com/forumdisplay....|`|Icwz678Qaa	No, we are Not allowed to communicate with the dead!    And contrary to what the Roman church teaches, Mary is dead and is entombed and waiting just as all the dead for the coming of the Messiah to retrieve His Church - (Not the Roman church).    The Saints that are dead cannot answer any prayers or hear or anything, because they are dead.    Ecclesiastes 9:5-6 - The living at least know they will die, but the dead know nothing. They have no further reward, nor are they remembered.  Whatever they did in their lifetime  loving, hating, envying  is all long gone. They no longer have a part in anything here on earth.  ___________    Nowhere in ANY Scripture are any of us told that the dead are residing in Heaven.  This is a false teaching reminiscent of the Roman church's ancient Pagan worship system.    There has been only One person that lived upon the earth, died and was Resurrected to Heaven and it was not Mary, nor was it the Saints, but the Messiah ONLY.    John 3:13 - No one has ascended into heaven, but he who descended out of heaven, the Son of Man, who is in heaven.     The Almighty does not condone prayers to the dead or any type of communication to the dead - He wants us to rely upon Him, not seek help from the dead.    Isaiah 8:19 - So why are you trying to find out the future by consulting mediums and psychics? Do not listen to their whisperings and mutterings. Can the living find out the future from the dead? Why not ask your God?   ____________    The Roman church claims that they get her authority to pray to the Saints as well as Mary from Revelation 8:4     "The smoke of the incense, mixed with the prayers of the saints, ascended up to God from the altar where the angel had poured them out".     But John's book of Revelation doesn't say "WHEN" the Saints said their prayers to the Almighty God.  Nor does this Scripture state in ANY way that we are to pray to the Saints or to Mary whether dead or alive.    Yes, we are told to "pray for one another"  as well as to confess our sins to each other (NOT TO A PRIEST) so that we may be healed. The earnest prayer of a righteous person has great power and wonderful results (James 5:16). But this message is for the LIVING, not the DEAD.    My question to the Roman church is; Why would the Almighty God send His beloved Son to earth to suffer at the hands of the ROMANS, be rejected by His own people, crucified, die and Resurrected all so that we could by-pass Him and pray to Mary and the Saints???    Doesn't make any sense does it?    MESSIAH, Yeshua is the ONLY Way to be heard by the Almighty God!      John 14:6 - Yeshua told him, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one can come to the Father except THROUGH ME.    We can all read this for ourselves that we do not need Yeshua's Mother or the Saints in order to come to the Father, we only need the Son.    Be Blessed:-)|`|bxYWJAYNaa	No.    Saints are Catholic saints, and the Church acts as an intermediary.    Evil spirits are supposed to impersonate the dead, which is why people should not try to communicate with them because they will be led astray.|`|FGcwxZz0aa	Communication with the dead is necromancy and is forbidden by the Church. Saints are not dead but are very much alive.    It is disingenuous to state tht the practice of praying for each other has no biblical foundation, we are instructed in Scripture to have a prayer life for others as it is part of Gods commandment to love one another.     (2Co 5:8 DRB) But we are confident and have a good will to be absent rather from the body and to be present with the Lord.    The Catholic Church does not teach that it is absolutely necessary for one to ask for the intercession of saints for salvation. The Church does teach that prayer to God is necessary for salvation for all believers. For a Catholic it would be wrong to ignore the liturgical worship offered to God at feast days for the saints and the prayers asking for their intercession.    The Communion of Saints is a dogma of the ancient Church and is recorded in the apostles Creed. It simply states that the faithful because of their relationship with Christ are alive even after the death of their flesh and worship with us. To us the Church is made up of the Church militant who represents all those believers living out their hope in the flesh.    (Phi 2:12 DRB) Wherefore, my dearly beloved, (as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only but much more now in my absence) with fear and trembling work out your salvation.    (Phi 2:13 DRB) For it is God who worketh in you, both to will and to accomplish, according to his good will.    It consists of the Church Suffering who are those who are temporarily in need of further purgation from sin so that they may enjoy the presence of God.    (2Ma 12:46 DRB) It is therefore a holy and wholesome thought to pray for the dead, that they may be loosed from sins.    Lastly, the Communion of the Saints consists of those who have won the race:    (Phi 3:14 DRB) I press towards the mark, to the prize of the supernal vocation of God in Christ Jesus.    Their immortal souls are in heaven in Gods presence:    (Rev 5:8 DRB) And when he had opened the book, the four living creatures and the four and twenty ancients fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints.    The universal stream connecting all of Gods creation is His love, which we take on in our baptism into our journey towards sanctification. This is not an emotional but a desire placed in us by the Spirit of God that endures as a desire for those other than ourselves and this love extends even to our enemies. This is truly a love that comes only from God and is a foreign concept and nonsense to those who have not received Gods salvific grace. This desire within our souls does not end with the death of our flesh but continues into eternity where the saints through their intercession in prayer encourage us in our race and assist us to endure unto our union with God.    I think that some people of faith, who do not understand the Communion of Saints, somehow believe that asking saints to pray for us is detracting from our love or our trust in God. In truth it is impossible, if we truly love as God commands and has given us the grace to understand, not to pray to those whom we love and in turn we expect them to return that same love to us by praying for us and presenting our prayers to God.

Apparently, she's forgetting that sperm is quite necessary for conception, thus making the male just as responsible for a pregnancy as a women. However, with her logic, no, men shouldn't have to pay child support, as "a woman is ultimately responsible for not getting pregnant."

A man can be trapped into 18 years of child support but the woman can opt out of it for any reason, economic ones foremost on the list ("I can't afford a child").    Now if you give the man (single men) a window to opt out, let;s say the first trimester ( not so for married guys) and he does't opt out, of course he should be forced to pay child support.

They wont have to be forced if they except the responsibility of helping be a father to the child.  If they are really men as the say they are they will help out in the situation.  Many MEN as they claim to be are really immature when it comes to pregnancy and its the woman who is forced to take up both roles and be the adult in the situation because the men they are pregnant for are immature which isnt there fault (the women i mean).

And it is their right as a child to call on both of these parents for support.    I think sometimes people get lost in blaming the woman or the man for the pregnancy.

In truth an accidental child has to suffer the mistakes of his/her parents.

aO4iCwtoaa	1 - Dogma gives answers.  Religion itself leads to many questions, both about scriptures that don't always make sense and about crucial issues such as repentance and salvation.  A religion with established dogma on thhose issues can answer those questions better (or more consistently, anyway) than someone making it up on his or her own.    2 - Structure.  When a religion requires rituals, dogma can make sense of the ways and reasons behind performing them.  This ties together a set of practices in an organized way, so that they can enhance a religious person's life rather than clutter it.    3 - Consolidation of power.  When a religion has very rigid dogma, or convoluted rules and reasons, they can take advantage of religious people's need for knowledge by requiring them to go through priests or other Church personnel in order to live their lives "correctly" (only using Christian terms here as shorthand - this can apply to most organized religions).  This makes church leadership extremely powerful - unlike the previous two, it is a benefit to the religion itself, but not to individual religious believers.|`|vnEdfxeVaa	I'm not sure if this will answer your Q or not     1- One God >> No confusion , simple and makes sense .    2- Omniscience , omnipotent and omnipresent God >> We put our trust in Him for having these attributes .    3- Heaven and hell >> Punishment and reward , the promise of heaven has great effect on many people , the waring of hell has also effect on some people .    4- Everything is under the will of God >> No sorrow or regrets for anything that happens , happened and will happen .

r1ud6YBuaa	I have the same problem all too often... you get tense, and then it feels like any conversation you're having is contrived because you think about it too much? well, that's how i feel anyway. A thing that helps me sometimes, if I'm speaking to someone and i feel i'm nervous, or not giving them full attention, i try to clear my mind by practicing meditation, or meditation principles, such as acknowledging your worries and mentally discarding them. I like to picture a tree, on whose branches i hang up my worries. Sometimes visualising the surroundings of the tree (or wherever/whatever you choose) helps greatly to clear the mind.  Also, although we may not realise, stress or anxiety brings on shallower breathing, leading to a lack of oxygen, and thinking power.

7608d8bbef666e373ac9050db58b0ce9aa	(1) Yahya related to me from Malik from Abu'n Nadr, the mawla of Abdullah ibn Ubaydullah, from Sulayman ibn Yasar from alMiqdad ibn al-Aswad that Ali ibn Abi Talib told him to ask the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, what a man should do, who, when close to his wife, had a flow of prostatic fluid. Ali explained that the daughter of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was living with him then and he was too shy to ask for himself. Al-Miqdad said, "I asked the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, about it, and he said, 'When you find that, wash your genitals with water and do wudu as for prayer.' "  (Book 2, Hadith 2.14.55)    (2) Yahya related to me from Malik from Zayd ibn Aslam from his father that Jundub, the mawla of Abdullah ibn Ayyash, said, "I asked Abdullah ibn Umar about prostatic fluid and he said, 'When you find it, wash your genitals and do wudu as for prayer.' "  (Book 2, Hadith 2.14.57).  (3) Narrated Al-Miqdad ibn al-Aswad: Ali ibn AbuTalib commanded him to ask the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) what a man should do when he wants to have intercourse with his wife and the prostatic fluid comes out (at this moment). (He said): I am ashamed of consulting him because of the position of his daughter. Al-Miqdad said: I asked the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) about it. He said: When any of you finds, he should wash his private part, and perform ablution as he does for prayer.  (Book  1, Hadith  0207)    (4) Narrated Sahl ibn Hunayf: I felt greatly distressed by the frequent flowing of prostatic fluid. For this reason I used to take a bath very often. I asked the apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) about this. He replied: Ablution will be sufficient for you because of this. I asked: Apostle of Allah, what should I do if it smears my clothes. He replied: It is sufficient if you take a handful of water and sprinkle it on your clothe when you find it has smeared it.  (Book 1, Hadith 0210)    (5) Narrated Abdullah ibn Sa'd al-Ansari: I asked the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) as to what makes it necessary to take a bath and about the (prostatic) fluid that flows after taking a bath. He replied: that is called madhi (prostatic fluid). It flows from every male. You should wash your private parts and testicles because of it and perform ablution as you do for prayer.  (Book 1, Hadith 0211).    Here is the ruling (fatwa) of the scholars regarding semen, madhi:-  When maniy is emitted, a person must perform ghusl to clean himself from sexual impurity (janaabah), whether this happened during intercourse or otherwise, whether he was awake or it happened because of an erotic dream. Madhiy, on the other hand, means that a person only needs to do wudoo. The evidence for this is the report of Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: I was a man who used to experience a lot of urethral discharge, so I told Miqdaad to ask the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about it. So he asked him, and he said: It requires wudoo. (Agreed upon; this version was narrated by al-Bukhaari). Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni (1/168), Ibn al-Mundhir said: The scholars agree that passing stools or urine, the emission of madhiy or passing wind are all things that invalidate tahaarah (purity) [i.e. they mean that wudoo must be renewed].     The third difference: whether they are taahir (pure) or naajis (impure)    Maniy is taahir according to the most correct opinion among the scholars. The evidence for this is the report of Aaishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) who said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to wash the maniy (from his clothes) then go out to pray wearing the same clothes, and I could see the spot where he had washed it. (Agreed upon). According to a report narrated by Muslim: I used to rub it (semen) thoroughly from the garment of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), then he would pray in it. According to another version: I would scratch it from his garment with my nail when it had become dry. It is proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to leave it without washing it when it was wet; it was sufficient just to wipe it with ood (a kind of aromatic wood) or something similar, as was reported by Imaam Ahmad in his Musnad (6/243) from Aaishah (may Allaah be pleased with her), who said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to remove maniy from his garment with a twig of adhkhar (a kind of tree), then pray in that garment, and he would rub it from his garment once it was dry, and would pray in the same garment. Ibn Khuzaymah reported it in his Saheeh, and Shaykh al-Albaani classed it as hasan in al-Irwa (1/197).    Madhiy (urethral discharge) is naajis (impure), because of the hadeeth of Ali quoted above, in some versions of which it is reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded him to wash his penis and testicles and do wudoo, as was reported by Abu Awaanah in al-Mustakhraj. Ibn Hajar said in al-Talkhees: There is nothing at fault in this isnaad. So madhiy is naajis and the penis and testicles must be washed, as it nullifies tahaarah.|`|mOWyzwubaa	4:43 O you who acknowledge, do not come near the contact prayer while you are drunk, until you know what you are saying.

I have tried to find out more than once, but no one gave me a precise answer. Now I am dealing with all discharges as if they are regular and do not require ghusl, and I only do ghusl after intercourse.   I hope that you can explain the difference between them.     Praise be to Allaah.   What comes out of a woman may be maniy, madhiy or regular discharge, which is called moisture. Each of these has its own characteristics and rulings that apply to it.   1  With regard to maniy:   1. It is thin and yellow. This is the description that is narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): The water of the man is thick and white, and the water of the woman is thin and yellow. Narrated by Muslim (311).  It may be white for some women.   2. It smells like pollen, and the smell of pollen is similar to the smell of dough.   3. There is pleasure when it is emitted, and desire ceases immediately after it is emitted.   It is not stipulated that all three characteristics appear at once, rather one is sufficient for the ruling on maniy to apply. This was stated by al-Nawawi in al-Majmoo (2/141).   With regard to madhiy:   It is white and thin, and is emitted when feeling desire either when thinking or otherwise, but no pleasure is felt when it is emitted, and desire does not cease when it is emitted.   With regard to moisture:   This is the discharge that comes from the uterus; it is clear and a woman may not notice it. Women vary in the amount they emit.   With regard to the differences with regard to rulings between these three things (maniy, madhiy and moisture):   Maniy is taahir (pure) and it is not essential to wash it from ones clothes, but one must do ghusl after it is emitted, whether that happened when one was asleep or awake, whether it was due to intercourse, an erotic dream or anything else.   Madhiy is najis (impure) and must be washed off if it gets onto the body. As for clothes, if madhiy gets onto them it is sufficient to purify them by sprinkling them with water. The emission of madhiy invalidates wudoo but it is not essential to do ghusl after it is emitted.   As for moisture, it is taahir and it need not be washed off, and clothes need not be washed if it gets onto them. But it invalidates wudoo, unless it is continuous, in which case a woman should do wudoo for every prayer after the time for it begins, after which it will not matter if there is any moisture.

It's sad that these silly, but fun, folk rituals are passing away from memory.     I guess people are too sophisticated to have simple fun now.    The future looks bleak and sterile.     Thank heavens for Punxatawney,PA!|`|Y95mhtUnaa	What's the point of groundhog's day anyway? It's not like we get out of school for it. He's just the bearer of bad news lol.

Regardless, that adorable little groundhog says we have six more weeks of winter coming.
hiChBDPvaa	You could knit squares about 16-18cm for St Vinnies which comes in handy for winter. You could also donate cans of food or long life products to charities. Another idea is to clean through all your clothes and donate the ones which don't fit you but are still in a good condition to a charity.
Dd0muPF6aa	God NEVER purposed man to die.    On the other hand, He planned and worked so that humankind could live and enjoy life for eternity.     First, He created all things which man needs to live and enjoy life before He created the first man Adam. Genesis chap 1 gives the details. Adam and his offsprings were purposed to be Earth's caretaker.     As such God gave them the prospect to live forever as long as they carry on obeying God, acknowledging him as the sole authority in determining what is "good and bad" for them. That is, the Creator as their law-giver and ruler over them. Yes, they would have lived until today had they not chose death by rejecting God's sovereignty and by living independent from their Creator, determining what is "good and bad' for themselves.[Gen 2.15-17 and chap 3].    No. Jehovah God did not predestined man to die! Man chose death instead of life.     But God is faithful despite man's unfaithfulness. His purpose for man to live forever in perfect conditions in a Paradise earth will eventually come true. He promises:    (Isaiah 55:11) ...so my word that goes forth from my mouth will prove to be. It will not return to me without results, but it will certainly do that in which I have delighted, and it will have certain success in that for which I have sent it.    The book of Revelation confirms:    (Revelation 21:3-4) .?.?.Look! The tent of God is with mankind, and he will reside with them, and they will be his peoples. And God himself will be with them. 4?And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and DEATH WILL BE NO MORE, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed away.?.?.[caps mine]    Our Grand Creator places before earths inhabitants today the same choice as that set before the Israelites over 3,000 years ago in Moses' time:     I do put before you today life and good, and death and bad.?.?.?. I do take the heavens and the earth as witnesses against you today, that I HAVE PUT LIFE AND DEATH BEFORE YOU, the blessing and the malediction; and you must CHOOSE LIFE  in order that you may keep alive, you and your offspring, by loving Jehovah your God, by listening to his voice and by sticking to him; for he is your life and the length of your days.Deuteronomy 30:15-20.

It could be because of your choices, but it could also be because of someone elses bad choice. For instance, a drunk driver chose to drive drunk and kills someone. That innocent person was not destined to die at that moment. It was someone elses bad choice that limited that other persons experience of life. People need to realize that though we are all children of a loving God, life on earth, which we all chose to come and experience, is pretty much a do whatever you want type of experience. You have the freedom to do something or nothing with your life. You can follow or ignore God.

aO4iCwtoaa	You're joking, right?    The number of technological and medical advances that have come from the State of Israel are astonishing. Much of today's fetal genetic testing comes from Israel, as well as some of the first surgical lasers.   Instant Message and ICQ came from Israel.  Much of modern cell phone technology comes from Israel.  They have also helped lead the field in hydroponic farming and modern irrigation systems.  And whether you like it or not, the US and other countries benefit from Israeli military technology and defensive systems.      Look up the Technion Institute if you want your mind blown at some of what Israeli research and technology now allows us to do.  Chances are, at some point advances made by Israeli medical research will save the life of you or someone you love.    Hate Israel as much as you want, hate Zionism too, but it is impossible for a thinking person to deny that Israel ranks with the U.S. and Japan as technological research powerhouses.    edit to add - all Israeli Jews (and almost all Jews) are Zionists. Zionism is not some evil philosophy.  It is the belief that Israel has the right to exist, and that it is the Jewish homeland.  It does not espouse kicking non-Jews out of the land (and thousands of people of all religions live there with full citizenship, including Muslims). It does not say Judaism is superior.  The only difference between Zionism and Palestinian Nationalism (or Saudi Nationalism, or Iranian Nationalism - or any other country with a religious majority) is that the people are Jews.  Wanting a country to call your own is not bigotry.|`|AA11466759	They've perfected the art of beating one's head against the wall.  geez Ruth, I wasn't serious.

Centuries of persecution around the world and the fact that many of those countries are still in the dark ages and ruled by theocracies, have proven that Jews need their ancient homeland back.

Or this will happen to you.    I also think that your friend needs to look into her past to see what kind of guy she's attracted to.  Most guys I know are good guys.  It's just that many girls are attracted to bad boys.  That's normal when you are young.  But as you get older you need to mature and look for the right type of guy.    It's very easy know if they are good before you even go on the first date.  Quiz them, talk to them, talk to their friends, suss them out.  Make them show you that they are a good guy.  Guys love this challenge.  Bad guys can be sussed out 95% of the time before the first date.  Good luck.

Kwfo0aRvaa	Brigham Young taught Adam-God as doctrine, he claimed God had revealed this to him, he taught it from the pulpit for thirty years and threatened to excommunicate anyone who did not accept the teaching as doctrine. This LDS church now disavows this doctrine and will excommunicate anyone who teaches it.    So what?    Brigham Young said his sermons were equal to scripture:     "I know just as well what to teach this people and just what to say to them and what to do in order to bring them into the celestial kingdom...I have never yet preached a sermon and sent it out to the children of men, that they may not call Scripture. Let me have the privilege of correcting a sermon, and it is as good Scripture as they deserve. The people have the oracles of God continually." (Journal of Discourses, Vol. 13, p. 95.)    Brigham Young, we are told by the LDS church, was a prophet of God - God's earthly spokesman. And yet he taught a false identity of God according to the LDS church today. So how does a prophet of God teach the wrong identity of God, a false doctrine, for thirty years and still be considered a prophet?|`|JWjlyztBaa	Couple what you emphasizied with     "Jesus, our elder brother, was begotten in the flesh by the same character that was in the garden of Eden, and who is our Father in Heaven."      and it cannot simply be explained away by blaming transcription errors.    The better explanation is that Brigham Young was in error on this point of Mormon doctrine.  It was never adopted by the church as official doctrine and certainly superceded by accounts contained in the Pearl of Great Price.  Brigham Young's policy regarding Blacks and the priesthood was also error IMO.      Journal of Joseph L. Robinson; Oct. 6th, 1854    "President Brigham Young said thus, that Adam and Eve were the names of the first man and woman of every earth that was ever organized and that Adam and Eve were the natural father and mother of every spirit that comes to this planet, or that receives tabernacles on this planet, consequently we are brother and sisters, and that Adam was God, our Eternal Father..."    John Pulsipher Papers, Mss 1041, p. 35-37; BYU Special Collections; 8 October 1854    "...our God who is Adam came & commenced the peopling of it- Tho he is God & had lived & died & been reserected on some other plannet- & obtained his exaltation & begat the Spirits of children enough people this world he came down & brot some of the animal & vegetable productions of some other world so that they might grow & increase here - He by eating the mortal fruits of the Earth, it caused & produced mortal children or commenced the increase of men on the Earth which is the bodies for the Spirits to live in.."    Journal of Discourses, 7:285-290; Brigham Young, delivered in Salt Lake Tabernacle; October 9, 1859:  Here let me state to all philosophers of every class upon the earth, when you tell me that father Adam was made as we make adobes from the earth, you tell me what I deem an idle tale. When you tell me that the beasts of the field were produced in that manner, you are speaking idle words devoid of meaning. There is no such thing in all the eternities where the Gods dwell. Mankind are here because they are the offspring of parents who were first brought here from another planet, and power was given them to propagate their species, and they were commanded to multiply and replenish the earth. . . . Adam and Eve are the parents of all pertaining to the flesh, and I WOULD NOT SAY THAT THEY ARE NOT ALSO THE PARENTS OF OUR SPIRITS..."    Journal History, p. 131    Some may think what I have said concerning Adam strange, but the period will come when the people will be willing to adopt Joseph Smith as their prophet, Seer, and Revelator and God! but not the Father of their spirits, for that was our Father Adam.|`|OQ9SXUAMaa	I can see if you dont know much about religion it would be conusing, but I understand it, and he makes some points that are pretty obvious , but I guess they werent to the people of his time.|`|8Y0iCF2maa	BRING-UM YOUNG was a real dictator, assbite and dweeb|`|FyLfEPv0aa	I think that the method of transcribing talks was lacking and the persons are confusing (keep in mind that Young called Adam "father Adam" as the father of all living) and careful attention to this shows that he wasn't stating that Adam was God.    Young gave thousands of other speeches mentioning God, none of them even hinted that God and Adam were the same people.    He created the current temple endowment ceremony in which God and Adam are clearly separate entities.    Nice try, but your confusion on the matter doesn't change the fact that Young never once taught and clearly didn't believe what you are trying to suggest he did.|`|b7Lo5IAZaa	You know what, Abraham is referred to as "Father Abraham" all the time, by maaany different churches.

The Adam is God doctrine was taught for 50 YEARS. BY three LDS prophets!  IT was not just taught BY Brigham Young. The fourth and fifth mormon presidents Wilford Woodruff and Joseph F. Smith, supported this teaching.     Mormon "prophet" Spencer W. Kimball, denounced it in 1976.    That's NOT too long ago.    Young and others,   The mormon prophets called it DOCTRINE.  QUOTE...  "Some have grumbled because I believe our God to be so near to us as Father Adam. There are many who know that doctrine to be true." (Brigham Young, October 7, 1857, Journal of Discourses 5:331).      Where do we draw the line on what is mormon doctrine??    Young even added the teaching to the "Lecture at the Veil" in the   St. George, Utah temple ceremony!!  It is reported that this part of the Lecture was removed some time between 1902 and 1905.    LDS Adam-God Opposition - Disciplinary Action followed.   Disciplinary activity was held at high levels in the church for those who did not agree with Adam-God doctrine.    Some LDS hymns and poems of the mid-1800s also exhibited Adam-God doctrine.    It was taught for DECADES.  Edit?  Was it Josh, that was blaming the transcriber??

eFXD3Qzcaa	My testimony would be:    I was a young, stupid acoholic.  I still have my problems with alcohol, I won't deny that.  I was 19 and had a party.  Now I don't know exactly how I ended up where I was, but I guess I was completely drunk and started drving.  Like I said, I don't know where I was at.  The next thing I know I was in my truck and felt dirt right beside my head.  I was still drunk so I started trying to drive.  Of course I went no where.  So I started screaming and trying to punch/kick the windshield.  The seatbelt was so tight against my body (I know I was drunk and still put on my seatbelt!).  I couldn't get it to relax and I was panicking.  I yelled and yelled and tried to bite through the seat belt because that was what was standing in my way of escaping.  I don't remember what happened next but the next thing I remember was that I was walking down the highway without any shoes.  A sheriff picked me up and took me home.  My parents drove out where I thought I had the accident and we saw state troopers.  It's been 2 years now and just barely I am  barely paying the  consequences of drunk driving.  I have it on my driving record, I pay 62$ dollars a month for probation, I paid 1500$ for my fine, and know that when I do get my liscense back I will be paying 2,000$ dollars a year for 3 years because my bac was of .16 or higher (it was .29).  I'm still paying for what I did, but I'm not dead.      My truck was totaled.  Every side of the vehicle was crushed in except for my side.  I flew over a pond, and as crazy as it sound, it really happened.  I could have ended up in that small pond and couldnt get out.  When I walked away, I couldv'e ended up stepping on the transformer lines that I knocked down, but I didn't.      The funny thing is that I don't remember the exact moment that I got out of my truck.  I know, I know i was drunk, but I remember before and after.  I have no memory of how I got out of the seatbelt and out of the truck.    People can say whatt they want, but I truely believe it was God's way of saying "you are ******** up and I want you to know that, but I don't want you to die yet!).     I should've died in that accident, but all I got were two scars on my arm.      They found bite marks on the seatbelt.    I believe that was testimony.    And you would think it was the only bad thing that happened to me!!!  Not so much....let's just say that I should be dead with all the things that I've been through (put myself through), but it's amazing how I'm not.  I definitly believe that there is a God watching over me and thankfully I've caught myself before I ended up dead.|`|r8rykCkGaa	Yes, Jesus has helped me so many times.  All we have to do is trust him completely.  It takes faith and it's not automatic to get help.  We are instructed in the Word of God to pray constantly.  We are to stay in communion with the Holy Spirit who indwells us.  For those who were baptized in the Holy Ghost, you know beyond a shadow of a doubt that Jesus is alive and well.  He's the strongest being alive who is there for us.  When we are baptized in the Holy Spirit, Jesus baptizes us himself.  It's not the water thing in case anybody is confused.  It is in the Spirit.|`|v7hkYRDLaa	I have been helped the mindful teachings of Buddha. Jesus not so much, the whole i need to worship him is a big deal breaker.

I know I miss sometimes , and regret being careless with my attitude with others.My memory serves to remind me of those times I sound less than Christian to others,even painfully , at times, and I try to do better.Helping one another is what we are supposed to do, Christ has helped me immeasurably, I need to extend that same help to others.|`|epIsDqM4aa	Christ has helped me, who are you speaking of?

Proof that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God and are in need of a savior and unable to achieve perfection while we reside in these bodies of flesh? Proof that repenting, does not make one instantly sinless? That just as infants don't come out walking, learning to follow after ways that are not natural to our sinful natures is a process and there is growth involved in maturing in Christ that has nothing to do with age? That walking after the Spirit and not after the flesh is a process? Proof that Christians haven't ceased to be humans?    On the other hand, where is it written that a Christian cannot be angry? Being angry is not a sin. And rude? That could be a matter of perception. Jesus offended many. Was He rude or just honest?    Christians aren't perfect, but they are forgiven, because they admit they are flawed and sinful and some of us (all humans) are even downright wicked in our hearts, and when we face that reality and we confess our sin, the Lord is faithful to forgive us our sin and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

It is essential to freedom period.|`|yvDzvIbBaa	you should tolerate other peoples religion as everyone has rights, but you should not grant automatic respect.|`|ICGbWZ63aa	In our age of tolerance, moral relativism is touted as the supreme virtue. Every philosophy, idea, and faith system has equal merit, says the relativist, and is worthy of equal respect. Those who favor one faith system over another oreven worseclaim a knowledge of absolute truth are considered narrow-minded, unenlightened, or even bigoted.    Of course, different religions make mutually exclusive claims, and the relativist is unable to logically reconcile outright contradictions. For example, the Bible makes the claim that man is destined to die once, and after that to face judgment (Hebrews 9:27), while some Eastern religions teach reincarnation. So, do we die once, or many times? Both teachings cannot be true. The relativist essentially redefines truth in order to create a paradoxical world where multiple, contradictory truths can co-exist.    Jesus said, I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me (John 14:6). A Christian has accepted Truth, not just as a concept, but as a Person. This acknowledgment of Truth distances the Christian from the so-called open-mindedness of the day.    The Christian has publicly acknowledged that Jesus rose from the dead (Romans 10:9-10). If he truly believes in the Resurrection, how can he be open-minded concerning an unbelievers assertion that Jesus never rose again? For a Christian to deny the clear teaching of Gods Word would indeed be a betrayal of God.    Note that we have cited the fundamentals of the faith in our examples so far. Some things (such as the bodily resurrection of Christ) are non-negotiable. Other things may be open to debate, such as who wrote the book of Hebrews, or the nature of Pauls thorn in the flesh. We should avoid becoming embroiled in disputations over secondary matters (2 Timothy 2:23; Titus 3:9).    Even when disputing/dialoguing over prominent doctrines, a Christian should exercise restraint and show respect. It is one thing to disagree with a position; it is quite another to disparage a person. We must hold fast to the Truth while showing compassion to those who question Truth. Like Jesus, we must be full of grace and truth both (John 1:14). Peter strikes a good balance between having the answer and having humility: Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect (1 Peter 3:15).|`|xfmMeJx0aa	Tolerance is always a good thing. But, it should be balanced. Religious people ask for tolerance in one breath and don't grant others (atheists, pagans, homosexuals) tolerance in another breath. So, I believe they should be granted as much tolerance as they give. When they use their beliefs against others, then others should use their own beliefs and lack there of against them. At least in peaceful protest.     I hope a day can come where everyone can have tolerance. But, the truth is, tolerance is a two way street. No one who expects tolerance can be intolerant and no one should have to be tolerant to someone who blatantly refuses to be tolerant in kind.|`|bxYWJAYNaa	Tolerate is a good word. It means to just put up with it, or ignore it as best you can.  To tolerate something is not to like it or accept it.    So Christians can tolerate Muslims, even if they hate their religion. Tolerance does not say you have to like another person's religion, but just to leave them be and not bother with it.    The opposite of tolerance is persecution.|`|PNxtmh2Daa	We should have tolerance for several major reasons. One important one is when someone believes something emotionally almost no amount of logic is going to dissuade that person.  Pushing someone too hard when someone has been conditioned, extorted(death to unbelievers, etc.) , to believe an absurdity will elicit even more absurd behavior.   Tolerance might elicit tolerance from other people by making it socially desirable.   Another reason it is sometimes the only feasible methodology for some for dealing with tragic realities by denying the implications of that reality sublimely; just a tool to get through the day.  The downside to that is that you are opening yourself to exploitation by someone feeding on your emotions.
F8GJdplRaa	Aethists are not satanic.  they have been fooled by satan to believe that there is no god which is a way that satan uses to make people not recieve the grace of God.      Christians believe in Jesus not satan.  when you say believers it means accept as their own.  we know that satan exists because the Bible says so.      stop trying to badger either the aethist or the christian.  you can live your life as you please.  Jesus never asked us to force everyone to become christians, He just said take the good news to the ends of the earth.  then the bible also says, today i set before you life and death, choose life.  it is a choice that God leaves to you, but like a good father he tells you what is good and asks you to choose that, but also doesnt force you. it is toally your choice what u decide to do with your life.

Atheism is just a disbelief in god. That doesn't mean that they believe in satan.

Edit:  This really reminds me of the Puritans and their witch hunts, etc.  Back then, they would say people were devil worshipers just because they didn't wear the right clothes or didn't go to church, etc. However, we now know better that this wasn't true.

kVTryKlBaa	I consider my self a Christian, And from my stand point, I would tell you what they are doing is wrong.  First let me say, you DO need to be saved. But that is yours and only Your choice.   Our Lord said very clearly, when you go into a village, teach the truth, IF they listen then that's great, IF however they do not, You are to shake the dust from your sandals and leave them be.  In other words, DO NOT FORCE me ( Christ) only anyone.      This is my recommendation to you.    I assume that they travel together.  When they approach you the next time Have this learned and memorized and reply.    I understand your concern for my spiritual well being, but do you not know that the word of God tell us, that No one can come to God Unless the spirit calls them to himself?   The Lord will call me through the spirit, on his timing, and no one else.    As followers of God, I therefore ask you to honor the words of Christ that he spoke in     Matt 10 verses 11-14    You have given me the message of the Gospel, Now please honor his instructions and let me be.    IF they are indeed Christians, they must leave you alone.

The grief was still there, just not as pronounced as it had been, it was as if the death had occured months before rather than the day before.

It was certainly not the direction I was expecting my life to take, but I'm glad it did.  Continuing in prayer and faith has given me the strength to continue through the difficult times in my life and has helped me find ways to solve problems in my life that I never would have anticipated.  I am grateful for a loving God in my life.|`|368a65d0c864e9d2efce27cfa3ebd33baa	Yes but most often No or Wait.|`|uZQIUeyvaa	I've done well in school, my mom is safe, my sister is doing better in life, and I am still alive, o and My grandma is doing well in her fight against cancer.|`|fb20242b0c0635b69a6d2c2fceab8b4eaa	I'm alive and kicking. I'm sane, and I shouldn't be. I live in America where there is plenty of food, and a nice place to live with lots of luxuries. When I drive to work in heavy traffic, I don't get killed. God forgives my sins when I pray for forgiveness. My brother accepted Christ, and now he's getting his friends to go to church!   I still have a job, and it doesn't pay all that bad, and I work with friendly people, I love the people I work with, and I love my job. You are making me want to cry.|`|kZW8xXoKaa	Prayers aren't answered/denied/ignored...it's all an illusion.  There's no way to find what doesn't exist.  Christians I hope you find reality! It feels great being on the other side of delusion :)|`|1d40jvLnaa	i don't believe I ever expected god to answer any of my prayers, even growing up as a catholic.|`|a43c635a9767f924cfd929c6c43f2501aa	My son was hurt in an accident. He had a severe brain injury. The doctors said that he would probably die, but if he didn't then he would be a vegetable. I chose to believe what I Corinthians 2:5 says rather than the doctors. Now my son is a walking, talking miracle.|`|w2df2WMXaa	no, and i'll tell you why  GOD DOESN'T EXIST THAT'S WHY|`|2rJwgk40aa	He didnt answer them when I believed.Thats why I stopped.|`|4htyTXJSaa	i dont ask for much, i just wanna have fun|`|OdnkZt5daa	He hasn't seemed to reply to them. But when a family member or friends wants me to pray for them or for a loved one, I'll do it because it's respectable, and hey, you never know.|`|iR3wIKNZaa	He ignored my prayers.|`|Ld16o3kYaa	prayers are answered at a 5o percent rate...which tells me maybe it is a coincidence when people pray and he ''listens''.. it is called probability..same thing if i pray to my dead dog... or the sun or anything...|`|78VY1OiHaa	I'm curious what you asked for that was so important that you believe that your God answered your prayers? Approximately 16,000 children die of starvation and disease every day and I guarantee that they (and their parents and loved ones) were praying for help too. Why would your God help you and not them? And why is He responsible for helping you, but NOT responsible for ignoring them? He had a freewill choice, right?|`|kmAMgkiraa	God is so good. Seriously sometimes I think about hm I'd really like that and He'll end up giving it to me through other people. I don't even ask him for it! But I do pray a lot and he never lets me down. One thing I always pray for at night is to be blessed and highly favored of the Lord and I think it's the simple things I always seem to notice the most. My mom works at the healing rooms (if you don't know what that is it's a free place to go and get prayer for anything you want or need) and they see people get healed everyday!|`|Ul17eQDoaa	He has answered my prayers so many times but most recently was today.    I've been struggling with my son wanting to jump into a religion that I do not believe in. I had asked him to wait and research a little more before making that jump. He was fighting me on it for weeks and next Sunday he has planned to be baptized.     I had been praying about it a lot and I figured this was God's answer to me.. that I needed to just accept it and not fight him on his decision.    This morning I was exhausted from being up all night worried sick over the whole thing and I just laid down and cried my eyes out, prayed some more and let it all go - figured it was out of my hands.    When I woke up - my son had come home from school and told me he had decided to wait and research it a little more. I can't tell you how happy I was. God had answered my prayers. If my son decided to join after awhile, then I will take that as a sign that it was meant to be but for now, I have time to show him that it might not be the right one.|`|zdPGbYU3aa	he is always helping small or large! There is too many to even think about how much he has helped me! He is the greatest ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|T4esqtuUaa	I am sorry but I do not have negative answers because God has answered so many of my prayers. Five years my oldest son fell and broke his back and if it had not been for God I could not have made it through that time. God helps me ever day and he can do the same for you if you will just allow him to
lEignX9Vaa	I hope so! That would be so awesome.  Thanks for bringing her up, I will have sweet dreams tonight :)|`|RSv2E2KNaa	I hope!!! She's FIT!
H5CdsnByaa	I don't think it tells who stole the negatives. But Shenny is so not as cute as Sharmen. But they do have a nice connection.|`|ZNE4rdByaa	i've always wanted shane and jenny to hook up!  i mean i do love shane and carmen but carmen is gone  shane and jenny seem to even each other out.. it won't last though  a huge part of me think its just jenny being vindictive and trying to get back at shane    anyways back to the original question...  i don't think it ever revealed who stole the negatives  atleast i didn't catch it if they did
GL5MOqDKaa	my boyfriend actually does the same to me, he wuld call me whenever he can, like RIGHT when he get outta work, and RIGHT when he get home. and he ALWAYS insist i call him right after i get home because he wants to know i'm safe   i'm def. sure he's in love with u !  yay go us :]|`|4dXcZhuTaa	luckyyyyy  that's probably the most adorable thing i've heard in the longest time.  sounds like my sisters relationship.  it started that way and here we are two years later and they are getting married... no saying you'll be there, no pressure;).  just saying he's definitely falling in love with you and you are definitely falling in love with him.    it's all good just let things flow the way they have been.  he'll spill the words soon enough, v-day or later, don't expect it on v-day.. he may find it to expected and or just not the right time.|`|NuJako4gaa	Im pretty sure (like 99.8%) that he is in LOVE with you|`|UhR8Yrouaa	He is definately falling for you(:|`|DgxRKCUgaa	If he calls you, if he asks you out, if he puts you first (behind himself or not), if he can't stand not to touch you when you are together, if he lets the world know you are his, if all he wants to do is make you happy... then I think there's a pretty good chance he's in love with you.     This sounds like you two have a good thing. :)
GgMbE56Waa	Slap a person in the street then see karma working for you.|`|4854FMZjaa	The commandment that people should not do harm to any creature was ordained of old by men, who were ignorant of the true facts of the case. For, O Brahmana, there is not a man on the face of this earth, who is free from the sin of doing injury to creatures.    If u want to know more and deeply visit this site.    http://www.hinduism.co.za/karma%26.htm|`|AA11992885	a figment, depending upon how you believe in karma    if karma is merely concerning THIS life, then it is false, as, what did child with cancer do to have to suffer in that way?  or children born to abusive parents    but if karma is based upon past lives, it is tyrannical...........what could a child have possibly done to cause him or her to be born in such a way?  and is it really far to cause that child to suffer when that child doesn't know why he or she is suffering    but again, if it is from past lives, tyrannical or not, that doesn't negate it actually from happening..............but the real question is here, are there really such things as past lives?    there is no proof of this|`|AA10168935	Karma becomes figment in your imagination.    Our subconscious is our genie.  It brings you tomorrow what it sees in your thoughts today.  If you harm another, your subconscious takes that as being 'acceptable' and will put it in your life too.    It never fails.
oM7bXmkvaa	Mine was what is your favorite TV show, gah!!! it was a poll !!! Whats so bad bout dat!|`|nQEiNGkeaa	Mine was the one below. Gets deleted every time I post it here or in R & S! I guess straight people can't handle real life!        Two scenarios for you to consider both with the same beginning. I will use a guy for this question but it could easily be a girl:-    You are a straight 26 year old married man with two children. You love your family more than anything. You are not a religious family but both you and your wife are homophobic and do not want anything to do with gay people and do not want gay people anywhere near your children. Your children are too young to understand at the moment, as they are only 4 and 2 years old and they love you very much. You have a good job, nice car, house and your parents love you to. Your parents are religious and think that homosexuality is a sin and against the word of god.    Basically, you have all you want and could not be happier.    One day you start having pains in your chest and go to the clinic for a check up. After many tests, the doctors discover that your heart is failing and you are going to need a transplant very soon. A few months later you get a call to go straight to the hospital as a heart is available. Your wife and parents go with you.    Scenario 1. Whilst being prepared for the operation you hear a nurse talking and discover that the heart is from an 18 year old boy who has been killed in a car crash. You then hear her say that his boyfriend is with him at the moment and is totally devastated. You then realise the heart you are going to get is coming from a gay guy.    What are you going to do? Do you still go ahead with the transplant or risk dying whilst you wait for another? How are your parents going to react? You might never see your wife or children again. What decision do you come to and why?    Scenario 2. You get into the hospital and have the heart transplant and all is well. A few months later you find out that it was from an 18 year old gay guy who died in a car crash. You are alive and feeling better than you have for ages but you have the heart of a gay guy.    Now what are you going to do?|`|62eb64f00529ec4e271b0beecf4776c0aa	I asked if there were any other butch girls out their who didn't shave their legs and it got deleted after like 20 people answered.|`|aPcw0sz7aa	wow, people are just jealous =)    I never had a question removed, but i know some that should be (not saying your...that was retarded who ever did that)      Edit: I actually just got one of my surveys deleted =( like wtf? Okay that survey wasnt offensive at all....it didnt even ask for sexual preference let alone anything else bad. I hate people|`|oY4vwdjVaa	I just asked :  Are there more trolls and idiots in this section than genuine people?    deleted  -  I also asked this:  I read on one of those crazy fact sites that 1/3 of the population flushes the toilet while sitting down on it. I asked how they flush and asked if they thought this fact was true. I even gave the link to the site I was looking at.    I think it got deleted, but I never got a violation notice email.|`|xsZfN0JHaa	That is like asking why Yahoo is Yahoo?|`|EPki0rwgaa	My dumbest question that got deleted was:    "What was the dumbest question of yours that got deleted?" The irony...
QJT5JXf2aa	I would recommend checking out    http://www.lovingyou.com    They have AMAZING ideas for sweet, romantic gifts, especially for valentine's day. Many of them are things you can make yourself that are sweet, meaningful, and inexpensive.    They also have extensive sections dedicated to gifts for couples who are long distance, whether it be couples that met online or just couples who are apart because of occupation (such as your fiance in the Army). I know 'cause my husband lives in England and I'm in the US, and have used their suggestions a lot.    I have gone to them many times for inspiration, and while I usually add my own ideas into it, they are amazing.|`|BQ6WmoHiaa	Easy.  Get a valentine's day teddy bear from Stuffington Bear Factory.  They're cheap, ridiculously cute and they're made in the USA (no garbage from overseas).    I just picked up a few myself.  Check out their Valentine's Day lineup here:    http://www.stuffington.com/shop/pc/Valen...
AA10362256	And the question is?

Thank you!!|`|AA12220467	No|`|74a3f9985e9ffccc4da4aee469d36228aa	Dude pray some where else.!

AA11277067	Yes. I KNOW the TRUTH too salvation.  That is what it is in reference too.    .|`|AA11968156	all who have posted have CLAIMEd to know the truth opr they BELEIVE that they know. the reality of the matter is that anything coul be true. its all in the air.|`|AA11670464	Yes.    There is no compulsion in the religion; Truth stands out clear from error; Al-Quran (2:256)|`|AA10898823	I believe each religion has a piece of the puzzle called truth.  Unfortunately mankind in his quest to dominate has focused more on religion and traditions than on what is actually taught.      We use religion as a dividing line for life choices, social positions and some to condemn others to hell.      The truth is GOD loves us all.  He created us with the truth buried inside of us.  Our very need to know stands true to this.  The Truth is he created us to love and care for one another.|`|58e9624bc371c56728b3ae861253564aaa	well if u checked all the right books and compared all the religions u'll find tht islam is the right one , all u have to do is get urself a tape of quraan and hear it , beside theres too many miracles and facts tht show in the quraan and only been proved with science now thts why many scientist become muslims|`|AA11078227	No!I know the truth.|`|AA12107818	I do !!!! the truth is JESUS!!!!!|`|AA11994418	I do. Truth is not a concept, it is not an idea, it is not a philosophy, it is not a principle. It is a person-The Lord Jesus Christ. He claimed it when He said, " I am the way, the Truth and the life".     You can dilute a concept, cover an idea, argue about a philosophy, break a principle, but what do you do about a person?    They tried to kill Him but they couldn't finish Him. He is alive as ever. Truth is from everlasting to everlasting. You can not kill Him and neither can you ignore Him. Everything will be judged according to the Truth revealed.

Q6qyfPkRaa	i value human life more than dogs! however i wouldnt want to kill 1K dogs.   YEs, i would kill one dog to save the life of 1K humans.  I dont know if i would kill one person to save the life of 1K human, i guess that would depend on who the person  i had to kill was.    Honestly i dont have to draw that line, b/c God drew it for me. He killed one man for 6.6 billion ppl and counting!|`|bxYWJAYNaa	Yes, to all. Its about the greater good, and a human life is worth more than that of an animal.    As far as dogs go, how many pigs are killed to feed a human in his lifetime? And pigs are just as intelligent as dogs. So whats the difference, other than a sentimentality towards pets?|`|U7sBZKUuaa	I'd kill a dog to save one human.|`|KmnbjZIdaa	A human life is more important than the lives of a thousand dogs, so yes, I will kill the dogs.    All human life have the same value and we cannot say that 1000 human lives are more valuable than the one human you want to kill. But if the one human happened to be a serial killer, then I have to stop evil if I can, so I will kill the one human to save the 1000 he could possibly kill.|`|QMbaeva9aa	Yes. Yes, of course. Depends.|`|hjxsX4liaa	No of course not! All those dog's  : (|`|0PtGWx1paa	a.) Yes.  b.) No.    Explanation for:  a.) Because an animal's soul is connected to the body, once it dies so does the soul.  b.) I would not, because I don't want to be guilty in the eyes of the Lord (this was a tough question).|`|7HXEQBWpaa	I personally value a dogs life more than alot of humans.  We're pretty much scum anyways.   But I wouldn't kill anyone or anything.|`|WX1b747Iaa	Dogs are overrated these days, about five years would provide enough abandoned pit bulls in my area to make that quota.|`|E9chZY74aa	Sure to all three.  Humans are above animals and we have been made rulers of all creation.  Have not hundreds of thousands of cows been killed for hamburgers?  Dogs are no different.|`|WbaN6osZaa	Some hypotheses suck.  That's where I draw the line.|`|QlB3VXWraa	Depends who the human is. And the dog.|`|cUYunFvHaa	well in logic no, but in practice if i saw a group of people trying to kill a dog by beating it, i'd try to kill them!!!    and vice versa, if i saw a human being attacked by a dog or dogs plural id try to kill the dogs!!!!!    seriously|`|0HLOLwXKaa	Why must you create these insane situations in your head....when I am really faced with a situation like this i'll get back to you....|`|2C43Y9qJaa	Most Humans are scum.    No.  No.  Yes.    I wouldn't draw a line.|`|8oGTduFAaa	i would kill one human to save the life of 1000 dogs..i feel that animals (domestic mostly) don't do any harm or can really defend themselves. i am a huge animal lover no. 1 and no. 2 im constantly watching those animal cops show and the things that humans do to animals is so cruel and upsetting, it makes me so angry.  although if it came down to it i could never kill anyone/anything except those annoying mosquito's lol|`|JqtuZkzpaa	I am no dog fan, but it depends who that human is.  Bear in mind, everyone dies sometime so it is a waste of dogs.  Yes, one dog for 1,000 humans - so long as it is one of those ugly dogs.  Again, depends which human must be sacrificed - Tom Cruise? Happily.
bxYWJAYNaa	There is in a sense. It happens in our collective social dialogue on the news and in other social forums, and much is enacted in law. And cross-cultural forums like the UN's declaration on human rights and other such things, set out shared human values that function irrespective of religion.    You cannot comfort an atheist who has lost someone. Or at best say they have returned to the place they were before they were born. Death is the same as pre-birth without a soul. We go whence we came.|`|OT4SrmDXaa	They do it has different version some have the Satanic Bible others any book promoting evolution, ethics psychology ect.    So they have more then one.|`|RCn1Y3Ogaa	if we did, then we'd be a religion, which is what we're aiming not to have.|`|X548yCR6aa	Yes, I have it on a note stuck to the fridge. The note says "there are no gods".    That's about as detailed as it gets.|`|5fcM3HLsaa	Of course not.    Morals come from within; religion doesn't prevent crime or anti-social behaviour.     Besides, Atheism inherently includes freedom of expression. I'm a very liberal person, but there are also very conservative atheists out there. A book of atheistic ethics could never work, and I would never subscribe to it.    EDIT: 'You can't just leave that void empty, or it will cause emotional harm.'    That's simply not true. You can't generalise atheists like that: some are extremely evil, some are extremely decent memebrs of society - just like in ANY other category of people.|`|lF3kt2MAaa	You as an Atheist, believe in not believing anything.|`|33bcbefbc63a76a16260f6a1bd4246b1aa	Ironic. Religion is already a mind disease.    And no, atheists --rational ones at least-- don't embrace absolute truths, so no immutable books please.|`|za9b8cHKaa	Why? They'd only devote their spare time to reading it inside out so that they could disprove it ... kidding.|`|jVPd8kJMaa	Hitler, Pol pot, Mao, stalin had their own book as atheists in the past.

I believe we may not describe reality , it is outside conceptual thinking , it is emptyness in the sense , what is life when you do not judge it , describe things , harbour concepts ?|`|KVd8aKDoaa	First of all that is a completely irrational association.  Secondly I personally don't believe in God because I have realized that all creation myths are based around a central structure.  For example, the Egyptian God Horus, according to Egyptian culture, was born on December 25 to a virgin mother, was visited by 3 Kings, became a teacher at 12, had 12 followers or disciples, was baptized at age 30, was crucified, rose from the dead on the third day after death, and ascended into heaven.  Sound familiar?  The creation myth of Jesus follows the exact same pattern, as do most creation myths from other organized religions like Hinduism with Krishna, Mithraism with Mithra, and even some ancient Greek Gods like Dionysis.    Also, I know that the origin of this creation myth pattern comes from the stars.  On December 22 the sun reaches it's lowest point in the sky.  It stays there for 3 days.  This signifies the death of the sun, or the death of the "son".  After those three days, on December 25th the sun begins to rise again.  This signifies the birth of the sun (son).  On this day there is a star directly to the east of the sun that is visible called Sirius.  And next to Sirius are the 3 stars in Orions' belt.  In ancient times these 3 stars were called the "3 kings".  So you see on December 25th the 3 kings (Orions belt) were led to the Son (sun) by a star in the east (Sirius).    I don't believe in organized religion, nor do I believe in God.  I do believe there is a force that connects everything, and our creation may be entwined with this force.  I definitely do not, however, believe in any creation myths, or the typical gods the majority of the world worships blindly without question.|`|2kr84Jzdaa	Well there are many different "Gods", so I'm assuming you believe in the Christian God. I believe in a greater existence which no one has nor ever will find on earth, but I do not believe in a "God" that has shown itself to any living creature on this planet and I do not believe in a "God" that hates or damns to "hell" for eternity. I can only HOPE that there is something on the other side and something that will make everyone happy for eternity.|`|bxYWJAYNaa	The same reason I don't believe in Zeus, Thor, Bastet, Vishnu, Quezuatatl, Ameratsu or any of the thousands and thousands of other gods that humankind has come up with over the centuries.    The Christian Jaweh is just another one in the list. Besides, if Christianity was THE religion, why did it not spread all over the world faster? For 1500 years it was the religion only of Europe. People on the other continents worshipped other gods.

I know that I am saved because Jesus Christ bore my sins on the cross and when he ressurrected I rose up with Him also.   Every other relgion talks about the end of the race or the finish line but there is no way to get there. Buddhism has no way to get to nirvana, no hindu ever escapes the cycle of reincarnation, yet Christ is the only way to get to that heaven and He holds the true path to get there. When we accpet Him GENUINELY then He is in us. We reach that nirvana or whatever. Christ is our bridge from earth to heaven|`|2810d5a41e887ab0439f9306db1c4680aa	No. The non-Judeo-Christian religions are based on man-made idols and superstition. Look at true Hinduism.

Lots of them are false, only one is true, the one that stands without the use of money. Because most religions works by this but Jesus Christ never tell people to depend on money but rather he commanded them to give it to the poor. He didn't even ask them to build churches, These are false religion.|`|MbCFe1odaa	because they are ignorant and selfish... kind of like the people they call sinners|`|rXNP3Ccgaa	duh!|`|EiiVMtjyaa	Dear Friend,    Jesus Christ is the only real and "living" God.  Satan is the one who influences "other" religions to take mans focus off of the "real" Creator onto someone or something else.  He wants to drag souls to Hell.  He decieves and tricks man's thinking into half truths and calls it ...truth, when in fact, it is 100% lies.  Satan is the Father of...lies.  His the master of deception.    Jesus Christ is the only One who died a horrible death on the cross in our place.  He paid the debt of sin for humanity, that should they accept Him as Lord and Savior, and obey His Word, which is His instruction manual for man to live an abundant life, they will live in eternity with Him in glory and manage the "new" heaven and earth (future).    In the Garden of Eden, Satan deceived Adam and Eve into believing that if they ate of the forbidden fruit, that they would become "like" gods.  A lie, of course. But, because of their rebellion against God, sinned, they were banned, and no longer had the intimate relationship/fellowship with their Creator.    God knew that the only way to reconcile man "back" into right standing with Him, was to clothe Himself as Man (Jesus Christ) and die a horrible death to pay the debt of sin ...man could never pay.  With hope, that should they accept, believe and surrender their will for His will in their life, they should not perish but have eternal life with Him.  What an awesome Love story.    Any other god, cannot save you from anything.  It is a dead god.|`|dwwCJHpQaa	He only sent down the 3 Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Islam and Christianity. That is why they are so similar.  I believe these 3 religions were actually the same at the start, but Christianity and Judaism were changed by people (accidentally and probably intentionally as well).  I'm sorry if I offend anybody, but I think the rest of the religions were made up and influenced by Satan who is a creation of God, so therefore God did influence all the religions.    As for your other question:  What makes my religion of Islam right is that it has not been changed (debateable). Scientific discoveries are constantly being made supporting the religion and the writings in the Koran.  The koran supports the big bang theory, That the earth is 4 billion years old, etc.    And if you have ever met a person who is very Islamically religious,  you will see how kind and respectful that person is, and what the religion does to it's believers.     Islam supports people who believe in God, and says that Christians, jews and believers in God will also go to heaven.

AA10503170	I'd like to see a citation to your claim that Zionists helped the Nazis.  Other than that, I don't believe the State of Israel is the work of any god.  I believe it was created by a bunch of Jewish terrorists with the backing of England, the UK and the UN.    EDIT: Thanks for the cite.  I will check them out!|`|38vza5Gxaa	answer: B/S, all of it.  Jews lived peacefully in Muslim lands because they were second class citizens and oppressed the majority of the time.  Made to dress in ridiculous clothing, required to stand if a Muslim wanted to sit, stepping on the walk if a Muslim approached. Allowed only to ride a mule without a saddle and required to dismount when a Muslim approached.  Forbidden to raise their voices during worship.  Paying a "fine" for being "allowed" to remain Jewish.    That's not peaceful.    When Muslims controlled Jerusalem they broke agreements and treaties to allow Jews to worship at the Western Wall.    Jews protect Muslim sacred sites in Jerusalem and allow the dome to stand, despite that being a sacred site to Judaism LONG before Islam.    "If Muslims lay down their arms, there will be peace  If Jews lay down their arms, there will be a bloodbath."    Try again and stop pretending to be Jewish.|`|aO4iCwtoaa	Quoting Neturei Karta rabbis as advocates of Judaism would be like quoting Ayaan Hirst Ali about Islam, or Bill Maher about Catholicism.  Not only do their handful of members not agree with 99.9% of other religious Jews, some of their members have been excommunicated from their own small Chassidic sect of Judaism.  Their opinion is basically considered irrelevant - the only people who respect it and consider them Jewish authorities are anti-Semites who wish to see Israel destroyed.  Not Jews.  Even Jews who do not consider themselves Zionists do not follow their precepts.    Secondly (and more importantly) - so what?  The State of Israel was not established by religious war, it was established by the UN.  Dozens of countries with few or no Jews voted to establish it, based on the needs of refugees to have a place to live.  The same way that Pakistan was created at around the same time for Muslims living in India.  By your reasoning, Pakistan also has no right to exist.  It is not mentioned in the Qur'an, after all.      There is no Jewish scripture that says that if an outside government creates a Jewish country, it is against the Torah for Jews to live there.  Jews lived in the land for millennia - they did not suddenly show up to an Arab land which had no Jews in it; the towns of Safed, Hebron, and Jerusalem were inhabited by Jews for centuries.    And being forced to live as dhimmi in Arab countries is not the same as living in peace.  It meant they were not allowed to fight for their rights the way the Palestinians now do.  Palestinians can not stand having essentially dhimmi status in the occupied territories, yet have no problem calling for Jews to have that status when they eventually get their own country - assuming they allow Jews to live there at all.  Double standard much?

You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you"  (Matthew 5.43-45 ESV)    "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.  "Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.  "Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.  "Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.  "Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy.  "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.  "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.  "Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousnessa? sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.  "Blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you."  (Matthew 5.3-12 ESV)  Gandhi said if the world lived by The Sermon on the Mount then the world would be a better place.    "Judge not, that you be not judged. For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged, and with the measure you use it will be measured to you. Why do you see the speck that is in your brothera?s eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? Or how can you say to your brother, 'Let me take the speck out of your eye,' when there is the log in your own eye?     You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brothera?s eye"  (Matthew 7.1-5 ESV)    Golden Rule  "So whatever you wish that others would do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets."

It depends on the particular brand of Christianity to some degree as well. Young earth creationist interpretations of the Bible are an easy target for example because nothing about their beliefs are well supported by the scientific evidence. The Noah's ark story if taken literally also is not confirmed by geological evidence according to the majority of geologists and is also doubtful given the probable dates for it and the fact we have records stretching back through the Egyptian civilization without mention of such a flood or sign of major catastrophic destruction of all its civilization.

Jesus died for our sins, but also the sins of those who came before him.  However, those who came before him could not have accepted his gift.  Still there are vauge references to "saints" (people like Moses or Elijah) that could be interpreted as their gaining entry into heaven.  These references (I want to say they are in Acts), however, are sufficently vauge enough, that one could make a case either way.  I personally don't think that they went to heaven, but I don't feel so strongly about this that I would argue with someone who thinks that they did.    Make up your own mind, but make it up by careful and thoughtful reading of your bible, and not by what you think is "right" or "just".|`|1E7gqGBGaa	Yeah that's the way he rolls.|`|1crezOraaa	Good works alone do not get you to heaven.|`|AA10192697	We have no idea who is in hell and who is in Heaven.

Just read the New Testament, paying attention to the adverbs, stating imminence.  The closer you get to the end of the Bible (Revelation) the more imminent it becomes (just a few years after Rev was written)    These adverbs such as "soon, at hand, without delay, shortly, standing at the door, it is the last hour" can not mean "soon" to the original audience, and also "soon" to us 2000 years later.      Read the Works of Josephus who penned the Great Tribulation under Nero and affirmed all the signs Jesus gave to herald His coming.  His return was not about blowing up the planet, but destroying the early Christians' world - their 1500 year old traditions of temple sacrifice and rituals.  The temple in Jerusalem being burned to the ground back then was a horrendous event, but truly, this "end" was a covenantal end, not a cosmic end.      "Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end." - Ephesians 3:21    Ecclesiastes 1:4 "A generation goes and a generation comes, But the earth remains forever."    "He laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed for ever." - Psalm 104:5     The new covenant age we live in today lasts FOREVER.................!!

2b5799147194d19d72182c8e2216fa41aa	I love this Psalm and this verse, it means a great deal to me.    Psalm 27:4 One thing have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to enquire in his temple.    " One thing " These words  bless me because it is a singleness of heart, one purpose, his greatest desire above all else. It says he desired this of the Lord, showing how much he yearned for it, thirsted after it, and he goes on to say " that will I seek after ", showing that he is speaking by faith by saying " that will I seek after " he is not only speaking for the present but the future too, no matter how long he lives he will pursue this, and his heart is purposed to do this, nothing wavering and holding nothing back. He was seeking the Lord with his whole heart.    " that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, "  I see this as eternal life, To dwell in the house of the Lord is to live with the Lord, to be in His presence  and I believe " all the days of my life " meant not only here in this world but for eternity.     " To behold the beauty of the LORD, " Praise God! To behold Him!  To see the Lord and look on Him! How could there be any lack or need for anything?  We have a blessed promise that we will see His face ( Rev. 22:4 ) To look on Him, is more than words could express.   To look on His glory, my Saviour, my God, my Father, to see His beauty and splendor!  To see face to face the One who died for me, the One who loves me so much, and I love so much, it is my heart's desire and I wait with great anticipation.  When you love someone your heart goes toward them, and you desire to be with them and to see them, to see the Lord's face to see His expressions to see Him in all His glory! Praise God! What a day that will be!    " And to enquire in his temple. " I see this as seeing the deep things of God in His presence, to worship the Lord, to be at His feet, to ask about , to search out, to see Him as He is.  If we are speaking the Lord will also answer, and to hear His voice speaking to us in such a way we haven't heard before, face to face!  Praise God!  We know in part, and see in part but on the day when the part is gone and we will know completely and see Him face to face, what a day!    1 Corinthians 13:12 For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.     I do desire these things, I believe all of God's children do, to live with   Him forever, to behold Him face to face, to hear His voice, to worship Him for eternity I do desire this with all my heart.    Thanks for asking this,  with much love and sincerity in Christ,  andrew|`|6bKws0fAaa	YES AMEN IT IS!  GODS GRACE HAS BEEN BESTOWED UPON ME AND I DO FEEL THAT THAT IS MY DESIRE.  I was genuinely saved in sept. 2008 and before that my whole life was in false confidence. I lived in constant sin and believed myself to be saved. However I truly found Christ in september and He has set me free. The light is beautiful.     But this verse is beautiful. This should be the desire of all Christians. Amen and praise be to Him.|`|r8rykCkGaa	I love this chapter.  One of my favorite chapters in Psalm.  If you go to a spirit-filled church like I do, you see some of the beauty of the Lord there each time.  When I first came into the charismatic movement some years ago I was looking forward so much to the glory of God in the meetings because my home life was anything but that.  The Lord allows us to go through difficult years in order to bring us out into his marvelous light and show us his glory.|`|AA12346187	yes that sounds  wonderful  but I generally think of psalm 23 as my faverate.|`|EiiVMtjyaa	Dear Friend,    There is something admirable about "one-thing" people...

When I read the above scripture, all I could hear from the Lord were the words "In Your Tabernacle" and the above song came directly in my mind, so as you listen to this song I hope you will see, hear and feel the beauty of the Lord and I pray this song will minister to you as it did me. God Bless!|`|1ec32bd76f3584208ce83bf42928a21faa	This verse in my view applies to those of the Old Covenant.  As born again believers our Father has already put us in Jesus (1 Corinthians 1:30) and the Holy Spirit lives in us as His temple (1 Corinthians 6:19).  We do not have to seek Him He is Emmanuel God in us.  We just need to be aware that He is in us and we can communicate with Him at all times.  For we look at the things unseen which are eternal and unto Jesus as the author and finisher of our faith.  When our spiritual eyes are opened we see Him.  God bless you.
MXYWSsM7aa	I believe that Peter was telling us to redeem the times because the days are evil, even then. To walk circumspectly and to be instant in season and out of season. Remember too that He had told the disciples that no man knows the hour when the Lord will return but He said He'd give us the signs of the season. So, if we are to be instant in and out of season then we are to be ready at all times because a day to the Lord is as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day. He also said to Watch and Pray.   Jimmy, He doesn't want us to worry, ever, but He does want us to be ready. Discern the times yourself and you will see that these are the last days. Watch and Pray. God Bless. :)|`|qnaGMFAGaa	I believe Peter is  telling us here  How the lord is  patient   with all of us He waits & suffers long untill we    "repent " ( untill we  change the way we  think) and understand, about God's goodness,love  Mercy, & grace.:)      If you remember he was in that place too , He was't  getting the pure gospel of grace ( I can not go in to scriptures right now as i am at work sorry ) and Paul rebuked him for that very reason (Am I right here?:)   The lord was patient with Him.     "But do not forget this one thing, dear friends: With the Lord a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day. The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance." (2 Peter 3:8-9 )   God bless you precious Jimmy.:)|`|UDXp2d8Zaa	But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.    and Peter is also telling christians that Jesus can be here at anytime.|`|lh8Tn02Naa	The authorship of this letter is disputed, so I'm not sure Peter is telling us anything.    Nor is he telling "us".  We didn't exist and it would be rather amazing if he had imagined we ever would.  1900 or so years from the time of writing, the world would still be around?  Get away.    The writer, addressing HIS audience - not us - is frantically back pedalling.  He is dealing with the end-timers of his day who were getting agitated at the stubborn insistence of the world in continuing to exist.  They expected and had been given reason to expect that the end could come soon.  It hadn't, so "Peter", or whoever, is telling them hang on, God's time scale might be a bit different from ours.    The only contemporary lesson I draw from this is that today's end-timers are completely wrong-headed in their focus on ancient prophesies, but I already knew that.    Not everything in the Bile has anything to say to "us" at all.  Anyone for Ezekiel 23?|`|r8rykCkGaa	That with the Lord one day is as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day.  I think this applies to the creation story.  Each day of creation was actually 1000 years.  Do you think so?  But, I think he said this so that we would realize that if Jesus says he is coming soon, that a thousand years is soon to him.  The early church was saying Jesus is coming back soon, but that was nearly 2000 years ago.|`|EiiVMtjyaa	Dear Friend,    Peter was explaining that with the Lord, one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.  He can expand a day into a millenium, or compress a millennium into a day.  He can either spread or concentrate His activities.  God is "timeless."  He does not live in a sphere of time as we do.    Time (in our realm) is determined by the relation of the sun to the earth, and God is 'not' limited by this relationship.|`|5JqCObDSaa	He is telling us to also be ready, for no one knows the day or hour in which our Savior will come.|`|nqfgt0BRaa	that the promise of the return of the son of God is firm and sure .time frame not withstanding|`|qRFTEBlGaa	Consider Jehovahs Patience    4 Concerning Jehovahs patience, the apostle Peter wrote: Let this one fact not be escaping your notice, beloved ones, that one day is with Jehovah as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day. Jehovah is not slow respecting his promise, as some people consider slowness, but he is patient with you because he does not desire any to be destroyed but desires all to attain to repentance. (2?Peter 3:8,?9) Please notice two points expressed here that can help us to understand Jehovahs patience.    5 The first point is that Jehovah does not view time as we do. To the One who lives forever, a thousand years are as one day. He is not restrained or pressured by time, but he is not slow in acting. Possessing limitless wisdom, Jehovah knows precisely the best time to act for the benefit of all concerned, and he patiently waits for that time to come. However, we should not conclude that Jehovah is insensitive to any suffering that his servants may experience in the meantime. He is a God of tender compassion, the personification of love. (Luke 1:78; 1?John 4:8) He is able to undo, completely and permanently, any harm that this temporary permission of suffering might have caused.Psalm 37:10.    6 It is, of course, not easy to wait for something that one yearns for. (Proverbs 13:12) Thus, when people do not swiftly fulfill their promises, others may conclude that they do not intend to do so. How unwise it would be to think that of God! If we mistake Gods patience for slowness, the passing of time can easily cause us to give way to doubt and discouragement, and we risk becoming spiritually drowsy. Even worse, we might be misled by those whom Peter earlier warned againstridiculers, those without faith. Such ones mockingly say: Where is this promised presence of his? Why, from the day our forefathers fell asleep in death, all things are continuing exactly as from creations beginning.2?Peter 3:4.    7 A second point that we can draw from Peters words is that Jehovah is patient because he desires all to attain to repentance. Those who stubbornly refuse to turn back from their bad ways face execution at the hand of Jehovah. However, God finds no pleasure in the death of the wicked one. Rather, he delights to see people repent, turn back from their bad ways, and keep living. (Ezekiel 33:11) Consequently, he is exercising patience and is having the good news declared in all the earth so that people may have every opportunity to live.    8 The patience of God is also seen in his dealings with the ancient nation of Israel. For centuries, he put up with their disobedience. By means of his prophets, time and again he urged them: Turn back from your bad ways and keep my commandments, my statutes, according to all the law that I commanded your forefathers and that I have sent to you by means of my servants the prophets. What was the result? Regrettably, the people did not listen.2?Kings 17:13,?14.    9 Finally, Jehovah sent his Son, who tirelessly appealed to the Jews to become reconciled to God. Jesus patience perfectly mirrored that of his Father. With full knowledge that he was soon to be put to death, Jesus lamented: Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the killer of the prophets and stoner of those sent forth to her,how often I wanted to gather your children together, the way a hen gathers her chicks together under her wings! But you people did not want it. (Matthew 23:37) These poignant words are not those of a stern judge who is eager to punish someone but those of a loving friend who is patient with people. Jesus, like his Father in heaven, wanted the people to repent and escape adverse judgment. Some did respond favorably to the warnings of Jesus and escaped the terrible judgment that came upon Jerusalem in 70?C.E.Luke 21:20-22.|`|IMDXPeNZaa	I agree and disagree with what King of the Woad said. I agree that the Bible was not written "to us" but it is definitely "for us".    I disagree when he said, "The only contemporary lesson I draw from this is that today's end-timers are completely wrong-headed in their focus on ancient prophesies, but I already knew that."    How do you know that "today's end-timers are completely wrong-headed in their focus on ancient prophesies"? That's a pretty big assumption if that's what you're saying.    The fact is Jesus could come back at any moment. There are no signs preceeding the Rapture. That's why this event should purify us daily so that we aren't caught doing or thinking something that wouldn't be pleasing to the Lord when He does catch His saints up in the clouds.    Since there are no signs preceeding the Rapture every serious Christians needs to ponder these questions:    1) Am I living a holy and godly life?  2) Am I being the soul winner (witness for Christ) that I know God wants me to be?  3) If I'm not, is your church a soul winning church? If not, why not seek a church that does have weekly soul winning to keep you accountable?

Because first and foremost, honesty is always necessitated- on the internet and in real life.  So I'm going to tell you this anyway. The deciding factor is knowing 100% what that persons sexuality is. because I don't agree with trying to "turn tricks" or changing someone. That's not cool.  You should know 100% what ones sexuality is before approaching them. I was friends with a girl who was finally fed up and she slapped this lesbian across the face because she would not stop bothering her. She kept making advances, and my friend [at first] would very patiently decline her. Again, you should know someone and don't betray their trust if you ever do get to be friends with them.

I can't do "ANYTHING" right now.  Just for a short listing...    1. I cannot flush my toilet, take a shower, wash dishes, etc. because we have no running water due to frozen pipes  2. I cannot pay my bills because I am not earning enough money ... my pizza job's hours have been cut to zero, and my cleaning biz is being hit by a bad economy  3. I cannot find a new job and I've been searching since June of last year  4. I cannot call or see my sister ever again because she was killed in a tragic car accident in October    ... I would go on, but you'd get depressed... like me.    Without ANY limitations???? I think not.      I am thankful for my life, yes, but it's not a fun, nor easy one right now.      Have a blessed day.|`|aFnxvO1faa	"We are living right now.

If there aren't any limitations, then why am I still a shoe salesman?|`|4VouLn4waa	Well if you are living to please an "almighty creator", you cant do anything therefore life must not be that great  but if your living just for yourself, and feel you can do what ever will make you happy, then life is great
tLXD3yOWaa	people act really dumb.  when you are high you notice small things  and make a big deal about them.  you feel really light like your flying  and stupid things happen.|`|URhKqq71aa	When you are high...    Music becomes richer.  Sometimes you are very calm and observant to things.  Other times, like when you are with your friends, things are more livelier and it is easier to laugh.  I wouldn't say everyone acts "stupid".  That's stereotyping.    There is not slurred speech.  No dizziness.    It is like life in HD.    People overrate the "harmfulness" of it.  Cigarette smoking is just as bad, if not worse.  It is drugs like meth and heroin you should stay away from.|`|lnnv29dzaa	They become more interested in things, laugh a lot more. No there's no slurred speech. They can walk straight. No they're not dizzy. They usually start a conversation with " Have you ever wondered why...?"  People say they make big deals out of small things, but it's the other way around. When your sober your too blind to see the beauty in something as simple as a cloud in the sky.|`|DqUXn5wFaa	They act loopy.|`|2cf99691bb36e8205d594c179df58bdeaa	ppl act stupid    you feel strange and confused  like you're as light as a feather|`|DU9dx1Uzaa	Stupid! I can tell you that right now.  You almost feel like you are floating and like you are in a dream, which can be a lil dangerous because you might think that you can fly and jump out of a window and die.  But if you can handle it pretty cool.|`|xoVsM3dxaa	their speech isn't slurred, they just act like they're in a daze, and they act more relaxed than usual. If they have a freakout, then they start saying weird, paranoid stuff, but for the most part, the way people act high in movies is way exaggerated.
EXurNsB4aa	I definitely love more than I hate, and like more than I dislike.  It's really hard for me to actually hate some one.  It takes so much energy out of me to hate a person.

I like liking people!|`|2jxWrnUGaa	I love more people then i hate =D   and i like more people then dislike :D|`|lrqZHi9Jaa	I love lots of people, am lucky that they love me back  I dont hate people, just find some are harder to tolerate for any length of time than others

AA11440601	Dualism is the view that two fundamental concepts exist, which often oppose each other, such as good vs evil, light vs dark, or male vs female.     Christianity is very non-dualistic.    The God absolute and infinite. The devil is an opposing character, but is subordinate to God.     The Christian faith thus does not consider the duality of good and evil to be two equal and opposing forces.     The teachings and parables of Jesus Christ cannot be understood by a dualist mind:  ? Finding is losing  ? Losing is finding  ? The poor are rich  ? Hunger is satisfaction  ? Satisfaction is emptiness  ? Weeping is bliss  ? Death is real life    Dualism teaches:  ? Good - Bad  ? Crime - Justice  ? Sin - Damnation    But in Christianity, God breaks the dualist rules with love, mercy, and forgiveness.    Christianity is a "both" mentality, not "either" or "or"  ? Both flesh and spirit  ? Both God and man  ? Both Adam and Christ  ? Both law and faith  ? Both Creation and Evolution    Jesus is   ? Not upset with the sinner  ? Upset with people who think they are not sinners    With love in Christ.
LNYxvqWUaa	i completely agree when i read the bible passage i get the feeling we are being wronged even more, the way he uses the bible passage  as a comparison really makes it power-full.|`|UL3XOKJxaa	Somewhat...|`|Tcu0NWkUaa	I had never considered the relationship between the biblical passage and the current government/financial crisis.  It's hard for me to look upon the government bailouts as the merciful master, but it's easy to see the creditors as the unmerciful servants.    We taxpayers are actually the servants in this case.  Our all-wise and all-knowing government officials have taken upon themselves the roll of most merciful benefactor with taxpayers money.

n3Dslhtfaa	assuming that because this is in the LGBT section i am going to go with the word ****** for use of this question.     letters by themselves have no apparent meaning, words have meaning and they can mean different things to different people. that being said if i choose i can give any word i want any personal meaning. and the sentence. "i want skittles" could read as "bite that penguin" or vice versa. last i checked we use words to communicate, for the purpose of making this easier we tend to give words meanings and stick with them so that we don't find ourselves having to learn an entire language every time we meet a new person. BUT, that doesn't mean that we still can't give words personal meaning.   ask yourself this...  is the word ***** inherently worse then the word dog?  the answer... NO  the meaning behind the words is. so if anyone so chose they could give any word meaning and it wouldn't matter what the majority of people thought about that word in the first place. the hateful meaning behind that word is the problem. so the solution is not to get rid of the word but to get rid of the hate.|`|AA11564934	whatever, it helps if we know what the word is|`|sgRJRuvgaa	if your talking about n*gger I used to really not like the word but I hear to many black people use to give a sh*t anymore.  BTW put a * over the vowels in your cuss words especially if the question is about them
CHMfm6bXaa	I applaud your mother for being brave enough to get out when she did.  Beating your spouse is wrong period.      I say identify yourself as you see fit.  It is none of their business if you identify yourself as White or Black (African American)|`|OZjlW5utaa	'She doesn't like white people' I would consider her ignorant because she bases her perceptions of white people on a terrible incident that happened. It's up to her to consider herself black, white or biracial but all biracials should recognize and identify with both sides.|`|4b763bad020f3ed283fdcd243915642faa	Identifying with one race doesn't mean you should hate the other, How could you hate black people you are part black, regardless to how you look, do you hate yourself? If you do I wouldn't be surprise hatred for another race is usually rooted in fear and self hatred.      Considering you have spent the majority of your life around whites its strange that you could hate blacks and you don't know many of them.|`|p0a1dB28aa	It seems like it is harsh in your situation, but if was opposite then it seems like it would be different. Truthful black people don't naturally hate white people. We are just like any body else. We want a nice life for our kids and family. If you hatred for black people is solely based on your experience with your dad, and judging it on that, then it is wrong. It is easy for you to pursue this hatred with relationship with the black community. I feel like it is a cope out. Because I can do the same thing. I can hate all the white people all day for slavery injustices and things like that but I am hurting myself. It is ignorance and I choose not live my life like that. Use your energy to be healed and saved. You will live a healthier life for you and your mother because she needs healing to! You are smart and I encourage you to be the seed of goodwill and help to your life. Don't underestimate your power and what you can achieve. God gave use two ears and one mouth for a reason. Meaning listen to God and good people harder. Don't be so quick to judge people. email me if you want any help. lovegrams19@yahoo.com|`|7EwUZ5Npaa	your mother seems like a wonderful woman and im not saying anything to offend her.  But if your judging her as the most perfect loving woman on the Earth, would u consider ALL white woman to be LOVING AND PERFECT.  No. Theres a fair share with all personalities and that aalone is hypocritical.      As for the black girl and abusive father, she has the same problem as u.  No one ever said it was right for her to deny her white side so that scenerio is as much wrong as urs.

It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. 1 Corinthians [something]       that seems like all I need in life  love is wonderful  so all i need is love  what about you?|`|MbCFe1odaa	How much love and what qualities make love.... well love.....and just to let you know John Lennon had a lot of "LOVE" to give if you know what I mean|`|1dQsvw2kaa	oh yes. and money. and sandwitches....  :D

I'm not saying bisexuality isnt real, I'm just saying that  in 9th grade there was one girl I used to hang out with, who refused to let any other bi/lesbian girls into the group because she wanted to be the only one. And she went as far as to convince other people bisexuality wasnt real so that she could be "unique"|`|u95CwRSaaa	I don't like gay men that judge other gay men for being who they are, if flamboyancy is their nature than let them be.

11b70cab8a6a69fef89e99846ac0cc19aa	Numbuh one, you've definitely got it wrong. Faith and reason CAN go hand in hand, there's no problem about that. Maybe you have to sacrifice part of your reasoning if you wish to accept God, but you can still keep a large part of it intact.    I've got no problem with people rejecting faith because of their reasoning. But to think accepting faith means rejecting reasoning is unfair.|`|AA12024278	I don't think faith or irrationality will serve us in Heaven. I think truth will do us well in Heaven. If we're with God, then we'll be able to know truth more completely in Heaven. Reason will have reason and validity in Heaven. We don't have to disregard reason to reach Heaven. If we embrace truth, we can get to Heaven.|`|aPuj6xoHaa	One has to embrace reason, repent and trust in Jesus Christ to reach heaven.  Faith and reason go together.  It is irrational and unreasonable to believe we here by some astronomical random chance and reject the truth of the almighty perfect Creator God who designed and created us for a very specific purpose.|`|bxYWJAYNaa	Its supposed to be some sort of test.    The reasoning goes something like this :  if everyone had proof that God existed without a doubt, then everyone would behave virtuously just to get into heaven. Evil people would fake being good and virtuous if they thought that would be the way to guarantee a reward for themselves at the end.    With doubt, evil people are not motivated to fake being good, and the true character of people is revealed. So doubt weeds out the disingenous.    That at least is the basic gist of it.
MvZMA5BGaa	God has already proved His existence to man and because of that He states that the man that denies Him is completely without excuse.  Because man is actually a suppressor of truth and not a seeker after God, once he becomes convinced that he has silenced God, he then finds his next mission is to silence those people that have met the God that he insists does not exist.  Man cannot have his fanciful delusion tampered with and so he will work tooth and nail to oppose the redeemed man or woman and ironically will often times spend his entire life doing so.|`|ridu0Rtwaa	What a wonderful demonstration of why christianity is seen as so nasty nowadays and why there is a growing backlash against it!!

People who were raised and conditioned to believe in Allah or Apollo or Odin have similar "experiences". If these fantasies help you lead a better life then go for it. It's your right.

Scientists make their names by discovering contrary facts; the last thing they're going to do is keep them secret!    But hey, the religious are going to keep on bashing their beliefs about creation and a young earth regardless - while burning their coal and oil, and eating their turkey dinners.    Great, isn't it?|`|bxYWJAYNaa	Ask yourself this, has science and truth become another type of religion?    Why is absolute scientific truth so important?    Humans have believed in the things which comfort them and get them through difficult times in life for millenia.   So they believed things that were not true, but does that matter really?    In the end science will fail us. Our technology depends on metals, minerals, and oil all of which are quickly becoming depleted.    The religion of science preaches that human society and technology will continue to "evolve" upwards forever. This is blind faith. In reality modern civilisation will eventually come crashing down and we will enter a new dark age. Resource depletion will be the curse of scientific progress.|`|QMbaeva9aa	Not all science contradicts with Christianity. It's mostly evolution that's the problem.

But he has answered me several times and I had to wait along time to here from him.      Fine if your mad about him not showing himself then tell him but don't waist your life rejecting him because you don't get everything you want.  Thats foolish to do that.      Maybe if he left you in agonizing pain I could see you yelling why have you left me like this but your just anrgy because he doesn't apear to you.

Animals don't go to heaven or hell....they are on this Earth simply for our enjoyment. All you need to do to see that God exists (or at least all I need to do) is to look outside at his wonderful creation....that's right get off your computer and go for a walk....just look at the trees, and the clouds, and the sky, and everything and how can you believe that there is no Intelligent Designer (AKA God)|`|4BppP7Mkaa	The whole point is that he's not meant to be seen.|`|7cLYgf2raa	You sound like a very rebellious child throwing a tantrum.|`|DZ5jSsMvaa	I think the word "if" sums it up nicely.

It's a maze which they can't even follow and prefer not to.  The basic message behind any religion is "don't think for yourself."  Thinking would tend to leave you questioning multiple doctrinal inconsistencies as well as the blatant absurdity of any religions.  And the Bible is merely a collection of myths stolen from other religions (Judaism, multiple pagan religions).  It is not a historical document, and not one miracle contained within it actually ever happened.  That's why we don't see them today.  We are (though this certainly doesn't apply to some weaker minded contemporaries), in general a smarter, less naive, more scientifically savvy people than those who existed during "biblical times" so we're going to see alleged miracles for what they really are....simple magic tricks.

Yes, He has always been there. The question of where, by whom, how, did God come into being would never end.

xxEhpytpaa	Abortion is murder, it is a separate heart and it beats and has a soul.   Oh don't get me wrong, the baby needs the mother to grow, but none the less it is a separate human being. And destroying it by abortion is cruel and abusive, for this child cannot fight back. It is the sickest murder that can happen. The only way this precious child can fight is to curl up and try to move away from the intrusion, which is to no avail because they are either burned or pulled apart with instruments. Forbid it look like a human when they are finished. then the person who is having the abortion will see they have just murdered their own child. God have mercy on us.    The parent that has this atrocity done to her, will never hear this baby cry, but God hears it everyday, every minute a child is murdered, the sound is deafening.    BTW my mother-in-law was told after she had her first child born still-born, that she could never carry a baby again for it would kill her. She had 7 more after that and lived to see great-grandchildren. Doctors can be wrong too!|`|AA10493307	It is unless you are killing the baby to save the life of the mother, generally speaking.|`|ridu0Rtwaa	This is a silly argument  that harms the pro life argument!!    All the developed countries hold that a fetus is not a person in being until it can sustain life on it's own outside the mother.  Therefore by definition it cannot be murdered!!    The stupidity of trying to call it murder is that it shows extremism, lack of logic, lack of knowledge and therefore weakens the debate before it even starts!!    The way you engender change is to set about it logically and calmly and leave the wild gestures and extremist talk outside!!|`|HWoLbR7Aaa	Disagree. Abortion is self-defense. If I can kill someone who trespasses on my property, I can certainly kill someone who trespasses on my body.|`|C1SOqQSkaa	I entirely agree with the answer equating a fetus with a tumour.

Try registering a ton of iron ore as a vehicle.|`|UDXp2d8Zaa	the bible says that christians must obey the laws of man.so if the law says it is murder, it is murder.|`|wwdllMzYaa	disagree  we euthanise animals, and some countries do people too, do we class that as murder because if abortion is, then so is euthanasia, and any and all killing we humans do  which is a LOT    we humans have a tendency to pick and choose what WE like and dont like and say those are the rules , but they are usually hypocracies|`|oGRsxfBiaa	Lol love it how Mushroom there is comparing a baby to a cancerous tumor, gg -_-    I am pro-life in all circumstances apart from those where the mother's life is in real danger if she goes ahead with the pregnancy. In that case I think it should be up to the mother to chose what to do.    Edit: Love all the thumbs down from people who prefer to cover behind saying that a foetus is more like a tumor than it is like a baby because they simply want to have sex and not have to deal with the consequences of their own actions.     A tumor will never grow into a beautiful baby who will gaze at you with their eyes full of wander, it will never grow into an adorable toddler who will give you cuddles and tell you 'I love you mommy (or daddy)', it will never grow into a curious child asking you 100's of silly questions and sharing their inside world with you. But yeah I guess it is much easier to think that it is just a pile of cells when you tear the poor thing apart in its mother's womb, rather than give it a chance to become a person and enjoy the gift of life like you do.|`|aPuUuWlLaa	No, abortion is not equivalent to murder to me since the defintion of personhood is not met by a nonsentient fetus that lacks the brain development to know that it exists.    In response the emotive but unscientific or based in reality answer given by Believer wife Mother. 99% of abortions occur in the first trimester when the fetus lacks any sort of brain develop or ability for independent movement. While some pro-life videos try to impart that the fetus tries to move away what happens is no different then if you try to fish a piece of broken egg shell out of the egg in your bowl. You will note due to the viscosity that the shell moves away from your finger when you reach for it. Its not sentient and trying to protect itself though. Why are the arguments for the pro-life position always based on bad science, over emotive response, and lack of compassion for the truly sentient being involved?|`|E3pvPh3Xaa	I'd recommend an abortion to anyone. The world is overpopulated as it is and if you don't think you're prepared for a child you probably aren't.    As for the whole 'potential life' thing, any woman who resists rape is stopping a potential pregnancy/birth|`|U7sBZKUuaa	Yes, abortion is murder.|`|zZxX5PXBaa	I'm with Artemis on this.    Fascinating to see the absurdity of some of the pro-abortion arguments. Not least the 'trespassing on my property' one. In most countries you don't actually have the right to kill someone if they trespass on your property, you have a legal duty of care. Only in America, land of the death cult, would anyone come out with a response like that.|`|HMteUyRdaa	I agree they are little lives, that is what fetus means is little one. Too bad more people don't know the definition of the Latin word.

They're living gifts from "God" also... why do they want to go against "gods" will?|`|QvOIkvHFaa	I do feel that abortion is murder, but i think its only murder when abortion is used as birth control. If couples choose to have sex without protection than they are risking a possible pregnancy.   If someone were raped into a pregnancy than an abortion is probably for the best, and mothers that are unable to bear children, they would be murdering themselves.   It's so hard to choose one side to ABORTION, and I think everyone should look at it from every angle.|`|b2bMy1EAaa	Disagree. The chance of life is not a human child. It merely has the chance that it will become a human life.|`|fDh3U3jraa	The fact that it is even a question makes it wrong. Would you do anything else if you were uncertain if it was murder. No you wouldn't. What makes this an exception?|`|HDyqzvUkaa	I agree that it is extreme contraception.  It's a slippy slop and we may have already gone way to far.   The word "murder" to me brings up a different kind of crime, one i can't necessarily define.    most would agree that we should not try abortionists as murderers|`|X548yCR6aa	Disagree. If that was the case, getting a period is involuntary manslaughter, and masturbation is genocide.|`|BRZBD3cgaa	OMG Abortion is murder! People may use the excuse that abortion isnt murder because it isn't fully developed yet but they are so wrong (in my opinion). If it is growing inside you and is going to grow into a living thing then it is alive and living. If your not ready for a child do not sacrifice an innocent chance of life and maybe hand your baby to a family that is more than ready for a baby and who can give it the love and nourishment it truly needs and deserves.  I strongly disbelieve in abortions. They are waste of technology and science. Child birth is a unique and special natural act of human life.  ACCEPT IT.|`|q5pS9b8Jaa	Murder is defined as to kill with intent. So literally yes.      EDIT: An embryo is not a potential human, it already is. He or she has it's own unique set of chromosomes (and yes, all 46) at single cell zygote. It is not a mass of the mother's cells but that of another human entirely.    EDIT2: Frou Frou is right, if abortion is murder, so can euthanasia be. Though it is consensual.    EDIT3: If someone kills a pregnant woman here in the USA and the fetus dies with her, there are two counts of murder....So unless Sage's point is that the United States isn't a developed country, then he/she is wrong. Besides whether or not a fetus is a person is purely philosophical, regardless a fetus/embryo is a human.|`|2MP9nYLdaa	It is murder|`|7cLYgf2raa	I do not get where anyone religious or non-religious ever gets the idea that any sickness aof any kind is ever God's will.

AA11352649	Jim, you are going over peoples heads with that question. Most people haven't thought about it.  I would argue that the sons of God were not white men since Adam was a son of God and most likely not white.  And the seducing was being done by the sons of God, not the other way around.    From what I have read, the Sons of God were in fact angels - the watchers - and they were having relations with women and forming half-breeds, nephilim, who became the gods of the Greeks, Romans, etc.  God saw that as an abomination and he decided to punish the watchers by casting them out and then flooding the earth to get rid of the nephilim.  Later came the story about the fall of the angels and the whole casting out of heaven thing and the two stories got merged and it turned into a big unexplainable mess.|`|a2bf93c5734dba17c5940009d3b3db80aa	God didn't have any sons or daughters because God is just a spirit.|`|d26ed25ade48458d2e1c9c6933eb220baa	they were angels. that stuff is just racist propaganda. there is no evidence adam was white. according to the Bible|`|AA10155036	They were the fallen angels, or, the i believe the Hebrew word that is used is Naphtali, the sons of fallen angels and women.  they were also called "heroes of old".|`|49e79680294250303072f22e4be532c6aa	all humans on the face of the earth are god's children (thats why he's the heavenly Father)|`|98d3cfd933ba69f8fb1c5e03d11b411daa	Nephilim ... aliens  ...or so say the more coherent non Biblical sources ...|`|AA10124924	I heard another theory that they were giants, or maybe that was the first reference to dinosaurs by early nincompoops|`|AA12225848	Nephilim , in the Bible, Hebrew word of no known meaning, denoting peoples of gigantic stature with superhuman strength. The term is translated as giants in the Authorized Version. The Book of Genesis refers to Nephilim as the offspring of marriages between daughters of humans and sons of God.     Genesis 6:4 it says "the Nephilim were on the earth in those days AND ALSO AFTERWARDS (meaning after the Flood) when the SONS OF GOD went to the daughters of men and had children by them, they were heroes of old, men of renown."     Hebrews 1:5, "For to which of the angels did God EVER say 'You are my Son; today I have  become your Father'." Or again, "I will be his Father, and he will be my Son."  In fact this verse makes it clear that God does not refer to his angels as "Sons."|`|3c7e006db775b8a24a02b4cc912709acaa	Adam and Eve had two boys (Cain & Abel) - Cain Slew Abel. Cain was cast out (to where?) what other civilizations were there? Adam and Eve then had Seth. Seth then fathered Enos, (who mothered Enos?) We are not talking about angels having sex with women. We are talking strictly incest. Mother's and sons, brothers and sisters, there is no other way. After the flood the sons of Noah repopulate the earth. Therefore their children are marrying their sisters and cousins. Again, why isn't this wrong?|`|f45df00862091b90f5f0517eab43e22aaa	We are all Gods children. Keep it simple !|`|AA12242234	This is a very good question and one of little mysteries in the Bible. Like you pointed out, many believers think this refers to angels, but the part about pre Adamic men and a racial difference I believe is wrong.     The Bible doesn't discriminate against races. When in the New Testament it speaks about being "unequally yoked together" some people would ignorantly say this refers to race when in fact it refers to belief. The only "races" the Bible refers to are Jew and Gentile, which when you read the New Testament clearly states that this is a Spiritual Jew (a born-again believer) and an unsaved person.    The Bible also calls born again believers the children of God and unbelievers either children of Satan or children of man. Using this logic, I think it means the "sons of God" were people who believed in God and the "daughters of men" were people who did not believe in God and this resulted in wickedness, which is why God destroyed the earth with a flood.

To fit such a category only one species is known--angels.     According to bible-believing Christian Reincarnationists such as Edgar Cayce, the mating of angels with human animals is what caused the process of reincarnation to begin -- the journey of many, many lifetimes toward perfecting the 'lower' animal within ourselves to the level of the divine which was, of course, 'God''s plan.|`|AA12296394	Same as the Children of God today.

You became an atheist when you were 10 years old, based on ideas of God that you learned in Sunday School. Your ideas about God haven't changed since.   You think that the primary aim of an omnibenevolent God is for people to have FUN.   You believe that extra drippy ice-cream is a logical proof against the existence of God, because an omniscient God would know how to stop the ice-cream from being extra drippy, an omnipotent God would have the ability to stop the ice-cream from being extra drippy, and by golly, an omnibenevolent God wouldn't want your ice-cream to be extra drippy.   Although you've memorized a half a dozen proofs that He doesn't exist, you still think you're God's gift to the ignorant masses.   You believe the astronomical size of the universe somehow disproves God, as if God needed a tiny universe in order to exist.   You think questions like, "Can God create a rock so big that He cannot lift it?" and, "Can God will Himself out of existence?" are perfect examples of how to disprove God's omnipotence and ultimately how to disprove God. When someone proves to you the false logic behind the questions (i.e. pitting God's omnipotence against itself), you desperately try to defend the questions, but then give up and go to a different Christian site to ask them.   Related to the above, you spend a great deal of your spare time writing to Christian websites asking them these very questions.   You declare on a public forum that you are "furious at God for not existing."   You spend hours arguing that a-theism actually means "without a belief in God " and not just " belief that there is no god" as if this is a meaningful distinction in real life.   You consistently deny the existence of God because you personally have never seen him but you reject out of hand personal testimony from theists who claim to have experienced God as a reality in their lives.   You can make the existence of pink unicorns the center-piece of a philosophical critique.   You insist that "the burden of proof is on he that alleges/accuses", and "it's impossible to prove a negative", then state "That's what Christians do. They lie. Their most common lie is that they were once atheists." When reminded about the burden of proof bit, you reply with, "Well, prove Christians don't lie!"   You adamantly believe that the "God of the gaps" idea is an essential tenet of orthodox Christian faith espoused by all the great Christian thinkers throughout history.   When you were a child, someone came down with a deadly disease and prayed and prayed for God to take it away. God did not remove the disease and your friend died. You ask other Christians why they had to die when they were such a nice person and never harmed anyone. Dissatisfied with their answers, you suddenly decide that there is no God and that all Christians are nothing but lying, conniving con artists and hypocrites....all that is except for your friend who died.   You call a view held by less than ten percent of the American public "common sense".   You're a spoiled fifteen year old boy who lives in the suburbs and you go into a chat room to declare that, "I know there is no God because no loving God would allow anyone to suffer as much as I...hold on. My cell phone's ringing."   You attack your fellow atheists, who hold the "belief that there is no god", calling them "liars," and state that, "I do not deny the existence of any god. I just don't believe in any." Then you tell someone that their God is "made up." When someone calls you on this, you state, "I never made such a claim."   Going with the definition of "without a belief in God", you insist that all people are born atheists, and that dogs, cats, rocks, and trees are as well. You make statements like, "My dog is an atheist. Ask him about his lack of belief."   You believe that if something cannot be touched, seen, heard, or measured in some way, then it must not exist, yet you fail to see the irony of your calling Christians "narrow-minded".   You say that there is no God and that those who believe in God do so in blind faith, yet your claim that there is no God also rests on blind faith.   While you don't believe in God, you feel justified on bashing God or attacking those who believe in something that you KNOW doesn't exist, fighting against or even discussing about a non-existent being are the symptoms of mental illness!   You complain when Christians appeal to their emotions when justifying their belief in God yet you feel justified on appealing to your emotions for lack of belief in God.   You blame God for the starvation, sickness, pain and suffering in the world...when, indeed, it is MAN's greed, politics, selfishness and apathy that not only causes, but also ignores the sick and the starving masses. We aren't our brothers' keepers....but we should be.       Origins  You may be a fundy atheist if....    You believe that planes, computers, calculators, compasses, etc, were "all obviously designed," yet the human body, being intricately more complex was "obviously a product of biological evolution." It seems the more complex the apparatus, the more obvious the "fact" that it was not designed.   You claim that evolution and the big bang are two entirely separate theories that explain different aspects of the universe, yet, in what school of learning can you find any real separation or distinction between the two?   As a member of the Skeptic's Society you pride yourself on being skeptical of extraordinary claims. You also pride yourself on silencing everyone who is skeptical of the extraordinary claims of evolution.

Obviously, if it were perfect, God would not have had the reason to chastise Adam and Eve for being disobedient.    In anything, Man himself, makes good things imperfect, and this was proven by the actions of Adam and Eve. From that time on, man has lived in the flesh, seeking refuge through Grace and the promise of repentance and Gods forgiving heart.    I think the only perfection throughout biblical times was the birth of Christ...Christ was perfect...The Greatest Example of Perfection. Man will never achieve perfection until the day of rapture when Christ returns to take his saints to Gods Kingdom, even at that time as the word says, few will find that way...Matthew 7:14 Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.

By the time he was 13, his father had died and his mother had been committed to a mental hospital. After living in a series of foster homes, Malcolm X became involved in the criminal underworld in Boston and New York. In 1945, Malcolm X was sentenced to eight to ten years in prison.    While in prison, Malcolm X became a member of the Nation of Islam. After his parole in 1952, he became one of the Nation's leaders and chief spokesmen. For nearly a dozen years, he was the public face of the Nation of Islam. Tension between Malcolm X and Elijah Muhammad, head of the Nation of Islam, led to his departure from the organization in March 1964.    After leaving the Nation of Islam, Malcolm X made the pilgrimage, the Hajj, to Mecca and became a Sunni Muslim. He traveled extensively throughout Africa and the Middle East. He founded Muslim Mosque, Inc., a religious organization, and the secular, black nationalist Organization of Afro-American Unity.

The Bible, however, gives us a clear portrait of who Satan is and how he affects our lives. Put simply, the Bible defines Satan as an angelic being who fell from his position in heaven due to sin and is now radically opposed to God, doing all in his power to thwart God's purposes for humanity.    Satan was created as a holy angel. Isaiah 14:12 possibly gives Satans pre-fall name as Lucifer. Ezekiel 28:12-14 describes Satan as having been created a cherubim, apparently the highest created angel. He became arrogant in his beauty and status and decided he wanted to sit on a throne above that of God (Isaiah 14:13-14; Ezekiel 28:15; 1 Timothy 3:6). Satans pride led to his fall. Notice the many I will statements in Isaiah 14:12-15. Because of his sin, God barred Satan from heaven.    Satan became the ruler of this world that functions apart from God and the prince of the power of the air (John 12:31; 2 Corinthians 4:4; Ephesians 2:2). He is an accuser (Revelation 12:10), a tempter (Matthew 4:3; 1 Thessalonians 3:5), and a deceiver (Genesis 3; 2 Corinthians 4:4; Revelation 20:3). His very name means adversary or one who opposes. Another name used Satan, the devil, means slanderer.    Even though he was cast out of heaven, he still seeks to elevate his throne above God. He counterfeits all that God does, hoping to gain the worship of the world and foment opposition to God's kingdom. Satan is the ultimate source behind every false cult and world religion. Satan will do anything and everything in his power to oppose God, and those who follow God. However, Satans destiny is sealedan eternity in the lake of fire (Revelation 20:10).|`|6173ede5e3ea0a8b44522ccd89de7fe0aa	Eze 28:13 Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone [was] thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created.

He is the light giver. An angel that (I believe) supplied mankind with light, heat dwelling places / warmth, a souce to cook their food, and a source of renewal.     Flame or fire, for me, is also a metaphor for a greater God Force Energy. When used with carefulness, has helped mankind build things, cook our food, given us warmth and light. Even some naturally occuring fires have been a source of renewal - some trees' seeds actually require the heat from flame in order to initiate growth and clears over packed underbrush.    When in the hands of "questionable" ones, can be a source of destruction.    I do not believe this essence was pushed from heaven as the "so told story" goes. This essence was important for mankind to have in order for survival.     This, I believe, is a different entity than "satan".     Not sure how they became synonomus, but I believe them to be different entities.    My information about this didn't come from the Holy Scriptures, I researched the information online. Then meditated on the information while praying for a better comprehension. And then some of that is just my own logic (like sources that we utilize fire or flame for).|`|SwtaUd56aa	Any scholar would tell you -- and rightly so -- there is not actually any evidence in the Bible that Satan was once a good angel who rebelled against God at the beginning of time.

I would love it if my girlfriend comes up to me, hugs me behind my back, and then tells me that she loves me.

About the roses - guys dont really like it, its more of a thing that guys give girls roses, not the other way around, so your bf might think thats a little bit weird. Hey, just my opinion.    I would take him out for a dance maybe. If you go to school or college, that would be a perfect opportunity!

WRSNIusaaa	No, that's a complete stereotype.    Seriously, most girls can't even take anything bigger than 5 inches.  Not that it matters anyway, all of the sensitive (as in sexual sensitive) parts of a girls sexual organ are within the first couple of inches anyway.    Some girls are really hung up on it, but they are definitely the minority. In reality, it doesn't really matter (unless it's like freakishly small like  half an inch or something).

If you do this right, she'll be so happy about how much thought he put into it, and it'll probably stay under 40 dollars.

Trouble upon trouble has come upon this generation, until many wonder just what will come next. Great fear has overtaken the earths inhabitants. They know some great catastrophe is impending and that they are powerless to stop it. Terrible disasters have already taken place and more are yet to follow. Amid all this the faithful Christians are the objects of intense universal hatred, and yet they are counseled not to be discouraged or frightened. Concerning the time of the end of this world, in which we have been since A.D. 1914, their Master said: And when you hear of wars and disturbances, do not be scared; these have to come first, but the end is not at once. (Luke 21:9, Moffatt) And previous to that prophecy he had said to them: Fear not, you little flock, for your Fathers delight is to give you the Realm, that is, the Kingdom.Luke 12:32, Moff.|`|wwdllMzYaa	yes and no  life is life    its scary, but natural    nature is scary, life is scary, peopel are scary, societyis scary, and death is scary  but, we are alive, so if we are gonna be scared of EVEYRTING,we will be scared a lot, far too much to enjoy any life    so be scared ofscary things, but also try to rationalise that you cant change what has happened, you can only change your reaction to it

RC5RAzykaa	1st John 5:3  For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.     Jesus is God here is one of His Commandments:    Mark 12:31  And the second [is] like, [namely] this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.     "As thyself"  a tough Commandment, it means that we are to do all those things for our neighbor that we would do for ourselves.   This includes the things you have mentioned.     Helping people out shows the Love of God.    Personally I believe it is not good to tell others the things we have done for others, it is prideful.    Matthew 6:2 Therefore when thou doest [thine] alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.     I will not tell you and the rest of the world the things I have done in service to others.  Far as I am concerned, y'all are free to believe I have done nothing.   For I do not wish to lose my reward.    Matthew 6:1  Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.     I will tell you this however, I have not done enough.

zgL6vMCiaa	Praise be to Allaah.     Note that the things people see in their sleep may come under one of two categories :     1  Dreams/visions     2  Confused dreams     Confused dreams in turn are divided into two categories:     1  The Shaytaans attempts to frighten     2  The workings of the subconscious.     So it may be said that what people see in their dreams may be divided into three categories:     1- Visions or dreams that come from Allaah.    2- Attempts by the Shaytaan to frighten us    3- The workings of the subconscious.     These categories are indicated by the hadeeth narrated in Saheeh Muslim (no. 2263) from Abu Hurayrah, which says that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: When the time (of the Day of Resurrection) draws near, a believer's dream will hardly be false. And the truest vision will be of one who is himself the most truthful in speech, for the vision of a Muslim is the forty-fifth part of Prophecy, and dreams are of three types:     the good dream which is glad tidings from Allah;     the bad dream which causes distress, which is from the Shaytaan;     and the dream which represents what a person is thinking about.    So if any one of you sees a dream which he does not like he should get up and pray, and not tell people about his dream     It was narrated from Awf ibn Maalik that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Dreams are of three types: some are terrifying things from the Shaytaan, aimed at causing grief to the son of Adam; some are things that a person is concerned with when he is awake, so he sees them in his dreams; and some are a part of the forty-six parts of Prophecy.    (Saheeh Sunan Ibn Maajah, 3155)     It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Dreams are of three types: glad tidings from Allaah, what is on a persons mind, and frightening dreams from the Shaytaan. If any of you sees a dream that he likes, let him tell others of it if he wishes, but if he sees something that he dislikes, he should not tell anyone about it, and he should get up and pray.    (Saheeh Sunan Ibn Maajah, 3154)     There follow a number of saheeh ahaadeeth which describe how to deal with what one sees in ones dream.     1  It was narrated that Abu Qutaadah said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Good dreams come from Allaah and bad dreams come from the Shaytaan. If anyone sees a bad dream that scares him, let him spit drily to his left and seek refuge with Allaah from its evil, then it will not harm him.    (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3292)     2  It was narrated that Abu Salamah said: I used to see such terrible dreams that that I began to shake and have a fever, but did not cover myself with a cloak until I met Abu Qutaadah, and I mentioned that to him. He said, I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say, Good dreams come from Allaah and bad dreams come from the Shaytaan. If anyone sees a bad dream that he dislikes, let him spit drily to his left three times and seek refuge with Allaah from its evil, then it will not harm him.    (Narrated by Muslim, 2261)     3  It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: If any one of you sees a dream that he dislikes, let him turn over, and spit drily to his left three times and ask Allaah of His goodness, and seek refuge with Him from its evil.    (Saheeh Sunan Ibn Maajah).     4  It was narrated from Jaabir that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: If any one of you sees a dream that he dislikes, let him spit drily to his left three times and seek refuge with Allaah from the Shaytaan three times, and turn over onto his other side.    (Narrated by Muslim, 2262).     5  The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us the difference between good dreams and bad dreams. It was narrated from Abu Saeed al-Khudri that he heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: If any one of you sees a dream that he likes, it is from Allaah, so let him praise Allaah for it and tell people about it. But if he sees something other than that, that he dislikes, it is from the Shaytaan, so let him seek refuge with Allaah from its evil and not mention it to anyone, for it will not harm him.     (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 7045).     So it is clear that good dreams come from Allaah and bad dreams which a person dislikes come from the Shaytaan, so he has to seek refuge with Allaah from their evil.     6  It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: If any one of you sees something that he dislikes, let him get up and pray, and not tell people about it.    (Narrated by Muslim, 2263).     7  It was narrated from Jaabir that a Bedouin came to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said, I dreamt that my head was cut off and I was chasing it. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) rebuked him and said: Do not tell anyone how the Shaytaan is messing about with you in your dreams.     (Narrated by Muslim, 2268)     So we may sum up from these ahaadeeth the most important points about what a person should do if he sees a dream that he dislikes, as follows:     1- He should know that this dream is from the Shaytaan who wants to cause him grief, so he should annoy the Shaytaan by not paying any attention to him.    2- He should seek ref|`|AYs6iFlLaa	Add me and see my Q's on this topic I was given some good answers.

Dreams are either from Allah or from Shaytaan..    You would have to go to a professional dream interpretor (A Muslim)    I warn u sister that if u tell any1 about a bad dream it is very likely to come true, so u should keep any bad dream quiet, and not even tell ur husband...If it is a good dream then u can tell the people u love and TRUST...otherwise u should be quiet..    If his father is there in the dream then it means that your husband needs to pray to allah to forgive his father, his father is asking his son to pray for him...    His mother may be still sad because of what happened to his father...but every1 must make dua and pray for him that allah gives him peace...    Also dreams after Fajr are made up by the mind and are not true (if it was maybe he is just worried about them before but didnt realise) The real dreams are before fajr..    Remember Dreams are serious and i recommend u dont ask people people who "guess" because it is dangerous to misinterpret a dream..    (Narrated by Muslim, 2261)     3  It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: If any one of you sees a dream that he dislikes, let him turn over, and spit drily to his left three times and ask Allaah of His goodness, and seek refuge with Him from its evil.    But remember this is for the bad dreams...    Peace
xfmMeJx0aa	Well, considering that during the period that Jesus existed or was purported to have existed there were many self proclaimed messiahs, it is more then likely that someone would have taken his place in religious following. It certainly isn't an unreasonable assertion that someone else would have taken his place considering that the only thing that made him different from other self proclaimed messiahs was he got the most word of mouth press at the time.

The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16.

Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26.

He is the ALL-POWERFUL Spirit THAT CREATED ALL THE OTHER SPIRITS.  Also Jehovah is not the Holy Spirit because of what Mathew 12: 31,32 says ,  Every sort of sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the holy spirit will not be forgiven. For example, whoever speaks a word against the Son of man it will be forgiven him, but whoever speaks against the holy spirit, it will not be forgiven him, no, not in this system of things nor in that to come.|`|HWoLbR7Aaa	Awww... you guys are so cute when you argue over your little book.|`|zZxX5PXBaa	Why would anyone take the trouble to respond to a question when they're addressed in such a rude, disrespectful fashion as this?

How have you benefited yourself by going back to a religion that teaches lies like hellfire, immortality of the soul, etc. You are like a dog that has returned to it's vomit and like a pig to it's mire just as it says at 2 Peter 2:20-22: "Certainly if, after having escaped from the defilements of the world by an accurate knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they get involved again with these very things and are overcome, the final conditions have become worse for them than the first. 21?For it would have been better for them not to have accurately known the path of righteousness than after knowing it accurately to turn away from the holy commandment delivered to them. 22?The saying of the true proverb has happened to them: The dog has returned to its own vomit, and the sow that was bathed to rolling in the mire.
wLLzL8Traa	You could go to the dollar store and get a lot of gifts, wrap each one in valentine paper, put numbers in a bowl and let each person pick a number, then each person in order picks a gift and the first  person gets to see if he wants the next person's gift and so on but your gift can only be taken twice. Or either tell each person to bring a dollar gift  and just have a grab bag.  Either way it is fun. Another game let people guess how many 3 letter or more words they can get from the word Valentine. and the kids can play pin the word LOVE on the Valentine.  and have a gift for all the kids no matter what they get.

xfmMeJx0aa	Since every individual is different, it would highly depend on the kind of punishment, degree of punishment, and extent of punishment. There of course begs to question what a person did to deserve punishment and if the punishment is an equal response to the act. Reforming someone, however, should not automatically mean punishment. Therapy, for example, isn't punishment but can be used to reform a substance abuser. I should also note that no punishment can reform someone unwilling to reform.|`|WF085j2Daa	punshiment rarely if ever reforms it simply drives things out of sight to emerge when the threat of punishment is least likely to recur|`|ridu0Rtwaa	Treat a man as he appears to be, and you make him worse. But treat a man as if he were what he potentially could be, and you make him what he should be. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|`|2h8tqOeFaa	No not all only the stubborn and ignorant needs it, others just need wisdom or education to put them on the right track..|`|AA10852244	some cases yes other no.|`|C1SOqQSkaa	Punishment is an atavism - an instinctive reaction to a perceived wrong or bad behaviour. It satisfies the victim to some extent, but its effect on the punishee is more complex.    If the one who commits the wrongdoing has respect for the punisher, the lesson may be learned. If not, the wongdoer may simply conclude that his victim is despicable and deserved to be wronged.    Formal societal punishment has this problem, as seen by the high recidivism rates of convicted criminals.|`|wz8gx3gaaa	Its depend on person to person and circumstances.  It is not a blanket thing that there should only be punishment or there should only be counselling.|`|U7sBZKUuaa	I guess that depends on the person.|`|7cLYgf2raa	When My children were young and said"no", a swift crack on the butt put an end to that for sure.|`|nsl2qv0aaa	It has always worked for me.  I hate it, but it works for me.|`|f8mLpPXlaa	Yes. you've got to get their attention first.|`|3lMujNUZaa	I believe so.  The punishment should fit the crime.  The idea of punishment is to make a person aware that they are responsible for their actions.  It does not always reform a person, the fact that jails contain repeat offenders is proof of that.  However for the majority of people they pay there debt to society and never offend again.  Also, the concept of "paying your debt to society" is a valid one as punishment is used as a deterrent to re-offend, thereby making society safer for all.|`|GqPHkGHxaa	if really realises the mistake & ready to help the people whom he has hurted then no need,else he has to be punished,even if we dont punish,nature(or god) will do it,as it a universal rule,life is like a newtons 3rd law,for every actin therre is an equal & opposite reaction|`|e7MWLISZaa	i think that teaching the person about the rights and wrongs on the particular issue and telling him about the consequences of his wrongdoings which he will have to suffer is a better way of reforming a person than a punishment|`|eFkdCBjkaa	It's a fact that most punished people only get worse. A person that reforms, does it because they want to.|`|lnsNN93oaa	Maybe sometimes.

It's crude but can be effective.|`|AA11102296	yes, of course if the person is a criminal. otherwise it depends.|`|yxIzm2dqaa	Punishment focuses  on the past wrong.  Discipline on the other hand, focuses on future conduct.  It is up to the individual if they will see the consequences of their actions as punishment of discipline.  I don't think punishment reforms anyone but discipline can transform them.|`|zD0lCK5Kaa	Yes.

Fear of the punishment is supposed to restrain people from doing wrong. Infliction of the punishment is simply to prove that we weren't bluffing!    I guess it can reform, in the sense that the punishment was so awful, the person fears if happening again, and so won't do what they did another time.|`|3gMytPXhaa	Only love enough to reform a person.
CXwR2ta3aa	Firstly, anyone who says "you can't learn it" is a moron.    Secondly, there is no easy way; it is a difficult language and will take time. Be prepared for this. It's not something you'll take care of in a year or two, but it is absolutely a learnable language.    So, how serious are you? If you are dead-set on it, here's some genuine, real advice for truly learning Korean (not my advice, but rather that of a professor who spent 9 years in Korea for no other reason than to learn the language. I've linked his site in the list of sources below)::    http://how-to-learn-any-language.com/for...    Once you get past the so-called basics, you might try supplementing your studies with www.lingq.com. They unfortunately don't yet have Korean available, but you can still use it to learn the language just by choosing another in the meantime (you'll see what I mean when you start checking it out).    All the best, and if you have any questions or problems, come along to the How-to-learn-any-language website and pose a question there. Quite a number of people there have at least some experience in tackling this wonderful, mammoth of a language!|`|ivPHFhWvaa	heya, try these languages sites.    www.italki.com    www.livemocha.com    www.myhappyplanet.com    you get to meet people with similar language interests that are compatible to your needs. Perhaps he/she needs to practice his/her english and can teach you korean, etc.People on these sites usually send messages to each other on the site, exchange emails, get on Skype together to have a voice chat, etc. (www.skype.com) Skype is excellent for learning a new language, especially for korean because its a language which requires you to listen to the sounds of the various korean characters to learn more accurate pronunciation. It'll be great to have a mic, particularly when you're on skype. Besides all these, you can try listening to korean songs and refer to the lyrics to get used to the language's sound,accent and writing, etc. You can watch korean dramas too, they're very popular where i live. Lastly, get an english-korean dictionary and add the korean language to your computer's language bar to type in korean. have fun~|`|Ysnbesz4aa	Try www.sharedtalk.com is from the Rosetta Stone company. You can talk to people who speak Korean and learn from them. It's helped immensely with my spanish skills.|`|7KKFRKNmaa	none. it's really difficult
ivPHFhWvaa	yes i think so, but i'm not entirely sure. So far, the hanja characters i've seen and understood from chinese are consistent with the meaning in korean. If you were to study a little of chinese to help you with korean, its the fan ti zi (-traditional chinese characters) that you should look at. The simplified chinese characters look different and may be a little confusing.Hope i helped a teensy bit.
JAqeuAjoaa	I'm glad to see that you are thinking about his feelings and the possible drama that you could cause if you were to be too hasty with this.     I think that the best way to go about this is to ask him his name first of all. Then ask how old he is because that's important too. Get to know him a couple of times. And then after getting to know him, ask if he has a girlfriend. If he says yes, that is your answer. If he says no, ask if he has a boyfriend. If he gets offended that is your answer. If he does not react to you asking if he has a boyfriend, just come out and ask if he's gay.    Be Well.|`|vJqPsEsWaa	Yeah, I would've told you to ask if he's gay, but some are offended. To avoid drama, you have to be discreet my friend. Go over there & talk to him. For example, when he's on his break, go ask him what time it is & sit next to him. Ask him what his name is, when he gets off, if he likes his job, what else he does, his education, relations, ambitions... I'm thinking this might work out very well, especially since he stares at you as mush as you mentioned! Just be cool, don't be shy & just sitting here asking about it might lead to regret for not actually doing it! Good luck & take care :)|`|afkygHMgaa	Why not get the phone number of that McDonalds and call him? Either that or ask for a job application and when he hands it to you just say "No the application was for you...to fill the job as my boyfriend" LOL Ha!
SsEAvhs7aa	A sexual orientation is quite fluid so it might vary a little in your lifetime. But it's not enough to be a complete change of orientation. Freud said we were all bisexual to some extend, and it was confirmed by the Kinsey scale. So you may move in a direction or the other on that scale, but certainly not from one opposite to the other.|`|vDG0iA8laa	The latter is very possible as well as probable..It's the old cliche of "You've had the best - now try the rest"...  Necessity was the mother of invention, so experimentation does go on. And needless to say the Internet has brought about many of these long "hidden" secrets and desires to the forefront - be it good, bad or indifferent.. (the pun on the last word wasn't fully intended - lalalala)  Regards,  Rachelle In High Heels|`|nQW1MSMpaa	I think for some that sexuality can be fluid, but for others, they have just been very closeted. It is difficult to say for certain.    Some might just be closeted bisexuals.|`|dsM5nkSfaa	I don't really know. I guess it would be like liking purple for a while then preferring red. Some preferences change and some don't, I'm really not sure about sexuality and I don't think it really does change.    That could be wrong for some people, though.|`|kVTryKlBaa	I think we subdue our real desires.    I also think that our desires change as we grow older.  What turned us on in our teenage years, evolves as we grow older as well.|`|4HClQObFaa	It could be either.    I am happily married and was gay before I met my wife.    I'd say I was always gay or bi but just suppressed it for forty years. Now I say I'm gay but Sylvia says I must be a bit bi and I have to agree she's right.    On the other hand I know several people who are married and gay but who didn't know they were gay before they married.    So it could be change, it could be realisation or it could be that they've always been gay but suppressed it.|`|AA10744842	they sexual preference has change over time , my has hun . i like women then as i transition ,i more into women because i les.|`|vJqPsEsWaa	I think by the time you are married, you should have already discovered your sexuality. Sometimes; however, people deny their sexuality for various reasons (mainly social) & live a lie just to satisfy the status quo. At some point, if a man who's married to a woman knows he has attraction toward the same sex, then he's going to come out as gay or bi eventually. I think it's very unlikely that sexuality changes throughout a person's life span. It's denial.|`|AA11589320	As a general rule no we cant just change.  Yet I knew a man who did at 40 experience a total change. So its possible, just not common.|`|MfoQc8wdaa	They might have had inclinations before but never acted upon them because they were single and their experimentation level was at an all time high... But when you begin to settle down into a stable marriage (which is happy but gets routine after a while) your old self starts getting restless and starts pursuing those previously dormant feelings.    So I'd say yes its possible to experience a shift in what people find sexually attractive.. Moreover it can happen anytime...|`|swkhohjgaa	I don't believe so. I think they were always in denial

I prayed to Jesus, and to the Father as if they were two individuals. But the dawn reached me in prayer and on the 13th of July, 1998 (it was Tuesday), the Father revealed himself to me. Now these are the things that happened to me on that instant:    I disappeared from one location, and I found myself in another place adjascent to it. My gesture was changed. I was now clothed in a white shining robe. My voice was increasing in tone to that of the Father's Voice. And scales began to fall from my eyes, and then the Spirit Dimension was openned to me in all its totality. Immediately, a door was opened unto me, the door was the Christ who is the Son, and as I get in, I became one with the Father, I began to shouth with a Father's Voice and with a Father gesture and said: "I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. I was he who died and rose again, and now, I am alive forevermore". Suddenly the Father Spoke in me and said, "I will show you how I see the World and all that I have created". Immediately I saw all things together and in a unison of consciousness and the Father had united his mind with mine, and I became a living manifestation of the omnipresent and the omniscient God. And I said, "Father, you see the World as a man with many eyes!" And immediately, I was amazed when he showed me of my oneness in his omnipotence, then on that level, ho made me one in the sense of his eternity, -his never ending existence, then I found myself to have lived before the foundation of the World, and I became identical to the Word of God, -the living Word. And then I would again disappear from one place and appear in another, as I was simultaneous in all substance and in all creation in the world, both the visible and th realms and places and the dimensions of the invisible. I sensed that the whole world have its existence because of the Word, and now that they existed by the Word, they were held by the life of the Word, and that is why I can understand on that perspective that the Spirit have a corporate supremacy over creation, and have seen all things and there is nothing hidden in his sight, both the known and the unknown. He is in the life of every creation, man, things, living things and none living things, in all dimensions. The Word held its existence. And the Spirit designed its corporate expressions and forms, and the variety of its appearances and manifestations. And then the Father finally showed me the realm of himself and was about to show me a manifestation of Himself totally in me. I disappeared again in a sudden, and I was filled with wonder and awe and great inexplainable feelings and sensation as the Father was bringing me in trasition to be one in all of his consciousness, presence, knowledge, power, glory and dimesion, and perfection. Where there is each one of the manifestation of the men that were born of old, and now being made perfect in the Spirit, and where there are the angels of God where each were not something and someone physically apart from the Spirit of God that connects all things and everything, there I found myself in the realm of th invisible, and it was the best and the most awesome things I saw and I experienced, but now I have to decide to return to give an account of living evidence to all creation and to all people as far as the Spirit of the Lord brings me, to testify and to be his living witness, "that our light afflections which are momentary are working for us a far more, and exceeding eternal weight of glory, while we do now look on things that are seen, but at the unseen things, for the things that are not seen are incorruptible and eternal of which exceeds in importance the the visible nature of the things that do appear". Then there was no way I could return to the realm of the earth and of Mankind outside the will of the Father, that I had to plea him and ask, (for what thing can the Father never give to his Son, even the power to lay down his life for his friends, and to bring it up again), then I asked him and I said in the language that was strange to me at that time, (for I am a Filipino and was no american) and I said, "Father, show me back the veil towards the earth..." Then almost by a sudden, the Father gave me a gradual return to a human consciousness with a perfect descent from the divine majesty. Then I appeared again in the flesh. The Spirit was within me, and I was yet able to do all things just as the Spirit wills, (all omnipotence). I had to call to a person nearby and said to him while he was sleeping deeply, "Brother, wake up, I have a good news to you. Arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you." Then the Father said to me: "He can not hear you, and you are in the Spirit! And then I prayed the Father that he will make me come into the perfect person that I was before and as human as before. And immediately, I disappeared again, and the Father made me revealed in some distant place, and then all that he is was like a robe with the Spirit, who took itself out from me and it was as if I was undressed in sensation. I can feel the great Spirit's Eternal Weight. And it is beyond measure. I can feel how heavy it was. I had disrobed from the majestic Word of Life, and became empty. I have become like a Son of God being emptied of the Glory that the wonders of God might be seen and that there would be room for a more vigorous manifestations of proving by the Holy Spirit and by the will of God. And then I found myself dressed with the dress that I had before, and with the blanket with square colors of white and red on my shoulders covering my back. I was wearing a short pant with a green polo shirt that had the emblem of an eagle at the back. then I was again a lean young man running towards my mother's house, leaping and prasing God. I was ready for the testimony. And now, I made the word to see the awesome thing that the Lord has don

If drug use did not become the only thing in a users life, it may be more accepted.  Alcohol is a good example.  Some people can drink and then not drink for months, but others live only to drink.  This tends to happen more with other drugs.  Alcoholics = Junkies.|`|AA11180062	Look at your atrocious spelling, assuming you indulge in psychadelics and such, it's ******* you up, foo...

You can never recreate the circumstances in which it was actioned - yes, there are some psychotics out there that just kill for the 'fun' of it, but there's something wrong with these people, and government mental health sectors should be intervening WAY before the time that these people committ crimes.   But that being said, there are some people who are just so disgusting you can't imagine the world getting any better while they're still in it.  What does taking anyone's life do to help you?  It doesn't.  You may have the superficial benefit of revenge, and lap that up for a while, but in a long run, nothing you can ever do to the person who harmed your loved one will bring them back, and that is the sad and painful truth.  How is it justice when it doesn't give you what you really desire?|`|AA12334776	they should be sent to the shu in the supermax 4ever and ever|`|91893d2927a01f5540620c32effbdb98aa	Yes, my vote would go to ANY politician who would crack down on violent offenders.  If they don't get the death penalty, then they should be kept in a 6x6 room, hosed down and fed bread and water for the rest of their life.  How dare a confessed or convicted murderer, child molester, or rapist get rights to anything that they want in life.  Any crime toward an innocent child should result in immediate dungeon life in chains.  Or maybe the government could just drop all of them off on an island and let justice prevail.  How much cheaper it would be to buy some land off in the ocean where an occasional helicopter ride would observe any attempted swimmers.  Why are violent offenders treated like a human when obviously they are animals?|`|eb6cee58079e982748402a8738b6f119aa	oh yeah!|`|f9640e49184958283e92553925e5397eaa	I fully agree with you, but we are supposed to be a civilized nation.... We just can't go around "cutting people's head's off with chainsaws" or whatever, just because that is what they did.... It would make us no better than the homicidal maniacs.     I do, however, feel that if we brought back public hangings, there would be a lot less crime. It would make them think about it, perhaps.....|`|c547141bde9da958c8154f79ebaa0ad6aa	No I don't believe serial killers should be put to death in any form or fashion!! I do believe they have no feelings or a conscience;but no one likes to to locked up for the rest of their lives!!! They should build a special prison for them. you know in the Vincent Price style!!! Brick them up in the walls with a slot big enough to put eight ounces of water in twice a day and a slice of moldy bread every three days. They don't feel like like normal people do.  They have no idea of the pain and suffering they have inflicted on their victims.  Or the agonizing grief and suffering by the victims families and society as a whole!!! We need to remember that they have no human attributes!!!They would most likely feel no remorse at the time of their death by execution. It takes 46 days to starve to death and 3 days to die from dehydration. So no water on weekends, a slice of rotten bread 3 times a week,no toilet, and locked in a 3X 3 brick hole encased in titanium steel with no human contact. I am quite sure they will be begging God's forgiveness, death for these creatures is too good. They are lower than the lowest species of any animal on earth.I have lost a friend to one of these monsters so I have no pity!!! I just know that to be locked in a tiny hell hole for the rest of my life would have a serious effect on my mental health!!! I am positive it would make one of those monsters suffer too!!!|`|2ff8c2b9fb48d9015ba74f7753b5e136aa	HELL YEAH! they should die the way they killed|`|ecde0c77d2cc4632eb7d28b2528ca3ccaa	No. They should be set free.|`|326d87a2fb18c39a47a79888651f55aeaa	YES!!!!!!!!

I think actually this would be the perfect job for me.   handing out there punishments and suplying video tapes of the torture sessions to the victims familys so maybe it would feel like a bit of Justice was served...  Better yet Put it on PAY per View to compensate the familys involved and help to cover there court costs.
98bd8e0a2356492bde44c1bb6002b891aa	I think a tolerant society of diversity.  If we are tolerant of others' diversity, then in a way we are still sharing the same spirituality, but in a different sense.  We might pray to a different god, or follow a different pattern of belief's, but we are still the same in that we believe in something, even if it's just ourselves.   difference is what breeds growth and knowledge.  Without that, I dont think we could progress in society.|`|12a0bfec1d3e0322e7b7e374e5735b3baa	Everyone will never all believe in the same thing and some group will always think there better.|`|fbdad2836b12a55aac5a35bcb551f09caa	This may surprise  you, but God does support a modified version of diversity. You see, God looks on the inside of a person and sees their heart and he loves everyone. And he gives us free will, to choose or reject Him.    Isn't that what diversity is about? Accepting people, not because of their skin color, but for what they can bring of value to others and appreciating each other for our unique and special gifts and personality?    But in terms of a shared spirituality, I would not want to have to change my own beliefs to please everyone else, so I would have a real issue with a shared spirituality, because not everyone believes the same, and it would be difficult to come up with a shared concept that everyone could accept.|`|ba61ee2760dadedc80c5ec7d12d67967aa	Tolerance.  Everyone has their different skew on belief, EVERYONE.  It would be far easier for people to accept and tolerate each other than to try to come to a "common belief."    However, Christians (I'm not 100% on any other religions) have this idea of "common belief" - when everyone agrees that indeed, Christianity is correct.  I'm thinking Muslims possibly follow this thought as well; perhaps even Jews?  I'm not sure.  But anyways.    As long as those groups that believe in "shared spirituality" continue to wait for and strive to achieve that state of being, there will be no tolerant society.    So the world's kind of stuck where it is, I think.  Unless people all start changing their minds and forsaking the religion they know, to create a worldwide change.    I don't think anything will change.  It's been this way for a long time, at least since modern, documentable history.|`|AA12357988	Tolerance.  I do believe that there is something to be learned from each religion, practicer, or not.  I do not practice many religions but I have found good lessons in most.|`|AA12343985	A tolerant society of diversity.  It is good to have other opinions and beliefs to study to constantly expand our awareness and our consciousness.  We don't have to agree, but awareness is good.
AA11944625	Yeah, that happens to me sometimes too.  It's not a glitch.  Is your account set to view all English questions or just questions from your country?  That may be part of the difficulty.      What happens is that thousands of people are submitting questions all day.  If you're viewing all the questions written in English, you get all of the questions.  Then, if you don't go through the pages fast enough, you're doomed to see the same questions over and over again.    Ways to limit the repitition:    1) Set viewing options to view questions from your country only.         (look in the left-hand column.  Under "catergories" is "related        links".  Under "related links" is the option to choose which        questions you view).  2) Do as the other person said.  View by number of answers    Hope this helps.|`|f005983d8c4908c03021a87774d6b3f5aa	Sorry. I haven't noticed that problem.  I know Yahoo has a lot of other glitches as well.

I do that instead of clicking next question.
AA10449889	Greetings!...In reference to your comments,permit me to say that YOU are CORRECT! Christ NEVER begged people to "get saved" and neither did the Apostles! Salvation is an individual matter...GOD is neither JUDGING OR CONDEMNING people! All wil be given a fair hearing later. In the meantime, all should QUIT IRRITATING OTHERS WHO DO NOT AT THIS TIME SHARE YOUR VIEWS! Christ loved all He met! And He never made them feel low by brow beating them with condemnation! He saved THAT for the "religious" of His day!...Oh,by the way...I am a Christian. Thanks for your refreshing honesty!|`|805f9b66182fb96f03d070cbd8236e76aa	as you should too.|`|c7c9ae13117797de6a025c29cf9c6443aa	Everyone is free to express their religion and beliefs any way they choose and you can't tell them otherwise.|`|ddfccc9ff13a03a9c74364c90d3cf7b8aa	Hey, not all Christians are bad.  I'm a Christian, and do you know what that means?  I'm a sinner, I'm no better than anyone else in the eyes of God, I have no business judging other people, I have no say in who goes to Heaven or Hell, but my actions will determine whether I go to Heaven or Hell so I better make sure I have it right instead of telling others where they have it wrong.  As for the conservative Christians you mention, many of them don't practice what they preach, so just remember that God will deal with them if they don't repent and if they try to judge you then tell them to re-read Matthew Chapter 7.|`|AA12105884	http://www.godisimaginary.com/index.htm|`|932dcbe9f45e92a954d04c50be3d2e9eaa	Your question is as intolerant as the Christians you are condeming. Look to your own backyard and leave others to theirs.|`|AA12095932	Christianity? Jesus? Dying?    What is the Imacculate Conception supposed to mean?     (NOT A VIRGIN BIRTH! - betcha never knew that.)    Jesus, the basis of Christianity? .    If Jesus died, he could NOT have been God.    Gods do not die? Do they?    If Jesus 'died' on Friday and 'undied' on Sunday, what else besides Saturday was sacrificed?     Did Jesus give up Saturday for us? Big deal!    If Jesus died for our sins, there should not be any more sins, else why go through with it?.    If Jesus really DIED, he should be dead, dead, dead!     If you swallow this stuff, you are not going to like the folks who don't. You want them to swallow it too.     Christians want everyone to convert to their non-thinking in order to be 'saved'.    Believing and not thinking is like choosing a mental illness and becoming lost.|`|395ba13b6215bd11920db288b39e6959aa	Everyone should be free to express their religious views as long as they don't push it on others.    Example... Personally, I have no problem with homosexuals and have at least one gay friend. If I met a Christian that did not feel the same way.... if they say "That's just not how I feel." Fine, no problem. But if they start to tell me about how that's the devil's work and quoting scripture (from the Hebrew Scriptures too. Why is it they never quote Jesus? Hmmmm....) Those people I just tell to go away.|`|7e1bdcbe0ed3b3ff3dce444baf63a57aaa	MATTHEW 7:21  NOT EVERYONE WHO SAYS TO ME,  LORD,LORD SHALL ENTER THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN, BUT HE WHO DOES THE WILL OF MY FATHER IN HEAVEN|`|7a241078c75b85537fadc6d87c94fb25aa	why are you so angry with us? Because you have no self control of your flesh and live like an animal by instinct? Sorry that I would like to keep myself for my husband and not be a loose hoe. Its weird that that would bother someone. Hrmmm. Depressed or full of self hate much? You cant find anything better to do then to talk trash over a computer to people who have found a reason to live. Wow, is that what life is like without Jesus?    As far as Matthew 7 goes, take a look at it closer:  3 And why do you look at the speck in your brothers eye, but do not consider the plank in your own eye? 4 Or how can you say to your brother, Let me remove the speck from your eye; and look, a plank is in your own eye? 5 Hypocrite! First remove the plank from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brothers eye.    Note in verse 5 hes is calling them hipocrites. Thats who he is talking to, the hipocrites. Then He goes on to say First remove.... then you will see clearly to remove.....    So he isn't saying 'dont call sin sin, or dont judge wrong from right. He is saying dont be quick to call something sin and judge someone else if you yourself are doing it.

Vedic scriptures like the "Ramayana" ,Muhabbarata (Bhagavad Gita -a section of this perhaps you were trying to name ), the Upanishads ...are a wide body of sacred scriptures ...perhaps you'd do better looking into some of them, instead of seeking an encapsulation .."Eknath Easwaran"'s translations of 'Upanishads' and 'The Bhagavad Gita' are excellent ...      However I'll try and address this a bit ...a branch of Hinduism developed that was called the "Tantrikas" ... This branch believed that there are heavens and hells that we go to as temporal places of reward and punishment ... but that only here on earth and in incarnation can we seek enlightenment, and the resolutions to problems of consciousness ...      Within this context ... "the devas" are celestial beings very similar to the JudaeoChristian motiff of angels ...      As it is believed that every individual is a microreflection of the sum total of macrocreation ...It was the habit of the Tantrika to map the universe on to the body centers ...       Ganesha is earthy ...and rules the loin chakra called "Muladhara" ...      In this science of selfstudy, and meditation ... it is believed that a yogin can by practicing "abstinence" for a period of time ...cause sexual energy to go up the spine and open higher subtle bodies (in the sense that each inward center- such as "Muladhara" is an inward "subtle body") ...such as the Third eye ..."Ajna" ...      This is a very deep subject ...the critics who want to be dismissive rather than delving it ...simply make crude superficial sociological observations ... The Hindus described the Big Bang as the MahaPralaya some 5000 years ago ...

Los Angeles is good for people who like glitz and glamour and enjoy the party life. Also, if you work in entertainment, L.A. is the best city for you in California. San Diego, on the other hand, is more laid-back, and slightly more conservative (but it's still California, so "conservative" isn't really conservative). They're both expensive, so don't let price be the deciding factor.    In NYC, everybody can find a place.

Don't pay anyone- that would be siily ...       Hebrew is a 22 glyph consonantal alphabet ...6th to seventh century little markings were added to inflect vowels ...      despite being consonantal some of the glyphs are similar to our vowels ...      I don't have a Hebraic font ...but you should be able to find these easily ..      Kaph is a (K) sound ,I would not suggest the "Chith" which is more a harsh "Ch" ...additionally you could add another "Yod" between K and M ...but that would not really flow like natural Hebrew ...so Mem is (M) ..."Beth" is "B" ..."Resh" is "R" ;note again I left the schwa simply inflected ...and "lamed" for "L" and "Yod" for the final y ...

0bb5839670da04a9646535ee7c5718deaa	The "creation" of the devil is actually not the creation of a "devil."  It's actually the creation of angels.  When God did that he created heavenly beings that have many of the similar traits that humans do.  The most important of those is free will.  Angels like humans have the ability to reject God and think that they are equals to God.  Satan use to be Lucifer the angel of light.  However, he rejected God and took 1/3 of the angels with him.  It's not mentioned in the bible because it doesn't pertain to people.  Why would we need to know what day God created  an angel?  The fact that the devil exists does not show that there are multiple gods.  Rather it shows that humans are not alone in showing rejection of God.|`|98d3cfd933ba69f8fb1c5e03d11b411daa	Most of your answerers are just "parroting Milton,Dante,Aquinas or Book of Enoch"....Big yawn ...    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|041c042e4e99a3345a670879429a201baa	God did created the Devil, but not on the days as mentioned.    Actually, God did not created the devil, but Lucifer, the chief angel of worship.  But he was full of 'self' and wanted to be like God, and was cast down to earth.  Thus, he ends us here and created chaos.    Satan is not omnipresence as God.|`|46069e773d546ea04e9020d84f2e8072aa	well firstly God is not Omnipresest.....if he was do u think ppl would still be killing each other. and the reference to the devil is actually ourself. greed, anger, lust, ego and attachment are the devils inside of us...they are "maya" which means illusion.|`|f0af84a991f239ec490a958d15ac15fcaa	gg's right. Lucifer, Satan, Beezubel, w/e u want 2 call him was once an angel, thought he wasa better than God, and God said im, "Im not wasting my time on him. St.Michael, gather your army and give em hell." st.Michael knew he wasnt as powerful as God, and if God damned the fallen angels, it would have been like arnold scwartzeneger fighting a baby, so St.Michael sent him to hell, and hes not all that powerful. hes just smart.|`|4c6af5ca2e393f371c8982760bd6c298aa	No, the devil is a created being.  He isn't omni-anything.  He has a lot of help from his demons, but isn't all powerful.  Don't let this mislead you, he is still more powerful than us, all of us.    Why did he create the devil?  Well, when God created him, he wasn't the devil, he was Lucifer, the highest of angels.  Don't think now, that just because the angels are in heaven that they are perfect, they aren't.     By that I mean when you make a mistake, it isn't always a sin.  The devil's mind worked like any other created beings mind, just like ours.  He knew what his position was to God.  This lead to his desire to be like the most high.  He wanted to be God.      Of course, you will ask, if God knew this was going to happen, why did he create him?  God has a plan.  Personally, if you look at it from the big picture, I wouldn't have done it any differently, and this comes from someone who has constantly fought God for my whole life.  Some of us just learn slower than others.    Take care:)|`|329c9a7221852a2a78fb47a361e24878aa	God and devil both are in our mind not anywhere.  if we think positively  and be good for our society, country and for the world then everybody feel god started his work on the earth. now same thing in reverse  it's devil work.|`|b5717699d95d7c04fcdfe53f97d84182aa	No state can be experienced if there is no opposite state because in the absence of this opposite state, the current state is all that is. So we wouldnt know positive without negative,left without right, + without -, happiness without sadness, man without woman and so on.    Devil is a concept created by humanity over ages because as humans became "thinking creatures", they started wondering why lot of negative things happen in their lives (murders, rapes, suicides, to name a few). Humans deduced that if God couldnt prevent these from happening, then there must be definitely an opposite force which causes these negatives which God cannot control. This opposite force was christened as Satan, Devil, Asura and various other names across religions by  humans.     So in reality, Devil cannot exist because there is nothing in this cosmos that is NOT GOD. GOD is What 'is' and  What 'is not' , He is the up & down of it , the left & right of it, the Alpha & the Omega, the Almighty, All powerful Creator.     Devil therefore is just a "concept" in our mind.|`|71c6d0d32d017440f76fdc48f94cef61aa	it is said that the smartest thing the devil ever did was to convince the world that he doesn't exist.    as for the devil getting his own chapter...he's not that important.  (he only thinks he is.) we're the ones that's important to God, not him.|`|6efcd3feb62dbf6347e785c39044c68eaa	The answer to this question is going to depend upon which religious belief you are following. Satan, or the devil, does not appear in the earliest books of the Jewish and Christian Bible. However, traditionally, Satan is an angel--created by God--but allowed--as much of God's creation is--to exercise free will. Satan chose to rebel. This "creation" isn't mentioned in the Bible because the Bible is concerned with the human story more than the angels. As a created being Satan cannot be omni-present and is not omnipotent.    Other faiths and some variants of Judaism and Christianity have held that there is a "Good God" and a "Bad God"--a theological dualism. But orthodox and traditional Judaism and Christianity have always denied that. Martin Luther, the Christian reformer, but it this way: "even the devil is God's devil."|`|dddac63382cc34690825a1fd44152c51aa	The devil was originally Lucifer, who was a beautiful angel created by God, who became prideful and wanted to rule over God, so God basically showed 'em who's boss, and cast him out and his followers out of heaven. And no, the devil is not omnipresent.|`|AA12124117	Well, the devil was created by god, but he was not sinful when he was created.   Lucifer was an angel of light, but turned from God because he has free will.  He would rather die than submit to God's will.  The bible stories say that 1/3 of the angels did the same.    Humans aren't so different, are we?
AA10214222	Jesus said  "no man hath ascended up to heaven."  We that will be granted eternal life shall spend it on the new Earth not in heaven. Heaven is for God and the angels not mankind.

He made Himself the Sacrifice for our sins, so that we could have hope of becoming the adopted sons and daughters of our Heavenly Father, to accept the gift of salvation by faith, through our own free will. Jesus is the Lord, and He has said to those on earth, (John 14:9 Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father?)

Waking up in any form is not instantaneously deadly as it is a sign of coming out of unconciousnous. Smoking on the other hand does have certain potentials of instantaneous death like, swallowing, choking, and then dying on the cigarrette butt.    If you are looking for something more in-depth as far as it being a deadly sort of feeling to you whenever you approach each, then waking up is more deadly, because you can quit smoking, but you will wake up every day.

All he does is take little understood faith facts and distort them to a ridiculous extent.    It would be great if people would actually learn the true facts about Catholicism, from reliable and authentic sources, rather than just repeating what they heard from somebody else ... especially from somebody like Chick.    Catholicism was the only Christian faith on earth for the first 1500 years after Christ. It had to be the true faith, as there was no other.    Those who maintain that it is now otherwise, make Jesus Christ out as a liar, as Christ is the head of his church, and he promised (in the bible) that the gates of hell would not prevail against it.

Instead they make graven images and bow down to them and pray to them on bended knee.  There is only one Father and he is in Heaven and only he can forgive our sins. Catholics dropped one of the commandments and split another in two to make up for the missing commandment.

AA11248444	At times it seems far-fetched.  At other times it makes perfect sense.    Here is what sealed the deal for me:  1. Book of Mormon - there are some incredibly complex chapters that deal with advanced doctrines in a very poetic manner.  My favorite is Alma 36.  It is a chapter of Hebrew poetry known as a chiasm.  The centerpoint in the chapter is the atonement of Christ.  Alma goes from exceeding torment to exceeding joy as the chapter rotates around the centerpont of the atonement.  Amazing writing.    2. Belief in Eternal family relationships    3. Belief in eternal progression    4. Belief in the eternal soul of man    5. Emphasis on faith and works    6. Clearer Understanding of man's pre- and post- mortal existence    7. Modern Divine Revelation    8. Modern Gifts of the Spirit    9. Most successful missionary program    10. Lowest incidence of divorce, longest lifespans, academic success    11. Understanding that although God created our souls, there is a divine intelligence that is uniquely our own that God did not and could not create.  This is why God can judge us.    12. Belief in 3 kingdoms of glory (not a Hell of everlasting torture to non-believers)    13. Missionary work in the spirit world and opportunities for all men to accept Christ and be saved.  This makes it fair for all men everywhere.    14. Belief in a direct line of priesthood authority from Jesus Christ.  (The Catholics can claim this as well but the behavior of many of the popes in the medieval ages makes their claim suspect)    15. Church named after Jesus Christ (not a man)    16. Belief in God the father, His Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost    17. History of Persecution (Satan has sought to destroy God's church)    18. Fulfilled prophecies    I agree there is alot of weird ideas as well but I think the overall weight of the truth compensates for it all.  No other church has the faith of the mormons.  Mormons attend church more regularly, read the bible more, pray more often, and follow the commandments more regularly than any other Christian denomination.    P.S. Timothy is certainly in the LDS Bible.  Not sure why someone thought it wasn't.  Seems like a trivial reason to leave.    To be fair I should include points that seem far-fetched.    1. Early History of Polygamy (now banned) - Moses, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, David, and Solomon were all polygamists though.  2. Priesthood at one time not available to African-Americans - Moses only allowed the priesthood to the sons of Aaron.  Later only the tribe of Levi was allowed to have it.  Jesus refused to teach to the gentiles as his mission was to the Jews.  Women have never been allowed to be priests. Simply because God directs which lineage is allowed to perform priesthood ordinances does not make God prejudice.  He judges all men equally regardless of Priesthood office. (Protestants were much worse in their treatment of African Americans.  Mormons in fact were beaten, raped, and murdered partly because of their opposition to slavery)  3. Mormon Temple Ceremony - Very similar to Masonic temple ceremony.  There are parts that imitate early christian ceremonies that were changed or forgotten with time but kept record of by 1st and 2nd century writers.    PPS The video comparing the Book of Mormon with the Bible is anti-mormon garbage    It doesn't include:  1. Native American stories that are very reminiscent of Jesus Christ  2. Immense civilizations such as the Aztecs, Incas, and Mayans    It does include:  1. Incorrect facts  2. Opinions presented as fact  3. Misleading and deceptive photography and opinions    PPPS  1. Utah is not number one in Teen suicide - that would be Nevada.  Utah is down the list a way.  Apparently Mormon youth commit suicide less often than non-mormon youth in Utah.  Other western states including Oregon, New Mexico, Arizona, and Washington have higher suicide rates than Utah.  2. Utah does not have the most meth labs.  There were 47 meth labs closed in Utah in 2004.  Compare this to 407 in Washington, 350 in Oregon, 409 in Oklahoma, 563 in Arkansas, and 895 in Tennessee.  Seems like the Bible belt has a worse problem with meth labs than Utah  3. There are many states with more bankruptcies per capita than Utah: Georgia, Arkansas, Tennessee, Mississippi, etc.    Utah is not the best in these categories but leads in many other categories.    Mormon teenagers are more religiously serious and articulate than most other religious teenagers in the U.S. according to a four-year study conducted at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Christian Smith, a UNC sociologist and the studys author, said Mormon teens are more likely to avoid risky behavior and to do well in school than conservative Protestants. Across almost every category we looked at, there was a clear pattern: Mormons were first, said Steve Vaisey, one of the researchers involved in the study and the person who interviewed most of the Mormon youths.     A 14-year selective study conducted by UCLA epidemiologist James E. Enstrom tracked the health of 10,000 moderately active LDS people in California, ending in 1987. Enstrom concluded from the study "that LDS Church members who follow religious mandates barring smoking and drinking have one of the lowest death rates from cancer and cardiovascular diseasesabout half that of the general population... Moreover, the healthiest LDS Church members enjoy a life expectancy eight to 11 years longer than that of the general white population in the United States."     U.S. Govt. Census Bureau lists Utah as the state with the lowest teen pregnancy rate and the lowest abortion rate in the United States.

I've had many people try to convert me on various occasions, various random people, missionaries, co-workers, even close friends.  I find the people very kind and I know they truly believe in God and that Jesus was divine, however when it comes to Religion NOT SPIRITUALITY, they can be very pushy, self righteous, and in some cases downright disrespectful to people of other faiths.  Mormons teach of Love, understanding, tolerance, and most of all family, but yet living in Utah and having almost all Mormon friends I have seen families torn apart because one family member believes in a different religion, or because they might not want to go on their mission, or if Mormon parents find out that their son or daughter is gay.  and worst of all is the church gets involved in these families lives and takes side with the rules the church set down no mater what moral is at hand.  I think there are the good and bad in any religion in the world so why should we fallow religion, a man made thing.  Why not fallow spirituality.  Also, I find it interesting that Utah, Mormon capital of the world ranks highest in the US for Meth Labs, Bankruptcy, and teen suicide.|`|AA11189151	I have a friend who converted simply because the missionaries were "hot."|`|AA10197119	i heard lader day saints they give you what you want to hear and when you are to deep in they tell you that they believe that jesus has come agian already or something like that. i am not really sure.|`|AA10653189	I worked with a LDS lady.  She was nice but in my spirit I knew this wasn't for me.  I needed the whole truth of God.  I don't mean to put down what you believe.  You have your understanding for choosing it.  People need freedom in their lives from bondage and religiousity.  I need the true power and reality of God in my day to day life.  To see the reality of His healing in my life and the ones around me.  To truly see that Jesus did the things he did for a reason.  Do Mormons know what Jesus came to do and why Jesus even came?|`|fc2bf0c5c18672809868c6f540007fb4aa	I was converted but left after 2 years. In the beginning during the conversion period they don't tell you all the beliefs. That comes during the classes as you study the pearls of wisdom. And that's were I realized it was not for me. Not to be mean to what anyone else believes but I was in my sisters Church (Non Dem) and the minister asked us to turn to Timothy 1 (I think) and it wasn't in my LDS Bible. It had been removed then reading I realized it directly contradicted the writings in the Pearls. And that's when I realized I was lied to. What they taught me before I was baptized was SO DIFFERENT and incomplete to what was THEIR actual truth.|`|69da53d3484bb89aac3218d2757fbafbaa	I took all the missionary lessons but stepped away from the LDS church due to having a brain and common sense.

He is the only one whose blood was shed at Calvary for the sins of all men.  If you sincerely ask Him to, He will save your from all your sins.

But some of it is understandable, given their history.    Bucuresti is a dirty and nasty town from what I understand and I wouldn't want to hang out there.  There are packs of stray dogs roaming the streets that have even killed a Japanese businessman.  I would land at the airport, get in a taxi and find myself in the Transylvanian Alps before I even opened my bag.    I would love to buy a seat on the RASDAQ (Romanian Stock Exchange...).  Very soon, it will be really worth something to be able to trade from there.  Business is booming.

O sangue fora recolhido quando este preparava Seu corpo para enterro, aps Sua crucifica??o no Calvrio.      " Ao chegarem a Jesus, vendo-o j morto, n?o Lhe quebraram as pernas, mas um dos soldados perfurou-Lhe o lado com uma lan?a e logo saiu sangue e gua "       Jo19:34 -35        fato que a lenda do Santo Graal n?o resume-se apenas nestes episdios narrados pela Bblia. Muitas s?o as teorias da origem do termo Graal, as quais procuraremos abord-las ao longo deste trabalho, que v?o desde jarros e caldeir?es sagrados utilizados por Celtas at pedras mitolgicas descritas filosficamente.    A Igreja Catlica n?o d ao clice mais do que um valor simblico e acredita que o Graal n?o passa de literatura medieval, apesar de reconhecer que alguns personagens possam realmente haver existido. Alguns autores acreditam que as origens pag?s do clice tenham causado descontentamento  Igreja, pois existem tambm teses de que os romances medievais que descrevem primordialmente o Santo Graal tenham sofrido em seus textos forte influncia de elementos da cultura de povos pag?os.    Apesar do encorajamento que dava s outras histrias de milagres, ao Graal a Igreja n?o deu nenhum apoio, embora esta lenda seja a mais surpreendente do ponto de vista pictrico. Nas representa??es de Jos de Arimatia em vitrais de igrejas, ele aparece segurando n?o um clice, mas dois frascos ou galheteiros. Alguns tomam o clice de gata que est na igreja de Valncia, Espanha, como aquele que teria servido Cristo, mas, aparentemente, a pe?a data do sculo XIV.    Ao longo deste trabalho, veremos que as lendas e teorias sobre a existncia do Santo Graal s?o provenientes de literatura medieval, que afloraram por volta do sculo XII na Gr?-Bretanha, Fran?a, Itlia e Alemanha, pois a Bblia n?o retrata a existncia do Santo Graal em nenhuma de suas passagens, nem mesmo quando menciona a "Santa Ceia" e o recolhimento e sepultamento do corpo de Cristo por Jos de Arimatia.    O clice em que Jesus teria bebido  um mistrio muito maior do que uma simples leitura de romances medievais pode revelar. Ele teria realmente existido? Resistiu ao tempo? Quem eram seus guardi?es?

ceaa21c6fdfc15a63d5834d986f74c96aa	Yes, when I was a teenager, my car was constantly losing a hubcap. Once, I parked next to a car just like mine in a parking lot, and found its hubcap lying next to it, apparently it had just fallen off. I knew it wasn't a good thing to do, but I took it, justifying it with the fact that mine was out there somewhere, maybe they'd find it and we'd be even. No more than a week later, I had to replace not only all four tires, due to a 'freak overheating thing' but also the water pump. That's when I knew Karma worked!     And it works both ways--I once worked with a militant and very judgmental health nut, who decided that everyone should join her in using the stairs to our workplace on the 3rd floor. This woman went beyond not being sympathetic to people with health problems, she would openly mock them and say they brought it on themselves. At the time of the stair-climbing decree, I was recovering from a knee injury which made climbing stairs painful, and besides, I'm a believer in freedom of choice, so I chose to use the elevator. From that time on, Ms. Stairclimber labeled me as 'lazy' and was constantly telling our supervisors tales of my alleged laziness. A few months later, I had an episode of irregular heartbeat and had to wear a monitor to work for a 24 hour reading. She laughed about it, and actually said "Well, if she wasn't too lazy to climb the stairs, she might not have heart problems now." My 'heart problem' turned out to be a combination of anxiety and too much caffeine, but I eventually left that job, largely due to her intolerance.     Imagine my surprise when several years later, I ran into one of my former co-workers who told me that "A----" , my former tormenter had been scheduled for open heart surgery! "Isn't it ironic" she said" the one who was always so health conscious having open heart surgery in her 30s!!"  Since then, she's had two more heart surgeries, and still no diagnosis of her 'mystery' heart ailment.    I was by no means happy to hear about her illness, but I can't say that I'm particularly sorry, either. I only know that 'what goes around comes around'. It never fails.|`|AA12333649	I've never personally experienced the law of 3 (none that I can remember anyway), but I have seen others experience it.     A relative of mine used to be very anti-Middle Eastern. If she saw one, she would immediately call them a raghead, to my dismay. Well, one day I was driving around and I suddenly had a flat tire. I pulled into the nearest gas station and called said relative to let her know I was going to be late for dinner. She told me she'd be right over to help me out because she didn't want me left alone.    While waiting for her to arrive, a very kind Middle Eastern man asked me if I needed help. I said yes, that I had a flat. He asked me if I had a spare and a jack. I got all the stuff out from my trunk, and bless him, in his nice business clothes he started changing my tire. My relative arrived and was in total shock when she saw this. She and I, both, profusely thanked the man and asked him if there was anything we could do to re-pay him. He flashed a smile and said "No, it was my pleasure."     "So, not only was he kind and generous, he was also gorgeous to boot." Those are my relatives words, not mine (even though I shared the sentiment) . She has since ceased to call a Middle Eastern a reghead.     So, the law of 3 doesn't always happen in negative ways.

Um porque s?o inseguros e n?o sabem como vai ser seus desempenhos iniciais, depois porque sexo  uma coisa inevitvel na vida de um homem  normal. Como o homem n?o tinha quem o iniciasse e ensinasse, eram as prostitutas que faziam este papel. S que tambm eram despreparadas, atacadas e discriminadas. N?o adianta ser hipocrita, o homem PRECISA ter sexo para ficar equilibrado. Dei sorte de ter tido uma coleguinha que, aos quatorze anos, come?amos juntos a arte do sexo, cheio de alegria e carinho. E isto  que  o grande problema da prostituta, ela n?o recebe este retorno, s o dinheiro. E o rapaz aprende que mulher  um negcio na rela??o dinheiro e sexo. E quando casa, continua a pensar a mesma coisa. Gasto com ela, uso ela. Chato n?o? Ainda bem que hoje em dia, as meninas j est?o mais livres para transarem sem ter problemas de fama, etc. e podem ficar com os rapazes e setirem se eles valem a pena ou n?o.

9b88d94914c83b11f5ebd024aaa3017faa	Plat?o de Atenas, 428/27 a.C. - 347 a.C., filsofo grego. Discpulo de Scrates, fundador da Academia e mestre de Aristteles. Seu nome verdadeiro era Aristcles; Plat?o era um apelido que, provavelmente, fazia referncia  sua caracteristica fsica, tal como o porte atltico ou os ombros largos, ou ainda a sua ampla capacidade intelectual de tratar de diferentes temas. ?? (pltos), em grego significa amplitude, dimens?o, largura. Sua filosofia  de grande importancia e influncia. Plat?o ocupou-se com vrios temas, entre eles tica, poltica, metafsica e teoria do conhecimento.  nasceu um ano aps a morte do estadista ateniense Pricles. Seu pai tinha como ancestral o rei Codros e sua m?e tinha Slon entre seus antepassados. Inicialmente, Plat?o entusiasmou-se com a filosofia de Crtilo, um seguidor de Herclito. No entanto, por volta dos vinte anos, encontrou o filsofo Scrates e tornou-se seu discpulo at a morte deste. Pouco depois de 399 a.C., Plat?o esteve em Mgara com alguns outros discpulos de Scrates, hospedando-se na casa de Euclides. Em 388 a.C., quando j contava com quarenta anos, Plat?o viajou para a Magna Grcia com o intuito de conhecer mais de perto comunidades pitagricas. Nesta ocasi?o, veio a conhecer Arquitas de Tarento. Ainda durante essa viagem, Dionsio I convidou Plat?o para ir a Siracusa, na Siclia. Plat?o parte para Siracusa com a esperan?a de l implantar seus ideais polticos. No entanto, acabou por se desentender com o tirano local e retorna para Atenas.    Em seu retorno, funda a Academia. A institui??o logo adquire prestgio e a ela acorriam inmeros jovens em busca de instru??o e at mesmo homens ilustres a fim de debater idias. Em 367 a.C., Dionsio I morre e Plat?o retorna a Siracusa a fim de uma vez mais tentar implementar suas idias polticas na corte de Dionsio II. No entanto, o desejo do filsofo foi novamente frustrado. Em 361 a.C. volta pela ltima vez a Siracusa com o mesmo objetivo e pela terceira vez fracassa. De volta a Atenas em 360 a.C., Plat?o permaneceu na dire??o da Academia at sua morte, em 347 a.C.    Em linhas gerais, Plat?o desenvolveu a no??o de que o homem est em contato permanente com dois tipos de realidade: os inteligveis e os sensveis. Os primeiros s?o realidades, mais concretas, permanentes, imutveis, iguais a si mesmas. As segundas s?o todas as coisas que nos afetam os sentidos, s?o realidades dependentes, mutveis e s?o imagens das realidades inteligveis.    Tal concep??o de Plat?o tambm  conhecida por Teoria das Idias ou Teoria das Formas. Foi desenvolvida como hiptese no dilogo Fdon e constitui uma maneira de garantir a possibilidade do conhecimento e fornecer uma inteligibilidade relativa aos fen?menos.    Para Plat?o, o mundo concreto percebido pelos sentidos  uma plida reprodu??o do mundo das Idias. Cada objeto concreto que existe participa, junto com todos os outros objetos de sua categoria, de uma Idia perfeita. Uma determinada caneta, por exemplo, ter determinados atributos (cor, formato, tamanho, etc). Outra caneta ter outros atributos, sendo ela tambm uma caneta, tanto quanto a outra. Aquilo que faz com que as duas sejam canetas , para Plat?o, a Idia de Caneta, perfeita, que esgota todas as possibilidades de ser caneta.    A ontologia de Plat?o diz, ent?o, que algo  na medida em que participa da Idia desse objeto. No caso da caneta  irrelevante, mas o foco de Plat?o s?o coisas como o ser humano, o bem ou a justi?a, por exemplo.    O problema que Plat?o prop?e-se a resolver  a tens?o entre Herclito e Parmnides: para o primeiro, o ser  a mudan?a, tudo est em constante movimento e  uma ilus?o a estaticidade, ou a permanncia de qualquer coisa; para o segundo, o movimento  que  uma ilus?o, pois algo que  n?o pode deixar de ser e algo que n?o  n?o pode ser, assim, n?o h mudan?a.    Ou seja (por exemplo), o que faz com que determinada rvore seja ela mesma desde o estgio de semente at morrer, e o que faz com que ela seja t?o rvore quanto outra de outra espcie, com caractersticas t?o diferentes? H aqui uma mudan?a, tanto da rvore em rela??o a si mesma (com o passar do tempo ela cresce) quanto da rvore em rela??o a outra. Para Herclito, a rvore est sempre mudando e nunca  a mesma, e para Parmnides, ela nunca muda,  sempre a mesma e  uma ilus?o sua mudan?a.    Plat?o resolve esse problema com sua Teoria das Idias. O que h de permanente em um objeto  a Idia, mais precisamente, a participa??o desse objeto na sua Idia correspondente. E a mudan?a ocorre porque esse objeto n?o  uma Idia, mas uma incompleta representa??o da Idia desse objeto. No exemplo da rvore, o que faz com que ela seja ela mesma e seja uma rvore (e n?o outra coisa), a despeito de sua diferen?a daquilo que era quando mais jovem e de outras rvores de outras espcies (e mesmo das rvores da mesma espcie)  sua participa??o na Idia de rvore; e sua mudan?a deve-se ao fato de ser uma plida representa??o da Idia de rvore.    Plat?o tambm elaborou uma teoria gnosiolgica, ou seja, uma teoria que explica como se pode conhecer as coisas, ou ainda, uma teoria do conhecimento. Segundo ele, ao vermos um objeto repetidas vezes, uma pessoa lembra-se, aos poucos, da Idia daquele objeto, que viu no mundo das Idias. Para explicar como se d isso, Plat?o recorre a um mito (ou uma metfora) que diz que, antes de nascer, a alma de cada pessoa vivia em uma Estrela, onde localizam-se as Idias. Quando uma pessoa nasce, sua alma  "jogada" para a Terra, e o impacto que ocorre faz com que esque?a o que viu na Estrela. Mas ao ver um objeto aparecer de diferentes formas (como as diferentes rvores que se pode ver), a alma recorda-se da Idia daquele objeto que foi vista na Estrela. Tal recorda??o, em|`|9e16ab711fce9547c9e78ca037fe1561aa	www.google.com.br  www.cade.com.br|`|5898a39b885276fb23ce9f0ff3cfafd1aa	Diversamente de Scrates , que era filho do povo, Plat?o nasceu em Atenas, em 428 ou 427 a.C., de pais aristocrticos e abastados, de antiga e nobre prospia. Temperamento artstico e dialtico - manifesta??o caracterstica e suma do gnio grego - deu, na mocidade, livre curso ao seu talento potico, que o acompanhou durante a vida toda, manifestando-se na express?o esttica de seus escritos; entretanto isto prejudicou sem dvida a precis?o e a ordem do seu pensamento, tanto assim que vrias partes de suas obras n?o tm verdadeira importancia e valor filosfico.    Aos vinte anos, Plat?o travou rela??o com Scrates - mais velho do que ele quarenta anos - e gozou por oito anos do ensinamento e da amizade do mestre. Quando discpulo de Scrates e ainda depois, Plat?o estudou tambm os maiores pr-socrticos. Depois da morte do mestre, Plat?o retirou-se com outros socrticos para junto de Euclides, em Mgara.    Da deu incio a suas viagens, e fez um vasto giro pelo mundo para se instruir (390-388). Visitou o Egito, de que admirou a veneranda antigidade e estabilidade poltica; a Itlia meridional, onde teve ocasi?o de travar rela??es com os pitagricos (tal contato ser fecundo para o desenvolvimento do seu pensamento); a Siclia, onde conheceu Dionsio o Antigo, tirano de Siracusa e travou amizade profunda com Dion, cunhado daquele. Cado, porm, na desgra?a do tirano pela sua fraqueza, foi vendido como escravo. Libertado gra?as a um amigo, voltou a Atenas.    Em Atenas, pelo ano de 387, Plat?o fundava a sua clebre escola, que, dos jardins de Academo, onde surgiu, tomou o nome famoso de Academia. Adquiriu, perto de Colona, povoado da tica, uma herdade, onde levantou um templo s Musas, que se tornou propriedade coletiva da escola e foi por ela conservada durante quase um milnio, at o tempo do imperador Justiniano (529 d.C.).    Plat?o, ao contrrio de Scrates, interessou-se vivamente pela poltica e pela filosofia poltica. Foi assim que o filsofo, aps a morte de Dionsio o Antigo, voltou duas vezes - em 366 e em 361 -  Dion, esperando poder experimentar o seu ideal poltico e realizar a sua poltica utopista. Estas duas viagens polticas a Siracusa, porm, n?o tiveram melhor xito do que a precedente: a primeira viagem terminou com desterro de Dion; na segunda, Plat?o foi preso por Dionsio, e foi libertado por Arquitas e pelos seus amigos, estando, ent?o, Arquistas no governo do poderoso estado de Tarento.    Voltando para Atenas, Plat?o dedicou-se inteiramente  especula??o metafsica, ao ensino filosfico e  reda??o de suas obras, atividade que n?o foi interrompida a n?o ser pela morte. Esta veio operar aquela liberta??o definitiva do crcere do corpo, da qual a filosofia - como lemos no Fdon - n?o  sen?o uma assdua prepara??o e realiza??o no tempo. Morreu o grande Plat?o em 348 ou 347 a.C., com oitenta anos de idade.    Plat?o  o primeiro filsofo antigo de quem possumos as obras completas. Dos 35 dilogos, porm, que correm sob o seu nome, muitos s?o apcrifos, outros de autenticidade duvidosa.    A forma dos escritos plat?nicos  o dilogo, transi??o espontanea entre o ensinamento oral e fragmentrio de Scrates e o mtodo estritamente didtico de Aristteles. No fundador da Academia, o mito e a poesia confundem-se muitas vezes com os elementos puramente racionais do sistema. Faltam-lhe ainda o rigor, a precis?o, o mtodo, a terminologia cientfica que tanto caracterizam os escritos do sbio estagirita.    A atividade literria de Plat?o abrange mais de cinqenta anos da sua vida: desde a morte de Scrates , at a sua morte. A parte mais importante da atividade literria de Plat?o  representada pelos dilogos - em trs grupos principais, segundo certa ordem cronolgica, lgica e formal, que representa a evolu??o do pensamento plat?nico, do socratismo ao aristotelismo ....|`|1c3b5a8ff30d9541a1c897b1e4728db4aa	www.portal filosofia.com.br  www.wikipdia.com  e muitos outros sites de filosofia no google. s digitar filosofia e procurar por Plat?o.

Se aprofundarmos um pouco a respeito da psicologia humana, perceberemos que em todos os animais o macho tem uma inclina??o maior para o lado da satisfa??o sexual. O homem tem mais necessidade de satisfazer os seus instintos. O homem sente prazer muito mais rpido que a mulher o que o leva a satisfaz-lo. A mulher  um tanto mais devagar para chegar a ter o orgasmo, ou seja, a mulher necessita de mais estmulos e de mais tempo para ter realmente o prazer numa rela??o. A tendncia que o homem tem de desejar uma mulher  biolgica e est no genes da espcie humana. Mas o homem tambm tem a faculdade racional, o que o leva a evitar que ele quando sente este desejo manifeste isso automaticamente. Vejo esta sua pergunta um tanto feminista. Como se a mulher n?o sentisse esse impulso natural da espcie humana.

A Christian might however be involved in a just war for defence ot pretection of a vulerable and helpless people     the main goal of a christians is to Glorify God  and become more like Him in character  that includes speaking the truth in love to your neighbors.  The vast number of American Chrstians will respect a person right to invest their lives in the faith of their choice,  yet will speak the truth in love at times still respecting concience and personal choice to a very large extent  and possibly one of the highest in history if the truth be known    the missions... well... thats hardly an American thing...  God said  "come to me all the ends of the earth and be saved!!"  in Isaiah  and Jesus said "go into all the world and preach the gospel making disciples of every nation"  Americans can't take credit for that one...sorry...  missions when practices biblically is not forced and forced missions is not mission...  missions is holding out the truth making disciples  and respecting people as they choice to accept or reject the gospel|`|AA10733606	Our ONLY goal is to spread the Gospel to the entire world, so everyone has a chance to accept to Christ, before his very soon to come return.|`|3f752fdaa112075eecfa9055b75b83e7aa	To buy up all the meth and throw it away to get it off the streets.|`|973d26ae4f4c37c06293df385f9560caaa	their goal is to take your money. because they're concerned about your immortal soul. lol|`|1c5f4b67233d37e84a0fef1c87fc116aaa	I am amused by this.  1) because the American Evangelicals sound like a sports franchise.  2) A Church should not be preaching politics.  3) A War would be against a true Christians belief.|`|2ab51a1f4bac61dcad561c873a1d5ae0aa	to force their beliefs on us through legislation. there's no doubt in my mind that they're dead-set on theocracy.|`|AA10097922	Sadly, I sometimes wonder about that myself.

f553cfc13429903fa12e0b9885833d38aa	Because real love involves taking responsibility for your actions or non-actions,   demonstrating respect and good character and doing what is right not what just feels good.

Durable?  Difficult?  Harsh?  Stern?  Or something else?|`|26fd14b35b6fd98cf306d402ccc77dfaaa	I would not say its a silly idea . What exactly are you talking about? People mean so many different things by that statement. Loving someone is tough because you have to open yourself up and begin to trust that person. Being in love is tough, even moreso with abusive and cheating spouses. Being married and in love is tough as well. My husband and I have only been married for 2 years and we are still learning so much about each other as we only knew each other about 3-4 months prior to getting married. He is my best friend and I talk to him just like I would with my old friends but still difficult situations come up and at the time they are horrible dealing with and going through them but its a blessing because those difficult situations increase your love for one another. I'm not talking about difficult situations that involve either of you being mistreated but trials like loosing a job, family member and so forth. Or disagreements. I don't think anyone who is truly in love and has been over a period of time would say its easy, at times it is and at times its a challenge thats not to say you want to leave that person.    I guess its because everyone will face trials in life both good and bad and by being in love you must deal with your trials as well as those of your partner. Love requires patience and not everyone has that. Not just loving a life partner but even loving your children, family members and friends is difficult because it requires patience, security, compassion and so many other factors.    I'm not sure exactly what you meant by your question but maybe someone else will.|`|AA12120979	Maybe they have the wrong idea of what tough is.     Tough is not cruel or harsh. Love is tough in a sense that it is strong and quite durable. It's not weak as some perceive it to be & it's not tough as people percieve tough.

They just want to get the gift from "kindly, old grandpa God" without having to do anything, without having to talk to him, to aviod him at all costs, but because YOU don't show any love OR respect for Him, He is supposed to give you everything you want.  I just do not understand it................|`|AA10138161	The answer to your question  http://www.gotquestions.org/why-Jesus-di...|`|2943df171b94dac8315ea248c628b35baa	004.157  "That they said (in boast), "We killed Christ Jesus the son of Mary, the Messenger of Allah";- but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but so it was made to appear to them, and those who differ therein are full of doubts, with no (certain) knowledge, but only conjecture to follow, for of a surety they killed him not:- "|`|1f5e51bdd44e9d78e3070e9da0f096e2aa	i am a roman catholic. and i grew up believing that Jesus was crucified to save people from sins, that's until i went to college, where my theology prof said that, for starters, God ain't a bleeding sadist. Jesus died because the society during that time was cruel and unjust, not because God wanted him to save us from sins. my professor got me there. i mean, If you're a father, why would you let your son get hurt, or worst, die? furthermore, Jesus, being a normal human being, tried to escape death as well. and unfortunately, people have this image of Jesus as a magician, bringing the dead back to life, changing water into wine... and all those sort of stuff. the thing is, you don't read the bible literally, you actually interpret it. unfortunately...unfortunately, people don't do that. so i strongly suggest people who are interested to take a theology course to be enlightened.    btw, i attended a catholic university, that's where i learned all those stuff.|`|AA10097922	I could be wrong, but I don't think the term omnipotent is actually in the Bible.  The way I see it, there are many things God can't do. He can't lie for example. If he did, he would no longer be the God of truth.  He also can't go against the principles and laws that he himself established.   The consequence of sin is death. God warned Adam and Eve that their disobedience would result in death. He cannot go back on his word.  The only way God can forgive us is, if we accept Jesus death as the sacrifice for our sins.   You do realize, that God did not kill Jesus himself right?   We killed him. True, God allowed it to happen but he wasn't the one who put the thorns on his head and nailed him to the cross! That was us. If anybody can be called sadistic here, it's mankind and not God.  Now about sacrificing one child for the sake of the others. What if you knew that by sacrificing that one child, you could save millions of your other children (assuming for a minute that you were able to have millions)? We are not talking one or two other children you know!   The last thing I want to tell you is, that in order to forgive anybody anything, that person has to ask for forgiveness or at least want it! Most people living today don't think they even need God's forgiveness! Would you forgive a person who has sinned against you if he was completely unrepentant?|`|a7950b520599a2ae4a881529eb42049eaa	Perhaps looking at an illustration could help you.    If your children were kidnapped and the kidnapper demanded $100,000 to free them, otherwise they would die, would you pay the ransom?  Would you be upset if someone else paid it for you?      God's justice demanded that a perfect human life was the price that was needed to ransom mankind from sin and death and then he even furnished the ransom price.  What is so revolting about that?    The fact that God is omnipotent does not mean that he will go against his laws of justice.  No doubt there are things that you are able to do, and have the power to do (perhaps kill your neighbor) that you do not proceed with, due to your sense of justice.    Even a human judge would think that one life sacrificed to save billions was in the best interest of mankind.|`|e61982badc646af829df927519c42f58aa	I agree. I think Christianity defies GODs law and will by propagating this ridiculous story, the least of which is the substitution of a man's life for humanity's sins, the dismissal of GOD's command that humanity follow GOD's law, and the disgusting proposition that a man be worshipped in GOD's stead in return for salvation instead of people taking responsibility for their own actions and understanding that only GOD can forgive.|`|f73c3365fa47926a560bc633d74ac58eaa	Nonsense negative idiot.

Do you seriously think we totally understand the godhead?  We don't have an inkling as to what our beginnings are. We come up with theories and that's it.      First bad things that happen and right away we blame God or godhead.  Yeah, it's him who took my child away! Good grief.      To blame it on a godhead?  We don't have enough spritual smarts and knowledge to blame.|`|AA11731497	Jesus knew what was to be before it was.    He made the ultimate sacrifice so that those who BELIEVE in him shall have everlasting life!

Nature has its own religion; gospel from the land  Father ruled by long division, young men they pretend  Old men comprehend.

And the road  The old man paved  The broken seams along the way  The rusted signs, left just for me  He was guiding me, love, his own way  Now the man of the hour is taking his final bow  As the curtain comes down  I feel that this is just g'bye for now|`|c6d2eefb207d52799bfc83830e445806aa	Me.Good night!|`|AA11430900	My father.

df50b667c6f3512dff6e0d3f50e4d902aa	I agree 100%.    I find it (tragically) hilarious that the radical Muslim's response to the Pope's comments was to threaten death to him and everyone else who is not a Muslim. uhhhh... Isn't that what the Pope's quote said that offended them so much????  Historically, there have been so many murders and wars fought over religious differences--  ignorant and evil people think they are following "the only true religion". No matter what you call yourself, I imagine God totally rejects you. Consider: If He IS God, He is the "father" of all people. How would any father or mother feel if their kids killed each other, especially if they said it was FOR the parent?    BTW the guy (may there be some sort of hell for him to eternally burn in!) who shot those innocent little Amish girls was not Amish himself. Apparently he just chose that school because it was so small and the kids especially defenseless. You know, hunt pet bunnies, not tigers who might fight back.  I try to be an optimist and tolerant of all kinds of beliefs, but jeez, what is going on in this world???|`|db0d300db6fe413e7fb315197d160076aa	Because Muslims follow the Old Testament of the Holy Bible.|`|AA10120694	That's true, no denying it, Christianity is very much like the Muslim religion though. It is monotheistic. And more so, in the past, through extreme groups like the spanish inquisition, there was violence in the name of god. All religions go through these stages, but Muslim is the only one going through it right now.|`|7d647be57724929a656a84a04d156140aa	Not in the last six months.  However, in the past there has been some demonic influenced group/person claiming that a voice/voices had spoken to them to kill these people.  For example the Son of Sam after hearing his interview, I must conclude it was not the voice of God but a demon.  Now, he has crossed over to Christianity.  Another, Jim Jones, in Guyana, a couple of his followers had survived, saw his strange behavior and was compelled that Mr. Jones was dabbling in the underworld/acult, which drove him to commit this mass murder.  The Bible says in James 1:27 "Pure and genuine religion in the sight of God the Father means caring for orphans and widows in their distress, and refusing to let the world corrupt you".  So if your religion is lined up with the word of God then it is pure and if not, it's corrupted.|`|e66c71f0c50e7672789a78265879bdc5aa	I will agree that you have a slight point.    However, Christians in America *do* try to inflict their beliefs on everyone else through education (Bible-as-literature classes, prayer in classes, "intelligent design", abstinence-only), law (same-sex marriage), censorship (taking books out of libraries), public displays (ten commandments in the courthouse), etc.    I heard something really interesting recently--that Christian Scripture has nothing to say about how to act as part of a majority, and the Koran has nothing to say about how to act as a minority.|`|AA11036328	Ok...how many "Islamic Terrorists" actually claim to be killing in the name of Allah?  I'm not saying thats right, though.  Islam doesnt teach killing of innocent people. Those who do, do not follow Islam properly, and certainly cannot be called Muslims.    They have their reasons, like because the USA attacked Iraq, Afghanistan, Israel occupied Palestine, Lebanon, and stuff like that.    If you say Israel attacking Lebanese civilians is justified because they supported Hizbullah, then 9/11 would also be justified because Americans support their troops and their governments invasive foreign policy. Its WRONG either way!!!|`|AA10989450	First off, the murderer who killed those Amish children, was not Amish himself.    As far as the question, people are afraid of seeming to be non-politically correct, so they don't want to admit that an entire religion might actually be considered evil.    It's like the Westboro Baptist Church, or whatever they're called, the ones who protest at soldier's funerals.  They use the word "baptist" to detract from the fact that what they do is not in the least chrisitian.  People are afraid of seeming to attack any religion.  I'm christian, and I gotta tell you, these people don't even know what christians are about, yet they use His name at every opportunity.  You'll see that with the KKK too, they like to throw God's name around.  They spread hate, and use His name to do it.  But you're right, they don't go around murdering innocent people on a daily basis (at least not anymore), they obviously have a few scruples left, if not many.  Either that, or they finally figured out that no matter how often they tried to blame their evil on God, we knew better.|`|adad53a16eb27397beff7dc827296e89aa	The problem is that your media only brings to you the negative images from our societies and focuses on Bin Laden as he was the religious leader of Muslims..That is why Muslims feel that they are in a defensive situation always and try to defend themselves that way..|`|911fe975585e4f471e9298a5526a4aecaa	they just dont|`|AA10481942	I have always wondered this too, especially because I'm a Christian.

I have the answer.|`|7c0b8d463941e2e4efdf88578930d8edaa	the only reason christianity isn't as violent as islam is because it's become so watered down over the years. the base religions themselves however are quite similar in their approaches.|`|36f0220780852a90c0df00d6599663deaa	Bush kills in the name of christianity, he was out on a crusade against muslim.  Bush and his christian friend will not succeed, coz no one can destroy ISLAM {PEACE AND SUBMISSION TO THE WILL OF GOD}.|`|065cf58c48adf6d6e5debdc008900830aa	To justify bigotry. As you said, Christians are the number one group to be made fun of, yet we don't go out and destroy those who hurt us. People say that we're forcing our religion down their throats, and yet most of what is pointed out has been taken away from us. There is no prayer in schools, the only "religion" courses I've seen have been electives (meaning the kids can take it if they want), the 10 commandments are removed from public places, and abortion is legal. If Christians talk of their religion, they are forcing it down another's throat, yet if someone talks against christianity, they are "exercising their right". Christianity is among the more peaceful religions but the only thing some people focus on is the past. They bring up the crusades and such as examples of how we're violent, but, as you pointed out, we haven't done any religious killings in recent history. And I am fully aware that not all Muslims are violent as media is portraying them to be, there will be a few nuts in every religion.

"Religion" is the belief that worship of spirits ought to be organized in a social structure, usually requiring some economic exchange to support the structure's functioning.  For example, tithing supports the existence of churches.  In contrast, Native American spiritualists argue that since they do not have centralized social structure that they are not a religion in the strict sense.

The churches role is to help with the soul and bring to it healing through Christ Jesus.  It already preaches against the sins, but it can't stop the sinners.  That's why there is law.  That's why up until the ACLU there was always separation of Church and State - the church taught the morals and the State upheld the morals - but the ACLU and various others erased the line - and now there is chaos.  No surprise for those of us who have fought it, watched it take over, and are now still fighting, but realize that when it gets right down to it, all we can do through the church is what Christ did - teach - the laws were still up to the state - Christ fulfilled all the "synagogue laws by his stripes" and he told us that we had to regard the governments in which we were under but God first.|`|0dcbf00339151b2653ef8f70762bbc1eaa	Chrstianity does NOT promote women being treated as property.

No artigo APS Session Examines Pseudoscience; The New Paranatural Paradigm (Skeptical Inquirer, July 2000)  dito :     Come?ando com as irm?s Fox em 1848, todo o tipo de relatos de apari??es, fantasmas, batidas, mesas girantes, teleporta??o, levita??o e a invoca??o dos mortos nas sess?es foram soterrados. Todos esses hoaxes descobriu-se n?o ser nada mais notvel ou misterioso do que do que bater de jun??es do dedo do p, de ps, de joelhos e de outros truques bobos.    No artigo Paranatural Paradigm; Communicating with the Dead (Skeptical Inquirer November 2000)  dito :    Um comit de doutores mdicos na Universidade do Bfalo testou as irm?s Fox em 1851 e atribuiu suas batidas a rachar de seus juntas do dedo do p ou do joelho de encontro a um assoalho ou a uma arma??o da cama de madeira. Os mdicos fizeram uma experincia controlada colocando os ps das garotas em travesseiros, e nada aconteceu. O grande fsico Michael Faraday investigou as mesas girantes (1852) descobriu que era devido  press?o exercida pelos dedos dos presentes (se voluntariamente ou involuntariamente). O senhor Walter Crookes investigou os mdiuns mais poderosos daqueles dias, D. D. Home (1871) e Florence Cook (1873), e pensou de que tinham habilidades especiais de mediunidade  os crticos acreditam que foram trapaceados por ambos (Hall 1962, 1984)."    O autor deste artigo poderia citar mais, mas cr que a amostra seja suficiente. Basicamente, os cticos usam unicamente a confiss?o de fraude de Margareth para dizer que o Espiritualismo come?ou com uma fraude, mas se esquecem de dizer que Margareth desmentiu a confiss?o e que a prpria confiss?o possui erros crassos. O ltimo artigo cita algo de mais substancial: um teste na Universidade do Bfalo feito em 1851. Analisemos cada uma dessas provas de fraude, antes, porm, contando um pouco mais da histria das meninas e de Hydesville.    QUANDO COME?ARAM AS BATIDAS?    Em primeiro lugar,  preciso dizer que os fen?menos que assombravam Hydesville j haviam come?ado antes da chegada das meninas.     A m?e de Lucretia, sr.a Ann Pulver, que mantinha rela??es com a famlia Bell, relata que, em 1844, quando visitara a sr.a Bell, indo fazer tricot em sua companhia, ouvira desta uma queixa. Disse-lhe que se sentia mal e quase n?o dormira  noite. Quando lhe perguntou qual a causa, a sr.a Bell declarou que se tratava de rumores inexplicveis; parecera-lhe ter ouvido algum a andar de um quarto para o outro; acordou o marido e f-lo levantar-se para trancar as janelas. A princpio tentou afirmar  sr.a Pulver que possivelmente se tratasse de ratos. Posteriormente, confessou n?o saber qual a raz?o de tais rumores, para ela inexplicveis.     A jovem Lucretia Pulver tambm testemunhou os fenmenos inslitos observados naquela casa. Eis o seu relato:     Vivi naquela casa durante um inverno, com a famlia Bell. Trabalhava para ela uma parte do dia, e o resto do tempo ia  escola ou bordava. Vivi assim cerca de trs meses. No fim desse perodo frequentemente ouvia batidas na cama e abaixo dos ps da mesma. Ouvi uma por??o de noites, pois dormia nesse quarto todo o tempo que l estive. Uma noite parece-me ter ouvido um homem andando pela dispensa. Esta pe?a era separada do quarto pela escada. A senhorita Aurlia Losey ficou comigo naquela noite; ela tambm ouviu o barulho e ambas ficmos muito assustadas; levantmo-nos, fechmos as janelas e trancamos a porta. Parece que algum andava pela dispensa, na adega e at no por?o, onde o barulho cessava. Nessa ocasi?o n?o havia mais ningum na casa, excepto o meu irm?ozinho, adormecido no mesmo quarto que ns. Isto foi cerca da meia-noite. N?o tnhamos dormido quando ouvimos o barulho. O sr. e a sr.a Bell tinham ido a Loch Berlin, onde ficariam at o dia seguinte. (Doyle, A.C. - Histria do Espiritismo, S?o Paulo, Pensamento, 1960, pp. 483-484).     Lucretia Pulver em outro testemunho, tambm diz:    A Sra. Aurlia Losey ficou comigo naquela noite; ela, tambm, ouviu o barulho e ambas ficamos muito assustadas; levantamo-nos e fechamos as janelas e trancamos a porta. Parece que algum andava pela despensa, na adega, e at no por?o, onde o barulho cessava.    Os Bell terminaram por mudar-se daquela casa.     Em 1846, instalou-se ali a famlia Weekman: sr. Michael Weekman, sr.a Hannah Weekman e suas filhas. Alguns dias aps se terem alojado na referida casa, passaram a ser perturbados por rudos inslitos: batidas na porta de entrada, sem que ningum visvel o estivesse fazendo; passos de algum andando na adega, ou dentro de|`|520426e9136b4feca88a90709afa2e94aa	Irm?s Fox     Em dezembro de 1847 uma famlia metodista de nome Fox alugou uma casa em vilarejo tpico de New York chamado Hydesville. Nessa famlia havia duas filhas de nome Margaret de 14 anos e Kate, de 11 anos. Em 1848 surgiram na casa rudos, arranh?es, batidas, sons semelhantes ao arrastar de mveis que n?o deixava as meninas dormir, a n?o ser no quarto de seus pais. T?o vibrantes eram esses sons que as camas tremiam e moviam-se. As irm?s Fox iniciaram o dilogo com o esprito batedor, fato este que passou a histria do Espiritismo como o episdio de Hydesville.    Passado esse acontecimento no qual as meninas ficaram conhecidas, estas iniciaram sess?es em New York e em outros lugares, triunfando em cada ensaio a que eram submetidas. Durante esses atos de mediunidade pblica, em que provocavam indigna??o as mo?as entre pessoas que n?o tinham a menor idia do significado religioso dessa nova revela??o, entre aqueles cujo interesse estava na esperan?a de vantagens materiais, as irm?s estiveram expostas s enervantes influncias das sess?es promscuas de tal maneira que nenhum esprita conhecedor da problemtica ousaria assim proceder. Naquela ocasi?o os perigos de tais prticas n?o eram t?o notados quanto agora, nem ao povo ocorria que n?o era possvel que espritos elevados baixassem  terra para dar conselhos acerca das a??es das estradas de ferro ou solu??es para os casos amorosos. Contra a sua forma??o moral das quais jamais houve qualquer suspeita, mas elas tinham enveredado por um caminho que conduz a degenera??o da mente e do carter, embora s muitos anos mais tarde tivessem manifestado os mais srios efeitos.    Em 1852, o Dr. Elisha Kane, de origem puritana pois considerava a Bblia como a ltima e definitiva palavra de inspira??o divina, encontra Margaret e com ela veio a casar-se. Kane estava convencido de que a jovem estava envolvida em fraude e nas cartas que lhe enviava a acusava continuamente de viver em erro e hipocrisia. Kane estava convencido de que a irm? mais velha de Margaret, Leah, visando fins lucrativos estava explorando a fraude.    O casamento durou at 1857, ocasi?o em que a viva, ent?o se assinando Mrs. Fox-Kane, abjurou os fen?menos por algum tempo e foi recebida na Igreja Catlica Romana. Em 1871, depois de mais de 2O anos de trabalho exaustivo, ainda as encontramos recebendo entusistico apoio e admira??o de muitos homens e senhoras importantes da poca. S depois de 4O anos de trabalhos pblicos  que se manifestaram condi??es adversas em suas vidas. Foi em 1871 que, gra?as a generosidade de Mr. Charles Livermore, eminente banqueiro de New York, Kate Fox visitou a Inglaterra. Era um sinal de gratid?o do banqueiro pela consola??o que havia recebido de sua for?a maravilhosa e um apoio para o progresso do Espiritismo. Ele proveu todas as suas necessidades e assim evitou que ela tivesse de recorrer ao trabalho remunerado.|`|cce04ec55210b86cedb0edb1318de677aa	As suas perguntas sao todas inteligentes e extramente originais como as ultimas 3 que voce fez nos ultimos 3 minutos??|`|1a4f95204d9887a97c52284a93ff5dccaa	foram filhas da senhora Fox e do senhor Fox... enfim, a familia Raposa.

Not the cute toddler kind, the newborn, screaming kind.  If possible, arrange with a friend or relative who has a newborn to allow you and your child to look after the baby for a few hours so the new mom can get a break.  Then instruct your child as to proper care, feeding, changing, etc. while he/she does all the work.  You would think that this would make a teen want to have a baby more, but in my experience it makes the teen realize how much work is involved and never want to have one!    Also, don't prohibit them from having sex.  Make sure they understand how serious it is, and what precautions have to be taken, and why.

Harold Camping (I love to listen to his show) believes that all Churches and organized forms of Christianity are of the devil, and that only Christians who worship in their own homes are on the right track. He also believes that you can't do anything to receive salvation. He says that you can only hope, and just wait for God to save you at some point (he's says you'll know when it happens).    Charles Stanley, as far as I know, is your typical Evangelical - but he could have gone off in the deep end.

He is pastor to over 30,000 members of Lakewood Church in Houston Texas.  His sermons are so wonderful. He touches people's lives and truly tries to help people. He is not known for being greedy either.  What I love about Joel is that he is not a legalist.  Too many legalists quote scripture left and right but then don't live what they profess to be. I don't believe Joel is a hypocrite at all. He lives what he believes and believes what he lives.   He is not a judgmental hypocrite like some pastors are. God bless him and no it is not a cult.

d16fb3fa430664b363f97eb6e750c018aa	Die in den Ursprachen fr Seele gebrauchten W?rter (hebr.: nphesch; gr.: psyche) bezeichnen in der Bibel eine Person, ein Tier oder das Leben, dessen sich Mensch oder Tier erfreuen.    Als die inspirierten Bibelschreiber das entsprechende hebr?ische oder griechische Wort gebrauchten, hatten sie nicht das im Sinn, was man heute meistens unter ?Seele versteht. Das wird immer mehr anerkannt. 1976 schrieb Professor Claus Westermann in dem Werk Biblischer Kommentar: Altes Testament (Bd. I/1, 1976, S. 283) nach einer eingehenden Untersuchung des Gebrauchs von nphesch: ?Der von Gott geschaffene Mensch ist der lebendige Mensch. Hier wurde eine fr das Menschenverst?ndnis der Bibel wichtige Aussage gemacht: der Mensch wird zur lebendigen Seele geschaffen, es wird nicht in seinen K?rper ?eine lebendige Seele hineingegeben. Der Mensch in seinem Lebendigsein ist ganzheitlich verstanden. Ein Verst?ndnis, nach dem der Mensch aus Leib und Seele bestnde, ist damit ausgeschlossen. (Siehe auch Journal of Biblical Literature, Bd. XVI, 1897, S. 30.)    Als die Jewish Publication Society of America eine neue bersetzung der Thora, der ersten fnf Bcher der Bibel, herausgab, sagte der Hauptherausgeber, H. M. Orlinsky vom Hebrew Union College (New York Times, 12. Oktober 1962), da? das Wort ?Seele in dieser bersetzung eigentlich vermieden wurde, weil ?es sich dabei um die Wiedergabe des hebr?ischen Wortes ?Nefesch handelt. Er fgte hinzu: ?Andere bersetzer haben es mit ?Seele wiedergegeben, aber das ist v?llig ungenau. Die Bibel sagt nicht, wir h?tten eine Seele. ?Nefesch ist die Person selbst, ihr Nahrungsbedrfnis, das Blut in ihren Adern, ihr Wesen.    Welchen Ursprung hat die Lehre von einer unsichtbaren und unsterblichen Menschenseele?    Die Schwierigkeit liegt darin, da? die Bedeutungen, die dem Wort ?Seele im allgemeinen beigelegt werden, nicht aus den Hebr?ischen Schriften oder den Christlichen Griechischen Schriften stammen, sondern in erster Linie aus der griechischen Philosophie des Altertums, dem heidnischen religi?sen Gedankengut. Der griechische Philosoph Platon beispielsweise zitierte Sokrates wie folgt: ?Wenn die Seele sich lauter und rein vom K?rper trennt, ohne etwas von ihm mit sich zu ziehen, geht sie doch zu dem ihr ?hnlichen Unsichtbaren, dem G?ttlichen, Unsterblichen und Vernnftigen. Wenn sie aber dorthin gelangt, wird ihr Glckseligkeit zuteil, und sie ist von Irrtum und Unwissenheit, Furcht und allen anderen menschlichen beln befreit, indem sie wirklich mit den G?ttern vereint lebt (Phaidon, bersetzt von F. Schleiermacher, 1982, Kap. 29, S. 61).  In direktem Gegensatz zu der griechischen Lehre, da? die psyche (Seele) unstofflich, nicht greifbar, unsichtbar und unsterblich sei, zeigt die Bibel, da? sowohl mit psyche als auch mit nphesch, auf irdische Gesch?pfe angewandt, Stoffliches, Greifbares, Sichtbares und Sterbliches gemeint ist. usw.

Es mu? der Mensch wiedergeboren werden,  nicht aber Christus, Der das Leben ist. Es mu? der Mensch zum Leben kommen und Christus wird durch die werkt?tige Liebe im Herzen aufgenommen.    Zum anderen k?nnten wir ohne Gottes Kraft auch irdisch nicht leben, da wir aber v?llig licht- und kraftlos geworden sind, ist uns aus Gnaden ein Anteil Gottes, ein winzigstes Fnklein aus Ihm Selbst als Liebekraft beigegeben, das, als ein Teil von Gottes Wesen, best?ndig mit Ihm in Verbindung steht, was allerdings dem lieblosen Weltmenschen unbewu?t v?llig entgeht.  Denn je mehr er also der Welt (noch) zugewandt ist, ist auch dieses Fnklein wie ganz und gar verschttet von Hllen und Schlacken umgeben.  Aufl?sen kann er sie nur durch ein Liebeleben, denn die Liebe erwecket in ihm, in seiner Seele den "g?ttlichen" Geist, und sowie er sich also Gottes Willen, der Liebe fordert unterstellt, ist es nun sein Geist in ihm, der ihn "gewissenhaft" aus Gott belehret und den Weg erhellt..     Gott also wird dem,der sich zu Ihmwendet immer etwas ins Herze legen, das Fnklein wird sich regen und   es wird nun von der Ihm h?rigen Seele vernommen, was wiederum bedeutet es  wird auch zum Verstande kommen, was Gott dem Menschen schenkt, weil er es nun nach seiner Weise "denkt" oder erspret, weil Gott recht fhret, nimmt der Mensch nur gl?ubig an, da? Gott mit uns reden will und es auch kann.    Wenn wir also im innigsten Verh?ltnis zu Jesus Christus in das eigene Heiligtum unseres Tempels treten, in das stille K?mmerlein, um unsere Gedanken zu erheben, zu beten, dann geht gewi? auch Antwort ein, so wir nur in der Stille verbleiben und warten und lauschen, was gleichwohl ernstliches Wahrheitsverlangen und ungezweifelten Glauben bedingt. Und Deine Liebe ist der Garant, das eine rechte Verbindung gelingt.     Dann tritt auch Jesus Christus als ein Gast bei Dir ein und wird doch Dein Gastgeber sein, das Abendmahl mit Dir zu halten, um so sicherer je mehr wir uns selbst zur Liebe umgestalten.

968bc7c8dfa5c8ee23e19a7e540db963aa	Lotus scientifically known as Nelumbo Nucifera is the National Flower of India. It is a sacred flower and occupies a unique position in the art and mythology of ancient India and has been an auspicious symbol of Indian culture since time immemorial. The Lotus symbolises divinity, fertility, wealth, knowledge and not to forget enlightenment. Lending to its uniqueness, the flower grows in murky waters and rises on a long stalk above the surface to bloom glorious. It is also a symbol of triumph, since the lotus is rooted in the mud and can survive to regerminate for thousands of years. It represents long life, honor, and good fortune.    Untouched by the impurity, lotus symbolises the purity of heart and mind. Human beings are instructed by Indian scripture to live a life of non-attachment, which is very hard. The lotus holds additional significance for Hindus, as it is a symbol of God and used often in religious practices. Then in Indian thought, there is the last and final lotus - Charan Kamal or lotus feet of the Almighty. It was this depth of thought that made the founding fathers of modern India enshrine the lotus in the Constitution as the National Flower.|`|AA11994418	Because it grows in dirty mud and water and is unique to India.|`|AA11589587	Though Lotus grows from water, if you watch, the drops of water never binds the petals.

Six thousand years ago, still man could not understand how God created the world and man, they tried to retell the story that way; however, no other book in those prehistorical days can tell a cleverer story than that.  Today those who don't believe in God imagine that man comes from the monkey, monkey comes from dust, without knowing where dust comes from!  Those who believe in God are thinking about the explanation made by the Manifestation of God concerning the command 'be' and 'it is', and they see that the Creator doesn't create like men. Men create nothing, they make dead things from the already available dust! God creates living things from utter nothingness.  Let us humbly learn the truth from the Manifestation of God in order to understand more and more about things that we never can create.

I was somewhat shy too.   I learned to listen and I wrote down the topics that were discussed and went to the library and began to study and learn a little about each one.  I was surprised at myself and how much I liked learning and I was able to contribute something the the conversation.   Now we have the computer and I no longer have to go to the library.  Nearly every day I look up a word in the dictionary and always look up something I want to learn about on the computer.  I looked up the Puritans and Quakers today.  Very interesting.  On my list tomorrow is The Mad Hatters of Dan-bury.  I think now I have learned a little about what ever the topic might be.  I am over my shyness  and feel I'm somewhat intelligent.  It will take a little time but do try it.  Thanks for allowing me to share with you.|`|AA11402196	No. Just human.

Well from your question, I find that you are listening when people talk of topics strange to you, also, you are trying to figure out what they say is real, true or just imagination...but tell me what is it u find as strange topic...    Do i take it that you r a person in your early teen and u r eager to know more of what is happening around you...no doubt its a good sign that you are not talkative but listening, which helps you get to know what is talked about for your find out in your spare time what was talked about...    should you wish to know or get your doubts clarified, you must speak up...but with caution, for you should not be misguided or mislead to thoughts or acts that will not make you comfortable...    learning is a continuous process and it happens all around us...so become smart...u must keep your eyes, earns open and permit yourself the liberty to talk or ask questions after you really run the question in mind thoroughly...    nothing is Right or Wrong...its just the way once perceives...but everything ones freedom ends where the other persons nose begins...|`|86c35132ad012227ae034c5da595a952aa	I know what you mean about this one. I always feel like asking this question. I get really nervous in front of other people when they are talking about politics or things of that matter, because I feel like I cannot contribute to the conversation. I just try to listen and be honest about you know, I'm sorry I don't know what your talking about and I ask questions so then I do know. That really helps and the next time your in that type of situation, you'll know what to say. Also when you go home that night, try to learn more about what topics you were unsure of. Just be honest, ask questions, and gain as much knowledge as you possibly can. Without much knowledge, you just wont make it in life.

O know-how ou conhecimento processual  o conhecimento de como executar alguma tarefa. O know-how  diferente de outros tipos do conhecimento tais como o conhecimento proposicional que pode diretamente ser aplicado a uma tarefa. O conhecimento processual sobre resolver problemas difere do conhecimento proposicional sobre resolver de problema. Para o exemplo, em alguns sistemas legais, este conhecimento ou know-how estiveram considerados a propriedade intelectual de uma companhia, e podem ser transferidos quando essa companhia compra. Uma limita??o do conhecimento processual  seu trabalho-dependncia; assim tende a ser mais menos geral do que o conhecimento proposicional. Para o exemplo, um perito de computador pode ter o conhecimento sobre um algoritmo do computador em lnguas mltiplas, ou no pseudocdigo, visto que um programador Visual Basic pode somente saber sobre uma execu??o especfica desse algoritmo, escrito em Visual Basic. Assim a percia e a experincia manual do programador Visual Basic puderam ser do valor comercial somente aos job-shops de Microsoft, para o exemplo. Uma vantagem do conhecimento processual  que pode envolver mais sentidos, tais como a experincia manual, pratica em resolver problemas, compreens?o das limita??es de uma solu??o especfica, etc.. Assim o know-how pode freqentemente eclipsar a teoria.|`|befcfd6d83a6aba5a5a3e95a0c85e0c4aa	ahiuahiauh pergunta no sense.. ou ser non sense? know sense? nou cence ???ahiuahaiuhaiuhaiuhaiuahiuahiauh|`|9e16ab711fce9547c9e78ca037fe1561aa	non how|`|20cb1378f988bb8d4dc672bb372720c0aa	Meu Deus! rs|`|8346468573598bccfd44a72575837594aa	Bem, non how ou non-how est?o ambos errados.

Por exemplo: O crime se organizou como um grande negcio, o mais lucrativo dos dias de hoje. A organiza??o desse negcio n?o poderia ser feita por favelados, pois as drogas necessariamente s?o extradas de plantas, atravs de um processamento. Tinha que haver terras para o plantio, indstria de processamento, meios de transportes, caros, como avi?es helicpteros, carros etc. Favelados n?o teriam condi??es de organizar tamanho negocio. Ent?o n?o podemos procurar nas favelas os responsveis por essa organiza??o. Que tal procurar nos bairros nobres das grandes cidades do mundo. At banqueiros com certeza est?o por traz disso.

Alis, cabe aqui ressaltarmos algumas defini??es sobre o Pai Celestial:    O que  Deus?   Deus  a inteligncia suprema, causa primria de todas as coisas.    O que devemos entender por infinito?   O que n?o tem come?o nem fim; o desconhecido; tudo o que   desconhecido  infinito.    Poderamos dizer que Deus  infinito?   Defini??o incompleta. Pobreza da linguagem dos homens, que  insuficiente para definir as coisas que est?o acima de sua inteligncia. Deus  infinito em suas perfei??es, mas o infinito  uma abstra??o. Dizer que Deus  infinito  tomar o atributo de uma coisa por ela prpria,  definir uma coisa que n?o  conhecida por uma outra igualmente desconhecida.    Onde podemos encontrar a prova da existncia de Deus?   Num axioma que aplicais s vossas cincias: n?o h efeito sem causa. Procurai a causa de tudo o que n?o  obra do homem, e a vossa raz?o vos responder. Para acreditar em Deus, basta ao homem lan?ar os olhos sobre as obras da cria??o. O universo existe, portanto ele tem uma causa. Duvi-  dar da existncia de Deus seria negar que todo efeito tem uma causa e admitir que o nada p?de fazer alguma coisa.    Que conclus?o podemos tirar do sentimento intuitivo que todos  os homens trazem em si mesmos da existncia de Deus?   A de que Deus existe; de onde lhes viria esse sentimento se repousasse sobre o nada?  ainda uma conseqncia do princpio de que n?o h efeito sem causa.    O sentimento ntimo que temos em ns da existncia de Deus  n?o seria o efeito da educa??o e das idias adquiridas?   Se fosse assim, por que vossos selvagens teriam tambm esse sentimento? Se o sentimento da existncia de um ser supremo fosse o produto de um ensinamento, n?o seria universal. Somente existiria naqueles que tivessem recebido esse ensinamento, como acontece com os conhecimentos cientficos.    Poderemos encontrar a causa primria da forma??o das coisas  nas propriedades ntimas da matria?   Mas, ent?o, qual teria sido a causa dessas propriedades? Sempre  preciso uma causa primria. Atribuir a forma??o primria das coisas s propriedades ntimas da matria seria tomar o efeito pela causa, porque essas propriedades s?o elas mesmas um efeito que deve ter uma causa.    O que pensar da opini?o que atribui a forma??o primria a uma  combina??o acidental e imprevista da matria, ou seja, ao acaso?   Outro absurdo! Que homem de bom senso pode conceber o acaso como um ser inteligente? E, alm de tudo, o que  o acaso? Nada.  A harmonia que regula as atividades do universo revela combina??es e objetivos determinados e, por isso mesmo, um poder inteligente. Atribuir a forma??o primria ao acaso seria um contra-senso, porque o acaso  cego e n?o pode produzir os efeitos que a inteligncia produz. Um acaso inteligente n?o seria mais um acaso.    Onde  que se v na causa primria a manifesta??o de uma  inteligncia suprema e superior a todas as inteligncias?   Tendes um provrbio que diz: Pela obra reconhece-se o autor. Pois bem: olhai a obra e procurai o autor.  o orgulho que causa a incredulidade. O homem orgulhoso n?o admite nada acima dele;  por isso que se julga um esprito forte. Pobre ser, que um sopro de Deus pode abater! Julga-se o poder de uma inteligncia por suas obras.

AA12374956	Umm, I hate to tell you this, but you have some theological errors going on there.  The rapture is a fake. The most troubling problem with this theory is that it seems to negate the vary words of Jesus.    Another parable put He forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field: But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way. But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also. So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? From whence then hath it tares? He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn. (Matthew 13:24  29 KJV)    Now that is an interesting story, and it can be a little confusing; fortunately, because the disciples found this story a little confusing they also and asked Jesus to explain if further. Because our God is not a God of confusion (1 Corinthians 14:33), Jesus explained what this parable meant.    Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field. He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man; The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one; The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels. As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world. The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear. (Matthew 13:36  42 KJV)    A closer study of this parable would seem to completely disprove the theory of a secret rapture of the church. Lets take a look at what Jesus had to say about the time of the end through this parable. There are two groups on the earth represented by the wheat (the good or the church) and the tares (the evil). The workers of the field (probably representing angels) are troubled by the tares that the evil one (the devil) has planted. They ask the farmer (Jesus) if they should gather the weeds now and purify the field (the world). The farmer (Jesus) said that it should not happen that way because some of the wheat may come up with the tares. He then declares, Let both grow together until the harvest (the end of the world): and in the time of harvest (the end of the world) I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn. I find it hard to be a proponent of a secret rapture for the church when Jesus said that both the good and the evil will grow together until the harvest (the end of the world). How can the church be raptured, leaving the evil on the earth, when Jesus said they will be together until the very end?    There is another issue raised by this parable. Many well intentioned Christians use the story in Matthew 24:40 & 41 and Luke 17:34  36 as key proof of a secret rapture for the church, but if we examine this story about the end times with the earlier story Jesus told about the end times in Matthew 13, we get a completely different picture from what most Christians interpret this story to mean. Lets look at what Jesus said in these verses.    Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left. Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left. Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come. (Matthew 24:40  42 KJV)    I tell you, in that night there shall be two men in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left. Two women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other left. Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left. (Luke 17:34  36 KJV)    Now I do not think that I am wrong in thinking that most Christians interpret these stories to mean that the man taken from the field, the woman that is taken while grinding, and the man taken in his sleep are the ones that belong to the group that is the church and are ruptured. This does not seem to be a plausible explanation however. Jesus gives an order for things to happen back in Matthew 13. Gather ye together first the tares (the evil), and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat (the good or the church) into my barn. Jesus clearly says that the evil will be gathered first. If we take this understanding and apply it to Matthew 24 and Luke 17, we get a very different understanding. The ones that are taken are not in the group we want to be in. The ones who are taken are the tares (the evil) that are being gathered to be burned, but the ones that are left are the wheat (the good) that are saved.    There is another metaphor that many well intentioned Christians use to support a secret rapture for the church; I feel that this too is an invalid interpretation of a story.    But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up.

Assim, o que eu sinto desde que tomei conscincia: "Deus" quer que eu seja questionador, que eu veja a hipocrisia, que eu n?o aceite tacitamente o que me jogam, pois a sim est o "dem?nio", "vender sua alma". Em poucos minutos ouvindo qualquer tipo de prega??o ou palavra escrita, voc facilmente identificar algo que quebra totalmente o conceito inteiro. E a partir deste ponto, as palavras tornam-se vazias.|`|3a93bccf1f5163298859bd67e7a23312aa	Deus nos ama, nos d o livre arbitrio, porm temos a Bblia Sagrada para nos orientar.|`|6b35ca981347a807af811d754498aa80aa	sim|`|041e6252efb55962f9628b5aef9cc230aa	Deus respeita o nosso Livre-arbtrio, somos livres para seguirmos o caminho que acharmos melhor, mas somos responsabilizados por nossos feitos. A semeadura  livre mas a colheita  obrigatria``, a cada um  dado de acordo com as suas obras``.    1. Que  Deus?    "Deus  a inteligncia suprema, causa primria de todas as coisas"    2. Que se deve entender por infinito?    "O que n?o tem come?o nem fim: o desconhecido; tudo que  desconhecido  infinito."    3. Poder-se-ia dizer que Deus  o infinito?    "Defini??o incompleta. Pobreza da linguagem humana, insuficiente para definir o que est acima da linguagem dos homens."  Deus  infinito em Suas perfei??es, mas o infinito  uma abstra??o. Dizer que Deus  o infinito  tomar o atributo de uma coisa pela coisa mesma,  definir uma coisa que n?o est conhecida por uma outra que n?o est mais do que a primeira.    Provas da existncia de Deus    4. Onde se pode encontrar a prova da existncia de Deus?    "Num axioma que aplicais s vossas cincias. N?o h efeito sem causa. Procurai a causa de tudo o que n?o  obra do homem e a vossa raz?o responder."    Para crer-se em Deus, basta se lance o olhar sobre as obras da Cria??o. O Universo existe, logo tem uma causa. Duvidar da existncia de Deus  negar que todo efeito tem uma causa e avan?ar que o nada p?de fazer alguma coisa.    5. Que dedu??o se pode tirar do sentimento instintivo, que todos os homens trazem em si, da existncia de Deus?    "A de que Deus existe; pois, donde lhes viria esse sentimento, se n?o tivesse uma base?  ainda uma conseqncia do princpio - n?o h efeito sem causa."    6. O sentimento ntimo que temos da existncia de Deus n?o poderia ser fruto da educa??o, resultado de idias adquiridas?    "Se assim fosse, por que existiria nos vossos selvagens esse sentimento?"    Se o sentimento da existncia de um ser supremo fosse t?o-somente produto de um ensino, n?o seria universal e n?o existiria sen?o nos que houvessem podido receber esse ensino, conforme se d com as no??es cientficas.    7. Poder-se-ia achar nas propriedades ntimas da matria a causa primria da forma??o das coisas?    "Mas, ent?o, qual seria a causa dessas propriedades?  indispensvel sempre uma causa primria."    Atribuir a forma??o primria das coisas s propriedades ntimas da matria seria tomar o efeito pela causa, porquanto essas propriedades s?o, tambm elas, um efeito que h de ter uma causa.    8. Que se deve pensar da opini?o dos que atribuem a forma??o primria a uma combina??o fortuita da matria, ou, por outra, ao acaso?    "Outro absurdo! Que homem de bom-senso pode considerar o acaso um ser inteligente? E, demais, que  o acaso? Nada."    A harmonia existente no mecanismo do Universo patenteia combina??es e desgnios determinados e, por isso mesmo, revela um poder inteligente. Atribuir a forma??o primria ao acaso  insensatez, pois que o acaso  cego e n?o pode produzir os efeitos que a inteligncia produz. Um acaso inteligente j n?o seria acaso.    9. Em que  que, na causa primria, se revela uma inteligncia suprema e superior a todas as inteligncias?    "Tendes um provrbio que diz: Pela obra se reconhece o autor. Pois bem! Vede a obra e procurai o autor. O orgulho  que gera a incredulidade. O homem orgulhoso nada admite acima de si. Por isso  que ele se denomina a si mesmo de esprito forte. Pobre ser, que um sopro de Deus pode abater!"    Do poder de uma inteligncia se julga pelas obras. N?o podendo nenhum ser humano criar o que a Natureza produz, a causa primria , conseguintemente, uma inteligncia superior  Humanidade.    Quaisquer que sejam os prodgios que a inteligncia humana tenha operado, ela prpria tem uma causa e, quanto maior for o que opere, tanto maior h de ser a causa primria. Aquela inteligncia superior  que  a causa primria de todas as coisas, seja qual for o nome que lhe dem.        Atributos da divindade    10. Pode o homem compreender a natureza ntima de Deus?    "N?o; falta-lhe para isso o sentido."    11. Ser dado um dia ao homem compreender o mistrio da Divindade?    "Quando n?o mais tiver o esprito obscurecido pela matria. Quando, pela sua perfei??o, se houver aproximado de Deus, ele o ver e compreender."    A inferioridade das faculdades do homem n?o lhe permite compreender a natureza ntima de Deus. Na infancia da Humanidade, o homem O confunde muitas vezes com a criatura, cujas imperfei??es lhe atribui; mas,  medida que nele se desenvolve o senso moral, seu pensamento penetra melhor no amago das coisas; ent?o, faz idia mais justa da Divindade e, ainda que sempre incompleta, mais conforme  s? raz?o.    12. Embora n?o possamos compreender a natureza ntima de Deus, podemos formar idia de algumas de Suas perfei??es?    "De algumas, sim. O homem as compreende melhor  propor??o que se eleva acima da matria. Entrev-as pelo pensamento."    13. Quando dizemos que Deus  eterno, infinito, imutvel, imaterial, nico, onipotente, soberanamente justo e bom, temos idia completa de Seus atributos?    "Do vosso ponto de vista, sim, porque credes abranger tudo. Sabei, porm, que h coisas que est?o acima da inteligncia do homem mais inteligente, as quais a vossa linguagem, restrita s vossas idias e sensa??es, n?o tem meios de exprimir. A raz?o, com efeito, vos diz que Deus deve possuir em grau supremo essas perfei??es, porquanto, se uma Lhe faltasse, ou n?o fosse infinita, j Ele n?o seria superior a tudo, n?o seria, por conseguinte, Deus. Para estar acima de todas as coisas, Deus tem que se achar isento de qualquer vicissitude e|`|3f2e30d9cfd09016cd2822d3d781d9d7aa	Querida, Gente com "G"    DEUS nos deu algo que se chama livre-arbitrio, ou poder de escolha ou ainda poder de pensar...

Some people are more sensitive to it than others and some people are just pigs and don't care.  Spooky sometimes isn't it.... I agree with your confusion and disgust over this subject.    I was on line in the Walmart on day with my son and there was a woman behind me with a HUGE festering thing on her hand wrapped up in a bandage and oozing.  It literally smelled like death...  My son (who is on eye level) was staring at her HORRIFIED and he was 5 at the time and knew better than to go outside without at least doing SOMETHING to curb the stink and the unsightly mess of it.      Needless to say, I ran home and washed us both from head to toe!    I think people are totally clueless to the fact that dead skin cells and gasses sluff off of and excrete from off of you and travel through the air and up into the nose of  anyone close enough to smell them, esentially making that person A PART OF YOU on a microscopic level....  Gross thought huh?  Scares me half to death if I think about it too much.  If I had my way, I would never leave the house!

AA10680367	wanna read quran ,u'll find ur hadith inside this site http://faithfreedom.org|`|587e1cb8d798bdb9902f704f41a32cc2aa	It all depends on whether the Hadith is authentic or not. Many people throughout history have tried to make fake hadithes and distort the original ones. I have heard many muslim scholars who clearly recite the fake Hadithes and can even convince people that these are the authentic Hadith.  That is how these so-called Muslims manipulate the minds of the youngf to commit suicide which is STRICTLY forbidden in Islam along with to kill innocent people.
AA12008845	We don't!  And you are right, there may be other holy books out there.  Still the existing holy book, doesn't deny these possibilities either.  Who is judging which one is right?  With an effort not to be gender biased ... MAN is making that judgment in the form of religion (their organization).  This judgment of faith is essentially a bet that their religion is right and the other guy's religion is ... less right.  The only way to say with absolute certainty that one book is right and the others are wrong is to have faith.  This task is easier to accomplish by turning off your brain.|`|3a15a185741af8118978069daa9d695daa	I love you question! I'm a Chistian, but do not try to "sway" people my way.

That there is an objective standard of right and wrong. In other words, we CAN distinguish between right and wrong. But the moment you ask "Who is to judge?" you undermine that ability to discern. The question is not WHO gets to decide what is right or wrong, but WHAT is that which is right or wrong. What is the criteria for truth, or how do we go about examining it? It would be inconsistent for us to be particularly agnostic about truth in religion whereas we are not in many other areas of life.|`|0c5a61837b26b1417112d43dbbcdcc1eaa	The Bible is the the word of God. It is divinely ispired by God and is inerrant. All other books are not from God, thus they are not holy. There are not inconsistancies in the Bible, where there are in other books.

As for all books of holy significance, they stem from the same source, but as for what teaching is true, the real problem is, what were the original teachings in the first holy book the Bible is derived from?

Xavier  extrado do livro Pronto Socorro ed. CEU)      O suicdio    Cheyla Toledo Bernardo    As causas mais comuns do suicdio, em todos os tempos, s?o o desgosto pela vida, as depress?es, os insucessos amorosos ou financeiros. Algumas pessoas s?o levadas a esse ato por desespero, outras chegam a premeditar o fim da prpria vida. Todos tm como objetivo fugir das dificuldades deste mundo, passando para um mundo melhor ou simplesmente para o nada.    As religi?es sempre se pronunciaram contra esse ato, baseadas no fato de que somente Deus tem o direito de tirar qualquer vida, pois  Ele quem a d.    A Doutrina Esprita, alm de concordar com a opini?o acima, prova que o nada n?o existe, que o indivduo sobrevive ao tmulo, mostrando-se um poderoso antdoto contra o suicdio. A vida alm da morte caracteriza-se pela continua??o do homem com todas as suas caractersticas: moral, inteligncia, angstias, problemas, dores, felicidade. A nica coisa que o ser deixa na Terra  o corpo e seus bens materiais. Desta forma, ao tentar fugir de um sofrimento atravs do suicdio, o esprito percebe que, alm de nada ter adiantado, ainda perdeu a oportunidade que tinha de conquistar coisas boas enquanto estava no plano terreno.    Em O Livro dos Espritos, quest?es 943 a 957, Kardec formula uma srie de perguntas sobre o suicdio aos Espritos da falange da Verdade. Eles esclarecem que aqueles que chegam ao suicdio s?o levados pela ociosidade, ignorancia e pela falta de f. Em contrapartida, o trabalho e a religiosidade seriam o remdio para aliviar aqueles que sofrem e pensam em libertar-se deste modo.    O suicdio, sendo uma transgress?o da Lei Divina (n?o matars), traz sempre uma conseqncia dolorosa para quem o comete, que varia segundo as causas e as inten??es que o moveram. Entretanto, Kardec cita algumas conseqncias gerais que o esprito enfrenta ao chegar no alm pelas vias do suicdio:    957. Quais s?o, em geral, as conseqncias do suicido sobre o estado do esprito?    "- As conseqncias do suicdio s?o as mais diversas. N?o h penalidades fixadas e em todos os casos elas s?o sempre relativas s causas que o produziram. Mas uma conseqncia a que o suicida n?o pode escapar  o desapontamento. De resto, a sorte n?o  a mesma para todos, dependendo das circunstancias. Alguns expiam sua falta imediatamente, outros numa prova numa nova existncia, que ser pior do que aquela cujo curso interromperam. ...H, porm, as que s?o comuns a todos os casos de morte violenta, as que decorrem da interrup??o brusca da vida.  primeiro a persistncia mais prolongada e mais tenaz do la?o que liga o Esprito e o corpo... As conseqncias desse estado de coisas s?o o prolongamento da perturba??o esprita, seguido da ilus?o que, durante um tempo mais ou menos longo, faz o Esprito acreditar que ainda se encontra no nmero dos vivos. A afinidade que persiste entre o Esprito e o corpo produz, em alguns suicidas, uma espcie de repercuss?o do estado do corpo sobre o Esprito, que assim ressente, malgrado seu, os efeitos da decomposi??o, experimentando uma sensa??o cheia de angstias e horror... Esse efeito n?o  geral; mas em alguns casos o suicida n?o se livra das conseqncias da sua falta de coragem e cedo ou tarde expia essa falta...

Ao longo da histria, surgiram vrias teorias que tentavam explicar as nossas diferen?as de comportamento. Alguns, como os defensores da hereditariedade, acreditava, que todos os tra?os psicolgicos eram transmitidos hereditariamente. Outras teorias explicavam que o meio ambiente era a causa das diferen?as individuais dos sujeitos: todos nascemos iguais (geneticamente) e as diferen?as que depois se v?o construindo, surgem apenas do mundo exterior, ou seja, o meio ambiente que rodeia cada um  que o vai moldar "dia aps dia", n?o h mais factores.    Para avaliar em que grau as pessoas se assemelham ou diferem entre si, a psicologia diferencial criou o mtodo diferencial, um meio para medir as diferen?as. Este mtodo permite ao investigador observar dois ou mais grupos que se encontram diferenciados na base de uma varivel (fato que depende de outros fatos) pr-existente, isto , h uma varivel responsvel pela constitui??o dos grupos.

Outras teorias explicavam que o meio ambiente era a causa das diferen?as individuais dos sujeitos: todos nascemos iguais (geneticamente) e as diferen?as que depois se v?o construindo, surgem apenas do mundo exterior, ou seja, o meio ambiente que rodeia cada um  que o vai moldar "dia aps dia", n?o h mais factores.    Para avaliar em que grau as pessoas se assemelham ou diferem entre si, a psicologia diferencial criou o mtodo diferencial, um meio para medir as diferen?as. Este mtodo permite ao investigador observar dois ou mais grupos que se encontram diferenciados na base de uma varivel (fato que depende de outros fatos) pr-existente, isto , h uma varivel responsvel pela constitui??o dos grupos.

This gift was given to them by God, to tell us of the things to come. Not all of the people that have read these prophecies, believe them although they, systematically, have happened. let me give you a recent fulfillment of a prophesy.  The Bible spoke of Israel, as if it existed, this prophesy gave the opposers of the scripture, material to discredit its veracity since Israel did not exist as a nation since the year 80 a.d. But the prophesy spoke about what Israel was going to go through. This came true in 1948, when the League of Nations approved the creation of the State of Israel, so you see, the people that wrote about the future knew about this up coming of Israel because they saw it coming with their own eyes. Of course, the prophets obey God in every respect. I'm not so sure about modern prophets, but about Biblical prophesies yet to be fulfilled, I am. Only the blind ones, don't see them (prophesies) coming. Amaze  yourself, and behold the prophesies are happening as we speak.

ce1fc86086ebb978c111e9fc8d12d7b8aa	Os jesutas, Trento e a contra-reforma  A Reforma Protestante iniciada com Lutero em 1517 alastrou-se rapidamente por boa parte da Europa. O papa e o clero ficaram alarmados com isso, estudando e agilizando meios para conter esse avan?o. Nesse contexto surgiu a ordem dos jesutas que, ainda no sculo XVI, tornaria a igreja romana grandemente missionria, quer reconvertendo fiis, quer ampliando o seu bra?o evangelizador: Por volta de 1700 os jesutas alegavam ter 300.000 seguidores na China.1 Recordemos um pouco:    A ordem dos jesutas foi organizada e reconhecida em 27 de setembro de 1540 pelo papa Paulo III (1468-1549, papa desde 1534) atravs da bula Regimini Militantis Ecclesiae, batizando-a com o nome de Companhia de Jesus.2 No entanto, essa sociedade come?ara em 15 de agosto de 1533 com Incio de Loiola (1491-1556) e seis amigos: os espanhis Francisco Xavier, Diogo Lainez, Afonso Salmern e Nicolau Bobadilha; o italiano Pedro Fabro e o portugus Sim?o Rodrigues. Naquela ocasi?o, fizeram, alm dos votos de pobreza e castidade, um terceiro, pelo qual se comprometiam a ir a Jerusalm lutar contra os infiis. 3 Todos eles desejavam preservar a f catlica e buscar a convers?o de pag?os, atuando em diferentes lugares, com propsitos especficos, conforme a necessidade.     Os jesutas, desde a sua origem, personificaram o papado e os seus interesses. Eles surgiram como uma resposta catlica  necessidade de deter o avan?o da Reforma Protestante e tambm de reformar a igreja romana.    Os jesutas foram a for?a motriz do Conclio de Trento,4 sendo de fato os telogos do papa. Como os bispos geralmente n?o dispunham de grande conhecimento teolgico, mesmo titulados em direito can?nico, eles se valiam de telogos  em geral pertencentes s ordens religiosas  que os assessoravam, sendo alguns deles enviados diretamente pelo papa.  nessa condi??o, de modo especial, que destacam-se os jesutas, entre eles, Diogo Lainez, Cludio [Afonso?] Salmern  estes dois sugeridos por Loiola ,5 Claude Le Jay, Pedro Cansio e Oto von Truchsess, que passaram, alguns deles, a desempenhar no conclio um papel teolgico de primeira linha.6     Depois de vrios percal?os, Paulo III, pressionado por Carlos V (1500-1558), finalmente redigiu uma bula (19/11/1544) convocando o conclio para o dia 15/03/1545, em Trento, que por falta de quorum s teria o seu incio em 13/12/1545, encerrando os seus trabalhos em 1563.     O conclio deliberou a nvel de decretos de ordem dogmtica e disciplinar. Os primeiros consistiram na rejei??o dos postulados protestantes, pois o conclio estava grandemente preocupado com a expans?o do protestantismo.7 Os sete sacramentos foram confirmados  maneira medieval. A Escritura e a tradi??o eram igualmente fontes de verdade. A Vulgata foi elevada  condi??o de igualdade com os originais hebraicos e gregos. Os segundos (decretos de ordem disciplinar) proibiram a venda de indulgncias e criaram o Index Librorum Prohibitorum (ndice dos Livros Proibidos).     Boanerges Ribeiro comenta resumidamente as tarefas gigantescas de Trento:    O Conclio de Trento realizou tarefas colossais: teve de enfrentar a Reforma Protestante; e teve de impedir que, no processo de forma??o e consolida??o nacionalista, a Igreja Romana se fragmentasse, mesmo onde n?o se desse o cisma. Para o combate ao Protestantismo, alm de medidas corretivas na prpria Igreja Catlica, formulou o Conclio sua oposi??o doutrinria aos princpios bsicos da Reforma Protestante. Para enfrentar a amea?a de fragmenta??o, formulou teses de supremacia papal.8     Os jesutas, ent?o, saram por toda parte levando tais resolu??es, enfatizando sempre a supremacia papal, assunto at ent?o muito disputado (se o papa ou o conclio tinha a palavra final). Sobre o servi?o dos jesutas, avalia Philip Hughes: Sem a participa??o da Companhia de Jesus, a Contra-Reforma n?o teria passado talvez de uma solenidade de resolu??es religiosas.9     Trento deu nfase  Contra-Reforma e, para isso, valeu-se da Inquisi??o como um de seus meios mais eficazes para deter o avan?o protestante e reconquistar antigos territrios dominados pela f romana. A Espanha e a Itlia foram fundamentais nesse processo de recatoliza??o.10     Os jesutas tinham como regra nmero um a obedincia ao papa. Amparados em uma forte coes?o interna, prosseguiram em sua jornada, usando como instrumentos de prega??o as prociss?es, as confiss?es, as exorta??es  comunh?o freqente, as obras de arte11 e especialmente as escolas que abriam. Adaptaram-se assim s transforma??es dos tempos modernos, atingindo principalmente as classes ricas e os lugares estratgicos, oferecendo escolas de boa qualidade12 que eram procuradas pelas famlias dos nobres.     Os jesutas foram pe?as importantes na Guerra dos Trinta Anos (1618-1648), ocorrida na Europa entre protestantes e catlicos. A guerra fazia parte de uma engrenagem considerada fundamental para a reconquista espiritual da Europa para o seio da igreja romana.    Aps a guerra, selado o acordo com a Paz de Westflia (1648), o Protestantismo alcan?ou o seu espa?o poltico, geogrfico e religioso.  claro que isso custou um alto pre?o. Com a morte de milh?es de pessoas, a Alemanha, por exemplo, teve a sua popula??o reduzida a um ter?o.13 Outros efeitos foram sentidos com a Paz de Westflia: Este acordo acabou com a agress?o da Contra-Reforma e tambm com o progresso do protestantismo, resume Nichols de forma quase melanclica.14     De fato, o controle da Igreja pelo governo civil nos vrios principados n?o trouxe espiritualidade.15 A guerra por si s abatera em muito a vida moral e religiosa dos sobreviventes. Alm disso, a f em determinados crculos tornara-se apenas uma quest?o de assentimento|`|fcf25675bab34437dc633c3162aab9beaa	Nos remotos tempos dos anos 10 AC, Jesus abriu uma fbrica de a?cares geneticamente modificados. Para competir com o ado?ante Suita, ele criou o Jesuta. Foi um sucesso!|`|9e16ab711fce9547c9e78ca037fe1561aa	Funda??o  Em 15 de Agosto de 1534, Incio e seis outros estudantes (Pedro Faber, Francisco Xavier, Alfonso Salmeron, Jacob Laines, e Nicolau Bobedilla - Espanhis, e Sim?o Rodrigues - um portugus) encontraram-se na Igreja de Santa Maria, Montmartre e fundaram a Companhia de Jesus - para "desenvolver trabalho de acompanhamento hospitalar e missionrio em Jerusalm, ou para ir aonde o papa nos enviar, sem questionar".    Em 1537 eles viajaram at Itlia em busca de aprova??o papal da sua nova ordem. O Papa Paulo III concedeu-lhes uma recomenda??o e autorizou que fossem ordenados padres. Foram ordenados em Veneza pelo bispo de Arbe (24 de Junho). Devotaram-se inicialmente a pregar e em obras de caridade em Itlia. A guerra reatada entre o imperador, Veneza, o papa e os Turcos (Seljuk), tornava qualquer viagem at Jerusalm pouco aconselhvel.    Na companhia de Faber e Lainez, Incio viajou at Roma em Outubro de 1538, para pedir ao papa a aprova??o da nova ordem. A congrega??o de cardeais deu um parecer positivo  constitui??o apresentada, e em 27 de Setembro de 1540, Paulo III confirmou a ordem atravs da Bula "Regimini militantis Ecclesiae", que integra a "Frmula do Instituto" onde est contida a legisla??o substancial da nova Ordem. O nmero dos seus membros foi no entanto limitado a 60. Esta limita??o foi porm posteriormente abolida pela bula Injunctum nobis de 14 de Mar?o de 1543. Incio de Loyola foi escolhido para servir como primeiro superior-geral. Ele enviou os seus companheiros e missionrios para vrios pases europeus, com o fim de criar escolas, liceus e seminrios.    Incio de Loyola escreveu as constitui??es jesutas, adoptadas em 1554, que deram origem a uma organiza??o rigidamente disciplinada, enfatizando a absoluta auto-abnega??o e a obedincia ao Papa e os superiores hierrquicos (perinde ac cadaver, disciplinado como um cadver, nas palavras de Incio). O seu grande princpio tornou-se o lema dos jesutas: "Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam" (tudo por uma maior glria de Deus)    [editar]  Obra inicial     Missionrio jesuta ibrico do sculo XVIIOs jesutas foram fundados no seguimento da reforma Catlica (tambm chamada Contra-Reforma), um movimento reaccionrio  Reforma Protestante, cujas doutrinas se tornavam cada vez mais conhecidas atravs da Europa, em parte gra?as  recente inven??o da imprensa. Os Jesutas pregaram a obedincia total s escrituras e  doutrina da igreja, tendo Incio de Loyola declarado:    "Eu acredito que o branco que eu vejo  *****, se a hierarquia da igreja assim o tiver determinado"   Uma das principais ferramentas dos Jesutas era o retiro espiritual de Incio. Neste, vrias pessoas renem-se sob a orienta??o de um padre durante uma semana ou mais, permanecendo em silncio enquanto atendendo a palestras e submetendo-se a exerccios para se tornarem pessoas melhores. Por exemplo, houve uma conferncia e medita??es acerca das nossas mortes iminentes, entre outras.    Tambm pregaram que as decora??es e a ostenta??o em geral nas cerimnias do catolicismo (desprezadas pelos Luteranos) deviam ser acentuadas e abundantemente financiadas.    Os jesutas conseguiram obter grande influncia na sociedade nos perodos iniciais da idade moderna (sculos XVI e XVII) porque os padres jesutas foram por muitas vezes os educadores e confessores dos reis dessa altura. (Ver D. Sebasti?o de Portugal, por exemplo). Os jesutas foram uma for?a lder da Contra-Reforma, em parte devido  sua estrutura relativamente livre (sem os requerimentos da vida entre a comunidade nem do ofcio sagrado), o que lhes permitiu uma certa flexibilidade operacional. Em cidades alem?s, por exemplo, os jesutas tiveram um papel batalhador, contribuindo para a repress?o de quaisquer revoltas inspiradas pela doutrina de Martinho Lutero. Ver Munique ou Bona por exemplo, cidades que apesar de iniciais simpatias por Lutero, permaneceram um basti?o catlico, em grande parte pelo empenho de jesutas.    [editar]  Expans?o  As miss?es iniciais ao Jap?o otiveram como resultado a concess?o aos jesutas do enclave feudal em Nagasaki em 1580. No entanto, devido a receios crescentes da sua crescente influncia, este privilgio foi abolido em 1587.    Dois jesutas missionrios, Gruber e D'Orville, chegaram a Lhasa, no Tibete, em 1661.    Em 1549 chegou  Amrica do Sul o primeiro grupo jesuta, composto por seis missionrios liderados por Manoel da Nbrega, trazidos pelo governador-geral Mem de S.    As miss?es jesutas na Amrica Latina foram controversas na Europa, especialmente em Espanha e em Portugal, onde eram vistas como uma interferncia com a ac??o dos reinos governantes. Os jesutas opuseram-se vrias vezes  escravatura. Eles fundaram uma liga de cidades-estado, chamada Miss?es ou Missiones no sul do Brasil, ou ainda reducciones, no Paraguai, que eram povoa??es organizadas de acordo com o ideal catlico mais tarde destruda por espanhis e principalmente portugueses  cata de escravos .    Na China do sculo XVIII, os jesutas estiveram envolvidos na chamada quest?o dos ritos chineses.    [editar]  Perodos agitados  Na sequncia de uma srie de decretos assinados pelo papa Clemente XIV, incluindo o Breve "Dominus ac Redemptor" assinado em 21 de Julho de 1773, os jesutas foram suprimidos em todos os pases (excepto a Rssia, onde a lideran?a da igreja ortodoxa recusou reconhecer a autoridade papal). Nessa altura havia 5 assistncias, 39 provncias, 669 colgios, 237 casas de forma??o, 335 residncias missionrias, 273 miss?es e 22589 membros.    Em Portugal, os Jesutas j tinham sidos expulsos do pas pelo Marqus de Pombal, na sequncia do caso Tvora em 1759.

Religi?o  um ato de covardia!!!|`|deaffa641be9a5a35c856010881c9317aa	RELIGI?O    EM BUSCA DA TRANSCENDNCIA    O QUE  RELIGI?O? QUAL A DIFEREN?A DE SEITA?    MITOLOGIA  RELIGI?O? O QUE  HERESIA?      RELIGI?O deriva do termo latino "Re-Ligare", que significa "religa??o" com o divino. Essa defini??o engloba necessariamente qualquer forma de aspecto mstico e religioso, abrangendo seitas, mitologias e quaisquer outras doutrinas ou formas de pensamento que tenham como caracterstica fundamental um contedo Metafsico, ou seja, de alm do mundo fsico.    Sendo assim o hbito, geralmente por parte de grupos religiosos de taxarem tal ou qual grupo religioso rival de seita, n?o tm apoio na defini??o do termo. SEITA, derivado da palavra latina "Secta", nada mais  do que um segmento minoritrio que se diferencia das cren?as majoritrias, mas como tal tambm  religi?o.    HERESIA  outro termo mal compreendido. Significa simplesmente um contedo que vai contra a estrutura terica de uma religi?o dominante. Sendo assim o Cristianismo foi uma Heresia Judica assim como o Protestantismo uma Heresia Catlica, ou o Budismo uma Heresia Hindusta.    A MITOLOGIA  uma cole??o de contos e lendas com uma concep??o mstica em comum, sendo parte integrante da maioria das religi?es, mas suas formas variam grandemente dependendo da estrutura fundamental da cren?a religiosa. N?o h religi?o sem mitos, mas podem existir mitos que n?o participem de uma religi?o.    MSTICA pode ser entendida como qualquer coisa que diga respeito a um plano sobre material. Um "Mistrio".    PRESEN?A DA RELIGI?O EM TODA A CULTURA HUMANA    N?o h registro em qualquer estudo por parte da Histria, Antropologia, Sociologia ou qualquer outra "cincia" social, de um grupamento humano em qualquer poca que n?o tenha professado algum tipo de cren?a religiosa. As religi?es s?o ent?o um fen?meno inerente a cultura humana, assim como as artes e tcnicas.    Grande parte de todos os movimentos humanos significativos tiveram a religi?o como impulsor, diversas guerras, geralmente as mais terrveis, tiveram legitima??o religiosa, estruturas sociais foram definidas com base em religi?es e grande parte do conhecimento cientfico, "filosfico" e artstico tiveram como vetores os grupos religiosos, que durante a maior parte da histria da humanidade estiveram vinculados ao poder poltico e social.    Hoje em dia, apesar de todo o avan?o cientfico, o fen?meno religioso sobrevive e cresce, desafiando previs?es que anteveram seu fim. A grande maioria da humanidade professa alguma cren?a religiosa direta ou indiretamente e a Religi?o continua a promover diversos movimentos humanos, e mantendo estatutos polticos e sociais.    Tal como a Cincia, a Arte e a Filosofia, a Religi?o  parte integrante e inseparvel da cultura humana,  muito provavelmente sempre continuar sendo.      TIPOS DE RELIGI?ES    H vrias formas de religi?o, e s?o muitos os modos que vrios estudiosos utilizam para classific-las. Porm h caractersticas comuns s religi?es que aparecem com maior ou menor destaque em praticamente todas as divis?es.    A primeira destas caractersticas e cronolgica, pois as formas religiosas predominantes evoluem atravs dos tempos nos sucessivos estgios culturais de qualquer sociedade.    Outro modo  classific-las de acordo com sua solidez de princpios e sua profundidade filosfica, o que ir separ-las em religi?es com e sem Livros Sagrados.    Pessoalmente como um estudioso do assunto, prefiro uma classifica??o que leva em conta essas duas caractersticas, e divide as religi?es nos seguintes 4 grandes grupos distintos.     PANTESTAS  POLITESTAS   MONOTESTAS  ATESTAS     Nessa divis?o h uma ordem cronolgica. As Religi?es PANTESTAS s?o as mais antigas, dominando em sociedades menores e mais "primitivas". Tanto nos primrdios da civiliza??o mesopotamica, europia e asitica, quanto nas culturas das Amricas, frica e Oceania.    As Religi?es POLITESTAS por vezes se confundem com as Pantestas, mas surgem num estgio posterior do desenvolvimento de uma cultura. Quanto mais a sociedade se torna complexa, mais o Pantesmo vai se tornando Politesmo.    J as MONOTESTAS s?o mais recentes, e atualmente as mais disseminadas, o Monotesmo quantitativamente ainda domina mais de metade da humanidade.    E embora possa parecer estranho, existem religi?es ATESTAS, que negam a existncia de um ser supremo central, embora possam admitir a existncia de entidades espirituais diversas. Essas religi?es geralmente surgem como um rea??o a um sistema religioso Monotesta ou pelo menos Politesta, e em muitos aspectos se confunde com o Pantesmo embora possua caractersticas exclusivas.    Essa divis?o tambm tra?a uma hierarquia de rebuscamento filosfico nas religi?es. As Pantestas por serem as mais antigas, n?o tm Livros Sagrados ou qualquer estabelecimento mais slido do que a tradi??o oral, embora na atualidade o renascimento pantesta esteja mudando isso. J as politestas muitas vezes possuem registros de suas lendas e mitos em vers?o escrita, mas Nenhuma possui uma REVELA??O propriamente dita. Isto  um privilgio do Monotesmo. TODAS as grandes religi?es monotestas possuem sua Revela??o Divina em forma de Livro Sagrado. As Atestas tambm possuem seus livros guias, mas por n?o acreditarem num Deus pessoal, n?o tem o peso dogmtico de uma revela??o divina, sendo vistas em geral como tratados filosficos.    PANTESMO    As religi?es primitivas s?o PANTESTAS, acredita-se num grande "Deus-Natureza". Todos os elementos naturais s?o divinizados, se atribu "inteligncias" espirituais ao vento, a gua, fogo, popula??es animais e etc.    H uma clara no??o de eq|`|9e16ab711fce9547c9e78ca037fe1561aa	por que existe varias formas de se ver o mundo|`|6bd804b54fb17d27f37b6cc575924a70aa	A Igreja  comparada a um corpo.

e47ce5ada07af4d92699cce0166bd888aa	Una orga, hijo mo, separa el placer de sus consecuencias.  All no hay referencias a la vida pasada o a la posicin social fuera de ese mbito. Pero hay que decir que ciertos datos previos iluminan el placer de un modo delicadamente perverso: observar el desenfreno de alguien cuya castidad es pblica multiplica la voluptuosidad.  De todos modos, es deseable la aniquilacin de las identidades. La luz debe ser tenue, las palabras que se intercambian, impersonales. Los celos, el orgullo y la imposicin de derechos adquiridos previamente estn, desde luego, fuera de toda orga. Los turnos, las simetras, la disposicin coreogrfica deben limitarse. Es preferible, querido mo, una sensacin de caos, aunque es sabio procurar que la lujuria de los concurrentes vaya creciendo de un modo homogneo. Es decir, se reducirn al mnimo los estallidos precoces o tardos.  En algunas civilizaciones de la antigedad clsica existan ocaciones en las que todo el pueblo participaba de una orga. Sin embargo, en general, se exiga la pertenencia a un determinado grupo que persegua idnticos fines y corra idnticos riesgos.  Los partos, segn el testimonio de algunos viajeros, organizaban reuniones de desenfreno que sucedan en la ms completa oscuridad para no comprometer identidades, linajes o jerarquas.  Algunos pensadores consideran esto un grueso error. La orga no es imaginacin ni elipsis sino justamente la realizacin contante y sonante de disipaciones que alguna vez so?amos.  Debo decirte que, a lo largo de la historia, se ha discutido mucho acerca del momento en que debe finalizar una orga. Desde un punto de vista clsico, el sue?o y la relajacin general, la desordenada quietud en los salones y los sucesivos despertares con retiradas furtivas son se?ales claras. Algunas veces, conforme a ciertas regulaciones rituales, la orga finaliza en un instante ms filoso, marcado por un suceso puntual como un sacrificio, el amanecer o un incendio.  Alejandro de Macedonia consideraba como conducta criminal la continuacin de las pretensiones lascivas despus del fin de la orga. El emperador Calgula sola ensa?arse con los cortesanos que llegaban tarde al desenfreno, pues senta que contaminaban de cotidianidad un estado de conciencia que a veces resultaba trabajoso alcanzar.  Los a?os me han ense?ado a despreciar el discurso amoroso de los burgueses: "Yo siempre cre que A, hasta que B. Me prometiste que X y sin embargo, Z. Pdeme si quieres A, A', A'' o A''', pero no me pidas que C'''. En la orga no hace falta la explicacin del deseo para legitimarlo. Y se es el primero de los goces.  Los licores y los afrodisacos, ni?o de mi corazn, son indispensables no slo para asegurar el desenfreno sino para atribuir a las sustancias la responsabilidad de nuestras bajezas. Se entiende que estas preparaciones nos dominan, nos poseen y nos expulsan de nuestro ser.  Como ya te habr dicho tu madre, es perfectamente intil aspirar a lo orgistico con la mera concrecin de una cita colectiva de expectativas sexuales. Una verdadera orga presupone un estado de conciencia diferente y superior que debe ser alcanzado por procedimientos que implican, casi siempre, una tica y una esttica. Los mercaderes enriquecidos que fuman opio y se rodean de prostitutas en el barrio del Soho son solamente imbciles y debe serles prohibido el ingreso a cualquier saturnalia.  Y ahora ve, hijo mo, y s feliz.

"?Es qu no hay televisores en su pas?", pregunt alguien.  "Claro que los hay, pero los programas de aqu me gustan mucho ms".     3-Haba un tipo que era tan borracho, pero tan borracho ....que le decan "genio".   Porque cada vez que destapaban una botella siempre apareca.    4-- En la clase de Castellano la maestra le pregunta a Jaimito:  - Jaimito, en la oracin: "Mara est disfrutando"...Dnde est el sujeto?  - Muy fcil maestra, ?Pues encima de ella!     5-El profesor repartiendo las notas:  - Luisito un diez.  Pedrito un ocho.  Juanito un seis.  Jaimito un cero.  - Oiga profe. Y por que a m un cero?  - Por que te has copiado el examen de Pedrito.  - ?Y Vd. como lo sabe?  - Por que las cuatro primeras preguntas, estn iguales, en la ltima pregunta Pedrito respondi "Esa, no me la s" y tu has puesto "Yo tampoco".    6-Por que las rubias no hablan mientras hacen el amor ?  Porque sus madres les dijeron que no hablasen con desconocidos.     7-En un pais donde la corrupcion abundaba, un hombre iba manejando y casualmente se pasa una luz roja. Un policia lo alcanza y lo detiene:    POLICIA: Su nombre por favor...?  CONDUCTOR: ?Ja-ja, y me rio!    P: ?Pero,... co... como se atreve! --contesta indignado- Digame su nombre!

Con un peridico extendido  y un cigarrillo encendido  queda el culo complacido y la m|erda en su lugar.  C@gar es un placer;  de c@gar nadie se escapa,  caga el rey, caga el papa, caga el buey, caga la vaca,  y hasta la se?orita ms guapa hace sus bolitas de caca.  Viene el perro y lo huele,  viene el gato y lo tapa.  Total, en este mundo de caca  de c@gar nadie se escapa.  Que triste es amar sin ser amado,  pero ms triste es c@gar sin haber almorzado.  Hay cacas blancas por hepatitis,  las hay blandas por gastritis.  Cualquiera que sea la causa que siempre te alcanza,  aprieta las piernas duro que cuando el trozo es seguro,  aunque est bien fruncido el culo  sera por lo menos, ??pedo seguro!!  No hay placer ms exquisito,  que c@gar bien despacito.  El ba?o no es tobogn ni tampoco subibaja.  El ba?o es para c@gar  y no pa' hacerse una paja.  Los escritores de ba?o  son poetas de ocasin  que buscan entre la m|erda  su fuente de inspiracin.  Vos que os creis sagaz y de todo os res,  decidme si sois capaz de c@gar y no hacer pis.  En este lugar sagrado, adonde tanta gente acude,  la chica se pasa el dedo y el tipo se lo sacude.  C@ga tranquilo, c@ga sin pena,  pero no se te olvide tirar de la cadena.  El tipo que aqu se sienta y de escribir versos se acuerda,  ?no me vengan a decir que no es un poeta de m|erda!  En este lugar sagrado donde acude tanta gente,  hace fuerza el ms cobarde y se caga el ms valiente.|`|7092b9d30c6dcedd4911bf701c9d14c9aa	Pepito: mama porque papa corre en zig zag  Mama : callate y pasame mas balas            http://mx.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|931e54d261b75e7543f0f10a5bce12d8aa	hola, eres una buena persona en regalar ese puntaje..

Cuales son las facultades mentales en el ser humano ?    Hasta ahorita nadie me la ha contestado.  ? Acaso no las saben ?  Yo te las voy a decir, para que tu contestes esa pregunta y te ganes 10 puntos. ? Sale !  Pero tu tambin me das 10 puntitos a m. ? Okey !    Las facultades mentales son tres  Inteligencia  Sentimientos y  Voluntad.    Cuando un ser humano como t y como yo tenemos esos sentimientos nivelados, estamos de una persona normal que vive una vida normal.  Un ejemplo de alguien que no es normal, un secuestrador y asesino no es una persona normal, porque sus sentimientos los tiene por los suelos, aunque puede ser muy inteligente y de una gran voluntad.

By then you might be tied financially or worse with a child and you can't see yourself doing it by yourself.

Se dice que deriva de la palabra guaran che, la cual en espa?ol es el pronombre personal 'yo' o el posesivo 'mi' (de esta manera la frase "che coronel" significa 'mi coronel'). En los idiomas tehuelche y pampa "che" significa 'hombre', por prstamo del mapudungun, en que significa 'gente'.|`|76552550d9b36c6bfe58565d2ee9d524aa	Vaya uno a saber..........|`|b80ac5f7b3f0a25ab4b39b884348b35aaa	Significa HOMBRE en luengua Mapuche (indgenas de sudamrica) Mapu= tierra, Che= Hombre  Salu2|`|1fb640f7d6e39a5a543371ddb06a3891aa	Hola, respondo a tu pregunta, mi nombre es Andrea, y puedo decirte que la palabra "che" tiene origen en la lengua indgena mapuche y significa gente,  es as como los argentinos la tomamos y la usamos pa' llamar a alguien.

La palabra "huiliche" la utilizaban para referirse a la "gente del sur". El mismo vocablo "tehuelche", termina en "che", al igual que "puelche"y "mapuche".En el litoral,  los que an hoy hablan el idioma guaran, se refieren a una persona que aprecian como che-amigo.Es decir, el vocablo "che" nos debe haber quedado como herencia en nuestro lenguaje habitual, especialmente adoptado por los "porte?os"y que nos identifica en el mundo. Por eso los amigos de Ernesto Guevara lo "bautizaron "che"|`|6c3b2543702480eabbc1d21281ec6fe1aa	pues es un estilo que viene de argentina|`|c57be6a9d9302ad8396a69a45df7e0ceaa	Dios mo que manera de leer barbaridades con tono de seriedad.

Algo ms de seriedad tiene la teora de que proviene del che guaran, lengua mucho ms en contacto con la zona de Buenos Aires y en la cual se usa como forma de respeto y significa "mi"  , che maestro es mi maestro, chamigo es contraccin de che amigo.  Hay que tener en cuenta que el che masific su uso en el lunfardo de Bs As, que no tena ninguna relacin con el mapuche o araucano.|`|f22aa002bcf6ad61a390ced3db6ea996aa	Significa GENTE en lengua Mapuche............|`|f8c7dcd195c7748e1062333d8a2ca464aa	Tambien la usan los colombianos!|`|168e6155ab83426860264e2ce51f490daa	La palabra "Che" usada en Argentina es una forma de expresarse para indicar respeto , proviene del idioma indgena autctono , Araucano , Mapuche , y tambin dicen que proviene del Guaran   Ciertamente es una expresin de respeto , al dirigirse a alguien con un che le estamos anteponiendo que es una persona respetable ,digna de admiracin . con el tiempo fue tomando una forma de referirnos a la otra persona que no tiene que ver , tal vez con su origen.   La usaban ya los sacerdotes Jesuitas que vinieron a estos lugares despus de convivir con indgenas de la regin hace ya muchos siglos , incluso se suele usar en partes de Espa?a como Valencia (X), algunos dicen que por influencia de los inmigrante que vivieron aqu y volvieron y alguien tambin que viene de la forma antigua CE .    Lo cierto que en un primer momento se uso como smbolo de posesin " Che general" como les decan sus soldados a San Martn , es como decir "mi General" , actualmente se usa antepuesto de  un nombre para llamar la atencin   Tambin hay gente que la relaciona a los zefaradies , otros a una palabra francesa , otros dicen que viene del italiano incluso que es una derivacin de palabras quechuas , Escuch que en el idioma de los indios Pampas , significa gente.    Creo que verdaderamente es una palabra Guaran , es usada ms que nada en su zona de influencia , Litoral Argentino , Paraguay , Bolivia , Uruguay , sur de Brasil.

362b704565dd41499f57bdbff2176c8caa	jason d,  "The evils of Zionism." Hmmm. Not biased,are you?    It's the scriptures. If you are going to call the scriptures evil, then I guess you gave the answer already!    God gave the Land of Israel to the children of Israel. Didn't you read the scriptures? Christians that have a bit of common sense know that God will return to Israel, and He never gave it to the sons of Ishmael. So any that say that it is for them, they are truly wrong! God even promises to come back and kill all the enemies of Israel in that place in and around where Israel sits. And He also calls it Israel in the Bible, the Old Testament. So there is no mistaking that it's there. What Muslims have to get in their stupid heads is that they are being the tool of Satan, the devil. The Evil one. You can throw rocks at a rock that you call Satan all day long, if you are Muslim, and Satan isn't a rock, he's telling you to make sure that you throw the right amount. Your rituals are pleasing to him. They are acts of faith to him. Mosques are established according to his pleasure. And the teachers of that false religion do his bidding. He makes sure that they deny the divinity of Jesus Christ.    So the evils of Zionism is not the term Zionism. It may be the quotes from some of the Israeli leaders, especially of the past, and some of the ruin that they brought to the schemes of the Arab leaders, but it is not the belief that Israel has a right to exist. No. Israel is ordained of God. And it's to Him that I put my trust.     You believe what you will.|`|587e1cb8d798bdb9902f704f41a32cc2aa	By supposedly crucifying Jesus although he wasnt crucified|`|2006b8954c1947b9429c00b39378e779aa	There are no evils in Zionism..... you must eb an Islamic jackass who doesn' know the Biblical Prophetic promise that Israel will agin re-inhabit it ancient home land after God 'brings them back out of many nations'....that prophecy by God has been fulfilled and the Arabs, like yourself,  are now mad at God...

If this is really for you, it will come right to you.|`|76303b3f386595e098f739890b78691eaa	First thing's first. You are setting yourself up to have two things happen. either you will break her heart by stealing him, or you will be the other woman. There is no middle ground. I don't care how good you think he is, if he sees a chance to have his cake and eat it too, he will do it. I know. I did it, and so has every other guy that I know. And you and the other girl will let him get away with it for a little while, too, even though you both know about the other, but you don't KNOW about the other. I know this, because my ex wife saw me crossing the street with the girl I was seeing on the side. She saw me, and I saw her. But when she asked me about it, I denied, and denied, and denied. She eventually believed me, even though she knew it was me that she saw. It comes from her WANTING to believe me so much, that she convinced herself.  Now that that's out of the way, and you will never look at men with a trusting eye again, let's talk about you.  You had your chance. You blew it. Be thankful that you and he are still friends. Stop trying to get back with him, or at least have the decency to wait until he leaves the other girl. Even after he leaves her, wait a month or so, so that you know he's not trying to have his cake and eat it too. I'm telling you, if you let him, he will do it.   Lastly, live with the knowledge that you are attractive, and you are capable, adn you are a strong woman in your own right, and you don't need a man or a relationship to validate your existence.|`|6780afe5acad909c7211223f882881c9aa	u dont get him back. u say this guy's really happy wit the girl he's wit now, so why do u wanna ruin it for him again? u already broke his heart, thinkin for urself (that the other guy was better). how u think he felt about that? that he was ur second choice? n he liked u for 2 years after! how long u want him to be chasin after u? u screwed up, n u gotta learn from ur mistakes. leave him n his girlfriend alone.     n now u know that wat goes around comes around....|`|64c1aa26c15eacaa59a291d76ec05d86aa	Life is too short.

Use your own words but don't be shy and don't be aggressive.  Just let him know you'd like to try being romantic.   Everyone's single until they get married (even if they're dating someone.) i.e., it's not over till the preacher pronounces they're man and wife.|`|b7cf4eb747d30cc1e5b25e46381f36c5aa	no offence but your a home wrecking hussy and u need shot|`|AA10313049	sing "Don't you wish your girlfriend was hot like me" by the Pussycat Dolls|`|d4840e335850c0a817b821a2c1bbac5aaa	If you like him, you should let him go.

On a local level, there are many in my neighborhood, and they are all good neighbors who clean up after their dogs, keep their yards decent, and assist the elders among us.

I do not happen to approve of the life style but would be a friend to a gay/ lesbian and in fact have a brother that is gay, he knows I love him and disapprove of his lifestyle. I guess it is best illustrated like this...A Father/ or Mother that loves their child and sees them doing wrong does not hate the child but does not approve of the disobedience. However because of our carnal nature and our ability to hate; it unfortunately happens. I hate violence, and it is atrocious that people bash any-one for any reason, hatred comes from Satan. God clearly tells us to love one another. In fact the bible says I can have faith that "moves mountains, but if I have not LOVE I am nothing"|`|f8bff1408a38d6aa846b0171dfe3ac4aaa	i dig the carpet munchers  ;)    hope to lay one one day    pole smokers aint my thing...but if it makes them happy...more power to them|`|d3386c33bfbc70a9f267c54d343c22d3aa	i dont find this right...  this thingy is NOT allowed in any of the Religions!!!  its not allowed in islam, christianity n judaism...  its AN ABSOLUTE SIN!!!!!  the ppl of LUT got Gods wrath on them bcuz their men were Gays..|`|b28a3ff0d3dbb9fa552138047bd84c3aaa	No different than anyone else.

At least they need to "keep it in the bedroom" like they did in previous times.    The worst thing is the radical extremists who want to be in our faces and force all of society to glorify and worship them. Their agenda must be stopped, and fortunately most of the states have now driven them back into their closests by striking down so-called "gay marriage."|`|8717237710837f19fbe5cfd86faf0a1daa	Terrific people!|`|48f277511a38f9063e3e15fb67d23482aa	I do NOT hate gays or lesbians.  However, I do not approve or accept their lifestyle as normal human behavior and forcing me to become one of them.  Last time I checked, most of the people in this planet were still very very straight.    Yes, they are human beings but they deny their genetics and how it's supposed to be used in the appropriate manner.    I won't even discuss biblical or quranic laws forbidding their practice because they'll only reject it and come up with quotes to justify their lifestyle.    The fact that the gays and lesbians are divided on whether or not their lifestyle is a choice or predestination is already proof for me that they are definitely living the wrong way.    How can gays or lesbians tell us that they were destined to be that way when they are contradicted by their own kind which tell us it was a choice for them to be that way?    Is there any chance of getting a straight (no pun intended) answer from these people?|`|28339486a0a52f57ab1c4040147164d6aa	Lesbians - Can I watch  Gay men - Oh good, more women for me.

I love them with all my heart... but they know that I believe that homosexuality is a sin and that I love only them and not their sexual preference.  The why is because the Bible says that homosexuality is an abomination to God.  This means that it is a sin, and I do not like any sins... however, that will not keep me from loving the person that is committing the sin... if that were true, I wouldn't love anyone, including myself, because everyone sins and all sins are equal...

Como j disseram acima alguns detalhes sobre a inven??o do papel higinico, eu n?o vou repet-las. Mas vou te dizer que algo que me deixou PASMA foi descobrir que antigamente as pessoas se limpavam COM A M?O ESQUERDA! Da todos oferecerem a m?o direita para cumprimentar outras pessoas, porque a m?o esquerda antigamente era usada para esses fins horrorosos.    Outra coisa interessante foi que quando o papel higinico foi inventado e depois que passou a ser comercializado, a maioria das pessoas usava o mesmo n?o para a higiene pessoal mas para ESCREVER RECADOS uns para os outros. Eles achavam bonito e delicado o papel higinico, fininho e macio. Voc acredita nisso? O pior  que esses dois fatos s?o verdicos e comprovados historicamente.    Nunca mais vou encarar a m?o esquerda das pessoas de antigamente da mesma forma. Ainda bem que n?o vivo naquela poca. Imagine s que coisa HORRVEL ter que se limpar com as prprias m?os! Acho que at folhas ou sabugos de milho seriam melhores do que fazer isso! ahahahahaha|`|9e16ab711fce9547c9e78ca037fe1561aa	Diz-se que o papel higinico foi inventado na China em 875, mas a inven??o tambm  atribuda a Joseph Gayetty, de Nova Iorque, EUA, que a teria concebido em 1857.

5b6e62fbefdc1d5cc61a98468c918dd5aa	Yes . It is because we lack leaders to inspire us . the policeman takes bribe openly, because his boss takes takes from him even while he is appointed and his boss tkes it because the Miniter forces him to do things that would enable him to gert lot of money form other people for so many things. Democarcy has enabled people withoiur charcter to come to power on the basis of castes , community , religon etc and on money and men power. ther is a proverb ," As is the king , so are the subjects ."this is not anything new . In Bhagavad Gita itself Krishna has said as follows:     "Whatever a leader does ,  the ordinary people also do   he sets thge standard   for the world to follow"          (Third Chapter  verse 21)           What can yo expect of the ordinary people when the top is rotten. it was the leadres who sold the county  tothe white invaders and before that to the arab nomadic  merchants .  The so-called well educated people were really only well literate and not well -educated . learning does not require any knoledge of alphbets .Learning was different . the founding fatheer of the independent inid a wer educated in foreign countries and their type of democarcy was unsuitalbe   to the illiterate masses of inid aand those foreign educated stllwarts though had good intentions wer not really intelligent or geniuses . That is the reason for the present day problems . the government is a bundle of contradictions and the constitution  is observes more in breach than in observance and the directive principles have been given the go by for political convenience on caste , creeed and religious basis .  Do not be surprised if the political parties sell the counrtry to the higgest bidder .|`|ef46629278f51e707d9c9e8310b42575aa	It appears to me that Indians have a different kind of pride, they believe, often without any good reason, that there culture is the oldest and greatest, their thinkers the most subtle, their religion the oldest and really as encompassing all other religions and sometimes they even have pride in how free of pride they are|`|8e3a5dd26679a6864d1d9728db95c16daa	Where did you get that info?

Actually, we are told to priortize. Put Jesus first, find God's will for our own life and then live it.   We are still expected to have a job, a car, a house, a TV, food, clothes, etc,.  What we cannot do, must not do, is make these THINGS the most important in our life. Anything or anyone that we make more important than Jesus (God) is , for us, an idol and idolatry is forbidden.   Yes my wife knows that she is number 2 in my life because God is number 1.  All that to say this - sounds easy - much harder to live out in the day to day. Every Christian is on a path towards the person that God wants them to be. All are on a different place on that path. So it is undesireable and ineffective to look sideways at someone else and ask why or why not. We are responsible for our own walk with God, and it is dangerous to compare it to someone else's.

It is not a Book of Law and Order but it  is a Book of Guidance.     ok let us assume as per what the ignorant site says -- that Muhammed-pbuh wrote it -- but this person is so stupid that he doesnt even know the history. Muhammed --pbuh was an illiterate man. when Muhammed-pbuh came down with this blazing poetry , the Pagans of Makkah were shocked -- for there existed no such words as beautiful as that.     ok again if we assume as per this ignorant person (who took so much time to write this crap on website ) -- that the english authors add "Say". but even then -- it seems like a command from God saying -- that  there is none that is worthy of seeking help and praise other than me. it is a prayer what every beleiver would ask His God -- to protect him from all evil and calamities..    Al-Falaq | 5 verses | The day break    ???? ?????    Sura  113 | Makkah    1 Say: I seek refuge in the Lord of the Daybreak      2 From the evil of that which He created;      3 From the evil of the darkness when it is intense,      4 And from the evil of malignant witchcraft,      5 And from the evil of the envier when he envieth.     the next one is -- Koran 6:104 -- out of context, which people love to do very so often.   Al-Anaam | 165 verses | The cattle    ???? ???????    Sura  6 | Makkah   102 Such is Allah, your Lord. There is no Allah save Him, the Creator of all things, so worship Him. And He taketh care of all things.      103 Vision comprehendeth Him not, but He comprehendeth (all) vision. He is the Subtile, the Aware.      104 Proofs have come unto you (OMuhammed) from your Lord, so whoso seeth, it is for his own good, and whoso is blind is blind to his own hurt. And I am not a keeper over you.      105 Thus do We display Our revelations that they may say (unto thee, Muhammad): "Thou hast studied," and that We may make (it) clear for people who have knowledge.      the WHOLE OF THE QURAN is a DIRECT ADRESS to Muhammed-pbuh and how come the author Dawood did not see the very next verse and claimed Muhammed -pbuh wrote it?. and many people arent satisfied with Dawood's translation -- for it is over exaggerating --  they always prefer Pikthall or Yusuf Ali. why even many historians and westerners arent satisfied with Dawood's translation. now thats upto them.  --------------------------------------...  even if as per the person if we remove -- "SAY" -- then this becomes a prayer every beleiver will say to those who disbeleive.  An-Naml | 93 verses | THE ANT    ???? ?????    Sura  27 | Makkah    91 For me, I have been commanded to serve the Lord of this city, Him Who has sanctified it and to Whom (belong) all things: and I am commanded to be of those who bow in Islam to Allah.s Will,-     but wait!!!!!! what does the next verse say?   92 And to rehearse the Qur'an: and if any accept guidance, they do it for the good of their own souls, and if any stray, SAY: "I am only a warner".      93 And say: "Praise be to Allah, Who will soon show you His Signs, so that ye shall know them"; and thy Lord is not unmindful of all that ye do.     the person creating the website says that "say" was added by authors but in the VERSE 92 , IT CLESRLY INDICATES THAT IT IS A PART OF THE SENTENCE.  and this is the same translation that has been used by the person who created the website. or is it that the person who created the website doesnt know what ALLAH means?  --------------------------------------... next one is TOTALLY WRONG.   At-Takwir | 29 verses | The Overthrowing    ???? ???????    Sura  81 | Makkah     the ENTIRE SURAH deals with the Day of Judgement with the FIRST PERSON ADDRESSED and that can be seen in the last verse of the same surah.  28 Unto whomsoever of you willeth to walk straight.     29 And ye will not, unless (it be) that Allah willeth, the Lord of Creation.     it is God that will call everything that is in Heaven and Earth as a witness and not Muhammed-pbuh.     the same mishap had been done even with the next quote. taken totally out of context and and twisted the meaning of it.....  Al-Inshiqaq | 25 verses | The Sundering, Splitting Open    ???? ????????    Sura  84 | Makkah     read the whole surah and u will see in VERSE  5 And hearkens to (the Command of) its Lord,- and it must needs (do so);- (then will come Home the full reality).     6 O thou man! Verily thou art ever toiling on towards thy Lord- painfully toiling,- but thou shalt meet Him.      also read,  14 Truly, did he think that he would not have to return (to Us)!     15 Nay, nay! for his Lord was (ever) watchful of him!      TO US -- to whom? to Muhammed-pbuh ? NO. it is GOD IN FIRST PERSON.  --------------------------------------...  the next one -- again out of context. Qu'ran 6:114 -- is what is been given but i would like u to read the whole lot.     111 Even if We did send unto them angels, and the dead did speak unto them, and We gathered together all things before their very eyes, they are not the ones to believe, unless it is in Allah.s plan. But most of them ignore (the truth).      112 Likewise did We make for every Messenger an enemy,- evil ones among men and jinns, inspiring each other with flowery discourses by way of deception. If thy Lord had so planned, they would not have done it: so leave them and their inventions alone.      113 To such (deceit) let the hearts of those incline, who have no faith in the hereafter: let them delight in it, and let them earn from it what they may.      114 Say: "Shall I seek for judge other than Allah. - when He it is Who hath sent unto you the Book, explained in detail."

If you do, the question is immediately answered... if you don't, then I need to explain what's going on here...    What confuses people is when the Quran is translated into other languages... see, what they translate is one possible INTERPRETATION of the Quran... they can NEVER translate the original Arabic Quran with all it's associations, meanings etc.... So, what you end up in is one of two situations: people either believe in the Quran and they give it every benefit of the doubt; if they find one of these contradictions you're referring to, they would go through the trouble of checking with others, Arabic speakers perhaps to find out the truth.... Other people however, just wish to point out anything that would show the Quran as a faulty book, or as one that encourages violence, etc.    My advice, if you're really honest about your question and finding out the truth, ask Muslim scholars who would know what they're talking about... chances are, most of the answers you get here are unfortunately filled with hatred, blind ignorant hatred...

5b4debdc05e5ee3ab6d3afb1e669dc76aa	It's completely legal.  It's also completely legal to have an ethinicity club.  Note that a 'teens for christ' club does NOT violate separation of church and state; it's only when a teacher or other representative endorses a particular religion or practice while in the role.  That means that in school a teacher can pray all they want, students can pray all they want, etc. but a teacher can not ask the class to engage in a silent time or ask others to join -- it's VERY important for people to see the differences here.  It guarantees our right to practice religion freely.|`|55b45f883881bae11760aee5165116e2aa	I'm not sure about California, but in WI both ethnic clubs and 'teens for Christ' clubs would be fully legal.|`|7b6452d65b9ee11bc18dcbd22708983aaa	Yes it is legal. Because anyone can become a Christian. Just like anyone can learn to play chess. Ethnic clubs on the other hand will not allow someone who is not of that ethnicity.

There's all kinds of young black professionals groups, and latino heritage groups...   Do you know the specific group that was denied and why?  Sometimes groups need to have 2 faculty sponsors from the school in order to have meetings - is it possible the ethnicity groups didn't have sponsors?    And what's wrong with a teens for christ club?  Why not?|`|12fec527239b3a8848cb6e90e29ad468aa	No, it is unconstitutional and completely unfair. The First Amendment prohibits schools (as public institutions) from funding religious activities or allowing such organizations to use school grounds. If you really want to do something about it (I would), I suggest contacting an organization such as Americans United for the Seperation of Church and State (www.au.org) or the Freedom From Religion Foundation (ffrf.org).

They originally placed abolition in the US constitution, but feared that the unity of the thriteen colonies would suffer if abolition was a prerequisite for declaring independance from Britain. Thus, they left abolition of slavery out of the constitution and the bill of rights.

It's legal everyone was doing it and weather it be right or wrong, at the time, didn't seem to be the issue!  If you believe that comparing alcohol with slavery is 'Not the same thing' think again. This thing kills all ages all walks of life all genders all beliefs and life forms and thousands of them each year.   You complain and moan about something that can not be changed and yet something that can be changed right now and right hear goes un-changed!  I am not attempting to down play slavery my grandmother, god rest her soul, and her mother etc., were in slaved along with a lot of relatives of yours and others. But, stop worrying about the past and start worrying about the present and the future. I loved my grandmother just as much as you loved your relatives but I love my children and my grandchildren.

It may have been their best work.|`|cf987cf88cee5bfed913f7cd18448979aa	I see your point, the foundation of hypocrisy this very nation was founded on.  Why did they?  They seemed like they had to to get work done, altho I am NOT claiming that as an excuse.  But the arrogance & superiority that white men had back in the days, seemed like they (slaves) were necessities or commonplace (again no excuse).  It took a few hundred years, but it makes me happy to see that blacks, white, asian, mexicans, if you are legally up to date, you have the same promise & chance to pursue happiness as the rest.  I am an immigrant too.

But those elite who have plenty don't offer help either. Accordingly, we all have freedom of choice and opportunity. But I hear you... sometimes the opportunity doesn't fall in the place where it's needed, when needed or as needed......who can change it?

A Benjamite descended from Jeiel (presumably also called Abiel) through Ner and Kish (1Ch 8:29-33; 9:35-39; see ABIEL No. 1); the first divinely selected king of Israel. (1Sa 9:15, 16; 10:1) Saul came from a wealthy family. A handsome man, standing head and shoulders taller than all others of his nation, he possessed great physical strength and agility. (1Sa 9:1, 2; 2Sa 1:23) The name of his wife was Ahinoam. Saul fathered at least seven sons, Jonathan, Ishvi, Malchi-shua, Abinadab, Ish-bosheth (Eshbaal), Armoni, and Mephibosheth, as well as two daughters, Merab and Michal. Abner, evidently King Saul's uncle (see ABNER), served as chief of the Israelite army.-1Sa 14:49, 50; 2Sa 2:8; 21:8; 1Ch 8:33.|`|AA11131182	Kish|`|a8aa8ec409c42ca13727a9357259ee65aa	He was the son of Kish, of the tribe of Benjamin.

And have a hope and a lot of peace,  He's coming back to take you to be with him  Christianity is not making anyone scared.  Fear is opposite of faith.  Faith will give you a desire to go with him.  He has mercy and will abundantly pardon, all sin.  no one is perfect, only the father in heaven.  Have no fear and don't be afraid.  He loves you, he careth for his own.

He is comming back - God is not to be feared, but to be worshipped and loved and adored. The folks that fear (and I was one of them at some time believe me) do not know Jesus as their personal Lord and Saviour. No one knows the time or the day that He will return. This is a Great thing!!! Many folks try to tell the future of others, but they cannot even predict the weather correctly! Wierd!! All folks need to do is realise that Jesus came not to condemn, but to bring peace within the hearts of man, not as the world knows peace, but the deep knowing of Him as a personal Lord and Saviour, and God is not a puppet as many folks also believe. We must stand back in Awe of Him He is God alone and He can teach us so many things.   Why? Do you fear the one's who really love you? I don't think that many of these people who do love you will give their only son to die for you!!! God did just that He allowed Jesus to be put on that cross so that we - who were still sinners, mind you - could be saved. When this acceptance of Christ into one's life occurs after one realized what Jesus has done and is doing, all that fear goes and one wants to worship and love Him LOL!!!!

It has everything to do with it's followers. They want to legislate morality in this country, based on a book of fairy tales - a book about talking snakes, men of clay, women becoming pillars of salt, 500 year old men, giants, dragons, and talking firey bushes. Let's not forget the idea that you'll earn your reward in "heaven" but if you're bad, you go to "hell". At any rate - it's not so much the religion for me that's so horrible - it's no different from any other, just more pervasive in this society. It's the fundamentalist followers who scare me the most.|`|d9b59e7f0a1ad81e7ce2a771c6022a6caa	I think the Old Testament is almost completely myth, and I think all of the miracles of the New Testament are as well. There might have been a person who lived 2000 years ago who the stories of Jesus Christ are modeled after, but if so he was just a mortal man like you and me.    So I am not afraid in the slightest of him coming back. But I do have some fear due to Christianity. It is the fear of so many people believing a myth that calls of the destruction of society. I fear these people will make a self-fulfilling prophecy.

AA11932760	There are several reasons, many of which have already been stated.    I will add a further two. I have been driving in Asia for 20 years, and the question has often crossed my mind, so I decided to try to find out.  One day, in Thailand, I was driving very slowly down a narrown city street, when a car came the other way. Usually when I saw this, I would immediately pull well into the side to let them past, because they all think their vehicle is 6 feet wider than it really is. But on this day, I decided to keep going, so that I could notice when the other driver saw me. Eventuall;y I had to give in, because we were getting so close that I thought they would never see me. From this I thought that it was perhaps that they don't look very far ahead, and various other experiments proved this to be the case. They look no more than ten feet in front of them, which means they react very late, and very jerkily to everything.    Then I wondered why this was. It is a fact that they have very poor eyesight.  I teach in a Chinese school, and literally more than half the kids cannot read anything on the blackboard without glasses. Many of them do not wear glasses due to pride, so they cannot see well.    Another thing is that they are very poor judges of speed and distance. A previous answerer mentioned that they start to drive much later in life, but this is only a part of it. Very few Asians have the opportunity to ride in a car regularly when they are youngsters. I have been in a car almost everyday since I was born, and as a result I had ample opportunity to become accustomed with speed and distance. If you are in your late teens when you start sitting in a car regularly, then the learning curve is much greater.    And as stated before, driving tests are a very low standard, law enforcement is negligible, and there are no such things as advanced drivers clubs.|`|709fc7294c826d432a7157c3c4789142aa	Racist!!!!!!!

I HATE getting stuck behind one that can barely see over the wheel going 32 mph in a 45 zone, going from left to right in the same lane in a little mitsubishi or toyota.  But idk why.|`|980481388ec42263f3014b1ccd72d764aa	They aren't necessarily, in general.    However, as a foreigner living in Korea I can say that in general Koreans are lousy drivers.    Reason  1: They don't start driving as early in life as in the U.S.  I got my learners permit when I was 15 and received drivers training in high school.  Koreans generally start driving in or after college.  Many drivers here can't back up correctly or parallel park, which tells me they haven't had good training.  Also, it is not common for a high school student to drive a car, so the experience is not built up.    Reason  2: City drivers are more aggressive and Koreans are urbanites.      Reason  3:  Police don't enforce many rules and people commonly run red lights and break common traffic rules.  Society is pretty controlled, so I think one freedom people have is to break traffic rules rather than more important social rules.    Reason  4: Selfishness and pride.  I have been told that traditional culture here states that if you don't know someone then you have no relationship to them on the hierarchical system.  Therefore, they are non-persons and you don't have to respect others.  Many times I have heard that Koreans are the greatest drivers in the world.  Most conceited, proud drivers are lousy.    Reason  5: Bus drivers and taxi drivers are terrible role models.  Bus drivers here commonly run red lights and drive with poor technique (not slow and steady, but fast and jerky).  If you are in a hurry, it is nice to have Mario Andretti as your bus driver, but not good, safe driving.  The normal drivers copy what they see the "so-called" professionals do.|`|daa6d9365448927a230b4120ac3380dfaa	I'm Asian!    and I have to say...    ...its TRUE!!    I agree 100% with what David W says. Because I honestly don't think I can see that well... I could probably benefit from some glasses!!|`|7d647be57724929a656a84a04d156140aa	Might have to do with their height.|`|d06774e9d71ab1a2fec434dbc6a1301eaa	Stereotypically they are bad drivers because Asian immigrants come from places where most people do not drive cars, and when you do, there are very few rules and regulations about how close you can get to somebody else's car, how fast you go, etc.  Majority of people in many Asian countries use public transportation or bicycles.  As a result they may just haven't had a lot of experience driving yet, that's why teenagers aren't great drivers either.    Saying Asian people are horrible drivers is definitely an overgeneralization, as Asians born and raised here, or ones who have been here for very long drive no different than anybody else.  Also it's a fact that people tend to see what they want to see based on their beliefs - there may be a dozen bad drivers you experience on the way to work, but you may only notice the Asian one because you have that mindset in your head that they are bad drivers.|`|418c947c9e732f03421253914131f052aa	That is a great question and I would like to know that answer myself.

Hope you don't go there, I hear its hot and lonely down there. Remember when you feel judgmental, to look at yourself first, because we all miss the mark at times. You don't have to go to hell, that is a choice we make, Its not a fun spot.

By the way, there are no special places in hell!|`|AA10566013	Sorry to tell you this but there is no place in hell for you.  When Jesus was influencing John to write the book of revelation, he commended an entire church congregation for searching out the truth.   The problem now-a--days is that people believe lies coming from the pulpit, to their detriment. Preachers in the USA continue to dispense lies and bad information so they can swell their pockets.  If you want the truth, try this link, and follow it up with a telephone call.|`|17858ae2e198220c136ebe88aee75909aa	I like to try to answer this.    First of all God does not send anyone to Hell.  what!  That correct God created Hell for the Lost people.  They are the people that "rejects" His Son Jesus Christ as their personal Savior. repent! A person that rejects Jesus as their savior will go to Hell.  Now listen, Hell was created by God. right!  Now God gives us a free will to accept His Son Jesus or to reject Him. our choice!    Hell is the penalty for rejecting His Son Jesus. And for rejecting Him. Each human make that choice to accept or reject.  We know what happens if we reject Him.  The penalty is enternal life in Hell. our decision!  So, anothers words we send ourself to Hell if we reject Jesus.  That the penalty for this decision..God keeps his promies.  He made about anyone rejecting Jesus His Son. Hell! That the law from the very beginning of time.    Example here:    The county builds a jail house. correct!  Now, the county is not going to put someone in the jail house for no reason. right!  But, you and me know their is jail house and prisions all over the world. right!  Now the state has rules {laws} and we know them in advance. ok!  Now if you or me go out and break the rules [laws] we have to pay for them according to the rules [laws] that was made. Now, the rules says for murder. We spend the rest of  nature life on earth is to be in prision.  The judge did not make the rules. He just go by the rules {laws} that was decided for breaking the law..understand!  It was our decision when we did wrong. Now, we have to pay for that decision.    Our choice Heaven or Hell.  God made the rules [laws] and we make the decision to break them or go by them.  again, our decision. So, bottom line we actualy send ourself to Hell. Because we didn't go by the law that was made in the beginning. God, just keeps His promies about what the penalty is for rejecting His Son Jesus.    Now here the good news. Those who accept Jesus into their hearts will go to Heaven. Again, that the law that was made from the beginning of time. And God keeps his promies on this also. We accept Jesus as our personal saviour. The law that God made in the beginning is get to go to Heaven.  yes!    Now, you see the law tells us we our sinners. Because no one can keep all the laws without breaking at least one.  The law point us to God.  Jesus came to earth to fulfill the laws. because He is the only one that could live on earth without breaking any laws. or another words. Jesus did not sin one time. Now, Jesus is our lawyer and anyone that goes to him. He will go to God and tell God I paid the price for us. But, it is our decision whether to go to Jesus or not.    hopes this helps.|`|7c81c6e02eae66447e66f07970f1f40faa	sure hope not ... hell is hell|`|973d26ae4f4c37c06293df385f9560caaa	i dunno. do you? if he does, i'll probably see you there. =D>|`|3f752fdaa112075eecfa9055b75b83e7aa	Yes you do, or no you don't, take a pick.|`|2148b016aaf6ae13b05da6b1299ecd81aa	your stupid!|`|7c1446ff7db60e24ddda1fa1425b5380aa	I think that God has a special place in heaven for you.

You are a very honest person in being able to express what you feel about you, no matter what.  Everybody  has problems and things to make you a better person in life    The important thing is that you try to improve yourself.  Nobody dies perfect because anyway we are human beings with our defects and virtues.  Take out of your mind those negative thoughts and think about all the good things that you have done in life.  Think about what you can do to improve yourself. God loves all his creatures.|`|AA10479430	Now that you realized it.......would you still like to go there (hell)?

It could also be an attempt to define oneself, when the person doesn't feel like they fit into the main stream beliefs.

This thing is not (Quite Dead) yet, as It keeps trying to surface back into your life .It is intimidating you for whatever reason to the point that you are trying to snuff it out whenever it tries to surface again. You thought that this issue or talent was gone and dealt with for good, but it's not. You have some unfinished lessons or business associated with it that you must learn.     You know exactly what it is that I'm talking about, and it's been eating at you recently. You will face this head on and resolve it within the next 6 months (Could be off a bit on the time frame).    You WILL let the proverible Fish REACH THE WATER ,and this will be a turning point for you in your life. I feel strongly that this has to do with a male, maybe 30 to 40 years old, and the role that he plays in some situation at WORK....(or school)    Don't be afraid of "Killing it". I see you solving the situationto your advantage and growing. The whole "Killing it" thing is just nerves and a little insecurity........    Stay strong    Steve|`|AA12200754	i would say your dream contains elements of your fear of being "caught"  or trapped, as the fish was.  also, the constant attempts by the fish to make it back to the water conveys a sense of your feeling you haven't reached your goal although you have tried endlessly.  dreams of this nature are quite common for people who feel they are confined, controlled, and lacking freedom of actions, thoughts, opinions.  examine your life and make some changes if any of these conditions exist in your life.  good luck!|`|AA10951001	sounds like you are trying to figure something out in your own life if you really did do the right thing or not.|`|d1a69c182fd92c141b6d3936a21a845daa	perhaps you are in a relationship that is coming to a halt due to the other person and you are afraid to let go...|`|a140881c9fdd334b220d9dc8e35b069baa	I think that you have something in your life that is dead to you but God is trying to bring it back to life and you keep killing it over and over but the Lord wants you to let it live and not stop it.|`|7d647be57724929a656a84a04d156140aa	Fish represents spirit or soul.  A person character or motive.  Why should a harmless fish scare you?  All it wanted to do was to live, but you couldn't let it.  Give life a chance - live and let live.

Sex outside marriage is condemned for a lot of reasons.  He made us to be with one person and we invite heartache and defeat in our lives when we disobey.  At least there was no pregnancy or disease this time.  Try it His way.  Take it from someone who knows the consequences of doing things her way and the rewards of doing things the Lord's way.

En lo personal me gustaba, sobre todo, si la persona que me tocaba era de mi agrado. Durante semanas se daban detalles o se hacan "maldades", hasta el da que se estableca como "el da del regalo final". Yo no acostumbraba hacer maldades, pues me gustaba tener detallitos que agradaran a la persona, especialmente si saba que la persona coleccionaba algo o si practicaba algn deporte, etc. Claro, buscaba cositas super econmicas o hasta un dulce, y lo acompa?aba con un pensamiento positivo. La idea era que la persona siempre recibiera algo. Siempre se aclaraba que la intencin no era tener gastos, solo en el regalo final, donde ponamos un precio mdico.  Luego de preparar una caja para que se pusieran los detalles, tu veas a los compa?eros (especial los varones) tratando de que no los vieran poniendo el detalle. Durante las semanas, las personas queriendo averiguar quien tena su nombre. Era super divertido. Y cuando tocaba repartir los "detallitos", todos como ni?os peque?os, alrededor de la caja que se preparaba.  Hay personas que participan y exigen cosas caras y hasta se enojan si le dan lo que ellos llaman "una porquera". Estas personas, te da?an el compartir. Por eso siempre se trataba, que los que participaran, lo hicieran, por la diversin de la actividad. De verdad que el evento nos una como grupo, ya que la semana de produccin, era muy tensa. Siempre adivinaba quien tena mi papelito y con honestidad, nunca "vigilaba" para ver cuando alguien depositaba en la cajita su "detalle". Prcticas, que se han perdido o los han "tergiversado con exigencias". A las personas que todava lo practican les digo, que no permitan personas, que le quiten el encato a esta "tradicin".|`|4b7b1f9b42391e9ca42c4eec3d4ed525aa	LO  QE  YO  PIENSO  ESQE   EN  PARTE   SON   BUENOS  PERO  NO   SIEMPRE  POR  EJEMPLO  EL  A?O  PASADO  EN  MI  ESCUELA   HIZIERON  INTERCAMBIOSY   UNA   NI?A  LE   TOKO   DARME A  MI  Y  ME  DIO  UN  TAPETE  DEL  AMERICA  Y  REALMENTE   YO  NO LE   VOY  A  NINGUNO  ASI   QE  MUCHAS  VESES   NO  SON  BUENOS   SUERTE!!!!!!!!|`|126015d281d9f1f32ed2460989793d9aaa	Disculpen que suene egoista, pero el mejor intercambio  de regalos que uno puede hacer es con uno mismo.  Puede sona onanista, pero lo prefiero a sonar tremendamente  pervertido como me parece ese acto de swingers consumistas.    La navidad es de Jesus y los ni?os, los adultos solo somos comparsa, los comerciantes interesados crean la tradicion y los que tuvieron problemilllas pican el anzuelo.    El intercambio no es ninguna tradicion, que culpa tendre yo si no recibiste regalos cuando  los debiste recibir, parte de la madurez es asumir lo que le toco a uno, y no inventar intercambios de regalos porque fuiste una ni?ita o ni?ito.

No siempre quien recibe un regalo estara en la capacidad de retornar uno ms o menos semejante. Por esto, prefiero pensar s en compartir o simplemente en regalar pero sin esperar que la otra persona me retorne.    Se habla mucho de los aspectos comerciales. Bueno, busquemos no hacerle tanto juego a esta prctica y cuando queramos compartir, simplemente hagmoslo con mucho gusto sin fijarse mucho en si me corresponden o no.    El amigo secreto, al menos en Colombia, es una prctica programada  en la cual s se dan regalos o algn smbolo a alguien conocido y se espera recibir de alguien desconocido, secreto, el regalo o el smbolo. Pero esto se hace el da del descubrimiento. Mientras tanto, se endulza con detallitos que pueden ser golosinas, frutas o algo por el estilo.|`|f42b972f9c0125591981142fd8d267c2aa	Francamente me gustan, no les tienes que regalar a TODOS, y no recibes cualquier cantidad de regalos que no sabes ni qu hacer con ellos.    Yo lo hago en mi oficina, nos rifan, y luego nos reunimos para dar tres opciones del regalo que nos gustara recibir, adems hay un precio mnimo y mximo, con eso sabes que la otra persona no va a gastar menos que lo que gastaste t.    Tambin con la familia hacemos eso. La verdad es qu ayuda mucho en la economa, ya que de todos modos tienes que gastar, es bastante menos, adems, como alguien te escribi, tienes el factor sorpresa, que t no sabes quin te va a regalar, ni qu.

I used to cut, so I know what I'm talking about. You should seek help fast, either professionally or someone you trust that you can call at any time you feel the need to cut. Find an activity that helps take your mind off of cutting (I used to drive myself to church if I got the urge during the day and pray, not for everyone, but it worked for me. at night, I'd pop in a movie). This is serious and I certainly hope you didn't put this up a joke.    I do advice you seek help. From one ex-cutter to hopefully another.|`|9a4de899a5f05ad7a0a25137466be97aaa	Oh, God.

"19We know that we are children of God, and that the whole world is under the control of the evil one."|`|b46252d869ef4a19b1d466a029cffe5caa	Satan has free reign of this Earth, true enough. But God is ultimately in control of what goes on. Obviously you have read the Bible, and I don't think you're just trying to prove God and Christians wrong...so read the Bible more.

But at the same time, God knows what is going on and He will not allow Satan to tempt you more than you can bear. God id definately in control of all things but Satan will have his part in the lake of fire because Christ has already overcome him.|`|43d4d8862dbe5022a7a6bc012dc2dda9aa	Yes I agree,  but there are limits to his control.  Why do you think the events of the tribulation get so bad, after God removes the restrainer.  Scripture reference Revelation.                  Unfortunately,  free will creatures are behind 90% of all suffering that goes on,  not God, or Satan.  People do things to hurt each other every day for their own gain.  and people say "the devil made me do it."  "or why didn't God stop me."  Just like the atheists clamoring for the right not to believe in God.  They will too probably say "The devil made me not believe."  or "Why didn't God make me believe."    PEOPLE ARE A PRODUCT OF THIER OWN DECISIONS.                                    LOVED YOUR QUESTION                 MERRY CHRISTMAS|`|d80773243cbc1e2252b7bb5ae9205ca0aa	Terry S, is right!

God is ultimately in control, not Satan.|`|da299c62a221a555ad4046ee9f846c8aaa	In my bible John 5:19 says " Jesus said to them, "Very truly, I tell you, the Son can do nothing on his own, but only what he sees the Father doing: for whatever the Father does, the son does likewise."    All three of the bibles that I looked at say a combination of what the first one says.  What version are you looking at?|`|e730a06d540ca90b9db019ec8a3d2784aa	First, verses have a different meaning depending on the translation. I only use KJV (King James) :   The verses read:  1John 5:19  And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness.  I think you meant 1 John 4:8   1Jo 4:8  He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.  because James 4:8 reads:  Jam 4:8  Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.  The whole world lieth in wickedness has a different meaning than "the wicked one is in control" as you stated.   Also, different religions are going to have different ideas. For example, some Christians believe that God is in control of the universe; however, men (and women) have freewill. Each decide to do good or evil. Others believe in predestination; which, is a whole other ball game.  Anyway, I hope this helps.

f0fea21c00cd1dae3d86b9192e7dd235aa	The best techniques to overcoming fear of public speaking are the most simple ones. Presuming that you don't suffer from an excessive degree of communication apprehension (beyond the general "jitters" that all public speakers face), here are seven steps that will work.    1. Speak about what you know. A good public speech comes from some degree of expertise. Ensure that your topic stems from your interests and experiences.     2. Prepare and practice. Public speaking is an artform that hides a discipline. You want to appear relaxed and conversational. But the only way to accomplish that goal is to develop a well conceived outline of your main points and run through your speech several times. I recommend that you practice in front of a video camera for self-analysis and also practice in front of two or three trusted friends. Ask for positive feedback and constructive criticism.    3. Visualize success. Many public speakers psyche themselves out because they presume their audiences will judge them harshly. Instead, you should prepare for success. Close your eyes and visualize your audience enjoying your speech. Use your imagination to see them nodding with appreciation at your insights, hear them laughing at your well-timed humor, and expect them to be clapping at your successful conclusion. The body generally follows the lead of the mind. So if the mind is prepared to do well, the body will perform accordingly.    4. Anticipate some "nerves." When your heart rate increases, your palms get clammy, and your extremities shake mildly, it's a scary sensation, but it's entirely normal. It's called the "fight or flight" response; it's your body preparing to do something extraordinary. And for most people, public speaking is extraordinary. So when you experience nerves, don't overreact to them. That's just your body's way of saying, "This is different, and I'm getting ready for it." As you progress through the speech, your nerves will reach a plateau and then the physical signs of your anxiety will decrease. Pretty soon you'll feel much better.     5. Pay particular attention to your introduction and conclusion. Professionals might explain this in terms of 'primacy effect' and 'recency effect,' but the general rule is: start and leave with a good impression. Your intro should begin with a timely story or interesting statistic, one that sets the scene for your speech. The conclusion should "tie back" to that story or statistic - conveying that you're wrapping the speech up - and end on a thoughtful and/or upbeat note. Here's a hint. Develop your conclusion so that there's no need to fall back on the old standby: "Thank you" (or worse, "that's it").    6. Concentrate on your purpose. Your purpose is to inform, entertain, or persuade. But in a larger sense, your goal is to better the lives of your audience through this speech. If you keep that goal in mind at all times of your speech, you'll earn the good will of your audience. That good will comes handy: if you make a little mistake, they'll forgive you readily. You're not trying to impress them; you're trying to benefit them. Most people appreciate the effort, even if it's less than perfect.    7. Remember paralanguage. As the saying goes, "it's not just what you say but how you say it." Work to offer dynamic vocals, relaxed and illustrative gestures, and meaningful eye contact. This latter component is essential. Don't simply read from note cards; focus on all sides of the room and really *look* at individual audience members. The impression you generate is shaped as much by your voice and body language as by your word choice - maybe even more.    I am an associate professor of communication studies at San Jose State University, and I offer this advice with confidence. Follow these steps and you should do well.    The next step is to seek opportunities to practice the art, to make mistakes, receive feedback, and learn from your successes.     Good luck!|`|19424b165f9d3ef44f2f311f04a1775aaa	1) picture everyone either naked or taking a dump  2) start your speech off with a joke  3) take a deep breath before you start speaking|`|cfd58f7f882fb4ab349c3dbaf13074baaa	start speaking to people in public settings.... even if just eye contact and saying hello.  it will build confidence

Otra teora hace descender la palabra del idioma Cherokee y dice que los de Virginia la usaban peyorativamente para referirse a los del norte que no les ayudaron en una guerra contra esa nacin indgena. Finalmente, los Ingleses usaron el trmino tambin peyorativamente durante la Guerra de Independencia de EEUU pero los norteamericanos lo adoptaron con orgullo. Posteriormente el trmino separ a los partidarios de la Unin (norte)  de los de la Confederacin (Sur) durante la Guerra Civil (1860-1865).

Algunas autoridades creen que la palabra "yankee" puede haberse originado de la voz holandesa "yanke", que significa "Juanito", mientras que otros dicen que los indios americanos pronunciaban mal la palabra francesa "anglais", que significa "ingls." El resultado fue la palabra "Yankee". Antes de la Guerra de la Independencia, los soldados britnicos comenzaban a referirse en forma despectiva a los colonos, a quienes consideraban patanes pueblerinos, como "yankees". Pero los morteamericanos, lejos de ofenderse, ms bien gustaron del apodo y pronto lo adoptaron para referirse a s mismos.     Durante la Primera y la Segunda Guerra Mundial, las tropas norteamericanas eran conocidas en todo el mundo como "yanks" o "yankees". Una cancin popular escrita en 1917 por el autor teatral y compositor George M. Cohan titulada "Over There" contiene la apasionada estrofa: "?Ah vienen los yankees! ?Ah vienen los yankees!"     La cancin "Yankee Doodle", que en la actualidad est tan identificada con los norteamericanos, se cantaba en Inglaterra desde los tiempos de la reina Isabel I en el siglo XVI. A mediados de los a?os 1600, las tropas gubernamentales al mando del rey Carlos I cantaban estas palabras en tono de desprecio dirigidas a Oliver Cromwell, el rebelde al frente de la revolucin de los puritanos, la cual a la postre derroc a la monarqua.     En 1775, cuando las batallas de Lexington y Concord se?alaban el inicio de la Guerra de la Independencia en Norteamrica, las tropas coloniales cantaban la tonada con letra escrita por un cirujano britnico para ridiculizarlas. La tonada se convirti en el canto de guerra del ejercito de George Washington y los hombres la cantaban cuando marchaban, cuando acampaban y cuando peleaban. Cada verso era seguido del coro. As comenzaba:     Mi padre y yo fuimos a acampar /Junto con el Capitn Gooding /Ah vimos hombres y muchachos /Tan profusos como el pudn casero. Coro: Yankee Doodle, mantente firme, Yankee Doodle galn /Sigue la msica y el paso /Y con las chicas hazte fcil.     Mas no todos los 15 versos eran alegres. El penltimo dice as:     Veo otra fila de hombres, /Cavando sepulturas, me dijeron; /Tan largas y tan hondas /Para que en ellas cupiera yo. A principio de pgina              Yanqui  De Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre  Saltar a navegacin, bsqueda  ?Yankee? es tambin la letra Y en el alfabeto fontico de la OTAN.   Yanqui es un anglicismo derivado del trmino yankee. Su uso en la lengua espa?ola se utiliza, generalmente, con sentido peyorativo (e incluso ofensivo) para identificar a cualquier persona de nacionalidad estadounidense. El origen del vocablo es incierto, pero ciertamente se hizo popular durante la Guerra Civil Estadounidense (1861-1865). Yankee se refera a los soldados y en general los residentes de los estados del norte.    En su lengua original, el ingls norteamericano, yankee generalmente se refiere a los residentes y nacionales estadounidenses de la Costa Noreste de los EE.UU., particularmente en los estados del rea denominada Nueva Inglaterra (estados de Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont, etc.). En su lengua nativa el trmino casi nunca es utilizado en sentido peyorativo (excepto tal vez por los ciudadanos de los estados del sur), y quienes utilizan el trmino para s mismos lo hacen con sentido orgulloso de identidad.    Gringo  De Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre  Saltar a navegacin, bsqueda  Gringo es un trmino usado en espa?ol y portugus, con diversos significados, a menudo mal interpretado por las personas angloparlantes.    En forma general el trmino se aplica a extranjeros que hablan en un idioma que no se entiende por personas que hablan espa?ol. El trmino ha sido aplicado segn las pocas y regiones a ingleses, alemanes, franceses, italianos y, especialmente, a los estadounidenses.    En ciertos pases latinoamericanos, como Guatemala o Colombia, el trmino se aplica casi exclusivamente para los ciudadanos estadounidenses.      [editar] Teoria sobre el Origen de la palabra Gringo  Ahora decimos "me estas hablando en chino", cuando no entendemos a alguna persona, pero antes los espa?oles llamaban "griegos" a los extranjeros. Esto proviene del tiempo de los romanos y su proverbio en latn graecum est; non potest legi que significa: "est en griego y no puede ser ledo". Esta metfora es usada en otros idiomas europeos. Por ejemplo, en ingls dicen: "it's all Greek to me" (frase usada por William Shakespeare [Julio Cesar] en 1599). Es interesante notar que los evangelios fueron escritos en griego antes que en latn. Unos historiadores creen que la asociacin de "griego" con "extranjero" era para indicar que el idioma griego no era necesario para entender la doctrina catlica.    La palabra "gringo" aparece escrita en Espa?a en el siglo XVIII. El famoso "Diccionario Castellano con las voces de ciencias y artes" (1786-1793), compilado por el padre Esteban de Terreros y Pando, explica que la palabra gringo es usada para referirse a extranjeros que tienen dificultad para hablar castellano con naturalidad. Lo ms probable es que "gringo" es una deformacin de la palabra "griego". La palabra "gringo" aparece en el DRAE por primera vez en el a?o 1869 y es definida como: "Voz usada familiarmente. Vale tanto como GRIEGO en esta frase: HABLAR EN GRINGO, hacerlo en lenguaje ininteligible."    El "Breve Diccionario Etimolgico De La Lengua Espa?ola" menciona 1765-83 para la primera aparicin, como alteracin de "griego".    En el Vocabulario Rioplatense de Daniel Granada (1890) se dice que en la poca el t

On the day of Judgment, yes it will be initially painful to see them being judged, but when God takes His grace away from them, all that will remain will be the wicked evil decietful beings that they were on Earth. And you'll not cry when they are dragged off and cast into the lake of fire. You'll rejoice to God that He has rid heaven of such evil.  All eyes will be on the Glory of Christ in Heaven.    As for friends here on Earth, it's incredibly painful knowing that if they were to die tonight they would go to hell forever. That's why I at least try to warn them. But I can't force them to do anything.

7d647be57724929a656a84a04d156140aa	1 Corinthians 1:18-26  "The message of the cross is foolishness to those who are headed for distruction!  But we who are being saved know it is the very power of God.  As the scripture say "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will discard the intelligence of the intelligent."  So where does this leave the philosophers, the scholors and the world's brillian debaters?  God has made the wisdom of this world look foolish.  Since God in His wisdom saw to it that the world would never know Him through human wisdom, He has used our foolish preaching to save those who believe.  It is foolish to the Jews who asked for signs from Heaven and is foolish to the Greeks who seeks human wisdom.  So when we preached that Christ was crucified the Jews are offended and the Gentiles say it is all nonsense.  But to those called by God unto salvation, both Jews and Gentiles, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.  This foolish plan of God is wiser than the wisest human plans, and God weakness is stronger than the greatest of human strength."

But it you want, next time a Muslim says the Bible is trash ask him why does the Quran say he has to have imam (faith) in the Injil,Torah, and David's Psalms. Some of us Muslims are ignorant and some of us aren't, we are on different levels and on different paths like the Christians and Jewish Believers.

The Torah, Pslams, Gospel and Qu'ran. Revealed to the Prophet's Moses, David, Jesus and Muhammad [Peace be Upon them all].   We do not however believe the current versions of the Bible constitute 100% revelation from God. But I do not slander anyone, or the Bible we will all be called to account for what we used to do.    As to why? If you are interested watch the Debate between Dr. Campbell and Dr. Zakir Naik, called "The Bible and Qu'ran in light on Modern science" You can see it on youtube.

So judge among them by what God has revealed, and follow not their vain desires, diverging away from the truth that has come to you. To each among you, We have prescribed a law and a clear way. If God had willed, He would have made you one nation, but that (He) may test you in what He has given you; so compete in good deeds.

All I can say is thank you Lord.|`|13143ba00cdf7ee11b6a78bb953b2bf9aa	That is based on a mistranslation of Romans 5:12 in the Vulgate, coupled with Augustine's defense against Pelegius and Anselm's doctrine of satisfaction.    The view of the early Church was that no sin was imputed to the Gentiles to begin with. Salvation was accomplished through a sacramental union with the resurrection of Christ, and not by a substitutionary atonement. See Romans 4:25: "[Jesus] was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification." Also Romans 5:13, "...sin is not imputed when there is no law." And the New Testament constantly affirms that the Gentiles were never under the Law.    The idea of original sin and substitutionary atonement is unique to Roman Catholicism and Protestantism. It is not found in the theology of the Eastern Orthodox, Monophysites, Melkites, Maronites, Malabarians, Uniates, Old Calendarists, Nestorians, etc.|`|AA10028372	Adam was a perfect man created by God and had the chance to live forever.  Because he sinned he died and thus sin and death spread to all mankind.  So according to God's law it would take the death of another perfect man to rectify the affects of Adamic sin on the rest of mankind.  God gave his son to make that happen and his son willfully chose to give his perfect life as a human so that mankind could have the same chance as Adam and Eve had before they sinned.  The bible tells us that the wages of sin is death , but even though we all are imperfect, God loves us so much that he is going to give us a fresh start in the resurrection that Christ spoke of while he was on earth.    Just because Adam's sin spread death to mankind doesn't Mean that God's purpose changed for man kind or for the Earth.      Isaiah 55:10-11:   10"For as the rain and the snow come down from heaven,           And do not return there without watering the earth           And making it bear and sprout,           And furnishing seed to the sower and bread to the eater;       11So will My word be which goes forth from My mouth;           It will not return to Me empty,           Without accomplishing what I desire,           And without succeeding in the matter for which I sent it.

GENESIS 2:18 Y EL SENOR DIJO: NOES BUENO QUE EL HOMBRE ESTE SOLO ; LE HARE UNA AYUDA IDONEA.  Esa ayuda idonea por supuesto que era una mujer , Eva.  GENESIS2:24 POR TANTO EL HOMBRE DEJARA A SU PADRE Y MADRE Y SE UNIRA A SU MUJER, Y SERAN UNA SOLA CARNE.  Compartir intimamente.  1ra. CORINTIOS capitulo7 vrsiculo2 NO OBSTANTE, POR RAZON DE LAS INMORALIDADES, QUE CADA HOMBRE TENGA SU PROPIA MUJER, Y CADA MUJER SU PROPIO MARIDO.  Es natural y reconoido por Dios que todos requerimos pareja.  La verdadera doctrina fue la de los apostoles y no hay razon alguna para que sea diferente entre el libro de genesis  y la primera carta a los corintios hay miles de anos de diferencia en que fueron escritos uno del otro y no cambia esa ensenanza y mandato divino .  Ahora con respecto a los dirigentes (((se les llama ancianos , ovispos  o pastores y se supone que conocen con mas profundidad las cosas de Dios , y tienen mas cuidado de ellas))) espirituales veamos cuales son los requisitos que deben reunir...... y donde lo vamos a ver??..En la biblia , por supuesto y que conste que todas dicen lo mismo.  TITOcap1vers 5 y 6  : Por eso te deje en Creta, para que pusieras en orden todo lo que queda, y designaras ancianos en cada ciudad como te mande  esto es , si alguno es irreprensible, marido de una sola mujer, que tenga hijos creyentes, no acusados de disolucion, ni de rebeldia.  En los siguientes versiculos hasta el nueve en este capitulo, habla de mas caracteristicas de un dirigente cristiano , pero ya viste lo que dice en el 6,, otra vez lo mismo!!!! , como requisito habla de estar casado y hasta con hijos.  La palabra de Dios no se contradice , los que se contradicen somos los seres humanos , pero muchas veces no nos interesa que es lo que ordena Dios. Estas palabras fueran dichas por el apostol Pablo , asi como toda la Biblia fue dicha y escrita por hombres , pero......INSPIRADOS POR DIOS .  No podemos escoger solo de donde a mi me gusta y lo que no me gusta lo ignoro. , asi no funciona .  Como comentario final existe el libro del apocalipsis el cual fue escrito alrededor del ano 95 despues de Cristo. Y en el capitulo 22 versiculos 18 y 19 que dice asi: Yo testifico a todo aquel que oye las palabras de la  profecia de este libro: Si alguno anadiere a estas cosas, Dios traera sobre el , las plagas que estan escritas en este libro.   Y si alguno quitare de las palabras de este libro de la profecia, Dios quitara su parte del libro de la vida y de la santa ciudad y de las cosas que estan escritas en este libro.   Busca de la sana doctrina , Dios te ama y todas tus dudas estan en la palabra de Dios , la Biblia.  www.iglesiadecristo.com|`|f4120f540384b4917a6de451a10b9f01aa	Por supuesto. Tienen tanto derecho como cualquiera de nosotros. Pero la Iglesia catlica nunca lo permitir. Hay muchos intereses de por medio, aunque est ms que comprobado que la mayora no pueden con el celibato.

I have several children and my husband was a bit frustrated with the over extension of myself towards them. They are all grown with families of their own but, as a mother, I can't seem to say 'NO'! I put my life on hold for them and even go out of my way to make sure they were taken care of before myself. I did what they told me to do and although I thought better of it, at times, I still did it anyway! My husband and I recently sold our home and in the process of moving I received a wake up call that floored me! My husband has been trying for years to get me to stop over extending myself for them, but I felt obligated! Hmm ((shrug))!  Needless to say, my husband and I down sized our home and moved to an apartment. It was an eye opener, to say the least!  To make a long story short, myself and my husband moved an entire 3 bedroom home by ourselves. During the move I broke my arm because we couldn't get the help we needed to move a very large refridg.. We had the thing nearly all the way to the top of the stairs and I lost my grip. It fell forward and smashed my arm between it and the stairs! Big OUCH! I am now typing with one hand and praying that I don't go back to the way things were!  I still love my children, two boys and two girls, but I can't stop my life anymore! They are adults and as such need to learn on their own what it's like to be one!   Good Luck

The world is not black and white, and the universe is in multidues of gray for a reason. Also, I'm happy for those people who don't feel they should limit themselves, and I'm happy for those people who know exactly what they're looking for. Bisexuality doesn't make you confused, you're just more open to a more broad idea of love.    I don't know about you, but whether a person is straight/bi/gay shouldn't really matter, because unless you're interested in them, it doesn't affect you. So, don't worry about it.|`|4f53edbce16f4673f58a9dcccc9dfddfaa	No, we're not confused.  A person can want to spend the rest of their life with one person that they're in love with, even if they are attracted to both sexes.  That's a common misconception about bisexuals, that we're all promiscuous.    I'm bi, but I'm engaged to a guy.  Doesn't mean I'm not attracted to women also.  If I had never met him, I could have met a woman and  fell in love her and been engaged to her.  I love the person, not the sex.|`|b72eccc1ca6509975c85dfba46c2a40daa	I think bisexual people are just free spirits. They fall for the energy and personality of a person, not thier sex. With gays, whether or not their male/female plays a big part in whether or not their attracted with that person. With bisexuals, its like they couldn't care less. They're attracted to that person, period, and they're gonna go for it. Atleast, that's how I see it.|`|cfdaa128dfa2a07a157aa79c35d7f3abaa	What is wrong with choosing both?  I like bacon for breakfast, and I also like sausage.  Why should I choose one over the other?  Am I confused for liking both on my plate at the same time?    There are 2 types of bisexuality.  There is serial and parallel bisexuality.  By "serial," I mean either a male or a female with this partner, and maybe male or female with the next partner should the relationship resolve.  The "parallel" type may have a partner of each gender at the same time.    As for marriage, keep in mind that heterosexual marriages are still considered the gold standard by many people.  The gay model is coming along.  However, polygamory is still not accepted.  So right now, bisexuals who marry have to use either the straight model or the gay model.  So don't blame them if they have no appropriate model or precedent to use that truly and accurately reflects their nature.    Lets also consider the fact that the capacity to make satisfying love to members of either gender has nothing to do with promiscuity.  It is just that most bisexuals allow themselves to have a larger repertoire than most other people.  So they may still pick one partner for marriage like most people who marry,  but they have a larger pool to draw upon up until that point.|`|AA12063577	How about the person falls in love with who ever they fall in love with ... doesn't matter if they're male or female ... me personally ...

It is the opposite of no.    Synonyms    In colloquial language, and especially in spoken English, "yes" is often replaced by "yeah", "yea", "yep" (with various spellings, including "yup"), "uh-huh", "yah" and "aye". Regionalisms for "yes" include: "ah" and "are" (used in the English Midlands and South-West, respectively), "abuli" and "chupper" (used only in some Australian regions), and "ayuh", (generally used only in Maine). "Aye" is more common in Scotland and northern England. It may also be used in meetings: "All who agree say 'aye'". "Aye" is also a nautical way of saying "yes". "Aye, Aye" means "I hear the command, I understand it, and will obey it". "Yea" is archaic.    Aye    "Aye", sometimes misconstrued as slang, is standard speech in Scotland and much of northern England. It is not stigmatised nor spoken by solely a substratum of Scottish society.    In a nautical context, it does not typically denote "yes" as an answer to a yes or no question, but rather is an acknowledgement of an order."yes" also means to do.    Etymology    The word "yes" comes from the Old English ?se, ?se, ?yse (pronounced with a palatized g which was represented by a yogh), with the literal meaning of so be it!. From ?a + s, the present subjunctive of to be (be it!). Ga, (possibly meaning thus), is from the Proto-Germanic *ja or *je, with the meaning of yes or truly.    Notes on usage        * In English, "yes" is also used to answer a negative question or statement, an example of "yes" used to disagree with a question or statement is:        The questions "You dont want it, do you?" and "Dont you want it?" can be answered by "yes" if the respondent does want the item, and "no" if he or she does not. However, other words are used when the answer needs to be clearly delineated, as in "Of course I want it," or "No, not at all." It can be confusing when someone asks a question that only contains a negative statement. For example, "You don't want it?" can be answered "yes" or "no" and could be confused as meaning either yes or no. Many languages use a different word for this purpose. For example, German has "doch" for this purpose (rather than "ja"), French uses "si" (rather than "oui") and the mainland Scandinavian languages (Danish, Swedish and Norwegian) use "jo" ("jau" in Nynorsk).|`|d77fb708145a2b246542f13f77c91d71aa	I usually skip them.    I don't like cut and paste, and I don't like talking too much about something.    I love the phrase that says "the best of speech is what is short and informative".    Yeah, sometimes I have to explain something, but I'd rather do it in my own set of words then cut and paste.    Just my opinion.      Peace.

You need to keep yourself worthy as well.    There's probably better answers coming from the men since we don't have lessons about magnifying priesthood in Relief Society lol.    For some reason I think of a story I heard a long time ago, I can't remember all the details. But there was a priesthood holder and a member of his family got really really sick. He wasn't worthy to perform a blessing and he had to go find someone else who could do it instead.   He is an example of not magnifying his priesthood.|`|FyLfEPv0aa	Not just do your duty but do it to the best of your abilities.

Everyone has a duty to perform, such as   Bishop (Pastor),  Scout Master, Sunday School teacher, missionary, relief society member, etc there are over 100 assignments possible.You magnify your calling by doing it better. Because everyone works together, the church can send our millions of dollars for humanitarian service.

If you preform your priesthood duties faithfully the Lord will trust you with more responsibility.|`|AA10637643	Well, to "magnify" means to make something bigger... so I would think, to spread the gospel through the power of the Priesthood - ie serve a mission, give blessings, be worthy to hold the Priesthood.  And for women, since we do not hold the Priesthood, we can support our Priesthood holders in every way possible.  Even asking for a blessing is a way to support them.|`|6DmsiLGbaa	To magnify the priesthood is to do everything possible to uphold priesthood responsibilities and use that authority from God to uplift and protect others.  It simply isn't enough for a man to have the priesthood; instead, he must actively use it to benefit others and to build the kingdom of God here on the earth.    Let me give you an example.  I know a man who, while an active, worthy member who holds the priesthood, rarely uses it.  He'll reluctantly give a blessing only if no one else is around who can, and he'll carry out his calling and visit the families under his care, but again, only reluctantly.     Then there's another man, one who, like the first, is a worthy priesthood holder.  Unlike the first, however, the second man feels grateful for the chance to bless others, goes above and beyond with his calling and his interactions to members of the church and his fellow men, and is overjoyed for any chance to contribute to the welfare of others.      Is the first man doing anything wrong, even by comparison?  Probably not, but he's also not using the priesthood as fully as he can.  He is not magnifying the priesthood.  When we're given any blessing or responsibility from God, we should do all we can to use it to benefit those around us.  This is what it means to magnify anything.|`|yTAXDL5Jaa	Try the link:  http://www.lightplanet.com/mormons/youth...  so funny I am below my old self before I got zapped.

zrz4bcalaa	Yes, actually.  Wow, how I understand this.  Sometimes it is a way to do something that a person cannot do otherwise.  Although it can be perceived as selfish, it is more selfless.  It can be considered to be the ultimate act of love.    If one's purpose is defiance for a greater good for the other, or both, it is an amiable act.    By this, defiance is a good thing if it leads towards something that is needed; thus is both selfish and amiable.      From what I have seen, it can lead towards growth and a rekindling of a soft fire after it has been extinguished by water and mud.  It can be something lost in defiance so that it may be found later.  In this way, it is selfish and a good and necessary thing done out of unconditional love.|`|QM0Ezfvnaa	When you are too selfish to sacrifice your own values, diminish your own standards and give up your spiritual values . . . it is a GOOD thing.

1109d118ff574bed7bdc24c75a4c8705aa	I believe his belief system is seriously flawed, but he is sincere in his love for God and wants people to come to Christ. I do not believe he is a false-teacher, but there are elements of how Christianity was re-shaped by the Great Awakening that are strong deviations from Christianity's original model. For example, the faith handed down by the Apostles did not include the premise of "accepting Christ as personal Lord and Savior" in place of sacramental baptism and on the basis of a sales pitch. Evangelicalism is not based upon a covenant-based theological framework.|`|AA10826682	He's a thief like the other thieves.  He's been around longer, so he's more accepted.

yBb8tGtkaa	Antes de confeccionar la lista de invitados debemos saber dos cosas importantes: el tipo de boda que deseamos (ntima y familiar, o multitudinaria) y el presupuesto con el que contamos. Estos dos puntos sern los condicionantes para toda la organizacin de la boda.    La forma ms ordenada y pensamos, que ms adecuada de empezar con la lista de invitados, es que cada uno de los novios, escriba la lista de invitados de sus respectivas familias. Luego los amigos y compa?eros de trabajo.    Una vez hecho esto, cada uno con su parte, debern realizar la lista de los invitados comunes: amigos y compromisos.    Se unen estas dos listas, y se empieza la primera revisin. Se eliminan los posibles duplicados que existan, y se totaliza el nmero de invitados. Con el presupuesto que contamos, se debe comprobar si es posible invitar a todos ellos.    Como generalmente, no se puede invitar a todo el mundo que deseamos, empezamos a "cribar" la lista, quitando de la misma aquellos invitados que consideramos menos "importantes" para nosotros.    Podemos jugar con unos cuantos invitados de margen, contando con las posibles no asistencias y "excusas" de ltima hora. Lo mismo por el lado de los "apuntados" a ltima hora y compromisos. Aunque personalmente no nos parece correcto, hay novios que indican la no asistencia de ni?os al enlace.    La lista de invitados, se deber confeccionar con mucha antelacin, puesto que despus hay que basar la mayor parte de la organizacin en el nmero de asistentes (invitaciones de boda, cubiertos en el banquete, etc).    La lista nos debe servir como guin para ir marcando las personas a las que hemos dado o enviado la invitacin, as como para anotar cualquier tipo de incidencia que tenga que ver con los invitados.    Es conveniente que alguno de nuestros padres o familiar cercano repase la lista, para recordarnos los posibles olvidos, sobre todo en cuanto a la familia se refiere (siempre hay algn familiar del que podemos olvidarnos).|`|aQeOKasUaa	A tus buenos amigos y amigas, tu familia y las personas importantes y que valgan la pena estar presente en la boda (claro, no olvides los invitados por parte de la novia)|`|67f468d40feab09fdc81f9d661ac0cb6aa	La respuesta ms sencilla es a todos los que tengas ganas de invitar.  Pero como las cosas no suelen ser sencillas a ver:  jefes, si se los suele invitar en el lugar donde trabajs, y tens una buena relacin, sera importante hacerlo.  Compa?eros de trabajo, si te llevs bien s, sino...  no!  Siempre est la excusa de que no hay suficiente lugar.  Con los ex comparos de estudios pasa algo similar, en general suelen ser una cantidad imortante, y si no mantuvieron la relacin me parece que no da.  Familia que hace a?os que no ves:  salvo que te genere conflicto con tus padres por ejemplo no invitara.  Otro consejo, en general se suele invitar a tos lejanos para cumplir con la familia, pero no a los hijos.  Si son grandes claro, es mejor invitar a los hijos, habr ms animacin en el casamiento, los jvenes difrutan un montn este tipo de fiestas, y en cambio a los grandes les fastidia ir...  bueno siempre que no se ofendan, claro, pero en general van por compromiso.  Otra recomendacin:  invit o dej de invitar a todos lo que tengan el mismo grado de relacin:  por ejemplo si invits a primos segundos, tiene que ser a todos, lo mismo con compa?eros de trabajo, de estudios, vecinos, etc.  claro que si a un primo segundo lo ves todos los das y al resto hace diez a?os que no ves, est justificado invitar a uno s y a uno no, pero si estn todos en el mismo nivel es importante no hacer diferencias.  Suerte en tu casamiento|`|rc4W4iN7aa	a todo el que conozcas, adems te puedes exceder un poco de la cantidad que tengas contemplada porque siempre faltan otros.|`|f8c7dcd195c7748e1062333d8a2ca464aa	A nadie, todo el mundo viene a hacer criticas, no ha desearte lo mejor....yo invite a mis padres y los del novio|`|HIOMXIjBaa	a los tios ricos, seguramente|`|065adbd18aaa6e0a18e792b47cc98c1aaa	a mi!!! sobretodo si hay viejas buenas y piste|`|3b3020911a5d204e199a43df8a92a19eaa	yo pienso que a aquellos con los que realmente te vas a sentir comoda y no invitar compromisos.|`|d8f899e51a123ad384cf7b6f8b4c9ec9aa	Para elaborar una lista de invitados a una boda se debe evaluar todo ya que influyen muchas cosas.    No puedo decirte en concreto A QUIEN debes invitar ya que solo tu conoces las relaciones que tienes y el estado de la misma....    Pero hay una cosa "clave" en una fiesta de bodas y es que EL GASTO es inmenso as sea una "peque?isima" boda. Por este punto; te recomiendo que hagas de la lista de invitados una especie de "reunin de negocios"; en donde los invitados en vez de ocasionarte "gastos" sea una bendicin para ustedes como pareja.    Si vas a invertir US$ 1.000,00 deberas tomar en cuenta a personas quienes con sus aportes o regalos, pueda representar el triple de la inversin.    OJO: Siempre hay que invitar a los "intimos" as no tengan nada que darte... pero... como te dije antes, hay que evaluar todo y ser consciente pues, en un inicio de matrimonio es muy recomendable TENER ESTABILIDAD en las finanzas y tener lo mnimo requerido de equipamiento en el hogar.    Bendiciones para vuestra linda unin !!!

56AP4OEGaa	Yes, it sounds like as a parent God gave up on Lucifer.  The strange thing is how a perfect God can have an evil son as his offspring.  Wouldn't good reproduce good?  Was there some evil then originally in God?|`|RRpvR80Aaa	If I am in my own home with my family, and a gang of thugs from the neighborhood, with the head thug in the lead, were to attack my home with guns blazing, and seek to kill not only me but my entire family...do you honestly think I would or you would demand they stop immediately and try to put them all in time out?    Someone tries to do so to me or mine on this Earth in this day or time. I can promise you that I will not sit calmly through the attempted death and destruction of my home & my family. They will not leave unscathed, I can promise you that.    I think God Almighty was TOO extremely lenient. He should have vaporized them ALL on the spot.    But God knowing the beginning and the end, whereas I do not, has a perfect plan, a plan we can only see a piece of it at a given time, but He HAS a plan...and He unlike me is perfect and so to is His plan.|`|bdfa59d7b07a9f8d87b377a23b2a1873aa	It is a mystery. Faith with all the answers is not faith. My guess is God wants us to make that leap of faith.     No one can fathom the wisdom of God. Here is what the Catechism of the Catholic Church says about your question.    In our trials God does seem to be absent and powerless. However. God's power is fully revealed in the death and Resurrection of Jesus. "For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men" (1 Cor 1:24-25). In Jesus' death and Resurrection, God has revealed the "immeasurable greatness of his power in us who believe" (Eph 1:19-22).    Only faith can embrace these mysterious ways of God's power. Mary believed the angel's words that "nothing will be impossible with God" (Lk 1:37) and she proclaimed that "he who is mighty has done great things for me" (Lk 1:49). Knowing that nothing is impossible for God, we can accept everything in the Creed without any hesitation.    Peace and blessings!|`|60e5cb843bb6487d500ee715c0a8a09caa	In order to believe God is omnipotent you have to believe in him.|`|fa149a85977db316dcf09012f49507b1aa	Why create him in the first place if he knew what would happen?

I'll be interested to see your reaction to absolute purity...  Jim|`|070c89de76218ede5bdaea6729d48b3daa	Yeah, well, God also could have forgiven mankind of "original sin" by just snapping his fingers and making it so. He didn't need to sacrifice Jesus at all.     I tell ya. If the Bible were being presented as a novel to a publisher today, it would get rejected because of all the plot holes and inconsistencies.

1pFcDyeDaa	Your feelings are translated into lust, so the answer is "no."  Not if you consider yourself a believer.      Yehudi|`|4qNYNG41aa	First of all yes you can, and you can have a loving gay relationship.  I am a bi sexual Christian and I find no conflict with my faith what so ever.  The churches(especially catholics,no offense catholics)warped teachings over the years and the bible are totally separate.  You may ask how I am a Christian but most modern churches accept homosexuals and realise, even if they cannot say it outwardly, that there is nothing wrong with it.   Modern scholars accept that there are gay relationships int he bible here are the three:  Ruth and Naomi,David and Jonathan,Daniel and Ashpenaz.  Your church may say that they were not gay but almost every renowned scholar and biblical translator in the world accepts they were so.  Sodom and Gomorrah actually relates to Rape, and immoral activities.  Loving gay relationship is not one of those.  Look up these web sits:www.religioustolerance.org/hom_bmar...  www.gay-christadelphians-a-response.co...  www.ambs.edu/Ljohns/Homosexuality.htm.  To lay with a man as with a woman is a direct reference to anal sex.  Take it this way anal sex was disouraged for the isrealites because it was associated with the idolatry of the canaanites.  We are not doing it out of paganism.  It also says do not clip your bead ect, these were old testament laws to stop the isrealites straying or imitating the canaanites, and as we are not pagans they have no need for us to apply them.  Also you can use the argue of creating babies to say being gay is wrong because god makes some straight women barren.  Homosexuals are barren in a sense that having babies is not natural for them.  It is not a curse god made us this way, think of all the orphans we can foster!,lol.  The church has often mis interpreted things, and homosexuality is one of them.  What you have to remember also is that for a long time the church and government were completely fused not separate like today,  So mans rules where absorbed into the churches as a medium of controlling people,  Look up what the modern day scholars have to say, and don' be put off by brain washing in the church, or old misguided ideas.  Find a good church where they don't twist things, and examines their scripture properly.  God made you the way you are, do not change.|`|usfVqbajaa	call me and we can discuss it in private    as long as you're cute|`|4Zbjx8bCaa	Yeah. I think we all do, we're supposedly bisexual to a certain extent. Otherwise how can we feel others are masculine or more masculine or feminine or less feminine.    If you suppress them it will be worse.|`|GuTUQpSpaa	I keep mine in a jar on the desk.|`|TkMud2pHaa	Why were you decrying Catholics with your last question and now you use their language to describe Mary?    Off your meds today?    And only you know if you CAN have homosexual feelings.  I really don't know if you can or not.  I personally do not think I can.|`|871ea50d251ea84b03eb405148721ecbaa	If a man can be found to sin by thinking of his brothers wife in a lustful way then I feel the christian god will not forgive.    Personally as an Atheist freethinker, I believe you should follow your heart and feelings and do what ever makes you happy and don't live life today based on a bronze age philosophy.    free yourself from the Matrix|`|macZI2dzaa	Truth is many people have homosexual feelings.  And, you are correct in noting that the Bible condemns anal intercourse not the feelings of homosexuality.   God would not be good if He did not condemn anal intercourse, because it always injures and exposes both partners to chronic, contagious and deadly diseases.  Those that encourage anal intercourse must hate homosexuals.  Not sure how my view demonstrates anything but love, Dr Jaz.    For God, who created everything with mere words... I think it is not a problem for Him to give any animal the ability to speak.      Oh, and the Bible does not condemn 'reason'.  The Bible does recognize the limits of reason.  Dr Jaz, don't be bitter, be better.|`|ttTDiJWfaa	Of course you can have your feelings.    The bible also "condemns" reason. Chastity is in fact a perversion  as it is based on irrational psychology.       What a dark world we live in when our rational psyche has been emasculated by the whip of religious conformity!    For example:  Paul M:  "God would not be good if He did not condemn anal intercourse, because it always injures and exposes both partners to chronic, contagious and deadly diseases."    God would not be GOOD? What the hell kind of hateful rhetoric is that?    Heaven Bound"You are allowing satan to fill your mind with unrighteous thoughts."    And is the talking snake in bible true too? What vulgar pride you take in verbally absuing this girl!|`|BQ6WmoHiaa	You are correct.    God bless you.|`|TyRfv0eoaa	Homosexual feelings are not condemned. Neither are homosexual acts in a committed relationship (aka marriage), if you read scripture in the original languages. Celibacy isn't an option for most people, but for those who can, well, go for it if you want.|`|UujliMsCaa	Yep.    However, it also depends on what you call "feelings". The bible calls lust wrong - it doesn't matter if it's homo or hetero. So to have feelings as in lustful feelings it'd be wrong. Other than that, you're good to go.|`|vVmia1w3aa	Remember the 10 commandments Ms. Christian.    You shall not covet your neighbours house; you shall not covet your neighbours wife, or male or female slave, or ox, or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbour.|`|kTaa8ejpaa	You sin when you follow up on your temptations.  Satan tempts everyone in one way or another.  No one is immune.  Some people just give in because it sounds like fun.....they have such "burning" desire.|`|Wt398Yueaa	If you feel something and try not to feel it then the feeling will not go away. The feeling will go underground make you neurotic.     The feeling is OK!     Nature - or God - has made people about 5% homosexual and 95% heterosexual.

Don't let guilt stop you from enjoying life to the fullest. Just be yourself.|`|564d359090a6d360bec9ee3849107a51aa	Those feeling are just as condemned by God as the act. You are allowing satan to fill your mind with unrighteous thoughts.     Ephesians 6:11 Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.    Ephesians 13-17 Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.     14 Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;     No one can penetrate God's truth with the lies of satan.    This breastplate protects your heart from falling away from God and protects it from evil.    15 And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;    Your feet being shod keeps your steps in the same path of the Lord.     16 Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.    This shield of faith make is possible to stand up to the lies and attacks on you by the devil.     17 And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:     The helmet of salvation keeps impure and unrighteous thoughts from entering in to your mind.|`|zBkaqIWcaa	Can? Yes.  Should? No!!!|`|AA10401179	No, is it OK for a person to have feelings towards the wife of his neighbour?    Feelings do not mean it's right. We all have sexual thoughts, but the Lord says, "Whoever even looks at a woman, and deems to possess her, has already committed adultery with her in his heart."    I have feelings too, but that's not love. I am waiting for the right one.|`|d265DZbHaa	Forget the bible, it is just a book of nonsense. Homosexuality is as natural as heterosexuality. By nature we are bisexual, this is because we can respond to both sexes. We are socialised into being het or homo. Some though, are in contact with our real self. Just thinking about it is just contacting that real self.|`|FhHklqkhaa	"homosexual" was a term coined in 1869 so it can't be a sin or in the bible

The water varies from place to place, so that might efect the taste. Also, cosmic rays reach the earth are differing anlges, depending upon the time zone, and i've heard this effects brewing . . .    Supposedly the best coffee in the world is served in Yemen or Malaysia, but I'm not sure they have a Starbucks (yet).|`|AA10726551	To me its the same everywhere-nasty!

Most men don't want their "privates" about to jump out and most women are embarrassed by it. It is almost as bad as a woman's skirt getting stuck in her panties, or tolit paper stuck on her heel and her walking around like that.   People do snicker behind others backs before the object of the laughter is known.  Girls snicker at the guys zippers down, as guys snicker at the girls shirts hiked up.

Matthew 7: 15-19.  True worshippers are no part of the world, are not divided by race or culture and they would have love among themselves (John 13:35 and John 17:16).  All true worshippers would be united in the same line of thought (1 Corinthians 1:10).  Instead of teaching traditions or doctrines of men, the true religion bases its doctrine on the God's Word the Bible. (Matthew 15:6-9).  The Bible is God's inspired Word because, "all scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight." (1 Timothy 3:16)  Also, those taking the lead would have high moral standards.  Isaiah 43:10 tells us, "You are my witnesses is the utterance of Jehovah, even my servant whom I have chosen."  The international brotherhood of Jehovah's Witnesses not only bear the name of the true God, but they are living up to their name by helping others to live by the Bible's standards in more than 235 countries.|`|93fc57ca1c692acd2bd8f1bc7a446e6eaa	A foundation of apostles and prophets, with Jesus Christ being the chief cornerstone.

There's a purpose behind it.  It could be there is another energy drawing you out and the only way to do it is during this state.  Sounds like quite the adventure, just be cautious, as I'm sure you're aware of being already.  There is a theory about coyote spirits.  They can seduce the spirit to venture too far and keep it distracted long enought for another spirit to enter the body (thus split or multiple personality disorders).

And on father's day my dad was in texas he was planning to come out to ca the same year, I had missed him greatly and wanted to spend father's day with my dad...and I did, I don't know how I did it but I did..This is what happened..He got off the bus, and I ran up to him and he had gotten so skinny and I wrapped my arms around him, and my ghosh you have gotten so skinny  and I held him tight..It was all is slow motion everything was..It was such a great feeling to spend fathers day with him, I called him the next day and told him we spent fathers day together..He acted not surprised like he had already knew it..When he did come out, he was very frail and skinny..am not sure if that is what happened to me or not, and I held on to it ever since..My husband has had them experiences before..Blessings to all

I did not understand alot of things and no one could hardly give me the answers that I was seeking.  I know that there was someone higher than man, but I wanted to know more than what my grand mother and mother was telling me.  So I decided to seek for myself.  I know there was a reason and purpose for life and that I had to find mines.  I began researching and praying, so I know if there is a God He will answer me.  I was very humble in my asking, and I found answers to most of my questions.  As the years passed, I got more and more of my questions answered.  It was amazing!  Now, no one can tell me that there isn't a real God and that He doesn't speak.  In Jeremiah 33:3 "Call upon me and I will show you great and mighty things that you know not."  I came to believe that passage of scripture, because it worked.  I hope that you find what you are looking for and in whatever you do, remember that you parents love you and want what is best for you.  It might not be right to you at the present, but they are doing the best they can.  Respect that.

And he will be upheld, for the Lord is able to make him stand.  5  One person esteems one day as better than another, while another esteems all days alike. Each one should be fully convinced in his own mind.  6  The one who observes the day, observes it in honor of the Lord.

30ae8d0ad22d3c3688372363a60305dbaa	Salmo 115:4-8 dice:"?4?Los dolos de ellos son plata y oro,  la obra de las manos del hombre terrestre.    ?5?Boca tienen, pero no pueden hablar;  ojos tienen, pero no pueden ver;  ?6?odos tienen, pero no pueden or.  Nariz tienen, pero no pueden oler.    ?7?Manos son suyas, pero no pueden palpar.  Pies son suyos, pero no pueden andar;  no profieren sonido con su garganta.    ?8?Quienes los hacen llegarn a ser lo mismo que ellos,  todos los que confan en ellos"    . Por tanto, es obvio que cualquier empleo directamente relacionado con la produccin de objetos de culto, entre ellos las banderas nacionales, sera inaceptable para los siervos de Jehov , igualmente tenemos una actitud de respeto ante himnos y banderas, mira ,soy maestra y en la escuela ,en los actos patrios tomo una actitud de respeto pero no participo ni del himno ni de la ceremonia de la bandera.  El esclavo del Se?or no?tiene necesidad de pelear escribi el apstol Pablo, sino de ser amable para con todos. (2?Timoteo 2:24.) En?armona con estas palabras, los cristianos se esfuerzan por ser pacficos, respetuosos y amables, pero, a la vez, se dejan guiar por su conciencia educada por la Biblia al tomar decisiones relativas a saludar la bandera y entonar el himno nacional.    VUELVO A PEDIRTE DISCULPAS POR LA RESPUESTA A LA PREGUNTA ANTERIOR.|`|aDIoiEjLaa	No es correcto. Ellos lo creen debido a un fundamentalismo bblico completamente irracional, y nada ms.

En fin, mientras dejen de molestar en mi casa que hagan lo que quieran y que adoren a quien quieran, mi dios no exige tantas cosas absurdas como el no ir al doctor cuando me siento mal, el me dice "ayudate que yo te ayudare", mientras yo seguire haciendo honores a mi pais Mxico lindo y querido!.|`|48c27c06ce8feb95486bbda98f221e55aa	Porque quieren hacerse los raritos...|`|1233f4d002e11416eeca15d9896ad2a2aa	emmm  quiza porque ellos entienden que la religion no tiene nada que ver con politica y esas cosas|`|4c308dd3e7765f431f77809120ab0a47aa	porque ellos solo le brindan honor a Dios|`|1420855f897686481e57ac5631cb60b6aa	No lo es, si quieren no ser ciudadanos que se salgan del pas o que dejen de usar la luz, agua, drenaje y calles que les da el gobierno que pretenden negar.

Despus de izada la bandera, el ministro gral. del ejercito. Tistao de Alencar Araripe se expreso de esta manera acerca de la conmemoracin:" Las banderas han llegado a ser una divinidad de religin patritica que impone adoracin. La bandera recibe veneracin y adoracin . La bandera es adorada as como se adora a la patria".  Siguiendo el ejemplo de Jess que dijo: Esta escrito "es a Jehov tu Dios que tienes que adorar , y es a el solo que tienes que rendir servicio sagrado" Debera un cristiano verdadero exponerse a tal sentimiento patritico y estar dispuesto a morir por su bandera y su patria y seguir rindiendo adoracin exclusiva a Dios sin violar las palabras de Jess?. No lo creo, por eso aunque los T.J.respetamos estos smbolos no los veneramos.|`|1350355cd14e2cd54638de9bc2eefe80aa	Adoran a algo que no existe,pero,no muestran respeto por algo que todos ven porque es real y no ficticio como dios.

Eso de que no mostramos respeto a los simbolos de una nacin, es una tontera. ?Cuando han visto a un Testigo de Jehov quemando, escupiendo o pisoteando una bandera?  ?Han escuchado que cambiemos de forma burlona un himno nacional? En las ceremonias civicas estamos simpre en una posicin respetuosa, (incluso ms aun de lo que lo estn los que s rinden honores). Una cosa es el respeto, y otra muy diferente es "RENDIR CULTO"(1) a un simbolo nacional. ?De verdad es tn dificil entender la diferencia?    La Comisin Nacional de Derechos Humanos escribe al respecto:  "Por ello deben ense?ar a los alumnos los valores de la tolerancia y la convivencia, partiendo del derecho a la diferencia y del respeto que se debe tener a la dignidad de los individuos. La diferencia que plantea el credo de los alumnos testigos de Jehov, debe ser respetada por toda la comunidad escolar, porque en la medida en que sus miembros acepten y comprendan al otro, los centros educativos del pas formarn individuos preparados para insertarse en una sociedad plural y cambiante, que debe tener como valor principal el respeto a la dignidad humana. Los criterios que rigen la educacin que imparte el Estado no pueden desarrollarse en un entorno en donde se discrimina y se sanciona a los individuos por sus creencias religiosas. Ello no es obstculo para que el personal docente cumpla con el deber de ense?ar a los alumnos testigos de Jehov el aprecio por la historia, los smbolos patrios y las instituciones nacionales. De igual forma, se debe explicar a los educandos que por cuestiones de sus creencias religiosas los compa?eros que pertenecen a la Congregacin Cristiana de los Testigos de Jehov no participarn activamente en la ceremonia para rendir honores a los smbolos patrios; sin embargo, estarn presentes en la misma con una actitud pasiva y guardando respeto.

El ejemplo ms cercano a esto son mis padres, ambos fueron convertidos gracias a la obra de predicar.    Quieres saber cual es nuestra idea acerca de la predicacin y por que visitamos a las personas, ok, te voy a mostrar un texto bblico que creo te lo va a dejar claro.    (Ezaquiel 3:18) Cuando yo diga a alguien inicuo: Positivamente morirs, y t realmente no le adviertas y hables para advertir al inicuo de su camino inicuo para conservarlo vivo, por ser l inicuo, en su error morir, pero su sangre la reclamar de tu propia mano. 19 Pero en cuanto a ti, en caso de que hayas advertido a alguien inicuo y l realmente no se vuelva de su iniquidad y de su camino inicuo, l mismo por su error morir; pero en cuanto a ti, habrs librado tu propia alma.    Lee Sofonias 1:14-18....    Como ves, en la obra de predicar no esta solamente en juego el querer salvar a las personas, sino tambin salvarnos a nosotros mismo, es por esto que seguimos predicando y advirtiendo pese a que la gente no nos escuche, esto ultimo es lo que menos nos interesa, lo primero es nuestra relacin personal con Dios, y cumplir su mandamiento de dar advertencia.    Los ignorantes que dijeron que creemos que solo se salvan 144.000 estn muy equivocados, deberan informarse ms antes de opinar acerca de nosotros.    Riko, Nmesis no es testigo de Jehov, ella solo es una muy buena amiga, de la tribu de Gabaon, por lo tanto no corre bajo las mismas leyes que los Testigos y esta en todo su derecho de mandar al cuerno a quien le plazca....    En cuanto al termino Secta, segn lo que dice la Real academia espa?ola, al modo de ver de los Testigos de Jehov la iglesia catlica es la SECTA MAS GRANDE DE TODOS LOS TIEMPOS, y la mas peligrosa por el veneno que desparrama, junto con su fornicacin con la poltica.      secta.    (Del lat. secta).      1. f. Conjunto de seguidores de una parcialidad religiosa o ideolgica.    2. f. Doctrina religiosa o ideolgica que se diferencia e independiza de otra.    3. f.

Todos los a?os, ms de 6,5 millones de "publicadores" -como se denominan los TJ- (entre bautizados y no bautizados en este movimiento), realizan alrededor de 6,0 millones de estudios de la "Biblia" (conversaciones basadas en los libros publicados por la Soc. Watchtower). De este grupo de simpatizantes alrededor de 250.000 se bautizan todos los a?os.    ?Cul es el ratio de eficiencia (medido como N de estudios versus N de bautizados)? = 0,04    En base a esto ?cuntos a?os tomar bautizar a todos los estudios? = 24 a?os (N bautizados anuales/N estudios anuales)    Por otra parte, todos los a?os un nmero similar de personas bautizadas por los TJ (250.000) son excomulgadas o expulsadas de los TJ todos los a?os.    Tantos entran como salen...

As for the toxic, heavy metals in people's systems now, it was conclusively proven several years ago that it was because of the various types of insecticides and herbicides used in addition with fertilizer that heavy metal poisonings were so highly indicated in blood samples taken from people who used them. There is alot of speculation that Parkinson's Disease is a direct result of these factors. Actor Michael J Fox said in an interview that his system was polluted with toxic, heavy metals, and the doctors told him there was a causal link between his illness and use of fertilizer and insecticides and herbicides which, by the way, MAN created in laboratories. A strike against science and chemistry, I guess.

Reading further, he states:    "And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry; Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief. And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus."  1 Tim 1:12-14 KJV    God's Law even tamed the worst of sinners, as Paul proclaims himself as "chief" (1 Tim 1:15 KJV).  Paul considered his former self amongst the "lawbreakers."    Now, he's the ambassador for Jesus Christ!|`|5hh6sVg5aa	I'm not sure for what you seek to know from this scripture, but here is my take on it - a lot of people look to distinct verses for searches in meanings, but I like to look at the full chapter or section to get a feel for from where the writer/ speaker was coming.  The start of 1 Timothy 1, the writer is urging the readers of the letter against false teachers of the law. After giving the warning, he states that the law is good if used properly (verse 8). Then it goes on to the excerpt you put in. To help with this excerpt - think of it in terms of a sick/ ill person and doctor - you don't reguarly need that doctor unless you are coming in for preventative/ check ups or if you are sick. The verse is stating that people who are spiritually sick/ ill need the law as a basis of showing that they, like everyone, are in deed sick. If you read on through verse 17, the writer goes on to say that he too was sick, but through the grace of God/ faith and love of Jesus - he is able to bring the message. He states, starting at verse 15, "Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinnersof whom I am the worst. But for that very reason I was shown mercy so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might display his unlimited patience as an example for those who would believe on him and receive eternal life." I hope this helps.

You are being of such with this or we are being of chopping off your heads!|`|IqtzkgyBaa	The difference is the languages of arabic, orginal ancient arabic is Muhammad - White Arabs rule their since historical Jesus of 2000 yrs     The Muhammad of 1300 yrs ago was White prophet both Jesus and Muhammad is a prototype of one coming at end of time Messiah, Christ , In Muslim world "Mahdi" Allah in person not a spook ! Human being with SUPREME INTELLIGENCE and POWER, a GOD SCIENTIST.     Honorable elijah Muhammad through Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan teach us WHO IS GOD?"  We all talk about Him, certainly we love Him and we bear witness that He is the Greatest. We live in His Universe. There is nothing to compare with it, so there is nothing to compare with Him. The Scholars of the world of religion-- Jews, Christians, Muslims, whatever your religious persuasion may be-- we have to know today Who God is that we not make a mistake and serve other than Him.  The Bible teaches us that God made man in His own image and His own likeness. It teaches us that He breathes, sorrows, sees and hears, loves and hates.  What about the Holy Qur'an? The Holy Qur'an uses the personal pronoun "I". The "I" belongs to whom? It uses the soft pronoun "We". Does God have associates? Does He have partners? Why say "We"? God Himself revealed the book and knows best the language. Why did He use the language of a human being? Who is God? The Attributes in the Holy Qur'an are not the Attributes of a Spirit, they are the Attributes of man in whom the Spirit dwells. Allah is the Beneficent, the Merciful, the Powerful, the Life-Giver, the Sustainer, the Securer.    In Bible call them 24 ELDERS and Holy Quran call them EXALTED CHIEFS or ANGELIC BEINGS. These are SUPREME SCIENTIST(GODS) or GOD SCIENTISTS , One of them is MOST SUPREME, BEST KNOWER call ALLAH - His wisdom is ETERNAL and (He) have many names (HE) go by, of worlds religion.     They All have WIVES  is powerful and pass their wisdom down to their CHILDRENS, the woman is the key to Kingdom of Heaven or Very High Supreme Advance Civilization will be on Earth and Universe.  There cannot be a new world except that there is a new and better understanding of the female, which will give us (men) a clearer understanding of self and above all, a clearer understanding of (God). In the Bible, (God) declares, Behold I make all things new.    Since, the (womb) of our mother is sacred,  woman contains the secret of GOD because she carries life in her womb barewitness  HIS OWN SELF CREATION or CREATED HIMSELF FIRST, she is SECOND SELF OF GOD. Then, this teaches us that the womb of every female is also sacred, for it is from her womb that all the Scientists, Prophets, Sages, Messengers, Kings, Rulers and Gods have come and will come.     They life span up to 500- some nearly 1500 yrs Bible teach us when GOD comes end of the world, HE will prolong people lives,  they all have powers, control force of nature, very advance in technology and other fields of knowledge, they are REAL POWER behid Universe, they are not aliens green and gray, thats all frabrication because bias, racism, greed, commercializing. They are Human Beings with Very Supreme Intelligence and they wisdom so superior far beyond then this world wisdom and they look like us, they just Very Highly Supreme Intelligence and Power and Very Highly Spiritual (holy).They come in varieties of race(human beings) Originators of Heavens and Earth are Asiactic Black SUPREME SCIENTISTS(GOD) or GOD Scientists !     They are same one's wrote or AUTHOR or ORIGINATORS of Bible and Quran other sacred books of the world.    How do the twenty-four (24) elders square with "Us" in the Bible and "We" in the Holy Qur'an? Who is the "us" and who is the "we"? Since God is One and has no associates or partners, who is "we"?   Th (24) wise  (scientists) who do the work of producing Bible and Qur'an.  They make History {or Bible or Qur'an} to equal the circumference of our home (Earth): one year for each mile. So the book that is written contains twenty-five thousand (25,000) years of history written in advance. They are different level Angels- people whom GOD use choose to help others not prohets etc., priest, psychic, sage, prophets, messagers.    There are twelve (12) major scientists and twelve (12) minor scientists that include &  7 ANGELS or  7 COUNCSEL, GOD SCIENTISTS and more . Back to the Number 12 again. Whenever the time comes for a certain part of the writing to be fulfilled, one of the major scientists will speak to someone among the people. He will reveal to that person a part of the writing (scripture) and give him an assignment or mission.    The original arabians and whole middle were Asiactic Black People  Muhammd means one worthy of praise, Jesus is Muhammd because meaning and Muhammad is Christ of meaning

They are real, we will all see this one day, the truth.  There is a trinity ( the Father, the Son, and The Holy Spirit)  Jesus was God in man, completely God in man form, born by the HOLY SPIRIT through the virgin Mary's womb.  This was the Holy Spirit.  The Holy spirit is God's love, it brings God to this world and it inspired those who wrote the bible, it inspires love, it inspires truth.  There is evil floating around this world, do you think there would not too be the Holy Spirit as well?|`|yugLcDE2aa	Not nonsense at all... but the infallible word of truth... it is hidden or "veiled" to those who do not believe..    "3 But even if my gospel, too, is "veiled," it is among those who are on the way to perish that it is "veiled." Among them the god of this age has blinded the understanding of the unbelieving so that the sunshine of the gospel of God, should not dawn upon them. It is not myself that I proclaim, but Christ Jesus as Master, and myself that I proclaim, and myself your slave for Jesus sake.  2 Cor 4:3-5     18 Are your minds so slow to comprehend?

A Carpents son, who had some brilliant ideas  He never said that he was the "Son of God", and denied it.    The Romans killed Him because he was a political pest at the time.    So much for the Roman Catholic Church then, and their crucifixes !    Bob|`|Gt5JzC2Daa	In Arthurian myth Merlin's mother is also considered to a virgin (steps had to be taken to enable her to give birth). However some arthurian myths do give details of how he was conceived that fit with modern possibilities  Wont go into too much detail, on a board such as this which might have minors hanging around, other than to say it looks very much like AI combined with a ritual, so nobody would know for certain who Merlin's physical father was. As everyone has/had to have a father, he was treated/considered as being "fathered" by A God    Jesus a God? Well strictly speaking the Son of a God, is the same thing as what the ancient greeks called a hero/demigod. (Hercules/ Achilles etc are ALL the same catagory of entity that is a human/deity hybrid as Jesus, and so too seem to be the nephelim from Biblical apocrypha, offspring of the Grigori and humans)    Inspiration comes from somewhere, and "from God" is as good an explanation as any-other.

"in the way," from ob "against" + viam, acc. of via "way." Meaning "plain to see, evident" is first recorded 1635    The overwhelming majority of the West has so believed.

You don't read the Bible to find what you believe - you read the Bible and believe what you find. If you try to wrap your mind around God and understand Him intellectually, you will be lost, because you will have reduced God to a human level, who would not be worth worshipping. The question is not, "Do you understand God?" but "Do you TRUST Him?"  When I was a kid, I had no idea about the technicalities of what my father did for a living, but I knew that he was my father and that he loved me, and I loved him and trusted him. We need to have that same faith when it comes to God.|`|5HbQ6Pwiaa	Jesus IS  GOD!!!! NOT JUST A GOD. What nonsense are you referring to?? What nonsense did you read from the Bible?
