Notice, how the news stories, all contain the fact that yet, another rocket, launched from Gaza hit Israel.  But? Since Israel, did nothing, each news agency, felt the need to remind everyone, that in the recent 'war' 1,300 people were killed in Gaza (of course they totally omit the number of these, who were Hamas militants) but then point out that 10 Israeli soldiers were killed in Israel during that time. (Completely omitting the 3 civilians killed in that same time)  Why does the news, take such comfort in this?  How come each of these news agencies, totally omit, the total number of Jew children, killed by the suicide bomb attacks over the last 13 years?  What can they hope to accomplish, by presenting such a pro Muslim/Arab report?|`|2ftcbluqaa	Who are you talking about??|`|I5LngQcFaa	The recent war on Gaza, it has turned 180 degree on Israeli policy, because of the propaganda of the media agencies, one of them is Aljazeera channel it has dominated, public opinions. But why the world didnt ask why Israel attacked Gaza the question has remained silent till the present day .  Apparently this has hindered the peace process in Middle East, the reason is Hamas , UN including Arabian League should eliminate Hamas from the zone.|`|C1y4sOfFaa	who?

Would there?|`|2bf7b1928da0ba8574b96d3c8eb7ff68aa	Bush used them in IRAQ...they are illegal|`|3734b5f7e7c27b91d0268c00d9e7ed41aa	You know, I think the elephant standing in the middle of the room, when it comes to the whole "Israel targeted civilians" camp...is this...  If Israel, with it's superior war machinery, was in the business, of deliberately targeting civilians in Gaza, then there would not be any civilians in Gaza.  As it stands, they dropped tons of munitions on Gaza, and the total dead was like 1,000?  There are 4 million people supposedly there, and only 1,000 died?    Of course, we do not hear anything, of the 'war crimes' of Hamas, in the rocket attacks, and the previous onslaught, of suicide bomb attacks, most of the victims, (like 98 percent) were civilians.  he total dead of these attacks, is more than the 1,000 killed in the recent conflict.  So, where are the charges of 'war crimes' against Hamas, and the people of Gaza?  With out a charge against the war crimes of Hamas, any attempt to speak such words against Israel, are entirely inflammatory, and political.  The argument becomes moot.      If you notice, ever since the news changed their focus, from giving attention to the region (which only seems to happen, when Israel defends itself) the drama regarding this topic, has strangely evaporated from this forum.    Apparently, many people here, have there main topics of concern, fed to them from the news media.|`|J9RuKMPXaa	The REAL problem are racism and Zionism. If Palestinians had used white phosphorous in Israel and ONE Israeli family had been hurt, American media would have called it a dastardly or barbaric act, pictures of victims would have been flashed across TV and newspapers, and throngs of Muslims would have been made to apologize and condemn the act. But because the victims in this case were Muslims, people of color,and the perpetrators were white Zionists, it's nothing.    EDIT:  Widget Maker: It can be argued that Israel is committing genocide in slow motion. How many Arabs have they killed during the last 60 years? And how do you explain the fact that Jewish lobbies have gone out of their way to declare the civil war in Darfur as a "genocide?"|`|i7oHTo9haa	Gaza is an urban war of which those people refuse to disarm but wage a war on Israel and the rest of Western society. They use phosporous and so do the rest of NATO and ARAB armies. Any war is rough of course there are going to be casualties since Hamas doesn't wear uniforms but fights in urban areas not open fields and isn't going to surrender. When allied forces defeated Hitler's army nobody fainted at the first 1,000 deaths because it was what was necessary to defeat Hitler, you go on and on until the enemy is actually defeated or surrenders no matter how many deaths ensue. There is no top end on civilian casualties.  That is war and that is what international law supports as rules of war. Germany had 1.5 MILLION civilian deaths and just look at the casualties for the rest of the war, it is STAGGERING.     Hamas and the Islamofascists have NO intention of giving up their cause they literally called Blair stupid for thinking they'd sign a peace deal.  We didn't hold back when we defeated Hitler because we knew the old German society had allowed that Nazi regime to grow they supported it. Millions of people died and that needs to be the focus here that because people died the rest of us were able to live freely.    These Palestinians are not innocents. They voted them in and there are about a billion more Muslims that support them.  So think about how one values Western life and defends the freedoms of it.  The Hamas and these Islamofascists want nothing more than to take over Western domain, and first starting with Israel.  Churchill knew back then Hitler was an issue, nobody called him a fool. Afterwards.  Chamberlain who every hailed as a hero by making a land for peace deal with Hitler turned out to be the real fool.    German society wasn't innocent back then for bringing Hitler to power and neither are the Palestinians for bringing in Hamas.  They are a very VIOLENT society, look at the facts.    77.69% of the Palestinian men and women voted in Hamas who's purpose is to destroy Israel, Europe and the Americas. The highest votes cast were from Gaza strip, with Rafah precinct having an 89% voter turnout.    84% of the Palestinians support violence on innocent civilians (Yeshiva Massacre, 9/11) and danced in their streets after both events.    94% of Palestinian children have been victims of domestic violence in their own homes by their own family members.

Actually, they are trying to force Israel out, who was indigenous and had settlements there throughout time. Everyone got their modern nation state with their corresponding capitals and these Palestinians are actually Syrians. Syria birthed the PLO.  ----------  Edit to Michael: Ahem, actually the Hamas does have anti-aircraft cannons and anti-tank shells, they have all kinds of weapons.

But that all changed when a state had to be formed, this whole bull sh*t is all Israel's fault. Your 72 and you were alive when this all happened and these dip sh*ts on here who just point Hamas did this and Hamas did that, don't really know what is going on in Israel and do not know what they did to get a state, they took people from their homes, forced them out to other neighboring countries, or put them in large refugee camps for them to keep out of their pure jewish facist state. All they see in the Palestinians people is colateral damage that need to be wiped out. They have no sensitivity whatsoever. And to that person who said 1,000 out of 4,000,000.

I think they just got lazy.|`|BMEdL7lzaa	Hi,    The Mayans marked the year 2012 as the end of their CALENDAR not the end of the world. People have been looking for the end of the world to happen since it began, these predictions, all of them since the first one, which predates even the birth of Christ considerably, are merely humans attempt to deal with the concept of something that will exist beyond them because they are mortal. Another reason is merely extortion, there was one major occurance in medieval times when the Catholic Church announced an end date merely to cause peasants to donate what little wealth and assets they had in hopes of getting into the Kingdom of Heaven. Now in modern times we move to science for answers because we are slowly realizing that religion of any form or creed does not provide us with the answers we seek, so in essence science is becoming our new God, so needless to say we look to science for answers for everything including a date and time when the world ends. Unfortunatly however, as with any new mass movment in a cultured society, much ignorance is combined with what few facts we do have thus spreading mass rumor and in some cases, panic. The media, of course, milking it for all it is worth and selling it while it sells...that is why we are seeing increased programs on T.V. about doomsday scenarios, because thats the mindset of people right now, once 2012 blows over they will merely set the "End Date" back a few more years after all, werent we supposed to be royally doomed on the year 2000? So dont worry, if the world does end within the next 1,000 years, it will all be because of something humans did to themselves not some asteroid, or supernatural being, or outer space anomally we cannot control. In essence all I am saying is think about humans, humanity, even yourself, did'nt it used to be "The End" of the world when your mother would leave the room for a few moments when you were a child?

bJnqYE6maa	Not much different in terms of commerce.  It would enable space tourism for the very rich and elite.  Just a diversion.  Until the first accident happened.  Then litigation would probably ruin it for everyone.  I don't think it could be long term proposition once the novelty wore off.  You eliminated the discussion of hyperspeed, so going to other planets in the solar system is not practical.  So, it would seem this would get very boring and flop pretty quick, unless you decided to take a jaunt to the moon and back.  How about casino cruises to the moon?    Now, countries might use the opportunity to conduct covert spy or military operations using the cover of private companies.  Somebody could put a nuclear weapon on a space plane under the pretext of tourism, or maybe a telescope or a listening post.    Terrorism?  Imagine being able to hijack a space plane and crash it into the Congress or White House at 25000 miles per hour.  The impact would be devastating.

You might be expecting an answer such as... "it started when Israel took land". Get over it, Israel belongs there and the Arabs belong in Arab countries such as Syria, Iraq, Iran and so on. But there is no such thing as a Palestinian State, Rome decided to give the name Palestine to what is known as Judea in an attempt to erase everything related to the Jewish State of Israel this happened when the Romans destroyed the last Temple that stood where now there is a Mosque.

First of all, awesome cause, I'm currently trying to create an Invisible Children Club myself.     -I think you should start by getting to know the paper work your school requires (every school is different). Maybe talk to a counselor or someone in the activities department that can guide you with the requirements.    -Most school clubs and organizations require a mentor or advisor (any teacher or staff). Think of possible candidates for this position and ask them if they are interested.    -Then you should think of people you know that might be interested (classmates and friends). Think of people with good social skills, they will be the head of the group (along with yourself, of course).    -After you have a team and the paper work done, you can start spreading the word and inviting people to join the group.    Here yu might want to plan what will be the process for joining,     either an application, a $10 fee, gpa requirements, etc    After that you're pretty much on your own and can start fundraising to help the people in Darfur  :)    If you need more ideas, email me and I'll be more than happy to help you :)    Good Luck !|`|AA10047588	There is no genocide in Darfur.

It would be a disaster like Samalia. Did you see how much good they did in Bosnia? The simple fact is, they have been fighting before I was born, selling each other into slavery since recorded history. You kill off one dictator and another pops up. The Zulu fights the Hutu and all the others fight each other, they don't even need guns, they just use machetes. Its an ugly truth but we have been sending the peace corps to africa since kennedy to teach them how to grow things, to make things, and to be prosperous, how has that worked out. TV crews and missionaries don't want to go there to report how bad it is or try to help because they are killed. We should have taught them how to fight.

But we just have to wait and see.     PS: That guy that said Republicans want to tear America down is a moron. I'm not strictly for either party but Republicans follow the constitution to the book. Both sides think they know whats right for America.But It's ignorant to say such a statement as that idiot.|`|ieqLHMq8aa	i get the same vibe. honestly... i dunno what it is. he just seems a lil fake to me|`|7fIA6u3Oaa	Sounds like you have been reading emails from hateful republicans.  He is not a secret muslim. He is just a human being who loves his family. He wants to change things for the better. How about we give him a chance?|`|4bf562ccbf266e504b30ac04a5e0a34aaa	No, I don't.  The President is the solution he is not the problem.  This problems, he inherited from Bush.|`|hHSsMyNpaa	Obama loves America - he hates people like the Repubs that are trying to tear it down.|`|oTqZm4NFaa	I think Obama likes power. I don't believe anyone in government actually gives a crap about the people.|`|5Ys3GvpFaa	Of course.    Well, that's what I heard on the Sean Handtitty Show.|`|b3640707e483a3b444b16b298a3378aeaa	1. It's a little hard to believe that the best way to show you hate America is by running for President.    2. The process doesn't allow the best potential candidates to run successfully, but it's what we have.    3. Presidents always hire people from the previous Administration of the same party. Bush hired Rumsfeld, Cheney, and Powell. Don't those names sound familiar?|`|6d6a92cfa24029ef82993ae689105908aa	I did not vote for Obama but I will give him the benefit of the doubt and I think he is  sincere, I just think he is sincere about the wrong things.  The real danger lies in an incompetent and corrupt Congress. The presidents power is limited.  I agree with you 110%  that both parties could have made better choices. I also have faith that we have survived worse and we will survive this. The genes of "the greatest generation" no matter how diluted will win out in the long run.|`|RnLbJpvTaa	he loves big business and the israel lobby. thats all i know|`|AA12382198	He's been in office for all of 2 weeks.....I don't think he has anything to do with us being "sunk".    Does that mean that GWB hated America?|`|WQECudWkaa	Glad you added additional details.   I don't agree with your opinion of the President, but I support your right to express it.  He hasn't even completed the 1st 100 days yet.  Give him time, he will either make it or brake it.  Only time will tell.|`|rNq83Wgkaa	I hope not..He needs to blast Pelosi and crew for being so out of touch and so stinking liberal.... She is one crazy %itch|`|VfowGdWLaa	I agree with you.

AA11304025	Don't forget that Israel was founded by terrorists in 1948.  They are only doing what comes naturally and will go on until they eliminate all Christians and Muslims from Palestine.  Only jews can be full citizens of Israel.  Hitler would be proud of them.  Go to www.palestineremembered.com|`|Pi8KfmOxaa	i think its very sad that so many people on here actually believe this is ok|`|LWzrCu5caa	Israeli Terrorism?    They have to go a long long way to match Muslim terrorism.....    I have yet to see Israelis do a speech and then cut someone's head off with a hunting knife.   The Muslims excel at that one.|`|J9RuKMPXaa	They are brutes.|`|oTqZm4NFaa	BBC reported Hamas killed 50 people in 7 years and Israel killed over 1300 in less than three weeks. I find that very disturbing. I've actually stopped buying from Starbucks, as the owner of it is a zionist, he even recieved an award from there for being their friend. Ridiculous.|`|5Ys3GvpFaa	It's not terrorism, if you are wearing nice uniforms.|`|2d643fe2509c39d5e9d2affcc16d13bcaa	I'm sure if someone was shooting rockets into your neighborhood you would do something about it. Then when you found them hiding in schools and hospitals and nursing homes ..  Well guess those people like being human shields for terrorists. After all they voted hamas in.|`|ARBaZEMtaa	I'm deeply sorry for Palestinian cilvilians!!!  It's all due to a big mistake of Palestine Authority!

So hamas to you is a civilian? If so, then who started shooting rockets at Israel? And you call Israel a liar? Why do you let Hamas hide in your schools, hospitals, homes and anywhere there are "civilians"? If I had to generalize I would say that all Palestinians are terrorists then since they cover up hamas the way you are doing by saying that 1400 civilians died, like if not one single hamas terrorist died. Like another user said, "do not go from behind the lion, pull it's tail and not expect to get bitten". Leave Israel alone and maybe yall can talk peace and mean it for once. The State of Israel will never demolish. Your so called palestinians belong to Syria, have them go back to Syria.|`|fFT3R6K2aa	Now obviously you are looking for leftists answers, but I just had to write something different here.   First of stop call Israel Nazi  it is a shortcut of social-national. Think before using it. Israel is neither.   Who are Palestines rightful owners? Jews were there always. In fact, there was time where there were no Arabs there, but never a time where no Jews.     What is Israel doing in Gaza? Defending itself from these people    http://www.mideastweb.org/hamas.htm   Please read it. It is not Fox news, nor any kind of news. When people swear to kill someone, no matter what, it is called terrorism.     Who killed all these people? I dont suppose some innocent Palestinian farmer, right?  http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Terrorism-+Obs...    This video might also be interesting remember, you are defending THESE people  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_OGhj43G...
Nwx9NZ8Vaa	Bottom line is millions of people die worldwide of cancer every year, including various members of my family, but nobody goes to extreme lengths with the media like jade has. Ok, if shes in the paper once or twice then thats fair enough but this story is in every paper every magazine... thats kinda taking the proverbial piss, The media is just as bad as jade for advertising the fact.<br>  <br>  But i've got a funny feeling jade is going to make a miracle recovery, as I am very spectical about this story.<br>  <br>  Oh, and everybody hated jade because of the shilpa shetti love affair, now its ''We love jade''...<br>  <br>  Get over it. Make a few million, and have a nice 24 carat gravestone.|`|RxZqP0cdaa	You'll find out in about 3 months time, just imagine, you'll be able to join all the others screaming "Told you so didn't I"<br>  <br>  Exciting isn't it? Not.<br>  <br>  You could expend your energy on the plight of the starving, the homeless, the greedy tories, the robbing bankers, the stupidity of the olympics, the immigration problems, but alas, you see Jade Goody's eventual demise as worthy of your focus.<br>  <br>  I do feel sorry for you though!|`|NUc6Aw9Gaa	When my auntie died of cancer she looked great up until the last few weeks. so the theory that she looks well means nothing. As for the money thing Jade did this to provide for her sons but you have no idea if she will give anything to charity. you are just assuming she won't. Finally I don't think anyone needs to prove that how long they have to live at the end of the day it is no-ones business apart from jades who told her.|`|Pi8KfmOxaa	for goodness sake any medical expert can only give a rough estimate of the time of death , she could have a few weeks longer or if she unlucky could be alot sooner.talk some sense her medical team will never comfirm  her situation because of confidentiality.you think she looks so well are you blind, you can see in the girls face and eyes she does not have long.|`|QuGTZJIVaa	Damn those doctors for trying to get famous by making up a serious case of cancer, thereby ridiculing all those genuine people with the disease.<br>  <br>  Damn them all!<br>  <br>  Do you SERIOUSLY think the medical profession would stoop that low?  She has terminal cancer.  It's spreading beyond control and she is going to die.  I pray no-one you know has to suffer from this|`|HnNJAJeJaa	I really dont think you can put a time limit on something like this.<br>  sometimes in my experience,patients can go down hill fast,Where as some not so quickly...The fact she has the nurses around the clock,is a big indicater to me,usually its weeks,rather than months.....|`|qKdQpZ5Kaa	If I went to the doctor and was cleared of having cancer, then I went out raising money for myself claiming to be a cancer victim and my doctor found out.  Don't you think he would go to the Police?  I believe they are expected to if a crime is being committed.|`|iXwA5wAlaa	No, the girl looks genuinely ill, very ill.<br>  I can understand raising money for her boys, but more important than money is to try and ensure they have a warm, secure and sensible upbringing - and I don't think that thug Tweed, the boy's father or Jade's mother are the ones to give them  that.<br>  Enough publicity, plenty of money has been made, the boys need some memories of their mother to last for the rest of their lfe.|`|28e58aa413a9727e825b057237ec2cdfaa	I think the bald head and the travelling everywhere in a wheelchair is a bit of a give away...

I wish the people of this country would wake up to the fact that this is partly a publicity stunt, based on the fact that Jade Goody is being manipulated by greed.<br>  Yes of course she needs to make sure her kids are cared for, that what families do when one parent dies, they rally round, they don't go to newspapers to sell the rights to their deaths.<br>  So will Max Clifford take on the next 20 something year old woman who is dying of cancer, who has four kids, who is trying to raise them up on benefits . I'm sure he will not.|`|STmsOTO5aa	Everybody hated her until she got cancer and now everybody feels sorry for her.<br>  This world is full of hypocrites.|`|cGDgFrguaa	who is she?
JSjBecVHaa	He's getting a show on PMSNBC.|`|4bf562ccbf266e504b30ac04a5e0a34aaa	I personally had never even heard of this man, until here recently.  I can't say that I will miss him.|`|J9RuKMPXaa	His only fault is outspokenness. He said things which all other politicians think and do--quietly.|`|AA10431326	I going to miss Jay Leno's jokes on Blagoevich.|`|AA12382198	He'll be back while we watch him on trial for all the crimes he committed while in office.    Microwave the popcorn and get a good seat.....and watch the fun.|`|9rhmeb7raa	He's not quite gone. He could try and work out a plea deal with the U.S. Attorney, pleading guilty to a misdemeanor. That would save both his Congressional and Gubernatorial pensions. In return, he would turn over his Rolodex and files to the U.S. Attorney about other corrupt elected officials in Illinois, bringing down the whole house of cards.|`|BE6v12pmaa	It all boils down to MONEY and CORRUPTION!! That's his kind of politics.He tried to sell the local government and he said he did no wrong! He is a jerk!!!
JSjBecVHaa	Kinda too early to tell. This week he began to show the Clinton, "all voters are morons who will believe anything" side. We'll see if it continues.|`|4zijn0cgaa	He is getting along just like a fish out of water. He is flopping around gasping for air.|`|b0f0f231555e5da9d455a8890388f3cbaa	Excellent for the two weeks he's been in the White House. This isn't a TV drama that will be solved in 48 minutes.  As Obama and economists have stated, this recession will probably last through his entire first term.|`|a6fUSU2Paa	He just came president. Christ, give him some time! It's far too early to give him a performance review.|`|v1ueeA9qaa	incredibly well.It usually takes eight years before its public that 5 members of your closest advisers cheated on their taxes thusly stealing from the public.He reached that number within two weeks.|`|AA11449234	I don't think he's done anything yet.  I hope he does very well though.|`|hlg20T4qaa	He has done decently enough for two weeks. He was able to get Congress behind him (although Congress is mostly Democratic) and pass all the resolutions he has asked for so far. His approval rating, though again it is way too early and he was very popular prior to getting in office, is at sky high rates. The Gallup approval rating showed that he had a 69% approval rate, which is the highest for a President who just got into office since John F. Kennedy.     Again, it is hard to measure because only so little time has passed and because he hasn't had a chance to do too much yet. My measures of his success so far would be his approval rating and his ability to get things done in Congress.|`|BE6v12pmaa	It is too early to tell but he has started good!! Let's hope he does well till the 4 year tern expires. But do you think the $20M hand out to the trouble- source Palestine should have been smartly spent if it was doled out to the homeless of uncle Sam???
Dunc379maa	Get use to it and the black satanic double standard and its amazing how most blacks consider themselves church goers which is such a joke because most of them don't act like Christians. One very professional data poll by Chicago Media Services on the subject concluded overwhelmingly that blacks in the United States are the most bigoted, racist social groups within the United States and the polls show 82% to conclude this. How about Jesse Jackson calling BO a "knitger" (spelling changed in order to not offend anybody) and no one said anything but if a white person called BO a "knitger" (spelling changed in order not to offend anyone) then hell would break loose. How about when Kramer on Seinfeld use the word "knitger" (spelling changed in order not to offend anyone) in a comedy club, in a comedy context, the comedy club fired Kramer. The hypocrisy is incredible and it should be illegal to tell anyone that they cannot use the "N" word "knitger" (spelling changed in order not to offense anyone). I get very offended when a black person uses the word cracker and the last time I heard a black person say that, my friends and I beat the hell out of him and bloodied his bleeping nose. I suggest anyone black person who use these white words in humor, then someone beat the hell out of them so they cannot get away with it just like we cannot get away with using the "N" word.|`|bJnqYE6maa	Well, you answered your own question.    No need to reassure me you aren't a racist.  Personally, I wouldn't get to excited if you were.  Why are you so sensitive about it?
Lx6TXgHKaa	Last time when shoe was hurled at Bush in Iraq, the Chinese media widely reported the event. But now when it was the turn of Wen Jiabao they all went dumb.<br>  <br>  Wen Jiabao deserved the shoe. It's sad that shoe missed its target.<br>  <br>  If anything this guy should be tried for, he should be tried for missing the target even though he had a clear sight.|`|hpzfccwaaa	He took his privilege of reporting news a bit too far, he must have been bored or frustrated, and threw a tantrum/shoe. His shoe did not make a mark on the then president, unless his pride or ego were hurt in some way and we really do not defend pride or ego so i would let him stand on the grounds of his statement on behalf of his people and give him that honor for his people.|`|AA11297448	I guess he has no "sole".|`|4TT8lSgwaa	If he is not guilty, his comrade in Iraq should be set free and every Chinese will have the right to throw shoes at Mr. Brown if  he visits China. <br>  One should remember China is the largest shoe exporter in the world!|`|xywgBurHaa	What do I think of his action ?? ...

m0O3el5Taa	Well, despite all the price gauging(spelling??) Theres a lot to it. The guys who drill the oil gets a little slice of the cheese. The oil company gets a little slice of the cheese. The plant that seperates the oil into your regular gasoline, diesel, kerosene and whatever else, gets a little slice. The delivery guy gets a little slice. The towel heads at your local gas station...slice, slice, slice. And by the time you pump the gas, you are now out of cheese. My suggestion,, go get a diesel truck, car, or whatever, and make your own fuel out of the grease in any fast food restaurant. The materials you will need will cost anywhere from 2-5 thousand dollars, but when you can go in your gas station and walk out money in your pocket and a pack of marlboros, its all worth it.|`|uJhrqJCDaa	Supply and demand.    There isn't much margin on the supply side; no new distillation plants have been built in close to 40 years.

Also the price per barrel of oil is a main factor as most oil is exported from the UAE.|`|JSjBecVHaa	Supply and demand, local competition and the fluctuating oil prices.|`|tvTVbZLGaa	no one is ever 100% sure on this.|`|nrGsxWw3aa	Seems like the gas prices are regulated by the "guy down the street".|`|paHt6Yi8aa	the gas prices change everyday because the supply and demand processes change so much, during rush hour, the price will be high, because everybody (almost) will need to get gas on the way home, but during say lunch, not many people get gas *same at night* but that's the main reason.|`|BE6v12pmaa	Because people are always speculating.Speculators are manipulators!!|`|KvGSOItiaa	because oil prices change every day
2Ypig4jBaa	Good news is that if you are getting a good analog signal it should work great.  Bad news is that it either works good or not at all.  No snowy pics in between.  I have had good luck with a GE, Motorola units.  There are some that I have tried to help neighbors with that don't work.    While all DTV converters are supposed to convert digital to analog not all will convert HDTV to the old "Standard" TV.    Enter in your zip code on this website.  It will not only give you an idea of which channels you may get but will tell you which direction the antenna should point.  Remember that it takes a few seconds before a converter can process a signal to output to your TV.  The difference in this processing time is quite noticeable between different converters.  So fine tuning an antennas position takes much longer time than analog.

The question is what they want to do?  Oil?  Launch attacks across our border?  Both?

tod8jy9Paa	There were no rocket attacks from the Palestinian refugee camps in the Lebanon in 1982 and yet Israel still attacked them killing hundreds of civilians and children The rockets are just an excuse to exterminate all Palestinians for ever. Then I guess they will turn their brutal attention on Iran. A target they will find is not so defenceless as the Palestinians  Shut up Shirley !!|`|5DBVCyA9aa	They helped start the war. Along with the suicide bombers before them, they helped bring misery and destruction to the people of Gaza who allow the terrorists to live among them.    Terrorist attacks are never excusable. Gandhi did not win freedom for India by shooting rockets at England. It's time for some people to grow up and stop the unproductive hatred.    Israel is not going anywhere, no matter how many attacks are committed by the haters. It is time to try another tactic to bring peace and prosperity to the Palestinians.|`|eCGg94HJaa	Few of the people who cite the rocket attacks on Sderot as cause to go in and blast the crap out of Gaza can tell you how many Israelis have been killed by them. As of May 2008 (these are the most recent figures I have that I trust), there have been FIFTEEN Israelis killed by Qassam rockets from the first recorded incident in 2001. Compare that with the 1300+ Palestinians killed in Gaza in the recent bloodbath.     Israel's violent occupation of Palestinian land since 1967 (like its occupation of southern Lebanon) is as illegal as Saddam Hussein's violent occupation of Kuwait and Suharto's violent occupation of East Timor - the United Nations has said so year upon year. However, viewed through the one-way moral/legal screen of western policy, Israel is above the law, and its violence is validated. The intellectual and moral contortion this position requires is not dissimilar to that achieved by the drones who apologised for Stalinism.|`|LJLU5FZQaa	Hmm, Michael, you are letting these hysterical  Zionist defenders of the indefensible get under your usually poised skin.  The rocket attacks by both Hamas and earlier Hizbollah killed people ( not just Jews but Israeli Arabs who mainly do not have much access to bomb shelters due to the built in discrimination of the Jews-first state of Israel). Yes, Israel has a "right" to try to stop this but with this "right" comes certain responsiblities which the international community is attempting to hold them to:   1 let the International press have access ( can't do war crimes if the whole world is watching)  2 Use acceptable levels of force   3 Respect UN schools, facilities and buildings.  4. allow humanitarian aid in to Gaza ( the Prime Minister of Turkey- at Davos-had some choice words to say about the blocade of Turkish humanitarian aid late last year. I agree with Michael, the Israelis are doing their genocide "lite"/make the victim the victimizer campaign because   in order  to keep American $$$ coming  they have to look good.  Expect new Hollywood movies out real soon along the plot  lines of "all Muslims want to kill us so we get to kill them first"  and "our feces have no foul odor"|`|Pi8KfmOxaa	i agree people should be more open minded to why rockets are fired into israel,im not saying its right but seems many people dont consider the palestians right to freedom that we all take for granted|`|NMpbLtuTaa	Isn't that what you are doing right now?|`|JSjBecVHaa	Your ignorance doesn't blind me and stop calling me shirley.      Edit: Michael w. you are an idiot. If Israel wanted to exterminate the people of Gaza there would be no gaza people right now.|`|i7oHTo9haa	Otto, you're a really bad provoker that thinks it's okay to send rockets into Israel but not for Israel to strike back in defense.  So sick of these lame questions from haters.    Its OK to kill a Jew if its a hundred or just one or two. Whether its a homicide bomber in a market or a car bomb in a schoolyard where they did park it. The act will get a slight mention on the mainstream news CBS, ABC or NBC you choose. Just shooting an Israeli settler now and then will at most just get a ten second mention on CNN. But dont you let a Muslim woman cry or it will be transmitted to all the news satellites in the sky. The scene will be played on your TV over and over every day and the image will almost never go away. They arrested my son she will tearfully say, and all he did was kill a few Jews yesterday. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will then demand that this Israeli aggression will not stand and must end soon! The French will then say Israeli oppression is out of hand. Hezbollah, Hamas the PLO will be given millions in compensation who knows where the money will go. The UN will need more money for a plan of relief so the US taxpayers fund them its beyond belief. So the message is clear on the national news. Its really OK if you are just killing Jews    Southern Lebanon is another story; Hezbollah is there in all its glory. Children play indoors on Katusha Rockets with bright yellow Hezbollah flags tucked in their pockets. Automatic weapons hang on the living room walls and rocket launchers are hidden in the apartment halls. Israel planes better not bomb this innocent family of just children and a mom. They are innocent because the news media says so, no matter the evidences to the contrary dont question them they just know. The innocent are not able to get out of the way because the families father has demanded that they stay. Islam is different but Americans are too dumb to know the wife cannot leave the house without a mans permission to go. I think its cowardly but the EU thinks its smart to stop rocket attacks on Israel you must blow the family apart. The press calls them innocent civilians and more even though Hezbollah fighters are standing at the apartment door. So now press reports its horrible, hateful, evil just to name a few, proving dont kill Arabs but its OK to kill a Jew.  ----------------  Edit: The blockade was in response to them smuggling in weapons and their continued desire for warfare.  Blockades are a long ago Western approved peaceful alternative to bombs and Arabs have used blockades against Israel twice that I know of.  Don't even complain about Israeli response to rocket attacks and then follow it up by complaining about a peaceful blockade.  That's  what happens when people are violent, there are consequences for their actions and nobody is immune from that.  Collective punishment is appropriate here because they ARE a collectively violent society:    77.69% of the Palestinian men and women voted in Hamas who's purpose is to destroy Israel, Europe and the Americas. The highest votes cast were from Gaza strip, with Rafah precinct having an 89% voter turnout.  84% of the Palestinians support violence on innocent civilians (Yeshiva Massacre, 9/11) and danced in their streets after both events.  94% of Palestinian children have been victims of domestic violence in their own homes by their own family members.  Children of Hamas  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTGbP55HG...  Hamas In Their Own Voices  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i08L09V0_...|`|wdyf1sueaa	Because they are doing it again, unprovoked.|`|e871c3bc7828a54588e8b88635cfba63aa	I think the rockets were fired deliberately to provoke Israel. That doesn't mean Israel is innocent, but Hamas doesn't care if innocent people are killed as long as it makes Israel look worse.
xdUjRxKzaa	We could cure it within nine months. Say, starting on the first day of March 2009 the government were to say " from this day on any teenage single mother will have to be absolutely and totally responsible for the upkeep and upbringing of her child, no free housing, no benefits except child allowance for the first child, no free rent, rates no free anything - you want a baby, you pay for it, not the hard pressed workers in this country".

When they get to 35 they could stop having them?  Because let's face it - these are not girls from nice families, they are from council estates.  Their mothers were pregnant at 12, so they think that's what you do.  Get up the duff a.s.a.p and start reaping benefits for a life of endless shopping at Primark.  I see them every lunchtime as I scoot out for a sandwich.  Latest chav fashions, mobile clamped to one ear, fag in the other hand, pushing a double buggy with their latest pregnancy bump.

I|`|VgPG5WMsaa	The idle idiot who asks such a stupid question.|`|uJhrqJCDaa	Israel has a right to defend itself.    A suicide bomber who targets and kills innocent civilians is a low down guttersnipe with no honour whatsoever. His actions are completely illegal.    A bomber pilot who drops a bomb and kills innocent civilians but gets back home safe as there is nothing to shoot him down is not dropping bombs for the purpose of killing civilians. There is a military target and he is sent to deliver the ordinance. The low risk does not put the pilot at the same level of cowardice. There is a whole level of intent that you are ignoring. There are no rules of international law prohibiting what he is doing. So the pilot is in no sense legally guilty.    As a combat veteran (ha) you should know that even the best and biggest tank goes around in circles if you put a pitchfork in the drivers stomach.

Or the pilot who is doing his best to get a terrorist and not shoot the house standing just inches away from the armed one?   Neither one is right, but one is trying to kill less, while the other is trying to kill more.   I respect the Gaza people. I hate the government.   Israel pulled its forces out of Gaza.

THIRD..... You obviously are bias .....so I do not expect much from my efforts..... I am a two time combat veteran.....I know first hand the insanity of war.....

Nobody listened to Churchill in the beginning but listened to Chamberlain. I think Blair might be offering one last chance for peace and calling the terrorists out.     It was a rude wake up call in WW2 when people finally discovered that Churchill was right. I'm fond of Blair as he stood up for a morally right decision even when he had an attempted lynching by frenzied citizens.  That takes real courage. I should hope he's not pulling a Chamberlain now and that worries me and thinking this land deal is going to work out. The Brits didn't acknowledge a Nazi threat in WW2 'til it was too late and they fail to acknowledge it now with radical Islam.     As far as what the terrorists think I don't care what they think.  If Blair is offering them one last chance at a peace process and they call him "stupid" then it's OBVIOUS they don't want peace.    Land for peace deal did not work out too well for Europe back then and it isn't working out now!  If Blair or anyone else thinks that it would work out then I also call them stupid!!!!!

And you can honestly trust every word that comes out of their mouths as well....    Oh, and for the record not a brit, 4th gen Australian.|`|5CI2YHoqaa	Well Blair is a fool, giving him the job as middle east peace envoy is like giving Hitler a job at the UN. Blair is a war criminal what right does he have to judge anyone, so they do have a valid point .

Obviously he is out to make money because he keeps you on tenterhooks wondering what the 5 magic bullets are.  <br>  <br>  Plus - I can only speak for alcohol addiction here.  My understanding is that it is perfectly hazardous for a heavy drinker to abruptly quit.  You have to cut back gradually or risk seizures.  So I would doubt that somebody with that issue could be free of withdrawal symptoms in 3 days.  My guess would be a scam.  Sadly many people will fall for it and pay for it because they are so desperate to quit their addiction.
uBRX1idgaa	If you love writing and journalism then I would go with that, magazines are always looking for mutiligual reporters, especially in todays world.  It also depends on what kind of lawyer you would want to be.  There are so many different kinds that all offer there own benefits.  For example, a patent lawyer helps companies compose patents without loop holes so that other companies would be able to use anothers idea.  On the other hand, a trial lawyers performance can ultimately determine wether an innocent man goes free or spends the rest of his life in jail.      But, your only 16, you need to relax enjoy high school, it only comes once.  Have fun while you are young, but always make sure that your grades come first.  you still have time to decide what you want to do.  After all, most college freshman enter college without choosing a major.  Only time will tell you how you will want to preceed in life.|`|6izMqiBVaa	You will only succeed on the path you will like to follow.  if u want to become a journalist and you enjoy what it has to offer then do it.Also you are only 16 you will have a long time to decide on what you really want to do.|`|h1VSyLp4aa	Well it really depends on wat u think. Being a lawyer requires more than arguing. You need to think strategies and u have to know a lot of rules and regulations.  But ur interests suit a magazine editor and it would be different and fun. And since u speak so many languages u could also think about other careers.

58ab84c8e75323d12805f86da46b4590aa	It is hard to prove if the Government does or does not crete events that could be considered terrorism or conspiracy. However it has been shown countless times they do contemplate such activities.|`|NMpbLtuTaa	Individuals can and do sink "belly" low. (Some people actually deliberately give AIDS to others.) What you are suggesting is possible but not likely happening in open Western democracies.  It's more likely that terrorists are attempting to develop chemical and biological weapons.|`|73d2c6050e09443b51029990dda007d4aa	Conspiracy theories are for people with much too much time on their hands. FYI the government is not out to get you, to be honest they don't care about you. You are a number to them nothing more. And... if you are insinuating that the government is smart enough to pull off something like 911 you have more faith in government that I ever will.|`|AA10761951	If a theory has any evidence, no matter flimsy, it stops being a theory.  And it becomes a possibility.  In regard to the 9/11 Conspiracy, there is a lot of evidence that points to a government conspiracy.      In his testimony to the 9/11 Commission, the Secretary of Transportation said he was in the same room as the Vice President on the morning of 9/11.  There was a guy that kept coming into the room telling the VP that how far away something was.  50 miles away.  40 miles away. 30 miles away. 20 miles away.  When it got to 10 miles, the VP was asked, "Sir, does the order still stand?" The VP replied, "Of course the order still stands.  Have you heard anything to the contrary?"  Sounds like he knew something was coming and he didn't want it to be intercepted.      From from September 2000 to June 2001, 67 planes steered off course. All 67 times our air defense systems worked as they should, and interceptors were launched. On September 11th, 2001, when Dick Cheney was running his war games, 4 jet airliners were supposedly hijacked, and all our systems that have worked flawlessly 67 times that year, failed. Coincidence?     Andrews AFB is 12 miles away from the White House.  This is where Air Force One is kept.  And it's also where a squadron of jets that are assigned to protect Washington DC are stationed. On the morning of 9/11, jets were sent up from Langley AFB in SE Virginia to protect Washington DC.  Langley AFB is 180 miles away.  Where were the Andrews AFB jets that were supposed to protect Washington?  Apparently, they had been sent away to another part of the country to participate in war games that took place on 9/11.      In the Twin Towers on the morning of 9/11, why did so many people report multiple explosions inside each of the towers. Kerosene, that's what jet fuel is made of, can't damage a building so extensively and quickly.      I believe the conspiracy happened as follows: Bush wanted to invade Iraq.  Something his father wouldn't do. Cheney came up with the idea of the terrorist attack and carried it out.  This gave Bush a way of getting into Iraq.  It also allowed the Bush Administration to initiate the War on Terror.  This let them spend as much as they wanted on anything they wanted.  And by the end of this administration, the National Debt went from $5.8 trillion in 2001 to $10.7 trillion in 2009.
AA11277726	You must remember that Pelosi is against the elderly because they do not buy her trash talk and make believe world. Liberals forget that someday they will be old and have to face the reality of their actions now. Obama is making one blunder after the other and will be just like Jimmy Carter, a one term president that will end up keeping the old belief that blacks have poor judgment alive.|`|mno4Qd5paa	Her got  the Hispanic vote by telling them he would make them all illegals citizens, now he is just trying to seal this for the next Presidential election.|`|AA10066516	HardNose you said it better than I could have!!!!!|`|zI2yGJC1aa	I totally agree with what you said.

JSjBecVHaa	The job market will pick up 2nd half of this year. It's all about consumer confidence right now. People are not spending because the media has scared them into not spending. This,( the media scare campaign), will end in the next couple months.|`|aV3bFchtaa	Prison guards, and Obama's domestic army are hiring.|`|gRfqjemmaa	The ones that are hiring are the ones that are busy. Most people do not hire when they are slow. I know this sounds cruel, but that is the facts.   If you want my guess, choose health care. Nurse, Nurses Aid, anything health related. Nursing homes, clinics, hospitals. The baby boomers are getting old, and need of care. My best guess, hope it helps.|`|DTymTQFZaa	The job market is fairly short.  But there are always going to be jobs in the food industry and Criminal Justice field. Information Tech is also a good field.  Unfortunately labor jobs seem to be going out of the window, or to other countries.
AA10047588	Some countries, some societies, and some religions still have the barbaric roots that most humans came from.  World war I and II convinced the western world that two opposing countries killing civilians is bad for both.  The countries that sponsor terrorism - prime examples being Pakistan and Iran - don't see it this way.  They use the Geneva convention as shields against them being attacked while they attack and kill civilians of their opponents for political gain.  The sad thing is that we in the west are not ready to treat them symmetrically.|`|Pi8KfmOxaa	personally i see it the act of desperate people ,you have to question why they do it|`|J9RuKMPXaa	Terrorism is committed by cheated nations. STOP cheating them, give them freedom, give up your wicked propaganda tricks, and you won't have a problem with terrorism.|`|kjdKkDAkaa	They think their acts of terrorism will get them what they want.    They have to have a messed up mind to be so cruel to others  -- and they don't know they are on their way to hell. They do not know God.|`|5Ys3GvpFaa	They can't afford a "real" army.  Without a "real" army, the slaughter is not legitimate.    No one wants to be killed by someone who is not wearing an expensive uniform.    If you're going to kill a bunch of people, you could at least dress-up and use expensive high-tech weapons.    Poor people should NOT be fighting back against a wealthy nation.      BTW:  I'm being sarcastic.|`|uJhrqJCDaa	Iran finds terrorism through groups like Hamas a useful tool to spread its influence while not giving another nation just cause to attack it.
TXNJUbAxaa	Occupations don't have ethics.  People do.  Regardless of what profession they are in, people always make some assessment for themselves of what the most reasonable act is that brings about the greatest good.  They don't always do the most ethical thing.  But they know what it is.
