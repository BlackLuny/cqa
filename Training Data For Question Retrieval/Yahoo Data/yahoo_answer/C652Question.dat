(I'm not gay)   I can relate to her physically and emotionally...but what about intellectually. Intellectuality is just as important as the rest of them.   How do I do that? What shall I do to connect with her in that way?   We have amazing conversations, but it seems to me that she really wants to connect with me like that.Not that there's anything wrong with connecting in that form, I just don't know how. Any advice other than being myself?

I just found out from my son and his best friend (both are 6 years old) that some months ago, when my ex husband asked last minute if my son could go with him to a Rams football game (I explained he was busy with a play date with is best friend but the Ex replied he had two extra tickets and that both could come...so I ran it by the guest's Mom and she thought it would be alright..) that according to both children, that at one time me ex left both of them alone in their seats as he went to get something, and another time when my son had to go to the bathroom - left his best friend alone in his seat.   Would YOU leave a 6 year who you never met before and do not know unattended in a stadium?  How about your own child and his friend?

20090222193024AALmhAt	Family & Relationships;Family	Biological mother issue, PLEASE HELP!?	When I was 5 months old I was placed up for adoption by my mother. Shortly after that I was adopted by my parents, who sadly both died when I was 11 in a drunk driving accident. I was brought up mainly in Nebraska on my moms thriving farm and frequented England and South Africa because my parents were both doctors.Fast forward 4 1/2 yrs, im 16 and currently living in London with me and my friends in our dorm room.I get a knock on the door from a PI that tells me that my bio mom is in Kansas and requested to meet, so because I was traveling to Topeka to pick up my new car anyway I decided to stop by for a visit.When I got there, everything seemed okay but eventually it turned bad when my bio mom found the receipt for my 2007 mustang and the accessories I added to it, and also found out how much I inherited from my parents, who left me a fair bit of money from the businesses they and my family started. So now not only are they implying that im selfish for spending so much on a car and not lending them any money to pay off  bills but my bio sister, aunt, and mom are constantly calling and harassing me about not only moving to their beloved trailer but not letting me see a dime of my money until im 18! Also, their constantly harassing my GF and saying that shes using my for my money and precede to call her every name in the book on Myspace and now im constantly receiving papers saying that I must go to Kansas for visitation and a DNA test to! So naturally,when the days come to where im scheduled to go to Kansas I run off, and its now got to the point where my bio sister and aunt are now searching all of London for me as we speak! What should I do? Should I fly back to Nebraska and hide out on my farm, or should I remain hidden under my GF'S bed?

20090222193814AAgzvt0	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is my husband a pedophile?	Hello I am going to try to explain my situation hopefully someone can help me out with this because I am very concerned.      I married my husband 8 months ago. I am 22 and he's 38 a couple of days ago I found out that he had made a fake myspace and that he lied about his age and location (he put he was 27) The I asked him what was the purpose of that myspace and he told me he just wanted to get in touch with some old friend and that he lie about his age because she (who was 23) didn't like to talk with old people. I told him to show me their conversations.   They were talking about some other girls that my husband later told me was his ex. The I read one of the messages that read " OMG I haven't talked to you in 6 years!! how did you find me?!! Then I started calculation you know 38-6=32  and the fried he was talking to was 23 so 23-6=17 So I said WTF you were going out with a 17 year old when you were 38 and he said" age wasn't an issue for us" then I thought so why the **** did you lie about your age on you fake myspace??? I think he lied to this girl 6 years ago and told her he was 21.      Before that he told me that he had a friend that like little girls and raped a couple...and I am thinking that maybe he was "the friend" The on his "real" ( I dotn even know him anymore) he had all this 15-17 "friens".....         OMFG the my  mom and my brother told me that when he went to do laundry with them he was staring at some teens hardcore (14-16).      Is he a pedophile?    What can I do about his?   Could I denuce hi?   I am scared!

20090222194128AAUwOpF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls are confusing...What is going on here!?!? Please help?	Ok, this one girl knows I like her and the other week she calls me. I don't answer. I call her back and it goes to her voice-mail. She calls back. That was the first time I had ever heard her voice. Today, I ask one of her friends for her best friend's number and I start talking to her and she was like "oh, I'm surprised you remember me" and i was like "i'm surprised you remembered who i was" and then she says, "Oh, how could I forget you? I was pretending to be (name) on the phone last week. That was funny!" I just ignored it and went on. But it doesn't make sense. The voice on her voicemail and her voice on the phone sounded the same to me. Also, her best friend I started talking to has been known to try to steal guys away from her friends. But I got her number trying to make the girl I like jealous because she has a boyfriend, I think, and I want to win her over. So is it possible that her friend likes me or at least wants attention from me? Or is the girl I like scheming something up to get more attention from me? Again, i'm really confused...

He asked me out, but i wanted to wait a bit longer, and then we had stop talking for about 4weeks. Now were talking again. I hear so much stuff about him; i heard hes a player, and a "garden tool" he leaves his myspace on sometimes [bad i know] but i look through it and he talks to girls, telling them he called them and giving them his number and stuff. Even girls that are not so good looking :/      But anyways, when i try to lay on him he would be like "get off, this is what married couples do" or when i say lets cuddle he would be like "wtf thats sentimental weak stuff" and idk.Then when i would put cute slow songs, he always trys to change it. I told him why cant he be sweet to me, and he says because that makes him weak.` I mean we get along, but we also argue alot. When we do he would say stfu, and f*ck you and stuff, sometimes he says hurtful things...      Idk what to do. I LIKE HIM SO MUCH!! I tell him hes rude and an assh*le, but he just says, idc, you still like me dont you, your still talking to me arent you. Hes rude and selfish at times. Hes not romantic, he has this i dont care attitude all the time. I mean he calls me alot and asks to hang out alot, but hes just sooo emotionless i guess.      Why is he like this?.   what do i do??

20090222171627AABdHnO	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Wedding Reception Issues. PLEASE HELP!?	I am getting married in May 2010. Although my parents are not exactly poor I am not worried about a cheap wedding reception, but since the economy is so horrible at this time and will most likely be in the future my parents income is so limited at the moment. My fiance and I have already agreed to have the wedding in my small hometown to make it easier for guests because my fiance grew up in a small surrounding town not too far. Well my mother is suggesting we have the reception at the banquet hall in my town. Yes, its nice and I know with my mothers talents she could make it look amazing but I had my high school proms there. All the high school proms and big events are usually held there. It seems so weird because my crazy ex and I had moments in there plus one of my bests friends funeral banquets was also held there. Unfortunately, its not as easy as just telling her I don't want to have it there. The problem is there are not any other close banquet halls in the area. The closest one is 50 miles away. Some of the guests will already be traveling more than that to even get to the wedding. I have no idea what to do. I am so confused about the situation. Can anyone help?

He goes the same night he left his wife and got her name tattooed on his arm, in a diffrent language.  She agrees to meet him the next day, in a local place in town.  They talked, and he kissed her.  They spent the next few days together after work for a couple hours, and he tells her he loves her.  She tells him she is going to leave her husband for him.  She has fell head over heels for him.  She truley loves him.  Everything is going great, untill he leaves work one day with no word.  Someone had told him she was playing him for a fool, that she would never leave her husband.  He sent her a text and told her that he was through with this, that he was going home to make it work, that he was tired of her using him.  He wont talk to her, but she knows that he isnt in love with his wife.  He went back for his kids.  She is trying to find a place to move to so she can leave her husband.  How does she get the other guy to listen to her?  His wife is guarding his phone. Any suggestions?  She isnt the type to break up a happy home, but she knows he isn't happy and hasnt been for awhile.....Please serious suggestions only.        I'm worried about her.  She isn't eating or sleeping, she is stressed out he has quit work, and all she does is cry.  Her heart is seriously broke.  I've never seen her like this, and I've know her for 20t years.

20090222172616AA0QMGw	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Is it wrong that I have women friends and I may ask one to go to California with mer if I live with one?	I was wondering if it is wrong that I may ask a lady friend to go to California with me? Here is the thing. I live with a wman and her daughter. I love and am in love with her very much. But she told me that I should have asked her first. Was that wrong for me to do? I am not going out with either one of them nor am I interested in a relationship of any tiype with this lady friend of mine that I was going to take out there. I was merely asking her cause the lady I live with told me she wanted space. So am what I doing wrong? Cause I got the response of I can just go out to California and love alone and that she wishes that her and I hooked up 2 weeks ago?
20090222172844AAMzfby	Family & Relationships;Friends	Help!  I don't know if I should tell her that me and her friend kissed?	My friend is really good friends with this guy. We all went out and were dancing. The guy kissed me and I suck at knowing how to turn guys down in a good way without making things awkward after, so we did kiss. I want to be friends with the guy so I am always afraid if I turn them down they won't want to be friends. We didn't make out or anything just a kiss. I am not interested in the guy and I don't think my friend is either. Pretty sure she could have him if she wanted. Should I tell her? Should I see if she likes him? I feel bad if she likes him.I am pretty sure she doesn't like him because she has this one thing with a a different guy but he doesn't go to our school and I am really afraid if I tell her, it will ruin our friendship.... ahh what do you think I should do?

So my dads been living with this girl for a few years so far, and I'm starting to think enough is enough. So shes seriously so wired, so I go to my dads place on weekends sometimes and OK all she does is stay in her room and complain I'm not even kidding its so annoying, and whenever she does come out she just starts an argument with my dad. Then she finally got a decent job, but before she couldn't keep one for more then 2 months. Like I basically mostly hate, her, but within the last year, I've just learned to deal with her and respect her.   Shes always negative and doesn't have any friends so she depends on my dad all the time for almost everything, and she barely pays her rent, then she complains about useless stuff.   The big thing is that I don't even think they like each other any more, or idk shes more my dads mental room mate then a girlfriend to him.   Well I want to check her into a mental institute, but idk how to, so what should I do about this whole issue that's been going on, I'm getting tired of every time I go over there that they are fighting.

Next, I want to be a music teacher when I grow up, and he says if I do that I will be a failure, I have to do what he wants me to do (and that is be an egineer). Next, my sister, who is 18 and in college, broke her relationship off completely with him, and she turned out to be MUCH MUCH happier in the end. She says to go with my heart with this decision, and my eart is SCREAMING to not have a relationship with him. Our family has gone through therapy and everything under the sun, I have even tried talking to him about it, and he still blames those problems on me and says i'm the source of all the problems. He also said that the divorce was my fault and that he used to hit me because I was bad. WHAT SHOULD I DO????

20090222173116AAed3ze	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Tough situation: I'm ready, he's not - what would you do?	So I've been with my boyfriend for 3 years. I'm 28 and he's 38. I'm completely in love with him and I love the way I feel when I'm with him and I can truly see myself being happy with him forever.  He's so sweet and loving and romantic.  He takes care of me and knows just what to say and do to make me feel better when I'm upset.  He's also very giving and helpful to everyone, including strangers.        He's worked everyday since I've known him, he's probably only taken off like 5 days in the 3 years we've been together, that includes weekends and holidays.  He owns his own business and is an extremely hardworker.  When he's not working at his own business, he's working on other projects or helping friends with their projects.  That's fine with me - he really loves working and helping people, my problem is he's never taken the time to figure out what he wants out of life besides working and making money.  He says he didn't really think that he would get married or have a family, but he says he honestly never really thought about it, but now that he's with me he thinks he might want a family.  He wants a year to decide if he really wants a family or if he just thinks he does because I want a family and he doesn't want to lose me.      My problem is I've been having some problems with my reproductive system and I'm going to be 29 in a few months, reproductively, I feel like I'm getting old.  My biological clock is ticking loudly and I have serious baby fever right now.  I'm so in love with him that I really can't stop thinking about making and raising a baby with him.   A year seems like a long time for me to wait, I think I might go crazy.  But, I feel like if I leave him its going to take longer than a year to meet someone else and fall in love again anyway.  I really don't want to be with anyone but him, but I don't want to wait.  This is so hard.  What would you do?  How would you stay sane?

20090222173304AAkdKEw	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Was I in the right to stand up for myself or was I being Childish?	I meet a man two months ago and we hit it off well and got along really really good. He asked me to be his girlfriend and I said yes. We both decided that we wanted to start a new life in a different state together. He went to visit his brother in a different state and said that if he wanted to live there that he would be back and get me and I could go back and decide if that's that place i wanna be with him. If he didn't want to stay that he would be back and that we could start a new life some place else. Here is the problem. He calls me on Valentines and we had a good conversation and he always says feel free to call me anytime and I will call you back. At the end of the conversation he says maybe i will call you tomorrow. Since he didn't call I called him once a few days later and left him a message with his brother. Haven't called him since. Five days later he calls and I asked him as to why I haven't heard from him? He raises his voice to me and says Don't start on me for I had a bad week (rudely) I felt very hurt by this and calmly said to him " You know what never mind, forget it and hung up on him." He hasen't called back.

20090222174509AAOoZyj	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is this normal behavior for a wife?	I can't figure out what to make of my wife's social life these days. I'm glad she's building new friends after quitting her long-time job. She's texting them and on the computer email for hours of the day -- even late into the night; and she's even sneaking peeks at her blackberry during dinner with family in the event someone texted her.       She's at her gym twice a day, which has gotten her in incredible shape but means she's away from home a decent amount of time. She doesn't do most of the housework during the week, when i'm gone (a point in her quitting was that she could do these things for us); she saves it for the weekend, my off days. When we're alone, our conversations seem forced as of late, as though we can't find much to talk about.      I'll tell you that we're in counseling already. Short version is we've had trouble getting pregnant, and that has created issues in the marriage and bedroom. Plus with her job change, there's been lots of big life changes lately. This was her idea, so I don't want to create a misleadingly negative picture of her.      At first I was simply feeling a tad neglected, and I've said as much in counseling. Still this is continuing. Now I'm starting to feel more than neglected -- maybe a bit like the marriage really is on the skids, perhaps for good.      Any advice? Are my feelings crazy? What should I do?

20090222173648AAd801P	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Did I over react?I feel guilty?	This afternoon everything was going well between us. My fiancé & I were going to a restaraunt.she was wearing a pink Dallas cowboys sweater and jeans. In the car she was singing along to the radio & for some reason I had the sudden impulse to kiss so I did when we stopped at a red light. She was like "what was that for?" I just said "cuz I luv u" she just smiled and said ok. Like I said we were doing great. Then this obnoxious guy comes up to her and says "cowboys fan huh?" she's like "ya" so he says "so you like romo?" she's like " I love him!" so he says "would you ditch this guy if romo asked you out?" she looks at me and says no offense but yes. I got up from the table and I'm like "enough.thanks for letting me know how much you love me chelsey" and I leave. Before I left the restaraunt I saw her and she looked like she was crying and I instantly felt horrible. I left and I've been calling her over and over leaving her voicemails like"babe I'm sorry forgive me?" but she doesn't call me back. She lives with me but she hasn't come home since then. Help??

20090222175649AAgvcpA	Family & Relationships;Family	Is my mother jealous of me, and what should I do?	My mother just recently went through a really bad divorce, I'm talking restraining order bad. Ever since then she has been very rude and just unpleasant to be around. My whole life she has always been hard and harsh but i have learned to accept her for what she is and love her through all the negativity. This past summer was the worst of all, she was always accusing me of ruining her life because I supposedly "make problems for her", i just don't see what she is talking about. I am an honor student in the top of my class, a cheerleader at my high school, and I am always watching her two other children. The fact that she had me when she was 16 might play a roll in how she feels, but i don't think it should define how she treats me. My grandparents play a large roll in my life, because my father lives so far away. My mother is always making nasty little comments about the time that I spend with them. She says that I love them more and that I treat her with no respect. My argument is, how can i respect her as a person if she is always drinking, smoking, and going out to clubs. I mean really, I need her to be a mom. So anyways, to make this long story short, this summer she got mad at her ex husband and blamed me for what went wrong in their relationship. Up until then, I had never really stood up to her, but when she tried kick me out of the car and fight me for my cell phone, I had had enough. She called me all these names and I had no clue why she was so enraged. She told me to pack my effing things and to leave, because "she can't deal with me anymore." I ended up staying with my grandparents for the summer, but for the school year, the courts made me go back with my mother. I have a social worker, but she really can't do anything. We have been to counseling, but when the counselor started focusing on my mother, she quit. I am stuck at this point and am starting to see her old habits come back. What can i do?

20090222175149AAn2nL7	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why do I always like my friend's boyfriend?	Whenever my friend is dating a guy, I start to develop a crush on him. The only guys I've liked have been her past two boyfriends. When her previous boyfriend broke up with her, the amount I liked him decreased a lot.   Why is this and is it normal?
20090222175440AAmtJyg	Family & Relationships;Family	How do i deal with my academically-obsessed mother?	I'm a sophomore in high school.  Normally, I'm a straight A student; I work hard in every class and study for every test.  I've passed every class since i started elementary school.  But last semester i nearly failed my fifth-year Spanish class (passed with a D-).  My goal is to graduate with an Academic Honors diploma.  Part of the requirements for that diploma is that I take and pass (with a C+ or above) either 3 years of one foreign language, or two years of two languages.  My fifth-year Spanish class was top be my third year in a language then i was done.  But, since I passed with a D- i took French II for my second semester, fulfilling the requirement for two years in two languages.  But, even though I passed French II, my mom is insisting that I take Spanish 5 again to better the (what I believe to be) now pointless grade.  She's even called a meeting with the teacher and my counselor, even talked to the principal.  She keeps insisting that if I don't retake the class, I'll never even qualify for a scholarship and that I've ruined any chance of going beyond a Bachelor's degree in college.  Every night I come home from school, it's not "how was your day?"...it's more like "You should've done better on that test the other day" even if i studied for nearly four hours straight.  And lately I've gotten really depressed and started feeling like nothing I do is good enough for her anymore.  All of this is coupled with the fact that she and my dad are never home and spend almost every waking hour at work or with my little brother, they never seem to have time for me anymore.  She's spent so much time away that I don't know how to talk to her anymore, and I feel guilty that I wouldn't mind if she died tomorrow.  I want to tell her to lighten up about it but every time I try we always end up in a huge fight.  I just don't know what to do anymore...any opinions?

20090222175935AAOu7UC	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Who should you invite to a wedding reception?	I am getting married this September and we are having a Bermuda destination wedding.  We do plan on having a reception once we return home and want to share our special moment with our friends and family.  My question is when it comes to people I work with.  I have about 17 people in my office, some of whom I am friendly with, and others who I really don't want to spend any money entertaining at a reception!  Some of the people I have known for a very long time and honestly, the ones I am not nuts about are some of the newer people who I have only known a few months.  If I invite people from work do I need to invite everyone?  Also, do I need to invite all of their spouses/significant others, or is there a way to make it clear that they are invited (sans spouses)?      Thank you!!

20090222185335AAJd5YR	Family & Relationships;Friends	Senior year and prom....?	So basically it sucks. and i only i have 3 more months left.   Well the school part is easy but i feel like my social life is really low.      I have friends but we don't hang out alot as we used to like junior year, for example:   Friend #1:   we were great friends and had a great time junior  year but then she got a boyfriend and everything changfe. we hang out less. and everytime me and Friend #2 try to make plans with her she says that she's busy and she can't hang out at all, then we find out that she was with her boyfriend and with our friend #0. And she never tries to make plans with us.      Friend #2:   This friend also shares my pain with friend #1 so we are a bit close. Well the thing that i have a problem with her is that she can be a bit annoying. For example, everytime we hang out she's always takes forever getting ready and i have to wait for her. When i'm not ready she makes leave when she wants to leave. When we hang out she always text somebody and i try to have a conversation with her and she doesn't seem that interested and starts talking about herself like her life is more important.      Friend #3:   she isn't friend with #1 and #2. but me and her are great friends. lately it seems like she's more into partying while i'm not at all. and whever we're alone we get along very well but when she's with her other friends she makes it seem like her "party" friends are more important.      The problem that i'm having is that i don't know which friend to go to prom with. My mom is really excited for me, because she never went to prom because she didn't go to high school. but i haven't told her about my friend situation. And i don't want it to be like homecoming where i came home crying.   So i thought i should get a date for prom. the only problem is that there's no i guys at school that i like. and no, i don't have any guy friends because the guys there saw me through my awkward years.      There's this guy that i had a crush on last year but he graduated. All i know that he's going to be at the art show that are school is having because his sister is in it, so obviously he's going to go. and prom is a few weeks after the art show.   So i was thinking that i should talk to him and try to get him to be my prom date even thought i haven't seen him for 6 months. :/      Ugh i don't know what to do. I don't want to disappoint my mom. I want to have a fun time at prom. I want a date.   I'm sorry this is really long.   But thanks anyway.      And please don't write, "stop being such a whiney kid, everybody else has problems you know!!"   because yes everybody else has problems, except some people don't know how to handle some certain problems. like i can handle some problems well than others, but this type of problem never happened to me before so i don't know what do.

20090222184018AA1wh8a	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Can't afford to be in the wedding party?	My cousin lives in (and is getting married in) Hawaii and asked me to be a bridesmaid. I'm totally flattered and honored. I want to be in it but I added everything up and it's over $800 for the flight, hair and make up company she chose, and dress. That's not even including a gift for the couple, shoes, and hidden fees and various expenses. I feel really bad but I just can't afford it. I am only 21 and in college full time- I don't have $1000 to randomly spend.       If she'd asked me a year ago it would be different but she asked last week and the wedding is this summer. How can I nicely say no? How do you explain this?
20090222183633AAIVvaW	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Can't afford to be a bridesmaid what to do?	My cousin is getting married this summer in Hawaii. She is SUCH a nice girl and we are close to the same age (I'm 21, she is 24) but we aren't very close because I've only met her a few times since she lives all the way in Hawaii. She asked me to be a bridesmaid this summer and I said yes right away because I was so flattered and honored!      but I added it up and it's $400 flight, then she chose crazy expensive hair and makeup company $200 for each bridesmaid, plus a $180 dress and shoes and alterations. This all comes to over $800 WITHOUT a gift for the couple. I just cannot afford it and I think it's a little insensitive of her to choose such expensive things while we're in a recession. I'm only 21, I'm a student, and I can't afford this at all. I can afford the ticket there, but that's it. How can I tell her and be very nice about it?
20090222183200AAiwOI3	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How can I truly love myself if I haven't figured out my identity?	I've come to the conclusion that the reason I don't have many close friends nor ever been in a relationship at 21, is because of my inability to love myself. Part of the reason I can't love myself is because I haven't figured out who I am yet. For instance, I'm studying economics and business in college, but I know deep down, that these aren't my true passions. Basically I haven't found what I want out of life. I then tell myself that life has no meaning anyway, so nothing really matters.   Anyway, I realize that I do have some good traits...like I can be extremely funny at times and I'm easy to talk to. I then start thinking that maybe I am a decent person, just trying to find my way in life like everyone else and that I shouldn't be so hard on myself. But when it comes down to it, I don't know who I am or what I would like to be...so how can I truly love myself? Maybe I should just love that I'm trying to find myself..?

It's hard to see the love after all of this and it's really depressing me to see that this is how it might end up for me. I know if you find the right person you'll know but is there anyone here that isn't too keen on the idea of marriage??

She was absolutely beautiful...and I never thought I'd stand a chance to go out with her. Well...Date Night comes around...and she actually asks me to be her date for date night. Well of course, I said "Yes"...however, the date didn't go to well, as it was my first one. I didn't really know what to talk about and just kinda like...interviewed her. Lol...stupid me.       Well...it's been half a year now, and I still love this girl...even with all the girls at school...I just love her. She's beautiful and has the most amazing personality...after the camp ended...we texted each other for a period of time...and then just stopped.      well, recently I've started to text her back...just asking how she is and stuff. she's never called/texted me first or anything...      the only thing is...she lives a couple hours away from me...

Should I give her a hug at the beginning or the end of the date?      lol thanks!
20090222183806AAWB6Gx	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Will he come back around or is it really over?	I had been dating this guy for the past 2 and a half months and decided to end it. During that time we got pretty close. My reasoning for ending it is that I wasn't sure that it was the right time for us to be having any kind of dating relationship. He told me from the beginning that he is going through a divorce and is trying to uphold his business. Both of which were putting him under a lot of stress and that he's not ready to be emotionally involved. I became concerned when we were sleeping in the same bed together almost every night and nothing physical was happening and I never felt like he wanted to be affectionate. The other problem is that while I was contemplating ending things I went out with another guy for dinner, nothing happened but I figured it would be a way for me to see what else is out there before I decided anything. I never told him about this but did mention the next day that I wanted to keep things open to see other people. During our breakup conversation I slipped and told him about the other guy. He was livid!! He said he is upset that I didn't tell him before I went out with the other guy but after. Since then we have been fighting and he doesn't want to even talk about it! I apologized to him in an email and he txted back saying he accepted it but to not bring it up again. I am really regretting that I did this. Now that almost 3 weeks have passed since this I feel like if I had never gone out with that guy and had been more patient things could have worked. I told him I made a mistake but I don't know if he will forgive me. Do I stand a chance here? If so how should I go about this ?? He hasnt called or anything since last week.I txted again a few days ago apologizing but no response. I dont know if he'll ever want to talk to me again. I really just feel like I screwed this up. Does he just need time to come around and call me. I dont want to give up on him. I wish that some way some how he will realize how I really feel.

20090222185606AAZhd7i	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I feel like i am totally missing out on something? What is wrong?	This is honest. this is not stuck-up. I don't think i am all that, i am just laying out the facts because i feel like something is wrong...      I'm not a bad person. people tell me i'm a really nice and cool person. I'm a great friend. I'm not skinny, but i'm not fat. I have green eyes and brown curly hair, which i think make me look nice. I'm not much to look at, but i'm not the person you turn your head away cause i am ugly.      Nobody likes me. ever. I've had a boyfriend or two, but that was in middle school. I'm now a sophomore, and nothing. I dress girlier, i am lighter, thinner, have boobs now and am a better person.      what's wrong...

I don't want to go over the limits on getting her a expensive gift, but I want it to be nice. I told her I already got her a b-day gift, just to make her happy. I already asked my dad to get me a couple things ( a little expensive ) and he said later on this week. I'm  afraid if I ask him again he'll start yelling. But tell me what all of you guys think I should get Emily ( my friend ).

20090222181356AAVEgLG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this girl like me?	Okay so late at night like 2 am when I was very tired almost half asleep, my friend tells me and other guys at his house that he's sneaking some girls into his house without waking up his dad. So all the guys and girls got in a circle and we started talking. I was quiet most of the time since I did not feel like talking. When the group conversation started to slow down this girl next to me, says outloud, Why arent you talking? about 2 or 3 times. I was like im tired. Then later, I decided to go get some chairs for people to be able to sit and that same girl was like "nice shoes" even though they were beat up jordans and were my friend's shoes. Then later she says "youre tall" although i am only 5'7'' and I said "nah" then shes says "yes you are". Btw, Im asian and shes white.

We were dating for 2 years and he was telling me how he feels old etc.   then BOOM..we broke up but it was bitter sweet.   He tells me how much he loves me and how hard it is and how amazing i am and how much he wishes he was 25 so he could marry me right now etc.   but his mind is made up aboutthe breakup and even though i tried talking about it he gets mad. so i have to leave it   should i just leave him and give himhis space and let him figure things out?   Its so tough. I saw him 2 weeks ago (we broke up on feb 1st) and he cant stop hugging me and treating me like his gf again when we see each other...open my door, kiss my hands, my nose etc.   We are also both in ourr 4th year of university as well   Honestly, the relationship was so mature and great. Even he admitted that when he was talking about it..sad ofcourse.

20090222183758AAVPrG1	Family & Relationships;Family	I might have ruined my family and my father punished me so severely and I'm afraid he'll never forgive me?	I just found this website and I am in desperate need of advice. I think I might have ruined my family tonight.      This afternoon my parents went somewhere with my aunt and uncle, and they all went in my aunt's car, leaving my dad's car behind. He also left his keys. I am 16, and I just got my license but my parents don't let me drive alone yet, but I really wanted to go to my boyfriend's house so I.. pretty much stole my dad's car. I thought no one would notice and it wouldn't be a big deal!       But something HORRIBLE happened. My boyfriend and I went to the mall, and what must have happened is the keys must have fallen out of my purse, and I think someone found them and used the locate car feature to find the car, and they stole the car... I had to call my parents and tell them, and they and my aunt and uncle came to the mall, and they took us to the police station and my parents filed a report, and then my aunt and uncle drove us home..      My mom was crying and my dad wasn't speaking to me, but when we got inside he just started shouting at me and my dad has NEVER shouted at me before, I know that sounds hard to believe but he hasn't! And then he grabbed me and yanked down my pants and underpants and pushed me over his lap and started spanking me REALLY hard and yelling at me about how he might lose his job now cause it was our only car and he doesn't know if he'll be able to get to work and he kept spanking me and spanking me and it hurt SO bad, and I've never been spanked before and it was so embarrassing and I was crying and my mom was crying and my bottom felt like it was on fire and it still kind of does, and when it was over he yelled at me to go to my room.      And so here I am, and I've been up here for a few hours and I don't understand what's going to happen now! Did I ruin my family? My mom was saying things would get worked out in the morning when he can talk to the insurance company but my dad was SO angry and he seemed so worried. Do you think he hates me now? He's never yelled at me before and NEVER spanked me before, I think he must hate me! I'm afraid to go downstairs because I'm afraid I'll get spanked again. I've never been in serious trouble before!!
20090222184729AAgIRCc	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Kissing her neck? How to make it better for her?	Ok, Shawn here, the question tonight is how can i make "necking" better for my gf. We started it two weeks ago on valentine's night, and i know that she enjoys it.      But when she does it to me, it's soo good that it nearly gets my rocks off. Like we'd kiss and neck for 30 minutes or so, and when i go to the bathroom afterwards and i checked my shorts and there was some clear kinda sticky fluid(precuhm, maybe). She's sooo good at it, she makes me moan and groan. A LOT.      When i neck her she breathes hard and sometimes moans, but i want to make her as excited as i am if possible. Just last night, i knew i was hitting the right spot, while she was moaning and breathing hard she took off my shirt. I thought she wanted sex, but she simply said i was too sweaty. We both don't want to have sex, but a handjohb would've been nice :)      How can i tell if she enjoying it?      How can i make it better for her, if not improve on my kissing/necking technique? for me it's just sucking, licking fast, then up and down.      She also said she was tired afterwards.      How do i tease her? if necessary.      Answers/Opinion/Advice would be lovely.         Thanks.         Shawn.      P.S. how can i kiss/neck her so that she gets so excited that she nearly orgasms, if not orgasms, like what happened to me? That'd be awesome.

20090222191141AAfYKxg	Family & Relationships;Friends	How can I help my friend with her family problems?!?	I have a bit of a difficult question to ask, and hopefully she wont find this. My best friend whom I consider my sister is going through some major family problems. Her dad is rarely around and when he is, he gets mad about her grades and other things. Well she doesn't know how to stand up to him (or her mother) and tell him that he is the reason her grades are bad.   She is going off to college next semester and her parents want her to live at home because they are afraid she will act out and get herself into trouble.   But in order to get good grades, she needs to move out, and be able to figure things out on her own.    They need to let her go!!!    I have run out of ideas to help her, and i don't know what to do!   Does anyone have any advice?   She knows that I am there for her, but I am so afraid that that's not enough. She has younger siblings, so this problem needs to be fixed not only for her, but for her siblings as well.    Sorry this is so vague but I do not want her finding out who wrote this.

I try to talk to him but we usually get into stupid arguments, and the only way he actually has fun during a conversation with me is when he's teasing me or ridiculing me about something.    He deleted me from his facebook account cuz he's like some of his guy friends were wondering if i was single..so he obviously felt uncomfortable..and when i ask him if i can go to clubs with him he's like you're still too young...wtf i'm 19!   I've told him how i feel but he just takes it as a joke and ignores me...he's really pissing me off. grr..what should i do?

20090222184050AANq2gN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What is with girls shaving pubic hair?	I'm twenty years old and have been dating a girl steady for over a year. Neither of us shave our pubic hair, even though both of us in the past did. We both have had sex in the past with other people while we were shaven, but we agree that sex with that natural padding of hair is so much better as it increases the potency of her pheromones as well as increased sensitivity to the mail genitalia. The question I have is, why are so many people afraid of leaving it natural? It feels so much better that way and to me looks much better, as it is a sign that a man is making love to a woman, not a girl. Why do so many young teenage girls feel that they need to shave their pubic hair off? It doesn't make much sense to me.

Anyways, so a few months later i started dating Tom and hes a really nice guy. So 6 months in and i'm not feeling the same way about Tom as i used to, but every time i come close to breaking it off, i chicken out. what can i do?    The other problem i have is that my X andrew has started talking to me again and saying things like he loves me and cant live without me. I still have feelings for him, but not like before, but still cant seem to resist to talk to him when he talks to me.    My last crazy problem i have is that i'm starting to fall for my friend, and i think he likes me too, and i can't seem to stop it. I wanna stop it cuz hes a really good friend of Tom's and i don't want to hurt him.    so basically, My bf tom hates andrew and andrew hates tom too, and Tom is best friends with my friend...what should i do?

20090222183156AAXWDbI	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How can i make my husband trust me?	I am a 25 year old female, I have been living with my boyfriend for six years, so i basically do consider him my husband. We have a marriage except without the legal binding papers. We have been together for seven years in total. In seven years I have never been unfaithful to him. We've actually have grown and matured together. There was an incident back in 2004 when i was speaking to a male friend, who asked me an inappropriate question, and instead of putting him in his place, I played along! My boyfriend, heard, he was hurt and angry and even though I did not see where he was coming from at the moment, because i was very young and naive, it never happened again. He forgave my indiscretion, but he never forgot it.    Since then all of our problems have been over trust. He doesn't trust me.We've grown together, we've been through hardships and since we are both relatively young, we always talk about our aspirations and our goals. I do not see myself with another man. He is my inspiration. He is such a good man, and he's good outweighs the bad. But, this past Thursday, he truly crossed the line. He actually installed a spyware system in our computer. Funny thing is, he did not find anything that can indicate i have been unfaithful. The only thing he found was I had signed up for a myspace account, which is purpose was to download our dogs pictures (whom passed away this past june) I had actually signed up with my dogs first name and her breed as her last.I didn continue with the registration process,  because i found it to difficult to upload the pictures. So i decided to download them at Flickers. Well since i never mentioned anything to him, and when he asked about myspace page i had completely forgotten i had actually signed up! he assumed i was lying. But, there was nothing vile or inappropriate! it was for my dog! So thursday night he decided he truly couldnt trust me, asked me to leave by sunday, (today) and I did. I have left home before, he has actually kicked me out before, but i knew it was just out of anger. But this time, we actually went to the bank, seperated our accounts, i picked up every single belonging i have, and left the keys. I dont know what to do. He is my everything. The funny thing is that i wouldnt change him for the world. But i cannot make him trust me, I have tried. I dont give him any reasons not to. I go to work, he picks me up. We spent all weekend together. There is no reason why he should doubt me. But he does. And i love him so very much, that i dont have eyes for another man. Now i sit here at my mothers house, in pure despair, trying to figure out what to do! I feel lonely without him, he is a part of me, he is my family! My mother says to give him time, that with time he'll realize the mistake he made, but im afraid he wont. Im afraid his insecurity will overpower his lover for me. Please what should i do?

20090222183726AAeNTdO	Family & Relationships;Family	Is it normal for grandparents to visit everyday for two or more hours?	I am married with 2 sons.  One or both of my parents visit almost everyday.  They will stay for 2 hours or more on weekdays and 2-4 hours or more on weekends.     I love my parents and i'm glad they want to spend time with my children.  However, it seems like they visit too much!  Is this normal?  Am I just being selfish?        I don't feel like I can have spontaneous fun time with my kids because we always have company.  I feel like I'm constantly being watched.  Growing up, I had to be a certain person to make my parents happy, and I still feel some of that pressure.        I know I need to talk to them, but I think it will hurt their feelings.  What can I do?

20090222184248AAgoZyu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I get this girl who has a boyfriend?	Alright, so there's a girl, let's say her name is Jane. Jane and I are really close. We talk all of the time, we trust each other completely, and we flirt a lot. But, she has a boyfriend. Let's say his name is Jack. Jack is a huge jerk to Jane - he used to tell his ex that he still loved her, but he just couldn't do that to Jane. But, Jack kissed his ex, and Jane found out. But all it takes for Jack to make Jane happy again is for him to give her some lovey-dovey speech about how sorry he is, and it's fine. He's always such a jerk to her. He gets mad at her for the stupidest things, but she's so blindly in love with him that she'd be willing to do anything to make him feel better.      Jane's been talking recently, about how much of a jerk Jack is. I always try to say that the things he does are rude, but she just wont dump him.      I really like Jane. How can i get her?

20090222185440AABdJKu	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do I come to the accept the very real possibility that he might not be there for me after his divorce?	We started off great. Calling each other and texting each other all the time. Lately he's been pulling away. He's been downsized and has no job (or phone) and he's going through the final weeks of his divorce - a process he was in long before he met me. We've been seeing each other since September.      Once it looked like we were moving towards a healthy loving relationship. Now he only has time for the gym, going to church on Sunday, looking for a job and an occassional call when he can to tell me he loves me.      He calls me every day (except on the weekends). I told him I'm not going anywhere and we would work through this together - well as much together as he will allow me in. He's very strong willed and wants to make it for himself.      Am I being a fool to wait and see what will happen to us when his divorce finalizes in April? I mean the way the relationship has been going, I'm just not sure if he's really into me or if I've become "just another problem" in a life that is already full.      I'm divorced (one year ago) and I've been through much of what he's going through right now. My last relationship ended in disaster as I couldn't take the stress of trying to figure out what was going on with it along with dealing with the final details of divorce, kids, etc.      I just don't want to be in yet another relationship where when there's nothing stopping us from committing to each other the guy dumps me - or worse yet just leaves me hanging in limbo.      Please offer me some advice that is encouraging and positive. I care for this man tremendously and want to have a loving, healthy relationship with him for many years to come.

20090222185947AA6YzdZ	Family & Relationships;Family	I need to leave town for my Grandmas funeral, but my school problems interfere. What should I do?	Ok heres the story.      This morning my Grandma suddenly passed away from a heart attack.      I was very close to my Grandma and so was my whole family, since she lived in the same small town as us with our grandpa.      We are having her funeral on Wednesday in a town that is   an 8 hour drive away.      I want to go really bad because this is going to be the first   time that I get to see all my uncles and aunts and cousins   in almost 4 years since they all live out of state, and I also   want to show my respect for my grandmother.      Here's the problem, 2 weeks ago I got bronchitis and ended   up in the hospital for a week and was out of school for 2 weeks.      I'm a freshman in highschool and   I am VERY far behind on all my schoolwork and I am failing   every class due to not being able to complete my missed work in time.      Friday is the end of the 6 weeks and me going to the Funeral   for 3 days will impair my ability to catch up in school and pass   for this 6 weeks.      What the hell do I do? I'm in a real bind here. I'm really stressed   out about this.

20090222190543AABapVg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I help myself feel sexy?	I've been dating my boyfriend for a year and a half and we have a great relationship. We're long distance, well, 2 hours and we spend the weekends together. Due to this, we usually have a lot of sex on the weekends. I am very happy with him. My problem is that I am overweight and he's not. He tells me how beautiful and sexy I am, but I have such low confidence from all the years of torture from people telling me I was ugly and rejection from men, that now that I'm happy, I can't even begin to think how my boyfriend finds me attractive at all. I don't know how he can look at me and not be disgusted, even though I know he thinks I'm sexy. It's just such a horrbile feeling, trying to hide under the blankets, trying not to get him to touch much of my stomach area. It's getting to the point where I'm not enjoying sex, just paranoid the whole time about how ugly I must look. I'm not whining and I myself think I am pretty, but I just feel so unpretty when I'm naked. Any ideas how I can try and overcome this? To the people who like to leave mean comments...Please, no mean or rude comments...I didn't say anything bad about you...

20090222204308AAGRL1S	Family & Relationships;Family	How can I get my dad to stop micromanaging my money?	I'm 19 and married. My dad is obsessed with micromanaging my money, and its starting to really get in the way of things.      I'm trying to become financially independent from my parents, but my dad keeps getting in the way.      For example, he bought me a car when I graduated from high school, which I contributed $1,000 towards. However, he put the car in his name. He keeps telling me that the car is mine, yet he refuses to transfer the title to me.      It's just really frustrating.       I know a lot of people would kill to have their parents still paying for things like their car insurance, but I'm trying to become independent from my parents and set up a life with my husband, and I feel like I just can't do that because the longer my dad keeps paying for things, the more indebted to him I feel.       He has some sort of deep mistrust for my ability to handle money, and I really don't understand why. I overdrew my checking acount when I was 16, and ever since then he seems to think that I'm frivolous and irresponsible and that I need him to baby me.       Everytime I go visit him, him and my mom start questioning me about how I spend my money, if I remembered to pay my rent, etc. It's ridiculous!      And every month my dad emails me a spreadsheet budget that I'm supposed to fill in with all of my financial information (like how much I made, how much my expenses were, etc) just so he can make sure I'm managing my money.       I can understand that he cares about my financial well-being, but this is just too much. Is it normal for a parent to micromanage their daughter's money after she's moved out and married?
20090222200731AAZmEuL	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I don't feel my husband loves me anymore....?	we have no time together and it seems i am the only one in this marriage that actually wants time together.  we have opposite schedules and we have talked about him changing his shift to daytime so we have more time together, but every time it comes up he gets mad at me and yells telling me his job needs him at night. i tell him but i need him at night with me, and I don't like to be alone every nite without him.  its easy to change his schedule to the day shift, but he seems so attached to his nite shift and his job needs over mine.        I don't understand why this is so hard anymore... i feel like he is putting his jobs needs over what this marriage needs to stay together.  its to the point that we are speaking of divorce.... I'm so tired of being alone that I just can't take this much more.  but this no longer feels like love to me, i don't feel love from him anymore... i just feel i have to compete with his job for his time now.  i feel unless he changes his work schedule we will never work...  since when did my needs come after his job needs?  i just can't figure out why he is so adament about his job and so reluctant about our marriage... i really feel like if he truly loved me then changing a simple work schedule would not be so hard... it would be easy because we come first.  what do you think?

20090222201720AA4nUtZ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why do people treat you based on their perception of you?	If you see a guy and he looks like a player does that automatically make him one. If you see a young lady wearing reviling clothes why not look at her as a woman with confidence instead of a slut no matter how bad or good she looks.      If you see a woman with 5 kids, do you automatically assume all of them are hers and she is living off of tax payers dollars (welfare). If you see a guy with tattoos does that automatically means he has a criminal record. If you see a white person talking slang do you automatically feel they are trying to "act black" as some would say when the reality could be, they are not acting, they actually grew up in a black neighborhood.      I am not saying your perception is wrong because it may be very right all I am saying is, until you get to know the person why have a perception at all. A person should not be guilty until proven innocent.      Men and women how many people have you looked over based on YOUR perception?

Does it really matter who [either the husband or wife] is in the mood for lovemaking?  The reason I ask, is because sometimes my wife is not in the mood to make love.  Its take approx.  4 or 5 days for her to recharge up and I wonder, if I should wait until she is ready or do it anyways or does not matter. Just curious how other married couples go about this!

20090222191734AA7LHFP	Family & Relationships;Friends	Do they deserve to be your friend?	Not everyone deserves to be my friend, and this probably applies to a lot of people out there. To be my friend, they have to be   1. Realistic: I cannot have friends that joke around ALL the time and talk about unrealistic goals.   2. Same social class: It's difficult to have friends that doesnt meet up to the same financial situation. I've dealt with this before and the class difference naturally broken us apart. When I wanted to go out, she couldnt because she didnt have money to.   3. Be mature. I dont even need a description for that   4. Have goals in life. I want a friend who has goals in their life. I want friends that gets to places and not just become hobos   5. Be outspoken: I cannot stand people who are totally introverted. I just wanna like speak out for them!!! I like people who can speak their mind and stand up for themselves in necessary situations.    6. Hygeinic: I can't have a friend that smells like B.O,!    7.

20090222204852AARq3TP	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Wedding dress? Love handles?  *pic*?	I'm overweight a bit, but my waste is high (pretty much the same place the dress tapers in on the picture)...but then after that it all goes to crap.  lol  Maybe not THAT bad, but I do have love handles and big hips/butt.      This can be custom sized ...do you think if I bought a slimming underwear to maybe smooth out the handles this dress would work with my body type.  I'm either worried it will point out the love handles or it will make my hips look even huger.      Thanks        http://i23.ebayimg.com/04/i/001/29/a1/90...          This is the 2nd one I've liked (I'm pretty picky & on a LOW budget)    http://i.ebayimg.com/07/!BMRgd0gBGk~$(KG...       But I'm now sure I like how it would lay.....
20090222192754AA8OYTU	Family & Relationships;Weddings	K, so what would you do...?	Okay I'll try to make this as short as possible. I'm getting married June 6, 2009. My mother is the one walking me down the aisle and giving me away and until now has been there every step of the way in the planning process. She is giving me away because my "father" has not  been apart of my life since I was 15. I am now 22. Anyway, I have 2 brothers, one younger, one older. My younger brother just turned 18. My mother has had major problems with him over the past few years...he's been arrested twice, stole her car, stole money from her, had several pregnancy scares with the 15 yr old girl he was banned from seeing by my mother, her mother, and the police. He dropped outta high school half way through his senior year. Plus, he just has an all around crappy attitude. He just left for Air Force basic training almost 2 weeks ago. I have been there for him and tried to help him as much as possible. I gave him my car when I got a new one when I could have saved myself money and traded it in. But, I tried to help. (within a little over a month, he totaled it). Well, he and I aren't speaking right now...long, long story...basically he acts just like my father does...I dont matter at all and im not worth anyone's time and blah blah blah. I dont  need that in my life, im about to get married and we have 2 wonderful little girls to raise. Well, back to the point. My mom just got done spending well over $1000 to go to Texas in April to see him graduate. Whatever...I understand fully supporting your children and being there for them no matter what, I dont expect nor want anyone else to share my feelings towards him. Now, she has told me she refuses to buy a dress to wear for my wedding...to walk me and give me away...and that I would just have to deal with her wearing jeans and get over it. Plus, the one thing she wanted to buy for me (me and my husband to be are paying for the wedding) was my guest book n pen. Now she doesn't want to. Plus, she has to take unauthorized time off of work, almost a week, for my brothers graduation, so she has already been told she cant have off for my wedding now. But, she claims she'll figure it out. I know how the people that she works for are...they will tell her either your here that day or dont come back. And she's not gonna risk getting fired. To be a bit more clear on my relationship with my mother...til now it was awesome. She has always been my best friend as well as mother. She has been the one constant in my life...the one person always there for me and supporting me no matter what. I, as well, have been there for her as much as humanly possible. When everything was happening with my brother, I was the one she would turn to for support and comfort and just to talk and vent. We would always go out shopping or to a movie or just to lunch. We were as close as could be. Now, I feel like I don't matter and that the biggest day in my life now means nothing to her because her "baby" is in the Air Force and all that jazz. Dont get me wrong, I'm not saying she shouldnt support him or be there for him, cause she should. I dont want her to choose between any of us. But how is it that just because he might finally be cleaning up his act, that I am absolutely nothing??  She doesnt even wanna talk to me hardly any more. I am so torn because on the one hand...I dont want anything to ruin me and my fiance's day and I wanna marry him and spend my life with him more than anything. On the other...out of all the people on our guest list, my mother is the one person I NEED to have there...and I am quite convinced she wont be. I dont know what to do or how to feel, other than to just cry. I cant even talk to her about it cause she will put me on a huge guilt trip and make me feel horrible for feeling the way I do. So, all that will accomplish is making me feel 50 million times worse than I already do. Any advice? What would you do? How would you feel? Im sorry its so long...

20090222201910AA97Zze	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Do I have a right to be mad at her?	Hi I need an outside perspective on this situation. My "friend" and I went to a party one night. There were about six guys and one girl there. I was really upset because I had been cheated on and got super drunk (the drunkest I have ever been) I ended up getting sick and a guy took me into the bathroom and took care of me. He then put me on his bed, where my friend was laying. I got sick again and she left, leaving me alone with the guy. He asked if I wanted to have sex but I said no. He left but came back 5 minutes later and asked me again. I was so drunk at that point that I didnt know what I was doing and said yes. We only did it for about 10 seconds before I told him to get away. He left and another guy came in and cuddled next to me. I told him that I wasnt gonna sleep with him so he left. The next day i found out all the guys were calling me a hoe and my "friend" didnt even stand up for me. Whats worse is that she didnt even apologize and kept going back to party with them! I am not talking to her anymore and feel really betrayed. Am I right for feeling this way?
20090222194945AA54O9t	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How can I gain self confidence?	I have some serious self esteem issues, always have since I was little. So many people tell me I am beautiful but when I look at myself in the mirror, all I see are imperfections. I see my body as fat and full on cellulite, even though people tell me I have a "hot" body but I dont see what they are seeing. I recently got out of an emotionally abusive (and my first serious) relationship and have put up with it for so long because of my insecurity. I think I give off a vibe that I am emotionally weak because so many guys want to use me for their own pleasure.  Please help! I really need to gain self confidence.

20090222202210AAXx7Jk	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Did i really get married? i mean can we get a divorce or need to.?	back in 2004 i got married to a monster. excuse me but i did. it turned out to be one of the biggest mistakes of my life. anyway, long story short. when we got married, our "witnesses" didn't have their documentation with them.    so our judge told us we wouldn't have to go during the following week with them to put their information in. well we never did follow up on it. anyway, we received a letter which said if we didn't do something we would not be married. well, we called about it, and they said that the letter was mailed to us late and that the expiration date had elapsed. she(the lady who married us) said to not worry about it. so we have been "married" for the last 4 1/2 years, but now we are seperated and are going our own ways. is there a way that i can find out if we are really married? and if I can get a divorce and what will i have to go through or need?

I just found out I am pregnet. I know my husbands the dad. I am over the boyfriend. I want him to get out now that I am prego. I cant have a baby in this situation. My husband said that he is a part of our family and that it will be ok. Do I need a divorce? I dont want to have a disterb child! Tips? Or Ideas?         I know getting prego was a bad choice at the time but God choose me to give this baby a life so Any ideas about the living situation?
20090222194453AAEk8n1	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is it wrong for me to disagree with how my husband wants to build his credit?	Okay we have 3 girls under the age of 4. Only one person working outside of the house. We get disability for the twins we have because they were born premature. Which adds up to 1300 a month. Husband makes 1200 a month. Combined it is 2500 a month. He has bad credit. He wants to take our tax return & pay off his remaining hospital bills then get a 5000 car so he can pay off the car in a year. We already have a van we have to pay 300 for a month. Plus 90 for insurance. So that will make our bills even more considering he will be paying 200-300 a month for his car plus insurance. He says he doesn't want to buy a car straight up because it wouldn't have a warranty on it. But most warrantys only last a year anyway. Even if they do they don't cover everything. I liked his first idea of getting a 2500-3000 car paid off so he can drive it to work instead of our gas guzzling van (even though he wants to get a gaz guzzler anyway). Is there any other way he can rebuild his credit? He is paying off his hospital bills. He has bills in his name. If you add in that the 3 girls we have are still in diapers plus baby food because the twins are developmentally delayed & can't eat solids well yet. Food for ourselves & the electricity bill (400) which has gone up this year because of the economy(was 100-200). Not to mention our rent (400) & cell phone (150). I just don't think it's a good idea for him to go about rebuilding his credit by this route & potentially destorying mine any further than he has. How can he rebuild his credit?

20090222193435AA1BY4k	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I dont know what to do about my boyfriend!?!?!?	My boyfriend and I were not that serious about each other when we first met. When we met he had a girl and I had a man. We worked at the same place and eventually broke up w/ our ppl and started talking to each other. Like I said we weren't that serious and would stop talking for months at a time. One time in particular we stopped talking for about two months.       When we began talking again he told me he slept with a girl from our old workplace (neither of us works there anymore). Now this girl always made it clear that she wanted him. She even knew that we were talking and she came up to me and told me how much she liked him. I was so upset and told him that day what she said. He then told me he would never like a girl like her...      Now when he came and told me this I was so angry I wanted to break up with him but I eventually forgave him.      Its about 2 years later and I went on his myspace and saw that he was having little side convos with her. It was nothing serious, but he was still talking to her. I confronted him about it and he told me she was calling him and he would tell her to stop.      Today we started talking about her again.. Or rather I started talking about her again (I guess im not over it) and he started getting upset and having a " i dont really care" attitude..      My question is how do you think I should react/ confront him about this situation? I dont think he is cheating but I really hate to think about him having sex with her ( it makes me sick)      I have an ex that aways use to have that attitude and it obv didnt work out. It just hurts me to see him have this attitude      I dont know what to even think anymore... this situation is making me sick      Any mature advice would be appreciated    Thanx for reading I know its long

I have searched on facebook, but there are only 4 hits that come up with her name, so I sent each one a message and am waiting for a reply. Are there any other ways of looking up long lost friends besides myspace and facebook? Would my elementary school still have records of her?

I am trying to help her grow up a little, by not getting her kid makeup.       i am really stuck on what to get her.   i know she has huge problems with her hair, but everything i reccommend she says no.   she seems to not want to listen to me which upsets me because i am her bff.   so please help me.....no clothing. or i am trying to avoid giftcards...      also she gave me a card and we had this picture we pass back and forth but i had it in my binder (i am usually very responsible with my stuff) but it must have fell out and that picture was in it. i feel really bad to tell her i lost her card and the pic, but she expects me to put it in her bday card, so what should i tell her, w/o her yelling at me?
20090222192858AAvsKnG	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Now what....should I leave now?	So he had a long affair with the UGLY, I mean ugly girl at his work. Supposed to be over and with the economy he can't really find another job, of course he hasn't really looked. We have been getting along the best we have in 10 years and been very close. Friday I show up unexcpectedly at his work. He is on his way out the door, but there she is standing right next to him...hugging close. I feel like I had just missed something. When he first came back home in October, I heard him tell her he was coming home because it was the right thing to do, to work onhis marraige. Is he only here because it is the right thing to do, but in love with her? He says she was only next to him because she had some paperwork to give him, could be true, but seeing them that close made me sick. I went back and confronted her and she just smuggly smiled and said she didn't want to be in the middle of this. BS, she said that before. What now?

She always tries to turn everything into a dramatic stituation. Also, she has a boyfriend, and she knows I've liked this one guy for a while, yet she totally flirted with him right in front of me. She was like "Bob [name has been changed, haha] *throws her shoe* will you pick up my shoe for me? Please? Please? *giggles obnoxiously*" Bob does nothing. My friend turns to me and says loudly, "Will you tell Bob to pick up my shoe for me? GOD, he's being sooo mean!!! *giggles*"   I got so mad at her, but she didn't get why. Riight. Do you think she was being horrible or am I just imagining things? I'm kind of insecure and she knows it, so why would she flirt with the guy I like? wtf :|

She never came out on my birthday... She said she was going to, but then just ignored my calls.   She never got me a gift for my birthday.   She invited me to her birthday, but asked me to pay for my own hotel room, which I have no problem with, but I'm not invited out, she expects me to hold her her drunken *** out from drowning in the toilet. (Mind you every time she drinks, she get SMASHED and I have to take care of her. The one time I was puking and she was sober, she didn't help take care of me, I took care of myself.)   She had friends over for drinks at her house last weekend, and didn't even invite me.   Since she started dating this new guy, she's basically blown me off, and I don't see her much.      AND SHE IS SUPPOSED TO BE ONE OF MY CLOSEST FRIENDS!!      I'm not asking if she's a true friends or anything... Cause I still love the old her, and I know she'll be back to the normal her after she breaks up with the jerk she's seeing. And I'm not planning on going  to her birthday, I mean I'm not her mother, I don't want to take care of her drunk *** again, while she's puking on me... Just if I should get her a present?

20090222203324AAwJaFu	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Question about a friend and divorce...?	This married friend complains about his marriage all the time, I hear about it from others and him and finally I just said why did you even get married? He's like I dunno.....I already got that far. After he got married his wife didn't want kids and he wanted many and this was an agreement on both of them that they'd have a big family. I can understand where this would hurt him then. He said he wants to get divorced but can't afford to. If you really wanted out should money even matter? He said he couldn't afford child support and alimony on top of his bills he already has. At first it made sense, then he continued on complaining about his wife. I hardly ever see them together and he doesn't seem happy. Is this a logical explanation or is this just a guy venting about his marriage?

I am doing a little project where I am putting candy hearts in empty prescription bottles and giving them to my friends. I am getting this idea from a picture I found and the label originally says:        Rx Amigo's    Apothecary      Friendship Vitamin "B-1"       Use daily to make others feel better. May cause happiness.      I just think that sounds to corny and I want it to be more like an actual prescription label (like side effects and stuff). So anything better than what it had originally would be great! Thanks!

Next day he apologized for the crappy date and movie and told me he was really shy and he had a good time going out with me. We began to text a lot the next day and got to know each other better.

20090222200923AAWQR82	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I like this girl...and ive liked her for 5 years. PLEASEEEE HELP!!!!?	I've liked this girl for almost 5 years and its getting crazy. She's completely isolated from everything......Everything. Apparently she liked me a while back and last year too. But I've sort of given up but it's killing me. I either need to forget about her or make it happen. any ideas on how to??? I'm completely lost. (I'm 13)      We also went out for like 3 days until her parents found out we were dating and we had to break up. And by isolated I mean no phone, I.m., doesn't go out to barmitzvahs even though she gets invited to them (shes also in a completely different group then me)... And it's impossible to talk to her.... Because I'm way to nervous. Also I'm not shy around girls. Just her         And almost 3 times a day we make sorts awkward eye contact and where ever I look she's right there. I'm also getting mixed information from my friends...One saying she always stares at me.... And one who said that she wud never go to the dance with a boy. And another one of my friends thinks I'm In love but I mean I'm young... Who falls in love when they are 13? But I do like her a lotttt. And none of her friends are friends with my friends. Also I have been really nice around her. For example she was In my gym class last week and I was helping a kid with special needs and talking to him when she was there. Last thing is that she is always with her friends who are not really guy friendly. So I am stumped.      She knows I like her. I know I should just ask her out but I can't. I need to talk to her and I don't know how. My best friend that told me she stares at me all the time is friends with her.... any good ways of talking to her in school when im with my friend?

I would rub various things against It, not knowing what i was doing. I Soon Became addicted. Always havingg the urge to keep doing it. would never penetrate, just rub. It just felt good.   Now ten years later, my sex drive is EXTREMELY high. i would be very satisfied with 4-6 times a day. Me and my boyfriend used to have sex 6-7 times a day, and over the route of 7 months, it has reduced to once ever 2 or 3 days if im lucky. I don't think that i should need it this much.   Also there is not a time i have experienced an orgasm inmy lifee. but i would like to experience it one day.    I believe im too sexual for my own good. when i don't get sex when i want it i become very mad and depressed. It keeps me happy. But my 24 year old boyfriend who i live with does not have the need to have sex all the time like i do.    I do not master-bate,all thoughh i have tried a few times, but it has done me nothing, its very frustratingng, can someone hel me?

20090222195142AAEtrKh	Family & Relationships;Family	My father who is now aged wanted his kids to take care of his property?	My father who is now aged wanted his kids to take care of his property, because of his ill health he decided to transfer title of a property to me and my brother less than a year ago, since we are the only ones of 5 siblings who is unattached and is able to travel to care for the property. Since then my brother who is a recovering drug/alcoholic fell off the wagon and had a relapse. I am very scared that he may do something foolish and sell his half of the property for drugs, since his name is on the title deed. Is there any legal recourse I can use to pronounce him unfit and have his name remove from the deed? My father is aware of the mistake to have my brother’s name on the deed and is in full support of whatever we can do to rectify the situation, i.e. if my brother does not volunteer to remove his name willingly.

20090222210204AABdZzS	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Am I over reacting about my husband talking to his ex?!?	I've been married to my husband for 4 years now. While we were dating he introduced me to his "first love" (that cheated on him) that lived in another state, with whom he says is now a friend. In my eyes every time I walked away from him, she would get closer to him, which made me weary of her. I voiced my concern to him, and he said it was nothing. After being married a year, he confessed to me, that she was wanting to get back together with him. After that I started freaking out a lil about him talking with her and then decided he married me and not her for a reason. So recently she moved back to the town we live in and started back conversing with my husband, and he has told me lies about who was messaging him, hiding that he has talked to her.  I feel disrespected about the whole issue.  Would it be wrong for me to ask him to cut off all contact?

20090222201536AAVTbNU	Family & Relationships;Friends	How to get over a badly ended friendship?	Over six months I ended a relationship with a close college friend that had become extremely painful for me, and in my opinion poisonous for the both of us.      She was a best friend and practically a sister for most of my time while we were in college. But our senior year was so tense between the two of us nearly 75% of the time and I finally called it quits after she called me out on ignoring her once we had graduated. I was a coward not to admit my uneasiness about staying friends with her earlier. I'm learning to confront my problems better.      I wished her all the best in her life, a life away from mine. But I'm constantly obsessed with knowing how she's doing because I'm always afraid she's gonna show up and try to tear my life apart. She's not really a vindictive person, I'm just paranoid and want to know I haven't ruined hers.      I also can't get over some of our past problems. Even though we've gone our ways and she's cut ties with me permanently, I still dwell on the things she did with a horrible passion. I want to move on and I'm trying hard to create a life where she doesn't continue to influence how I go about life and how I perceive others. Even my fiancé admits that she haunts me.      How can I finally get this obsessed guilt and anger over and done with and quit letting the memories pull me down even when she's not here?

Every time we fight he pushes me and does it with a big hate as if i was a piece of trash, even if my son is there he doesn't care.  sometimes i feel i can't do anything becuz i don't work i depend on him. the reason im not working is cuz i want to educate my son n be with him. I dont trust no babysitters. everytime he hurts me i feel less love for him. I wish we can end in good terms without involving police but how? any good advice?

20090222201407AABteoU	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Should I break up or not? I like her alot but this sucks?	Ok I know im supposed to be supportive and tough but here it goes. She is in nursing school during the week and works at walmart during the weekend. She lives 80 miles north of me so this is a long distance relationship. I graduate college in May and we'll probably scatter to where ever I can get a job. We see each other on average once a month. I know some people have it worse but that doesnt make my situation any easier. I really like her I do I really like this girl but she's in nursing school and works. SHE DOES NOT HAVE TIME FOR A RELATIONSHIP WITH ME. So should I stick it out and hope for the best (she has a year left in nursing school). I do not feel like her boyfriend. I feel neglected and single but I cant get mad at her cause its not her fault. I can't help feeling this way because of our so few together times and I'm not going to fall in love with this girl this way so any advice please. Im 24 she's 22 I'm not sure if I'm designed for this kind of stuff. I see other fellas holding their girls hands all the time and having fun with them. I want more of that but right now its impossible with her and whats worse she only says "you knew this was going to be a long distance relationship". but it has nothing to do with a long distance relationship. She wouldnt have time for me even if I lived next door.

20090222203841AA6oHlS	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Need help from Mature adults....?	In my relationship, i feel some extreme emotional neglect. My partner has a childhood of abuse and has little to no skill in socialing, communicating, and listening. All these can be taught and practiced to become a better partner. Yet, I am feeling extremely neglected emotionally. I feel my cries and deepest pains that I express to him are ignored and ridiculed at times. He says I am making him responsible for my pain yet I am simply looking for some touch, care, and love. He is a very needing person. I almost feel like its never enough and that the amount of nurturing and love he needs will always be bigger than mine. I am hurting and I want to feel cared and loved.....

20090222204430AA5miuL	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Girlfriend Lost Passion?	Me and my girlfriend have been going out for over two years now. Last night, we had a serious conversation because times has been tough and she said that she is not passionate about me anymore. So I asked her to describe what being passionate is, and she said that to her, being passionate is making sure that I am pleased in every way possible. She said she's lost the motivation to make sure that I am happy.       My question is how should I take this information that she told me?       She further went on to say that even though she doesn't have that passion for me, that she does in fact love me. She said she loves me for my qualities, which include my passion towards her. I feel that it's sort of selfish in her part that the thing she likes about me (passion), is the thing she can't show back to me. She said she would not want to break up with me because she knows qualities in me that she couldn't find anywhere else.      Our conversation didn't end there. She later told me that a reason she isn't passionate about me is that things about me that annoys her (we live together). She also feels that she wants more freedom from me and to spend less time together; which in these past few days I have given her. She does seem happy about that so maybe that is a reason for it.       This issue has also influenced our sex life. She said that most of the occasions that we have had sex in the past 8 months (which we've only had sex maybe once every two-three weeks), she did not honestly want to do and only felt obligated to make me happy. For example, she only had sex with me on Valentine's Day because it was Valentine's Day. This comes as a huge shock to me because she always makes it seem like she enjoys it; but how can one enjoy it when they haven't honestly wanted to do it?       So basically I have a lot to take in right now and evaluate. Does anyone have any suggestion on what should be my next step? I love her a lot and appreciate and enjoy every moment with her, but I don't know if we are "meant" for each other.

20090222205650AAmwhd5	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Husband assaulted me, I was granted an OFP and I'm going to divorce, 24 hour helpline?	I'll try to keep this as brief as possible.  My husband has always been controlling over me and was physical a couple of times, though he made me think that it was my fault and I brought it on.      A week ago, he had been drinking all day, and I begged for us to do something as a family (with our 2 small boys).  So, for evening dinner, we visited some friends.  He insisted on driving and was all over the road and i was scared for the kids and me.  i stated this several times.        So on the way home i insisted on driving.  Long story short, he got upset, grabbed me by the throat, while I was driving, then kicked me out of the car.  it was very cold, i did not have a hat, the road was remote and it was dark.        Long story short, someone drove by and encouraged me to report so he was charged with felony domestic assault by strangulation and 3rd  degree DWI (because he drove with the kids in the car).      So he has a criminal case going, but I also filed an Order for Protection to keep him away from us and also to get child support and spousal maintenance (I'm on Social Security Disability and I attend school, so I should qualify for spousal support).      We have talked divorce many times, and he had almost filed once, but then we had our good times too.  Overall though, he in general treats me like a slave; a cook, a housekeeper, a nanny, and a piece of property.  It hurts because he is so nice and generous with his friends.      We live in a very small town so we've really had to avoid each other and he is either related to or is friends with most of the town.  I feel very alienated and alone.  I don't want to burden people to talk about this (like with my friends) and a lot of my friends would be put in the middle because they know both of us so well.      I feel I have no choice but to divorce him, that is not a question.  But it just hurts so bad.  I want to be with him, the good version of him.  I realize that i'm in love with his potential of who he could be and not who he really is and I know that he will not change and i know that I cannot change him.      But I can't help but to want him here with me.  I can't help what my heart thinks.  My head says something different, and that's what I'm listening to, but how can I make this not hurt so much?  I want to call him so badly, which of course I can't do.      I am in therapy, but i wish there was someone i could talk to right now.  is there some number i can call?  I'm only aware of crisis suicide hotlines.        I have so many different emotions, I don't think he even really gets what he did.  He does have an alcohol problem.  I'm starting to ramble, does someone have anything to say to make me feel relaxed enough to at least sleep for the night?

We didn't talk for 2 weeks once, and all he could say is "Omg, it seems like we haven't talked in forever. Its great to talk to you again". And the other day we were talking about friends, and he said "I only have one or two girls I call that close friends, and you're one of them. But that's only when you're not mad at me ya know ;-) " I mean seriously, even a cute moment he had to ruin. Ughhh, what is his problem?!?!

20090222214053AAwKmvg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would you wait........?	I've been dating my boyfriend for about 5 months. We have both fallen in love with each other. We get along so well and everything is going so good. Lately he's been pushing me away...and he told me today that he has to go away for 14 months, 12 at the least. When we first started seeing each other and hanging out we both agreed to just be friends (because he thought he might be going away, but wasn't sure), but it evolved into something much more beyond our control.       I dated someone for 4 years...so I know what love is and I know 5 months isn't a long time to be with someone...but i know he's worth it.      I want to wait for him...he said he doesn't think he could deal with it though because he would go crazy not knowing where I am, or be able to protect me and be there for me.      I'm sort of conservative I never imagined being with someone like him and wouldn't like to tell people my boyfriend is in jail...but I really want to wait for him, I love him...I don't think a year is that long, and it would give me time to focus on finishing school and getting a job, etc.       What would YOU do....?

20060713081950AAEPmk9	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Was I wrong for telling my BF of 1 1/2 years to go back to Denver, CO?	We have lived together for 4 months and last month we had an issue were he was missing his girls (2 ages 9 & 13).  Well he ended up getting them for the summer and now they were due to go back home next month and he is back on I will miss them thing.  He told me it wasn't me, but him and that maybe he should not be living with someone.  I've supported him since he came to CA for CO and even bough him a car, now he wants to bail.  I told him to just go back now because next month it will be the same thing and the month after that the same and I don't have the time or the energy to deal.  He accused me of not getting things for the house when we are out like I use too because he girls are here and my 6 year old son is not(visits his dad 2 weeks out of month).  But I told him its because he has a job and if he sees we are out of someting he should go get it!!!  Last month after he apolgized we agreed to work it out, well now I don't even want to try its not worth it to me. Am I wrong ?

20060713093616AAZUp08	Family & Relationships;Friends	Let the family know or not?	I will soon be getting married and wandered if I should tell and invite my family?  See everytime my family gets together there's always some mess and a lot of them I don't really care for but I love them because they are family.  I am like the youngest left and both of my parents are gone on and they on the flip side used to worry about my happiness and being alone.  But here lately they always put everything down that I do (which for the most part are positive things) and say that I think I'm better than everybody else.  But I don't feel that way but since I don't date a family friend anymore they don't let me bring my new guy around because the family friend may be there and all that.  Just like I said it's always something...but I would feel bad if I really didn't invite them or tell them.  A little confused about this...what do I do?

20090222213152AAtGHsM	Family & Relationships;Friends	What is more important? My health or the need to fit in?	I go to a college -like institution and I am generally shy and quiet. I hang out with the people in my class and when we are outside I make attempts to talk and laugh with them.  I think I am going to start hanging out by myself now because most of them are excessive smokers. I REALLY cannot stand them smoking around me because I am quite health conscious and it is horrifying to read the effects of 2nd hand smoke. The Doctor even told me my recent sore throat was caused by inhaling toxic chemicals found in cigarette smoke. However I really do want put some effort in to making friends. I dont want to appear as this social misfit or dodgy person who hangs out by herself at lunchtimes. And it would be laughable if I told them not to smoke around me simply because why would they listen to me? Im not really the "dominant one" in the group. What should I do?

20090222214647AAF7shN	Family & Relationships;Family	My mum says I won't be able to get a good job if I go back to college and graduate at 26?Any thoughts?	THANKS FOR SPENDING A FEW MINUTES TO READ MY QUESTION. I REALLY NEED YOUR HELP AND APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE **********      I am 23, male. I have been studied science in an Australian university for 1 year. My parents want me to be a biological scientist but I am not interested in science at all. I didn't do well and finaIly I droped out from the course :( . My university counsellor suggest me to go back to Hong Kong (my hometown) and discover my own interest before I go back to study in Australia. Back in Hong Kong, I am living with my parents and I share the rent with them. The rent is about US$ 900 per month. Dad, mum and I pay US$300 each. My 20-year-old younger sister lives with us as well.However, she doen't pay anything.      Recently all my family members suspect I am gay. They ask , " I'm sure that you drop out from your science course because you are homosexual. Ewww! Everyday they say unplesant things to me ( e.g. I hate you so much, I'll never forgive you, You should turn back to heterosexual, I wanna beat you up because you are gay, All gay men are worse than sh*t, including you ) I face their bad words everyday in addition to having an academic failure, I went back to my room and closed the door and cried. Then sister say I am not allowed to close my room's door. " You need to have your room door opened all the time, including when you are crying. What's the point of closing the d*mn door? Have you ever considered my feelings?You know what? I have been tolerated your gayness for a while!" My parents are always on her side. They say" Listen to *your sister, you f*ggot" My parents also say " Why can't you get along with us well? If you can't get along with us well, it means you can't get along with your schoolmates and colleagues as well. You are a big loser !" My sister, who is studying to be a counsellor, says " Why are you so defensive about yourself? Why don't you loosen up yourself and date women?   " I replied "I have tried to date a girl for 3 months. But finally I've found that it doesn't work. I don't want to cheat the girl and say "I am straight" anymore. I don't want to hurt the girl. We broke up. " I added " I am proud of being gay". My sister replied , " You're so defensive about your homosexuality therefore no counsellor on Earth can help you. "       I also said , " I dropped out from science course because I have no interest in it at all. Mum, My dream is to be an successful accountant, not a scientist ."      Question 1) Which one do you think is better? Get my accounting degree in Australia or work in Hong Kong ? "You are 23 year old laready."  My mum said " If you study full-time in Australia for 3 more years , it mean you will lose 3 years of work experience. When you graduate with an accounting degree at the age of 26, no one will hire you again because you are too old at that time. And you don't have much full-time job experience . You will not able to find a good job because employers tend to employ younger people, with the same qualifications as you  " However, I really wanna go to Australia , do my favourite course and stay away my parents. Will I be less competitive in the job market after 3 years ( because my graduate age is 26 , which is older than an average graduate ) ?      2) Mum said " I have spent lots of money on your high-school education. Why are you still so stupid? Your IQ is lower than an average people. Why do you enrol the part-time clubbing DJing course? You know the clubbing DJ working environment is so nasty. You will be surrounded by drug dealers, prostitutes and manwh0re . Some one will put drugs into your pocket. Then police raid you and prosecute you. If you work part-time as a clubbing DJ, it means you don't love yourself! You are such a loser! Shame on you , j*rk! "      I feel depressed after hearing this. Is my mum correct or wrong ?

20090222213202AA6FwxZ	Family & Relationships;Family	My cousin JUST died & i didn't cry.....what's wrong w/ me?	Like literally i WATCHED MY COUSIN DIE @ 5:50 pm 2day. Of course i felt bad and got teary-eyed but that's about it. I don't know, maybe it will hit me later.       The only reason i can think of as to why i didn't cry was that i visited him at least 3 to 5 times during the whole time he was in there (october-until now).      Everyone knew he was going to eventually pass away because of his weight (he was at least 400 lbs), bad heart, and breathing complications, plus my mom even said he was gonna die in the hospital (how jacked up is that?) and she was the main one crying.      I'm just glad i was there see him before he did pass plus i'm REALLY happy for him cuz i know he's not suffering anymore.       another thing, my aunt passed away a couple of years ago and i didn't cry then (of course i did feel bad and dropped a few tears but nothing serious). i don't think i've ever cried when someone died.       Now watch, i bet when my child/best friend/husband dies i'm gonna be dropping buckets of tears and then everyone's gonna get mad and curse me out because i didn't cry when the other ppl died.

I have her number and we talk a lot in school, I haven't asked her out yet because I don't know if she likes me. She asks me to text her but she replies like i'm a pest. When she saw me with another girl, she showed signs of anger. Is she just toying with me or does she like me? I really like her but I don't know what to do because i'm afraid that she doesn't like me, she sends me very mixed signals.

20090222210229AAUIfB3	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	My boyfriend hit(s) me before, lately he hasn't, does this mean he never will again?	My bf and I have been togeter since high school (8yrs), I'm 23 and hes 24 (we been togeter since I was 15yrs old). The first few yrs of the relationship was rocky because we were young (still are but really immature then), as the yrs went on they got a little better. I can't even remember the first time he put his hands on me, but I can say it started off as a push, then later he choked me, then slapped me, punched me in my arm etc...one time he was being abusive to me in front of his mother...everytime he hit me he would cry to me and tell me how sorry he is and how he would never do it again...so, for months after that he hasnt put his hands on me, then suddenly in another arguement he did. This would go on for months, I think 2yrs now. I lived with him for 3yrs (I got kicked out my house and I lived with him and his parents) and thats when the abuse started. His parents would hear us fighting at night, and they never ever said anything to us about it. I don't live with him anymore, but we visit each other. The last time he put his hands on me was a few months ago when he attempted to choke me, but he stopped. Since then he hasn't put his hands on me, even when we get into arguments, he says he's not doing that anymore. Do you think its likely that he stopped hitting me all together, or is it because we don't live together anymore? How likely is it that he'd do it again?

20090222212058AAIPLrC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is my girlfriend telling me the truth behind this breakup?	Me and this girl became friends a little over a year ago. We became friends through my girlfriend at the time, but after things didn't work out, all three of us kind of went our separate ways. After the summer, and new school year, me and this girl started talking again. But, as the school year progressed, I began to have feelings for this girl again. So, coming to January, after really liking this girl for all of December and determined to tell her how I feel. I told her, but at the time, she told me really liked me too, but at the time couldn't do anything because she was being asked out by another guy. Well, after two weeks went by, we still talked, the last week of January, she told me how she felt (she liked me a lot) and it was the best conversation Ive ever had with her. So, I asked her out that Tuesday, and we started going out. Everything was going great! We talked, txted, had a great first kiss, etc etc. But, after a while, I noticed she changed, and it was the only second week of our relationship. Not talking to me as much, and I could feel something between us. Well, this wensday, me and her had a chat and she told me how she was too busy to be in relationship and she felt bad dragging me along. However, I was devastated by this and asked if we could still try and go out and I didn't mind with her being busy with school. Well, that following night, she im'd me and said that she couldn't be with me anymore for her being too busy! I dont believe her, and she still wants to be friends, she even txted me Saturday asking why I was mad, and why I was taking us breaking up to personally. Am I in the wrong for being upset over this? I really liked her so much, and I thought she liked me too. She maybe did, but can people just forget about relationships that easily? I really need help as to what I do, I want to get back with her some day and I don't believe her excuse of being too busy. I think she just doesn't like me anymore, making these past couple of weeks a giant lie, even though I knew they weren't.

I don't know how this started we were talking about music....not missing a beat there were no long pauses....she started talking about this....Im not afraid of commitment that's no what it is we've been together almost 3 months....its just Im 20 shes 18.....I had no time to respond it was im after im I put them together below...its like she whats me to agree on every single thing with her I had know way to change the subject...I felt like it was none of my business people are going to do what they want I don't like to talk about people like this ....this is condensed sorry if its to long   A:omg..not to change the subject or anything but this girl i know she got married and she's only 17   A: i can't believe her parents would actually sign for her and the guy she married looks like he's in his mid 20's that's pretty sick she could be pregnant or something wouldn't surprise me, i have like 5 or 6 girls on my myspace that are preg.   m:  oh really  thats weird.....crazy parents out there .....who knows   A: yeah   A: i mean if it was my kid and they were 17 there's no way i'd sign for them that is way way too young to be married i mean dang 50% of people who are married this day in time end up getting divorced it's probably more like 75% now  and she's only 17 so that's going to make things even tougher i doubt it will last   m: me niether.....thats crazy....yeah its sad its that high....who knows....  more power to em thats ludacris   A: yep   A: i mean i don't think it'll last it's hard enough for some people in their 20s and 30s to make it work how the heck does she think she can at 17 that's crazy i bet you they won't be together like 6 months from now   m: yeah who knows only time will tell   A: well it won't work i don't think  do you think it will   A: that's just too young to be married   m: I really don't know its none of my business.........I say good luck to them I wish them the best   A: but i mean in your own opinion do you think it will last   i mean if you were just to guess   m: seriously I wouldn't know I don't know the people....im not going to guess on it   A: its just a yes or no answer   m: I'm saying Idk know   A: i'm saying, from me telling you how young she is, you make a guess of if you think it'll last i mean..from knowing she's only 17, i'd say the chances are slim to none   m: with all the numbers I would guess not then.....but who knows stranger things have happend   A: yeah, but she's 17..i'm saying the fact she's so young would probably make you think it wouldn't last..don't you agree   m: I see what your saying I would agree with you for the most part.... I know of a few acceptions my uncle joel got married at 18 I know thats a year older but not much my aunt becky  too   A: yeah but that's different we're not talking about the same time   this day in time people are lucky if they make it to 2 years married   A: because its too easy to just walk out when things get tough, that's why i'm saying her marriage probably won't last firstly because she is 17 and second, when things do get rough in her marriage it would be easy for one if not both of them to just walk away from it   A: back 50 years ago or more it was common to be married at that girls age..and people stayed together a lifetime, because there was like no divorce rate back then, or if there was it wasn't anything like it is now. that's like my grandparents, they got married really young and stayed together, but that was a completely different time period compared to today   m: I know its a different times....well it just depends on the people even though it seems more likey it will fail....but really who knows    A: well..i'm saying, i doubt she's met the person she is supposed to marry yet   A: i mean you don't usually meet that person at 17 and stay with them for the rest of your life   A: you aren't even grown at 17   A: you have to grow up and experience things and i doubt she has enough   A: there are a few exceptions to that though like my brother and his gf..they've been together 6 years..and my friend Laura is engaged and she's been with her fiance like 5  years i think..but that doesn't usually happen..   m who knows.....its her life....good luck to her   A: personally if i was her i wouldn't want to be married at 17..i mean dang you have to enjoy your life a little

Boy friend of 10 years moved out said that just because he was moving to get away from some problems with my daughter ( drugs) he is 49 I am 50... He said he loved me and just because he was living somewhere else didn't mean our relationship was over.The night before he moved he said he was second guessing himself on what he was doing...I went to his apt the first night and a woman was there hiding in the bed room.. I shut the bedroom door didn't say a word to her...said to him and you have been telling me all week that you love me and if this is the biggest mistake of your life could you come back home...Said a few more things then left ... when I got home he was here at my house 30 min later trying to tell me it was someone from work he needed someone to talk to.. I wouldn't believe him... Now he is telling me he Loves me and wants to work it out between us and that there is no one and will be no one while we are trying to work it out... But I still have this feeling I can't trust him after that...and sit here at home wondering if she is at his place and is he lying to me ...And he tells me to come to his apt any time I want.. Told him tonight if this is the deal tell me so I can move on... That I deserve the truth and the respect...Told him I get this feeling every now and then he said I know and it is his own fault... What do you think

20090222210542AACQIlD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Relationship issue, please help?	I have been with my girlfriend for a total of 2 years now. We are happy together no matter what we do. We seem to be all the more perfect for each other everyday. All of our interests match up completely... all except for one.      We have not had sex yet. We have done pretty much anything leading up to that, but I think she has this idea of sex as it being something huge. I personally am a virgin, but I want to explore new things and take another step forward. We have talked about it on a couple occasions, but the conversation never got far.      Am I an idiot male just like anyone else and letting my junk think for me? Or am I wanting even more intimacy then what I currently have? Is it wrong to push her and persuade her to let us see how sex can give us another boost in our relationship?

20090222211528AAXGveH	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Wife Problem: Money Issues?	I am 26 years old, working abroad for more than 2 years now.  Ever since, my wife doesn't make any effort to monitor our cash flow that keep me puzzled all the time. As expected, NO SAVINGS. So, I made an initiative to establish a Monthly Budget Spreadsheet for her to fill-up (not for any other reason, but just to monitor our finances in order to save for our future). What shocked me most is her debts, she never mentioned the reason of lending such amount (Same scenario happened at least every 6 months). Now, I want to teach her a lesson : For 4 days now, I am not answering her texts and calls and I am planning to delay my financial support to let her realize the importance of money because we never know what's waiting for us in the future (emergency,etc.). Is it right decision? Last night, I receive an SMS from her saying, to find a better wife that knows how to deal with money and will not give me headache. Any advise will be fully appreciated.

20090222212839AAepV8p	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to make my ex realize what he lost and have them come back running to you...?	Ok this is a real unfortunate story about me...my ex and i went out for 4 years. He cheated on me many times, verbally abused me..., and took me for granted. He was my first love and boyfriend, i did everything for this guy from giving money, sacraficing everything, i could do anything to make him happy because i love him so much. I am 5'4'' and i weight 115 pounds. He wanted me to get in shape like models, compared me to all the girls...treated me like ****.... He went through a bad childhood so he would always take his pain and anger of his family on me...and i would let him so he would feel a little relief. I did everything to never back off from him letting himself down. hes doing bad in school and when he knows he is really smart. he smokes weed, drinks, and cigrettes which i hate having him to do that. I always felt like i was his mom...he completly emotionally controlled me...and i would fight for this...just so i can one day make him realize that i was the best thing in his life. He blames everything on me like how i dont understand him and doesnt make him feel better...like he says that his expectations from me are superior...and i am not. I ******* did everything to make him happy. i am a lot stronger now but still weak....enough to take him back if he cried. idk....he is dating someone right now...n several days ago he told me that he wanted to work things out with me...n today he told me that he wants to me just friends until him and the other girl doesnt work out..but things are good right now. He was like u can do whatever u want but as long as u still care about me like always...but u cant be with another guy. I told him goodbye that i hope the new girl gives him all he wants cuz i am leaving him. If things are meant to be with us...it will happen. I am so hurt and strong enough to be okay with this pain n kinda move on. I did not get anything back from this person.       I wasted so much time....i want him to realize what he did wrong....lost me was the biggest mistake....should i ignore him for a while cuz i never ignored him and always gave him attention. I want justice!!!! i dont deserve this...i pray to god each night asking y do i deserve this? Yyyyyy i find myself a beautiful person...then what was so big that i had to deserve this treatment? help me
20090222212926AAZEFBm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	3 Questions about Being Tied Up?	1. I am a sophomore in high school. I lift everyday, run track, am in all honors, and would consider myself pretty normal. I'm rarely ever pushed around in life and are usually kind of a leader. Is it weird to want to be tied up by a girl? Not anything extreme, just like hands and feet or something. I dunno, I just think it would be really cool to have a girl completly control me.   2. What are the chances that a sophomore girl who is really nice, always happy, and never bossy would want to tie up a guy?   3. How many normal, not emo, goth, bossy, or creepy, sophomore girls usually like to tie up a guy and control them?
20090222213001AAdDsZG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What does this mean?!?	I am always in weird situations when it comes to guys!  Here it goes...      I have been sleeping with my friend/neighbor for the past couple of months, but more often lately.  When I say sleeping, I mean LITERALLY sleeping, nothing else.  I have a crush on him, and I'm pretty sure he knows, or at least everyone else does, but I could be wrong.        This past week we slept together 3 times, and hung out 5.  Normally we never hang out alone, usually we're in groups when we go out or watch movies, but he normally asks me to stay over afterwards.  This past time he told me he wanted me to stay, and when I got into bed with him he put his arm around me and held my hand.  I don't really know if he likes me because he's shy and he never really has any signs I can pick up on, but I want to know if with him wanting me to stay over is part of him liking me or is it just comforting for him to have someone sleeping with him?  This can't be him wanting a booty call, because he never tries anything with me. Or is this just friends?
20090222213337AA4cHS9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	GUYS: How would you react to a restraining order?	I recently moved to a new state to get a "fresh start". There is a boy I like, and I know he is curious why. He doesn't know anything about my past, but I just told his friend that I have a restraining order against my ex-boyfriend of five years. I know he's going to run and tell. I was in a abusive relationship, but I hoping want to make it completely obvious from that detail (the RO). How would you react if you were my guy? Would you assume he was beating up on me? Would you be extra protective? Would you have sympathy or lose respect for the girl? Would you be concerned for the girl? Is that too much emotional baggage? Would you assume thats why she doesn't like to bring up her past? and moved away? Just curious from a guy's point of view... thanks :)

I was away in Mexico for 2 weeks, and I came home to find that my cat was declawed. I just got home yesterday, and he was declawed Friday. My step-mother kept bugging me to take him to get declawed, but I think that its cruel so I told her no! He has scratch posts, and I know he didn't claw her furniture. Anyways, my step mother was surprised at the fact that I was furious! Her reply was "Well, I paid for it!!" I DON'T CARE if she paid for it! He is MY cat, I bought him with MY money, and I take care of him. Now he's in pain and can barely walk without crying.. I feel awful. My step mother said I have no reason to be upset for. Am I overreacting or no?

20090222214751AASwsOW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My friends ex..except a little different..Please Help!!?	Well, Its been 2 months since my friend and her ex broke up..this guy, I'll call him "L"   L asks out alot of girls in my school..and in other schools too..Hes sorta known around town as the Player. But a girl named V went out with him. V's best friend was 'S"    S hated her best friend's boyfriend. She knew he was a player and that he would end up hurting her friend. but, before anything happended V moved away. So fast forward a couple of months, and L asks out S. No one expected her to say yes, but after some time and alot of prompting she said yes to him. She had alot of fun with him, and it was a good fling until she fell for him. and he cheated on her. She was heartbroken and dumped him. But after he convinced her (hes good at convinceing girls) she took him back.   Somewhere down the line, My best friend "S" , broke up with L, and went out with someone else....He was really angrey but 2 months later, he asks me out. Everyone has mixed reactions to this..they tell me he just wants a fling..and hes a player. I've sorta had a crush on him..not a big one of course. But anyway my best friend says that i should do whatever i want..but later on she tells me that hes probably going to end up hurting me and i really shouldnt go out with him. I told her that i wouldnt care if he hurt me, I still wanted to go out with him as a fling. She said that my reputation would get scrwed up and even she would not be comfterable with me anymore.   Although, shes given me good advice..Shes being hypocritical in my opinion,. because she herself went out with her best friends ex. And now when it comes to me, she tells me not to do it.   I know I can take care of myself..but i really dont know what to do..   I respect her but i wish she took a little consideration of how i felt.   Im thinking of saying "no" to this guy...but it seems like everyones gone out with him..I want that chance too..   Am I right in saying no when a part of me wants to say yes? does the never go out with ur best friends ex rule apply here?

I told him I valued the friendship too much and he said he feels the same, but I'm still worried that we'll be different from now on.      Does anyone out there have the same experience? What happened, and what should I do? Should I believe him that the friendship will stay the same?      ...help me.

If I were to ask my friends, they would all say what I want to hear, which is not what I need. He confused me, and I want to know what he means when he says that. Does he really like me? Is he sincere? Please help!

20060705082441AAFnVLH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Will he ever ask me or am i just being naive!!!!!!!?	My boyfriend is always talking about marriage with me. All his friends are either married or engaged or almost about to be engaged!  He tells me that everyone knows that we are going to get married and that he can't wait to be married and start a family.  I am 22 and he is 25.  However, everytime we talk about it he mentions the fact that he will only be married at 28 and therefore engaged at 27.  If i'm supposedly the one he wants to be with, then why would he have to wait so long in order to ask me!?!?  Is he just stringing me along? Am i being naive?  i'm not sure what to think.  Its not that i'm in a rush, i just dont understand what he's thinking or what he is rationalizing!!

20060817123459AAbGNtF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I ask out my ex-girlfriend? (please read)?	Ok. I have had my eye on this girl for the past three years. This last year, I was finally able to get to know her when I decided to make a short film. It was very close to the end of the school year and I finaly asked her out. We went out a few times, but it appeared as if I had acted too late. I decided to break it off because of the fact that I would be moving to Arizona in the middle of summer, in a few weeks. (I'm in Texas by the way) Well, things changed and i ended up staying were I am at. Well, I started going out with another girl during this time. During one of these dates with the new girl, I see my ex at an art exibit. And for some reason, I can't help but smile uncontrolably, and neither can she. I thought hard on wether or not I should go talk to her. I didn't, but i called her later. Now she is moving 30 min. away and the other girl broke up with me. When we were going out, we never were able to get close, so we technically never broke up. Should I persue her again?

Decidida a descobrir o que pensa e como se comporta o jovem brasileiro, a equipe do jornal “Estado de Minas” realizou uma série de reportagens. Com base em diversas pesquisas e entrevistas, ficou-se sabendo, por exemplo, que a maioria dos jovens, indiferente da origem social, se diz n?o-violenta, mas a metade já bateu em alguém. Recordam-se casos como o do índio Galdino queimado vivo em Brasília e de Suzane von Richthofen, a jovem rica que planejou o assassinato dos pais em S?o Paulo. Afinal, o que acontece com o jovem brasileiro nos dias de hoje? Por que os jovens cada vez menos ouvem os pais?
20070525061304AAeRRTR	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	O divórcio é uma praga?	Palavra suprema dos católicos de todo o mundo, o papa Bento 16 baixou, no início deste ano, a encíclica “Sacramentum Caritatis”, segundo a qual o divórcio do matrim?nio é a praga ou uma chaga do ambiente social contemporaneo. Ao mesmo tempo que a palavra vinha a público, o governo brasileiro sancionou lei facilitando a efetiva??o de divórcios no Brasil. Antes condicionados à morosiodade da decis?o judicial, os divórcios hoje, pela nova regra, s?o realizados, administrativamente, nos cartórios. E há cartórios que chegam a homologar 10 divórcios por dia. Para você, o divórcio é mesmo uma praga ou uma chaga como prega Bento 16?

20070601000601AApyOxL	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Aint as good as I once was?	I'm 23 weeks pregnant with twins, and have been feeling pretty insecure about my body changing (my first pregnancy). Then today my husband casually mentioned to me how my sister told him that my butt had changed. That I used to have a nice butt but now all I have is a "mom butt"! Then he said that he had defended me, then she called him a liar, because he hadn't disagreed to her comment....    I didn't say anything to either of them but I locked myself in my room and cried for hours. I just don't think that is something anyone wants to hear!! Its hard to recognize that you don't look the way you used to, but its harder to hear it from those you expect that would never judge you. I mean, am I overreacting?

20070620124159AAVBhPZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Pq é t?o dificil entender a masturba??o masculina?	N?o aguento mais meu namorado em sites pornograficos e de mulher pelada. Quando fui conversar com ele, ficou mto nervoso. E me expliquei dizendo que n?o me sinto bem, pois pq procurar tanto se já me tem. Ele diz que me ama, que é só imagina??o (tes?o). Aí perguntei se qdo ele se masturba pensa em mim, e ele me respondeu que n?o, disse assim na minha cara: "Se eu t? vendo a foto da mulher, é claro que t? tocando pra ela". Isso me ofendeu profundamente. Eu como mulher me sinto pessima, pq qdo me masturbo penso nele e ele n?o faz isso pensando em mim. Minha alto estima ta pessima, me sinto feia, incapaz, td de ruim.  Gostaria de uma ajuda. Vcs acham que eu estou exagerando, que estou levando isso mto a sério???   Por favor me ajudem!!!
