20090131110036AAoVHuX	Food & Drink;Beer, Wine & Spirits	Making your own liquor safely?	I have been researching how to make your own liquor.  One web site suggested pouring beer into a pot, heating that and cooling the vapors to create your liquor- this video explains it-        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htVKbrNS-...       Now I know that if heated at the wrong temperature, you will get methanol, which is poisonous, instead of the desired Ethanol. If you put a thermometer in the beer and waited for it to reach the temperature at which Ethanol boils and then attached the coil to collect the vapors, would that work and make it so you wouldn’t be capturing any harmful methanol vapors?  I do realize this is not exactly legal either.

Would it also contain Hawaiian-grown coffee?  Does it pay homage to Obama's presumed WASP heritage as well?  If so, by what kind of coffee beans would this aspect of his background be represented?      I have some coffee at home which I call "Obama coffee", because it is made of African-grown coffee beans.  It is store brand coffee nevertheless.  The coffee is called the Serengeti Blend, and the container has a picture of some animals that look like antelopes running across a plain.  Because the Serengeti Plain extends northward into Kenya, I consider it to be Kenyan coffee as well, and I have named it my Obama blend.  Come to think of it, Obama mildly resembles an antelope.

20090131130148AAnIz9O	Food & Drink;Ethnic Cuisine	Whole spices vs. ground spices in Indian cooking?	Are ground spices bought in plastic containers an acceptable substitute for whole spices in Indian cooking? Does not using whole spices have a noticeable impact on the flavor of the food?    Many Indian food recipes that I have found call for using whole spices, but many of the spices are difficult to locate or extremely expensive. I mainly just want to know if it is possible to make good tasting curries by using ground spices.

20090131125030AAubGRC	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	Perpetual vanilla question?	Hi. I am trying to make perpetual vanilla. I saw an ad for buying the kit in a catalog. It included a vanilla bean and and the buyer is supposed to supply the vodka. The ad said that you should place the vanilla bean in vodka and let it steep. Problem is it didn't say how long to let it steep before using it. It's been 2 days and it smells pretty good but...I suppose the longer it sits the better.   I used Bourbon Nature-Vanilla from Germany and Smirnoff vodka.    Any advice?   Thank you!

20090131113306AAhMolu	Food & Drink;Entertaining	How can I throw a great get-together?	I purchased a condo in October 2008. My boyfriend and I (21 years old) had several get togethers. All of them were a good time, but they were kind of interesting...at the time we had little furniture, not many places for people to sit... things were still in boxes.          I love all of my co-workers and I'd like to invite them all over again. Some people werent able to make it the last time. Theres a lot of them! and most of them will probably bring their boyfriends/husbands.    I have a couch that seats 3, a love seat that seats 2, and 8 chairs in my kitchen. I plan on borrowing a few folding chairs from family members after I know how many people will be here.          My condo is on the smaller side. Between the kitchen/dining room and living room, it wasnt too bad. But I'd like to wait until the spring to have this get-together so that I can put some chairs outside on our pattio. A little trick my mom used to do when we lived in smaller places was to set the drinks up outside to draw people out so that its not so crowded inside when people are trying to pour drinks and such.          Asside from actually having enough seating, what else do I need to make an enjoyable get-together for everyone??    Board game suggestions are welcome!!    I'm not great with mixing drinks, i have no idea what goes with what - so a "drink supply" list would be great...alcohol and juices that I could put out so that people can mix drinks.          Thanks!!

Its just average granule coffee, in an average mug.  No sugar, and a little milk.    I don't know why I drink so much...  Usually if I just want to sit down for 15mins and stop doing everything I'll have one.  And if my grandad comes over I'll have two just because he has two.

I just need to know how long to cook it using the alternative methods.      Thanks in advance.
20090225085941AAH70Ct	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	Looking for a tried and true turtle cake recipe?	I checked www.allrecipes.com, but those aren't the recipes I had in mind.  I don't want to have to melt caramels or chocolate - it would be so much easier to use the sauces.  Also I'm looking for a recipe that is 'pretty', with the sauces drizzled on top - instead of everything baked right into the cake.        Thanks!
20090131134713AA2xerE	Food & Drink;Entertaining	Need an EASY dessert that looks like a monkey (for birthday party)?	I thought about doing a monkey face cupcake with peanut butter cups, vanilla wafers, M&Ms, and a little red frosting for a smile but... even that seems like too much work.  I really want some VERY simple & quick- like making a "butterfly" out of a sandwich & a banana (cut sandwich into triangles, peel banana and stick it in the middle of the plate, arrange triangles like wings- done).  Anyone have any ideas on a similar thing that would be sweet (it's a dessert after all) and look like a monkey with a little creative placement?    Thanks!

20090131135225AAZ4xS2	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	What's the best way to cook baby back ribs in a rotisserie?	Hey folks,      I have the Showtime rotisserie and cooking baby back ribs.  I lost the cookbook that came with it though and have some questions.      I've read the best way to cook them is boil them for 20 min first, then add a rub, then throw in the rotisserie for 18 min, then apply heated bbq sauce and cook for another 2-3 min.      I've also read that you just throw a rub on them, rotisserie them for an hour, remove from rotisserie, and then apply heated bbq sauce and serve immediately.      I've also read that you just add salt/pepper, apply bbq sauce (not heated), throw them in the rotisserie for an hour, remove, apply extra bbq sauce and serve immediately.      What do you guys think?  Which is the best way to get the most flavorful and tender baby back ribs from a rotisserie?  Or, do you suggest a different way (still from a rotisserie though)?      Thanks!

I'm trying to order a large pepperoni pizza on Donatos.com. But when I go to choose my toppings, it shows cheese (none, single, double, 3x). And if I choose cheese, it charges me extra.       If I only choose a single pepperoni topping and select "none" for cheese, they'll still put cheese on the pizza, right? I know, stupid, but thanks.      P.S. Usually I just call, but I've got an online-only coupon.
