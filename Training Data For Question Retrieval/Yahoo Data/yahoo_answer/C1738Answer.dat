If people hear you, tell them "That was some explosion!" Isn't it better letting it out than keeping it all in?? LOL|`|6386e6946f5bb67469c5de93143e7fbbaa	LOL you can try lifting both your feet up in the air so no one will know that it's you who's causing the explosion in the stalls.|`|hHxJ0BONaa	hahahahaha! that is hilarious and sad! i would say to let it out little by little before the poop goes out.

No noticable change results in the colour or the consistency.<br>  <br>  Black licorice on the other hand is the recipe for green sticky sludge...|`|i7oHTo9haa	LOL I never understood how consuming something purple can make it green though?!  I haven't seen Grape Soda thing but it's probably true.  Grape Kool Aid makes it turn green too.  You can try that in concentrated form if you can't chug down 48 oz of Grape Soda.

a5c96f01ce98dccbbe83fee4b61edbd0aa	I agree with you all the way and THUMBS UP TO YOU!! I think I said that in one of the questions in here. It is very discriminating big time and very unfair to small business owners and the rich. They all worked to make what they have now without the GOVERNMENT's help! <br>  <br>  I tell ya, Obama really needs to step down. He is causing great harm with his Socialist behavior.|`|SIqFa1mzaa	I understand what you're saying, but if you earn $250k or more you shouldn't have too much trouble making ends meet unless you are living beyond your means.  You have a right to not like the idea though because maybe you worked really hard for that money.  <br>  <br>  People who earn little have a hard time paying the rent and everything else.  So it only makes sense they would pay less tax.  Imagine yourself maintaining a family on minimum wage.  That's difficult.  So I don't particularly see this as discriminatory.  It's just logical.|`|WVpqoupraa	America gives rich people the opportunity to earn that much money so in turn they need to give a small percentage back. A flat tax would discriminate against the POOR  because it would take a bigger percentage of their already meager earnings subjecting more people to poverty and lowering the quality of life for all Americans.|`|yVbguDvbaa	It's funny that this "discriminatory" stuff didn't come up when the wealthy was getting tax breaks while the majority of us where paying out the rear.

PWPLrUFZaa	It does make you think that we might be getting softened up for some big revelation. You wonder if the Govt put out this information to gauge public reaction and to watch for signs of panic.<br>  <br>  Personally, I can't believe, given the size of the universe, that we could possibly be alone. The real question is could any life-form, even with a billion years more evolution than our own, develop any system of interstellar travel? And what could that system possibly be?<br>  <br>  Aside from the above, you have to wonder what would happen to Earth's religions and the belief in god if we were contacted. I can't imagine that the fundamentalists of all persuasions would take the news well.<br>  <br>  As for whither the aliens would be good or bad, you have to remember that morality, right and wrong, good and evil are human constructs which could never apply to other beings, not even animals never mind aliens. So the chances are that we could never even understand their actions and would have no chance at guessing their motives or even if any of these terms could possibly apply to them.<br>  <br>  One final thought, given the history of our species thus far, I would be astonished if peaceful coexistence was the result of first contact with any alien life-form. I tend to think they might just disinfect the planet of our race and be on their way - probably thinking that they had just done a good days work. Would they be "wrong"?|`|xDPQ700baa	Makes me think I don't know what it is BUT it does not automatically point to aliens, I can think of a good few earthly explanations one of which will probably be correct.<br>  <br>  Now then, global?

Which networks are running with it?|`|3AZ63fYxaa	They are just lights ,and prove nothing, and when are we going to get  pictures which show a real ufo, and they could be secret craft being tested by Governments....I am not convinced we are not alone, and to fly around up there, but not make contact makes no sense....|`|mjX1Zhjjaa	That mainstream TV needs viewers to see the commercials they sell and that sensational stories draw viewers.|`|6GXSNJt5aa	Makes me think "THEY'RE HERE!!!"|`|i5FP4Vbraa	There's something on Yahoo News about these UFO sightings - have not read the report yet, but my reaction is probably universal in that it just adds one more small confirmation to my belief that we are NOT alone in this great universe of ours.<br>  <br>  Let's hope they're friendly.<br>  <br>  "Take me to your leader" - surely you don't mean Gordon Brown?|`|4ca7cbc3cf438ff2c043a82b2b46730caa	Further cements my belief that we're not alone.  I think the government doesn't tell us about it because they have little to no control over them and it's just better that we not know about it under those circumstances.  Call me crazy.

Well sorry it is not, a young muslim girl in my opinion has the same right as a young white girl and for us to accept that in the name of religion it is ok for a section of our community to accept that a woman is second class while a indigenous, chinese, hindu, jewish girl has a right to be treated obviously as equal to all|`|ebd4b116c0612534749a4cb34b9a7462aa	Terrorism is global.

I know many patients who come in pick and choose their medications because of the cost.  Pharmacists should, by the way, advise you if you can buy a cheaper product over the counter.<br>  Again, some medicines cost an awful lot - Viagra is very expensive, for example.<br>  At the moment, those above 60 are free, as are patients on benefits, children, pregnant women and contraception, as well as certain medical conditions like diabetes.<br>  Patients who can claim free prescriptions do so and often, very wastefully.  One diabetic I know is checking his glucose levels 20 times a day and the doctors are actually prescribing for him, even though he is clearly obsessive.  He must cost the NHS a fortune!<br>  Also, if you are on a lot of medication, you get a prescription pre-payment certificate, which allows you all your medicines for three months (or one year) for a basic rate of under ￡30.<br>  It's a minefield.  I don't mind paying, but I do object to people who get their paracetemol, etc on the NHS.  While I have to pay for my asthma pumps!

7lkLZ57Saa	1. In the early 20th century the the British-ruled land now known as Israel was mostly inhabited by Muslim Arabs.<br>  <br>  2. Over the following decades increasing numbers of Jews emigrated there, many being refugees from Nazi persecution.<br>  <br>  3. Friction arose between the 2 groups and occasional fighting broke out.<br>  <br>  4. The UN offered a partition plan which involved giving the Jews more of the land despite their significantly lower population.<br>  <br>  5. The Arabs understandably refused this settlement.<br>  <br>  6. Fighting broke out again and the Jews took Israel by force.<br>  <br>  7. Neighbouring nations attacked this new state and lost.<br>  <br>  8. The UN acknowledged the state of Israel as an independent sovereign nation.<br>  <br>  9. Thousands of Muslim Palestinians were forced out of Israel* and now live as refugees in poverty in one of the most overcrowded regions on earth (12th most overcrowded to be precise).<br>  <br>  *There is limited evidence of a deliberate policy of 'ethnic cleansing' but numerous spontaneous attacks by Jewish Israelis terrified the Palestinian Muslims into leaving.<br>  <br>  **********************************<br>  IMPORTANT - Note that although the UN acknowledged the state of Israel soon after its inception, this was on condition of Palestinians being offered their own state and being allowed a right of return (resolution 194). This has not happened.|`|ymXlF9Rnaa	Israel reports that 1,134 died in Gaza, 673 were Hamas, other terror groups and combatants, 288 civilians and 173 unidentified, terrorist groups use streets and populated areas to launch rockets, using civilians as human shields.

People say Israel is sooo bad because they killed many Palestinians; but what would have stopped Gaza....even Hamas from doing the same if they were given powerful weapons. Remember one thing, Gaza knew they did not have proper weapons to contunie fighting.   It was Hamas that wanted Israel wiped out.<br>  <br>  ''Thousands of Muslim Palestinians were forced out of Israel'' What a load of rubbish.  Have some people not even been or lived in Israel to know that it inhabits Jews, Christians and Muslims.  Some families are mixed with these religions over there too.

Is that your goal?<br>  <br>  Are you even aware that Pakistan was forced to join the "war on terror" and to support the USA's invasion of Afghanistan under threat of nuclear attack by the USA?

The Bush reigme, zionism, aswell as those- misguided individuals who commit terror such as 911,- mumbai attack, etc. are a universal enemy of- humanity.<br>  I appreciate that in retaliation there are- individuals, becoming radicalized in retaliation to the- attacks such as in Afghanistan, Iraq, Palestine etc.- But i feel we must unite regardless of our beliefs to- fight off terrorism and really understand the reality- of the attacks. For example noone can argue Bush's- invasion of Iraq, Afghanistan and attack against- civilians in other countries such as the NW Pakistan in- recent times aswell as can one question the civilian- attack of the mumbai attack. Some deluded people may- try to justify such an attack but in reality wrong is- wrong no matter who it is done by. <br>  We must also look- to the vericty of those accused for example the mumbai- attack is full of controversy; India concluded the- perputrators as an unknown organisation, in some- unknown location in Pakistan, and the terrorst being- supported by Pakistan intelligence. But no evidence as- UN claims has been proposed, apart from an email sent- by the unknown organisation taking responsibility as alleged by indian intelligence, and- America's inevitable backing. So I feel we must- look behind lie's portrayed by biased media.<br>  If we look to what the terrorist attack against the lankan team has achieved, one would conclude that they would be out to hurt Pakistan so perhaps sources outside the country were responsible, but noone is certain.<br>  Many attacks take place by Indians for example; with extremists such as RSS and Siv sena, but one should by no means generalise and announe Indians as terrorists.|`|2c3fad97ea8b5e911078dc2d53597dddaa	Why dont we declare USA as terrorist state...many people die becoz of gansters.

But to make a couple of points Crufts has cleaned its act up slightly in the last year since the BBC documentary last year.  So why ban it now?<br>  <br>  Also horse breeding is worse.  The 500,000 thoroughbreds used in racing are all descended from around 20 horses, 300 years ago.  So why is horse racing not only shown on TV, but is a 'protected national programme' and thus cannot be shown only on Sky/Setanta like football is?|`|tNk6j437aa	It's an outdated format anyway!

i7oHTo9haa	No let's hope it doesn't come to that.  We'll have to limit the damage that they can cause since they regularly chant Death to America, Death to Israel by millions of frenzied crowds that also express their desire to conquer Europe and beyond to spread global Islamofascism.  Not only are they a threat to the West, but their own Muslim neighbors aren't taking a liking to their hegemony maneuvers.  They have their sights set pretty high with global dominion from the inception of their Islamic Revolution which started in their country in 1979.<br>  <br>  They go by Khomeini doctrine, which said that if every Iranian dies in the sake of spreading Islam globally, that is fine by him.  During the Iran-Iraq war, they sent thousands of their children into the Iraqi minefields to clear them, so that the adult soldiers could make their way safely across.  The Persian children were armed with "plastic keys to paradise."  Iran also regularly supports suicide bombing and teaches that to their children on primetime cartoon television and there has already been a call out for a nuclear suicide bomber among the extremists.<br>  <br>  They may have a death wish for both them and us, but I don't share their views.  I don't wish to wipe them off the map, but just to defend the free world against the damage that they can do.<br>  <br>  Even a "changing of the guard" and a new election that would oust Achmedinejad wouldn't change the fact that they go by that Khomeini doctrine, and that the Ayatollah has substantial power in Iran, and that they are a very large and dangerous country that needs their power limited.  <br>  <br>  The bottom line is that I don't wish them harm, but if they are coming after all of us, and it's us or them then they made that choice themselves as we don't have to stand by and let them kill us.  Whatever it takes to make them stop because they are like Hitler sometimes the fascists need a heavy ground and pound before they give up their evil ways.  Hitler and the fascist troops in WW2 weren't spared mass destruction, and neither should any Islamofascist regime.  Wipe off the map is excessive speech, just do what it takes to make them surrender.|`|NMpbLtuTaa	Of course not. Most of Iran's military infrastructure can be flattened while leaving most of Iran intact.|`|eTTkAv9Yaa	That would make us no better than the likes of Hamas who say this about Israel, and they are recognised as terrorists.<br>  <br>  We need to show them the way, they are like the disruptive kid in school, need extra coaxing and manipulating to co-operate.<br>  <br>  All the threats just makes them dig their heels in, which is counterproductive.|`|213df96cd601a86457f2e97e4a811bb8aa	No, why should it?

NMpbLtuTaa	Of course they are. Iran and some Arab nations are going to attack Israel in a Hitler-like way in hopes of perpetrating their "final solution" to what they and other rotten anti-Semites throughout the world erroneously see as a problem. All of their hopes and dreams (and the hopes and dreams of anti-Semites throughout the world) will be shattered when Israel comes out victoriously once again.<br>  This next big attack will result in massive Arab losses and quite possibly a third Temple on the Temple Mount.|`|i7oHTo9haa	I don't think it's going to get much worse at least not in near future.  We're already in major war but with nation v nation and all troops deployed no I don't think it's going to be like that.  The Islamofascists are operating differently than in previous era where Country A declared war on Country B.  Iran's schemes are a bit different and people feel the same way about Achmedinejad that they felt about Saddam, a rogue threat.<br>  <br>  What Iran is trying to do is to inflame the immigrant Islamic populace within Europe and cause mass chaos to overthrow the gov'ts from within. Also to influence our mindsets and render the West immune to battle against Islamic extremism. They are sided up with the liberals in those countries trying to divide and conquer us within our nations and between our allies. <br>  <br>  Anyone attacking Iran would be met with sigh of relief by the moderates after they are shattered.  The Muslim states (most of them) don't even like Iran. The Gulf states have alot of Iranians in them so they are fearful of them and allied with them, they are a massive populace that influence those gulf states, but those are smaller states with less power compared to the rest of the Middle East. The Moderate states in Middle East are large enough and have enough power to control their frenzied crowds and offset any Iranian allied threat. I think we've got Iran "in check" if we strike them before they get nuclear capability, which is soon.<br>  <br>  They don't have enough Islamic new immigrants in Europe to cause mass damage or enough support in the Middle East to cause a global full troop deployment war.  If we let things go further then yes it could be much worse scenario, both internally and abroad.<br>  <br>  There would be mass riots again in all the countries that reacted to Gaza war, but I hope that Europe has enough rubber bullets and teargas this time to dissipate the mass frenzied crowds that support the rise in Islamofascism and caused all the destruction.|`|lPO4D8PLaa	No.  but i am concerned that Israel might trigger something.<br>  Iran has never attacked its neighbors (unlike Israel) and does not possess nuclear/chemical/biological weapons (unlike Israel).|`|c59a4010def6f797e0a0e7c583f93ec6aa	No, israel will and Iran will respond then Globo-Cop (US) will bomb iran back to the stone age.|`|yNNdHDKvaa	Wars and rumors of Wars are in the script man!<br>  My guess is,...Man will start it!|`|bef12fbc176623e3f52681ef8805e8f8aa	barking dogs never bites......
i7oHTo9haa	It matters to them is because Jewish people are successful in their  homeland. They couldn't stand the fact that Jewish people lived in other Muslim dominated lands and being a Jewish dhimmi in Muslim dominated lands wasn't even good enough for the haters then either. During WW2 they drafted Muslim SS troops and erected concentration camps in Muslim dominated lands.<br>  <br>  Jewish people were forced to abandon assets and properties in Muslim dominated lands FIVE times the size of Israel and have recovered and have full control of their own country now and it just eats them up. It eats them up so much that they developed this Palestinian crisis to try to take all of Israel and Jerusalem one piece at a time.  They didn't want Jewish people living here, or there, or anywhere.  <br>  <br>  To acknowledge Israel's successful existence means to them to acknkowledge an imperfection in their own religion since it was based on hate of Jewish people and that Islam now has the "perfected" religion of submission.|`|9ozLBt5Qaa	Yes SOME States.  Let's face it, Israel is an educated, richer country inhabiting Christians, Jews and Muslims.  <br>  <br>  Any neighboring poorer country dominated with only one faith - that is also against Israel and Judaism will be jealous...and will probably do anything to be in the spotlight too.  <br>  People say Israel is sooo bad because they killed many Palestinians; but what would have stopped Gaza....even Hamas from doing the same if they were given powerful weapons. It was Hamas that wanted Israel wiped out.|`|NMpbLtuTaa	Unfortunately, you are talking about a large percentage of people. Hatred toward Jewish people is going to result in the Battle of Armageddon.

In the early 20th century the the British-ruled land now known as Israel was mostly inhabited by Muslim Arabs.<br>  <br>  2. Over the following decades increasing numbers of Jews emigrated there, many being refugees from Nazi persecution.<br>  <br>  3. Friction arose between the 2 groups and occasional fighting broke out.<br>  <br>  4. The UN offered a partition plan which involved giving the Jews more of the land despite their significantly lower population.<br>  <br>  5. The Arabs understandably refused this settlement.<br>  <br>  6. Fighting broke out again and the Jews took Israel by force.<br>  <br>  7.

aLNLl482aa	When I was little Crufts was big event in our house . We were ( still are ) as a family Dog mad.<br>  <br>  I know this is well sad but we would have a biscuit tin filled with slummy and take bets and then all wait for my Mum and Nan to cry when the supreme champion was announced.<br>  <br>  Then it morphed into something so ludicrous and vile that it bears no resemblance to anything I remember or certainly approve of. In the 70's a Labrador was expected to be a soft as butter tank with a head like a table..now they look like thouorghbred race horses. Despicable.<br>  <br>  I HATE animals being exploited in any way and when something happens purely for the owners pleasure then it should be stopped.<br>  <br>  I think it is no different to what some parents who ' hot house' their kids do. They will all cry they are doing it because they love them...yeah right.<br>  <br>   MAMA - My family in Ireland raced Grey hounds and kept every single one for all of their natural life as did all their neighbours,because of what that sport has become they no longer take part in that. The same should apply to Crufts- just because it was decent once doesn't mean it is now. When I was growing up we had three dogs a combination of breeds and strays. I don't doubt your love of dogs for a minute but Crufts is about human pleasure nothing more nothing less.|`|9kTejB0uaa	I'm really don't want to dignify this question with a direct answer<br>  <br>  But I must say an ignorant individual (for reasons best known to himself) is leading the ignorant masses who are only too happy to jump on the bandwagon, again despite not having the faintest idea of what they are talking about!!<br>  <br>  I'd like to publically invite said 'ignorant individual' to visit the headland in my town where he will see loads of 'mutant cripples', pedigree dogs of virtually every breed happily charging around enjoying life, and their daily exercise.<br>  <br>  I will agree that Crufts has become a circus - but that's down to all the stands selling anything and everything, must nothing to do with your average dog!  I long ago stopped bothering to go, preferring to watch on TV in the peace of my own living room, surrounded by my own 'mutant cripples'!!!   Now even this is denied me, and all for why?  Because the bottom line is they, these ignorant people, are targetting the WRONG PEOPLE.<br>  <br>  Look at the Puppy Farmers, the BYBs, NOT the hobby breeder/exhibitor who loves their dogs, and who would rather die than produce said cripples.  The 'overbreeding' is not being done by most who go showing (and Crufts is only one show in a calendar of Champ shows that goes throughout the year).<br>  <br>  Stop stirring the pot!!!<br>  <br>  (My!) rant over.<br>  <br>  Edit - For the record, when I was showing my hounds they did not live a miserable life.  Fgs. they lived as they would have done, show dogs, or not - as my PETS.  They lived in the house, they were fit, happy and healthy, and on the days we went out to show, they were at the door lining up to get into the car.  This is just another example of the ignorance there is out there.  Most breeders DO NOT BREED to produce mutants.  They, usually, and mostly, for their next generation, hopefully improving all the while.  Breeding anything is not an exact science and problems can and do crop up from time to time but you will find those who are only in it to make money on the whole never ever take their stock into the show-ring.  Look at Manytears website - this is a rescue charity who takes in ex-brood bitches from the Puppy Farms (mostly in Wales).  THIS is where you will find the examples of poor breeding practices.  And most of these poor animals are hardly recognisable as the breeds they represent.  Okay, if you want to keep pointing the finger at Crufts, there's nothing, obviously, I, or any other good breeder can do, but I wish to God you would educate yourselves!!!  Just one more thing - showing my stock  was, the place I could compare what my stock looked like, in competition with other like-minded people.  It was competitive, a yardstick for me to assess where I was going with my line.  And if that sickens people, TOO BAD.  As for pulling and prodding - even if that was relevant with my hounds, if they didn't like it, their tails would be between their legs, they wouldn't move, which would defeat the object!!  And those who didn't enjoy the show ring, stayed at home.<br>  <br>  There is, by the way, corruption in all kinds of subjective competition.  Unless it's down to 'highest and furthest', it will always be open to this sort of thing, regrettable as it is.  Look at the Figure Skating world!!  Not to say this sort of thing is right, but if you want it bad enough, you grow a thick skin, and persevere!|`|xDPQ700baa	Sorry but I did not need a TV or other news outlets to tell what was going on. Crufts should have changed earlier. The breeders, legit or not, are also partly to blame. Producing desirable dogs for this method of show alters the breed and creates a market for the dogs that people will exploit. So the shadier aspect of this will thrive. Like I said, they had a chance but they did not see it thus missed the boat.|`|ZuUAUEY6aa	yes a resounding yes - and I am a dog lover and have one|`|os5IKFBJaa	Yes.

It seems that as cynical as I am about PR, he does have her interests at heart, and that can only be a good thing.|`|djX0o7V4aa	It's very sad, Jade shouldn't be dying at such a young age, it must be awful for her planning on what she will say to her boys for the last time.

i7oHTo9haa	I think it's bad timing and bad taste to interrupt a heavy intellectual meeting where people are highly concerned.  Real people are losing real jobs and no I don't see the humor in the interruption of that press conference.  There would be other times they aren't involved in something so heavy, something more lighthearted, that she'd be more readily accepted.  To me, she'd be an annoyance.  I like Tom Green and Borat humor, and it seems she's along those lines.  But I think she picked bad time and bad place.

It's important that you know this. Because of too many people breeding thier pets, homing centres are constantly full to capacity which means they sometimes have to destroy the animals that are not homeable like sick and geriatric animals. This is not the fault of the RSPCA but the fault of breeders. Breeders and pet owners produce more and more puppies and kittens for all the wrong reasons - making money, superstition and myth, cuteness factor, competitions. And with little regard for the overpopulation problem.<br>  <br>  they are a charity dedicated to the welfare of animals and I think its incredibly crappy of you to attack them like this.

9iu0Vynkaa	Cerco di essere il più esaudiente possibile ;P. Allora, da mesi, Fabrizio Corona, il marito di Nina Moric, insieme a Lele Mora, si recava presso uomini e donne, la maggior parte dei quali SPOSATI, fotografandoli con donne e uomini (che, naturalmente, non corrispondevano ai loro coniugi!). Per non pubblicare queste foto, i vip sono stati costretti a pagare cifre modestissime... Ma, in fin dei conti, i tradimenti che tutta questa gente ha evitato di far venire fuori, sono comunque stati pubblicati!! Oggi, sia Mora che Corona, sono stati arrestati, ma c'è ancora qualcuno che dice di vederli fuori dalla prigione! MAH! Spero di essere stato capito! Fammi sapè ;P

GDwMdfqjaa	Lately I really don't know what to think anymore. It's been decades now that the US has to veto to get the UN to condemn terrorism against Israel, as if killing innocent civilians is okay if they're Israelies. Also, Britain has decided recently to establish relationship with the Hezbollah terrorist organization and called to begin talking with the Hamas. The world is definitely going downhill, hopefully it will stop deteriorating before it's too late.<br>  <br>  And oh really, Saif? Likud has similar statements? Can you point us to those statements?<br>  <br>  Here's the Likud platform/charter if you can't find one yourself, taken from the official "Israeli Parliament" website:<br>  <a href="http://www.knesset.gov.il/elections/knesset15/elikud_m.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.knesset.gov.il/elections/knes...</a><br>  <br>  As usual, knowledgeless and spewing nonsense.<br>  <br>  Edit: Note the "unilateral". Announcing a Palestinian state one-sidedly is something many countries would object, as it has to be done through cooperation, which is Likud's point in that statement. And how is taking strong diplomatic measures equivalent to "the stones and trees will say oh muslim, there's a JEW behind me, come and KILL HIM"?<br>  <br>  Edit 2: Attempts to reach a ceasefire failed because Hamas had ego problems so Israel did the noble thing and called for a unilateral ceasefire. Don't compare that to a unilateral declaration of Palestine which is destined to fail badly. "and unilaterally taking over Palestinian lands" <- I'd love to hear when that happened. And uniteral? Last I checked, it takes 2 for tango, and it's the Arab nations and the Palestinians which invaded Israel, not the other way around ultimately leading to the conquering of the West Bank and Gaza.|`|Dm8LgnnYaa	terrorist organizations occupies  other  people and lands ,  destroy  a  history  of  gaza , all  the buildings built by  the  world  aid as  olymbic building , schools of  UN  over  sheltered  civilians  killing all  of  them  , destroy 17 mosques  over  prayers , bombing hospitals and ambulances and killing and injuring 6000 civilians ,  300  child  killed  last  month ,  600  women killed  last  months  this  all  done  by  terroris  organization of corrupted  olmert and vampieres  lifny|`|NMpbLtuTaa	Yesterday I was thinking about posting a question that goes something like:<br>  "Do people who hate Israel and Jewish people know that they are paving the way for the Battle of Armageddon?"<br>  <br>  The two sides in the Battle of Armageddon are Israel and most of the rest of the world.

The government will adopt immediate stringent measures in the event of such a declaration."<br>  <br>  Edit2:  @darkAI -- but you are quiet ok with Israel declaring unilateral ceasefires and unilaterally taking over Palestinian lands?  get real.

YDHRMYecaa	hidemyass.com is a fake proxy site.  You have to be careful because some sites will actually steal usernames and passwords, even credit card info that you submit while using those proxy sites.  I have only found a short list of real proxy sites that don't steal info:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://bypassrestriction.com" rel="nofollow">http://bypassrestriction.com</a><br>  <a href="http://bypassrestriction.info" rel="nofollow">http://bypassrestriction.info</a><br>  <a href="http://facebookpr0xy.info" rel="nofollow">http://facebookpr0xy.info</a><br>  <a href="http://accessmyspacefromwork.com" rel="nofollow">http://accessmyspacefromwork.com</a><br>  <a href="http://accessmyspacefromwork.info" rel="nofollow">http://accessmyspacefromwork.info</a><br>  <br>  Hope that answers your question!|`|RaBFHLk5aa	Because this voting site will record your ip while you do your voting.<br>  So, you can't vote twice with the same ip unless you change your ip address.<br>  <br>  By using proxy mean you use other ip address to browse a web site, that why sometime you can use proxy to vote again. However, some of these voting sites can detect you are using proxy (if they are smart) and ban you to vote again.<br>  <br>  www.proxifly.co.cc
