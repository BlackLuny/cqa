So... what the hell is your problem??    But otherwise, I'm sorry, dont know the answer. It will be VERY VERY VERY hard to find a falt with 1 bdrm for under 120,000quid though.

VcD1Q6cUaa	Why do you continue to confuse yourself about this?  You have asked this in many variations and ways of asking in the past,  why haven't you resolved that issue?  Of course money is not everything, it cannot buy you eternal happiness and contentment, it can't buy health nor real love.  But realistically, it can solve a lot of temporary problems, like being able to go anywhere you want, buying anything you want, all sorts that give temporal pleasure.  And you know, being able to do almost anything you want because you have the money can provide a lot of pleasure and happiness.  But again, it is up to you to maintain that happiness.  Even if you have all those money you need if you are basically unbalanced emotionally, if you know what i mean,  you will still feel the dissatisfaction that you apparently are feeling so much now.  So my humble suggestion, work on your emotional well-being.  Accept that you can not have everything you want in this life.  Appreciate the little things,  and as oft repeated by some,  believe and trust a higher being.  Our Creator, the Lord.  Once you find Him in your heart, i bet you'll feel contentment and happiness.  Cheers!  :)|`|XXm2yCHiaa	Money is not everything   but without it, you are nothing.   :)|`|0HO8sTGeaa	no... money can sometimes make you suffer when you use it unwisely...but nevertheless we need $ to live in this world..... so use it wisely and you gonna be happy  =8~)|`|X3a0exwOaa	No, because the more money you have the more money you spend .. so it never really ends. lol|`|0exde9VEaa	Money is everything, but it will not solve problems, and it certainly will not make you happy...The love of money is the root of all evil ...and the road to all unhappiness ....|`|vQTYDR1oaa	$$$ isn't everything but I feel alot secure with it.

etV271ARaa	Its not likely that humanity will be wiped out by a nuclear Holocaust. No nation would dare strike first coz the retaliation would be severe. But  it makes sense that the international community works hard to prevent rogue states from acquiring nuclear weapons or developing nuclear capacity. However, its possible that some radical terrorist organisation may in the future detonate a nuclear device against its perceived enemy coz when the Soviet Union broke up in 93' several (I think 7 or 8) nuclear devices went missing in the Ukraine. No one knows where they are.....<br>  <br>  So my opinion is that nuclear weapon will not lead to our extinction. Instead, I believe that the proliferation of nuclear energy will lead humanity to a great new heights. Nuclear powered devices with virtually endless lifespans will carry us to the far reaches of space and nuclear power will replace all fossil fuels in a hundred years. <br>  <br>  And President Obama may be the one to go down in history as the one who led humanity towards total dependency on clean Nuclear Energy.|`|0lWB2SUwaa	If ww3 happens then were probably dead|`|220b497f9a511b5df0fff475b46096ffaa	Nuclear weapons have been around since the 1940's.  Since, for the moment, they are still controlled by governments, there is some hope that they will continue to not be used.   However, religious fanatics of all sorts are in positions of power, and it is only a matter of time until they decide to use one.   If there is a WW3, it will be one group of religious people claiming that their god told them to wipe out some other religious group, and that will justify the use of nukes.  Probably many people will survive, but the the entire world will suffer.|`|pIxrdAVKaa	i think we can exist for another 100 years..the nature always find its way..unless it is the end of the world. because it's not impossible for us to dissappear one day..we're not coakroaches ! as for the WW3, anyone could trigger it..but the main purpose is actually for power, not over religion just like the history has proven to us..|`|5c873097b4af9f2a2cc6aeb0288d4ff5aa	yes we can survived and can become winner too in a next few years<br>  all we have to do is to press the button first to eliminated the other world<br>  that have nuclear weapons too........lol|`|5sp0jxgGaa	hope i can still grow up before the ww3|`|HQKuzxulaa	WW3 will start because of Israel.

AA10523012	For my understanding "all inclusive" means breakfast, lunch and dinner are included in the hotel price.<br>  For certain reasons I can not recommend this for Dubai. If you mostly want to stay in your room and just leave it to dine, then fine. But if you also would like to dicover Dubai a bit and go certain places, you would not like it to be put on a time schedule to be back to the hotel for lunch/diner. <br>  Dubai offers many places to eat or have a snack. Be flexible. Nightclubs, bars etc. you find all over Dubai.<br>  <br>  Personal advice for a nice honeymoon:<br>  Rent a furnished aparment like this (just examples):<br>  <a href="http://dubaibeachfurnishedapartments.com/selfcatapart.html" rel="nofollow">http://dubaibeachfurnishedapartments.com...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.dubaifurnishedapartments.com/self" rel="nofollow">http://www.dubaifurnishedapartments.com/...</a><br>  <br>  Buy your spirits at the Duty Free when arriving in Dubai, be flexible, get up when ever you want, eat when and what ever you want and let "your hair down" .

61GBrMmqaa	Not to worry.<br>  <br>  It's not gonna hurt that much and the good thing about having it is that your dentist will require you to eat lots of ice creams and other cold snacks.<br>  <br>  The cold stuffs are supposed to help you with pain and the bleeding.<br>  <br>  Beside, your gonna have some medications after that will help ease the pain and stop any infections.<br>  <br>  So... relax.|`|gfEuZ6Zqaa	Don't eat hard to chew foods for the first 24hours.  Ask your dentist to prescribe a pain reliever that is also an anti-inflammatory like arcoxia.  It will not only relieve the pain but reduce the swelling.  Some people get dizzy and nauseous from the aneasthesia so maybe plan to go home after and rest.|`|EjhJliKmaa	after the anesthesia wears off, it hurts real bad.  the pain usually lasts two days at most.   analgesics give temporary relief but not completely.|`|z5fFoTMBaa	Your dentist will prescribe to you medicines to take care of the pain and to ease off the swelling which you will definitely feel when the anesthesia wears off. He will put a small sterilized ball of cotton to absorb the bleeding, which you will need to replace with another sterilized cotton as often as advised by your dentist. This will cover and help protect the open and freshly-extracted gums.<br>  <br>  You should not exert force, especially in your affected jaw area, to help the swelling heal faster. This is actually good because you will get to lounge around inside your house for a couple days doing nothing. But you cannot go out of the house. You cannot eat solid food until the pain and the swelling permanently subsides. Also, you will not be able to really brush your teeth. And you cannot really take a normal bath.

Dl9MJKf1aa	Well since she came from Brazil, perhaps go around England for the first week. You would know most of the places in London and I'm sure she'd love it. Plus there wouldn't be any language problems.  Depends on what she likes. If she likes cold and snowy areas perhaps somewhere like Austria or Switzerland- both really beautiful places. Of course countries like Spain, France, Italy and Germany would be great because they're so popular and have many interesting places to visit. There's some particularly nice lake areas in Italy, for example.  Or you could go somewhere quiet in Eastern Europe. I can definitely recommend ski resorts in Bulgaria- either Bansko or Borovets- since as I come from there and the visitors always seem to be satisfied at the end. The good thing about it is that it's pretty cheap compared to some other holiday resorts.   If you want to go sightseeing, I recommend Spain and France- there's a lot of things to do. Northern France is great, especially, because you can go by Eurostar and it won't take too long.   Make sure you ask her where she has already been and where she would like to go. To be honest, 2 days is not much so plan your time wisely.|`|O8yoWN5gaa	Depends strongly on your budget, my home country is Eastern Germany, City Leipzig. I think there you get the most "europe" per Eur.  It has a natural -not so artificial touristic- historical Charme. Modern Architecture (the BMW factory) and medivial great restaurated buildings.    Leipzig has one of the cheapest live condition in Europe, is multi cultural (students city) and has great affordable colourfull nightlive.   The southamerican women i dated there prefered to go the famous Scene Club Darkflower with me instead of the Salsa Clubs.    In an cross europe questionary about satisfaction with the home city Leipzig was place 3 ! People there are the third happiest in whole Europe. Compared with London shopping is damn cheap there with good quality. Maybe she like classical music, Bach lived there you can see and hear his giant church Organ. Museums are free or cheap.    From Standsted you can fly to Altenburg realy cheap with Ryanair. Altenburg is 40 minutes (4,5Eur) by train away from Leipzig and its towncentre is an old solid big castle, quite impressive for the beginning.  You can plan from 8eur (hostel) to 30Eur (middle class hotel), a Lunch arround 9 Eur).    If you get tired of it, Berlin (louder chaotic), or Prague (bigger more older building, but you get cheated as foreigner) is 2hours with a rented car (where can you drive as fast as YOU want) away.|`|JwQPsDcdaa	Scotland - try Inverness/Aviemore area (its absolutely beautiful and there is plenty to do) or Edinburgh.

2wyDALHgaa	From what I understand the inspectors were working with industry producers in accordance with the laws of the land.  Raw milk and raw milk products are illegal right now under current regulations and just recently there was a court case of a milk producer, I believe in Ontario, who was charged with selling raw milk.  It's working it's way through the courts and will be a test case that can change the industry...or reinforce the current laws.|`|65fef61f322f25075280c35b20f9c4f8aa	Randy is right. It is currently illegal to sell raw milk and raw milk products in Ontario (and Quebec I believe). <br>  <br>  The farmer is allowed to use raw milk for his and his family's personal consumption, but is not allowed to sell that milk to the public due to the risks of bacteria and other contaminants appearing in the milk. The milk must first be pasteurized before being considered okay for sale.<br>  <br>  This debate has gone on for many years, with farmers having to pour milk down their drains rather than sell it because it was not accepted by the processing plant (due to excess amounts)  or because it would have been too expensive to extract and transport it to the dairy for pasteurization.<br>  <br>  On one side, I know that raw milk was sold for years in Canada without any harmful effects, and many people claiming it is more nutritious.<br>  <br>  On the other end, farmers are putting all sorts of new chemicals in their feed to help cows produce more milk, and various new diseases are appearing, that you want to make sure all milk meets federal standards for testing and safety.<br>  <br>  If we allow milk to be sold raw direct from the farmer, what is to stop us from having the same issue as occurred in China, with farmers adding "extra white liquids" to thicken the milk or stretch it further so they can sell more?<br>  <br>  There is no easy answer on this.

697ae04db2502a1d77e3c8fb84237406aa	We've had this issue for the last 2 years, same deal with 2 kids, 2 adults & we desperatly wanted to go to FL.<br>  In 07/08 it was very much a last minute thing, all flights were sold out and we went for Christmas.  We ended up taking the Greyhound bus, now I had never taken the bus before.  We looked into taking the train but it was more expensive than a flight.  So the bus it was.  My theory was that we could just sleep like a car ride and no prob.  I think we ended up paying less than $500 round trip, that was & still is an amazing price if you don't mind dealing with cranky passengers, lots of stops & interruped sleep.  We had to keep getting on and off the bus, it was a little irritating. <br>  We finally made it to Fl, most of the hotels are pretty neg. on price.  The sooner you book it, the cheaper it is. Don't settle, keep researching based on what you want.  We wanted a 4 to 5 start hotel with lush surroundings and lots of amenities.  Now you have to be careful because you want to make sure that you have a fridge, a kitchen would ideal so you can make your own meals. Eating out is the MOST expensive thing you'll pay for, seriously.  And the food sucks most of the time. <br>  Stay in downtown Disney so you are right there at the heart of everything.  After walking all day, the last thing you want to do is travel some more.  You just want to go to your hotel & pass out.<br>  In 08/09 we flew and it cost us quite a bit more, for that trip I had planned in advance but much to my shagrin, they dropped prices drastically on airfare one month before we were to leave...sigh. <br>  We've done all the Disney theme parks but I have to say we were most impressed with Sea World. We LOVED it there, there wasn't tons of walking and the intereaction with the animals was so much fun! We also sprang for the LUAU at Sea World, totally worth the money.  WOW, so awesome!<br>  There are also tons of "extra's" at Sea World; dining with Shamu & so on. We ended up doing a tour of a hotel & got the 4 of us in for less than $100.  It takes about an hour (if you don't ask too many questions) and at the end of the presentation they give you your tickets. <a href="http://seaworld.com/sitepage.aspx?PageID=546" rel="nofollow">http://seaworld.com/sitepage.aspx?PageID...</a> <br>  I couldn't even begin to tell you all about the 4 major theme parks, I'd be writing all day.  Just figure out what would be the best park for you and your family & go fro there. We did Epcot & I LOVE IT but it is easily the most exhausting park to visit.  We did go there for my birthday & we love all the different worlds...what a treat. The boat rides are so cool too.  DON'T forget your camera!!!<br>  Anyway, just e-mail me if you have any other questions!|`|bXmRWbEdaa	Are you flying or driving?  Go to <a href="http://www.travelbargainsites.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.travelbargainsites.com</a> for good travel sites.|`|b5992aeb3758a7a0c6b2df7b53c77091aa	Cheap and Disney really don't go hand in hand, but you can cut some costs if you do your homework, AAA has some good deals on ticket prices and I love the Serlago hotel, it isn't a huge fancy place but they have nice pools, with very clean rooms, plus it is located in a fantastic area with lots of things to do all within walking distances.<br>  All over along the roads there are bins that have catalogs with discount coupons in them, take one of all they really do have some coupons in there that can save you a great deal of money!|`|xSHRJw46aa	Absolutely check for flights, but when you have to buy 4 tickets it will almost never be cheaper to fly than it is to drive.  I guess it also depends on how far you drive in a day.  If it takes you 3 days travel time each way, then the hotel and food costs start to add up.  <br>  <br>  Last spring when gas was at it's highest we drove down.  It was still cheaper than flying because airplanes run on oil too.  We actually left our 22 mpg minivan at home in the garage, and took the 30+mpg camry.  Putting $3.50 gas in the camry, it cost the same to drive down as if we were putting $2.50 gas in the minivan.<br>  <br>  We too are a family of 4, though we live in northern Illinois.  We like vacations, but if we did not pinch a few pennies we could not go as often as we do.  Some people would think nothing of spending $5000+ for a week at disney for a family of 4.  I have no problem with that.  More power to you.  We, however, tend to spend less than half of that.  You can still have fun.  We stay outside the resort.  We try to get a condo with kitchen facilities.  That provides a bedroom for the kids and one for the adults.  That can be nice when you want to get them in bed while you watch the news, or whatever.  It is also nice because you can fix some breakfast while they are still in bed.  Disney can be very tiring for kids.  <br>  <br>  The kitchen also saves us a ton on food expense.  Since we drive, we take most of our food with us, and it is just part of our normal weekly grocery expense.  It also keeps us out of the fast food places, and 10 servings of french fries out of our bodies.  So, we pretty much have breakfast in our condo, and pack snacks and water for the parks.  We also have late dinner at our condo.  Some nights we eat out, or get a takeout pizza.  Get the pizza menu of the local joint and leave it in your car.  You can call from the parking lot when you leave Disney and pick up your pizza on the way back to the condo.<br>  <br>  We have also been known to put a cooler in our trunk and have some sandwiches in the car as we parkhop in the middle of the day.  It does not work every day since we may not parkhop every day around lunch, but when it does we save $30+ for lunch.  It also gives you a chance to refresh your water bottles and snacks for the afternoon.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.  Not everyone would like this, but it is our way.|`|jytL2ZIZaa	honestly, flying. Flights are going for cheap now and if you shop around you can get a good deal. They have some very cheap and fairly decent hotels very close to disney, many offering free shuttle service to the parks. Visit expedia.com and search for a flight and hotel package and click "sort by price" and they will list the packages from cheapest to most expensive.|`|URO3gDXcaa	driving.  sesame place is better and closer.|`|tRJrYZEHaa	1.

TskZHzZyaa	St Patricks Day, eh?  Well then I would say Chicago - with its Irish heritage we take it more seriously.  Weather is a crapshoot - odds are greater that it will be warmer in Frisco, not warm and not warm by Tennesseee standards, though probably about the same temperature.  Chicago can have snow as late as May and is not at all unusual in March.  But you could be lucky.  Both are great cities.  Chicago is superior for shopping - Michigan Avenue is called the Magnificent Mile for a reason!  We locals say the Mag Mile.  ONLY six days - that's a good long time!  And the Fairmont on the river is close to so much to do!|`|3ae89a25a502906a8b192bb54d58da6baa	i would like Chicago,alot more stores, things to see and do... the only downside would be the weather..i dont know if you know how crazy Chicago weather is.

WxX6Brhvaa	hi, the best airport is Fiumicino because it is very well connected to the city (trains every 30 minutes and you get to the city in 25 minutes!).  About weather... good question!global warming is changing the world! Sometimes it rains but if you're lucky it is warm and Rome is at its best during that period. The only problem is that Easter is high season so I suggest you to book tickets for Colosseum and Vatican Museums in advance (it's very easy, a little bit more expensive but it is worth!). The Colosseum will be closed on God Friday (there will be the Pope for the Stations of the Cross), about Sunday and Monday of Easter they haven't given yet official information, so right now it's supposed to be open but I suggest you to ask a new question around March 15th so that it will be official.  I hope I could be clear enough, any information don't hesitate to ask!|`|PiGqg0EMaa	EVERYTHING WILL BE OPEN! There are so many great places there for the ticket stop in St. Paul then Amsterdam, Netherlands then take the flight to Rome.  Easter will be the perfect time to see all the churches like the Sistine Chapel.    List of places to see:  Coliseum,  Forum,   Trevii Fountain    Also there are a ton of McDonald's there if you like good American food but don't get scared about the food I had King Prawns at a place with the heads on them I just cut off the heads and enjoyed the food!  Check out the Palledium hotel as long as you don't have a ton of luggage the elevator is tiny and the rooms are pretty small.    Hope I helped! =)|`|d6HXwlpPaa	The weather will be warm but could bring rain, The Coliseum will be open but will also be crowded as will many sights in Rome during Holy week. Definitely Fumicello airport, easy train into Termini station. Try some off the beaten path sightseeing like a visit to San Clemente church, you can take stairs down from the church to an older church now underground and then you can take stairs down from that lower church into a roman temple see link   http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...  I also think it would be great fun to rent a vespa in Rome and cover some sightseeing that way! Have fun   http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...

You did not say where you are from, but you can also get money with an EC card from an ATM and it cheaper than with a Credit Card.|`|ojtINp2raa	I would go with Travelex....they provide a Traveler's Check Card.  It is like a credit card, only it comes with all the benefits of traveler's checks (such as being able to get your cash back if lost or stolen, without having to go through a mile of red tape).    enjoy your stay. :)|`|GKJEgidzaa	I took a credit card for emergency, I tried not to take it out to much, as if you loose it, its extremely easy for someone to just pick up and use it (they don't use chip and pin usually).   You should take some cash to get you started, and the rest in travelers checks, if you loose your travelers checks, nobody can claim them, as you need a passport and other form of ID to do so.|`|7PbJWEo1aa	Neither!!    You still have time to set up a "Nationwide" account - they do not charge you for taking your money out abroad and you then get the bank rate exchange rate. I have lived/worked/travelled abroad far more than I would like sometimes and I can honestly say this is the best way to have your money.    Travellers cheques are rubbish - you have to exchange them etc and all that hassle - credit cards charge the earth and taking a lump some of cash is risky.    Twenty mins in the Nationwide and you will never be charged for taking out cash abroad again.|`|IpQY6rVMaa	Use a debit card and cash.|`|fxUqHJS3aa	take a little of everything at the same time|`|Sme8zvmDaa	Cash are the best, unless you are bringing a huge sum. Credit cards are ok, but you've got to think about the high exchange rate that your cc company will charge you.    Travelers checks are ok, but some places don't accept them, so that's a problem... And the time to apply for and process them... At the end of the day, cash is still King...|`|0E6u2YOGaa	You'll be okay with cash dollars, but hunt around for a good exchange rate. The Post Office and Marks and Spencer are great.    If you're worried about security (ie going to a big city), take less cash, but use your credit card. Keep it in a different wallet, hidden on your person (US criminals are good at cloning cards).    Amex is best for this - the rate is lower in the US and you accrue points or Airmiles.
kgBPU4xxaa	There really isn't enough information to answer the question. As for the coach, where are you coming from? The more common way to get to Venice would be by train. You can check prices and schedules from various places on the Italian train website: http://www.ferroviedellostato.it/cms/v/i...    Venice is generally pretty expensive and there are a wide range of prices. The prices vary depending on what's going on in the city. During Carnevale, the prices generally go up. A good site for checking availability and prices of hotels in and around the city is: http://www.venere.com/home/ There will be a very wide range of prices depending on the hotel class and exactly where it is in the city. Generally, it's cheaper to stay near the train station or on the Lido island. It's even cheaper to find someplace on the mainland for instance in Mestre and take the bus or train into the city for the day.    You can get combined museum passes that will save you over individual admission. You can also buy passes for the vaporetto that are good for up to three days - usually I just walk because exploring the city on foot allows you to see a lot more. However, you should take at least one boat along the Grand Canal.     Food can be quite expensive too. Check the prices on the menus posted outside the restaurants to find something that's in your range. There are many places that sell pizza by the slice or pannini for 5.50 to 7 euro that are less expensive. You could also buy bread, fruit, etc in the markets even cheaper.     If you want a gondola ride count on 80 euro or more. They're more expensive in the evening.|`|nd4QSsr1aa	the price varies from season to season- the best way to find out is to go to a travel agent then add a couple hundred for additional expenses such as food, shopping for other items transportation and anything else you may want to do while you are there.  and don't forget the currency conversion form us dollars to euros...|`|hT8vbWiDaa	Dear John,  Your question has to be more specific.   Taking a coach from where (into Venice or Mestre)? The part of the year you arrive to Venice will dictate the hotel or B&B rate.   Give us more information and we'll all be glad to lend you a hand.

hel4ebsoaa	The South Rim is the most popular and classic observation popint of the Canyon.THen it is the North rim...Recently the Native Americans funded construction of the sky bridge and that is a very exhilirating experience...Not for the timid if heights are a bother to you....Your  tour bus will most certainly stop at the South rim as there is a reason why it is the most popular...fantastic views|`|AA11620976	As you no  doubt know The Grand Canyon is a very recognizable name and as such one that carries a large amount of money earning potential for those who have access to it.  The question that you absolutely  have to ask yourself as you pick thru all of your various options is the most basic one "Am I going to see the real Grand Canyon ? and the answer to the Navajo auto  tours to the Rio,Skywalk, West Rim ......and any helo company that claims to fly below the Rim and or land in the Park is" NO"  Why?  1) It's against NPS regulations to have any wheeled vehicle anywhere  below the Rim anywhere within GCNP  There's a story about how one New Years Eve a mule drover decided to take a keg of beer down the S.Kaibab Trail  to add to supply at the party at Phantom Ranch .NPS fined  him for doing that ,not because of the beer But rather because he used a hand truck to transport it  The way that the Navajos circumvent that law is that they tweak the definition of what is Grand Canyon/  The Navajo Rez butts up against the Rim of GCNP from basically the Confluence of the Little Colorado [river mile 61.5 ] all the way up to basically Lee's Ferry [ RM 0]  Since the Rio is basically flowing N/S at that point anything east of the Rim is on the Rez and the Navajo's can do whatever they want with it [including throwing garbage all over it]   Back to the original Q  Is it the real Grand Canyon ? No   What it is is a section of the Canyon that Powell misnamed Marble Canyon >there isn't any marble in the Canyon  Don't get me wrong it's a pretty spot to be ,But it's not exactly the Grand Canyon  2) It's against both NPS &FAA regs to land any aircraft that is not on official business anywhere within GCNP   Furthermore it is against the  law to fly below the Rims of GCNP ....and there is a huge No Fly Zone over  GCNP with a hard deck of I believe 11500 'msl  3) To the Q of Skwalk ?Don't   You can get a much better and cheaper [free ]view of the Rio if you drive across the New Navajo Bridge on US 89A   Here's a picture of it .The brown rock that the Bridge is anchored to is to is the Tapeats Sandstone  which was deposited 550mya and is the first Cambrian  strata in the Canyon .any thing below that is PC  http://www.nps.gov/glca/historyculture/n...  Leave this Q open for a day or two and I'll add more details|`|T5UBrKZjaa	http://www.navajo.org/contact.htm.     The above link will take you to the Navajo Nation website. They are one of two tribal nations that have permits to DRIVE to the bottom of the Canyon, with stops along the way.    I WOULD HIGHLY recommend that you use the Navajo and not the other tribe. Both tours paralleled each other and from what I saw the Navajo tour (cost the same) was far superior to the other tribe. Also, the driving aspect gives you more viewing time.    I have made visits to the canyon and have found that all the angles South/West/etc...should be seen. You get a different perspective from all the different views.

It is 15 miles between the two cities and should take about 20 - 30 min to drive depending on where you are leaving from in Walnut Creek and where you are going to in Piedmont. Also it might take a bit longer depending on if you are going during morning commute or not.<br>  <br>  You can also probably take bart from Walnut Creek to the Rockridge station and take public transit from there.

Make sure you will arrive Lucena as early as possible because trolley ride might not be available at night.<br>  It's almost 5 hour trip from Manila to Lucena by bus.

1f88iwfMaa	College Park is a suburb to the northeast of Washington. In order to get to downtown, you'll need to take the shuttle to the College Park metro station and take the Green Line into the city. The train ride to the Archives/Navy Memorial station near the National Mall takes about half an hour. From there you'll be able to walk to the White House, Washington Monument, and the Holocaust Museum, which are all located in the downtown core.|`|uPOrPauBaa	I agree with the previous poster. If you can get to a Metro station, you are all set. There isn't much in DC that you can't get to on Metro. Grab a map and be ready to reference it a lot but the Metro there is really fantastic.<br>  <br>  Follow the link below for directions to the Museum. You can't miss the Washington Memorial from there. If it's nice outside I highly recommend taking a camera and some good walking shoes and doing the loop of the memorials.

3c9011f4e1ee523d3d41dea51e53ed15aa	There's plenty and you can get around easily, if you're willing to hop from bus to subway to trolley & train.  A monthly pass is reasonable and gives you unlimited rides within a certain zone, so your travels in and around Temple will be cheap enough.  However, it's not the safest transit system so keep your ears open and stay alert, no drowsing off by the window seat with your iPod playing!|`|VEi3R0craa	I work and live in Philly and I take public trans to work everyday because parking sucks in Center City.  And I have no problem most buses run every 10 -15 minutes during peak hours and off peak hours a pretty good as well.  The trains or okay as well.  I never had a problem been using it for about 15 plus years.|`|c49cceaaa4d4b2679a6552d0403658adaa	I am a Freshman now at Temple. I live in 1940 and I have taken the subway and train around - which are both very convenient. I have never taken a bus - although I know there is the Temple Owl Loop (that brings you around campus) as well as buses to Ambler Campus and Elkins Park.<br>  <br>   On the most part, if you are planning on taking classes on main campus and maybe going into the city for shopping/museums/sightseeing/etc you should be fine taking the Regional Rail or the Subway (which are on the edge of campus but not off campus). <br>  As far as security goes, the train station is in a somewhat bad area and the subway is a little (pardon my language) "ghetto fabulous" at times - I would avoid taking either alone at night. It's a good idea to travel with groups of people. <br>  <br>  If you want any information go to Septa.org (the public transportation in Philadelphia). I find this helpful when mapping out where I need to go. <br>  <br>  P.S. I don't know where you are from, but keep in mind - you should visit Temple before making your final decision. The area is a bit rough. But hey, it might be the school of your dreams! <br>  <br>  If you want any inside information on dorms or life here at temple shoot me up an email :)

AA10250756	If you do not speak Spanish, I suggest that you do not move to Miami. I know people who go to college there and are told by people working in stores and gasoline stations, including a large national pharmacy chain, that if they do not speak Spanish they have no business living in Miami. If you do not speak Spanish you will be unable to get a job. If you are Asian and from the Philippines like our friends who speak Spanish as well as Tagalog, you will be fine in Miami. If not, you will be dissed like the other non-Spanish speakers. The apts are also double what they are in Tampa. I don't know about Orlando, but there are lots of Asians in Tampa, particularly in New Tampa, Temple Terrace, and to lesser numbers in South Tampa and Carrollwood area. There are a lot of Asian grocery stores including the gigantic Oceanic supermarket in downtown Tampa on Tampa St. There is a huge Indian cultural center and there are a lot of prominent Indians like the Patels on the charity boards here in Tampa.  Lots of physicians from various parts of Asia living in Tampa proper. I was surprised to find the other respondent lives in Wesley Chapel as that is far from all the Asians. The Meadowlawn area of St. Petersburg has a large Asian population. I don't know if you are planning to go to USF or U of Tampa. There is bus transportation in Tampa, but I don't know where you plan to live and where you plan to go to school. They sell a monthly pass.  I moved here from the Northeast and found the people in Tampa to be friendly.|`|pTLcvsVfaa	So many variables..For starters, people are two faced everywhere. In fact when I live in Texas I found them to be less two faced then people from the North, where I live now. <br>  <br>  But that aside, Tampa is probably the best place to live for a few reasons. For one housing and rent is very affordable right now. Crowds are less, and tourism is not as crazy.

jn9iYEkAaa	The great thing about Boston is that so much of it can be walked. It's nothing like trying to see NYC on foot. <br>  <br>  Faneuil Hall and Quincy Market are about a 1/2 mile from the station. Lots of shopping, great restaurants, historical buildings. This is a great jumpin off point for most of Boston's sites. If you're into the history of the city, you can pick up the Freedom Trail here. <br>  <br>  The Freedom trail is 2.5 miles. If you follow it, you'll get some of Boston's highlights - Boston Common,  the state house, the site of the Boston Massacre, the North End (little Italy-stop at Mike's for a delicious cannoli!) and more!<br>  <br>  If you have children, the Boston Children's museum of science is only $1 on Friday Night from 5-9. <br>  <br>  You can skate in Boston Common on Frog Pond for $4/person. Children under 13 are free. Rentals cost more of course. <br>  <br>  If beer is more your speed, you can tour the Sam Adams Brewery. Tour hours are Tuesday-Thursday 10am-3pm Fridays 10am-5:30pm Saturdays 10-3pm but you'd want to take the T to get there. That's a good 5 miles from the station. Last I knew they only ask for $2/person for the tour. <br>  <br>  If you have a specific type of activity in mind, I could be more helpful. :)|`|ANg8RFWUaa	Chinatown, =) just walk around and explore|`|zfXVF2XVaa	There's really nothing close to South Station but the financial district, but getting around on the T is inexpensive, and you can get day passes.  There's the Science Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts, the New England Aquarium, the Boston Public Library, and Quincy Market, Copley Place and Newbury Street for shopping (even if just window shopping), for starters.  If you're a history buff and don't mind being outdoors, try walking the Freedom Trail.|`|WGamjAwQaa	theres nothing interesting right near south station, but its a really short walk (like 10 minutes) to the north end (a "little italy" area that has a bunch of historic landmarks and great food) and fanuiel hall (which has quincy market).<br>  <br>  keep in mind that getting around on the t (subway) isn't too expensive - $2 per ride (even if you switch lines).  you can easily walk to the places i mentioned but may want to take the t around other parts.  the t, as opposed to a bus, is the best cheap way to get around.|`|twCIv1WNaa	Yes, there are lots of interesting things to see around South Station.  The Rose Kennedy Greenway is nearby.  ( <a href="http://www.boston-discovery-guide.com/rose-kennedy-greenway.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.boston-discovery-guide.com/ro...</a> )<br>   This is a linear park that replaces the elevated highway that the Big Dig removed.  You can walk along it all the way from Chinatown to the North End.  As you come out of South Station, head toward the city on Summer Street or Essex Street and you'll be at the Greenway within a few hundred feet.  Along the way, especially toward the North End, you'll see various signs, etc., along the Greenway.  <br>  <br>  As you walk north on the Greenway, the waterfront is on your right.  When you get to the InterContinental Hotel (510 Atlantic Ave, but you'll easily see it just past the Federal Reserve Building near South Station), look for the red brick parking garage at the north end of it.  If you walk along the side of this building (look for the Independence Wharf sign near the top), you'll see a plaque near the water that mentions that this was the site of the Boston Tea Party.  There's also an observation tower at the top of this building - just go into the lobby and ask where the elevator is to it.  I believe it's free.  It's not publicized much.<br>  <br>  If you're here for the day, you may have time to see some of the Freedom Trail sites, which are pretty interesting.  All but 3 are free, and those only cost a few dollars.  If you walk up Summer St. from South Station, you'll get to Boston Common.  At the Common, go left on Tremont Street for about 2 blocks and you'll see an Information building.  They have good free maps of the Freedom Trail.  The first FT site is right in the Common.  You can also use the map for other places as you walk around the city.  If you're here on March 5, there's normally a re-enactment of the Boston Massacre outside of the Old State House, one of the Freedom Trail sites.<br>  <br>  Have a great time here in Boston!|`|Df7k9bgVaa	I don't know if you have children but the children's museum is right at south station.  They have $1 nights on friday's from 5 to 9.  Chinatown is also right near south station and you could wander around there if you wanted to.  The museum of science is great and fairly close, although you would probably have to take the T.|`|bMWRs1ffaa	Do you have kids with you? <br>  -The childrens museum is right across the bridge <br>  -the aquarium is 8 minutes away.<br>  -North End is almost like 'Little Italy' in New York exsept it's much bigger and nicer too. <br>  -Quincy Hall Market place is great for shopping, lots of stores. <br>  -You can also take a trolly tour, with is cute, you get tickets infront of the Mariot hotel. <br>  -Depending on when you are going the boats go to the Harbor islands and Georges island which has Fort Waren on it, so fun to explore. <br>  Hope that helps!!! Enjoy the greatest city ever!!
uqb7dkBbaa	As said above, we mostly shop in super and hypermarkets  (there's more of them in France per inhabitant than anywhere  in the world). Then we shop in Superette (small city supermarket shops) and for stuff like bread we go to regular shops. You still find butcher shops too, other  food shops are usually specialised with very good and expensive products. The open markets are for fresh products, like fruit or vegetable, and are not enough to face the demand of a whole city, especially when most people are at work during the day and cannot go to those markets. It is mostly women who do not work and retired people who go there during the week. <br>  Shopping pattern is  usually  Saturday for the big stuff and top it off by buying if needed or for fresh products during the week.|`|OQFSG3Ihaa	Most French people shop in hypermarkets. The main one's in my area being Auchan, Carrefour, Cora and E'Leclerc. <br>  There is a large market every week in the town in which I live, which is well attended but the prices can not compare with the large hypermarkets.|`|wwRasDZLaa	Elliot est correcte! Most of the ppl shop in the chain supermarkets he mentioned. The stereotype is of ppl going to markets (e.g. open air markets), but most working ppl are very busy and do one stop shopping in supermarkets.  On Sundays, many ppl still go to open air markets to buy fresh fruits and veggies.  It is still possible to go to individual shops to buy particular items (patisserie for pastries, boulangerie for bread, charcuterie for fresh meats/sausage, etc.).  There are also mom and pop stores that sell packaged foods and believe it or not, the prices can be double or even triple that of the supermarkets.  There are even supermarkets that sell only frozen foods.  Another observation:  the open air vendors frequently do not want customers to handle the produce.  OTOH, in supermarkets, it is often self service with the custormer weighing the produce, entering the product code and obtaining a sticker (with the name of the produce and price) to stick on the plastic bag of produce.  Another observation:  French ppl tend to eat much less breakfast cereal than American/Canadians/UK ppl.  There are the old stand-bys:  Rice Krispies, Corn Flakes and French ppl also enjoy muesli type cereals.|`|xMb7iG0Yaa	A lot of French people still rely on the open air markets to pick up fresh produce. For baked goods, one will always go to the boulangerie, for cheeses and wines, usually there are individual shops that sell items specific to what they need. So a Frenchman would actually never need to step food into a hypermarket, but still the younger generations do. Carrefour, Auchan, Champion, Casino, and E.Leclerc are most common and widely shopped at supermarkets in France. If one does not shop at a local market or small specialized shop, then that person would most likely be shopping at a hypermarket.|`|pzBN3ghLaa	they have lagre supermarkets but there new in france<br>  most people will go to markets for fruits and veggies and a bakery for bread and desserts and  a botcher for meats|`|RJRiy9oMaa	Both - It greatly depends on what regions of France.|`|eQuKskdtaa	Where I lived, in le Nord, we shopped at Ocean (kinda like Meijer or a super Walmart- although walmart sucks). They did have markets every once in a while, but no one I know lived off the market... I don't think I've ever been to a market that would have everything you need.|`|f7a95ffb339904b8e9c733373c618b80aa	throughout the week, its most likely to be ordinary shops, and then over the weekend, markets for fresh fruit and veg :)
MmTe8W8uaa	Yes.  The best viewing area on the Palisades is the place that the National Park Service runs in Fort Lee, just south of the George Washington Bridge.<br>  <br>  If you just want to see the skyline, simply take the north tube of the Lincoln tunnel to New Jersey and get into the rightmost of the three lanes that curve left around the helix.  You can see the skyline as you round the first bend of the helix.  However, you are not actually on the Palisades.
ncojw5ttaa	THE MELTING POT in Burlington/Bedford is perfect for a date. It's a fondue restaurant. Really fun experience. If you only have 2 people, they will seat you in "Lovers Lane." Request it just to make sure, but I've never had to. It's a section that seats only tables of 2 and none of the tables can see each other. It's very intimate. The food is great and so is the atmosphere. <a href="http://www.meltingpot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.meltingpot.com/</a>|`|AA11732565	I like the Red Rock Bistro in Swampscott. The food is excellent and it's a charming place on the water. They have jazz sometimes in the bar and Sunday brunch (haven't been to that). You can walk by the ocean before or after dinner if it's not too cold. But if you do get cold, they have Irish Coffee (get it with Jameson's!).<br>  Enjoy!|`|ESSougVVaa	What I would really suggest is to go do some scouting. There are a lot of places that some people think are the most romantic place in the world while another can think that same place is boring. And then you will also have the ability to check out the menu prices to make sure you dont go over budget ;)

K1GYtYryaa	The Red line goes from Cambridge to South Boston.  Its the fastest line and usually the cleanest. The orange line goes from Roxbury to Oak Grove.  Its kind of dirty and really sketchy at night.  The blue goes from Government center to Wonderland.  Definitely the dirtiest and the least used.  The Green runs from Lechmere to the South End/Back Bay area.  It is definitely the slowest line but it goes to the most place.  It splits off to four separate lines at the Copley station.  I hope this helps.  In general the system is pretty efficient but the worst part is that it stops running kind of early.(1ish)|`|URO3gDXcaa	they go to different neighborhoods and different cities.|`|G0m2kONTaa	The red line takes you from southeast of the city (Braintree and Quincy) up thru Boston to just past Cambridge & Harvard.<br>  <br>  The orange line takes you from north of Boston (Somerville, Malden) thru the city and into South Boston.<br>  <br>  The green line is several different lines, that all take you to points just west of Boston (Brighton, Allston).<br>  <br>  And the blue line takes you up toward and just beyond Logan Airport.<br>  <br>  All lines centralize in downtown Boston (the blue line and most of the green line start there).|`|Df7k9bgVaa	They all travel to different parts of the city.  For example the red line travels to Cambridge and Braintree while the green line includes Brookline and Newton.  The red line has two different branches (Ashmont and Braintree) and the green line has 4 branches (Boston College, Cleveland Circle, Riverside, and Heath Street).  In my opinion the red and green lines are nicer and feel safer.  The trains on the green line only have 1-2 cars and go above ground often and travel on the street.  The red and orange line have a lot more cars and occasionally go above ground.|`|DLwvk4XCaa	Yeah they are all different and all have good and bad parts to them.  Green line runs more frequently than the other 3 lines.  You can always find a green line Train.  Many twists and turns and many stops in the middle of stations where you are just sitting there.<br>  <br>  The Red is good once and awhile you will have a delay.  <br>  <br>  I dont really take the blue but it isnt very safe very high crime.<br>  <br>  Orange him what good can I say about it its ok.  The have delays up the wazoo though.  I am always sceptical about taking it on my way to work because you can be sitting there waiting and waiting for a good 15min before they annoce that they are having a delay, and they do not have enough trains running.<br>  <br>  They wanna talk about cutting back on the T and cutting out some of the bus routes which I think is wicked stupid on their part.  Half the buses rarely show up on time.  Some don't stop at the bus stops if there is only one person waiting, trust me I know this I have waited for buses at bus stops and have had an 86 pass me while I was waiting at the stop.|`|zfXVF2XVaa	<a href="http://www.mbta.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.mbta.com</a>
AA11375099	What I would do if you are serious about accounting.<br>  <br>  I would first take classes at a community college.  Seattle Central is where I took my classes and then I transferred into the University of Washington School of Business.<br>  <br>  But it is extremely competitive to get into.  <br>  <br>  Costs would be a place to live close to the campus: Rents for a room would run about $400-600.<br>  <br>  If you are serious about a job this sounds dumb, but I would try Dicks on Broadway.  They pay a good wage, better than most fast food places, and they will pay for your college tuition.  <br>  <br>  That is what keeps young students working there.  It is a business that understands how important education is and helps people go to college.  It has been around for over 50 years.  <br>  <br>  You will have to study hard and do well to get into the University of Washington.  You will need at least a 3.5 and then write a great essay on the admittance test (two essay tests in 1.5 hours).<br>  <br>  The college takes your best scores in:<br>  <br>  English 101 or 102 , Micro or Macro economics, your best grade from any of the accounting classes, and your best business math class (usually 116 or 117).<br>  <br>  Once admitted to the UW then you will have to pass the state exams for becoming a CPA.<br>  <br>  But I have friends that are working for hotels and other businesses with basic accounting degree from the UW.  They have a great recruiting program where businesses like Microsoft and the banking industry come to the campus and recruit.|`|WXCa8zQoaa	it is a really expensive place where do you live right now and i hope you like rain because washington has plenty|`|iaLVRwBnaa	well if you're graduating within this next year or the year after when the economy is still sucking i'd say make sure you have a job before you move here. i know some people who pick up and move and worry about the job when they get there and it all works out... but it's kind of risky with the economy the way it is right now. i graduated from college a year ago and still can't find a job that i consider to be college graduate pay and quality in the seattle area. needless to say, i have a degree in something else (not accounting) but i do know that UW in seattle has a good business school and that most of the people who graduate from there tend to stay in the area. <br>  <br>  also, things are less expensive in the midwest. seattle is one of the most expensive cities in the country to live in.|`|3VD8fWF8aa	It's really tough.  Moving will be just as hard as anywhere else, but the competition for accounting in the city is extremely tough.  Above 85% of the UW accounting students do not leave the city.  Then there are the WSU students, and WWU and CWU, most of whom go to Seattle.  BYU and the Idaho schools feed heavily into Seattle as well.<br>  <br>  It will be extra tough, but it's not impossible.|`|ESSougVVaa	The first thing I would suggest is that you take a trip to Seattle and see if you like it. And a trip that isnt seeing the sights, but really getting into the non-touristy areas and seeing if it is still what you think it is. Once youve done that then start looking for jobs. Just because you may not have finished your degree doesnt mean you cant start interviewing. A lot of places will make offers with graduation not far off. And as to cost and reasonability, if this will be your first time on your own then you may want to wait a year or two to really get used to "adult" life. Otherwise, rent a truck and pack it up!|`|6pIsnI0Saa	it is not that hard if you really want to move to Seattle just get the motivation to get up and go ! yes Seattle might be a bit more expensive then the mid west but i am sure you will adjust to that in time as you get a local job. its all about what you your self what you want to do !

AA10241919	The legislators of the State of California just passed unprecedented tax increases in the middle of one of the worst recession in history. <br>  <br>  Tens of thousands of jobs are being lost every day in California’s private sector.

Yet, each and every over paid state employee and their pensions were protected thanks to the increase in taxes. <br>  <br>  The California state legislators voted themselves a pay raise during a closed session vote and knowing that they will not be able to pass a balanced budget on time as prescribed by law. <br>  <br>  The same state legislators had fought very hard for years to ban ownership of assault rifles (including AK-47’s) in the State of California.<br>  <br>  And you’re worried about tourists shooting AK-47’s in Vietnam when Vietnamese citizens cannot own a gun (which is not quite true)? <br>  <br>  The moral of the story is you're going to find hypocrisy anywhere in the world... .|`|421fa2ed7c725ad7383fadee828b77edaa	That's not the only thing wrong with the Vietnamese gov't.

g8LLIeXKaa	The Post Office does carry (Federal and State) tax forms but i do not know if they have the "NON-RESIDENT NYS 2008 TAX BOOK" you are looking for.    I'll check around and see where might have it and if a PDF version is available for download.    If possible, call the Post Office before going to make sure they have as people will be rushing to get them.    Additional: Nonresident Income Tax Forms  http://www.tax.state.ny.us/forms/income_...    Source(s):  http://newyorkforum.us/index.php?showtop...|`|tQsxsuNPaa	Library.  The public library has all the tax forms you need.  Anywhere in the US.  Post Offices, too.      If you can't find the form you need, try H&R Block offices, or any other large CPA firm...My cousin is on Long Island...would that help?|`|xiB1BPwsaa	Yes libraries and post office have some of the most common forms.    Your best bet is to download them online:  http://www.irs.gov/formspubs/index.html|`|0S7JNY5Aaa	Just a click away at www.nystax.gov or forms request line @ 1-800-462-8100

But the one on Seawall is open and serving.|`|JITTMjasaa	Yah it's still there. If your talking about the one in Fla at the end of the pier...They don't have there wonderful raspberry dipping sauce anymore though :( The fishermans platter is awesome you should definately go. Oh and they have the best broccoli-slaw. Say hi to Maralyn while your there for me. Tell her Cory's daughter says "Hi" and that I'm happily in Cali now.|`|JbSebJJYaa	I think it still is. Amazing place to eat. I want it now !
X4FQBmo9aa	Sure its cold, its winter.  Too cold?  Never.  Just layer up.  If you happen to get too cold despite the layers then just pop into a bar, coffee shop, deli or restaurant for a quick drink or a bite.  Its hard to go a whole block without running into at least one such business.     I think Christmas in NYC is beautiful.  The whole city is covered in lights and everything seems to slow down just a little.  The restaurants and bars are warm havens and everyone seems a little bit quicker to smile once they are in out of the cold.  You don't have to wait until the week of Christmas to come.  The lights go up at Thanksgiving and most stay on past Christmas to New Years.  Given how unpredictable the weather can be, I wouldn't swear that the first week of december is going to be any warmer than the end of December.    As far as New Years Eve here goes, its over rated.  Sure there's the whole scene at Times Square, but there is no booze allowed there, bathrooms are nearly impossible to find, the place gets so crowded that you have to go early, which means a lot of waiting around in the cold.  Needless to say the majority of locals avoid the Times Square scene and the few there are usually there, because some out of town friend or relative drug them to it.  For New Years its best to find a party at someone's apartment or to find a small local bar that isn't doing the velvet rope routine.      In summary: Anytime in December is great and worth the cold nose.      Hope that's helped some.|`|f8aa8e21997cfa7908574dfa12f124cdaa	My friend, New York City is very nice during the Christmas, despite of cold. My advice, if you want to spend Christmas and New Years in the Big Apple go head. Just make sure you pack plenty of warm clothes.    Good luck
2yOxIYLkaa	Hello,<br>  <br>  Sorry about the trollish answers on the Greek and Turk sections,they have been polluting our sections for years now.<br>  <br>  Anyway,could you not see both? Its a small island,im sure if you were there for more than a week ud have more than enough time.<br>  <br>  South side will have alot of tourists but its more secure financially,the North is said to have better landscapes.|`|LMo8HaA2aa	If you have to choose, remember that holiday is a personal matter. So, it depends on what you expect to see. <br>  In any case, just remember those things:<br>  1. which places has more and/or cheaper flights from your country? which place is more easily accessible?<br>  2. which place is more easy to visit and tour around?<br>  3. read some internet sources about both and focus on the kind of tourism they offer and tourists they get (they have elite, casual type of tourism, have mostly young people or preferred by families, offer ecotourism, some kind of touristic accommodation that may offer tours as well, internet booking etc).<br>  4. go to the place, where the hotel manager will show to you (to your mails/communication) professional interest.<br>  <br>  I have been to Southern Cyprus many years ago. It was a great experience, people were very friendly, it was very clean and had very beautiful houses and villas.|`|zm2zlbO7aa	Northern part is not much of a holiday destination. Recommended if sun and sea is only what you're looking for<br>  On the other hand the southern part is a much more developed side (being part of the EU), much more organized and beautiful. It has the cleanest beaches of Europe and it offers a large range of activities for all ages<br>  Since it's a family holiday i would recommend going to Protaras, a great luxuriant town for relaxing and dining out, with the well known party-town of Ayia Napa being a 15 min drive away.<br>  Also you cn take your kids (?) to the largest waterpark of Europe in ayia napa and visit ancient greek and roman monuments in Paphos and Limassol|`|28f3beb29b657d3d0b6851852a284a79aa	Go to both so users of both Greek and Turkish section are happy.
56bNLJykaa	I'm not sure there is any difference in afraid of a plane being hi-jacked.. I think more likely an engine failure or mid-air collision- there have been three notable collisions since 2000, the one in 2006 killed 154 people. Either way, I am minor-ly afraid of flying|`|41f250e890923fedf85e19be6b82cb3faa	It's the same as it was before, if anything it's safer.<br>  <br>  The reason many people now fear flying is because we have been systematically indoctrinated to be fearful. <br>  <br>  Fear is a very useful tool for those who would rule us, how would Bush have got away with what he did, if there were not a fearful population.|`|AQPmrsVSaa	I felt it was safe before, and I feel that it is just as safe today.<br>  <br>  It is, however, becoming more and more expensive and inconvenient.|`|KTtLYrcZaa	its much safer now cuz the airports are more safer and strict.... i feel uncomfortable when i fly on a plane... but i wish i knew the feeling of flying like superman....|`|ZleVRevVaa	person is not safe anywhere these days|`|8vfCRg7Caa	I guess on a scale 1-10 how much i worry about my safety on a plane or a terrorist taking it over post or before 9-11 is the same. -5 Sorry planes are great. i like to get the window seat and stare out the window and look at all the landscape and the patterns. I like to sit next to that person who just wants to talk to somebody on what they do, or howfrustratingg their life is but they cant tell anybody else. i like to just fall asleep and here nothing but air going over the wings and my ears popping and the stewardess waking me up to ask me what i want to eat, "chicken or meat" And what would i like to drink "sprite or coke". Ive been on so many airplanes i could probably do like the movie almost famous where kate hudson does the whole spew on "safety". <br>  <br>  I dont think some "bad guys" are going to deter me from flying. One of the only places you can relax and feel like a king and feel like you left earth for two seconds. im just hoping i can make it to first or business class one day.|`|5b820805b9932bc37844045b822eddbeaa	It is safe more than ever because the hi-jackers themselves are still alive so we are very safe....<br>  <br>  I'm glad you asked that question in your mind and the answer is in the last section of the movie "Loose Change".<br>  <br>  We have been safe all along thanks to OUR country planing a training exercise on the same day of these events on 9/11.|`|s2IOyj8iaa	There are around 5,000 commercial flights flying daily in the world . It's rare to hear about one getting into trouble. Your safer flying than spending that time driving a car. Security is very tough and has been tightened up a lot . I enjoy flying and have done plenty of flying . always good|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	The exceptional events of 9/11 did not change the safety of air travel, despite their notoriety.

G2h8g2g1aa	There are no "real" Italian neighborhoods in Chicago anymore.  There used to be one south of Chinatown, one along Taylor (Little Italy) and on 26th as well...    You're talking about the Heart of Chicago neighborhood: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_West_... which is basically in Pilsen, a Hispanic neighborhood.  There is a very small Italian community around 24th or 25th & Oakley, but that's all that's left.|`|gkqSk29Zaa	Possibly but the majority of the people that live their are Hispanic.

ZSAbJEv6aa	Honestly?  I would feel really disgusted at myself for buying him those tickets, it was a chance of a lifetime and I blew it.  Although I didn't know at the time those number combination would even win a prize but still...<br>  <br>  That would probably be my first reaction upon learning. As an afterthought, I would ask myself...would have those numbers won if I bought it for myself?  Wasn't there a hand intervening to help that friend at a time when he was feeling so depressed over the loss of something irreplaceable and of great value to him?  <br>  <br>  At least, it would comfort me to know I made a friend very happy.  And yes, myself too because he shared a portion of his prize money which I wouldn't have had he not won. =)|`|AA10258539	The only reason you bought the tickets was to cheer up your friend. You would not have bought them otherwise. Look at it this way, you did what a good friend would do. You made ￡500 by helping cheer up a friend. No regrets. The money was not meant for you. <br>  <br>  Hey, for what its worth, you are a good person. He is lucky to be your friend. Ahemmm.... I lost my wallet too. Lol.|`|aJB1OPoFaa	"pera na naging bato pa" but I think he should give you some money as a credit on what you did ...and tha's good he gave you some of that money but if that's gonna happen to me oh well I'm glad that he's happy and I would just move everything happens for a reason right?|`|NXBmcEz7aa	May be if I kept it, it won't win any price anyway.  That was really <br>  meant for  him/her. That would be the best consolation I could give myself.|`|ZNQgd84faa	I would feel the same....and be grateful for the 500.<br>  Now you have learned your lesson, never give lottery tickets as a gift.|`|RqM1wUQyaa	Those money are really his. If your the one who scratched those tickets then it might have been a different results. He can buy a nice used car with those money thru Craigslist.|`|dnH339elaa	What can I say?  You did the right thing.  And he did the right thing too  I wouldn't have it any other way.|`|cUQI6xPUaa	If I were in your situation, I'd be happy for my friend and gratefully accept the ￡500 he gave.<br>  <br>  Honestly, my first reaction would be negative. I'd regret having given him the ticket or maybe I'd blame myself for my "stupidity". After a while (probably a few minutes later) I'd realize that I gave the tickets willingly to console my friend. This is not stupidity but love for a friend. Then, I'd praise God because he made me a channel of His blessing.|`|AtjlmByAaa	"OMG" talaga, very sayang naman. but good for your friend he has a friend like you, if I were you, of course it will be if not my biggest, but most probably one of my biggest regret.  But who knows, if you keep the ticket, the numbers will not be anymore the winning numbers.  Perhaps its really destined for him, but still, rejoice coz you've precisely caused a one very happy person. God bless your good heart.|`|z5fFoTMBaa	I'm an android of my word. What I've said or done, I seldom take it back. Of course, I'd feel like I missed out on something. Deep inside, I'd probably be stoning myself. But, I would feel a sense of happiness and contentment that my friend won ￡5,000 and I got a ￡500 balato. It means that my friend acknowledges my efforts. I'd still be happy for my (cursed) friend.|`|1NTjyGblaa	I would feel REALLY BUMMED ABOUT IT. But I know I could accept it since I've been through something like that before and I know I wouldn't have made a different decision at that exact time so... :p<br>  <br>  what the heck at least your friend gave you some of the money lol.|`|7awb0wgWaa	It sounds common...<br>  I think that i would feel the same way too. But look at the bright side -  u didnt know and it was for a good cause. Relax.<br>  Maybe u could also ask him to take u to a strip bar or smth. that way u'll do something together and it will be fun!|`|ERdlvVx3aa	exactly same thing you did. thats a nice feeling to cheer a friend.|`|MP8gISwEaa	hey, he lost his parents.  and his pictures of them.  even 5,000 cant replace the pictures or his parents.  thats the best you can do, and you cheered him up.  dont make him feel any worse.  dont make him feel guilty taht he won.  take it easy.  you got to ur  goal.  if it makes him feel better, if he offers some money, take it and be grateful u have a nice friend.  if offers 500, ask for 200.  he'll be happy for the money, ur friendship and giving u some money|`|yh2hr3Vfaa	I would be happy for my friend and grateful he shared 500 of it with me.<br>  I think your getting depressed over it is childish.|`|BC9nPXG7aa	i'd feel really stupid|`|CuYQ57mjaa	If I were you, I'll be grateful for the ￡500.  However, your friend should have returned the favor to cheer you up  by buying you 3 lottery tickets.  If you won, you can give him 10% of your winnings but if not, well then at least you had your chance and you are not lucky as he was.|`|a14b96b25b5bf9293d533f13874f2a6aaa	I would feel just like you. Happy for my friend to win but SO upset that I had bought the ticket and just gave it away....along with all that money!<br>  I wish I could say that I wouldn't feel resentment, and just be thrilled for my friend but I am not that evolved yet.<br>  Sorry this happened to you. I am always afraid of that happening to me so I am no longer buying lottery tickets for my friends!|`|wOA2Mf6Naa	If I gave it away I gave it away, but I would expect him to buy me dinner..|`|Ikw0ssJ6aa	I already give it to him... walang bawian... maybe a balato will do...
WT7Gub0Xaa	Cherkassy, maybe kirovograd.Liviv is about 4hrs away also as i think there is now an express train to Liviv from Kiev, but you would need to check that out.  possibly also Sumy.  best thing is to look on the internet, and have a look at dpartures and arrivals, and see where you could get to in 4hrs|`|AA11691405	Lviv is further than four hours.  On the west side of Kyiv, Rivne is four hours on the express from Kyiv.  Zhitomir is closer to Kyiv, Lviv is about two hours farther west than Rivne.
G7p4D5H5aa	I am a Taiwanese girl lives in Taipei right now. I like Taiwan very much, Obviously it is my lovely hometown. <br>  Taipei is an interesting city, there are so many memory hall, various of local foods set in the night markets, lots of traditions festival hold in the different seasons, such as sky lantern festival, dragon boat festival or mid autumn moon festival and so on....You can go everywhere by metro. The shops and the restaurants are normally opens till mid night, therefore, it is very convience to get the foods here.<br>  People are friendly in this small country. English teacher is very popular nowadys and if you are a native speaker, you definitely can get a good pay. Some people might said Taipei is kind of diry city...but I don't agree with it totally, some places are quite clean; other please are dirty.That is because many people ride the motorbike and makes the air pollution bad or some people just don't fellow the rules and throw the rubbish in everywhere...but I am sure, you still can see most of the areas at Taipei is pretty good. Every one speak Chinese as Mandarin here and some of people can speak very good Taiwanese language. If you get lost,  young people can speak english with giving you the right directions.<br>  If you are not sure  you want to live here or rather choose to go other places, you should come to Taiwan at least once to experience the different traditions and life here!|`|XVfFZuiLaa	Yes and no.  Everywhere has its ups and downs.  Pollution, hellish traffic, and language might be barriers you can't overcome. <br>  <br>  However, with a 4 year degree, you can teach and save money while working 20 - 30 hours a week and enjoy the nicer areas of Taiwan or encourage a skill/hobby of yours that you might otherwise never have the chance.|`|NQmphE4maa	I lived in Taiwan for 5 years. Always in Taichung County in the middle of the island. <br>  <br>  Taiwan treated me well. No police harassment.

What are you going to replace it with?   Please throw us with your acumen:-P    Edit: Be careful when you use the word "Power". Power corrupts (regardless of who is having it)...and absolute power corrupts absolutely. ;-)))|`|AA12350023	oops. I thought you were talking about America... my bad :P|`|AA10523012	I am lost. Is this a tricky question? What children are you talking about?|`|DSVUvfGuaa	What is your problem with the Saudi government ? do you live there ? and what about these children? Are you talking about Saudi Arabia or Palestine? as far as I know about the children, well yes, the last Israeli war against the Palestinians many children were killed while the whole world stood there saying nothing. That was not the Al Sauds.  I hope that I have not heart any buddys feeling in writing the truth.   With all my respect|`|oCghHVcdaa	Err... I think your grammar is wrong. It should be " to overthrow" NOT "to overthrown".    The word "to" denotes action that will happen in the future like to die, to work, to drink, etc....     You have written an action word after the word "to" which is a past tense of "overthrow".     So yes, I think your grammar is wrong.|`|uvx3cnkJaa	Saudi children enjoy much more luxuries than any other children in the whole world.. you really don't know what you're talking about so I'm out lool|`|WIEH455laa	Every government in the World is some kind of corrupt. There are negatives about Al Saud, but they have also taken care of their people. Education, Economy and security are excellent, so I guess I can't complain.

9N6sW6KAaa	whats your question|`|pcHp7Dgkaa	If you're applying from India, this notice is on the Australian High Commission website:    "Important News for Student Visa Applicants and Education Agents  The New Delhi Visa Office has seen a significant increase in the number of applications received. As a result, processing times are currently at 12-14 weeks for a student visa application lodged at the New Delhi Visa Office. Your course should not commence until at least 12-14 weeks after you lodge your application."  http://www.ausgovindia.com/ndli/Visas_an...    If you have a typo in your date above and really mean that you applied om 4 Jan 2009, it doesn't look good for getting your visa in time. If the 2008 date is correct, something has obviously gone wrong with your application and you should have had your visa ages ago.|`|cWmROVe1aa	im sorry im not really sure about this but...  january 4th 2008??  since its already 2009, does that mean you have been waiting a whole year? i would definitely get in contact with someone a.s.a.p...i think you should get into contact with the australian high commission. i know for a fact that australia is very strict on visa's and immigration, but i cant imagine that you would been left a whole year without an answer.   please get on that, i would hate to see you miss your chance to go to australia! im heading there next year :)
IYF4xSTdaa	even more so ..but we do have laws,which we uphold..and they are the same as the..USA.|`|U9bQgfY9aa	Since the Patriot Act was passed in the USA, Canada is a much freer country than the USA.    Did you not notice that the Patriot act replaced real freedom with the illusion of freedom.|`|azypqsphaa	Canada is THE free-est country in the world...the usa is a joke, it's oppressed, racist and homophobic....|`|4INE794zaa	Indeed it is. Even more so. Our citizens are free to marry an adult partner of their choosing, even if of the same sex. We have Freedom of Speech, same as you, but it does not cover Hate speech, which I believe is a good thing. Freedom of Religion, and more importantly, Freedom of Conscience, which means even "non-beliefs" are protected. About the only thing we don't enjoy here is a "right to bear arms" and the majority of Canadians wouldn't want to be able to. Weapons breed fear, and we actually have a rather low violent crime rate when comparing cities of likewise population.|`|X2ZsYRNWaa	Less so than the US.      You can be charged for talking about ungood things.  We have no property rights so technically the government owns everything and can take it from you without paying.  And if you are arrested you don't get to have a lawyer present during questioning.   And if you break certain laws you don;t even get to see your lawyer before questioning and can be jailed for refusing to provide evidence against yourself.  And mere peasants have no right to carry tools to defend themselves, only judges and politicians get that right.    But the privacy rights are a lot better than in the states.  When you apply for a firearms licence the RCMP have no way of checking if you have been hospitalized for a mental illness and have to take your word that your sane.|`|V8yR8BU1aa	Yeah, actually very similar freedoms as the USA does.    You have the Bill of Rights  We have the Charter of Rights and Freedoms    We both have Judicial Review    Virtually all the rights in the Charter reflect the Bill of Rights in the United States.    You guys, for the most part, follow Common Law, which is what all of Canada with the exception of Quebec also follows.    Both Canada and the United States have VERY similar freedoms and rights.    However, as for which country has slightly  more freedoms, the United States has slightly more freedoms and rights.  Such inclusions as "The Right to Bear Arms".    The USA also has more freedoms in regarding property ownership and rgiths.      Good example:  In Canada, a landowner does not own any mineral rights underneath their land.  The Crown does.  In the United States the landowner has mineral rights.  So.. in Canada... the Beverely Hillbillies could have never happened :)|`|2wyDALHgaa	More so if you ask me.|`|0fc71d93282bf1baaa4cd5f250fd7a07aa	Yes it certainly is         Source: Myself|`|ygTr3fvVaa	God keep our land glorious and FREE!|`|65fef61f322f25075280c35b20f9c4f8aa	Yes, Canada is considered a free country because you are allowed to speak your mind or say just about anything and not face imprisonment or persecution for saying it. You are allowed to live anywhere in the country and do not have to get permission from the government to do so.    We have the same basic laws as in USA, although we do have some that some Americans may be opposed to, such as our gun control laws.    There are of course limits, such as you cannot say things that are hateful to a group of people, or that may incite people to harm others.     And the province of Quebec has certain laws meant to protect the French culture that exists there, such as requiring French-only signs in public buildings. But if we don't like the local Quebec regulations, we are free to move to another province that does not have that requirement.    Canada and USA have more similarities than differences...don't let people tell you otherwise. I think comedian Robin Williams said it best when he stated "Canada is like a loft apartment over a really cool party...".|`|Twzg9s0caa	Yes it is, but you have to realize there is no such thing as a totally free country. Not Canada, the US or England. There are always sleazy government times up to something in all those countries. Not that I am paranoid....|`|uqKpjV6qaa	Oui|`|DTNlqnOEaa	Master P     You are so WRONG , on so many things, where shall I start ?    Here , word for word, is the standard  " caution to arrested persons ", that EVERY Canadian Police officer reads to the person he has arrested, WHEN they are taken into custody.....    You have the right to remain silent, but anything that you do say maybe taken down in writing, and later  given  in a court of law, as evidence .    You have the right to have a lawyer present, during any questioning, and if you cannot afford to hire a lawyer, one will be provided for you, at no cost to you. Do you understand your rights, as I have read them to you ?     As for property rights in Canada, where did you get your law degree ? If there are no  personal property rights, why do we go to such great lengths to record and search property records, when a house is bought or  sold ?  How about vehicles or boats, are they not registered and licensed ?    If you are going to spout off here, be prepared to back up your words with facts.     Jim B.

fMBREYmNaa	moon and rain are amazing|`|Vz5vjAWRaa	Best Answer - Chosen by Asker<br>  I been and I will tell you the truth. If your two guys its VERY hard to get inside and you'll be waiting outside the clubs for 2-3 hours unless you slip the doorman $100 bucks to the clubs below because they are the hottest clubs in vegas and they know people will pay money to get in!! Second, if you decide to get a table with your friend, bottle service is expensive being $300-$450 a bottle of Vodka plus mix drinks and other things, but you will have an interview of beautiful women wanting to come sit down with you because you have a table and the tables are reserve for people that have bottle service and usually are upstairs on the second floors while you look over the balcony at the dance floor.. Now if you guys are ladies then you usually get in free or bring a 1-2 ratio 2 girls for 1 guy and smokin hot then you have a better chance of getting in with paying the doorman, you just pay the regular price which is $30 bucks or so.. So if your doing a table i would say a grand would cover it!! I know its expensive but if you want to look like the big baller you have to come looking good. If you just plan to get in and dance with a table, hang out a bit and leave i would say $100 is good.. Anything else let me know i have friends in the business if you need my help..<br>  <br>  The hot clubs are below but they can be VERY expensive and hard to get in if you dont know any of the bouncers or host.. I have the hookup to the clubs also.<br>  XS at Wynn<br>  Rum-Jungle inside Mandalay Bay<br>  Prive inside Planet-Hollywood<br>  Jet inside the Mirage<br>  Pure inside Caesars palace, one of my favorites<br>  Tryst inside the Wynn|`|HYoUVfBYaa	there are a ton of options when you go clubbing in vegas.

2WxxStXIaa	The Now very popular real Canada.<br>  <br>  <br>  8. Discriminatory and Dishonest Immigration System.<br>  Immigration to Canada is based on a point system, obtained with your education, qualifications and job experience. Points are good enough for immigration, but in Canada, they are not good enough to get a job in your field. Amazing, how the credentials that qualify you to come to Canada are the same credentials that don't qualify you for your profession in Canada. The reason is, Canada only wants immigrants to do the labor jobs - pizza delivery, driving taxis, factory work etc.<br>  <br>  <br>  7. Out Of Control Cost Of Living.<br>  From rent, to utility bills, to shopping, to phone, internet and cable bills, to gas, to car insurance, to eating out, to basically anything you have to pay for or buy, the cost of living in Canada has become astronomical. Recent immigrants are astonished as to how expensive everything is. It is estimated that compared to most countries around the world, the cost of living in Canada is on average five times greater.<br>  <br>  <br>  6. Health Care Crisis.<br>  Practicing physicians in Canada are in a shortage, 1 in 4 Canadians cannot get a family doctor. Canadian doctors are leaving to move permanently to the United States. Statistics Canada and the Canadian Medical Association both have identified that for every 1 American doctor that moves to Canada, 19 (nineteen) Canadian doctors move to the United States! Doctors in Canada are overworked and underpaid, and there is a cap on their salaries.<br>  <br>  <br>  5. Very High Taxes.<br>  Yes, you have the GST, the PST, totaling 15%, on practically everything you purchase and many other taxes taken out of our weekly paycheck. You have to pay a whopping amount to the government, out of your hard earned salary, so that the government can turn around and give it to beer drinking, hockey watching welfare bums. Fair? It does not matter, it's Canada.<br>  <br>  <br>  4. Money Hungry Government.<br>  Canadian Embassies around the world lie to foreigners, painting this picture that Canada is Utopia, because they want them to come to Canada. Why? Because foreigners bring money! So after being deceived, these foreigners come. They must bring with them at least $10,000. Canada has an immigration quota of 250,000 per year. So please do the math, 250,000 multiplied by $10,000 each equals a whopping 2.5 Billion dollars that Canada gains from immigrants every year.<br>  <br>  <br>  3. No Culture.<br>  Unlike almost every other country in the world, Canada has no culture. Actually American culture is what dominates Canada. When was the last time you had some 'Canadian' food? There are no Canadian traditions and there is no national identity. What does it even mean to call yourself a 'Canadian'. . .nothing really. People living in Canada, still identify themselves with the country they 'originally' came from.<br>  <br>  <br>  2. Worst Weather.<br>  Yes, Canada has the worst weather conditions of any country in the world. Freezing cold temperatures, snow, ice, hail, winds, storms etc. From the Prairie provinces to the Maritimes, from the Territories to southern Ontario, the weather is so horrific and disgusting that many Canadians leave Canada simply because of this reason alone.<br>  <br>  <br>  1. No Jobs.<br>  Yes, coast to coast, there are no jobs. Immigrants are highly qualified (MD's, PhD's, Lawyers, Engineers etc.) but they are driving taxi cabs, delivering pizza's or working in factories. Even people with bachelors degrees from Canadian Universities cannot find jobs after graduation. This is the tragedy associated with immigration to Canada. I feel sorry for those immigrants who are stuck in Canada for the rest of their lives. It is indeed a very sad and hopeless future.|`|3QsPl1uLaa	It is a big country. Life is different in the far north than here in Toronto.<br>  Cities are different than life in small towns.<br>  Canada is a very law-bidding place compared to most countries.

They'll help you get better.<br>  Almost everyone speaks some french, as it is taught usually from kindergarten till grade 12. <br>  Driving around town, you can see mountains, beaches, forests, and skyscrapers all in one area. <br>  <br>  As I said. Overall, it's awesome.|`|rDtl7aGdaa	40 per cent of professional and skilled immigrants leave Canada within 5 years<br>  <br>  Canadian HR Reporter<br>  March 27, 2009<br>  <br>  By Shannon Klie<br>  <br>  While Canada does a good job attracting skilled and educated immigrants from around the world, government and businesses need to do a better job of keeping them once they get here, says a professor of economics at the University of Western Ontario in London, Ont.<br>  <br>  "We spend a fair amount of time and discussion on attracting immigrants, but we don't spend that much time on talking about retaining them. It's almost as if there's the notion that if they can get here, it's such a great place, they'll stay," said Chris Robinson.<br>  <br>  Immigration isn't a permanent phenomenon and Canada needs to approach it as a firm would approach retaining an employee, he said. "We don't want to take it as a given that just because somebody's come here that they're going to stay."<br>  <br>  One-third of young male immigrants leave Canada within 20 years of arriving and more than 60 per cent of those who leave do so in the first year, according to Return and Onward Migration among Working Age Men, a recent Statistics Canada report co-authored by Robinson.<br>  <br>  The report, a study of male immigrants aged 25 to 45 at the time they arrived in Canada, found that over the past two decades business professionals and skilled workers, the most desirable immigrants, are the most likely to leave, with 40 per cent of them leaving the country within 5 years of arrival.<br>  <br>  Because there are no exit interviews when an immigrant leaves Canada, the study made inferences about why they left based on landing records, census data and income tax filings. Immigrants who arrived during poor economic climates (in 1980 and 1990) were more likely to leave than those who arrived during boom times (1986 and 1996). Therefore, it's likely immigrants are leaving for better opportunities elsewhere, said Robinson.<br>  <br>  The best way to keep these immigrants is to ensure they get jobs that match their skills and experiences, said the director of operations at the Toronto Region Immigrant Employment Council.<br>  <br>  "We know that good employment is the number one indicator of successful integration for immigrants," said Elizabeth McIsaac. "A key element in all this is having employers involved in the development of programs that are intended to bring immigrants into the labour market."<br>  <br>  One such program is Toronto's Career Bridge, a non-profit internship program that matches qualified immigrants with appropriate jobs. Since the program started three years ago, 270 immigrants have found full-time work in their fields, but there are still 1,500 skilled immigrants, more than half with university degrees, on the waiting list. So far only 115 of the city's 2,760 businesses with more than 100 employees have signed up for the program.<br>  <br>  HR professionals need to begin looking at international credentials and education as an asset, said McIsaac. There are tools available to help HR understand international credentials and agencies that can connect employers with immigrants, so employers have no excuse not to consider immigrants for job openings, she said.<br>  <br>  "Once you begin to have more experience working with immigrant communities, it becomes a lot easier and you can do it a lot better," she said.<br>  <br>  If Canadian employers aren't willing to take advantage of these immigrants, the Statistics Canada report proves they'll go elsewhere to find jobs, said Robinson.<br>  <br>  "If a better opportunity comes up somewhere else and it happens to come up across an international border, then they're quite likely to move," he said.<br>  <br>  Over the next 10 years, immigration will represent all of the growth in Canada's workforce because there simply won't be enough young Canadians to replace retiring baby boomers. However, Canada isn't the only country facing a looming labour shortage and other countries that haven't typically gone after immigrants, such as Japan and India, are now doing so, said McIsaac.<br>  <br>  "We are in a global economy and we are competing for a high level of talent in other countries," she said. "We have to do a better job of receiving that talent|`|8OREBeRdaa	Pretty much the same.<br>  - we love our Tim Horton's and good beer.<br>  - we love hockey as much as the US love baseball<br>  - we have stricter gun laws<br>  - since we around 10% of the population or so of the US, that means it's a LOT less hectic<br>  - drinking ages range from 18-19 depending on where you are<br>  - I think Gaelic and Celtic music is more prevalent<br>  <br>  That's all I can think of.|`|dq2i6NrAaa	We all live in igloos. <br>  Its very cold. <br>  Never above 0 C.<br>  We control our eating urges<br>  people are nice to each other and don't shoot each other <br>  People like to put litter into garbage cans.<br>  For entertainment we like to go seal hunting, sledding or hockey.<br>  You can buy any kind of medical pills in bulk at the grocery store. <br>  Our Beer tastes a little like heaven|`|6pIsnI0Saa	yes very similar to the United State except a few minor Differences besides those we are pretty much exactly the same ! just remember Canada and United States are like cousins we are in the same family but not fully blood related !

To me, Florida's weather in August is as useless as January here in Wisconsin.  Here you freeze, there you die of heat.<br>  <br>  But, if you have to go, you will NOT need a jacket or sweatshirt or anything like that, so at least you can pack light.

Problem with that is that minimum wage does not equal living wage here in Hawaii.  Tourism is our leading industry & it is down with the recession.  When the economy is bad, one of the first things people cut back on is travel.  Our occupancy rates are down to about 60%.  That means that the hotels & restaurants are laying people off. That means you will have an extremely hard time finding work.  One of the reasons local businesses are reluctant to hire people from the mainland is that they train you, get you up to where you are just getting proficient at your new job, & ... you quit... cause your 6 month working vacation is all pau (that means done).<br>  <br>  I hate to be so discouraging, but it's just a bad time for pulling off your idea.|`|BAlntsndaa	Hawai'i is expensive for everything from milk/bread to housing. Do you have some unique skills to offer that make you any more employable than the people who live there and are struggling to find work? Do you know anything about the cultures there beyond it would be cool to live near a beach and go surfing? Can you even pronounce the language which is used on most businesses and street signs? Are you aware that the islands are overcrowded with people who think it would be great to live there? Save for an extended vacation first.|`|S5ZYHiFaaa	if you want to live in hawaii, the least expensive place is here on the big island. besides kauai, it has the most natural beauty out of all the islands, also there are less tourists here and all the hawaiian culture without the insufferable commercialism.|`|Bv0dPwCDaa	6 months in Hawaii, fun!<br>  Saving money to go, necessary<br>  Expensive, of course!<br>  20,000.00 would be just enough!<br>  ahhhh!

N4ZAzxdMaa	The origin story of Bangalore, as told by The Register, is in line with what the tourist guides said. Namely, the original name in old Karnataka was "Benda Kaal Ooru" or "boiled beans town" and derives from a King who was lost and some local person showed kindness by giving him some boiled beans to eat.|`|cWuumdy7aa	Karnataka is a state in the southern part of India. It was created on November 1, 1956, with the passing of the States Reorganisation Act. Originally known as the State of Mysore, it was renamed Karnataka in 1973.<br>  <br>  Karnataka is bordered by the Arabian Sea to the west, Goa to the northwest, Maharashtra to the north, Andhra Pradesh to the east, Tamil Nadu to the southeast, and Kerala to the southwest. The state covers an area of 74,122 sq mi (191,976 km2), or 5.83% of the total geographical area of India. It is the eighth largest Indian state by area, the ninth largest by population and comprises 29 districts. Kannada is the official and most widely spoken language.<br>  <br>  Though several etymologies have been suggested for the name Karnataka, the generally accepted one is that Karnataka is derived from the Kannada words karu and nādu, meaning elevated land. Karu nadu may also be read as Karu (black) and nadu (region), as a reference to the black cotton soil found in the Bayaluseeme region of Karnataka. The British used the word Carnatic (sometimes Karnatak) to describe both sides of peninsular India, south of the Krishna River.[3]<br>  <br>  With an antiquity that dates to the paleolithic, Karnataka has also been home to some of the most powerful empires of ancient and medieval India. The philosophers and musical bards patronised by these empires launched socio-religious and literary movements which have endured to the present day. Karnataka has contributed significantly to both forms of Indian classical music, the Carnatic (Karnataka Music) and Hindustani traditions. Writers in the Kannada language have received the most number of Jnanpith awards in India. Bangalore is the capital city of the state and is at the forefront of the rapid economic and technological development that India is experiencing.|`|otWYoMgdaa	Karnataka got its name in 1973 <br>  that could b from .[1] Karu nadu may also be read as Karu(black) and nadu(region); as a reference to the black cotton soil found in the Bayaluseemae region of Karnataka.[2] During the British Raj, the words Carnatic or Karnatak were used to describe this part of the region in general. Historically, the name Carnatic region applied to the regions below the Western Ghats (Coorg and Kerala) as well as regions in present day Andhra Pradesh (Telingana)|`|1728e3faa2e928d93180946b2c15295daa	Originally Karnataka was known as the State of Mysore.  It  was renamed as Karnataka in 1973 mainly because Kannada is the official and widely spoken language in that State..
f5af79d31cc0946cad302ef0300bbe04aa	You didn't provide information regarding yours and his citizenship.  That will play big when crossing any international border.  <br>  <br>  You will need a passport to cross anyways if you are an american citizen.  The passport can be made to have your sons name in it too.  The passport office will sort out the paperwork long before you travel and issue you a passport if indeed you and your son are legit!|`|siHN027laa	That;s a good question.<br>  Usually, when one parent takes a child across the border (or attempts to leave from a US airport on an international flight), you have to have a notarized letter from the other parent authorizing the childs departure from the country.<br>  This came about when so many folks were having marriage or custody problems and the government didn't want one parent to "kidnap" a child (or children) by taking them out of the states.<br>  Probably be best just to call an  international airline or nearest office of the government dealing with passports. Believe it is U.S. Department of State.|`|818a6c4a96262d3d9669cd5c91b5efaeaa	Well, for many reasons, it would be best for you to get a court order of sole custody of your son.  That way his birth father cannot show up at some time and try to claim parental rights.  Passports for children require signature of both parents or a court order of sole custody.  When the father cannot be found , there is a form you must fill out.  see 1st and 2nd sites below.  You can ask at the passport office at the post office if you do not understand all this.  But....first...I really believe you are going to need the services of a lawyer to get a court order of sole custody.   You are also required to have a letter of permission to take the child out of the country...this is another reason you must get a court order of sole custody.  Your son CANNOT be added to your passport...each person, even infants must have their own passport.   No airline can give you advice on any of this...it is not their business to deal with this at all.|`|9a375ef442c198cfdcc3e428c5267f16aa	I would think if  his father is not identified on his birth certificate or any other legal documents stating his relationship to him then you should be able to. It sounds like you have sole rights.<br>  <br>  Also, assuming your son was born here....As long as your son isn't considered to be of adult age in America where he could choose to stay or not then again I don't foresee a problem.

g4APbW4Naa	I've found that the Amtrak Acela service is very fast - for me, it's faster and more convenient than taking a plane.<br>  <br>  The Acela Express from New York to Boston takes about 3 1/2 hours.  The 12:03 pm from NY Penn Station arrives in Boston South Station at 3:35 pm.<br>  <br>  While the plane might cover the distance faster, the train station is in downtown New York City, while the airports (Laguardia + JFK) are out in Queens, a long cab or train ride from downtown.  So you have to count this as part of the travel time...<br>  <br>  On a day with a lot of traffic, a cab could take an hour or more to reach the airport.  Also, they tell you to arrive at the airport at least an hour before your flight, to allow for baggage check, security check, etc.<br>  <br>  The Acela train ends up being faster when you factor all this in.|`|41ERg1Gvaa	Despite Amtrak's ad campaigns, most business travelers who aren't particularly concerned about cost or the environment prefer to fly, because that's faster IF you don't encounter any delays in the airport or in traffic leaving the airport.  How much faster depends on how early you get to the airport, whether you're able to squeeze on an earlier flight standby, and where you're starting/ending in each city relative to the airport/train station.|`|URO3gDXcaa	for a project?  schoolwork?  library please.|`|pTLcvsVfaa	Well a plane might be faster, but you have to get out there like an hour before your flight. Not to mention the extra drive to LGA and everything. Not to mention the fact that planes are delayed about half the time. Then you have to get from Boston airport to downtown which can take a while.<br>  <br>  In the end, its probably about the same.|`|f8aa8e21997cfa7908574dfa12f124cdaa	My friend, the plane will be faster. A fight from LaGuardia to Boston-Logan will on take about an hour. However, if you preferred not to deal with security and the long delays at LGA, my advice take the train.<br>  <br>  Both the Acela and the Northeast Regional will get you there in about 3 and a half hours.<br>  <br>  Good luck

New York is often referred to as New York State to distinguish it from New York City.<br>  <br>  THERE IS A HUGH DIFFERENCE <br>  <br>  Contrasting with New York City's urban atmosphere, the VAST majority of the state is dominated by farms, forests, rivers, mountains, and lakes. New York's Adirondack Park is the largest state park in the United States. It is larger than the Yellowstone, Yosemite, Grand Canyon, Glacier and Olympic National Parks combined.[citation needed] New York established the first state park in the United States at Niagara Falls in 1885. Niagara Falls, on the Niagara River as it flows from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario, is a popular attraction. The Hudson River begins with Lake Tear of the Clouds and flows south through the eastern part of the state without draining Lakes George or Champlain. Lake George empties at its north end into Lake Champlain, whose northern end extends into Canada, where it drains into the Richelieu and then the St. Lawrence Rivers. Four of New York City's five boroughs are on the three islands at the mouth of the Hudson River: Manhattan Island, Staten Island, and Brooklyn and Queens on Long Island.<br>  <br>  "Upstate" and "Downstate" are common terms used to distinguish New York State counties north of suburban Westchester and Rockland counties, on the one hand, from the New York City metropolitan area on the other. Upstate New York typically includes the Catskill and Adirondack Mountains, the Shawangunk Ridge, the Finger Lakes and the Great Lakes in the west; and Lake Champlain, Lake George, and Oneida Lake in the northeast; and rivers such as the Delaware, Genesee, Mohawk, and Susquehanna. (A popular joke goes, "Where does Upstate begin?" "At the sign that says, 'Welcome to Yonkers'!") Central New York is the region centered around Syracuse and Utica, regions west of Syracuse are Western New York (i.e. Rochester and Buffalo), Binghamton, Elmira and west along the Pennsylvania line is the "Southern Tier," and "The North Country" is the region between the Adirondacks and the Canadian border, from the Watertown area to Plattsburgh. Residents of neighboring states and provinces may use the term "New York State" to refer to Upstate New York, to distinguish the region from New York City.<br>  <br>  The largest city in the state and the most populous city in the United States is New York City, which comprises five counties, the Bronx, New York (Manhattan), Queens, Kings (Brooklyn), and Richmond (Staten Island). New York City is home to more than two-fifths of the state's population.|`|6C287vmdaa	California!!!! I've been and it was a great trip. The scenery was costantly changing.

New York to me seemed really fast paced, crowded and the people weren't too nice, but if you like fast paced city life then New York is for you.|`|oCiEDfMFaa	I was born and raised in New York.  I've been living in California for the last 6 years.  I love both states.  The answer would be to determain what you're looking for in life.  Growing in Brooklyn, New York and now living in CA the environments are totally different.  In CA people are more into the outdoor life like hiking, surfing, snowboarding, skiing.  Things like that.  New Yorkers are more into things like fashion, shopping, partying.  It just depends. I would say the cost of living is the same in both states.  Pretty expensive to live but doable if you have a decent job.  Either way I think you'll love both states.<br>  Hope that helps!|`|PmJdmMduaa	i've lived in both new york and california.<br>  honestly, city is city.<br>  there are many differences, of course. but i'd say california is a lot more chill and laid back. new york is all hustle bustle. california's weather is not too changing where as new york, the weather ranges from freezing to super hot. <br>  <br>  but of course, you can have fun wherever you go (:|`|kFMFGciFaa	I live in California and have been to NY, I have family there...

6Gfz125Paa	The cheapest way to get from LA to SF is the California Shuttle Bus (cashuttlebus.com)<br>  <br>  Once you are in SF, you can explore on your own, just get a good map and find your way around.  SF is a very small city, completely navigable on foot or by Muni bus and trolley.  There should be tours also, just google it.  But in my opinion the tours are overpriced and you could see the same things on your own at your own pace.

DxOlRuB8aa	i know how you feel too i live in new york and really wanted them to come<br>  but i dont think theres any chance.

I mean I kinda know why because they can't speak English well. But is okay we understand, last year when they went over the Cali for dream concert. I agree with what .:brav3 h3art Fighting!:. said some people are rude to them because Americans take things very seriously.

50ba9dbb26b71c7ae00921a624a4d0b5aa	If you are playing a slot machine or table game, a cocktail waitress will bring you a drink for free..It's a good idea to tip $1 per round if you expect to see her back anytime soon.<br>  <br>  Some sportsbooks serve free drinks, but many have gone to a "coupon" system...Such as, place a $20 bet and they give you two coupons for free drinks...<br>  <br>  Or course you can always bypass the cocktail waitress and sit right at the bar. Yep, the drinks are free as long as you are playing...<br>  <br>  Our fav sportsbook is the Las Vegas Hilton, the drinks are still free. Plus you can watch your game in the greatest sportsbook in the world, and play good video poker at the same time if you like. They have 9/6 JOB for as little as a nickel(27 - .05c machines) & even more at the quarter & above level...There is a bar right in the sportsbook, this speeds service greatly. <br>  <br>  Some casinos are much better than others when it comes to free drinks....."Generally" speaking, the cocktail service is better and quicker at the locals or downtown(Fremont St) casinos<br>  <br>  Quicker service:<br>  Location, location, location, if you can find your favorite machine(s) near a bar where the cocktail waitresses are picking up drinks. It is to your advantage to have 1/2 dozen walking past you every minute rather than sitting in the far corner of the casino where you might see one every 15 or 20 minutes. <br>  <br>  ~Jack~|`|ee84f878d59734da208adb9eb82587a9aa	Drinks are free for gamblers because a) the vast majority of them lose far more money gambling than the drinks would have cost anyway and b) intoxicated gamblers lose more money than sober gamblers and c) if you have to go to the bar to get a drink you spend less time gambling than when they bring the drink to you.<br>  <br>  Professional gamblers all say you should never gamble while intoxicated. Even if you don't get drunk, you can easily lose $20 to $40 on a 25 cent slot machine just waiting for one "free drink."|`|AA10240904	When you are gambling, table or slots, you will be offered a beverage.  You don't have to have a few to make gambling easier, in fact, you will definitely lose|`|uiX853hPaa	Just remember to tip the waitresses. They have bills to pay and mouths to feed, too.|`|oReGA5kEaa	While you are gambling, you get free drinks otherwise you have to pay. There seems to be some sort of system to it. When I'm winning at the craps table, they seem to come by every 5 min. If I'm playing slots, they take for ever. Larger tips help get the drinks faster too. I found sitting at the Keno area is a cheap way to get drinks. Just get $4 ticket every once in a while and the drinks keep flowing.|`|FWWj3mvLaa	you still must tip the servers or they get really crabby and don't come around , go to most bars insert a twenty in the draw poker and drinks are free as long as you play, You must tip  them also, usually a buck a drink if you want good service. go to a sit down bar with wait staff and expect to pay out the nose. same in the resturants..you pay.....|`|e7478813ada64290f8f2aac212f84685aa	When you are at the slots or tables waitresses come round and get you drinks for free with a tip ($1 usually) but it can take a while. However if you are playing video poker at the bar you get free drinks if you start with $10 and keep putting $1 in every few minutes again a minimum $1 tip is expected|`|yvPA8FSsaa	True.  The cocktail waitresses get the drinks for you.  I suggest you tip at least a buck when she does or you will probably not see her again.  If you play video poker, you can sit at the casino bars that have them built right into the bar.  The bartender will keep them coming as long as you keep on tipping.<br>  <br>  Before you bother asking, we are talking your standard beer and liquor.  No point in ordering very expensive beverages.  But you can get brand name rye, scotch, canadian etc.  or bottles of beer.  <br>  <br>  You can also get soft drinks, water or coffee.<br>  <br>  *|`|KGgPtU8zaa	from my experience, if you plays slots it is easy to get free drinks during the day but harder at night when they are busy. It seems like they pay a lot more attention to the blackjack tables and higher stakes slots/tables etc. than if you are playing little slots. Just so you know|`|WGamjAwQaa	its not "open bar".  waitresses walk around and take your order and bring you free drinks.  it takes forever so that you sit there and gamble while you wait for them.|`|HYoUVfBYaa	if you walk in and play a penny slot they will gladly hand you whatever drink you want all day.

But remember you still should tip the waitresses.|`|0RCGy3OOaa	pretty valid|`|pTLcvsVfaa	The waitresses will come around and serve you, ONLY if you are gambling. Blackjack, poker, craps, slot, any kind of gambling. But you cant just go up to the bar and get free drinks. You also really should tip the waitress around a buck a drink also. So its not entirely free because you are still tipping. A good tipper not only gets faster drink service, but stronger drinks. I always tip the waitresses like 3$ or so my first drink and she comes around all the time with strong drinks. After that its ussualy a buck a drink i tip.<br>  <br>  One other thing is that if you play video poker at the bars, you also get free drinks. Put a 10$ bill in the machine and play 25Cent poker slowly and you can drink for free for hours.<br>  <br>  At most sportsbooks, they give you free drink tickets when you make your wager. You can ussualy use these at the bars around the casino.<br>  <br>  I have heard rumors, of Drink "passes" that are given out to high rollers. Basically it allows them to drink free at any hotel bar, and also eat free in some places,but this would only apply to certain people who gamble alot.|`|Lngb8ryFaa	"open bar?""" ha ha , very funny...you REALLY have to be gambling to get noticed by a waitress..dont expect to play $20 at the slots and see a waitress bringing you free drinks...btw, tip MORE than $1 if you do get them..a beer costs $7 at the casino bars so if you tip $1 its the equivalent of a 50 cent tip anywhere else..

I drove past some local schools earlier, teachers, caretakers etc were clearing the paths and laying plenty of sand for tonight and tomorrow. (the reason behind schools closing today is the shortage of grit, so a day should allow them time)     However we have been given a severe weather warning for thursday and friday for heavy snow.

hGojk9UGaa	It would be Winter in Hawaii in November but it still makes an amazing holiday destination. The temperatures are still 24 degrees celsius or 76 degrees fahrenheit so still lovely weather and you'd be able to sunbathe. The weather doesn't very that much between Summer and Winter in Hawaii. It's a bit wetter in the Winter and stay close to the shore rather than going into the mmountains if it's warmer weather you're after.  The waves are huge and it's when lots of the pro surfers head to Hawaii, infact in late November they have the Triple Crown of Surfing championships on Oahu.  Winter is when the whales visit - amazing whale watching opportunities  If you go - you'll have an amazing time!|`|Xoooc2K1aa	The weather in November is hit and miss.  November is prime "winter" for us (as winter goes from October to March) which normally means higher winds and more chances of rain.  However, that doesn't mean that you won't have long periods of sunny days mixed in either.    The water temperature in November should hover around 80 - 85 but getting out in the wind can be the cold part.     If that's the only time you can come, then I would suggest you take your chances and come on over......    Good luck and happy travels!|`|mzn6JQ8Iaa	rain, still warmbah|`|GMWJgn2Iaa	Weather at all times of year is fantastic.  I used to live there and November was fine (went for Thanksgiving in 2007 as well).  Only potential issue is rain.  November/December can get rainy and windy at times, but that can happen at other times as well.  Kauai or Hilo side of Big Island may be wet.    Avg high is probably 80 and low of 70 at that time of year.  I just got back from New Year's there for 2 weeks it was high of 80-84 and low of 70-72.  It rained 3 times in 16 days, but rained hard only once during day.    Water temp on Oahu is always in the 76-79 range, so you can swim year round.|`|PfvDMYY0aa	yes it would be worth your time and money because hawaii is awesome like that! and yes, it is warm enough for you to go out and get a tan and to swim. make sure you wear your sunscreen!

At holiday time they have a big "Santa's Workshop", but so do a lot of other stores.<br>  <br>  I think what makes Macy's Herald Square unique is the sheer size of the store - 9 floors, and it takes up a whole New York city block.  There are some old wooden escalators that still work, left over from the early 1900's, but really, it's just a big department store.|`|JGtwyi9Kaa	Not really, it's just a REALLY big Macys.|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	It's big, busy and bustling.

If you can get there during Flower Show time, which will be coming up in the spring, that's amazing.  <br>  Yes, in the end, it's just a store--but it's also kind of an event as well.|`|MFcbRot8aa	Go to Macy's around Easter to see their massive flower display.

eAMbWkahaa	One thing to understand is that Tokyo has more then just subway trains.  Many cities in the world have only one subway or train system, Tokyo has over 12 different railway companies and each company has many many different train lines.   More information on tokyo trains: <a href="http://www.tokyosubway.info" rel="nofollow">http://www.tokyosubway.info</a><br>  <br>  Many people ride subways and many people ride surface trains, trains go everywhere in Tokyo (and in Japan).<br>  <br>  Riding trains is an interesting experience especially if you ride during the peak rush hours in the morning and evening where trains are JAMMED PACKED.  They can be jammed packed but very quiet as well.  No one talking or blasting away on cellphones (people message more then they talk).|`|Q3RqWHFsaa	It's easy, cheap, quick and convenient but too crowd to take in rush hours.<br>  <br>  Molesters, perverts, psychos, pickpockets, boozers, pukes are quite often seen.

i7oHTo9haa	Hi. Ben Gurion considered everything just like any other World leader.  They consider the impact it will have on their populace and in relation to the rest of the world.  That's what makes leaders World leaders. He never wanted to go to war.  He just wanted Israel to finally get recognized as a modern nation even though Israel has always been an ancient nation.  He wanted to make peace with the Arabs.<br>  <br>  The thing about the British involvement and the international involvement is this.  At that time (and still many today) things were viewed thru Western eyes.  That is great to be civilized West we know how to conduct business with each other. But those skills don't come in so handy in fact it can lead to one's demise when dealing with the East. Israel is a Western nation where East meets West and Israel is most equipped to understand how to continue its survival. The only way to effectively deal with these people is Reagan and Roosevelt doctrine peace thru strength.<br>  <br>  Britain fought hard for Israel and still supports her. Britain explained already to the other internationalists "it is not international territory therefore not internationalist place to divvy up the land" prior to the divisive Israel UN land vote.  Britain already arranged for the Arabs all to have their home states, with their corresponding capitols... Damascus, Syria -- Beirut, Lebanon -- Amman, Jordan -- Jerusalem, Israel.<br>  <br>  I would not blame Israel's existence or UN votes (although the votes complicate matters to give people points to argue about) or any other matters on disputes with the Arabs.  The simple fact of the matter is in topics unrelated to Israel they fight ferociously amongst themselves.  Syria invented the PLO to do land grab for Israel, Jordan and Lebanon to restore its ancient Greater Syrian Empire similar to what Saddam did with Kuwait and Mesopotamia. Hamas did a bloody takeover of Gaza from Fatah and seized all assets and now rules the people by violent force. Hezbollah, who replaced the failed PLO in Lebanon,  did a bloody battle in Southern Lebanon to wage war against both Israel and the government within Lebanon.  It is just the same technique and mindset used over and over again.<br>  <br>  The PLO went into Jordan and used a Jordanian soldier's head as soccer practice,operated as a state within a state, and tried to assassinate King Hussein and Jordan kicked them out.  Then they made their way into Lebanon and Arafat made his "road to Palestine leads thru Jonieh."  Why does Jordan and Lebanon get a "bye" on the extremists that they dealt with when Israel is supposed to "take it" from them?<br>  <br>  Arabs have extremism issues and the West just needs to learn how to not appease them but deal with them in an effective manner of East meets West, peace thru strength.

8a6264c2a88bd183d83082d179b6e268aa	It depends on where you are and are your interests.  Our city has a city within a city called Bricktown.  That is where many restaurants, bars, grills, and major attractions like pro-sports, and indoor sports are held as well as concerts both inside and out.  The new stadiums are located there and so are the boats that travel up and down the canal.  It's a lot of fun to go there.  Those are just a few of the fun things in that area.    Me?  I'm a movie girl.  We even have 50 cent night in one mall where you can catch the movie before it goes to DVD.  I also love the lake.  I take my own snacks usually from my own frig or from the Dollar Tree.    I am never bored.  Let me know where you are and I will check it out for you.

AA11341587	Maybe not fair, but guess what?  Life isn't always fair.  Get use to it, I have taken many, many similar confusing multiple choice tests throughoutmy lifetime, so it is good practise.    And it's actually even a more clever question than you think - clever in your favour.  Because if you know the answer to I and II - two extremely easy questions.  I'm not in your class and I know the answers.  Anyway, knowing those two answer you don't need to know the answer to III to get the right answer.    Multiple choice is still easier than other forms.  Yes, in a math multiple choice you are expected to know how to do the problem.  The good thing about multiple choice is it lets you know if you are in the right ball park instead of completely off.  It might give common mistakes, but if you make a mathematical error, you will end up with something that isn't a choice and go back and retry.|`|azypqsphaa	yup|`|xFm5wzuXaa	Happy I am American, that made my brain hurt, who wold write such a confusing question?  Looks like IRS form.  blehgh what a nightmare! simplify!|`|2wyDALHgaa	I don't think it's fair at all but only because you are matching apples and oranges in the answer.  It should be all geography, all math or all what ever other topic.      Other then that, as long as all things are equal I don't care if you need to know the whole answer or if it's possible to make a round off error.  Either you know the answer to the question or you don't.  Either you know how to round off or you don't.      Thats the big problem with our system these days.  There are too many exceptions and chances for part marks that it lowers the standard.  I'm currently back to University after years away from school and I can't believe how the standards are lowered now compared to when I was in school before.  It used to be that you needed to pass with 60% but now it's only 50% and if you don't quite pass but you whine enough to the Prof he/she will modify your mark so that you can pass.|`|uqKpjV6qaa	Yeah well I think its confusing but we do get questions like that on Finals and PATs|`|aiYDXNKuaa	Seems tough to lump three question togethr in a multiple choice, it's all or nothing.    Just for fun, off the top of my head:  The answer is B (QC is north-east of Montreal), DogRiver is a fictional town, and question 3 is a trick question (negative numbers do not have square roots)|`|WeKrtWDiaa	not fair at all it is not proper multiple choice at all
ndxXPie9aa	Austin by far. More personable. In Houston you're just another face. Houston is far too spread out and traffic is a nightmare. Austin's traffic is rough at rush hour but not so bad at other times. Town Lake is great in the summer and UT is there. I have lived in both cities and I would move back to Austin. NEVER again to Houston. Good Luck.|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	Houston=mandatory air-con in the Summer.|`|jAqVoGlmaa	houston... austin is more of the tech city and has all the weirdos..lol.. houston has a medical center and system ..www.hhc.org..that is tops in the nation..  austin is also kind of crowded and seems like a rat race everytime i go thru there...    email for any other details|`|KktkViZ4aa	houston -------very busy-------more fun places too|`|737380b1eda64fb221e8ceccffa68353aa	Houston is the best choice for a nurse because it's the leading city in medicine in the United States. Austin really doesn't have a variety of job choices while Houston has a bunch of hospitals in and around the massive medical center, and even if you move to the suburbs outside of Houston there are award-winning hospitals around town.     Basically Austin sucks and is boring and Houston is bustling and fun. It's pretty obvious which one would be better :]
0HO8sTGeaa	it's already 20 years.. just go and enjoyed yourself. my guess is they sure gonna forget all the past. ppl change in that time, so do your boss(ex).......     go and greet him/her first, apologize for what had happen between the two of you... in that way i'm sure him/her will appreciate it. have a faith in yourself...    goodluck and enjoy... =8~]|`|FYgDmTMtaa	YES. For all you care, your old boss could be dead already, if he is still alive though, who cares?|`|5qSvdpELaa	20 years is a loooong time to remember a fight. If he's not dead (quote Daun Ketum), he's probably senile and forgetful (obviously you are NOT! lol!).     Go! Have fun reminiscing that fight. Laugh about it. Or have another fight just to keep you reminiscing for another 20 years!    Else, just enjoy the free food!|`|5QQbJ9Cdaa	If the company itself invited you, then why not?  Have fun and it will be a good opprtunity to make amends.|`|AdIrjmV7aa	Absolutely not. You should be in touch with your "old colleagues" already if you or they care.  Everyone else has forgotten you or are too busy kissing the bosses a** to have anything to do with you.|`|YYAu9lFDaa	is your boss still working there? if it was 20 years ago, i'd go, i'm sure he forgot about it and everyone will be happy to see you.|`|03d0cbfac12fca636244e5710c5b9bceaa	sure go for it...20 years is a lot of water under the bridge..|`|oIY7UlmZaa	you have a life and it's not a party that you want to go to. If you want to shoot the sh*t with old colleagues then you invite them out to drinks.

yKIr3C40aa	There are no free codes, and you need to provide a Japanese address to download from the Japanese iTunes store.
Qt4dnHQlaa	Both very different but both excellent places to go. If you're specifically looking for good shopping then Paris. <br>  Paris has landmarks and famous buildings that may interest you, for instance The Louvre museum (amazing building) and the Eiffel Tower, (if that kind of stuff interests you)<br>  Los Angeles is completely different! You can take a tour around celebrity houses, go shopping down Rodao Drive.. it's impossible to get bored! Very hot whether. <br>  <br>  Hope i've helped a bit with deciding, have a good holiday wherever you may go!|`|df1beb28ec457339664195de5a03682caa	L.A every time.The weather is better,the cost of living is cheaper,the people are nicer and they speak english!|`|6bryNB1raa	is you want shopping then its LA everytime|`|B08V01eRaa	paris in a word specially if youve never been|`|ECB8u72Taa	Neither, if you want shopping and fun go to New York. <br>  <br>  Paris is nice if you like great scenery, but the weather sucks here right now.  Also, you should really speak some French if you come to Paris.<br>  <br>  Los Angeles isn't very interesting for a short holiday.  You'll walk up and down sunset strip day after day like every other loser tourist.  The great shopping is in Beverly Hills on Rodeo Drive, but it is also really expensive.<br>  <br>  However, New York City is awesome any time of the year.  Go there.  You'll thank me.|`|DXBzxXIAaa	paris|`|5BOV76bmaa	Go to paris. i went & i went up the Eiffel tower. its scary you should try it|`|AA12106815	Paris..and also with possibly more nicer ppl there then here.
AA11596497	Not sure what cheap is for you, but try looking into Ogden Dunes or Miller Beach in Indiana.  Ogden Dunes is actually in Portage, IN and Miller Beach in Gary, In.    A home on the beach is about $1 Million in Miller Beach and $2Million in Ogden Dunes.  Obviously chearer as you move away from the lake.|`|158e8f51e731e93ad7f2eb5b83dc2c28aa	There are no cheap lake houses anywhere near here.    If you're going to buy real estate, you really need to know more about the area before you do it.
km9cQNAXaa	You know what to do. Don't buy it.<br>  <br>  Ian M|`|AA11496012	The airlines have their reasons for doing this.  Here in the US, we have an airline that has always charged an extremely high ticket price.  For example to fly across the country non-stop if we go through our local airport, the ticket price would have been USD $800.  But if you were willing to drive 2 hours to another city, the ticket price would be USD $400 but you would have to make a connection.  The connecting airport was our local airport.  The airline says that convenience costs money.  We prefer to save money and drive to another airport.<br>  <br>  I am guessing in your situation, there may be more competition at one airport so the ticket prices are lower at Dublin as opposed to Belfast City.  I am thinking it is cheaper out of Dublin because Aer Lingus has to compete with RyanAir so neither airline is willing to charge too high of an airfare but out of Belfast City, only 1 airline flies to London so they feel that they can charge more.

If you have not looked at something in the last six months, dump it.    Travel light. You can always replenish at yard sales. Think of this.

qJkKP2c3aa	Its 12.46Dh to the  by the Yahoo calculator this morning. March 2006 it was 17Dh to the .  I expect it will rise a little more this week as there wont be so many tourists going out on the low cost flights. by mid feb we may be lucky to get 13+  but then its so inexpensive to live/travel in Morocco anyway.

In the tourist sector, facing the beach on Ave Tawada, you can get three course meal for 45Dh, that includes soup, tajine and dessert.|`|NaT5dYU1aa	The economic downturn is starting to hit Morocco now, so the dirham may go down.  Right now, you will get about 11.1124 MAD.  I usually guestimate when I am there by removing one 0; i.e. if it is 100 MAD, then 10 Euro.  It is then easy to quickly calculate in my head if it's a good deal since you have to bargain at the souks.|`|7EQkBd8Laa	We went to Agadir last summer for two weeks staying in one of the riu's. Its not as cheap as u would expect, stick to the uniprix shop, and dont buy any leather good, many are treated with camel urine believe it or not. I didn't realise this and bought a leather bag only not to be able to use it cause it stinks!

Nothing special happened though the band on the Lido deck played several songs like Born in the USA, and anything else that had the words USA or America in it.  As the ship isn't reigstered in the US, and the stops weren't countries that celebrate our Independence day, it was kinda glossed over.<br>  <br>  Easter I can't imagine would be a big deal at all since it's Sunday which is usually loading day so it would be just like any other embarkation day--ship doesn't set sail til late, casual dinner, etc.  Nothing special.

There were generally not many kids on that ship, but they made a special effort for the kids that day -- the theater staff helped all the kids get costumed with theater makeup and costumes (really wild fun costumes!), and then took the kids all over the ship to show off, and trick-or-treating to the kitchens, the spa, the purser's office, etc., and even to the bridge, and then had a special Halloween party.

There are only 2 suites like that and 903 is partially blocked.<br>  <br>  We liked the Majesty but found the entertainment to be lacking.  The shows would be re-shown every night with nothing new and it grew old real quick.  However, they also have a casino, video game room, computer/internet room, library, many nice lounges and bars and one really good restaurant, Le Bistro.  We weren't too fond of the main dining rooms as the wait staff would sit you at a table and wait until the table was full (sometimes 20 minutes or longer) before they would wait on you.<br>  <br>  The rooms were clean and neat as was the entire ship.  The buffets outside seemed to clear out quickly and the staff wasn't always real quick to refill them.<br>  <br>  When you order your drinks be sure to have your room card with you.

Jm3vMKx3aa	For Austria you will need a toll sticker to be bought before entering Austrian highways.  Additionally you will have to pay tolls in cash or by a via-card for certain highways crossing the alps.    In Italy you will get a toll voucher on entry of a highway and pay as you leave either in cash or by card. Some exits are not manned and you have to pay by via-card to get off the highway.     Via cards of a value of 25.25 or 50.50 can be bought in advance.|`|gVITlOMUaa	yes. They let you pay in euros.From Innsbruk to bolzano italy we did this... beautiful drive!|`|kgBPU4xxaa	You want to read this: http://www.german-way.com/autobahn2.html BEFORE you drive on the autobahn in Austria. You can drive on the regular roads without a sticker, but the fine is very high for being on the autobahn without a valid sticker if you get stopped.    Here in Italy, there are cash lanes at the toll booths on the autostrada when you exit. Just make sure you're not in a credit card or electronic pass lane.
h0rt6YJ4aa	*  The maximum size carry-on bag for most airlines is 45 linear inches (the total of the height, width, and depth of the bag). Anything larger should be checked.      * No oversize packages or luggage can be stowed onboard.
PA0bGBtCaa	We in the airline world call them Rice bags. I know exactly what you are talking about, and they are not really recommended for traveling on an airplane. Though they are sturdy and won't tear by putting a lot of stuff in them, they will rip easily if they get caught on anything on the bag belt system.    I see dozens of these bags every week, usually Asian customers, and they almost always have some sort of damage to them when they arrive. You can try wrapping them really good with sturdy rope on the outside. That will help protect the bag from getting really ripped.    Finally, since those bags are not standard suitcases, the airline will not assume any responsibility for any damage that occurs to the contents if something does happen.

If you are an American citizen, there is now a passport card available that can be used for LAND travel to and from Mexico and Canada, cannot be used to fly.   See site below.

From there, it's just a short bus ride to North Cape.<br>  <a href="http://momondo.com" rel="nofollow">http://momondo.com</a><br>  <br>  Use the flight calendar to compare dates to find the cheapest prices. 19 June - 25 June is €230.<br>  <br>  There are no trains that run that far north, and a bus would take ages. The only other option is the Hurtigruten (boat), which is usually quite expensive.<br>  <br>  For €135 you could go to Troms? instead (more things to do, it has a great nightlife for its size) or somewhere on Lofoten. It's €280 to Leknes, for example.<br>  <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Tromso" rel="nofollow">http://wikitravel.org/en/Tromso</a>
