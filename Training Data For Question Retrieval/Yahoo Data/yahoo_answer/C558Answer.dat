9BJc8Vo6aa	mypyramid.gov is free and gives you a good idea of what to do to your nutrition in order to loose weight tailored to your exercise time and gender/height etc. <br>  <br>  Drink a lot of water, there's about 5-10lbs of water weight there, possibly.<br>  <br>  Strength training will be good because muscles burn exponentially, a great deal more, than fat does. So you will loose fat faster by being fitter and more lean. <br>  <br>  Cardio is good, everyday, but every other day about 3 days a week you need to find the right training program for muscle-building.<br>  <br>  I'm currently taking weightlifting at my college, and it's helped me loose those extra 30llbs (from 170 to 140 I hope. I'm around 150 now.... within two months).|`|6MKZmyKYaa	A good thing to do to jumpstart your metabolism & melt of the pounds is to exercise 10-25 minutes each morning before you eat breakfast.

Its all about portion control and exercise as well as eating right. I dont like vege's only maybe 2.. i love fruits but only eat fruits in the morning.. here is my diet.<br>  Morning- 80 cal. yogart- it looks like a popsycle strip.. you can take it on the go. & diet Green Tea.<br>  Morning snack.. 100 calorie pack snack are the best! they make everything in 100 calories. also this is your time of day to eat fruits... & water.<br>  Lunch- I love the lean cuisine meals. try them. i hate microwavable foods but these are actually good. and good for you. w/ diet green tea. or tea with splenda. Splenda is 0 cal. <br>  Mid Snack- another 100 calorie pack.. or a yogart again.. maybe a different one. i wouldnt go over 100 calories for my snacks.<br>  w/water<br>  Dinner- chicken!!!.. corn tortillas and chicken with alvacado is good!.. Spices are good for digesting too.. add spices to your dull foods.. Chicken Salads.. i eat anything chicken.. with spice.. or sometimes just a sandwhich.. with turkey and ham, light low fat mayo. no cheese. w/ tea or green tea<br>  <br>  i go work out at 7pm only because i dont have time in the morning. i jogg 3 miles and do 75 sit ups on my ab lounger. Ab lounger at target $14.00.. helps you pull up. its great.<br>  <br>  I work out 5 days a week, and give myself what i want on sunday, dont over do it, because once you strech out your stomach your back to your old routine. If your craving chinese food, or whatever.. give it to yourself, but only a little... if not the craving will get worse and youll end up bingeing! Like I said ive lost almost 20 pds in 3 weeks.

0Ff3C5gtaa	I can't really tell you why....but if I understand right, you have only exercised fro 2 days for about an hour each day? Maybe that is too much since you first started.  I am thinking your thighs are becoming 'chapped' are they rubbing against each other?...try a little  powder before exercise.  <br>  Don't stop exercising....just slow a bit....and see how that affects you.|`|7bfcaf169fc585bf8a1b332b65615e52aa	I am trying to understand the way you are writing. Texting is hard when you are in this format. Next to approach your question...starting out by "exercising an hour or more" in a span of only 2 days is very dangerous. So to get any more detail requires a professional in medicine and I do not have those credentials. And using this forum for that degree of information is not what you should be doing because you really do not know what people do or do not know. I would first step back from the duration of exercise and build up to a level of fitness. Second, if the condition continues, I would speak to a doctor and/or dermatologist. I hope this helps you somewhat.

gTQLPUMxaa	Brown is best. In humans, brown eyes contain large amounts of melanin within the iris which serves to absorb light, particularly at the shorter wavelengths. Very dark brown irises may appear to be black. Brown is very predominant and, in many populations, it is the only iris color present. It is least common in the countries around the Baltic Sea. Those with both European and non-European ancestry generally have dark eyes and more variability in eye color within their families. Inhabitants of Africa, Asia, and the Americas have brown eyes. Brown eyes are equally found in Europe, Oceania, and North America, though within some European populations they are not predominant to the same extent.

For those who wear them all the time, many have dropped over 10 inches from their waist.<br>  <br>  As for damage to your body, if you are not hurting, you are not doing damage.  <br>  <br>  do some research, look up the following names and read about them:<br>  Cathie Jung:   <br>  <a href="http://www.cathiejung.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cathiejung.com/</a><br>  <br>  Annalai:<br>  <a href="http://www.staylace.com/albertcst/index6.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.staylace.com/albertcst/index6...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.staylace.com/albertcst/index7.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.staylace.com/albertcst/index7...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.staylace.com/albertcst/index8.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.staylace.com/albertcst/index8...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.staylace.com/albertcst/index9.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.staylace.com/albertcst/index9...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.staylace.com/albertcst/index10.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.staylace.com/albertcst/index1...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.staylace.com/albertcst/index11.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.staylace.com/albertcst/index1...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.staylace.com/albertcst/index12.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.staylace.com/albertcst/index1...</a><br>  <br>  Sylphide:<br>  <a href="http://www.sylphide.de/estart.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sylphide.de/estart.htm</a><br>  <br>  Spook:<br>  <a href="http://www.staylace.com/pinups/spook/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.staylace.com/pinups/spook/ind...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.staylace.com/pinups/spook/pu_spook_5.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.staylace.com/pinups/spook/pu_...</a><br>  <br>  I hope these help you.

FYi5p9VQaa	HPV or Genital Warts, Genital Herpes, Pubic Lice ("crabs"), and Syphilis are contagious even if condoms are worn...<br>  <br>  IF you come in contact with the surface of infected skin on your partner.  If your partner, for example, has herpes but does not have an outbreak, the chance of you getting herpes while having protected sex are much less likely than if they had open lesions around their genitals.  However, the likelihood of someone with active herpes/open lesions having sex is not high given the fact that (a) herpes is often excruciatingly painful, and (b) who is going to look at someone's open herpes sores and still want to have sex?|`|fAFXkikAaa	The three that I know of are HPV, herpes and crabs.<br>  <br>  Of course, if the condom breaks, all bets are off.|`|CpevWaQ7aa	You can get HPV, Hepres and craps.

Condoms do help the risk of catching a STD less, but there is nothing that is 100%. So be careful and get checked!!|`|tI1NHwfBaa	There are about 30 varieties of sexually transmitted diseases.<br>  <br>  You can catch EVERY ONE of them, even when using a condom.<br>  <br>  Condoms reduce risk.  They do not eliminate risk.  There is no such thing as "Safe Sex" (and condom manufacturers have stopped using this term after losing several lawsuits over it.)<br>  <br>  Some sexually transmitted diseases like Gonorrhea and Chlamydia are transferred by the exchange of body fluids.  A leak in a condom can allow the agents to be exchanged.<br>  <br>  Some sexually transmitted diseases like Herpes and HPV are transmitted through a process called shedding, which occurs with skin to skin contact and friction.  Condoms do not fully cover every area where this can occur.<br>  <br>  Some sexually transmitted diseases like Syphillis are transmitted through direct contact.  The bacteria may be in a place where the condom doesn't cover, or they may be in a place where they can be transmitted by body fluids around the area protected by a condom.<br>  <br>  According to various studies recognized by the CDC, condoms can reduce the risk of disease transmission by as little as 50% (in the case of Gonorrhea) to as much as about 85% (in the case of the HIV virus.)|`|17103f1748af3e37b30568fa758fd4d3aa	You can still get herpes and crabs

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|ZLt8TwOiaa	No not without surgery|`|ep3dqXrpaa	I empathize with you.  Eating healthy is one thing.  Eating low calorie, low glycemic and low carb healthy is quite another.  Exercise will burn excess calories.  I ama rebounder fan.

I know sport is obviously important to you but for the sake of a few months of recuperation do you really want to harm a lifetime of enjoying sports?<br>  <br>  This injury needs rest if it is to heal properly. Only do as much exercise as it will allow without causing pain. Weight bearing exercise will make it worse. Keep your sessions few and high quality rather than train every day. <br>  Apply ice or cold therapy to the knee regularly throughout the day to reduce pain and inflammation and particularly following activity or sport. Ice should be applied at least three times a day for 10 to 15 minutes. Ice massage with an ice cube or a paper / polystyrene cup with water frozen in is a convenient way to apply cold therapy to a specific area such as the patella tendon. <br>  Use a knee support or brace to help reduce the tension on the knee.

ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight<br>  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in<br>  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are<br>  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have<br>  to work double on them. The best approach is this:<br>  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal<br>  weight, lower for overweight).<br>  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.<br>  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.<br>  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a<br>  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,<br>  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure<br>  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you<br>  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your<br>  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and<br>  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add<br>  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,<br>  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six<br>  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these<br>  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT<br>  ALL.

0ff94ba9320182f79127dc5f55cbcaefaa	The answers you've been getting all seem rather incoherent, so I'll try to be a bit clearer.<br>  <br>  Oxycodone is a type of opioid analgesic that comes in various formulations. Some are slow release (also extended or controlled release) and some are instant release. Most Oxycodone is instant release.<br>  <br>  Slow release tend to be better for chronic pain, because they give a more even level of pain relief through the course of the day. The trick is working out when to take them and what dose you need to give you (as an individual) the most effective relief.<br>  <br>  It does sound as though your drugs are very similar. Oxycontin is a controlled release form of oxycodone, as is Oxycodone ER. The only difference is the dose size, and when you are taking it.<br>  <br>  If you could clarify - you were taking 20mg in a single dose, and you are still taking 20mg, but split into two 10mg doses? If that's the case, it may be that your body needs the 20mg tablet to reach a level of pain relief that is effective for you, and that that is why the Oxycontin seems to work better - quite simply, your body is getting more of the drug.<br>  <br>  You shouldn't be afraid to talk to your doctor, and ask for what you need to control your pain.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps.|`|LsHkgexvaa	They are the same medication, but...Oxycontin is a slow release version of Oxycodone. I take Oxycodone 10/325 4 times a day but I have a friend that takes 1- 20/325 Oxycontin once a day. If you were to chew or break Oxycontin you would get a full days dose all at once. Many people overdose or get totally stoned doing this. With Oxycontin your getting twice the dose as the 10/325mg. That's why it is more effective.|`|2foBiJH4aa	THey are basically made out of the same source well speaking over the bulk of the pill it self is the same chemicals but one is slightly different than the other  compound or should I say in exact terms pill the word itself is a mindbreaker becausse of the differnt scintifc wrold of the drugs or narcotics whatever or howevr you wanna put it ewe need pills to make it sometimes you need more than pills to help with your problem or conditon but what Im trying to substitute one for the other is not a good idea since they both have the same common chomical substance that enables the drug  to wrok to it;s full affect or climax spot. Have any more questions feel free to sk me I am a college student so yeah I"m samrt baby lol!!!!!!!!!|`|bssOhC9jaa	Wow, people are dumb. There is no oxycotin that is 20/325. Oxcontin is oxycodone without tylenol and is also time released. Percocet is oxycodone with tylenol which is not time released. The 325 in the drug is the tylenol.|`|PU5Qq1bIaa	Oxycotin is a long acting drug that slowly disolves into your system.<br>  Oxycodone is a short acting drug and goes immediatly to your system at full strength.<br>  <br>  Oxycontin will work better for most because it lasts much longer and is stronger.
grjDkG00aa	It depends what kind of eyedrops he has. That's a really very expensive kind of eyedrop! One thing is for sure, you'll get a cheaper prescription if a generic equivalent is available and if it is legally interchangeable. Another thing is, a prescription in US is not recognized here in Canada and it won't be filled in Canada unless a Canadian doctor had written the prescription.<br>  There are lots of online pharmacies that you can find thru the internet and somehow, most of them are not licensed to operate. You have to be really wary about those. If you find a legitimate one, make sure that they are certified thru the College of Pharmacy.<br>  You can check-out onlinepharmacy.com (I am not recommending it but it is worth looking into)<br>  Hope you are satisfied with this answer :=)

UtRjy7Isaa	Dairy is any milk product.<br>  <br>  Eggs are defined as a meat product.<br>  <br>  * Eggs can come from any bird and birds do not produce milk like mammals do.<br>  <br>  * Dairy can come from a lactating cow or goat and you will not find dairy unless it is from milk.<br>  <br>  To find a list of dairy replacements go to <a href="http://www.notmilk.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.notmilk.com</a> they have a list of choices.<br>  <br>  If you eat eggs, buy hormone and antibiotic free eggs.  They have good cholesterol for a healthy heart and brain.<br>  <br>  If you don't want dairy (which is any milk product from a lactating cow or goat) there is almond milk, rice milk, and soy milk.<br>  <br>  Cheese does not have to be a daily intake for the diet.  We as a culture, have become so dependent on the taste of cheese on every d@mned thing that we seem to be retarded on how to make a food choice without cheese. (That was a rant LOL)<br>  <br>  If one would learn how to prepare their own foods, you would be surprised how tasty foods can be and how much you won't miss the cheese.<br>  <br>  Why not have some pasta with red or white sauce with sea food and veggies or Italian sausage and a side salad instead of pizza?  - Make educated choices and you get better and tastier food for a lean body and healthy and balanced mind.<br>  <br>  Eating about 6 to 7 servings of whole raw fruits and vegetables a day will change your entire body and mind by creating a lean body with a great attitude and outlook on life.<br>  <br>  Junk food - Poor attitude and outlook on life.  Usually excess fat around the gut, buttocks and thighs and fatigued more than energetic and usually needs naps during the day.<br>  <br>  Whole food - Great attitude and outlook on life. Usually can keep up with daily routines and can create a future that is better than average with a body that is lean with very little excess fat with high energy levels throughout the day.|`|ZLt8TwOiaa	yes , eggs are dairy too, there are egg substitute products out there and there are also cheeses made with soy. on the eggs substitutes though some contain real egg. read the labels|`|ep3dqXrpaa	I think soy milk is a protein, not dairy.  dairy would be yogurt, milk, cheese, etc.  Go online and find out for sure.  maybe the government food guide...

IKakoOfyaa	It's a systemic rheumatic disease.<br>  The tendency to develop ankylosing spondylitis is believed to be genetically inherited, and the majority (nearly 90%) of patients with ankylosing spondylitis are born with the HLA-B27 gene.<br>  <br>  How inflammation occurs and persists in different organs and joints in ankylosing spondylitis is a subject of active research. Each individual tends to have their own unique pattern of presentation and activity of the illness.<br>  <br>  There is also a condition called spondylolisthesis (sounds a lot like ankylosing spondylitis) that has a heriditary component and causes pain and instability along the vertebral column.|`|5rJ6nf2oaa	This disease is often associated with a particular genetic make-up. Many people with ankylosing spondylitis have a genetic variation in a group of genes coding for part of the immune system, this type is HLA-B27. However there are other genetic variations that are linked to this disease. But just to make things confusing, many people with the genetic predisposition do not develop the disease therefore there must also be environmental or other causes. There's more info in the link.
dpgXzMenaa	One simple and cheap way to help with cramps (it's also the quickest, and the most convenient and natural) is having an orgasm by masturbating.

Whilst it is not always convenient to masturbate for the necessary five minutes until the pain subsides, hands free masturbation is still possible.

Kx9QgyjSaa	short answer: yes.<br>  <br>  On the one hand when my alcoholic mom didn't have clean laundry and breakfast for me when I was 12.  On the other hand I'm still working on being better at taking care of my self 38 years later.  Drinking and smoking I never have been interested in.

3meIiIsmaa	One of two things - you have vertigo (fluid in your inner ear) -to figure this out HOLD onto a chair or something --then bend over (like you're tying your shoe)-then stand up - do you feel dizzy and nauseous? or does the room seem to keep moving after you shake your head? That is prob vertigo - you need some decongestant to dry up fluid in your sinus and ear canal (if not better in 24 hours - see a Dr.) -the other thing is that your could have "positional hypotension" - which means  that your blood pressure drops when you stand up - Does this happen when you are laying down and get up quickly, too? It means that when you are sitting- you are cutting off circulation in your legs (do your feet swell?) -when you stand, the blood has farther to go to get back to your brain - so you get the blurry vision/light headed feeling - Sit on the edge of the chair or shake your legs to get better circulation before standing up - and hold onto something for the first few seconds - so you won't fall and hurt yourself. I suggest you change chairs or get a cushion that will help your leg circulation.  As long as you are aware of what could happen - you can prevent it.|`|wpjeOLaBaa	There is a variety of things it could be, from the minor such as a dizzy spell to the major such as a brain tumor , obviously I dont wish you to have any of these, but consult your doctor for help, good luck!|`|q4tTabfjaa	Inner ear probs maybe, call NHS direct and ask 0845 46 47, they will hopefully know what to ask and what the answers are.|`|ESKslyfsaa	Sounds like low blood pressure.|`|nPa5QFOeaa	could just be a case of head rush (standing up too quickly)<br>  <br>  or it could be vertigo. this is common in tall people. they offten get dizzy and faint when they stand up too fast or sudden. my dad has it but he also had low/high (cant mind what 1) blood sugar levels when this happend. <br>  <br>  check with a doctor just incase.|`|08Vk3RtJaa	there are a few things that could cause this, not eating enough or low blood pressure to name two.

Blood stops flowing to the brain for an instant, and the person may notice a fleeting loss of vision or a lightheaded feeling. This phenomenon is called postural hypotension. Most people will experience it at one time or another, but it becomes more frequent as we grow older. The therapy is to avoid sudden changes in posture. Unless postural hypotension suddenly becomes worse, you don't need to visit the doctor. You may report the feeling on your next routine visit.<br>  A persistent lightheaded feeling without any other symptoms doesn't indicate a brain tumor or other hidden disease. This type of lightheadedness often disappears when the person resolves anxiety. Not infrequently, it's a problem the person must learn to live with. If the problem persists for more than three weeks, call the doctor. And good luck.|`|AkPkrTf1aa	That happens to me a lot.  When I'm laying down then get up everything goes black and I get unbalanced and dizzy.  I fainted on Sunday after that happened but I was sick that day.  I told my health teacher and he said that it helps if you get up slower.  Like, if you are laying down or sitting back in a chair, first you should only move up a little bit and maybe blink a few times.  Then you slowly get up and hold on to something nearby for about 3 seconds.  Then walk slowly and after about 45 seconds it usually won't happen so you will be free to walk normally again.  But I honestly don't know what it is.
Q0ExafZzaa	Drinking fresh lemon juice regularly helps your body flush out toxins and also increases your immune system. I think Vitamin D has been shown to help the body retain calcium, not Vitamin C. And I never heard of having any effect on the heart. Don't believe everything you hear.|`|mKmrfeX7aa	Yes because it contains lots of vitaminC|`|UtRjy7Isaa	Any whole raw organic citrus is good for you.  <br>  <br>  Whole foods, you know? <br>  <br>  Like in the Bible it says eat the seed of the land for a reason.

Use it to squeeze over salad and add olive oil.<br>  <br>  In water, it helps to relieve stress off of your liver which has the biggest job of your body because its a metabolizing work station and it can get congested form processed foods and over salting and over sugaring and over synthetic everything.<br>  <br>  Eat whole foods!|`|xktBgoKFaa	No. Lemon juice is citric acid. It is no better than orange juice in providing Vitamin C It is far less effective than eating a kiwi fruit ir a green bell pepper. They each have more Vitmain C than lemon juice. All citric acid helps your body to absorb iron. That's why doctors recommend that you take any iron pills with a little glass of orange juice or lemon juice. Lemon juice on salads has been linked with curbing your taste for sweets. But balsamic vinegar is more effective. The one thing lemon juice does help with almost better than any other food is acne. Lemon juice kils the bacteria that cause acne.|`|ArKT9O7Maa	... This is probably one of the strangest things I have ever heard.  You would have to look up the vitamins and such in lemon juice to know if it helps you retain calcium, which isn't really necessary unless you have a condition that gives you a calcium deficiency.  Most American's have too much calcium because of all the supplements these days.  And all you do with extra calcium is piss it out.

There is something to make it lighter!  Try birth control!  It is amazing!!  Now, if you don't want to do that then what I suggest so you aren't having to go to the bathroom all the time is where a heavy tampon, like super plus or they just came out with ultra which is even bigger than super plus.  If you are wearing one of those absorbancy tampons and are still having to change frequently like that, something is wrong and you need to see your ob/gyn.  You could even try using two tampons, but be careful not to hurt yourself, I'd do this during cheerleading games so I wouldn't leak and didn't have to worry.  You take two tampons side by side and enter them SLOWLY AND GENTLY If you are on heavy flow they should go in just fine because the blood is like a lubricant.  If you feel they still aren't going in smoothly you can get some ky jelly and that'll work.  I'm a virgin, and I can do it, you can too! :)  If you don't use tampons...you should!  Lol, try them out they are so much better and not messy like wearing pads is.  Good luck|`|hMF3kg3Baa	Yes. I used to have them heavy and irregular.

Ask your doctor about birth control, it can help your period be shorter and better.|`|0TGpz08paa	No there's nothing that I know of that can make it lighter.

1aZ3QkAoaa	no|`|ioNKVW9haa	Do you have any other symptoms of pregnancy?  Have you gotten your period recently?  Have you been gaining weight at all?  What about fatigue and nausea?  <br>  <br>  I would suggest taking a pregnancy test.<br>  <br>  HOWEVER, just because you started lactating it does not mean you HAVE to be pregnant.  If you are not pregnant, then what you are experiencing is Galactorrhea.  It's the production of milk without having been recently pregnant.<br>  <br>  Galactorrhea can be caused by too much prolactin, which is the hormone that creates milk, or by something as simple as a low thyroid.<br>  <br>  It can ALSO be caused by stimulation of the breasts during sexual activity!  (Which is what happened here.  It's listed as a cause on the site I have as my second link)<br>  <br>  If your not pregnant, it's probably a hormone issue that's causing the Galactorrhea.  See a doctor... they can do blood tests to figure out what the problem is and fix it.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|wmdAbsA4aa	r u sure u had milk if yes u might be pregnant if no it might be milky discharge|`|5I4imquJaa	are you pregnant?|`|3dT7f39maa	Well, its never happened to me, cause I'm a bloke, but my eagle eyed missis who is looking over my shoulder says to tell you to buy a pregnancy test.

You might go to a dr to see if it's something else.|`|HLqzrBNmaa	You can develop allergies from overdosing. Allergies to oranges, peanuts etc. can all happen if you over eat them so an allergy to face wash can also occur. It could also be something else. Perhaps an allergy to something you are not aware of or maybe a skin condition unrelated to the face wash.|`|hmsMpECkaa	Histamine production in the skin or the hypothalamus which is located at the base of the brain might be the cause.  But there is another thing.  The same histamine that causes the immune response of itching also controls part of your sleep patterns; it wakes you up.  Are you sleepy all the time or over-awake?  There may be something wrong with your sleep pattern.

You need to remember when researching these facts that people sue frequently if their outcome is not perfect - this is a common problem with any surgery so you have to weigh the seriousness of the complaints you might find about your surgeon.  Most surgeons who do abdominal surgeries do not do orthopedic surgeries which is where your wrist surgery fits in.  I would be having an orthopedic surgeon do this operation for your highest possibility of success.
GT6396BDaa	The ganglion cysts an be removed.  If  it is bone spurs they can be removed as well.<br>  It sounds like you ganglion cycts, which are like fluid filled sacs on the nerves.  Surgery lasts about 30 minutes or so, depending on how big the cysts are, but they are not too complicated to remove. <br>  They can be detected by doing x-rays.  Recovery is usually anywhere frm 2-6 weeks.  You won't need physical therapy.  You will have a bandage, and you will need to keep it clean and dry.  The most important thing is that you will need to keep the ankle and foot elevated to keep the sweeling down.  You will be on crutches too during those weeks you are recovering from surgery and take the pain relievers prescribed by your doctor.<br>  Ganglion cysts can be very painful.  I would get them removed before they get any bigger.<br>  See your doctor and talk about all your options and the best way to help you and the pain you are in right now.<br>  Best of luck.

dpgXzMenaa	It might, and it might not.   What you dream seldom has much to do with what you've been doing before you fell asleep.<br>  <br>  One thing, though... having an orgasm (or several if you want to keep at it) is very a good way to *get* to sleep: the oxytoxin and endorphins it sends into your blood are *great* relaxation AND sleep inducers.|`|CpevWaQ7aa	Not really no.|`|5FY5LBLTaa	Hi Nina;<br>       No, I do not think having an orgasm has anything to do with what you dream. I do think that what causes you to dream are 2 things....first, whatever you were reading, thinking about, or watching on the TV, when you fell asleep, is still on your mind and can trigger you to dream futher on the subject. Second, many people do not begin dreaming until they have had plenty of rest and your subconscience begins to ease you to awaken. What orgasms can do is help you to sleep better; especially if you have had the ultimate orgasmic experience of a lifetime; that causes you to experience mutiple orgasms lasting as long as 15 to 20 minutes in a single incident of love-making.|`|YzaqI9BJaa	No it doesnt.
0TT5q0cUaa	almonds have saturated fats which are good for the body and not at all of any harm.<br>  Nuts have a high content of oil and protein. Most nuts are rich in monounsaturated fat (oleic acid).<br>  <br>  Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids are known to have a cholesterol lowering effect. The dietary fibre contents of nuts are moderately high. Dietary fibre also has cholesterol-lowering properties. Nuts are a good source of protein. <br>  <br>  Nuts contain a good range of essential minerals and are high in copper. Weight Loss diets can sometimes be low in copper and eating 28 g nuts (two of the little packets served on airlines) would add 0.37 mg copper to the daily intake. If a person has a low copper intake this increase would have a positive reducing effect on blood cholesterol levels and slow the development of arteriosclerosis. <br>  <br>  Nuts are an excellent source of the antioxidant vitamins particularly Vitamin E that functions to trap free radicals thus preventing the oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids in the tissues. Nut oils contain reasonable amounts of unsaturated fatty acids. Nuts are also a good source of magnesium.<br>  <br>  Enjoy small portions of nuts. They can be a good snack. 15 gms of nuts have about 270 calories.
m5gJKkLcaa	The average is an A cup but lots of people start from entirely different ranges - I started as an AA cup, but other people start as D cups, or even E cups!  Do you mean that you have or haven't started your period?  If you haven't, these are things to consider:<br>  <br>  Let it come in time. It could be anytime from tommorow to another 2, 3 years. If you actually look at a little child's legs, theirs are actually quite hairy, you just become more conscious of it, and eventually they grow slightly thicker.<br>  <br>  The main physical signs are that:<br>  <br>  - Your breasts develop (but not always until after period)<br>  - Your hips widen<br>  - You have pubic hair<br>  - You grow lots taller<br>  - Your body hair (underarms and on legs particularly) gets thicker<br>  - You get discharge (not in all cases)<br>  <br>  Some people get discharge which thickens and may change from being a white / clear colour to be a yellow or brown colour, or pink colour when you are about to start. If it is heavy and you would rather your mother / guardian didn't see it when you put your underwear in the wash, wear pantiliners (a thinner pad) if you have some, and if not find a way of asking your mum to buy you some. I got it at school - many years ago and it's fine, just buy a pad and keep one with you at school - and if you aren't that close to your mum / guardian, then either ask her by a text message if you can buy some just in case (or some other way indirectly) or check with a close friend that she has one just in case. If you can't get a pad, just carry some soft tissue around with you just in case, because you can just fold that up and put that down below if necessary.<br>  <br>  When you do start your period, don't feel self conscious, because unless you are wearing skintight shorts and a couple of massive pads, no body can see your pads. If you want to use a tampon, use one if your mum will let you but non-applicator ones (the ones without a plastic case) are easier to apply the first time. Just makesure you change your pad, whenever it looks drenched in blood, or the blood lies on the top of the pad (meaning that it can't absorb any more, change your pad. Also, don't flush them don't the toilet - not a smart idea. Finally, don't try to put a tampon on before you start your period, because it won't be very slippy up there, making it a lot harder to apply, and also making it hurt a lot more.<br>  <br>  I got it at school - many years ago and it's fine, just buy a pad and keep one with you at school - and if you aren't that close to your mum / guardian, then either ask her by a text message if you can buy some just in case (or some other way indirectly) or check with your friend that she has one just in case. It came as a complete surprise to me, but it just will do with some people, I wouldn't bother going to your school nurse and telling her because it is most likely that she will just give you a tissue, or a wipe, or something not of much use. If you cramp really bad, just DO go to the nurse and tell her that you have really bad tummy pains, and you have a headache and a sore throat, etc.<br>  <br>  The average age is 13 to start but enjoy your years as a normal teenage girl whilst you can, because periods can be such a big annoyance!

AA11364723	You can be checked at that time, but you'd have to request it.  The pap smear is strictly a check for cancerous or precancerous cells.  It does not screen for STDs.|`|rxScdXM4aa	yes, they can check for chlamydia and gonorrhea|`|jcL7gDMKaa	As far as Im aware they are supposed to be just checking for signs of cervical cancer. you have to request a test if you think you are at risk of an STD.|`|EsvJ9ji3aa	not only do they check for the above but also HPV|`|qfSKgxDsaa	yeppers|`|NBuFZd5Aaa	yes|`|dG3mYc9uaa	No they don't. A Papanicolau (or Pap) cervical smear is a technique by which a sample of the lining of your cervix is analysed under a microscope in search for cancer or pre-cancer cells. Your cervix is quite high up - between the top of your vagina and the opening of the uterus - and anything going on below there will not be detected. This sample is not cultured for bacteria such as Chlamydia or Gonorrhoea and is not tested for viruses such as Herpes or HIV. If the clinician taking the sample suspects an STD (because of sexual habits, discharge, redness or itching) they might offer to take some special samples for STDs. Otherwise, if you are worried you might have an infection, you NEED to tell the clinician and ask for the tests.|`|ePZN6RG3aa	If you ask for it to be done just before/ after then they will. But they are mainly checking for cancer.

But it is worth investigating, just in case.
qnD5RfbPaa	The condition is called twitching.  Twitching has to do with your nerve. It involves involuntary contraction of the muscles. In the case of the eye, it involves involuntary contraction of the muscle of the eye lids and mainly involves the lower eyelid and to a lesser extend the upper lid. There seem to be no known medical reason for twitching, however it is found that under stress, these twitches tend to be aggravated. Twitches are also associated with caffeine consumption, drug overdose, a diet deficiency fatigue, drug side effect (such as diuretics, corticosteroids and estrogen) and excessive squinting (in the case of the eye). If the twitching involves both eyes it is possible that you have blephorospasm.<br>  <br>  "In most cases, blepharospasm seems to develop spontaneously. Many blepharospasm patients have a previous history of dry eyes and/or light sensitivity. Blephorospasm can also come from abnormal functioning of the brain's basal ganglia. Concomitance with dry eye, as well as other dystonias such as Meige's syndrome has been observed. Some drugs can induce blepharospasm, such as those used to treat Parkinson's disease, as well as sensitivity to hormone treatments, including Estrogen replacement therapy for women going through Menopause. Blepharospasms can be caused by concussions in some rare cases, when a blow to the back of the head damages the basal ganglia."<br>  <br>  I would suggest however, that you consume more foods that will nourish the nerve. Foods such as Sea fish, and sea vegetables, papaya, carrots, broccoli, cantaloupe, egg, kale, celery, goat's milk, nuts, honey, molasses, avocado, cherries, seeds, liver, asparagus, brussels sprouts, dulse, watercress, mushrooms, yogurt, spinach, beef and all dairy products, tomatoes, potatoes, bananas, beans, cabbage, plantains, corn, mackerel, legumes, oranges and salmon.<br>  Drink lots of fresh raw fruit juices and fresh raw vegetable juices.<br>  <br>  For temporary relief you may try applying a warm compress to the affected areas. In the case of the eyes you would saturate a towel in some warm water. Wring out the excess water. Lay back with your eyes closed and lay the warm towel on top. Let it remain there for 15 minutes or until the towel is cooled. You may do the same for the hip.<br>  <br>  And if you're on any medication you might want to discus the side effects with your doctor. It would be good if you read the leaflet that comes with any medications you're on.|`|FQxbwbtlaa	i know this cause mam has it its just nerves it takes a while to handle but youll get used of it is like when you shake in terror u can controll it!|`|8FQqFb5Saa	i am no doctor, but i often experience the same thing and more often when i am stressed.

For running, I run at a speed of 5.5-6 mph on an incline of 0-1, with 1 minute of warm-up before I run at 3.5 mph and for at least 5-10 minutes to cool down afterward. I stretch as well for approximately 5 minutes. I take Sundays off to rest and relax. Push pull for example is doing triceps extension with or without a break then doing biceps curls and adding reverse or regular crunches in there to make sure I get abs in and it cuts down on time. I do abs a lot to keep my core strong. I try to get all of the muscles in that area to work together on the same day. Do the amount of weight for what you want to accomplish. Say for toning, lightweight and high reps (15-20) and 3-4 sets. To build muscle, 2-3 sets and 10-12 reps. All beginners need to start with 1-2 sets and 8-10 reps with lightweights.

LzJMaw2Iaa	As with any cancer, what happens is that abnormal cells divide at an uncontrollable rate and overtake normal cells.  In the case of lung cancer, we'll assume that the patient was a lifelong smoker and the toxins caused a mutation in some of the cells.  These mutated cells are missing a piece at the end of each chromosome that gets shorter with each division and when it's completely gone the cell knows to stop replicating.  Because this "timer" is missing on the mutated (cancerous) cells, they never stop dividing.  This basic concept is the same no matter what form of cancer you're talking about.  What differs is where the cancer is, which determines whether a tumor is formed, healthy cells in the blood are depleted, or organs are slowly overtaken and become unable to function.
GT6396BDaa	What probably happened is that you were given the pain medicine too late.  When you are in pain for a long time and it gradually gets worse, if you wait too long to take any pain medication, it will not help.  Your pain level is so high so medications won't help very often.  The best way to relieve pain is to take it as son as it happens.  That way you break the pain cycle.  <br>  Best of luck.  Hope you feel better and that I helped.

I ate like a horse, made sure I ate at least 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight, and I used Mike Mentzer High Intensity training routines (AKA heavy duty).<br>  <br>  Here is a youtube clip of one of the routines. clip is kinda boring, but gets the point across<br>  <br>  Part 1<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqR0-ndcNwU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqR0-ndcN...</a><br>  part 2<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ygRRZmDv88" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ygRRZmDv...</a><br>  part 3<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J6ahkf9ydQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J6ahkf9y...</a><br>  <br>  Now here is my whey protein schedule<br>  <br>  Right out of bed 50 gram shake/smoothie<br>  Immediately after workout 50 gram shake/smoothie<br>  Right before bed 50 gram shake/smoothie<br>  <br>  Then sometimes if I wake up in the middle of the night, I will go to the kitchen and have another 50 gram shake/smoothie.<br>  <br>  This blows up recovery and puts the mass on quick!<br>  <br>  Here is a protein link<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.buybulkwhey.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.buybulkwhey.com/</a><br>  <br>  Here is a WICKED gainer smoothie video<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TQBhriecC0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TQBhriec...</a><br>  <br>  Try and eat a  couple of these mega gainer smoothies per day in addition to your normal diet and your sure to gain!!!|`|G1OSlub8aa	Your doing way to much. Dont lift weights every day unless it is 1 body part per day, and if that is the case, your doing it for to long. The best schedule for gains is a 3 days on 2 days off split routine with weights.|`|2jHMoffpaa	Looks good to me. Im gonna borrow it.
HmzMLkymaa	It's so good to hear such a progress report :)  It's amazing how time and self awareness can turn things around for us.  However, I'm still going through a difficult time in my life, but reading this post really put a huge smile on my face.  It gives me hope knowing that things will get better :)|`|29e999153715416dcc6bab042f16f0c4aa	I'm glad to hear that you are better. Now as for myself that is a different matter. I've been struggling with a mental illness ever since I turned 23. My schizoaffective gets really bad sometimes while other days it is manageable. I feel like I'm being backed into a corner of despair. As of this writing I see no other choice than to apply for disability as I find it impossible to work and my therapist concurs. I do try to keep a positive outlook on life no matter what, but usually I'm really skeptical. <br>  <br>  I've heard that saying that things will get better. I feel like someone or something is playing a trick on me. Once in a while things are good and then before I know it the good is replaced with the bad. I wanted to buy a handgun, but my friends talked me out of it which I suppose is for the best. I know if I had that sort of temptation I probably would end my life. Just to clarify I'm not suicidal right this moment. I just feel downright impossible sometimes. The only things that keeps me going is my support person and medication. The medication is starting to lose its effectiveness. When I see my psychiatrist next I think I'll ask for a switch to something more tolerable. <br>  <br>  Once again I'm glad to hear you are feeling better. Best wishes!|`|9EVcTnUWaa	My life experiences are much like yours.  There have been periods when things have been very very good and times when they have been truly horrible.  I've been hospitalized and to the point where I was almost non functioning. But with a lot of therapy the help of medications and the support of my family, I've been able to raise 3 girls all of whom have various severe learning disabilities and they are all doing well and will continue to do so.  I will have to work on maintaining my stability and to continue my therapy probably for life but I can and will do it.|`|4juunPpoaa	aaah god I'm like you! I looked through all my old questions and its so weird how different they are. <br>  <br>  my mental health has gone from.depressed, to sucicidal, to self harming, to depressed, to happy, then depressed and now happy again. Its the weirdest thing to think this time a few months ago I was self harming! <br>  Yeah my problems have got a lot worse than before,but I can cope now. Even if I do have my bad periods, I'm still happy:)<br>  <br>  Glad to hear you're coping well =D well done:)|`|0C5TBPEvaa	It has been a rough one :] haha. But I'm glad to hear you're doing well! <br>  My story is:<br>  <br>  I was diagnosed with a generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder when I was 13. I went to a public high school and had severe panic attacks every day in class. And at first I took Paxil then for some reason they switched me to Prozac, but it made me hear voices so I got switched again to Zoloft and eventually got up to 250 mg a day because the anxiety got so bad. Then my family moved to Montana, I had lived in New Mexico for 9 years, so being uprooted like that was hard. And the anxiety got really bad. So when Junior year started I couldn't sit in class and ended up barely passing that year. I also started cutting myself in 8th grade and managed to keep it a secret until 10th grade. I turned 16 in Montana and that's when I found out I have Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. So now I'm working my way back up to 250 mg and I'm doing CBT to help me with the OCD. [Google CBT if you don't know what it is.] It's been a struggle. But I'm doing so much better. :]|`|hV9BvvKyaa	i agree with mis cat,after your first manic episode life is never what it was.i'll tell you what since that first severe manic episode,i can't say i am or ever WILL be the same person. I'm only 18. Which is flippin the worst position i could ever be in,talk about ruining my TEEN days eh?Its weird how when people have TRUE problems(especially at this age) we keep it too ourselves. i'm embarressed and feel no one will understand me.i don't want SYMPATHY i want EMPATHY.Its weird how you hear kids "ohhhh im depressed,nenene,i wanna kill myself" its like,take a walk in my shoes,i take the time too appreciate the little things.If you really feel that way you'd do anything too not feel that way.I have no real friends,i don't know WHY (i have my own distorted outlook on it :/)  i'm socially akward.I DO have a boyfriend though who is VERY supportive,I believe hes my angel. :p I am very,VERY self aware which helps alot. my dad is SEVERLY disabled by this mental illness(he was diagnosed a paranoid shizsophrenic) it scares me to DEATH.but i remind myself i am not him. If you were too see me you wouldn't even guess i am like this(myspace.com/jesszampacorta,lol if you're interested) i love the internet especially yahoo and youtube because i have found many people related too me and its conforting.I am currently perscribed too limictal,and seroquil for my phsycotic symptoms.i have pretty bad anxiety so i'm looking into meds for that :/ i've had four therapists but haven't really had a great connection with any.trying out a new one this tuesday actually :P I live a relitivley normal life,untill my manic/anxiety ridden episodes come, which oddly always come at night(thank you god for seroquil!!) i remember when i was a wee one i had delusions too,and a little OCD,which proves you cannot put an age to ANY illness.honestly i try to make fun of myself,the silly dellusions i have,they'll always be there but i tell myself its not MY fault i have this and this disorder is not ME i just have IT,i'm learning how to tame the beast,it just is very hard sometimes. i guess my big journey just started:/ i'm trying to keep my head up,i'm the strongest person i know.<br>  <br>  ahh,venting.:D<br>  <br>  its REALLY good to hear your doing well.keep up the positivety love!|`|xnZi0i8saa	I just wrote this letter to a friend.... I guess it explains it well.....<br>  <br>  Everything else is OK I suppose. Some days it's hard for me to judge. Sometimes it seems like my life is run by this whole Bipolar thing. I have been told that things are never quite the same after your first true manic episode and these days I'm inclined to believe it. It's been what, 3 or 4 years now? I just can't seem to get my footing. We are still messing with medications because we can't seem to find the right combo and I seem to be prone to severe side effects to those that control the mania. One anti psychotic gave me panic attacks so bad I was in my doctors office sure I was having a heart attack....... I went thorough a bottle of benzo's in a week and I am really very responsible about using those only when I really need them. The next one made me so suicidal I was writing letters to my kids....... Then one made me manic and I took my credit cards which I have been working so hard to pay off and ran them up to the limit....... The Lamictal makes me forget...... I sat at my desk in tears a couple of weeks ago because for the life of me I couldn't remember how to do the simplest of my financials...... Makes me want to stop taking all of them....... But I did that when I was unemployed and slowly sank into a deep but quiet depression..... I stopped talking to anyone, stopped cleaning house, stopped showering, stopped thinking, slept 12/14 hours a day. So I started back on antidepressants and they make me manic but that time I was just jittery, jumpy, flighty.... not the pleasant fun mania that I am used to. I can't sleep. It's frustrating. I may just bite the bullet and go the Lithium route... my psychiatrist thinks I might benefit but she respects my choices as long as I'm trying. I go from loving my house and madly painting and redecorating rooms to hating it and wanting to just up and move into a nice easy apartment....... I did get a raise AND a bonus which puts me at only 3k less than I made at my last job...... so money is still tight.   I am trying hard to avoid anything stressful (like my mother and brother).  However, I have an occasional day where I feel normal, centered, me. I have moments of happiness and laughter... like yesterday, but then I know it will be shallow and transient...... So I keep on keeping on. Sounds horrible doesn't it. Maybe that's just the end of February talking. It's maybe not as bad as it sounds. Looking back I can recognize that I have been bipolar since I was about 13. So I am somewhat used to feeling like there are multiple people living in my skin. I can see how it has worsened with time and I am committed to the meds because as frustrating as they are I do not want to go where I was 3 years ago. I am making progress. Hard to believe I'm considered "high functioning".<br>   <br>  I am looking forward to spring. I have a few simple projects. Not like last summer when I thought it would be a great idea to put new siding on my house, by myself. All I'm doing is removing one stone garden bed, putting in two wooden raised beds... one for my herbs and one for a salsa garden....... I can already smell the lilacs.
9pLdhuBnaa	You could be dealing with something like acid reflux disease (an example only).<br>  <br>  The school nurse might be able to help you figure out if it is indeed acid reflux disease but the only way to know for sure is to see a doctor.  I would recommend making an appointment with the clinic doctor if they have one available.  If not, check with the city health department to see if they have a free health clinic that can help evaluate this further for you.

And the chances a spider would bite you for no reason are that big so it's probably an ant or mosquito.|`|R5th0FxSaa	Try searching the web for poisonous spider bite. You'll find pictures, I promise. Or you could ask a doctor. But if it doesn't hurt and you haven't seen any spiders, I wouldn't worry too much.
rJNY5G6Saa	As the child of two nutritionists, I can tell you that it is just as much exercise as it is diet.  Try to work some cardio in if nothing else, even if it is just going for a brisk walk several times a week.  But as far as dieting is concerned, I have found that by eliminating all drinks except water has been a great way to shed some extra pounds (I dropped about 10 from just doing that for a summer).  Fruits & veggies are wonderful and best when eaten raw.  They are something you can eat a lot of without having to feel guilty afterwards and so many tasty things are in season right now.  Watch how much salt you add to food- it makes you retain water.  <br>  Also, when watching what they eat, women especially tend to forget about the little bites of things off someone's plate or the snacks here and there.  Remember that these add up! Most importantly, don't do anything too drastic- you're still on the younger side to be dieting, especially considering your weight is well within normal for someone your height.  Good luck!|`|wBWc4b5naa	you can eat whatever you want, just watch your portions.  are you working out?  if you are only trying to make subtle changes in your belly and legs, that may be enough. if you cut back on portions you will definately start to see changes|`|y0z2K6owaa	Great post!

fMilDRgLaa	Your kidneys are located on the left and right side of your lower back. If you were to slice a kidney it would look like the many layers of a cabbage. They are about the size of your fist.<br>  Kidneys are an organ in the body that filters your blood to excrete the toxins through your urine. If too many toxins develop and your kidneys do not perform well kidney function is lost and eventually transplant or dialysis will be needed. Kidneys help produce red blood cells to carry oxygen to all parts of your body.  <br>  This is just some of the main purposes of kidneys.<br>  Here is a informative website<br>  www.kidney.org|`|4eaf3b65b8bcd61e0c28ed377fb53935aa	kidney filters blood taking out waste that is excreted in urine.|`|FpFHtxVlaa	Kidneys filter your blood and take the waste products like amino acids which are converted into urea , some urea salts and water they are found in the middle between your ribcage and your waist|`|ndO6MiQaaa	HI.ur kidneys are above ur bum at the bottom of ur back if u ever think <br>  u have an infection u would have like a stinging pressure pain i got a lot of them when i was expecting my son .

With any luck it could be something simple like an internal hemorrhoid. As to anything else i would rather not guess, sorry but i really hope she can see a doctor just in case it is something seriously wrong. Good luck and perhaps she could borrow some money to see a doctor because she needs it checked, living with constant pain is no good for anyone and she is better to find out so she can have it fixed.

YdOyAcAAaa	Best time for resistance training?  There is none.  Best time for cardio?  In the morning, BEFORE you eat breakfast is the best.  Right after you wake up will be the longest you will go without eating.  Your body will have used up most of its food as its energy source, so you will be more likely to burn fat.  You will burn 300% more fat.  You do have to eat before (not right before) you lift weights, though, or you won't have enough energy.  :)|`|947a0dc92dd1bc409cf80a04f33e48e0aa	It really doesn't matter as long as you keep going.

Contract your abs to lift your the torso off the ball, pulling the bottom of your ribcage down toward your hips. As you curl up, keep the ball stable.<br>  <br>  <br>  Crunch & Reach<br>  Begin with body straight over the ball, light weight extended behind you (not shown). Contract the abs to lift and bring the weight over the head, crunching up and twisting to the right, contracting the right side of waist. Repeat for all reps and then switch sides.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Modified Plank<br>  Begin by placing elbows on the floor and resting body on the knees. Pull the abs tight to hold your body in a straight line from head to knees without sagging in the middle, eyes looking naturally forward. Hold this position for as long as you can, relax and repeat 3 or more times.<br>  <br>  <br>  Knee Tucks<br>  Start in plank position on the ball, with the ball under the shins/ankles. Roll the ball towards you with your feet, tightening the abs into a crunch.<br>  <br>  <br>  Woodchops<br>  Attach one end of a resistance band to something sturdy and wrap the band around your hand a few times for the right tension. Grasp the band in both hands and begin in a lunge position, reaching down with the arms Keeping the arms straight the entire time, rotate and lift the body towards the other side while sweeping the arms on a diagonal. Return to start and repeat before moving onto the other side.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hip Extension on the Ball<br>  Lie on the floor with feet heels propped on ball. Keeping abs tight, slowly lift your hips off the floor (squeezing the buttocks) until body is in a straight line. Hold for a few seconds and lower<br>  <br>  <br>  Ball Taps<br>  Sit on the ball with strong abs and straight spine, hands behind the head. Contract your abs and lift the right foot, tapping it on a medicine ball in front of you. Lower and repeat with the other foot, alternating sides. Use your abs to keep your balance.<br>  <br>  How to Work Your Abs<br>  <br>  * You can effectively work your abs with 3 non-consecutive workouts a week<br>  * Do 1-3 sets of 12-16 reps of each exercise. If that's too easy, make sure you're doing each exercise correctly and using perfect form. You can add a dumbbell or plate to crunches to add difficulty.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps!|`|AA12233117	you know this will depend on how fit you are already....and if you have been doing lots of exercises to date and haven't seen the pack then you may just need to be leaner.....I think I've heard for the average guy they need to get down to about 7-8% body fat but I'm not sure how healthy that is on an individual basis<br>  <br>  I do know that weight are the way to go and if you're pretty fit already then lunges and squats using weights and curls and chin ups are good but you need to do them properly or you'll do damage and it's just not worth it<br>  <br>  Also exercises that use your own body weight but not just individual muscle groups but many are better and tend to build a better core<br>  <br>  you're reps, weights etc would really depend on your own position....why not ask the trainers at the gym?|`|xFeGxPtoaa	gyms are for soft people<br>  <br>  go hardcore in parks like me thats how u get rock solid. =D<br>  <br>  a programmmmeee for a six pack though would be CRUNCHES!!!<br>  <br>  and those work outs they do in the 8 min abs video on you tube<br>  <br>  Also the skinnier you the more your muscles will show.<br>  <br>  Jogging will make your lower abs look more cut.

Some people are more prone to them. It's caused by bacteria. You really need to get to a doctor and get an antibiotic for it.. It may go on it's own, but the pain is usually so bad, that you can't wait.. Passing it back and forth.. hmm. Well that's how bugs opperate.. Take the kids to doc also and get antibiotics for them. It should to the job.. Bacteria just attacks clogged sinus areas when you get a cold and this is what causes it.. Good Luck|`|RP2QQXbjaa	It's hard to prevent sinus infections other then making sure to have proper hygiene such as hand washing.  As far as treatment goes, if it's a bacterial infection, you will probably need antibiotics from your doctor.<br>  <br>  Also, to add to what others have said... <br>   - An influenza shot has nothing to do with sinus infections, it only helps you to have immunity against specific strains of the influenza virus. <br>   - Sinus infections are generally bacterial infections, not viral.|`|bHuuBaT1aa	I always get sinus infections plus sinus headaches.

fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	I'd recommend not using tampons, they are the most common option but they are unhealthy and unhygienic so many women don't like using them, these can also leak and they have strings you have to hide under your swimsuit, but they are internal so discreet. Tampons are harmful as they prevent the vagina from cleaning out harmful bacteria, they give bacteria the perfect place to multiply within the vagina, they damage walls of the vagina which is a factor in contracting TSS, and commercial brands contain chemicals and bleach which alter vaginal pH in turn throwing off balance of ‘good’ and ‘bad’ bacteria. Commercial tampons such as Tampax are a bigger risk because they contain chemicals and bleach, they are also made form synthetics which cause more damage to the vaginal walls as they are harsh so friction contributes, they are more absorbent so dryness contributes, and more fibres are lost when the tampon is removed meaning bacteria continue multiply even once the tampon is removed. <br>  <br>  Pads can be used for swimming, but commercial pads like Always or organic pads like Cottons will go soggy in the water and come unstuck so use cloth pads or something similar, you can only use pads with light flow as when wet they can't hold as much, and just hide under a pair of shorts. Cloth pads like Lunapads <a href="http://www.lunapads.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.lunapads.com</a> won't come unstuck as they are held in place with poppers rather than glued in. You can use period belts like Reddy's <a href="http://www.reddyspads.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.reddyspads.com</a> which are extra-long pads that fasten around your waste so more secure and easier to hide, better still are period panties like Lunapanties from Lunapads, these are underwear with pads built-in so better protection, easier to hide and more comfortable. <br>  <br>  Menstrual cups like Divacup <a href="http://www.divacup.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.divacup.com</a> are the best option, these are internal bell-shaped cups, which are much healthier and more hygienic than tampons, as well as more comfortable, easier to use, convenient, and reliable. You can leave cups for up to 12 hours even before your period or during heavy days, so no having to change all the time and cups don't leak so no risk of embarrassment. There's nothing showing outside of your body so they are more discreet. You can use a diaphragm as a menstrual cup, or use softcups like Instead <a href="http://www.softcups.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.softcups.com</a> which are diaphragm-shaped so sit further up in your vagina, they work on the same idea as menstrual cups so have similar benefits, but they aren't as easy to use as menstrual cups.|`|AA10628838	Either wear a tampon or get excused.|`|HSbcscbuaa	yes u could i used them before its better than bleeding in the pool and other people are swimming 2 so u should just where a tampon but i also went without 1 cus the chmicals in the pool make sure u dnt realy leak cus when u take a shower u dont leak right? cus i thik when ur lower area is wet it doesnt leak.|`|4eaf3b65b8bcd61e0c28ed377fb53935aa	tampons are fine in the pool (make sure the string isn't hanging out of your suit), but if you are scared to use one, or don't know how, it might be difficult at first.

fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	Whoa there, just because you go swimming doesn’t mean that you have to use tampons, considering how unsafe and unhygienic tampons are as well as all the other options out there that are much better than tampons, there’s no need for any women in this day and age to be using tampons. <br>  <br>  Pads can be used for swimming, but commercial pads like Always or organic pads like Cottons will go soggy in the water and come unstuck so use cloth pads or something similar, you can only use pads with light flow as when wet they can't hold as much, and just hide under a pair of shorts.

To insert first wash hands, also do this after. Wait until a heavy day and use the lowest absorbency, get into a comfortable position, unwrap the tampon and pull the string so it hangs freely. Hold the tampon in one hand and with the other hand hold your labia open out of the way of your vaginal opening, then insert the tampon as far as it will go, aim towards the small of your back. Don't be scared to put your fingers into your vagina, it's yours, it's clean and menstrual blood is clean, if you're tense your vagina will tense so relax. If you have problems try masturbating as when aroused your vagina doubles in size, becomes relaxed and lubricated, or use lubrication such as KY jelly or olive oil to make insertion easier. If you feel pain as you move after insertion it's not in far enough so remove and try again with a fresh tampon later. If you have problems inserting don't panic just try another time or use another option such as pads, sponges, softcups, free-flow, or menstrual cups. To remove get comfortable, relax and pull strings gently but firmly, if you can't find the strings or are using cloth, sponge or soft tampons just grab the tampon itself to remove. A tampon can never get lost inside you, but if you can't remove them you need to ask someone for help or go to hospital. Tampons aren't flushable so wrap up and bin. You need to change every 4-6 hours, always use the lowest absorbency making sure to change as your flow changes, never use when your flow is light, before your period or when you go to bed. You should alternate between tampons and pads, pads are also needed as back-up, try Lunapads which are far more comfortable than pads you may be used to. Tampons have many health risks as they encourage bacteria, damage vaginal walls and some brands contain harmful chemicals, as a result tampons have many health risks associated with them such as vaginal infections or the rare but life-threatening illness Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS). This is why there are precautions to follow when using tampons, note the younger you are the higher the risk. Symptoms of TSS are headache, vomiting, rash, high fever and diarrhea, if you suspect you have TSS remove the tampon immediately and go straight to hospital. See <a href="http://www.spotsite.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.spotsite.org</a> and <a href="http://www.toxicshock.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.toxicshock.com</a>|`|OwQsCR4Saa	Start with slim tampons.  You put the applicator in your vagina and push the applicator up.  This inserts the tampon.  If for any reason, when you stand up or move, the tampon hurts...you need to remove it and try again.  Your vagina needs to be wet before you insert.  It makes it easier.  Usually, when you are on your period, this is not a problem.  Practice at home...don't use the supers until you know what you're doing.  Good luck.|`|3WcCeOqdaa	The instructions on the box/insert will help.<br>  <br>  I've posted the below on a few questions and this may help:<br>  <br>  Definitely do not use scented menstrual products. In fact, non-organic cotton is one of the most pesticide laden crops there is in the world so unless you use organic cotton tampons, you still risk TSS (Toxic Shock Syndrome) if you leave a tampon in too long. Using them anyway exposes you to the pesticides in the cotton.<br>  <br>  In any case, I have used organic cotton tampons but the best thing since sliced bread for periods is a menstrual cup! You need nothing else and it's so easy and versatile and very cost efficient.<br>  <br>  Check out either the Diva Cup or The Keeper. The Keeper is no longer sold in Canada (that's what I used for 2+ years, the same one even!) because it's made in the USA and the company didn't get a renewed license with Health Canada or something but now I've ordered the Diva Cup which is similar.<br>  <br>  Basically the cup holds about 6 oz of menstrual fluid. It's easy to insert and extract to empty. On your heaviest days you may want to check it a few times throughout the day to see how often you may need to empty it. It too can overflow and leak but once you're used to it in conjunction with your flow, you will never use pads or tampons again!<br>  <br>  Different companies will sell these. I got mine from <a href="http://www.grassrootsstore.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.grassrootsstore.com/</a> but they each have their own sites:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.divacup.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.divacup.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.keeper.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.keeper.com/</a><br>  <br>  You can probably get them cheaper but I paid around $50 for The Keeper. That's about 4 or 5 boxes of tampons; so how long would that last you? The "cup" will last several months. They recommend changing it every year but mine literally lasted longer than 2 years. Not only do you not have to carry around tampons but you're not filling landfills with menstrual products! You don't have to worry about properly disposing of anything.<br>  <br>  Cleaning is easy. Anti-bacterial soap and warm/hot water.<br>  <br>  They generally come in 2 sizes: regular and "have had a baby" (since you stretch so the size would have to be a bit bigger).<br>  <br>  PS: I am a black belt in karate and have found this product absolutely fabulous! In karate, I wear a WHITE uniform for several hours and there's been NO accidents. :)|`|fBVPYaAgaa	when you bye a box of tampons look at the box, there will be dirrections on them. no they do not hurt just make sure you put them in right and the right angle. <br>  hope this helped:)<3|`|BRDqfAy3aa	read and see pictures below - How Insert Tampon Correctly|`|h5xSfcT6aa	instruction booklets come with every box. also type into google and you ll get diagrams and plenty of tips.  <br>  its easier to look at them than us explain. but email me if you want tips.<br>  good luck<br>  xxx|`|A9KVTIDyaa	i remember my first time with a tampon.<br>  i was terrified... i actually think i might have cried from being so scared before i put it in.<br>  <br>  okay here are some good tips:<br>  use a PLASTIC applicator.  cardboard is so hard to use, even now and i'm almost 21.<br>  try the slender fit by Playtex.  they're great for first time use.<br>  it doesn't hurt, if it feels more uncomfortable then you think it should, i.e. it hurts or it feels funny to walk or anything (remember at first its going to feel weird because you aren't used to the tampon) then take it out and reinsert a new tampon.<br>  the best way to insert it would be to stand with your knees slightly bent and just hold it right at the canal and lightly push until its completely in.<br>  you don't have to shove it in or anything so don't worry about pushing it too hard.<br>  since you are swimming be sure to take it out and either reinsert a new  one or put on a pad as soon as you get done.  the water from the pool will cause your tampon to soak and be more susceptible to leaks.<br>  i hope this helps. =)<br>  good luck.. and before you know it you'll use tampons all the time.<br>  they're much more comfortable then pads... they're not diapers ;)
9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	Although I accept that some 14 year olds may be physically mature enough for sex, you are by no means psychologically mature enough. As Dr Frank as said, the fact you have even asked this question demonstrates your immaturity- not just sex-wise, but in general.<br>  <br>  I accept that nothing we say is going to make much difference because at 14 you can't see what we are saying and you will not realise until you are older and look back. When I was 14 (which is less than 10 years ago) I didn't listen to anything adults said either, but trust me, if you have sex now, you will regret it. I hope some of this absorbs and you re-consider.|`|Rk46lIBwaa	The mere fact that you asked this question in this way confirms that you are not only immature in years but in understanding.<br>  <br>  BTW sex with you is a criminal offence potentially punishable by a jail sentence!|`|eHUXcYZhaa	Please don't do it. It's only natural for you to have sexual feelings but just stick to masturbation for now. Trust me you will regret having sex at such a young age. Sex isn't just a penis into a vagina, it's emotional, psychological and at your age it could really affect you. Also sex does hurt quite a bit the first few times so you need to be with someone you know well. You need to be able to trust him and feel relaxed with him. Your body just isn't ready yet. Take care.|`|qitXGd0qaa	O.k. here are all the problems I have with this situation:<br>  <br>  #1- You're 14<br>  #2- He's some random guy on MSN<br>  #3- You're 14!<br>  #4- You don't know this person!<br>  <br>  Don't have sex at age 14 with somebody you don't know.|`|7i6qj4OXaa	You are fourteen and it is illegal.  I bet he doesn't know you are fourteen and if you had sex with him, he could be prosecuted and possibly end up in prison.  He wouldn't like you so much then.

I was supposed to be staying over at his house and I knew all day that tonight was going to be the night - we hadn't really talked about it but we both kind of knew and that is how your first time should be I think. <br>  You should know in your heart that it is the right thing to do, if you have any doubts don't do it, loads of people say they regret the first time.|`|TbapRrYGaa	OMG!? <br>  don't do anything you'll regret..<br>  and your 14!!!|`|dz97Jmnkaa	right. First of all your too young and it's illegal. So think about it. And if your unsure than this is a sign that your not ready just tell him it was a misunderstanding but you still like him, im sure he'll understand if he's decent. Just in future dont be so 'horneyness' it can really give out bad signals! Good luck.|`|w0ZqjJBtaa	You are clearly NOT ready. You are 14 what is the hurry? Sex is a mature act that takes a mature attitude. More importantly, you are 14 and are planning on meeting someone you DON'T KNOW from the internet. Don't you watch the news????|`|fox5a3ePaa	I think at 14 you are a bit young and the fact that you are asking this question on here says that you are not ready|`|4rFCesSsaa	If you must have sex before marriage, at least make sure it is with someone you know.  Do not meet this person!|`|K26ec4kLaa	Look Sugar:  you're under age, and u have no idea who this person really is that you're talking to.. Check out Perverted Justice and the show on TV where they have decoys pretending to be young kids on the internet and they make a date with a guy who is lying about his age, almost always, and shows up with all requests from the girl or boy.. Then Chris Hanson walks into the kitchen and sits the guy down for a chat. He has a whole transcript of the chat on the internet with the young girl or boy decoy.. When they walk out the door, police are waiting to greet them and they are arrested.  Just making a date with a girl or boy who is under age is against the law even if they don't get to do anything.. This person could be a pervert, sicko, or worse.. Why would you be so dumb?  14 huh?  You are NOT mature miss sugar with this type of behavior. Your a baby.  Get real and wait til you are able to be at least legal and old enough to get married if you should get pregnant. In short, get this crap outta your dumb head!  You'll be sorry.. Trust me..|`|naMnjVsmaa	well i would do it with someone you know and make sure he uses a condom at all cost  thats my advice|`|KxMzBFR2aa	ARE YOU CRAZY LITTLE GIRL!! <br>  <br>  wait a minute im not sure what you mean cuz you weren't clear with your words  i under stood that you met some guys on msn and now your having sex and not sure if you should bring condoms. <br>  <br>  <br>   im srr but why exactly would you just meet with some creep you met on line to have sex? do you have any idea what your getting into? you should at least some respect for your body you can catch and std aids and god knows what other nasty infections.<br>  what a shameful, lowest, most disgusting thing for any woman to do just to lower your self that way like YOUR SOME PIECE OF TRASH!! is sad especially coming form a 14 year old little girl|`|3WcCeOqdaa	Once you have sex you can never go back to not having had sex.  You might regret having sex but you will NEVER regret WAITING to have sex.<br>  <br>  You are NOT stuck.  Just because you told somebody on MSN that you wanted to have sex that doesn't mean you're obligated to.  Just ignore that person on MSN (literally, block them!).  <br>  <br>  As mature as you are now at 14, you will be even more mature at 15, 18, 21, 24.... You will learn about yourself and others so much in the next few years.  In your 20s, you will learn the most and have so many neat and unique experiences.<br>  <br>  I would suggest waiting and saving yourself.  You don't have to wait forever.  But wait this time.  Wait a month.  Wait a few months.  Wait a year... or maybe you will decide to wait until you love somebody for real, deep down and decide then to have sex.  It will be better and more worth it.<br>  <br>  Besides, a lot of women and especially girls (teenagers) do not necessarily enjoy their first time having sex.  It's because time helps us deal with our emotions and helps us get more prepared physically as well.  <br>  <br>  Also, when you are attracted to somebody and they like/love you, the experience will be much more pleasurable.<br>  <br>  On MSN you can fool around and lie, exaggerate and flirt all your want.  But leave it at that.  Have your fun on MSN but don't take it too literally and definitely DO NOT meet anybody in person that you have met online.|`|4juunPpoaa	I'm 14 and there are quite a few girls having a shag atm and its a biiiiig mistake.

Be careful who you talkto online not everyone is who they say. Its natural to be curious about sex but talking to someone you know & trust should help you get a better perspectiveon things.Take care.|`|RMaEeZssaa	grow up|`|2eGgbhVoaa	I had sex at your age and I have no regrets. Only have it if you want to. If not just be honest and say you want to wait a bit. If he does not want to wait then don't lose your virginity to him.

If you are thinking about having sex you need to talk to your family about it. You need to get on birth control. Teen pregnancy is at an all time high. If you cant talk to your mom or dad about it then you are not mature enough to be doing it.|`|JMs4RDVxaa	please, please, please don't do it. <br>  if he already knows where you live, call the cops.<br>  i know it's embarassing but NEVER have sex with someone that you don't know, especially if you're fourteen. <br>  <br>  those are the kind of guys you see on dateline 'to catch a predator.' it could turn out really badly, just be careful!|`|68PBA0wKaa	don't go. you don't even know the guy if he's a crazy psycho, or if he's married and has kids or even if he has some gross disease that he could give you. you could also get pregnant and i'm pretty sure that's not what you want at 14. save yourself for the right one who loves you.|`|l2PmvImMaa	Absolutly not.

2cb46ea6e0285a7d419967ceaef6f993aa	Yes smoking can make you age faster. You get more wrinkles in your face, especially around your lips from puffing on a cigarette. It causes stains on your teeth and lung problems. It most definitely makes anyone (not just women) look older.|`|6NA2MXNPaa	Yes, it effects the way you look. Especially around the mouth. People who smoke get wrinkles, like a puckered look around their mouth. It can also make people look older, age prematurely. I don't know if the saggy cheeks have anything to do with smoking, but I suppose it could.|`|2KC467tFaa	It ages people tremendously. I smoked for about a month, and I looked like crap. My skin was dull. I looked exhausted, and I felt horrible. You can almost always pick out the smokers from the non-smokers.|`|KIZVWREHaa	wither your a man or woman it will make you age faster along with tons of major diseases . You can always look at someone and tell if they are a smoker . Makes your hair awful and you get leathery skin and get a hard look to you not to mention this ruins your gums and teeth faster then sugar .|`|AA11662490	Yes it does age and wrinkle the skin . it kills the vitamin C in your body and causes lung cancer. Also causes COPD when you get older. my mom has it , from smoking.
CadIYXdXaa	Never, I repeat NEVER take out an infected piercing!! <br>  It locks the infection inside the wound, you have to wait for the infection to be gone before considering taking out the piercing jewelery.<br>  <br>  Also don't use peroxide, if you read on the bottle it is NOT to be used for pierced (hole) type wounds.<br>  <br>  Rinse and soak the piercing in a mixture of sea salt (not table salt) and water a couple times a day until it clears up. <br>  <br>  Also, see a doctor, you may need antibiotics.<br>  <br>  If you meant lips instead of hips, also rinse there area with a good mouthwash every time you eat/drink or smoke.<br>  <br>  ***Please people, if you don't know anything about piercings please don't post. Telling people to take out the jewelery of an infected piercing can lead to serious problems or even KILL the person.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Go to the doctor.

I guess you could put peroxide on it or something first but I wouldn't just because I would want to do exactly what the doctor says. If you don't get medical attention really bad things can happen. Good Luck.|`|ahH0AD80aa	You can buy antiseptic sprays cheap at the chemist give it a good spray a few times a day, spray some onto a Q-tip too and wipe it clean.<br>  <br>  If it's looking really awful, take it out and go to a doc, the infection could spread.|`|Wb1ydezNaa	I agree with taking them out and treating the area with peroxide|`|A3Jni6bNaa	um... maybe take the rings out. and clean the area well with like hydorgen peroxide|`|1RFB22eBaa	1st of all:<br>  Did you have them done professionally, or did you do them yourselves?  If you did them yourselves, remove the jewelry immediately, and go get it done professionally if you want it repierced.<br>  <br>  That being said, there are many things that could be causing your hip piercing to look bad, but rejection is the one you have to be most worried about. Is the skin on and around the piercing looking thinner or redder, and does it look like the piercing is coming out?  (picture example: <a href="http://hubpages.com/hub/Surface_Piercings" rel="nofollow">http://hubpages.com/hub/Surface_Piercing...</a> [scroll down to rejection and migration, itll give a better description])<br>  If this is the case, you need to take the piercing out AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  Failure to do so could result in some ugly scarring.<br>  <br>  If it's not rejection, there are a few things that could be causing them to look bad, such as:<br>  -The wrong jewelry:  is your jewelry shaped like a staple?  If it's not, then it's probably putting unnecessary pressure on the skin and increasing your chances for rejection.  If this has happened, but your piercing hasn't rejected yet, you need to chage the jewelry asap before your piercing rejects.<br>  -infection: I would reccommend rinsing twice a day with non-iodized sea salt and the hottest water you can stand.  This ensures the best, deepest cleaning you can get.  Also, some piercing places have specific products for surface piercings to clean them.  You'll just have to do a bit of research into that one.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped :)|`|Nuuk1Nwtaa	Go to the doctor's, have them take the stuff out and look at it. Let them clean it for you, and pay attention when they give you instructions on how to clean it. You may need to get a tetanus shot.<br>  <br>  And for chrissakes, if you do that again, either go see a professional or clean the sh*t you're using and clean the area twice a day with alcohol, witch hazel, and salt water.|`|voFR2se9aa	Go to the hospital or else it going to get worse<br>  my friend didn't go to the hospital and her ear <br>  got really bad.|`|WWhYCAbSaa	Have the doctors treat the infections and don't ever do that again.|`|AA11767076	You should go to your doctor to ensure that you do not have an infection or do not need a tetanus shot...|`|TLjbMQPRaa	wtf you can pierce hips?! Do you mean lips?|`|jeYi7APraa	pierced you HIPS huh? wow sounds painful...<br>  anyways..take them out now before it gets worse..|`|NcAAqe9Iaa	omg take them out NOW! let them heal up and get it done professionally. seriously, it'll be so much cleaner and just better. if you let the infection get too out of hand worse things can happen and the infection can spread around your whole body. i'm not even joking! so take them out and wait to get them done professionally! and maybe you should see a doctor if cleaning it doesn't help.|`|xMnN99T8aa	1)Take them out. 2)Wash and use Bacitracin a few times a day. If it gets worse, see a doctor. 3)Stop mutilating your body.|`|ATt2n32Saa	Im just throwin this out there but how about taking them out?.................and serious amount of peroxide|`|ZWsCHjIKaa	peirced your Hips?????? what the hell
BUI2nlUVaa	I don't really understand your question.  Normal means NO protein in the urine.  Having a low concentration can be normal...doctors usually have the cutoff at .9 and below as normal.  So, that being said do you have high protein in the urine?  Having this means your kidney's aren't functioning well and that could be  a sign of Lupus.  So to recap...LOW is GOOD, HIGH is BAD.  Good Luck to you.
rvoo4rBjaa	Nothing works better than a good diet and exercise. My friend did the appeal thing and got her bypass and lost the weight and is now back to almost her original weight because she didn't change her life style and exercise and expected the by pass to be the magic answer.|`|bCmqScVlaa	You must have health issues in order for insurance to cover bypass surgery.  They won't cover the cost nor would a doctor perform the surgery unless obesity was affecting your health.  Just not being able to lose some weight does not qualify a person for a bypass.  It has to be a much more serious problem than that.|`|cPRuJQ1Paa	I had my gastric bypass surgery through Forerunners Healthcare Consultants in India I don't regret it at all I had a baby since then and I'm still able to take the weight off so far i am very happy. The key is to use a reputable surgeon. You want to be carefully screened beforehand to make sure you are a good candidate. Since my surgery I can walk without getting tired, I can play with my son; I can walk down the street with my head held high. I feel pretty for the fist time in years. I was given another shot at life. The surgery is a tool and how well that tool works is up to you!!<br>  <br>  I would do it again in a heartbeat. I would recommend to every one who is suffering from the same problems as I did before but I would urge anyone who is interested to seek the best surgeon possible and make the decision based on the surgeon’s recommendations and your own personal goals!! Make sure the reasons for the surgery are the right one. The surgery isn't for someone who just "wants to be skinny". Do it for your health, for your life, for family. FOR YOU.<br>  <br>  You can checkout their website.<br>  <a href="http://www.forerunnershealthcare.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.forerunnershealthcare.com</a><br>  Hope this helps.|`|4eaf3b65b8bcd61e0c28ed377fb53935aa	if you don't have other health issues and aren't morbidly obese, they won't pay for it.  Sorry.  Diet and exercise or you have to pay for it yourself.
dcd11iUwaa	I wouldn't believe them hellaina<br>  you know your son better then anyone.<br>  personally i HATE the thought of putting children on medication and quite frankly i DONT believe in ADHD.|`|Bi7Zz74Baa	I was in the same boat with my son. BTW, the natural behavioral methods found in this article really helped him - with no meds. He is now well-behaved, gets straight A's, and my family has some peace and quiet. He's like a different kid, it's truly amazing!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hearts-and-kisses.com/attention-deficit-disorder.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hearts-and-kisses.com/attenti...</a>|`|fc1558ce0e3b1ca7711c74b1a6c9f385aa	Don't be so quick to jump at the chance to have your child diagnosed with ADD/ADHD. You don't want to put him on meds just to control his behavior that the school finds unacceptable. My son went to public school and was told by the teacher to put him on meds because he is ADD. I looked around and ended up having him tested for a private school, and one of their tests was for their vision. They told me that he may or may not have tracking issues, so I had him tested with a vision specialist who did diagnose him. The doctor told us that he could read but that it was difficult for him and would get him frustrated because he had a hard time focusing, etc. So when the teacher had the children read to themselves he would be wanting to avoid it as much as possible and do whatever it took to not have to read because it was difficult for him. He knew how to read, it's just that his eyes didn't work "normally". In the end, he has been in vision therapy for six months twice a week. He also wears glasses. Did this fix everything? No, but he is able to sit still and focus on his reading. He still has behavioral issues, but he has also matured and learns ways of dealing with these issues. <br>  My point is, if you are concerned do get him checked out. Get his hearing checked, get his vision checked. Take him to his pediatrician and find out where to get the tests done. His doctor should send some questionnaires to his teachers and to you to fill out regarding his behavior, and from that they help make the diagnosis.|`|fTbI4cnSaa	It would help to know where you live. In my part of the U.S. the school systems have psychologists who can do the testing or at least can refer you to private psychologists. With a diagnosis, the school should be willing to make accommodations if your son needs them. Your son's physician should be able to prescribe medication if that's what he needs. I don't think I really understand your question, though, because I don't see where hospitals enter into it.|`|va3Ysr8vaa	I wouldn't get him started on anything.  ADHD is not a disease or anything, it is just a term used to describe a child who is hyper or doesn't pay attention, it is his personality, don't take that away from him unless he really wants to be on drugs.|`|y2nC8BUGaa	I don't know about where you live but here the teachers can request it and guidance counselors can set it up.  My brother was tested in the school.|`|6ssFvhiMaa	Are you convinced that your child has ADHD? There are many signs and symptoms you can look for for yourself, can he watch an entire movie without losing control, or interrest? Can he control himself in a quiet setting with crayons, books, or games? Does he sleep in normal patterns? Are the methods of teaching above his head or just boring? If you child has something wrong you should know better than anyone. Forget waiting on a referral, call your insurance company and get a doctor that doesn't need to refer you to another doctor, most referrals are so hardto get done, speaking from experience!!|`|32713cbe56001fc024a3a2be5f7fbc1aaa	your question is contradicting. If the doctors diagnosed your son already, I don't understand why the testings and therapy has not started.<br>  <br>  Find a family doctor who you feel comfortable with and is willing to care for your son, not just any quack. <br>  <br>  Also, the drug market is pushing medication down everyone's throats because its big business, so I'm surprised the doctors are not jumping so quickly on testing your son.|`|OF7ZHq19aa	How old is your son?

Rk46lIBwaa	Cystitis is a bacterial infection. Women are most prone because of their anatomy, the urethra being relatively close to the anus.<br>  <br>  If episodes are recurrent and proven, full urological investigation is need to exclude underlying causes, rather than just repeated prescriptions for antibiotics.<br>  <br>  At best the effect of cranberry juice is fairly minimal, but a good fluid intake is advised.|`|BlA60kDVaa	The most common cause of cystitis is when bacteria, that usually live in the anus, enter the urethra and travel into the bladder.  Cystitis is extremely painful and uncomfortable.  <br>  <br>  Some people have expressed "sex" in their answers... cystitis generally has nothing to do with sex.<br>  <br>  Drink plenty of fresh clean water - several pints until you find yourself urinating often.  This will clean your system out.  Also, a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda added to warm water can help too.<br>  <br>  Men can get cystitis too.  I have had it a few times, and it is not nice.  <br>  <br>  Also, try and make sure you are regular going to the toilet (number 2's), and don't hold it in.  If you need to go, then GO.  Eat well, eat healthily and continue to drink plenty of clean filtered water, or boiled water cooled down.  <br>  <br>  Flush that bladder out!|`|AA10849898	Causes<br>  <br>   <br>  Your urinary system is composed of the kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra. All play a role in removing waste from your body. Your kidneys — a pair of bean-shaped organs located toward the back of your upper abdomen — filter waste from your blood and adjust the body composition of many substances. Tubes called ureters carry urine from your kidneys to the bladder, where it's stored until it exits your body through the urethra. <br>  <br>  Bacterial cystitis<br>  UTIs typically occur when bacteria enter the urinary tract through the urethra and begin to multiply. The urinary system is designed to keep out such microscopic invaders. The bladder secretes a protective coating that prevents bacteria from attaching to its wall. Urine also has antibacterial properties that inhibit the growth of bacteria. However, certain factors increase the chances that bacteria will take hold and multiply into a full-blown infection. <br>  <br>  Bacterial bladder infections may occur in women as a result of sexual intercourse. During sexual activity, bacteria may be introduced into the bladder through the urethra. But even sexually inactive girls and women are susceptible to lower urinary tract infections because the female genital area often harbors bacteria that can cause cystitis. <br>  <br>  Most cases of cystitis are caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli), a species of bacteria commonly found in the genital area. A new strain of antibiotic-resistant E. coli may be the cause of increasingly hard-to-treat UTIs in women.|`|L5tWiYOFaa	Main cause of 'cystitus' is poor spelling.

FVkRLl10aa	What you're feeling is normal, a lot of people are uneasy about going to someone for help. You should go to see her, because it is so important for you to be able to talk to someone who understands. Just be completely honest with her. When you do go to see her, explain to her why you feel awkward going to her for help again. And then explain that you are having problems again, and would really appreciate having someone to talk to about it. She is a guidance counselor, that is what she is there for.

APW85P3kaa	Lukewarm baths or showers are a good way to get rid of fever. If you can find the energy to get off the couch and get into the shower, you’ll be doing yourself a favor. Don’t make the shower to hot and don’t make the shower too cold. You want a lukewarm shower, something that doesn’t send you into chills, but isn’t scalding to the touch either. This is probably the most effective way to reduce an immediate fever because the water washing over such a large surface area serves to cool down the body more quickly than an icepack or a cool drink.|`|Lqy9Lc9Oaa	Yes it can.  But it has to be coolish, not hot.  A cool bath might work better.  Tylenol works too.|`|OBT3C4zHaa	I don't know how much it will help but I know it WILL help. Make sure the water isn't hot though, the colder it is the betetr. Also I figure it will only bring down the fever temporarily. You should be taking ibuprofen or something as well because those help reduce a fever.|`|QRCQJF6Faa	Not really, the reason you have a fever is normally because your body is fighting an infection, the fever actually helps since the infection can only live in a certain temp range, normally under 100 deg. so the boy raises the overall body temp and tries to kill the infection, if you reduce the fever then you make it tougher for your body to kill the infection. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps!<br>  Adam-O

rv2PHuNPaa	a good way to brign down your weight is runniogn though..... that usualy keeps its level or if your new to runnign it lowers it. sports are amazing for weight loss, they work you by doing cardio and building muscle groups which then burn fat. no pop or junk food as you knwo. and if your hungry eat yogurt or a fruit or vegitables. try nto to eat thigns with saturated ro trans fats. but also remember when you eat food, and your calori counting you ned to make sure your geting the right amout, for example most 16-19 yaer old men shoudl take in about 2000 calories, and if they are active 2600 or 2700, some men even have to eat 3000 it all depends on your matabalism and your activivty. when cuttign out those caloris make sure you ar still getting fat , becasue you need to eat fats it keeps yuor berain working as well as other things. dotn eat white bread or pasta, its really bad for you, eat whole grains.<br>  <br>  <br>  thats pritty mcuh it... soryy if im not helping, i hope i did. i have a lot fo problums with this kinda stuff, casue i lvoe to eat white bread and pasta... but i jog everynight for about 15 mins and it keeps my weight level.  ALSO REMEMBER DO NOT UNDER EAT.

EOqhhHghaa	It is one of life's most perilous decisions,what to do with our life.At your age it is perfectly normal to feel so conflicted and confused.When I was younger my parents kept on insisting i follow them into law,which I hated,all i could think of was medicine,but to keep my parents happy I made them think that I was gonna do what they wanted,and for nearly a year I devoted myself to the study of law.This depressed me terribly,I was so unhappy until I finally got my acceptance letter to medical school in Edinburgh,my advice to you is to do what makes you happy,even if other people tell you are wrong,and do not take to heart the insults,these people see in you something they wish they were,and so to hide this they attack.<br>  listen to the song 'Everyones free(to wear sunscreen) The advice given in that tune always kept me going<br>  <br>  Good luck for the future|`|S0Clu20aaa	Stick to it babe xxxxx time passes really quickly and before you know it you'll be a genius xxxx<br>  Go to the docs its such a help x x x <br>  Good Luck and take care of yourself x

ZbMLigR3aa	Hon, I can tell you straight away that definitely is not normal for a c-section!  I had one and also work in an active gynecology practice.  Your bleeding should have stopped after about 4 weeks or so.  You need to be seen immediately by either the ob/gyn you've been going to or at an urgent care center. Please do not put it off any longer.  Your uterus may not have properly shrunk back or there may be an adhesion remaining in your uterus from the afterbirth.  Either way, you need to have the cause of the bleeding located and treated.   I wish you luck.  Take care.|`|OwQsCR4Saa	If you can't go to the doctor.

The regulation occurs through effects of the EPA and DHA constituents on Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα). Besides cholesterol regulation, benefits include anti-inflammatory properties and positive effects on body composition. However, the preferred source of Omega 3 should be from the fish's body, not the liver. The liver and liver products (such as cod liver oil) of fish and many animals (such as seals and whales) contain Omega-3, but also the active form of Vitamin A. At high levels, this form of the vitamin can be dangerous. Early explorers to the land of the Inuit were given raw liver by the natives, which contained a toxic overdose of Vitamin A for the white explorers; however, the same amount was harmless to the Inuit, who had no other source of Vitamin A except animal livers."<br>  <br>  "Some studies[4] were conducted on prisoners in England where the inmates were fed seafood which contains Omega-3 Fatty acids. It was observed that the high consumption of these fatty acids led to a drop in the homicide rates. Another study was conducted in Finland where they found that prisoners who were convicted of violence had lower levels of Omega Three Fatty Acids than normal. It was suggested that these kinds of fatty acids are responsible for the neuronal growth of the frontal cortex of the brain which, it is further alleged, is the seat of personal behavior."<br>  <br>  And---<br>  <br>  How I read into the second link that fish oil will aide in wieght loss.

Puedes mojarte en el agua como si no te pasara nada porque nadie notará nada y al salir te notaras como siempre no mas mojada como pasa en el caso de la compresa... <br>  La unica dificultad que veo es que dicen que puedes coger infecciones si no lo cambias cada 8 horas como máximo pero si te cuidas no pasará nada.. suerte!!!!!!!

Maybe it will be easier for you if you do end up wanting to lose weight. But remember that it IS possible, and you will feel alot better about yourself!|`|9B3LirV3aa	Your maximum weight is 135 pounds. You should start exercising regularly to keep your body tone, don't worry so much about your weight because you are only 5lbs over. However be careful ok, you dont want to gain too much. Another thing you can do is eat every 2-3hour small meals everyday and do not eat anything after 7pm. Constantly eating food at a small portion will help speed up your metabolism. You are young so this should be really good for you without going to a major crazy diet. Oh try to cut down on sugar and carbs and you should be good.|`|AA11992494	I was 145 lbs at 17 and I wish I weighed that now. (198 lbs) But then you are shorter. I am 5'6". If you are wearing MED clothes, then you are not too big or too small for your age. You may feel big, but you are not. You are just about right, you are at a healthy weight.|`|AA11524469	There is no set weight for your height and age. A BMI is not always accurate because it does not take the amount of fat and muscle on your body into consideration, because muscle is more dense than fat (you could be 5'2" and weigh 150lbs, but have a lot of muscle). The important thing is that you feel good, and that you are healthy. If you are eating fairly healthy food, and staying active, trust me, you are A-OKAY, do not worry about your weight. And don't worry, it took me until I was a junior biochemistry student in college to figure this one out. Like I said, its not your weight that matters, it is your health.|`|Etd8Nvvaaa	You should be between 101-136 or that's what the calculator below says.

Also, I don't know what your eating habits are, but it certainly wouldn't hurt for me to tell you that portion is everything. Instead of eating a whole candy bar, eat half of one, hell, eat HALF of everything you eat and you will never have a weight problem.Drink 8 - 10 glasses of water a day, green tea is very good for your body as an antioxidant and help subtly speed up the metabolism. Salads (without fatty dressings and cheese) are very good for you, chicken is the king of meat in my opinion, as long as you don't fry it. Avoid fast food entirely, and walk anywhere you can as often as possible and get ahold of the 8-10 minute tae bo if you can. Drink diet sodas and juices (aka - cherry coke zero, sobe lean, crystal light, etc.) avoid sugar, switch to the 100 calorie snack packs, including popcorn. Eat apples, they are very filling! Cheese is an unecessary evil as well, so is milk, if you have to have it, drink the fat free kind. 100 calorie popcorn is a great snack. Eat turkey lunchmeat instead of a whole sandwich, etc. Eating is necessary, over eating is not. I also have a meal shake in place of a meal, I find it incredibly helpful at 3:00 in the afternoon.|`|95357efc3ba8d7fb66c1e91e89a10e05aa	Helpful Tips for weight loss:<br>  <br>  1)A good way to loose weight is to use a calorie counter watch<br>  <br>  Keep to a 1,200 food intake<br>  <br>  Add 1,200 plus 3,500 (equals one pound of fat) ...and that is the total amount of calories you need to burn each day. Its actually really easy once you start watching the numbers and it doesn't seem like work or exercise. Its just a matter of changing the way you think about loosing weight.<br>  <br>  I use this method when i gain some pounds. The first time I did this I went from 168 to 127<br>  <br>  2) Most people do not get enough water in their system. Water is your body's principal chemical component, comprising, on average, 60 percent of your weight. Every system in your body depends on water. For example, water flushes toxins out of vital organs, carries nutrients to your cells and provides a moist environment for ear, nose and throat tissues.<br>  <br>  Lack of water can lead to dehydration, a condition that occurs when you don't have enough water in your body to carry out normal functions. To determine if you are getting enough water use this simple formula..  Take your weight, for example 150 pounds and divide by 2. Take your answer which is 75 lbs and change it to ounces, in this case 75 ounces. That is how many ounces of water you need a day. Your body performs mostly on water. If you make sure you get enough water everyday your body will perform at top notch and your body will no longer have the cravings of junk food. You will have a better performing body system to help you work out and feel better thru out your day.|`|EEq7sgl1aa	try info on<br>  myfatloss4idiots dot com

What I know for sure from my research is that it is behavior such as what you are talking about (losing weight that fast) that can start a weight yo-yo cycle that lasts a lifetime in some cases. If you want to begin exploring your excess weight, instead ask yourself these questions....<br>  <br>  What triggers you to eat when you aren't hungry?<br>  Do you eat for emotional reasons? (sadness, happiness, stress, boredom, etc.)<br>  Do you binge eat?<br>  <br>  If you answered yes to any of the questions above, begin to explore how to create a more healthy relationship with your body and food.

By binge eating and then going without during the day, you are actually tricking your body into thinking it's starving so it RETAINS fat and calories for what food you do eat.  It is better to just eat small meals and snacks (healthy ones) through out the entire day.|`|Z4IEyPdYaa	People binge eat for all different reasons, but it usually compulsive and emotional in nature. Some binge to distract themselves from their problems, others when they are lonely, procrastinating, sad, scared, etc. <br>  <br>  There is no easy answer to your question, though. It is usually important to speak to an expert and get help from someone who is familiar with the issues involved in binge eating, if you are truly binge eating. <br>  <br>  Questions involved so that you know if you are binge eating or not.... Are you hiding your behavior from others? Do you consume large amounts of food in a short period of time? Do you feel out of control during these episodes? <br>  <br>  Regarding your question of how to make this stop and lose weight....The best way is to get some coaching or treatment around your eating problems. The way to eat so that you never have to worry about your weight is to get in touch with your body's own hunger and fullness cues. I am a personal coach for teens who want to lose weight and help teens figure out what causes them to overeat, binge eat, and how to change these patterns.

Usahakan kalori yang keluar > dari kalori yang masuk.<br>  <br>  Asupan gizi yang masuk harus seimbang. HINDARI:<br>  - Makan makanan yang mengandung Monosodium Glutamat (MSG), karena efek MSG itu memberi tahu otak bahwa kita belum kenyang padahal sudah.<br>  - Makanan yang mengandung "saturated fat" (lemak yang dipadatkan).. Biasanya makanan kemasan, snack, atau makanan siap saji yang dijual di supermarket, mengandung bahan ini. "saturated fat" memiliki efek yang sama dengan MSG<br>  - Junk food.. Definisi Junk food adalah makanan yang memiliki sangat sedikit kandungan gizi.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junk_food" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junk_food</a><br>  - Makanan atau MINUMAN yang mengandung banyak gula, soft-drink juga ga boleh. Susu juga yang harus low-fat, hi-cal.<br>  <br>  Ada lagi... Kalau ingin diet ketat makan malam paling lambat jam 6pm. Di atas jam tersebut, JANGAN ada makanan yang masuk.. hanya air putih saja.<br>  <br>  SANGAT DISARANKAN meminum hanya air putih dengan suhu diatas suhu ruangan ( >27 derajat celsius).

IwNPHtC6aa	It sounds like your blood sugar is going too low. My granny has Type II Diabetes and from time to time her blood sugar drops very low. She has the same symptoms as you and feels completely drained the next day. You need to see a doctor right away. If your blood sugar drops too low, you could go into a coma. It might even be your blood pressure dropping too low. I don't know what the symptoms of that would be, or the outcome if it goes too low, but either way, you really should get into the doctor's.

W9AtdDYCaa	You have a sleep disorder that has to do with terror and fear. It can be a real fear that is in your life, past or present, and wrecking havoc in your subconscious.

If you just scream in nightmares, it's probably your mind couldn't distinguish the nightmare is a dream and thought it's real.<br>  <br>  People who made speech/grumble/murmuring during sleep is due to lack of sleep.

ddzVqCK5aa	I have had acne on and off since I was 18.  I am now 30. One thing I have learned for sure from my research, and talking to dermatologists, is that food plays a very little role if any. <br>  <br>  Acne falls into two categories usually. Infection or hormonal.<br>  <br>  Drinking water may help to flush out toxins from your skin, but it will not cure acne. Avoiding oily food may help, but if your having a hormonally based acne this won't make a difference.<br>  <br>  If acne is severe or uncomfortable for more than a few months, you need to see a dermatologist. You may only need a few months of anti-biotics or perhaps a course of acne medication (which should only be for around 6 months). There are side-effects to both treatments. I myself took the anti-biotic. My acne went away after 6 weeks. My skin basically recovered from a long standing infection. I have had bad stints with my acne so medication has had to be taken. Usually my skin has brief periods and settles again. I think this is hormonal since I am a female, naturally I have the usual monthly pimple or two to deal with. <br>  <br>  My diet is very good. I get all my nutrients and liquids. I also exercise regularly as well. It has never affected my acne either way. <br>  <br>  Sorry, I think you were hoping for a more positive, easier solution. I know from experience how hard it is to deal with acne. It's gross and it can be embarrassing.<br>  <br>  If your acne is really bad do go see a professional. They can  probably isolate what typeof acne you have and treat it accordingly. They will also suggest a facial care regime which may help decrease outbreaks. <br>  <br>  Take care ;)|`|EDMqQQjSaa	Starting tomorrow I am going to completely cut myself off from pop and start drinking Gatorade, Kook-Aid, etc.  It's not what you should eat, it's what you should NOT eat.|`|27bae3cbde438e42dd03a5ac00838f0baa	Don't eat a lot of salty food and drink a lot of water.<br>  <br>  If you are looking for products then there are 3 best products in the market that are highly recommended : <br>  <br>  - <a href="http://www.recommended-products.info/acne_products" rel="nofollow">http://www.recommended-products.info/acn...</a><br>  - <a href="http://www.everythingthatyouneed.info/acne_reviews" rel="nofollow">http://www.everythingthatyouneed.info/ac...</a><br>  - <a href="http://www.reviews-for-you.info/acne" rel="nofollow">http://www.reviews-for-you.info/acne</a><br>  <br>  All the above are cheap and safe.<br>  <br>  In addition to those, you should try wash your face a few time a day.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|QUSJvIQZaa	Well the thing is its not so much what you eat but what type of skin you have.

P9XxUAjhaa	Laxative induce bowel movements.  They do not prevent the food from being processed, digested, absorbed, etc.  They can help you lose weight because you will basically get diarrhea.  This is not healthy for you.  There is a new product on the market called Alli.  Alli helps prevent fat from being digested.  It aids you to learn how to eat healthier.  The reason you learn to eat healthier is because then undigested fat is expelled through your digestive track.  In other words, if you eat a high fat diet then you will have oily bowel movements.  So to prevent that, you start to eat low fat/calorie foods.  Not only do you gradually lose weight (within 1-2 weeks you will notive you drop 3-5 pounds) but you will feel better, too.  You can get this at most drug stores.  It is kind of expensive.  But it does work.  If stopping your body from absorbing fat is your goal, try this instead of laxitives...|`|AA10790287	That is correct.  You do not get many calories absorbed in the colon, it happens in the small intestine.  Laxatives will not have a significant effect on the caloric absorption.|`|CPcYVMJvaa	Not sure why laxatives would affect calories.  The purpose of laxatives has nothing to do with your body's function of using food for energy!|`|d07883ba1560bd9abbc7f79e6d024f32aa	Wrong.  Laxatives help move your digested food in the large intestines.  Calories are absorbed in your small intestine.  Its too late.
NcmDOwlraa	Uhm, if it hurts when you run, maybe you shouldn't run..;) just kidding.  There are a couple different causes of those side aches.  The first thing to do is make sure you are drinking enough water.  Cramping can be the first symptom of heat exhaustion, which isn't fun.  So make sure you are getting enough water.  If that's not the problem, a couple other things it could be are: lack of proper warm ups, too much or too little to eat before the workout, or improper breathing.  For breathing, just make sure you are taking deep enough breaths, some people have a tendency to breath to shallow, and during exercises, that will cause side aches.  If that happens, take some deep breaths, and that should help clear the pain.  Anyway, good luck.|`|8253606e962dc30046c3b40e0678936aaa	Build up your endurance slowly, stay hydrated, and don't eat too much before exercising

zUVhmCvSaa	If you DO NOT have access to a gym or fitness club, I would suggest doing leg lifts....lay on your side and rest your head on whatever side arm that is flat against the floor.  bend your top leg and cross it over your leg laying against the floor.  Keep your leg that is flat against the floor STRAIGHT, and lift it about 6 inches off the ground (make sure you keep your toe flexed, not pointed!).  Then slowly lower your leg to the ground....your body will naturally use gravity as resistance.   I would do 12-15 reps then switch sides and repeat it on the opposite side.  This one's easy to do in the comfort of your home....even while watching TV.  j<br>  <br>  If you DO belong to a gym or fitness club, I would check out the hip/leg abductor/adductor machine.  It tones both the outside of your thighs and the inside (groin) area, depending on which way you use it.  you can either set it so you start with your legs together bent at a 90 degree angle and you push outwards to spread your legs (that works the outside of your thighs) or you can set it so that you begin with your legs spread apart and you squeeze your legs from the out-to-the-sides open position to the right-in-front-of-you-closed position (which works your groin muscle/inner thigh muscle).   <br>  <br>  <br>  I understand your aggravation with the groin area b/c i'm a runner and no matter what I do or how much weight I lose, my thighs always touch....my inner thighs must be my fat reserve or something, it's frustrating!  good luck :)

rzqbnC0baa	K, i will give you a simple explanation... your body is obviously the type that can gain fat VERY FAST... but that is a good thing because you can lose it fast too, you can also gain muscle and so on.<br>  <br>  Solution: <br>  Since you have gained a couple of fat pounds and you can not keep up with you training, that means you need to start from level 1, which means start by walking, speed walking, biking then back into jogging. Now since you say you can not do your excersise because of the pounds you gained.... that is not true because i believe that since you gained the weight you cut down on food, but then you are forgetting that food is energy so you cant really cut down on it, but you can eat 30 minutes before your workout and then let it rip, hopefully that will give you enough energy.<br>  <br>  If you need the help of "Diet Pills" i can help you with that but i recommend that you try to go natural first.<br>  <br>  Let me know how it goes :)<br>  Riz|`|eBBrKJdgaa	I just started taking Flaxseed Oil because after reading up on it i found thats it's used for a  myriad of  things and if you do a bit of research you will want to give it a shot for all of the other benefits it provides, from Cancer prevention to Parkinsons disease and Alzheimers.  It has healing properties that aid to heal muscles after workouts and is good for the immune system.  Too many to name.  <br>  <br>    <br>  We want to familiarize you with flax seed oil. It is extracted from the flax seed grain and has been used for centuries. The strange thing about flax seed oil weight loss is that it occurs because of the presence of two fatty acids within the oil known as Linolenic (Omega 3) and Linoleic (Omega 6). It may be weird to ponder the possibilities of fatty acid helping to promote weight loss but when these two substances combine, they become key in the process of calorie burning. This is because they combine to become prostaglandins, which help with weight loss and also provide other benefits such as moderating cholesterol, body temperature, the immune system, brain functions, and the cardiovascular system.<br>  <br>  Get enough Omega 3 and feel the difference<br>  <br>  The problem with most diets is that they don’t get enough Omega 3 in their diet along with the Omega 6 to produce a lot of prostaglandins. The ratio should be one Omega 3 for every two Omega 6, but instead is usually one for every twenty in typical diets. Make sure that you are getting enough Omega 3, add flax seed oil to your diet and notice the change in your body and brain.<br>  <br>  Article Source: <a href="http://www.ArticleJoe.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.ArticleJoe.com</a>

To get crowns or veneers, they will have to remove part of your existing teeth so once you get this done, there's no going back to your real teeth.  Gold crowns will cost a fortune but last 15-20 years if you don't bite on hard things that may damage them.  Because they would be covering your existing teeth, you may feel more sensation (not always pleasant) when you take a bit of things or when you eat cold or hot things.  They also sometimes come unglued from your tooth and you'll have to get the dentist to reglue them.  Since it's a covering over existing teeth which have been compromised (to allow the crowns to be applied, the existing teeth need to be reduced and scuffed up) you can still get decay in your teeth which sometimes festers before it is discovered (and which could lead to serious excavation).  And crowns have to be replaced eventually because they wear out, develop holes in them, crumple completely, etc. so you'd have to pay again for new ones (and go through the whole replacement stuff).<br>  Veneers also entail a certain amount of tooth removal.  They also can crack or chip and have to be replaced after about 5 years or so.  Since they'd be front teeth, you'd have to be very careful about eating anything crusty or hard.  Since your natural teeth will have been messed with, you may become sensitive to hot and cold foods/drink, may find biting down on hard things like crusty bread hurts, etc.<br>  <br>  Do you need absolutely perfect teeth enough to set yourself up for a lifetime of extra tooth maintenance?  Can the dentist do a teeth whitening ultraviolet thing on your teeth to brighten them up instead?  Yea, your dentist is looking to make money and using your vanity to do it--so it's up to you.

Nice white teeth and great smile are worth the $$$$|`|ynA1X0yZaa	At the very least, get the crowns on the teeth that have the root canals. This is very important since a tooth that has had a root canal will get brittle and possibly break to the point where you have to get it pulled. I know because this happened to me and I ended up having to get an dental implant in place of the tooth. It is more cost prohibitive and healthier to just get the crowns on. As for the veneers, you have to weigh the costs vs. the lifetime of the veneers. Some veneers need to be replaced in 10 or so years. Ask you dentist for a detailed account of treatment plan and cost, if and when he estimates you would need to have the veneers replaced, etc. This way you can make a clear, informed decision. Best of luck!!

OK4hnXTfaa	CONGRATULATIONS... You are finally getting the help you need.  I was getting worried about you. (now you just have to get better :))<br>  <br>  Firstly, listen to your nutritionist, don't keep coming on Yahoo to ask these important questions.  This is your body we are taling about.  If you really want to know, start writing questions down (that you want to ask) and give them to your nutritionist, doctor and parents.  That way they understands your concerns and will be able to help you better, as you will be getting educated answers. (Maybe you should print out all the questions you have asked and then get the expert to answer!!!)<br>  <br>  Now as you are only 13 and your body is still growing and developing.  This is why you need full fat foods. <br>  There are all different kinds of fats and your body needs them to function. (Otherwise it needs to compensate for the lack of them and starts eating itself and shutting down... as you would now know!)<br>  <br>  Nobody knows your history which is why you have gotten the answers you have received. (By the way.. French toast is a really healthy breakfast or snack... and even yummy with thick bread as it tastes so fluffy!)  - Bacon & Egg muffins (Homemade) are really yummy and are also good for you.<br>  <br>  The answers you got are for those who are giving "weightloss tips".  This is great if you have weight to lose, but as you know (Thankfully) that you do not need to lose weight.<br>  <br>  Milk also has good fat in it plus lots of calcium & protein (Which you need for your bones, muscles, teeth, hair nails and skin)  Low fat syrups and sugars can actually be bad for you, not so much in the immediate time frame, but later on in the future!)<br>  <br>  You need protein in your diet as well as carbs, fats, fibre. (The best type of fibre is from cereals, fruit & breads).<br>  <br>  There is no such thing as bad food!! (Everything is good in moderation).<br>  <br>  But please listen to your nutritionist and get better!|`|P9XxUAjhaa	The answer to all of your "how comes" is that you have been diagnosed with anorexia.  That means you are malnurished and TOO THIN.  Your body needs the extra nutrients.  2% milk is better for you because you need the extra 1% of fat.  Egg yolk IS the most mutritious part of the egg.  People say only eat the white when they want to lose weight.  You don't.  French toast, what she said is RIGHT!  Yes, peanut butter is fatty, but you need some fat and it's HEALTHY fat.  It's also a great source of protein, which your muscles NEED.<br>  <br>  Listen to her.  Some of these things should not be set into your long long diet.  But what she is doing is getting you healthy again.  You don't want to die do you?  Your body needs a certain level of fat.  <br>  <br>  Your hair will start to fall out, you will have vision problems, your bones will be thin and start to break, you will have no energy, your body will start to consume your muscle and eventually be eating itself completely.  And then ultimatley you will die.  So take this very serious.  <br>  <br>  Like a lot of girls, I also feel the pressure of being thin and looking good.  But let me tell you something, being a skeleton is not cute, nor is it anywhere close to healthy.  Get yourself healthy, and THEN question what you are suggested to eat.|`|dGwaXsieaa	If you were diagnosed with anorexia she is probably trying to get you to gain some weight and put some fat back into your body. Having some fat in your body is good for you. I believe in everything in moderation. As long as you aren't eating a whole pound of bacon or drenching 10 peices of french toast in syrup, you are going to be fine. Getting as much fruits and vegetables in your diet is also important because of their nutruients that they lend to your body. I think you should listen to your nutritionist, she is a professional and is trained to teach people what to eat and she knows how to make your body its healthiest.|`|XwVy0VHKaa	Ew..GAG That sounds like the worst diet plan to make you GAIN weight..Ew just ew.

BUT, young children and young teenagers are still growing.  Your muscles and bones are still developing.  It's not a good idea to work out at an adult level in these age groups.  There are the same benefits for children to strength train as there are for adults.  BUT, children experience more wrist and spine problems due to poor technique more than anything.  Also, athletic kids really REALLY need to know the importance of supplementing.  Magesium and potasium are critical for children to replenish themselves with.

gH63UduTaa	I agree with Robinstarlyn.  I have bumps on my labia too, but they are just a normal part of me.  You can't really see the bumps, but if you rub them between two fingers, you can feel them.  If this is the first time that you have noticed these bumps, but they do not hurt or are not painful, I would just wait.  You will probably have them all of your life as they are just part of your body.<br>  <br>  If you didn't have bumps, and now all of the sudden, you do have bumps, it can be a cause for concern.  If the bumps itch, cause pain, have puss or get larger, seek out the advice of a doctor.<br>  <br>  If you are young and don't want your parents to know, you can often get confidential women's health care through a health department.  They can give you a pap smear and a full check up and check for STDs.  They will often do this for free and because of confidentiality laws, they can not tell your parents.|`|P9XxUAjhaa	Tiny bumps (similar to the ones around your nipples?) are just your pores.

BFMGCnyjaa	I'm not sure. I guess according to all their testing, that's the best amount of fat to eat with their diet. Either way if you are thinking about Alli, don't take it. I've heard some horror stories about it. None of those pill/easy weight loss diets are good. Question: Do you want to carry around a pair of pants each day if you accidentally consume too much fat. Or have oily stool. I don't think so.|`|AA11815208	Ive done Alli. You need to try to eat less fat. I know it makes no sense what they say. But eat less than 30 grams a day. Write it down. Everything you eat. If you eat something with no fat dont waste time taking the pill. The pill makes the fat not turn into pounds. Thats why you gotta watch how much fat you intake.|`|P9XxUAjhaa	UGH, the new trend Alli...  It should be called "watch out here comes the *** blast".  I think the point they are trying to make is that if you exceed a certain amount of fat in a meal you better stay on the pot.  Also, if you get anything greasy... chips, pizza ANYTHING it leaks.  And I don't mean you get the feeling of having to go poo.  I mean you feel nothing and it just comes out.  You could be at the mall shopping and then all of of sudden it's in your pants.  And by "it" I mean what looks like the orange grease off the top of a lasagne.  It even "smells" like petroleum.  It's quite nasty.  If you simply don't eat the greasy fat in the first place then you don't have to worry about blocking the absorbtion of it.|`|wGB2RUvAaa	READ THE FINE PRINT>>>> <br>  Some of my friends have used it and they tell me you never want  to go over the limit because it blocks fat intake.. so all those extra grams of fat that you don't use come out as "anal leakage" or the runs... not very pleasant. The packaging even tells you that when you begin to take it to carry an extra pair of pants and avoid light colored pants because of the unexpected anal fluids that may secrete. Just exercise and eat right.

No more fatty or salty foods. Esp with butter and other dressings.<br>  Start eating fruits, veggies, rice, fish, small amounts of meat. Because you change your eating doesnt mean you cant eat things you ate before, just have a limit. Just no chips, soda, or junkie things.<br>  Now, work out, sure it'll be tiring at the start but keep trying no what matter. Youll get tired in the start, but keep working out. Start with running, sit ups, push ups. Work out every other day and make sure not to slack off, if you do you wont get anywhere and will gain the weight. If you're not sweating after your work out then keep working out.|`|9B3LirV3aa	<a href="http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/bmicalc.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/bmicalc....</a><br>  <br>  Check out this site, it tells your Body mass index (BMI). This should help a little. First of all how much weight are you planning to lose? Here is a little bit of reading to help you out.<br>  <br>  Ten Changes You Can Make to Lose Weight<br>  * Appetizer reading Ten Simple Healthy Eating Habits.<br>  <br>     1. Set realistic goals - You didn't put on extra weight overnight so it is equally unrealistic to take it off quickly. Record a goal that you can reach in one month that is 4 to 8 pounds less than you weigh now. Set a goal you know you can achieve.<br>  <br>     2. Spread your calories around - Divide your calorie goal by the number of meals (at least three) so that you eat about the same amount of calories at each meal. If meals are more than 500 calories, save some calories for snacks between meals. Make sure you eat at least 1200 calories each day or you will lose muscle.<br>  <br>     3. Diet foods not required - Eat regular foods rather than the "sugar free", "lite" or "fat free" versions (except soda beverages and milk) because the calories in these "diet" foods still count towards your total calories each day. Diet foods are usually not as satisfying or filling so you may eat more of them. Drink fat free or skim milk so you can add some fat at meals. If you only drink 1% milk, then cut added fat in half at meals. If you drink 2% (low fat) milk, then don't add any fat to food at meals. Eat the basic food groups at meals - lean meat, legumes, dairy, fruits and vegetables. Then add one or two servings of grains or starches each meal to reach your calorie goal. Include 8 ounces of milk and one serving of grains, fruits and vegetables at each meal to provide carbohydrate fuel for your brain and muscles. You need at least 100 grams of carbohydrate each day.<br>  <br>     4. Drastic changes not recommended - The plan you follow to lose weight should be built on the how you eat now modified by these ten changes. A weight loss plan should be a plan you can follow for a lifetime by making small changes in the portion sizes you eat once you reach your goal weight so that you can maintain a healthy weight. Try the Healthy Body Calculator to calculate your basal calorie (don't include activity) needs at your current weight and your goal weight. There may be as little as a 5 calorie increase for each pound of body weight you gain over your goal weight.<br>  <br>     5. Portion control - Control meal portions to a piece of lean meat as big as the back of your hand from your knuckles to where your wrist bends and as thick as your little finger or about the size of a deck of cards. Other foods like grains, vegetables and fruits can be portioned to 2 heaping serving tablespoons or approximately ? cup each per meal. Measure how many ounces are in your beverage glass or mug so that you pour 4 or 8 ounces portions.<br>  <br>     6. Cook it yourself - Bake, broil or steam food rather than frying. Consider cooking from scratch more often so you know what is in the food you eat.<br>  <br>     7. Some fat is OK - Limit added fat to 1 teaspoon (margarine or mayonnaise or oil) or 1 tablespoon of salad dressing per meal if this doesn't exceed your calorie goal. You can choose to put margarine on your potato or salad dressing on your salad, but not both. To limit salad dressing and make it go farther, serve your salad dressing on the side of your salad and then dip your fork in the dressing before spearing your salad for each mouthful.<br>  <br>     8. Sugar is not evil - You just can't afford the calories. Sugar only contains carbohydrate so use an artificial sweetener in beverages or drink sugar free soda in reasonable amounts.<br>  <br>     9. Alcohol in moderation - Alcoholic beverages are just as empty of nutrients as sugar, but your liver processes them like fat. If you drink, limit yourself to one drink per day (12 ounce beer or 4 ounces wine or 1 ? ounces distilled liquor) and then only add fat to one meal that day.<br>  <br>    10. Have your cake too? - Probably not. Desserts are mostly fat and sugar which will put you over your calorie goal for the day.|`|39hANbLOaa	Now if only we all knew that.....

And you also can't lose weight fast.. unless you starve yourself, but that will kill you. so don't do that. <br>  <br>  Use the free weights at a gym to build muscle tone and become leaner in appearance. <br>  <br>  Cardio workouts like biking or a treadmill will also help drop down the fat on your body. <br>  <br>  Also, eating healthy is a huge part of losing/maintaining weight: whole grains, good rich in fiber, cut back on sweets and fats, lots of water, tea, etc. <br>  <br>  Over time you will see a difference, but don't get upset when you can't see results right away.

Such as implantation bleeding.  |`|X8W6VSn7aa	if u don't know the answer to that question then you shouldn't be having sex|`|yMngradraa	if she had her period than no. but there are some rare cases of girls still being pregnant and having their periods.

hDDWCvO2aa	That is not a good answer to your problem.  You might be depressed and feel like no matter what you will never feel better or normal again, but thats not the case.  I've been in a similar position and it really is horrible to have feelings like that, but no matter what, killing yourself is not the answer.  If you need to talk let me know, I can relate.  But on another note, no... theres not really a pill that you could take to kill you without pain.  Nothing that you could get your hands on at least, that would be a doctors decision.

meCs1r28aa	Healing is a process...  Each cell involved takes it turn to do it's job.  The body can't lay down new healthy tissue until the dead or damaged cells are gone.   To increase the process as much as possible you need to make sure you are eating well and that you are keep it free from infection.
Puygvee8aa	I'm similar to you. I do that too when I'm out...and the same thing happened to me once (I've been on the pill for 5 years, it happened last month.)<br>  <br>  If you miss a pill you are supposed to take 2 the next time, so you did that right.<br>  <br>  My period came on time however. But the hormone fluctuation could have thrown you off a bit, and you might be late.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Edit: I understand what you mean. I missed mine on Tuesday and didn't realize until Thursday when I took 2 as well.|`|oThixZeBaa	Well, you get your period during the period week because your hormone levels dip - a consequence of not putting hormones into your body for a week. You put a double dose of hormones into your body near the end (maybe even the last day), and thus it makes sense that it might take a little longer for your hormone levels to dip enough for your period to start. <br>  <br>  That's my theory, at any rate. Another possible theory, if you are sexually active, is that you might have gotten pregnant because you missed the pill. Chances of that are low, however. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|08f62bcea9760db43a4e3e8ac9977144aa	this is fine but dont double up just go along and throw the other pill down the toilet and just remember to take your other pills|`|2zLzixEpaa	You did the right thing.  If you miss just one pill, you're supposed to double up the next day but if you miss more than one, then you continue with the pills but you can't consider yourself "safe" for the rest of the month.  You'd have to use backup protection.  As far as your period, it may have messed up your cycle a little.  It'll probably show up soon.
KILFoc6kaa	I make mine about a weeks at a time, they seem to do okay for me, I keep them in tightly sealed containers made for taking drinks on the go.

And dont be alarmed if your ears hurt as badly as your throat. thats not an ear infection, its called referred pain. the nerves from your throat travel by the ear on the way to the brain and so pain in the throat is felt in the ears.

nmesOEZTaa	there are rainbows coming out of everyone's mouth for like 3 days....
df05aeac639e6449ab9b85b9769cbe25aa	yes that's right. the most important thing when it comes to just losing weight is that you don't eat much and it doesn't add up to more calories than you can burn off in a day. i have lost weight eating goldfish crackers and chocolate and gained it eating (too much of) salads, broccoli, and apples.<br>  at the same time, it's not HEALTHY. i mean yeah you can lose weight eating nothing but hamburgers and fries as long as you don't over-do it, but your heart won't be happy about it after a while, so it's really not a good idea. if you eat few calories and they're made up of fresh fruits and vegetables, legumes, and whole grains, you will not only lose weight but have energy and a pleasant mood kind of like the pleasant mood exercise can give, on a regular basis.<br>  so basically yes you can lose weight eating junk, but it will do your body more favors to eat healthy foods instead. |`|1469145fbc54553729532a83a0ba1985aa	Okay, let's start with the basics:<br>  <br>  - Yes, other nutrition info is important, BUT start with calories and work your weight up.<br>  - If you're a girl, don't eat under 1400 calories, especially if you're under the age of 22.<br>  - If you're a boy, stick above 1500. <br>  <br>  First off, don't get into the whole burning calories to get a negative calorie. Not how it works. <br>  <br>  Your body needs calories to survive. So let's say you weight 180 pounds and want to drop to 160. That's 20 pounds. Let's say you're also eating 2500 calories each day. Cut that down to 1800 calories, and you have a net loss ALREADY of 700 calories. Do that each day for 7 days, and you're up to 4900 calories that you haven't consumed. That's over a pound you've just lost!<br>  <br>  Now, exercise is tricky. You'll build muscle, meaning you'll gain weight, but you'll lose fat. It's better, but don't think that just because you're gaining weight that it's bad.<br>  <br>  Also with exercise, don't do the whole calorie subtract method. You know - I ate 1400 calories today and I burned 1500. <br>  <br>  1) Not healthy - you're going to not learn the new lifestyle<br>  2) You'll start making substitutions - "Well, since I burned 700 calories, it's okay to have that second piece of pie..."<br>  3) You don't really get into exercise. Enjoy exercise, don't be so consumed with how many calories you just lost <br>  <br>  Also, don't eat your calories like you have today. The biggest meal should be at the beginning, for breakfast. Unless you plan to work out at night, you don't need 700 calories before bed.|`|AA11238703	yes, even if you eat junk, if your calories are under 1400 then you will lose.  but there are other bad consequences, like your body doesn't get the nutrition it needs.  most people underestimate their serving sizes and stuff so make sure to weigh/measure things.  you should have at least 15% of your calories from oil/fat or it will be harder to lose.  |`|2223829f0df37d8b96ea030121c582b2aa	The whole eating a burger tonight thing would make you gain a little bit of weight overnight, but you're right--if you were to only eat junk but in small amounts, you would lose weight.  I don't eat total junk but I don't exactly eat the healthiest, and I've lost quite a bit of weight.  I don't recommend it though.|`|G67ceHtTaa	Yes, you'll still lose. If someone wanted, they could basically eat nothing but chocolate and still lose ... so long as they didn't eat over their calorie allowance.
3Phjz0NMaa	Are you SURE your mouth taste like tobacco and you're just not brushing your teeth well enough? Maybe you're getting sick or something, I'm not a doctor.<br>  Perhaps you should end this suspicion and take a drag on a *** so you actually know how smoke tastes, eh?|`|SU8z0TUoaa	It is probably all in your mind, which apparently wants you to smoke. Give it a try. Odds are, it will taste different than what you imagine, and the problem will go away.|`|0vxGLc1Baa	maybe someone around you is smoking or there's lots of fires? i don't' know, i'm not psychic. |`|cCA1hULWaa	if enyone around u or family smoks u could be breathing in the smoke from the cigeret
XfbMcu6Caa	taking it before is always good.<br>  but after your workout it depends if its a pure protein and digests fast (like whey protein) with fast carbs (ie sugar). if it does digest fast then yes take it after your workout it would be very important to. if its a slow digesting protein formula then you can still take it after but it wont be as good as a fast digesting supplement.<br>  <br>  either way you could just take it before and after. wont hurt.|`|mQiDJwzbaa	eat a little before and alot after|`|rHF8tPbyaa	After-<br>  just eat protein after you get home from the gym (be sure to do your cooldown)-I'd say about 15-20 min after a workout.
AA10642429	Wow you are on your way! Try Yoga, it's more difficult to do then you think. You will work up a sweat, and it tones your body. It makes you more flexible and stronger. Also, a lots lots of water, always have a water bottle filled with you, see the celebrities on TV with water bottles?  Jogging is good for your heart but to shape up you need weight training! Madonna stay young by doing weight, although she got too muscular by over doing it.  Weight lifting has two types, first, gain muscle mass, second, toning! You should do 2.5 lbs to 10lbs weights, do about 4-5 sets at 10 reps each for three major muscle groups twice a week. So arms, back and chest one day, then butt, legs and shoulder another day. In one to two months you will see HUGE difference that jogging will not give you! To get started buy a women's exercise mag, read up all about weight training or you can easily find training material on the net. Don't worry about you become a femal body builder, people tend to think the minute they touch weights they will become a big muscle person, that's not the case. The fact is muscle takes a long time to build up, toning is much faster through proper weight lifting. Remember less weight more reps equals toning, more weight few reps equal muscle mass gain. Good luck!|`|d8TynQqgaa	Go to the gym and do light weights and more reps. Or you can do resistance training.
f3309a0e8d010cddebf66ca3b7b4881caa	You can work out more than 4 days a week, if you don't work too hard each session! Make sure you work out right = inner and outer muscles + front and backside of body. If you pump up your outer muscles without building up the inner, you can get problems with joints and injuries. Variation is always good; that's why top athletes do it. Ex. try some other classes/sports. Pilate's or climbing is good for inner muscles!
f3309a0e8d010cddebf66ca3b7b4881caa	Maybe bring the box of herbs and ask as you take the test?|`|JiKSdkzmaa	It shouldnt because their herbal remedies and dont contain chemical supliments inside them.|`|aKvOWtP2aa	Thats why its called natural remedys because its legal and good for you. It will not fluke a drug test I do not believe.  Now the zoloft is a prescribed drug, depending on what they are checking on it would show up possbily.  You just need to take your meds with you.
y2xp1S5Paa	Drink plenty of water, watch what you eat and how much. And just try to workout 5-6 days a week and I am sure you will see results in no time! Good luck!|`|b6a91a707fec429b7c881c99de030a66aa	Tony Little has a few videos that proclaims to see results in 4wks (I've done the old hips, buttocks & thighs and definitely felt if not saw improvement).  Take out sodas, salty foods, high in fat foods (for bloating).  You can try Vaseline (or lotion) & wrap the areas that are snug in your dress in plastic wrap to help you sweat/draw water weight, but don't do this too much.  Drink lots of water before then to help you not retain.  I'd definitely do some cardio w/ toning (Taibo, kickboxing, step aerobics, etc) to help tone.  Don't expect a huge improvement, but definitely at least be able to feel toned & better posture, etc. for the event!  Have fun!
K2wW5iShaa	Well, I dont know what you look like. But, thats not a whole lot. like you said, you probably dont need to lose a whole lot, but just like 5 or 10. if you want. to lose it....<br>  eat breakfast EVERYDAY. something filling like oatmeal. so that way you wont be hungry til lunch. and at lunch maybe eat a salad or something. im assuming you go to school because your 15, so when you get home, do exercises. maybe, if you have tapes or dvds, do them. or maybe ride a bike, or do some stuff like stretching and crunches just stuff like that. Im doing exercise tapes right now. if you would like to know about it, look at the sources. you probably dont need it, but check it out anyways.

I have a BMI of 26, Which is a little bit over weight. I am not fat, by a long shot. I get guys, and I love it! I just have heavy bones and curves.  (doc informed me)You are 5,3 and 133? Your BMI (body mass index) is 23.6: NORMAL!!! Look, look up on google BMI calculators. This is the chart:<br>  <br>  Underweight = <18.5 <br>  Normal weight = 18.5-24.9 <br>  Overweight = 25-29.9 <br>  Obesity = BMI of 30 or greater <br>  <br>  So look, Don't sweat it. It also depends on your body structure. Your probrobly fine. Those Jamacian guys probrobly will like you. XD But if you are really worried, just eat normally (Loads of Veggies, No really large fat intakes, Cut back on sugar/soda and read nutrition facts) and Excersize normally (loads of cardio, or the gym. If you can't hit the gym, just do fun sports with your friends.) And for Jamaca, BTW: Making out for an hour burns 250 Calories. XD Just be healthy, And see a nutrition if you are really concerned. :) and be happy with your body.|`|b6a91a707fec429b7c881c99de030a66aa	At 15??  Depends on your body structure, not the number on the scale.  If you can play easily, you're doing pretty good!  It's easy to gain some extra weight during puberty, highschool, college.  You're learning to be independent, which also means making good food & exercise choices.<br>  <br>  It also depends on your parents.  I felt I was being monitored to make sure I ate a full plate - not always healthy.  Just make sure your carbs (spagetti, casseroles, etc) are a smaller portion than your veggies.  Eat your greens, choose grilled over fried, watch your breakfast foods, rainbow of fruits/veggies, etc.  Limit sodas too.  I started using the children's plates instead of reg.size.  <br>  <br>  Other than that (things your parents should be okay with), trying renting a dance video & copy the moves.  Turn up the music & just start dancing.  It'll boost your self esteem & get you active.  Focus on stretching your muscles which is low impact, but helps you feel better.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|8417b60581517d04306be895b36b1bb9aa	You are carrying a little extra baggage.

AA11599015	Don't use ice, that damages the skin more.  <br>  <br>  From personal experience, I just keep my finger in cold water and suck it up, the pain will go away eventually.<br>  <br>  You could use aloe vera too like all those other people have suggested.  <br>  <br>  Look for a cream or lotion with lidocaine, it'll numb your skin a bit to take some of the pain away.  Its used for oral pains, sunburn relief, and i bet it'd work with a burn.|`|TBf8WFfeaa	apply burn cream or aloe vera  or zinc oxide. if you have sunburn medicine it will help, just no butter or ice the ice damages the tissues.

They'll probably have an ointment you can put on it.|`|7vY5fCsDaa	<br>  <br>  I suggest you stop putting salted butter on your finger.  Keep the area clean.  Place a very thin layer of neosporin or triple antibiotic ointment on the area and cover loosely with a 1" gauze wrap or bandaid. Change at least once a day.  Maybe twice. If you have an allergy to the antibiotic ointments then skip that part.  First Aid cream would work.  If the area shows any sign of infection (severe redness, drainage, extremely swollen, increased pain, doesn't show signs of improving) please see your doctor. A burn takes a while to heal, will feel sore for a while and may leave scarring when it has fully healed.|`|TNymma0xaa	I burned myself too =[ I used some TAO (Triple antibiotic ointment) and it worked pretty well. I am able to use it for typing now. I was putting a piece of ice in a paper towel and keeping it on that, but it wasn't helping because every time I took my finger off, it started hurting again. I heard that Shea Butter is also supposed to work?|`|gvPnxGrDaa	depending how bad the burn is, you should put a light gauze wrap around the burn protecting it from infection. every 30 mins to an hour wash and change the gauze. if it hurts take some tylenol or advil. also call your doctor if you have the chance and ask them anything they can do. ice is not always the best remedy for a burnt finger, because the temperature change is to fast. also try taking a nice hot bath but have a bucket of cool water for your finger. then you can relax and look after your firnger! salt will burn ur hand|`|5ocCUojWaa	colgate toothpaste always works for burns |`|XEiIYjT7aa	You aren't supposed to put food on it.

1YdeUn1Caa	Just let her be. So she coughs. Would you mind if people kept coming up to you, because you sneezed, or coughed a few times? My guess is it would. So just leave her alone. It's just coughing. It's not a natural disaster. |`|OocDN5evaa	It depends. If her actual smoking is bothering you (she comes in from a break and the smoke overwhelms you, she smokes in places she shouldn't be, ect) then yes - you need to do something about it. I would suggest going above her head and going to HR. I'm not trying to generalize, but many smokers are kinda offended when they're "picked on" directly. We already have so many laws that restrict them, that they don't want any more of their rights taken away.<br>  <br>  Now, if it's her coughing, then I would just go to her and say something casually. Ask her if she's sick. Or during one of her coughing spells ask her if she's okay. Let her know that it's bothering you (the cough complaint would offend her less than a smoking one - so it would be better to go to her about it). Act like you think she's coughing because she's sick and say in a friendly tone, "Wow - maybe you should get that checked out." If all else fails on that, well, you need to go to HR. This problem isn't worth losing your job over! |`|xIau7dloaa	You may need to gently bring to to her attention at first.  Just say something like "It's sounds like you're getting a bad cold".  Then she may admit that she needs to do something about the coughing because others are noticing it.  If this doesn't help, sit an abby note on her chair or desk letter her know that she needs to fix this problem.  If this doesn't work, you and some co-workers may try telling the manager about hygenic concerns.  The manager then may either call a meeting to address these issues to everyone without singling out the coughing employee or contact her alone to discuss.  At that point, she will have no choice but to do something about it to save her job.
UZJ7wVc8aa	If you want to lose weight, you need to two things: eat less and exercise more. Weight gain happens when you create a calorie surplus (eat more than you burn). Your body takes the excess calories and converts them to fat which get stored around your stomach, arms and thighs. The longer you remain in a calorie surplus, the more weight you'll gain. To lose that weight, you need to do the opposite. You need to create a calorie deficit (start eating less than you burn). <br>  <br>  Your first step is to figure out how many calories you burn on a daily basis. This calculator will help you out <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a> The number you get from this tool is what your body burns on a daily basis. To lose weight, simply eat less. It sounds a lot easier than it is but making small changes helps you adjust to a new lifestyle. Don't think of this as a diet, think of it as a new life. Instead of eating foods high in sugars, white flour and saturated fat, go with fruits, vegetables, whole wheats, fish, lean meats, nuts and beans. In addition to eating less, you also need to exercise more. Start off at 1-2 times per week and work your way up to 3-5 times per week.<br>  <br>  Don't make all of these changes at once or you won't be able to properly adjust to them. Generally, eating healthier foods will decrease your calorie intake. Compare a doughnut to an apple and you'll see that healthy foods are lower in calories. You can find some more information at the Beginner's Guide to Dieting - <a href="http://straightdiet.com" rel="nofollow">http://straightdiet.com</a>|`|tdRZvkEraa	That's great you want to live a healthy lifestyle. So absolutely no smoking or drinking.<br>  <br>  Food-wise: Eat only fresh foods, no processed, canned or fast foods. Absolutely no soda and no deep-fried food. At least 5 servings of fresh fruit and veg daily. Eat protein with every meal such as eggs, meat or tofu. <br>  <br>  In the morning, you can put milk, a raw egg and a banana in a blender for a nutritious breakfast milkshake.<br>  <br>  Drink water or loose leaf green tea. Include fresh garlic and ginger in your diet. <br>  <br>  If you eat this way, you will rarely get sick. I have been eating like this for 20 years and I can't remember having the flu or a cold during that time.<br>  <br>  I blog about healthy eating:<br>  <br>  |`|AA11085011	Avoid anything containing Aspartame or MSG.|`|UpgG0Kxaaa	check out bodybuilding.com check out the diet plans

AA11934605	i was just a little overweight not that much - like 65kgs and 5 foot 3. I lost only a few kilograms in a month, only did a little exercise.  Im going to tell you something i wish someone had explained to me. The information booklet tells you that you may get oil coming from your behind....but one day i was bad and had a hotdog and chocolate and the next morning i woke up in bed, yawned and farted and all this oil came out and stained my mattress. Its really embarrassing but i wish someone had warned me. I stopped using it straight after that. <br>  <br>  Let me think of anything else u mite need to know: it takes at least a week before you start getting any side effects like oil discharge(well it did for me), and another embarrassing thing is when you use the toilet your poo comes out especially orange if you've eaten oily stuff but it comes out more in a diareah type way...and the problems is that it looks like someones put orange droplets of oil in the toilet and sometimes they dont flush very well....and it leaves an orange rim around the water level of the toilet. It smells a bit funny too - hard to explain. Also, sometimes i got stomach pains but nothing too bad. Also, i was very self conscious about being intimate with anyone in case i got oil discharge (it is pretty much poo oil coming out) and thats not sexy. Sorry if this grossed anyone out.<br>  <br>  Anyway, i didnt like it. But good luck with it yourself.

o2WEoWp5aa	Water weight is when your body retains more water than it needs. It can do this for a variety of reasons, but probably the most common is because you are eating too much salt. The more iodine your body intakes, the more water it will keep. This is partially why when people go on diets and stop eating so much processed food, they lose water weight first. They are simply not eating as much salt and preservatives, so their bodies stop retaining all of the water.|`|9TaK9DQMaa	its when the water starts going to your stomach more than the food and just stays there till new water comes!

YOU KNOW WHERE SUICIDE'S ROAD WILL END! WHERE DOES YOUR LIFE END? WHERE WILL THE ROAD GO!? DON'T YOU WANT TO FIND OUT?<br>  <br>  Suicide...please read. I found it on another side and I feel it is very important so if you have ever felt like committing suicide or you know someone who is thinking about it then please read this (or get the person who is thinking about committing suicide to read this) I know it?ˉs a hard subject to talk about (trust me iv been there) but life is short and there is so much to enjoy. You will get through it. You've decided to do it. Life is impossible. Suicide is your way out. Fine -- but before you kill yourself, consider these facts:<br>  <br>  Suicide is not usually successful.<br>  <br>  You know a guaranteed way? Ask the 25yr old who tried to electrocute himself. He lived. Bit, both of his arms are gone.<br>  What about jumping? Ask John. He used to be intelligent, with an engaging sence of humor. That was before he lept from a building. Now, he's brain damaged and will always need care. He staggers and has seizures. He lives in a fog. But, worst of all, he knows he used to be normal.<br>  What about pills? Ask the 12yr old with extensice live damage from an overdose. Have you ever seen anyone die of liver damage? You turn yellow. It's a hard way to go.<br>  What about a gun? Ask the 24yd old who shot himself in the head. Now he drags one leg, has a useless arm and has no vision or hearing on one side. He lived through his "foolproof" suicide.<br>  <br>  You might too. But .. who will clean your blood off the carpet or scrape your brains from the ceiling? Commercial cleaning companies may refuse the job -- but someone has to do it. Who will cut you down from where you hung yourself, or identify your bloated body after you've drowned? Your father? Your mother? Your sister or brother? The carefully worded "loving" suicide note is of no help. Those who loved you will never completely recover. They'll feel regret and an unending pain.<br>  <br>  Suicide is contagious. Look around your family. You do have other choices. There are people you can help you through this crisis. Call a hot line. Call a friend. Call a doctor or hospital. Call the police. They will tell you there's hope. Maybe in a phone call this weekend. But what you're seeking could be just a minute, a month, or a day away.<br>  You say you don't want to be stopped? Still want to do it? Well, then, I may see you in the psychiatric ward later. And we'll work with whatever you have left.<br>  <br>  If you are reading this, steal it and put it in your site too. If you're seriously considering this permanent solution to a temporary problem, please find help. This isn't the way to go, you may think that everyone would just be better off without you, but have you ever seen a family who has lost a loved one to suicide? They're messed up, the parents usually get divorced, the siblings never talk to each other. This not only ends your life, it changes the lives of others around you, but not in a good way. There are people who love you, and people who have been through the same things as you, even though it may not seem like it at times. So please, seek help.<br>  <br>  <br>  & I hope you have realized ;; Suicide's not the way out. there are so many other safer ways of dealing with your problems. Maybe you think it's easier to just die. But think of what you are giving up. you're leaving your family, friends, and all the people who care about you and love you. And maybe you're not even that old yet, you have to experience life, find true love, that kind of stuff. Killing yourself isn't going to help. That's just running away from your problems, it's not solving anything, it's not making it better.<br>  <br>  I know i can't convince you to not commit suicide, but just please think about everything a little before you do anything.<br>  <br>  There's always someone who will be there for you to talk things through even if it seems like no one is there for you. Everything will get better, and it will be okay.<br>  <br>  So whenever you are going to pick up that knife, or razor, just think about all the people you are leaving behind, all the memories, and all the good times.<br>  <br>  I guess sometimes everybody feels like they want to die at lease once in their life. And you think there is no other way, just read this over.<br>  <br>  Remember:<br>  You live to have fun, and joke around ;; Not to be depressed. I know depression isn't an easy thing to get over, but it is possible ..<br>  Please read this all it may change your live for ever|`|61a8a6b98882119817ac1648415674d6aa	Don't keep this bottled up inside you.

Stop thinking that you have cancer, the mind can play terrible tricks on your body.<br>  I don't think that people normally gain weight when they have cancer, it is usually the opposite. I of course don't know where you live but there should be a free clinic or even a health department that you should be able to go to that charges a very minimal price to see you. If you do find one, make sure you write down your questions and what you have already been told by other doctor's or ER personal and make sure that you tell them your family's history with cancer.<br>  Your stomach and head are probably in pain because you have convinced your self that you are already sick with something that is life threatening.

If you think you cannot do anything to help yourself, then you can't help yourself.  Let me guess, those "small details" you mention are the fact that you make too much money to qualify for assistance.  So, you need to prioritize what you spend your money on don't you?

6NA2MXNPaa	Yes, you should be concerned. Anytime you have a fever, especially for a prolonged period, it indicates that there is something wrong. There are really only 4 times the body gets a fever: viral infection, bacterial infection, medication side-effect, or disease process such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis. In your case, because your lymph nodes appear to be swollen, it sounds like you have a bacterial infection. This could be strep throat, it could be an abscessed tooth, it could be a number of things. Going to your gynecologist isn't going to help with the problem. You need to see your primary care doctor. Call and make an appt right away. You should never let a fever go on that long without having it checked out. Anything longer than 48-72 hours with a fever needs to be checked out. Prolonged exposure to fevers can ultimately cause brain damage and other organ failure problems. It could be quite serious. Your parents are right to be concerned and you should see your primary doctor as soon as you can. Take care of yourself!

BVaCJkxzaa	I have had 9 ear surgeries but mine have all been for problems with my inner ears. The surgery you are having works very well and takes just a little time and produces great results. You will need some extra pillows on your bed to put along your sides to keep you from rolling over on your ear for a few days and might feel some minor pain for a few days, but you'll be fine and like the results. Just take some extra care and do what your doctor says and ask a lot of questions on how to care for yourself afterward. Take notes if you need to so you can remember the doctors instructions and follow them carefully. You'll be fine so don't worry.|`|eRX96A73aa	My cousin in Germany has had this surgery.<br>  She was 4 years old when she had it and her ears look perfect now!

GcWRPLd6aa	yes, go back to your doctor and have him prescribe you either a topical corticosteroid (hyrdocortisone, triamcinolone) or a systemic one. if it has spread to your whole body you need a steroid. An antihistamine will not do anything for a rash

WK1sieCmaa	First of all, I am sorry that you have and still are suffering.  Many people go years without any diagnosis or an incorrect or incomplete diagnosis.  You can certainly also have bi-polar disorder or a combination of any assortment.  A psychiatrist is probably the most reliable source for a correct diagnosis of your situation but even these doctors sometimes miss something.  That is because a diagnosis consists of two elements:  your symptoms and how you respond to treatment prescribed.  In other words, if you have bi-polar like symptoms (which you described) and you respond to medication meant to treat bi-polar, you likely have that disorder.  Unfortunately, it often takes a couple of months before you will have a therapeutic level of medication in your system, so it can take a while before you will know how you respond to certain meds.  Many people give up too early, thinking that "this (medicine) doesn't work".<br>  <br>  Regarding the Borderline issue:  The only known effective (best practice) treatment for Borderline Personality Disorder in the US is a program called Dialectical Behavioral Therapy or DBT.  It is a program created by Marsha Linehan and she has written several books.  There is a DBT workbook out as well.  You might want to see if there are any therapists that are trained in DBT or see if you can purchase or order a workbook.  <br>  <br>  It is my opinion that many of our problems stem from our thinking.  Our thinking creates our emotions.  There are some excellent materials in this area also, including a workbook called "Mind over Mood" by Dennis Greenberger and Christine Padesky (both PhDs).  This workbook is used at the Mayo Clinic (in Rochester, Minnesota, in their Behavioral Health unit).  There is another program called WRAP (Wellness Recovery Action Plan) that has been enormously helpful to me.  It was designed by a woman suffering from a major mental illness.  Her name is Mary Ellen Copeland.  She has a website called Copeland Wellness Center (I think).  She has great resources there and I highly recommend her materials.  Her program is being used throughout the US to help people struggling with many issues, including chronic physical illnesses.<br>  <br>  Finally, I commend and support you in your efforts to move forward into recovery by taking such a pro-active role in making a better life for yourself.  It can also be helpful to have an advocate to help you on your journey.  This can be another person living with mental illness or a professional that you can trust.  You obviously have great inner strength to have survived thus far.  You will be in my thoughts.  Don't give up!  I hope you will find some of these ideas helpful.<br>  Sue|`|efcDY9FCaa	There is an awesome website by A.J. Mahari, I think it's borderlinepersonality.ca  There are also some great books and online resources.  You could do some research.  Often, the first thing presribed for people with Borderline is an antidepressant, which you should be able to get from your family doctor.  He/She should then be able to refer you to the next appropriate step.  You may also find a community support group.  You may not need a psychiatrist, psychologist per se, but maybe a counsellor who is familiar with Borderline (much cheaper).  The antidepressants would help a lot to get you started.|`|GcWRPLd6aa	that would be something you would have to talk to your doctor about. There are many prescription treatments, mostly antidepressants that are used along with psychotherapy
A9NBtUy6aa	I'm tired all the time, and i had a sore throat and some headaches... Just been diagnosed with Glandular Fever after the doc did some blood tests. <br>  <br>  You sound like me- constantly busy, i have Eisteddford at the moment, alone with my 5 AS Levels coming up, my grade 8 clarinet, my sax, my singing, young enterprise, management shadowing, work experience, trying to find a job...i can usually cope but i suddenly got tired and lethargic after staying up studying too much...<br>  <br>  My advice is to go to the the doctor. If you tire yourself out too much, you'll end up like me, with glandular fever, and im now having to miss 2-3 weeks of school while i recoup, which is really bad at such a critical time of the year.|`|dW9pFT9Daa	It does sound very much like you are low in Iron. Perhaps you are having some issues being under so much pressure from school. It is good to talk to someone about your difficulties. You could also be not eating well, are you skipping any meals? And you have to be aware to keep your stress/anxiety levels down so you don't develop a mental health issue such as depression. Just take it easy, do something fun for a while. I think that would help keep you refreshed. Its a very good idea to go see a practitioner. In the meanwhile get some good exercise and eat well. <br>  *get well soon<br>  <br>  edit - woodsi is very right, you can end up developing glandular fever, and trust me, you don't want that happening.|`|7m4NbvU2aa	maybe you have mono.|`|db32e228f722e24e3c47946a59ae4075aa	omg... get another doctor's opinion!!!<br>  <br>  this is your health your talking about here...<br>  <br>  ask yourself this...<br>  <br>  "Do I trust these people on the internet to tell me what's going on with me?"<br>  <br>  Well, obviously and mistakenly you do because you already asked and submitted the dang question..<br>  <br>  don't trust people on here silly!<br>  <br>  Go see a doctor... don't put your trust in anyone over the interent... put more effort in asking a real doctor face to face!

I almost never woke up for school. I would come home, sleepl never do my homework. I'd just want to sleep whenever possible. I had depression. If you think that depression isn't what you have then try doing this stuff....<br>  Drink a LOT of water. Don't eat processed foods or foods high in sugar....high sugar foods will give you a crash after the 'sugar high' wears off. exercise ..even if its 20 mins a day. Eat an apple every morning and whenever you feel low on energy; studies show that apples actually give more energy than coffee does!   <br>  Also, are you sleeping well throughout the night? if you aren't sleeping well at nights you'll end up getting tired during the day!   :-)<br>  <br>  good luck! :)<br>  Xoxo
2sycPf8Daa	In cataract surgery, the ophthalmologist removes the clouded lens from your eye and replaces it with a clear, artificial lens. This lens is very durable and should last for the rest of your life.<br>  <br>  Your vision after cataract surgery generally doesn't deteriorate over time. However, sometimes the lens capsule that holds the implant becomes cloudy. In such cases, the cloudy capsule can easily be treated with a laser to make it clear again.<br>  <br>  Most people will require glasses after cataract surgery — either for close-up work, distance or both. If you currently wear glasses, your prescription will likely require a correction for close-up work after surgery.<br>  <br>  Take care as always

Raw food won't always make you sick but chicken is a natural harbinger if food poisoning when left to thaw too long or not properly prepared. When chickens are processed and eviscerated they are drawn through a bath to clean them. Problem is that many other chickens have been washed in same bath and the water could be old and bacteria could be present. I say could. The safety precautions are carried out because if you do get some bad chicken, it can cause food poisoning and that can get nasty and in some cases fatal.

LPO8RlVdaa	For a healthy diet, you need to be eating small to medium meals regularly. 4 or even 5 times a day. Each meal (apart from breakfast which should preferably be fibre rich), should contain a balanced ammount of carbohydrates for energy, (from potatoes, rice and pasta, etc) protien (from fish, chicken, occassional red meat is fine, soya is good too) and plenty of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants (simple fresh fruit and veg). Eat like this and make sure you are well hydrated (fruit juice is as good as water, any fluid counts, but some fluids have negative effects too, such as alcohol or caffiene rich drinks.)<br>  <br>  Now for the science bit: Protien is essential for repairing muscle and keeping the muscle you do have healthy (this includes your heart, lungs, brain etc). You naturally lose the ammount of protien you have throughout the day (through urine etc) so this needs to be replenished regularly on a daily basis.<br>  <br>  Carbohydrates are essential for energy. You won't be able to function without it. It also regulates body fat and glucose etc.<br>  <br>  Vitamins and minerals are obviously essential for a variety of reasons. For normal growth and development, for the healthy maintenance of the cells, tissues, and organs that make up our bodies, and also to let us efficiently use chemical energy provided by food.<br>  <br>  Eat like this and you will have a good base for excercise. <br>  <br>  Strength training will help you strengthen and tone your muscles. This is done with the use of weights or by free training.<br>  <br>  There are essentially (without getting overly complicated) two types of strength excercises based on different types of muscle fibres depending on wether you want to build size, bulk and power, or just 'tone' up the lean muscles an get more muscle endurance.<br>  <br>  Heavy weights with short reps/sets will build your fast twitch muscle fibres and build size, power and strength. Imagine big guys at the gym lifting heavy weights. <br>  <br>  But if you use light to medium weights with lots of reps/sets you will excercise your slow twitch muscle fibres, you wont build size, but you will tone up your body and train muscle endurance. This will obviously make you 'look' healthier and more toned, but will also increase your metabolism (as your muscles demand more energy) so you will burn calories faster. These muscles are also excercised a lot with cardio workouts (i.e your leg muscles when running).<br>  <br>  Your arms for example, will need bicep curls and tricep dips using weights and reps of your choice (heavy - low reps, light - lots of reps) and also shoulder excercises such as holding the weights at your waist and lifting them perpendicular to your side or in front of you, etc etc.<br>  <br>  Your stomach will need excercises that cover the entire torso. Leg raises for your lower ab wall, crunches, sit ups and planks for your upper and all over ab wall, oblique twists for your sides and superman stretches for your lower back for example.<br>  <br>  These are just basic examples, there are literally hundreds of excercises, but it is impossible to show you on a site like this, get a trainer at your gym to show you some but remember the basic rules of muscles and weights. <br>  <br>  As far as excercise goes, you should aim to strike a balance between cardio training and strength training, this way you will build good strong and toned muscle, but also keep your body fat levels down and increase your heart and lung performance, making you much fitter and healthier.|`|9j2k2KeZaa	balanced diet and with a poper srict training you would do it porbably and depending on your body.|`|v9zA4YKxaa	No offence but didnt you have gym class in high school?

Seriously, I quit on a whim. My friend told me he was going to quit for Lent and I decided to join him. I just never started back up again! It has now been over a year. <br>  I won't lie to you, I still get cravings. It's like what AA will tell you, or rehab. You just have to take it one day at a time. the longer you go without a cigarette, the more you can say to yourself "wow, I went a whole day/week...is it really worth it to have to start the quitting process all over?" The more times you try and fail, the less likely that you will quit. Also, the older you get, the harder it will be to quit. And, if you quit smoking now, by the time you are in your late 30s you will have no more chance of lung cancer than a non-smoker. I know you know all this, but just know you should quit ASAP. Toughen yourself up mentally and just do it!|`|jHyzIHmCaa	I am also 26 . I chewed and smoked since i was 15 The way i quit was reason and determination.  My reasons for quitting were my faith, and beside what i believe in I also thought about it this way.  Not only would i be spending close to the same amount per week for the rest of my life on ciggarettes, but also the fact that most people forget to add in costly medications at the same time if you would end up getting sick or getting cancer.  Not only would you be buying ciggarrettes for the rest of your life if you can't quit, but also for the rest of your life you may also have to scrounge what little money you have left for prescriptions and costly treatments.  If you have children, you may end up encouraging them to follow your same path that you so desperately want to get away from, if they constantly see you going from smoker, to non smoker then they may think"If Mom or Dad can't quit, then how can I??" and they will be fed the same psychological disease of "I can't!"  I suggest you think of the most important reasons in life, write them down if you have to.... carry them in your pocket, purse, wallett. And everytime you crave a ciggarrette pull it out and remind yourself why you want to quit, who or what is most important to you! To keep from gaining weight go to to the gym or stay active, eat healthy foods,    apples, vegges..  <br>  Best wishes and I hope you succeed!|`|zNk8iUQiaa	I tried the gum but it didn't work.

I gained 15lbs since then :( I just quit cold turkey though.  I did smoke a few years ago (this is my second time qutting) and the patch really helped me. My advice is try to the patch, support groups always help to. You really want to quit and thats the first thing you need is the want.  Then the willpower has to kick in. Just make sure when you quit to watch your diet, and if you need some help see your doctor.  Mine helped me with a diet plan once I quit so I can myself back on track.  Good luck!!|`|O3nARYyMaa	I smoked for 41 years and I gave it up this last Monday, four days ago (not that I'm counting).  So far it's been cold turkey and there's been a few scary moments there when I thought I may succumb.  However, I really want to quit and I am determined not to give in.<br>  <br>  I've actually got some patches from the surgery (they're the lowest level) in case I need help.  It's amazing how many people are so delighted at my efforts and they're full of encouragement.  As we're both going through this at the same time I'd like to send you every best wish in your endeavour and sincerely hope you succeed, and  to wish you a long and happy marriage.

PwHWJkcYaa	I've slept with a doll since I was 1. I still sleep with her now when I'm at Uni and I'm 19. If I'm with my boyfriend, she gets turfed out, otherwise she's with all the time. In fact, I have my doll, a teddy bear I bought when a family member died, 2 puppy dog teddies and a pillow my boyfriend bought me. They ALL share my bed.

e2e426c7412c57bd7f104afda806b223aa	Popping and cracking sound from the jaw come from the temporomandibular joint (tmj). It's the result of an arthritic joint, one that is inflammed, sort of like an arthritic knee. The locking is a result of muscle spasm. The doctor can prescribe muscle relaxer which might help. You didn't say your age so that info would be helpful. If you are old, then you're simply getting old. The body breaks down and this is one way.<br>  <br>  If you are young, then you need to exercise more. Stress can cause tension in the muscles like this. Make sure you are eating healthier foods, stay away from the fast food, I know it's hard, but you can do it! Eat foods that are good for bones like bok choy and celery.<br>  <br>  See a doctor and make sure you don't have any other health problems like high blood pressure.|`|NQGpw0x4aa	you might have TMJ (i think that's what it's called). it's a condition where your jaw doesn't line up quite right and will click and lock at times. there's nothing you can do about it. You may have never noticed it before but it's a genetic condition and doesn't usually show up until after you're fully developed<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.emedicinehealth.com/temporomandibular_joint_tmj_syndrome/article_em.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.emedicinehealth.com/temporoma...</a>|`|Nuuk1Nwtaa	Did you have braces at one point? Braces can screw up your jaw like this. Or maybe you had an accident and banged your jaw? This is a fairly common phenomenon (this particular jaw-cracking). One section of the jaw doesn't fit properly, and will become "unhinged", so when you open your mouth wide or chew or kiss, even, it will pop. <br>  <br>  Short of surgery, there's no real way to correct this and it mostly is an annoyance. If it becomes painful or locked, try to relax your mouth and slowly ease out of the lock. Try to also avoid gum and chewy foods because they can aggravate it. If you're still worried, go see an orthodontist, dentist, or your doctor.|`|4CgYIHWYaa	I started to have that about a year ago. My jaw now constantly cracks and occasionally gets locked it it eat or open my mouth wide. I used to wake up with a locked jaw. My sister had the same problem but she grinds her teeth she has a retainer thing to stop that but for me she said to take ibuprofen and that unlocked my jaw very quickly. <br>  A functional retainer given by an orthodontist can move your jaw and help with the problem.|`|MxKSVdRXaa	I had the same problem, try firmly pressing on your jaw just in front of your ear if it feels tender its a sure sign of jaw grinding, normally while your asleep. Its a good idea to see a dentist and get a specially moulded gum guard to wear when you sleep. Grinding can damage your teeth over time.|`|czFTJPWXaa	Do you grind your teeth? Sometimes people who grind their teeth get jaw pain/cracking/problems from this.<br>  Otherwise not sure. Call your dentist, dunno what they would do. Nothing too bad, lol. And of course, if they want to do something you don't want, it's your decision ultimately.
MTKC2lpxaa	go to the doctor. something serious could be very wrong if your jaw is locking in a certain spot.<br>  <br>  so to the dr. and see what he says! <br>  <br>  :-]
10mOHSZTaa	Don't dismiss this: magnesium and calcium. Zinc can't hurt.<br>  <br>  The magnesium and calcium will have a calming effect on your nerves, and it helps cramps.<br>  <br>  I used to have major problems with cramps and moodiness, but after figuring that it couldn't hurt to take some supplements around that time of the month, it got a lot better for me.<br>  <br>  I'm not an alternative medicine evangelist, and it's not like it's some miracle pill. But calcium and magnesium helps a lot.<br>  <br>  Just don't take too much; magnesium has a laxative effect at high doses.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I thought of some other stuff that helps.<br>  <br>  1. Staying away from caffeine. I don't know why this helps, but it does. I know that it makes the blood vessels in your head constrict, so maybe it makes them constrict in other parts of your body and makes your cramps worse.<br>  <br>  2. Go for walks. When you have cramps the last thing you want to do is move around, but it actually makes cramps better. I'm pretty sure it's because it improves your circulation. Try walking around your block a few times after school and see if that makes you feel a little better.<br>  <br>  Heating pads are also good. I personally stay away from painkillers because they're hard on my wimpy stomach.|`|eL4xXVumaa	Ohh the joys of womanhood. <br>  <br>  The first couple days are THE WORST. I just had this problem this week actually. I was watching music videos on TV and I was crying for no reason, because they weren't sad! I had cramps SO bad I almost left work and I was emotional and clingy.<br>  <br>  This stuff is completely normal, just don't let it get the best of you! Go with the flow and keep telling yourself that its "that time". Others will understand too.<br>  <br>  Eating healthy might help, too. Of course my doctor says stay away from caffeine during it, but I don't so I have to live with the consequences. Also, take warm baths to sooth the cramps, it feels soooo good. Heating pads too.

If not, maybe by walking away later, and bellowing your rage and/or frustration. In some situations, such as work, or school, it might be better to cover your mouth with a cupped hand, bandanna/handkerchief, or use the crook of your elbow, to muffle the sound. Some people find that it helps to journal those thoughts, and emotions soon afterwards. <br>  <br>  Anger, which is repressed, rather than healthily expressed, tends to fester, and later may cause explosive fits of rage, or depression. Let yourself feel the burning energy of that anger, and visualise it, as vividly as possible, as a hot flame cleansing you. It can help to have someone you can talk to. For more physically inclined people, a punching bag, or hitting your pillow, can be an effective release mechanism: visualise, as vividly as you can, that you are striking back at the cause of that anger. "But next time, when you get mad, just remember this quote: 'Those who anger you, conquer you.' It's basically saying that when you give someone the power to make you mad, or let it get to you, it's like they're controlling you. <br>  <br>  When I realized that, it made me mad, so I try to control my anger and not let people see it. You can still control your anger without being walked all over. You just have to draw a line." Try saying to yourself, in your mind: "I am fire! I am ice!". Repeat for as long as it takes for you to calm down sufficiently. Anger management is addressed in much more detail than can be included here, in section 4, at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> and practice daily, one of the relaxation methods in sections 11, 2, 2.c, or 2.i Most people find the progressive muscular relaxation simple, and it can be done in several minutes. Others prefer to repeat a word, like "easy" in their minds, or a short phrase, and focusing your attention on your breath is another technique. You will know from the ease of use, and effect, which suits you best. The EFT, in section 53, is worth trying, too.<br>  <br>  A variant of Eye Movement Desensitisation & Reprocessing therapy, which has been used successfully for those people suffering from anxiety: it is easily learned, quick to use, yet can be very effective, is on page N, of section 6, and I use it before the relaxation techniques, because I have found that it makes them quicker to employ, and more effective. These will enable you to emotionally centre yourself, when practiced regularly. Yoga, and/or T'ai Chi can also help you become a calmer, more self controlled person, who is less influenced by the behaviour of others.

hXYjkCGpaa	There are many teeth whitening methods ranging from the products for at-home use, such as toothpaste, strips, and even gel trays, through mall franchises, to in-office treatments applied by dentists.<br>  <br>  They differ greatly in price, and also in effectiveness. In making a decision you should also consider the level of discoloration of your teeth. Care must be exercised to prevent damage to the teeth enamel.<br>  <br>  I suggest you read up a bit more and compare the different systems before making a decision.

5CFvbDlKaa	I'm 14 and i discharge constantly. You should make sure you wear panty liners because the discharge can ruin your underwear. As for the masturbation, it's probably just ejaculation. No one is really sure what it is. But its totally normal. Also make sure the discharge doesn't smell or has a greenish tint and also make sure your vagina isn't irritated. These could all be signs of a serious infection. If you have any of these signs, you should go to the doctor.|`|lMvwVvqbaa	its called vaginal discharge and it happens to all women, espically around the time of your period.

Glands in the cervix produce a clear mucus. These secretions may turn white or yellow when exposed to the air. These are normal variations.<br>  <br>  The amount of mucus produced by the cervical glands varies throughout the menstrual cycle. This is normal and depends on the amount of estrogen circulating in your body.<br>  <br>  Vaginal discharge that suddenly differs in color, odor, or consistency, or significantly increases or decreases in amount, may indicate an underlying problem like an infection.<br>  Common Causes<br>  <br>  The following situations can increase the amount of normal vaginal discharge:<br>  <br>      * Emotional stress<br>      * Ovulation (the production and release of an egg from your ovary in the middle of your menstrual cycle)<br>      * Sexual excitement|`|zDJVWlscaa	It's a discharge, all women get it.<br>  <br>  The goo that comes out when you masturbate is due to sexual arousal, you get "wetter" when you're turned on.|`|2Ol0i5fqaa	Discharge.<br>  Every girl gets it, its good it means your clean and healthy :)<br>  <br>  Nothing to worry about.<br>  If its uncomfortable then you can get everyday pantyliners to keep you feeling fresh<br>  <br>  :)|`|F84NNNgYaa	first of all I don't know what's happeni but you should definitly go to a doctor and figure this out

yXhczMyjaa	Well if the doctors office is 3 YEARS from your home, then your husband should be fully recovered by the time you get home. I am sure you meant 3 HOURS. Depending on the weather, bringing pillows and blankets will be a big help. As far as the ice is concerned, you should only need to change out the ice maybe once on your way home. You can carry some ice in the small ice chest, and find the best place to stop and do a quick ice swap. You will need to help your husband. As far as being at home, I stayed no the couch for several days and then tried doing some light work the fourth day. After the procedure, they pack and scrotum and penis area with lots of gauze. Leave that there for at least 24 hours. I did not even touch it for 24 hours because I couldn't feel that area. I would not count on having sex for at least a week or so. Trust me, don' t push that one, I found out the hard way. If there are little kids or even pets at home, PLEASE watch them closely and make sure that they do not in any way hit or impact the crotch. i saved the best advice for last. Wear a pair of loose comfortable pajama bottoms on the ride home. You will be very thankful you did, as any pressure hurts like hell.|`|uM2IZBobaa	I had my vasectomy done on a Friday and was back to work on Monday.

Thankfully it was just a 5-mile drive.  I used percoset for the first 12 hours with ice and then went to motrin and ice for 2-3 days.  I was a little sore for another week and went back to normal activity after 3-4 weeks.  Some men experience much worse results, but for me, the vasectomy experience itself was no big deal.  I've had dental procedures that were much worse.<br>  <br>  My problems began 8 months after the vasectomy when several complications started.  First, my epididymides became congested; second, I started leaking at the vasectomy site (tip) where, in response, two VERY painful granulomas formed; and, third, in response to sperm being out in the open, my body initiated a violent immune system response against my own sperm (hence, autoimmune).  <br>  <br>  The worst part is that I was abandoned by the urologist that did the vasectomy.  He had no clue what to do.  It was only until I found one of about 10-20 experts in post-vasectomy complications that I finally got some answers and help.  Sixteen months after the vasectomy, I underwent a reversal which kept the pain away for 2-1/2 years.<br>  <br>  I recently had a setback and the pains returned, but ice and medications seem to be helping quite well.<br>  <br>  My point is that this Wednesday is the 4th anniversary of my vasectomy and I'm still dealing with pain and inflammation.<br>  <br>  I hope that answers your question.|`|JXsViDciaa	I'm making a real effort here to be kind because your english really sucks. If his doctor knows what he's doing, he won't have to place any ice on his testicles. In fact, he should rest for 2-3 days and then be back on his feet (barring any complications). The procedure is much more advanced then what it used to be. It's completely painless.<br>  <br>  He will have to take 2-3 samples of semen to the doctor to have a sperm count to make sure the procedure was effective. After 6 weeks, you should be able to have worry free sex. It's the best feeling in the world.|`|Cu0zrPWDaa	Your poor husband|`|NXBmcEz7aa	A few hours after the operation, the doctor will let your husband home.With all those modern equipment and technologies, you don't have to be so worried as you are now.  The doctor will tell you what to do and not to do.  I have seen fellows who have their operation on Friday and went to work on Monday.  They say you can start sex again after two weeks or more if you can wait.  But for about one month or more, depending on doctor's recommendation, you still have to use a condom if you will have sex, because there could still be some active sperm mix with the semen and there is a possibility that you can still get pregnant.  Congratulations!  Have a good time!|`|stnclsxnaa	I had one done yesterday & I dont need ice. If anything, ice would make him VERY sore and uncomfortable. he should just sit as best he can in the chair, stop every once in a while & relax when he gets home.

Sex can be resumed depending on how quickly he heals but uise common sence, use a condom till he has the fertility test.|`|1PXkhhzQaa	The answer to your question is that most men have little trouble with the trivial post-procedure pain.

You could have a nosocomial infection.  Which are hospital aquired infections.  I would see your surgeon or medical doctor asap.  You do not want this to break open, especially if it is on your abdominal area.  See your doctor.<br>  <br>  **Nosocomial infections are caused by viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens. During their hospital stay, many patients acquire viral respiratory infections (eg, influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial viruses) in the winter, rotaviral infections in winter, and enteroviral infections in the summer. Viruses are the leading etiologies of nosocomial infections in pediatric patients (responsible for ≤14% of hospital-acquired infections with identifiable pathogens).<br>  <br>  Bacterial and fungal infections are less common. However, they are significantly associated with more morbidity and mortality. Most patients who are infected with nosocomial bacterial and fungal pathogens have a predisposition to infection caused by invasive supportive measures such as intubation and the placement of intravascular lines and urinary catheters. Fungal infections are more likely to arise from the patient's own flora; occasionally, they are caused by contaminated solutions (eg, those used in parenteral nutrition).|`|SltEwVX7aa	in some surgeries, drain tubes are left in to shunt excess fluid.  chances are that one of those 'cuts' could be where a drain tube was.<br>  <br>  but, I'd talk to the surgeon (or at least his nurse), and let them know what's going on.  you should have been told some things to expect, and when and why to call if it's necessary.|`|ouXbJLbOaa	get medical attention IMMEDIATLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  just to be on the safe side. you should go to a hospital or an urgent care center. you dont want to make it worse. it sounds like the cuts might be infected. hope you feel better soon!|`|3AY5lS9saa	Puss means infection and the incisons shouldn't be bleeding.

AA10478980	Angel food cake is lower in calories than any other cake.  You could use it to make strawberry shortcake with low calorie cool whip.<br>  <br>  A low cal dessert I make is with sugar free jello (about 5 to 10 calories per serving).  Add about 3/4 cup boiling water to a small package of jello and beat with a mixer for about 30 seconds.  Then add ice cubes to water to make about 1 and 1/4 cups and add and beat for another 30 seconds.  Then add about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of low calorie cool whip and beat again.  Then pour into tall glasses and the dessert will form layers as it sets.  You can also fold in fruit before you pour it into the glases.<br>  <br>  Another is to use a package of low calorie pistachio instant pudding.  Blend together the pudding (dry - no need to add milk) and about 1 cup of crushed pineapple plus about 1/2 a cup of the jjuice (more juice won't hurt), 1/2 cup of chopped cherries, 1/4 cup chopped nuts.  Then fold in about 1 cup of low calorie cool whip and let set in individual dishes.  <br>  <br>  Enjoy.

The flu is a three letter word but can be deadly if left untreated.  I think it's time for a new pediatrician, that is not normal at all.|`|8lOevqftaa	Yes a fever that high is really worrisome.  But your pedia is right for now.  Viral infections usually lasts 3-5 days with the 1st 2 days having the highest temperature.  That's the time that your body is trying to fight off the infection.  As long as the boy looks active and eating well, wait it out.  <br>  <br>  What we do is give the Tylenol every 4 hours.  1 hour after the Tylenol and your son is still hot, back it up with the Advil.  <br>  <br>  I would disagree though with the cool bath because you are closing the pores of the skin and the heat can't come out.  It would cool him down a bit for some time but the temperature would rise up again.  Try doing some hot water theraphy.  You soak the legs up to the knee in hot water (test it first) while covering the whole body with a blanket.  It would help him perspire and release the heat from the body.  Increase his water intake and no sweets.  If after 3 days the fever continues to come back or there are other symptoms tthat comes out, bring him to his pedia for a second look|`|aScgVDZ1aa	While your pedi is most likely correct, you have to go with your gut feelings.  It is never unreasonable to get a second opinion, especially in light of the new symptoms.  You should have them take a swab of the mouth, to look for strep.  The headache can be caused to muscle tension from the fever.  Having said that peds can handle higher temperatures and be ok...but if your gut tells you something is wrong, take him in to be sure.  Just be sure not to give him aspirin as that can cause other problems.

MR9iBgafaa	It could be via other fluids - could be urine-blood, saliva-blood, blood-blood.  If you think you've caught it I believe there's a drug you can take (called PEP or something) to reduce the risk.<br>  <br>  Yes you can via blood brothers, but a very small chance, even if your blood brother had HIV. You just press the blood together from your thumb don't you?  If you did the true blood brothers and slit your wrists and shook hands, then a different story.<br>  <br>  But isn't the point of blood brothers that you trust each other? I did blood sisters with my best friend at 16 and was fine, though I didn't suspect her of having HIV.|`|hsEo77F9aa	FYI, there are some very incorrect answers here. Let me provide you with the facts:<br>  <br>  HIV can be found (in enough concentration to be able to infect) in the following common body fluids:<br>  BLOOD (inlcuding menstrual blood)<br>  SEMEN (and pre-ejaculatory fluid)<br>  RECTAL FLUIDS/SECRETIONS (only at issue with anal sex)<br>  VAGINAL FLUIDS/SECRETIONS<br>  BREAST MILK<br>  <br>  Blood to blood contact can transmit HIV. The other fluids can also get into our bloodstream by sort of being 'absorbed' through our mucosal membranes (most commonly the vagina, cervix, rectum, urethra/pee-hole, foreskin on a penis, There does not necessarily need to be a cut or tear in the mucosal membrane for infection to occur, as HIV can pass through the membrane and get access to the bloodstream. However, cuts or tears will make it more risky. And having other sexually transmitted diseases (like chlamydia, gonorrhea, herpes, syphillis, etc ) can make you more vulnerable to getting HIV if you are exposed to HIV+ body fluid in the areas of the mucosal membranes where you have the sexually transmitted infection. Basically, having any other STI elevates the likelihood you will be infected if you are exposed to HIV+ body fluid. Even things like yeast infections and bacterial vaginosis (any imbalance in these sensitive areas --- urethra, vagina, rectum) can increase your risk for HIV infection if you are exposed to it while having one of these issues.<br>  <br>  As for the whole, blood brother issue....... it's definitely not a very good idea. While the likelihood of the other person having HIV is most likely quite low, there are other infections that are relatively more common that can cause problems you don't need.<br>  It is possible for HIV to be transmitted during a 'blood brother' type situation, though it isn't likely to be all that effective at transmitting HIV. If there was a deep enough cut and enough blood was flowing and the hands were held together for long enough it is definitely possible, but transmission would not be a guaranteed thing in these cases.|`|N5fPygmPaa	That is def a way you can get HIV, but your risk of getting it would depend on the viral load of the person that has HIV. Also, PEP stands for "post-exposure prophylaxis", which is about a 4 week drug regimen using a combo of 2 or 3 anti-HIV drugs|`|nrVy8hNnaa	HIV is a bloodborne pathogen, so there does have to be blood transfer. There can be blood present in other body fluids, so any body fluid can put a person at risk. the blood brother thing, yeah I would say that is about as high risk as you can get|`|u18GBKmiaa	Yeah but it has to be blood to blood

She is suspecting a hormonal imbalance like you could be dominant with one specific hormone which may be affecting the length of various phases of your menstrual cycle, so they will need to tweak your hormonal balance.

AA12256470	Ok, so I got spacers yesterday. Spacers are needed so that they would make spaces between your molar teeth. They are these elastic bands that are put on your teeth like rings.The first 5 hours it didn't hurt for me, but now it hurts pretty bad, especially when I bite down. You can take some Advil, but personally, it didn't help at all. Just try not to think about it. The orthodontist takes the spacers off the day that you get braces (usually after a week). However, not everybody needs them. Your dentist will tell you if you do. Don't worry too much about it. Good luck!|`|4a2VzINCaa	its like crap in your mouth|`|KkjOXRRWaa	They're things slit between your teeth to space them out. They hurt for a bit because it's pushing apart your teeth.|`|YCvXvzk7aa	Spacers are small donut shaped elastic rings. They are placed between your teeth to create sufficient space to properly and comfortably fit your braces. <br>  <br>  As first, they may feel like pieces of food stuck between your teeth. That sensation may go away in a few days. <br>  <br>  Your teeth may become sensitive. However, this will only last a few days. Any discomfort can be relieved with whatever medication your would take for a headache. <br>  <br>  I personally used Invisalign, costs about the same and you can take them out when you eat. :)|`|rfA3gMN4aa	they are these blue like bands they spacer your teeth out I have braces there cool to have they space out your teeth they dont hurt alot just a little|`|eUMc2PbNaa	They space your teeth out so all that metal junk can fit between them to straighten your teeth out.

rpnFxnCQaa	Aristotlelus,<br>  <br>  I can relate to how you feel. I used to suffer from anxiety/agoraphobia. <br>  <br>  I was thinking too much. I had anxiety attacks when I had to speak in public. Or when there would be more than a few people around me in the same room. It was something that started when I was a teenager and that lasted over years and subsequently affected my career until not so long ago. Looking back, I feel I should have taken action way earlier. But anyway, that's the past.<br>  <br>  At some point, I was prescribed medicine but I wanted to avoid that because of the side effects (just my point of view but you should think about it). That's when I discovered a program that cured me. It is a 100% natural method. You can find it here:<br>  <a href="http://www.stop-your-anxiety-now.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.stop-your-anxiety-now.com</a><br>  <br>  The key of that technique is that you should no longer fear the thought of anxiety. You know what I mean? You are thinking too much. You have to get out of that loop. <br>  Tackle the issue ASAP. You can get rid of it - others have, I have.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA10493307	Liquid Valerian Root. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://anx.8v.com" rel="nofollow">http://anx.8v.com</a>|`|ParFJxnSaa	View the information and weblinks for social anxiety/shyness, and self confidence, in sections 9, and 38, at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> Here is an exercise that can help you. It is called "Act as If." When you are in a social situation, act as if you are outgoing. Talk more, smile at everyone, ask questions, speak in a normal or excited tone, not a meek tone. Watch some of your outgoing peers, and imitate the style of their social behavior. (I PRETEND that I'm an ACTOR, PLAYING a PART).<br>  Research shows that when you "act as if" continually, your image of yourself begins to conform to your new behavior. In this case, you will gain self-esteem and self-confidence, and begin to see yourself as socially normal, not shy. You will become more socially successful, and this will motivate you to continue your new social behavior until it becomes a habit. Try this for a month, in every situation you can. I am confident that you will become much more comfortable and outgoing.<br>  <br>  One form of therapy is to go somewhere that nobody knows you, and deliberately make an utter fool of yourself: put on a paper hat, and yell out: "I'm queen/king of America!", or something else ridiculous, (make up your own - have some fun, safely) then get back in the taxi, (warn the driver of your intentions, first) or car, and leave. People will point, and say: "Look at that idiot". But, you may not be up to the stage where you can do that, yet (I can, and I used to be shy). Or, preferably in the company of a friend, or family member, on a different train, or bus route to your regular one, call out the names, or numbers of all the stops. It will teach you that, although it isn't actually pleasant, (EXPECT MODERATE DISCOMFORT) you will survive; be stronger for the experience, and the next time (should you need to repeat this type of therapy) will be considerably easier. Remember: "A fear avoided is a fear strengthened; a fear faced is a fear reduced." Regard it as your final test: once you have accomplished it, the barrier will be broken; just don't go too far, the other way! Learn to laugh at yourself, and give a big, cheesy grin when others see you do something foolish, as we all do, occasionally.<br>  <br>  It is endearing, if you don't do it too often. Use positive affirmations: for example: "I am very likable and other people feel comfortable around me". Write down all of your self limiting beliefs; then write down the positive counter of them, (exact opposite) and repeat them and imprint them into your mind. Most importantly: Force yourself to approach somebody and initiate some sort of communication. Start out small by asking the time and directions and gradually go bigger. Although there are anti-anxiety medications (anxiolytics) available, these come with risks, and the possibility of side effects, habituation, even addiction, and withdrawal problems, and are unsuitable for young people. <br>  <br>  Try having a cup of "Tension Tamer", herbal tea, by Celestial Seasonings, (from supermarket tea, or health food aisles) or make some at home, and cool, then bottle, and drink as needed (I find it so strong tasting, that I need to drink it quickly, followed by something like fruit juice, to take away the taste, but others may find it more tolerable). C(h)amomile tea is a more palatable option. As with all herbal/green teas, use lemon/lime, and/or a little sweetener (NOT ARTIFICIAL!!!) but no cream, or milk. Xylitol, or Stevia is preferable, (health food stores) or fruit sugar (fructose, such as "Fruisana", from supermarket sugar aisles).|`|ikm8hJYZaa	It is not wise to prefer medication trust me.It does more harm then good and it basically makes you a drug addict.<br>  <br>  Use high quality chocolate instead.Very effective.<br>  <br>  <br>  Cocoa rich chocolate.Cocoa contains natural substances that reduce stress and pain and create a feeling of pleasure in your brain and increase your brain activity.How long effects last depends on how much you consume.Only a few pieces of high cocoa chocolate reduces your pain,anxiety or stress for most if not all day.Lindt exellence is my recomendation.The best chocolate you can buy and affordable to most people.You can find it in any store with large selection of items.The applications of cocoa are very wide ranging from consuming it before a dentist appointment to reduce pain and fear from the drill.It is very effective.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/weblogs/take-weight/2008/Nov/07/seven-anxiety-fighting-foods/" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtontimes.com/weblogs/t...</a><br>  <br>  With the help of it you will conquer your fear of inadequacy or social anxiety and you will need less and less of it.|`|T8P2sXMGaa	honestly there is no quick fix.. <br>  u have to start being honest with yourself..<br>  and more gentle with yourself..<br>  tell yourself that its a hard thing for you.. but that ure trying equally as hard to make progress in the other directions..<br>  there will be some failures along the way.. i can assure you<br>  but just embrace them, and keep growing.. keep learning as a person|`|UP2WzIISaa	try cbt therapy before taking meds just a suggestion.|`|Jzv6WyxSaa	While medication may be a temporary solution, therapy is probably the best way to go if you want to help yourself completely.

I only took paxil and prozac and that was within a span of six months. So I won't recommend any meds.<br>  the only practical advice I can give you is take it ALLLLLL in. the less concentration you put into your fear and looking for "safe zones" like the inconspicuous corner of the room or the furthest seat on a train and MORE concentration on taking the entire scenario in you begin to remember (don't know how long you've dealt with this) what it was like to just walk around owning your own space. <br>  this is what works for me. I shut down all the self talk, even the temptation to have sort of casual thought wandering. In my experience this has been sort of like leaving the "back door" open for worry. One thing that super helps if you are standing in one place (like say the grocery line) take in all the colors surrounding you. sounds stupid I know but it makes everything more lively and makes reality more your focus than yourself. <br>  it can be overwhelming (don't know what you're symptoms are I used to get hot flushes through-out my face) but just endure it as best as you can without worrying about how it's making you feel, physically. if I'm walking on a crowded sidewalk I focus on my walk, not myself. Oh, it really helps to walk standing up straight. shoulders back, you know. I don't know if it's physiological or psychological or both, it just does for me. Plus, people look at you differently (i know you don't want all eyes on you, but it's actually a good response I get) and it gets you in the 'I belong here' mode. its really cool. <br>  Um.........it's really about learning to be "vulnerable". (again, don't know how long you've been going through this). if you can remember the time when you didn't have to worry about being in a crowded room full of people you would remember that you were never really thinking about it in the first place. you were just BEING. it wasn't a seemingly vulnerable situation. You were not expecting to be anxious. Go back to that. of course it's different now, because it doesn't come natural anymore.if you remind yourself of anything let it be this, you will have to allow yourself to be vulnerable in order to realize and understand it was never really a vulnerable situation at all. <br>  This is when you get that rest, that peace, back.|`|KWlMWRS0aa	Try Paxil. I took Paxil for a bit. Although it didn't work for me as far as social anxiety, I do know people who do have really good results taking this med.<br>  <br>  It's worth a shot.

fk9AvB25aa	Herpes is not the same thing as genital warts, they are 2 different viruses. Cold sores are caused by the oral herpes simplex virus and they are contagious.<br>  You don't usually get cold sores from oral sex but you can. You can also get them from kissing people that have cold sores. Cold sores are very common to have 50-80 percent of the world has them, so there is a good chance that your partner could have had them too and may not have known it.<br>  Herpes can take 2-14 days to develop symptoms, or it could take longer then that because your body can suppress the virus for months or weeks after you contracted it. Oral herpes usually comes with itching, burning and or tingling sensations all at one spot usually around the lips of the mouth. A blister or pimple then comes up on the skin which can break out into a blister or cold sore.<br>  The only way to know for sure what this is, is by getting tested for HSV1 at your doctors office|`|C44Ux50paa	did she have any pubic hair or stubble? you could have just irritated yourself badly. if i makeout with a guy with stubble i can hurt my lip. lips are very sensitive. in order to contract herpes you would have had to come into contact with an open sore. if you went down on her, you should have seen if she had any sores or not.|`|eNmRWsvYaa	Nobody on the internet can make sure it is herpes or something else without seeing it.

rCYIWvwraa	Why haven't you gone to your physician for this issue?  There could be a number of reasons your belly aches while you sleep in this position.  Have you tried a warm compress?  Warm cup of milk?  Some herbal tea? Are you drinking enough water daily?  Do you drink a lot of soda? Or anything with high amounts of carbonated water (the carbonation could be upsetting your stomach)?  Are you eating anything right before you go to sleep at night?  Sometimes, that could be the issue.  Your digestive tract needs at least 3 hours to digest food at night before you sleep.  Otherwise, you could pick up unnecessary weight as the sugar in your system turns into fat while sleeping.  Or you could get serious belly aches.  Are you highly allergic to any specific type foods?  Are you a bit over weight at all?  That could be it also.  Monitor your eating habits as well as any physical aches and pains your body may be experiencing.  Write down any significant changes to your daily and nighttime eating habits.  Then go to your internal medicine physician for a thorough consultation.  If you don't have medical insurance, research open clinics in your area who will take walk-ins on short notice.  There are quite a number of them around.  Hope all goes well.

IRFbj0G9aa	Sweetie, not getting your period could be a sign of many things.  A medication you are on that perhaps you are unaware could be affecting your cycle, being seriously underweight, or are doing a severe diet, it could be hormonal and offten is you may suffer from Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome.  Don't know if you have heard of it before, it really is nothing to be afraid of.  Go see your Gynecologist and perhaps an Endocrinologist, either way or whatever get yourself to your doctor.  Not doing anything is worse, and could prove to be detrimental to your health.  And yes you can get pregnant.  I suffer from it and have two beautiful children.  PCOS is treatable not curable, and if it is something else that too will be treatable, the worst is that you are letting it go, and if it is something that needs medical intervention the disease itself may not be to blame if it's too late it may be your  avoiding the issue.  Your body is sending you a message, listen to it and don't fear it.  I never addressed my issue at your age and younger cause I had an idiot of a General Practitioner and I was ignorant, I too risked a lot then, in hindsight we are all wiser that is why I am so insistant with you.  Take Care what ever it is you'll deal with it I promise you.  If you want keep posting and I am sure I like many others will stand by you.|`|oaV2U9Fwaa	see your doctor|`|M2XQMPNNaa	Don't allow fear to block you from seeking the proper medical diagnosis that you need! There are several reasons possible for causing your lack of a menstrual cycle. Your Dr. needs to perform an exam as well as draw some blood to help determine a diagnosis.

Ignoring a health problem is unhealthy in itself. First thing Monday morning make an appointment with either your regular physician or a gynecologist, don't wait any longer.
85dnSnVAaa	ok, say suppose you don't like running , walking for other exercise but hope you like to have fun on games. start playing some games which can give your body good stretch. and dont concentrate more on diet but try to reduce high calory food.<br>  <br>  check some more tips of following sites may be helpful to you.<br>  <br>  Thanks|`|AA10736671	1) The very first thing u should keep in your mind and that is the extra weight u put on didn’t come in overnight so it is not possible and also unrealistic to take it off quickly. You have to show patience. Please remember learning to eat well and exercise is the only solution to long-term weight loss.<br>  2) The 2nd important thing is that your body weight is controlled by the number of calories you eat and the number of calories you use each day. So, if you consume fewer calories than you burn, you will lose weight. You can do this by becoming more physically active or by eating less. <br>  3) The 3rd important thing is never skip ur meal or go to a crash diet. Don’t ever try to starve urself. It is very important to understand that when you skip a meal or go on a crash diet, the result is that it slows your metabolism to conserve your energy. And when you lose weight too quickly for a few days, your body thinks it is threatened with starvation and goes into survival mode. It fights to conserve your fat stores. There fore keep in mind never try to skip ur meal, especially breakfast and always try to take food on time <br>  4) Before starting any type of diet, weight yourself and note ur whole body measurement in a dairy. Then after every week weigh your self again and compare with earlier measurements and see how much weight u r losing. Record a goal that you can reach in one month that is 4 to 8 pounds less than you weigh now. Set a goal you know you can achieve.<br>  Now some tips how to set ur diet plan.<br>  5) Start taking your food with out any oil. Try to use boiled/steamed vegetables, meat, and lot of salad. U can eat fresh and raw fruits, boiled/steamed chicken or red meat too but no pork. Please note and put it in ur mind that nothing fried or oily.<br>  6) No Junk Food, Potato & Sugar Please. <br>  7) Drink at least 3 ltr of water daily. Make ur habit to drink water as much as u can. In this way you are not only flushing out toxins, you are also teaching your body that it no longer needs to store water. When you feel starving, drink it as much as u can. Pls remember water is a natural appetite suppressant. <br>  8) Make you habit to use brown bread & sugar. Skimmed or low fat milk & yogurt.<br>  9) First try to avoid any type of soft drink but if u want to taste some thing sweet then drink any soft drink (remember use regular one, no diet cola pls) once in a week<br>  10) Make ur habit to eat once a day a vegetable soap or Thai soup (as ur dinner or lunch) But remember no corn flour in it. <br>  11) Just look at your food portion. It is much better to eat several small meals a day (like 5-6 healthy meals a day) than eat either one or two or three huge meal a day. <br>  12) The most important factor in any weight loss plan is how many calories you consume each day, and eating too few is the most common mistake. Divide ur diet into 5-6 healthy meals a day (1 plate size only)<br>  13) One bowl of oatmeal can be taken as a break fast<br>  14) Smoking & any kind of hard drink is not allowed in this diet.<br>  15) Try to chew ur every food as much as u can, and then swallow it into ur stomach.<br>  16) Watch out ur every drink and every single piece of ur food. Stay away from fatty foods, junk foods, synthetic foods, foods with preservatives and too much carbohydrate. Don’t try to take foods that are made of white flour for example white bread, cakes, pasta etc and food contain sugar such as cookies, ice cream, candy etc.<br>  17) Remember after every 15 days you can take once in a while with a little treat any thing u like. But remember just a small portion. For example one small personal pizza or one small burger or small pastry.<br>  18) Try to adopt some healthy timing. Early to rise and early to bed. No late sittings. <br>  19) People usually want Quick and Easy result, we are all impatient. U have to be patient in terms of ur weight loss and never give up. Always keep in mind that slow and steady win the race.<br>  20) At least take this diet for 3 to 6 months. When u feel that u have achieved ur desired weight then make this is as a Life Style change for ur entire life. Remember do not focus on just losing weight; try to concentrate on diet plan forever so that u will never have to loose weight again. Occasionally u can take junk food too.<br>  21) You have to keep in mind that above plan is a not a quick thin program. Don’t try to deceive ur body. It will destroy your metabolism and in the future the proportion of gaining weight is much higher and easier than today.<br>  22) Exercise: Rule-of -Thumb: remember the formula for weight loss and that is Diet= 70% Exercise= 30%. So remember exercise is must with every diet plan.. The best indoor exercise machine is tread mill. Run daily on tread mill for 30 mnts ~ one hour as per ur convenient. If you don’t have Tread Mill then best indoor exercise is skipping.|`|VbWhiBAHaa	Take DIET.|`|RwujkZeLaa	just tell yourself (I must to lose weight)<br>  then Active about that you like|`|ovPfkHSCaa	If you truly want to lose weight effectively and keep it off you must make a commitment to do so.

Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 What’s so funny about bovines? If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|Zw52BAgQaa	if you dont want to exersize thats.......fine but if you want to lose weight.<br>  <br>  eat as much as you deserve to....if you dont exersize then you dont deserve to eat mmuch.<br>  <br>  easy as that.

5x6ygreZaa	well ok the exact same thing happened to me and believe it or not, it happens to most girls anyway. its the natural fluids that comes out of your vagina to clean it out. dont owrry you'll get your period soon and what you should do is wear those litle 'panty liners' until you start your period to keep from staining your panties. dont know what those are? google it.  trust me i know whats happening to you. its white and it sometimes may stain your underwear a creamy yellowish color. exactly. its completely natural and even after you get your period it will still happen. even in your teens, twenties, and maybe thirties too so dont sweat it <br>  <br>  good luck|`|bhdirgllaa	Okay, seeing blood in your urine has nothing to do with when you'll be getting your period. That sounds more like a urinary tract infection, which also could be causing the discharge. You should tell your mom about the discharge and go back to the doctor to be rechecked to make sure you don't have a yeast infection or urinary tract infection that's causing the discharge. <br>  <br>  Hope things work out for you.|`|HxI51YQtaa	I got mine when I was about your age.

nJKUwCsAaa	Yes riding your bike will help get you started to loosing weight. Try to also incorporate walking in your day to day activites. Walk as much as you can to start. Don't over do it though cause you won't want to if you hurt yourself.<br>  <br>  I know exactally what you are going through. I have lost 100lbs and I have  more to lose. <br>  <br>  If you can only walk to your mail box then that is moving. Do that and everyday try to walk a little further and in 2 weeks you will see that you are able to walk a mile and probably in 20 min.<br>  <br>  But you have to change your eating habits, That is very important and the amount you eat also. No you shouldn't go on a diet, you should go on a life style change. Make eating healthy a part of life. <br>  <br>  Drink Water, Water is the key ingredient and it will keep you hydrated and curb hunger. You must get at least 8 8oz glasses of water in a day. Since you are trying to exercise and you are heavier you need alot more water. I used drink a gallon of water a day but that is all I drink now. I don't like just plain water so I add crystal lite to mine. Its great. <br>  <br>  You need to speed up your metabolism and keys to do that is eat like 5 or 6 times a day. <br>  <br>  Have your breakfast, then about 2 hours later have a healthy snack, like low fat low carb yougart. add some cold milled flax seeds in there, they are great. then 2 hours later have your lunch then 2 hours have another snack but make your snack something healthy like a cheese stick and some fruit. Then 2 hours later eat dinner and don't eat anything at least 2 hours before you go to bed.<br>  <br>  I have a salad with my meals. I sometimes have one at breakfast it depends on what I'm having but make sure you have a healthy salad. That means you should measure out anything with calories like cheese and dressing and seeds. I buy the lettcue in the bags the ones that have 2 or 3 different types of greens in them and I add brocoilli and a ounce of feta or another type of cheese I add 1 to 2 tablespoons of sunflower seeds and 2 tablespoons of dressing. I mix it all up and it is great.<br>  <br>  Always have protein at every meal and make breakfast and lunch your biggest meals have a light dinner.<br>  <br>  When I first started I couldn't walk 5 min without having to rest but in 2 weeks I was able to walk a mile in 20min then I started lifting weights to tone. if you want to email me and I will tell you more things that may help you. :)<br>  add me as a contact and email me. I will help as much as I can :)|`|l0oDymHYaa	Hi Dear<br>  <br>  Sorry that is not enough|`|9vjhBWtLaa	15 minutes a day is a great start.  you will definitely loose some weight, but you won't really get into great shape with such minimal exercise.|`|aHq1HwSDaa	Go to <a href="http://mypyramid.gov/" rel="nofollow">http://mypyramid.gov/</a> to build your own diet plan. You can personalize your food pyramid.<br>  <br>  It is extremely unhealthy to lose more than 1 kg every week. Most people say "go on a diet" but that doesn't permanently get rid of your fat. If you go back to your old habits after you lost weight it will just grow back, and quick weight loss and quick weight gain will harm your health immensely. If you want to lose weight permanently then you should be on your diet for your whole life. Maybe at first it will be very tempting to open that bag of chips but after you get over the hill it will be all plains again. Make sure you have nutrients from the 5 food groups. Eat foods with full grain, and it would be a good idea to buy some recipes on healthy meals. You need atleast 30 minutes of exercise each day. Everyone complains that they don't have time. But I am sure you can find 30 minutes after you get back from work or school. From my personal experience I know that swimming is a great way to lose weight. If you do not know how to swim, then learn the basics. You can hold on to a board and kick your legs. It's not abit tiring and you will lose the fat on your legs quickly. Yoga is another great choice. Yoga may look calm but when you try it it's actually pretty tiring. Buy one of those DVDs that teach yoga and just lay a mat down next to your TV and your ready!<br>  <br>  Or, if you want it the harder way, you can always do jogging or sign up for a dance course or something.<br>  *hint: if you want to lose belly fat then belly dancing is a great way! I have one of those belly dancing DVDs and same with Yoga, just do it in front of the TV. Put on some music while your dancing. It's a great way to enjoy life!<br>  <br>  Throw out all your junk food. Replace with healthy ones. You can get one of your family members or friends to shop for groceries for you. Then you can control yourself from buying anymore junk. <br>  <br>  Don't watch TV or sit after supper. Go for a short walk. There is a shopping center near my house so I always walk there, pick up some things, buy a cucumber juice, then walk all the way back. This way you won't gain any belly fat.<br>  <br>  DO NOT take any pills or medicine that helps you lose weight. You may lose weight temporarily but it gains back once you go back to your old habits. Going around the hard way is not easy, but it is permenant! Once I saw a commericial on diet pills on tv and the two companies had the exact before and after pictures! Anyhow, those things are just to lure people in. Don't believe them!<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck ;)|`|5HJLgAqjaa	Yes , of course you can. I did it, i have lost 7 kilograms bu riding my excercise bike for less than an hour a day and just not eating chips. EASY. it waseasy to cuty back because it was only one thing.

s9yeEMnSaa	La onicomicosis afecta marcadamente la calidad de vida y el bienestar psico-social, ya que al afectar su función de protección, compromete la actividad diaria tanto laboral como social. En ciertos pacientes pueden afectarse psicológicamente, ya que la sociedad moderna valora en exceso la apariencia cosmética, además afecta las relaciones interpersonales por ser juzgados como de pobre higiene y miedo al contagio.

La monoterapia con griseofulvina o con ketoconazol son poco efectivos, con elevada tasa de recurrencias y con significativos efectos colaterales.

For my husband he and his former wife came very close to getting caught plus they had a second baby on the way, he was also talking like he thought he was GOD himself; totally whacked out of his mind. The wife wouod run around outside naked at one point. Once he realized how he was acting & how badly he was messing up his life it did not take him long to straighten out, and he has never gone back. that was 13 years ago.<br>     Now that is trully the issue because most addicts go back several time and some never quit fully, no mater how much they assure you their fine and over it. Often it only takes one social situation or a party to start the habit again. Getting away from those types of people is really hard but most important for many years after quitting successfully.<br>     I on the other hand; had no children or much support from my family unlike my husband. I had hit bottom so many times by losing my home, apartment, a few cars, and all personal possesions over & over. I would straighten up get a job, get back on my feet and one social situation or some guy I was into; started the habit all over again. This went on for about fifteen years and at one point I had quit for a full three years. Finally after the last time I hit rock bottom I quit once again but this last time was much diffrent because I was truly getting sick of the lifestyle, that was my final turning point. A year later my mom with MS and very disabled was pulled out of her home because of abuse from a boyfriend and I had to act or she would be nursing home bound for good (she was only 52). That was 8 years ago and the strength to keep my mom home under my care kept me clean. At this point I can't even stand to be around people I know are high but through it all I have to say it was only when it was finally MY DECISION to quit for good is when it really meant the world to me to stay straight.<br>     There is hope but really it is up to the individual to decide for themselves when they have had enough, you can try many times to make ultimatums, put them in rehab, make threats, toss there drugs, but in reality it is up to the person to really have the desire to quit, and that is just how it is. Most addicts I have know through the years did it not matter what their clean friends, family, or even wives had to say they did what they wanted. Guilt trips do not work. Your best bet I hate to say is if you really want a straight boyfriend who is drug free you can try to help them but at somepoint if it does not work you must be prepared to walk away.
9pLdhuBnaa	If you are just starting out with this Microgestin Fe 1/20 it could be a side effect of the medication as your body tries to adjust to being on it (an example only).  It can take the body about 3 months to adjust to being on the medication.<br>  <br>  However, I would recommend checking with your doctor on Mon to see what they say.

VX0EvSNWaa	Diets have their place in your weight loss goals. First of all, they can be beneficial to jump starting your metabolism. Kind of a fire starter if you will. A jump-start will give you more energy and the initial weight loss can boost your self-confidence.<br>  <br>  However, you will need to be ready to make some whole life changes if you want the results to be permanent. What are some changes you will need to make? Well a lot of that depends on you.<br>  <br>  Lifestyle Changes- Fast Food<br>  <br>  Are you a fast food junkie who eats out at least a couple of times per week? If so, you will find that you have plenty of company. Many people are so busy that the drive through is a perfect solution for dinner, lunch and even breakfast. The problem is many have no idea that one meal from a fast food restaurant can contain nearly a whole day's caloric intake.<br>  <br>  One popular fast food joint has a burger that is 750 calories! The burger alone is a third of your recommended daily allowance; add the fries and a drink and you are done for the day.<br>  <br>  Does this mean you can never have fast food again? Not necessarily, but it will mean that you have to be aware of what you are eating. Most fast food places have a website that contains all the nutritional information for the foods they serve. Check them out then make you a list of "safe" fast foods.<br>  <br>  Exercise Changes<br>  <br>  If you never move your body more than from the house to the car to work and back you will have a hard time losing weight and keeping it off. The human body functions best when there are periods of exercise. It increases mood stabilizers in the blood stream and best of all burns calories.<br>  <br>  While you are on your diet, take the time to incorporate exercise into your life. You will feel better and increase your weight loss rates exponentially. Start with a walk, park further away from the store or your office. Then as you progress, find time to walk more or jog. Whatever you can comfortably fit in your schedule will be a great place to start.<br>  <br>  Healthy Eating<br>  <br>  This is absolutely the most important part of all. While you are on your chosen diet, you will want to become familiar with healthier food choices. Find ways to make your favorite foods better for you. Can you substitute ground turkey for ground beef in some recipes? Learn new recipes that include fresh fruits and vegetables.<br>  <br>  You see your body needs several things to function at a healthy level. Proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals just to name a few. You also need certain fats to cushion joints and protect your vital organs. Create a lifestyle eating plan that brings all of these elements into play and you will feel amazing and best of all you will be able to lose weight and keep it off.<br>  <br>  Check my source, it might help. Good luck!|`|DlaHl613aa	Try <a href="http://www.shapefit.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.shapefit.com/</a> you can plan workouts and they have meal plans, and a ton of other great helpful ways to get you into shape.|`|T2CDlOymaa	join sparkpeople.com<br>  <br>  its great, it helps you keep track of your meals and your workout

VnckTnk9aa	1st off : I'm not a doctor so I'm not qualified to give medical advice.<br>  2nd'ly : I'm not a smoker (weed or anything else, for that matter) so I can't help you from experience.<br>  <br>  BUT...<br>  <br>  I will try to advise you according to what I know. Many of my brother's friends have gone through similar situations to what you've described and I know for sure that it isn't a pleasant thing to have happen to you. Your heart rate naturally increases with the inhalation of marijuana and your interpretation of things around you and your senses are heightened. Sometimes, if you worry a lot about things in life and if you are stressed out (as you say you are), then you start (even subconsciously) thinking about these things, paranoia may set in and trigger off panic/anxiety attacks. I've known some people who have had to go to the ER because of it. But every time, the doctors would suggest that what the body is going through is more of a mental thing that leads up to physical complications, not the other way around.<br>  So, all I can really tell you is lay off the pipe and keep busy with other activities. Try things to tone down the stress in your life, because the marijuana may just be something that triggers a deeper emotional problem, not necessarily the problem itself. So take care of that part of your life (the stress) and avoid the smoking that possibly has been triggering off these attacks.<br>  Everything will be ok, but please see your doctor to ensure that you are indeed in a state of physical well-being and to find out ways to strike a balance regarding your mental well-being.<br>  <br>  God bless you and all the best.
ewpleb76aa	My first anxiety attack was because i smoked weed. If this is the cause of your anxiety then you probably should not smoke. I understand your feeling of having a heartattack but there was never a case of someone dying from anxiety. Anxiety is a mental state of mind not a disease. If you get your mind right you should overcome these attacks. Find away of coping with it when it is brought upon you. Just reassure yourself that you are perfectly healthy and that its just your mind playing tricks on you! Anxiety is normal most ppl have anxiety people deal with it differently its just a way of your mind warning ur body that something is different.. If ur scared for example... Thats not a everyday feeling. If it continues i recommend you see a psy because you want to get rid of this feeling before it controls your life|`|A5PhW8nraa	you are making you're heart work really hard when you smoke weed plus it has to beat faster and harder when you have you're anxiety attacks plus the stress you are over working you're 16 year old heart it will wear out faster|`|wvDh3PdFaa	you better stop smoking otherwise  you will end up to real heart attack.|`|DT4PHmukaa	You probably need to stop smoking weed. You're only 16 and I know there are things that you think you need to be stressed about because I have been there but don't be stressed. Just relax everything will work itself out in due time. It will only make you feel worse if you are stressed. If the pain continues after you quit smoking weed don't be nervous or anxious but you may need to tell your parents. You may not want to tell them about your weed smoking but they do need to know about your anxiety. Best thing to do let stress go completely. I have had anxiety it is not worth it. Learn some slow breathing exercises and push all stressful thoughts from your mind.

I always wonder what it is like to get away with the perfect murder, using my logic and knowledge to fool the police. I don't want to kill a person and I don't look up torture methods or think about details of killing a person, just how I can pull it off. And I do watch a lot of murder documenteries and a couple of horror films, and sometimes say "If he got caught and the police say he almost got away with the perfect murder, and he did a lot of stupid things then imagine what I can do". I'm not sure what you should do, maybe when you visit her house, look around and have a little peek around to see if anything is suspicious or look through her garbage. <br>  PS.

Did you ever pretend with your friends to be a superhero or a race car driver or something? Well, your girlfriend's friend is very nice but just has a thing for evil. She is intelligent, independent, and creative, and it is entertaining for her to pretend to be evil and creepy. It's an alter ego that she likes, possibly a mask for something about her that she wants to hide--some deep hurt that she wants to suppress. Don't worry about her murdering you in your sleep, but she will like you joking about it. Just play along, and maybe she'll show you what is behind the mask.

Vy8p3Qlcaa	Try changing you sleep schedule, and try not eating before bedtime|`|ParFJxnSaa	Exercise, but not within 2 hours of bedtime. Have a warm bath, or shower, an hour before bedtime, then a glass of  warm milk, possibly with Horlicks, or one of the herbal teas, below, and use dimmer lighting. Put your mind in a position where it wants to shut itself off, and sleep. See insomnia treatments, in much more detail than can be included here, in section 3, at ezy build, below. Use one of the relaxation methods, in bed, after lights out, in sections 11, 2, 2.c, or 2.i, but they can take some time to master, (Progressive Muscular Relaxation excepted) so learn and become proficient in their use during the day. An alternative is to use the EFT, in section 53, saying to yourself: "Even though I sometimes have a sleep disorder, I deeply and completely accept myself." (or choose your own wording) while you use the acupressure tapping. <br>  <br>  Some more; quick, and easy to learn, are at <a href="http://www.umm.edu/sleep/relax_tech.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.umm.edu/sleep/relax_tech.htm</a>  The progressive muscle relaxation, (most easily learned) guided imagery, and mindfulness breathing are known to be effective. Find out which works best for you, in the daylight hours, so you will be prepared, come bedtime. For many people, a good idea is to develop a set "wind down" routine for the last hour before bedtime, so your subconscious mind learns that it is time to put thinking aside, and prepare for mindfulness, (awareness, without cogitation/purposeful thought) or the EFT, in preparation for sleep, but the idea with mindfulness is to not even think about sleeping: just drift off, naturally, during exercising those techniques.<br>  <br>  Avoid TV, computer, or anything exciting in this hour, although reading a BORING! book is a good idea.  I suggest that you try using the EMDR variant, in section 3, on page A, prior to the mindfulness, or the progressive muscular relaxation, but after the EFT, if that method is chosen. Experiment, to find which combination works best for you. I also use it prior to my chosen relaxation technique, after lights out, at night. Get strong light, preferably sunlight (even if overcast) soon after waking in the morning, to reset your circadian rhythm. Your bedroom should very dark, after lights out, and a good sleeping temperature is 70 F, or 19 C. No daytime napping. Have a cup of chamomile herbal tea, an hour before bedtime, and employ many of the techniques in section 3. <br>  <br>  Others may prefer Sleepytime, by Celestial Seasonings, Relax, Be Sleepy, or valerian root, from supermarket tea, or health food aisles.   <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a>  If you are one of the 40% of people who are fairly suggestible, you may wish to consider professional hypnotherapy, or: Cure Insomnia, & Sleep and Dream, & Sleep Like a Child, & Drift Off To Sleep, & Fall Asleep Fast <br>  <a href="http://www.hypnosisdownloads.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hypnosisdownloads.com/</a> or from: <a href="http://www.asktheinternettherapist.com/h..." rel="nofollow">http://www.asktheinternettherapist.com/h...</a> - Quiet Blissful Sleep, & Enjoy Deep Sleep, & Restorative Healing Sleep.|`|UP2WzIISaa	deep relaxation therapy .yoga, mediation. there are a number of ways to go it all depends on what you have tried and what your willing to do. taking medication i think would be a last result.<br>  google dr gillian ross she is in yoga and deep relaxation therapy|`|JXsViDciaa	There are many causes related to insomnia.

So don't stop excersising.<br>  Also your testosterone levels will go back to normal very soon.<br>  Stop using test boosters now, the sooner the better.<br>  <br>  Doing dead lift, bench press and squats naturally increases the amount of HGH so better stick to that and forget test boosters. Sleep more and lift more.|`|H2uAJoeMaa	You ask for no dumb answers - but you're worried about "muscle turning into fat" which is physiologically impossible???<br>  <br>  What happened when you stopped taking them last time??

It could be that you feel very at peace with yourself and your mind, body and spirit are balanced, and you feel very connected with the world, and feel a strong sense of purpose :-) If you had a spiritual health issue than it manifests in the aura, and depending how you deal with it it can manifest out or manifest into the mental/emotional/physical problems, hence why positive thinking is important :)|`|m09snBrEaa	its like mental health but a bunch of nonsense added to it talking about vague "energies" and what not that make no sense when you actually look at it from a logical perspective.|`|T6SWGhOjaa	The absence of fear and anxiety, which is replaced by absolute trust and faith in a higher power.<br>  <br>  For me that power is Jesus Christ, who promised he would never leave or forsake us. <br>  I have had no reason to believe otherwise.

In most cases it is painful, and thus is often referred to as a sore throat.

It can result in very large tonsils which cause trouble swallowing and breathing.

u8CFwtyMaa	Are you sure it's urine? when you're aroused, a fluid is released to clear out the urine, and to lubricate the penis head, it may be this you are producing - this liquid is clear, and sticky. If you are having an orgasm (really nice pulsing feeling in your penis) then the clear liquid that is produced then is the clear fluid that carries the sperm, this turns white when you start producing sperm.<br>  Have fun, and I hope this helps.|`|AA11785060	Never normal for urine to come out during an erection.  The internal plumbing in your body prevents that from happening. Guys who have not hit puberty generally have no desire and usually little ability to masturbate by the way, the hormones are just not there to get the job done.  Pubic hair is the universal sign of "hitting" puberty by the way--get it?  Pubes = Puberty. Got pubes, you are there.|`|CC6dSdJmaa	You can cause urine to come out from masturbation, it is because of the sensitivity of the penis. <br>  That sensitivity will decrease and eventually you will ejaculate semen!
cplaV2KWaa	I am not a doctor. I have raised two children of my own and have personal relations with two doctors but my opinion is not professional.<br>  <br>  The first thing is to control the fever. Hot baths are out,out,out. Try immersing him in tepid to cool water to reduce internal temperature. Use, if he has no restrictions, a fever reducing medication such as Tylenol or aspirin (ASA). Try to keep the fluids up. Real danger of dehydration if fluids not retained. Try using Gravol to sooth the stomach and use low acidic juices such as apple juice or low acid orange juice. If Symptoms persist another twelve hrs and temp is still high, go to emerg. He then needs pro help and possibly an IV for rehydration.|`|3NLThcMUaa	Emergency room. Just from suffering dehydration in under a day I've had to be put on an iv drip. Going 25 hours not being able to keep liquids down, and taking hot baths as well, is doing no good. While a bath may feel momentarily good for the chills, if it's too hot it's only sweating out the water in his body, and as he's having chills I'm guessing they have been very warm. Besides someone suggesting tea, ginger ale is usually more agreeable to a sick body.|`|h1lDGNp4aa	How about giving them a call & asking them what they suggest first?  I'm betting that with a fever he shouldn't be taking hot baths even if he does have the chills.  Keep giving him tea to drink but he should sip it a little at a time.  I would also run to a store and pick up something with the word "flu" in it e.g. Tylenol Flu.|`|sPT8ikgXaa	Urgent care asap! That fever is way too high, you might want to recheck it.

C8DOT8Y7aa	Understand the risks associated with belly fat. Belly fat is linked with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. Specifically it's the deepest layer of belly fat--the fat you can't see or grab--that poses health risks.<br>  <br>   That's because these "visceral" fat cells actually produce hormones and other substances that can affect your health (e.g. increased insulin resistance and/or breast cancer risk).<br>  <br>  <br>  [1] The fact that they're located right next to and in between organs in your abdominal cavity doesn't help. For example, fat next to the liver drains into it, causing a fatty liver, which is a risk factor for insulin resistance, setting the stage for Type 2 diabetes.[2] <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  Wrap a tape measure around your waist at the level of your navel. A measurement of more than 35 inches (women) and 40 inches (men) is considered to be unhealthy.[1][3][2]<br>  <br>  <br>  Exercise for weight loss. Aerobic exercise will facilitate fat loss all over your body, including your belly. You can't "spot-burn" belly fat, but it's usually the first to burn off when you exercise, regardless of your body shape.[3][1] Just be sure that you focus on calorie-burning exercises, rather than sit-ups or crunches. If your abdominal muscles are covered in fat, no strengthening of those muscles is going to change that. <br>  <br>  Aerobic exercise is key.[3]<br>  <br>  <br>  An additional benefit is that exercise reduces stress and insulin levels, which reduces the presence of cortisol, a hormone that leads to more belly fat deposits.[4] <br>  Change your diet. Unless you restrict your calorie intake, you're not going to lose belly fat. There are some tactics that might help do away with belly fat faster, but only when you've already consistently restricted your calorie intake. For example, eating an avocado after eating an entire bag of chips isn't going to help you get rid of belly fat--in fact, it'll probably make the problem worse!<br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  Whole grain pasta saladSwitch out refined grains for whole grains. In a scientific study, people who ate all whole grains (in addition to five servings of fruits and vegetables, three servings of low-fat dairy, and two servings of lean meat, fish, or poultry) lost more belly fat than another group that ate the same diet, but with all refined grains. A diet rich in whole grains changes the glucose and insulin response in your body, which hastens the melting of fat, and visceral fat, that deep layer of fat, is easier for your body to burn than the subcutaneous fat under your skin (the fat that you can see and grab).[3] <br>  Studies suggests that a diet with a higher ratio of monounsaturated fats (avocados, nuts, seeds, soybeans, chocolate) can prevent the accumulation of both types of belly fat.[5] Some experts argue, though, that it's not that these fats specifically target abdominal fat in any way; it's that anyone will probably lose weight on a lower calorie diet (regardless of where those calories come from) and as discussed earlier, belly fat is usually the first to go.[3] <br>  Trans fats (in margarines, crackers, cookies--anything made with partially hydrogenated oils) seem to result in more fat being deposited in the abdomen, so avoid these as much as you can.[4] <br>  Soluble fiber (apples, oats, cherries) lowers insulin levels, which, as mentioned earlier, can reduce the presence of cortisol in the stomach.[4]|`|xnCOgKQLaa	Exercise an hour a day.<br>  <br>  You don't always have to run, you can do chores, ride your bike, do yoga, play a sport, or if you want, run.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also maybe try a diet plan. Make sure you also get enough meat & beans, vegetables, fruits, milk, and grains.  Don't intake to many oils (soda, pickles, dips, etc.)

It's all good.|`|AA11522944	Slight bends in the penis are quite common and normal. Some guys bend left, some right, some up, some down.  Slight curves or bends should not be a cause for concern.<br>  <br>  Some curves in the penis can be caused by wearing tight underwear.  When wearing tight styles of underwear most guys will habitually point their penis either left, right or down in their briefs.  This has the effect of constantly stretching the erectile tissue on one side of the penis and compressing it on the opposite side and can ‘train’ the penis to curve or lean in that direction.  To prevent this avoid wearing tight underwear for extended periods of time and ensure that you wear loose fitting clothing to bed or sleep naked.  <br>  <br>  If it is a severe bend you may have a condition known as Peyronie's disease. Check out the links below to see if they describe your situation.

Done properly and consistently, they should add close to an inch or two to your penis in six weeks.<br>  <br>  1. Penis stretches. This one is very simple. Just take your flaccid penis and stretch it as far out in front of your body as it will go. Do it gently and gradually and hold it there for thirty seconds. Rest ten seconds between sets and repeat this at least ten times.<br>  <br>  2. Jelqing. This is another great technique for rookies. Get your penis halfway erect, apply lubrication, and grip it tightly at the base with the thumb and forefinger of one hand. Slowly slide that hand up the shaft toward the tip, pushing as much blood into your penis as possible. When you reach the tip, immediately grip the base the same way using the other hand and repeat. Do this nonstop for ten minutes.<br>  <br>  3. Ulis. This is a great exercise to increase girth. It is also very easy and does not take much time. Achieve a full erection and grip the base of your penis the same way you would if you were jelqing. <br>  <br>  Squeeze as hard as you can without causing discomfort. Your penis shaft should swell and your penis head should get big and shiny. Hold for ten seconds and rest for ten seconds. Repeat this three or four times.<br>  <br>  Do this routine every other day and make sure you warm your penis up before each workout by wrapping it in a hot washcloth for five minutes.<br>  <br>  4. A larger penis can be achieved with the use of penis enhancers. There are many forms of penis enhancement products such as pills, patches and topical oils. However, one unique natural product that can produce significant results and makes use of the body's natural abilities comes in the form of a liquid called super-vir <a href="http://www.super-vir.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-vir.com</a><br>  <br>  Always remember, if you are not satisfied with what you were born with, it is never too late to do something about it!|`|JLayHNZCaa	Yes, sort of.  It makes your wallet thinner and your member red and sore.|`|osY0xlhTaa	There are lots of ways to get a bigger penis, but most of them are scams. One way which does work is penis enlargement exercises.<br>  <br>  There's 2 chambers in the penis which fill with blood when you get an erection. Your size is limited by the amount of blood these can hold. The exercises work by permanently increasing the capacity of these chambers - the more blood they can hold, the bigger your penis will be.<br>  <br>  There's a great site at <a href="http://www.BiggerBetterMan.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.BiggerBetterMan.com</a> - gives you all the options, & all the pros and cons. Check it out|`|ShVxmkO8aa	What do you mean effect....does it work?  yes it does...the exercises work, the weights work, and the surgery works.... the pills, herbs, and creams don't do jack<br>  <br>  I've had good results from the exercises in this guide: <a href="http://www.mistermanpower.net/guide_to_penis_enlargement.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mistermanpower.net/guide_to_p...</a>|`|MyKyEJUvaa	yes it will make your dick bigger. it does work. they will not be selling it if it doesnt work.|`|SltEwVX7aa	of course it doesn't.  If it did, every guy would be a walking porn star.  And that's just not true.|`|JCuv283caa	yeah it has effect, it will enlarge your penis if you do penis enlargement as a routine...<br>  you can ask google for "penis enlargement" exercise, but you should be careful about the info, use your feeling, which one suit for you...|`|uYzjMAI8aa	Depends what your after, Seriously, if your just looking for an larger erection, try holding the urge urinate for a while and then get one, you know, like when you wake up needing one in the morning. Try not jerking off too often, that seems to add a little length.
DpGpCwHBaa	Some tips for you:<br>  1. Eat when you are HUNGRY!!!<br>  - Eat, a little every time you are hungry. This will boost your metabalism. Because when you are hungry and DONT eat. Your body goes into starvation mode. And it stores all extra energy that it would have normally gotten rid of.<br>  <br>  2. Eat what you WANT!!!<br>  - When you eat a little of what you want then you will not feel as if you are depriving yourself. If you tell yourself that you CANT eat something, you will want it EVEN MORE!!<br>  <br>  3. Eat conciously<br>  - This means, enjoy EVERY SINGLE mouthful. Eat slowly and savor every bite. Also, put your fork down between bits. You will eat slower, and this will help with the next step<br>  <br>  4. Stop when you think you are FULL<br>  - This might be a funny thing, since you probably know this, but many of us eat even when we are nto longer hungry. <br>  GOOD LUCK|`|0kiE20Qdaa	Ive given this advice to many ppl and they all said that it has worked<br>  Its called the Wrestler's Water Weight Exercise.<br>  1. Put on clothes that you know you're going to sweat in...preferred sweat clothes.<br>  2. Have either a electric heater or a plug in heater in front of you<br>  3. Drink water while doing this<br>  4. Have a moderate to extreme workout to do in front of the heater<br>  5. Set yourself to at least an hour in front of the heater to really get you sweating<br>  After the first day you should lose about 2-3 pounds of water weight.<br>  Good Luck Hope it helps
HzrMc3zqaa	i have had my tongue pierced, and it was not bad at all. It was swollen for a few days, so there was discomfort, but I'd do it again if I had to.|`|pTBhq0rHaa	The actual peircing does not hurt, it's after, when your tongue swells 5x your actual size, and I would not do it. I had my done 3x's and it ate my teeth up, and then I had to have $8,000 worth of work done to them. SO, you might want to get something else done. Like your nose, or even your eyebrow. Seriously, think about it.|`|afad69e26e3d742b9b035d7dbbbbf716aa	i've never had my tounge pierced but i cannot imagine someone honestly saying that it doesnt hurt. i mean seriously... think about it. putting a foreign object thru your tounge has to hurt like hell!|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	Yes!|`|KcZpH6gkaa	Pain is very personal depending on your tolerance but yes, tongue piercings hurt. Have you ever bit your tongue? It's painful right? Multiply that. <br>  There are some issues that can arise as well. There is usually a scar at the bottom of your tongue where you get it pierced (i.e. a small bump). Besides that don't forget about infections. You must be very careful aand clean it as directed especially since you can use alcohol to sanitize it like you would for other piercings.<br>  <br>  Good luck. Hope this helps!|`|m2nWHkXzaa	yes it does alot, very much, but go head its work it<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  rock on|`|AA10389562	What really hurts is all the dental work you will need as you continually crack the enamel of your teeth with the stud.|`|sQu3LLqtaa	Tongue piercing is very dangerous and can cause speech defects.
DibzbnVhaa	Well, unfortunately I don't think there is anything you can do from a legal stand point. If it was consentual sex its part your fault as well. I understand that everyone needs their fun every once in a while but why not use protection?|`|ZLt8TwOiaa	call a lawyer, I think you can sue him I know people have been put in jail intentionally giving someone aids without disclosing they have it and they have gone to jail|`|a5b42e198900103c6593fc522b1a9354aa	I'm sorry that happened to you, but I hate to tell you, there's not too much you can do. It would be hard to prove he actually gave it to you and harder to prove that he did it maliciously. <br>  <br>  It happened to me too.  I got it from a guy that didn't tell me he was infected and now I feel like the leper and he's just out living his life.<br>  <br>  The only thing I can tell you is to try to do what you can to educate yourself about the virus and the things you can do to keep yourself healthy and suppress outbreaks.<br>  <br>  I've had it for many years now and I still struggle emotionally with it.  But honestly, the emotional part of it is much worse than the physical part.  Other than being quite annoying, it really is not going to physically debilitate you.<br>  <br>  Good Luck to you.|`|295513eb67fcb3786fae8c19af3d1404aa	First, YOUR LIFE IS NOT RUINED! If you have Herpes, you are now a member of an exclusive club! Exclusive - yeah right - since 20-25% of American adults have Herpes - some exclusive club!<br>  <br>  Second, short of trying to DNA test the exact strain of Herpes you may have, there is no way of telling from where you may have gotten it. You can't even prove WHEN you got it! Could have layed dormant for months/years.<br>  <br>  You caught a virus. A pretty simple virus that won't kill you. Take it as a learning experience. Join a support group in your area (search for Herpes Support) - they're great social clubs too! Please do your best to remember it's' something you have, it's not what you are!|`|w6Bfrosqaa	Its really common. You can also get it by getting/giving oral sex to someone with cold sores.  There are creams out there to help but it cant be cured - relapses are common.  there are creams out there which can help apparently
6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	I would recommend against removing it yourself.  The longer you have the mirena in the more your skin would wrap around it and if you pulled it out yourself you can cause serious problems.  Maybe you should try another clinic.  Is there a planned parenthood where you stay.  Try them.  That birth control must be removed by a professional.|`|AA11306457	Removing the Mirena yourself will cause you more problems than you have now.  Call around to different clinics and your local health department about having it removed.|`|ZbMLigR3aa	Simple really, you cannot do it yourself.  You can cause a lot of harm if you attempt to do the removal on your own hon.  Try planned parenthood, they will usually help with this and other issues.  Good luck!|`|WaZtTEbZaa	Try google and look for free clinics.  If you have no medicare this would be the best option.

62z9bhRGaa	go to your dentist right away and he will fill it in for you. if you think that is to much of a hassle then you will have a chipped tooth for the rest of your life|`|Nuuk1Nwtaa	No, it doesn't grow back. Call up your dentist and they'll smooth down the tooth and check for any cracks, which they'll then fill to make sure the tooth doesn't split further.|`|tRNtFNHLaa	does not grow back. <br>  Go see your dentist|`|6V7HjW3Baa	It won't grow back.  You can go to the dentist and they can use composite tooth bonding to replace the part of the tooth that broke off.  The dentist finds a shade of composite that matches the color of the tooth so it would look natural.
621c01ff89d8c24a7a1267f985d93492aa	It depends on the guy. If he is young and has a nice 6 pack--he should be shaved. But if it is a older guy like in his 30s-40s its sexy when they have a little hair.|`|y2XKYhsyaa	i like a medium amount of hair. but i would never ask a guy to shave his chest. i think it takes away his manliness.|`|uajH0boKaa	hairy is gross i like my men shaved on there chest there face and there lower half i think its sexy ; D|`|Ghx5Excaaa	u mite wana out that under womens health|`|iUUSDgITaa	Well, a shaven chest is nice, but personally, I like to know that my man has hit puberty. So as long as it's not like a huge bush and a half (lol), a little hair is nice. :]|`|feO6SIfTaa	I know alot of guys like to think all women like their men with some hair on their chest but personally I don't I think it's sexier when they shave, you look cleaner and feel smoother.|`|GJLYgkw3aa	I personally like a little hair. I don't like it when my man looks like he is wearing a hair shirt!|`|btNoRiPWaa	girls in the MENS HEALTH section. lol|`|Q5qpMLOVaa	Some do, some don't.<br>  <br>  In this generation, *most* girls like a guy with just a bit of hair, but not all of them are the same.|`|pNgsP3sLaa	Shaved is too prickly unless you do it like, every 12 hours.. And even then, I never liked it because it looks too unnatural. My BF used to do it. I felt a little gay. Then he stopped (I didn't ask him too) and I decided I liked unshaved much better.<br>  <br>  Besides, I kind of like cuddling in his "fur!" =P It's soft.
RP2QQXbjaa	It depends on your diet as well as the factors you listed.  If you are getting enough vitamins in your diet, some of the supplemental vitamins would be unnecessary and would basically be flushed out of your system (ie. water soluble vitamins)  Also, for certain vitamins, only certain amounts are able to be absorbed by your body in a given period of time, so a larger amount of these would be pointless as well.  <br>  <br>  I suggest you consult you doctor to work out the best vitamin(s) that would work for you.|`|2e853def177f0dc358c1df8eb4484cc5aa	we dont need more vitamins than we are getting in our foods<br>  extra vit C ,E is usually all that is needed if we eat right<br>  eat veggies and fruits<br>  if our bodies dont need the vits they just pass through us and we waste money|`|FqOewVGcaa	add vitamin c chewables and that is all you need right now|`|ItXgAoo4aa	Multi-Vitamin, Fish Oil (Before Bed) Soy-Protein<br>  <br>  Boom.

There are so many different formulas out there that I am sure if you look around or ask your doctor or pharmacist someone can recommend one for your specific needs.
mI4lrKdHaa	Too late I am afraid. Be cool, and if you have to stand your ground try a few of these zingers; "yeah I was choking my chicken but all the time I was thinking of your girlfriend" or ' big deal you jerk off when your mom has a shower' or " Hey  if I knew it was such a big deal I would have let you do it for me' or how about 'if masturbation is that bad you would have killed yourself by now you wanker..........cheers......next time wait for the bell|`|72iZuDjeaa	good grief,,, you both need to grow up john... DON'T MASTURBATE IN A PUBLIC PLACE, ESPECIALLY AT SCHOOL!  and don't give the loser the money either, denial is your middle name right now... convince yourself that you didn't do it and never do it again!|`|AOPuoo16aa	WOW you better pay up and stop jerking it at school.|`|Cu0zrPWDaa	You really can't wait until you get home?|`|SS5py9jIaa	Dont give him $20. Tell the school counsellor that the dude is extorting you and you feel the school is no longer a safe environment. Adults know that teenagers masturbate, there's no shame in it... it's just unfortunate that this jerk saw you. Anyway, why was he lurking around.. is he into watching? So far as I'm concerned he is the one with a problem. Blackmail and extortion is a criminal offence.|`|N4xCsAznaa	I have never been caught, but i have masturbated a few times at school, how did you get caught, did you not do it in a locked cubicle or summit!    And I would pay him off, or you are a gonna be a bit embarrassed!<br>  <br>  add me:<br>  tskoda@hotmail.co.uk|`|DsrdNQG7aa	well i dont think you shouldd give him moneyy. jus let him tell and just deny it too peoplee and its no big deal everyone does it.<br>  <br>  talk to me on aim or yahoo messenger im 14<br>  <br>  imprettycool94|`|irIk1saFaa	You need to stop jerkin off in school.  That is something personal that should be done in private on your own time.|`|3AY5lS9saa	Paying him $20 will confirm your guilt and may not stop there. Just deny it and ignore him.|`|jpH4IjWnaa	You shouldn't do that in school, anyway! It's a private thing and should be done in private.|`|to8CkYp2aa	Tell him that if he tells, you'll masturbate on his locker. Keep the $20.|`|QT8vmBfsaa	deny it, or u can pay the kid...he's prob. guna tell everyone if u pay him though??.... but u do not wanna be that kid.|`|Q3dVyWpEaa	Just deny it to the death.  Don't admit it ever, not even to that kid.  Also, if you're dumb enough to give him ANY money at all, you'll deserve it when he tells people that not only did he catch you masturbating, but you paid him $20 dollars not to tell people, that just proves that you did it, really.  Would you rather be the kid that people hear masturbated in school, which they probably won't believe (and will only remember for a week), or would you rather be the kid who got caught masturbating and tried to hide it by paying the guy 20 bucks not to tell people?<br>  <br>  Don't admit it to anyone, since he's already told people, the money won't change anything, if it's going to get around it will get around anyways, those people will likely spread that information regardless of what you think about it.  Just deny it.|`|7b584d0019bc6acb60c89a84016c0c6caa	Well I am not sure what more you can really do.  I wouldn't pay him the $20 since from what you said, he already told a few people.  I would say the only thing you can do is take him down with you.  Tell everyone that he was watching you do it.  Technically it is the truth since you said he caught you, but how long was he really watching?  Hmm...?   Not sure if this answer really helps you.  Let me know if this helps.  The advice might not be great but it can make you think about really what to do next.|`|iUUSDgITaa	Lol well if you got caught, live up to it and make it a joke. Yea, it sucks, and next time you should do it in private. But if people are going to make fun of you, make a joke out of it.<br>  <br>  Haha!|`|unLtd3jYaa	If you pay him, he'll probably still tell everyone.  You just gotta deal with him telling everyone, after a while it'll blow over.  & next time don't masturbate in school.  That's a private matter to do at home.|`|k2bjQzMfaa	But you were the kid who was masturbating in school...think before you act. But dude, its only 20$. Pay it then kick his *** if he goes back on his word.|`|8MhrcU5Zaa	Don’t care. Everyone do Masturbating. Since he is a kid and he doesn’t know|`|ZDBQNLHdaa	dont freaking masturbate in school next time....|`|LhPOaxlqaa	lol wow dude kick his ***|`|QzWVf9pbaa	Why the hell did u do it in school...|`|JEteneuUaa	Dude your my f*u*k*g HERO!|`|AA10350894	Just play it off, if some one confronts you about it you can either deny it or own up to it.<br>  Denying it will be easier if he was the only witness, cause then it's just your word against his, if so... go ahead and deny it but don't make a big deal about it either.<br>  Owning up to it could work too, if you act like it was no big deal and that you couldn't care less what others say or think, they'll most likely drop it after some time.<br>  OR<br>  You could pay him the 20 bucks, but that won't stop him from telling anybody, and he may come back for more money! If it were me, I'd tell him this, "Yeah, ok I'll give you 20 bucks, but do you want it before or after I kick your F'ing @ss?"
bl8co4hUaa	I used to suffer from anxiety attacks, and subsequently learned a few tricks that do help.<br>  <br>  1.  Reduce the amount of caffeine you consume. Caffeine worsens the problem.<br>  2.  Reduce the amount of sugar you consume.<br>  3.  When you feel the symptoms coming on, take a long, slow, deep breath. Then several slow, deep breaths. Tell yourself, "Oh, I know *exactly* what this is. Nothing is wrong. Nothing is wrong with me. I'm fine." The slow, measured breathing should help you relax.<br>  4.  Then laugh aloud at it. Just a small laugh will do. Shake it off.<br>  <br>  These help, but if the problem persists despite this, seek the advice of someone in the medical profession.|`|Cvx7disWaa	I suffered alot from them after returning from Iraq. Docs dosed me with every pill under the sun to include highly addictive ones. I finally came across a VERY EFFECTIVE method of controlling them myself DRUG FREE. Check out the link below|`|3Q1ofzZPaa	try and control your breathing when you think you are about to have one, breathing techniques can actually cure panic attacks, you should go see someone about it because they can get worse and start to prevent you from actually going out, i would know from personal experience, i did not want to take meds for it so i saw a psychologist for breathing relaxation techniques, and they cured me from having panic attacks, i know it sounds crazy but if you give it a chance it will really work. panic attacks are caused because adrenaline is being realsed in your brain when you don't need it so a panic response is induced when you shouldn't be having one. <br>  <br>  good luck tomorrow, just try and tell yourself you are in a safe environment and nothing bad is going to happen to you and try to control your breathing|`|PkTxon3haa	do you have other symptoms besides the ones you mentioned? like chest pain, choking sensation, shaking, stomach cramps, and great fear? panic attacks usually have those symptoms, otherwise it could be something else or you're just nervous about sleeping in a strange place and hearing strange sounds.
nhLvrVx9aa	Yeah it's really hard to hide the smell. Even air fresheners don't help to much.<br>  I come home from the bowling ally after a night of bowling and my clothes smell really bad.<br>  <br>  Nothing against smokers...I just hate smelling it. If you want to smoke, please respect other peoples feelings.|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	You can't, Bubba!  You're screwed & haven't even been kissed if you think you can smoke & hide the smell from your parents.|`|3AY5lS9saa	You can try room sprays etc but you can't really hide the smell, a non smoker will smell it a mile away so will a smoker|`|Ghx5Excaaa	ciggarette smoke and weed stick to clothing so the only thing u can do is spray other smells on u and if the smell is still there put on lotion that has a strong scent...and if that doesnt work put on deoderant and if that doesnt work brush your teeth and make sure your breath doesnt smell like it and yea that should do it|`|6c694750ebd6aa4c9fc2901e8ad350a3aa	I smoke a pack a day so I dont bother hiding the smell|`|mfMDwHfLaa	put it in ur mouth|`|8MhrcU5Zaa	don't smoke
nwuL7M7saa	Out of the ordinary a bleeding mole can occur. There are many reasons why a mole bleeds. A bleeding mole can be caused by irritation while a mole is scratched or rubbed off with the skin or clothing. It could be caused by an accident while shaving the skin with a razor blade. Some people have hairs on moles that are unsightly and they usually trim or cut the hairs with scissors or tweezers. This will not remove the hairs permanently and eventually the hairs will grow back again. As the new moles grow the mole becomes itchy. Some people may unconsciously pick or scratch the skin. A bleeding mole may or may not pose a medical threat but to be sure, see a dermatologist.|`|2e853def177f0dc358c1df8eb4484cc5aa	you should have it checked out asap<br>  bleeding moles are not normal|`|TCFX0S5oaa	I have a mole on my face by my ear and sometimes when I wake up in the morning there is dried blood on it.<br>  <br>  Just read this information:<br>  Most moles should be normal and cause no problems however on certain occasions there are changes in the moles that warrant a visit to the dermatologist’s office. On some aspect a bleeding mole is warning sign that the mole is dangerously linked to melanoma. The risks involved in bleeding mole can be determined by the dermatologist. If you have a slight doubt and you are not sure why your moles bleed you have to see a doctor. The bleeding mole should be checked by a dermatologist to detect skin cancer. Usually a biopsy is required to find out the size of the tumor prior to removal.<br>  <br>  A bleeding mole that is of cancerous nature is usually associated with other symptoms such as itching, swelling, and a mole that do not heal easily. These visual symptoms have other indications such as scattered border or rough mole edges. Other cases of cancerous moles show moles that have more than one color; the other part is darker and the other part is lighter with different color combination in it. Moles that are not symmetrical on both sides are potential for melanoma and moles that grow larger than the pea size is dangerous. With these indicators it is obvious that the bleeding mole had developed into melanoma and should be removed as soon as possible before it metastasize and spread to other parts and organs of the body.<br>  <br>  <br>  I supose that you and I need to get these moles checked. Good luck!|`|8466ee3d8aec016c639737d732471435aa	Not to alarm yes (I had a bleeding mole and the news wasn't good) the positive part was thanks to it bleeding it saved my life.<br>  <br>  Go get it looked after.|`|Lqy9Lc9Oaa	No, they can bleed.

Could well be nothing but it is not worth the risk . I would go to the doctors as soon as you can.
6JCbISbnaa	Shes about normal|`|Q5qpMLOVaa	Worrying about your weight at that age is ridiculous. It's quite normal to be pretty thin at that age, and considering most kids are underweight, it makes things even worst for those that are a little more on the thin side.|`|yqy5xfSbaa	definitely underweight. when i was 10 i was about 80 pounds...so she's underweight|`|avpv7u8saa	She is very skinny|`|vEVtXftTaa	I didn't weigh 80 pounds until I was in junior high school, and I'm actually a girl who can make that kind of comparison.

9pLdhuBnaa	Yes, it is very possible that he may have damaged something in his neck but the only way to know for sure is to see a doctor for further evaluation of the situation.

All races may get this disease, but it is more common in the black population.   We still don't know exactly what causes this, but it is likely that an autoimmune response is at play.  This means that the body's own protective systems for whatever reasons attack the pigment producing cells called Melanocytes.   This cause a "bleached" area of the skin.  Chemical exposure has also been known to cause this.  <br>  <br>  Because of the cosmetic problems of this disease treatment by a Dermatologist should be seen as soon as possible.  Non medical treatments should include the use of sunscreen very liberally with every exposure to the sun.  <br>  <br>  Drugs which target the immune system can also be used in treatment such as corticosteroids and others such as Tacrolimus or Sirolimus.  The herb ginko biloba has also been shown in some clincial studies to slow the progression of Vitiligo.|`|25a10833583e41e85028e6e4fd50a5f1aa	Has she had her ears checked?

TBD6SPaTaa	Hi there,rihannafan.  What you should do is to attend her funeral services with your family.  There you can pay your respects to your grandmother's friend.  You will feel alittle better knowing that you had said your goodbyes to her.  It's sad to lose someone close to the family.  Even if it might've been just a friend.  You are a really sweet person.  If I was this person who had past on,I would want you to continue living happily.  I'd want you to smile,I'd want you to laugh,I'd want you to enjoy life to it's fullest.  Not to worry about me or feel sad over me.  That isn't the way to go through life.  I'm sure this friend truly loved your grandmother.  And she would want you and your grandmother to be happy for her.  She is in a better place now.  I bet in Heaven,She is just doing all the wonderful stuff she couldn't down here.  She will be taken care of.  I hope this has cheered you up somewhat.  And if not,I am so sorry.  You are so thoughtful,You know that?  Have a goodnight tonight,Okay?  Take care and God bless.  Bye for now.|`|ZZN3c5vNaa	Hey, I'm really sorry to hear about that.<br>  I've had a few experiences like this myself and the best advice I was given was to think about how much happier she is now where she is, if she's died it obviously means she wasn't well or it was just her time.

You will have had your "worry time" for the day, and can just write down any more thoughts that come to mind, and say to yourself: "Well, I'll just have to worry about that tomorrow, won't I?". It's important to regularly monitor, and deal with a negative internal monologue (self talk), or mental process, such as disturbing thoughts, images, impulses, or emotions, by the process of (a): recognising it, and (b): challenging it immediately. Technique For Re-Programming Negative Thoughts: When you notice something negative, such as: "I can't do this/ am never going to get over this!" or: "Why am I always so pathetic/useless/such a loser?" or even an image, emotion, or a memory; recognise that it is being generated from the negative part of your mind. Having identified and labelled it, visualise a large, red, flashing, "STOP!" sign, and/or possibly a stern faced person wagging an index finger at you in a negative manner, then say to yourself as forcefully as you can, even aloud in a big voice, if alone: "I know this tactic: GO AWAY FOR A WHILE !!!" You may want to use either: "ruse", "ploy", "game", or "trick". In the case of an image, visualise a large "STOP" sign, or your preferred version. <br>  <br>  Some people go so far as to keep a wide rubber band in their pocket, then put it around their wrist, when they catch themselves backsliding, stretch and release it, as a method of reprogramming their mind sooner, but I don't regard it as being strictly necessary. Remember to remove it, afterwards, if you use this method. Try replacing a negative thought with a positive affirmation of your choice, like: "I am a unique individual, with my own set of skills, and good points", or "I may not be perfect, but I'm doing the best I can, right now". Practice one of the relaxation methods in sections 11, 2, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed. Tai Chi, or yoga suits others better. Give the EFT a good tryout, to see if it helps you. There is a version for use in public places, (you can claim to have a headache, as you massage/lightly tap your temples, but you would then be restricted to subvocalising: saying it to yourself in your mind). Section 53, at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> refers: "Even though I sometimes suffer from anxiety, I deeply and completely accept myself." Or Google: "neurofeedback; therapists" Herbal remedies, such as chamomile, passionflower, or St. John's wort, are often effective, but the idea is (as with anxiolytic medication) to use them like water wings, or training wheels on a bicycle, providing initial support, and giving time for other treatments, such as therapy, and relaxation techniques, to take effect.|`|WpqwaqcQaa	sounds like you need to talk to someone.<br>  <br>  maybe get some meds.<br>  <br>  maybe you just need to get out more.

t2R3mEMoaa	I lost my brother and 2 very dear friends to suicide over these past few years. It's very hard to deal with because there is so much anger involved when someone takes their own life. To make a long story short, I have always felt there is nothing that bad or devastating that if talked about, people together can't work out. Death is so final, and then nothing gets resolved, it just adds more heartache to those who are left behind. There is always, always an alternative to one committing suicide. On the other side of the coin, when there are mental health issues involved (known or unknown) in the individual that does this, it takes another turn in trying to deal with the grief that one feels afterword. But no matter what, we always end up blaming ourselves thinking we could have done something or been a little more aware to others problems. This is also part of the grieving process.|`|O8pJYz5Kaa	I would say if u die right now i am going with u and then threaten them or some thin so they don't do it!|`|e7ace19383856f6361f6f85be215c636aa	My brother committed suicide.

The best way to clean out your body for a drug test is to go to your local GNC or VITAMIN WORLD and get a detox.

All of the tests missed this, and she was seeing a gastroenterologist!<br>  <br>  Removing the gall bladder stopped the vomiting, and allowed her to regain some of the 70 pounds she had lost during this ordeal. She very nearly died.<br>  <br>  As another person has already suggested, you may have an inner ear disorder.<br>  <br>  It could be stress, H pylori, a neurological disorder, or any number of things.<br>  <br>  I would strongly advise seeking out new physicians who are in no way affiliated with each other, or to the hospital in which you have had your tests, or where they might have privileges.<br>  <br>  It's time now to start fresh in seeking a diagnosis. I am very sorry that you are having to go through this.  I've seen it, and I have some understanding as to just how difficult this is for you. Again, I feel for you. This has got to be unbearable.<br>  <br>  I have no advice as to how to relieve  the vomiting.<br>  <br>  Only the best to you, and hang in there. This problem has a solution, it's just a matter of finding it. I hope you are feeling better soon.<br>  <br>  ((((((((( Big hugs)))))))))|`|s1zitZMOaa	I don't vomit except in extremely rare circumstances (I have to be so sick I allow it to happen) so I've tried every idea one can come up with to not or stop vomiting. 2 things that work well for me are -<br>  1. Breathe in through your nose, out through your mouth. Do this with slow, deep breaths until the nausea passes. <br>  2. Emetrol - it's an anti-nausea liquid, can be found in any drug store or pharmacy section of places like a grocery store or Walmart, and it really does work well. <br>  <br>  This assumes that you have nausea before you vomit. Someone already mentioned this but if your doctors haven't checked you for H. Pylori they need to. I've had two friends that suffered from random vomiting and terrible gastrointestinal problems in general and in both cases, H. Pylori was the cause. One of them I remember would be feeling fine and then just vomit out of the blue almost. She'd have maybe a 5 second warning before it happened. Here's a link  <a href="http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/hpylori/" rel="nofollow">http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases...</a><br>  Just something to consider because docs don't normally check for it.|`|ZIq2IzOmaa	Have you had anyone check out your ears? There are some disorders in the inner ear that can cause diziness and nausea. You may also want to have the rest of your head and neck checked. There are some problems where the brain can shift inside the skull/cervical vertebrae and cause vomiting when the brainstem is compressed. <br>  <br>  There are some medications that will stop vomiting, so talk to your doctor about them. Unfortunately the only one I've ever taken myself was when I was about 9 for strep throat and it was a supository. But man did it work, so it was worth it.|`|13k2WKx8aa	Does it happen at around the same time everyday?<br>  <br>  Stress could be a cause. It's also been so prolonged at this point that it has become habitual. Sounds strange, but the same thing can be found with coughing in chronic bronchitis patients.<br>  <br>  If it happens at around the same time everyday, try this for a bit. Take a couple of Benadryl and take a nap at around that time. No more than an hour really. Make sure you're hydrated and the like. Sleep through that hour. The Benadryl will help knock yo out. Be sure to set an alarm to wake you up. You could also take some pepto bismol with it just in case. Just don't get freaked when your tongue turns black for a bit. Brush and it goes away. ;-)<br>  <br>  I'm going with the GI. It's psychological, not physical.|`|ab2f66e8a13e1ac5cc285faefb061f12aa	Ice chips - crush ice and let dissolve in your mouth it usually calms nausea quickly. It may be stress or viral but the "investigation" is making things worse. You should also try melba toast (very dry toast) no butter and when you drink only have iced beverages. Avoid caffeine, so no coffee or tea and stay far from gatorade, soda and those type drinks instead add 1 tablespoon of salt to 1 quart of water and freeze into cubes to suck on alternately with non salted ice. You can have juice but be sure to ice it. Simple clear broths, applesauce, banana and once you feel up to it "poached" eggs and chicken breast. A simple bland diet usually corrects your system in 7 days. Good Luck!|`|adb009bb7026fa990c0936cae97cb432aa	How old are you?  Maybe your hormones are making you sick.  Have your doctor check your hormone levels to see if they are normal.  Also, if you are a girl, keep a journal for a month or two of your symptoms to see if they get worse or better at different times of the month.  If it is your hormones, as your system cycles, you might expect to see differences in symptoms.|`|hceNM6Uxaa	Given all that has happened to you in your life, the level of illness and intervention and being right on the edge of life and death, and the fact that you have coped with determination, fought through everything against the odds (I've heard this from a friend of yours - you often downplay!) - I would suggest that your whole inner being is trying to express the level of trauma which you've managed pretty comprehensively to suppress, in order to survive.  And because you are psychologically keeping everything absolutely controlled, your inner self has to use the physical route to express it.  <br>  <br>  The form of medicine that understands and can deal with this is homeopathy.  It uses an approach which is inclusive of all aspects of the self.  It's had a bad press in recent years, many people are sceptical - I can only say that I've seen astounding results (not always, but more often than chance) and strongly recommend it.  Of course it's important to get someone good.  Go through NASH (North American Society of Homeopaths).

(Bananas, rice, applesauce and toast) When I was 21 I had a ton of stomach problems due to stress. It got to the point where I had very little "good" bacteria in my stomach and I wasn't digesting my food properly. Those 4 foods are pretty mild and won't upset your stomach, and the yogurt helps restore the good bacteria. <br>  <br>  I stuck to it for 3 days and then I started eating other non-irritating food like grains, fruits, veggies, and yogurt. After a week the nausea and vomiting  stopped. <br>  <br>  I don't know if it will work for you, but it might be worth a try. You can't stay on it very long because those foods lack nutrients and fiber.|`|GcnujfHhaa	I learned this from my school nurse.<br>  Always drink Ginger ale it soothes you stomach acid.<br>  eat potatoes (baked) it helps you sooth you throat.<br>  And drink milkshakes.(vanilla).|`|HSaVBaiaaa	Damn, sorry not to be useful, but that really sucks.|`|rHqe7oMoaa	I find dry white toast (no crusts) works well for me.|`|pNrDyNKAaa	Stay cold.

Vicodin is a good pain reliever but can make you feel sick and give you a headache, not to mention it is very addictive. I prefer Motrin, you can take up to 800 mg ( 4 200mg otc pills).|`|Fn6vayT4aa	its not safe at all some people take it as a drug to get "high" i wouldnt take it unless you are in very very very very bad pain|`|1e6KVeBDaa	Vicodin is very safe. All painkillers are safe. These side effects like heart attacks come from abuse from the drug and what it potentially can do to you. But these side effects RARELY happen. Vioxx is probably a different painkiller that either uses a different opiate other than hydrocodone which is in Vicoden. Or it has a different pain reliever other than APAP which is in Vicodin also (also in Tylenol).  You are safe taking any painkiller just dont take more than the doctor prescribes. And also i think Advil is much better than Motrix, and it is alot safer since it uses ibuprofen (very safe drug).

iAv9P3HTaa	Hello, <br>  <br>  The doctor may describe you medication is so watch out for side effects.If they are overwhelming request other type of pills.<br>  <br>  Hey,<br>  <br>  You are having panic attacks.<br>  Use these simple steps over and over again until you become the master of your thoughts and emotions.You create your panic attacks not your environment .<br>  Take full responsibility.<br>  <br>  I was suffering from panic attacks for 14 years.<br>  I did a lots of research and reading on the subject.<br>  <br>  Here is a six-step approach to self-control when dealing with an  anxiety attack:<br>  <br>  1.ACCEPT--Recognize that you are feeling anxious.Accept your body feelings as a symptom of your anxiety and a sign that something is bothering you.<br>  <br>  2.PERMISSION--Give yourself permission to feel anxious about whatever it is that is bothering you."Of course I feel anxious because.... and it is okay to have anxiety.I know what this is and why I feel this way."<br>  <br>  3.BREATHE-- First, inhale through your nose slowly for two-seconds,mentally counting one, one-thousand, two ,one- thousand.then exhale through your mouth to mental count of four-second-again by one-thousands.Do this for at least 60-seconds.<br>  <br>  4.INNER DIALOGUE--Use truthful, positive dialogue to talk yourself through  the anxious time.It WILL pass. Examples of dialogue might be,"It's just anxiety.It will go away. I will not lose control.<br>  I can still go about my business feeling spaced-out.It won't hurt me."<br>  <br>  5.DISTRACT--Get busy.Do something to release some of this self-induced stimulation.Your body is like a car in high gear with the brakes on .Don't just sit there! Walk,jog, clean closets -but do something.Distract yourself from the way you are feeling.<br>  <br>  6.LET TIME PASS-- and try to see a little humor in the way you feel.You may feel weird ,you don't look weird.Give yourself permission to feel weird for a little while. It is no big deal.Try to figure out what is really bothering you. Is it some type of conflict that you don't want to deal with?Is it a scary thought? Is it a ridiculous expectation you have about yourself? How about the television program you watched  last night?What is bothering  you?<br>  <br>  <br>  It takes time and lots and lots of practice.But the only way to stop fearing panic and anxiety attacks is to experience them .Then, work your way through them and begin to see that they won't hurt you.<br>  <br>  There is no need to avoid or fight .<br>  <br>  YOU are your safe place and your safe person .<br>  YOU can make yourself feel better.<br>  <br>  Feel good!<br>  <br>  Praise to Lucinda Bassett !|`|S5FZy9Ppaa	yes, you need zanax, i take that for the same thing you have...............|`|wPXwC7Ufaa	I can probably help you with this.

What CBTs do is try to get you to change your thinking and behaviors so that you no longer have troubling thoughts that can lead to OCD, panic attacks, etc.<br>  <br>  But that wasn't working so well either, so finally I was put on Zoloft, which has worked WONDERS.

QzQ9rEnHaa	I personally don't think it's genetic. I have a lazy eye myself. Yet, no one on either side of my family has a lazy eye..|`|fcbf59d3765fc40afec4d3523db17ba8aa	It is both genetic and influenced by other things. Your baby will be more likely to have a lazy eye but it isn't definite, and if he/she does it might not be as bad as yours. When I say "influenced by other things" I mean it can be changed.|`|WUfJaIOHaa	Yes it is genetic.I have one and so does my son.But it is hardly noticeable.
2Y9pejG6aa	When I meditate, I try to focus on my breath.  If you wet the part of your face just below your nose and then breathe slowly in and out through your nose, then just concentrate on the feeling of your cold breath, it is a good way to relax and meditate.|`|ROIMWQlVaa	you tube zen garden
9pLdhuBnaa	These symptoms that you are noticing can be an indication of something like a heart problem (an example only).<br>  <br>  This is something to be concerned about.  I would recommend seeing your doctor for further evaluation of the situation to see what they say.
dBj1GurBaa	Ive had the same issues. I know this may sound typical but writing in a notebook can really help. just write write write what ever your feeling or just on your day. Something else i used to do was cardio Kickboxing. It helped me keep my mind of things and i felt better about myself. You don't have to do something like that but just like an extra curricular activity. Such as the gym, art class, things like that.|`|1ZsIEzrRaa	Journal writing. I know it doesn't sound like it'd work, but I tried it.<br>  <br>  The feeling is like peeling things out of your mind and putting them on the page. Write about how you feel, everything. It helps so much. Sometimes, if I was really angry, I'd draw people in my journal with black holes where their hearts were, etc. Lol it was good fun.|`|0231d2843faa4847a6c7ee14ea2b73f5aa	Get into some type of martial arts.

I814g6ZBaa	The best COMBO to keep them at bay is a scrub 2x/day with salicylic acid, followed by a lotion with benzoyl peroxide.  Neutrogena has a good kit (both my daughters & I use it) but you could put together your own pair.<br>  A warm, hot compress will help bring it up.  <br>  Make sure you are cleaning that needle before you stick it in your skin!<br>  Don't use your fingernails when pressing!<br>  Use a medication right after.<br>  Hang in there, Kiddo!!!  :)|`|q40toPNOaa	I would definitely put a moist warm towel on it.  This will make it come to a head and be easier to release the fluid that is trapped inside.  As for the needle, I'm not sure that is the best idea to put on your face especially because it may contain bacteria and germs that could infect the site or worsen the issue.  After you put the warm towel on then just let it sit.  Try to refrain from touching your face, especially that area, for a while and when you feel like you can take care of it, then do it.  <br>  <br>  Hope I helped you!<br>  Good Luck! It WILL go away, don't worry!|`|cWenZqsfaa	you can put some peroxide on it.. it'll dry it out... or and i like using these daily.. after my shower and before i go to bed - its called OXYpads... they also have face scrub and i think a body wash.. but i like the pads just wash off your make up and run that over quick it'll pick up any other make up and clean dirt on your face.. and keep with it. Ive been using that for a while now and when i get my per. i hardly if i do break out.|`|REoNMbanaa	try using a spot treatment with benozyl peroxide. its stronger than salycilic acid. just give it time, wash your face twice daily, and remember to keep your hands off it because the oils on your hands will only make it bigger.|`|Kdag2NMyaa	that happened to me once not nice is it lmao, i wet tissue in very warm water and held it there to soften it then squeezed it, but hold on the hot water for a while.<br>  good luck with the popping!|`|rV4uJVWmaa	I wouldnt F with it until its come to a nice head.

nF0Eaa2Gaa	There are no STD's that has the acronyms SLC. It's pretty important that you remember what's going on with you when the doctor is giving you a diagnosis, even ask questions if you have to. <br>  <br>  I'm sure he/she has given you treatment though for what ever it is including that chlamydia which can be treated with 10 days of doxycycline or 1 dose of azithromycin. If you're still unsure of what was said then you can call the advice nurse from the facility that you visited and they may be able to pull up your file.
u935HFEoaa	Depression is a very serious condition.  Only a health care provider can diagnose you.  Tell mom you want to go to the doctor and then discuss it with him. He can tell you what is going on and what you can do about it.  <br>  There are many ways to treat depression if that is what is going on.  You can live a happy, fulfilling, meaningful life.  Tell mom you just want to talk to someone. If she does not take you seriously, talk to your guidance counselor.<br>  God bless you! :)|`|FQcWqRgxaa	Go and talk to a therapist, but make sure your Mom understands that it has to be confidential what you say to your therapist.  Also, be careful that you don't go to a priest or friend of your Mom.  Sometimes, if your family is friends with someone who's trying to counsel you, you might get advice that is influenced by your family.  Just go, and talk, and you might feel better.  There are things you can do on your own to get better, such as exercise, and eat healthy foods.  Try to get rest only at night.  Get up at the same time every day of the week, even if you don't have to be anywhere.  If worse comes to worse, try medication.  But, leave that for a last alternative.|`|Yc6eUIW9aa	You might not need a therapist.  You can talk to your local doctor and he will describe depression symptoms to you.  If your depressed he will prescribe you medication.<br>  ..|`|w6DJj1a8aa	just laugh and watch this it made me laugh and snapped out of it a little bit <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s9mNjFC7lA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s9mNjFC7...</a>|`|Ne7xr36Saa	Mike, this one is very easy.....get to a Dr.   You can go to your family Dr. first....be sure to tell him exactly how often you feel down. In fact start a "journal" and make sure you write in it every single day. From the min. you wake up till you go to bed at night. Including eating habits. Depression isn't just something that some people "snap out of". Take advantage if your family has insurance, now! Do what your Dr. says and if you feel you have emotional "issues" and feel that you should talk with someone then ask to not just put you on meds, but to send you to a therapist to make sure you are doing the right things.  Good luck to you and don't ever feel that it is your fault that you are depressed.
kGJND4lYaa	Anger is a chemical reaction in the brain.<br>  <br>  It can be caused by heavy-metal toxicity, yeast, chemical sensitivity.<br>  <br>  If taking 750mg GABA calms you down, you need to look for the underlying cause of the brain chemical problems.

Glucocorticoids are made in the outside portion (the cortex) of the adrenal gland and chemically classed as steroids. Cortisol is the major natural glucocorticoid.

t2R3mEMoaa	Some people have had severe reactions to mixing prescriptions with herbal medicine, and yes it can be life threatening. It would be best if you talked it over with your pharmacist first, or a homoeopathic specialist.If you want to use herbal medicine to treat your same disorder, then it would be wise to stay off your meds for at least 30 days just to make sure they are out of your system. I will tell you though, it has been my experience that it takes much longer and with a much higher dose of herbs to achieve the same affects as a prescription. Both have their pros and cons. Investigate thoroughly before you make any choice. take care & good mental health|`|9EVcTnUWaa	DO not mix any medications with herbal medicines as they can cause life threatening affects.  What some people forget is that even though herbs are natural they can have side affects also especially when used with other meds.  Talk to your doctor or go to the library or bookstore and get a copy of the PDR or Physicians Desk Reference which doctors use to keep track of the new medications and the side effects of them.  Your best bet is your doctor.|`|0Kc76e8Laa	I wouldn't advise it. Ask your doctor first.

Schizophrenic voices are unmistakenly wholly other and not of your own mind.<br>  <br>  Cut out your exposure to sensational horror movies and shows and read a good wholesome book or two like "Little women" by Louisa Mae Alcott.

YayTJZltaa	They have mold test kits at Lowes and/or Home Depot....it's a little costly, but worth it to know for sure.<br>  <br>  Mold comes in many different colors and textures (green, black, wet-ish, powdery), so you really can't go on just looking at it.<br>  <br>  Ask your landlord to cover maybe half the cost of the test, just deduct it from your rent. Make sure it's in writing though so they can't go back and claim you didn't pay in full that month.<br>  <br>  They need to fix it, it's a health concern.<br>  <br>  If they don't want to fix it, contact your local housing board and the department of health. File grievances with both making it clear that you are not going to be ignored. Continue to contact them until something gets done.<br>  <br>  You do have the right to live in a safe, healthy environment. You also have the right to leave at any time, without penalty since you are renting, if your dwelling is un-safe and un-healthy.<br>  <br>  Your landlord CAN NOT keep you in this dwelling knowing full well exactly what's going on and failing to act. They will need to allow you to break the lease and should give you your entire security deposit back too.<br>  <br>  If you still can't afford to leave even with the security deposit being given back, and no early termination fee for breaking the lease, this is where the housing authority comes in handy. Since they will already be aware of the situation, they are a lot more likely to help you find proper assistance to get you into a healthy environment (or maybe help the landlord with the cleaning expense so you wouldn't even need to worry about moving).<br>  <br>  Unfortunatly, you need to do the right thing here and make it clear that you are not willing to be walked over. If that means taking someone to court, do so and do not have any shame in doing so.<br>  <br>  Now, if it's just mildew, get some bleach, clean it off and finish the job. If it's on a wall, repaint. If it's on tile, reseal the grout. If it's on carpet, shampoo it out, don't use bleach.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|60mDEusiaa	Well, if it's black, it's probably mildew. Green is probably mold.

I think ADD is a made up term for overactive people. Doctors are just stupid (not meaning the ones on here).|`|5678371c4d9925ba2d26e6ba9c43fca8aa	You might not have ADD, you might just get distracted easily - I used to have your same problem during tests and stuff (I don't have ADD) and I just trained myself to focus - one sentence at a time - and whenever I felt another thought pop into my head I made sure to refocus my attention on what the teacher or test was saying.  Whether you have ADD or not, keep training yourself to focus - you can do it.<br>  <br>  But, it sounds like you do have ADD.  A lot of people don't think it's a real syndrome, especially since so many people are suddenly being diagnosed with it (correctly or otherwise).  So it could be difficult to get your parents to believe you have it, and I'm sorry for that. But the best way to convince them is to get legitimate sources to back you up.<br>  <br>  First, do a lot of research.  Take out books on ADD or find some good websites about it.  Learn a lot about the symptoms.  This will first of all help YOU be sure if you have it or not.  But more importantly, you can highlight the reasons you think you have ADD and present it to your parents.  If you've got legitimate info to back yourself up to your parents when you tell them you have ADD, it will make it much easier for them to believe you.<br>  <br>  Also, don't rush to tell them, and don't do it in passing.  Take your time researching and getting together what you want to say.  Then, sit them down at a time when neither of you is preoccupied with other things.  Tell them you have something important to talk to them about, and go for it.<br>  <br>  Don't forget to mention what you want to do about your ADD - get treatment so you can solve your problem and do better in school and everything else.  Your parents want what's best for you, so reminding them that treatment can really help your grades etc. will help your case.<br>  <br>  I hope that works for you, but if it doesn't, plan B would be to try to get to a doctor on your own, I guess.  If you have a trusted older friend, teacher, or relative that can help you, that would be good.  They can also help you talk to your parents, who might be more inclined to listen to an adult than a kid.  See what the doctor says and if they want to prescribe treatment (which I think you need parental permission for) take your parents to talk to that doctor or tell them what the doctor says.<br>  <br>  If THAT doesn't work, then unfortunately I don't know what else you could do.  You're only two years away from adulthood, though... Until then, like I said, practice focusing on your own. You don't NEED ADD treatment to learn how to concentrate better - although it definitely would help.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you.|`|5ebd4e6eca996338994b8f4792b28742aa	You may have ADD, but it takes doctor and evaluations to determine that. I would try discussing it with your school counselor, if they feel like you have a learning disability that needs to be addressed they have an obligation to inform your parents and guide them in ways to help find a solution for you. If your parents hear it from a professional they may be more likely to look into it further.

9GUZzm5Saa	Oral sex is a form of sexual intercourse whereby a person will stimulate a partner’s vagina, in case of a woman, or penis when on a man, with the use of the mouth and tongue. When the oral sex is performed on a woman it is referred to as cunnilingus and when on a man it is referred to as fellatio. Oral sex can also be performed on the anus for stimulation purposes and this sexual act is referred to as analingus. Contrary to popular believe oral sex is not safe against every sexually transmitted disease, even when performed with extreme caution. Some of the more common diseases transmittable via oral sex include Chlamydia, gonorrhea, herpes and hepatitis. To minimize the risks of contamination the best solution is to use condoms and dental dams when performing or receiving oral sex.|`|2y3rFvZIaa	If your partner had a STD you could get a STD of the throat.

Feel your feelings now or they will come back to you to be dealt with at another time. I always recommend that a person write about how and why they are feeling this way, especially if one doesn't know. It is very therapeutic. This, like all other emotions will pass once it has run the course it is intended to do. Then there will be a time to be happy and I think you will find you feel much better than you did prior to.

sQu3LLqtaa	Avoiding carbohydrate foods with a high GI index such as corn flakes and white bread would help.  Carbohydrates with a low GI index such as beans and nuts are OK.  You can find further details in a web search for "glycemic index tables".<br>  <br>  Perhaps you might want to post your question in the Diabetes section under Diseases & Conditions under Health.|`|YayTJZltaa	Your doctor will likely run a blood test on you, more then likely fasting (you can not eat for 12 hours before the test so try and schedule it early in the day and remember not to eat anything in the few hours before bed).<br>  <br>  It depends on what your levels come out to be, and how long you might have had it as to what your doctor will have you do.<br>  <br>  If you are still young then you'll probably just need a change in diet, loose a little weight, and get more active. All positive things to do anyway and really not that hard to do either.<br>  <br>  Your doctor will likely have you add more fresh fruit and vegetables (don't be afraid of them, they taste GREAT if you prepare them correctly, some times just as is too), and reduce the sugar in your diet (this will include cutting back on soda/sports drinks and adding more water, not eating as many processed carbohydrates like white bread, and checking labels a lot more carefully since there's hidden sugar in a lot of food).<br>  <br>  You can still eat sweet things, but you'll need to be careful. Maybe replace white sugar with an alternate sweetener like Stevia (or one of the artificial sweeteners). Also, you'd be happily surprised as to how many sweets there are that really don't have any sweeter in it, sure they aren't as sweet as sugar sweet, but still they are fairly good.<br>  <br>  You don't really need to exercise daily, but adding 20 minutes of physical activity every day does help. Take a walk around the block, clean a messy room top-to-bottom, walk the dog a few extra blocks, dance around the house like no one is watching, walk quickly up and down the stairs a few times, for that matter take the stairs rather then the elevator if you can, run around with some kids or play on a playground like you are a kid....if you make the physical activity fun it really doesn't feel like work, but it all still helps!<br>  <br>  If you can get your blood levels down to normal by changing diet/activity level/loosing weight, then you won't need to worry about taking any medicine as long as you keep things up and get your levels checked as often as your doctor recommends.<br>  <br>  If, however, you can't do it with diet/activity/weight loss alone, you'll likely be put on some pills first. If that doesn't work then you might need insulin.<br>  <br>  Even after you are put on pills and/or insulin, you must still continue to watch your diet, loose weight, and keep your activity level up, it's not a "free pass" by any means.<br>  <br>  It is possible to reverse diabetes even after being put on pills and/or insulin, but at that point it'll be up to your will power and your doctors help.<br>  <br>  Whatever happens, don't really worry too much about it, you can still work on it after your diagnoses (it is NOT the end of your life).<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you!

Be that living in fear, worry, anxiety, loneliness etc etc.<br>  Start questioning your thoughts.. for example when you start worrying about leaving your home.. Say to yourself 'ok, why am I worrying, will anything happen to me' - will no because everyone lives their lives.. isolating yourself will make you feel even worse, so don't let problems answer problems, for that will never bring about positive answers - which is all you need hunny ..

Wash your undergarments daily in boiling water and dry them in hot sunshine.|`|2y3rFvZIaa	I would suggest a full STD screening.|`|94a46d94405353b1f3f1de9ec8eeca2aaa	There are a few different things it could be, but I recommend seeing your doctor for an evaluation.|`|giler9Wgaa	it could be a possibility but the only way to no for sure would be to go to the doctors and get it checked out|`|hCV5Hyqfaa	OHHHH NO!!!!! HOLY INCEST-ISM|`|Pdex43zgaa	You have caught the dreaded crotch rot.|`|3cd257219d02ccd18af7daee3e56f3fbaa	Your leaving out to much important information like, are you having any discharge?  Do you have a rash?  You really will need to see your family physician to have this evaluated and blood tests run if needed.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, Good Luck!|`|GnHoD884aa	It may be you have a yeast infection or you have soap on the tip. Anyway, go and see your doctor just to be certain|`|Dgzuolfgaa	its called a bellend.<br>  <br>  go to your GP|`|pgUfi7XMaa	i don't even know y i am answering this...but i will go away now...    :)|`|goWHVmp0aa	my tongue.
qMDLPvM3aa	move|`|ZVNtxUKTaa	Try reading about Islam..<br>  <br>  Drinking is against Islam.|`|EP0cAEo7aa	That sucks....<br>  That reminds me of my boyfriend's family. Pretty much every male (and some female) members of his family are druggies and alcoholics (or had been, which included my boyfriend). That's in Abington, PA btw. Even his dad pays his lawyer and landscaper with weed instead of money!! It's nuts!!!!!|`|vndz0WSEaa	i know this doesnt answer your question but i have relatives in north carolina and they're all drunks... my suggestion, give em fireworks! :D always fun haha
geyFgix2aa	Stay in School|`|QJHE3z1raa	you skip your period,<br>  have to pee alot<br>  or getting slightly bigger in the belly<br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|qT8yID3Taa	STOP SAYING "PREGO", IT'S CALLED PREGNANT.|`|hxNtYqoOaa	If you believe that you are mature enough to have sex, then you need to be mature enough to go buy a pregnancy test and find out for sure if you are pregnant.  But, you need to make sure to follow the instructions.  Many tests will not work until you are far enough along to have missed that first period, but some tests work earlier.  And, if you find out that you are pregnant, please do not try to hide if from your parents.  They may be mad at first, but you may be surprised at how supportive parents can be when their children are going through difficult times.<br>  <br>  If you find out you are not pregnant, I would still suggest seeing a doctor.  Having unprotected sex at your age exposes you to the risk of all sorts of sexually transmitted diseases.|`|JRRsjByCaa	you aren't going to know that you're pregnant unless you take a test. if you can have sex then you can take a test. and honestly, if you are having sex you can also tell your parents that.|`|doHNEvf8aa	if you don't get your period.<br>  also morning sickness, cravings and/or getting sick around certain foods, very BIG mood swings.|`|Px8urrAuaa	Go to the doctor and get a blood test?<br>  Seriously, stay in school.|`|vycAqfkiaa	How the HELL else are you going to know if your pregnant or not, if you dont take a prgnancy test? You have to take one to be sure sweetie. If you took the test and it keeps coming up PREGNANT then you ARE pregnant. Go to a planned parenthood clinic in your area, when you can get away from your parents and take a pregnancy test there. It is confidential, they wont call your parents, and it is free! Also, if you have not gotten your period at all, you feel sick in the morning, cant eat or smell certain foods, that also may be a sign. But it is not definite. Your period could be late and your body could just be going through changes. If I were you I would double up on pregnancy tests and take them in private. If you wait too long you will NOT be able to have an abortion, and your parents WILL find out. Make some moves quick young girl|`|uaHzhUeoaa	Well, if you missed your period, you could be pregnant. But there's really no way to tell for sure unless you give it enough time. And something else... it's really smart of you to not tell your parents yet. They're going to find out eventually (if you really are), but don't tell them until you're ABSOLUTELY SURE.|`|r9xiepo8aa	Im so sorry! Here are some signs. Your period never comes, morning sickness swollen or tender breasts,frequent urination, back aches, food cravings. I really hope this helps and you really AREN'T  pregnant.|`|DSzG23WRaa	Not going to tell your parents and not going to take a pregnancy test? My you say no to simple things. Too bad you didn't say no to the thing that got you in this situation in the first place.|`|xRVtS6yhaa	please just stfu and stop having sex.
hxNtYqoOaa	When you first get your period, it does take some time before your cycles are regular.  But, this sounds excessive.  I would recommend telling your parents and seeing your doctor.  It may be nothing, but wouldn't you feel more comfortable knowing that from a doctor?|`|dVAiuqZCaa	You need to tell your parents,bleeding more than 1 week per month could be a sign of a bigger problem.|`|ZkgyyikVaa	This is absolutely normal. It takes some time for a girl's period to become regular. It's probably very frustrating and one thing you can do is visit your doctor and tell them about your problem and they give you this pill which is kind of like birth control that gives you lighter shorter periods and helps get your period on track.
249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 What’s so funny about bovines? If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|1e4rVfwJaa	i started playing basketball in december with a possitive additude to running drills. i started eating better. notice everything you eat. that helped me alot. cut out sweets every other day. when it is that day, dont eat much. narrow your meals and excersice!!!!!
