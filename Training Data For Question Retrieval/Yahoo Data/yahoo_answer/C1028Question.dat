20090304154610AAP8GUR	Sports;Hockey	Biggest fleecing today during the trade deadline?	Personally, I think the Upshall/Carcillo trade was a big rip off for Philly.    Upshall is already better than Carcillo, but a 2nd rounder as well?! What was Paul Holmgren thinking?      And the 2nd trade which I thought was borderline was the Jokinen trade. Calgary gave up a lot, a 1st rounder in 2009 or 2010, Matthew Lombardi, which I think is a great penaltykiller, and Brandon Prust, who is a chippy scrapper.    What are you're "big rip offs" of this years trade deadline opinions?

We would go fishing and only catch one or two. Usually a spot caught by me. But every single person with a fishing rod got 10 plus. I mean the dudes 5 feet next to us got 20 fish. They got a nice red and big blues and everything. My dad can cast as far as they can. We all use the same rig ( high low ) we all use the same bait ( spot and bloodworm )      Before we went fishing, My mom...who cleaned the tackle box with water and soap. So i think the soap smell is all over the hooks, rigs, and sinkers. I think its cause our stuff smells like soap or disinfectant stuff. So im guessing the fish won't come near out bait.      How do i get rid of the clean smell? I have to make it smell like sea water and fish stank.       thanks

Well, this first part will get yall laughin a little bit, but I gotta serious question      My art teacher has brought in animals (not live) for us/her art students to draw- from birds to a stuffed yellow coyote (yes, the coyote was alive at one point, long story about the coyote lol).. so basically, she finds the weirdest stuff for us to draw, but don't get me wrong, its fun watching the reactions to people who have to draw 'em.. anyways, she has a fox that a friend of hers had to kill, and it's not tooo big, but it ain't tiny either. She has it in the freezer and said that once she has us draw it, that I can have it.      The fur on the fox is red and gray, and I want to skin it and tan the hide (with the hair still attached)...   How do I do that?   I only have $10.. is there any way that I could do that without having to buy all the fancy stuff?   Do yall think I'll need to salt the hide (flesh side)?         Thanks for yall's help

Remember when he told Kobe to "tell me how my as* tastes"?. No one even dared to rip him after that. He would do that to anyone in this league and no one would care, but if someone would do it to him, he acts as if he is hurt. If Lebron or Kobe did that, they would be ripped off in sports columns.

In a news conference Feb. 25th and 26th, the Obama administration has publicly and formally announced they will reinstate the assault weapons ban. This ban includes magazines over 10 rounds, several types of firearms, and we are waiting to see which other firearms he means when he says he will add more. He is also going after ammo, so it may be included in some form IE: military calibers etc And it will be permanent, no sunset clause like it had under the Clinton administration. So, do you still feel that those of us who predicted this before the election, and those who rushed out to buy AR and other types of semi auto firearms, magazines and ammo, after the election, were  paranoid, or just realists who were a little smarter than the "sheeple" with their head in the sand?

20090306161704AAhT7Yk	Sports;Outdoor Recreation;Hunting	Anything smoother than a Sig P229?	Hey everyone-      I just wanted to start a little discussion about the Sig Sauer P229.  I had an internship with a federal law enforcement agency some months ago, and while I was there I had the pleasure of shooting a p229 in .357sig.      Now I don't consider myself a pistol expert, but the p229 was the smoothest pistol I have ever fired by far.  The slide could be pulled back almost effortlessly compared to other pistols I have used.  The recoil was also extremely light.  I fell in love instantly.      My question:  has anyone ever fired the p229 and found it comparable to any other pistol?  I am very curious to know if there is anything out there quite like this beauty.      I have fired Glocks & Springfield XDs in 9mm, and  H&Ks & Springfield 1911s in .45acp.  None of those reputable pistols came even close in terms of "smoothness."  Even the less powerful 9mm's had more muzzle flip and recoil.

20090306191814AAbZZAb	Sports;Wrestling	Didn't you like Pro Wrestling better when it at least pretended to be a real sport?	I rarely watch wrestling, but did as a kid in the golden era.      But nowadays, or example, some guy could be in a match, then all these other guys, unrelated to the match, run into the ring and beat him up for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, the guy's original opponent and the ref have somehow disappeared. No real sport would allow a scene like that to go on for more than a minute; and even in the old days of wrestling, if that were happening, other wrestlers would come out of the locker room to break up the scene. I think the "sport" was more fun when it tried to be somewhat realistic.       When did wrestling become surreal?

I would imagine he got used to Shawn Michaels, and stuck with it, but who knows. Just something I've been wondering.      BQ: If SmackDown went live, and even changed from Friday nights to Wednesday or Thursday, do you think it would have a higher TV Rating then today? Even rivaling with RAW?      Reason is, Smackdown is aired on Friday nights, and a lot of people are out and about then.

So its painful to stay on the ball of my foot and push off on a hard gym floor. Any ideas? I know they won't allow shoes so I need some ideas?

But in the mid to late 90's Briton Smith had a plan to change Atlanta...he changed the front stretch to the back stretch and made the back stretch into a dog leg making Atlanta into a tri-oval. People thought he was crazy but it worked it made racing at Atlanta very fast and very exciting. So here's my question what year did this happen? And who was the first pole sitter who scorched the old Atlanta's track record and made NASCAR worry that the track would require restrictor plates? Who was the winner of the first race at the new Atlanta? Good luck and have fun with it!

20090306205748AA0EvgN	Sports;Football (Australian);Rugby League	Do You Believe The Allegations Againest Brett Stewart?	I don't believe that Brett would do something like this. Forget whether or not you like Manly or not just do you think that he would do something like this?    From nrl.com.au:      'Police say a 24-year-old man has been accused of approaching a girl about 8pm (AEDT) on Friday outside a unit complex on Pittwater Road in North Manly.      The pair spoke for a short time and then entered a stairwell where the girl allegedly was sexually assaulted, police said.'      I find its funny that a majority of sexual assaults allegations that are made that appear in the news have league players attached to them. And more often that not they are found not guilty. So is it just a case of mistaken Identity (even though she has said they spoke for a while she can't be completely sure it was him)? If it's at night then it could have been anyone. And it's one thing to say a persons name but you've got to have proof, so until some sort of evidence comes into light I will continue to think that Stewart in innocent.       Reminder: I don't care if you hate Manly with a passion I'm asking about 1 individual so answer the question as is please.

Sporting teams (name any sport) all have a "mascot" name,   Collingwood Magpies because they're black and white   Brisbane Lions (from Fitzroy being the Lions). Fitzroy were originally called the 'Redlegs' BTW. When the Dandenong club appeared in the VFA, they copyrighted 'Redlegs' and Fitzroy lost the name and became the Lions.   Carlton (the Blues for obvious reasons)   Sydney Swans (from the South Melbourne club that played at the Lakeside Oval next to Albert Park lake which was full of swans)   etc etc      But why are Essendon called the 'Bombers"? I realise the main airport used to be in Essendon, so the nickname could relate to this. But Essendon were one of the original teams in the VFL competition in 1897. Aeroplanes were not invented then! Did they have another name?
