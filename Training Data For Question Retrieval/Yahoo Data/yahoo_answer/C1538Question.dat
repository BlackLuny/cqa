20090226192753AA7Y2vR	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Is this true about being black,please explain?	Please read this situation here. I have a friend , she is black and in her 30's.  She admits she is racist and says al white people are racist when it comes down to it. To make a long story short. She finally blew my fuse today and called me a racist and upset me. Now please tell me if this is justifiable ....   We got into this argument that started tonight when she told me that she is having a party at her job for black history. I told her every nationality should have a history month.And she said black were the only ones that were treated with so much problems and the world makes it impossible for them to get ahead .   Throught the past year or 2 she never got this angry about race issues and all of a sudden she blew up on the phone tonight to me about how racist the world is and how impossible it is to be black in a dominated white world where whites rule. She said the reason why black dont own businesses is cuz the government or banks are predjuice and dont give loans out to them except only to foreginers, like indians and pakastianianis or arabs. The government holds down the black race and doesnt want it to suceed.  She told me everytime she walks in a store they always follow her(employees) and ask if they can help her. Because she is black. They never put the change in her hand , they always place it on the counter cause she is black. She says whenever i am shopping with her they never bother her cuz im white. She says whites have it easy especially the males. No one will give a black woman a chance in the biz world no matter how qualified she is. She  brings up the fact that her grandma was a slave and it is horrible what went on , (they cut babies out of women, fed the kids to the dogs, and hung alot of blacks).  She says i dont care about what happened and i should stay away from black women and stick to white women and i should never have a half black baby cause i wil not support the kid  and his culture and he will grow up disfunctional .    I have a had a few black female friend in the past and i never had this problem with any of them. Is it just her?    I asked one of my black guy friends and he told me to cut her off.       PLease advise me on this      thanks

20090226193642AAmefMh	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	How an I get myselF to stop caring what people think?	About a year ago I messed up and lied to a ex best friend, it had nothing to do with her personally(it was family issues) like backstabbing but a lie is a lie. That lie ended our friendship completely even though i did everything to get it to work again. I was just kinda immature at the time. Its been a year now and I just found out I have to work with her at my new job, i can tell she still holds a grudge, Ive tried talking to her but she ignores me . How can I move on and not care what she thinks, I'm sick of caring hoping she accepts me again, I feel paranoid. I made a mistake and I cant take it back, i feel like shes constantly judging me how can I get over this?

20090226193715AARSclW	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	What should I do I think my cleaner is stealing my clothes and jewellery...?	I live in a flat in central london with two girls, we are all friends and trust each other completely.    We recently got a new cleaner, she cleans for a mutual friend of ours so we trusted her when she was recommended, and as we are working during the day, did not mind her cleaning the flat when we were not here.       Only now, we have been looking for specific things to wear to go out and we can't find them... I have been going nuts trying to think of everyone who has visited, the last time I wore certain things etc... And the only logical explanation is her.       Yes our clothes are expensive, but personally it is so much more than that, as a lot of the items were presents that my parents both searched high and low for, and the sentimental value is just so much more. I feel violated.       What can I do?      We're scared if we confront her it will lead nowhere, we don't know how to go about telling the police...       Has anyone been in a similar situation?      Thanks.

20090226194555AAvJZfP	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	How is this intro for a story (tenth grade enlish extra credit)?	Its a bit dark but after last years essay I doubt Ill get sent down to guidance as a "troubled kid" by any teachers and if so...whatever.      I used this as a prompt:   "Wake up...Wake up and...smell the ashes.   They tried to bury their sins, but instead    planted the seeds of their doom.    A war is coming.    I've seen it in my dreams.    Fire sweeping over the earth,    bodies in the streets,    cities turned to dust.    Retaliation."   =====================================            The cityscape was barren,deserted. Fires filled the sky and smoke billowed from every pore of most buildings. He was in such pain...His vision blurred to the point of seeing only a few feet directly infront of him. An uneven gate as he trudged along breathing heavily all the way. The man turned a corner and continued on. His Lab Coat was bloodstained and his glasses had been cracked and shattered leaving only the mangeled and twisted form of their rim lying over his beaten and swolen face.    His hand was clenched to his chest where deep within was the bullet that had wounded him so. His aggressor had been killed not by his own hands but of whoms he was not sure. One momment the man was upon him-beating him to the ground only to fire a pistol into his chest and the next all that remained of the man was a charred skeleton seemingly drowned in a puddle of its own blood. The whispering was stuck in his head. Something had said something as he looked at that skeleton.Indistinguishable and pointless ,no doubt, but menacing and evil in its own right.      Again and again he stumbled and fell to the ground as he walked. Each time it was harder and harder for him to stand once again. He kept on walking and slowly he found that he didnt know where he was walking but felt he was moving in the right direction whatever that may be. Eventually only small buildings were around him and he had reached the epiccenter of the explosion marked by a deep crater.He staired out across the chasm and saw his wife and his children waving at him. The scenery changed and the grass regrew and the buildings were repaired and the lives restored. The man smiled and walked towards his family who had moved behind him. As he reached them he found 3 skeletons bathed in their own blood. Violently he spun away from this sight and again saw his own family.Once again smiling and walking towards them there was a massive explosion of hell and fire and as the fire seared and engulfed him he looked only at his family.       He looked across the crater. They were no longer there. He wasnt sure what he had seen but the buildings were ruined once more. The lives again extinguished and the grass again destroyed. A sudden movement to his right turning only to find nothing. He turned away from the crater and at once saw a shadowy figure behind him. He opened his mouth in shock.And like his aggressor he too fell to the ground-a skeleton in a puddle of its own blood.

20090226195224AA6N3F8	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What do you think the purpose of religion is?  How and why did religion originate?	From what I understand, superstition were made to fill the gaps.  And superstition were turned into religion by men who wanted power.  They use religion to control other people through fear.  And religion works best against the weak-minded who don't have the guts to accept reality for what it is.  Religious leaders all the way from the past took advantage of this and used religion to control them.  That is why you see so many different religions all over the world.  Each culture has its own made up religion.  It's so obvious.  It has continued until today and the weak-minded are still being exploited.

My dad has no clue on what Twilight is, and I just can't explain it to him without him getting confused.        So I asked him what the big deal was.  He told me that the Red Hand of Ulster is the symbol of Northern Ireland and is one of the things you can't be caught dead wearing in Ireland.        I had no clue on what the Red Hand of Ulster was until an hour ago, and it got me wondering,  Is it really that bad to wear such a symbol of Northern Ireland in Dublin or Galway?

I'm one of those guys who really delayed on the wedding plans. However, we both know that it will obviously happen.

We are to be married in May.      Yes, we actively have... you know.      My question is this: Is it a sin for us to be doing this? We've been married at heart for years and years, but just didn't have that state endorsed sig. Are we sinning each time we... you know?      thanks!

I know you're all probably thinking this is in the wrong place, but there's a reason it all ties together. Okay. Here it goes. Over the summer, I really liked this girl, and I was just starting to figure out I was gay. Well, obviously my parents didn't know, and I started chillen with this girl, and I liked her more and more. Well, we got into a fight, and my parents found out and they asked what was wrong, and I told them I might be gay. Well, they kinda flipped, and this girl is much older than I am, so they told me that I couldn't talk to her or have any contact with her ever again, and that they'd get printouts of all of my texts and phone calls so they know I won't talk to her ever again. I still haven't seen one of those packets with all the info on it, so I was wondering how you could tell if they had this arrangement made without asking my parents or having them find out. I REALLY want to talk to her again, and I have to find this out before I can attempt anything. All the help is appreciated. Thank you sooooo much.

He was so sweet and knew just how do to everything right without me having to show him how to do anything. It felt so great knowing that I was making love with my best friend and just kissing his lips was a major turn on for me.

20090226203619AA4EibJ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Are we evolving in the right direction?	Another person asked the question: Do you think that diversity in belief is good or bad for human society, and why?       My response if this:   I do. I think it advances us as a culture. If everyone believes that women shouldn't have the right to vote, it stays that way forever. It's only through the exchange of ideas that we come to agree on the right ones. There are many people who would argue that people try to impose their values by force, which certainly happens, but I think for the most part that it causes people to evolve for the better.      Do you agree with that? Does diversity make us better as a society? Are we "evolving" in the right direction? Certainly things aren't perfect, but I think we're getting better. America started as a slave owning nation, evolved to free the slaves, then give the former slaves the vote, then elected an African American as president. What do you think?

20090226211441AAFQdZZ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Has anyone read "The Dragons of Eden" by Carl Sagan?	The Dragons of Eden: Speculations on the Evolution of Human Intelligence is a Pulitzer prize winning 1977 book by Carl Sagan. In it, he combines the fields of anthropology, evolutionary biology, psychology, and computer science to give a well balanced perspective of how human intelligence evolved.      One of the main issues featured in the book is the search for a quantitative way of measuring intelligence. Sagan shows that the brain to body mass ratio is an extremely good indicator, with humans having the highest and dolphins second (pp.38–40, hardback ed.). It does break down, however, at the extremely small end of the scale. Because a certain minimum size is needed to sustain life[citation needed], smaller creatures (ants in particular) place disproportionally high on the list.      Other topics mentioned include the evolution of the brain (with emphasis on the function of the neocortex in humans), the evolutionary purpose of sleep and dreams, demonstration of sign language abilities by chimps and the purpose of mankind's innate fears and myths. The title "The Dragons of Eden" refers to man's early struggle for survival in the face of predators, and how fear of reptiles may have led to cultural beliefs and myths about dragons and snakes.      This book is my favorite book by Carl Sagan and he makes many allusions to the stages of the human brain.  I think he is quite an authority on the evolution of the human brain.  If the development of the human brain can be compared to evolution of animal stages, why can't the stages of gestation be the same guide?

I can understand people being offended by things like racial slurs and the like, but let's say I'm talking to a friend and casually throw in a swear word like s**t. Sometimes somebody who you aren't even talking to will but in and tell you not to swear as they are in proximity and can hear you. Why do they care? What is it about swear words that don't inherently have an offensive meaning that makes people not accept hearing them? I never understood that.

20090226205954AA3WSDX	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Question to North Americans, Western Europeans or Australians : What do you think of Eastern Europeans?	I’ve been hesitating before asking this question. It could be a sensitive question.   Actually, I have no intention to insult anyone.    I just wonder what people from developed Western countries think of those from Eastern Europe, especially the former Soviet bloc.   Their economy is mostly not very good with a notable exception of Slovenia, because they had had a communist economic system for a long time.   Some people tend to ignore others from less developed countries even in the same ethnic group, simply because their standard of living is lower.      For example, many foreign workers (guest workers) from South or South-East Asia are going to another Asian country, where the standard of living is higher than theirs and they can be more paid than in their own countries.   The guest workers are usually doing dangerous or hard work that the native-born workers do not want to do. And some of them had a high standard education in their countries. ( I’ve seen a factory worker with a master’s degree. )   Nevertheless, they are usually much less paid than the native-born workers.   And many of them are illegal immigrants and they are not normally protected by labour law.   It’s a pity that they are sometimes abused by some vicious entrepreneurs and disregarded by some heartless and ignorant native citizens.      What about the Eastern Europeans (including Russians and Ukranians)?   Are they sometimes ignored by rich Western people?
20090225123032AAQYZGQ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How could two people, created by God, beget an entire species?	I ask because there is a reason that inbreeding is bad for a society: disadvantageous recessive traits (like mental retardation, for example) become more and more common with each generation. Research into space colonization (generation ships in particular) has shown that there are certain minimum beginning size requirements for an isolated human population to sustain itself. The minimum , as you might have guessed, is far above two.       In order to avoid problems with inbreeding over just 10 generations in a 200 year period you would need to start with 160 people, according to an article by Damien Carrington of the New Scientist. ( http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn19...       I'm still looking for information regarding indefinite preservation of genetic diversity, I'll add that when I find it. By the way, if you're unsure as to how this wouldn't be a problem for evolution then you don't know very much about the theory.

Now, since then I've been trying to be a good person (I always help people whenever possible, I never swear, etc.) I've realised how horrible I was to black people. Like I said, I feel terrible about it. I'd never say anything like that again. I've realised what I did was a horribly wrong thing to do and I feel disgusted with myself for it.      The things I used to say were funny to my friends. I never meant any of it from the heart, so to speak. But, even still, what I did was my choice and I am responsible for my actions.      I'd never say ANYTHING like that EVER again. I feel so bad...      Would you still say I'm still a bad person?      For the record, I'm not religious and I do have non-Caucasion friends.      Thanks.

India is a beautiful and growing country but it seems like people don't realize this or ignore it.

20090226211537AALVUgH	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Why do some people not like talking and socializing?	I don't understand why some people like to be alone all the time. I really want to understand though. I have only had a handful of experiences in my life where i haven't wanted to socialize. I don't see how anyone could be introverted by choice. My guess is they're shy or too misrible from something or another. I just don't get it when people hate me because i never want to stop socializing or why it annoys teachers so much if we are done with everything in that class and everyone is just sitting around waiting for the bell to ring and start talking. Whenever i get homework and have time to do it at school i rarerly do because i would rather talk with people at school and wait to do it when i get home. Then i see people who just sit by themselves, rarely talk to anyone, just sit and listen to music, and i don't get how they can be happy with that. I'm not anyware close to well liked or popular and i used to have quite bad attention seeking problems(still do but not quite as extreme). Almost anyone i walk up to in my school has an "oh crap he's here" attitude whenever i get near them. I really enjoy listening to other people's problems (if you guessed i really enjoy browsing yahoo answers). It's like i can almost get it but then not really  when it comes to understanding anti-social people. I really want to know why some people are anti-social in general.

Why did you stop?
20090226210928AAXlRst	Society & Culture;Mythology & Folklore	Ever heard of the the 'Cheshire Cat Moon'?	It will be visible between now and March 1st    -- though Feb 27 and 28 will be the best for viewing.      Do you remember the story of "Alice in Wonderland"?   There was a chapter about Alice meeting the Cheshire Cat, as you may recall the cat had a large smile on his face.   Then he faded out to invisibility, until there was nothing left but the smile.      Well, if you have never read the book or seen the movie about "Alice" ...then perhaps you've seen "a cat without a smile?"   If you look in the Western sky tomorrow at around sunset, until around 7:15, you will see "the smile without the cat!"      Some of the younger members of your family may have never heard of the story, or have mostly forgotten about it, if they have seen it, or read it.   Perhaps sometime between now and the evening of March 1st, you can just happen to mention something about the story of "Alice" and about the Cheshire Cat.   If you go out to see it by your self you can find a place where the "smile" is visible though the branches of a tree.   Then go back in and get your family to come out to see the cat up in the tree.   Get them to stand where you were before, when you were looking at the "smile" through the tree branches, then tell them about the "Cheshire Cat".      BTW that bright thing above the moon is the planet Venus.

Some white people I know get made fun of because because they are too fair and that they "need" a tan, yet I have alot of hispanic friends who make fun of other hispanics for being too dark and same goes for my black friends.   Is it like the whole brunettes wanting to be blondes (vice versa) and curly headed people want straight hair (and vice versa).  I'm just trying to understand it all.  Is there a perfect skin tone that people want to be or is it just wanting to be something that you are clearly not?

20090226215809AA3UTrM	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What are your thoughts about this...?	"The beauty of religious mania is that it has the power to explain everything. Once God (or Satan) is accepted as the first cause of everything which happens in the mortal world, nothing is left to chance...or change. Once such incantatory phrases as "we see now through a glass darkly" and "mysterious are the ways He chooses His wonders to perform" are mastered, logic can be happily tossed out the window. Religious mania is one of the few infallible ways of responding to the world's vagaries, because it totally eliminates pure accident. To the true religious maniac, it is ALL on purpose." -Stephen King in The Stand.      That is one problem I have always had with overly religious people. They are never giving credit where credit is due. If you beat cancer, God didn't do that. Your doctor did that. You did that. God had no part.       That is just my thought. I am interested in hearing some of your thoughts. No matter if you agree with it or not. Thanks in advance.

A few days later, she didn't apologize or forgive so I banged my head into the fitting room pole and punched it in front of customers. The one who had a child with her reported me and I got canned.       Now I'm like totally alone. No one's on my side and my parents criticize me. They say things like how I always insist on being right and how I always blame others for my mistakes. The only one I have left is a friend who backs me 100% and says mgt blew it out of proportion. My parents even sides w/ Wal-Mart and said how I looked really mental doing what I did. Maybe they should just spill the beans and say I suck at everything. Because from what they said, they already never fail to remind me what a failure I am.      They won't even let me apply for another job in case I get one and throw tantrums again. I might get canned from that job and lose all my chances. How will I get them to stop acting like this? I'm not even supposed to defend myself against their criticisms. like wtf!

I guess it could also be because I don't have a very clean past... judging by when ever I eat with him someone annoying comes along and starts talking to me.

20090226212249AATN8b1	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	This is what I am talking about closed minded people  that would say stupid racist things like this ?	Funny how there are more black on black crime than black on on any other crime . Funny how the biggest gangs and  treacherous  and growing are latino gangs but its funny how you assume that you think blacks in so called inner cities would take their time to miss with others. I am sick of the  impression that blacks are from the hood , ghetto , un educated ,  so  on and so  but hey what can I expect .  The reason why I am writing this because  the person who wrote doesn't not even have a email for me to respond to  haters are nothing but afraid .    The person I am talking to is YOWSER  WHO MADE THIS STATEMENT :   guess I can't see a difference between these hate groups and any large inner city that is filled with blacks. Where any other race walking down these streets would get robbed,raped or murdered.      To me, the blacks are a worse threat to the human race than these so called hate groups.   Source(s):   Think about it.         Funny how certain group of people feel that they do not cause crime in this country but tend to target others  like everyone else is bad but themselves and its  gets on my nerves . My question is does this statement from another Yahoo person  make you upset ?does it just shows that people who are  afraid to share there true believes use Yahoo to  express there  closed minded attitudes on Yahoo. Finally it just shows this country has a lot  of growing .

I just feel that  Cris is getting a hard deal with the media  and sponsors . I mean he should not put his hands on her in  the first place but I truly feel that she played a rule in  this situation . No men should not hit women nor should women provoke men or hit them .  But   I Just feel that the Justice system is ready to throw the book at him .  I just don't get in Hollywood .  T.I  received less charges than Michael Vick and I read that Cris may get   10yrs  which I feel is somewhat to harsh .   So  this is not really a question but a statement  , so please share your opinion.

20090226213932AAutnky	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Is Homosexuality a sin?	For all of you that get harassed by narrow mined religious fanatics I think you should know that god worshiping religions do not like homosexuality because these acts would be committed in public and often in the places of worship. The ruler of the time would usually ban the religion and shut down the churches for this. Sames as heterosexual acts in public and in the church. As a result women in god worshiping religions are supposed to be quiet and covered as to not tempt men. Reason being why the Pagan religion had been banned at times because of the explicit sexual behavior during holidays.      To ensure this wouldn't happen with new religions homosexuality was/is banned or "sinful"      So there is no hell for you, and you are not an abomination. The Label as homosexuality being sinful is just insurance that kept churches from getting closed and religions being banned. Hundreds of years ago churches and religion gave power to towns and the country, with out that power they could easily be overruled.       So next time you get bashed throw that in someones face.

I have always wondered this as I feel they have an image of us that's not right, mostly. I like the American people but I wonder if that's because we see alot more of them than they do of us. Mostly all our TV is from America as are the films so I think we feel we know you more.   The reason I ask is because I was watching Family Guy the other night (a show I love!) and there was a bit where they were taking the mick out of us being all reserved and proper like. I don't mind, I found it funny but truth be known most of us don't speek da Qweenz English, ya na what I'm sayin mate? But I'm sure the Yanks think we do! And we don't all speak like the English Girl in Friends either!

20090226205507AAYoef9	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Do you think the media pressures people into being fit?	Call me a hypocrite if you must, but here's how I look at it: I may be overweight and content about it. I DO exercise and keep myself active and such, as well as knowing my limits on what to eat. However, I feel that people put a lot of pressure on others to lose a lot of weight and try to get the body of an adonis or something. I'm not saying it's stupid to work out, but with all of these commercials advertising exercise machines that don't have credibility, like any ab machine (Seriously, I don't believe that doing ab workouts can make you lose belly fat all the way through like those commercials state) or Bowflex (Or maybe it's those commercials, especially the one with the infamous "Fat clothes/friends" line. It's almost the same thing how people assume too much on what people eat. I will say this again: If people like to work out and exercise, that's fine, but sometimes I think society or the media believes all people should have hard bodies. It's like they think if having soft skin is bad. Same with when I watch these weight loss blogs on YouTube. It mostly has to do with girls. The girl looks thin enough, yet she grabs skin and still feels like she is fat. If she wants to not grab skin, do some situps. I work out sometimes, so it's not like I am opposed to it, but here's a line from a movie that I sometimes agree with:      "Is that what a man is supposed to look like?"   "Self improvement is masturbation. Now self destruction..."      Just want to know your points of view.

Don't tell me anything, explain your answer. I thought of this question because I asked one similar to it...    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...       and I got to thinking, "hey, if you really, seriously believed in zombies, does that mean your crazy? or are you just paranoid?"

20090226201328AAB620M	Society & Culture;Mythology & Folklore	What kind of zombie is more realistic?	I really think there are 3 kinds of zombies...      1. The "original" zombies, which were once dead people, now risen from their grave to feast on the human brain. They move slowly and if you were to cut off an arm, the arm would crawl, too. Unkillable.      2. The stereotypical zombies, the ones that skulk around slowly hungering for flesh, with rotting skin and lacking limbs. Killable, but it'll take massive gunfire or explosions to take them down.      3. The fast zombies, from Left 4 Dead, quickly moving and easily killable.      Which of these do you expect on Z-Day? and why?

But is there anybody out there who actually believe zombies could exist?      I don't want any "of course zombies couldn't exist, it's physically impossible go see a therapist" responses.      I don't believe they could exist, I just like thinking about it.

20090226213900AAaZEeZ	Society & Culture;Languages	French Pronunciation?	Hello, Yahoo Answers.      For the chorus I'm in, we're preforming the song Cantique de Jean Racine - a beautiful French work. However, I'm having a good deal of trouble with the pronunciation of the French, and it's hindering my ability to sing the song. So, what I ask is if someone could write out the pronunciation for the lyrics (which I'll write below). I know it's kind of a big task, but your help is greatly appreciated.      Some notes: In the song, there are some instences were 2 sound or words will be linked together for one note, so it's essentially saying the two words at the same time. That will be reprsented like this: tre_u or que_es.      There are also words that are brought out between 2 or notes, and will be represented like this: rom-pons or Di-vin.      With those in mind, I'm going to try to write the lyrics exactly as they appear on my sheet music. I'm even keeping the lyrics true to each bar of music, so it might look weird, but I need it for my preference. Also, if you could, could you also keep the same format I have for the lyrics?

20090226155316AAmS9qE	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Do I seem like a drug seeker?	Hi, I've been getting migrane headaches since I was 6. They where few and far between each one, I treated them with asprin. When I was 7 I was prescribed Naproxen Sodium (not sure on the spelling), which worked very well 'till I was 12. Then I was put on ultram at 12. When I was 13 they started to pose a real big problem coming on as many times as 3 times a week. I had to be taken out of normal school and was put on a homebound program. At 14 ultram stopped working, and I was put on 5-500 mg vicodin, & 10mg NS Stadol. Vicodin worked very well for 9 months, I would one and it would go away. Note: During the vicodin/stadol stage I was being tried on drugs such as triptines, egotomines, & anti-inflamitory none of whiched worked.      I'm 15 now and I'm about to loose my ******* mind. In the midil of november of 08, my vicodin stopped working with just 1 so I had to come back and take another about 20-30 mins after the first one. If two didnt knock it I would take the staol, which prior to the starting of this was hardly ever used. So two vicodin stopped working, and I bumped up the stadol to my first abortive med. My doctor didn't like that so he cut me off and left me in the dirt. He would only give me a two weeks supply of vicodin which starting in november, I would have to take two at a time and then the headache would come back and I would have to take another two, sometimes it would come back agian and I would take another two. It made it hard to make 30 vicodins last 2 weeks with that (I wasnt able to get stadol).      At the begginging of the year my doctor refered me to the childs hospital. So we made a appomient and went. The lady I saw was a complete *****. She sounded like she didnt belvieve of and despite teling her triptanes and preventive medications dont owrk for me, prescirbes me maxolt. Ofcourse I try it that night when I get a headache, dosent work. So having no vicodin no stadol left me hopeless, because I now had to go into the Er each time I got a headache ( I'm not going to subject myself to days of miserey becuase doctors refuse to give me the medication I need). At the ER we tried, torhadol, DHE, Compazene, a liquid depakote. None of them worked so they began giving me dilaudid/compazene/benadryl, and it workes great. Its almost march now (we are going to a pain managment clicnic soon) and i have been the the ER a total of 27 times, which is ******* pathetic.      Each time I go in I have to wait for 1-2 hours to get into a bed and then another 1-2 hours to see a doctor, while in this time I'm suffering endlessley. Each time a doctor comes in, they will give me **** about how I'm dependant and addicted to narcotics. I want to punch them in the mouth (I dont.. I talk very respectfull to them), I can safely say that I'm not addicted because I get them as of right now 2-4 times a week. Withdrawls would become apperant 12 hours without any narcotic in-take (from what i've read), and i go for up to 4 days at a time without any narcotic in-take and I get no w/d in this time.      If you were a doctor would you label me a drug seeker from what you've heard? If so why. I'm afraid this PM is gonna think I'm a Drug seeker and not help me, because I'm about to loose my ******* mind.      Also what can I avoid doing while I'm talking to this doctor to show I'm not a drug seeker?. I will flat-out tell them I'm not drug skeeking.. but thats what everyone says. If you acutaly read the whole page grats, you must have alot of willpower.

So... a co-worker and I have a tradition of eating chocolate and smoking every once in awhile when things are stressful or stupid at work. (we work in banking, so...). She smokes a pack a day or so, and I only smoke once every few weeks with her or occasionally socially otherwise in the warmer months...so I don't really know anything about brands, etc.   Anyway... usually I run down for the hershey's bar from the vending machine and she gives me a cigarette. however since she's always so generous about it, it'd kinda like to bring some sometime... i know smokers are usually loyal to a brand, but she seems to have different things...never menthol though.      anyway...any suggestions?          *~* by the way, please forgo the lectures. I don't smoke regularly, nor do I plan to do so. my co-worker is perfectly aware of the health risks and is able to make her make her own decisions.

It fits all the definitions of a religion. If you go to an Asian country, you'll see Buddhists worshipping deities, Buddhas, and Bodhisattvas. There are elaborate rituals. There are doctrines and beliefs. There are festivals and pilgrimages.      So how is all this not a religion? By the way I am a Buddhist, and it does irk me sometimes when people claim Buddhism is not a religion.

20090226220953AAuFwfL	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	People say God never changes- is this true, and is it stated in the Bible (read further)?	I ask this....because God HAS changed.      In particular, I am talking about the flood of Noah's time. After the waters had gone back to normal levels, God cast a rainbow over the sky, a symbol of his promise NOT to do what he JUST DID ever again.      So here are my issues:      1.) God promised not to do something he already did, therefore he changed      2.) If God is all knowing, and all perfect, why is his decision conflictual? Why would he do something he knows he shouldn't do again?      And to follow up on #2,...      2a.) Regardless of perfection, is God's love a manipulative one as well? Whenever I hear about the flood story, I feel like the focus point is ALWAYS on the fact that God made this merciful decision to never wipe out his creation again, and never on the fact that God technically "took back" an action he did by promising never to do it again.      I apologize for any emotional reception from this; I am a Christian/atheist/agnostic...I really don't know, I'm rapidly going on and off between them. No offense was meant, as always, and in return, please try to keep answers clean and precise, and absent of offensive material

Some older man sat next to me, and in Spanish asked me if there was a long wait.  I hesitated and explained that I did not speak Spanish well. (In Spanish, no less) and rephrased the question in my version of the language to ensure I understood his question.  He said, (again, in Spanish) "You are MEXICAN, why don't you speak Spanish?"  To which I replied, "No sir, I am AMERICAN and Hispanic. I am NOT Mexican."  He then went on to argue that where we live, EVERYONE speaks Spanish. I stated, "Not everyone! I do not."  My Spanish is very broken, you see.  But I carried on in Spanish and excused myself after he asked if my husband spoke Spanish.  He was hitting on me, I realized.    I live in West Texas.  Granted, near the Mexican border.       Anyway, would you be offended if someone asked why you do not speak Spanish?

One day, you are sexually harassed by a stranger and find out after a couple of weeks that you are pregnant.  What will be your solution for this? Would you have an abortion? Keep in mind that you do not have a stable husband at that present moment and your family members live away from you. You do not want to keep this baby because the father has no steady relationship with you whatsoever. You then decide to keep the baby and give it up for adoption the minute he/she is born.      So, what would you do?      Abortion - Yes or No?      Adoption - Yes or No?

20081031113445AAtpUle	Society & Culture;Etiquette	What is a polite way to let people know?	I'm pregnant with my first baby and we're thrilled. We're having a girl and my family is spending a fortune buying her clothes, shoes and blankets, and I'm really grateful for everything. The thing is since the economy really went south a couple of months ago my husband hasn't been getting his usual hours at work and we're making about $300 dollars less a month. Which is a pretty big difference. She is our first baby and we really need practical things like diapers, bottles, a carseat, ect. So everytime my family spends $100.00+ on an outfit I get a little sick inside because I think of the practical things we could buy with that money. Can you think of a polite way to let people know that we need practical things? I don't want it to seem like we're expecting all of these gifts, but the baby has so many dresses I don't know if she'll be able to wear them all before she outgrows them I'm having nightmares about having the best dressed baby on the block without a crib to sleep in. Any advice?
20081002010914AAblQA6	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What would God do if we built a tower to reach him again?	The first time, according to the story of Babel, he separated us and gave people different languages so we wouldn't be able to communicate and work together to build the tower. Now that we can communicate with people who speak different languages, we can all work together again to build the tower toward God, so what could he do this time?      Also, why is it possible for humans to reach God using a tower, but our space shuttles, which can travel further than any tower we can build, have not been able to reach him? Surely, if God felt the need to confuse the people, he must have known it was possible to reach Heaven with a tower, right?      Can the bible be taken literally?

20060802110311AAAiY9l	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Does anyone know the five-finger prayer?	1. Your thumb is closest to you, so begin your prayers by praying for those closest to you. They are the easiest to remember.    2. The next finger is the pointer finger. Pray for those who teach, instruct and heal - teachers, doctors, and ministers. They need support and wisdom in pointing others in the right direction.    3. Next is the tallest finger, to remind us of our leaders. Pray for the president, leaders in business and industry, and administrators. They guide our nation and public opinion and need God's guidance.   4. Next is our ring finger, surprisingly, our weakest finger. It reminds us to pray for those who are weak, lost, in trouble or in pain. They need your prayers day and night.   5. And last is the pinky. Which is where we should place ourselves in relation to God and others. The Bible says, "The least shall be the greatest among you." Your pinky reminds you to pray for yourself. After you've prayed for the other four groups, your own needs will be put into perspective.

20090226193910AAp5jCt	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Ex-Christians why have you decided to abandon your faith?	If it never required evidence for your belief in the first place? As for me,    I have chosen faith.       I have become a believer in God because:      1. Design. Our body's are masterpieces, our universe has order, the probability that it came by randomness is simply nonsense.      2. I take the Gospel accounts as eye witnesses. Jesus wouldn't lie, his demeanor speaks much of him.        3. I've witness (with my own eyes) the transformation Christ has had in my life, the life of my family, my friends, and strangers.       4. My faith has taught ME to love and tolerate all peoples, including those whom I disagree.       5. It has caused me to become more rational, I have matured immensely as a result of my faith. Both philosophically and scientifically.       6. I have a set of morals and a will to live life.      7. This ancient document has taught me to respect and love those who persecute me.      8. I love the idea of a God who cares and is interested in everything I do.        9. I love the idea that God forgives and does things for our well being.

20090225123729AAhpaQB	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Why am I pure black and Mixed race at the same time depending on Racial Classification?	As you may know there are two ways of defining race in the western world one is based on physical traits predominately skin tone and is based completely on visual perception imagination (social construct) in that version I would be called 'Black' the other way is by Craniofacial anthropometry and in that way I would be mixed race (Caucasian and Capoid)......       http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en...    Green - Caucasian   Yellow - Negroidd   Purple - Capoid   Blue - Mongoloid   Orange -Australoid      I thought maybe im just completely Capoid and they were referring to Arab/Berbers who also live in Sudan but then I noticed how this map covers Ethiopia (a black nation) and even Kenya also and my fathers family resembled Ethiopians ie curly hair texture:    http://www.imagineafrica.co.uk/images/su...    Dad has the same skin tone and hair texture as this northern Sudanese kid who would also be classed as Caucasian by Craniofacial anthropometry.      So one way is based on imagination and the other one would put my father Europeans and Western Asians in the same group yet they all look different This is the reason why many can claim Ancient Egypt to be a Caucasian civilization not taking into fact that they are basing it on Craniofacial anthropometry the same thing which would put my father in the Caucasian group yet he looks far from it im not even considered a Negroidd but I look just like one.   Yet another reason why Racial Classification is a bunch of BS.      For the Racial Classification experts or the ones who swear its biologically true division amongst our species.   Why am I both pure black and Mixed race at the same time depending on Racial Classification?

No one listens because they(including me) still have one. My question is WHY can't we have one? Your profile can be set to private so perverts can't see it.

In fact, lets all just ban the internet because of the possibility of pornography popping up? Why are JW's so...annoyingly possessive?

So for someone who committed such serious religious and legal offenses to be tried and put to death was the fair thing to do.  Am I right?

Why is it that so many militant atheists will quickly point out, with great pride, their ability to think clearly, be logical, think for themselves, etc. and then simply parrot their own "party line?"      Why do so many ridicule those with faith as "narrow" or "closed" minded and then proceed to vomit up the kool-aid they've been served by relentlessly quoting Sam Harris, George Carlin, Bill Maher, and other militant atheists as if they themselves had created an original thought.      Footnote: The whole "Flying Spaghetti Monster" crap is far from original, never was interesting, and was born out of an asinine analogy that bears no resemblance to an intelligent argument.      Before you report this as a non-question, I refer you again to the headline of this question and request your appropriate response.      Thanks :)

20090226221103AA52c7o	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Critisize my essay please?	Atticus lives in a world revolved around idealism. As a lawyer and as a symbol of justice Atticus does not acknowledge the imperfections the reality withholds. Atticus urges his children to look past all faults and act morally. Atticus and his ideal world allow his children to develop and instill valuable lesson. Furthermore, Atticus views do not interfere with the safety of his children, and in fact prove to be beneficial.     With Atticus’s idealism come valuable life lessons. These valuable life lessons allow both Jem and Scout to become better individuals and human beings. A prime example is Atticus teaching his children how to treat others equally, regardless of age, gender, or race. As a result, Scout clearly takes her fathers’ advice and even tells her uncle, “When Jem and I fuss, Atticus doesn’t ever listen to just Jem’s side of it, he hears mine too…” (Page 86) This action Atticus takes allows his children and the reader to admire his sense of fairness. This type of idealism that Atticus Finch portrays illustrates how Scout will always take her father’s advice and not only remind her Uncle about it but also use it when it comes to being fair in playing games and standing up  her classmates such as Walter Cunningham.    At the same time, as Atticus FInch beings to treat Jem and Scout as adults, he also presents them with very valuable advice that seemingly helps the children and allows them to become the mature and responsible adult that Atticus sees them as. For instance Atticus has never used his fists as a  means of getting what he wanted. In fact he even says, “Hold you head high and keep those fists down…try fighting with your head for a change.” (Page 76) This crucial piece of advice benefits Scout is such a way that it allows her to make a big decision in bullying a classmate. Consequently when Scout faces problems at school, and is tempted to use violence, s he was reminded by Atticus’s counsel and as a result she took the correct path; choosing to walk away and not fighting with her fists. This is illustrated when Scout says, “…Remembered what Atticus had said, then dropped my fists and walked away.”  Could have Atticus idealism and his sense of parenting been any better? No,  his idealism benefited Scout so well that she took not only the right decision to not get involved and face the drastic consequence but also apply his advice to her situation and be able to exit the scene with the calamity and the satisfaction of taking her father’s advice. Clearly Atticus’s words have benefited his daughter and have not led to any consequences.  On the other hand, some may say that his parenting style has led to the conflict during the resolution of events but I disagree. His parenting style which offers so much unique and outstanding advice has lessened the conflict. If it was not for Atticus parenting style and idealistic views, Scout would have probably used her fists as a means of getting what she wanted and caused even more damage and thus more conflict to the story.   In addition to the advice that Atticus gives that benefit his children. He also teaches them moral life lessons. Unlike many of the people in Maycomb, Atticus neither judges nor gossips. Others for example like the group of women who get together for the mere purpose of gossiping, or also known as the Missionary circle, sit around judging and criticizing the citizens of Maycomb. But Atticus teaches his children better. There is no advantage to be gossiping or backbiting so for that reason Atticus is discouraging Scout from it.  Atticus inelastic view serves as beneficial and a very good aspect of how it will mature Finch kids and allow them to become the better people they are. Furthermore Atticus says to both Jem and Scout, “Never judges anyone until you have been in their shoes and walk around in them.” (Page 86) This moral lesson allows both children to see the people of Maycomb society, specifically Boo Radley, with the compassion and care. While others of the Maycomb society may see Boo Radley with eeriness, disgust, and disinterest, Atticus has taught his children to look at Boo the way they would look at themselves; with respect and without judgment.  This type of view only benefits the children and leads to no other consequence and only advantages. One of the advantages could be the fact that they get saved from being killed by Bruce Ewell. Although the author doesn’t not distinctly say who  was attempting to save the children from Ewell it is clear to the reader it was Boo Radley. Who knows maybe if the children were not respectful to Boo, and had judged him like all the others citizens of Maycomb, Boo wouldn’t not be anyone saving them from Bruce Ewell and not lives of the children would be lost.   All in all, the reality is that Atticus children will grow up mature and intelligent because of his influence. Atticus has not donned any form of consequences from the children in fact he has benefited them with his idealism and p

20081008173100AArJf9a	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	HOW TO GET SOMEONE TO STOP PICKING ON YOU!?	There is this guy who keeps picking on me, he keeps calling me a puss ee even though I'm bigger than him, and he keeps making fun of my red hair and calling me a ginger and all that.  He is black, really cocky, and everytime I even walk past him he starts calling me that stuff and whenever I say something back he just laughs (its a fake laugh to make me mad) and he acts like he doesnt care.  I don't know what to do, because I've tried ignoring him.  Didn't work.  I tried calling him a puss ee back.  Didn't work, he kept name calling.  I tried not giving him a reaction, and also going along with it.  None of it works.  And it seems like violence is the only thing to do now, but I can't use violence yet, I have to wait about a month or two for certain reasons.  But he needs to stop picking on me, he needs to give me respect, and get off my back.  He has a big group of friends that have his back, but a lot of them can't fight.  It just frustrates me soo much, there is nothing wrong with being a red head and I'm not a puss ee at all, so what should I do?  Any tips are GREATLY appreciated.  Thanks.

20090226205946AA0dXyx	Society & Culture;Languages	Can someone please translate this poem into French? PLease? I need Help?	Good-byes Are Harder Than Hellos    by Danielle Hodgkins    Hellos are hard,   You don't know what to say,   You would look at me,   But I'd look the other way.      I blushed every time I saw you,   You talked to me every day,   You smiled, and you laughed,   But once again I looked away,      Finally one day,   You talked to me once more,   And finally I got the courage,   to say hi and not ignore.      From that point on,   We were together every day,   Until you left me,   and went far, far away.      We had to say goodbye,   They are harder than Hellos,   But after a short time,   I finally let you go.      I know it will be hard,   For both you and I,   But whenever we get lonely,   We can look up in the sky,      And I will know that God, the Father,   Is watching over you,   And you will also know,   That he's watching me, too.      He'll bring us back together,   Before too much time has passed,   And we can be together,   Once again, Once more, at Last.           THANK A MILLION! :)
