Triple H is mad enough to knock out Randy's teeth out.|`|j9GokH9Qaa	This is what I wish happens:<br>  <br>  Next week Linda comes out and reminds Randy how he took out everyone in her family.. and she tells him that he'll pay for every single but of it! and announces that it will be Steph's husband Triple H vs Randy Orton at Wrestlemania for the WWE title in a No Holds Barred Match... Randy sneaks into the ring and RKO's linda.. and says that she was his last victim.. and Triple H is the last.. The Game runs into the ring.. and Randy runs out.. while The Legacy come in the ring and try to attack Triple H.. but Triple H kicks their asses with all his anger! and warns Randy.. and challenges him to a match that night.. The Legacy vs Triple H.. and the one and only! the showstopper! Mr.Wrestlemania! HBK Shawn Michaels! Randy accepts and go backstage...<br>  <br>  Main event.. ends up as a dq when Randy hits Triple H with a chair.. while cody and ted are taking out HBK.. Randy hits Triple H with an RKO 2 times! and does a one man con-chair-to.. and the night ends like that..|`|22f82d8d45e6cb20bd3007cf1b7900f2aa	I'm hoping Linda gets hers too.|`|86kZ5uYwaa	Linda is next|`|KH9bbeCNaa	it just means a career boost|`|RfGTXlotaa	dont you think that by doing this it has set up a primo match between Triple H and Randy Orton??? there hasnt been this much tension since evolution broke up.... and im sure that since stephanie is the GM of Raw Triple H will be their star wrestler in no time again....|`|3k4tPNTGaa	Now hhh is ready to confront ortong for family, linda prbly wont face orton.

HNQU9V6Haa	first off i think hakeem is better then shaq overall shaq doesnt have an aray of moves like all the over greats he just had pwoer and dunked it on ppl down low and he wasnt always the best defensive player|`|qoYLjfxvaa	D. Howard has already made his mark as one of the most athletic big men to ever play the game. For a man of his age, he is putting up tremendous numbers.

IITnJjAjaa	For three miles i reckon you could run it depending on your level of fitness between 20 mins to 22|`|Jf8LiEw2aa	That is horrendous! 4.5 is a fast walk! I'm 14, and I run 5 miles in 38 minutes, or 3 miles in 21 minutes. Keep working!|`|4kIUh76Qaa	It depends on your level of fitness.  I'm a seasoned runner with many races (including marathons) under my belt and I use 4 mph as my warmup and cooldown walks.  If you are looking to just improve your level of fitness, lose weight, and generally be healther than I think your right on target.  It depends what your goals are, really.  If you are looking to be competitive in a 5k race, I'd suggest running at a little faster clip.  Just run fast enough that you don't hate it and your heart rates gets up and you'll be ok:)<br>  <br>  p.s.  For the guy that says 3 miles should take you under 22 mins, that's only true if you are actually a runner training for something.  To imply that an "average" person could run 3 miles at a 7:20/mile pace is ridiculous.  If I had to guess, the "average" 22 yo guy would probably run ONE mile in about 9 minutes, some faster and some slower of course.|`|pkfZXcPCaa	The real key is to show improvement.  We do not have enough information to really tell you where you should be at.  If you go to local races a lot of people are at the 9 or 10 minute/mile pace.  The winners are normally around 5 minute pace.<br>  <br>  However, if you are just starting running the key is to keep with it and slowly build your distance and your speed.  If you need to lose weight that will also help (general rule 2 seconds per mile per pound).<br>  <br>  Just keep working and making progress|`|GqUFQmBkaa	3 miles should take u less than 22 minutes|`|vXkPUOWdaa	that is good enough id say right around that time is perfect good job keep up the good work bro!!!
u2QhQAxzaa	I feel your pain, being a Laker fan as well.  Right when Bynum went out and it was serious, it brought back bad memories.  I am quite pissed he is out but at least we have Pau and Odom playing together for a whole season, rather last year Pau had to fit in right away.  So the team has more chemistry this year with a whole season under Pau's belt and don't worry Bynum will be back in March, early April.|`|b492423af2d29fe3c720b5001a69bd89aa	Bynum will be missed in the playoffs but he is not the key to the lakers winning the title lets not forget the lakers went to the finals with out him last year and if pau/odom play with heart and compete on both sides of the floor the lakers will be champions it wont matter who they play in the finals cavs/celtics ........if odom and pau play at a high level its over.|`|reIMLCKkaa	Yes. They need to be healthy going into the finals. Boston talked sh*t when we were missing Bynum and Ariza. Now KG leaves injured, KARMA|`|ZCHmhuFQaa	Well the Lakers won a lot of games without Bynum, so they don't really need him THAT much. Even Kobe said the Lakers don't even need him.|`|WLXFAeSnaa	No|`|Tgy7n4HLaa	Yeah he was putting up the best numbers he has ever in his career. The Lakers would be even better but are still playing good.|`|OoW9npCuaa	ARRRRGGGGGG!!!|`|KdhNCnEjaa	Well sure they miss Bynum, but honestly, in the Celtics vs Laker matchups where Bynum has played, Perk has out muscled him down low. The Lakers are just as good without Bynum in my opinion, I know most people disagree.<br>  <br>  Celtics 09
C0sT0PPyaa	generally you can't train shirtless, unless your training for a shirtless comp.  sometimes more lax schools will allow it but not really bjj schools.  Except sometimes on somedays when guys are rolling for fun, but generally you look at the guy with his shirt off like hes a monkey.  wear what ever you want under your shirt.<br>  <br>  theres no rug<br>  <br>  burns come from moving improperly and youll find the vets don't get them anymore|`|3DnX9NmAaa	I'm sure it mostly depends on the school. Even if shirtless rolling was allowed, I'd still wear my gi. Not only because I love my gi, but I don't want to get rug burn, rashes, ring worm, or a staff infection.|`|IILOWrrXaa	My boyfriend does BJJ and he wears a rashgaurd so he doesnt pick up any ring worm...you never know! Most places clean their mats often and the athletes are clean and shower but in any kind of mat sport environment a case will pop up occasionally, and it's a pain to get rid of! You're talking cream, covering it, sometimes you even need to get a few rounds of pricey prescription cream if it's a stubborn case, so I def would recommend wearing a rashguard and wash it every time. <br>  <br>  I do judo and some of the guys in the dojo wear a shirt or rashguard under the gi, its kind of a personal preference I guess. They are not required to, but some of them like it cause they get sweaty and the t-shirt helps sop up the sweat and a rashguard helps to prevent friction burns from the gi.|`|mEZpqzkMaa	Most of us wear a shirt or at least a gi top. You don't want to have over exposed skin as you will likely get cuts and mat burn anyway. There is also the possibility of staff infection, which my instructor got one time.

8bTder08aa	Mrs. Genter got involved in Thoroughbred racing with her husband, Harold Genter. after attending the Kentucky Derby in 1938.  She and her husband bought their first horse in 1939, with their first stakes winner coming in 1941.  <br>  <br>  She and her husband were graduates of the University of Minnesota, and somewhere along the line their paths crossed with fellow Minnesotan "Minnesota Mac" William McKnight, Chairman and CEO of 3M company.  The Genters and McKnight had their Minnesota roots in common, and the Genters wintered in Florida where McKnight eventually established his Florida farm, Tartan Farm.  The Genters and McKnight developed a relationship based on their love of racing.  (McKnight was given a filly named Aspidistra as a gift from employees for his 70th birthday in 1957.  Aspidistra wasn't much of a star on the track, but became the dam of champions Ta Wee and Dr. Fager, among others.  The Genters owned Rough 'n' Tumble, who became Dr. Fager's sire).  <br>  <br>  The Genters also raced In Reality, from whom most of the current male-line descendants of Man O' War descend.  <br>  <br>  Frances Genter's husband died in 1981.  Her son-in-law, Bentley Smith, managed her stable and oversaw its dispersal after her death.  Harold Bentley continues to own horses.  He raced Lady Joanne in the 2007 Breeder's Cup.<br>  <br>  I've got some more stuff to post, but it's LATE here in California, must get rest!
fuYYRJXtaa	This recent All Star Game sucked... You can't compare the past ones to this trashy one... Plus they played in Phoenix... Next time, they should pick a big city like L.A., Houston, New York, Cleveland, etc!|`|50bEHtYfaa	Don't get me wrong I look forward to all-star week ever year, but all the all star game is one big joke. This year's all star week was not good. The best part about all star week this year was Shaq throwing the ball under the legs of Dwight Howard and then dunking it. And Nate Robinson's creative Kryptonite idea.|`|lMDy8W0Raa	they played in Phoenix this year, they forgot how to cheer, you can thank Kerr and Porter.|`|ZFTkBTvvaa	well most times the all star games are not crowded with fans, you have to be part of the media or a VIP to go to an all star game. and those people are not fans there are there to cover the game.<br>  <br>  that is mainly why.<br>  <br>  but since the economy is sucky right now, some ordinary people are getting tickets.|`|Lxj6kMklaa	Cause none of the players try, they are only there to have fun and fans don't enjoy it because it's not competetive enough.|`|WLXFAeSnaa	Overall, I have no idea.<br>  <br>  For this year, cuz the All-Star game SUCKED!|`|TrfDfpV0aa	i think the main reason is that the players don't care when they have to play in the all star game.  there is no defense so it's basically just like the dunk contest or three point shootout with more people on the court watching|`|Tgy7n4HLaa	They aren't impressed.
Tgy7n4HLaa	Pretty soon Rudy Gay and OJ Mayo are the stars of the future.|`|Jtt6SaVIaa	When they get a local owner that cares.|`|1ieKW07Naa	amazing =]|`|21J0IIZbaa	Mayo, Gay, and Gasol have been good pickup for Memphis.

Everyone said they didn't get enough for Gasol, which they didn't, but that's the past and some of thei transactions are starting to look good.<br>  <br>  - Trading Shane Battier for Rudy Gay<br>  - Trading Kevin Love/Mike Miller for OJ Mayo<br>  - Signing Darko Milicic<br>  <br>  They are starting to come together a bit.<br>  <br>  <br>  edit: I'm slow, Colonel|`|reIMLCKkaa	They have a good young team. Marc Gasol is a great future C, OJ is a future suoerstar Sg, Kobe played him 1 on 1 and praised Oj and Rudy Gay is a top Sf|`|Kwywmcs8aa	well they were pretty good 3 years ago don't exactly know what the heck happened to them besides not winning a single playoff game in 3 trips and 12 games.|`|u2QhQAxzaa	I give em 4 years and they will be contending for the 8th seed.  Looking at their history, they need to draft a better superstar to lead that team.
tW8fh4IGaa	This was the standard for many years but like you mentioned, the league is starting to see parity throughout with the new salary cap in place. There are still a few runaway teams, but everyone else is pretty similarly skilled.<br>  <br>  However, I believe the coaching and style of play from east to west is still slightly different. You see a lot more defensively sound games from western conference teams and usually a lot more offensive outbursts from eastern conference teams. This could be just a factor that a lot of the great draft picks in recent years (Crosby, Ovechkin, Malkin) went to eastern teams due to the west being overall better than the east for so many years.<br>  <br>  Overall though, I still think the west is better. I still believe that the Sharks and Red Wings are the two best teams in hockey. And if you look down the standings in each conference you see a much tighter race in the west where almost everyone is still fighting for a playoff spot as opposed to the east where they have a few teams running away, a few in the middle, and  few who are already out of playoff contention.|`|Pq5Ds8F2aa	I agree a few years ago who would have thought SJ would be one of the largest in what was know as the "Fast" West or Washington would have such speed and skill in the "Big" East.<br>  <br>  It's great for the sport though, every game should be a rivalry.|`|DhUMjZxtaa	GO AVS GO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  But I wish Roy was back :(|`|fJbWRwsmaa	We all miss Roy Steffa. But anyway, I think you're right. The conferences are each getting  a mix of talents and styles.|`|etErp8rcaa	It's true what you're saying, for sure. History has to be taken into account in assessing West Vs. East, though: The last 2 cups have gone to Western teams, and frankly, I don't think that will change this year. The West plays better defense, traditionally, and defense wins championships. The last few teams to make it to the finals or win it in the East have not remained contenders at all; Tampa Bay, Carolina, Ottawa, Pittsburgh.<br>  <br>  Well, the Pens might still be contenders. Never count out a team with Crosby and Malkin on it. Nevertheless, they are still in an abominable tenth in the East, and the postseason is approaching faster than they'd like. They'd better fix that team fast.|`|knOychnyaa	I think currently the East has more young skill.  The west i feel has those players that are always going to be good, i.e iginla, any red wing!!, or sakic.  The east would win i believe in an all out battle, and they seem to have the players that are the top in the league with getting points.  In the west, i just feel they are not playing as well as they could, but they will always have the skill.|`|t2qSCCfPaa	I think in today's game the East has more of the pretty boy star players (e.g. Ovechkin, Crosby, Malkin) while the West has more of a grind it out style focused more on team play than individual stardom. That's probably why 4 out of the top 5 scorers are from the East.  Just my opinion though|`|4crJhN62aa	West are alittle better in everything including toughness and talent, DETROIT IS STILL NUMBER 1 and Boston wouldn;t stand a chance against them in the Finals.Boston and there safe ugly style , they play such a boring game , great to watch them to help you sleep.|`|fV2RBwIJaa	I'm in agreement for sure, and I think it's great for the sport. Makes things far more interesting come trade times, especially for teams that will be looking to do BIG rebuilds like the Ducks and Leafs next season|`|Jf8LiEw2aa	The West, at least to me, seems like the more physical conference now, and they may be more skilled also.|`|VjAoRpIhaa	actually a few years ago it was the opposite, but there was talented teams in the west like detroit and physical teams like buffalo and philadelphia. but recently teams are more evenly balanced
KHznTmpsaa	for me I can eat and them swim. I just have to be careful what I do eat. I cant drink milk or eat most fruits before swim practice or I will throw up.

I yelled down to Doug Henry who was a pitcher with the Brewers (just called up) and called him a "Lancer Loser", which was the nickname of our high school.

If you go in with a plan, it will fail. You must keep your mind clear and flow through techniques.|`|LnJjS8BRaa	Shihan J is always one step ahead of me with the right answer.<br>  <br>  Use what you need to. Don't rely on one technique because it will fail when you need it most, that's Murphy's Law for you.Look for your opening and let the technique flow. <br>  <br>  If you're trying to remember how to do a musha dori or any other technique you've seen online or practiced once or twice in class it just isn't going to work for you when you need it. Anything you want to use in the wild you have to drill hundreds, even thousands of times. Furthermore, you have to drill it with "aliveness" because an attacker will not behave like a compliant training partner. This constant drilling will ingrain the techniques into your muscle memory allowing you to access them as reflex rather than recall.<br>  <br>  So work hard on your style and learn it so you can do it without thinking; this is the most important step because thinking takes time and time isn't something you have a lot of in an attack.<br>  <br>  My ultimate goal for self defense is avoiding fights.

q2TOb6unaa	You are right, the VVV is definitely a jib/park board but it will be able to ride down groomers, just not as well as other boards. I would only suggest buying it if you plan on going into the park more than 40% of the time or else you can find a much better board to fit your needs.<br>  <br>  If you don't think you will be in the park that much, here are some boards that will suit you better:<br>  K2 Mix<br>  K2 Fling<br>  GNU-B-Real<br>  Capita Saturnia <br>  Burton Stria<br>  Ride Canvas<br>  <br>  Check out this link and you're bound to find something you'll like: <a href="http://www.dogfunk.com/dogfunk/group/100000311/Womens-Freestyle-Snowboards.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfunk.com/dogfunk/group/100...</a> Their all listed as freestyle but most of them are all mountain freestyle. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|LIKkt8djaa	If you're talking about just going down groomers then sure yeah it's fine, pretty much anyboard is more then capable of that. If you're talking about hitting the backcountry and deep powder glades then you should be looking elsewhere.|`|WTw9BSOYaa	If you plan on learning Park and riding at least 25% of your time in the park, Id say go for it, but try to be on the high side of the weight ratio for the length you buy, doing this will make the board a bit stiffer for you and easier to ride groomers with.<br>  Also try and find a VVV Rocker. Rocker decks are a lot easier to learn things like presses on, and you can also ride a smaller deck with them because the effective edge is longer than non-Rocker decks of the same length, but being that you aren't looking to be a park rat, that shouldn't mean much to you.|`|qqt0GTW8aa	I have the K2 Va Va Voom Rocker.<br>  I do love this board but it is not as good in the powder like an all mountain board would be.  You have to lean back way more than you would normally but it is doable and works fine for me because I don't really hit the back country with it (I have another board for that).<br>  If you do plan on doing a lot of back country riding I would recommend getting a different board more suitable for this.

SBBnWsJJaa	Interestingly, sleep apnea mirrors breathing difficulties that happen at altitude (Cheyne-Stokes breathing).  <br>  <br>  Not having sleep apnea, I think that Willie gives some good advice - especially since you are athletic and you don't seem to use the CPAP machine.  <br>  <br>  You may want to consider taking some diamox (acetazolomide) - I DO use this as a sleep aid at altitude because it helps to regulate my breathing at night.<br>  <br>  Also - take your time and acclimate on the way up.|`|qyATAaeXaa	Yes. I have sleep apnea and go for days without using the machine in the backcountry. If anything your noisy nose will annoy the others in the party.

Given also the number of Asian and west Indians there it is surprising that they don't have a cricket team or play Rugby as any country which claims to be civilised does!|`|0267b4b30705032220d53177414ef86aaa	Soccer! .................BOOOOOORING.<br>  <br>  You want to know why soccer is not as popular in north america??

I'm guessing Soccer is very similar in that respect. It's the cheering like crazy in front of the tv set, the face-paint, the banners, the jerseys and t-shirts and caps, the flags, the "my team is better than yours," the beers, the food, the atmosphere. <br>  ....In THIS respect, sports are all equal, I guess.

They tend to have trouble with San Jose, Detroit, and Chicago, and they'll most probably be running into one of those teams in round 2.<br>  <br>  San Jose should take it this year, even though they're historical let-downs in the postseason. That team seems very solid. They finally have the puck movers on the blueline that they've always seemed to lack before, and everything is clicking.<br>  <br>  Then again, I also like the other number 1: Boston. They've come out of nowhere this year, and they just seem to have incredible chemistry for some reason. Very consistent in an Eastern division that thoroughly lacks consistency this season.<br>  <br>  My overall choice? The Bs.|`|AA10416039	How can you pick against the Red Wings?

Washington has Alex Ovechkin who is dominant in and of himself and he raises the level of play around him.

Even though I am reluctant to pick them again, I think that this may be the year it actually happens.

I think they are a very well-balanced team and have the ability to hang with any top team in the league this year. Out of the upper-tier teams, if it comes to 6-7 games each round I really think the Bruins have the ability to outlast a SJ, Det, let alone anyone else in the top 6.

3teWTOPqaa	I think it's too early to tell, but I think right now Nash has a green light to do whatever he wants to on offense and that's paid off in the two games against the Clippers.<br>  <br>  Yeah I would like to see Kobe vs Shaq in the playoff, David Stern will want that too after seeing what one weekend of Kobe&Shaq can do, imagine a whole series.|`|u2QhQAxzaa	They played the Clippers.  Even if Suns had Terry Porter still, I think the Suns could blow out the Clippers.<br>  <br>  Yeah SUNS Lakers would be interesting to watch.Lakers would win though.|`|qq1fSV2daa	the old suns are long gone ... but the new suns are gaining much needed chemistry.. i wouldn't get too  excited though .. i don't believe their recent success will last .. and if they were to face the lakers in the playoffs then would be embarrassed .. the lakers are a far superior team .. the suns wouldn't take one game in the series|`|mW209Ma3aa	yes, they were back for 2 games and sum more against weak opponents.  they dont stand a chance against teams like lakers, spurs, and ofcourse the celtics.  remember, those old suns also had marion and raja bell and diaw...these suns have shaq.|`|P93I8CHtaa	too early,i want to see not trading amare and shaq is worth it|`|Jp2415Whaa	I really hope so.  Cant tell until Sunday vs. Celtics.|`|QuLapuE7aa	It's too early to tell, I like to see if the suns can dominate the good teams like they did when they play the clippers two times in a row. I guess they're back to the run and gun again scoring 140 in two games isn't easy to do.<br>  <br>  actually the Lakers will face the Suns on February 26, but we will be without Andrew Bynum it's going to be fun to watch with Shaq facing off Kobe again. It's run and gun versus the long line-up of the Lakers.<br>  <br>  :D|`|K9nWS2kIaa	yeah their a 100% back...i really want them to huv a good playoff run. i think they'll play alright now, and this is shaq's last year, so i think he's gonna play harder too....and steve nash is getting his hands back too!<br>  i'm so pissed, they huv so many good players and they can be on the top like Lakers, Cavcs, and Celtics but they just don't seem to give it their all...but the two wins scoring 140+ was amazing, even though it was only the Clippers. i hope they make the Finals....even though its not likely...|`|U3KAgO0baa	Style wise YES tallent wise NO!<br>  they just dont have guys that fit the run and gun style (or atleast not as many as they used 2)<br>  1.

CtHUGYrvaa	Yes they will, i think down the stretch if yao and artest can stay healthy and their bench is contirbuting that theyll be some where around the 5-6 playoff spot in the west.|`|IxHKrMtWaa	Losing Rafer and T-Mac isn't easy.

Look for Battier to bring his A game every night, and for the bench production to exceedingly rise. Yao is the only leader of that team now. ( excluding Artest )|`|2OoSK35xaa	With T-Mac done for the yea, I would say probably not, and even if they do, the first round will be their last round.  They need to find some more durable players with T-Mac and Yao constantly hurt.|`|tBuzrlSdaa	Probably maybe but if they get in they will get knocked out easily in my opinion without TMac and Rafer|`|u2QhQAxzaa	If they can avenge the loss of Tracy McGrady and hold onto a winning record.  They will probably be the 6th or 7th seed.
YHYT8qMKaa	My favorite Jeff Gordon was the last driver to win the first two races of the season. It happened in 1997, winning at Daytona and North Carolina.<br>  <br>  I think Matt can repeat the feat. California is one of his best tracks. I think he will have have a strong run on Sunday and at least have a top ten finish.<br>  <br>  And I do think some of the drivers that had a bad 500 will run pretty good this week. I'm keeping my eyes on Kyle Busch, Dale Jr., Brian Vickers, and Jimmie Johnson.|`|a5BhsLeQaa	Jeff Gordon was the last driver to win the first two points races of the season. He did so in 1997 winning Daytona and Rockingham. And yes I think Matt Kenseth could do it. Historically he's always been good at Fontana. Yes I think drivers will bounce back this week, it's hard to take anything away from anybody at a restrictor plate track.|`|wjnF2wolaa	Jeff Gordon remains the only driver since 1997 to win the first two races in a season, anything is possible with the lack of testing, money, and the wild card of drivers' experience as well as the weather.|`|UbR8EfMxaa	jeff gordon.|`|mIdcJEJNaa	Jeff Gordon back in 97... It's not an everyday thing..<br>  And by all means Matt Kenseth is a really good, and consistent driver, get's great gas mileage, and has a really good history in Cali...<br>  And he is motivated.. I think Daytona energized him, and reminded him that he was capable of doing some driving, and was still competitive...<br>  When Jr, and Matt were competing in the Busch series, Dale Sr knew his kid was good, or he would have never built an entire business around him...<br>  Dale Earnhardt said that Matt was better..

But, you never know. 43 guys have a chance at winning the race.<br>  <br>  Yes, Jeremy Mayfield, Brian Vickers, Carl Edwards, Jamie McMurray, and Kyle Busch will all rebound at California.
KmMRHKTNaa	Chuy why u got to make it hard?<br>  Eto'o-23 goals in 22 games. villa only 18. but if they switched teams villa would be better.<br>  Iniesta-Sneijder hasnt been his best, out of position and iniesta is better.<br>  Pato-He is getting more opportunities then bojan and looking great at ac milan, he is a regular. Bojan is not playing if he did bojan would be better.Look<br>  Cole-He's being better then bastian this season<br>  Xavi-Best mid in the world, pirlo is not having his best of years.Pirlo seems hes always out of position, and he relies too much on past perfomances.|`|8zgFyfibaa	1.David villa or samuel eto'o- samuel eto'o takes it he scores some good goals yet,he doesn't get the credit he deserves because he's overshadowed by messi and henry.

Don't know those two players so I can't say who's better.<br>  <br>  5.andrea pirlo or xavi hernandes- I say xavi taes it he is a great player that's why he was nominated as the best player of the year award.

09s0r130aa	I totally agree with you.  As for Orton, Jericho, and Edge they always get cheered for i guess by the "rebellious" people.  JBL is a very boring character but a impressive heel.  I think he is the best heel in the last 5-6 years BUT there is Vickie Guerrero who in 1 1/2 years gets booed so much that you cant even hear what she is saying. Right?|`|F5JXQUEAaa	Yeah man I completly agree. I'm a huge Edge, Orton and Jericho fan, espicially Orton. I think most heels get cheered for now a days, I find that kinda cool. But yeah, your completly right, nobody likes JBL. Not sure if it's because he does his job right or maybe he's just so boring nobody wants to see him.|`|yEsw7UkWaa	Yep, that's true.<br>  The others are at least enjoyable, but JBL induces automatic yawn syndrome.<br>  And the more I don't want to see him the slower he seems to talk!|`|CtLncY3Caa	your funny but i agree b cuz when chris, edge, or orton come out i look foward to it most of the time|`|QlcGYKs4aa	Randy Orton and Edge are cheered by some people because they're very likable. and even though i've always hated jericho, there are still some y2j fans out there. but JBL is everything the wrestling fans hate.<br>  plus, unlike the other 3, jbl has not sported any gold at all in his current run on raw. while JBL is a cool guy in real life and it would be cool to see him and Ron Simmons restart the APA, his current job is a heel. but Orton is the best, cuz he's like the Rock. he's supposed to be a heel, but u just can't help but cheer for him.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	JBL does his job effectively. Hes the best heel on Raw IMO, because NOONE cheers him, while Jericho and Orton gets support from a portion of the crowd. JBL is a great talker and does his job very well.

rNqF4gIVaa	Steel grades generally tell you how much carbon is in the steel. The higher the number the more carbon. Aside from quality of manufacture, the better swords tend to be 1060 or more. Few quality swords are made from 1045. Which DOES NOtT hold an edge better (quite the reverse). Swords made of these different steels weigh about the same. That is, if you made two identical looking swords - one of 1095 the other of 1045, they would weigh the same.<br>  1045 is only more commonly used because cheaper swords tend to be made from it.<br>  <br>  Edit: No real swords are made from stainless steel.|`|BbK0fA4Laa	1045 is a medium carbon steel is used when greater strength and hardness is desired than in the "as rolled" condition. Extreme size accuracy, straightness and concentricity combine to minimize wear in high speed applications. <br>  <br>  1095 is a high carbon steel, but does not hold as sharp an edge. 1095 high carbon steel is harder and more durable than 440C stainless steel, but will rust much more easily. Stainless steel is more brittle than both 5160 and 1095 carbon steel, but is still very useful due to its resistance to rust and corrosion.|`|r5AMG8g7aa	Peter Gunn Gave a good answer...   Jason mentioned Stainless steel. Stainless steel should be avoided at all cost. Stainless steel is responsible for some really nasty injuries. It has a bad habit of shattering. It is a terrible steel for swords.|`|oTb67zNYaa	in any real way it does not matter what form of high carbon steel your blade is made of unless you are intending to use the sword often or against more damaging materials take care of your sword and be careful|`|444cc0a50021891de69824c19550f54daa	the grade of the sword is one aspect but there's more to it.<br>  the quality of the sword itself is a much more important factor<br>  a good quality 1045 grade blade can often be much better than a medium quality 1060 or 1095 blade.  the quality of the work is much more important than the grade of the steel|`|3DnX9NmAaa	Not sure. Personally I don't know much about steel. I only know that if I'm spending money on a sword, it's going to be 9260 steel or stronger. A lot of it also depends on the tempering process the forge uses.

Both are explosive and add options.  I would pick Gayle first (and I'm  a Kiwi).  He gives you a tight bowling option and is great with the bat.  so is McCullum but it is a hard choice.|`|NKN7SeDtaa	i would say Brendon McCullum beause he is a dangerous man who can change one match instantly and also is a wicket keeper... but as for chris gayle his too slow and a bit boring and is really ment for test matches!!|`|ikDtDL7Vaa	chris gayle a genuine allrounder and a more attaking player. also a great match winner. and in T20 you can afford to have a not so brilliant WK.|`|XVYRUzkEaa	McCullum = Only that 155 innings against Royal Challengers in IPL, not in good form<br>  <br>  Gayle = Great Average, better SR, Good bowler, good fielder, consistant|`|1uLfl0sXaa	Sorry, I won't take your fellow national; nothing against him, he's a clean hitter and wk, but Gayle will be better in a T20 format where WK is not all that important; more important for me would be Gayle's 4 overs and his hitting|`|BJ7XidIVaa	I like McCullum...<br>  I think i would rather have The current world No1 keeper that an average bowler...|`|87D3wCufaa	Neither.

Sting had an epic rivalry with Ric Flair for so many years.  Then, when Flair left, Sting carried the WCW on his shoulders.  Sting has won many belts and World Titles.<br>  <br>  Sting has also fought some of the greats of the game, Ric Flair, Hulk Hogan, the Undertaker (when he was Mark Callous), Barry Windham, Arn Anderson, Kurt Angle, the Road Warriors, Booker T, Lex Lugar, Jeff Jarrett, Steve Austin, Rick Rude, the Stieners, Brett Hart, Eddie Gilbert, Mike Rotundo, Kevin Nash, Scott Hall<br>  <br>  The only matches I wish I could have seen were:<br>  The Ultimate Warrior vs. Sting, almost happened if Warrior would have signed with WCW in the early 90's.  Warrior was supposed to be the Black Scorpion<br>  <br>  HBK vs. Sting<br>  <br>  HHH vs. Sting<br>  <br>  John Cena vs. Sting<br>  <br>  Randy Orton vs. Sting<br>  <br>  Edge vs. Sting|`|7gHnVJpyaa	Certainly, "Roxanne" is one of the best hit singles ever written...<br>  <br>  And he was never in the WWE, as far as I know...|`|KlMMOJaLaa	definitely...|`|QlcGYKs4aa	without a doubt. and don't rule out sting from the WWE completely. the main reason he never joined the WWE was because he never thought the company was family friendly. since the WWE has become more PG than TNA, look for sting to seriously consider the WWE. but knowing vince, it probably won't happen. but sting is a future hall of famer in the WWE. even though he never worked for them. neither did Verne Gagne, but he's in there.|`|QwCsFKLQaa	sting sets the example for all wrestlers to follow , he is the best ever , mostly because hes not a sellout,  mcmahon ruined wrestling,  <br>  <br>   haven't watched it it 15 years.|`|U3KAgO0baa	IMO he is the 4th best wrestler EVER the man Single handedly Built WCW, and it would have folded long b4 02 if it wasnt for sting<br>  BTW this is my top 5<br>  1.Shawn Michaels<br>  2.Ric Flair<br>  3.Rickey "the Dragon" Steamboat<br>  4.Sting<br>  5.Booker T (thats right Its my list and IMO he is one of the best workers EVER)|`|qUDas0R4aa	Personally im a stone cold fan, but who else would come into the ring with a baseball bat, that was the sh*t I definitly think he had the best entrance song though, seek and destroy by metallica.|`|bT0kyzRPaa	sting ddp and the red nwo were the reason i liked wcw better than wwf since the begining... he was always my favorite... my brothers alsdo|`|YTLlMdhDaa	Definitely top 10 of all time.

Def. one of the best.|`|wMh38OzVaa	No he isn't.his choose not to work with the WWE was a mistake on his part.His leaving wrestling(for a time) was a bad move to.He may have been a great wrestler but he isn't one of the greatest.|`|f4ehvRQlaa	Sting's cool!
1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa	Vince McMahon.  Without Vince becoming a bigger heel (Mr McMahon) than Austin was, Austin would not have become the famous "hero" to the fans that he eventually became.  Sure, we all loved his battles with The Rock, Mick Foley, the Hart brothers, etc. but it was his battle with the evil Mr McMahon that got EVERYBODY behind Stone Cold and made him the biggest star in the wrestling world.  Stone Cold Steve Austin was the defining character of the "Attitude Era", because he embodied what that whole Era was about: defying authority.  Without Vince being the perfect enemy for Stone Cold, the character wouldn't have been as monstrously successful as it was.<br>  <br>  Plus, I want to see Vince publicly pay tribute to one of the guys who made him truckloads of money.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	J.R. I know Austin wants Flair to do it, but it makes more sense to have J.R. do it since they have a more storied history on TV together|`|IMu3wBu8aa	J.R. They are close, and J.R. probably knows him better than anyone else. He's a current HOF member himself. It works.|`|j9GokH9Qaa	Good old J.R.. or The Rock, since they had the best feud in WWF!|`|9ijwrcTZaa	My obvious answers are dead, Chris Adams and Brian Pillman.<br>  <br>  Any of the following would be great to induct him:<br>  <br>  The Rock, they had an epic rivalry<br>  Vince McMahon, their fued brought back the WWF<br>  Bret Hart, returning the favor and helped usher in the Stone Cold Attitude era<br>  Eric Bischoff, the man who fired him from WCW<br>  Jim Ross, Stone Colds best friend in the business<br>  His daughters<br>  Paul Heyman, allowed for the grooming of the Stone Cold persona in ECW|`|yEsw7UkWaa	I would be very surprised if it was anyone other than JR.<br>  They have the friendship and the history needed to make a "good" induction.<br>  Once JR starts talking about Austin there may be no shutting him up though   LOL<br>  <br>  I don't think it will be Rock as he inducted his dad and uncle last year.|`|1yOdrYiHaa	JR hands down...realistically nobody else can. i dont really see undertaker,triple h, or anyone else doing it.JR is a great candidate and Stone Cold is a shoe in for Hall of Fame|`|xKXu0Qb2aa	It Shouldn't be ANYONE Other Than JR.<br>  No Question.<br>  Period.|`|3ts5o118aa	i think Vince should. or if not have a few different people like Austin, The Rock and JR|`|5jIdcbyYaa	Bret Hitman Hart since stone cold inducted him.|`|25HCZmPZaa	JR or VINCE MCMAHON|`|MzUZ5GZ2aa	well i heard he wants ric flair!

MnjOXJnJaa	yes, many are hypocrites. and if you believed him when he said he didn't do steroids, the joke's on you. i don't like having a pessimistic view of others, but it's called the Steroids Era. it was common. before you go Rick Reilly and start pronouncing Pujols the best of the time "because he did it clean," you better be pretty sure. i don't trust any stats from that period. i'm sure some are legit, but...<br>  <br>  and why does A-Rod owe us the truth? just because a worthless journalist stuck a mic in his face? what would you say? and he lied to her (Couric) before anyone else came clean or went to court or Congress for it. he figured people would believe him and it would go away. all i'm saying is that i don't expect honesty and ethical behavior from a group that makes tens or hundreds of millions of dollars for their performance. i like to think i would do the right thing, but i've never been there and can't even imagine the pressure. <br>  <br>  i thought it was obvious, so i'm annoyed by all the attention. and also by him taking every chance to talk. shut up and let it die down!|`|5EuOTAjJaa	No. <br>  Hippocrates was a famous Greek physician.|`|axxQzOCHaa	ABSOLUTELY NOT .. many fans, including myself, are disgusted with how millionaires continue to cheat. I am not convinced that he's come completely clean. I don't have this information myself, but does anyone have access to his HS height and weight? He may have been taking steroids with the Mariners, and with the advancements in medicine it's possible that they've even come up with untraceable drugs which he could still be taking<br>  <br>  ps = it's spelled hYpocrites|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Well, depends.  I mean, everyone has lied at some point, but I can say I've never lied about anything on national tv to the world.  Also, at least with most people I know, if they're going to come clean about something, and specifically say they're coming clean and telling all the truth, most people usually tell the truth then.<br>  <br>  I mean, yeah, A-Roid lied in the Katie Couric interview, hell, I'm sure most people would in that situation.  The thing that makes A-Roid lose all credibility is that he sat down for an ESPN interview with Peter Gammons to come clean, and he lied there too.  Why insult the general public by stating you're coming here to come clean and then lie to us again.<br>  <br>  In case you don't know what I'm talking about, Peter Gammons asked him what he used, where he got it, etc, and A-Roid said he didnt really know.  A week later he comes on to a press conference stating that he got this substance called boli from his cousin, that his cousin told him about it, got it for him, injected him with it, etc.  So, how can one man go from knowing nothing to knowing full details in less than a week?  Short term amnesia?<br>  <br>  On top of that, none of his final story actually checks out.  Experts have stated they've never heard of "boli".  The actual drugs he tested positive for, Primobolan and testosterone, were never mentioned and are illegal in both the US and the Dominican.  <br>  <br>  So, if you want to know why people think A-Roid is a liar, thats why.  Its pretty much proven that he's lied every step of the way and he's still lying now.|`|mW209Ma3aa	I DON UNDERSTAND WHY THE HELL ARE PEOPLE LIKE..."ITS OK, I FORGIVE HIM..BLAH BLAH BLAH!"...WUT THE HELL?..WUT BOUT BONDS?...C MON PEOPLE, U BLAME ONE THEN BLAME EM ALL!...ITS B.S HOW THEY HATE BONDS FOR USIN STEROIDS BUT STILL LIKE A-ROD FOR SAME THING..I DOUBT HE USED EM FOR ONLY 3 YRS, BESIDES, HE HIT 156 IN THOSE 3 SEASONS...C MON...EITHER HATE BONDS AND A-ROD TOO OR APPRECIATE BONDS AS WELL.|`|36zm5zK8aa	who knows. everything with arod is always questioned, always dramatic. he cant do anything about it now, so the media should just let it go.|`|fQIxah8laa	It depends if they didn't believe him when he denied he used steroids the first time. If they did this time,, well then they're hypocrites.|`|Ty4Hdm2Haa	There are a few reasons that people have problems with calling what A-rod did "coming clean".  <br>  <br>  1.  His story keeps changing.  Every time he opens his mouth we learn there is something more.<br>  <br>  2.  His stories don't add up.  Congrats on admitting to taking a banned substance but why tell weird stories filled with details that don't make sense.  The substance he said he got over the counter from the Dominican Republic was not sold there (from 2001-2003) even with a perscription.  What that means is that the substance was not over the counter and it was obtained illegally.  Whether he was given bad information or he is lying it just makes him look bad.<br>  <br>  3.  He says he didn't know what he was injecting into his body.  Come on now.  If you are not at a hospital or being treated by a doctor why would you let someone inject you with something if you didn't know what it was, what exactly it would do, or even if it was being injected the wright way.  Furthermore he called this expiramenting.  When you do something regularly for 3 years you are not expiramenting you have a full blown habit.  <br>  <br>  Everyone does tell lies from time to time but we don't all tell lies about doing illegal things at work.  We also don't all go on 60 minutes, ESPN or hold press conferences to broadcast them nationally or even world wide.  If you want to lie to everyone on the planet about something that many people feel strongly about, you have to expect a backlash.|`|YCwmCDkUaa	I think most people...ok, some people...would have let it go...<br>  <br>  I don't think he should be allowed into the HOF until MLB lets Pete Rose into the HOF...<br>  <br>  Also...it turns out that A-Roid lied about the drug he used...since it's been reported that it wasn't sold OTC during the years he said he and "his cousin" bought it.<br>  -----------------<br>  <br>  By the way...the only reason A-Roid "came clean"...although he lied again...was because he got caught...not because it was he right thing to do...|`|KTQWtNGFaa	Just because someone came clean and stopped lying doesn't make it better. He should still be severely punished with Bonds, Clemens, and all of the people associated with the thing that is ruining one of the best sports there is|`|nUoGtwnqaa	Hippocrates was an ancient Greek physician of the Age of Pericles, and was considered one of the most outstanding figures in the history of medicine. He is referred to as the "father of medicine". <br>  <br>  So no, I don't think any people out there criticizing A-Rod are Hippocrates. Hypocrites, maybe, but certainly not Hippocrates. He is dead.<br>  <br>  But seriously, people don't believe him because he is the best at what he does, and others like to see those people fall. After a while, people will realize that he did the right thing by owning up to it and talking about it, and the issue will die down. Especially if he keeps playing at a hall-of-fame level while passing the steroids tests.
ZAh8CEoGaa	If Dwight jumped behin|`|HLzS2z9laa	none of them deserved to be in the dunk contest in first place, Dwight does lead the nba in dunks but come on, for the dunk contest you need high flyers who can actualy do something creative in the air, Dwight is too tall to make it look nice and Nate is too short to hit some nice, I wanna see lebron and carmelo next season|`|u2QhQAxzaa	No i feel Nate Robinson won fair and square.  Dwight would of won if his last dunk was better.|`|2OoSK35xaa	Howard had better first and second dunks, but his third dunk was very blah.  I thought Howard should have used his side of the backboard dunk in the last round or the Super man one then.  The foul line dunk would be fine for Round 1.  Nate had a better dunk in the last round, but Howard had the better 2 dunks to start.|`|NmXKPDoIaa	Dwight: Just made the free throw line dunk look to easy.<br>  <br>  He should of took off 2 or 3 feet above the Free throw line.

ULSUqmeZaa	It would be less complicated if HHH went to RAW and Smackdown get someone in return (probably Cena). Only one move. WWE is also trying to get RAW ratings back up and when HHH was on the show this week, it went up big.<br>  <br>  Pretty much everybody knows that they are married in real life so it really doesn't matter. They might put something in like they got re-married or they never really got divorced or something.<br>  <br>  I also loved Triple H and Stephanie when they were together..|`|gi0haHtdaa	Your weird|`|pnsp765saa	Its not rocket science. They were divorce in a storyline. In real life they are married. They are no longer going with the old storyline but the real life. My idea is have Shane take control of Raw and have Stephanie GM of Smackdown and they fight each other|`|bc830b1601cd7380ec1f17c83fef3a4eaa	You are thinking too much to be watching wrestling. Since Stephanie McMahon took over, continuity has been inconsistent. She and her staff do not care about the past unless it is to exploit. They also have a problem with kayfabe angles and bringing backstage problems to the ring. This whole HHH/Stephanie/Randy Orton thing is OK, but bringing in the entire McMahon family to move it along is too much. They should have kept the Vince and the Stephanie/HHH angle out of it.
CXmVwshQaa	Its a little different because you have more protection because the shorts cant slide up or anything.

AA12170560	Start with the position you have the most familiarity with.<br>  <br>  But the bottom line is, you play where the coach puts you.<br>  He puts you where he needs you - so if you are "a bit faster than other kids" you may find yourself in a position where you'll be called on to run.<br>  <br>  What's most important is that you try out for the team.<br>  <br>  As you grow and develop you will find your niche|`|xxtvhn5Naa	Well, you didn't say to much info... but based on the info provided, it looks like you would be good at one of these positions:  WR, RB, CB, or S.  You aren't really tall, and for these positions, you don't have to be super tall.  All of these positions require speed, and you have it.  Being strong is a bonus.|`|DNKNI27Baa	you sound pretty average.  well compared to me...haha jk. do you have good hands? quick feet? you need to expand on your question.|`|2obPKDr0aa	wide receiver<br>  Qb's love tall receivers|`|AeYeR5KQaa	If your light and fast I'd go for wide receiver or running back.|`|U3KAgO0baa	1st Can you kick? lol jkjk<br>  maybe if you are fast u should try WR, a Wes Welker type thing...|`|SbKXUrcFaa	Just based on this, and your build (medium), you should definitely consider WR or CB or S. Speed and coordination are key for this position, so work on that while training. <br>  <br>  However, you might still be growing.

Its topped off with a 4-12X50MM rifle scope..... This of course is for longer range shooting to 250 yards -- The rifle and scope I have are more capable than that but not in my old hands.....

Get a leupold scope, and you are set.  Take you pick of calibers.  Anything in tthe .30-06 family will work.  For elk and other large game, .30-06 is just fine.  .35 Whelen is another option, that adds some extra knock down power without too much added recoil.  The magnum rounds are not really needed for what you are looking at.  Check out Remington, Savage, Winchester and Ruger for your basic, good quality gun.  Pick the one with the features that you like.  Despite what people say, there isn't all that much of an advantage of one versus another.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	Remington or Savage Brand in 30-06 caliber is your Best choice.* You have a vast amount of bullet weights to choose from for Hunting Varmints, or any Big Game including Lion Tiger, Leopard, Cape Buffalo, Eland.* The 30-06 has earned its name and  reputation after making 15 consecutive one-shot kills on American Game.* The vast majority of Big And Small Game is harvested within 100 yards or less.*|`|dAK8dS4kaa	dang $1500 for a rifle n scope.

The reason for this is because 1) they are big enough for what you want to do and 2) the ammo is cheap.  Cheap ammo means more practicing.  More practicing means more confidence, which means when the moment of truth comes you're ready.  No wounded game running a mile and half before they die.  The bigger magnum cartridges do offer more energy and velocity, but they kick like a mule (less likely to practice and it just hurts) and the price of ammo is outrageous.  I don't remember the caliber, but I almost fell over laughing when I saw a box of 20 bullets for $120.  Not a chance my friend.  the -06 will kill anything in North America and you can get good hunting ammo for $18.  And finally about all these new high dollar magnum cartridges.  They were introduced by people who wanted to offer the "latest and greatest" so they could charge more for the ammo and get you to buy another rifle.  In hunting situations, their advantages in no way make up for their premium price.<br>  <br>  Rifle next.  Really any big name brand will offer you a great rifle in the $800-$1000 range.  Remington 700, Tikka T3, Savage 12/112 or 16/116 are all great choices.  Hold them all and see which one you are most comfortable shouldering.  One consideration is weight.  Are you going to be hiking all day?  You probably don't want to lug around a 13lb setup when a 8lb will do the job.<br>  <br>  Scopes last.  This depends greatly on where you hunt and how long your shots will be.  3-10x is a pretty good range of magnification for just about any situation.  Look to spend about $300-$400 for scopes and rings.  Burris Fullfied II and Nikon Monarch are both excellent scopes.  I have the FFII in 4.5-14 and love it to death.  Here's a little tip for you.  Even cheap scopes look good in the middle of the day.  The higher price tags are justified in low light conditions--which is a common shot while hunting. Don't skimp on the scope!!<br>  <br>  And for any extra money you've got... buy some ammo and hit the range!!<br>  <br>  Holy smokes, this turned out to be long.|`|dpSr0icwaa	Ask yourself some asthetic questions.  Are you interested in beautiful wood and bright blue, or do you prefer synthetic stocks and stainless steel barrels.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I suggest looking for a rifle in the $700-$1000 range, and look at spending about $300-400 on the scope.  Round out the rest with paying for a gunsmith to properly mount the scope, a nice sling, and a very strong rifle case, something rated for airline travel.<br>  <br>  For rifles, yes the Remington 700 is an excellent choice, but also look at the CZ 550, the Browning Xbolt or Abolt, or the Thompson Icon.<br>  <br>  A lot of people would put Winchester model 70 up there too, but they shut down the winchester gun making business for about a year, and I don't know of the company that bought them is doing a good job now or not.<br>  <br>  Note, these are all good rifles, but if you want to save a little money, look at Savage.  They make very solid rifles for the $400-600 price range, same with the Remington 770 and Remingtion 798 (that's just a remington imported mauser).  However, I'd steer clear of the Mossberg, Marlin, and Remington 710.<br>  <br>  As this ties into scopes I'll add it here too.  You can get some pretty economical rifles by Savage and Remington in 'package deals'  with a scope on top.  Sometimes there isn't an unscoped equivalent.  These are good deals, but the scopes are junk.  It is a good starting point, and you can swap out the scope a year later for a good $150-200 scope and have a damn fine deer gun.<br>  <br>  Okay for scopes.  It is easy to go wrong here.  For starters, it is easier to make a small lense than a big lense.  Second, variable scopes are more complex and hence more expensive to make.  This means a straight 4X scope priced at $100 is probably a strong and decent quality scope, but a $100 scope that is a 3-12x variable is probably junk.<br>  <br>  Spend your money on quality, not on POWER.  I don't think many hunters have much use for power over 9x, and really most would do just fine with a 4x.  2-7x or similar is a GREAT selection because it is light weight and 7x is a LOT of zoom.  However, 3-9x is more common and that is an okay choice.<br>  <br>  Besides power, you also have ojbective bell size.  The bigger the bell the more light that can be gathered.  Sounds good, but it can be just the opposite.  You don't want to pay for more light gathering than your eyes can use.  Europeans like 50mm objectives...but these are for nighttime hunting.  A 3-9x scope cranked to full 9x only needs to be 40mm to provide all the light than the eye can use at dawn and dusk.  Heck, 35mm is probably fine.  Still a 3-9x 40mm or 42mm is quite common, and not a bad choice.  But then I always liked the 2-7x 30mm or 32mm or 35mm.<br>  <br>  there are a ton of different makers, and these makers tend to have economy lines, midgrade lines, good lines, and supurb lines. A $200 scope is more than twice as good as a $100 scope.  A $300 scope is maybe a step over the $200, but I don't really see a huge advantage in quality if you step up to $500 or $600.<br>  <br>  Here are some names to look for.<br>  <br>  Leupold Vari X-I, Vari X-II, and Vari-X-III  those are basically 3 different grades of 'middle ground' scopes, with X-I being the $200 end and X-III being the $400 end.   They make even fancier Leupolds, and even cheaper Leupolds, but these 3 are the heart of the line.  Buy based on your budget.<br>  <br>  Nikon is another great scope line.  Look for Buckmark to be the equivalent of the V-I, and look for the name Monarch to be the V-II equivalent.  Prostaff carries the Nikon name and is pretty good, but is not nearly as good as a Buckmaster, and a Buckmaster is normally just a little bit more money<br>  <br>  the third name I'll throw out is Bushnell Elite 3200 and Bushnell Elite 4800.  Bushnell probably has more different brand names than the others mentioned, all the way from the $49.99 to the Elite 6500 for $599.99,  Avoid them both.  the Elite 3200 is the same quality as the Leupold V-I and the 4200 = V-II<br>  <br>  Finally, I'll add that Weaver is a classic great scope as well.  They are probably the 'go to brand' if you want a 4x fixed or a 6x fixed rather than a 2-7x variable or a 3-9x variable.  They have the Classic K line for fixed, usually around $150, and that is a lot of scope for the money.  They have a Classic-V for variable, and that is good, but I think the other 3 give better value on variable.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Oh, and I forgot to add, the 2 most universal catridges for a good do anything big game rifle are going to be 30-06 and 270 winchester.  They can handle anything.  They wouldn't be my first choice for a pissed off grizzly bear who is holding a grudge, but aside from that, you can't go wrong.  I personally would suggest the 270 winchester, it recoils a little less and shoots a little flatter.|`|uGouDvlXaa	Many hunters use 7mm and .300 Magnum combination elk and deer rifles for all of their deer hunting. <br>  <br>  Good calibers for long-range deer rifles include the .243 Winchester, 6mm Remington, .243 WSSM, .240 Wby. Mag., .25 WSSM, .257 Roberts +P, .25-06 Remington, .257 Wby. Mag., 6.5x55, .260 Remington, 6.5mm Rem. Mag., .270 Winchester, .280 Remington, and 7mm-08 Remington. The .270, 7mm and .300 Magnum calibers are also common, particularly with those who hunt elk or other large species with the same rifle. Of these, the 7mm Rem. Mag. is the most popular. Not to be forgotten are the .30-06 Springfield and .308 Winchester, particularly when shooting 150 grain bullets.<br>  <br>  Scope<br>  <br>  Well, there are plenty of them to choose from. I find myself gravitating towards Sightron at the low end of the price scale, now that I have tried a couple, and liked them. The high end, for me, would be Leupold (excluding their cheaper Rifleman series) - but there are others that cost more and offer better optics... but to me, the improvement in quality doesn't justify their high prices.

e86711010917d5eb4befa3b4a9c55f1caa	control.  Look at guys like kenny rogers last year.  Or knuckle ball pitchers.  I would go with control in a second.|`|AA12074189	Control is the most important. Look at Greg Maddux, one of the greatest pitchers of all time. His fast ball even in his prime was always in the high 80's at best. But he was a control master. He could put the ball anywhere he wanted in the strike zone. He put the ball in almost impossible to hit places. The other two qualities are helpful, but just having good velocity doesnt make a great pitcher (look at Rick Vaughn from Major League, or for a real pitcher a young Randy Johnson. Johnson wasnt a great pitcher when he was young fireballer for the Mariners even though he could throw the ball in the high 90's, because he had poor control. As soon as he had better control though, he became one of the best pitchers in the league). I dont think variety of pitches is that important. Many pitchers can just get by throwing 2 or 3 pitches if they are dominant pitches.|`|b86aaaf70d69573124d83a4eb9c25475aa	Control, control, control -- there's tons of minor leaguers out there with good to great stuff, but its useless without control, and many never make the jump because of their lack of control -- a large percentage of big league pitchers manage to have long successful careers with only average "stuff" because they are able to use it very effectively because of their great control|`|563dcde3f1b0f1e4cd701f41fdb90e20aa	Doesn't matter how hard you throw or how many pitches you have,if you can't throw strikes or locate,you'll end up in the single-a...Control is the main component of any pitcher.|`|AqHCVJ8waa	Control.  Power fades with age so you better have some control if you want a long career.  There are plenty of guys that can throw high 90s and couldnt get it over the plate for anything.  Guys like Maddux doesnt throw real hard but he can put it right where it needs to be every time.|`|cNBOAD5kaa	Control is first. If you can't throw strikes, you can't get hitters out. But more important than pure speed or a variety of pitches is movement on the baseball. Even a fastball has to have some sort of tail or cut. Throw a ball 99 mph that goes pefectly straight, and major league hitters will catch up to it.|`|fe4a19ec85e56892a90b5ad3caae47aaaa	Control.  Without control, a pitcher is liable to walk 10 batters a game, regardles of what velocity they have or how many different breaking balls they have.  Also, for longevity, control stays with a pitcher longest.|`|gRKSqwmtaa	Probably lots of good pitches, though I would go with control and variety (Greg Maddux style). Control alone gives you Carlos Silva.
WUuO6wbAaa	Why do you believe this? Well, for one, third time is the charm, isn't it? Since 2006, the NL caught up to them, but the Mets have made gradual improvements to their roster since than. The problem was they were too old and prone to injury, but now Alou, Pedro, El Duque and Wagner are gone. They've signed a 27 year old great closer, got a great closer, for not much, in a trade as their set-up man, and re-signed a 27 year old left-handed pitcher who had an 0.35 ERA in 26 innings against the Phillies last season, who extra exposed themselves to both Johan and Ollie with the signing of left-handed hitting Ibanez (who got nearly double the pay of Burrell and is 4 1/2 years older). Look at it this way. How long has it been since an NL team has even been to the World Series back-to-back seasons? Since '95-96. Look at what happened to the Cardinals in '07, following their title, or the Marlins in '04. Or just look at the pennant winners, the Rockies in '07 and Astros in '05. Have any of those teams been back in the postseason since? It's got something to do with hunger, so who's to say the Phillies will remain at the top? If Lidge gets hurt, or their offense remains as inconsistent, or predictably Myers falls apart, or Moyer's age catches up to him, it may not be as hard for the Mets.<br>  <br>  The Mets blew 29 saves last season, even while winning 89 games, ending up 3 games back of the World Champs. They blew a 6-2 lead in the 9th inning to the Phillies, on a start when Johan went 8 IP, and another one when they were up 7-0 in the 5th inning. Had the Mets sealed those two easy wins, they would have won the division by a game and the Phillies would have tied for the Wild Card. If the Mets receive the same production from their offense (3rd in NL), rank among the highest in quality starts, maintain good defense and a good bench, why would you believe this team couldn't do it? It was a miracle the Mets got to 89 games, with Stokes and Ayala as their 8th and 9th inning guys in the last 1 1/2 months of last season. It was embarrassing, to say the least.<br>  <br>  Talent wise they're there. The question isn't whether they'll be competitive. Is it do they have enough to win a World Series. That hinges on the improvement of Castillo, Feliciano and Sanchez, the adaption to the NL for K-Rod, Putz and Green, the dominance of Santana, emergence of Pelfrey, consistency of Perez, health of Maine and reliability of Murphy and Tatis. If they have most of that come together, there's no reason to believe why they can't win it all. The extra little motivation Hamels and Rollins give the Mets shouldn't hurt either, just like Reyes and Beltran did for the Phillies last season.<br>  You could refer back to this post months later, in October, when the Mets are in the postseason, and the Phillies aren't. It's really not hard to see at all. Two names will be the reason. K-Rod & Putz. When you put two stars in their prime together, great things can happen. Wagner's progressing well too, and may be back in August, so the thought of that is fierce for the postseason.|`|mml9J88caa	i think that they resolved their problem by adding some new key players. idk though. we just have to wait and see what happens. <br>  <br>  and honestly i think you should give best answer to the guy  above me. he deserves it hahaahah|`|yk4S7uuraa	I doubt it, not this time around.  Their biggest problem has been rectified with K-Rod and JJ Putz.|`|tA5DrAPpaa	I don't think so.<br>  <br>  They have two lights out closers, so those twenty some blown saves won't be a problem.|`|nSSKixvCaa	No. I actually don't think they chocked in 2007 and 2008 season. They just were not good enough. I think they were actually over-achieved with their weak pen and some question marks in the rotation. Phillies was the team underachieve to their potential considering Cole Hamels did not really win more than 15 games in both years and their no.2 guy in Myers or Moyer always has some up and downs. <br>  <br>  This year, Mets is complete and much better than before. Even better than 2006 Mets. They will not choke again.|`|u0VrCEVxaa	hahahaha two lights out closers? funniest thing ive ever heard. the mariners are my second favorite team behind the mets and trust me, putz is one of the worst closers out there. im talking as bad as armando benitez was for the giants a couple years back. if they send him down to the minors, then they might not choke this year.|`|Ty4Hdm2Haa	Nobody can really know the answer to that, so I guess I will have to shake the magic eightball..........hmmm.....the magic eightball reads "all signs point to yes".|`|NP6ytPfxaa	i hope not...coming from a rangers fan...mets are my 2nd team and i hope they dont.|`|fQIxah8laa	I hope not.

jjjgcuduaa	That's a tough one, real tough one.. I would give the nod to Dirk, he lead his team to the Finals, won the MVP. Det had a team with Payton, Kemp, Perkins, etc. Nowitzki in my opinion is the better ball handler, better all-around shooter(Det is a better 3pt shooter only). Det was a better defender though. I would give the nod to Dirk, he's just a better all-around player and is a guy to build your franchise around, while Det was a great long range shooter, he's not the guy to build your franchise around, althoguh he can shoot the 3 and defender better than Dirk.|`|7H9gHQA8aa	they are both good but dirk is better there offence is kind of neck to neck its hard to say whos offence is better but detlef shrempf<br>  averaged so many 3 pointers in his carreer and averaged alot<br>  of feild goals dirk could drive to the basket better than him and dirks<br>  defence is better i say dirk is better detlef is only a 3 time allstar while dirk is a 8 time allstar dirk also has much more awards than detfel shrempf|`|D6Llh23Baa	offensively, they are about the same. only dirk is better than schrempf was at driving the ball to the hoop.<br>  defensively, dirk is better. no way was schrempf a better defender. pippen completely kicked his butt during the championship. dirk is a better defender.<br>  the testament to this is the mvp award dirk received. and the best record of that season (forget the fact that they lost in the first round against the warriors). and a forgettable run to the championship against miami.
RuJYupFWaa	It's been covered pretty well already but yeah, it can be filled up to 4500 psi but many places don't have the capacity to do so.  The fields & stores will specify, though.  My local field used to only be able to fill up to 3000 psi but recently got a "stronger" air compressor.<br>  <br>  Even if the field does have a compressor able to fill up to 4500, it doesn't mean it always will.  If a ton of people are getting fills, they all won't be filled to max because the compressor does need time to compress air.|`|9zyJTQxuaa	Yeah, or when you go to certain fields just hand them your gun and say 45 or what ever you want it filled too, most of the time i say like 35 and i can shoot 2 and half cases with that for practice with my ego. but where i practice there is self serve air, that means you fill your own air and fill as much or as little as you want, as long as you don't exceed the limit.|`|1Ilr0svZaa	na i got a 4500 and it can be filled at 45 but at fields the usually fill it to 4000 or 3500. if you get it filled at the stores they sometimes fill to the 45 mark

bcc280d14bd6be1dabb59424542af666aa	All of the above.  Inexperience catching up to them, Sub par coaching by Roy and definitely teams giving them their A game.  Also, it doesn't help that Ty Lawson has an ego problem.  May have some internal dissension going on.  Rumor has it he isn't going to class and is already counting on NBA bucks so Roy didn't start him against Ga Tech???  That's the last thing they need going into the tourney.|`|55kboJCQaa	Well, who do you think teams get up for?  Southern SW Wisconsin or Carolina? Of course the Heels are gonna get almost every bodies "A" game. Not to say they haven't looked weak of late, seems tome there is alot of blame to go around, poor shot selection, poor defense, lackadaisical play and inexperience. I do think they'll do fine in the tourney though, awhile ago they were a shoo in for a top seed, now... maybe a 3 is the best they can hope for, either way, they'll be a handful for any opponent on a neutral court, they have way too much talent and potential to overlook.|`|znDuAYQqaa	Dude you tell me. But honestly this year they've been out of it they are horrible on defense and on offense it takes them like 5 minutes to score but i honestly think Roy Williams is screwing up a lot on coaching  and that Rayshaun Terri has anger management problems.|`|n7W454bCaa	They play in the ACC.

This is, obviously, an extremely talented team and one that is capable of winning it all, but more an more it also seems that they aren't the kind of team that can string together 6 quality performances come tourney time. Maybe all that youth is catching up to them. Maybe they're a year away from being able to put it all together with consistency.

9590bf84d0436b263c78612dbd67f0d4aa	Jusqu'à hier je voyais le PSG se maintenir mais bon là ?a deviens désespérant quoi ! On se demande comment cette équipe a pu figurer parmi les meilleurs défenses de L1 pendant de long mois. Si écart Yépes du groupe fut une erreur, aujourd'hui c'est peut-être l'aligner sur le terrain qui en est une. Et avec Landreau les attaquants n'ont même plus besoin de nettoyer la lucarne, il suffit juste de ne pas tirer droit sur le gardien pour que ?a rentre.

He has alot of raw talent and great ability to be a top contendor<br>  <br>  3. Middleweight: Anderson Silva. He gives the fans what they payed to see and always performs.<br>  <br>  4. Light Heavyweight: Chuck Liddell. The most dominant Light heavyweight whwn he was in his prime.<br>  <br>  5. Heavyweight: Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira: He is the best submission heavyweight in the world, he a great role model and a great trainer|`|K1Nnzq3Jaa	I have a couple<br>  <br>  1.

Fedor Emelianenko - Considered to be the best MMA fighter in the world today. He has yet to be stopped except for that accidental cut , but he would have won the fight anyway.<br>  <br>  3. Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira - Probably MMA's best submissionist. I became more of a fan after seeing how humble he was during The Ultimate Fighter 8<br>  <br>  4. Frank Mir - He has been underestimated many times.

FjQiHZjmaa	I'm sure you are doing the normal practices.  throw a couple of morning runs(2-3 a week) in there to add a little bit of mileage.  When I was improving I was running about 2-4 miles for morning runs.  Eat healthy and a healthy amount.  Meaning not like an elephant but enough to fuel your running.  You should be doing at least one long run a week and 1-2 speed sessions per week along with the racing.  I was running 45-60 miles per week at my peak.  |`|TriIrwZYaa	I think you should train extra long distances then just long distances the day after, then back to the extra long distances etc. But if you do this you must take the day before off and just relax and eat something like pasta for lunch/dinner.<br>  In training make sure you gain a good/better stamina for the race and do some hills also.<br>  Drink energy drinks (I recommend Lucozade Sport) and prepare mentally if you are serious about it (visualising doing well/winning). Good Luck|`|776e7689d5ffde981faa44ff3425c56eaa	Don't listen to anybody else. Ive been a runner for 6 years. I would to begin at your training. Make sure your run hard on your intervals and hill workouts. Those are the days you are suppose to do it but for a long run you dont goes as fast as you would on a hard day. Easy days are the recovery runs and a premeet run which is next friday. Easy runs are for your body to recover and premeet run is kinda saving your energy because you will get a running high ( its basically running fatser than usual becasue you are going easier the day before and have more energy the next day). Basically go easy on your easy days and go hard on the hard workouts. Next sleep, you should get 7 to 9 hours of sleep this week (even though you should be doin it already). DONT SLLEP MORE THE NIGHT BEFORE BECAUSE IT MESSES YOUR WHOLE DAY. Because your body isnt use to it. Your eating should carbs. For example whole grains, pasta, veggies, bread, bagels and fruit. You should start eating through out the day to keep your metabolism up. Have nutrigrain bar  when you start to feel a little hungry but dont over do it cause a lot of fiber in short period of time can cause uncomfrontable gas. make sure you drink water!!!!!!! VERY IMPORTANT. if not you can get painful cramps around the lower back stomach lower and upper. one way to check is by checking the color of youe urine. IF IT IS YELLOW THAT MEANS YOU NEED MORE WATER AND IF IT IS CLEAR THEN YOUR ARE GOOD. Lastly see yourself running on the course. THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT. dont do it the night beofre have it in your mind all this week. HAVE A GREAT ATTITUDE AND RUN WITH PEOPLE THAT YOU CAN RUN WITH. good luck and tell me how it goes1111 |`|TXdbTQeqaa	As bad as it may sound you should run everyday for 4 miles and this will place ahead of the game ( since most races are 3 miles) you will improve cardio and respiration and will build leg muscle along the way for good endurance and a faster you. Hope that helps. Btw it is said if you do something 30 days straight it becomes habit, so force yourself to run for like a month and then you will just naturally at a certain time go out for a run.|`|NT2Gld56aa	Have you ran with ankle weights?  Not only will this make your calf muscles stronger, but it will also give you a lighter feeling when running without them.  Try running with them on for 3 days straight, then try running without them and see how you feel.  If you notice a difference then, you will notice a substantial difference after a week.
AA10424441	I think you have to approach this question from two perspectives.<br>  <br>  You can't compare them on their performance in a game because Owens still has great ability and Marbury doesn't. A basketball player has more opportunity to turn his team into a loser because he can screw up the game by taking too many bad shots, slacking on defense and playing for his stats instead of the good of the team. A WR in football can't control the pace of the game unless the QB let's him.<br>  <br>  In terms of team harmony, the potential is there but NFL coaches take far less crap from their players than NBA coaches.<br>  <br>  |`|OG4WF1PJaa	Marbury?  Who cares? Owens is a very solid, perhaps great player who alienates the team with which he plays, and who, therefore has a corrosive effect, which is why no team he has ever played for has won a championship.   He talks too much, and has no concept of "team", and is not afraid of proving that. Lately, he has taken on a bogus religious aspect, which I find revolting.   But that's o.k.   He does what he wants to do, makes gobs of money, and that's as far as most people analyze anything.|`|cDtb15eaaa	TO is a crybaby "I don't get the ball enuf whaaaa" dude you get it thrown to you twenty times a game shut up and catch the ball instead of dropping it|`|7iELSgTuaa	He's starting to be, but T.O. is actually a Pro Bowl player where Marbury thought he was but really wasn't.

b2qV9K5Gaa	70 to win of 25overs equates to under 3runs per over..<br>  I would play risk free cricket for 15overs with the aim of getting 30runs through boundaries, running 2 or taking a single towards the end of the over.

Giving a tailender strike at the end of the over can be tricky as run outs may occur or the shot could go for 4 and resulting in the number 11 taking strike|`|QJlPNgZBaa	you have to keep the faith in your partner. it's a lot of runs. you cann't do it all by yourself. play normally  for 3,4 overs taking about 3 to 4 runs in a over , constantly advising the 11th man making him bit more comfortable. <br>  <br>  you cann't expect him to stay calm for ages so, when he is ready to rotate the strike get the powerplay and score 35,40 runs.<br>  then take the momentum to next overs and when there is about 25 runs to get after the powerplay he will bat bit more responsibily .<br>  <br>  rotate the strike bat sensibly there is stll plenty of time left.|`|1uLfl0sXaa	The priority would be to keep Martin away from the bowlers; at the most he'd face 1 or 2 balls per over.<br>  Secondly, try to hit as many 4s and 2s as possible.<br>  Hang in there till 45th over even if many runs are not coming.<br>  Go all out after the 47th over.<br>  In between all these, pray fervently and offer to light 70 candles if we win.|`|Ezk53Ifmaa	Only score 2 or 4.

The NFL does allow tinted visors for medical reasons.<br>  <br>  Unless your state has a waiver from the rule (none do to my knowledge) or you are in the NFL, then you cannot wear a tinted visor for a game.<br>  <br>  If your eyes are really sensitive, you are allowed to wear tinted contacts, tinted goggles, or sunglasses.|`|AA12170560	Tinted visors are quickly becoming a thing of the pass.<br>  <br>  Though learned contributors here say None - no where in high school or college...you may still see you tube highlights where athletes wear them.<br>  <br>  I would say, check with your coach concerning YOUR leagues ruling.<br>  <br>  In our league - clear visors ONLY. 4 years ago, a doctors note of sensitive eyes in the sunlight was fine.<br>  <br>  Last year, you needed a doctors note recommending a clear visor. <br>  <br>  This year the ruling is ...you must have sustained an eye injury - period...otherwise...no visors.<br>  <br>  So the rulings change often...check with your coach.|`|Gva0qq3Yaa	Rob is all over this one.

AA11570394	Reloading manuals generally don’t cover much more than load data. You need to learn the principles of reloading, safety and a few other things as well. There is a very good book called the ABC’s of Reloading;<br>  <a href="http://www.midwayusa.com/eproductpage.exe/showproduct?saleitemid=837228" rel="nofollow">http://www.midwayusa.com/eproductpage.ex...</a><br>  This book breaks it down and explains pressures, safety, how to select components and lots of other things you will need to know.<br>  You can get load data manuals from powder companies for free by ordering them online.<br>  Midway, which I gave the link to also have videos and a lot more books on reloading, check the reviews before you buy.<br>  <br>  Understanding what goes into a empty brass or shotshell is just part of reloading, understanding the why helps a great deal.<br>  <br>  There are high dollar reloading equipment but less expensive equipment can do the same job. Lee Reloading gear works well and lasts for years.<br>  Here are some free LEE reloading videos from their site;<br>  <a href="http://www.leeprecision.com/html/HelpVideos/video.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.leeprecision.com/html/HelpVid...</a><br>  <br>  If money is not an issue, Dillon, RCBS, MEC Hornady and Layman offer some of the high end stuff. I set one of my sons up last year with all he needed to reload shotgun, pistol and rifle for the guns he has from LEE and it was under $500 for everything, that’s less than some progressive presses by other companies.|`|KDOIKIq2aa	My advise is to go here: <a href="http://www.nrahq.org/education/training/find.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.nrahq.org/education/training/...</a><br>  <br>  Find a NRA reloading instructor near you and take a class.  Other than that you can start with a reloading manual read it front to back a few times and then ask around and find someone who will show them the ropes.  My local Sportsman's Warehouse put on a reloading class, so you might try a place that sells reloading equipment and ask about a class.|`|UwsbuHZYaa	There are alot of great sites on the web.<br>  Try<br>  <a href="http://stevespages.com/page8.htm" rel="nofollow">http://stevespages.com/page8.htm</a><br>  and <br>  www.thehighroad.org<br>  Don't be afraid to ask questions everyone would be happy to help you.<br>  Best way is get your press,scale,case trimmer,primers,powder bullets and brass and get to it. Always follow use a reloading manual and never load more powder than recommended.<br>  It might start out slow for you but you will get better and faster as time goes on. Always remember precision and patience.|`|5VELZt7Saa	just do it...Lee dies come with all the instructions,thats how i learned.|`|TeNIStN1aa	Reloading ammo isn't that difficult at all. Just get a good reloading manual and proper reloading equipments. As long as you can read and follow instructions and don't skip steps, you should do fine.<br>  <br>  If you can use a pencil sharpener you can use a case trimmer. Most people should know how to use a scale properly (unless you slept off in your high school chemistry classes). Even if don't know how to use a scale, you should be able to learn how to use one just by reading instructional manuals. You don't need anyone to teach you how to pull the handles of slot machines right? So, you shouldn't have any problem using a reloading press. If you can use a ruler, then you shouldn't have any problems using calipers. I am sure you know how screws work and don't have any problem turning them. Most importantly, you are reading responses from this post which demonstrated that you have the ability to read. If you can do all of the above, you can reload your own ammo. Just don't make up things yourself or experiment on items not listed on the reloading manual and you will not have problems.|`|vSuWyrFTaa	Chris, I have several reloading tables set up in my shop for my personal use. Over the years I've had some clients ask for help in getting started with their own reloading. I'd have them bring in their own powder, brass, primers, bullets, ect and we'd go through the steps of reloading and I use either the Hornandy or Speer books to show them a reference for their home setup. At some of the local ranges I visit there are bulletin boards that people will post a card or note too asking for reloading help or others selling some equipment. <br>  <br>   I'd suggest if you want to get some hands on to check with a local gun shop or two and ask for some hands on time or post a memo at a local range and ask for some OJT or pointers. <br>  <br>   One other thing you can do, if you start to reload and get to a point where you have a question or don't quite get the step your on, stop; you can call the folks at RCBS, Speer, and Nosler and they can help answer questions for you. <br>  <br>   Just a couple of ideas for you, good luck and good shooting.|`|1jdRPGMyaa	When I'm wondering how to do something, First I usually just check youtube. It's free, theres probably many tutorials, and it helps that theyre videos. If i were you, id check youtube, and if you cant find any tutorials that are informative enough just get a manual or get into a the local NRA club near you. Heck I bet a guy at the shooting range could help you also.|`|Ta5z3gsVaa	All the advice is true. Also go to the RCBS website - they have some nice videos that might help and give you an idea as to whats involved. Just don't to overwelmed at first. Some of the advanced procedures aren't necessary until you really get into it. Remember take your time until you get the hang of it and be safe.|`|dfBwVxXFaa	get a good reloading book, and follow all directions exactly. The press will come with directions, just make sure you pay attention to details. You will also need a good scale and case trimmer.|`|Y4RS35M7aa	I recommend that you start with the purchase of "Hornady's Reloading Guide."  Not only does it have detailed, accurate directions for reloading, it also has a little article for each caliber giving history and development of it.  Not only that, but Vol II is a complete Ballistic table with bullet drops, energy and velocity readings for all the popular bullet configurations and weights.
5jIdcbyYaa	The problem is... too much editing for WWE to do since the name changed. They probably would, but i think they find it too much to do. The word "WWF" is said too much on their shows during the old days so that's gonna be hard to replace. Also some of their theme songs aren't owned by them so they would have to change that too and replace it to their new songs and they would have to find current announcers to do the announcing for their matches. Sometimes Jim Cornette did RAW too so yeah ... Slim chance for it to have a replay. WWE only edits the memorable moments on their dvds and WWE 24/7.|`|Iqtoxb5laa	eh..they do , in australia , on fox8 on the weekends they have WWE vintage, Alot of the old shows and matches<br>  <br>  My fave was when HHH and Stone Cold were going to bash Lita.

I would watch it, though.|`|RpsbIXDsaa	um to that legacy dude, orton punting foley isnt really considered the old days just yet son, maybe past 2010 or 20 is old days but not something that was done 3-4 years ago|`|a5hNA3Kxaa	If Vince does not see it as good for the business then it wont happen, and it I do think it would be cool but bad for the buisness. They need everyweek for build up and storyline so that the people will order the ppv.

With the economy down, ticket sales and attendance are down, revenues from sales of licenced merchandise are down.  Ratings are down, so TV revenues are down a bit.

Zh3Qe8Weaa	I say keep Kirk you never know if Derrick Rose doesn't turn out to be as good as they say he is. But if does turn out to be a star of the draft then keep Kirk. Rose being a rookie a won't hve exp. in a faster pace NBA game, and wouldn't play th full 48 minutes. I would say he would play at the max 35 min. Kirk can play the rest. Kirk would be a excellent backup PG to Rose. But if Rose doesn't live up to the hype then Kirk would be useful. Rose would be the backup PG. I would trde the other PG and just keep Kirk, thats all you need.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped, peace|`|0E8SPyyXaa	no they shouldnt they got to many gaurds|`|eUK4k20maa	I think we should keep him. He is the best defender on the team. If we sign Deng and not sign Gordon that frees up a point guard spot.<br>  The following is what i see in our point guards,<br>  <br>  Thabo- keep- excellent potential<br>  Rose- no brainer<br>  Kirk- keep- best defender- one not so good year<br>  Duhon- good player but we could give him up.<br>  <br>  Overall i see us keeping Kirk, and getting rid of Duhon/Gordon.<br>  <br>  And i hope we do keep Kirk.|`|8650211c24872ffb9fb51fe9f390d6ccaa	NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...

Sunlight will make them brittle as well.  <br>  <br>  If they are in good shape otherwise, try repairing them with a product called " Shoe Goo".  It comes in a tube and is like rubber cement.  It won't last forever but you will get some more mileage out of them.  It's much cheaper than buying new boots.  <br>  <br>  I bought a pair three years ago at a store called Payless Shoe Source and the brand is called "State Street".  I only paid 25$ for them but they have been great.  This is the third year I've put them through hell, they are still holding up and are very comfortable.  I would recommend this brand to anyone.  I've had expensive boots in the past, but these cheap ones have lasted longer and I like them better.  I have had good luck with boots made by Columbia as well but they cost way more.|`|mMFJrPbvaa	What brand of boots do you have?  Are they name brands from a reputable store or are they just a cheap brand from some store?  If they are in fairly good shape overall and were bought from a good store you should be able to return them if there is a defect. They would probably laugh at you if they boot is 5 years old and worn out<br>  Steel or fiberglass would just add tremendous weight to the boot, if the rubber was going to split it would do so up to your "shank"

I don't remember the model # off the top of my head, but you can probably find it on their website.|`|Z8UV6S3baa	So, the primary purpose of the Mosquito was to give people who really liked the SIG platform - the 226 is the reference platform for the Mosquito I think - a .22 caliber trainer, as opposed to providing a conversion kit for people who already had centerfire guns.<br>  <br>  I have shot a range version and honestly didn't like it much. What I can put up with for trigger weight and such in a centerfire 226 is not what I want to put up with in a .22. If I were spending that kind of money, and was dead set on a DA/SA .22LR pistol, I would probably look at something like a CZ75 Kadet. This literally is a CZ75 chambered in .22LR. All steel so recoil is absolutely nothing, and, in my opinion, a nicer trigger than you get in the SIG. The Kadet is not as well known or gets quite the splash that the Mosquito gets, but it is accurate, reliable and built on a platform that has been successful for a good 30 years.<br>  <br>  Thinkingblade|`|AEzJHIz7aa	The mosquito is a real gamble.  About half of them work perfectly.  And about half don't work for beans.  Sig has been real quiet on the matter, and if you have a bad one, they'll do unhelpful things like send you new springs.<br>  <br>  Check out the Sig forums... you'll see people have a real love/hate relationship with the gun, depending on whether theirs works or not.<br>  <br>  I actually know 3 people with Mosquitos.  One works just fine with any high velocity ammo.  One will only shoot CCI Mini Mags.  And one won't shoot anything reliable, high or standard velocity.  A real microcosm of the larger world's experiences!<br>  <br>  Pass on the mosquito.
vpG7h5wBaa	Well for etnies, I know a 6 youth is actually bigger than an adult- a 6 youth in etnies is like an etnies adult 8.  So if that is the same for Nike, he may need a size 6 surprisingly.  Maybe there is a sports store near you too, that has the shoes and you could try them on.  Anyway hope I helped!
AA10080161	As a Dodger fan, I have had moments of my life seriously disrupted by Barry Bonds.  However, I took steroid for five years for a lung problem and I did gain strength.  I did not gain extraordinary eyesight, patience to work a count. Steroids did not make me quick. The quickness needed to turn on a cuveball and hit it.  Pete Rose said that hitting a baseball is one of the most difficult task in all of sports.  You have a round ball rotating and moving in unusual ways, a round bat, and you have to hit it SQUARE.<br>  <br>  The government for a reason no one seems to understand has selected Barry Bonds, out of a hundred or more players to prosecute.  <br>  <br>  They have spent years and many millions of tax payer's monies to reach their goals of apparently hurting Mr. Bonds by a guilty verdict. One which he would most likely receive a suspended sentence or probation instead of the two year maximum  prison sentence.<br>  <br>  I don't see a guilty verdict of perjury being worth the cost or use of the many government agencies involved, including the IRS.  The courtrooms have been reserved for these cases and so could not be used for other crimes.  So why is the federal government so intent on going after Mr. Bonds?  <br>  <br>  I hate to lose.  I would not however spend many millions of your dollars to prevent me from being a loser.  Would you do this?  I don't think so.<br>  <br>  I am rooting for Barry because I don't want the government thinking they can do this to anyone.  As far as his records.  Time will take care of this.|`|KR1FdEZgaa	i hope he goes to prison, and they take his records away! i hope rodger c. goes too. when bonds first came up he had the toughest work out routine in mlb. after 15 years he slowed down his work outs and then at age 35 got bigger (not fat). he went from young and in his prime hitting about 30 hr per year and about 90 rbi. to old for mlb 35 plus and lots bigger, and hitting 50 hr per year, and 140 rbi. on avg. and he is an ***. i hope they both serve one year. and never get into the hall.|`|wJd0gNymaa	I Definately am. I live on the edge of the Bay Area and I been watching the for about 8 years and I've always been a fan of Barry Bonds. He has given me most of my most cherished baseball memories. I hope he does well.|`|AA12026689	The only people "rooting" for Bonds are Giant fans, only.  Every other baseball fan in America is hoping that he gets flushed down the drain where he belongs.|`|MjZ1Pvydaa	I hope he wins, I don't approve roids but I think he's been through enough all ready. Almost everyone hates him and he will never have respect in the game again. Thats more than enough.|`|OPSFSpRsaa	interesting question, but of course not|`|ghzhPhNDaa	yes.  i hope he wins.|`|5EuOTAjJaa	Of course we are. NOT.<br>  <br>  That would be like rooting for Adolf Hitler. <br>  <br>  Get real.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	No.  I can't.  I mean as a Dodger fan I spent so many seasons hating Bonds that I cant root for him.  Not to mention he's known as being one of the biggest @ssholes in all of sports.  He's the type of person who thinks he's better than you because of what he can do on a baseball field, which is why he's in this mess.  He probably thought because of who he is that he could lie and get away with it.|`|l3ZUVqB7aa	He might have the worst personality of all baseball players but he is the best dam baseball player I have ever seen. I hope he gets by this mess. Do I accept what he's done no, but he shouldnt be the only one blamed. What about Sosa, Big Mac, "Cough Arod cough"|`|XOtN0mzNaa	Nope.  Not me.|`|YCwmCDkUaa	F**K No !|`|Lpf6Eu3eaa	hell yeah!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Bonds = Greatest Hitter of All-Time!!!!!!!!!!

Unless you know the exact length needed, take the wheel to the shop.

For college football you can go to Yahoo Sports and sign up for college broadcast to listen to games.  Both cost.

I also took dancing for years beforehand, and I think it helped me in a way. <br>  <br>  When you try out, show what you are good at. If you keep a bright, smiling face, show tons of spirit, and look like there's nothing else in the world you'd rather be doing, you should be fine. For me, I was good at smiling, I obviously could dance, and I kept all my motions tight. I wasn't a great jumper by any means, but I gave it my best and the judges saw that. <br>  <br>  One thing too I kept having to work on is that because of dance, I was graceful in all of my movements. In cheerleading, everything is sharp and it pops. So also remember that. <br>  <br>  Good luck! I hope it helps!|`|8gNUS0Zkaa	You should definitly be one if you want too.<br>  Try doing some stretches each day.<br>  And each day, do something more difficult.<br>  You could also try and see if your school has Poms.<br>  There's more danceing involved.<br>  I guess it all depends what school you go too.<br>  My best of luck to you.|`|AA10334462	in middle school to make the squad you need to have your splits,carwheel and a roundoff but as a plus they would like you to do a walk over front or back doesnt matter. in high school you need a back handspring,cartwheel,roundoff,and a walk over.|`|yq2Xb5M0aa	Don't worry about not being to flexible, because when you join the team, you will be train to be flexible by your coach. So my advice to you is go for it.<br>  <br>  Best of luck in your cheerleading career.

1fac5a761af3a94ccdce3f25d3999768aa	Hi there<br>  <br>  Modern ninjutsu teaches armed and unarmed fighting techniques from 9 different schools (ryu ha). Each school is different in its approach. Some use fast direct striking skills called koppo jutsu whilst others use koshi jutsu techniques which are attacks to the muscles and skin done with a circular motion. You also have jutai jutsu and dakentai jutsu . Both use grappling techniques and some involve fighting in armour yoroi kumiuchi.<br>  <br>  You are taught lots of traditional kata then encouraged to henka them which means you apply your own interpretation and knowledge based around your own natural movement. Everyones taijutsu is different and is unique to the student. <br>  <br>  Here's a link that roughly lists most of the school kata we practice. Its missing some forms from togakure ryu mainly shinobi ukemi gata, shinobi gaeshi gata and the goton no jutsu. Shinobi iri is no longer taught.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mbdojo.com/ryukata.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mbdojo.com/ryukata.html</a><br>  <br>  There's also a medicine component called amatsu which is similar to shiatsu only its Japanese.<br>  <br>  The real benefits are lots of henka which enable you to think fast without having to resort to memory. We dont do forms for perfection we only extract the principles they teach. Forms restrict your ability to move in a natural way but they do teach principles that you need to understand.<br>  <br>  Its not a sport nor is it rigid and it takes ages to be able to get the hang of it but once you get it you start to move very differently. This art is based on freedom which most people struggle to grasp as a concept. You are not forced to eat kata because there is just too much.<br>  <br>  Taijutsu doesnt resemble TV ninjas or the bad commercial image  they reflect. Many people fail to get past this image because its so ingrained.<br>  <br>  If you are seeking instruction only train with a shidoshi who is 5th dan or greater, is registered in Japan and is part of the Bujinkan or Jinenkan. Forget the rest because they are either fake or they are not following the traditional ryu ha as taught by the soke.<br>  <br>  Hope this makes sense?<br>  <br>  Best wishes <br>  <br>  idai|`|e86f624ac7abafd2725c361b122b48f9aa	You get great nostalgic training, and get in shape.<br>  <br>  Ninjutsu is the martial art learned by the Shinobi (ninja), in feudal Japan, currently the Bujinkan dojo in Japan teaches a modernized version.<br>  <br>  Ninjas and Samurai have been extinct since feudal Japan.|`|5LpggPtMaa	I have wanted to learn this art since EARLY childhood.<br>  Ninjitsu pushes stealth, agility, and quick problem-solving.<br>  <br>  Practitioners posess climbing skills seen only in the greatest of rock climbers and free-runners, study a GRAND range of weapons, are great alchemists, and move/strike in silence.|`|Ltbdp2jzaa	If you can find a school (good one) ninjitsu would be extremely effective for developing strength, speed and agility. However, don't expect much in the way of self defense. Ninjitsu emphasizes surprise attacks and the use of weapons so don't count on it in a street fight.|`|XkucIzmgaa	Not coming from a Ninjutsu practicioner, but from what i see it gives you good instincts, probably makes you use to your environment, gives you a lot of balance in doing techniques, shows you a lot of tricky ways to control people without trying one bit, and most of all, it teaches you discipline just like any other art, and also history of the ninja :D.<br>  <br>  Peace!

He was named All Pro 8 times, led the league in receptions 8 times, in receiving TDs 9 times and yards 8 times.<br>  <br>  No WR since then has been named the MVP and Hutson did it twice. His records prevailed as long s as Rice records will.<br>  <br>  As a plus, the guy played defense and kicked field goals.|`|Jm9IedIDaa	Jerry Rice.<br>  <br>  Greatest is a function of both ability and results.

7e0c01587b445ba9702d403df3de0521aa	I am assuming you are talking about the AR15. <br>  <br>  In that case, no, it is not an issue. <br>  You won't get significantly less accuracy. <br>  <br>  Now, if I wanted to make a 500 yard shot, I would want 20 inch. But, most of the time 16 inch is plenty. The military uses 14.5 inch.<br>  <br>  The only thing you lose that matters is velocity... velocity causes fragmentation..... fragmentation is what makes the 5.56NATO one of the most deadly cartridges in the world. <br>  <br>  With 14-16 inch barrels, you get "only" about 150 yards of fragmentation range. With 18-20 inch barrels, you get about 280-300 yards of fragmentation range. That is the big issue. <br>  <br>  If you are working at 150 yards and less, 16 inch is great, lighter and more compact. <br>  <br>  Just remember your chromed 5.56NATO chamber, and 1/7 rifling twist. <br>  <br>  <br>  Ammo is a big player in accuracy. A good gun will shoot good ammo accurately, and poor ammo respectably. A poor rifle will shoot good ammo respectably, and poor ammo like lobbing rocks.|`|4mb6xaxBaa	yes, barrel legnth and rate of twist of rifling are just a few of the factors in accuracy! |`|mOTCr8Pxaa	If your talking a rifle generally not. The only thing that suffers from a shorter barrel is bullet velocity.|`|DkFoX4pHaa	Generally speaking:  short barrels of 2" to 3" are very accurate but the shorter Sight Radius magnifies your aiming error.  Longer barrels, to a point of diminishing returns, allows the powder gasses to burn more completely, resulting in greater velocity.  Therefore the trajectory arc is less from longer barrels which makes for less need to adjust the sights to compensate for mid-range differential.   A person who knows his gun can hit a man at 50 yards with a 2" barrel just as accurately as he can using a 6" barrel.   Take a course in concealed carry and the instructor will prove all this to you. |`|AA12243350	yes and no, in a handgun, it is the shorter sight radius tha causes more of the inaccuracy issue, not the shorter barrel itself.<br>   In a rifle, you as a hunter will never be able to tell the difference in accuracy between a 16 or 20" barrel fired from a solid rest, However, there is also a loss of velocity between the shorter and longer barrel because in the longer barrel the powder has more time to fully burn and develop it's full energy potential. therefore, at longer distances, you will see more bullet drop from the shorter barreled firearm.<br>  Yes, some firearms like certain types of ammo more than others, and will show a better group with certain types. That is why, if shoooting commercial ammo, you should try several different manufacturers and bullet weights to get the best performance out of your firearm.<br>  Hope this helped<br>  shoot safe|`|XTNbccaJaa	Yes barrel length affects accuracy, hence a .38 snubnose is less accurate than a long rifle.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	That only applies to handguns, but not rifles.*|`|uQQiS2yIaa	The most accurate rifles in the world have 26" barrels... any longer and you loose accuracy, any shorter and you loose accuracy.  There are reasons for this length... <br>  <br>  As most bullets accelerate down the barrel, they create harmonics causing the barrel to 'whip' slightly which can effectively 'throw off' the accuracy with continued firing.  Out to about 26" most ammunition is reaching it's peak velocity and will exit the barrel at it's maximum obtainable velocity.  After 26" it is beginning to feel the effects of deceleration and friction and will actually loose velocity before exiting the barrel.<br>  <br>  The problem with a long barrel though is that it heats up faster and therefore needs a way of cooling.  Some barrel makers use 'fluting' as a way to 1). reduce weight while strengthening the barrel and 2). create a channel to allow for cooling.  This technique however has pitfalls and, if the grooves are not properly machined, can put stress on the metallurgy and reduce the quality of the finished product.  A better way to provide for cooling is to bead the barrel (glass bead).<br>  <br>  The reason shorter barrels are used is for CQB considerations (urban fighting).<br>  <br>  Bullet design does play a part in accuracy (Black Hills is by far the most accurate ammunition made but you will pay the price for that and it is exclusively purchased for military snipers).  Bullet weight is very critical for accuracy (it plays into the length and dynamics of the trajectory) so that is why you can find 150 gr and 180 gr but also 174 gr ballistic tip Match grade for .308 cartridges.  These are the ones used to 'reach out' just a little bit further.|`|69a47001c8449771a6964bf1c2360497aa	In modern firearms accuracy is not improved by a longer barrel.  A firearm with a longer barrel may be easier for some shooters to shoot accurately but modern firearms are as accurate as the shooter.  Put another way, there is no firearm that is sooo accurate that it will make a distinguished expert out of a lousy shot.  <br>  <br>  What a longer barrel will do is:  Allow the bullet to more fully burn all its powder resulting in less of a muzzle blast and flash.  Less muzzle blast and flash may keep some shooters from flinching thus giving the illusion that a longer barrel is more accurate.  A longer barrel will also increase a bullet's velocity & range somewhat.  Because a longer barrel will allow a shooter to hit a target at a longer distance may also create the illusion that it is more accurate.<br>  <br>  All modern firearms that are not in some way defective are as accurate as the shooter.  Some are easier to shoot accurately, that's all.<br>  <br>  ADDENDUM:  And yes, when it comes to accuracy ammo selection is even more important than barrel length.<br>  <br>  H|`|HbERbDlWaa	Absolutely. Longer barrels are more accurate, as are thicker barrels, known as bull-barrels or target barrels. The trade off is weight. Longer thicker barrels tend to be heavier. They feel like they weigh more than they actually do because the weight is far away from your body, so you're not able to support it as easily if your not shooting from a bipod or a rest.<br>  <br>  Every factor in your shooting combination affects the accuracy to some degree. The scopes/sights, trigger, ammo, barrel, how you hold the rifle, how you pull the trigger, and how your stock is attached all influence accuracy.<br>  <br>  Remeber that accuracy is the art of making your firearm more consistant. Consistancy is key. Shooting the same way, pulling the trigger the same speed every time, using the same good quality ammo every time, and cleaning your firearm the same way will all help you get better accuracy.<br>  <br>  If you want great accuracy from any gun, and you have the money, take it to a gunsmith. They can make modifications to your firearm such as re-bedding the stock, installing a Timney or Jewell Trigger, helping you install a quality scope ect or getting a better barrel installed. You can have them do crazier work too, such as welding the scope mounts to the action (a gunsmith in the US named patrick holehan pioneered this several years ago) or lightening the firing pin/mechanism to speed up the lock time. (reduces the innaccruacy from your aiming)<br>  <br>  I notice that your screen name is .308..... To get the most out of a .308, or any high power cartrige, you're looking at a 24 inch barrel at the max. 22 inch will not be much less accurate, and much easier to carry and aim. It and 20 inch tend to be the norm. If you're shooting rimfire, (.22's or .17's) a 16 inch barrel won't make a big difference as the bulk of rimfire ammunition isn't very accurate by comparison.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|KkjwdHahaa	with rifles, shorter barrels are actually more accurate because once you get to a certain point (about 16") any extra barrel length after that starts to effect the bullet's movement, sort of interupts the harmonics so to speak, and will yeild less consistant accuracy..|`|1VN1elhBaa	I thought it was both. And the type of weapon you're using.
AA11599219	I believe our college x-c coach likes to do training without aqua joggers so thre is less artificial aid.  However, when it comes to rehab, it may not be good to place that much stress immediatley on the injury so an aqua jogger would offer a good way to ease into it.<br>  <br>  Have you talked to your physical theapist about this?
NCE3BL0Aaa	I'd go with out for a better workout.
p0e0mQ0laa	I'm a freshman and I run 6:15, so yeah your time is very good.|`|7214c656b98a7065cd3fcd7c6f3e5659aa	ok, don't laugh, but i'm also a 14 year old freshman, and i run a 9:36. i'm in cross country even though i suck at running, but it's still loads of fun!<br>  your mile time is pretty darn good. that's about the speed of the fastest guys in my grade.|`|AA10881388	I'm a soph. now but last season I ran a 4:55 a couple meets into the year, even though my coach stopped me from running it after that race.<br>  <br>  A 5:45 going into high school is pretty good. Depending on how <br>  serious you and your team are, you could easily get to 5:15 by spring track. Seriously consider doing Winter Track. If you live anywhere cold, it sucks running in the cold and wind, but it REALLY helps come spring time. Good Luck!|`|3sqM90EWaa	As a freshman I was 14 going in and at the end of CC season I did a 5:25 mile. At the end of track season I had a PR of 5:08. That was also after a dismal half season of CC(I was also in marching band). Now my PR is a 4:38.<br>  <br>  You can get it down, just keep up your running and your times will go down.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|c481d6a4ef704039aa0657efd6feed42aa	Wow that was exactly where I was my freshman year. Entered HS with about a 5:50ish mile. Finished track season with a 5:06. Hard work, staying focused, and maybe even a little luck and you'll see that it will all pay off in the end. I was probably 14 at the time too. I say that you could definitely get it down to a very low or MAYBE sub-five minute mile. Good luck!!!|`|9IsJNlBsaa	your time is not bad at all, i was 14 as a freshman and ran the mile in 5:26, you can get your time down to 5:10 if you work hard enough|`|dOpjlZQJaa	Freshman- 5:38<br>  Sophomore- 4:55<br>  This Year- ???????<br>  <br>  The key is to be dedicated. Run cross country to set your base and then train specifically for the mile when track starts. Don't settle for mediocre because track involves TOO much work to not take seriously. |`|gp5MWVyIaa	im on the XC team and i can run a 16 minute race my first miles are usually under 5 and progressively get longer but not by oo much...a mile straight out i would say 4:15|`|6e30e134d2d72a11ddaa2b3b52eca9b4aa	Most recent freshman time (female): 8:15<br>  <br>  I'm getting better though!!|`|4cc28qsSaa	5:30.

mqgS6Dfxaa	There are 2 different kind of "mistake" cards.<br>  <br>  The first is an error card which every card has the same mistake.  Sometimes these mistakes get corrected and sometimes they don't.  When the card gets corrected it then becomes a variation or a corrected error.  Some variations are worth more than others.  One of the most valuable variations is from the T206 set where Sherry Magee's name was misspelled in the first printing as Magie.  There are approximately 150 examples known to exist.  A recent popular variation is the 1989 Billy Ripken Fleer card.  <br>  <br>  The second type of "mistake" is a printing error.  Different type of printing errors are too much of a color, not enough of a color, miscut cards, and wrong back cards.  Each sheet of cards are fed through the printer twice, once for the fronts and once for the backs.  Wrong back cards are created when the sheet is put in the 2nd printer backwards.  They are not all that uncommon.  Some people will consider them worthless while other people go out of their way to collect them.<br>  <br>  I think your card may be a variation rather than a wrong back card because there's one on ebay right now for $1.99.|`|AA10424441	Some error cards become very valuable and others do not. The factors that determine the price are the quantity of the error cards printed in relation to the corrected ones and the particular card itself. The particular player involved in the error card and the set it's from will be a factor.<br>  <br>  You can check a Beckett Price Guide and determine if the error is significant enough to be listed and then compare the price to the corrected version of the card to obtain your specific answer.|`|ywuzqyM0aa	i always wondered that myself becasuse i have a couple of those. none of the mistakes are that bad though its just like words and things are spelled wrong on most and what not|`|EBKu42wFaa	yeah

6HQHSYvDaa	I am fustrated that no big blockbuster trades were made, because everyone was talking about t-mac, carter, and amare getting trade but nothing happened.  The reason alston got traded is for 2 reasons: 1. so houston can free up some cap space for the future  2.  they believe aron brooks is their future point guard. they trust he can carry the team and that he is the future of the rockets pg position|`|sTyRRAeJaa	I am so glad the Tyson Chandler trade got rescinded.

7Ja03Geuaa	Its a great trade for the spurs but not for the nets.<br>  vince carter could probably win another ring for the spurs. <br>  Manu can carry a team but he has not been as effective this year.  It would benefit the spurs.|`|0fb4ce4da0f3875154ab271a088412fcaa	No, I hate the trade as a Spurs fan. Manu Ginobli is the best Small Guard right now on the Spurs and it would definitely ruin the "big three" and the chemistry of the team. Vince Carter is getting old, and he's going down in points and everything, the Spurs don't need another older player to play with. I would definitely hate that trade, and ruining a good team chemistry can result in a lot of loses. Vince Carter won't get the Spurs what Manu Ginobili does for the Spurs every night.|`|4JOG5qB1aa	Not for San Antonio.  There's no point.  Ginobili has better chemistry with the Spurs, and that's part of why they're so good.  Carter isn't really that much more of a skilled player than Manu, and I think Manu is a better competitor.  <br>  <br>  For the Nets, it's ok because they want to get rid of him, and Ginobili is ok value.|`|ISQAWUf2aa	Hard, actully its a fair trade.<br>  <br>  Why because they are both great and will help the team.|`|uoIV59V6aa	hell yea so VC can get a ring VC needs a ring before endin his career|`|rTbKXMMpaa	Not a chance. vince doesnt have the work ethic to suceed in the NBA. We've seen him throw down huge dunks but other than that, he's a troubled player. Manu on the other hand is an incredibly hard worker. He knows what it takes to win. I'd always pick him over Carter

Even in Tyson's prime he would be "mortal" after round 4 or 5. That's when Ali would have taken over and stopped Mike in 8 or 9. Not to mention Ali was hit by some of the hardest punchers in history and was never stopped. <br>  <br>  Here is a sample of Ali @ his absolute best......ENJOY|`|Ghiy6Cwlaa	ali ko in 5 he was way to good and and to fast for tyson|`|5fabd1dde8996146708da2f18d2feea8aa	Muhammad Ali.<br>  <br>  You may have heard the old saying, "A good boxer will [almost] always beat a good puncher."<br>  <br>  Ali was a very good boxer.  His handspeed would surely befuddle Tyson and his footspeed would keep him out of harm's way until Tyson ran out of gas, probably after five or six rounds.<br>  <br>  Tyson was not known for his stamina.  His style -- pure aggression -- takes a lot of energy.  He spent a lot of it going for a quick kayo.  That's one reason his "prime" didn't last very long.|`|qCYT5w0maa	That's tough queup2003, but I'm going to say Muhammad Ali. If you asked me years ago, I would have said Tyson. He was a super-hard puncher and lightning fast in his upper body.<br>  <br>  But, I believe Ali was just too smart. His defense was great. His footwork was great. He had a great chin. He would have figured Tyson out/his style and eventually broke him down.|`|qoYLjfxvaa	Ali. Superior chin, footwork, mobility, lateral quickness, hand speed, reach, ring intellects.|`|rPFJ3saYaa	Suprisngly I would take Tyson. he's punches are more brutal and he'll attack you more than Ali. Both are legends I shall say as well though.|`|439bb8e9dd46532d20f20e3ec0b9fa18aa	Ali, no question.
7kfCH85naa	It means you are tied for both wins and losses.(4-4), (6-6),(2-2).<br>  its also widely used in baseball, but .500 translated in percent is 50%,meaning you won(and lost) half of your games.|`|QH4a4mPFaa	That is probably referring to the teams record. It means they have won as many games as they have lost. ie: 4-4 record is .500.|`|LwcaweT3aa	i'm not sure but when you know-- tell me!|`|WiIUEObTaa	when a Team for example has played 8 games won four lost four. their winning percentage is rated om 1.000 percentage. won half off games lost half. equals 500 PERCENT WIN LOSS RATION.

HELL HES DOLPH FRKING ZIGGLER|`|JiCfYfLraa	i hope not he is a hottie and he knows how to wrestle the wwe is so quick to release somebody because they say the superstars are useless. maybe if they would stop focusing so much on the heavyweight and wwe title and focus on the talented superstars that are in the shadows of the wwe they can get somewhere. so many superstars need pushes and are very talented but the wwe is so quick to release somebody like how they wanna release shad.<br>  <br>  the wwe has some nerve to hire these talented superstars,let them wrestle only one match and then wanna release them a few weeks later. like what the hell give the superstars a chance. stop focusing on cena,triple h,randy orton,batista and all those other overrated superstars and give the gifted a chance.|`|fmUGHvgHaa	"Hey, My name is Dolph Ziggler"<br>  <br>  hell yeah 3:16|`|iOICjcZcaa	I don't think so. Right now, WWE just seems focused on Wrestlemania and getting everyone ready for that. Right now, you won't be seeing much new talent or mid/low card wrestlers unless they are participating in Wrestlemania or are building up someone who WILL be in Wrestlemania.<br>  <br>  He made a pretty impressive debut and even managed to get some heel heat.

AA11356623	first things first, the guy above me is totally, totally wrong. <br>  i tried out with 85 girls for 25 spots, and that was for an all-new team. <br>  i made it, so i hope i can help you.<br>  <br>  alright, ill do this in order.<br>  <br>  1. you could take dance, but its not really necessary, if you have any natural ability. i had five years of dance, but i quit 4 years before cheerleading. <br>  i recommend tumbling classes, if you do want to take a class.<br>  <br>  2.tryouts, for me anyway, had three parts. they taught you a cheer, a dance, and three jumps. you had to do the cheer and dance (in groups of three) and pick a jump to do. if you had any tumbling, you showed it. <br>  <br>  3. they judge you on precision, "tightness" (cheerleading term, you'll probably pick it up at tryouts), smile, loudness, and enthusiasm.<br>  <br>  4. most important tip: be confident. ever met an insecure cheerleader?<br>  also, and i know this sounds dumb, but you have to "look the part". the judges have to believe you'll be a good cheerleader. so be neat and put together, and look the best you can.<br>  <br>  5. most people forget to smile. its a huge mistake. i recommend vaseline on your teeth. it sounds gross, but it works. <br>  <br>  and the last one:<br>  probably the new high school. less people = less competition. <br>  <br>  best of luck!|`|XpscG1m1aa	just be confident. that's the asset they look at the most. it shouldn't be too hard to make the tea,m since it isn't the most competitive sport.|`|aaAqizMcaa	well u should probably take lessons in gymnastics and start running cause im a cheerleader and ur gonna get tired very often|`|ZptH0DUxaa	Dance might help you pick up the counts quicker, but one summer of dance isn't going to make that much of a difference.  If anything, take a tumbling class.  You can easily learn a back handspring and a roundoff back handspring over a summer.<br>  <br>  Tryouts usually consist of learning a cheer and/or dance (depending on how your school squad(s) are set up, and sometimes, you have to choreograph your own cheer and/or dance.<br>  <br>  Smile (vaseline on your gumline works wonders)!<br>  <br>  Be loud and crisp with your movements and your voice.<br>  <br>  Hit each individual move.<br>  <br>  Have a positive attitude at all times during the workouts. I cannot tell you how many times girls lose points because I notice attitude problems during the woorkouts for tryouts.<br>  <br>  Good luck! I hope you do well!

13096d1166a977e58810a6cdcc148f36aa	this is exactly why the rooney's, who for the most part, i agree with, should have sucked it up and kept alan faneca, one of the leagues most underrated o men.  the line has had it's problems dating back to cowhers days, and yet in the draft they continue to pick up WR, RB, d guys, but still neglect the o line.  it doesn't help that some of the starters have been injured, and granted the backups do a good job, it's just not the same.  ben does have a tendency to hold on to the ball too much, kinda like kordell did.  but both kordell and ben are great at either running if need be or holding out until just the last second in hopes a WR will get open and making a big play out of nothing.<br>  <br>  i think it's a combination of the o line and the o coordinator and ben himself.  but at least his 'calculated' season sacks won't match that of david carr's when he played for houston.  wasn't it like 63 or some sh*t he had his first year?  yikes!|`|VTN4Qun9aa	It's partially his offensive line, maybe a little bit his offensive coordinator, and it's mostly him.  He holds on to the ball for a LONG time.  I have to say that I think Roethlisberger's career will meet an early end due to his already excessive number of concussions.|`|vv0v03SHaa	The steelers don't have a dynamic passing attack and if they get behind big ben is in trouble but they are going to win this week<br>  <br>  here are some great football picks<br>  <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/1161793/jks_week_9_nfl_picks.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...</a>|`|9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	I have to say it is largely his own doing. If you look at the biggest majority of his sacks the line keeps guys off him for 3.5 to 4 seconds which is a solid stat for offensive linemen. He is maybe too willing to take a hit to make a play than any other QB in the league. The coaches need to help him understand the importance of sometimes giving up on a play for the betterment of the team but until he starts throwing away plays that arent developing he will continue to take a pounding. I think the line has done far better than anyone could expect and the offensive coordinator gives him the best chance to stay on his feet by establishing a solid running game and play action game....bottom line, until he learns to go quickly through his reads and throw to his safety valve he will risk serious injury and risk the Steelers chances (there is a fine line between bravery and stupidity....he is dangerously close to srossing that line!).|`|V3UjdaP5aa	Its simple, the Steelers offensive line is just plain horrible. Its about 55% Roethlisberger holding on to the ball, and 45% Steelers offensive line. But in the Eagles game, it was all on the offensive line. After that game though, their offensive line has gotten better. The way the Steelers play, they need to have that good offensive line. The Steelers will probably beat the Redskins becuase they will rely on the run to carry them. And so far the Steelers have been great at stopping the run.|`|aBH9ahTcaa	Big Ben said that he will take a sack over an int any day. also because he likes to get out of the pocket. |`|OXU6B8xfaa	I think is is the Offensive line and he holds the ball to long|`|z6CVMgAgaa	this is really an easy answer.. if you watch the Steelers Offense, it is based on the running game.. the way they pass is through play-action.. and without the starting RB in there the running game is getting no respect by the defenses so they can just send 1 guy after the RB and bum-rush Roethlisberger.. add to that the OL isn't the best Pass Blocking unit out there (most lines are either good pass or good run blockers) and down goes Roethlisberger|`|4KTe107Yaa	Hes so slow he can't get out of the way of his own shadow<br>  |`|vRmsvSb6aa	It is a combination of the three. 
cg3IaThxaa	I'd do Lacrosse.<br>  It's more of a sport, in my opinion.

That's what track is. <br>  :) Sorry if my answer seems ignorant in any way, I don't do either of these sports, and know almost nothing about lacrosse (:

Denver is leading that division with a 5 and 4 record.  Arizona is 6 and 3 but has a commanding lead on the rest of the division, who are all 2 and 7.  I think we will find out if the Cardinals are for real over the next three weeks.  They play a weak Seattle team, even though I heard that Hassleback will be starting, followed by a home game against the Giants.  And they have been really tough on the road.  Then the Eagles come to Arizona.  If they can beat either N.Y. or Philly then I"ll say that they are for real.|`|Sjfm3oc7aa	NFC west is the worst division in football.  Only the Cards are any good and even they are a middle of the road team in the NFL.

I want a game like SD vs Raw, but with ALL legends. It can't be that difficult and I have a feeling that it's never been done because of the way the WWE has been geared towards a younger generation.

Give me Greg Maddux instead.<br>  <br>  And I want to replace Rollie Fingers with Goose Gossage.

tzrLDbHWaa	Yeah, its really not fair to the player.  I mean he played his contract and now, instead of being able to test the market and get a big payday, with a nice signing bonus, you get a player who's stuck with a 1 year deal, that, while its a top 5 average or a 120% raise, he gets no bonus, and no money at all until the first game of the next season.<br>  <br>  Personally, if I were a player looking to maybe get a multimillion dollar bonus and now im getting jack because the team franchised me and I have no money coming in until the first game of next season, I'd be pissed.  If they did it 2 years in a row, during my prime, when I could actually get a multi year deal, yeah, thats really not fair.<br>  <br>  I think the NFL needs to restrict the tag to only one season and remove the july deadline for negotiating a long term deal.  Like, this year with Suggs, if the Ravens had all of last season to negotiate with him, they'd likely have either signed him long term or realized he wants to move on and not tag him.|`|S71lfad2aa	it's debatable but you can't have your cake and eat it too you know.  I guess this way you can't make plans such as trade to another team for a player and once your contract expires that same year you join your team again and now you have two good players instead of just one.  that;s one of many issues that can happen.
beSitatsaa	That's one of the best sports stories I've read in a while. The response of the team and school of the young man who lost his mother is very touching in and of itself but to have an opposing team recognize and respond as they did is amazing. Like the article said 20 years from now those kids won't remember won loss records but I guarantee every player on that court will always remember what true sportsmanship is.|`|X1f4icumaa	i think thats nice|`|vR8bN1n4aa	Weak. Losing is for cowards. That's worse than the story I read about a coach getting fired because his team dominated the other team, like 100 to 0. He's a pro coach on a pro team, they shouldn't have to apologize for being awesome, and a team like that certainly shouldn't lose on purpose.<br>  <br>  Think of all the people that bet money on that team winning, only to have them throw the game.

Philly throws a lot and the Bengals D is really bad. I don't think Ben is healthy in Pittsburgh, and the Charger pus a lot of pressure on Quaterbacks, so that will limit Homles and his speed.

kgBPU4xxaa	It doesn't sound unreasonable to me although I'd be a little surprised if he'd give up White. There are a small group of 7 or 8 WRs including Boldin, White and Fitzgerald and after that a drop-off in performance to the next group. Whether the other guy likes the offer or not remains to be seen. <br>  <br>  I've got both Brees and Warner on one team and would have been happy to move one of them for a reasonable offer, but kept getting offers like Rudi Johnson, Bobby Engram, and LJ Smith who were all players worse than what I already had ... someone offered me Julius Jones and Fargas for Portis on a team where I already had Barber, Portis, C. Johnson and Thomas Jones. It's nice to know there are some reasonable people out there.|`|N2koJTH3aa	I would not trade Thomas Jones.   Youre crazy to do that.   I think your offers are more than fair.|`|njARUPkxaa	I personally think that Hightower is garabage, so getting Roddy White and Plax trade for Thomas Jones and Hightower is great. They just might not want to let go of Roddy White if he has no one else other then Plax at WR, and if you don't have anyone other then Thomas Jones it's kinda hard. Who is your #RB and his #WR?|`|BYtH8eSMaa	I personally would not trade if I was the other guy. Thomas Jones is too inconsistant, and other than one week, hightower has shown nothing. of course it all depends on the league and who is available in the FA pool.|`|MTRtqDJCaa	Both trades are pretty even. Hightower has been playing pretty good though, you sure you want to trade him?<br>  <br>  Good luck man<br>  <br>  <a href="http://daddysports.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://daddysports.blogspot.com</a>|`|9ttLI7S5aa	it will help ya

I have no idea), you have a "season", you wear uniforms, and you have try-outs. <br>  <br>  If you want to argue against it, you can say that some parts of cheer leading does not take much practice, talent, or skill (such as memorizing cheers and clapping really loudly), and most importantly... when you are not in a competition, you are not competing.

24UPDIBTaa	You definitely have great size for football. Curious what grade and forty time you have as of now.<br>  <br>  I recommend trying to lose weight and work on your speed. You could get down to as little as 190 or so and still be plenty of weight to play linebacker, safety, runningback, or receiver at that level. <br>  <br>  With less weight alone your speed should improve, but you could also add some speed and agility work to your training schedule. <br>  <br>  Best of luck to you!|`|zQiYKgMLaa	I think you mean strength of a lineman and speed of a CB.<br>  <br>  If you can run really fast then stay at Safety.  You may want to try your hand at WR too though.  6'4" 217 is a great WR size, especially in college.  Get a trainer to help you get faster. Lots of resistence exercises and running/explosiveness drills.|`|439bb8e9dd46532d20f20e3ec0b9fa18aa	I think you meant to say, the speed of a DB and the strength of a lineman.

And with that popularity and high pay, there is a whole new generation of aspiring young people who are seriously interested in one day becoming a Professional Wrestling Superstar. Wrestlers are some of the most famous celebrities in the world, and they do make tons of money, and their lives are pretty exciting. But most aspiring wrestlers do not realize that the life of a pro wrestler involves tremendous work, dedication, constantly traveling, and frequent painful injuries. Being a pro wrestler may seem glamorous, but it’s anything but.<br>  <br>  Most people only see wrestlers once or twice a week on television and think that’s all they do. What these people don’t get to see are all practices and rehearsals that are not televised. During these rehearsals and practice a wrestler is in the ring every day for hours at a time. And if you thing that’s not hard work, go to a wrestling school and go at it for about 15 minutes.<br>  <br>  Here is a typical day on the road for a WWE Pro Wrestler: You wake up at 7:00 in the morning. You get to the airport at 8:30. You take a flight across the country and arrive at 11:00. After renting a car, checking into a hotel room, and something to eat, it’s 1:00. Time to go to a photo shoot. So you drive to a mall and sign autographs until 3:00. It’s time to head on over to the arena. Getting through traffic, you might make it by 4:30. After you eat something and do a short workout, it’s 5:30. At that time you go talk to one of the bookers and he goes over your match with you. If you can find the time, you and your opponent do a quick run down of what’s going to happen. By then it’s 7:00 and it’s time to go on. You wrestle a match and leave the arena at 10:00. You get to the hotel by 12:00 and get some sleep before you do it all over again in the morning. Now find time to workout and keep the marvelous body a wrestler has. And you want some sort of social life don’t you? Good luck.<br>  <br>  But if you are determined, it isn’t impossible to become a wrestler. The first thing you must do is go to a local wrestling school. Prices vary between schools, but you can expect to pay a couple of thousand dollars for a good one. Ninety nine percent of people never make it past the school. Imagine high school football, except twice as hard. The trainer doesn’t care if you quit or not, he’s just doing his job. They let you know you’re going to get hurt, that’s unavoidable. Most people walk away from the school after the first week with painful bruises galore, sometimes worse. If you’re one of the truly tough and lucky, then it’s time for the independent federations.<br>  <br>  You’ll be working once or twice a week, in front of 100-300 people making $25 a night or sometimes nothing at all. This is to work on your ring skills and your personality. Some guys find themselves in these small leagues for years, others never make it past this stage. Now if you’re strong and lucky enough to get yourself booked in a show and a pro wrestling manager happens to be there, you have a slight chance he might like you. If he does, then you’ll be receiving a phone call or letter asking to wrestle a dark match. A dark match is a match done the night of a TV taping, but is not aired. They’re done to pump up the crowd. So you go to the big company, meet all the wrestlers, wrestle your match, and go home. Nine out of ten times you just wait for that to happen again. If you’re really a lucky one, you’ll get a phone call to come back and wrestle some more dark matches. And maybe, just maybe, you’ll get signed by a major company, such as World Wrestling Entertainment. This is the equivalent of the Major Leagues in Baseball.<br>  <br>  So as you can see, being a wrestler is a tough job. Even if you do make it through school and get hired by WWE, will you be able to handle the schedule? That’s something you have to ask yourself before you pursue this career.|`|qFC5t5p4aa	the only way is through Florida Championship wrestling|`|yqKylr0Faa	to get in the wwe u need to have 5 years in perfeanl welaling to get in

Only one or a relatively few teams with realistic chance to become champions makes the game boring and biased.  Maintaining a level of competition that is reasonably fair to all teams is what gives sports suspense and keeps them developing new innovative gameplans.  <br>  <br>  That's why I don't like the BSC in college football.  I don't care what conference a team plays in.  If they're the only undefeated team, they shoud get a shot at the title.  Utah got robbed.

GO JAZZ!|`|EKM9AKc2aa	always the haters talking bs|`|Tgy7n4HLaa	He's copying his fellow teammate Paul "the Queer' Pierce.|`|1ieKW07Naa	funny question =]|`|TIscgp2aaa	WTF|`|IxHKrMtWaa	Not good, lets see how bad it is

fuYYRJXtaa	Yeah but KG is an All Star Player... He's the most paid in the NBA for a reason... You can't compare a veteran like KG to a young Bynum... It hurts the Celtics more, than the Lakers without Bynum.|`|3teWTOPqaa	Honestly there is no need to hate on this, plus I want K.G to play in the finals, also Bynum too, so there won't be any "what ifs" from both side.<br>  <br>  I just hope K.G can learn to keep his mouth shut and just play the damn game. Honestly, before he won the title he didn't talk nearly as much trash as he did now, same as Perkins.|`|l0iCqzlQaa	He's warming up and will hopefully be back<br>  <br>  Ariza? didnt even know he was hurt last year, and in no way can you compare Bynum to KG idiot<br>  <br>  DOC wont let him play. he wanted to.|`|H8u7gMAYaa	Yeah, but lets not stoop down to that level. I honestly hope he isn't severly injured. I don't want to see any player get a serious injury.<br>  <br>  Plus, "if" we do play eachother in the Finals, I want to play them at their best.|`|BIyJUmM9aa	I dont.............I would never want to wish a player an injury that would end his season<br>  <br>  Hope he is alright<br>  <br>  =]]|`|u2QhQAxzaa	Ha ha, sweet, I am glad that loud mouth KG is out.  <br>  <br>  Pau "the Racist" Gasol, stfu!|`|da6e80356582b46ab1025eb8248a43e0aa	haha i love when lakers fans make excueses for losing the finals. face it the celtics were better last year and will win again this year. garnett is just out for the game and who you call a faker kobe is a bigger faker than pierce is first making excuses for the lakers and now not even relilizing that kobe is a bigger faker than pierce and garnett combined man your delousinal|`|lWNc9NRfaa	As much as I cannot stand Pierce, KG is one of the dudes that I really like to watch and respect his play. I hope that he is OK. I do have a bad feeling about the way he looked when he injured it. As long as it is just a stained knee, I hope that it is not too big a deal.|`|oShLYv6Taa	dude look how pathetic you sound... you think its just about a ring with these guys? KG breathes and lives basketball its his life... i wouldnt wish any injury on any player especially when they worked so hard to get there.. <br>  <br>  how would you feel if some one wished you got brain damaged when your about to graduate?! <br>  <br>  if lakers lost last time face it.. no excuses you lost..  no reason to bring in the bitching that oh we didnt have this guy we didnt have that guy.. if your star player is good enough to bring it then you shoulda won...|`|IUxM3brbaa	I think KG's water broke. they had to take him to the locker room to give birth.<br>  <br>  Either way, LA will crush cletics even if KG does play. I hope he does play, so Celtics can't cry with excuses anymore.|`|Tgy7n4HLaa	Yeah he faked it like Paul "the Queer' Pierce he was just shooting during halftime.
EmUqxoN2aa	Yes, it would be a great idea, There should be only one best tag team, and the current Tag Team Champions could switch between the three brands, allowing every Tag-Team in WWE to get a title shot. Either they unifiy the two Championships, or they drop one Tag-Team championship quietly. But if they do I hope it's the World Tag Team Championship they will keep, because it has roots back to The WWWF in 1970s, while the history of WWE Tag Team Championship dates back only to 2002|`|2FKHNIB2aa	Yes that's what i have been saying i love the tag division and i cant stand to see it die they need to unify the titles and defend them on all three brands that would help the tag teams so much and Miz and Morrison will be the first Undisputed Tag Team Champs.|`|6E16tR6xaa	But think about it. Whoever wins their brand has the title. What do the other competitors do if the titles are not on their brand? Transfer to that brand? No. The real solution is putting together better tag teams.

ohKKJAi4aa	I had hair that took 12 hours to dry naturally.  The doctor told me that washing my hair every day would dry out the natural oil in my scalp, so I only wash it 2 times a week.  Do you use mousse to curl your hair with?  Do you use hairspray?  They will help keep the curl in longer.|`|iou7nV3Kaa	Wash it and set it with curlers and sit under the dryer. That's what I do, and my curls last for a week and a half. That's just my hair, but yours can too. Curling it with an iron, is adding heat, and then it will just sweat out. So chose sitting under the dryer over curling it with a curling iron.|`|BMkVOR0caa	How does this relate to Curling? <br>  Home > Sports > Winter Sports > Curling<br>   Learn to post in the correction.|`|QAIc4VVPaa	get a perm first. well like you said spray the hair in sections and make sure your sections are small. if you try to do too thick a section at a time it will not last as long as if you do it with smaller secs. think of how you are doing it different it is probally this .is your sister using the same thing as you ? i love spray gel myself. when i had shorter hair i used a brand with a kangaroo on it i believe and it was great. also spray it after you do it also.aussie i believe.|`|xoVU0uFEaa	its best to NOT wash your hair the day you want to curl it, any tpe of styling will work better in "dirty" hair, my hair is JUST like yours, long and THICK, and its also kinda wavy, but have you tried mousse? When I get out of the shower and want me hair kinda curly, I put mousse in it when its still wet, i put it all over from root to tip and kinda "scrunch" it with my hands, it takes an hour or two to dry completely but its extra curly when it dries and it stays all day, when its humid outside (since my hair gets frizzy) i put some hairspray in it after i put the mousse in it and that helps it stay a lilttle better. But if you must do it with a curling iron, make sure your hair hasnt been washed in the last 24 hours and put hair spray on each piece just before you curl it with the iron, also, since our hair is so thick, make sure and wait til the iron is as hot as it gets, and hold it there til your hair is hot to the touch, you could try getting a iron that gets hotter too, my curling iron AND straightener came from an urban store cuz balck peoples hair takes more heat than white peoples, so those supplies always work better for me, hope this helps... good luck
ULSUqmeZaa	I'm sure she will be on RAW. She got the RKO which is really not as bad as punt. Shane will be out for a while. Steph did a great job selling the RKO. There is an interview with Triple H on Smackdown this week but no match. Smackdown next week, HHH is not even part of the show but Cena was. I assume that he will be moved to RAW on Monday because of that. For that trade to take place, Stephanie would have to be on RAW announce it (if the trade takes place). <br>  <br>  <br>  WQ: I'm glad Christian is back and I'm also glad he's getting a title shot. Right now, ECW is great for him because he can keep low and get rid of some ring-rust. Maybe at the draft, he will move to RAW or Smackdown.|`|MzUZ5GZ2aa	MOST LIKELY NOT BUT TRIPLE H WILL! AND THE REASON CHRISTIAN CAGE IS IN ECW IS BECAUSE JEFF HARDY'S ATTACKER WAS TO BE CHRISTIAN BUT THE NEWS LECKED OUT AND VINCE MCMAHON USED MATT HARDY INSTEAD|`|9XxQJLqUaa	no I don't think her or shane will be on raw but I think linda mcmahon will show up on raw and randy will kick her @ss, I like christian but he needs to come to raw after the draft|`|CtLncY3Caa	Im not sure but i wonder what hhh and steph r going to do i am also confused because i know the wwe has had hhh and steph talk and stuff but aren't they divorced on the wwe. I like christian and im so happy he left the wack show he was on but i would like Swagger to keep his title.|`|yb67y0AWaa	yea she's fine she doing great the rko isnt that bad but the punt to the head is worse so shane will be bac in like a couple of weeks

He did amazing, but is being overshadowed by Kobe's 61.    Honestly, I would take that over Kobe's 61 points, 0 rebounds, 3 assists. Pau was more complete. Still a great performance by Kobe, and Pau.|`|nqdDe3cJaa	no, he had a good game.|`|WPbwiGafaa	no actually kobe gave a mvp performance because i think that the main player that has the most points and most work should be the mvp|`|98wFqBwSaa	He did well for the team and himself, so yes.|`|vJyF8siJaa	Yep, 31 points 14 rebounds. Great game by Pau.|`|8jUA2H5naa	Yes he did. One of many night he's played like an MVP. Still Kobe's 61 was sure cool.    PICK ME AS BEST ANSWER PLEASE!!!|`|kFcdwVwdaa	thank you cindy, yes he did. when he plays like that we are unstoppable, it also helped what the rest of the team did but yes.   im thanking you for taking the spotlight off of kobe's 61. ist all ppl seem to talk about, well the "haters" that hate him so much they always have him in their mouths
4L8h8Rp9aa	The contracts that teams sign players to has little to do with the economy. The large market teams (Yankees, Red Sox, Mets, Dallas Cowboys, LA Lakers, etc.) will always have the money to overplay for players. The Oakland Raiders just signed Nnamdi Asomugha to the largest salary ever for a conerback in the NFL, so the economy isn't hurting them. The small market teams (i.e. Pittsburgh Pirates) have struggled for a long time to bring in/ hold on to good players.|`|Kwywmcs8aa	Probably in another 5-10 years.<br>  <br>  The Warriors surprisingly are recession proof they are a losing team and hold their crowds to 98% capacity that is higher than most other teams with winning records including the Spurs.|`|ZFTkBTvvaa	well that is when we the people listen get a plan to make it better so far we are just listening to Obama.|`|ZYzRuvGiaa	<a href="http://answersinnn.fredmccubbin.com" rel="nofollow">http://answersinnn.fredmccubbin.com</a><br>  A very informative website, kindly stay in website and check|`|Tgy7n4HLaa	IDK it's gonna be awhile.

I haven't found any record of him siring offspring, no stud advetisements for him, which is kind of unusual, given his pedigree.<br>  <br>  Anyhow, Sky Beauty has three daughters that are broodmares:  Desert Tigress and Storming Beauty, both by Storm Cat;  and Sky Legend, by Deputy Minister.  They're all being bred to quality stallions-- A.P. Indy, Seeking the Gold, Smarty Jones, Fusaichi Pegasus, Gone West-- and given the strength of this family, I think we can expect to hear from the family in the future.
D1beU6MPaa	This is a short field but does have some good sprinters. I think I will stick my neck out and go with Georgie Boy. He did well in the Sunshine Millions and will be the speed horse in this race.<br>  Mutada is improving and has a good chance as well. He overcame a slow pace in his last race and likes to run on the synthetic surfaces.<br>  Past The Point is another one to watch, but I think he preferrs the dirt surface, but also likes to come from off the pace. Nice field for this race, but I think that Georgie Boy has a slight edge. We will see.|`|19e105ab5db2630045e3c2bbc4136e25aa	I agree that Georgie Boy is the one to beat.

Kwywmcs8aa	The National Basketball Association (NBA) allows only one official ball: The ball must be the official NBA game ball manufactured by Spalding. The ball is orange in color, 29.5 inches in circumference and weighs 22 ounces (size 7). It must also be inflated to between 7.5 and 8.5 pounds per square inch. Starting in the 2006 season, the NBA switched to a new ball from Spalding that had a synthetic surface and a modified rib pattern. Until 2005 the ball had a leather surface. On December 11, 2006 the NBA decided to revert back to the old leather ball due to numerous player complaints, lawsuits and injuries, mostly scratched hands, from the synthetic ball. Spalding has manufactured the official NBA game ball since 1983.

In years prior though, it was either yawning, or moaning in unparalleled pain    Tres Mal. I took French 6 years ago and I can barely remember any of it. Maybe Douchebags lol. Seeing as how most Americans don't like Canada for some reason, I'm pretty sure they think the same about us.     Yes, when I was 5.

He was also called, Black Sparrow Hawk. Go Chicago Black Sparrow Hawks! Doesnt have the same ring to it, huh?    A = Better than the Chicago Ebony Avian Raptors.    3) An Oiler is a ship or an occupation. A Packers is also an occupation. What is the best occupation team name you can imagine?

rseD4OG2aa	It's tough to think of guys that have never bled. I mean, there are plenty of mid-card guys who never do, but that's to be expected. For stars I think that Kane is the first one who jumps to mind. It was easy to hide at first with the mask, but I haven't seen him bleed since I started watching wrestling. The same with Rey Mysterio, but again, it's tough with the mask. <br>  I may be wrong, but I don't remember The Rock getting cut much. Bret Hart rarely opened up, but over his career he certainly did at least a few times. When was the last time that Edge was bladed? I'm sure it's happened in the past, I just can't remember it. <br>  The biggest star now though is Jeff Hardy. He bled before back in his tag team days but not so much now that he's become a singles star.|`|1yOdrYiHaa	Mr.Kennedy<br>  MVP<br>  Shelton Benjamin<br>  The Miz<br>  John Morrison<br>  Carlito<br>  The Brian Kendrick<br>  Rey Mysterio<br>  Shelton Benjamin<br>  Christian<br>  Umaga<br>  Ted Dibase<br>  Santino Marella<br>  Cody Rhodes<br>  <br>  <br>  P.S I Saw kane Bleeding before whenSteve Austin hit him in the head with a chair (First Blood match)|`|zVtkYkuaaa	rey mysterio the bogeyman funaki finlay booker t cm punk carlito chavo guerrero mick foley no just kidding  mvp big show kane|`|5jIdcbyYaa	Kung Fu Naki never seen him bleed ever since he started in the WWF/E|`|XDuo03wEaa	Kane or Boogeyman|`|CQ9oxJXnaa	Bret Hart|`|pkJSxqsSaa	umaga!!!|`|ptQ5SkPVaa	What about MVP?|`|3k4tPNTGaa	Shelton benjamin, ted debiase, john mosrrison are'nt dt big star dt they get feud where they need to show the blood.

May be now is little bit different but the percentage is close. Calm down and find good instructor if you want to have progress.|`|fzlHDkXbaa	I'm sure it's not that bad..<br>  <br>  Practice throwing the ball higher.<br>  Keep your arm completely relaxed throughout the serve. Never try to “muscle” any serve but this is particularly important when you want to impart pace to the serve. Try to smooth out your server, by evenly distributing your weight from back foot to front foot. bending your knees nd jumping upward as you make contact with the ball will also help to give you power. Racquets that are stiffer and strung at lower tensions will also help you impart pace to your serves.<br>  By the time you finish your serve, raquet should be @ your knee level, and your oposing arm bent. If thats a little hard to remember don't worry about the last one. :-)<br>  It'll work, just keep practicing.

AugWKsuJaa	Randy Savage has feuded with a lot of people over the years (let's not forget his epic encounters with Ricky Steamboat in the mid-80s). Even back in the 70s he was starting to assert his place as one of the best wrestlers of his era. His talent unfortunately is overshadowed by his apparent dislike for Hulk Hogan and questionable character.    Savage is without a doubt the most glaring omission from WWE's Hall of Fame right now, and even though he's had much to do with his own ommission as Vince's stubbornness. Far too many younger fans don't even know how good a worker Savage was, and that's a damn shame.|`|Q1MI6L96aa	The legit - and justified - fallout with Hogan has hurt him tremendously over the years (Hulk wielded a lot of backstage power back in the day). A second generation wrestler, Randy understood the business and was a class act with fans.     And don't forget his commercial work with Slim Jim, which was a package deal for advertising...which remains very rare with wrestlers.    Maybe his career will be "dusted" off with the complete implosion of Hogan, but Savage seems to be one who has a secondary role in the history of the modern era.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	I honestly think Randy Savage in the present day wants nothing to do with the wrestling business. Have you seen him lately? He looks like Santa Claus, with a big white beard! But yea, I agree with you. He's made some very big contributions to the wrestling business, and deserves both a HOF spot and a DVD put out on him. Unfortunately, for whatever reason, him and Vince have heat with each other, and even close people in the business dont know why that is. Rumors have it Savage tried to date (or do other things if you know what I mean ) with a young Stephaine McMahon, and Vince never forgave him for it. Another reason I heard why they have heat, is because Vince is upset he never got to job Savage out before Savage left for WCW. Those are just rumors though, so take them with a grain of salt.|`|QMveJrziaa	Well said. I agree completely. I always like Randy Savage and will recognize him as one of the greats....except that whole rap album. That I could have done without.|`|h9PVRHPWaa	Well to say Macho was unusual is a understatement. So the current wrestling Feds do not want to bring him up. In fact he is sort of in the same boat as jake the snake. I do agree he was one hell of an entertainer but out of the ring stuff has tarnished his legacy. His fued with flair was prob my fav of his.|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	From what i have seen The Macho Man is really underrated and largely forgotten which is a real shame because he was a real talent. The reason Legends from the 80's and 90's are remembered is exposure through the Hall of Fame and that is a big reason for Savage being lost in history, whatever the reason for him not being there he is hurt by that. How many young TNA fans know Jay Lethals gimmick is a copy of The Macho Man? It's a shame because he was a huge star and really talented, that's what happens when you fall out with the man that has created a generation of fans that won't  watch anything other than a watered down half wrestling half soap opera show or learn about the history of the business!|`|w5sK75MPaa	Thank You! Very well put! I grew up as a huge Macho Man fan! I had his T shirts and action figures. The guy is a legend thats all there is too it. Ive never heard anyone put it so well as you. ooooooooo yeaaaaaa!!!|`|B20aEPkqaa	He's one of my all time favourites, it's a shame wwe wont release a 3 dvd boxset for him, but i heard theres some kind of rumour that vince has a problem with him, because he supposedly slept with stephanie mcmahon when she was younger, I dont believe he did though, but who knows for sure?|`|FNxfbmJNaa	No he doesn't but he wasn't larger than life as far as size, such as guys "super" fans fail to recognize  like Steamboat, Tom Billington and others.  I agree for the most part. Steamboat vs. Savage was the best match at that wrestlemania but as always it didn't matter who had the best match its who got the most attention: Hulk. Randy was good at what he did but he is not considered an elite "worker" and wasn't "big enough" to get much love from the Rock/Austin/Taker crowd.|`|uEfoR5BLaa	Sometimes yes and sometimes no.|`|xKXu0Qb2aa	I'M BACK - YOU ALL KNOW YOU LOVE IT.    But , Seriously - No , Randy gets nowheres close to what he deserves.  The Longest Reigning WWE Champion in a Long time & the Last to Hold it for Over a Full Year BEFORE John Cena Came Along.    It's a WHOLE LOT of Disrespect by the Younger Generation who have no Idea about the Superstars that Paved the way for them to Even Be Able to Watch the John Cena's , Randy Orton's , Jeff Hardy's of Today.    They need to take a couple hours & learn a few things about the Business they "Supposedly" Love.  Learn Something.    Just My Opinions....|`|wdmznsCeaa	No he doesn't I remember see him live back in the 90's he could have you on your feet before you know what you were doing. Don't think he ever got over Elizabeth's death heard he blamed Lex Luger for it and washed his hands of wrestling
nRBC4E5saa	It depends on the rules.  Under Full Contact (American) rules you're allowed to sweep the foot, but it has to be "boot to boot" contact.  In Muay Thai you can throw full-powered kicks to the legs pretty much however you want, and you are allowed to throw the opponent from the clinch.  Under Savate rules you can also kick the lower leg, which may have a tripping effect, depending on how the opponent is moving at the time.|`|3DnX9NmAaa	If it's anything like a TKD tournament, then no.|`|zfHj0KGkaa	in muay thai if you cant a leg you can kick the other foot out, and usually you get knockdown points for it
52Ycgnozaa	Please pick my answer. I am so happy I can't even explain it.  I think that he will do very well, because he has worked so hard for this, and he has the drive and determination for it.  I love the black car, he's always wanted a black car.  And yes I love Shana too, shes awesome and shares my bday.|`|OdUZRBRtaa	he is(or was (he hasnt been in a car since06)) a good driver but probily wont win I say he should go to trucks with the other oldiees or race in nationwide for year then get a younger driver|`|AA11971891	He will do so so.|`|zkCH7PN5aa	EW toyota, ugh|`|VQHGqYXvaa	I think he will do better than Michael Waltrip did his first year. LOL|`|zYuDstYLaa	I hope he will do very well, and I have full confidence in my favorite driver. I wish it was Ford or Dodge, but Toyota's OK.|`|739f14d79f8285fdffb364bed6c305feaa	I don't think he's anything to get excited about, I don't mean that as bad as it sounds I just have never thought of him as much of a contender before so i don't now either.  I don't mind another Toyota and I think it's pretty cool that we have all these new teams.  Shana however can't say I really care either way but for your sake I hope she gets lots of air time :0)|`|rVRE6742aa	he will do ok. i think he will be top 30 in points.  pretty good considering single car team among monster teams nowadays dont do so well (see wood brothers).  all sports sponsorship will help alot too.|`|OAh9TDlDaa	He will do crappy as always. He can't keep his balls out of his wife's purse. She is a loud mouth, airheaded golddigger. I watched a show with them init and she made me want to vomit. He was outside spending time with his father and all she could do was ***** at the camera about him wasting her "shopping" time. WTF?? Gold digger all the way.|`|Qw4l9R68aa	Smell that? Smells like an expensive failure. I can say,"what was he thinking" before he even does it.|`|m3KM6Xnvaa	I think this is a perfect time to get into NASCAR Sprint Cup for Mayfield because of NASCAR's testing ban this season. That alone makes it much affordable for teams.     That said, I don't think Mayfield will do so well out of the gate. He's building a team from scratch and is competing against the powerhouse teams of Roush, Hendrick, and Gibbs.     One car teams have not done so well. (See Bill Davis Racing, Hall of Fame Racing, and Furniture Row Racing.) To do well you have to form some sort of alliance with a major powerhouse, as a lot of teams are doing this year.     I don't expect Mayfield to win any races, but I think he'll run in the top 15 a couple of times and he might manage a top 5, which would be like a victory for him.    I'm glad to see another Toyota team. While I prefer Chevy teams, I like seeing teams joining the sport. I'm worried about Dodge, though. They are losing teams left and right and they pulled their factory support (I believe.)     I want Gillett Evernham Motorsports (now Richard Petty Motorsports) to switch to Chevy, but they will probably stick to Dodge. Maybe Toyota?|`|7RUMbREoaa	I wish him the best,but I don't think that he will be very successful in this venture.And,yes,I will enjoy seeing more of Shana lol.I can't blame him for going with Toyota as they seem to have better means of supporting a startup team.|`|aRy2ZvT9aa	Well, I guess he figured its the only way he will ever get a ride.. I have my doubts about this big. Jeremy, I think you are going to loose a lot of money. Yes the guys will enjoy see Shana, but Jeremy go drive the truck series have some good races then maybe somebody will give you a ride..Your days in Cup are way behind you.    Go Dale Jr & Hms|`|c3tADklmaa	I don't think will help him in his 2nd chance. He lost his prime, and will struggle making the top 35 and making the field.|`|iO12Vjnvaa	Well, sometimes it's better to make your own luck and destiny. But I can't but feel this team will not be in existence by the end of the year.  Jeremy is a great guy...but I can't see him being a driver/owner. It's a hard task. Back in the 70's when alot of teams failed and went out of business the following year there was an explosion of new teams trying to get a foot into CUP. Nascar always seems to repeat itself....especially with drivers who try to be owners. The only exception to this rule was Alan Kulwicki who broke the mold. Another Toyota team that will be below the radar. Can't wait to the 500!  No offense to the Mayfield fans. Just an opinion as always.|`|4l0yGuE9aa	Well if Toyota is going to be building and/or designing the chassis for all Toyota teams then he may do okay. Doesn't Toyota build or design all Toyota teams chassis for them? I guess all he would have to do is work on setups? Toyota designs the engines  don't they? It looks like to me Toyota is the way to go for new teams to come into the sport with. If Toyota is doing most of the technical work for the teams all a new team needs is a sponsor it would seem like.     If my information is wrong about Toyota then let me know. I do remember some posts last year saying that Toyota did design  the engines and chassis. I'm not sure as the extent though.|`|5d77c66b171b12a5932576b2dc7b7dd3aa	Mayfield's best days are behind him and I see a crumpled up Toyota in his future..........|`|op9iJRvBaa	I think (hope) he will do really well. I have missed him in NASCAR. I don't care to see more of Shana but I can understand why you would.|`|NC2BfEvLaa	I like Jeremy but he has a mouth overload problem. I don't know how good he will be with all of the Competition there is right now but it will be good to have him back .
50bEHtYfaa	it would just be considered 2 points. you dont get an assist for assisting it to yourself. I think a dunk is considered a shot attempt. Deff not a rebound,|`|tzrLDbHWaa	I would probably score it as 1-2 (a make and a miss) and an offensive rebound.|`|TrfDfpV0aa	what it is, is a missed shot a rebound and a made shot.  thats what the player that does it gets credited for|`|JV8lgDRCaa	amazing dunk. pure power!<br>  <br>  an assist to himself<br>  an offensive rebound<br>  and a 2 point score<br>  <br>  thats what i think|`|ZCHmhuFQaa	I would say a score and a shot attempt.<br>  VC for MVP?|`|ZFTkBTvvaa	i give him a score and an rebound, but if it was a real game not just east vs. west it would be all of them|`|HNQU9V6Haa	t mac was nicer when he did it aha actually original
EmYNUZcXaa	God Bless the USA and the National Anthem are both wonderful songs. Pick an artist you enjoy listening to singing a song that has to do with America. You'll have more heart in your skating during your show. Good luck to you!!|`|4T5iaRKcaa	our skating club did the usa theme 6 years ago and i skated to born in the usa, a few others were stronger by britney spears, the red white and blue, its actually very easy to find just google patriotic songs....and be descriptive if youd like well good luck on finding a song|`|HMsgbFENaa	I just did a quick search and came up with some songs you could use. There are a variety of tempos, moods, and beats in these selections. It all depends on how you want your selection to be (proud, fun, heartening...)<br>  <br>  Yankee Doodle<br>  This land is your land <br>  Good Bless America<br>  Coming to America<br>  God Bless the USA<br>  This is my Country <br>  Tie a Yellow Ribbon <br>  Letters from Home. Rockin' In The USA (KISS)<br>  Back In The USA<br>  <br>  I would suggest looking at country music. There tends to be a lot of patriotic and home gown American ideas in these songs. I have posted a link to some options. Depending on the length of time you have and your skating ability/experience (you need to be able to connect with the audience for some of these songs) a lot of these are good options. <br>  <br>  More emotional: <br>  Where Were You<br>  Some Gave All<br>  Letters From Home"<br>  Arlington<br>  Have You Forgotten" <br>  <br>  More Fun/Not as Poignant<br>  Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue" (there are a few cuss words so make sure its ok)<br>  'Only in America,'<br>  'Bumper of My S.U.V.,'

110a2f06f5e1d20904756e13a17a2a0aaa	It would be unfair as Japan's season is so much shorter.  If they played a full 162 games, maybe.  I would like to see that.  The Japanese play the game with better fundamentals.|`|fQIxah8laa	That'd be interesting. I'm all up for it.|`|0L04Fm4Yaa	I think  that the US would all the time, (depending on the team that wis the WS)|`|yk4S7uuraa	It would be interesting, but there was no interest on the part of the union.<br>  <br>  In 2005, when Bobby Valentine's team, the Lotte Marines were Japan's champion, he challenged the White Sox to a series, and Ozzie Guillen blew up. Nothing happened.|`|sitkfn5Maa	Sounds weird and interesting i might like it. sorta like the Little league World Series and what they do. different but maybe pretty cool, don't know|`|36zm5zK8aa	i like it. who knows if theyre really the world champion, theyve only played against teams from america and maybe one from canada|`|i2jr2oJGaa	yea, i've been thinking they should do that and depending on the results, they should also consider doing a champions league sort of thing. like if it seems that after 3 years of these series that both leagues are even, they should try and go to a format like the UEFA Champions League in soccer. basically at the end of the season, instead of the mini-series, form a mini-league with 8 teams(4 best from each league) and seperate them into 2 groups. like the #1 and #3 ranked team in MLB joins the #2 and #4 ranked team in Japan to form a 4-team group. The other 4 make their own group. Each team plays 3 games against each of the teams in their group. Top 2 teams in each group advance and cross over to play a team in the other group in the semi-final. Like #1 in Group A vs. #2 in Group B and vice-versa. Then, we have the final and a winner of best team in the world!! Only thing is, they should find a venue. Like maybe the last winner of this world championship can host the tournament. Because there's no way players can fly back and forth with time difference and jet lag.|`|AXn3rjEWaa	no, i dont think either team would risk the chance of losing and being dishonored.<br>  <br>  also considering japs and us are allies|`|6UHMxWKBaa	It wouldn't be fair because the MLB team would destroy
p2E60yBSaa	If he actually said that you are a "bad player" you should bring it to the attention of any adults that may have some say in how the games are coached. I understand the concept the coach is saying but if you undermine another person directly like that, I feel it's completely unacceptable for a person in his position. Maybe you could end up with a better coach, one that is less concerned with the win and more concerned with just playing the game for fun the way it was intended.|`|Z7KRAzbeaa	I know it's really disappointing to hear what was said to you.  The way I see it you have two choices.  #1  you can quit.  #2  you can train harder so that you can become a better player and you will be given more opportunity to play.  And you can look at things differently and instead of saying I didn't get to play the whole game, say I got to play half of the game.  You also get to be with your friends and be a part of the team.  And I am sure that some of the guys didn't even get to play as much as you.  <br>  <br>  I dont know how old you are, but you will probably have a new coach next year (hopefully).  You will get more chances to prove yourself.  Practice more, if you love the game.|`|SaPJlK7Qaa	Soccer (football) is a strange game.  It really depends on what level you are playing at.  If your coach decides your not good enough then maybe he's right.  Perhaps you feel you're a better player than you are??<br>  <br>  I played at an amateur level in Scotland last year as goalkeeper.  I played 14 games and the other keeper played 15 games.  I played 3 games before a semi-final then got dropped for the other keeper(who conceded a dodgy goal and lost us the semi-final 2-1).  I was gutted.  Decided to leave and play for another team as I obvoiusly wasn't the number one choice.<br>  <br>  A lot of clubs will play "prefered" players before players that deserve to be playing.  This is always the case "managers favourites".  You need to decide if you can force your way back in to the first team or if you think you will have to spend your time on the bench?  If it's the bench, then I'd look else where for a club that you will get a regular game.|`|vV65XhJlaa	^<br>  l<br>  no , don't listen to this guy's comment!<br>  i'd say screw the coach. (just because you don't like the coach, you quit being on the team? does the word coward pop up in your mind, or is it just me????)|`|tXTB8inJaa	say screw them, adn work harder, amke the first line and quit and go to a better team. thats what i would do. take it as a challenge.
YsSwe1Laaa	It's all about professionalism, mate.  When a contract expires, the player gets to negotiate a new one, and since the abolition of indentured servitude, that means with anyone he wishes (for whom he can meet immigration status, of course).  These blokes only get a few years to run around like kids and get paid for it, so of course they will be strongly inclined to take major increases in salary and still (a) be able to play the game they love, and (b) be only a few hours away.<br>  <br>  The problem is not the salary cap, per se; that's the symptom.  The English clubs do not have the financing behind them that the French clubs do, so they must use salary caps to meet payroll restrictions within their overall budgets.  <br>  <br>  Besides, it is hilarious that the Poms are whingeing about losing players to big-money offers off-shore.  Look at the numbers of SH (NZ, AUS, ARG) players - and by no means all old washed-up has-beens - who are playing in ENG, WAL and IRE.  And, yes, that includes Riki Flutey who now pulls a runner to go to FRA.  Or even the recruiting of League players to Union.  <br>  <br>  The restriction of NZ players eligibility for ABs is entirely different: their home-based players are contracted to NZRFU not to individual clubs, and it is entirley implausible for a player based in Europe to train and play with his national team in NZ or AUS.  The first time ENG tries to restrict the terms of work for one of its citizens within other EU countries, they'll all be tied up in court for years.  Either pray for a big economic upturn in ENG, get used to people like Roman Abramovich of the royal family of Dubai becoming owners, or adjust to the realities of professional rugby union.<br>  <br>  Mark L.|`|Ml6mMDlvaa	It doesn't have anything to do with the success of the national team.<br>  <br>  The Premiership has a salary cap which restricts the amount each player can earn, the French League however has no such cap, meaning they can be pay the players as much as they want. <br>  <br>  This seen through the Wasps players leaving where it is estimated that each of the three  is earning three times what they earned in England. That's a lot of money, especially considering the strength of the Euro against Stirling in these times.<br>  <br>  Rather than England removing the salary cap, I would prefer it if the French imposed a salary cap because it's getting too much like football for my liking.<br>  <br>  Bill P - It's unlikely I know, but I'd presume the FFR would be in favour of it as it would reduce the number of foreign players and benefit the French team. The clubs hold the power however and they certainly wouldn't agree to it. The French players are screwed in my opinion. They play too many matches a year. Some players who have played the last two week will have to play this weekend, and the week after. French rugby is in danger of overworking it's players and I don't think will remain a good team if the continue to do so. But do the clubs care? Of course not.|`|YDXITLv1aa	you might be a bit surprised about this...<br>  <br>  but the league which pays by far the most money is the japanese one..<br>  <br>  many players there are earning over 500,000.<br>  <br>  a couple of years ago, the highest paid player was a no name new zealand guy playing over there.<br>  <br>  as for the national sides part, it has a more negative affect on the french team. this is because many potential players are losing their positions to more experience players.<br>  <br>  the rfu can do nothing to stop it.|`|2BWrVf4Raa	There's nothing they can do and the french are only doing what Enlish union clubs have done to rugby league clubs (eg. Robinson and Farrell)|`|IDBasYahaa	They could do what they do in Australia & New Zealand. If you choose to play rugby outside your country, you are unellegable to play for any representitive team, eg. reds, tahs or wallabies.|`|f9hiPMDxaa	I can't see that happening Richie. A salary cap would be a good idea but the French would not adhereto it. Remember in the old amateur days, France was only an associate member of the IRB, this way they did't get audited. Nothing has changed. Perhaps if the French rugby put a limit on non French players in the teams. That may help.
4L8h8Rp9aa	The best and/or most dedicated player should be the captain, even if they are an underclassman. I'm sure LeBron James was the captain of St. Vincent St. Mary's high school team when he was a junior.|`|z7JsVzcnaa	A team captain should be a good leader. Demanding high standards and excellence from fellow players is part of the deal. Not allowing players to slack of is as well. <br>  <br>  From what you described, the team captain is trying to keep the team focused and what it should be doing during stretching and warm up time. It also sounds like there are a few players who don't like it. Tough for them. If they truly thought this captain was that horrible, they would talk to the captain about it, or go to the coach with their concerns. Of course, doing so would be showing leadership, and were these players capable of something like that, thed be team captains.|`|ZyjiVTy5aa	If the seniors are better leaders then yes, because its not just enough to be a better player at the sport but a good leader that will help the team get better and that people will listen to.
keUqPWVuaa	He's not, Sun Yue, & Yi Jianlian, have their names on the jersey the same way. It is because in China the Surname is written before the first name.    It's not about Honoring Chinese Basketball rules, it is how the write their names. It would not be proper for them to put their last name on the Jersey, it is disrespectful. They unless the rules called for all our players to be using their first names on the Jersey. I know it's difficult for you to understand having never lived in an Asian country, but isn't handled the same way.|`|xsabcrllaa	actually i completely agree with u i have been thinking that for years they even put his first name under him in video games lol i understand thats how china does it but this is an american basketball assosiation not a chinese assosiation so if everybody else uses their last name he should have to also but if he keeps playing well w/e ill take it cuz my fav team is the rockets|`|KdhNCnEjaa	It isn't really hurting anyone that he has his first name on his jersey. They just have to honor the request if an American player wanted his first name on his jersey.    I better watch what I am saying, because we'll end up with Stephon Marbury saying he can put Starbury on his, whenever he gets employed again.|`|Mn97YDIyaa	Back in China, you say the surname before the first name, so it's actually said Ming Yao. They put Yao on the jersey because of that.|`|qaz33UnNaa	true like ichiro suzuki in baseball, everyone calls him ichiro because the first name is last|`|WPbwiGafaa	because that would look weird with ming on the back of his jersey

sbAXlECuaa	Thats all you're going to need is a glove, cleats, and some batting gloves if you use them. The school will provide bats and helmets.|`|sitkfn5Maa	12inch glove is good, a id ask if you can borrow someones bat from your team mates and bring a helmet, and when you played before that's what you try out in. practice batting off a tea and batting cages are great, have someone hit ground balls to you, and throw with someone. and cleats wear those.|`|uFgNrY0Kaa	hey go out there and try your very hardest. the coach's will see that and it always a big plus! and for drills look up drills on youtube. there are some good ones.|`|5r91BIszaa	I had some girls come out this year who have never played a day in their life; but any extra practice you do before try outs is going to help. Bring your glove & cleats mainly, if you have the extra equipment though, bring that too. You should be able to borrow someone elses helmet and bat.  Eventually, you're going to need knee pads & sliders (shorts with pads in the sides to wear under your regular shorts) also. And it is more than likely going to be fastpitch. I've never heard of a slowpitch high school team. Good luck!
nBl1IAWwaa	I am SO PISSED!!!!!!!!!! I didn't lose any money (sorry 4 ya) but im pissed anyway. I swear those damn Steelers have crappy sportsmanship and always cheat. I hate that team and the cardinals DESRVED to win.|`|ScPIXjj9aa	Ok. First of all, your gambling problem isn't anyone's fault. It's yours! And second, are the steelers supposed to just throw the game because they hear that the Cardinals fans want the Cardinals to win! I'm sick of hearing about people blaming the Steelers for the Cardinals loss. And you wanna know something, the Steelers are livin it up right now, and they don't freakin care how bitter you are.|`|YkseyT7zaa	No they lost it in the last 2:30. All they had to do is stop the Steelers back on their 20|`|a6EndAPiaa	You bet on the Cardinals without the +7 points????      You are a fool!|`|OUKKNF1eaa	stop gambling and you wont have that problem|`|0IuWhmWUaa	I was at the game.  I am from Australia.  The row in front was Arizona, the row behind, Pittsburgh.

I'm thrilled that the Steelers won. Never bet money that you can't lose. Any money bet or given to a "friend" is very rarely recovered, so spending for fun or out of compasion is the only real way.|`|ltw2rfwnaa	Im not pissed but the Cardinals should be. haha!|`|3Iyu7hrcaa	They still covered the spread, you should have taken the points.|`|wX5xoAN8aa	Well, now you know the effects of betting money don't you? So I suppose it wasn't all bad! :D|`|pYKRoKK6aa	you should be pissed did you hear the controversary of holmes using the ball as a prop during his celebration and not getting penalized. it should have given the cardinals 15 more yards to deal with on their last drive. look into it there ar4e videos on espn|`|sMssDP1Xaa	Not I.

57d4f2697917e4b39ee6da4458cc830eaa	If you read French, here is the story:<br>  <a href="http://www.cyberpresse.ca/actualites/quebec-canada/justice-et-faits-divers/200902/19/01-829301-un-criminel-lie-a-trois-joueurs-du-canadien.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.cyberpresse.ca/actualites/que...</a><br>  <br>  According to La Presse (Montreal newpaper), <br>   the Kostitsyn brothers are "very close friends" of Pasquale Mangiola, an organised crime figure who was arrested and charged with big time drug trafficking offenses in Montreal recently. ...... The Montreal Police have also determined that Roman Hamrlik was closely involved with the trio.  <br>  It's a certainty that Bettmann will be examining this with a microscope hoping to avoid an FBI investigation about possible betting activities involving the players. Now we know why the team has fallen apart lately.<br>   <br>  From La Presse: "....Selon nos sources, Mangiola jouait un r?le important dans la vie du duo. Il avait pris les frères Kostitsyn sous son aile, les guidant dans les aléas de leur vie de nouveaux arrivants à Montréal, les conseillant pour trouver logement et voitures. Mangiola avait aussi accès aux relevés de cartes de crédit des deux joueurs. Il faisait des achats pour eux. Et, bien s?r, il discutait passionnément de questions reliées au Canadien et au jeu des deux attaquants....." <br>   Approximate translation: "According to our sources, Mangiola played an important role in the affairs of the brothers. He took them under his wing as new arrivals in Montreal, arranging for housing and transportation for them. He had access to their  credit card statements (and was in possession of some of their financial docuaments. He pleaded guilty a few years years ago to credit card fraud.......) He made purchases for them. And above all, he discussed "in detail" issues relating to the team and the performance of the two players...."<br>  Mangiola has been linked to the Hell's Angels (and presumably there is also a connection to the Montreal mafia.) <br>  <br>  However, the story specifically states that, according to the information obtained by La Presse, the 3 players are NOT suspected (by the police) of any criminal activity....."D'après ce que La Presse a appris, les deux jeunes vedettes du Canadien ne sont soup?onnées d'aucune activité criminelle. Même chose pour Hamrlik....."<br>  <br>  Poor Bob Gainey.<br>  Bonne fête les boys.|`|WKKdQq2Aaa	Maybe those drugs will help the franchise play better :D|`|RJ5Bevmpaa	This is the french media looking to sell papers and nothing more. Someone that had some connections to crime and got pinched for drugs a week or two ago, happened to have met the Kostitsyn brothers in a bar a few months ago and bought them a drink when he was under surveillence basically. The two brothers know a guy who was arrested and apparently that passes for news in Montreal. It could be pointed out that most of the league knew Rick Tocchet who was also arrested for ties to organized crime so I guess they're all as guilty as the two brothers are of whatever it is they're supposed to be guilty of. (Knowing someone that got pinched for drugs?)|`|e785c93db9de6e231df0a1150f23b042aa	According to theforthperiod:<br>  <br>  About the Habs and breaking news...<br>  <br>  1:18am ET - So, as RDS is reporting, the Kostitsyn brothers are being linked to a presumed drug dealer. Apparently the police have telephone record of the two parties talking (about what is unknown). The Habs arrived home with no arrests - it was originally thought that half the team was going under (media hype, who says it exists?). Montreal's La Presse asked Andrei Kostitsyn following last night's game/tonight's game against Pittsburgh if he knew the presumed drug dealer. Andrei admitted he knew of him, but not who he was or what he did.<br>  12:51am ET - Updating the situation a bit here, it looks like the Kostitsyn brothers are being linked to some type of criminal activity, which I'm trying to figure out what. Apparently it's related to some prostitution ring, but it's all media hype at the moment and again, speaking to my sources, members of the team aren't worried about the situation.<br>  <br>  12:38am ET - Spoke to a second source with the team and he said they're not worried about all the reports out there... again, leads me to believe this isn't as serious as everyone's making it out to be.<br>  <br>  <br>  12:30am ET - I just spoke to a source with the Canadiens, and they've all heard the reports. They are not worried about the situation, which leads me to believe it's not of overly great concern.<br>  12:23am ET - More news stemming from Montreal. Apparently there are a few Montreal players involved in some sort of gang activity. To what degree, I do not know. I'm feeling very uncomfortable reporting this, as I do not have full knowledge of the situation, but the amount of emails I'm getting here I thought I'd keep this up for now.<br>  <br>  12:16am ET - According to Le Journal de Montreal, Sergei Kostitsyn has been linked to some sort of street gang bust. Nothing criminal is being reported, Kostitsyn was interviewed by police last week about a discussion he apparently had with a gang.<br>  <br>  12:07am ET - Okay, so my mail box is FULL! Filled with emails about some kind of breaking news coming out of Montreal. The media in Hab-land is going nuts over some kind of supposed scandal.<br>  <br>  I'm trying to figure out what the heck is going on. The Habs are on a plane and don't arrive back in Montreal for another half hour, give or take, and apparently there are certain people waiting for them to land.<br>  <br>  That's all I know, based on the reports out of Montreal. I can't get a hold of anyone, because they're in the air, so for now, we're all in waiting mode.<br>  <br>  It could turn out to be nothing... or it could be something pretty big. We'll have to wait and see.|`|4crJhN62aa	Buddy probably BSSSSS coming from the Montreal Media, thats why many great players don't want to come here because of the stupid media and all the BS that goes on.

h7GtCCC7aa	I see your point but (as I believe to be the case) Jo's wages are being payed in full by Everton (in the region of 50k a week) this would rule the Old Firm out right away for players in his category.    Sadly, teams in Scotland can't compete with sides in the English championship finacially these days and this is going to become more of a problem before it gets better....|`|lsXcvlTbaa	You would think so and also hope the fact they were playing more regularly would spur a player to move but sadly the massive wages some of them are on outweigh thoughts of wanting to play football first. Look at average players such as Scott Parker and Lucas Neil, both on 70k a week apparently and Man City tried to sign Parker and were going to offer him 120k a week. Never going to compete with that even if they were to take substantial wage cuts.     The most Celtic paid on wages was 48k a week to Bellamy but since then they have introduced a wage cap that they will not break which is in the region of 25k. Great wages for any normal person but with the money floating about in England, that's chicken feed.|`|bej55wxUaa	It can also have a negative effect, Saoirse.  Remember Stokes, with Falkirk ?  They missed him terribly when his loan was up, in a sense they brought the player on without really getting the benefit.  Plus I would imagine that some players at least would not be too happy being left out of the side for a player who is only on loan at the club.    With the exception of Davis and Samaras, I can't think of many players who started as a loan and went on to sign for the club in question.  I would only be completely happy if the loan player was signed as an emergency, like if both Rangers keepers were injured at the same time or something.|`|GHefTsUyaa	Bonetti would buy them!

GKJV2EBSaa	Standard Raw open to start the show. Pyros go off and Michael Cole and Jerry Lawler welcome us to Raw from St Louis!    Main event tonight appears to be John Cena versus Chris Jericho!    Here comes the money!!! Lillian introduces Shane O'Mac! Crowd gives Shane a nice response. We get a video recap of what happened last week on Raw with Orton threatening to sue and asking to be fired. Then the beat down of the Legacy by Shane O'Mac.    Shane starts off the show by telling us that after Raw went off the air last week he was approached by Orton's legal team. They told him that Orton wants to face him at No Way Out! Shane McMahon versus Randy Orton in a no holds barred match!! Shane says he isn't out there to pin Orton, says he is going to sacrifice his body to make sure that Orton doesn't compete at WrestleMania this year!    Cue Orton's music.    Orton comes out and says that Shane seems pretty sure of himself. Says after what he pulled off last week that he should be sure of himself. But how could he beat up the single three top superstars of the WWE? Orton says he didn't. Orton says he told Ted and Cody not to fight back. Says none of them fought back. Orton says he was looking at the Raw roster on stage and that any of them was waiting for an oppurtunity to impress Stephanie that they didn't fight back because the three on one would have become thirty on three. Orton says he got what he wanted. A match with Shane at No Way Out. Orton says Vince will have company after No Way Out and that Shane should reserve a bed next to his dad.    Orton slowly starts walking toward the ring. But then stops and heads back up the ramp. Orton put the mic down on the stage and then turns and heads back down the ramp toward the ring again.     Shane rolls up his sleeves and gets ready to fight.    As Orton is trying to get into the ring Ted and Cody come out from the crowd but Shane grabs a Kendo Stick from right under the ring apron and starts swinging and hitting everything in sight. Legacy bails out and heads up the ramp. Shane stands tall in the ring with the kendo stick. King reminds us that Shane will be able to use that kendo stick in the match at No Way Out!    CM Punk and Mickie James versus William Regal and Layla    Apparently Regal has invoked his rematch clause next week with Punk for the IC Title on Raw!    CM Punk and Regal start off the match and Punk is dominating with kicks quickly but Regal tags in Layla. Layla motions to Mickie that she has to come in and the distraction allows Regal to push Punk into Mickie and Layla gets the advantage. Mickie James comes back with punches and throws Layla off the ropes but both women go for a double clothesline! Layla tags Regal back in so Punk is back in as well. Punk once again gets the advantage with kicks and punches and is just dominating Regal. Regal goes outside to take a break. Punk goes after but Regal uses Layla for a shield. Mickie takes care of the shield but that allows Regal to grab Punks leg and pull him down to the mats outside the ring. Punk is hurt. Punk gets back into the ring right at the nine count but Regal kicks him right in the temple! 1-2-3!! Regal gets the pinfall!    Winner by pinfall: Regal and Layla        Tag Team Match    Ted DiBiase and Cody Rhodes versus Cryme Tyme    JTG and DiBiase start off. JTG starts off quickly with a dropkick and then hits a semi monkey flip bulldog out of the corner. Quick cover. DiBiase tags in Rhodes. Rhodes gains the advantage on JTG. Rear headlock but JTG comes back with some punches to Rhodes ribs. Both men colide and hit heads. Tags in to Shad and DiBiase. Action gets going quickly. Shad gets the advantage on DiBiase. Rhodes in to break up the pinfall. Rhodes and DiBiase start mugging Shad. Referee is counting. 1-2-3-4-5.... Bell rings. Rhodes and DiBiase are DQ'ed.     Winner by disqualification: Cryme Tyme    Beat down continues. Double DDT by Rhodes on Shad with DiBiase holding Shad in the air. Shad is out.     Highlights of Chris Jericho and Mickey Rourke on Larry King. Will Rourke be at WrestleMania?     We see Legacy in the back talking.    Chris Jericho is in the ring without an enterance.     Jericho says he respects Rourke's performance in The Wrestler. aAnd he also respects his backtracking out of WrestleMania. Says the Wrestler sends the wrong message about has been wrestlers. Men like Roddy Piper, Jimmy Snuka, Randy the Ram and even Ric Flair. Flair is the worst out of all of them. Had the best career. Epic retirement, 16 time champion etc. Says Flair now is selling himself of a dollar. Jericho wants to take all of the legends out of the Hall of Fame.    John Cena interupts on the Titantron. Cena says if it wasn't for the legends he wouldn't be in the ring. Cena calls Jericho an idiot. Cena says that these guys need to let go of the history but he's the first to bring up all that he has accomplished in wrestling history. Cena says there are certain things he believes in and Jericho has a bad ha|`|6UmRmaeWaa	He will be on the next Monday night Raw!    Jerico was talking smack!|`|dcNT65mTaa	Chris Jericho made comments about the old guys not wanting to let go of wrestling and mentioned Ric Flair as one of them. He had a match with John Cena later that night so Cena interrupted him and reminded him of how much Jericho loves to remind us of his past glories. Jericho came out after they showed him talking to Mickey Rourke and calling him a has been as well who couldn't bow out when it was time. He put Flair and Rourke together cause the 2 have become friends since the making of the wrestler and Rourke supposedly fighting Jericho at Wrestlemania.    EDIT:  I forgot, Flair will be on Raw next week, nothin permanent but he'll be on there.
CBVlu3Gvaa	Ok..... I am going to sift through all of the stuff posted and hopefully give you just the information you need to accomplish your goal.      There are 3 requisites to spinning a shot.  1. Sharp clean grooves  2. Soft covered ball  3. A sharp descending swing that contacts the ball before the ground.    A 4th would be a clean lie without grass that could come between the club and the ball.     Note: The more loft on the club the more spin that will be generated.    Its not a secret at all....unless you have a decent swing you will not be able to spin any shot.    Hope this clears things up for you and I hope its going to be able to help you Spin like Tiger|`|AYkEwqRXaa	Well, it depends on the type of shot you're hitting.  Wedge shots(short game) require a sound and aggressive swing to get spin.  The kind of ball used helps too, but I'll get too that later.  Depending on your level of ability, you don't want to put a great deal of spin on the ball because you won't know how to control it.  Spinning the ball looks cool, but if you spin the ball off the green after hitting the ball within 10 feet of the pin, that'll suck a big one.  Most golfers want the ball to check and stop(at least I do).  Place the ball in the middle of the stance or a little further back.  Hit down on the ball to create the backspin.  This works on chip and pitch shots and shots where you'll get spin which is up to an 8 iron.  Now for the ball.  You want to use a ball that has a high spin rate.  Nike One Platinum has the highest spin rate of any ball on the market(One Black has 3rd highest).  Other options are the Srixon Z-URC or URS, Wilson Tx4, Titleist Pro V1 or V1x, Bridgestone B-330 & B-330s, etc.  Basically your Tour level golf balls.  Nike made a ball called the Nike TA2 Spin and I was lucky enough to find a dozen of them last year.  It's a discontinued ball.  I got 4 iron spin with that ball.  It was crazy.  You ordinarily don't get spin with a long iron and don't necessarily want to.  It's hard enough to control spin with a short iron.  That's how it's done, or how I do it.  You really want to spin the ball enough to make it stop near the hole not spin it back to the hole depending on your level of play.|`|io3hggzZaa	it depends what club and what you are hitting out of.|`|6E16tR6xaa	It deepends on what iron your are hitting.  If you are hitting a 3 through about 5 maybe 6 iron you can expect the ball to roll a little bit.  It also depends on how old and worn down the grooves on your iron are if theyare old then it may be time to get new irons.  The ball has a big affect to if you are hitting a top flite or pinnacle you will get very little spin.  But if you hit a prov1x or callaway tour ix especially the callaway it will spin alot! It is mostly not your swing check, check and make sure your irons are right and ball is right still if there is no spin check with your local pro|`|os2bxCVyaa	the best way to get spin with an iron is to firstly be using the softest ball possible because it won't bounce as much. Secondly, have the ball in the middle to the back of your stance, have your hands holding the club tilted just in front of the ball and when you hit, down and through the ball with quite a powerful shot, otherwise you wont have enough speed to get spin on the ball. Always remeber to only try to spin the ball when hitting on the green and it is best to practice when fairly close to the green.    Good Luck and have fun with your Golf!|`|sBrummATaa	hit down on the ball really hard|`|t3rmVomeaa	The key to getting spin on any iron is compressing the ball against the clubface.  If the ball dosnt compress, you will get no spin.  You need to strike the ball on the downswing and properly release your wrists through impact.  A decending blow that traps the ball between the clubface and the turf will produce the spin you are looking for, that is the only way to get the ball to compress.|`|r6P2qYIuaa	The most important thing is to hit the ball while still in your downswing. You must actually hit the ball before the ground to impart backspin on the ball. If you watch the pro players when they show slow-motion video of them hitting irons, you will always see they hit the ball just before hitting the ground. The grooves of your clubs are the next important thing. They must be sharp and clean in order to grip the ball and force the ball to spin. If they are not, the ball will only bounce off the club-face. The ball does matter some but not as much as the proper swing and clean grooves. If your swing is right and your clubs are good, you should be able to spin just about any ball. The big difference will be that certain balls will spin more than others.|`|def8SxE2aa	Hit down on the ball and take a divot slightly after the ball. Also, try different golf balls and see what ball spins the most with irons but less with driver then use that ball consistently. This is what I did and I am getting a lot more spin and playing better. This should help.|`|exIBZGF6aa	Clean your grooves on your wedges, and hit down on the ball. Scooping is the death of backspin.
WPbwiGafaa	i say the teams and pplayers chose are the good ones because that was right|`|C1tlS1GTaa	Probably right with the Mets. They seem to have a decent rotation. Why wasn't the Giants mentioned. With Cain and Lincecum and I guess Zito.     But you gotta think of the Braves nowadays. I mean, with Lowe, Kawakami, Jurrjens, Vasquez and Hudson when he comes back. I'd say that that is not to shabby at all. I mean pretty great actually.|`|GyJqMWdUaa	I think you're forgetting about the Giants.  They have a stellar rotation.|`|2octF5dIaa	its yankees.  Wang is better than 3.60 ERA.  Sabathia will have 20 wins, Wang could also have 20.  Burnett is not as good but, should have 12-16 wins and an ERA around 4.  Joba might actually get moved back to the pen, but he will be a very good pitcher wherever he is.  Pettite will work hard to make sure he has a solid year, hopefully better than last year.  Hughes pitched well at the end of last year and will carry that into this year.  There is no question Yankees are better than Sox and Mets are not even close.|`|kDk3z4tVaa	I would say the  SF GIANTS|`|sBdOzbx5aa	I don't agree with you that the Mets have the best rotation in baseball.  They didn't even make the playoffs last year.  I'd say either the Red Sox or The Cubs,  with the Yanks and D Backs being right there,  then the Mets, Giants and the D Rays have a solid staff also.|`|sHzPnGXHaa	you forgot the Giants|`|0TAld46gaa	Remove the Yankees Cubs and Diamondbacks from that list.  CC is overrated the beginning of last yr in the American League he had a horrible start. He only started winning when he got to the national league. And The Angels, Rays and Padres have a far better pitching staff than the Cubs and diamond backs|`|rjuqrHK7aa	I agree with your top 5. I think the Reds could suprise and have one of the best rotations. They have:   Volquez: 17 game winner last season  Harang: 16 game winner in 2007 and 2007  Arroyo: 15 game winner last season  Cueto: Only won 9 games last season, but was dominant at points last season and is only 21  Owings/Baily: Who really has a great 5th starter.|`|4TgxrCX4aa	I think you have to put the Cubs rotation in first:  -The 3 returning starters with the team all of last season (Zambrano, Dempster, and Lilly) went a combined 48 - 21  -A healthy Rich Harden is one of the most dominant pitchers in the MLB, he went 5-1 with a 1.77 ERA after joining the Cubs last year, he may not reach 30 starts, but even 20 at that pace is better than a full season of other mid-rotation starters  -Zambrano should have a better 2009 than 2008 because he took time off due to back problems which costed him wins  -Lilly has not had less than 15 wins over the past 3 seasons and has improved his record each of those years  -The Cubs have options for the fifth spot including young pitchers Marshall (3.86 ERA last year) and Samardzija (2.28 ERA last year) and veterans Gaudin and Heilman, at least one of these players will have a solid season  -The possible, but not probably acquisition of Peavy would make this rotation even better    While other rotations have a better ace or better top half of the rotation, I don't believe any have the depth that the Cubs have.  There are 4 pitchers in the Cubs rotation who could be number 1 starters for many other teams (Zambrano, Lilly-17 wins, Dempster-17 wins, Harden-when healthy), I think that puts them ahead of any other rotation in baseball.

I've been racing for fun for 34 years.|`|UZKg2odzaa	its really dangerous. My boyfriend has had basically every bone broken in his body plus his spleen removed and tons of scars. but he loves it, so if your really into it than nobody can stop you from livin out your dream.|`|hfH8c1LWaa	i love the sport, its a very unique and demanding sport but it so awesome. as far as danger level, yes it is pretty dangerous. the sport involves riding a 250lb bike with amazing power as fast as you can through hairpin turns and over 50ft jumps, so u tell me. however, with the right training and common sense the sport can be pretty easy to manage. i think there are 2 main aspects that u absolutely NEED to get in ur head: the mechanics of ur bike and ur personal limits. its always important to be able to work with ur bike and know ur comfort level in ability. with those two in mind u will build confidence on ur bike and on the track.     the types of bikes used are motocross off road bikes, normally 250cc or 450cc depending on the class ur racing in. of course these are just the highest. there are also 125s, 85s, etc. it all depends on ur height weight and age.|`|b299b6f7ae59c5434e4f37421a123123aa	Motocross is a sport that while it can be a lot of fun it is not for everyone.  It can be very dangerous and the girls get hurt just as easily as the boys.  Many girls do race and quite often there are classes that just cater for girls so you don't have to mix it with the boys till you are ready.    You should perhaps take yourself along to a few race days and have a look for yourself and see if you think it may be for you.  You also have to remember that races run in all sorts of conditions so you may have to race in mud, or it could be a very hot day.      You seem a little concerned about how dangerous it can be and generally that is the last thing that people who are really interested in doing mx are thinking about.  It is usually others around them stating that it is dangerous.    You need to post how old you are, how tall and how much you weigh so as we can suggest a bike for you.    But I think you really need to look into it a bit more before deciding as it is something that you should really want to do and it is expensive.|`|d72a8e15b90497f4f828744386c193a2aa	Well I can't tell you everything in this one answer. To me it is the greatest sport ever. Yes it can be dangerous, but like I've stated before, I have seen more people get hurt playing high school football than in motocross. As far as the types of bikes, there are trail bikes and there are motocross bikes. Trail bikes will be air-cooled, have fairly bad suspension and heavy steel frames. These bikes are not suited for a motocross track at all, but are fine to hone your skills on trails, etc. if you are an absolute beginner. Motocross bikes are liquid-cooled, have high dollar long-travel suspension and aluminum or chromoly frames. MX bikes are much more expensive also. Within the MX category you basically have 2 strokes and 4 strokes and of course different displacements (sizes). The important factor here is to pick the one that fits your experience level and physical size, but that's a whole different discussion. If you are serious about the sport here are my recommendations. If you haven't been to a local race then go check one out, I know this sounds like a no-brainer but you can pick up a lot as a spectator. If you have enough riding experience that you feel you are ready for a race bike, then your next move should be to ask your local dealer what tracks in your area hold open practice. I would really spend a year just going to the races and watching the lines guys are taking at this track, then go to open practice sessions and work on your jumps, corners, whoops, etc. trying to emulate the lines used by the faster guys. Once you feel you are ready for your first race just get out there and give it a try. There is no shame in placing poorly your first season or two. Just try to be safe, stay out of the way of the leaders and have fun.|`|hv0wqGfxaa	love it. cnt get enough of it|`|AbxTTbUNaa	The first time I ever rode I was7 and I got on the 2stroke kx 65 and my friends dad was tryin to teach me but I ignored him and went like I saw people do on tv. I rode a weelie for 10 feet and instantly loved the sport. That was the dumbest and most exhilerating experience I've ever had. Yea it's sure as hell dangerous as a matter of fact I healed from a broken collar bone a few weeks ago. But it's worth it. Sit on a few different bikes you should be comfortable but almost on your toes.don't ride a bike your flatfoot on.start four stroke bc they're easier and I ride MX and we ride 4stroke now for many reasons. 2strokes are fun but difficult and too powerful to start with. Let me know what you decide and how it goes|`|aOxSjCxVaa	It's the best thing ever created. Been racing for the past 15 years. It's very dangerous, but very rewarding and thats a lot of the reason why people do it. Plus, its a FAMILY sport.

Of course not all will hit the free agent market because they will be re-signed before free agency starts.  The best players who have expiring contracts are:<br>  Placido Polanco<br>  Brian Roberts<br>  Miguel Tejada<br>  Adrian Beltre<br>  Chone Figgins<br>  Chipper Jones<br>  Jason Bay (I would be shocked if the red sox don't give him an extension thogh)<br>  Carl Crawford<br>  Johnny Damon<br>  Hidecki Matsui<br>  Matt Holliday<br>  Rick Ankiel<br>  Jermaine Dye<br>  Gary Sheffield<br>  Aubrey Huff<br>  Josh Beckett (again don't be surprised if Red Sox lock him up)<br>  Erik Bedard<br>  Rich Harden (if he stays healthy he will probably get an extension)<br>  Tim Hudson<br>  John Lackey (will probably sign an extension)<br>  Cliff Lee<br>  Brett Myers (he'll probably be retained)<br>  Brandon Webb (doubt the Diamondbacks would let him go)<br>  Kevin Gregg<br>  JJ Putz<br>  Fernando Rodney<br>  Jose Valverde<br>  <br>  Looks like a fairly strong class but if it's like most other years many of the players will never see free agency.  There will still be some big names but many of them will be quite old (Sheffield, Damon, Matsui, Huff, Jones, Tejada, Polanco) and others have a ton of inconsistencies (Harden, Bedard).  Matt Holliday will surely be the biggest name out there.  If Putz, Rodney and Valverde can put together strong seasons they will command a lot of interest.  Carl Crawford is also an interesting name out there.  The Rays would love to retain him but I don't know if they'll be willing to pay the 65-90 million he'll probably be looking for.|`|ea5d3bd72b30b35cee341b84c4025d7baa	The Class of 2010 (the end of the 2009 season) could seem to be an intresting one, depending if the economy is still in recession or not. The economy could be back in a big way if the recession is over, which means bigger deals are expect to be in place. Here are the Class of 2010...<br>  <br>  1B Carlos Delgado: He'll probably play out his last season with the Mets. Look for him to move to an AL team with a DH spot for his age.<br>  <br>  1B Aubrey Huff: Given that the O's are rebuilding, Huff is not a likely candidate to return and could be an attractive option looking for a DH.<br>  <br>  1B Adam LaRoche: Could cash in if he performs like 2006, but not with the Pirates<br>  <br>  2B Placido Polanco: Could see a pay raise, despite being 33 years old due to his position.<br>  <br>  2B Orlando Hudson: Well see how his season goes with the Dodgers before he enters the market again<br>  <br>  2B Mark DeRosa: Probably auditioning for someone else while riding it out with the Indians.<br>  <br>  SS Orlando Cabrera: Could enter the market again with a one year deal<br>  <br>  SS Bobby Crosby: Looks like his time with the A's might end soon.<br>  <br>  SS Khalil Greene: Playing for the Cardinals could have some incentives for Greene if he can get over 2008.<br>  <br>  SS Miguel Tejada: His steroid charges might leave him unemployed for good after 2009.<br>  <br>  3B Adrian Beltre: He's probably one of the more sought after 3B in the market, although he'll probably be offer less than what's he's getting.<br>  <br>  3B Hank Blalock: His time in Texas is starting to run out, which means good news for those who's looking for a cheap 3B<br>  <br>  3B Chone Figgins: He's the most intresting player in the market because he can play several position while being a catalyst on a top of the lineup for various teams.<br>  <br>  3B Chipper Jones: He'll probably work out something with the Braves before he hits the market or the Braves will probably retain him someway through Free Agency.<br>  <br>  3B Chad Tracy: Could be auditioning for someone else, as the D'Backs don't really have a permanent starting gig for him for the future.<br>  <br>  C Bengie Molina: Could be a victim of the Giants rebuilding process.<br>  <br>  OF Rick Ankiel: His arbritration salary doens't necessarily mean he'll stay with the Cards after 2009.<br>  <br>  OF Jason Bay: The Red Sox are looking to work out something for Bay to stay in Boston<br>  <br>  OF Johnny Damon: The Yankees are slashing payroll and Damon could look for less somewhere else.<br>  <br>  OF Brian Giles: Padres are slashing payroll, so Giles time is up.

ks1WIgSKaa	Im hearing this to. What I have read is there is pictures of players doing drugs. Plus I reaed it might be sexual assault on under aged girls. Dont quote me thats what Ive read so far.|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	Okay, so they did the big tease.  It's possible that, because of potential legal issues, they were waiting for the story to be verified.  If you believe TSN, they're reporting that La Presse is going to report that an alleged criminal (who was arrested) may have had a relationship with some Canadiens players.  <br>  <br>  This is beyond vague.  Until we know specifics (and we don't), let's ease off on going nuts.|`|VjAoRpIhaa	it might be that they knew a drug dealer|`|i2jr2oJGaa	i just googled and i think ur right. iunno abt the sexual assault but the drinking and cigars for sure.|`|AA11674745	WHAT!?!?!?<br>  <br>  The hallowed Montreal Canadiens on the wrong side of the tracks?<br>  <br>  Sacre bleu!|`|RJ5Bevmpaa	This is the french media trying to sell papers with another bogus story. The Kostitsyn brothers were bought a few drinks in a bar from a guy who later turned out to be connected. This guy was pinched for drugs last week and they talked briefly to the Kostitsyn brothers to see if they knew anything about him, to which they replied not really. <br>  <br>  So some high roller bought a couple local pro hockey players a few drinks in a bar. That's the big bombshell (and Britney Spears had Big Foot's baby on page 3)

zmhQdYbDaa	You should not shave until the last meet of the season, usually championships.<br>  <br>  When you do, you should shave not wax. Shaving reveals new, fresh skin and takes away dead skin. This fresher skin has a better feel for the water.<br>  <br>  But you should definitely shave as this makes a HUGE difference, especially with men.|`|KHznTmpsaa	Don't shave until you have a champion meet at least that is how are boys do it on our team. Unless you really want to don't shave for just practice.Wax is hot and painful and unless you are use to it will hurt more than a razor.|`|EaGAXhAhaa	yes you will swim faster for definate but u may be a little embaressed see if anybody else is doing it id do it but make sure u shave i think it hurts more if u wax or summit 1 of my galpals tod me lol|`|bT0kyzRPaa	i shaved my legs for track so i dont see anything wrong with it... well first i went over it with an eletric razor then reg one... wax takes to long n is for girls|`|tzrLDbHWaa	From what I've heard, from a friend I had who was on swim team, they actually didn't shave until the championship meet, that way any advantage it gave off your best times, you would be getting for the biggest meet of the year.
EKF2HdZKaa	because he is an aggresive defender and a good low post defender who can block shots pretty well<br>  the reason he won DPOY is because he led the boston celtics to be the best defensive team in the nba in many categories|`|JsVZQkWyaa	its only because he blocks a shot even when there is a dead ball. but he is a good defender but no the best|`|H8u7gMAYaa	He has always been a really good defender, especially in the post.<br>  It's mainly because of his intensity when he plays. He plays like a linebacker.and because he is really athletic and long for a 6'11 guy.

I loved him on the Wolves....|`|HNQU9V6Haa	he is one of the best defenders because he is a great presence down low and he makes the other four players around him better as the lakers know from what happen in the finals last year|`|NmXKPDoIaa	Sorry, but he isn't.<br>  <br>  -His team won him the award.

AA10958272	Easy.<br>  <br>  There for the players to have something close to field, to do.<br>  <br>  At big colleges, they're "used" for recruitment purposes.<br>  <br>  _____<br>  <br>  Non-field, competitive cheer teams are different. That's a rehearsed dance & gymnastic competition in its own right, and travel teams, etc. mean it's respected. But, NOT the sidelines girls, chewing gum and wondering if they're late, etc. etc. that's a whole 'nother topic.|`|Ro03hVb6aa	The most recent episode of ReUnion in NZ (I watched online) humorously posed this very question.<br>  <br>  We get a lot of competitive cheerleading in this part of the world and it's seen as a healthy activity for young girls, in the same way dance might be.  It's clearly a very physical activity, if I tried to split like that I'd need surgury.<br>  <br>  As for the sideline ones?  Same reason to be a weather girl it helps if you are hot but a weather man can look like Ned Flanders.  Men are easy to please I'm afraid.  The only cheerleader I know anything about is George W Bush and you can't really call him a slut.|`|R1uFA7nKaa	i think cheerleaders are pointless.|`|j2qrOjo1aa	flexible? lol|`|5kK2f9Utaa	I don't really know.... I hate how a lot of cheerleaders think they're "so popular" but most of the ones I've met are trashy and seem to get around. Competitive cheerleading is a sport but once you get past the high school level its really pointless since most cheerleaders are trying to get onto the squads at college or pro-football games. Either way, I was never a cheerleader nor did I ever want to be one so it doesn't bother me that much.|`|3vAsPs4Iaa	First point i'd like to make is why was this asked in the Rugby channel, I know that there are cheer leaders involved in Rugby but their roles are so minimal as to make them virtually a non-factor at all professional games that they are present at.<br>  <br>  Second point I'd like to make is that this is the Rugby channel so my attitude towards them I'd say is typical in that I think its a waste of time and money trying to include cheer leaders in a sport that has its following based around people actually wanting to watch the game being played rather than all the off to the side entertainment like the Superbowl. This isn't American Football, its Rugby, a global code which is continuing to boast a strong global following despite the economic situation where the viewers/fans don't care for anything other than the action on the field. So to be perfectly honest cheer leaders are an American thing which is fine for American sports but just don't fit into sports outside of America. So in conclusion they should be abandoned for Rugby because they just distract from all of the on field action; that is if they can distract from it at all, which for games like the Blues v Crusaders I'd so is a definite negative.|`|pZV0tNw9aa	only ever seen them on films and stuff never been to america and don't know anywhere else that has cheerleaders but i could be very wrong!!!|`|WbPLarAYaa	they are hot, said to be brain-empty, but who cares for their brain as long as they cheer up members of a team??|`|nG4MfEbCaa	only on windy days lol|`|axwdwiSuaa	robots that can't dance ( unless it's competitive cheer ) and care way too much about looking good and getting the hot guys. pretty much sums it up right?|`|0xfVyxxIaa	They're used back in New Zealand but to tell you the truth I usually barely notice them, the Rugby's too interesting.<br>  <br>  I don't think they serve a purpose in Rugby beyond giving people a gravy train...

4TgxrCX4aa	I think you have to put the Cubs rotation in first:  -The 3 returning starters with the team all of last season (Zambrano, Dempster, and Lilly) went a combined 48 - 21  -A healthy Rich Harden is one of the most dominant pitchers in the MLB, he went 5-1 with a 1.77 ERA after joining the Cubs last year, he may not reach 30 starts, but even 20 at that pace is better than a full season of other mid-rotation starters  -Zambrano should have a better 2009 than 2008 because he took time off due to back problems which costed him wins  -Lilly has not had less than 15 wins over the past 3 seasons and has improved his record each of those years  -The Cubs have options for the fifth spot including young pitchers Marshall (3.86 ERA last year) and Samardzija (2.28 ERA last year) and veterans Gaudin and Heilman, at least one of these players will have a solid season  -The possible, but not probably acquisition of Peavy would make this rotation even better    While other rotations have a better ace or better top half of the rotation, I don't believe any have the depth that the Cubs have. There are 4 pitchers in the Cubs rotation who could be number 1 starters for many other teams (Zambrano, Lilly-17 wins, Dempster-17 wins, Harden-when healthy), I think that puts them ahead of any other rotation in baseball.|`|DkwgogXZaa	the yankees|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	Its the yankees, C.C, A,J, Wang, Petite, Joba.  All those pitchers are capable of 10 plus wins.|`|io3hggzZaa	i hate the team but i would have to say the yankees. they have everyone.|`|gvWLgYx4aa	Florida Marlins.    Ricky Nolasco was a stud last year and will continue it this year.  Josh Johnson is going to be in the running for the ERA title.  Chris Volstad is just amazing  Andrew Miller has the potential to be one of the best pitchers for a while. 2009 is going to be his year.  and if Anibal Sanchez can shake off the rust he had last year after coming back from shoulder surgery, he will be a 15+ winner.    make fun all you want about the Marlins, but I'm telling you watch out in '09. We have a team that can match up pitch for pitch and hit for hit against any other team in MLB.|`|8skV9ze9aa	The Yankees definitely have the most big names but their rotation is full of question marks and injury risks.     Sabathia - fat players get really bad really fast around his age, and his workload over the last two years has been higher than anyone else's.  Burnett - only pitched two full seasons in his career, and the other 8 have been cut short by injury  Wang - Good pitcher but way overrated, doesn't do much else besides collect wins and pitch just well enough to have his offense score 5-6 runs for the win  Pettitte - will be 37 years old  Joba - has shown endurance issues, though he will be fantastic come '10 or '11 once he gets some experience    And let me get something straight here - pitcher's wins are completely dependent on their team's offense. A mediocre pitcher with a big offense behind him could win 15 games. Better measurements are ERA and WHIP (hits and walks allowed per inning) since they're more reflective of the pitcher's individual performance.    I think the best rotation in baseball will be the Rays.   James Shields - walks almost no one and does everything very, very well. The most underrated pitcher in baseball  Scott Kazmir - when not injured, he's one of the top 10 pitchers in the MLB, hands down. He'll be 25, only one year older than Lincecum with a similar skill set  David Price - best young pitcher in the game, think the lefty Lincecum but with a bit less K's. Probably won't reach that in '09 but he has massive talent  Matt Garza - would be a  2 on any other staff  Andy Sonnanstine - the only question mark here is now only in his second full season. He dominated the minors in his first couple pro seasons and has shown flashes of brilliance in '08. Has potential to be almost as good as Shields all-around|`|wKXUfedMaa	Yankees    CC Sabathia  AJ Burnette  Chien Ming Wang  Joba Chamberlain  Andy Pettitte    with also lots of prospects and spot fillers like Chase Wright, Aceves, and of course Phil Hughes/ Ian Kennedy|`|m9Hmb93Uaa	even though i ahte them probably the yankees but the red sox are a close second|`|4cJuKxJbaa	The  1 Rotation in baseball is the Cubs...yea I said it, a Yankee Fan.

They are still overrated. The team is a complete team and starting pitching will perform better if there are supports coming from teamates. They are not bad but I doubt they will do the same this year.    People said they choked in last year's post season. 2003 post-season was the year they chocked. Last year they got out-pitched, they will be the same again this year. Yankees has the best rotation, RedSox is the second and then Cubs and Mets is close behind.|`|iz5zDFxvaa	The Jays rotation had the best ERA in baseball last year, but that is likely to change with the losses of Burnett (signed with Yankees) and Marcum (out with injury until 2010).    The Cubs rotation had the 2nd best ERA, but they just traded their  4 starter to the Rockies. Unless they trade for Peavy, who's going to replace the 11 wins of Jason Marquis?    The Brewers rotation had the 3rd best ERA, but they just lost Sabathia to the Yankees and are on the verge of losing Sheets.    The Dodgers rotation had the 4th best ERA, but they lost both Lowe and Penny.    The D-backs rotation had the 5th best ERA, but they lost 9 game winner Big Unit. They did find his replacement though in Jon Garland, who won 14 games last year.    Looks to me like the D-backs will have the better rotation, unless some changes for the other 29 teams come forth and/or if the top pitchers who just signed with their new teams pan out well.

qUQnsqnsaa	JBL should be....? <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Well, first he should win the World Heavyweight Championship. Then, I see him becoming the new GM of RAW. JBL would make an awesome match-ups face or heel, he's a great man even though you people don't see that in him and niether do I. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Let's face it: JBL is a fat, nobody, disgrace to the WWE Title. But, he is the longest reigning Champion in SD! history and he'd make a damn good GM of Monday Night's RAW IS WAR!|`|hVqGuOOPaa	I disagree with you. I think that JBL should be retired or better yet fired! I don't think he really needs to be in the WWE. He isn't meant to be this popular just because he is buying himself into popularity. He should really be fired or retired or whatever.|`|IMu3wBu8aa	GM of Raw. I would love to see him WHC, but I have a feeling I'm the only one. He would make a great GM.

IITnJjAjaa	Fartlek is the best training drill. Whether it's an 8 mile long fartlek or a continuous one round a track - it is so beneficial for in races for surges and keeping up with people surging in a race.<br>  <br>  Hill reps, circuit training, interval training are also just as beneficial<br>  <br>  As for exercises, crunches/sit-ups are good for strengthening the trunk, press ups for the arm muscles to drive you forward, squats are great for the thigh muscles along with exercise bands which help strengthen these muscles. <br>  <br>  I wish you look and i hope you break 40 minutes!!|`|FdqCnU03aa	O.O I'm a girl, who can run faster~!! woot woot! xDD<br>  lol sorry I just had to do that little celebration thingy, no offense. I'm in varsity crosscountry/track, you see, so I really shouldn't be comparing. D: xDD<br>  <br>  Okaaay to get serious --<br>  <br>  The squats and lunges aren't really gonna help. Just go running outside around the blocks and bring a stopwatch. Maybe listen to some music as you run.<br>  <br>  Try to discipline yourself by making yourself run faster. Beat your old running times (as in minutes/etc.) every day, if you can. <br>  <br>  But whatever you do, don't stop. It's not only bad for your endurance training, it's also bad for your muscles. It slows you down more than it might help -- even if you get a "rest", your muscles revert back to a less active mode. If you have to slow down to rest, just slow down to a [slower] JOG, not a walk, because even slowing to a fast walk isn't going to help you.<br>  <br>  But don't forget to do a good warmup [stretches, etc.] before you start, and a good cool down [more stretches, slow jog, etc.] afterwards. This will help prevent soreness and injury (and it also helps you run better too!)...<br>  <br>  Oh yeah... and maybe for speed training (besides the timing yourself as you run out on the blocks).. check out the closest open track oval and practice running drills there.|`|4kIUh76Qaa	Honestly, squats and lunges won't do much for your 8k time.  Running 5 miles in under 40 minutes is a pretty good goal to have since 8 minute miles aren't easy to maintain over that distance for the average person.  <br>  <br>  From the sounds of it, you are training "correctly" and if you are really interested in dropping your time, cross train on your non-runing days but stay out of the gym.  Use a stationary bike or hop in the pool for lap swimming.  These things will help increase your overall fitness and better your VO2-max so you'll be able to run harder, longer.  Squats and lunges will make your legs stronger for sure, but that's not really what your looking for when training for a distance race.<br>  <br>  p.s.  I don't mean to contradict what others are saying, but situps and yoga won't do jack for your 8k time.  Breathing IS important, but that's something you focus on during your long runs, not your cross-training days.|`|JI1EpWX6aa	Well you can try sprinting like for 10 yards and every time you feel you can run for more keep on going. I'm a girl and the fastest i've ran the mile is 8:34 seconds usually my average is 9:45 seconds something like that. You can try not eating anything like chips soda lay down on <br>  fats. and try doing push ups there good for the fingers, hands, forearms, biceps, triceps, shoulders, traps, upper back, lower back, abs, glutes, hamstrings, quads, calf,and the feet. But only if you do them right.|`|4oeBAHANaa	sit ups,,, alot of running is your breathing, and yoga will help with that too, because it practices good breathing skills.|`|vXkPUOWdaa	do wind sprints they work for me not uch during the week or ur body cant rest|`|yzsp3hgoaa	i would recomend doing endurance drills<br>  Like you run without stopping for about 30 to 45 minutes full speed. (or do full cardio a ton!) <br>  Depending on how long you need to do this until you feel like your going to pass out. lol<br>  You should run full speed for about 20-50 minutes depending on your health.<br>  This should help you increase your endurance rate so you wont feel tired as fast so you can keep running and not waste time catching your breath.<br>  <br>              Another thing you can do is maybe go running ( pretty self explanitory)<br>  Eat good foods (makes you in a healthy position so you dont feel sluggish and heavy when you run)<br>  Make sure you drink lots of water<br>  And continue doing your squats and lounges so you stretch the muscles needed for running. :)<br>  Hope this helped and best of luck|`|Qtp2CxaQaa	need need push ups. your arms will carry you alot during the race. you need need NEED sit ups and crunches. your abs will be the first thing to go in the race if not. obviously  you need to run.<br>  run 5 days a week these next four weeks(you do everything yous say, depending on age, you could possibly get under 36 mins i run the 5k in under 17 so) . mon- a medium run, maybe 2 miles shorter than your race. it is your freshest day and will want to ran farther but you will need it on another day. Tues- tues is your long run day, run 2-3 miles further than your race. give yourself a water stop halfway then continue. no longer than 2 min break. wed- short day, run 2 miles. stretch a ton today. thursday- do sprints and short distance. this is needed. trust me fri- another normal day.<br>  <br>  the week before your race relax. run 3 normal runs. stretch and hydrate constantly. make sure your shoes show little wear.<br>  <br>  before the race, find a song you really like that has a decent beat. even just a jog beat...boom boom boom...and get this song in ur head during the race and match your feet to it...<br>  <br>  <br>  your goal is good<br>  i've done this same routine except my long days are 13 miles and well as i said, 3 mile Pr: 15:50 1 mile: 4:42<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck =D

Squat in your catchers stance, with ball in your glove and popup and throw to a net setup where second base would be. Or set up a net that is 100- 200 feet away and practice long tossing to increase arm strength. Also practice squatting all the time to build up leg strength. You should also go through the motions of blocking balls and diving for them. Try practicing some popups by throwing the ball straight up in the air in full gear and catching it. Good luck, and practice hard.

qyATAaeXaa	You need spelling lessons....that's what you need.<br>  <br>  Climbing rope is not cheap. That's the deal. It's expensive because it will save your stupid butt when you fall. That's why people take very good care of their ropes. Judging by the lack of attention to detail you give to your spelling and grammar, I wouldn't trust you to take good care of my ropes.|`|SBBnWsJJaa	NEVER buy a used rope or accept a used rope that you don't know the history of.  This is the single most important piece of climbing equipment you will own and it is well worth the investment.<br>  <br>  I think that you are probably a young person, based on your other question...consider joining a local Scout group.  Your local council may have a climbing program that you could participate in.<br>  <br>  Oh...and there's a spell checker available...it might help with communication if you use it.|`|Enzrj1hKaa	I've read the other answers - but you can't really call them answers because they all go on about not buying cheap rope and your poor spelling (which isn't actually that bad).<br>  <br>  Just type 'cheap climbing rope' in google or any other search engine and you should find something.  I suspect you're in America, but if you are in Britain I recently got a good, cheap one from Ultimate Outdoors.  Brands such as Mammut have some fairly cheap but basic ropes|`|ICsOPpszaa	I have purchased a couple of very nice ropes (PMI, etc) for less than $100 from this web site but they usually only have them in the summer<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sierratradingpost.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sierratradingpost.com/</a><br>  <br>  Also watch for sales here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mountaingear.com/pages/product/product.asp/imanf/Beal/idesc/Edlinger+10%2E2mm+x+60m+Rope+%2D+Standard/Store/MG/item/101381/N/0" rel="nofollow">http://www.mountaingear.com/pages/produc...</a><br>  <br>  And NEVER buy a used rope unless it is from someone you already trust with your life (like a climbing partner)<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|mMFJrPbvaa	I think your money will be better spent on Hooked on Phonics, there's a spell checker available before you post.  Anyway, if the rope is too expensive for you start where many young people start, bouldering.  Its a heck of a lot cheaper.  <br>  <br>  Or as someone else suggested join a scout troop and go to a summer camp where they have a climbing program.  <br>  <br>  Like Willie said, I wouldn't let you use my rope.  If you abuse your spelling and grammar this much I`d hate to see the gear you would use.

Some like mine will do both but I work with my fighters who actually get in the ring personally in kickboxing.  Teaching, coaching and working with them personally is what it takes rather than they just be in some kickboxing class with 15-20 other people who have no interest or business getting into the ring.  Such a school can get you plugged into fighting and getting into the ring and they usually get calls from promoters looking for fighters for upcoming cards and matches as well as look for them for their own fighters to gain valuable experience from.

Steelers vs. 49ers  Bills vs. Eagles  Patriots vs. Saints  Ravens vs. Lions  Giants vs. Chiefs    If I had to pick one, I'd go with the Pittsburgh/San Francisco, though of course none of the unlikely teams are likely contenders... but there's always an unlikely contender.|`|fHxpycJSaa	It will be the best ever, and the greatest play ever will happen during the game.|`|QIWvbNFWaa	Vikings vs Patriots    12-4 Viking is getting a better qb this year    Patriots 13-3 will get Brady back|`|OUKKNF1eaa	al davis i hope you are reading this, but you and your raiders buddy.|`|9Zbh8HZxaa	COLTS vs GIANTS   BOTH ELI AND PEYTON IN A S.B.

wYE0ta3Laa	Usually they will tell you what they expect you to wear, but a safe bet is any sort of athletic pair of shorts (Soffe is a standard) and any sort of t-shirt you can movie around in. Make sure you wear a sports bra and athletic shoes. <br>  <br>  On the tryout day itself, they will probably tell you exactly what to wear (in my experience, it's usually been a pair of black shorts and a plain white tshirt, and sometimes they want you to wear school colors) But if you're unsure, go ahead and ask the coach what she wants you to wear, she'll probably like that you're taking the initiative to ask. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|ZptH0DUxaa	Anything that is easy to move around in, but doesn't have pockets and such.

iHY0LhQwaa	well dude something you gotta remember is that big guys have all the same weaknesses as regular people. there isn't any more muscle on his groin or nose than there is on yours. also something most people forget is how easy it is to straight up pop somebody in the throat. but to fight this guy i would say you should wait for him to throw a punch ( you have got to be ready to slap it out of the way) and when you knock it out of the way kick him in the groin and then punch him in the skull or even better drop an elbow on the back of his head. and if he grabs onto you dig your thumb into his eye. big guys have eyes too. but that's just how i would fight him.|`|i0KeBgHzaa	The nexttime he starts to mess with you walk up and punch him in the jaw as hard as you can even if he fights back and even if you lose the fight he will realize that you arent gonna take his crap and that your gonna put up a fight he will then find someone else to mess with that isnt as much trouble. trust me most of those bullys are big whimps when it comes to taking one in the face there more talk than they are walk. a guy tryed that crap with me my freshman year and just nailed him as hard as i could not only did he not mess with at all after that but the rest of the older guys saw that i wasent gonna take there crap and i became fiends with several of them. if you just stand back and take it will continue and most likely get worse as time goes on. good luck|`|HHvZ6HFYaa	usually bullies won't attack you for no reason, so don't give them one. Basically this means don't give lip to them if you can't back it up. If he does attack you for no reason i wouldn't advise fighting if you have no experience eg karate. The best thing to do would be not to fight back, they usually won't do anything more than push you if you don't fight back and let's face it a push is better than a broken nose.<br>  <br>  if he is full out attacking you for no reason at all I would definetly recommened karate, bullies is the most popular reason for learning karate. It gives you self confidence aswell as protection. Just look at my sensei, the reaosn he started karate was because of a bully and now he can beat three guys who tried to mug him with knives easily.<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|c0MGzGVoaa	what i would do is take up brazilian jiu jitsu, in bjj it does not matter how strong the other guy is, its all about leverage and technique, royce gracie a master of brazilian jiu jitsu would take on opponents much bigger than himself.

If confrontation is completely necessary... you may have speed as an advantage (although he does play football and probably physically trains on a daily basis). <br>  <br>  If you have to strike... strike hard and fast and then get out of the situation.|`|NJMzhcKhaa	There are several steps to try<br>  <br>  1. Call his coach/headmaster and report the problem, tell them that the guy has been bullying you.<br>  If this doesn't work, go to step 2<br>  <br>  2. Threaten him that you will ask you mum to go to school and report him to the headmaster.<br>  If this doesn't work, go to step 3<br>  <br>  3. Fight him anyway. Human weakness lies nearly all in the center line. Nose, Chin, Solar Plexus and groin. Even if you lose, he might have a respect for you if you fight back and while you might get banged up, you might also gain respect of the person and your other schoolmates.<br>  If this doesn't work, go to step 4.<br>  <br>  4.

t1uKdzmLaa	I agree that the WNBA is entertaining to watch. Unfortunately, because I live in Canada...I barely get to see any WNBA games (that is partly because there are no WNBA teams in Canada). The only time I see a game is when it comes on ABC which is rare where I live. <br>  <br>  Based on the few times I watched the game, the players do play pretty good defense and really do put up a good fight. In addition, the women who play are NOT nappy headed hoes (to the person who made an ignorant remark) and not she males...they are beautiful women who can play a good game.<br>  <br>  I already know why many people don't respect the WNBA as much; it is because women's rights aren't always taken seriously within our society anyhow...and women's issues are often placed to the margins. I think it will take a long way for the WNBA to get the recognition it deserves...but it is possible.<br>  <br>  P.S. I know I will get thumbs down...but normally, people who have differing views from the majority often get burned by the majority.|`|jTqsOwhhaa	sorry everything u say about males and the nba is wrong<br>  its not a dunk fest if u had eyes no offense its because of the amazing plays that players are able to get that open and because of male athletic ability. and if u watched some good teams play for important wins, u would witness the amazing defense and concentration<br>  <br>  yea so u got it all wrong|`|7H9gHQA8aa	THE WNBA SUCKS ***!!!!!!!!!!

People dont watch the WNBA becasue they are chauvinisit male pigs they dont watch it becasue its boring. Why would i watch players who are way less athletic when i can watch people who are 5'9 dunk over people who are 6'11 i mean its alot more impressive then someone making a layup witch is usally the highlight of the game for a WNBA game. I mean think about its a huge story that Candice parker can dunk. is it a big story when someone in the NBA does a dunk alone with no defense and no moves(such as windmill etc.).Dont be mad becasue nobody watchs the extreamly boring WNBA games and just enjoy it yourself, but it sounds like you only like it becasue other people hate it (the WNBA). you say the only good thing to come out of the nba is jordan( which is extreamly wrong) if you wanna say that i can name about 10,000 players that came out of the nba who are bigger than the wnba's biggest player ever.

He doesn't need a baby sitter in the form of a coach, because he knows what his routine is, instead he needs a tactician who  could help him out in dealing with lefties especially if the clay season is coming up.

nsUmCSQAaa	If you are just practicing at home then I would suggest that you put you hockey gloves on an make some targets to shoot at.  It it best to shoot at something in front of a wall so if you miss you can retrieve the ball/puck.<br>  <br>  If you have a hockey net the I would suggest buying some cheap foam targets from Canadian tire or setting pop bottles in the corners and hanging down in the upper mesh. If you do not have a net the use some chalk or make some paper targets to put up on a wall to shoot at.  (remember that when you shoot to follow through and point at you target). As you work on your accuracy remember to try and take harder shots as well.<br>  If you get the chance or know anyone who plays goalie, get them to come to your house with there street hockey equiptment and practice trying to score on them by deking and using your practiced accuracy by shooting where the goalie leaves an open spot.  (trust your hands and feel the puck when shooting to try and keep your head up).|`|aQQYEZNAaa	Take it from a Canadian. The best practice you can get is to strap on your skates(or what ever footwear is required for the surface you are playing on) and just have at it. Everyone plays a different style of hockey and it's best for you to discover your unique style so you can develop it.<br>  <br>  The only suggestion I have is maybe set up some targets for you to hit or maybe have a friend play goalie.|`|zbCh3Lxpaa	<a href="http://sports12.weebly.com" rel="nofollow">http://sports12.weebly.com</a><br>  <br>  this website has every game playing in NHL all the time and is pretty well updated.

I mean really- I think the  Edmonton players (four of them) more than took care of anything that Ott did wrong.<br>  <br>  That game was very chippy on both sides of the puck.  So I don't really think either team has any reason to complain.  It was a tough game physically.  The number of hits must have be insanely high, but that is a typical Stars/Edmonton game.  If you go and watch their match-ups and expect anything less then you don't know the history between these two teams.|`|yererDcnaa	theres plenty of times ive thought ott should have gotten suspsended for some of the things he does as a so called "agitator," but to me hes just a little girl. theres nothing else that puts me in a better mood than to watch ott get pounded on various youtube videos. my faves are the beatings he recieved by joe thornton and craig rivet.<br>  <br>  so i doubt he will get suspended for this ever though it was cheap. but i am sure pay back will be coming his way very soon. players dont forget about these type of incidents|`|Jf8LiEw2aa	I don't think he'll be suspended, but he, along with Jordan TooToo of the Preds, should be kicked out of the league along with Sean Avery.|`|zbCh3Lxpaa	<a href="http://sports12.weebly.com" rel="nofollow">http://sports12.weebly.com</a><br>  <br>  this website has every game playing in NHL all the time and is pretty well updated.

UoT86gbiaa	Nnamdi had one of the all-time great seasons for a cornerback this last year and he was truly a shutdown corner, holding the likes of Steve Smith and Brandon Marshall to 2 and 1 receptions, respectively.  There's no question he was far and away the best cornerback in the NFL last season.<br>  <br>  The league has a glut of all-time great safties right now (Polamalu, Reed, Wilson, Sanders to name a few) so it's hard to name the single best of everyone playing in the defensive backfield, but I will say Asomugha certainly earned every dime of that massive new contract he just got.|`|3ba136f81de678dcc8523f842ea96856aa	Defensive back is Bob Sanders, when healthy.

But Asomugha is, IMO, the best pure corner in the game right now.

OOeoFvB6aa	Congratulations! Now you're a skier and you have an excuse to travel with friends and go to wonderful places and meet people from everywhere!  Skiing is such a great sport that way.<br>  <br>  I've been teaching skiing for a few decades and skiers all learn at different rates.  We feel lucky when we get a student who learns as quickly as you did.  Having 4 full days on the snow helped you a lot as you got to practice.  If you are athletic, coordinated, coachable (you listen and try new things) and if you have any history of ice skating/rollerblading, then skiing is going to be easy to learn.<br>  <br>  If you love skiing and think you'll be doing lots of it, then def. get your own skis.  There are great sales in August, you can get last years stuff really cheap.  Also consider buying used, lots of ski shops have back rooms with used equipment.  Boots will be the most important piece of equipment so make sure you get good boots that fit well.<br>  <br>  There is still time left in this season to take another ski weekend you know....|`|SL98InTfaa	I have been skiing for a good 6 years, and I got my first pair this week.<br>  <br>  They are cute.<br>  <br>  Long story short, if you plan to ski a lot, buy skis (especially at the end of the season, because they are much cheaper) because it is cheaper than renting. If you are only going to ski once or twice in a year, just rent. I ski quite frequently. Its good to rent, because you won't out grow them, you know. And bought skis will be just like the ones you rented.<br>  <br>  Everyone learns at a certain pace. I was terrible at skiing to begin with. You are probably quite athletic, right? Its easier for some people then others.|`|nsUmCSQAaa	Everyone learns at there own pace.  If you are athletic or play sports requiring balance this might help you skiing.  Because you are young you are able to pick things up quicker.<br>  <br>  Once you know that you will be skiing often I would recommend getting a good pair of skiis. This way you can avoid waiting at the rental shop and go straight to the lift.<br>  <br>  Ps. Where did you ski at?|`|6U9xbcWBaa	I first skied 2 years ago, and I was a fast learner too.  I am also a snowboarder, so I felt comfortable on the snow to start with.  I am glad you learned so fast.  You can get your own skis when you want, just beware that you won't grow out of them.|`|fJbWRwsmaa	I was skiing blues by the end of my first day of lessons.

dh48AkbCaa	chavez wins in a 15 round war, with both of them showing the signs that they have been through the trenches.|`|CDeZOLmgaa	Pryor hit harder, was more aggressive, was faster had a better chin and boxing ability, The Hawk cuts Chavez up inside 8 rounds.|`|I9Y6fxguaa	Aaron with or without special juices?<br>  I guess we will never know this one cause when he beat Arguello, Aaron was under the influence|`|kqP7GwOcaa	Great fight, but I think Aaron Pryor would have given Chavez all he could handle.  Chavez's chin would keep him in it, but Pryor's chin was better.<br>  <br>  Pryor by close decision in a war.|`|a112fa2d0ccf1099eec1119d4da5e902aa	I agree with you. Pryor is stronger and faster, and he just keeps coming at you with real bad intentions.  Arguello will attest to that.|`|6AfM6SWaaa	Julio Caesar Chavez from Culiacan-it wouldnt go 15 though|`|acaAycEXaa	It all comes down to:<br>  <br>  With or without the 'special bottle' (and Panama Lewis' special wraps too!).
I1w0HfQbaa	Floyd for the hard fought unanimous decision win. Both fighters were wunderkinds and were taking on top level fighters at such a young age. Floyd was in it with Angel Manfredy and Genaro Hernandez and Meldrick was duking it out with Buddy McGirt and Howard Davis Jr. So both fighters were in it with world class level boxers at a fairly young start in their careers. But I think Floyd is the little bit smarter boxer of the two and though does not have quite the handspeed Meldrick has--but then agains who does?--I think he was a better defensive boxer than Meldrick. Even in his losing effort against Chavez Meldrick showed a lot of courage and dented the lion from Culiacan's armor significantly in that fight. <br>  <br>  Taylor should give a good fight and would win four rounds during the course of this fight but Floyd should get the win in what should be his toughest test to date in his career. Floyd for the win by hard fought, unanimous decision.|`|Ghiy6Cwlaa	make a good fight split mayweather|`|ElH6jMEXaa	This would be a tougher version of Floyd's fight with Zab Judah, only Taylor wouldn't gas out.  Mayweather would again be in with a guy who could not only match his speed, but probably had a little more.  Taylor was also skilled with great coaching and background.  <br>  <br>  I think Floyd Mayweather was an extraordinary fighter, but Meldrick Taylor was a combination of all the things that would give him trouble - he was very quick and had the ability to be a good pressure fighter.  He was also willing to take punches in order to land his own, which is what both Oscar and Zab were unwilling to do against Floyd.  <br>  <br>  Floyd would try to be economical with both his punches and movement in general, Taylor would be pushing the pace, and unleashing those rapid fire flurries - early on, most of his shots wouldn't land clean as Floyd is a great defensive fighter, but some would get through, and Meldrick would keep on him unlike Zab, the activity level of Taylor would score.<br>  <br>  Towards the middle I think Floyd would have more success, timing him better, using angles to slow Taylor's attack - but Meldrick was just speed and flash, he had real boxing ability too.  He'd adapt, throw the first punch, take the counter and land his own combinations.<br>  <br>  It would be close down the stretch, but I think Taylor would have it, Mayweather has some power, but his best KOs come after he has taken his toll on his opponents and I think Taylor would have made him work too hard during the fight to allow him to pull something off.<br>  <br>  Stylistically its a horrible matchup for Floyd, Taylor had Oscar's skill, Zab's speed, and Castillo's ability to apply effective pressure.<br>  <br>  Talyor by W12|`|dh48AkbCaa	this one could be a snoozer, or a classic, depending how they approach it.<br>  <br>  meldrick had not yet reached his prime before he fought chavez, so we'll never know how great he could've been if that fight on st patricks day 1990 hadn't taken so much out of him.<br>  <br>  both moved well, and both had very fast hands, but i think that pbf just about edges it here.|`|I9Y6fxguaa	I am with Meldrick Taylor. He was faster and a full 12 round action boxer. never ran away from brawlers like Julio. The biggest heart among boxers. Mledrick by UD.|`|6AfM6SWaaa	Floyyd
lHzBJA4eaa	I think Montreal's problems all start with Price. He was hurt before the Allstar game and Carbonneau said when asked at a press conference that he'd didn't see why Price would want to play in the game under the circumstance . Carbonneau obviously thought it would be stupid for him to risk aggravating his injury and hurting the club just to play in a mean nothing game. Then Price gets peppered at the game and comes back after getting a kick in the confidence ,also he knows what Carbonneau had said I am sure .He really put his self in an awkward position now and is feeling the pressure to perform. The whole teams needs to be able to relax and have confidence in Price but they are having a hard time doing that right now.He should have listen to the coach.|`|axxQzOCHaa	If you are reading << ALLO POLICE >> as your source of news, you don't have a life.|`|RJ5Bevmpaa	Kovalev was talking to the reporters on TSN during the broadcast of their game against Washington, moments after this story was released in the Russian News Papers. He told them specifically that he had nothing to do with the report and that he never said anything to anyone about any of that nonsense.<br>  <br>  It's a fictional story, much like 90% of the stories out of Russia, the French media and the National Enquirer.|`|etErp8rcaa	There's definitely something wrong with this club. They have been awful lately, and to say that heads will roll if they miss the postseason in their centennial year is an understatement. I think they'll move some big names before the deadline in an attempt to right the ship. <br>  <br>  I bet Kovalev goes, and they look for some veteran backup for Price.

CqLjZfkLaa	Your calves are bigger and tighter because they swell with blood because of the aerobic exercise.  Stretch before and after you run to minimize the swell.  It will get better with time.|`|jxizzHL1aa	No you can't stop your body from responding the way it's supposed to unless you stop using that specific muscle.  If you're looking for cardio but don't want to "use" your calves then try biking.  It's practically all thighs.|`|237ab7a90e5b9d51488ea4a1c42d65dcaa	Your legs getting tighter and bigger are just them getting leaner and building muscle.  You can't really prevent that, but it's a sign that your exercise is paying off.|`|phDTu7c1aa	Maybe do 15 minutes of jogging and 15 minutes of walking instead? I walk alot, and it doesn't make my calves big. It's still good exercise.|`|82JPSNwpaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  First of all what you are experiencing is totally normal, during and for a period after exercise your muscles fill with fluid which give them an enlarged appearance. This should not being causing you pain and i would suspect that if you are experiencing pain with these symptoms then it is likely the result of incorrect or lack of stretching.<br>  <br>  Are performing a thorough warm up with stretches and cool down. Remember to hold your cool down stretches for slightly longer than the warm up. This can have a drastic effect upon increasing your recovery time and relieving/preventing DOMS.|`|dxMQAdndaa	Unfortunately, there is not a real way to reduce your calf-size. Running will only build up the muscles. Over time, if you keep running, the muscles that get built up may burn fat that is on your calves and you will just have lean muscle.<br>  <br>  You could always try some sort of other cardio exercise, such as elliptical trainer, swimming, or bicycling.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your goals!|`|fdtHELqcaa	try streching before and after every workout,dat will minimize the tightness i dont know about your calves getting bigger though :/ sorry|`|vXkPUOWdaa	long term it is bad for you|`|8FiJ5i81aa	try sprints not jogs but not really jogging will grow that muscle|`|IITnJjAjaa	The slower you run, the more fat it burns- resulting in smaller legs

jki8W5khaa	ive seen it run past the time that it says on the listing|`|H8u7gMAYaa	I'm pretty sure it ends on the hour. Even if the game takes up most of their time slot, after the game how many minutes is left they will do the post game show than end it at the hr. It usually always ends at 11pm over here on the West...|`|CtLncY3Caa	it runs a full hour so if the game ended @ 1:34 am the show wouldn't go off until 2:34 am <br>  <br>  i hope i helped

LIKkt8djaa	PD and Steve are both wrong, You never choose a board size based on your height alone, That's a silly rookie mistake. You need to take into account your weight,riding style and shoe size. Since you didn't list your weight it's pretty impossible to say whether or not the 149 could work, But If I were to assume you were around a normal persons weight at that height then that 149 is small and would be more of a Freestyle stick for you. Infact if you're even planning on hitting the backcountry or the deep powder stashes then you're going to sink like the titantic.<br>  <br>  As for the board width 9.5 inches is around a 24.1 waist width on a snowboard, With size 10's that's pushing it, you may be fine but if you do have to much overhang chances are you could just duck out your stance and be fine.<br>  <br>  <br>  SNOWBOARDING STYLES EXPLAINED<br>  <br>  Freeride: longer in length, and semi-directional. Moderate to stiff in flex. Used for long, fast turns in various types of snow from groomed hard-pack to soft powder.<br>  <br>  Freestyle: Generally shorter in length with a Semi-directional or twin-tip shape. Moderate to soft in flex. Incorporates a deep sidecut for quick/tight turning. Used in the pipe and in the park on various jumps and terrain features including boxes, rails, and tables.<br>  <br>  All-Mountain: A hybrid between freeride and freestyle boards. The 'jack of all trades, master of none.' Normally directional in shape with either a twin or directional flex. Moderate in flex for various types of terrain.|`|VJ1C5JsYaa	First off PD didn't not come close to being right. At 5'9" the normal board would be around a 155. Ranged normally between a 154-160(but its Personal choice). Also a smaller board goes slower then a longer board but it is easier to control. Lastly the only factor on if you need a wide board or not is your boot size compared to the width of your board. Longer boards are naturally wider so if you have a long board you might not need a wide board.<br>  <br>  Secondly since the board is smaller then your ideal size you might have overhang. That depends on your boots and board. If your board is not a wide and a normal you might have overhang. The only way to tell for sure is to put the boot into the binding on the board and look at it. Hell if you can do that but are still not sure take a picture and post that and ask again.|`|nUbtxn6eaa	At 5'9", you need a board between 158 and 164.  You can always ride a smaller board however.  It will go faster, but will be easier to control.  You need a wide board if your boots are larger than size 11, so the width should be fine.<br>  <br>  Overall, although the board is not perfect for you, you will be fine.|`|mGTeNxpJaa	Yep II agree w/ Steve 100% in regards to sizing. Also keep in mind that with your height and weight, you will have limited speed for descents. I know it's common for riders to use smaller boards for jibbing but why limit yourself? RIDE EVERYTHING!<br>  <br>  I would suggest maybe post on your homies, local craigslist and or forums to see if you may be able to sell or trade someone decks. Or just be a sweetie and give your sweetie yours and buy one that fits you. hehe.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps ;)|`|m8Qqbfnzaa	im a park kid, my focus on the mountain is jus jibbing all day.  i am 5'10 and ride a 148.  it comes down to if u are goin to be focusing on the rails and **** alot. if u want a park board, id range u between 149-153 andthing else will be good as well, but mainly for trail riding. as for the bindings and boots dilehma. it really should be fine.|`|wvJmLgKxaa	That seems alright, it should be just fine. <br>  <br>  You can put the boot in the bindings and see if there is any toe overhang but you should be all good with just a size 10
ahgsxYsFaa	No, I use Dr. Scholl's Gel inserts and find that these really help prevent me from getting sore on the soles of my feet<br>  These cost around $10 or so.<br>  I wouldn't pay extra for a shoe that had some internal "suspension method".|`|Z446YQ10aa	yes. if i where to design a golf shoe it would be fashionable at the same time comfortable.just like a low cut rubber shoe. it would be a great idea to add suspension to the shoe.
