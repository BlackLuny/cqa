AA11719394	Who is God? - The Fact<br>  The fact of God’s existence is so conspicuous, through creation and through man’s conscience, that the Bible calls the atheist a “fool” (Psalm 14:1). Accordingly, the Bible never attempts to prove the existence of God; rather, it assumes His existence from the very beginning (Genesis 1:1). What the Bible does is reveal the nature, character, and work of God.<br>  <br>  Who is God? - The Definition<br>  Thinking correctly about God is of utmost importance because a false idea about God is tantamount to idolatry. In Psalm 50:21, God reproves the wicked man with this accusation: “you thought I was altogether like you.” To start with, a good summary definition of God is “the Supreme Being; the Creator and Ruler of all that is; the Self-existent One who is perfect in power, goodness, and wisdom.”<br>  <br>  Who is God? - His Nature<br>  We know certain things to be true of God for one reason: in His mercy He has condescended to reveal some of His qualities to us. God is spirit, by nature intangible (John 4:24). God is One, but He exists as Three Persons—God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit (Matthew 3:16-17). God is infinite (1 Timothy 1:17), incomparable (2 Samuel 7:22), and unchanging (Malachi 3:6). God exists everywhere (Psalm 139:7-12), knows everything (Matthew 11:21), and has all power and authority (Ephesians 1; Revelation 19:6).<br>  <br>  Who is God? - His Character<br>  Here is some of what the Bible reveals: God is just (Acts 17:31), loving (Ephesians 2:4-5), truthful (John 14:6), and holy (1 John 1:5). God shows compassion (2 Corinthians 1:3), mercy (Romans 9:15), and grace (Romans 5:17). God judges sin (Psalm 5:5) but also offers forgiveness (Psalm 130:4).<br>  <br>  Who is God? - His Work<br>  We cannot understand God apart from His works, because what God does flows from who He is. Here is an abbreviated list of God’s works, past, present, and future: God created the world (Isaiah 42:5); He actively sustains the world (Colossians 1:17); He is executing His eternal plan (Ephesians 1:11) which involves the redemption of man from the curse of sin and death (Galatians 3:13-14); He draws people to Christ (John 6:44); He disciplines His children (Hebrews 12:6); and He will judge the world (Revelation 20:11-15).<br>  <br>  Who is God? - A Relationship with Him<br>  In the Person of the Son, God became incarnate (John 1:14). The Son of God became the Son of Man and is therefore the “bridge” between God and man (John 14:6; 1 Timothy 2:5). It is only through the Son that we can have forgiveness of sins (Ephesians 1:7), reconciliation with God (John 15:15; Romans 5:10), and eternal salvation (2 Timothy 2:10). In Jesus Christ “all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form” (Colossians 2:9). So, to really know who God is, all we have to do is look at Jesus.|`|AQBow7Glaa	Some absolute concepts like these can only be defined in terms of what they are not.<br>  <br>  We all have experience of finite things.  Infinity is that which is not finite.<br>  <br>  We all have experience of things that are limited in time, power, knowledge and authority.

Therefore, the most intelligent, rational thing to do would be to seek out and to join the original church that Jesus founded:  the Holy Roman Catholic Church....it can date itself back to AD 33 -- can your Protestant sect (not all of the denominations have achieved the status of church which must meet certain criteria in order to be called a Christian church, such as belief in the Trinity) claim/prove its foundation goes back that far?<br>  <br>  Almost all Protestant groups were founded in 1517 and later and thus are not apostolic in origin.<br>  <br>  True, the word Catholic is not in Scripture -- but read the Fathers of the Church...Origen, Polycarp, Augustin, Justin, Jerome, Irenaeus, etc.  Their belief systems were the same as today's Roman Catholics....Jesus' Real Presence in the Eucharist, Purgatory (even Jews believe in it!), auricular confession, invocation of the saints, devotion (never worship) to Mary, etc.  <br>  <br>  ~ An informed Catholic|`|5ljN0M2Caa	There is only one truth.

Vergleichbar ist das mit der Skulpturenzerschlagung Abrahams in der G?tzenmanufaktur seines Vaters (2) und dem Bildersturm der Reformatoren Calvin, Karlstadt, Müntzer und Zwingli.(3)<br>  <br>  In der Grundannahme sind sich also die drei Religion des einen Gottes vollkommen einig: Gott ist eins, Gott ist nicht von dieser Welt und deswegen nicht erfassbar und abbildbar. Kein Bild, das Menschen anfertigen k?nnen, wird Gott gerecht.<br>  <br>  Die Wuchern der Abbildungen heute bedarf also eigentlich nicht nur nach dem Koran einer Eind?mmung. In s?kularen Nationen haben die Kirchen einfach nicht mehr den notwendigen Einfluss.

Weil das G?ttliche zwar Manifestationen seines selbst hervorbringt, die dargestellt und mit Sinnen erfahren werden k?nnen, aber als K?rper, Geist, Ding, Gedanke oder Wesen nicht existiert. <br>  Wer die Suche nach Gott über Bildliches und "Vorstellbares" betreibt, versucht "ihn" Kraft seines Verstandes und Inellektes zu finden. Ein Weg, der ganz einfach niemals zum Ziel führt. Gott offenbart sich in Abwesenheit intellektueller Anstrengungen in jeder noch so kleinen, aber bewussten Handbewegung, in jedem intensiv gelebten Atemzug, aber nicht beim Nachdenken und nicht beim Beten und Betteln, nicht beim daran Glauben und nicht in frommer und roboterhafter Befolgung von Ritualen, sondern bei v?lliger Wachheit und Bewussheit. Gott ist so gnadenlos einfach zu finden, eigentlich das Leichteste überhaupt - wie die Brille auf der Nase, aber wir ziehen Religions-Kulte und Brimborium auf und laufen dabei mit der Kirche ums Dorf und weg von Gott.<br>  Der Islam, wie das Christentum, haben diesen Umstand absolut richtig verstanden, aber die Botschaft wurde und wird von Priestern und Kirchenfürsten anders  - für Gottessucher unverst?ndlich - ausgelegt.<br>  Offengestanden, ich weiss nicht, ob im Islam die Darstellung Allahs mit dem physischen Tod bestraft wird. Wenn es so w?re, ist das sicher mehr als übertrieben - aber, wie gesagt, der Kern des "Verbotes" ist richtig, es will den Sucher davor schützen, sich Gott intellektuell zu n?hern.|`|be7b5d366669fe508f39277d5aa24fe1aa	sollte bei den cristen auch eingeführt werden.

Satan is a *Christian* concept. Atheists and Satanists are nothing to do with each other.<br>  <br>  Atheistic Satanism is simply a form of Satanism that sees Satan as an ideal, not a literal being.

To be honest, I think the people doing all the judging are the ones the least secure with who they are. That goes for every race. When you think about it, there is no logic reason for anyone to hate someone else for the color of their skin, it's what's inside people that make them act the way they do. <br>  <br>  The truth is though, I don't think we will ever be free from racial issues because there will always be people who are "afraid" or "uncomfortable" with anyone or anything different from themselves, and that goes for all races.

We're so engrossed in having the best home, yet there are loads of people living in cardboard shacks everywhere in the world!<br>  <br>  I think that that would be a huge fundamental start to getting rid of racial issues and not only that but getting rid of many of the world problems we face and are pulling our world down the drain!|`|tdulyzXXaa	This is a very complex issue and not something that people can easily "get past".

Eclesiástes 6:12"   Alguns usam textos bíblicos que falam assim: quem n?o nascer da água e do Espírito n?o entrará no reino dos ceus. Mas Jesus está se referindo ao Batismo quando diz nascer da água, batismo por imers?o igual ao de Jesus, que significa que está sepultando o velho homem e a velha vida e renascendo para uma nova vida, e nascer do Espírito é deixar que o Espírito Santo guie a sua vida, como Paulo disse: agora já n?o sou eu quem vivo é Cristo que vive em mim. Em Mateus 5:17 "Pelo que, se alguém está em Cristo, nova criatura é; as coisas velhas já passaram; eis que tudo se fez novo."<br>  A verdade é que existe ressurei??o, isto sim, é o que diz lá em  I Tessalonicenses 4:16 a 17 " Porque, se cremos que Jesus morreu e ressurgiu, assim também aos que dormem, Deus, mediante Jesus, os tornará a trazer juntamente com ele. <br>  15 Dizemo-vos, pois, isto pela palavra do Senhor: que nós, os que ficarmos vivos para a vinda do Senhor, de modo algum precederemos os que já dormem. <br>  16 Porque o Senhor mesmo descerá do céu com grande brado, à voz do arcanjo, ao som da trombeta de Deus, e os que morreram em Cristo ressuscitar?o primeiro. <br>  17 Depois nós, os que ficarmos vivos seremos arrebatados juntamente com eles, nas nuvens, ao encontro do Senhor nos ares, e assim estaremos para sempre com o Senhor".<br>  <br>  N?o confunda ressurei??o com reencarna??o. Ressurei??o é Biblico e reencarna??o é uma mentira do diabo que infelizmente muito acreditam.|`|cb6873f9bb07f1f80f56ef94da68b7b5aa	N?o. (LEIA Romanos 6:7; Eclesiastes 9:5,6,10)|`|d7cd85bdb88b825f25f29408b4dbde12aa	A bíblia n?o ensina nem mesmo vida após a morte.<br>  a Bíblia diz: “A alma que pecar — ela é que morrerá.” (Ezequiel 18:4)<br>  <br>  'Muitos têm ensinado isso, até mesmo dizendo que a morte é uma passagem para uma outra vida. Mas, essa idéia n?o se origina da Bíblia. Em vez disso, a Palavra de Deus ensina que você é uma alma, que a sua alma é realmente você, com todas as suas faculdades físicas e mentais. (Gênesis 2:7; Jeremias 2:34; Provérbios 2:10)Em parte alguma a Bíblia ensina que o homem tem uma alma imortal que sobrevive à morte do corpo. <br>  A unica esperan?a que podemos ter é a da ressurrei??o, esta sim é descrita na bíblai como sendo real.<br>  Um bom exemplo é o de  Lázaro, amigo de Jesus, quando ele morreu descrito aqui em Jo?o 11:11-44. <br>  Lázaro nada falou sobre estar num céu de bem-aventuran?as ou num inferno de tormentos, o que ele certamente teria feito, caso tivesse estado num lugar desses. Sim, Lázaro estava totalmente inconsciente na morte, e teria permanecido assim até 'a ressurrei??o no último dia', se Jesus n?o o tivesse trazido de volta à vida. <br>  Contudo, 1.900 anos atrás ele deu provas de que, com o poder de Deus, os mortos podem realmente voltar a viver.<br>  Professor Oscar Cullmann, protestante francês. <br>  Ele escreveu no seu livro Immortalité de l’ame ou Résurrection des morts? (Imortalidade da Alma ou Ressurrei??o dos Mortos?): “Há uma diferen?a enorme entre a expectativa crist? da ressurrei??o dos mortos e a cren?a grega na imortalidade da alma. . . . Embora o cristianismo mais tarde conciliasse essas duas cren?as e hoje o crist?o mediano confunda-as completamente, n?o vejo motivo para se ocultar o que eu e a maioria dos eruditos consideramos ser a verdade. . . . A vida e o teor do Novo Testamento est?o totalmente dominados pela fé na ressurrei??o. . . . O homem inteiro que está realmente morto é trazido de volta à vida por um novo ato criativo de Deus.”<br>  A ressurrei??o fará com que as pessoas se reencontrem com seus familiares queridos<br>  <br>  <br>  No libro O que a bíblia realmente ensina, você vai encontrar o que a bíblia diz a resepeito de morte ent?o poderá entender muitas coisas.

"was Sünde ist". Die mir eing?ngiste ist das Sünde Zielverfehlung ist und Gottesferne nach sich zieht. Darum gibt es das Prinzip Sündenvergebung durch Jesus Tod am Kreuz. Durch seine Vergebung wird die Gottesferne wieder aufgehoben. Das Thema Zeitschiene ist zumindest biblisch auch kein Thema wo man Kopfschmerzen drüber kriegen muss. Wenn man davon ausgeht das Jesus uns gekannt hat bevor die Welt geschaffen war und 1000Jahre wie ein Tag sind, dann dürfte das Thema sich auf der Zeitschiene zu bewegen kein Thema sein. Die Sündenvergebung hat den Aspekt das wir in Gemeinschaft mit Gott eintreten k?nnen. Da Gott in seinem Wesen heilig ist kann er keine Gemeinschaft mit Sünde haben durch Jesus ist dieses aufgehoben, so wir denn nach Vergebung verlangen. Diese Antwort ist eine christliche Auslegung basierend auf dem neuen Testament.|`|VR8eodILaa	Das sind ja viele Fragen auf einmal!<br>  <br>  In der Bibel steht dass nur der ewiges Leben hat(kommt in den Himmel), der an Jesus, den Sohn Gottes glaubt.

Auf die reine idee an sich würde ich schon nie im leben kommen. Ausserdem würde ich meine sünden auch gerne behalten. Da sollen schon ordentlich und wie geplant , an der himmelspforte die guten taten gegen die sünden aufgewogen werden. Sonst k?men ja wirklich hinz und kunz in den himmel.

Vergessen Sie New York - Edinburgh ist die Stadt, in der man vom 29. Dezember bis zum 1. Januar feiern muss!<br>  Der Begriff “Hogmanay” kommt, wie Vieles, aus dem G?lischen oge maidne. Es hei?t soviel wie “neues Morgengrauen”. Die Ursprünge finden sich in dem heidnischen Fest der Wintersonnenwende. Hierbei wurden die H?user gründlich gereinigt, alle ausstehenden Schulden beglichen (eine wirklich sehr nette Sitte!) und alle Streitigkeiten unter den Teppich gekehrt. Noch heute ist es Sitte, dass die Nachbarn sich nach den Glockenschl?gen um Mitternacht auf der Stra?e treffen ,sich umarmen und mit den besten Wünschen weiter feiern bis zum 2. Januar, der in Schottland noch Feiertag ist.<br>  <br>  In Edinburgh ist die Royal Bank Street Party die meistbesuchte Silvesterparty.<br>  <br>  Traditionell wird an Hogmanay Shortbread gegessen.<br>  <br>  (noch ne frage ? )|`|963664939076c939bb0f8647bb8609ccaa	sparsam|`|71406cd0792c7f23911a530756539d69aa	mit fremden Zündkerzen!|`|bd1f2b42b8b823bd826b7b388e6b188faa	Er l??t sich einladen, bringt das Konfetti mit, was er letztes Jahr von der Stra?e aufgelesen hat, hat den ganzen Tag Kohl gegessen, damit er abends sch?n Bl?hungen hat und auch schie?en kann.|`|d1e9dff5a7abf1decaacfeac567c5d33aa	Hogmanay in Edinburgh - das Fest aller Feste!

ctOge9SLaa	Amen.<br>  This is a really awesome verse. I am glad that it is one that you have been considering.  May the Lord continue to bless your seeking heart.<br>  <br>  To enter into the Kingdom of the heavens, we need two things sister. First we need to call upon the Name of the Lord, and second, we need to do the will of our heavenly Father.<br>  <br>  To call on the Lord suffices for us to be saved.<br>  Rom 10:13<br>  " For whoever calls upon the Name of the Lord shall be saved"<br>  <br>  But, to enter into the Kingdom of the heavens, we also need to do the will of the heavenly Father.  Hence sister, not everyone who says" Lord Lord" will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but those who call on the Lord AND do the will of the heavenly Father will enter in.<br>  <br>  For this reason we are encouraged in Romans 12:2 to KNOW the Will of God.<br>  " And do not be fashioned according to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind, that you may know what the will of God is, that which is good and well pleasing and perfect"<br>  <br>  The Kingdom of the heavens has everything to do with our hearts.  The Lord as the Seed of this Kingdom is planted into the good soil of our hearts.  His desire is that we not only have Him planted in us, but also that we give Him the kind of ground in our hearts to grow and spread. To give the roots a free way to go deep into our hearts, making us those who are solid in God, seeking Him daily in the Word, to have all the oldness in our minds renewed. Its the renewed mind that is clear and able to know what God's will is. His Will is revealed to us in His word, if we would be those coming to Him, in the Word each day, He will be faithful to reveal His will to us.  <br>  <br>  The Kingdom of all about God being to rule us inwardly.  Where we are touched with His feelings about everything in our lives.  The more we are renewed by reading the word, by calling on the Name of the Lord, the Lord comes in to occupy us, to occupy our hearts where we store up all our desires, dreams, goals, choices. <br>  <br>  So the Lord does not just want us to be saved by calling, He desires to truly BRING us daily under His ruling. And this is truly a blessing. How blessed we can be to be living in the Perfect Will of God!  Knowing that we are not living our lives in a vain manner, but that we can be living a life that is fulfilling, pleasing to God. <br>  <br>  I pray for myself and for you sis, and all the dear brothers and sisters, that we will all have this kind of turn to the Lord each day. Telling Him that we do not want to be wild and on our own, easily bullied by satan, but that we want to be open to His word, to be renewed, to know His Will and to be genuinely living under the ruling of the Kingdom of the heavens.<br>  This is not just a future thing sis, this is a NOW thing. For the Lord to rule the earth, the Kingdom of Heaven to be brought to earth, God needs to begin that work IN His own people first. His ruling of us inwardly, gives Him a way to rule the earth outwardly.<br>  .." Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in the heavens"<br>  <br>  Grace be with you sister.<br>  Yours in Christ<br>  sandy|`|e1a7697c7943bcffd2fa613b82800630aa	Jesus is referring to the Celestial Kingdom.  Those who enter will have a fullness of joy.  To do so, they must 'overcome' for so Christ tells us in listing all the blessings of this Kingdom in the first three chapters of Revelation.<br>  <br>  Revelation 2:26 And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations: <br>    27 And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father. <br>    28 And I will give him the morning star. <br>  <br>  <br>  Revelation 3:21 To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.|`|1ec32bd76f3584208ce83bf42928a21faa	To understand this verse completely we should read Matthew 7:21 to 23 together.  The people who said "Lord, Lord" here are those who are standing on judgment day (note the words "in that day" in verse 22) before the Lord and seeing Him as the Almighty God.  In this situation even the unsaved people seeing the Lord as God in person will call Him Lord.  The answer to what the will of the Father here is given in verse 23 that these people who had called Him Lord should know Him.<br>  The works that these people claimed to be done in the Lord's name the Lord in verse 23 referred to as practice of lawlessness.  Obviously these people who had done miracles in the names of their false gods claimed them to be done in Jesus' name.  So verse 21 means that no one shall enter the kingdom of heaven unless they know Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior as this is the will of the Father.  God bless you|`|mo4MnsX7aa	It is the condition of the person's heart, not the words which come out of his mouth that determine his final destination.|`|G2byEP4raa	To me it says that even if you follow the word of God you may not necessarily get into heaven.|`|2CBxqNcaaa	Faith without works is dead.|`|houWY7qvaa	Verse before Matt. 7:21 tell about being on the watch for false prophets (Matt. 7:15)  "By their fruits you will recognize them.." (Matt. 7:16  So, not everyone saying "Lord, Lord, will enter the kingdom of heaven.  After this verse it explains the types who will not make it, calling out "Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and expel demons in your name, and perform many powerful works in your name?"  and in answering in Matt. 7:23 And yet then I will confess to them: I never knew you!  Get away from me, you workers of lawlessness."   False prophets or false religion will be done away with.|`|E9chZY74aa	Many say that they are Christians, but Christ never knew them because they have never done what He commanded, like being baptized for the removal of sins and living faithful unto death.|`|qcEzJDY6aa	The only thing Jesus wants for us is to know the will of His Father, as in His prayer, "Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven."<br>  Knowing the will of God is different from obeying the law.<br>  Those who obey God usually do not know what's God's will. They are just like children, giving no serious attention to what their parents really wants. Kingdom of heaven is just like entering adulthood, so a child need to know the ways of their parents in order to survive. Decision is Faith and that is what the people should understand and the law of Jesus Christ.( This is just a brief explanation )|`|AA11272456	Although short, this verse says a lot.  Firstly, it makes clear that 'kingdom' and 'heaven' are not the same thing.  If it were, then we would read:  "shall enter the heaven of heaven."  Moreover, a comparison of Daniel 2:44 assists us in recognizing the fact that 'kingdom' refers to a type of government – with a king at its head. Just like those other kingdoms described at Daniel 2:39-44.  Furthermore, at Matthew 6:33, Jesus commands us to seek God's kingdom first instead of things for ourselves.  Obviously, if God's kingdom were actually 'heaven', this would be a contradictory command, yes?  If the kingdom were heaven, Jesus would be commanding us to seek heaven first.  And that is hardly a self-less act!  The whole tenor of Matthew 6 is for us to put the kingdom ahead of our own basic wants and needs.  So although many people think so, this scripture is not discussing entry to heaven  – it is discussing entry into or benefit from a particular type of government – in this case a kingdom.<br>  <br>  This scripture also points out that on that day, many professed Christians will have been doing what they thought were wonderful things - prophesying, expelling demons, and performing many powerful works in the name of Jesus.  But Jesus would call those ones workers of lawlessness.  Elsewhere in the Bible sin is equated with lawlessness (1 John 3:4) so Jesus is calling these workers of lawlessness sinners.  They thought they were doing great and he says they were working sin.  He said the ones who would enter the 'kingdom' would be those doing the will of Jesus' father.  Obviously, if we want Jesus' approval, we had better come to an understanding of exactly what his Father's will is . . .  and then do it.  Jesus' main focus was to carry out the will of his Father.  So . . . what did Jesus spend the MAJOR portion of his earthly life doing?  We better be doing that too if we want to enter into the benefits of the kingdom government of God with Christ Jesus as king.<br>  <br>  Hannah J Paul|`|2d2ZuimCaa	Christ here shows that it will not be enough to own him for our Master, only in word and tongue. It is necessary to our happiness that we believe in Christ, that we repent of sin, that we live a holy life, that we love one another. This is his will, even our sanctification. Let us take heed of resting in outward privileges and doings, lest we deceive ourselves, and perish eternally, as multitudes do, with a lie in our right hand. Let every one that names the name of Christ, depart from all sin. There are others, whose religion rests in bare hearing, and it goes no further; their heads are filled with empty notions. These two sorts of hearers are represented as two builders. This parable teaches us to hear and do the sayings of the Lord Jesus: some may seem hard to flesh and blood, but they must be done. Christ is laid for a foundation, and every thing besides Christ is sand. Some build their hopes upon worldly prosperity; others upon an outward profession of religion. Upon these they venture; but they are all sand, too weak to bear such a fabric as our hopes of heaven. There is a storm coming that will try every man’s work. When God takes away the soul, where is the hope of the hypocrite? The house fell in the storm, when the builder had most need of it, and expected it would be a shelter to him. It fell when it was too late to build another. May the Lord make us wise builders for eternity. Then nothing shall separate us from the love of Christ Jesus. The multitudes were astonished at the wisdom and power of Christ’s doctrine. And this sermon, ever so often read over, is always new. Every word proves its Author to be Divine. Let us be more and more decided and earnest, making some one or other of these blessednesses and Christian graces the main subject of our thoughts, even for weeks together. Let us not rest in general and confused desires after them, whereby we grasp at all, but catch nothing.|`|XiITTg3waa	NOT EVERYONE WILL BE SAVED THAT CALLS ON GOD ,,,READ MATTHEW 13 ;3-9 THIS SHOWS EXAMPLES OF PEOPLE THAT HEAR HOLY SPIRIT AND PEOPLES REACTION !! <br>  <br>  IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO JUST  BELIEVE ,, OUR BELIEF HAS TO BE MANIFESTED THROUGH OBEDIENCE TO GOD ,,TO MAKE OUR BELIEF REAL !!<br>  <br>  OUR BELIEF BECOMES REAL  AND SHOWS IN OUR FRUIT THROUGH OUR LOVE FOR GOD BY THE WAY WE ARE OBEDIENT TO THE TRUTH !! <br>  <br>  ONLY WAY IT WORKS !!

Jesus did not say "John, behold your mother" because he gave Mary to all of us, his beloved disciples. All the words that Jesus spoke on Cross had a divine purpose. Jesus was not just telling John to take care of his mother.<br>  <br>  Rev. 12:17 - this verse proves the meaning of John 19:26. The "woman's" (Mary's) offspring are those who follow Jesus. She is our Mother and we are her offspring in Jesus Christ. The master plan of God's covenant love for us is family. But we cannot be a complete family with the Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of Christ without the Motherhood of Mary.<br>  <br>  John 2:3 - this is a very signifcant verse in Scripture. As our mother, Mary tells all of us to do whatever Jesus tells us. Further, Mary's intercession at the marriage feast in Cana triggers Jesus' ministry and a foreshadowing of the Eucharistic celebration of the Lamb. This celebration unites all believers into one famiy through the marriage of divinity and humanity. <br>  <br>  John 2:7 - Jesus allows His mother to intercede for the people on His behalf, and responds to His mother's request by ordering the servants to fill the jars with water. <br>  <br>  Psalm 45:9 - the psalmist teaches that the Queen stands at the right hand of God. The role of the Queen is important in God's kingdom. Mary the Queen of heaven is at the right hand of the Son of God.<br>  <br>  1 Kings 2:17, 20 - in the Old Testament Davidic kingdom, the King does not refuse his mother. Jesus is the new Davidic King, and He does not refuse the requests of his mother Mary, the Queen.<br>  <br>  1 Kings 2:18 - in the Old Testament Davidic kingdom, the Queen intercedes on behalf of the King's followers. She is the Queen Mother (or "Gebirah"). Mary is our eternal Gebirah.<br>  <br>  1 Kings 2:19 - in the Old Testament Davidic kingdom the King bows down to his mother and she sits at his right hand. We, as children of the New Covenant, should imitate our King and pay the same homage to Mary our Mother. By honoring Mary, we honor our King, Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  1 Kings 15:13 - the Queen Mother is a powerful position in Israel's royal monarchy. Here the Queen is removed from office. But now, the Davidic kingdom is perfected by Jesus, and our Mother Mary is forever at His right hand.<br>  <br>  2 Chron. 22:10 - here Queen Mother Athalia destroys the royal family of Judah after she sees her son, King Ahaziah, dead. The Queen mother plays a significant role in the kingdom.<br>  <br>  Neh. 2:6 - the Queen Mother sits beside the King. She is the primary intercessor before the King.|`|7JIhZ0R0aa	Jenny,<br>  We are all one family ("Catholic") in heaven and on earth, united together, as children of the Father, through Jesus Christ. <br>  Our brothers and sisters who have gone to heaven before us are not a different family.

The Church does teach that prayer to God is necessary for salvation for all believers. For a Catholic it would be wrong to ignore the liturgical worship offered to God at feast days for the saints and the prayers asking for their intercession.<br>  <br>  The Communion of Saints is a dogma of the ancient Church and is recorded in the apostles Creed. It simply states that the faithful because of their relationship with Christ are alive even after the death of their flesh and worship with us. To us the Church is made up of the Church militant who represents all those believers living out their hope in the flesh.<br>  <br>  (Phi 2:12 DRB) Wherefore, my dearly beloved, (as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only but much more now in my absence) with fear and trembling work out your salvation.<br>  <br>  (Phi 2:13 DRB) For it is God who worketh in you, both to will and to accomplish, according to his good will.<br>  <br>  It consists of the Church Suffering who are those who are temporarily in need of further purgation from sin so that they may enjoy the presence of God.<br>  <br>  (2Ma 12:46 DRB) It is therefore a holy and wholesome thought to pray for the dead, that they may be loosed from sins.<br>  <br>  Lastly, the Communion of the Saints consists of those who have won the race:<br>  <br>  (Phi 3:14 DRB) I press towards the mark, to the prize of the supernal vocation of God in Christ Jesus.<br>  <br>  Their immortal souls are in heaven in God’s presence:<br>  <br>  (Rev 5:8 DRB) And when he had opened the book, the four living creatures and the four and twenty ancients fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints.<br>  <br>  The universal stream connecting all of God’s creation is His love, which we take on in our baptism into our journey towards sanctification. This is not an emotional but a desire placed in us by the Spirit of God that endures as a desire for those other than ourselves and this love extends even to our enemies. This is truly a love that comes only from God and is a foreign concept and nonsense to those who have not received God’s salvific grace. This desire within our souls does not end with the death of our flesh but continues into eternity where the saints through their intercession in prayer encourage us in our race and assist us to endure unto our union with God.<br>  <br>  I think that some people of faith, who do not understand the Communion of Saints, somehow believe that asking saints to pray for us is detracting from our love or our trust in God. In truth it is impossible, if we truly love as God commands and has given us the grace to understand, not to pray to those whom we love and in turn we expect them to return that same love to us by praying for us and presenting our prayers to God. <br>  <br>  In Christ<br>  Fr.

Just trust that Jesus will help everyone figure out what they need to do...you included.<br>  <br>  Or how about if you try focusing not on Catholics, but instead someone who has ZERO sense of Jesus' love in their lives.

In particular, we should ask the intercession of those Christians in heaven, who have already had their sanctification completed, for "[t]he prayer of a righteous man has great power in its effects" (Jas. 5:16). <br>  <br>   Not only do those in heaven pray with us, they also pray for us. In the book of Revelation, we read: "[An] angel came and stood at the altar with a golden censer; and he was given much incense to mingle with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar before the throne; and the smoke of the incense rose with the prayers of the saints from the hand of the angel before God" (Rev. 8:3-4). <br>  <br>  Thus, in Psalm 103 we pray, "Bless the Lord, O you his angels, you mighty ones who do his word, hearkening to the voice of his word! Bless the Lord, all his hosts, his ministers that do his will!" (Ps. 103:20–21). And in the opening verses of Psalms 148 we pray, "Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord from the heavens, praise him in the heights! Praise him, all his angels, praise him, all his host!" <br>  <br>  Jesus himself warned us not to offend small children, because their guardian angels have guaranteed intercessory access to the Father: "See that you do not despise one of these little ones; for I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven" (Matt. 18:10). <br>  <br>  <br>  "But not the high priest [Christ] alone prays for those who pray sincerely, but also the angels . . . as also the souls of the saints who have already fallen asleep<br>  <br>  Rom 6:3-4 <br>  Or are you unaware that we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were indeed buried with him through baptism into death, so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might live in newness of life. <br>  <br>  Col 2:12 <br>  You were buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the power of God, who raised him from the dead.<br>  Pray at all times in the Spirit, with all prayer and supplication. To that end keep alert with all perseverance, making supplication for all the saints, the saints, and also for me, that utterance may be given me in opening my mouth boldly to proclaim the mystery of the gospel, for which I am an ambassador in chains; that I may declare it boldly, as I ought to speak" (Ephesians 6:18-20). <br>  Pray at all times in the Spirit, with all prayer and supplication. To that end keep alert with all perseverance, making supplication for all the saints, the saints, and also for me, that utterance may be given me in opening my mouth boldly to proclaim the mystery of the gospel, for which I am an ambassador in chains; that I may declare it boldly, as I ought to speak" (Ephesians 6:18-20). <br>  <br>  <br>  "First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all men, for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life, godly and respectful in every way. This is good, and it is acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth" (1 Timothy 2:1-4). <br>  <br>  <br>  But doesn't the Bible says Jesus is the only Mediator between God and man?<br>  A: Yes, it does; in 1 Timothy 2:5 ("For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus"), but we just quoted the four verses immediately preceding this one, and you will remember that in them Paul said: "I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all men." <br>  <br>  So the fact that Jesus is the one Mediator between God and man does not prevent other people from acting as intercessors. And we know intercessory prayer certainly does not displease God, for in the same passage we just cited, Paul tells us: "This is good, and it is acceptable in the sight of God our Savior<br>  I am sometimes stunned at how people can hop up and down about what Paul says in 1 Timothy 2:5 and yet miss the subject of intercessory prayer, which is not only the topic of the preceding four verses, but the segue into the discussion of Jesus' unique Mediatorship. <br>  <br>  For example, consider the following verses and the concern they show those in heaven having for what happens on earth:<br>  "Then one of the elders [who represent the hierarchy of the people of God in heaven] addressed me, saying, 'Who are these, clothed in white robes, and whence have they come?' I said to him, 'Sir, you know.' And he said to me, 'These are they who have come out of the great tribulation; they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb" (Revelation 7:13-14). <br>  "<br>  And they [the elders] sang a new song, saying, 'Worthy art thou to take the scroll and to open its seals, for thou wast slain and by thy blood didst ransom men for God from every tribe and tongue and people and nation, and hast made them a kingdom and priests to our God, and they shall reign on earth'" (Revelation 5:9-10).<br>   <br>  "Then the seventh angel blew his trumpet, and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, 'The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ this tells us these are the voices of humans, and he shall reign for ever and ever'" (Revelation <br>  <br>  11:15). "And the twenty-four elders who sit on their thrones before God fell on their faces and worshipped God, saying, 'We give thanks to thee, Lord God Almighty, who art and who wast, that thou hast taken thy great power and begun to reign. The nations raged, but thy wrath came, and the time for the dead to be judged, for rewarding thy servants, the prophets and saints, and those who fear thy name, both small and great, and for destroying the destroyers of the earth'" (Revelation 11:16-18). <br>  <br>  "And I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying, 'Now the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ have come, for the accuser of our brethren this indicates it is a human voice has been thrown down, who accuses them day and night before our God. And they have conquered him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, for they loved not their lives even unto death. Rejoice then, O heaven and you that dwell therein! But woe to you, O earth and sea, for the devil has come down to you in great wrath, because he knows that his time is short!'" (Revelation 12:10-12). <br>  <br>  After this I heard what seemed to be the loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, crying, 'Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God, for his judgments are true and just; he has judged the great harlot who corrupted the earth with her fornication, and he has avenged on her the blood of his servants.' Once <br>  <br>  How do you know the saints in heaven are praying for us<br>  <br>  "And Onias spoke, saying, 'This is a man who loves the brethren and prays much for the people and the holy city, Jeremiah, the prophet of God'" (2 Maccabees 15:14). <br>  <br>  <br>  The very verses we just quoted. It goes without saying, for example, that our guardian angels are aware of what we are doing. It is their job to guard us, after all, so we can be sure they know what we are doing and when we are asking them to pray for us.<br>  And in the same way, when we read of the saints in heaven offering our prayers to God in the form of incense (Revelation 5:8, 8:3-4), we know they are aware of our prayers.<br>  Remember: Most of the saints don't have physical bodies right now. They furthermore don't have physical prayer request cards or physical incense or anything like that. This means that when they are pictured as presenting God with our prayers, they are not physically presenting him with our prayers, so they must be mentally presenting them to him. But if they are mentally presenting our prayers to God then they must be aware of our prayers.|`|hR7OsqtRaa	Mary is the Most Blessed Woman to have ever lived on this Earth.

The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?<br>  <br>  Pasting a small part from the website.<br>  Visit the website to strengthen your faith in Jesus or to know more about Him.<br>  <br>  Jesus is God.<br>  <br>  1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus<br>  specifically.)<br>  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)<br>  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)<br>  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)<br>  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)<br>  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)<br>  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)<br>  14.

Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21<br>  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)<br>  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).<br>  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).<br>  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).<br>  26.

We venerate them for their great dignity and union with God.<br>  <br>  Matt. 15:4; Luke 18:20; Eph. 6:2-3 Exodus 20:12; Lev. 19:3; Deut. 5:16 - we are instructed to honor our father and mother. <br>  <br>  Luke 1:28 - the angel Gabriel venerates Mary by declaring to her "Hail, full of grace." The heavenly angel honors the human Mary, for her perfection of grace exceeds that of the angels. <br>  <br>  Romans 13:7 - we are to give honor where honor is due. When we honor God's children, we honor God Himself, for He is the source of all honor. <br>  <br>  1 Cor. 4:16 - the most important form of veneration of the saints is "imitating" the saints, as Paul commands us to do. <br>  <br>  1 Cor. 11:1 - again, Paul says, "Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ." The ultimate objective of veneration is imitation. <br>  <br>  Phil. 2:25-29 - Paul teaches us to honor Epaprhoditus who almost died for the faith. How much more honor is owed to the saints that did die for the faith! <br>  <br>  Phil. 3:17 - Paul says to imitate him and others, which is the goal of veneration. Veneration is not worship. <br>  <br>  1 Thess. 1:6 – Paul says to the Thessalonians, “You became imitators of us and of the Lord.” This is the goal of veneration. <br>  <br>  2 Thess. 3:7 - Paul says that the Thessalonians should imitate him and the other bishops. <br>  <br>  Hebrews 3:3 - Jesus is worthy of "more" glory and honor than Moses. This does not mean that the saints are worthy of no glory and honor. Instead, it proves that saintly people are worthy of glory and honor out of God's goodness. <br>  <br>  Heb. 6:12 – the author teaches us to be imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises. <br>  <br>  Heb. 13:7 - we must imitate the faith of our faithful leaders. We ask for their intercession and venerate them for their holiness. <br>  <br>  James 5:10-11 – James teaches us to take heart in the examples of the prophets and Job, who endured suffering. <br>  <br>  1 Peter 2:17 - Peter teaches us to honor all men, love the brotherhood, fear God, honor the emperor. Don't those living with Christ in heaven deserve honor? Catholics believe they do, and honor them with special feast days, just as we honor those living by celebrating their birthdays. <br>  <br>  Gen. 19:1 - Lot venerates the two angels in Sodom, bowing himself with his face to the ground. <br>  <br>  Gen. 42:6 - Joseph's brothers bow before Joseph with the face to the ground. This is veneration, not worship. <br>  <br>  Exodus 28:2 - it is especially important to honor religious leaders. Sacred garments for Aaron give him dignity and honor. <br>  <br>  Lev. 19:32- we should also honor "the face of an old man." When the elderly die in Christ, we should continue honoring them, because death does not separate them from us or the love of Christ. <br>  <br>  1 Sam. 28:14 - Saul bows down before Samuel with his face to the ground in veneration. <br>  <br>  2 Chron. 32:33 - Hezekiah was honored at his death. We honor our brothers and sisters in the Lord. <br>  <br>  Sir. 44:1-2 - we should praise and give honor to those who the Lord apportioned great glory. It is our family in Christ

There's a way to do everything, including advising and correcting people.<br>  <br>  And, if the people don't want to listen, we can't force anything.

If dirt bags and low lifes feel otherwise, it's because they are in fact low lifes and scum bags.  I've seen them all in my business, and they can all move to a barren rock somewhere in the North Atlantic.  That's where they belong as far as I'm concerned.

ahjqc9Ifaa	I know a few blind people, and they hardly use Braille at all, although they learned to read it and used it a bit in school.<br>  <br>  Most of them use materials readily available at regular libraries: audio versions of books. The ones whose habits I know "read" the books without help on a CD player (or cassette player), but need help selecting them from the library. Either a family member or friend goes with them, or a staff member helps.<br>  <br>  Those who live too far from a library, or whose library doesn't include an audio collection, can get recordings free from the Library of Congress, which has been providing this service to the blind since phonograph records were invented.<br>  <br>  Curt, the blind guy I know best, used readers in college, fellow students paid to read textbooks aloud to him. He'd also tape record the reading so he could review.|`|iIiRVexbaa	The word library doesn't always describe a collection of print books.  A library can be a collection of different types of media.  The Library of Congress serves the blind by providing books in braille or in audio form.  <br>  <br>  Of course these places are needed.

This gift was given for no other reason but to preach the gospel to unbelieving Jews and the speaker was able to preach in the native language of the hearers without the speaker ever having learned the language. The Holy Spirit spoke through these people and the hearers understood perfectly what was being said because they were hearing the message in their own language. We are told in Isaiah, some 700 years before the day of Pentecost that this gift would be given in the future and it was however, we are also told that there would come a time when this gift would cease to be in operation and that time has long passed. These so-called modern tongues speakers will always telly you that they have this gift however their actions simply don't line up with scripture. The so-called modern tongues speakers will utter some ecstatic gibberish which is unknown to be any language on earth and therefore claim to have the gift of tongues. In early New testament times, this gift was not to be used unless there was firstly an unbelieving Jew present because as we are told in Isaiah, "With men of other lips and stammering tongues will I speak to this people." And the "this people" refereed to here are the Jews and some 700 years later this gift was given at Pentecost. Also the gift was not to be used if there was no interpreter present and at any one church meting there were to be no more than 3 people speak in tongues and even then, it was to one at a time. Why have an interpreter? It was to tell the church what was being said as the hearer understood perfectly as he was hearing the gospel in his own native language. At the time of Penticost, Scripture records that living in Jerusalem there were Jews, devout men, from every nation under heaven and therefore they all spoke different languages hence, the need for this gift. I hope this helps. God Bless!

The new immigrants come from a country where they never saw other races or interacted with them.  It isn't just black people that they don't like.  It is white people, and also "other" type of Asian people (example, the Chinese hate the Japanese).<br>  They also say mean things that they observe.  Like, if they see a fat person, they will go into their face and say "you are fat".  This would never happen in the US.  When I was in China, I heard all sorts of stuff people said about me.  Of course, maybe they thought I didn't understand what they were saying, because "white people can't speak chinese" lol!<br>  Don't blame them for this, it is simply the culture.  After being in America a while, it gets better. America is the LEAST racist country in the world, and I have been around the globe.  Noplace else do people all races and religions live together without KILLING each other.  Europe would seem to be "not racist" but they are racist.|`|GPznIhzMaa	I'm Asian and I have many black friends. Where do you live? Is it the older Asian folks who are making you feel bad?

Some areas of the country have high tensions between ethnic groups (e.g. Asians vs. Blacks, Puerto Ricans vs. Dominicans, Mexicans vs. Blacks, Italians vs. Irish). It just depends on where you live, I guess.<br>  <br>  Some Asians can be racist. (I know a Black woman who knows Vietnamese, and she went into a Viet nail salon to get her nails done; and the employees, assuming she didn't know the language, talked crap about her right in front of her!).

qEdhPD8Laa	Having your dad disappear from your life at a young age has nothing to do with being a vampire. These lists of "symptoms" from Haemovore and Vampire Website are fake. These are fake websites that have nothing to do with the real vampire community. I think they say "vampires" have a missing father figure, because teens who lost one of their parents might be more likely to want to believe they're vampires.<br>  <br>  If you want real data from modern self-professed vampires go to here.<br>  <br>   <a href="http://www.suscitatio.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.suscitatio.com/</a><br>  <br>  This is not made up data, despite what Lord Bearclaw has said in previous posts. It's from a voluntary survey of over 900 self-professed human, living vampires. If you want proof that it's real, look at the sample questions. There were several hundred. Most self-professed vampires that I've encountered didn't take the survey, either because it was too long or because they were suspicious of it. This means the actual number of self-professed vampires is actually much higher than the number who took the survey. The Atlanta Vampire Alliance wanted to have reliable data for serious researchers of the vampire subculture.<br>  <br>  One of the best sites for information on the modern vampire subculture is Sanguinarius.org, but I doubt this is what your son is interested in.<br>  <br>  This site has good information on vampires in folklore and literature.<br>  <br>   <a href="http://www.vampgirl.com/vampires.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.vampgirl.com/vampires.html</a><br>  <br>  Cultures from all over the world have stories about vampire-like beings. Most of them don't fit the stereotype we're used to from popular culture. Many versions are like ghosts, demons, or monsters. Some are of living vampire-witches or sorcerers who shape-shift and steal the life energy from people or animals. The term "vampire" does not describe one type of being that can be easily classified or understood.<br>  <br>  - P.|`|AA12384132	Vampire are a unique story within themselves........ But know this that no vampire can turn a living human being into a vampire.. Now they can kill humans and drain them of their life blood but that person will never become a vampire because they were drain of their blood.... Also drinking a vampires blood will kill you just as quickly as their bites........ You see vampires live under a curse and that curse can never be broken or ever over comed....And once any vampire is destroyed in the correct manner that individual vampire can never return... Now I have already wrote several time about how to kill a real vampire... So if you want to know you will have to take the time to look it up.......

The Lord does this because He knew that it is impossible for us to make ourselves righteous by our own efforts but that He had to die for us by taking upon Himself God's judgment for our lifetime of sins and giving us His righteousness as a gift (2 Corinthians 5:21).  How can we not be drawn to love Him by such grace and lovingkindness.  God bless you.|`|5JqCObDSaa	God reaches toward his people with kindness motivated by deep and everlasting love. He is eager to do His best for us if we will only let him. After many words of warning about sin, this reminder of God's magnificent love is a breath of fresh air. Rather than thinking of God with dread, look carefully and see him lovingly drawing us toward himself.<br>  He lovingly laid his life down for us so we may live and he didn't have to do it....but he did! : ) And I thank him for that.|`|91b8e457b5505f973a8026a5f3d8f686aa	ne has to Taste The Love & experience for self.

Each time, it is addressed to a different group in the congregation, but in all instances, it is given for the same reason—that “all things take place decently and by arrangement.”—1?Corinthians 14:40.<br>  <br>  First, Paul said: “If someone speaks in a tongue, let it be limited to two or three at the most, and in turns; and let someone translate. But if there be no translator, let him keep silent in the congregation and speak to himself and to God.” (1?Corinthians 14:27,?28) That did not mean that such a person was never to speak at meetings but that there were times when he should be silent. After all, the objective of the meetings—to upbuild one another—would not be attained if he spoke in a language no one understood.<br>  <br>  Second, Paul stated: “Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others discern the meaning. But if there is a revelation to another one while sitting there, let the first one keep silent.” This meant, not that the first prophet was to refrain from speaking at meetings, but that he had to be silent at times. Then the one having the miraculous revelation could address the congregation, and the objective of the meeting—that “all be encouraged”—would be achieved.—1?Corinthians 14:26, 29-31.<br>  <br>  Third, Paul addressed Christian women only, stating: “Let the women keep silent in the congregations, for it is not permitted for them to speak, but let them be in subjection.” (1?Corinthians 14:34) Why did Paul give this command to sisters? To preserve order in the congregation. He says: “If, then, they want to learn something, let them question their own husbands at home, for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in a congregation.”—1?Corinthians 14:35.<br>  <br>  Perhaps some women were challenging what was said in the congregation. Paul’s counsel helped women to shun such a disorderly spirit and humbly accept their position within God’s headship arrangement, particularly with regard to their husbands. (1?Corinthians 11:3) In addition, by keeping silent, women would show that they did not aspire to be teachers in the congregation<br>  <br>  EDIT:  It's ok for us to speak up, we just have our 'place' in God's arrangement, that's all.  We can be teachers of God's word outside Church, we can speak up in Church and have our opinion and answers and comments.  But there is a place for everyone in God's arrangement.  That's not so hard to follow, is it?

po4j4xhAaa	Talk to your gf.  Be honest.  Tell her how you're feeling, she has a right to know that you want to be with someone else.<br>  In my opinion, and it's merely my opinion, 20 is way too young to settle down.  <br>  <br>  Whatever happens, just be open and honest with your gf.  She loves you and deserves nothing less than your honesty - even if it will hurt.<br>  <br>  Good luck honey!  You're in a tough situation, be strong and honest, and stay true to you.|`|4ab8439e5bb68131be2c8b6ff9ed3557aa	You might want to talk to your current GF about this.<br>  <br>  For one, don't just go "Sorry bye!" and run off with this new chick. If you really do love your GF, respect her enough to sit her down and talk to her about what you're feeling. Yeah, it's rough, but you need to do it.<br>  <br>  Before you talk to her though, you need to figure out what you want. Trust me, you need to know and everyone else involved is going to want to know. Do you want to stay in your relationship with your girlfriend? Do you want to start a relationship with the other girl? What do you want out of life the most, and which girl will help you with your dreams that the most?<br>  <br>  I dated someone older than me before, a lot. And I was in a similar situation as you... I found out a guy I'd loved forever liked me back, and things got messy reaaaally quick. So... definitely figure out what you want, then calmly talk with your girlfriend. Do NOT go off with the other girl until you know for sure that things are over with the current GF.. or until your GF agrees that you can see other people.<br>  <br>  You COULD just ask if you can date other people as well as her. :P Some people fall in love with more than one person (polyamory). Might be worth looking into.<br>  <br>  Cheers.|`|b78ccf9fca82180a2469e3a84d66e115aa	Ohhh Saz me old china plate...what a dilemma.......how long have you been feeling like this. <br>  I can't see these thought melting away, do you feel trapped in your relationship or is it the old, "the grass always looks greener" syndrome. What on earth would you do my love, if you had a relationship with this other girl, could you cope with the guilt, i don't think you could bear the thought of lying to your girlfriend and the grief it would cause her, i don't think you are that type of person.<br>  Suppose the underlying fact is that you are only twenty and yes you probably are bored with the routine of a steady relationship, it happens to the best of us...i know the feeling.<br>  So what to do, maybe not discussing exactly what you have said, but a general talk about how you and the gf see the future together. Her plans seem to lean towards the "lets make a lasting home/relationship" if you really are not ready for that kind of commitment then she deserves to know sooner than later. <br>  Staying in a relationship just to please your partner can only lead to resentment and will end in bitterness, you will blame her for trapping you and she will blame you for living a lie.<br>  Saz it's your call love, I would take time out, you don't have to make such major decisions immediately, do you?<br>  Hope it works out love.....love P?|`|hyYWX82Eaa	Yes, talk to her. If you're even thinking of having a long term relationship, you should be able to. Frame it in terms of wanting a few months to go out and about, not wanting to leave her. Suggest an open relationship to get it out of your system.<br>  <br>  Now, part of this will also be that SHE can go be with whoever she wants too. If you're down with that it can be a good partnership, a combination of stability and spice. <br>  <br>  Just cause you're together doesn't mean you have to be monogamous ^~|`|qIXukan5aa	No, you should do something. Don't take a chance with the other girl just yet, speak with your gf about how you are feeling, perhaps both of you will work it out and a break up won't be necessary. You've mentioned that you love the IDEA of settling down, but a part of you wants freedom to meet others and have fun. Personally, I don't think anyone is ready to settle down if a part of them wants freedom to meet others and have fun. Someone or both will be hurt.|`|wPI6RNhuaa	You are only 20 so you have lots of changes ahead for you. Have fun, dont make a long term commitment, you arent ready for that! Be true to self. if you want to see the other person, you must let your present love know. Dont compromise your honesty or self respect.|`|AA11263450	There are just a few questions you should ask yourself...when thinking about a committed relationship.  Trust me, I've been in one for 29 years with ALL it's ups and downs.  Ask yourself--do you share these important qualities with your partner....do you have the same shared dreams for the future...do you both have the same morals, ethics and religious bebiefs...do you share many hobbies, interests...and friends?  these are the things that can help couples in a lasting relationship, because true love is more than just sex.  About 3 years ago, my partner and I had a major falling out.  It damn near took a year, much effort and compromise but we found a NEW spark and the sex returned (better than ever!!!).  It can be done!  How much are you willing to put into it?  Just my thoughts and Good luck.|`|QOHrPeXKaa	If you love her but your not like in love wit her then there isn't much you can do. Maybe your scared to leave her because you've been with her so  long and you've built up this comfort level. Or maybe you just don't want to hurt her. Just really think about it. What does your heart say?|`|P3JsbI7gaa	omgoshhh lol ive been there one too many times.  <br>  --the only chances youll regret in your life are the ones you didnt take.<br>  <br>  --if you get a chance, take it.  if it changes your life, let it.<br>  <br>  mmm dont know if those quotes will help but.. i tried lmao<br>  <br>  edit: HUGS!!!<br>  <br>  edit again lol: hey saz, someone once told me "you cant make everyone happy, so u should work on making yourself happy"
wnSvjwWuaa	As Nina Garcia would often say about what Michael Kors would comment, "I Completely Agree!!!" (Yes, this is from the reality show "Project Runway" - which makes a hell of a lot more "sense" and reason for its existence than shows like "The Bachelor".)<br>  <br>  You hit the nail right on the head by stating your arguments the way you did: If marriage is SUCH a SACRED union, what the HELL are these idiots (of the straight variety, of course) doing on TV, acting as if one falls in love because there's a prize at the end of the road - cash, 15 minutes of fame, notoriety...and of course, we know some of these couples get divorced after the show where they proclaimed to one and all how they will "cherish each other".<br>  <br>  I am from the Philippines, and frankly, in terms of religiosity, the USA has nothing over us. My country is more than 85% Catholic - and this religion (and its beliefs) permeate even our national laws. Our President actually said that her family planning program should NOT contradict the Catholic Church position. This is the OFFICIAL government position.<br>  <br>  We don't have divorce here, and yet, strangely, people keep getting annulments left and right, because this is ALLOWED by the Catholic Church. As I understand it, the term annulment is used if "the marriage did not exist in the first place"...we see many of our local celebrities having this grandiose wedding ceremony on national TV, then they get annulled because the "marriage never happened"?!? <br>  <br>  Pure and simple hypocrisy.<br>  <br>  They're getting the divorce without calling it that.<br>  <br>  So, if the moralistic prigs in the USA want a crash course in how to deftly respond with hypocrisy but marketing it as "old fashioned, good morals", they should come to the Philippines. We WROTE the book on that.<br>  <br>  Again, I'd like to reiterate, as far as your points go, I COMPLETELY AGREE.|`|zYsOWu4Saa	Well I don't get why people watch The Bachelor.

Evu9Eq06aa	it's kind of funny that people are laughing and telling you to see a doctor when what your saying is true. I believe we are all Gods connected to the God of the universe or universal God or Soul.<br>  <br>  Most of the time, when people claim that they are God, they claim that thier like a messiah or a God alone. But when I say "I AM" God I mean it as we are all Gods constituent to the Universe. The media and religion brainwash us from an early age to think when ever you here someone claim that they are God it's blasphemy or their crazy. <br>  <br>  Seek the truth and questioned everything.<br>  <br>  Love is all we need and no list of commandments|`|AA11114869	Once, as a child, - I said that very thing...<br>  <br>  At the age of five I had a brief spell as a God when I became the owner of a little tank of Sea-Monkeys...<br>  <br>  I would spend a good portion of the day looking down at the little creatures; the recent hatchlings, as well as those in their death throes, and all others in between.<br>  <br>  I'd just sit and simply watch them move to-and-fro, writhing and jerking about from here-to-there, driven by some unseen force in a desperate attempt to establish some kind of order within the chaos of their little world...<br>  ... and yet, while they were in the midst of these exhaustive efforts, I had moments where I found myself in awe of the majesty of my omnipotence over them; a smile crossing my face in knowing that those little creatures were completely oblivious to the fact that, any moment of my choosing,...<br>  ...

The god in you is more alive than you think. for the god in me served your error.|`|ghMJyzsOaa	We are all Gods, we are source power, and everything physical is an extension of our source power, including our bodies. Many people are trapped by immovable religious concepts, which prevents them from seeing outside of what they have been taught to believe. This makes them no less than us. It's just that we have had a fortunate opportunity to control what we choose to believe, and to shape our thinking around our own personal experience, unhindered by religious limits, rather than following someone else's Idea about to whom and what God is. A number of years ago when I was a religious zealot living in a Jesus community, with other brothers and sisters. I would have never accepted this line of thought. It was only when my beliefs began to transcend beyond the accepted thinking structure of this community, that I really began to explore truth and experience enlightened states of illuminated knowledge and wisdom.       <br>  <br>   When you truly believe that you are source power on a subconscious and conscious level, and operate in the cultivation of higher thought work, you will open the door to where you really are, and you will grow to understand that you have always had the power to shape and create your own experience; without the need and dependency on external influence. <br>  <br>  Your proclaimed truth must be guided, though, by a rational mind, which always endeavours to be in alignment with a balanced desire to procure knowledge and wisdom through your direct experience, for the primary purpose of becoming an enlightened illuminated being.  Bless You!<br>  <br>  <br>  Before one chooses to folllow a standard religious pack of beliefs, one usually feels lost and confused, but when one adopts the belief as their very own, everyone suddenly is wrong and they are the only ones on the planet who are right because it is writen law, and they are taught to believe that it is the only way to God. This God can not move beyond the written code. Following gives them a profound sense of security, but this is right for them. They often forget about grace and love and return to witch hunt mentality.<br>  <br>  There are some very wise people, who have, within the religious infrstructure risen beyond, the "My belief is right and yours is wrong" or "My God is bigger than your God"  I just hope that these people can find some peace in what they believe and be elevated to a place where they do not feel the need to point the fingers at others. <br>  <br>  Bless you dear friend!|`|gsTpQmGfaa	I believe I am part of the great all, like a drop in the ocean.

oHvmqpxmaa	First off Slavery is a crime against humanity. Human beings are born free. <br>  They are not property, they are not produce or products, people should not <br>  sell other people. It's kidnapping. Africans were kidnapped from Africa, <br>  against their will, regardless of what anyone says about how they were "sold" <br>  by their own people. People use that as if it makes slavery more okay on the <br>  whites behalf, it doesn't.<br>  <br>  So there was:<br>  <br>  1. Slavery, which lasted for 400 years & included being made to cook whites food, tend their fields, clean their house, wash and dry their clothes, baby sit their children, breast feed their children [yes, breast feed], sleeping in floorless cabins and often times for some slave women and girls being subjected to sexual advantages by white slave owners.<br>  <br>  Blacks were NOT allowed to learn to read. They didn't go to school.<br>  <br>  People were whipped if they didn't perform to the whites satisfaction.<br>  All of this was UNPAID labor. <br>  <br>  2.Beyond slavery. Beyond that black people were still horribly<br>  wronged. Blacks could not vote. We had to do whatever any<br>  white person said and make sure to stay out of their way because<br>  anything that you did in those times could cause you to be<br>  swinging from a tree. Whites were above the law and the law<br>  didn't protect black men and women. Black CHURCHES were <br>  Bombed during service, google Birmingham Church Bombing,<br>  Black people were lynched.<br>  <br>  Often times Black men were accused of crimes they didn't<br>  commit. White women would accuse a black man of raping <br>  them and without a trial, without any significant evidence, <br>  he would be hunted down, beaten, lynched and his corpse burned.<br>  <br>  Black men are even today a scape goat. Just last year a white<br>  woman made up a mythical Black man and said that he <br>  attacked her and wrote and "O" on her face for Obama. <br>  <br>  Black people weren't allowed to eat or shop at certain <br>  establishments and even when blacks and whites did inhabit <br>  the same space, they had to sit in the least desired spot. <br>  <br>  When blacks fought for their rights, we had dogs sicced <br>  on us by the police, fire department water hoses turned on us,<br>  clubs beating on our backs and everything else in between.<br>  <br>  There was no justice. And you ask us why we have hatred?<br>  <br>  Hmph!|`|yAJE2lbraa	Well a long time ago slavery was pretty bad in America. I think you have a good perspective on everyone being equal. Don't let anyone try to change your opinion about how you feel twords different races. As long as our being positive about it. I'm white not that it really matters ad I don't have a problem with black people. I think that whoever it was that said us white people whooped you and stuff is full of s-hit. I men c'mon that was a loooong time ago. And white people now didn't do anything. Yes obviously they had no respect for human kind, but ppl go are replying to your question should watch what thy say because I don't go around beating up black people. So whoever says what we did to you is a racist fool. That was a million years ago! Lmao well you know what I mean.

White people were understandably reluctant at this idea but the Blacks assured them it was only for a little while. White people end up having to take these locals all the way back home at great inconvenience and expense. The white people tried to tell the black people it was all misunderstanding but it started this whole big thing where Black people insisted on living behind the White people's plantation house for 300 years. White people during this time was busy with another friend, Native peoples.They were having some landlord tenant disputes. Native peoples were being a little sensitive if you ask me. I mean who hasn't stolen someone's house, given the occupants syphillis, forced the ocupants to occupy the least desirable small fractions of their house, deny them equal rights in the house, and murdered anyone who thought this was unfair? I'm sure most of us have made this mistake plenty of times. <br>  <br>  Even then, everything would have been cool between Whitey and Blackey if White people hadn't borrowed Black people's 40 acres and a mule and forgot to give it back. After that White people and Black people really didn't talk, they were in a seperation (but equal of course) for another 100 years. During this time White people may have made some statements where it SOUNDED like they didn't like Black people but sometimes these quotes get taken out of context. It was all in fun I'm sure and some of the estrangement is on Black people. We should be more careful about whose boat we stowaway in.|`|8342eb2791b4f481bc2b31b4c0d0dbccaa	The actions of a few people (slave owners, or KKK people) made the whole race seem evil.  Even though, most people never owned slaves or made any trouble.  That is really human nature, though, to hate or to have prejudice, no matter what your race is! You are right, that all people do wrong things, and only God can cure that.|`|4sh2oRR7aa	Once? They still do. I know black people who call white people slavers and cite injustices done to their people. The black people nowadays have more rights than whites. White people have no resources. I don't get how people can harbor hate when absolutely nothing bad has been done to them personally. You can't list slavery and crap because it hasn't happened now and no one now has done anything wrong. A lot of the white people in the USA, their ancestors didn't own slaves anyway. Only 1% did. Also not all blacks were slaves and some biracials owned slaves as well. But black people seem to think they've earned the right to be racist towards white people that never made them suffer. That's not how life works. They're not lynching people now. The KKK has very remote power. Black people get everything in retribution. What more do they want? A cookie for being black?|`|JTSNljLhaa	well Devil its because of Slavery and Racism..Racism is still here today in the U.S sad but true<br>  you would think the so called most powerful country in the world can over come such a little thing,people should just accept others how they are, that goes for every race|`|JxUFDutxaa	You're joking right?<br>  Slavery, Beatings, Rapes, Lynchings, treated like animals.<br>  Segragation, fire hoses, food thrown at them..<br>  <br>  Racism is bad on all sides..and no one is better than anyone..but it's understandable there is some anomosity there..|`|qvycijbOaa	My friend, you really need to do some research on your black history, I can't stand to see a clueless brother walking and talking without knowing part of himself.|`|A9vvZ6eUaa	You know black slavery is barely a mark in the history of slavery.

They just think that they are simply "Black" (which is only their race)???? How come they don't know exactly what country their ancestors came from and what ethnic mixtures are in their blood line?? That's not from slavery????<br>  <br>  Oh, how about the fact that there is still a disproportionate amount of Black people living in poverty compared to White people? You think they just LIKE living like that? Or do you think maybe it came from the segregation era.... when Blacks were forced to live in unequal housing and attend schools with unqualified teachers... And, you know, when that happens, since they are being educated by unqualified teachers, they never gain the skills to earn a good job and bring themselves and their families out of poverty. So, then their children end up going thru the same thing. And their children's children. It's a vicious cycle... And, just because you never personally participated in it, do not be mistaken to think that it does not still affect Black people to this day.<br>  <br>  My 2 cents.
eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	Here is truth - read and understand. <br>  1. Vampires, defined as a humanoid being that MUST consume blood or energy to survive do not exist. Cut and paste time, as it is too much work to type this out over and over and I "recycle" my own answers instead of retyping them so here goes. A brief discussion of the human digestive system and then the probable vampire population given an exponential growth rate should explain why vampires are not possible. <br>  <br>  2. The human body is not designed to process large amounts of blood for nutrition. There is not enough protein, carbohydrates, and fats present in blood to maintain a complex creature such as Homo Sapiens or any theorized offshoot mutations. When a human ingests food it is first broken up into a bolus by chewing, then churned up in the stomach with digestive juices to form a mass called chyme. It then passes through the pylorus into the duodenum, part of the small intestine where it mixes with bile salts and secretions from the pancreas and liver which continue breaking it down on a molecular basis, mostly affecting fats at this point. The broken down nutrients pass through the wall of the intestines and into the bloodstream where they are carried to each cell or stored for later use. Indigestible bulk continues through the intestines, turning a dark brown from the bile. Water is absorbed from this mass in the large intestine depending on the needs of the body - a well-hydrated person will usually have a softer stool than a dehydrated person will. Water also enters the bloodstream, and this is what helps to maintain blood pressure. The pressure tends to balance itself in a healthy person because the bloodstream goes through a formation in the kidney called the Loop of Henle, where the narrowing blood vessel forces excess water and cellular waste such as urea out through the cellular wall into the kidneys, where it is excreted through the ureters into the bladder, and then out of the body via the urethral passageway.<br>  <br>  3. IMPORTANT - A person physically unable to process his own food for nutrition therefore also could not process blood - it's the same process. Ingested blood does not transmit directly to the veins anyway - it would be chemically broken down by the digestive system.<br>  <br>  4. Theoretical ingestion of blood to supply these nutrients would therefore have to occur at least once a day, and would require the ingestion of the entire blood supply which could not happen as the stomach is far too small to hold that much liquid volume. Hold up your clenched fist - under normal conditions your stomach is about that size. Furthermore, such a mass would be difficult to pass thru the intestines as it has no fibrous bulk, would create an intestinal impaction, causing massive vomiting from the large concentration of iron present, and any "real" vampire would have to eventually expel the waste, which would come out as a black, tarry, smelly goo, just as stool does when blood is present from a upper GI bleed. <br>  5. These humans that affect the whole "vampiric lifestyle" are NOT vampires. They are simply humans playing their own little game, in their own little fantasy world, usually pandering to their own little sexual fetish, which may or may not actually be sexual. I too, play my own little game, in the SCA, but mine is a game where the deeds that I do are determined by the strength of my arm and sword - I am a warrior, with just as much skill and ability as any warrior of ancient times. The difference is that I am claiming to be something physically possible: a warrior, and I prove it everytime I strap on my armor and walk onto a SCA battlefield. The so-called "vampires" are claiming to be something physically impossible: a walking corpse, and all they prove is that black Victorian clothing, a pair of false fangs, and a little makeup make for a good Halloween costume - it does not make you a vampire.<br>  <br>  6. Even if a vampire feeds once a week, and his victim also becomes a vampire, that is exponential growth, with four iterations a month. First iteration: One makes one, total two. Second iteration: Two make two, total four. Third iteration: Four make four, total eight. Fourth iteration: Eight make eight, total sixteen. 16 vampires at the end of one month, 256 at the end of the second month, 4096 by the end of the third month, 65,536 by the end of the fourth month, 1,048,476 at the end of the fifth, and 33,572,832 vampires at the end of half a year! By way of comparison, there are currently approximately 33 million people who have HIV/AIDS and the disease is a world-wide epidemic. I see people every day in the hospital with AIDS, but never has there been one documented case of a vampire attack. Do the math - vampires are a mathematical impossibility. As for the idea that vampires existed "a long time ago" consider the estimated global population 5,000 years ago - using the above mathematical rationale, a single vampire converted every human on the globe in less than two years. This falls therefore, under the logic of Occam's Razor - which states that when you have removed every impossible answer, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth. Since there is no "vampiric plague" swarming the earth, the logical deduction is that they don't exist.<br>  <br>  7. Point of clarification about "vampire" bats: vampire is simply the name we have given them because they do drink blood, same as a flea, mosquito, leech, or spider. Are these creatures vampires? No. They are living creatures, not legendary monsters. They can subsist on blood because of their smaller size and proportionately larger stomach volume. Drinking blood does not make you a vampire anymore than eating raw meat makes you a werewolf, although it might make you a mosquito.<br>  <br>  8.The humans who profess to be vampires are victims of an all-encompassing self induced delusion. They are as human as you or I, regardless of their claims, and if they ingest HIV tainted blood they can most certainly contract the disease, esp. if they have any cuts, sores, or lesions in and or around their mouth. It is a very dangerous delusion to be laboring under. Note that there is absolutely no scientific or medical proof that these people derive any benefit at all from the ingestion of blood, and even worse are the so-called "psychic" vampires, because their delusion is one that they cannot substantiate with any concrete evidence at all.<br>  <br>  9. There is no "vampire" gene. People are not "born" as vampires. When a woman goes to the hospital for prenatal care there are many tests done on mother and child, even while still in the womb, to check for many things, including genetic anomalies that result in deformities and birth defects. If such a gene existed, in today's world with today's technology it would have been found - we have already completely sequenced the human genome. It would also have to follow Mendel's law of dominant/recessive gene theory. Again, the odds on that many "vampires" all escaping the notice of the medical/scientific community are so low as to be almost nonexistent. The idea that there is a global "vampire community" engaging in controlled breeding to keep the "bloodline pure" is delusional in the extreme.<br>  <br>  10. There is no "vampire virus" - as I have already pointed out, HIV is a virus, and look at how fast it has spread - virtually everyone knows someone with the affliction. According to the "vampire websites" there are "thousands" of vampires running around. If that was so then at least one of them has ended up in a hospital for bloodwork when they became pregnant, had a bloodborne infection, was injured in a car wreck, etc, etc, ad nauseum. The anomaly would have been detected and medical science would have isolated it, studied it, applied for research grants on it, published papers on it, and turned it into the talk of the medical and scientific community, as well as making its "discoverers" celebrities and rich beyond their dreams. A virus cannot alter your DNA in such a radical fashion without killing you.|`|wsQwfKn4aa	Believe it or not, even a human on an all liquid diet farts and poos. There is less poo, but it's mostly normal in color and consistency. So I would assume the same is true of vampires.|`|7gHnVJpyaa	Since they are undead, it is possible that their bowels and digestive system do not work at all, but I suppose there would have to be some way for their system to process all that blood.<br>  <br>  It's one of those vampire secrets. You have to be a vampire to find out, and if you're a vampire, you wouldn't tell an outsider.<br>  <br>  It's a good question that they clearly forgot to ask in "Interview with a vampire".|`|RTZvxTH5aa	I dont think the mythological creatures create any waste. I think they absorb 100% of the blood and metabolize it.<br>  <br>  <br>  The humans who are weirdos and pretend they are vampires, however, poo and fart like the normal humans they are. They probably do have loose stool from consuming blood too.|`|dbCkTKDxaa	for one there is no such thing as vampires. that turn into humans then a bat and fly around but there are bat that are vampires. so i think they could there a type of animal and that's what they do|`|AA11104649	That's a good point.<br>  Certainly detracts from their sophisticated image.
dc00e6f724cc094e75dc0475843d0e44aa	A better question might be, can Mormons be called Crhsitians if they can show in the Bible where all of these things are in the Bible?<br>  <br>  All of these things are in the Bible.  The Bible repeatedly shows that God the FATHER and his SON Jesus Christ are separate beings.<br>  <br>  The Bible tells us that in the beginning, all were created by God and that all are his offspring.  That makes us ALL brothers, being the offspring of God.<br>  <br>  John 3:16  (Jesus is the Son of God)<br>  16 ? For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. <br>  <br>  Acts 17:28 (All of us born to this earth are sons of God)<br>  For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring. <br>  <br>  Job 1:6  (In the pre mortal realm, we all were created sons of God, including Satan who was there also)<br>   6 ? Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also among them.<br>  <br>  We are all sons of God, and therefore "brothers."<br>  <br>  Its all in the Bible.  Have you read it recently?<br>  <br>  Another misnomer.  Mormons do NOT believe that salvation is based totally on our own works.  That is false.  Salavation ONLY comes through and by Jesus Christ.    Our works determine "where" in heaven we will be, but salavation only can come through Jesus Christ and his grace and atonement.<br>  <br>  One other point.  Does not John 3:16 say, "whosoever" believeth in Christ will obtain eternal life?    It does not say, who ever believes this way or that way.   Mormons believe in Christ.  He is our Savior.  John 3:16 alone implies that "whosoever" believes in him is a Christian......<br>  <br>  If you would care to learn the truth about Mormons, talk to one.   There is so much misinformation and deception out there about Mormons it makes me wonder who is the autor of it all.  ie the author of all lies is the devil.|`|FyLfEPv0aa	Since the trinity didn't exist until 325 AD do you claim that early Christians weren't Christians either?<br>  <br>  Also, would you explain how Satan isn't the brother of Christ as everything created was done by God making Satan a son of God who choose to rebel and Christ calls Himself the son of God - so explain the alternative to me.|`|2JbCMKNAaa	NO....Mormon belief is NOT Christian...they are a false christian religion.|`|Xcri5qeTaa	Mormons are Christians if they believe Jesus is Christ.

They read and study and follow the NT.<br>  <br>  Unless some of you have been directly called by God or the dictionary people to have the authority to proclaim who is and is not a Christian then they have no business claiming Mormons are not Christian!<br>  <br>  Given the fact that Protestants broke from the traditional beliefs of the Catholics some of you really do have some nerve claiming that just because Mormons dont follow the exact same beliefs as you they arent Christian.<br>  I guess the Catholics then have the authority to proclaim every single Protestant a non Christian, too, and their argument would be the exact same as the Protestants that are claiming Mormons arent Christian!|`|BMQlzUkfaa	Who said that the concept of the Trinity is correct? <br>   <br>  I thought that a Christian is one that believes that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and who believes that he came to pay for our sins and to break the bands of death through the resurrection.  <br>  <br>  Mormon's are definitely Christian's under this definition.  <br>  <br>  By the way, are we not all brothers and sisters?  Mormon's believe that we are all literal brothers and sisters as our spirits all are from God.  If this is the case, then even Satan and his followers are also our brothers and sisters.  Just because we may be related doesn't make us the same as Satan.  Jesus Christ is not only our brother, but also our Lord and Savior.  <br>  <br>  I am a Mormon and have a strong witness that Jesus Christ is the son of God, the great redeemer.  I honor, love, praise, and try to follow him.  If that is not a Christian, what is?<br>  <br>  P.S.  Who "invented" the concept of Jesus Christ, God, and the Holy Ghost all being one floating thing without a body, and why would Jesus be resurrected if he did not have a body?  Why would he pray to himself?  I propose that the concept of the Trinity is the made up doctrine.|`|8RRlokvhaa	Jesus Christ is the Word of God made into flesh and came down as a human to save us.

They do claim to be Christians however, and many Christians accept that they are.  However, since their belief is that their salvation is totally based on works, they have a big problem. They have also added the book of mormon to the inspired scriptures, which is expressly forbidden in Christianity. They have 'added' to the gospel, and if  the gospel is added to, it is no longer the truth. Therefore, they are not practicing Christianity, but something else.|`|flrRLhClaa	I don't beleive they think Satan is Jesus' brother.<br>  <br>  My goodness!<br>  <br>  As far as the Trinity goes,  many people have many definitions of the Trinity as to what it is.<br>    Some believe they are all ONE.<br>    Some beleive that Jesus & God are One and the Holy Ghost is separate.<br>      <br>  Some beleive Jesus is the Son, God is the Father and The Spirit is God's active force, all in UNITY.|`|VLRZT9Foaa	Yes, they are.<br>  <br>  FROG...

So what that someone was unhappy with religious rules, so they just decided to branch off and make up their own.|`|lZuM2pxgaa	This guy Kerry has it right; give him the points.<br>  <br>  I'll just add that when I read a book like the Catholic "Seeker's Catechism", 90% is similar to what's in the Mormon book "True to the Faith".<br>  <br>  The founders of Baptism and Methodism had issues with their own churches, saying they didn't have priesthood authority. Baptists apparently believe in baptism by immersion, but don't think it's necessary for salvation. There was still an apostle alive when the Catholic bishop claimed to be head of the church. So many doctrinal problems for everybody. So, they have no right to say who's Christian.<br>  <br>  I believe Jesus Christ lives and he is my redeemer. That's all that's important.<br>  <br>  FYI: Glenn Beck does NOT represent Mormons.

I was raised by a single parent and I think it is incredibly selfish to actually plan to be a single parent. I'm gay and I would never have kids because of the stigma they would face by having gay parents - that's something else you're going to have to consider.

8Mi15cTtaa	The question before the court isn't actually about gay marriage. It's whether the voters are able to change a low. Can the court overturn a vote that indicates the "will of the people." I think this is an important issue.<br>  <br>  According to experts, on both sides, they say that prop 8 will stand but the marriages performed last summer will also remain valid.|`|mYe6TDmzaa	I think prop8 is unconstitutional.  We are still people and we deserve to be treated the same as straight couples.|`|spbqfjvbaa	At least with the court hearing the oral arguments today, there's hope that :<br>  1.  Prop 8 will be overturned<br>  2.  They won't nullify those 18,000 SSM that were performed legally before Prop 8 passed<br>  <br>  But no one really knows, except for the CSSC.  That's why so many people, legal experts, etc., are putting their 2 cents in to say how they THINK the court will rule.  <br>  <br>  Personally, I'd love it if they'd overturn Prop 8.  If that doesn't happen, at least don't nullify those 18,000 SSMs that were performed pre Prop 8.  The LGBT community can always re try with another gay marriage ballot in the future.  If the court lets Prop 8 stand AND nullifies those marriages, I will be devastated, to say the least.  <br>  <br>  But, I see the historical significance & will keep our wedding pics, our marriage license, the broom we jumped right after the ceremony into the land of the married & show them to the future generations.  I still have 4 nieces & nephews, & my wife & I will still adopt kids.  I know by the time these kids are teens/our age, they won't believe that their Aunts & Moms had to go through all this rigamarole to get our marriage recognized by the State & the US Government.|`|AA10214265	The CA Supreme Court has already ruled once in favor of gay marriage.

My feeling is that it means they're leaving "no stone unturned". My feeling is that they will find Prop 8 unlawful because it's an attempt by voters to revise a law which the courts had already established. It's going to be a long nail-biting battle, but I am optomistic marriage equality will prevail.|`|CSWNU2REaa	The court will uphold the decision made by the voters - (it can come back on a next ballot) but the court won't overturn the vote.

Yes, this is a democracy. So how is it democratic to strip people of their rights AS PEOPLE? How is refusing someone the right to marry just because they are the same sex keeping with the Liberal platform? Sorry, but you're completely and utterly wrong-- it's the Republican mindset that got Prop 8 passed to begin with.

2WfHLUyOaa	What you do to others will come back and bite you in the ***... What goes around comes around, so to speak.|`|yOK32PM9aa	It depends on the context.  It has slipped into colloquial English as the idea that what happens to you - your fate, or destiny - has been shaped by your previous actions.  This is a bit like the Hindu concept of Karma, but nowhere near as sophisticated and rigorous. It is different from the Buddhist concept ("Kamma" in Pali) which simply means intentional action by body, speech, or mind.  As such it is one of the things that shapes what happens to people, along with all the other physical and biological causes that impact upon us.  In all accounts, it has a moral component: the idea is that by doing good, we improve ourselves and our lives in some way, and by doing evil, we run ourselves into trouble.|`|Ow7I1J1gaa	"Cause and Effect".  In other words, whatever you do will always have an effect.  <br>  <br>  1.  CAUSE:  You smoke ciggarettes<br>       EFFECT: You get cancer<br>  <br>  2.  CAUSE:  You drink and drive<br>       EFFECT: You crash the car<br>  <br>  3.  CAUSE:  You work your damn hardest <br>       EFFECT: 20 years down the track you've got money shooting out your a s s.<br>  <br>  You get it?<br>  <br>  In some cases though it's kind of like, if you kill someone then 50 years down the track someone else will turn around and kill you or take your kids.  That's karma.  If it don't get you in this life it'll get you in the next.  Karma works both ways, it's not always bad.  If you give out positive energy you get back positive energy and vice versa.|`|MI53mUKzaa	what goes around comes around|`|4068ddb702bdc41558e963e223abc40eaa	"As you sow, so shall you reap."|`|2567c53ea5be1f53420408d56fd5f4b4aa	Not sure, but it can get you "instantly"!|`|YQRDr3Lkaa	Karma is the believe that if you do good things, then good things will happen to you.  Likewise, if you are a bad person and do bad things, then bad things will happen to you.  <br>  <br>  Originally, this was derived from Asian religions and the good or bad things that happen to you might not happen in this life, and might happen in your next life after you are reincarnated.<br>  <br>  So, for someone to "believe" in Karma, they have the belief that if they are nice people and treat people well, that nice things will happen to them.|`|1YW5WTg6aa	Karma is like a bank account for the results of your actions. In general if your actions are good you will have good credit, and if bad, bad credit. <br>  <br>  The only way to free yourself from this pay as you go lifestyle is to offer your work to God. In this way you will not have to suffer the so called enjoyable results of your activities. You can simply enjoy your eternal position as a loving servant of God. <br>  <br>  A devotee of God does not want enjoyment separate from God. In truth, there is no actual position separate from God. When we try and live separate from God we are in illusion. Illusion means "that which is not". Nothing exists outside of God. But because God has given us free-will we also have the right to misuse it. It is when we misuse our free-will that we are put into this false reality. <br>  <br>  Atheist often speak about seeing something real. But the very nature of life without God is like a branch that has been separated from a tree. It will only remain green for so long. This material life is real but it is temporary. Spiritual life is transcendental and eternal. <br>  <br>  There is nothing material that can impede spiritual progress. Therefore, Karma is merely a bargaining chip for temporary material enjoyment.|`|NiRFYhVDaa	its like if you did or wish something wrong for anyone it will come back at you double or triple..

zmX4b4nsaa	According to Hinduism, women are never below men.  Everyone is equal.  Hinduism, which is an offspring of the 'Sanathana Dharma', is not a religion.  It is a way of self-refinement so that the person who practices its principles first becomes a 'true human' and thus, gets the insight to see within to realize the true Self, that is GOD.  Unfortunately, some of the so-calld 'gurus' of the modern times, with half-baked knowledge and lack of understanding, have distorted the facts our holy Vedas affirm.  Self-realization is for everyone, irrespective of the Race, Color and Caste.  Hinduism treats every religion as ladders to elevate one's level of divinity.  It never speaks ill of any religion.  Contrary to the mis-belief, one need not renounce anything or become a saint to begin the exploration of the Self.  As per our holy scriptures, One need not and should not convert to another religion to realize the Self.  The subject is vast and cannot be explained in a few words.|`|DIlNnjf8aa	Hinduism practices devadasi, child temple prostitution of very young girls.

dnA6sAFqaa	There is no way (unless you are a genius) that you can learn Swedish to the level required for university course in 3 months - more like 3 years. Three months would get you by when you are out shopping or for some tourist type things because people don't mind if you make mistakes or misunderstand what they say or use the wrong prepositions, the wrong grammar, the wrong form of the indefinite article/definite article). For university such mistakes are unacceptable. You need to be able to read/write/ speak/ hear/ understand Swedish to a high level.<br>  The best way to learn Swedish is to combine a Swedish course with immersion (being immersed in the Swedish language - listening to Swedish spoken by native Swedes and for academic Swedish - know and understand specific words for your coursework. Your coursework at university will involve reading a lot of books written to a high academic level as well as writing papers (essays etc) to a high level. This is difficult enough for native Swedes, let alone someone from an other country.<br>  <br>  The people who are best learning Swedish fairly quickly (apart from people from other Nordic countries such as Denmark and Norway) are those from Germany or Holland. They generally take between 1-2 years to be fluent in Swedish (to an academic level).<br>  <br>  I moved to Sweden from Scotland in 2002. I am a church minister and am now fluent in Sweden. My husband (who is Swedish) is an associate professor of psychology so I am used to the acadmic world here in Sweden. Although I picked up basic Swedish fairly quickly through the SFI (Svenska/Sverige f?r invandrare - Swedish/Sweden for immigrants/) course organised by the various local authorities (4 hours a day/4 days a week going to school where the only language spoken is Swedish and other languages are not allowed in class with 2 hours of homework (l?xa) a day = immersion method). I got my certificate in Swedish after one year which was considered to be very good but I was by no means fluent in Swedish. I have worked as a minister here in Sweden for several years now but I have only felt fluent enough  to counsel people and be involved in crisis/conflict/catastrophe work (listening, understanding, reading between the lines of what people are saying) for the past year or two. I was very experienced in this field of work in the UK and although the seven years have been exciting, they have also been tiring, frustrating and extremely tough,<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to try to find a course that is in English here in Sweden. There are many.<br>  <br>  One of my friends who did a PhD here in Sweden did everything in English. She had been in Sweden for several years and when it came to defending her thesis she wanted to do part of it in Swedish but her supervisor would not allow her to do this as he felt her Swedish wasn't up to a sufficient standard for academia.<br>  <br>  My advice would be to find a course in english here in Sweden. If or when you feel fluent enough in Swedish, you can switch to other university courses (even to another university). Once you are in to the university network here it is easier for you to do this. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|paerqxfMaa	It depends on your ability and the difficulty of the language.

Some strategies would involve maybe watching porn together, and when he (obviously) becomes aroused from it, otherwise why would he be watching.. take advantage of the situation.. Or alternately get a camera/camcorder and make your OWN porn for him/you to watch. <br>  <br>  The only way to change this behaviour is to meet him on his own terms and work back to a middle ground.

yn6P70Bdaa	This is a beautiful poem.  Some very good images like "And look for a bird sound that sneaks from behind the horizon with a new daylight." or the heron "who sings his best tunes while bleeding."  Your instinct is right, however, that some of the phrasing is not smooth English.  I'll suggest some things in this limited space. Second line needs to be changed or you will lose readers there.  "Fall down in a hall should be "in a hole" or something totally different. Third and forth lines need to be re-done.  "The closest person" doesn't translate well.  We would say "the closest person to you hits..."  Line four, something more like, "You'll find someone to take it out and help restore your life."    "Happy life" and "smile" in this context are too simple or something.<br>  Line eight, "things" has to be more specific.  Line ten should be "Don't wait if a dear person has deserted you."  Line 11 is fantastic.  Line twelve, you have repeated "heart" again.  Can't do that. Line thirteen - delete the last part.  Just use, "Don't look for  a dream that let you down."  Line 14 suggestion, "Don't stand too close to the ruins. Bats inhabit them and spirits know the way there."  Your next line, "And look (should be listen) for a bird sound..."  Line 19 - phrase should be "lost their letters." Line 20 should be "Their lines" instead of "And its lines." Line 21should be, "You will discover that these lines are not the most beautiful words you have written."  Line 22, take out the parenthesis.  Line 23, should be "throw them to the wind."  Line 24, "These lines were not accidental but a heart feeling that it lives letter by letter.  Line 25 take out "that weird bird" and change "sing" to "sings" Line 27 - "If winter closes your doors"  Line 30 - "far: you will see flocks of birds..."  Line 31 - Great  Line 32 - Great.<br>  It is hard enough to write in ones own language, let alone doing it in another.  You have courage to open yourself up like this.  I think it is very difficult to do.  One other thing; I didn't go back and look at tenses - using present, past and future.  Someone else may have a comment on that.  Thank you for some great thoughts and images.|`|jKBQgwEqaa	sorta i didnt read the whole thing but wut i read was fine

A kingdom divided against itself cannot stand."<br>  <br>  Or something in that context.<br>  <br>  Point is, if you are healing people or sensing people who are here for the wrong reasons, you are doing God's work. If you are telling fortunes and leading people astray, you aren't. <br>  <br>  Spirits are all around us. All the time. At least according to Christianity (and my beliefs).

Last time I checked, lots of Christians were asking the Holy Spirit to talk to their hearts.  This is confusing.<br>  <br>  If you are a newish Christian then you have a newish church that you go to, with a preacher inside it.  Set up an appointment with him to ask the same question you asked here.<br>  <br>  I personally think that modern churches don't make room for things like prophecy and seeing angels and devils, and crazy dreams where you see dead people or the future, and having psychic powers like telekinesis and telepathy.  The only people to get by with that is who the preacher says can get by with it, and the rest of the special-power people are heretics.<br>  <br>  You better ask God if it's alright.  If you can see good spirits then I don't see why an angel won't appear one day with the scripture to answer your heart's question, or for the Holy Spirit to tell you directly.|`|vouUQQzBaa	ahh well..tarots are pagan. witchcraft in general is more associated with paganism.

They do all the hard works. The lady just play piano (gu zheng), sew clothes, drawing, take care of the babies and children...for men, they have to go out to cut the trees, go down to the padi field, make the cow work. If they all go to become the soldier, including the young boy, because not enough soldier. Who do you think this job will take over? That's right, women.

TXyFtQ9uaa	what makes a person great is the strength of their personal qualities and what impact they have on others around them, people often get confused with associating greatness with good, that's not necessarily true for a person can be a great big idiot, or their evil deeds could be very great to say the least. A person with the gift of the gab could be a great orator that has a large influence over either their peers or even a community. However the best of those who are great are those who influence others towards all that is good, the prophets of God being a prime example and then those who try to emulate them.|`|F3Cgpfw0aa	Dear Friends,<br>  <br>  In my view greatness is a broad concept, and it is very subjective. It also depends on the time: what was commonly thought to be great in a person in the past may not be so today. This brings in what I would like to call: “the collective thinking”. What is defined as great in a person may differ from individual to individual, but in every time there seems to be a prevailing cultural that dictate a common attitude to concept like this, although there are always individuals that think differently and, for this, they are often emarginated by society, or they feel emarginated by society.<br>  <br>  In my view, we are today witnessing a cultural decadence: I think that many current heroes are the product of a “big brother”, “reality show”, shallow society, which, through a sort of TV “brain wash”, fictitiously creates myths that are worshipped by many and are deemed to be great, just because they appear on TV daily, just doing their job as most people do.<br>  <br>  For me, the real great people are the unknown and/or forgotten heroes, those that did what they did (often risking their lives) not for personal gain, but just because it was right.<br>  <br>  Ciao|`|62364eb8ec72973c388641049ba83389aa	Having a reputation of respecting humanity and educated in the wisdom of personal knowledge they can share.|`|rTqA9HDKaa	humility|`|dCewrtXaaa	The ability to lead, not just with words but with deeds (setting a good example and taking responsibility for one's own action), and to inspire others to positive actions.|`|fPqIZDR9aa	The willingness to fight for what a person knows is right, not just go along with the pact.  An example would be if somebody were to be hurting somebody right in front of you, and you were to say something about it, or stand up for them, or even in the case of you, if you were to stand up for yourself and say that the person is not right for saying such things about you. You are helping people to understand that the world isn't all about them and not all about you, but everybody.  It's called, you are working with the world, not against it, so that we can all be in synch with each other, so the world can turn-look at water.  It's never disorganized.  Every piece of it is in synch with the next piece.  Water doesn't take a bump and get out of line. Nature doesn't get out of line.  People do.  It's important we keep people in check, or else, the world will have chaos, what cultures create.  America already figured that one out.  Now, they are just waiting for the rest of the world to catch on.  Some are catching on and others are just staring blindly at them.  By, what do you mean?  You mean we are supposed to understand you?  Yes, water understands water.  People should be able to understand each other.  Separating people doesn't achieve this.

YXGdwwTJaa	You can do research on whatever you choose.  The only difficulty may be in finding contacts and then getting your questions answered.<br>  <br>  I would imagine that those who go to church would be happy to answer you and talk with you, though still beware of any proselytising.  At you could see where they are as churches are obvious buildings.<br>  <br>  I only know about Jehovah's witnesses from the occasional time they have knocked on the door and tried to spread their beliefs, usually leaving a magazine behind.  As you seem to know where they worship, then it might be easy to make contacts, but, from those I have met, it might be hard to get them to do more than tell you about their beliefs.   I once knew vaguely a woman from one sect, which may have been the Jehovah's.The strange thing, to me, was that her children were not allowed to celebrate Christmas, which was  a problem when it came to school parties.  <br>  <br>  So it depends on what you want   and are able to do.|`|AA11209233	I think it would be too hard to be objective if you are one or the other.
AA11227341	Excellent Q, but the action you share here is to be vigilant-a watchtower to oversee that we not sleep--conformists  when we know the enemy is out there--as when we are instructed to be vigilant,  to be as the brides waiting for the bridegroom, as to pray when Jesus told the disciples to pray for an hour with Him.  <br>  Still, we cannot allow our passions to direct our actions as "today I am going to college and share the message of Jesus at the student union" even though that is what we are to do---talk about God--remember Job;s friends when they got reprimanded by God?, for if we are not guided by the Holy Spirit to action, we tend to fall.  <br>  Let me share this---we were singing a morning greeting to all the mothers from church (as a youth group) so before we went out, I was guided to say a prayer for anything that might come against us, well guess what, we were stopped by a drunken man (sure we stopped) we were still young so we freaked but continued with our Mother's Day greetings after he left.  The youth group was prepared (I was the youth group leader) to stand since the Holy Spirit told us to pray.  Here is one example the pastor mention in a service--can we go and take the message to a bar or night club on our own?  No, we must be guided by the Holy Spirit before we venture out.   <br>  I can understand your passion Matt. 28: 18-20 if I am not mistaken but let us allow the Holy Spirit to guide our actions so that we can stand tall.    <br>  I enjoy your Qs, they make us--belivers to reflect on what you share here with us all (well at least I like it).  <br>  Peace to you my sister.|`|VWMbRHlOaa	You do whatever He asks you to do whether it is to evangelize in India or teach in a local Sunday school.<br>  <br>  Sometimes He calls you to simply read the Bible and pray solely.

QUHZfYz4aa	Nice question and good points made here. I wonder why we need to believe anything at all. Most of the "reasons" that people give for believing or not believing in any God come down to purely analytical abstract evidence; the intelligible mentation that, as you suggest, is the basis both for monotheistic aryan-semitic religions and for modern science and athiesm. I would suggest that direct full perception, learning how to open one's attention and awareness to maximum, to experience as much as possible of each moment (instead of this thin abstract-emotional layer called "me") leads to a beliefless experience of pure knowledge, or gnosis, such as lies at the heart of Lao Tzu's teaching, and in many respects the teachings of Buddha and Jesus (before they were corrupted by mental-emotional priestifying - I recommend the non-canonical Gospal of Thomas for some of the most authentic, non-intuitive "quantum" observations of Jesus, along the lines of "lift a stone and I am under it" etc). This pure knowledge is not the mental-emotional idea of yoga-adverts and mystical nonsense, but the ultra vivid - yet quite normal - experience of mystery, the pure mystery of thisness - beyond belief and non-belief.|`|nJatWOhsaa	"Atheist" is an easy label, something that people, even dumb people, can quickly grasp.<br>  <br>  In reality I'd probably say "theological noncognitivism" is the closest thing to my beliefs...

On the same note I do not believe in this greater power with faith, I believe that the word faith is thrown around by to many religions when they can not explain why they believe in.

It also said he would end it on the end of the 6th day.<br>  <br>  Possibly what is meant by “days” is ages. Ages last about two thousand years each and started in the Age of Leo after the Great Flood around 10,000 BC to 8000BC. Followed by Age of Cancer 8000 - 6000 BC, Age of Gemini 6000 - 4000 BC, Age of Taurus 4000 - 2000 BC, Age of Aries 2000 - 1 BC. We are now in the 6th Age (6th day) the Age of Pisces from year 1 to some time in the year 2000 AD.  We are expected to enter the Age of Aquarius within the next few years. So, we are now at the end of the sixth day.<br>  <br>  So, even though we’ve always had all those things before, they would not have meant anything until all prophecies have been met and not until the end of the 6th day.<br>  <br>  Before the prophecy is fulfilled, we are told that the holy land will be returned to the Jewish people. In 1948, this was achieved, Israel.<br>  <br>  Daniel foresaw the unification of Europe into a superpower. European nations that have now merged into a superpower -- they have formed the “EU,” the confederation of the European Union. On May 1, 2004, ten new nations officially entered the European Union.<br>  <br>  Your Question was is there anything going on now, that hasn't happened before. So, yes we haven’t been in the 6th Age before, Israel was not formed before, nor was the EU.<br>  <br>  The only prophecy still unfulfilled is the building of the 3rd Temple. But that is debatable.  There are two views of the temple. One belief is that the temple will be built by man and the other (Within the Talmud's list of things, which God created before the world was created, the Talmud includes the Holy Temple) is that God Himself will build the Third Temple, and it will descend out of the fire from Heaven, onto its appointed place on earth.  If one can conclude the Temple is the body of God  (2 Corinthians 6:16, "for ye are the temple of the living God.") Then the Temple may already be built and will not descend until the final day.|`|sGojEWOxaa	The Word of God says that it will be as it was in the days of Lot.<br>  Luke 17:27-29 (King James Version)<br>  <br>   27They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all. <br>  <br>   28Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded; <br>  <br>   29But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.|`|NXTpQSdhaa	All the stuff that points to the end times (wars, famines, natural disasters, unbelievers) has been happening around us throughout all recorded history.<br>  <br>  So no, the signs are not there.

I can send it to you if you would like to read it. Takes you straight to your bible for answers. Awesome book! spreadingoodnews@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS OF THE LAST DAYS<br>  6 “Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom.” (Matthew 24:7) Millions of people have been killed in wars during the past century. One British historian wrote: “The 20th?century was the most murderous in recorded history. .?.?. It was a century of almost unbroken war, with few and brief periods without organised armed conflict somewhere.” A report from the Worldwatch Institute states: “Three times as many people fell victim to war in [the 20th] century as in all the wars from the first century AD to 1899.” More than 100?million people have died as a result of wars since 1914. Even if we know the sorrow of losing one loved one in warfare, we can only imagine such misery and pain multiplied millions of times over.<br>  7 “There will be food shortages.” (Matthew 24:7) Researchers say that food production has increased greatly during the past 30 years. Nevertheless, food shortages continue because many people do not have enough money to buy food or land on which to raise crops. In developing countries, well over a billion people have to live on an income of a dollar or less a day. The majority of these suffer from chronic hunger. The World Health Organization estimates that malnutrition plays a major role in the deaths of more than five million children each year.<br>  8 “There will be great earthquakes.” (Luke 21:11) According to the U.S. Geological Survey, since 1990 alone an average of 17 earthquakes per year have been powerful enough to damage buildings and crack the ground. And on an average, earthquakes strong enough to cause total destruction of buildings have occurred yearly. Another source states: “Earthquakes have claimed hundreds of thousands of lives in the last 100 years and improvements in technology have only slightly reduced the death toll.”<br>  9 “There will be .?.?. pestilences.” (Luke 21:11) Despite medical advances, old and new diseases plague mankind. One report says that 20 well-known diseases—including tuberculosis, malaria, and cholera—have become more common in recent decades, and some types of disease are increasingly difficult to cure by means of drugs. In fact, at least 30 new diseases have appeared. Some of them have no known cure and are fatal.<br>  PEOPLE OF THE LAST DAYS<br>  10 Aside from identifying certain world developments, the Bible foretold that the last days would be marked by a change in human society. The apostle Paul described what people in general would be like. At 2?Timothy 3:1-5, we read: “In the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here.” In part, Paul said that people would be<br>  ? lovers of themselves<br>  ? lovers of money<br>  ? disobedient to parents<br>  ? disloyal<br>  ? having no natural affection<br>  ? without self-control<br>  ? fierce<br>  ? lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God<br>  ? having a form of godly devotion but proving false to its power<br>  11 Have people become like that in your community? No doubt they have. There are people everywhere who have bad traits. This shows that God will soon act, for the Bible says: “When the wicked ones sprout as the vegetation and all the practicers of what is hurtful blossom forth, it is that they may be annihilated forever.”—Psalm 92:7.|`|YJVmL9Ubaa	The economy,we are getting closer to a one world currency,that has never happened before,prophecy speaks of 8 kingdoms(the u.s. would be the 7th),the bible says that the 7th will only last for a short while(the u.s. has only been in existence for a little over 200 yrs.)the bible says the 8th will be the last,the u.s. very well might fall due to the economy.lf it does then that fits in with prophecy.|`|408d09404066a3f4b3514273ef2131cdaa	No, there's no evidence.

It phenominological definitions.<br>  <br>  However passages such as Luke 16 or 1 Kings that discuss the dead being "Active" that make others believe there is no soul sleep.|`|iHDYncuXaa	I guess some don't take the bible literal...<br>  <br>  "We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord."

God gave us the intelligence to invent pain killers, and I believe in a loving God that would not want me (or my husband) to suffer needlessly.|`|2JbCMKNAaa	God did not create kidney stones or any other disease.

They gave me a load at the hospital and I was grateful for the relief!<br>  <br>  Edit- I apologize, as I didn't even notice that you had posted a link. To that man, I say he needs to let the woman who is giving birth make the decision. He (kinda) had the best part in creating the baby. He should shut the hell up and get over his idea that God expects women to suffer pain during childbirth.

That's insane.|`|AA11816050	Denying medicine or available medical assistance may be illegal in some states. Besides, I believe that God works in ways that we yet do not understand. Anyone who denies medical help to another does not understand the love of God, who, in my view, wants only the best for His children.|`|YnGIccE8aa	God gave wo/man the gift of free will and intelligent thought. With that came the advent of medicine. Pain killers have been around for a long time in the their rawest forms and humans have been using them as such. So would God want someone to suffer when s/he didn't have to? I highly doubt it. <br>  <br>  BUT in regards to epidurals -- they are not the greatest thing to happen to childbirth (a 35% increased risk of c-section is just one issue). I'll spare you my soap box rant about it, but it should definitely be the woman who decides whether or not she wants one, even if her declination is due to scripture: IT'S NOT THE HUSBAND'S CHOICE.<br>  <br>  I have to admit the question you linked is really worrisome.

6Whz1p5Eaa	This is actually a very ignorant question. I know lots of young Christian teens who recently converted and there is nothing"Phelps-like" about them. They are just happy, loving kids who have found something to be passionate about.

All such conduct is contrary to spiritual meekness.<br>  <br>  But you would get his sternest reproach and a warning that you are on the sure path to Hell for using obscene language in regard to God. <br>  <br>  God -- any God -- will demand this of you.|`|f3nwI8ytaa	I've never gone through that stage.

NWa45ZDIaa	My opinion is that MY religion is anything but depressing. I have learned that God is not only real, he is a loving father who cares deeply for us. He provided the Bible that can be confusing sometimes but with thorough (& proper) study we see that it is a beautiful history book, containing countless examples we can mimic, including Jesus who was the greatest man to ever live. His ministry alone shows that God wants us to be happy, joyful, content, & the best part is God gives us a wonderful hope for the future. I'm not talking about floating in heaven on clouds with baby angels, THAT would be depressing, but the Bible says that the earth will be transformed into a paradise, & we can live FOREVER in it. Sickness, death, pain, suffering, war, crime, hatred will be all done away with. It's not depressing at all. Here's a couple scriptures that prove this:<br>  Psalms 37:9-11 "For evildoers themselves will be cut off, But those hoping in Jehovah are the ones that will possess the earth. And just a little while longer, and the wicked one will be no more; And you will certainly give attention to his place, and he will not be. But the meek ones themselves will possess the earth, And they will indeed find their exquisite delight in the abundance of peace."<br>  <br>  Acts 24:15 "and I have hope toward God, which hope these [men] themselves also entertain, that there is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous."<br>  <br>  Revelation 21:3,4 "With that I heard a loud voice from the throne say: “Look! The tent of God is with mankind, and he will reside with them, and they will be his peoples. And God himself will be with them. And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed away."<br>  <br>  Isaiah 33:24 "And no resident will say: “I am sick.” The people that are dwelling in [the land] will be those pardoned for their error."<br>  <br>  Isaiah 11:6-9 "And the wolf will actually reside for a while with the male lamb, and with the kid the leopard itself will lie down, and the calf and the maned young lion and the well-fed animal all together; and a mere little boy will be leader over them. And the cow and the bear themselves will feed; together their young ones will lie down. And even the lion will eat straw just like the bull. And the sucking child will certainly play upon the hole of the cobra; and upon the light aperture of a poisonous snake will a weaned child actually put his own hand. They will not do any harm or cause any ruin in all my holy mountain; because the earth will certainly be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah as the waters are covering the very sea."<br>  <br>  Isaiah 65:21-25  "And they will certainly build houses and have occupancy; and they will certainly plant vineyards and eat [their] fruitage. They will not build and someone else have occupancy; they will not plant and someone else do the eating. For like the days of a tree will the days of my people be; and the work of their own hands my chosen ones will use to the full. They will not toil for nothing, nor will they bring to birth for disturbance; because they are the offspring made up of the blessed ones of Jehovah, and their descendants with them. And it will actually occur that before they call out I myself shall answer; while they are yet speaking, I myself shall hear."<br>  <br>  Isaiah 25:8 "He will actually swallow up death forever, and the Sovereign Lord Jehovah will certainly wipe the tears from all faces. And the reproach of his people he will take away from all the earth, for Jehovah himself has spoken [it]."<br>  <br>  Romans 8:21 "that the creation itself also will be set free from enslavement to corruption and have the glorious freedom of the children of God."<br>  <br>  How can anyone deny that this is something hopeful & not depressing at all. If you like you can contact me, or research more about this at <a href="http://watchtower.org." rel="nofollow">http://watchtower.org.</a> <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|ffd239a4ffeda13ea64b21e50cc7ce78aa	Your idea of God is misplaced.  I don't know where you got that notion from maybe your upbringing has something to do with it.<br>  <br>  God loves you.  He is not an old man with a stick waiting to punish you. If you do read the bible particularly the new testament it's all to do with His love for you.  Yes, they are teachings in the bible where it's stated you can find yourself thrown into hell. What a lot of non-believers like to quote without looking at the bigger picture.  Spirits that go to hell choose to go there. (Souls that leave the body after death)  They condemn themselves. God doesen't, He is forgiving.<br>  <br>  Keep persevering.  Keep asking God for help. You are not the only person to feel what you described.    As St Augustine said:<br>  <br>  "Faith is to believe what you do not yet see; the reward for this faith is to see what you believe.|`|2242ab75cc3bad9ab4ca7fbaf5578defaa	You feel like this because you have not given your whole life to Jesus yet<br>  <br>  If you do this all will be well|`|1xMTNTgkaa	I feel the same way.

So his gospel was about seeking a hidden treasure, not about blood sacrifice.<br>  <br>  This will explain the original gospel and will explain why it is that the religion we have these days is so depressing: <a href="http://gospelenigma.com" rel="nofollow">http://gospelenigma.com</a><br>  <br>  But you are right on target... you got it right, but the theologians got it wrong.|`|AA11521494	Christianity is designed to be depressing - to tell you that you are a miserable sinner and you need to keep grovelling before god to be forgiven.

God bless you.|`|KUehcrofaa	I need to know exactly what it is that you find so heavy and depressing about following the Bible and going to Church.  Now you are correct that religion is depressing - that is why Jesus Himself spoke out against religion - (See Matthew 23 where Jesus blasts the hypocrisy of the religious leaders of His day).  You see Christianity is not about religion - it is about a personal relationship with God, your loving Heavenly Father.  If you do not feel this fellowship, and are not one in the bond of love with God and fellow believers, then you are not living according to what the Bible perscribes for your life.  If your Church does not come together in joy and fellowship, then it is not operating according to how the Bible perscribes.  Now it is true that wht Word of God is powerful and sharper than any two edged sword, and sometimes it cuts us because of our sin and we have to get into a right relationship with God - but even though it hurts sometimes, it is a cause for joy and celebration because we have been brought into a right relationship with God and His blessings He wants to pour out in our lives.  So tell me what exactly is depressing you, because Jesus said "I have come that ye may have life, and that you might have it more abundantly."  If you are getting depressed - then you or your Church are simply not doing somthing right.|`|rLCx5ljQaa	It is depressing so that it will make u feel sad and instill the image that the only way to feel good is through thier religion.<br>  <br>  its a way to rope u in, basically.<br>  <br>  If you recognise that this is depressing, STOP GOING TO CHURCH, it is bad for your mental health.|`|57695d6cd2bdf46926c92c61db0be293aa	i know what you mean, but it is sad if you do not celebrate or have a good time at church in the eveings after worship, thats sad.<br>  <br>  Its nice that you are honest, thats good, but be sure you have the truth, i think you need to learn how to readthe bible, we were taught, it is very important.<br>  there are many dark and dangerous things to be aware of as you get older.<br>  Please be careful and please become a searcher a seeker, there are people even at church you cannot trust.<br>  i dont see why your worship day should be full of only mourning.<br>  there is nothing wrong with mournng but  surely there should be time for celebration, the bible teaches that we should praise the lord.<br>  <br>  dont you go away together with church friends.<br>  <br>  i never found church depressing, i loved worship and discussing the bible and biblical things. i loved listening, there was sos much to learn, we had excellent pastors and teachers.<br>  excellent friends.<br>  excellent fun.<br>  <br>  you need to reach out and find another group, in our church when youth reach age of late teens, they travel to other churches in the country<br>  our church is very organised, and churches up and down the country regularly meet, for camp holidays sport. social and work occassions.<br>  <br>  i think you need to trust in Jesus but findother christians, hose that can put the joy in your life....<br>  education is also the answer, it is hard to know how to conduct yourself if you arenot taught, and we all need company, i desperatelyneed comapny, but have always been a bitof a loner. <br>  i branch out, poorly as i am, irecommend it, try other denominations of christianity....<br>  <br>  www.adventistsinglesconnections.com<br>  www.christianmingle.com|`|RZetcwalaa	Its depressing its trying to be-little your only life by saying its some sort of test to see weather you qualify for the mystical after life.

Just be happy!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Hope i helped!!!<br>  <br>  Take care!|`|qozdiWpIaa	Believing in God does not give depression; but give an impression I am cared for by the one who is above all. Since the true God faithfully help the one who really seek Him. So the belief in God who gave life for every man to be happy in the Lord providing salvation for all who repent and leave his sinful life. If you seek redemption of sins through JESUS CHRIST THE LIVING GOD earnestly you shall receive a confident impressive life instead of your depression now. All that is religion is not the one who give redepmtion; but it is the person Jesus Christ the Son of the Living God sitting at the Right Hand of God gives you salvation and everlasting happiness. Bible speaks the truth about Jesus Christ. The religious rites and mere going to church without Christ Jesus does not give anything but depression. That's true. But if you seek Jesus Christ really you would attain a different impression about Bible and God. You shall really attain your salvation through Jesus Christ if you are ready to repent on your hitherto sinful life you were in. So  let your depression go away from you by ardently seeking Jesus Christ the redeemer of Mankind. He sacrificed His life for us to be redeemed on accepting Jesus as our Lord and Savior and on our repentence of our sinful life. Jesus Christ  is my Lord of Salvation and my Lord of Hope. All my brothers and sisters can seek Jesus Christ the only redeemer ever lives for you and me.

I would suggest that you go and try to have a good time, maybe afterwards you could take your boyfriend to something that he feels kind of anxious about, nothing solidifies a healthy relationship more than helping each other expand your comfort zones. <br>  <br>  That being said, never push each other to do something the other truly doesn't want to do. In this situation I think you might enjoy the game if you just let yourself relax.
KILFoc6kaa	They will recognize that you are a new face, tell them that you are new to the church as a whole, and need some mentoring.  They will guide you along willingly and answer questions that you have.|`|65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	I agree with the first answer, talk to people there, they will be more than willing to keep you in the loop as to what is going on.<br>  <br>  As for "prayers you should know", prayer comes from the heart.  Just reciting what everyone else says isn't talking to God, you have to be sincere and open.  Certain prayers have endured because they have this quality, the things they say can be applied to many different situations, and can mean different things to different people.  That makes them useful when leading a group in prayer, since everyone can apply the same words to their own thoughts and feelings.<br>  <br>  But you don't have to pray out loud.  Your prayers can be between you and God, and nobody has to know what the two of you talk about.  So listen to the preacher's prayers when you bow your heads, listen to the things he asks of God when you are all together.  He is seeking to guide you in your own dialog with God, but it is up to you what you thank Him for and what you ask for His help on.|`|FxAD44Moaa	first of all what's the purpose to going?<br>  <br>  that's the foundation to any success or failure you come about with this church.|`|hXecFLRyaa	I'm new to Christianity also.

E2VUH8Q0aa	Diana is the Roman name for the goddess Artemis. She is also called Phoebe and Cynthia. <br>  <br>  Artemis the daughter of Zeus and twin sister to Apollo. <br>  <br>  She held reign over childbirth and conception, fertility of person and harvest (thus her association with the Lunar cycle), menstruation, virginity and chastity (which would seem at odds with the whole childbirth thing, but....), and, oddly enough, the forest and it's creatures. Her symbolism include the moon, archery and hunting dogs. <br>  <br>  She killed Adonis because he was spying on her while she was bathing; she turned him into a deer and had his own dogs hunt him down....tough chick.<br>  <br>  Artemis became associated with warfare when Sparta claimed her as one of their primary deities.|`|nEc0L0MRaa	Diana was the Huntress, not a warrior.

Her name has the root di ("to shine") and probably means "bright one". Like her Greek counterpart she was also a goddess of domestic animals. With strong associations as a fertility deity she was invoked by women to aid conception and delivery.<br>  <br>  There was probably no original connection between the Italian deity and the moon, but Diana later absorbed Artemis' identification with both Selene (ie., Luna) and Hecate (or Trivia), a chthonic (internal) deity; hense the characterization triformis sometimes used in Latin literature.<br>  <br>  The most famous place of worship for the Italian goddess was the grove of Diana (ie., "Diana of the wood"), on Lake Nemi near Arisia. A shrine common to the cities of the Latin League and hence of some political importance. Associted with Diana were Egeria,spirit of a nearby stream who shared with Diana the function of causing and easing childbirth...<br>  <br>  At Rome, the most important temple of Diana was on the Aventine,and in her cult there Diana was considered the protector of the lower classes,specially slaves.<br>  <br>  In Roman art she usually appears as a huntress with bow and quiver, accompanied by a hound or deer...
211Wwh6Laa	It's tacky all the way around.  No offense, but just because he's your crush, that doesn't mean he reciprocates your feelings.  And besides...do you want to run the risk of him thinking you're a certain way and being put off, or possibly running around showing that picture to all their buddies as a show of being "big cheese"?  Sending photos like that to someone you haven't been dating seriously (and even sometimes when you are, you have to be sure he's not being a crass pig with his buddies) sends a message that you're easy.  It might sound unfair, but like it or not, that's the way a lot of guys would view it.  Do you want your crush to run to you and use you up?  Or do you want to know that he respects you?|`|ShatBd6Oaa	Depends on what you mean by "risque". What kind of lingerie? <br>  <br>  By using the text function, you are "publishing" the picture.

If he's a crush, the risk goes up even more.  <br>  <br>  Never post, e-mail or text any picture that you wouldn't want a bunch of creepy guys to see.  'Cuz that's who's going to see it.  If you do ever take racy pictures for a paramour, make sure that there is an understanding that no one else sees them, and that you get them back if you break up.|`|0aebc3da094dcd85852e8ef94004b113aa	NEVER SEND IT!

Your crush may not be reciprocated and you will end up looking desperate and uncool.<br>  <br>  ADDED:<br>  <br>  Even with your explanation, my opinion still stands.  He's asking because he can get girlie pictures from you, not because your feelings are mutual.  It still smacks of trying real hard to snag someone and he's taking advantage.

hl4kkvXhaa	OK, a voucher is like a receipt.  It is a document that shows proof of a business transaction.  It is a written document that shows things such as receipt of payment or intent to pay upon the completion of a job.<br>  <br>  A coupon is basically a form of credit.  Say, for instance you have a coupon that gives you a discount for an item...they can be issued by the government for school funding, or as many people here use, coupons to discount the cost of things such as food, personal, or cleaning items.  They give you a certain amount or percentage off of the product or service you are purchasing.<br>  <br>  A token is often in coin form, unlike vouchers or coupons.  You pay for them to be used for whatever their intended purpose.  For example, video game arcades and carnivals (fairs and circuses) often allow you to buy tokens to be used for the "coin slots" of the arcade games, or for other types of games.  Tokens are also commonly used to pay for things such as the subway.<br>  <br>  I hope this makes sense.|`|t9XVzeRMaa	Yes! And No!<br>  <br>  They're all similar, but not entirely interchangeable, although to some degree they are. <br>  <br>  Isn't English fun?<br>  <br>  Vouchers and tokens are usually exchanged for goods and services, whereas coupons generally just mean you'll get a discount or something.|`|BYvAivz1aa	voucher and token do.|`|T5DbLLgQaa	Voucher and coupon are meaning the same thing but token is a different thing so that does not belong here.

If you are trying to follow the OT Sabbath, then you should NOT go to church (or go anywhere).  You should stay inside your home.<br>  <br>  See Exodus 16:29<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  <br>  Some of the Biblical restrictions on the 7th day Sabbath are you may not light a fire (Exodus 35:3), you may not cook (Exodus 16:23), you may not go out from your home (Exodus 16:29), you may not labor (Exodus 20:10, 31:14-15, 34:21), you may not carry a load/burden (Nehemiah 13:19; Jeremiah 17:21-22). The penalty for Sabbath violation is death (Exodus 31:14-15, 35:2; Numbers 15:35-36). The SDA does not follow the Biblical Sabbath restrictions or penalty. The SDA only keeps the Sabbath to the extent that it is culturally convenient; they have changed everything about it except for the day it is kept.  The Bible makes no distinction regarding the Law – that some parts are "ceremonial" as the Ellen White claims, a claim designed to avoid truly keeping the Law in its entirety.<br>  <br>  However, there is nothing wrong with corporate worship on Saturday.  In fact, the church I used to go to a church that met on Saturday afternoons (for practical reasons not related to Sabbath keeping legalism).   The problem that I have with the SDA is that they make keeping the Sabbath a salvation issue.|`|239f0ef98b65c819dacad5a9908c975aaa	No, it is not.<br>  <br>  Saturday, the 7th day of the week, is the Jewish Sabbath.<br>  <br>  Christianity follows that the "Lord's Day" is the 1st day of the week, Sunday, in remembrance of the day Christ rose from the tomb.<br>  <br>  Take a look at Acts 20:7 <br>  On the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul began talking to them, intending to leave the next day, and he prolonged ...<br>  <br>  Over and again in the NT it refers to gathering on the 1st day of the week. To "Break Bread" is not just an ordinary meal, but part of liturgical worship which is called today the Eucharist, or the Lord's Supper, or simply "Communion".|`|cpOtr6Thaa	That's a debate I'm not getting into because I can and do worship God whenever and wherever I want.  I'm not confined to church worship/learning because my relationship with God is all day, every day.  God doesn't demand or put limits on our relationship.  He loves me as I am and accepts what I give Him.  He wants my honesty and authenticity.|`|AA10674998	wrong. <br>  read your own reference. <br>  it says nothing about church.<br>  it is a day of rest not a day of worship, for every day is a day of worship, but only one is a day of rest.|`|af0c1c1af76216033b8b22ff17b4c007aa	Yes, I've known that all my life.

Christians meet on Sunday to remember the resurrection of Christ and Pentecost which both happened on Sunday. Within weeks, thousands of Jews gave up their theological tradition.<br>  <br>  In Genesis, the Sabbath was a celebration of God's work in creation (Genesis 2:2-3, Exodus 20:11). <br>  <br>  After Exodus, the Sabbath expanded to a celebration of God's deliverance from oppression in Egypt (Deuteronomy 5:15)<br>  <br>  As a result of the resurrection, the Sabbath again shifted once again. It became a celebration of the "rest" we have through Christ who delivers us from sin and the grave.(Hebrews 4:1-11).<br>  <br>  Colossians 2:16-17  Therefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink, or with regard to a religious festival, a New Moon celebration or a Sabbath day.  (17)  These are a shadow of the things that were to come; the reality, however, is found in Christ.|`|4OjLMQ6Yaa	I don't see why it matters when people worship, especially when those who don't beleive in the same thing decide to pinpoint this as something as "wrong" with Christianity.<br>  <br>  I think people should stop focusing so much on the when's and where's other people worship their chosen deity(ies). It has no effect on my life that a Christian worships on Sundays...or Wednesdays & Sundays. Let them have at it.|`|LJlaHLQdaa	Yes... <br>  <br>   On the tables of the law, written with the finger of the infinite God, is the fourth commandment. Does the commandment read, "The first day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God?"--No, it reads: "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested [the first day?] the seventh day; wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day; and hallowed it." Thus it reads today in the sacred law as engraven by the finger of God, and thus it is preserved in the ark in the temple of God in heaven.<br>  <br>  1. John Chapter 1 <br>  <br>  1:3 That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship [is] with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ. <br>  <br>  1:6 If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:  <br>  <br>  1:7 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin. <br>  <br>   No man should take up the work of a minister of Jesus Christ until he has complied with the invitation, "Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls. " God's ministers are to show forth in their lives the unselfish love which Christ constantly taught and perfectly exemplified. Thus is to be shown the marked distinction between those who love God and keep His commandments, and those who are standing under the black banner of Satan.<br>  <br>    No man can separate fellowship with God from a life of holiness. Sanctification takes in the whole being. To walk in the light is to know and obey the truth. To have fellowship with God is to treat one another as children of God. "If we say that we have fellowship with Him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth; but if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sin."|`|yoPNXiluaa	Well, I know some people who cover all the basis and go to church everyday.
de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Just to clarify: No one is "for" or "pro" abortion, we are Pro Choice, that's one and two, I agree with you, the so called "pro life" folks are rude nasty inconsiderate and pig headed, obviously no woman WANTS an abortion but sometimes circumstances dictate otherwise. Finally, no one has the right to tell anyone else what to do in a situation like this.|`|F4k68ilkaa	Yes, I think it's rude.<br>  <br>  For anyone to forcibly bludgeon another with their own beliefs about an issue, saying that anything else is absolutely wrong, and not even entertaining other viewpoints, is incredibly rude, no matter what the topic.|`|LykjWv6faa	Just to say from the start, I am pro-life. But, I do agree with you, some people who are pro-life can leave nasty, rude comments. It reminds me of some Catholics. If you don't believe in something, you're already doomed to 'go to hell'. No one has the right to judge anyone. I'm pro-life for a reason: I myself believe that it is murder, no matter what form. And if you don't agree with me, be my guest. It all boils down to just an opinion/belief anyway.|`|b1eacc63c481ff40082f035f83d011d1aa	You show a lot of passion for what you said ...<br>  ... and the passionate objectors have let their emotions speak first before they think about it.<br>  <br>  After all, if they weren't passionate, they would have just read the question and moved on without answering.<br>  <br>  Personally, I try to accept other religions, but I draw the line at those that practise Human Sacrifice.|`|bO2rzfISaa	Yes. It is legal. People act like it's absolute murder (and they don't mind saying so). As though there were no possible reason it would be acceptable.<br>  <br>  I think if you are pro-life you should adopt a minority special needs child. Put your money and your time where your mouth is.<br>  <br>  EDIT: So, Jezebel, how many adopted children do you have?|`|6f812b070bb6a7494447f70abb1119fdaa	Some people just want to have a say in what others do.  They will not allow differing opinions or viewpoints.  It's their way or it's the wrong way.  I would hate to have someone like that in my life--busybodies always seeking drama and affirmation.  <br>  <br>  Every person has their own set of values derived from differing sources.  Religions, cultures, experiences, etc., all create the sum and substance of an individual.  An individual created by a different set of circumstances has no idea what they are talking about with regard to someone else and really need to stay out of it.  Most of them convince themselves that it's only stupid teens who should be force to have a baby for their slutty behavior.  To consider that responsible, committed adults using birth control encountered a failure (no birth control is 100% effective) is just not something they want to think about because it might cause them to apply logic and waver in their conviction that what they think, what they feel, what they want should be foisted upon others.<br>  <br>  The ugliest humans in this issue are those who stand in the way of a woman's reproductive right to choose.  I would certainly be a lot more inclined to bomb a crowd of them than a clinic that only wants to help people.|`|onrcmQf8aa	I'm am one of those people that are STRONGLY against abortions.  It is murder, and I don't see it any other type of way.  Abortions are being allowed later, and later into the terms in order to accomdate careless women.  <br>  <br>  The reason some anti abortion people get so crazy is because of how carefree and irresponsible people are getting about it.  Just in your post you compared it to people driving past in a car while at this very moment A Dr. somewhere is pulling out a 5 month old, and poking its head in order to "abort" it<br>  <br>  Answer me please: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AiVrY05mwGZkfHHBBxRwZ9Lsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090305063058AAcqoGP">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|420735621e1e9be7a68975c3d07d360aaa	I went on vacation once to Wisconsin Dells this is a resort area for family's.I am against abortion totally but what really ticked me off was people holding up pictures on the side of the road of dead babies after being aborted.This made me mad I started screaming at them.I mean this is a family resort and i understand getting the point across but having these pictures was very disturbing,I didn't want my kids let alone any kids having to view the graphic pictures|`|211Wwh6Laa	I agree.  I'm sort of on the fence on this one.  Personally, for me, no matter the circumstances, I would never have an abortion.  But it's not my place to tell someone else that they are evil or bad for doing it.  And I also believe that there are a lot of women out there who should be forced by the courts to undergo sterilization.  It sounds cruel, but what's more cruel?  A woman who has shown time and time again that she is abusive, neglectful, a drug addict, or prostitute being allowed to make baby after baby that will end up lost in a system that doesn't care?  Drug addicted babies being forced to endure a lifetime of serious health complications with no one to take care of them because "Mom" is out running the risk of bringing home diseases to the baby to buy her crack or heroine rather than food and clothes for her little one?  Or just taking that right completely out of the equation?  There are way too many unwanted babies in the system.  Yes, a lot of families are looking to adopt, but how many of them are adopting babies with heart, lung, and kidney problems, special needs, or STD's?<br>  <br>  Then again, it drives me insane to see pro-abortion people on their rants about being sick of paying taxes to support kids of poor parents...and how those parents should have aborted.  That's disgusting!  I tend to rip them because not everyone was poor when they had their baby...the economy sucks...and life happens.  And yeah, there is such a thing as the "working class poor" who pay their taxes that goes into taking care of their own kids via the system anyway, so that's just stupid.  So yeah, I do tend to shoot off at the mouth at those people.  :)<br>  <br>  Sorry...on a rant.  But anyway, I agree.  I'd never do it, but I would never put someone down unless they came here with the stupid logic of "I don't want to get fat...have stretch marks...or be a responsible individual who owns up to their irresponsibility".  Those are the people I do tend to express my opinion to (politely as possible, of course) and let them know that they should have thought of that when they decided not to use protection because it was "inconvenient".|`|579276f1a955ed5c170f87a86360c3b2aa	I have basically been on every area of the spectrum. I have 3 kids, I was raped and was basically forced to have a child at 13 who I gave up for adoption, I had an abortion at 16, Ive had a miscarriage and one of my sons' is developementally disabled. As I have no problem with people having their own beliefs and opinions, I do not appreciate someone telling me what I should do or belive in (Im pro choice, BTW). Its an assumption that all abortions are done because they were careless or stupid. Every situation is different. I understand that pro lifers beliefs are strong and I can handle that. But I have had the same experience as Christa as I had to explain the horrible pictures the pro lifers were displaying on a city street to my then 6 yr old son. I guess they werent too worried about all the children that were viewing those partially aborted fetuses and the effects they may have had on them. Interesting how selective their protection of children can be.
F5v5Qme0aa	While I understand what you mean by "illusions of separation", I don't think many people will.  So many of us are so tied to this reality that accepting "all" as part of yourself is a very bitter pill to swallow. <br>  <br>  Most people forgive, but don't forget. They may sincerely hold no ill  feelings, but that doesn't mean they embrace the offender as "part of their own life force" - even though you and I may believe that that to be true. The problem is that embracing all as one means taking responsibility for your own reality, and many just aren't ready to do that. <br>  <br>  Letting go is simply a way of moving on without addressing the issue - in my experience, it provides little or no closure for the parties involved.|`|OUbNSXjJaa	Letting go. This is used when we do not want to take any action or reaction after witnessing any event. Allow it to take its own normal course.<br>  <br>  Forgiving. This word is used when someone has done hurt or loss to us and we do not want to retaliate and go against by letting him go (leaving).<br>  This is what difference, I am able to guess.|`|0kcOZxZMaa	Most Religions have had a Role Model to follow as a template for behavior.<br>  <br>  Within "Christianity" we have Jesus the "Christ model".<br>  Many elect to worship this model, to embrace it and in the sense of truth they embrace themselves as the origins of all are of the One Original consciousness. In this reality there can be no seperation from the murderer but by the flesh, not higher consciousness; the point, flesh is the singular experiment of personalities of a higher nature co-mingling as a desire to exprerience this dense realm.<br>  <br>  Consider Jesus the Christ as a model. The Christ is not special in any way. He did not boast of power but spoke of humility. The Christ model known as "Jesus" the man lived many lives prior to  his proclamation of Devinity. This Christ model murdered, raped, killed, stole, and did all of the above in many-many-many lives in other reincarnational cycles. The Christ "Forgave" as he learned his own past reincarnations and acts. How can one condemn another for acts one also did? He walked the walk and therefore could talk the talk. The Christ Model came from the very den of thieves all do and learned by experience that the physical death does not mean the annihilation of his awareness, he built on that and soon began to enter the physical realm upon birth with the full awarenedd of all his past encarnations.<br>  <br>  This is the elevation of awarness making one begin to actualy know God and what that very concept means.|`|A01w1dHqaa	Befriending the one who supposedly wronged is letting go of your guilt and blame. It doesn't have to look a certain way in the physical because all minds are connected, but you will know when it is gone(more later).Letting go of him is an attack known as passive aggressiveness. This is part of the destructive dance of codependent relationships.<br>  <br>  With God's eyes, which he will give you, all brethren are as perfect as when created. When a "mistake" is made you bless the person and let it, the false image, go. The Holy Spirit will show you the real one. You know you are looking at it when you are in joy.|`|aZUszuqLaa	I believe letting go is more powerful that forgiving.  Forgiving doesn't mean forgetting.  Letting go means, yes, the ties that bind are severed, which then means there is nothing to forgive.  It means there is no more thought of the perceived action.  Letting go means you have released it from your mind and given it up to God to take care of it, and nothing more is required on your part.|`|izY3JNhqaa	Totally different topics IMHO.<br>  <br>  Letting go to me is tossing things up to God and letting Him/Her sort it out.  <br>  <br>  Forgiving is when you overlook someone else's transgressions in an effort not to judge, or to ignore something done by a "friend".|`|gHSarVD1aa	Grand idea.<br>  Now let's try it out, shall we?<br>  Go to you nearest large city unless you are already there. Ask around to see if there are any murderers you can embrace your spirit with.<br>  <br>  Let us know how that works out for you.<br>  <br>  I forgive because I have been forgiven. It is no deeper then that nor does it need to be.|`|3Hf3YtyKaa	Let go means that you are not allowing yourself to be bothered by it..but you are still angry or upset with the person<br>  Forgiving means that you are no longer mad at the person but you may always keep what happened in the back of your mind|`|yTAXDL5Jaa	I think you can forgive, but that does not make the pain go away and it may seem as if you have not forgiven the person adn can confuse you into wondering if you really forgave that person or not.|`|AA12391873	Letting go and forgiveness are both concepts that attempt to describe the behavior of one untroubled by the cares of the world. One cannot get to that place by simply doing the same things and emulating the behavior of others. <br>  <br>  That being said, forgiveness is the awareness that there truly is nothing to forgive. It is a knowing, you can't take credit for it because it is not something you do.<br>  <br>  Letting go is a decision to move beyond the need to judge and hold accountable others or self for what is unchangeable or out of your control. Letting go is necessary in order to move forward in life.|`|L8zmQS8Jaa	One might question what right you have to "forgive" someone.  Isn't there an implication of a superior attitude?  Perhaps it was their "duty" to give you a hard time so that ultimately you would come to a new understanding.  As adults we might look with amusement at the child who "forgives" his parents for making him brush his teeth and not letting him have candy before he goes to bed.  We have to ask when is "forgiveness" simply not taking responsibility for our wrong actions?  It is very very difficult for us to get beyond a self central point of view.   But this other perspective does exist.  <br>  <br>  Forgiveness requires some knowledge of what is right or proper or good.  Religion will often "step up to the plate" to provide this answer.  How do we presume that knowledge?  Is the "Murderer" who kills the man who would have destroyed the world "wrong."  Does he need to be forgiven?  And if so for what and what not.  What if "the man" was destroying a "world" of bacteria in a petri dish?  What if that bacteria could have cured cancer in humans ... or if it could have destroyed all life?  But what if he didn't know....and on and on?  Things might not be so simple as we first imagine them with our self central perspective and limited knowledge.  So I would suggest that only one who knows all and cares about nothing or everything (ie has no bias) can truly forgive.  We might only approximate and can sometimes do poorly at that.  <br>  <br>  But things do happen to us that seem beyond our ability to understand.  "Why is that dead man lying in the street with the blood all around?"  "Why did that person cut me off?"  "Why did my boss yell at me?"  Some answers we may never fully know.  Still we have to move on with our lives.  We cannot become so fixated on a certain thing that seems wrong that we cannot go on to what is right.  We have to move on, let go and forget.<br>  <br>  There is "forgiving" and "forgetting" (letting go.)  Often it is easier for us to do one or the other.  Both are required to truly get to the other side of troublesome issues.  <br>  <br>  Maybe it is a halfway house to forgive and forget the issue but not the lesson.  <br>  <br>  Ultimately even this must be surrendered to making the experience part of the resources of your inner Pilot.  Then we only have to learn to listen to that voice for guidance and not be troubled with forgiving, forgetting, or learning lessons that will make us suspicious, cautious, callous, concerned, or reluctant in any new situation.  (Which are all a kind of partial blindness and tends to make us prejudicial.)<br>  <br>  But these are "pie in the sky" ways of looking at the world for some and we can only do the best with the capacities that we have and hope to expand them as best as we are able.|`|Oxbq2uJtaa	I just asked a question about this much less directly and I sincerely hope most who answered here will help me out in looking up my question.  Really I just asked about love and this letting go or forgiving.  I suspect I need to let go. <br>  <br>   When love is involved this takes everything on another spiritual level, don't you think?  I mean intimate love.  I agree with a lot said here but when  a person you are loving walks away and chooses to admire some one else  (and refrain from spending time with you) even though they have just loved you and feel that they love you -...are you to forgive this and carry on in love?  <br>  <br>  Doesn't this mean  they could come back to you at anytime, apologize and get more love, more intimate sharing and then walk away again but because you are loving them, and forgiving they can come back anytime they would like to.  - the Forgiving scenario<br>  <br>   and so you let go of the love.  Because this is not exactly just perceived offense it is the giving and giving with out end or regard for that love.   It is not healthy.  But if you truly love, how do you let go? set it down,  lay it aside and so on....love is love and one can not change that or reform it. <br>  <br>   I see both scenarios as possibly not the best  and yet-...nor to carry on this love in anyway the best so I almost am perceiving a time when letting go or forgiving is not the path but there is no clear path.|`|Z4avhg3eaa	From my perspective, there is a subtle difference between letting go and forgiving. <br>  <br>  Letting go--applies to events<br>  Forgiving--applies to people<br>  <br>  Letting go--recognizing the past is a burden and putting the burden down<br>  Forgiving--recognizing that the aversion you feel toward the other person is a burden and putting that burden down.<br>  <br>  Letting go and forgiving are part of the same process of non-attachment, but as you can see, they are slightly different and serve slightly different purposes. <br>  <br>  When you forgive, you don't necessarily "close the gap" between you and the other person.  That is the role of lovingkindness.  Forgiveness is simply letting go of the burden of anger and hurt. Forgiveness does not mean you forget what happened.  Kindness, letting go, and forgiveness must all be balanced with wisdom, or else you'll find yourself suffering over and over again needlessly.  Sometimes, the wise thing to do, forgiveness and kindness notwithstanding, is maintain a respectable distance between you and the other person.|`|VQkKUBMyaa	I guess it is open to individual interpretation but to me  - letting go means I am no longer emotionally attached to the offending thing ( I don't care anymore & have no further regard)  whereas forgiving means to be truly accepting of the offending thing or occurrence and still emotionally attached & open without reservation.|`|B4YlBDzhaa	An intersesting distinction you've had in this dialougue with you and your sister...<br>  <br>  My thoughts:<br>  <br>  1) My first dog of 30 some years ago did in fact bite me on my arm.<br>  <br>  2) My first instinct was to drop[effect] him because of the pain [cause]...I felt in my arm.<br>  <br>  3) Looking back on it now; I knew he 'bit' me.... not out of some sorta [animal-malice] but that the spot I carried him from was sore and he bit-me[effect] because of the pain [cause] he experienced from that sore.<br>  <br>  4) If I didn't in fact drop [seperate] myself because of both our pain[cause(s)] then we would be doing each other a great dis-service and both remain in unnecessary-pain indefinitely.<br>  <br>  5) But the physical-seperation[effect] that was caused thru the cause of pain; was enough distance for both of us to realize the 'other' was causing pain; me first by holding him 'wrong' and him[the dog] second by him, biting me.<br>  <br>  6) Being 'objective' as I can here, I would say #5 and the greater context above is what your sister is 'arguing' for; no matter who caused the pain/harm first is immaterial; seperation here and most-likely your sisters context may be the healthiest-option in what she's 'dealing' with; for it allows enough distance [physical or otherwise..] for both parties to heal.<br>  <br>  7) Forgiveness on the other hand; in some contexts such as 'Murder'...may very well be inappropriate.<br>  <br>  7a) A lawyer turned minister from back-home pointed out; that the forgiveness of the bible from [forgiving 70 times 7 and otherwise] of the gospels to the epistles and everything inbetween; always assumes the perpetrator/abuser is initiating the request to be forgave.<br>  <br>  7b) To forgive someone without their request; is enablement really...and I think your sister knows this 'intuitively' though may not be able to put this in words...<br>  <br>  7c) And even if the abuser/perpretrator requested firstly to be forgave by your sister; she still has every 'moral' right to not-too; in my opinion.<br>  <br>  7d) Assuming both of you are talking about situation [7b-above].. it is healthier for her to let 'him'/the abuser go for her sake not his.... for she needs to move on, yet move on without putting herself in a preventable-future circumstance, especially with the same abuser.<br>  <br>  Right?|`|ZoPtalMfaa	The ultimate point is to live in harmony. I am not trying to be intrusive, but I have a feeling this came about because you and your sister have not resolved some emotional stress with each other.<br>  <br>  If in order to live in harmony you must release emotional stress, it may come about in any way (not just forgiviness or letting go) as long as you are striving towards harmony. Using clear-cut words like "forgive" and "let go" won't accurately describe this process and doing so can actually slow you down. Only by being truly conscious will you be able to solve anything. <br>  <br>  So it really isn't as simple as just "forgiving" or "letting go".<br>  <br>  No two things in creation are the same, and the same is true for different experiences. Every problem must be solved in a different way, if only slightly so. So our next order of business is to elevate our thinking beyond structure.<br>  <br>  Also, think about what you are doing just by using words. You are taking reality, ripping it up into different words with different meanings, and putting them back together into something that you believe accurately describes what you are thinking. But in reality, much of your thought doesn't get into the words because it is creative thought rather than structural.<br>  <br>  Words do not define something by what it is, but rather by what it is not. This is why it takes so many words to explain a concept. Since concepts are such refined things, there are many things they are not. This is the same reason why pictures are worth a thousand words. You can use much finer detail in a picture than you can in a paragraph, and so you can pack more precise and more information in a smaller space and in a more pure form. <br>  <br>  We do not have to do everything using words. This is why we have the creative part of our brain. If we had to explain multidimensionality in words, we would be doing so forever. Using our creative brain we can think in terms of what is, rather than what is not, and so we can process things sooooooo much faster. <br>  <br>  Many of the questions you ask, Sirius, I believe can't always be adequately explained in words. We are supposedly halfway towards the 4th dimension in general, so we had better act like it. That means that some of what we experience can't be put into words! Words are physical. They don't go very far after the 3rd dimension, I think. <br>  <br>  Anyways, this isn't really a direct answer to your question, but more or less my thoughts on the subject.<br>  <br>  Bonsai|`|o0BdXbwpaa	Letting go is just not brooding on something. Forgetting it, putting it out of your mind.<br>  <br>  Forgiveness is MUCH more difficult. I struggle with that one every day. <br>  <br>  I think much of this ties into things that we normally don't include in our analysis of how our mind works. When we are feeling happy and fulfilled and not wanting anything, then it is much easier to forgive others and when we are feeling unhappy or tense we tend to be totally reactivce and unable to forgive. And many other unconscious factors as well determine how we manifest in any given moment.|`|6dL7UGvfaa	There is hardly any difference, behaviourally. There might be some difference in other inner dimensions especially since you pose the question to eke out the difference! In which case I would be rather on the side of your sister.<br>  <br>  Forgiving has a tinge of ego attached, one assuming ownership of the situation and condescending to pardon the other! Letting go is just be with the things as they are without the addition of mind/ego. Letting go is non-interfering, less egoistic, believing in and accepting the wisdom of Nature As It Is. Forgiving is more egoistic, interfering with the ongoing flow of reality to mark what is good and bad ( a value judgment , a fiction of the mind ) and pick the bad to forgive. What arrogance! What high handedness!<br>  <br>  In the analogy of the dog leashed/unleashed, it is leashed o because we want to make the dog in our image and hug that image and divide it as OK and not Ok and forgive not OK! Whereas, when unleashed, it mingle freely with all the elements of Nature, letting go self as well as all other with which it connects, in gay abandon, joining in the dance of nature/cosmic dance, partaking in the agony and ecstasy of it and move with it. Letting go permits  the flow faster, forgiving is bound by the forgiver, a sole individual whereas in letting go, it is subject only to the great Cosmic Order/Whole; Good is not evaluated and prescribed here, it is already in Good/Wisdom and it flows with it.

3E2EQH12aa	thats a great idea|`|4854FMZjaa	Better to say "Let your Belief Save U" .|`|Bb6fQtl0aa	"The Scholars of Ahlus Sunnah’s position towards the Raafidah Shee’ah"<br>  <a href="http://abulhaarith.wordpress.com/2008/08/20/ahlus-sunnahs-position-towards-the-raafidah-sheeah/" rel="nofollow">http://abulhaarith.wordpress.com/2008/08...</a><br>  <br>  ---<br>  (pardon the length, I hope this is found to be beneficial)<br>  <br>  The reason why the Shi'a are not accepted nor reconciled with is because they have introduced beliefs and practices into Islam that were never taught by the Prophet, peace be upon him, never taught by his family, or his companions. Rather they have changed Islam from it's original perfected form and thusly, innovated a way of life that leads to Hellfire. This is not a dispute between a trivial "this" and "that", it is a serious issue dealing with the difference between the Straight Path to Paradise and the crooked paths that lead to punishment in this life and the next. May Allaah rectify our condition and affairs.<br>  <br>  With regards to Shee'ism, then it is not the Islam that was taught by Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him. Rather, they are a group that have exaggerated the status of the noble family of the Prophet, peace be upon him, to the extent that they build shrines devoted to their worship along with Allaah. This is shirk, polytheism, the greatest crime a human being can commit in the sight of Allaah.<br>  <br>  The proper way to practice Islam is to follow the understanding of the Qur'aan and the Prophetic life example that was actually taught by Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, and actually lived by the Prophet, peace be upon him, his family, and his companions.<br>  <br>  All beliefs and acts of worship that oppose this way are affairs that lead away from Paradise and lead towards Hellfire.<br>  <br>  It is not permissible to worship Allaah with acts of worship that did not exist in the time of the Prophet, peace be upon him (such as pilgrimage to Karbala, calling upon 'Ali or other human beings for help who are dead or absent, building shrines dedicated to saints, etc...) And it is not permissible to interpret the Qur'aan with meanings that oppose what the Prophet, peace be upon him, actually taught.<br>  <br>  Remember, the main goal of every Muslim is to enter Paradise and to avoid torment in the Hellfire. The main goal is not unity in this life for the sake of "unity". If the Shee'ah have chosen for themselves a path to destruction, then it is not in any Muslim's interest to "unite" with them. Rather the sincere Muslim should advise them to return to the right guidance that Allaah created us and them for, and if they refuse, then other Muslims should be warned against falling into their severe errors. By this way, with Allaah's permission, we preserve the correct practice of Islam for ourselves and for future generations who seek to worship Allaah correctly.<br>  <br>  Whether the Shia' as a whole will repent and return to the Straight Path...? Allaah knows best. This splitting amongst the Muslims is a test from Allaah to see who will sincerely and correctly follow His religion. He guides whom He wills and He leaves to stray whom He wills and Allaah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.<br>  <br>  ADDITIONAL NOTE: "Fitnah" Makers?<br>  <br>  It is oppression to call a Muslim who clarifies the difference between true Islam and deviant ideologies a "fitnah" maker. The people responsible for making "fitnah" are those who alter the pure religion of Allaah and turn it to something that leads our brothers and sisters to Hell.<br>  <br>  If I knew someone who was in danger of being murdered, would I be considered a "fitnah" maker if I were to alert that person to danger? No. I would not be considered a fitnah maker, even if the murderer was a Muslim.<br>  <br>  And innovation in religion and the threat of Hellfire is more serious a danger to a person than murder and thusly a Muslim has more right to be warned against it in the clearest terms possible.|`|24ff965b698b01fab680ef159e41f361aa	ha ha , nice answer..and totally fine by me..<br>  <br>  its really irritating to see those type of questions but i guess we are just gonna have to live with it..|`|9BfI7N55aa	I'm also in the fever of unity in Ummah|`|D4xmy588aa	Do you say with your tongue what is not in your heart?|`|xtI9RmNZaa	I totally agree with you.|`|f7l3Y8Ybaa	allah akbar|`|RLQpyK3Jaa	LOL !!!<br>  <br>    Very funny, but, we can't call people out of their names (no nicknames).|`|whkC5077aa	Okay, not bad.
ejbSFv0caa	I have plenty of friends who for now are inclined toward not believing in a deity.  I only ask of them what I do myself - I keep an open mind on the possibilities.<br>  <br>  Yes, there are some basics I have come to accept as rock solid belief, but they are based upon my direct personal experience.  I do not expect others who have not had those experiences to accept my word on it.  Sadly in R&S there are too many of those sort of atheists who having closed their minds, they believe the world will fit their hypothesis.  The closed mind leads to bigotry, and that in turn to the risk of hostility.<br>  <br>  In a crisis the only considerations I have for another person's belief structure is ....<br>  <br>  1] Does their belief hinder what I am trying to achieve?<br>  2] Does it alter how we work together?<br>  3] Has this person the flexibility to treat myself and other theists with respect? Or do they exhibit a willingness to allow others their beliefs without trying to ram their [lack of] understanding down everyone else's throats.<br>  <br>  Providing they can do [3] then I am prepared to discuss [2] to avoid [1]<br>  <br>  Failing that I will either force the issue if I have the authority or ask them to step aside and allow someone more flexible to replace them.<br>  <br>  I do not hold a blanket opinion of theists, nor do I hold one of atheists, or Agnostics.  Overgeneralising can create issues where there needs not be any.  In my experience only a few atheists are so pigheaded, and I have met more than my fair share of theists who are equally bigoted.|`|12404275a6e62a47f2d36bd0fb0e6886aa	When hordes of volunteers and relief workers descend upon places such as New Orleans, Sri Lanka, New York City,  the southern coastal states after hurricanes, earthquake zones, war torn countries,  etc  ...  I doubt one's beliefs are asked prior to participation in relief operations. <br>  <br>  I didn't intend  to appear flippant, but without a doubt, people of all beliefs have come together numerous times over the course of history to lend a helping hand. That is the beauty of humanity. In times of adversity, most of us put aside our differences to do the right thing.<br>  <br>  On a smaller scale, my kids and I work alongside (and, in fact, inside)  a church filled with Christians  helping to  feed the hungry. We take part in their prayers, and every other aspect of volunteering. They are not bothered by our lack of belief, and we are not bothered by their praising God. To each his own. When a job needs done, those who are able "just do it."|`|nw0fqXj9aa	I'm very certain that in any of the past natural disasters, there have been atheists and theists working side by side.

I like them, they like me, it's all good.  And yes, they know I'm an atheist -- even in the small, conservative, largely christian town where I live, it's almost never an issue.<br>  <br>  This forum is a place to discuss religious issues...in everyday life, most of us (christians and other theists included) rarely spend our day arguing about religion.  We're too busy making a living, taking care of our families, and just getting through the day.  <br>  <br>  When it *does* come up in "real life" is when there's an issue at hand on which we're divided.  Despite what you see here, that honestly doesn't happen that often...but it does happen.  I attended a school board meeting recently, mainly because a group of evangelicals had announced they were going to attend and petition the school board to teach biblical creationism as an "alternative" in science classes -- that I won't stand for.  One of the evangelicals on the "other side" was one of my regular clients...and despite our differences, he still is a regular client.  I didn't like what he had to say, he didn't like what I had to say -- but when the meeting was over (and they were soundly defeated), we shook hands and remained cordial.  <br>  <br>  People in general tend to be less confrontational and abusive when dealing face to face...the "anonymity" of an internet forum like this one removes the social constraints to extreme opinions, so things get a lot wilder here than they usually do in real life :)<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|G9dZN8omaa	I would be willing to come together.

Why let insignificant differences conflict with greater things that we have in common - like being humans!? The greatest thing we have is our ability to cooperate/work together - this is where practically all of human advances have come from.

I certainly hope that some part of me will continue existence after death, but all I can do right now is speculate.<br>  <br>  I will say, though, that if an afterlife really does exist, I would hope that it's reincarnation.

After he is arrested, he is whipped severly. Do you know what they used as a whip back then? It wasn't your ordinary whip that you see nowadays, it was a leather whip dipped in tar, then they stuck glass, shards of metal, and many other things to it. When that whip hit your skin, it would stick, and the person torturing you would litterally have to yank it off of you, your skin with it. Your skin would tear back, revealing your muscles. Now imagine that happening 39 times. Then they take this innocent man, and shove a crown of thorns on his head. but they have to make sure it stays, so they stick it deeply into your skull, burrowing into your skin. After this, they put a robe on you. No doubt after it sticks to your wounds from the flogging well enough, they ripped it off, opening your wounds all over again. After this they make you walk miles with a large, extremely heavy piece of wood on your back, which is still extremely wounded, by the way. On this walk, you get whipped for taking to long, stopping, etc. People spit on you and ridicule you as well, a person that has done nothing. Once you finally get to your death bed, they hold you down and shove nails through your hands and feet. This innocent man is barely visible through all the blood. And the most horrible part; it is not the blood loss that kills you, or the nails, or anything like that. Everytime you have to breath, you have to use those nails to pull yourself up. The spikes that drill your hands, you have to put all of your weight on them just to get another breath. Soon you are to weak to do it, and you just suffocate. After all of that, they shove a spear into your side. All to an innocent man.<br>  <br>  A childrens story? I don't think so.

The Watchtower invented this idea of two classes of Christians.  <br>  <br>  The Watchtower two-class doctrine is based on a strained application of Jesus' statement regarding the "other sheep" in John 10.

He was simply preparing his disciples for this fact.|`|PEUwnGHraa	This One is Correct:<br>  <br>  At one time I was a devout defender and one of Jehovah's Witnesses but I have realized over the past 6 years, and even more so over the past 4 to 5 months, that this organization is American made, and made up by white people.<br>  <br>  Did you know that JW's would not allow Black people to be a part of their organization because they felt Black people were too inferior and were not worthy to their publications? If this religion is "the truth" like they like to proclaim it is the one and only true religion, then why would they ban Black people from being a part of their orgnanization? Would All Mighty, Loving "Jehovah" God be a racist? I don't think so for it is them that has committed the racism, and today do you see their publications? All the Bible characters are very white skin or more white than not, with blonde and brunette hair -- no dark skinned or Black people and with the bluest of eyes in many cases? This organization is a "business entity" and nothing less; and a cult.<br>  <br>  I have done some research on this organization to see just how they started and although they like to boast about Rutherford who I have learned based his "revelation" on how angels enlightened him, and how he said that "invisible spirits transmitted the interpretations, as well as organized instructions audibly in his mind. He claimed they were not spiritism. <br>  <br>  Rutherford also stated during a 1987 talk: "Enlightened proceeds from Jehovah... and is given to the faithful annointed... the remnant are instructed by the angels of the Lord. The remnant do not hear audible sounds, because such is not necessary. Jehovah has provided his own good way to convey thoughts to the minds of his annointed ones". Rutherford is a spirit medium and what does the Bible counsel on such ones --- even their (JW's) own Bible?<br>  <br>  Deuteronomy 18: 10 - 11: There should not be found in you anyone ... who consults a spirit medium or a professional foreteller of events or anyone who inquires of the dead"... Yet look at Rutherford himself, and a white, prejudice liar in his own right.<br>  <br>  Also, they keep very criminal actions committed by their own clergy (ministerial servants, elders, etc.) and other members of their congregations a secret from authorities so the guilty go unpunished and the abused continue getting abused. They have also had to settle many lawsuits and pay "hush money" to keep their bad behavior "secret".

This has happened to me 3 times in the past 4 years, and it happens often time to others not only in my kingdom hall but nation and worldwide.<br>  <br>  The HEAVENLY CLASS??? In my small congregation there were 4 (that's right FOUR) of the annointed class, those with the seal of the lamb on their foreheads --- those of the "heavenly class". I got to wondering how can it be that out of all of the 144,000 worldwide, that go to heaven, a whopping 4 of them, the annointed class, were directly from my small town and kingdom hall?? I am in Oregon and this has caused some concern for me over the years but I just let it go because I was always taught "If you have to wonder if you're of the heavenly class, those that have the heavenly hope, or go to heaven" then you are not of that class.... simply because you had to wonder if you were???<br>  <br>  Some witnesses are very good people thinking they are doing right and pleasing God, but God has been telling me all along to watch out and "get out". The ones that are truly good people don't know what goes on behind closed doors as it were and they didn't do their research on how the witnesses "GOT STARTED", and they also truly think they are doing the right thing... but this was their make up before they joined the organization, for these ones were always good people anyway. I hope they learn soon enough and to "get out" before it ruins them like it has done me. <br>  <br>  Now I am picking up the pieces. I feel alone -- like I have lost all my family, but then they were not really my family; it was truly a waste of time and energy to finally learn what scammers they are. Beware, just beware.

I would guess, because many of the billion muslims around the world are black, the muslims support their black brothers and sisters in faith, similar to how muslims all over the world are supporting their Palestinian brothers and sisters in Gaza (even though only 17% of the muslims in the world are Arab).

Are you Bi or are you in denial and are actually gay?<br>  <br>  Regardless of this, if he is your best friend and you don't think it will hurt your friendship with him then tell him.  If it does ruin your friendship then he wasn't a very good friend to begin with.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|tL5YbnWjaa	If he's your best friend and you can't tell him, you should find another best friend. Definitely tell him to not tell others but you should be able to talk about it with your best friend.|`|zEoRcL91aa	Why this obsession with sex?

HEaEA9ayaa	It amazes me that people view this god as loving.<br>  Imagine if I gave my children a choice like this.<br>  What a prick I would be!<br>  You can't do whatever you want if you belive in this god, it's worship him for the brief time that your ape man body lives-or be tortured for eternity.<br>  F-him!|`|jDY8KsvTaa	Awesome question.<br>  <br>  I guess that, even though belief in a deity is supposed to be a prerequisite for answering this, I'll hazard a guess at the theistic response:<br>  <br>  God gave man freedom to choose.  Churches (run by men, who are inherently flawed) are the ones trying to limit those choices.  However, the men running those churches are well-intentioned since they are trying to "save your soul" and therefore doing you a favor by preaching to you incessantly about burning in hell.|`|AA11424947	Free will is not a function of God. God is irrelivant in reference to what human beings do based on what freedom we have on the earth. In case you haven't noticed, God does not come down with thunderbolts and stop human beings from doing those things that are obvious evils. God does not "approve" or "disapprove" by creating what negative consequences might occur for exercising your free will. That's more like Karma. <br>  <br>  That being said, what makes you so sure that when you choose to do something by virtue of your own free will, and you receive negative consequences for doing it, this is God's fault? Even if you chose to deliberately do evil and after death you end up in hell, this is not necessarily God's doing. What too many people don't seem to understand is how much courage you need to truly take reponsibility for your behavior.<br>  <br>  ...and BTW, one does not "play God" by exercising free will.|`|r3TYEHMbaa	Like anything else in life, you have choices. There are right choices. There are wrong choices.<br>  <br>  You have laws. You can obey the law. You can disobey the law. Disobeying the law leads to fines, jail, or prison. You can do whatever you want provided the law allows. If you choose to disobey the law, you pay the penalty.<br>  <br>  You have bills to pay. You can pay your bills. You can choose to not pay your bills. Not paying your bills leads to collections, utility shut-offs, or eviction. You can do whatever you want provided the creditors allow. If you choose to not pay your bills, you pay the penalty.<br>  <br>  Honestly, I don't see what is so hard to understand. <br>  <br>  Free will means freedom to make a choice. Choice means responsibility for that choice. <br>  <br>  If you can't accept responsibility for your choices, then don't demand the right to make those choices.|`|uLYlQMs3aa	Its not about freedom. We have the right to choose.. this is true. Just as children have the right to choose. But when they choose wrong they get disciplined from their parents. Same with God and his children, Humanity.<br>  Why wouldn't you want to follow God. Even if you just followed the ten commandments imagine how incredible this world would be. That alone is Awesome. Everything God has made has been perfect in its creation. Everything wrong with the world today is where man's bumbling hands have touched it. <br>  We have proven time and again that we cannot Govern ourselves. We can not lead ourselves. We have no idea how to choose our leaders. Look at our presidency for the last 50+ years alone. These guys are nuts. They aren't leaders, they are thieves, liars and murderers. And yet we blame God. We take him out of our schools force him out of our government and then wonder why society has gone to hell n a hand basket. We force him out of our lives then complain about his lack of involvement. <br>  Its psychotic. Completely insane, seriously. He has given us a path to live our lives in absolute peace and true happiness. And we still time and again choose to live in hate, pain and fear. No wonder he is going to relieve us of this horrible life we have chosen. Some of us will get to experience God's utopia. Others will have to make their choice at the judgment seat.<br>  Either way God's will shall stand not ours. Free will is an illusion, just like our children's free will. In the end you do what you are told to do.<br>  Hope this helps and bring on the thumbs down baby!!|`|PR28wVHzaa	This a great question. I don't understand this need to obey something. If you read some of the responses it's almost like a "Star Trek" episode where people live in Nirvana, but there is always some catch.<br>  <br>  Some first born must be sacrificed <br>  <br>  Robot voice - "IT IS HIS WAY OR THE HIGHWAY"|`|uD8d5V9Saa	This has to do with eternal life.  God cannot be with sin.<br>  God sent Jesus to die in our place.  The catch is we must believe that Jesus is our Lord and Savior.  It is so simple but so many people refuse it.  <br>  If you would open your heart and mind to God, He would come in and show you the truth.|`|Zgs4RncIaa	Quite simple, God wants you to come to Him at your free will. Or you can live your life the way you want (free will) but as everything in life the consequence for living the way you want is being condemned too Hell.|`|gGmMw2vDaa	True christians are not supposed to think so deeply.|`|3d7f120f2bf9906d7333799542b3a295aa	The reality is that God exists, a long time after and a long time before your existence.  And if he is your source of being, and this is his universe, then the choice he gives you is whether you want to be with him or against him.<br>  <br>  Where were you when the universe came into existence?  Did you decide what laws and principles would govern?<br>  <br>  Wanting to play God is the choice that separates us from Him, the source of all life, and then we die.|`|8pQrIL90aa	My dear friend you are way off. We do what is right and come to see that god wants his children to be good. Not bad, not hardheaded and disobedient.|`|s40sgQ45aa	Sin can not enter into the kingdom of God.  Right now in the world we live the effects of sin is everywhere but it won't be that way forever.  God will cast it out.

RZetcwalaa	My favourite books used to be Harry Potter but im not a magician, little known fact:Richard Dawkins is a massive fan of religious music!<br>  <br>   I enjoy reading the bible, and i even enjoy some of the fables/teachings of the big JC it doesn't make me a christian, some people mistake appreciating religion with being religous.|`|8pQrIL90aa	"alright, so i used to be a christian but then i turned atheist"<br>  <br>  lol...man that amazes me. You were never a christian my friend. When you become a christian you will never turn away from it because you believe. You have no faith. But God is good. He will draw you back to the faith. <br>  <br>  I will say that I was unwittingly an atheist in a mild manner because I went about believing in everything else but God, but I will say that I never firmly said that there is no God. Pretty audacious to make such a statement and have no proof of what you are declaring over yourself.|`|2JbCMKNAaa	I don't believe you were a christian. God will not lose one of His own. Perhaps you were a member of a christian church and not a true born again believer. We are all born with a knowledge of God (Romans 1) and will always have an interest in Him|`|bYDVTv7Maa	If it's a good book, it's a good book.<br>  <br>  For example, I could read a book dealing with an entirely fabricated pantheon of gods, and absolutely love it.<br>  <br>  That doesn't mean I follow or worship said gods, it just means I enjoy the storyline.|`|S4XUl7qWaa	It means you have an interest in the typical dualist construct of good vs. evil, and you find those scenarios entertaining, nothing more. It's a fairly pervasive concept in western thought, so I don't know how a person living in any western country can truly escape it.|`|BMQlzUkfaa	Deep down, you know that God exists, and also Satan.  You just haven't found the one true path yet, and that's why you have turned away.|`|xkSwcCW1aa	The truth is that God wants to pull you back before its too late. Don't listen to the atheist who will tell you trash they will answer for themselves. Go back to that through part which contains the fountain of eternal life|`|pqveENjUaa	Nope. Just means religions interests you. It interests me too but I'm not a Christian. Like someone else pointed out, I like Harry Potter too but I'm not a wizard lol|`|rlWZtKx2aa	maybe it just means you have an interest in that type of book, or perhaps there is still something there tugging at you to think twice about your decision.
iHDYncuXaa	Because it's full of errors. Mostly unbiblical errors.|`|onkUcy19aa	There are many editions of the catechism because of the different emphasis in the doctrines presented. That is why, the catechism has to be edited to present an amazing picture of the Catholic Faith, showing its reasonableness, comprehensiveness, beauty and charm. The catechism is written to serve as a source book for sermons, a thorough explanation of the catechism, and a complete statement of the entire Faith. Pure, unadulterated Catholic doctrine with a clarity and thoroughness that are truly amazing!!|`|zhaHc4FAaa	The catechism is only edited to add clarity or significance to passages that already exist.   Paragraph headings were added so that certain passages would not all run together, but none of the text has been altered.
xw55lwscaa	You don't need religion. Its like the first answer, you need to know how to prove the Lord exists.<br>  <br>  Its not enough to say he exists you have to show proof and since so many lack that ability, they see no proof.|`|xo4iux9gaa	No, just faith in Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  " I am The Way, The Truth, and The Life; no man can come to the Father except through me". -- Jesus Christ (Jn. 14:6)<br>  <br>  " Neither is there salvation in any other; for there is no other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved".

lcvhhGjpaa	Personally, I don't conclude to whether a God has a physical or spirit body.  However, with regards to observable evidence, I see neither for either case.<br>  <br>  If a God created humans with no ability to perceive it, then the existence of a God is pointless as far as I am concerned, and hence I find no sensibility in attempting to seek a God in this case.<br>  <br>  Secondly, since I regard myself as true to myself, I require evidence of a God as to adhere to one. I am not a hypocrite to myself and I am not going to convince myself that something exists when I see no evidence for it. Therefore, I am not going to 'believe' there is one without evidence and I am not going to believe for belief's sake.<br>  <br>  As no evidence has been or seems likely to be forthcoming, my position remains as such.|`|8pQrIL90aa	God is not a human being. He is a omnipotent being, sapient and utterly unexplainable. <br>  <br>  His handiwork is upon all that he created, therefore thou art inexcusable O' man.|`|d2lvgxJhaa	Well he must be doing something that's observable then.  In which case an experiment could be done to detect his presence.<br>  <br>  Other than that, this idea is just the kind of make-it-up-as-you-go-along God talk that makes rational people roll their eyes.  Sure, define him out of the reach of science, but not out of existence into some convient nether-nether world.  However, in order to be taken seriously by the rational bridgade, you need evidence to raise your ideas above the level of pure bullshit.|`|G9dZN8omaa	I don't think God would have to have a physical body to prove he exists. <br>  <br>  I'd be happy seeing a ghostly body, and seeing him do something great, like cure all the sick children at Riley Hospital (or something similar).  That would probably be enough to convince me.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Does the thumbs down mean someone doesn't want sick children to be cured?  Interesting.|`|Xcri5qeTaa	Well, according to you, does God have physical body or not? State your claim, see if it's testable, and let's get some proof.|`|KT7cllsLaa	how one does think<br>  when without brain?<br>  well the bible gives us some clue, quran too<br>  but that is word of man, not invisible deities|`|2j2C44FDaa	It doesn't have to be physical, but it should be something that is irrefutably down to a god. So far everything can be explained scientifically, which means it can be tested. Even ghosts can be proven more than god. They have been caught on film, thermometres have recorded temperature fluctuations, people who claim to see them can give information about them that can be traced back and hence proved or disproved. Even though the evidence is rather circumstantial, it is more evidence than any related to gods existence.<br>  Atheists don't close their minds to the fact that there might be a god, they just haven't seen enough DECENT evidence. If there was, science could then take the existence of god(s) into consideration but as it stands there is NOTHING testable or even remotely unexplainable, so for now I have to agree that there is no god but the one in people's heads. I.e made up.|`|OeAfpIZAaa	Naturalism is a philosophical position that all phenomena can be explained in terms of natural causes and laws. In its broadest and strongest sense, naturalism is the metaphysical position that "nature is all there is and all basic truths are truths of nature. "This is generally referred to as metaphysical or ontological naturalism. Another basic form, called methodological naturalism, is an epistemological method of proofing hypotheses. It requires that hypotheses are explained and tested by reference to natural causes and events. Yet another form of naturalism is the idea that the methods of science should be used in philosophy. Science and philosophy, according to this view, are said to form a continuum and, hence, the same methods apply to both. W.V. Quine, George Santayana, and others have advocated this view. Any method of inquiry or investigation or any procedure for gaining knowledge that limits itself to natural, physical, and material approaches and explanations can be described as naturalistic<br>  <br>  I guess that's the view.|`|SSsCOIrqaa	Because many think that all that exists is the physical/material world.  They reduce all thoughts, emotions, and life experiences down to physical reactions in the brain, and force everything to fit into their materialist box.  They can't think outside that box.  They're really quite limited in their intellectual abilities and are quite arrogant to think that man is the possessor of the highest intelligence in the universe and nothing can exist that we can not comprehend.  I have nothing against learning and growing in our knowledge of the world around us, but make no mistake, there are things we will never understand about ourselves and what exists around us both physically and spiritually no matter how hard we try or how much time we throw into the equation.|`|B3jvszMaaa	Have you ever heard of a thing called "The Invisible Pink Unicorn"?<br>  I can assure you that it exists, and it is in fact, pink.|`|sA7DuUUBaa	because the air worshipers said so they thought it into existence. because sky daddy said so.<br>  <br>           god bless you!|`|ro0lmK5haa	There is plenty of evidence.

W0rcm3awaa	For the record Sosta doesn't know what she's talking about, almost everything she's said is incorrect. The only thing she got was that we want to gain enlightenment in order to escape the cycle of death and rebirth, and yes reach nirvana. Otherwise everything else she said is false.<br>  <br>  In buddhism the idea is not to become too attached or grasp too much for objects outside of oneself in order to bring yourself happiness as this happiness will not bring the permanent happiness we seek and will result in more suffering. <br>  <br>  This is the only source of the idea of 'not attaching' in buddhism. Otherwise buddhists do not believe in detaching emotions, in fact buddhists are typically very happy people because they've found a place where they are always content.<br>  <br>  Also it's true that buddhists believe that it is not right to yell or cuss or any of these - as a part of 'right speech' and this can kind of correlate with stoicism.<br>  <br>  However in stocism the idea is that passionate emotions can result in an error in judgement. In buddhism they don't discourage 'passionate' emotions they discourage behavior that would hurt other people, passion is fine. Also the reasoning is different, in stocism the goal is to be clear-headed, intelligent, and logical all by not giving into passionate emotions. In buddhism the idea is that we want to conduct ourselves appropriately in order to be a good person to those around us and our community and in the end also benefiting ourselves as a member.<br>  <br>  Does this make sense? I think its possible to incoorperate it but the ideas are still slightly different. Best of luck.|`|AA12010793	It is a good thing. Buddhism encourages its followers to remove themselves from this world, detach themselves from any sentiments, feelings and emotions and empty your mind of anything material and this worldly in order to gain enlightenment and reach the ultimate goal of Nirvana, and be released from the birth and death cycle.

I thought it would be great sport to try and look for actual truth because I couldn't swallow this "perception is reality" post modern crap. I did a reality check.

0aN1xIxfaa	This urban legend brings great dishonour on God's good name and is due to biblical illiteracy. God did warn the Israelites that if they made idols to worship, they and their children would suffer dire consequences, even down to the third and fourth generation of those who hated Him. In those days, extended families meant that three or four generations would be living under the same tent or roof. So if one family unit took up idolatry and began to hate the Lord who had delivered them from slavery, that entire household would suffer badly. They would have chosen disloyalty to the covenant Lord and He would reject them.<br>  <br>  Yet notice how the sentence continues: (Exodus 20:6) "but showing love to a THOUSAND generations of those who love me and keep my commandments." If God is going to be discredited for children suffering (due to parental rejection of God), who is going to credit Him for such lavish love, to a thousand generations? Anybody who bangs on about how cruel God is to children, whilst ignoring His immense love and forgiveness, is perverting the words of God.|`|XiITTg3waa	..

Similarly if a pregnant mother drinks and meets an accident, her daughter may born with some inborn problem.<br>  <br>  But the particular child will be assisted and helped by God Almighty in many ways so as to gain his due place in the world and hereinafter.

I saw babies being boiled in water in Darfur, wonder where God was then.|`|j5YwuVEIaa	This should help you understand what the bible says regarding deformities:<br>  <br>  Why Are Some Babies Born Deformed?<br>  AFTER giving birth, the mother was told that her son had a birth defect and would soon be totally blind. The mother reported: ‘The shock caused me to start questioning God’s justice. Why should a helpless little child suffer? I looked after myself healthwise before and after pregnancy. Why did it happen to me?’ Earth wide it is estimated that one out of every 20 babies is born with some deformity. Many anguished parents wonder .?.?.<br>  Does God Cause It?<br>  Absolutely not! Though many feel that such tragedies are “God’s will” or that he is punishing the parents for some past sin, the Bible, God’s Word, shows that such is not the case.<br>  For instance, Jesus’ disciples asked why a certain man was born blind. They asked Jesus: “Who sinned, this man or his parents, so that he was born blind?” Jesus then made clear that birth defects are not a punishment from God, saying: “Neither this man sinned nor his parents.”—John 9:1-3.<br>  What Is Responsible?<br>  There is a variety of causes of birth defects. At times they occur because of a mix-up in the baby’s microscopic chromosomes or genes. This may or may not have been inherited from the parents. However, the Textbook of Medicine states: “In most malformations no major factor can be identified, and it can be presumed that their existence is due to the complicated interaction of genetic and environmental influences or to special rare genetic combinations.”<br>  Some factors believed to play a role in causing birth defects include: illness or exposure of the mother to certain diseases during pregnancy, radiation injury, chemical pollution, drugs (even some considered safe during pregnancy), excessively large quantities of some vitamins, malnutrition, improper diet, certain living conditions, age of mother, race, and even the season of birth. Frequently, wars and greedy commercialism have caused conditions that led to birth defects.<br>  On the other hand, certain actions by a parent can increase the risk of birth defects. Some lead loose and immoral lives to the detriment of their unborn offspring. The baby can be deformed because the parents contract a venereal disease or are in an incestuous relationship. Also, parents may hurt their developing fetus by indulging in narcotics and tobacco.<br>  However, the basic cause of deformed children is the disobedience of the first couple, Adam and Eve. Their sin against God caused them to lose their perfection of mind and body and produce “defective” children. Each succeeding generation progressively drifted farther away from perfection. Therefore, even if there were no adverse technology, war, malnutrition or immoral behavior, there would still be deformed children by virtue of the fact that we are born of imperfect parents.

7ea6cc5bc524e1d16da69270e362982eaa	Homosexuality isn't a practice or choice.  Sexuality, whether hetro or homo, is what and who you are.  It's a biological imperitive, not a psychological state.  By making homosexuality illegal you would be targetting the wrong people - you would be targetting the VICTIMS of hate crime.  This was one of the excuses employed by the Third Reich to help justify the relocation of the Jew.  (There goes my Godwin's Law quota for today.  Ach.)<br>  <br>  However, if it seems perfectly reasonable to outlaw homosexually based entirely on the mentality that some people commit crimes purely because of sexuality, then it would be more reasonable just to outlaw sexuality.<br>  <br>  But why stop at that?  Outlaw knives.  Then forks.  Pens and pencils; broken glass; hands for holding and arms for thrusting.  Outlaw legs for carrying, eyes for seeing, brains for thinking.  Outlaw people.  Then, just to be safe, outlaw every other primate just incase they evolve to be as malicious as mankind.  But why stop there?  Outlaw evolution entirely; ban planetary systems from forming, outlaw ecosystems from supporting life, and let's stop those pesky cells from splitting!  Let's abolish existance - it's the only way to be truly safe.<br>  <br>  The reality is that no matter what you outlaw, people will STILL break the law.  Law is just a concept - there's no guarenteed way to enforce it, because if you have free will then you have the potential to perpetrate malicious acts against other people regardless your mentality.  Let's abolish free will.<br>  <br>  Hell no.<br>  <br>  Instead, why don't we just punish the perpetrator of a crime instead of just pandering to them?  Give them automatic life for taking a life: imprisonment until dead, no parole.  Now couple that with a quality of life marginally greater than that of a caged animal: no modern conveniences.  Sure, it's a retroactive approach, but - ultimately - folk will get the message: freedom is priceless.|`|KpJSn3TKaa	Hmmmm I think you needed to pay more attention at school.

Man was made in God's image so that means in every aspect - we all have the capacity to do good and love how ever bad we may appear to others.  In my opinion the so called 'Christian' has little idea of the God he/she  believes in. If he/she reads this I suggest they open their Bible and not just read it but hear it and understand by studying and not just swallowing words.  Be reminded that Paul the Apostle, persecuted and imprisoned followers before he became a follower and by association was a murderer. In fact he  held the coats of those who stoned one of the disciple  Stephen to death - yet for some inexplicable reason - i.e. only God knows - Paul was granted a vision of the Jesus he persecuted and spent the rest of his days spreading the Gospel of Christ..The writer might say Paul came after Christ's crucifixion and therefore never persecuted him - but the Lord in a vision asked Paul "'Why do you persecute ME?".  Also on the cross beside Jesus was a thief who, as he was dying, suddenly realised who Jesus was and was told he would be with Christ in paradise. It was also written that Christ told his disciples to Go out into the world and preach the Gospel and make disciples of all men.  This is an important piece of information as far as I am concerned - as there is a missing peace that Christians don't often get!!<br>  1) Go and preach the Gospel<br>  2)  ??????<br>  3) Make disciples<br>  If this person is reading this perhaps they can try and work out what step 2 is.  In my opinion it's like a sandwich - the slices on the outside are the orders Go preach and then make disciples.  You cannot make a disciple of someone who doesn't believe.  Therefore point 2) The filling of the sandwich  is God himself - he reveals himself to those who hear and have Christ revealed to them by the Holy Spirit and then disciples are made. A  Christian should know that only the spirit of God himself can convince someone of his existence and love...no amount of talking or preaching will do this. Only God reveals himself to the soul of man.  It is also written that God waits patiently for all men i.e. humans to come to Him.  So we can gather that   1) A person can be an atheist and can - at the last breath have Jesus revealed to Him. 2)  Christ will open even the heart of a murderer like Paul to do His work. <br>  As an afterthought – many believed and some still believed that the Jews killed Jesus. In my opinion The Lord knew the stupidity and prejudices of men and in his wisdom ensured that all were involved in the Crucifixion – the Jew and the Gentile....How clever of God to ensure that all were involved not just one group. What people tend to forget or perhaps ignore is that with his dying breath Christ said – Father Forgive them for they know not what they do! We Christians believe that God always grants the requests of Christ do we not? So all those who were involved were forgiven.  It might be a hard pill for some Christians to swallow – but you can’t spit out those bits of the Bible which don’t suit your view of Christ.  History is easily lost in a small book like the Bible – even John inferred that there was more that Jesus did and said that was not written down as there was not enough space in the world to accommodate his works in writing.  The true Christian should study not only world history alongside the words in the Bible – but also geographical sites and information etc. Europeans have a rather strange view of Christ – he is depicted on the cross as a handsome –rather emaciated white man.  When in fact the bible says there was nothing in his appearance to draw people to him. I.e. he didn’t stand out from the crowd – he didn’t have superstar looks . He was a Jew and therefore would have the colour and characteristics of a Jew and blended in with those around him. What was different about him was that he preached a Gospel of love peace and forgiveness. Love thy neighbour as thyself - not love only those who believe in what you believe in!  Also being a carpenter he would have been rather muscular in build and not an emaciated white man. To other believers who point the finger I repeat the Lords words to  you – Judge not lest you be judged!  God bless everyone I say.

Most who actually listen to what we believe are amazed at how biblically based EVERYTHING we believe is.<br>  <br>  Enjoy....<br>  <br>  <br>  Earlier, in his letter to the Corinthians, Paul wrote about the persecution that the apostles faced. He said: “We have become a theatrical spectacle to the world, and to angels, and to men. .?.?. When being reviled, we bless; when being persecuted, we bear up; when being defamed, we entreat.” (1?Corinthians 4:9-13) Similarly, true Christians today are being watched by the people of this world. When those around us observe the fine things we do even while we are being treated unjustly, they may be inclined to look more favorably upon our Christian message.—1?Peter 2:12.<br>  <br>  <br>  How far, though, should we go in order to promote peace? We should go as far as possible. Paul tells his Christian brothers: “If possible, as far as it depends upon you, be peaceable with all men.” (Romans 12:18) “If possible” and “as far as it depends upon you” are qualifying expressions indicating that making peace with others may not always be possible. For instance, we will not disobey a command of God just to keep peace with man. (Matthew 10:34-36; Hebrews 12:14) Still, we do everything we reasonably can—without compromising righteous principles—to make peace “with all men.”|`|212F2EO0aa	God wants a separate and peculiar people, so yes, I think that goes along with being separate and not of the world, no matter who thinks what of us.<br>  <br>  Having more fear of God than of man.|`|WrZsRICCaa	Yes, it is in darryls letters to the prophelactics: Thou shalst nost care whast otherts thinkst of thou (st) It is in there somewhere.|`|SbN2cXE5aa	Mat 10:28   And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.|`|M3xTT1bUaa	Not sure if it says it specifically and I don't have a Bible on hand, However, it does imply it.|`|SXRa4p8Vaa	there`s no such thing in the bible.|`|aV2VS9NYaa	god said let there be light, and there was light, and it was good.
dR4NI4KNaa	India's culture is marked by a high degree of syncretism[122] and cultural pluralism.[123] It has managed to preserve established traditions while absorbing new customs, traditions, and ideas from invaders and immigrants and spreading its cultural influence to other parts of Asia.<br>  <br>  Traditional Indian society is defined by relatively strict social hierarchy. The Indian caste system describes the social stratification and social restrictions in the Indian subcontinent, in which social classes are defined by thousands of endogamous hereditary groups, often termed as jātis or castes.<br>  <br>  Traditional Indian family values are highly respected, and multi-generational patriarchal joint families have been the norm, although nuclear family are becoming common in urban areas.[96] An overwhelming majority of Indians have their marriages arranged by their parents and other respected family-members, with the consent of the bride and groom.[124] The marriage is thought to be for life,[124] and the divorce rate is extremely low.[125] Child marriage is still a common practice, with half of women in India marry before the legal age of 18.[126][127]<br>  <br>  Indian cuisine is characterized by a wide variety of regional styles and sophisticated use of herbs and spices. The staple foods in the region are rice (especially in the south and the east) and wheat (predominantly in the north).[128] Spices originally native to the Indian subcontinent that are now consumed world wide include black pepper; in contrast, hot chili peppers, popular across India, were introduced by the Portuguese.[129]<br>  <br>  Traditional Indian dress varies across the regions in its colours and styles and depends on various factors, including climate. Popular styles of dress include draped garments such as sari for women and dhoti or lungi for men; in addition, stitched clothes such as salwar kameez for women and kurta-pyjama and European-style trousers and shirts for men, are also popular.<br>  <br>  Many Indian festivals are religious in origin, although several are celebrated irrespective of caste and creed. Some popular festivals are Diwali, Ganesh Chaturthi, Ugadi, Thai Pongal, Holi, Onam, Vijayadasami, Durga Puja, Eid ul-Fitr, Bakr-Id, Christmas, Buddha Jayanti and Vaisakhi.[130] India has three national holidays. Other sets of holidays, varying between nine and twelve, are officially observed in individual states. Religious practices are an integral part of everyday life and are a very public affair.<br>  <br>  Indian architecture is one area that represents the diversity of Indian culture. Much of it, including notable monuments such as the Taj Mahal and other examples of Mughal architecture and South Indian architecture, comprises a blend of ancient and varied local traditions from several parts of the country and abroad. Vernacular architecture also displays notable regional variation.<br>  <br>  Indian music covers a wide range of traditions and regional styles. Classical music largely encompasses the two genres – North Indian Hindustani, South Indian Carnatic traditions and their various offshoots in the form of regional folk music. Regionalised forms of popular music include filmi and folk music; the syncretic tradition of the bauls is a well-known form of the latter.<br>  <br>   <br>  A statue of Shiva, a principal deity of Hinduism, in BangaloreIndian dance too has diverse folk and classical forms. Among the well-known folk dances are the bhangra of the Punjab, the bihu of Assam, the chhau of West Bengal, Jharkhand and sambalpuri of Orissa and the ghoomar of Rajasthan. Eight dance forms, many with narrative forms and mythological elements, have been accorded classical dance status by India's National Academy of Music, Dance, and Drama. These are: bharatanatyam of the state of Tamil Nadu, kathak of Uttar Pradesh, kathakali and mohiniyattam of Kerala, kuchipudi of Andhra Pradesh, manipuri of Manipur, odissi of Orissa and the sattriya of Assam.[131]<br>  <br>  Theatre in India often incorporates music, dance, and improvised or written dialogue.[132] Often based on Hindu mythology, but also borrowing from medieval romances, and news of social and political events, Indian theatre includes the bhavai of state of Gujarat, the jatra of West Bengal, the nautanki and ramlila of North India, the tamasha of Maharashtra, the burrakatha of Andhra Pradesh, the terukkuttu of Tamil Nadu, and the yakshagana of Karnataka.[133]<br>  <br>  The Indian film industry is the largest in the world.[134] Bollywood, based in Mumbai, makes commercial Hindi films and is the most prolific film industry in the world.[135] Established traditions also exist in Bengali, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Tamil, and Telugu language cinemas.[136]<br>  <br>  The earliest works of Indian literature were transmitted orally and only later written down.[137] These included works of Sanskrit literature – such as the early Vedas, the epics Mahābhārata and Ramayana, the drama Abhij?āna?ākuntalam (The Recognition of ?akuntalā), and poetry such as the Mahākāvya[13|`|pgVJHEMKaa	All different parts of India have different beliefs. <br>  Generally they have adapted alot towards western culture in terms of clothing and lifestyle.  There are parts of India where they still have strong beliefs in terms of being vegetarian and not drinking alcohol.<br>  <br>  Terms of culture, it's very vibrant with lots of colour, religion and spirituality is huge with Indians, there are lots of sacred places and weird things happening.  Some things you would not believe!!  <br>  <br>  overall i guess it's becoming more and more westernised, Indians are living the lifestyle of westerners.  However, the traditions of festivals will still continue to be a strong part of the culture.|`|2TAFXgtyaa	Like England but warmer.

It's just the way the ball bounces. Sinners as well as Christians all have strife at one time in their life. We just don't see it as we are so caught up in our own troubles that sometimes others just seem to have the gold tooth. That is just not so

51fe01ef6db0c1bd743afcb3e7a2e1ffaa	The poor in spirit are those who are interiorly detached from the things of this world. In other words, they have “no other gods,” no false idols, nothing that their heart desires more than a loving communion with God. Moreover, this loving communion with God is not postponed until our afterlife in heaven. It begins here and now.<br>  <br>  The poverty of Jesus does not negate His divine richness. Rather, it accentuates the richness of His love. Nonetheless, Jesus truly experienced our poverty. His self-emptying was not merely an external fa?ade. It was a love unto death on the Cross. By His wounds, by His suffering and death on the Cross, by this total gift of Himself in love to the Father, He redeemed the world.<br>  <br>  The first Beatitude, then, invites us to imitate Jesus by becoming poor with Him in order to love as He loves. This poverty seems like foolishness to those whose hearts are set on this world, but in fact it opens us to friendship with Christ.|`|HMteUyRdaa	Blessed (holy) are those that live their earthly lives for their souls eternal salvation.

X1j7qYkUaa	Some of this to a lesser degree also applies to the masculine butch dyke and all the stereotypes contained within.<br>  <br>  But often the focus is upon the male flamer, so of course, it's a homophobic backlash to the stereotypes long associated with gay men. <br>  <br>  Some people looking for separation, others looking for an excuse to justify their hate, dislikes or even their preferences. <br>  <br>  What's bloody damn funny to me in that sick, sad and pathetic sort of way is when a question comes up to some of these pseudo "straight *ACTING*" queens is when it relates to acting girly or appearing feminine, there's often the response, "NO! Because I'm a man"<br>  <br>  And those are the blokes that probably don't even see them as men. <br>  <br>  Tell me that doesn't sound like a self loathing poofter in some aspect. <br>  <br>  Not to mention it's relationship to gender games and roles, and maybe they think it reaffirms their homosexuality and masculine identity to be a feminine hating guy or maybe it's more about hating women. <br>  <br>  And because life after the school playgrounds are more school playgrounds than those school years ever was. <br>  <br>  It's picking out the weakest link, the "kid" that would have been picked on and bullied in school for acting or being perceived that way, for being a f.a.g.<br>  <br>  Yeah, there's queens that are too camp, but there's a lot of other people playing their niche picked roles to perfect stereotypes too.<br>  <br>  But of course, my defense of this is probably that I'm just a b!tchy, girly queen.... rest comfortably in that assumption, if it makes you feel more secure in your position and identity.  <br>  <br>  But all the archetypes annoys me at one time or another, painted with broad strokes on a larger scene than a handful of individuals I could avoid if it really bothered me that much.|`|FpMS47sXaa	I have no problem with more feminine gay men.

I have no issue with anyone masculine or feminine, but I dislike adults who behave like schoolgirls, regardless of gender.

It like they are saying "LOOK @ ME BI@TCHES" toning it down two notches--wouldn't hurt. Although most of which are great dancers, have beautiful personalities, and very fun to be with. <br>  I respect all people straight or gays but would not like to be around those who overreacts, the funny thing is that they get upset when every1 is pointing fingers. If they tone it down--people wouldn't even know they are there. <br>  <br>  Either u overreact/scream so the world to know you're there or tone it down, act civilized so u won't be under a spot light/made fun of/having fingers pointing your way.<br>  I guess they try to act like women but as far as I see it, u act like yourself, don't stand out to make people laugh. Unless you're a clown and get paid for acting like a loud fool.<br>  <br>  Enjoy your weekend|`|zjzfWaGXaa	this is not at all why I dislike the more flamboyant in our ranks, I see nothing wrong with a little pizzaz in life but sometimes it is just so obvious that they are forcing it. I met a guy at a gay club in the city once who was just a loud, screaming, queen, and whne I asked him if he was like that before he came out he of course said no he was very reserved. I then asked him if it felt natural to act this way and he said no but to do otherwise was to conform to what society wanted me to be. This seemed a great hypocrisy to me, I should act one way because society expected it or I should act another because the LGBT community expected it. No thank you, I intend to act exactly how I feel like and the rest of you can **** right off and stop telling me what to do. If you've been a loud screaming queen the whole time then more power to you but if you've just come into it, your probably faking it and that's just pathetic.

SygvUa0Eaa	No, it really isn't. I mean, they go around preaching their morals, and treating everyone as they wish to be treated. But when it comes to someone else's religion, they go saying things that are clearly disrespectful and ignorant.<br>  <br>  However, you cannot assume that it is only Christians who do this. There are several religion who also go around and do the same thing, so there is really no way you can point the fingers at just one religion.<br>  <br>  Also, you can't really expect it to stop either. When two beliefs/cultures collide, there will clearly be arguments and fights because the two are different. It's the way of humans, as sad as that may be. So, don't stress over it too much. Plus, half the people who criticize someones religion shouldn't be talking, because most of them are truly ignorant as to what they preach about.|`|AA11755204	All religions should be disrespected, especially if your definition of "disrepect" is "any criticism".<br>  <br>  Religions tend to get overly offended at anything less than a wholesale assumption of validity.  This makes people less likely to criticize it and shields it from any valid critique.<br>  <br>  So, I think people shouldn't worry about offending another person's religion.  They would rather you not notice all the crazy claims they make.  It hurts their business.<br>  <br>  Religion is about emotional control of their converts.  So, they don't like a lot of constructive criticism levied against their claims.  They especially don't like when humor is used to point out their more ludicrous claims.  Humor, especially, breaks the emotional hold they have.  Their defense is to be extremely offended at any such attempt.<br>  <br>  Granted, we shouldn't be discriminatory against people because of whatever beliefs they hold.  But the belief, itself, is fair game.<br>  <br>  Any belief that can't stand on its own merit is not much of a belief.|`|9mLOH7bpaa	Rene, how do you know yours is true doctrine?

They have a Hebrew program, and if it's as good as the Chinese one, it's a good place to start.<br>  <br>  Rosetta Stone uses a lot of pictures to help you relate images to the words you are using.  It also makes use of microphones to have you repeat what you are learning and will let you know if you are pronouncing it correctly.<br>  <br>  Chinese, like Hebrew, is a totally different writing system.  My husband has not found Rosetta Stone to be very useful in helping to learn this.

1wNsBNmxaa	The Faerie Queene is an English epic poem by Edmund Spenser, published first in three books in 1590, and later in six books in 1596. The Faerie Queene is notable for its form: it was the first work written in Spenserian stanza. It is an allegorical work, written in praise of Queen Elizabeth I. Largely symbolic, the poem follows several knights in an examination of several virtues.<br>  <br>  The Faerie Queene found political favour with Elizabeth I and was consequently a success, to the extent that it became Spenser's defining work. A measure of the favour which the poem found with the monarch is that Spenser was granted a pension for life on account of it (50 pounds a year). The work found great acclamation among critics and has been the subject of many analyses.<br>  <br>  As it was published in 1596, the epic presented the following virtues:<br>  <br>      * Book I: Holiness<br>      * Book II: Temperance<br>      * Book III: Chastity<br>      * Book IV: Friendship<br>      * Book V: Justice<br>      * Book VI: Courtesy<br>  <br>  <br>  смерть???|`|rl4NU9Zdaa	What's a mock-epic.<br>  <br>  I think that the reason no one is answering is b/c you're not explaining well enough.<br>  <br>  You cannot just assume we know everything about Mock Epics spencers Fearrie Queen.<br>  <br>  What the hell is that?<br>  <br>  You must explain better.

WO66BG5waa	there is little tangible evidence available on the existence of<br>  Vampires, and undue weight has to be placed on circumstantial evidence.<br>  <br>  1. Every occurrence of human combustion - especially 'spontaneous'<br>  combustion - needs thorough examination. In practice, this is patchy and<br>  details often emerge too late for firm conclusions to be drawn.<br>  <br>  A trickle of reports has arisen in Eastern and Central Europe, most provided by professional Vampire hunters. Several isolated<br>  reports have come from urban areas in the USA - 50% of these in New York.<br>  <br>  2. Vampire-Typical injury reports (neck bites, severe bleeding from small wounds), also need investigation. This is almost impossible, as no health service categorises wounds in a useful way - and victims often go to great lengths to disguise or deny such injury.<br>  <br>  3. Exsanguination deaths and missing bodies: A significant number of such<br>  events have occurred in key locations; reports of body snatching have continued, some with no evidence of external assistance, and few with any possible motive for such theft.<br>  <br>  4. Vampire sightings have increased in recent years; this may be in part due to unwelcome and inaccurate televisual displays - a badly educated public is in increasing danger, and compounds this by false reports<br>  <br>  Verification is difficult, but there is sufficient circumstantial evidence, and individual experiences, to assert that not only do Vampires still exist - but they are thriving.<br>  Is anyone still investigating Vampires; Where?<br>  <br>  Most sightings, and indeed most legends, still arise in Central Europe;<br>  there is little doubt that the species arose in this area, and was probably<br>  confined there until about 150 years ago. Recent evidence suggest that the<br>  anonymity of large cities has attracted an fast-growing network of vampire<br>  communities, attracted by a transient, dislocated population, as well as an<br>  active nocturnal life. Most serious researchers are at work in the great<br>  cities of the western world, with just a few in the Carpathian Mountains.<br>  Do Vampires Turn To Dust When Staked?<br>  <br>  In a word, No. This device, popularized by Buffy the Vampire Slayer, was actually a television convenience devised by Joss Whedon to evade the need to justify a stack of corpses littering the graveyards.<br>  Staking actually starts an incendiary process, likely to end in a pile of fine white ash, with some boney remnants.<br>  Do Crucifixes Kill Vampires?<br>  <br>  A wooden crucifix could cause serious superficial burns, and, given enough time, could prove fatal. But this is a chemical effect, not a religious one.<br>  Many vampires are of devout Christian, Central European descent, and a crucifix could well trigger severe guilt feelings; in some cases, self-loathing. But not fatality.<br>  Do Vampires Fear Water?<br>  <br>  Yes; A vampire really is an incendiary device waiting to be detonated (check the theory), and water, even steam, presents a real risk to the vampire.<br>  Can Vampires Fly?<br>  <br>  Only if they get a ticket. Vampires have been shown turning into bats, wafting effortlesly upward, even leaping out of windows with a 'bat flight' soundtrack to suggest flight. It's all hokum; an exhausted vampire could not fly across Los Angeles and look fresh afterward, any more than I can - whatever Nick Knight might suggest. And why a vampire should even want to turn into a swarm of bats, as suggested by The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, beats me.<br>  <br>  Vampires can probably utilize stored energy better than normal folk, and a vertical leap - or rapid escape from pursuit - might suggest flight. But it's not.<br>  Are Vampires Evil?<br>  <br>  Not necessarily; vampires just "are"; as a lion is not evil when it kills a zebra, so a vampire is not evil for feeding off a person; living creatures do what they must to survive. The consensus is, however, that for the most part, Vampires are "not very nice".<br>  <br>  However, like the fox killing all the chickens in the hen house, rather than just the one, some Vampires are particularly unpleasant - and as they have intelligence, those that choose such a lifestyle are probably evil. Just as some humans are evil ...<br>  Have Vampires Evolved?<br>  <br>  If Vampyrism began somewhere in Eastern Europe in the1400's, and given the extremity of their physiology, it would be logical to assume that if they have survived this long that they may have evolved in order to survive.<br>  <br>  Long-lived creatures are doomed to evolve more slowly, whatever the<br>  pressures on them; a longer life means fewer generations, slower<br>  reproduction and so fewer opportunities for evolutionary change.<br>  <br>  Parasitic organisms might appear to have the freedom to reproduce at will;<br>  but most are subject to limitations, in some cases a complex life cycle,<br>  involving more than one host species, in others a simple population<br>  pressure.<br>  <br>  Vampires who allow their community to grow too large risk discovery and<br>  destruction; individuals and small groups might get by for ages - especially<br>  in isolated communities.

AA11297267	No.<br>  But then again, you can't go to heaven if you *have* been baptised, either...since there's no evidence of any kind that there's any such thing as a "heaven." :)<br>  <br>  Consider this:  let's assume for a moment your god is real (I know, wild assumption with no evidence to back it up...hey, just for the sake of argument, ok?).  You live a good life, are kind to others, and even "believe" in the jesus character...but you never get baptised.  You die, you go to be judged before this god, and he says:<br>  <br>  "You were an exemplary person, always good, a wonderful human being, and you even accepted my son as your lord and savior.  However, because you didn't have water sprinkled on your head or get dunked in a tub, you're going straight to hell."<br>  <br>  Now really, does that make any sense at all?<br>  <br>  :)<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|ugcnq0Buaa	Yes! Baptism is the first step of obedience after you except Jesus as your savior. It will not get you to heaven! If it did then Jesus wouldn't have had to die on the cross for our sins cause he had already been baptized. However Jesus got baptized to show his obedience to God. Baptism is a picture of your death, burial, and resurrection with Christ. Baptism shows the death of the "old man" before you were saved, burial of the old life, and the resurrection of a new life to be lived for the Lord Jesus Christ. Not even good works will get to heaven. Examples are (giving money to the church, being a good person, going to church etc.)|`|h5q89E3Haa	No.<br>  <br>  There is Water Baptism, Baptism of Desire and Baptism of Blood.<br>  <br>  Christ is clear you must be baptized and born again. Baptism by water is required, however if you incapable of being baptized by water(which is very rare in this day and age) and you have a true desire to be and you die with that desire then you are considered baptized. If you are killed for your beliefs in Jesus Christ you are baptized by blood.<br>  <br>  So basically unless you are lost in the jungle or killed for your beliefs in Christ you are not considered baptized and therefore you can not enter the Kingdom of Heaven.<br>  <br>  Peace be with you.<br>  <<<Devout Catholic>>>|`|239f0ef98b65c819dacad5a9908c975aaa	Yes. Look at the Thief on the Cross.|`|I3rjYVUFaa	Yes. We are given the Biblical example of the thief who was crucified NEXT to Jesus:<br>  <br>  Luk 23:39  And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us. <br>  Luk 23:40  But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation? <br>  Luk 23:41  And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss. <br>  Luk 23:42  And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom. <br>  Luk 23:43  And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise. <br>  <br>  Obviously, he had a pretty good reason for NOT being baptized, he was nailed to a cross and would be dead within a short time...This is the ONLY example there is in the NEW TESTAMENT of a Christian whom we KNOW is in heaven and he was NOT baptized; but this example can be modernized easily:<br>  <br>  What about the soldier on the batlefield who becomes wounded, is ministered to by a chaplain, accepts Christ in his heart, and dies a short time later?<br>  <br>  What about the teenager who is injured in a car wreck, accepts Christ and dies a short time later?<br>  <br>  What about a sick child, dying of cancer, who is mature enough to accept Christ, yet deathly afraid of water? Does anyone believe that a just God would eternally condemn such a one on a TECHNICALITY?<br>  <br>  I do NOT believe there is ONE WORD in the Bible "by accident" and we are given THIS story for a reason. Baptism is STRONGLY encouraged in scripture, but NOT a requirement for salvation:<br>  <br>  Act 16:31  And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house. <br>  <br>  Now, if you read a few more verses in Acts 16, you can see that they WERE baptized...Jesus himself was baptized:<br>  <br>  Mat 3:16  And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him: <br>  <br>  Baptism is SYMBOLIC, and is done out of love for and obedience TO God's word, but not NECESSARY for salvation.<br>  <br>  Yours in Christ,<br>  John the Baptist|`|AA11156135	Yes, - the thief on the cross did.<br>  <br>  But as a follower in the direction and authority of the Bible, - every true believer should take this simple step, - and declare their renewal.|`|EoDeSDnmaa	I do not believe for a minute that whether or not we have had water dumped on our heads makes one iota of difference in the grand scheme of God"s plan.|`|sWs8ClF1aa	yes|`|5LP8FyzAaa	Yes.

It doesn't mean to repent AND be baptized to be forgiven.<br>  <br>  All the OT prophets said "REPENT!"<br>  <br>  John the baptizer said "REPENT!" and "bring forth fruit (evidence) meet for (evident of) repentance." (i.e. prove that you have repented, THEN you can be baptized.")<br>  <br>  Paul said we must "REPENT!"<br>  <br>  And Jesus said "Go and sin no more" i.e. "REPENT!"<br>  <br>  One passage does not nullify all the others, so when it says "Repent and be baptized "  it certainly agrees with what John said, that we must demonstrate (or prove) that we have repented, THEN we may be baptized in the name of Jesus.<br>  <br>  But it does NOT contradict every OTHER Scripture that requires us to "REPENT!" in order to go to heaven.  Baptism is an outer action to demonstrate an inner change of heart.  We are buried with Christ, and raised in the newness of life with Him.<br>  <br>  By the way, "repent!" is not "works" - it is a condition, without which God can not in all good moral conscience, grant us an undeserved and unmerited pardon that we could never earn.

The Church of Scientology has also been accused of harassing its critics,and has consistently used litigation against them."<br>  <br>  They also covered up the fact that their founder had been dead for years.<br>  <br>  See link:|`|AA10985325	Here’s a factual description for you (From a Scientologist):<br>  <br>  Scientology is a new religion. It is an applied religious philosophy. By “applied” is meant that it is for use in life and  living. You actually use it in your day to day life to change and improve existing conditions. It is a practical religion.<br>  All religions if you study them have a basic philosophy, but they also have certain dogma, rituals and observances and a certain faith or belief is required. There is nothing wrong with this , but Scientology is not that kind of religion. It acknowledges the principle of God or the Supreme Being but does not try to define or describe this principle,  leaving it up to the individual.<br>  It is also not a messianic religion. This means there is no worship of prophets or messiahs or gods. It is not belief or faith based. In Scientology a truth is true for you according to your own observation and experience .<br>  The dictionary definition that applies:<br>  <br>  Religion: The spiritual or emotional attitude of one who recognises the existence of superhuman power or powers.<br>  <br>  The most basic principle of Scientology is that YOU are your own immortal soul, that this is not a thing you have but what YOU actually are.<br>  Scientology believes or considers that Man is basically good. This is different from many religions that promote that he his natively evil or bad unless “made” good.<br>  <br>  The whole purpose of Scientology knowledge application and procedure is to increase an individual’s understanding and awareness of himself as a spiritual being and to rehabilitate his native abilities and potential.<br>  When you do this there sphere and zones of his positive influence increases and moves outward into his life , his family and friends, his groups and Mankind of which he is part .<br>  <br>  How this result is achieved is the “technology” of Scientology, which was developed by L Ron Hubbard from discoveries he made after  extensive research into the field of the mind and the human spirit.<br>  Some of this knowledge was already existing in the sacred lore of ancient texts like the Veda or Vedic Hymns going back 10,000 years. New and additional discoveries were  made about the nature of the human spirit and fully recorded and codified .<br>  Scientology’s closest spiritual ties with any other religion are with Orthodox (Hinayana ) Buddhism with which it shares an historical lineage. But even here the relationship is based mainly on friendship and the recognition of the being as a spirit rather than any organizational ties.<br>  <br>  L.Ron Hubbard published 18 basic books from 1950 to 1955 to fully communicate the basic principles of Scientology, the path of his research and the technology that  he developed from this. <br>  He completed all his research before his death in 1986 and left all his materials and copyrights to the Church of Scientology’s Religious Technology Centre along with most of his personal estate when he died.<br>  <br>  The Church of Scientology is currently established iand operating internationally in over 160 countries world wide. However it is still a new religion, less than 55 years old.<br>  The true story of Scientology as a religion goes like this:<br>  1. A philosopher developes a philosophy about life and death.<br>  2. People find it interesting.<br>  3. People find it works.<br>  4. People pass it along to others.<br>  5. It grows.<br>  <br>  This is just an overview.<br>  L.Ron Hubbard explained fully the theology and technologies of Scientology in more than 500,000 pages of writings, including dozens of books and over 3,000 tape recorded public lectures. So it’s not possible to fully answer your question on this forum, but I hope  this helps.<br>  <br>  Also here is the definition of a Scientologist:<br>  <br>  "A Scientologist is one who understands life.His technical skill is devoted to the resolution of the problems of life."<br>  <br>  So yes it can be a profession if one is trained in the application of Scientology technology and is properly licensed to counsel and minster. Most Scientologists become Volunteer Ministers.|`|AA11521494	Follow the link below - it'll give you the whole story, including the beliefs which are so wacky it's not surprising they are not revealed to scientologists until they've already spent over $300,000 on it.

For all of us who have done it, I'm sorry if we've offended you.|`|I5pUxwPbaa	this seems to happen a lot, if anyone doesn't speak perfect english someone will inevitably mock them or critisize them.

mVTGl6HGaa	Worldwide the most common method of prepaying postage is by buying an adhesive postage stamp to be applied to the envelope before mailing; a much less common method is to use a postage-prepaid envelope. Franking is a method of creating postage-prepaid envelopes under licence using a special machine. They are used by companies with large mail programs such as banks and direct mail companies.<br>  <br>  In 1998, the U.S. Postal Service authorised the first tests of a secure system of sending digital franks via the Internet to be printed out on a PC printer, obviating the necessity to license a dedicated franking machine and allowing companies with smaller mail programs to make use of the option; this was later expanded to test the use of personalised postage. The service provided by the U.S. Postal Service in 2003 allows the franks to be printed out on special adhesive-backed labels. In 2004 the Royal Mail in the United Kingdom introduced its SmartStamp Internet-based system, allowing printing on ordinary adhesive labels or envelopes. Similar systems are being considered by postal administrations around the world.<br>  <br>  When the pre-paid envelope or package is accepted into the mail by an agent of the postal service, the agent usually indicates by means of a cancellation that it is no longer valid for pre-payment of postage. The exceptions are when the agent forgets or neglects to cancel the mailpiece, for stamps that are pre-cancelled and thus do not require cancellation and for, in most cases, metered mail. (The "personalised stamps" authorized by the USPS and manufactured by Zazzle and other companies are in fact a form of meter label and thus do not need to be cancelled.)
AA10093245	I don't understand why they are like that either. They believe in supernatural events, yet not paranormal, but if they would check through the Bible, it's full of paranormal events as well as supernatural. I guess they think it only happened in the past and not today?|`|MeFeazFiaa	"Spiritually Speaking."  Not again.  Can you please try to be a bit more imaginative?|`|Z4avhg3eaa	I suppose it is possible.  I've seen a few things that make me scratch my head in that regard.  The problem that I would bring up is one of evidence.  It's different for psychic and paranormal phenomena than it is for God because psychic/paranormal phenomena are readily available and amenable to investigation.  God is not.  God (in the western sense of the word) is not even well-enough defined in my opinion to entertain a meaningful conversation about it. <br>  <br>  The issue with psychic/paranormal phenomena is to produce empirical evidence under controlled conditions.  To my knowledge, this hasn't happened yet.|`|AA11045021	Good question. I find it strange that Christians are so easy to believe in God, but deny things like UFO's or super powers or something.<br>  <br>  And I really hate when people say, "You can't disprove God. You've had over 2000 years to do it." It's not like anyone has ever put down definitive proof that God exist.|`|g9TxgMlwaa	Ya know... I feel the same way! Have for years!! I can't quite grasp how some people believe so blindly because of what a book, that was written by man, says you have to do. And when questioned why, the response i've always gotten is that's the way it is. God just is.  I just can't quite grasp something so blindly. It's like saying to someone one, hey! Believe that chickens were once dogs, because this book by some unknown being said so. So.. okay yea sure pal. I'm not trying to knock someone's faith or say it's wrong or don't believe in this or that. I just can't grasp how you can believe in something so blindly.|`|ugcnq0Buaa	Deuteronomy 32:20<br>  And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end shall be: for they are a very froward generation, children in whom is no faith.<br>  <br>  You should not question this! Look around. Do you really think that everything was made from evolution? God will not reveal himself, because even if he did some people would still not believe and choose to believe in what they wanted. You know something when people die do you really think that that is the end? No. Their soul either goes to heaven or hell. I know in my heart that God is real and anyone who doesn't believe that well they will have to stand before God one day on judgement day and take an account for all they have done. Have you ever read any of the bible? Revelation for one. Everything in revelation is exact to what is happening right now in the world. Scary huh? But to the ones who do believe in God and have faith they are excited cause they know they will be with God that much sooner! I trusted Christ as my savior, confessed my sins, admitted I was a sinner and deserved to go to hell. I asked him to come into my heart and save me. Now I know I am a child of God and no matter what I do if I meant what I said to God in my heart I will spend eternity with him forever! <br>  John 10:28<br>  And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. Also people who question this stuff the your advisary the devil is speaking right through you! He wants each and every person to question if there is really a God!|`|eYgR2SNlaa	Paranormal is a phenomena, God and his teachings are taken as life guide lines, maybe you should try apples to apples :) <br>  <br>  Reply to comment: Paranormal is identifiable, don't need belief to make it work and did I mention anything about my personal belief?|`|6da136429953fa0aaf7405c93b94bdb5aa	That's the beauty of "belief."  Anyone is free to pick and choose what they will or won't believe, regardless of any other facts or factors.<br>  Consider how many people DON'T believe we sent men to the moon, that there are still people who DON'T believe the Earth is round (look up 'The Flat Earth Society," etc. <br>  Two quotes come to mind:<br>   "What is true is what I can't help but believe."<br>   "I am always amazed by the unbelievable things people believe."<br>  Belief works both ways: it enables you to accept without proof and to disregard even with proof.<br>  And neither posture is a validation of anything.|`|32P7VxUlaa	How do you prove God isn't real?

CEChcfKwaa	To be liked, everyone has to have some redeeming characteristic. Over-bearing (dominant) people might be more tolerated if they are at least good looking. Unattractive people have one strike against them already. If they don't have an attractive personality they are not going to be liked.<br>  <br>  If you get into evolutionary traits, the dominant (alpha) males were the desirable ones to procreate with because they had superior genes and that included the physical. Beta males had inferior qualities that were less desirable and they were expected to know their place in the hierarchy.|`|K1oOQqqVaa	You are generalizing.  First of all, as the clichè goes - "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder".  Most 'enlightened' people see past the surface to what is deeper than the skin.

As you say, this is who they are.  <br>  <br>  Now on the other hand, perhaps because you feel that you are ugly, you feel that if you are not approachable and people will just leave you alone and you don't have to deal with them judging you for your looks.|`|CasElICIaa	for the ones who seem to have trouble grasping the concept of "ugly", it means "not visually pleasing" and there are ugly things and people all over the world so learn to deal with the term.<br>  <br>  Personally I don't think that ugly people are expected to assume subservient social positions.<br>  I am attractive looking and sometimes I envy ugly people.<br>  Look at Lemmy of Motorhead fame.  He's ugly as they come and has even two ugly  warts on his face. (which he won't remove!)<br>  So he's always been expected to fail.

kZ8jIStBaa	Sikhism is basically a religion that believes in one God [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ek_Onkar]" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ek_Onkar]</a> and plays heavy reliance on the role of Guru (teacher) in attaining salvation. They had 10 Gurus in succession. The 10th Guru Govind Singh at the time of his death declared that henceforth all Sikhs should consider the holy scripture Granth Sahib as Guru. So basically all Gurudwaras house Guru Granth Sahib which is recited and prayed at Gurudwaras.<br>  <br>  Worship in a gurdwara consists chiefly of singing of passages from the scripture. Sikhs will commonly enter the temple, touch the ground before the holy scripture with their foreheads, and make an offering. The recitation of the eighteenth century ardās is also customary for attending Sikhs. The ardās recalls past sufferings and glories of the community, invoking divine grace for all humanity.<br>  <br>  They also organize communal feasts (Langars) which are open to all without any distinction to cast creed or religion. <br>  <br>  It is customary for all entering Gurudwars to cover their head with some cloth before they enter Gurudwara.<br>  <br>  Anyway, what I heard is that singing of hyms (Shabad and Kirtan as they call it) is the essence of all the worship that they do at Gurudwara.|`|8f79a6907c34a502a5158ce4ade3c011aa	This may help,<br>  <br>  <a href="http://sikhism.about.com/od/gurdwaras/tp/Gurdwara-Facility-and-Function.htm" rel="nofollow">http://sikhism.about.com/od/gurdwaras/tp...</a><br>  <br>  There is a shortage of Sikhs on R&S but  i will star your question.<br>  <br>  _()_
OCg8zOH2aa	Yes self flagellation is haram .. so is suicide bombing .. we never said suicide bombing is allowed.<br>  now the counter argument from shias is going to be "ooh dont u mourn the people u love so much" yes we mourn them but not by beating ourselves and bleeding like a stuck pig .. we send prayers and peace to our loved ones .. how is beating yrselves going to make the ahlal bait happy ? think about it u freaks .. Also there is a hadeeth in which the Prophet Mohammad sallalahu alayhe wassalam condemns morning for more than three days.<br>  Also sister saira has given sources from the quran al kareem .. how can u go against the word of Quran al kareem? does not that make u a kafir going Allah swt final divine orders?<br>  Instead of beating yrselves why not pray to allah swt to make u better people and give u chance to live yr life like Ali radhiallahu anhu and the ahlal bait.

(never) wilt thou cease to remember Joseph until thou reach the last extremity of illness, or until thou die!" 10:85<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  in many places we see that Allah SWt is not against mourning, as another example i can point out to 5:83 which says:<br>  " And when they listen to the revelation received by the Messenger, thou wilt see their eyes overflowing with tears, for they recognise the truth: they pray: "Our Lord! We believe; write us down among the witnesses."<br>  <br>  Allah SWT says 44:29 "So the heaven and the earth did not weep for them, nor were they respited"<br>  so the heavens and the earth didn't cry for Dhalimeen, but the heaven and the earth cried blood for Imam Hussain (as), as it's even mentioned in sunni books<br>  “On the day of the martyrdom of al-Hussein (AS) the sky rained blood . . . .” <br>  <br>  See<br>  <br>  Thakhaa'er al-Uqba pp 144, 145, 150. <br>  <br>  Al-Sawaa'eq al-Muhriqah pp 116, 192 . . . . . .<br>  <br>  “There was not a stone which was not lifted but underneath it was found blood . . . ” <br>  <br>  See<br>  <br>  Al-Sawaa'eq al-Muhriqah pp 116, 192. <br>  <br>  Tathkirat-ul-Khawaas p 284,<br>  <br>  Tafsir ibn Kathir vol. 9, p 162 . . . . .<br>  <br>  <br>  Those were some of the prophets on whom Allah did bestow His Grace, - of the posterity of Adam, and of those who We carried (in the Ark) with Noah, and of the posterity of Abraham and Israel of those whom We guided and chose.

I inflicted cuts on myself before and after I knew about this taboo. But that was before I realized that what I was doing is very very wrong.<br>  <br>  I believe that anything bad is acceptable, or pardoned, if there is a good cause behind it. For example, lying. If you lie to save someone's life, or to help someone other than yourself, then it is pardoned. In the same way, I believe that exposing yourself to any sort of harm for a noble purpose is pardoned. <br>  <br>  And about the Shia's, they are not the true Muslims. They do not follow our Prophet (PBUH) but another being whom they've accepted to be their leading Prophet. Their ideas and rituals are in many ways different from the true Muslims, the Sunnis. <br>  <br>  I hope that you've understood now. And besides, if you've already gotten proof from the Holy Quran, you should know that it's forbidden to harm oneself or others.<br>  <br>  May Allah bless us all!

SDDgbtQ4aa	There are plenty of people here who seem to have no problem admitting they like mermaids - in fact, there are a slew of people here who actually believe it's possible to turn themselves into a mermaid with magic.  (Though as a witch, I can tell you it is not possible to change oneself into a different species with spells.)<br>  <br>  I think mermaid art is simply beautiful, and I even have some in my home, adding to my ocean themed decor.  However, as an avid sailor,  according to actual mermaid lore, I'd not like to run into one - as they were believed to enchant sailors in order to cause shipwrecks, or lure crew members to walk off the decks of their ships and drown.

The Bible says the man would be stoned to death.  It is a good thing Jesus died on the cross, for a man can now be forgiven for his sins.

She was probably closer to 16 do your home work.  <br>  <br>  As for how rediculous this question is getting.  God didn't force Mary to have Jesus.  She willingly accepted.  She was not married at the time therefore he didn't "impregnate" another man's woman.  Joseph had the choice not to marry her, but he chose to So he accepted it as well.<br>  <br>  Besides we don't really have any say to our bodies.  God already owns them.  After all he did create them.  Just because we live breathe and think doesn't mean we can do whatever we want he is just nice enough to let us think that.  After we die a lot of people will be punished for it, but like I said we don't really have any say do we.<br>  <br>  Don't compare God to a human that is just stupid.  <br>  <br>  God is good an holy blessed be his name!|`|2WfHLUyOaa	O whats with all the hate filled athiests on this today ...seriously... <br>  <br>  Our lady was the most blessed person in the world.. and she was sooo lucky..

sXwBN5sSaa	Yes, I am afraid it is normal nowadays. You may have "gone to the best schools money could buy" but the fact is that education in the UK (and the USA) IS generally poorer now than 30-40 years ago. This is particularly true of English-language teaching, and thanks to the succession of morons - sorry, - I mean "education experts" who have usurped education on both sides of the Atlantic, there have been several generations of English-speakers who do not know their own language and are.therefore greatly handicapped when it comes to learning foreign languages. I.am a professional linguist - that is to say I use foreign languages in my job; in addition to the languages I usually work in - Spanish, Portuguese and French - I hold lesser qualifications in 6 other languages. I was lucky enough to have attended schools where parts of speech, grammar and spelling were given rigorous attention, and that has always equipped me well both in writing in English and in learning languages; but I despair for anyone who has never learnt proper grammar trying to learn even one other language.|`|zEoRcL91aa	Know what you mean.

hR7OsqtRaa	2 Timothy 3:16<br>  All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1:11-12<br>  I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached is not something that man made up. I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?<br>  <br>  Pasting a small part from the website.<br>  Visit the website to strengthen your faith in Jesus or to know more about Him.<br>  <br>  Jesus is God.<br>  <br>  1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus<br>  specifically.)<br>  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)<br>  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)<br>  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)<br>  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)<br>  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)<br>  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)<br>  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)<br>  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)<br>  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21<br>  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)<br>  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).<br>  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).<br>  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).<br>  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.<br>  27.

Prayer is communication with God<br>  <br>  He has given us a big freedom and we make wrong choices with our free will<br>  <br>  God is all powerful, everything happens in His timing. Jesus was in the very center of God's will. Everything happened the way it was foretold in the OT. He could have saved Jesus from crucifixion but Jesus willingly gave up His life sot that the prophecy would be fulfilled and you an have eternal life with Him<br>  <br>  Yes, but you can also think of it as the fire insurance|`|qPbKJeXzaa	The problem is that man created god in his own image as a male person separate from mankind with all the failings humans have (lack of fairness, jealously, vengeance) and therefore creates all the sorts of questions that you pose because that's not god.|`|s40sgQ45aa	Man rejects God and his laws yet blame God for suffering, disease and injustice.

One day God will cast out all sin and the righteous will shine forth.  Suffering will cease.

People pray aloud to prove to other people that they are praying. It's stupid and you don't have to do it that way, but it is good to think of you prayers conciously (as in bring them to the front of your mind and dedicate a minute to running through them to "project" them out)<br>  <br>  2. Police and courts are for the laws of man, not the laws of death. Religion is all about what happens after death and all of the laws of religion relate to death.<br>  <br>  3. The story of Jesus says that he specifically came to earth to be a martyr. He KNEW what was going to happen and did it so that everyone else could see him die for his beliefs. And god doesn't help anyone "on earth" it's more of being there for you when you leave it.<br>  <br>  4. I agree, religion is similar to life insurance. Sadly, religion also seems to make a lot of people hate each other, which kind of defeats the purpose.|`|KDNWFuZWaa	what always gets me about it is if god knows all past present and future then why did he bother creating Adam and Lilith then Eve if he knew what they were going to do? Also he would then know how things were going to be and happily went ahead and done it anyway. That proves it is just one big fairy tale.|`|mg6gAfwYaa	Let me try to dispel your ignorance about God and how in mysterious ways he works. I am sure that ignorance once dispelled is very difficult to re-establish so here goes. God has created the entire Universe and everything in it for a divine play. We all have our roles to play in this play. The real substance in us are not our bodies, which are perishable but our souls that are immortal. Our souls get transmigrated into different incarnations both human or otherwise over millions of life times and we play out our roles in different bodies. The injustice in the world is not God's doing it is man's ignorance that leads to injustice. Police and courts are not God's creations but man made institutions. Jesus was sent for a divine purpose of a supreme sacrifice, God proved his omnipotence by Christ's resurrection. Now do you understand?|`|AA11464106	We don't really need to call our mothers, but we do once in a while because we care about them. No real need to talk to God, but do so shows that we love Him and strengthens our relationship with Him.<br>  <br>  Some issues just do not have satisfactory answers yet. Faith presumes that although we do not yet understand, we believe that someday we will.<br>  <br>  Jesus's life was given by God as a sacrifice to pay for our sins. <br>  <br>  And we don't actually own anything. Belief simply acknowledges credit where credit is due.|`|Tmlu3O71aa	What gets me is, why do people blame God for putting them in a position to go to court. People always like to blame somebody else for their actions.|`|rK3HOUEraa	There are questions that can't be answered. If you could understand God, then He ceases to be one.|`|EmyMvE3Vaa	If you meant "like a life insurance scam", I'm good with that|`|K8kRLxS7aa	Thanks for your question.<br>  Ofcourse God knows everything of our mind.But if we don't pray then we will not get anything from god(e.g.Blessing).As an example,you are very rich man and i'm working under you and you know my needs and want.But if i don't ask anything from you you will not give me any penny or any help.<br>  <br>  God is always very Fair.Allah says in Quraan:<br>  Verily, Allah enjoins Al-Adl (i.e. justice and worshipping none but Allah Alone - Islamic Monotheism) and Al-Ihsan [i.e. to be patient in performing your duties to Allah, totally for Allah’s sake and in accordance with the Sunnah (legal ways) of the Prophet SAW in a perfect manner], and giving (help) to kith and kin (i.e. all that Allah has ordered you to give them e.g., wealth, visiting, looking after them, or any other kind of help, etc.): and forbids Al-Fahsha’ (i.e all evil deeds, e.g. illegal sexual acts, disobedience of parents, polytheism, to tell lies, to give false witness, to kill a life without right, etc.), and Al-Munkar (i.e all that is prohibited by Islamic law: polytheism of every kind, disbelief and every kind of evil deeds, etc.), and Al-Baghy (i.e. all kinds of oppression), He admonishes you, that you may take heed.<br>  <br>  So Bad people is doing wrong things by the help of Satan.thats why we need Police and court.<br>  <br>  The true beleive is Jesus was not son of God.He is a prophet of God and servant of God.Misguided people think Jesus was son of God.Whether Jesus never said like this in his book or in his life.and jesus did not died by jewish,he was took away and he will come back again to save this world from satanic activities.<br>  <br>  God is not like that.If you beleive God truly, the peace and happiness in your life will be forever even in this earth and also life after death.May Allah show me the right path.Ameeen.|`|xOiyuDataa	Well before I can on any further, all of the corruption in the world started with Adam and Eve when they dissobeyd God. God was the one who planned for his son, Jesus Chrst to go onto the cross in the first place, so that he could make a remission for our sins... It wasn't God's plan to take Him off of the cross.<br>  This is really all i am going to say, as I could go on about this forever...<br>  It delights God to hear us pray, because He loves us, even though He knows what we want. Think about if you have your own kid, you know what they want, but like it when they ask you for it.<br>  Anyways, I repeat, everything goes back to the start, when Adam and Even didn't listen to God's simple instruction, which was not to touch the fruit, but they listened to the serpent instead, which caused sin, and all of the mess you have explained to come into the earth. This is why God told Adam and Eve not to touch the fruit. God could change everything and make the world peaceful right now if he wanted to, but that would make Him unjust and unholy, because God doesnt go back on His word. He is almighty, and gave Adam and Even an instruction and one instruction only, but they couldn't do it... When man disobeys, we end up learning the hard way. God has still made a way for us to go into heaven, believe on His son Jesus Chrsit and allow him into your heart, and there will be a place for you in heaven when you die.<br>  We can still live a life full of contentment, but obviously nothing compared to where we would be living now, which would be the garden of eden, if it hadn't been for Adam and Eve's sin.

These examples include an illegal plot to infiltrate the government, brainwashing techniques, mind control camps, attacks on critics, and DEATHS caused by Scientology doctrine and members: <br>  <br>  ● Operation Snow White – Under this official program, Scientology operatives committed infiltration, wiretapping, & theft of documents in government offices. This program constituted the single largest infiltration of the United States government in history. Among the 11 prominent Scientologists convicted of this conspiracy was Mary Sue Hubbard, the wife of Scientology’s “prophet”. <br>  <a href="http://lisatrust.freewinds.cx/scientology/snow-white/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://lisatrust.freewinds.cx/scientolog...</a> <br>  <a href="http://en.allexperts.com/e/o/op/operation_snow_white.htm" rel="nofollow">http://en.allexperts.com/e/o/op/operatio...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.lermanet.com/reference/77Granjurypart1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lermanet.com/reference/77Gran...</a> <br>  <br>  ● Operation Freakout - Their campaign of sabotage & intimidation against Paulette Cooper, the writer who published her research & findings on several cults, including Scientology. The following was Scientology’s official plan for “dealing” with this woman: to frame her for making “bomb threats”, ruin her career & reputation, & get her either incarcerated or locked up in psychiatric confinement.

In addition, Scientology's lawyers hired private investigators to dig up any "dirt" on IRS agents which was then used to blackmail or publicly smear all "vulnerable" agents. <br>  <a href="http://legalminds.lp.findlaw.com/list/fedtax-l/msg00445.html" rel="nofollow">http://legalminds.lp.findlaw.com/list/fe...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.lermanet.com/scientologynews/nytimes/nyt-irs-030997.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lermanet.com/scientologynews/...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.factnet.org/headlines/give-away.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.factnet.org/headlines/give-aw...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Cowen/essays/irs.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Cowen/essays/...</a> <br>  <br>  ● Fair Game - the Scientology policy detailing how the organization may confront & handle critics & perceived enemies. Here is a direct quote: "Enemies may be deprived of property or injured by any means by any Scientologist without any discipline of the Scientologist. May be tricked, sued or lied to or destroyed.” Though they claim this policy is no longer in effect, Scientology still goes to great lengths to bully all known critics, opponents, “enemies”, etc, often through malicious litigation & character assassination, even going so far as to falsely accuse them of crimes. <br>  <a href="http://www.xenu.net/archive/disk/fairgame.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.xenu.net/archive/disk/fairgam...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.fairgamed.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fairgamed.org/</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.solitarytrees.net/racism/harass.htm#start" rel="nofollow">http://www.solitarytrees.net/racism/hara...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocw90W44Boc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocw90W44B...</a> <br>  <br>  ● Physical & psychological punishment - Scientologists who "break the rules" while members of the "Sea Org" must subject themselves to the Rehabilitation Project Force (RPF), which includes regimes of harsh physical punishment, forced self-confessions, social isolation, hard labor and intensive ideological indoctrination. <br>  <a href="http://www.xenu-directory.net/practices/rpf.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.xenu-directory.net/practices/...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.lermanet2.com/scientology/gulags/BrainwashinginScientology'sRehabilitationProjectForce.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lermanet2.com/scientology/gul...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.scientology-lies.com/birgitta.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.scientology-lies.com/birgitta...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~kspaink/cos/rpf/escape_2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.xs4all.nl/~kspaink/cos/rpf/es...</a> <br>  <br>  ● Brainwashing & mind/thought control - Scientology exerts control over its members by means of typical cult tactics, including but not limited to sensory deprivation, behavioral conditioning (especially automatic compliance with authority) as well as psychological conditioning (desensitization to being abused and dominated), controlling information about internal doctrine & criticism of the organization, severely restricting social contact outside the cult (including the practice of “disconnecting” from family, friends & ex-members who question the credibility & trustworthiness of the cult & are therefore considered “suppressive persons” by Scientology), creating an “us against them” mentality by villainizing a specific out-group (Scientology does this by claiming that psychiatrists are evil & orchestrating a worldwide conspiracy), & claiming all those outside the cult are dangerously unenlightened.<br>  <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Secrets/TR/critique.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Secrets/TR/cr...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.scientologydisconnection.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.scientologydisconnection.com/</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.sptimes.com/2006/06/24/Tampabay/The_unperson.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.sptimes.com/2006/06/24/Tampab...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.factnet.org/Books/SocialControl/scs.html#toc" rel="nofollow">http://www.factnet.org/Books/SocialContr...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.garloff.de/kurt/sekten/mind1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.garloff.de/kurt/sekten/mind1....</a> <br>  <a href="http://xenu.net/archive/personal_story/funkydonny.html" rel="nofollow">http://xenu.net/archive/personal_story/f...</a> <br>  <br>  ● War on Psychiatry – Scientology has taken a very hostile stance towards psychiatry & psychiatric drugs irrespective of the fact that some people require medication to remain adequately functional during everyday life. It doesn’t recognize legitimate conditions like autism, epilepsy, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or ANY neurological disorder / chemical imbalance at all, & the “church” has been known to withhold prescription pharmaceuticals from members (often with harmful & deadly results).

The material of Scientology either works or it doesn't. What makes it popular, though, is how practical Scientology is. Want to help someone understand something? Scientology includes a technology of study that gets rave results daily. Want to be a better listener? There is nothing that comes close to the Scientology Communication Course for improving the ability to interact with people.<br>  <br>  But don't feel sorry about Scientologists being ignored by hate mongers in the anti-religion crowd. They do very well in that department, thank you.

He doesn't have the personal qualities you look for in a partner. So basically what he's doing is providing a little excitement and a diversion for you. It also sounds like your primary relationship is not meeting your needs. Since you're asking, end the "affair", talk to your boyfriend about your concerns and see if you two can make things better between you.|`|QZvvHp3iaa	You're cheating, ok, let's just get that out in the open there. You're "little affair" is you....cheating.... on your..... boyfriend.<br>  <br>  I had a relationship just like yours, except I was the one who has the bad temper (Italian) and I was the one thinking of straying. My ex and I were so compatible with each other, we both were in the same type of work, we had similar interests. Our sex life wasn't something to brag about, we clicked in every other way possible but the sex part. I went out with friends more to the bars and this guy was really into me and this guy was everything I love sexually in a guy, there was a definite sexual draw to him that I couldn't deny. Getting my kicks off online just wasn't enough anymore and our sexs life was dwindling. I never did do anything else with that guy or anybody else. My respect for my ex overpowered my lust. We lived with each other for five years, our sex life waned the last year. So we broke up and continued living with each other for 6 months and then I moved out four days and 22 hours ago, I miss him more than anything.<br>  <br>  You need to talk to your boyfriend, open up to him about what you're feeling and what you need. And then ask him what he needs out of you, you might be surprised that he feels the same. So, invent little sexual games with him, spice up your sex life, they have books galore. I liked this book that was like coupons and it would say 'free massage on my day of choosing' Or another would say 'meet me at the bar and pick me all over again' <br>  If you truly do love him, you'll make it work...together.<br>  <br>  As for you admitting your tryst: I am a very heated type of guy, I get jealous easily, I have a bad temper, I always told my ex that if he ever cheated on me that I never ever wanted to hear about it. Hearing me say that now, I realize how stupid and immature it is to think like that. Honesty is what makes relationships good relationships, it doesn't mean it makes him forgive you and you keep your relationship with him. He may not want to forgive you, and do you blame him, put yourself in his shoes. Your boyfriend came home, sat you down and told you he was hooking up with another guy. He's going to be hurt, but if you want any type of relationship with him, I'd be honest with him.<br>  Good luck.|`|sRoRsrjQaa	I know ur in two different situations, not one. You are thinking about ur relationship with ur bf, and ur dealing with ur fantasy with this guy from work. Sex and love are two different things. Lust and thinking are two different things as well. First u have 2 find out the main problem that u have with ur bf and see what u can solve. as for the affair figure out why this guy likes u and see what he wants from u, so its going 2 be a long process but as everyone say, life goes on and there is no such thing as a bad decision, its based on how u see it and for every problem there is always a solution.|`|Yoab4tZxaa	BAD|`|AA11263450	Okay, let's get down to the facts.  Six years is a good relationship to just throw away.  You two have never really lived together though and this I think is where the stress is coming from.  Have you two exchanged anything (rings etc) in a sign of commitment?  If so, then what you are doing at work is wrong and is as if cheating.  Yes, it is fun and you like the thrill, danger.  And it is doomed, he is leaving, you know this and you try to convince yourself that that fact alone will see it over.  Stop it Now!  It does seem that you and your partner are not very compatible.  Is this something you can work on?  Can you work less?  Does he work at all?  Can he learn to control his temper?  Are there things that you both can compromise to do in your free time together?  Can you find any new pursuits?  Can you spice it up in the bedroom?  There are a few really important questions I want you to ask yourself and trust me I am in a 29 year relationship that has seen it's ups and downs.  Do you share with your partner these things...the same dreams for your shared future...the same ethics and morals and religious beliefs...some if any of the same hobbies...and friends?   These are the things that make a relationship last when the sex fades.  Three years ago, my partner and I had a major lapse as you are discribing, it took all of our willpower to make adjustments and we finally conquered the struggle.  And let me tell you, the sex came back BETTER THAN EVER!!!  It can be done!  But do you want to put in the effort?  Ask yourself that now, before this goes any further, out of respect for all involved.  Just my thoughts.  Good luck.|`|n3myW2eOaa	Tough situation! Personally I feel like keeping secrets from anyone is a horrible idea especially if it is from your significant other. My last relationship ended because I wasn't being honest with her. The good foundation to any relationship rather it be sexual or just friendly is trust. Would you not expect the same honesty from him? I would say in your current situation if you want to mess around with someone else you need to end things currently with your boyfriend. If you truly value the relationship and want it to work I would suggest coming clean to what has already been done and not do it anymore. As for your complications on getting along with your boyfriend I would suggest sitting down and talking with him. See what parts of the relationship you both dislike and like and then together you should decide if the relationship will work or if you both are willing to improve the situations to keep each other satisfied, but I see no reason to keep a unsatisfactory relationship held together on bits of threads whilst you see someone else. Thats just me though, best of luck!|`|nAD4ArHraa	Gayness has nothing to do with this question.<br>  <br>  If you're in a relationship with someone that you've lead each other to believe is a monagamous one, and you're seeing someone else, that's an affair, cheating, whatever word you want to call it.  It's amazingly unfair and disrespectful to your "official" partner.<br>  <br>  Is it an affair/cheating?  The rule I use in my own life is this: if it's something that I wouldn't do if my wife was watching, it's cheating.  And yes, that limits the range of OK things quite a bit.<br>  <br>  Be a man.  Talk openly and honestly to your partner about both of your needs and expectations.  Maybe it'll prompt the two of you to find ways to improve your relationship.  Maybe it'll bring an end to the relationship.  Maybe it'll turn it into more of an "open" relationship by mutual consent.  But it's completely uncool to do this sort of thing on the "down-low."<br>  <br>  Cowboy up.

By employing a concept of an afterlife where justice is served depending on how you lived your life, people were still able to have faith in Christianity no matter what happens to them. Others might say that the Heaven/Hell concept is so hard to understand in scientific terms because only God has the capacity to understand it.

Maybe then the government can finally make some change in the country and the police can finally keep people from violating someone else's basic human rights.<br>  <br>  Her dad didn't know that would happen to her, he wanted the three men punished and jailed.

Men who are bi-curious tend to not discuss it with others because they are either scared of it or because they think that they will be made fun of or rejected. But I wouldn't say that it is more common in females, just that a woman would probably be more likely to talk about it or act upon it. I would say that there are probably just as many bi-curious men as women.|`|yiux97Wbaa	I'm not well versed on this since I am straight, but from what I understand, its actually the other way around.
AA11719394	Author: Isaiah 1:1 identifies the author of the Book of Isaiah as the Prophet Isaiah.<br>  <br>  Date of Writing: The Book of Isaiah was written between 701 and 681 B.C.<br>  <br>  Purpose of Writing: The Prophet Isaiah was primarily called to prophesy to the Kingdom of Judah. Judah was going through times of revival and times of rebellion. Judah was threatened with destruction by Assyria and Egypt, but was spared because of God’s mercy. Isaiah proclaimed a message of repentance from sin and hopeful expectation of God’s deliverance in the future.<br>  <br>  Key Verses: Isaiah 6:8, “Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, ‘Whom shall I send? And who will go for us?’ And I said, ‘Here am I. Send me!’”<br>  <br>  Isaiah 7:14, “Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel.”<br>  <br>  Isaiah 9:6, “For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.”<br>  <br>  Isaiah 14:12-13, “How you have fallen from heaven, O morning star, son of the dawn! You have been cast down to the earth, you who once laid low the nations! You said in your heart, "I will ascend to heaven; I will raise my throne above the stars of God; I will sit enthroned on the mount of assembly, on the utmost heights of the sacred mountain.”<br>  <br>  Isaiah 53:5-6, “But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are healed. We all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to his own way; and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all.”<br>  <br>  Isaiah 65:25, “The wolf and the lamb will feed together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox, but dust will be the serpent's food. They will neither harm nor destroy on all my holy mountain, says the LORD.”<br>  <br>  Brief Summary: The Book of Isaiah reveals God’s judgment and salvation. God is “holy, holy, holy” (Isaiah 6:3) and therefore He cannot allow sin to go unpunished (Isaiah 1:2; 2:11-20; 5:30; 34:1-2; 42:25). Isaiah portrays God’s oncoming judgment as a “consuming fire” (Isaiah 1:31; 30:33).<br>  <br>  At the same time, Isaiah understands that God is a God of mercy, grace, and compassion (Isaiah 5:25; 11:16; 14:1-2; 32:2; 40:3; 41:14-16). The nation of Israel (both Judah and Israel) is blind and deaf to God’s commands (Isaiah 6:9-10; 42:7). Judah is compared to a vineyard that should be, and will be, trampled on (Isaiah 5:1-7). Only because of His mercy and His promises to Israel, God will not allow Israel or Judah to be completely destroyed. He will bring both restoration, forgiveness, and healing (43:2; 43:16-19; 52:10-12).<br>  <br>  More than any other book in the Old Testament, Isaiah focuses on the salvation that will come through the Messiah. The Messiah will one day rule in justice and righteousness (Isaiah 9:7; 32:1). The reign of the Messiah will bring peace and safety to Israel (Isaiah 11:6-9). Through the Messiah, Israel will be a light to all the nations (Isaiah 42:6; 55:4-5). The Messiah’s kingdom on earth (Isaiah chapter 65-66) is the goal towards which all of the Book of Isaiah points. It is during the reign of the Messiah that God’s righteousness will be fully revealed to the world.<br>  <br>  In a seeming paradox, the Book of Isaiah also presents the Messiah as one who will suffer. Isaiah chapter 53 vividly describes the Messiah suffering for sin. It is through His wounds that healing is achieved. It is through His suffering that our iniquities are taken away. This apparent contradiction is solved in the Person of Jesus Christ. In His first advent, Jesus was the suffering servant of Isaiah chapter 53. In His second advent, Jesus will be the conquering and ruling King, the Prince of Peace (Isaiah 9:6).<br>  <br>  Foreshadowings: As stated above, chapter 53 of Isaiah describes the coming Messiah and the suffering He would endure in order to pay for our sins. In His sovereignty, God orchestrated every detail of the crucifixion to fulfill every prophecy of this chapter, as well as all other messianic prophecies of the Old Testament. The imagery of chapter 53 is poignant and prophetic and contains a complete picture of the Gospel. Jesus was despised and rejected (v. 3; Luke 13:34; John 1:10-11), stricken by God (v.4; Matthew 27:46), and pierced for our transgressions (v. 5; John 19:34; 1 Peter 2:24). By His suffering, He paid the punishment we deserved and became for us the ultimate and perfect sacrifice (v. 5; Hebrews 10:10). Although He was sinless, God laid on Him our sin, and we became God’s righteousness in Him (2 Corinthians 5:21).<br>  <br>  Practical Application: The Book of Isaiah presents our Savior to us in undeniable detail. He is the only way to heaven, the only means of obtaining the grace of God, the only Way, the only Truth, and the only Life (John 14:6; Acts 4:12). Knowing the price Christ paid for us, how can we neglect or reject “

AA11755204	I'm an atheist, but this reminds me of a story.<br>  <br>  A minister goes to a remote primitive tribe to spread his Christian message.  The chief listened carefully as the minister explained for an hour about God, Jesus, Heaven, Hell, and the like.<br>  <br>  Finally, the chief asked a question, "You say your god is fair and loving.  So, if a person never heard of Christianity, would he go to Heaven or Hell?"<br>  <br>  The minister thought for a second and says, "Of course he'd go to Heaven.  God wouldn't punish the innocent!"<br>  <br>  Then the chief said, "So, I was already going to Heaven.  What, then, was your purpose in telling me all of this?"<br>  <br>  Religion really isn't about fairness.  It's about emotional control.  It sets up a dilemma that it can sell itself as the solution for, even though both the dilemma and solution are fictional.|`|2d2ZuimCaa	Romans 1:20 " For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:<br>  21  Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened."That is why more missions must be supported and sent . Mark 16:15 " And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature."|`|4068ddb702bdc41558e963e223abc40eaa	You are right... God is fair.<br>  <br>  The puzzle you pose comes from Church theology. <br>  <br>  Please take some time to focus on what Christ himself was saying. Read the story of the Prodigal Son. The son did not have to belong to this religion or that religion... and the son did not have to believe what a new covenant church taught... he simply went home to be welcomed by his heavenly Father. That beautiful story tells the essence of the true Kingdom Gospel. <br>  <br>  Just get back to what Christ was preaching and your puzzle will simply disappear. Click on my avatar if you want an explanation for this answer.<br>  <br>  And thanks for asking this brilliant and heart felt question.|`|9mLOH7bpaa	That ain't god, it's you and your prejudgement.|`|onkUcy19aa	Our finite minds would not understand the actuations of God, so it is very difficult to answer your question. But since God is a just God, you don't have to worry about the others because sooner or later they could probably be evangelized as what Jesus mandated us to do. But it is not the fault of the people who have no chance or a very slim chance to follow Jesus, and so this could not be taken away from them. I believe that for as long as people follow the what is right and what is wrong in their lives, faithful to the faith and laws of their religion, then they could probably go to heaven, not sent to hell.|`|yB0nVXfWaa	I don't actually believe that it's true that a person has more chance of being a Christian in the USA than in India, it only seems that way.  The culture might make you 'Christian' or 'Hindu', but it is God that sees the heart.  <br>  <br>  What I mean is, though a person may seem to be a Christian, yet he may in fact be only nominally so and not actually born again.  There are lots of people like this in the Christian world, who aren't going to heaven at all.  People like that are no better than those who do not have Christ, for they are deceived and do not have what they think they have.<br>  <br>  What is not equal is not necessarily not fair, for God tempers all things together, so that, where you think one has an advantage over another, other factors need to be considered.  Like, for instance, the people of India are rich in faith and quick to believe, but not so the Americans, who maybe think 'what's in it for me?'.  Not only that, there is less apostasy about in India, so the faith which is preached to them is more liable to be the real thing, compared with that which is preached in America.  Oh, and there's also less atheism, too.<br>  <br>  Well, we shall see in the long run, just how God has balanced all these things together, so he cannot be accused of being unfair.<br>  <br>  As regards being brought up a Muslim in Saudi Arabia, don't you know that they are by no means outside of the reach of God's Holy Spirit?  For he is the one whose job-description is 'to convict the world of sin, of righteousness and of judgment'.  Where the Bible is banned and missionaries cannot go, there is still satellite TV, movies, books with all sorts of ideas in them and means that the Spirit can use which we have no idea of.  Many people in such places dream dreams, and it is through these and suchlike that they come to know God, for God uses the supernatural more abundantly where the Word is banned.<br>  <br>  He is not limited and his job is to find his own, wherever they may be.  I do believe that many Muslims are very sincere people and try to be upright - will not God honour that with the truth, in due course?  For many are seeking him, and it matters not which community they are in - 'all that the Father gives to me will come to me' (John 6:37).<br>  <br>  Don't you know that, although those who have not heard the gospel need a preacher, yet how many first have heard the Holy Spirit preaching in their hearts before ever they heard from man?<br>  <br>  It is true that a person may be brought up in one faith or another, but what they do after they have become able to assess these things and reason properly is up to them.  If they stick with their upbringing, even though it goes against the witness of the Spirit of God in their consciences, then God is fair in concluding that they have 'loved darkness rather than light'.<br>  <br>  God does not show us all his ways.  He doesn't have to explain himself to us in everything.  However, as you walk with him, you will see that many things are not as simplistic as they seem and, just as he says that he does all things in righteousness, you will come to prove it also to your own content, what you always instinctively knew by faith.  One day we will see and know all things and, when that day comes, we will wonder anew at the marvellous kindness and goodness of his plan for each one of us.|`|prpuiJCgaa	Cww....It is not fair.  Go fix it.  Preach the gospel.  Go ye therefore unto all nations teaching and baptising by the authority of The Father, The Son and The Holy Spirit.

They have a lot of shows dealing with tribes and such. (Way cool stuff! I love it!) Anyway, these tribal people have tender hearts and are willing to admit that they aren't perfect. Most people do get their chance at the gospel, and these such people do most often accept it. Now consider America. We have heard the gospel a billion times over, not always in the right context, mind you. Yet there are plenty of people would refuse to admit wrong doing. They don't see themselves as sinner or in need of a Savior. <br>  <br>  The most stubborn the group, the more they need gospel to be preached/taught.|`|PWankIUpaa	Now you have asked a question that can be answered. <br>  <br>  I have family in America and I have family in a country recentally betrayed  into the hands of muslims. They believe more strongly than most American's do. They are dedicated to God in such a way that no American could understand.  Yet they are beaten raped tortured for their faith in the True God and worship Him through His son Jesus the Christ. Yes these people in other countries have it harder than Americans but their Faith is stronger and they Do hear the Gospel of Jesus Christ.<br>        There are Brave missionaries around the World ! There are Brave Christians around the World who go into all the World and teach and preach God! Your firend in India can use the excuse of the Muslims but your firend has heard of the Gospel and the Gospel is brought into people's lives to make what ever seed that is given them to grow!

2dWlUEimaa	Plato wrote in what most people would call Classical [Attican] Greek. There were various dialects in Greece, Attican being the one spoken in Athens and the Attica region.<br>  <br>  Generally the language during the so-called Golden Age of Greece, from around the time of the Perisan Wars to the end of the Pelopennesian Wars is called Classical. Sometimes it's also referred to as Ancient, but Ancient can also refer to older language, like that of Homer (his works are mostly in Archaic Ionic Greek, if I remember correctly), the Pre-Socratics, and even earlier language. In other words, the word Ancient covers a wider timeframe than Classical.<br>  <br>  Hellenistic Greek, sometimes referred to by the Greek word Koine, is generally the later Greek language as spoken around the time of Alexander the Great up to the early centuries A.D. The New Testament was written in Hellenistic Greek.<br>  <br>  Most courses and books to learn Ancient/Classical Greek teach the language of Plato, i.e. Classical Attican Greek. With a solid base in Classical Attican Greek, it isn't terribly difficult to learn the other dialects of Classical Greek or to read Archaic or Hellenistic (Koine) Greek.

Most say they need proof, like seeing is believing. God does work in mysterious ways and it could be that someday non-believers will have their eyes opened to the beautiful truth.|`|v93T1z2Aaa	Is There Evidence God Exists?<br>  <br>  Yes. Allah has sent down miracles, revelations and messengers to give clear proofs He exists and more important, what we should do once we come to this realization.<br>  <br>  Allah has sent prophets and messengers with many proofs throughout the ages for people to be able to clearly see with their own eyes and to be able to use their own senses the miracles and proofs pointing to the fact, Allah does in fact, exist.<br>  <br>  Miracles of prophets and messengers of Allah have come to people through the ages. Moses (peace be upon him) showed many miracles to pharaoh and to the children of Israel. Plagues, locusts, water turning to blood, his stick becoming a snake, the voice in the burning bush and the parting of the Red Sea are clear miracles for the people of Moses time.<br>  <br>  Again, Allah sent Jesus, the son of Mary (peace be upon him) with clear miracles for the people of his time. Speaking from the cradle while still a new born infant, creating birds from clay, curing the sick, giving sight to the blind and even bringing a dead man back to life, were all clear signs to the people to know Jesus (peace be upon him) was a messenger of Allah as was Moses before him.<br>  <br>  Muhammad (peace be upon him) was the last and final messenger of Allah, and he was sent to all of mankind. Allah sent him with a number of miracles, not the least of which was the Quran. The predictions and prophecies of Muhammad (peace be upon him) have come true even in this century and the Quran has been used to convince even scientists of the existence of Allah.<br>  [Please visit "Science Proves Allah": Watch video of famous scientists admit Quran is from Allah and even accept Islam]<br>  <br>  The Quran is the best of proofs for the existence of Allah and today over one and half billion people memorize and recite from the exact text, in the exact same language it was revealed in; Arabic. More than 10 million Muslims have completely memorized the entire Quran from cover to cover, and can recite it from memory without looking at it.<br>  <br>  No one sees or hears Allah, not even the prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). Nor are we able to use our senses to make some kind of contact with Him. However, we are encouraged in Islam to use our senses and our common sense to recognize this entire universe could not possibly come into existence on its own. Something had to design it all and then put it into motion. This is beyond our ability to do, yet it is something we can understand.<br>  <br>  We know from the teachings of Muhammad (peace be upon him) the proofs for the existence of God (Allah) are most obvious to us in our everyday surroundings. Anyone with understanding would quickly acknowledge His existence provided they are not so stubborn as to ignore the obvious evidences right in front of us.<br>  <br>  We don't have to see an artist to recognize a painting, correct? So, if we see paintings without seeing artists painting them, in the same way, we can believe Allah created everything without having to see Him (or touch, or hear, etc.).<br>  <br>  Allah says in His Quran He did not create all of this for any foolish purpose. Allah Says:<br>   And I did not Create the jinn and humans except they should worship Me. [Noble Quran 51:56]<br>  <br>  As regards the actual "Judgment Day" - Allah tells us that everything we are doing is being recorded and not a single tiny thing escapes from this record. Even an atom's weight of good will be seen on the Day of Judgment and even a single atom's weight of evil will be seen too.<br>  <br>   On That Day (of judgment) mankind will proceed in scattered groups and they will be shown their deeds.<br>   So whoever does good equal to the weight of an atom, shall see it.<br>   And whoever does evil equal to the weight of an atom, shall see it. [Noble Quran 99:6-8] <br>  <br>  The one who will bring the evidences against us will be ourselves. Our ears, tongue, eyes and all of our bodies will begin to testify against us in front of Allah on the Day of Judgment. None will be oppressed on that Day, none will be falsely accused.<br>  <br>  He could have put everyone in their respective places from the very beginning, but the people would complain as to why they were thrown in Hell without being given a chance. This life is exactly that; a chance to prove to ourselves who we really are and what we would really do if we indeed had a free choice.<br>  <br>  Allah Knows everything that will happen, but we don't. That is why the test is fair.|`|MF9YknDYaa	Because everyone knows that atheists are ALL rapists and murderers who hate god etc...yawn.All religious people want to rape and kill but are scared of the sky daddy.|`|OLiH8pSvaa	It's not.<br>  <br>  Just don't shove it down my throat if you also want me to not believe in God.|`|EmyMvE3Vaa	Who?|`|carRwIEuaa	No one ever said it was "bad". <br>  However, it's your choice.|`|BPO6roTOaa	Remember, you're not a believer, so you must hate God and eat babby's.|`|AA11264399	It isn't bad at all.

pfke6Jieaa	it all depends. there are a lot of people with sharp features that are still unattractive. to be honest with you, it all evens out and it is almost the same number of attrative and unattractive on both sides. i think sharper features though look more appealing on guys and soft on girls. but its still attractive the other way around really. its not a one way street.|`|hBEfrv23aa	Define sharp?

Then, buy a house, pay off all the debt for both me & the wife, finish school, & donate to my community to help more minorities to complete their college education.|`|ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	10 million wow.  Let's see, first stop financial planner.  Invest right now where I can buy tons and tons of shares in most companies.  Pay off my car and house.  I don't have any other debt right now and I finished paying off my student loan already.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't spend much and especially not on frivolous things but I would probably buy a couple vacation condos--especially since the market is so low right now I could get some great deals.<br>  <br>  I could live off the investments made on that every year for the rest of my life.  I'd also donate money each year to charity.  Like 100,000 to St Jude's, 100,000 to foster children like Dr Phil Foundation, and some to the Humane society.  If you give it each year you get the tax credit.  And of course we have to knock it to 5 million since the IRS will be knocking before the guy who gave me the 10 million pulls out of the neighborhood.<br>  <br>  Since I'm young though 10 million sounds like a lot less.  If I were 60 perhaps I could just blow it on travel but I probably have at least 60 more years to live.  So many people are millionaires, there are tons of houses that are 1 million, and I have a lot of years left to live which may end up with medical bills that could easily be a million as well.  When you look at it that way, 10 million may not last that long.  Sorta like that Octomom.  She's getting a million for exclusive deals but when you divide 1 million by 14 kids and 18 years you realize that's hardly anything.  It's literally $578 per kid, per month and that only counts the 8 babes.  If you take in all 14, it's less than 4,000 per kid per year.  Kids are a lot more expensive than that easily!<br>  <br>  While if I was given 1 million I probably wouldn't but if I was given 10 million I'd definitely give a lot to charity.  I love questions like this.  It makes me so happy to think about that just for a few minutes.

I however have fallen in love with some I could never possibly go ahead with but come on I never tought for a second it was god fault. I thank god that I have the ability to love someone it made me realise that I was alive and made me realise that I can be strong and can get through things without hurting other people on the way.<br>  <br>  I think thats what god was showing me but I didnt think about it till after I had moved on and picked myself up and brushed myself off. <br>  <br>  Is it really love ? or is it obsession? <br>  <br>  If its love thank god you have the ability to love and ask him to guide you trough it.. <br>  <br>  If its obsession then you have too much time on your hands and you need to get over it,<br>  <br>  However what ever the answer you will come out of this fighting and you will be soo strong after it so just have patience and do what you think is right.|`|pO8OzblHaa	Considering that you seem to be having doubts about yourself, maybe it's actually you that is testing you.

I can't really comment about the Priest's conviction, as that is what he truly believes, so he is correct in his own way.  I admit it does sound cruel, but try not to be too stressed.  I believe you may just be going through a difficult stage of your life, and it may be best not to jump to any conclusions, but try to relax a little and let time sort this problems out for you.  Stress can present people with confusing emotions, and this may be what is happening to you.|`|Sxlcyua5aa	Actually thoughts that are wrong come from Satan.   When they enter your head, you need to rebuke them and get them out quickly, otherwise if you keep dwelling on it, that thought will grow and take hold to you.

The more you do this the easier it will get.|`|1yJWrccXaa	I get from life that it is obvious that God wants us to suffer.  I think this is crystal clear.  My belief is that good people are forgiven for their sins and go to Heaven.  I don't think all the details matter so much.  If this is something you feel, it isn't your fault.  God made you and I with complex emotions and overwhelming urges.  Personally I don't view life as a test as much as I view it as a suffering.  I say pursue it.|`|AA11935914	we are emotional animals that CAN think about long term consequences.  God's people think we CAN"T think rationally therefore do what they say or feel eternal pain.

Trust in the Lord, for He created you to serve a greater purpose.<br>  <br>  However you decide to act, the important thing to remember is that the number one reason God created you is to love Him.<br>  <br>  All the best<br>  xx|`|NWTfFEuVaa	Well first of all your cousin's dad would be your uncle either by blood or marriage, to me either way would be gross. Either God is testing you or you are just experiencing a very strong emotion for this person you are thinking is love, but it's probrably something else that is similar to love. Or if you want to get psychological about it, maybe when you were growing up you didn't feel a connection with your father or the main male figure in your household, if you had any at all, and you are psychologically reaching out for something father-like that this guy offers that you've never had before. It doesn't mean you're gay and if you are gay, I'm sure God will love you either way. Just stay strong and pray your little heart out about it!|`|jiqcLFdvaa	Allah (God) is testing you, because he has put us on earth and has created obstacles to see if we will give in or not. See if you can control your feelings because it is very important to show that you will follow Allah's (God) way, for you will be rewarded.<br>  <br>  And are you sure you want this? Think about the circumtances which this may result in? It could lead to many good and bad. But still is it really worth it? What if you find yourself falling for someone later? Also how old are you are you sure you want this? Think about it long and hard because once you take the plunge and go for your cousins dad things will probably change, I do not know what will change, it may be good or bad. Or you could take the other route and not go for your cousins dad. You may find someone else later.....its your choice.|`|sbeoF50gaa	I'm prolly gonna get some thumbs down for this but here goes. I do not believe God interferes with our lives. If he did it would defeat the purpose of free will, and take away our right to choose. God doesn't make you like your cousins dad (Woudln't that be your uncle?) IF you are a young person this could just be a phase. We sometimes have feelings for the same sex even when we are straight. I find this to be normal. It's unfair to God for you to blame him for your own actions/emotions. So many religions say we are "tested" but life is hard enough without God making it worse, I find it hard to believe he would/could do this to us. But we all have our beliefs :) This is just mine.<br>  <br>  <br>  All of these comment on how God doesn't exist do not apply to this question. He believes in God and you do not so your opinion here is worthless.|`|AA11743216	God does not test people like that<br>  the only test you will get from Him<br>  is believing in Christ.<br>  And as long as you arent protected to<br>  know what is Godly and what is not,<br>  by having the<br>  baptism of the Holy Ghost, Acts 2:4, Acts 2:38,<br>  you are up for attacks from satan|`|v93T1z2Aaa	I invite you to read this link :<a href="http://www.godallah.com/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.godallah.com/index.php</a> which will take less than hour to complete it.

The reason the world we live in is SO difficult to deal with and remain a christian is found at 1 John 5:19. Go get your bible and look it up. It says 'the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one (Satan)'.  1 Pet 5:8 says 'the Devil your adversary is roaming about seeking to devour someone'. Read the following article while USING YOUR BIBLE. If you apply the counsel from God and  Pray to God (Jehovah psalms 83:18)  for help, I promise it will get easier.<br>  <br>  'HOW CAN I AVOID HOMOSEXUALITY?'<br>  <br>  “During my teens I struggled with an attraction to other males. Deep down, I knew those thoughts weren’t normal.”—Olef.<br>  “My girlfriend and I kissed once or twice. Since I still liked boys, I wondered if I might be bisexual.”—Sarah.<br>  FEW would deny that homosexuality is talked about more openly today than it was several decades ago. And just try to say that you disapprove of it! Likely, you will be bombarded with criticism. Says 16-year-old Amy, “One girl told me that I must be prejudiced against people of other races, because my opinion of homosexuality amounted to the same thing—prejudice!”<br>  Today’s permissive attitudes have prompted a number of youths to experiment with same-sex relationships. “Many girls in my school claim to be either lesbian, bisexual, or ‘bi-curious,’” says 15-year-old Becky. Christa, 18, finds the situation similar at her school. “Two classmates have actually propositioned me,” she says. “One wrote me a note asking if I wanted to see what it was like to be with a girl.”<br>  With same-sex relationships being touted so openly, you may begin to wonder: ‘Is homosexuality really that bad? What if I’m attracted to someone of my sex? Does that mean I’m gay?’<br>  How Does God View Homosexuality?<br>  Today, many people—even some clergymen—soft-pedal the issue of homosexuality. Yet, God’s Word, the Bible, leaves no room for confusion. It tells us that Jehovah God made man and woman and that he purposed for sexual desires to be fulfilled only between a husband and a wife. (Genesis 1:27, 28; 2:24) It comes as no surprise, then, that the Bible condemns homosexual acts.—Romans 1:26,?27.<br>  Some would say that God’s Word is out-of-date. But why, do you think, are they so quick to make that claim? Could it be because the Bible’s view conflicts with their own? Many reject God’s Word simply because it teaches something different from what they want to believe. That view is biased, though, and we should rise above such closed-minded thinking!<br>  But what if you feel attracted to a member of the same sex? Does this automatically mean that you’re a homosexual? No. Remember, you’re in “the bloom of youth,” a period when you’re subject to involuntary sexual arousal. (1?Corinthians 7:36) If at times you feel an attraction to a member of the same sex, be assured that this doesn’t mean that you’re gay. Such inclinations usually fade with time. Meanwhile, you must keep from getting involved in homosexual practices. How?<br>  Pray about the matter. Implore Jehovah as David did: “Search through me, O?God, and know my heart. Examine me, and know my disquieting thoughts, and see whether there is in me any painful way, and lead me in the way of time indefinite.” (Psalm 139:23,?24) Jehovah can fortify you with a peace that “excels all thought.” This can ‘guard your heart and your mental powers’ and give you “power beyond what is normal” to keep from acting on wrong desires.—Philippians 4:6,?7; 2?Corinthians 4:7.<br>  Fill your mind with upbuilding thoughts. (Philippians 4:8) Read the Bible daily. Never underestimate its power to shape your mind and heart for good. (Hebrews 4:12) A young man named Jason says: “The Bible—including such scriptures as 1?Corinthians 6:9, 10 and Ephesians 5:3—has had a powerful effect on me. I read these scriptures whenever wrong desires occur.”<br>  Shun pornography and gay propaganda. (Colossians 3:5) Avoid anything that will arouse immoral desires. This would include pornography, certain TV shows and movies, and perhaps even fashion or bodybuilding magazines that feature lightly clad models. Change negative thoughts to positive ones. “Whenever I have homosexual urges,” says one teenage boy, “I meditate on my favorite Bible text.”<br>  Of course, some claim that there’s no point in doing all this, that you should simply ‘embrace your sexuality’ and ‘accept who you are.’ But the Bible says that you can do better than that! It tells us, for example, that some early Christians who had formerly practiced homosexuality changed. (1?Corinthians 6:9-11) You too can win the battle—even if at this point it’s only being waged in your heart.<br>  What if same-sex desires persist? Do not give in to them! Jehovah condemns homosexual acts. Thus, the person who struggles with same-sex desires is presented with a reachable goal—he or she can choose not to act on those desires.<br>  To illustrate: A person might be “disposed to rage.” (Proverb

The party pretty much disintegrated in the 1970's, so it's going to be difficult to find any legit merchandise in relation to the party. I found lots of items with black panthers on them, but nothing official. At first I started to be a smart *** on this question, but I did some reading and it sounds like the Black Panthers weren't really that racist, despite the STRONG appearance of being so. They fought against poverty and police brutality and stood up for many minorities. Nothing wrong with that. <br>  <br>   Google "Black Panther mug" and you may find something you like.

The same is true of animals; they *ARE* souls; they don't have souls. Also, in death itself, the Bible teaches that we have no advantage over the animals, that as one dies, so dies the other. (more on this later)<br>  <br>  The difference between mankind and animals is that we humans are created in God's image, and we were given the responsibility of caring for this world (and we have messed up that responsibility). God has redeemed mankind from sin, and everyone who accepts Jesus as their Lord and Savior will be saved from sin. Those who reject salvation are not saved as per their decision. This world (and all the animal and plant life) will also be restored to its original perfection.<br>  <br>  Here is the Bible definition of what a "soul" is:<br>  <br>  According to the Bible, we do not HAVE souls; we ARE souls.<br>  <br>  Consider the creation of mankind:<br>  <br>  Genesis 2:7<br>  And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.<br>  <br>  Notice that man was not *given* a soul, but that he *BECAME* a living soul.<br>  <br>  A soul, according to the Bible, is a body with the Breath of Life in it.<br>  <br>  <br>  The Bible even calls animals souls.<br>  <br>  Revelation 16:3<br>  And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead man: and every living soul died in the sea.<br>  <br>  <br>  The Bible says that in death itself, mankind has no advantage over animals:<br>  <br>  Ecclesiastes 3:18-21<br>  I said in my heart, “Concerning the condition of the sons of men, God tests them, that they may see that they themselves are like animals.” For what happens to the sons of men also happens to animals; one thing befalls them: as one dies, so dies the other. Surely, they all have one breath; man has no advantage over animals, for all is vanity. All go to one place: all are from the dust, and all return to dust. Who knows the spirit of the sons of men, which goes upward, and the spirit of the animal, which goes down to the earth?<br>  <br>  God did not give us souls, but we ARE SOULS.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, souls are not immortal. For it is written:<br>  <br>  Ezekiel 18:4 - the soul that sinneth, it shall die.<br>  <br>  Only God is immortal:<br>  <br>  1 Timothy 6:15-16<br>  He who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings and Lord of lords, 16 who alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen or can see, to whom be honor and everlasting power.<br>  <br>  <br>  We are not immortal, as many may claim, but we will receive immortality at Christ's second coming. If we are already immortal, then we would not need to receive immortality at the second coming; but the fact is, we are NOT immortal.<br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 15:51-54<br>  Behold, I tell you a mystery: We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed— in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. So when this corruptible has put on incorruption, and this mortal has put on immortality<br>  <br>  All who die wait for one of the resurrections; either the resurrection of the just, or the resurrection of the wicked. You want to be part of the first resurrection.<br>  <br>  People do not go to heaven (or hell) upon death; rather we wait for God's return, and *that* is when we will receive our reward or punishment.<br>  <br>  Revelation 22:12<br>  And behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me, to give to every one according to his work.|`|1GxMGmkqaa	everyone has soul. your gf wouldnt have make you do it. you look like you can do enough damage all by yourself without anyones help! never blame others for your own shortcummings!|`|rTplTuEdaa	Everyone has a soul,,else we would not live,,have you ever saw a dead person right after they die,,I have and you can see something<br>   has gone from them,,it was their soul.|`|2JbCMKNAaa	We all have a soul....and after our bodies die, our soul will go on to live forever....either in heaven or hell.

W76VDFKCaa	In my experience, we didn't sweat in gym class.  Class maybe about 40 mins in the a/c.  There was a lot of people at my school so you had a take turns in a particular activity.  Plus, with the way classes are scheduled, we didn't have time to shower.  Also, the schools here are forced to cut back on their money and are cutting out sports, music, art, and PE so the maintenance and cost of showers are not in the budget. Most schools do have the showers but are used for storage!|`|bb06GQ5Paa	Most kids I went to school with didn't shower either.  We played games like dodgeball or volleyball but we were in an air conditioned gym where you didn't sweat a lot so there was no need to shower.

I think Scandinavia has a different attitude about nudity than here in the USA.  I knew of wives who had never been naked in front of their husbands.  Weird, huh?<br>  <br>  When I was in high school in the 70s, we did have to shower back then...and I just dreaded it.  All the other gals would be secretly comparing themselves with others...some would just outright stare.  Except in one case I think it was justified.  I remember one time when one of my classmates got into the shower...and very confidently showered like she was the only one in there. Everyone stared at her. Why?  She was covered almost head to toe in hickeys!  Was a real shock to see that!!!  I get the feeling she was showing off...but no one knew what to say.  Was the quietest shower day in my entire 4 years of high school lol.|`|1uxhfh6naa	I have the same question. My school's gym in France had a shower and we were aloud to use it after gym class.

I may be that they want school days to be more productive than taking a shower, but school starts at 8:10 already! I really don't understand, either.|`|8vAxlg2Daa	I know we did where I went to school! <br>  <br>  But I think that alot of schools don't make it mandatory though they should. <br>  <br>  Europe is definately more open then the U.S|`|dR4NI4KNaa	not enough time and we don't get that sweaty...I don't know...I never showered after gym class...
AA11440601	The Catholic Church allows marriage between Catholics and non-Catholics. <a href="http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt2sect2chpt3art7.shtml#1633" rel="nofollow">http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt2s...</a><br>  <br>  That said, you are a Catholic but not a fully initiated Catholic. It sounds like you want to become a fully initiated Catholic. You should go through the RCIA process which will fully recognize your baptism. I know of many people who have gone through this wonderful process.<br>  <br>  With love in Christ.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	To keep due order the Church needs you to make arrangements ahead of time, sometimes 6 months. Speak to the parish and they will help you I'm sure. <br>  <br>  It will be excellent for you to be fully Catholic and know it. Plus you can probably ask some questions you have and get an authoritative answer (unlike Y!A, where you get an "I'm an authority" answer !)|`|myjB1nWGaa	Your baptism is valid, but you need to be confirmed. Check with your diocese and join a good RCIA class. You will formally learn the faith and be confirmed the next time Catechumens are received. In my diocese, it is usually in December and at the Easter Vigil Mass. I was baptized Baptist and was confirmed in 2000. Your Catholic baptism will make it easier for you. God bless your grandmother for keeping you in the faith! Study diligently and receive our Lord often in the Eucharist. There is no love affair equal to the one between you and the Catholic faith. I will pray for you!|`|VFWRdAH3aa	of course you're Catholic dear! you were baptized Catholic as a baby so that makes you Catholic.

They might, for example, feel very insecure about their ability to rear you properly. Or, feeling overwhelmed by all the moral dangers and temptations you face, they may tend to overreact to things at times. They also may be contending with physical, financial, or emotional hardships. A father, for instance, may hate his job but may never complain. So when his child says, “I can’t stand school,” it is no wonder that rather than respond sympathetically, he retorts, “What’s the matter with you? You kids have it easy!”<br>  <br>  How, then, can you find out how your parents feel? By “keeping an eye, not in personal interest upon just your own matters, but also in personal interest upon those of the others.” (Philippians 2:4) Try asking your mother what she was like as a teenager. What were her feelings, her goals? “Chances are,” said?’Teen magazine, “that if she feels that you’re interested in, and aware of the reasons for some of her feelings, she’ll try to be more aware of yours.” The same would no doubt be true of your father.<br>  If a conflict arises, do not be quick to accuse your folks of being insensitive. Ask yourself: ‘Was my parent not feeling well or worried about something? Was he or she perhaps hurt over some thoughtless deed or word on my part? Do they simply misunderstand what I mean?’ (Proverbs 12:18) Showing such empathy is a good start at closing that generation gap. Now you can work on getting your parents to understand you! Many youths, though, make that extremely difficult. How?

Bb6fQtl0aa	It is important to make du'aa for the Believers who came before us:<br>  <br>  "And those who came after them say: 'Our Lord! Forgive us and our brethren who have preceded us in Faith, and put not in our hearts any hatred against those who have believed. Our Lord! You are indeed full of kindness, Most Merciful.' "<br>  (Qur'aan 59:10)<br>  <br>  As evident by the above mentioned verse... the Shee'ah do not act in accordance this Verse.<br>  <br>  Another amazing Verse:<br>  <br>  " Muhammad [sal-Allahu 'alayhi wa sallam] is the Messenger of Allah.

Or a healing that does not involve any technology, but simply following instructions.<br>  <br>  For instance, what advanced technology could heal immediately a person by them simply touching the hem of a garment? Or washing in a certain pool or spring?<br>  <br>  Can someone be cured of a disease instantaneously? I have doubts that medical science could ever achieve that kind of "cure" for a disease.<br>  <br>  But keep in mind, the casual use of the word "miracle" and what it means. According to the wikipedia article, "In casual usage, "miracle" may also refer to any statistically unlikely but beneficial event, (such as the survival of a natural disaster) or even which regarded as "wonderful" regardless of its likelihood, such as birth. Other miracles might be: survival of a fatal illness, escaping a life threatening situation or 'beating the odds.'"<br>  <br>  Can science duplicate the miracle of life itself? Could advanced science duplicate it (as in the premise of Brave New World)? In other words, can (or with sufficiently advanced technology could) science create an egg (from scratch) and a sperm (from scratch) that are mutually compatible and will produce a human life with all its complexities and personality (a theme used by science fiction writers about a perfect society)? Or a society of humans that are not exact duplicates of themselves, and one that continues past the "miracle" afforded by some sufficiently advanced technology?<br>  <br>  I have my doubts.|`|AA11922229	Walking on water<br>  Miracle healing<br>  Immaculate conception<br>  Parting of the sea<br>  Speaking with God<br>  Speaking with snakes<br>  Creating the heaven and earth in 7 days<br>  The son of God is not possible<br>  Resurrection<br>  Foretelling the future, Revelations<br>  Declaration of sin<br>  Receive the commandments from God<br>  Noah's Arc Story<br>  <br>  We are capable of  eclectic plagiarizing of the world's ancient scriptures.|`|9d60a294b6864b585406ddb61a14d757aa	The raising of Lazarus from the dead.

I know the qoute you are referring to. Those who think these things could not be done with advance technology aren't even trying to think about it. Secondly there is no proof that jesus even existed , so the stories attributed to him are just that.<br>  <br>  You know I remember a Michael Crichton story called "The Great Train Robbery" where they tricked everybody into thinking this person was dead by having a dead cat in the coffin with the person. Trickery of this sort doesn't require advanced technology, just gullible people willing to believe anything.<br>  <br>  Pulling hundreds of loaves out of a basket? I bet that David Copperfield could do it. The same goes for turning water to wine, it is an old magicians trick. Turning a staff or a rod into a snake again that is or was a common magicians trick.<br>  <br>  Now walking on water could be done if you have an advanced technology by using a gravity generator. Something along the lines of what Larry Niven wrote about in one of his books. In the story this person used a gravity generator to suspend Sugar Loaf mountain in midair. This was a clever way of demonstrating power by immitating a Salvador Dali painting.<br>  <br>  This is an interesting way to get people thinking about things differently. It reminds me of something I read about Mark Twain recently and how at a young age he became skeptical about things because of the charlatans he encountered as a youth.<br>  <br>  God does not exist so he/she/it didn't create anything and that includes the universe. Someone mentioned water turning to blood, I guess they never heard of algae blooms. <br>  <br>  Parting the Red Sea or the Reed Sea as it is the real place the Israelites crossed was not a mystery. There was a volcanic explosion that happened it the Mediterranean at the time these people were running away from Eygpt. That explosion was the island of Thera where a civilization once thrived. The result was an enormous tsunami which caused the waters to recede far off shore and then it came rushing back in drowning anyone unfortuante enough to be caught on the beachs. No miracle required just fortuitous circumstance.<br>  <br>  As for healing people I used to see Oral Roberts and Benny Hinn do it all the time on TV. Have you people ever heard of shills? That's how those two guys have made enough money to indulge themselves with gold toilets and private jets. Send money to the scoundrels. Which brings us to L.Ron Hubbard who made up a religion because he wanted to make money and to prove that he could make up a religion. P.T. Barnum was right. There is a sucker born every minute.<br>  <br>  Thank you Kjelstaad I was just going to get around to the leprosy thing which can be cured today. I still think there were people shilling for jesus if he was real at all. Science has saved more people than religion ever has.<br>  <br>  If someone, with an advanced technology a lot more advanced than we are now ,wanted to fool a primitive bunch of goat herders how hard could it be? If you wanted to make the Sun appear to stand still ,which it didn't ,there is a way to do it. It requires the ability to park a ship in orbit around the Earth and bounce light back to the Earth.<br>  <br>  There are those that subscribe to the idea that our planet has been interfered with by other planets over the course of human history. I don't believe that anymore than I believe in an all mighty invisible wizard in the sky. However I do see why Star Trek had that non interference directive that they were always talking about.<br>  <br>  Gene Roddenberry who was an atheist imagined how attempting to help out other cultures could have unintended consequences. There were many shows during both Star Trek the original series and Next Generation about people being fooled into believing someone was a god because they had better technology.<br>  <br>  People who believe the bible want to believe. There is no proof that any of the stories are true other than the bible itself. I think I've finally come to the end of my thoughts on this subject for now , but I find these things endlessly fascinating. Like a magicain performing for an audience it's all about misdirection, and distortion of verbal stories passed on by word of mouth ages ago.

Then Christ will return, and the Wicked shall be destroyed, and the Saved will be "caught up" to be with the Lord. Then, for 1,000 years, there will be NO life at all on this planet - it will be dark and desolate, and it will be during this time that Satan will be bound here. <br>  At the end of the Millennium, Christ will return to judge the Wicked, where they will be resurrected into their old, mortal bodies and then judged, and then Hellfire will rain down from Heaven and destroy them permanently. When the judgment is over, God will set about re-creating the Earth the way it was in the Beginning - perfect and unspoiled, and the saved will be allowed to live on it. It is at that time that Proverbs 2:21 will be fulfilled.|`|ro0lmK5haa	The Bible never says anything about a "rapture"  that is speculation from christians.

God has never taken, other than enoch and Elijah, a christian off this planet.  Why would God start now?  Noah's flood he saved Noah and his family, the only righteous men on the earth at that time.  Moses's time was when God opened the earth and swallowed the calf worshipers when he saw them worshiping the idol.  <br>  <br>  Why would God change that trend and why would God need to test the unrighteous?  God is not going to change and therefore he is going to test the righteous.

First of all, rapture does not occurred in the inspired scriptures.<br>  <br>  Rev. 7:9, 10, 14, RS: “After this I looked, and behold, a great multitude which no man could number, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands, and crying out with a loud voice, ‘Salvation belongs to our God who sits upon the throne, and to the Lamb!’ .?.?. ‘These are they who have come out of the great tribulation.’” <br>  (To “come out” of something a person must go into it or be in it. So this great multitude must be persons who actually experience the great tribulation and come out of it as survivors.)
VPlKbDplaa	Dear Richard<br>  Salaam alaikum wa rahmatullah wa barakatuh<br>  <br>  Please ignore the ignorant and rude answers. I think that 'Lifting the fog' gave you a good answer. You do not need to say your shahadah in a mosque as God ..Glorious and Exalted is He ( Allah subhana wa ta'ala in the Arabic) is your witness. But it helps you to feel a part of the wider Islamic community if you can get to a mosque or if not if you can find another muslim to witness your shahadah. Take a bath before you do so that physically you are in a pure state. And remove worldly thoughts and distractions so that mentally you are in a purified state to say the shahadah. <br>  <br>  Please feel free to email me also if you need any further help and advice. <br>  <br>  Congratulations on reaching this point in your journey. May you be divinely guided and may Allah subhana wa ta'ala (God...Glorious and Exalted is He) make your journey a pleasant and easy one.

That is the case.!!! But God knows best. There was apparently one open case of apostasy in the Prophet's (peace and blessings be upon him) time, but the Prophet (pbuh) neither punished the Bedouin nor asked anyone to do it.

The “Shahada” is the first and most important of the five pillars of Islam.<br>  <br>  With the pronunciation of this testimony, or “Shahada”, with sincere belief and conviction, one enters the fold of Islam.<br>  <br>  Upon entering the fold of Islam purely for the Pleasure of God, all of one’s previous sins are forgiven, and one starts a new life of piety and righteousness. The Prophet said to a person who had placed the condition upon the Prophet in accepting Islam that God would forgive his sins:<br>  <br>  “Do you not know that accepting Islam destroys all sins which come before it?” (Saheeh Muslim)<br>  <br>  When one accepts Islam, they in essence repent from the ways and beliefs of their previous life. One need not be overburdened by sins committed before their acceptance. The person’s record is clean, and it is as if he was just born from his mother’s womb. One should try as much as possible to keep his records clean and strive to do as many good deeds as possible.<br>  <br>  To convert to Islam and become a Muslim a person needs to pronounce the below testimony with conviction and understanding its meaning:<br>  <br>  I testify “La ilah illa Allah, Muhammad rasoolu Allah.”<br>  <br>  The translation of which is:<br>  <br>  “I testify that there is no true god (deity) but God (Allah), and that Muhammad is a Messenger (Prophet) of God.”<br>  <br>   It can be done alone, but it is much better to be done in the mosque, so we may help you in pronouncing it right and to provide you with important resources for new Muslims<br>  <br>  congratulation again bro and in the name of all muslims i say we are proud of you<br>  <br>  dont hesitate to contact me if you needed any thing<br>  <br>  BR<br>  basem|`|lh2H5oSOaa	The procedure is fairly easy and simple.

It's fairly simple, I understand, involving recitation of a mantra about believing only in the Muslim God and prophet. You have already been given advice by Muslims about weblinks and attending a mosque. However, if you are on-line, you could check out this link as it has something very interesting to say about the Bible containing three Arabic words.

aac509d23ce8da767d68e4f377f3f4c7aa	It's a lot easier to explain them nowadays than it was before evolution became fashionable. Prior to then, virtually the only explanation for life and death was bound up with belief in a creator God - and not just due to what the Bible said about that - most of the other sacred scriptures taught similar stuff. There used to be a sense of awe at how life perpetuates, and dread at the inevitability of death.<br>  <br>  Strangely, despite the massive information we now have on how life and the universe 'works', there seems to be less awe. Non-believers almost seem nonchalant about the wonders of life. And death is shoved aside as if it hardly happens - or, at least, only to other people. It is effectively ignored. It's as if the more materialistic we become, the less able we are to grasp spiritual realities. Anyway, today we have the fifth or sixth generation brought up to believe evolution is the mindless cause of life and that only idiots believe in God. It's actually a wonder that there still are so many people who believe in God. Those who believe in God and who are also prepared to accommodate certain processes of development over long periods of time form a considerable number, yet their voice is hardly ever heard. The anti-God camp would have us believe you either have to be a raging, unrepentant evolutionist, or a brain-dead believer in a totally literal take on Genesis and a 6,000 year old earth.<br>  <br>  The one aspect that is lacking with many non-believers (not all) is a willingness to stop tarring all believers with the same brush. They are so dismissive of believers. Granted, many believers are dismissive of non-believers, so this impasse needs to be dealt with. Can non-believers honestly admit that evolution does not have all the answers or explanations, and can believers admit that the Bible allows for far more in the realms of creation than their literalist approach permits?|`|uLEc9I2aaa	Atheist aren't lacking anything anybody else has. They simply are exercising their freedom of choice (that God gave) to choose life ( the commandments) or death ( their own way). Not all of us want to be ruled by righteousness and those that do have to suffer with the self righteous and lawless until he returns. Everyone that says there is no God have done something that they want to get away with but because they are following their own desires, they will suffer the judgement that is written for them. I don't quite understand why they put so much effort into fighting against immortality and Godhood. If you don't believe in God, then why don't you go somewhere else and use your time to do something fun for yourselves or is it because misery loves company that you try so hard to make everyone as shallow and hopeless as yourselves. Atheist that have not cursed God with their mouth but just don't believe have a better chance at gettng a break when God returns than the so called Christian that is supposed to be his representatives but won't read and follow his word. Actually they fight against the Bible more than Atheist in my opinion.<br>  <br>  Matthew 12:31-32<br>  31Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.<br>  32And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.<br>  <br>  Matthew 7:21-23<br>  21Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. <br>  22Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? <br>  23And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.|`|vQ75GgNnaa	You want to find God through human intellect.<br>  Even when you say there is no God, you still pointing to Him because Creation points to it's Creator.<br>  I wanted to do it too in the past, and I found that human intellect fails when trying to understand God.<br>  God doesn't show him self so you can prove to your self that He exist it's a contradiction to ask a Creator to prove Him self to His Creation.|`|WbaN6osZaa	Christians are taught to despise and pity atheism, this includes branding atheist motives for non-belief as inherently 'evil', 'selfish', 'rebellious', 'hateful' etc.<br>  <br>  Think communist dissidents.

By mans wisdom and device they limit themselves to a mindset of probability and fairness according to their earthly wisdom and  peculiar circumstance finding fault and never coming to the understanding of the truth.<br>  <br>  John 6<br>   43"Stop grumbling among yourselves," Jesus answered. "No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up at the last day. It is written in the Prophets: 'They will all be taught by God.'  Everyone who listens to the Father and learns from him comes to me.   <br>  <br>  John 10 <br>  27My  sheep listen to my voice; I (Jesus) know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one can snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father's hand. I and the Father are one."   <br>  <br>  Romans 9<br>  15 For he (God) says to Moses,  “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy,<br>  and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”<br>  16 It does not, therefore, depend on man’s desire or effort, but on God’s mercy.<br>  <br>  Ephesians 1<br>  4 For he (God) chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight.

ZTPCOiJlaa	Good question.<br>  <br>  Here is the real life example from the scripture<br>  <br>  Yeshua taught his disciples, most of the time they didn't get it.<br>  <br>  After he rose he breathed the spirit into them.<br>  <br>  He said in John14:26<br>  <br>  "But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I said to you. <br>  <br>  And Paul says 1 Cor 2:10-11<br>  For to us God revealed them through the Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God.  <br>  For who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him? Even so the thoughts of God no one knows except the Spirit of God.  <br>  <br>  So in conclusion<br>  <br>  We can be taught the truth but it is the Spirit that gives us understanding and reveals it to us as truth. Apart from the Spirit it is simply just words to us.<br>  <br>  This is why we can learn God's truth and accept Yeshua as our saviour then after receiving the Spirit the truth becomes real to us known to us and we are able to abide in it.<br>  <br>  Who says I can't have my cake and eat it too.<br>  <br>  ps most who claim to know the truth, Are they walking it? If not they just don't have the Spirit regardless of the words their mouth speaks.<br>  <br>  EDIT Welltraveller - nice cherry picking but alas the 1 Corinthians passage goes on to tell us that the wisdom of God is what we need to seek and in the context of Proverbs "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of Knowledge" we can see that the wisdom it speaks of is the wisdom from God and in Ecclesasties we also see from the context that it is the flesh leaning on our own strength wisdom knowledge etc that is empty and vain but the conclusion is (yes welltravler you have to read the whole book to understand it so sorry your cherry picking is shown to be biased and well... unwise) is to Fear God and keep his commandments for this is the whole duty of man.

So much for any proof you have.|`|mVsWyu0yaa	You lose your argument, at the outset, by two  assumptions: 1) that the bible is the Word of God; 2) that the bible contains theTRUTH anymore than the Quran, the Vedas, the Upanishads or the Egyptian Book of the Dead. <br>  <br>  With the exception of a few letters of Paul, we do not know, and may never be able to determine who even WROTE the bible, let alone prove that it was inspired by ANY god. Furthermore, we will never be able to determine if what we call the bible has any connection to the ORIGINAL writings since NOT ONE SINGLE SCRAP Of THE ORIGINAL BIBLICAL WRITINGS HAVE SURVIVED.  <br>  <br>  If there were such a thing as the "inspiration of the Holy Spirit" there would NOT be more than 3,000 different Christian denominations ALL claiming that THEY, and THEY ALONE, have the true "Word of God".   AND the entire world, rather than a mere third, would be CHRISTIAN!!<br>  <br>  It seems the Inspiration of your god has not been able to convince more than a handful of people that his "Word" means anything. Is he not 'inspiring' hard enough?<br>  <br>  Obviously, the only thing that can be 'learnd' from the bible, following the 'inspiration' (and example) of the god of the bible is that it is necessary to HATE and KILL all those who do not accept him as their lord and savior.|`|sCYz5aSuaa	i believe that it can be learned by us to a point but i believe it also has to be revealed to us<br>  i believe that is why a lot of times Christians get more from reading the Bible versus a nonbeliever reading the Bible<br>  but believers have the Holy Spirit residing in them and will reveal to them the things of God, this is shown in 1st Corinthians|`|sA7DuUUBaa	your confusion deemed you into the 2rd stage of cancer from religion. now prohibited  your ability to see logic. you might want to back off and drop religion all together before it hits stage 3. then there is no turning back my friend|`|jCcsDdvYaa	God did not give man the bible at all<br>  <br>  It was all made up to support a Roman Emperor's rule.<br>  <br>  For goodness sake, you have been educated surely and can research the facts.|`|t88527U1aa	Has to be revealed to us as does he.|`|N4ORX2fZaa	The truth of the things of God are written in His word.

The bible says:<br>  <br>  PRO 4:7 "Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding."<br>  <br>  From that, one should take that the bible (i.e. "god") is telling us to get wisdom and understanding -- it's pretty clear.<br>  <br>  But wait!  Later on, it says:<br>  <br>  ECC 1:18 "For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow."<br>  <br>  1CO 1:19: "For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent."<br>  <br>  OK, so now we're *not* suposed to seek wisdom.  First we are, then we aren't...which is it?<br>  <br>  It's a book of myths and fables written by a bunch of ignorant goat herders...why one should think it has any special "truth" is beyond my ability to understand...<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|p6wwiQG3aa	The truths of it are revealed by the indwelling Holy Spirit.

Truth cannot be discovered by thought alone. Any revelation of Truth requires spiritual contemplation, subtle intuition, and pure inspiration. For Truth to set one free, it must be infused within from above. The faculty for such revelation is the human spirit regenerated by and mingled with the Spirit of God.<br>  <br>  WHO can rise (through logical thinking) above what is happening by means of abstract thought about some object to reveal spiritual principles without being impotent to overcome the limitations of human intellect? To say that grace and truth is realized through Jesus Christ is to exclaim to all of the world that there is a novel spiritual way to contemplate what is truth, and that way is a person, who is the way, truth, and life. No longer is man separate from truth and hopelessly led to recognize the limitations of the faculty of the mind to grasping reality, itself. (not that they always recognize their limitations, or else there would be no philosophical systems.) Abiding in truth, by way of the Spirit of God is the destiny of those that are born of the Spirit of God. This is the lone escape from inevitable error.<br>  <br>      John 14<br>      17 that is the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not see Him or know Him, but you know Him because He abides with you and will be in you.<br>  <br>  Christians - Residing in the depths of our souls, He lives in our innermost being. He transcends our soul as the source of truth proceeding in every internal and external manifestations of the soul. In our spirit's core, God's Spirit is formless and without distinction. It does not know about the truth; it IS the truth. The knowledge of the Spirit of Truth is complete. It's essence is total knowledge and all that is is knowable in everything. It knows truth, because it is the truth. There is nothing about truth that it is not, because God knows Himself completely. That is to say that the subject and object of Truth are one, within the life of God.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, thought is a single and distinct plane reflecting the intelligible; it is always in motion between the subject (our mind), and the object (that which is reflected in thought, such as a contemplation.) Whatever is reflected in thought is therefore assimilated only in it's reflected form, not in the reality of that which is being contemplated, and certainly not in its spiritual, universal reality. Thus the Spirit of truth never escapes the depths of our spirit, to be fully manifested in thought, or in the symbolic reflection archived in our minds. The reflection never becomes the reality, and thus Truth is a commodity of our spirits that brings us mentally closer to reality. However, the inherent objective and subjective disconnect between Truth and our thoughts about Truth inevitably persist to the point of error.<br>  <br>  While God's certainty and wisdom are attributable to the unity of all Truth within Himself, conversely, our doubt and error are caused by the mental disunity of distorted thoughts. This brings us back to the necessity of spiritual revelation to supercede any and all mental notions. It is the Spirit of God that leads us to all Truth. Thoughts, through revelation, can be conformed to and effaced by the Spirit of Truth as the only solution for the obstacle of natural reasoning. Divine revelation is the link between soul and spirit, that otherwise would be separated by the abyss of organic limitation. Therefore, I have no Truth to offer anyone; I can only introduce you to the Spirit of Truth, so that you can forsake thought and embrace reality through revelation.<br>  <br>      Isaiah 55<br>      7 Let the wicked forsake his way<br>      And the unrighteous man his thoughts;<br>      And let him return to the LORD,<br>      And He will have compassion on him,<br>      And to our God,<br>      For He will abundantly pardon.<br>      8 "For My thoughts are not your thoughts,<br>      Nor are your ways My ways," declares the LORD.<br>      9 "For as the heavens are higher than the earth,<br>      So are My ways higher than your ways<br>      And My thoughts than your thoughts.<br>  <br>  True to my experience, I have tried and failed to present my erroneous thoughts of Truth to no avail. On one occasion I was trying to impart to my mother a truth that seemed so simplistic as to be unavoidable. But, frustration overwhelmed me during the repeated reasoned explanations. At that point I turned to my spirit, and it was revealed that I should say it once more. Bewildered, I almost could not believe that it would make any difference. Finally, I exercised faith in the revelation, and spoke again. This time the message was plain and simple yet inspired, but the response in my mother was completely different. Before I was half way through my first sentence, I saw perfect understanding in her eyes. The Truth was revealed in her through the faculty of her spirit rather the the subjective mind through mental ascent, or the objective reflection in my thoughts and words. Now that it has been revealed to her, it cannot be reconstructed in her mind, thoughts, or words any more then Truth can be reconstructed in my soul-ish faculties, both internal and external. This was the spiritual reality behind the famous recruitment of Peter:<br>  <br>      Luke 5<br>      4 When He had finished speaking, He said to Simon, "Put out into the deep water and let down your nets for a catch."<br>      5 Simon answered and said, "Master, we worked hard all night and caught nothing, but I will do as You say and let down the nets."<br>      6 When they had done this, they enclosed a great quantity of fish, and their nets began to break;<br>      7 so they signaled to their partners in the other boat for them to come and help them. And they came and filled both of the boats, so that they began to sink.<br>      8 But when Simon Peter saw that, he fell down at Jesus' feet, saying, "Go away from me Lord, for I am a sinful man!"<br>      9 For amazement had seized him and all his companions because of the catch of fish which they had taken;<br>      10 and so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, "Do not fear, from now on you will be catching men."<br>      11 When they had brought their boats to land, they left everything and followed Him.<br>  <br>  So it is when we are used by the Spirit's direction to introduce the sublime implications of the Gospel to others, so that they may know the deep love of God and be filled with joy! It is not by might, nor power, but by His Spirit.|`|QqxZzvbAaa	atheist THINK they have an understanding of God's word but they really don't because they don't have the Holy Spirit guiding them,<br>  we need the Holy Spirit to reveal the truth to us.<br>  without Him we have just a bunch of words on paper.<br>  <br>  <br>  (IFB)|`|iHDYncuXaa	Definately revealed.

If you were born in the medieval age, your thoughts about such things probably would differ.  As time changes, so do morals; that is a fact. Just study history, and you'll see.  I mean it used to be morally accepted to kill people for speaking out against the pope or the catholic church itself.  <br>  <br>  The reason why it isn't now, is because the morals, and social norms have changed since then.  A person once told me that a person makes their own morals.  Well, if that person is corrupt, his/her morals will change if they deem it necessary. Their morals are  like the ocean's waves; they sway every which way. Morals that susceptible to change are dangerous.  If it was ok to kill before, it can be made ok to kill again. It'd be foolish to not believe the possibility.  Wars are proof of that too, country's decide when it's ok to kill people. Everyday in life is a war, people can change, just like laws can change. Don't you dare say that a war can be justified, because killing another is never justified; mass murder is all war is; no side wins.
tRcO5uyiaa	I agree with you. I do not see how spirituality (I don't believe in "fundamental religion") is a setback to mankind, evolutionary or otherwise. It is just part of history, from the beginning of creation of this world. I don't understand why so many people fight against it, argue about it, and scream at those of us who believe in God. Jesus is the Son of God and He is the only way to God. The evolutionists argue that we were evolved from 'apes'. Animals that use all four limbs, crawl around on the ground and in trees, pick lice and mites off each other and eat them, and those evolutionists expect me to believe that I am an ancestor of that? Not bloody likely. None of those who are supporters of evolution can ever tell us believers why the apes (our alleged ancestors) have not evolved along with mankind and other creatures. They cannot answer it.|`|Buw4VWnRaa	Yes, It is doubtful, as in 'WRONG' doubtful|`|5ca75672cdf5c0a56be5e785cba499c8aa	It (evolution) can't even go forward much less backward.Remember "It " is only a theory...and one which still defies explanation by the best "so called" scientists of today.One day the darwinists will meet their Creator and I can assure you that He didn't evolve from the bottom of an ocean,nor did they.A word to the wise is sufficient.|`|M7ZU8VQfaa	The person was referring to the evolution of human society not the human species.

AA11155311	Being a grandpa and Nana of two beautiful grandson and granddaughter, I would say it is the most wonderful time of ones life.<br>  You will see your reflections in them. Their smile, giggles and facial expressions are awesome.<br>  Your kids if well guided, will be responsible and caring persons once they come to that bridge of becoming a parent. Don't worry a bit. Let them surprise you..as my son did it and it was a shocking but wonderful surprise.|`|5sNOUCRKaa	Being a grandparent was one of greatest happening in my life you can teach love them and send them home. mine are now in high school and college so I miss having them around but they know Iam a sucker for them I would believe anything they told me .I  could just eat em up they are pure angels to me its just hard get use to them having there own life.|`|s9vMILLMaa	When you pick up your first grandchild you simply wont believe the experience. It is as dear as when you picked up your child. We have it in us to respond to them. No need to worry.... it will be a fantastic experience... and you will be scheming of ways to spoil this little one before ya even know what hit you.|`|IS7Xubkfaa	I can't say. I am not one.|`|a380da2fafb5a1c092370a06829451f8aa	I've never been so "in love" !  It's God's reward to you for putting up with teenagers!|`|rMP9BCyGaa	It is wonderful to be a grandparent!  I had the privilege of being at the birth of my 1st grandson and WOW it was just so magical....not so magical for my daughter considering he came out breech but magical for me!  I was the 1st person apart from the midwife to hold him coz his mum was exhausted and that was a wonderfully magical experience and an honour to boot!<br>  We have 2 grandsons ages 8 and 9 and it is lovely having them visit.<br>  Stop being a worry wart and look forward to the day when you too can have the fun with grandchildren.  Your kids will always be your kids so the one thing you will have to hold off from doing is telling them they are doing things 'wrong' when raising their own.  It won't be wrong, it will be different.<br>  And remember, the one pleasure you will have with grandkids is handing them back after they visit lol.|`|IWyrJ7o3aa	My grandchildren are the light of my life. It is feeling you want understand until you have one of your own. When they come up to you and climb up and your lap and say mamaw , I love you. You are the best mamaw in the world. Your heart just melts.. It is one of the best feelings in the world.|`|AA10462593	It is the best feeling in the whole world..far better than being a mother..and that goes without saying as I raised one grandson..|`|G4vFjh0yaa	This poem says it better than I can. I will just say that it has been a wonderful experience. <br>  <br>  Grandparents bestow upon<br>  their grandchildren<br>  The strength and wisdom that time<br>  And experience have given them.<br>  <br>  Grandchildren bless their Grandparents<br>  With a youthful vitality and innocence<br>  That help them stay young at heart forever.<br>  <br>  Together they create a chain of love<br>  Linking the past with the future.<br>  The chain may lengthen,<br>  But it will never part....<br>  <br>  ~~Author Unknown.~~|`|AA11017231	It's wonderful. I'm just one of the kids but with alot of wisdom and understanding that I convey to them without them even realizing it. We have a great time. Their momma's even treat me like one of the kids when we get too rowdy and stuff.|`|80lWqRFiaa	Wonderful, all the joys you had with your own , and when you have had your fill they go home. hahaha   But seriously it is the best thing to happen to me. 6 times.|`|rJJhMQ37aa	We always tend to think of our own children as not quite grown, not quite responsible enough, not quite able to provide food, shelter, etc.<br>  <br>  I hovered over my daughter for a while.  Watched her.  She asked me a few things, like how to give baby a bath, how to get that little air bubble up.  Money wise, she needed help with babysitting, and a little bit of help - not much - with providing things.  Her Dad and I would buy a new coat, or some item for the little one.<br>  <br>  Mostly, she did well.  She had pride in her own ability, and did not want help from us for most things.  And now, she has a good job, a home of her own, etc.  We don't have to help, but do voluntarily give the kids a few things.  She's a really good Mommy, too.
AQBow7Glaa	I don't remember anyone called "Satan" tempting Eve.  <br>  <br>  My Bible has a talking snake called "The Serpent" tempting Eve.  I see no support in my Bible for the conclusion that the serpent is anything other than a serpent.  This guy "Satan" doesn't show up in my Bible until the second half.<br>  <br>  You would think Bible literalists would be more rigorous about this kind of thing, but no.|`|LZJPMl8raa	God has access to the past, present, and the future.

Satan's just a puny fallen angel. Nothing compared to the omnipotent God...<br>  <br>  Yes, good point, though. It also comes int play that God is known to know all....his omniscient powers, you see. So he knew all this would take place, and let it happen.<br>  <br>  But then that brings the fact that we committed Original sin. But all of my assumptions above are "interpretations". So perhaps we've just interpreted everything incorrectly.|`|Buw4VWnRaa	He did. It says so in Genesis.

G9R6VZOXaa	The bird was still living wild.  It just happened to be living wild in your property.<br>  <br>  Get your revenge.  Call the local animal care people and tip them off that they have been mistreating their animal  (and then make a donation to the charity!)<br>  <br>  Oh, and make sure you go and visit your peacock!|`|Fo9ADQLBaa	Now Rick, I know those birds are in living color when it comes to the noise they make!  <br>  I wonder if that could have added to your neighbor's decision as well.  :D|`|UbvglIS6aa	That's sad.  The bird should certainly have defended itself from the cat.  And people should have removed the cat and not the bird...GEEEEEEEEZZZZZZ|`|BD8O7RR3aa	This is so weird b/c me and my family caught a peacock in our garage once - it was just roaming the streets of the city.  So weird!  We called animal control and they took it to the zoo.  <br>  <br>  I don't know. I mean, wild animals should not be kept as pets.  I might have done the same thing (even w/o the cat/peacock fight) if I were your neighbor and you hadn't called yet.|`|GomZ9oYHaa	That bird is best off being in the wild or the zoo. just like this chimp that bit off this womans hands and mauled her face..I think all exotic animals need to be protected from humans either a zoo or let out in the wild.|`|N73oZyY8aa	Well, it is an exotic. I think the bird will get proper care and be safe at the zoo. And won't hurt the cat. I know what you mean but still, I'm on the fence about it.|`|5gKg5S0vaa	It all depends on the laws in your country!  If you have the right to keep the peacock in your garden without permits etc then they had no right to take it. As for the cat incident the feline was encroaching on his territory and it had every right to defend it's self, if the peacock jumped the fence to your neighbours garden then that's a whole new ball game, your neighbour had every right to complain.  <br>  <br>  A peacock doesn't belong in a zoo! Aside from the fact that they are extremely beautiful I can't see the difference from keeping ducks or chickens!! Quite a few people where I work keep them as pets and they are left to wander the countryside,  I don't know how many times one has glided over the roof of my car while I've been driving down the road.  They are exotic, but they are just birds after all.  There are plenty of indigenous species roaming the countryside.|`|FpMS47sXaa	UGH!<br>  <br>  I hate that. People act as if animals are never suppose to be wild, bite you when threatened, or just be plain old animals.<br>  <br>  My dogs have gotten into fights. Even injured, but that's what happens. It's natural. Granted, if an injury is very severe, I take them to the vet, but just a bite or a scrap or something - it will heal.<br>  <br>  In the town that I grew up in, we had wild peacocks. No one ever bothered with them. Nowadays, they are all gone, and so are the deer that would come right up to your house.|`|4KNESOnlaa	WOW, I would sue the county....they had no right...I would call the local news and then call the ZOO and tell them you will Sue....that's a violation of your rights...|`|MYIwyTpcaa	Okay am I the only one picking up on this whole co*k vs. pus*y thing *lmao* Well played, Ric you sly devil you !! :^D|`|36b213c16926132fde2d00722cbf60d3aa	Awww, I bet you miss that bird.

We kids were<br>  absolutely terrified of him.<br>  If we were off school for any reason and he saw us out<br>  he would stop us and question us.  He was known to<br>  march you back to school.  I was a goody 2 shoes so never<br>  had any dealings with him, but I gave him a wide berth and<br>  had a healthy respect for him.<br>  Amazing that I can still remember him after all these years,<br>  I have a vivid picture of him in my mind as I type this.|`|lm9fUhOSaa	No, not really.<br>  <br>  Don't think the government could afford a school bobby when i went to school.

Also on numerous occassion if you did or were about to do something wrong the it was always the same "I'll send for the Polis" or "The Polis will get ye". Another expression that terrified many a child if being naughty was "You'll get takin' away in the Black Maria"  (perhaps spelt Black Mariah) as in the big van the police used when arresting people or taking them to court. What threats, parents would not dare say such things nowadays but don't know anyone that these sayings did any harm to.|`|G4vFjh0yaa	It was my grandpa so yes it was more than a little intimidating sometimes.<br>  <br>  But other times it kept the bullies in check as well.<br>  <br>  Our Village was small so everyone that was a parent was a "School Bobby" and skipping school was real tough around there.|`|18f4aeb76a3e8aee506482a962921d26aa	No. If you have to resort to such threats, then it could be that you are not giving your kids the moral guidance they deserve.

aSoCKVJ3aa	Yes, I do think it's important.  But much has gone by the wayside in today's world.  <br>  <br>  I did have a few semesters of manners, poise, and etiquette when I was in high school in my Home Economics classes.  Maybe there are some schools who still teach it.<br>  <br>  If manners and etiquette have not been taught (by the parents) when the children are younger, by the time they reach young adulthood, then it's probably too late for a class.  They will have to learn by life lessons.   : )|`|UOIcXs7Haa	That is something parents are supposed to teach their children.

urIm4YaBaa	No.<br>  <br>  1 - Atheism is not a social system, like the items you listed. It is a lack of belief, and says nothing about views the person holds as true.<br>  <br>  2 - There's actually no such thing as something that "works in paper (or as abstractions), but fails in reality." If the ideas "on paper" held a correct view of reality in the first place, then it wouldn't work during the planning or deliberation stages, either. <br>  <br>  3 - Atheism "works" in the sense that it doesn't do anything. It merely excludes a particular entity from any scheme used for another purpose. For example, a deity would not be included as part of an understanding of reality, which a person would need to use in order to live successfully. The only way Atheism could "not work" was if:<br>  (1) There was a deity (that would make it wrong); and:<br>  (2) This fact has a direct bearing on day-to-day living.<br>  The second reason is why Atheists sometimes succeed in their goals and live without loneliness, fear, or depression, and this fact doesn't (and shouldn't) make believers have doubts about their faith.|`|oojO4WAraa	No.  Atheism is very clear.  There is no god.  Very simple.<br>  <br>  I agree religion falls in that category.|`|i6d582PFaa	There is nothing abstract about Stocism since it relies only on the five senses (not even the sixth sense the mind)<br>  <br>  as for atheism it is not abstract but rather the absence of abstraction (God)<br>  <br>  True spirituality is the transcendence of temporal personality and ego in order to experience the divine light and final abode which is the very soul.|`|ceb16f840e65f504a04160992a9e8736aa	Interesting question.  I disagree with you.<br>  <br>  Atheism is just the word we use to describe someone who doesn't believe in a god.  It's not a philosophy in and of itself.  Now if you replaced the word "atheism" with say nihilism, then I might agree.|`|WalnRzfGaa	congratulations for asking the dumbest question of the day, you will receive your award through Email at the time of the rapture.|`|HOQp0gA7aa	I think Metal Dog has a very close to accurate argument about atheism as an abstraction.  As an abstraction it is just a label applied to people who don't have a belief in the divine.  There is not a system of practices, or a philosophy of behavior which backs Atheism like most religions promote.  <br>  <br>  This is also why Atheism is claimed to have no morality.  The funny thing is that when that claim is made, the self proclaimed Atheist will profoundly go on about how Atheists are more moral than religious followers.  How can having a single tenant of not having a belief in God establish an implicit morality I would ask?  You would have to back that claim of morality with a statement which establishes a moral philosophy.   <br>  <br>  Thus we get to the crux of the original question which is since people who claim to be ideologically Atheist and moral Atheists, there must be a philosophy of Atheism which exists in the abstract even if it hasn't been formally codified.  Otherwise there are not moral Atheists.  They are moral secular humanists, or moral rationalists, or moral _____ which have a philosophy of moral behavior.  A moral Atheist would be a misnomer since an Atheist espouses nothing about behavior as a part of their Atheism.  <br>  <br>  In this light the question might be better rephrased as follows:<br>  <br>  For those who self identify as Atheists, what philosophy of moral behavior do you subscribe to follow.  How do you know this philosophy of moral behavior can work for everyone outside of the abstract?<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|WbaN6osZaa	Can non-belief in leprechauns only function well as an abstract ideal/thought?<br>  <br>  Can non-belief in Odin only function well as an abstract ideal/thought?<br>  <br>  Can non-belief in Shiva only function well as an abstract ideal/thought?<br>  <br>  Etc...etc...etc...<br>  <br>  Question:  Who is feeding you the lie that non-belief in deities is a political ideology?<br>  <br>  There is your answer.|`|fNw4wJSGaa	Atheism is only a lack of belief in Gods and the supernatural.<br>  <br>  It's not a philosophy, it doesn't unite people, it's just a label.<br>  <br>  Marxism, anarchy, Humanism....these are all philosophies that have a set of ideas that go with them.<br>  <br>  So no, atheism is not a "abstract" idea.|`|79529314dfb5ac7be366558924c3393baa	I don't think so. I do think that humans have a natural tendency to be religious and superstitious, evolved over hundreds of thousands of years as hunter/gatherers, but I also think it's entirely possible for people of sufficient rationality and will power to overcome that tendency and become true atheists on a permanent basis.|`|Gf5nMPJXaa	You are assuming atheism is a cause or purpose.  It is merely a lack of belief.  Atheism wants nothing per se.  Organized atheist groups exist merely to withstand religious hegemony and legislation , not to push their own (again nonexistent) agenda|`|a6f5efb2cbade02a525b433574402dc8aa	Atheism isn't meant to function as anything, it's simply a disbelief in the existence of gods, nothing else.

It is a state of perception, i.e., in the viewing of the reality around me, I do not perceive the necessity of any god or deity because I perceive alternate explanations that are far more likely and rational to me.<br>  <br>  As I view it, anything that is considered an abstract must have a corresponding concrete...for example, numbers are abstract..."2" is an abstract...but the concrete would be if I had 2 ice cream cones. They correspond to each other. Atheism has no corresponding concrete, although theism does, i.e., theism is the abstract, the literal existence of the god or deity is the concrete.  That being said, I do not categorize atheism as an abstract.  The only way around this that I can see is if you were to say atheism is the abstract, the non-existence of gods or deities is the concrete...which does not logically follow, at least to me because the non-existence would have to be shown to be absolute, which is not actually possible since I know of no person or process that possesses or delivers absolute knowledge.|`|M7ZU8VQfaa	Atheism is not a religion, nor is it an ideology.

You don't worry about products for body parts you don't have. You also probably don't worry about removing hair from the same places we do. Some of these places require different products. <br>  <br>  The makeup removers actually make it easier to remove make up than using soap and water so you aren't pulling at your skin.   I use plain old cold cream - cheap, moisturizes, works. I'm guessing you don't wear make up at all, never mind the waterproof kind that are a pain to remove, so you don't have any bottles for that. <br>  <br>  You can probably cross all the nail polish related products off your list too. There are a few of those. <br>  <br>  For the rest of it, I couldn't tell you. Ask them.

(the blood that Jesus shed while on the cross.)<br>  <br>  It's not literal, as that would be gross lol. and it's just another annoying aspect of Christianity I like to call "Christian-ese".

Baptism for the remission of sins predates Christianity as a ritual to symbolize washing off the filth of the world in preparation to appear before God. You recall Jesus was himself bapatized in this ritual. But in John's baptism did not save you in the resurrection, whereas being baptized in Christ means baptized into his crucifixion as well, thus paying for your sins. Baptism is also in a sense to be buried and raised to new life. (Col2:12)<br>  <br>  Revelation 7:15<br>  And he said, "These are they who have come out of the great tribulation; they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Therefore, "they are before the throne of God and serve him day and night in his temple; and he who sits on the throne will spread his tent over them.<br>  <br>  The whole atonement thing is pretty barbarous any way you look at it.|`|3d7f120f2bf9906d7333799542b3a295aa	When God allowed Jesus to die, God was able to judge and condemn death as gulity because death took an innocent man.

But, when adam and eve ate from the tree of Knowledge (its knowledge or god, catch that?) and they tried to blame it on the snake, it didnt matter, everyone got punished, including snakes! wich is not fair at all becouse it was the devil dressed as one, not a real snake. and im not adam or eve, so what the hell? it was their choice not mine! but when its god in the driver seat, its not his fault, its yours! so the question isnt, how could a loving god send us to hell? the question is, how could a loving god allow us to choose hell? i dont tell my kids sticking things in the electric socket is bad, i know becouse i did it, got burned in your place so that you might turn and learn, then leave them to their curiosity, while constantly monitoring them, then, if its their choice, let them jam crap in the socked! hell no! im a real father! not that peice of crap joke of a dad in that story book you guys are brain washed into beleiving is the auther of love! im sure your only defense by now is, who am i, a mear stinky mortal to question almighty gods plan! sorry folks, i choose knowledge over god. so the answer is, their is no hell to go to, but if their was, no, atheist do not choose to go to hell, lets say their was a god, we are just using the brains he gave us, examining the world around us, and the fact that he left no evidence of his existance besides a debated, contridicting 3000 year old constantly re-written book as proof, as oppose to fossils, geology and every other feild of science that shows the bibles logic is phading daily by us "sinfull stupid mortals", i would asume if he really was all loving he would understand. also, how can the supposidly most forgiving being not forgive after death? their is no god, their is no hell, their is only peoples imaginations clashing with whats realing going on in reality.

(May the road come up to meet you & the wind be at your back, etc.)  It would be interesting to see how many variations you get on the same thing.  <br>  <br>  You could ask them how they fix some common food, such as eggs scrambled with sliced potatoes mixed in, & whether they eat it with ketchup or what.  Or maybe you could ask what else they like that is made with potatoes, such as potato pancakes (made with mashed potatoes instead of grated potato latkes, which Jewish people make?) or maybe potato soup.  Ask what kind of bread they like as a traditional bread & if there were any vegetables, perhaps root vegetables, that were easier to grow than others in Ireland.  Did they eat many cold climate veggies, such as cabbage & cauliflower?<br>  <br>  Did their family own cows & make its own butter & cheese, or were those luxuries? Did they have their own sheep or goats for making woolens? What did they use for weaving woolens?<br>  <br>  Ask what was eaten during times when corned beef was not available & when potatoes were not available.  Did their family do any ocean fishing? What kind of fish? By boat or what?<br>  <br>  You might also ask what non-alcoholic they consider to be traditional.  After all, what did they drink with their daily meals, & what did the children drink?<br>  <br>  You could find out if they have any stories about invisible beings or forest beings, such as pixies or fairies or devas.  Oh, yeah, leprechauns.  You could do a little advance research on this & anything else you plan to ask..  Most cultures, including Native American cultures, Europe, & Asia, have some version on this theme of little people.  What were the traditional stories before Christianity? Did Christianity incorporate any of those stories in order to win over the people? What were the traditional Goddess stories, if they know? Or stories of traditional female healers or mid-wives.  They might not even know, so be cautious about offending any Christians or Catholics.<br>  <br>  Ask if they have any stories from days when their family immigrated.  <br>  <br>  Do they have any tales about old land bridges to other countries on land that was once above water?

6Whz1p5Eaa	Well, first we have to understand that the Bible is not really one book, it's dozens of books. Most of these books have different authors, and were written at different times in different places. So, when we are reading a particular story in the Bible, and want to understand what it means, we have to examine what book it's in, who wrote it and why, and then we can begin to determine what it means.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	I'll give you something you never thought about. I am a Catholic. The first question in any Bible reading should be 'IS this an essential ?" Whether Balaam's Donkey talked or whether Eve ate an apple or a pomegranate is an Inessential, meaning that to say ANY answer is the answer is not a matter of Faith.<br>  <br>  And so you don't think I'm ducking your real question, here are the rules of interpretation from the Catholic Catechism :<br>  <br>  3 CRITERIA<br>  three criteria for interpreting Scripture in accordance with the Spirit who inspired it.78<br>  <br>  112 1. Be especially attentive "to the content and unity of the whole Scripture". Different as the books which compose it may be, Scripture is a unity by reason of the unity of God's plan, of which Christ Jesus is the center and heart, open since his Passover.79<br>  <br>      The phrase "heart of Christ" can refer to Sacred Scripture, which makes known his heart, closed before the Passion, as the Scripture was obscure. But the Scripture has been opened since the Passion; since those who from then on have understood it, consider and discern in what way the prophecies must be interpreted.80<br>  <br>  113 2. Read the Scripture within "the living Tradition of the whole Church". According to a saying of the Fathers, Sacred Scripture is written principally in the Church's heart rather than in documents and records, for the Church carries in her Tradition the living memorial of God's Word, and it is the Holy Spirit who gives her the spiritual interpretation of the Scripture (". . . according to the spiritual meaning which the Spirit grants to the Church"81).<br>  <br>  114 3. Be attentive to the analogy of faith.82 By "analogy of faith" we mean the coherence of the truths of faith among themselves and within the whole plan of Revelation. <br>  <br>  THE 4 SENSES of SCRIPTURE <br>  The senses of Scripture<br>  <br>  115 According to an ancient tradition, one can distinguish between two senses of Scripture: the literal and the spiritual, the latter being subdivided into the allegorical, moral and anagogical senses. The profound concordance of the four senses guarantees all its richness to the living reading of Scripture in the Church.<br>  <br>  116 The literal sense is the meaning conveyed by the words of Scripture and discovered by exegesis, following the rules of sound interpretation: "All other senses of Sacred Scripture are based on the literal."83<br>  <br>  117 The spiritual sense. Thanks to the unity of God's plan, not only the text of Scripture but also the realities and events about which it speaks can be signs.<br>  <br>  1. The allegorical sense. We can acquire a more profound understanding of events by recognizing their significance in Christ; thus the crossing of the Red Sea is a sign or type of Christ's victory and also of Christian Baptism.84<br>  <br>  2. The moral sense. The events reported in Scripture ought to lead us to act justly. As St. Paul says, they were written "for our instruction".85<br>  <br>  3. The anagogical sense (Greek: anagoge, "leading"). We can view realities and events in terms of their eternal significance, leading us toward our true homeland: thus the Church on earth is a sign of the heavenly Jerusalem.86|`|719261d758e0cebf5beeb6101b21166faa	Other than seminary professors I'm not sure many Christians could define allegory or metaphor. Damn few on these pages. Most on here just know it's something the atheists call God's inerrant and infallible word when they want to fornicate. <br>  <br>  Heaven Bound, there is an inherent conflict between "no scripture is a matter of private interpretation" and at the same time claiming you are getting your private interpretations revealed by the Holy Spirit. 2 Peter 1:21 says "For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost." This verse clearly is speaking of OT prophets, not of you.|`|6354f9b17eeb910a803f8ef20a4505afaa	When you see an allegory or a metaphor, then start looking for the literal interpretation of it.  Jesus spoke in parables but He interpreted them to the disciples later on.<br>  <br>  When reading Scripture we are told to "read line upon line, precept upon precept and here a little and there a little."  Often in one verse, you will have history in 2 different time lines.  What has been will be or what will be has already been.  There is nothing new under the sun.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	instead of fancy labels just get a scholar Bible with grreat footnotes....mine is NRSV Life application....it explains alot of stuff|`|j0oU4V3baa	it's whatever they want it to be. they make stuff up and cherry pick.<br>  <br>  Great question!|`|TEX1iYQgaa	You determine those things the same way you do in other forms of literature.<br>  <br>  Why is this so hard for people to understand?<br>  <br>  I think the big stumbling point for people is when it comes to what is literal.

A story that has both a literal and symbolic meaning.<br>  <br>  To determine if a verse is literal, you have to look at the style of writing, whether or not it lends itself to a literal interpretation, and the context in which it is presented. It is usually quite simple. If a verse can be interpreted literally, and there is no reason in the context to think it's meaning is any other, you can take it literally. <br>  For example:<br>  when in Genesis, it says "and the morning and evening" you can interpret that as a literal 24 hour day because nothing in the context indicates otherwise, and the text actually uses the literal "morning and evening" to further affirm that it is one day. You can therefore know the text is not allegorical or metaphorical. <br>  <br>  Another way to tell is when people are addressed by name, or by the word certain, as in "a certain man," or in the story of Lazarus and the rich man, where Lazarus is referred to by name. This means there was an actual man known to the person telling the story. <br>  This is also seen in the story of Adam and Eve, where they are also mentioned by name.|`|0puMsQJgaa	Dear T,<br>  <br>  No one can UNDERSTAND the Bible till they are "Born Again" by the Holy Spirit of GOD!<br>  <br>  (1Corinthians 2:14)  But the = = natural man = = does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are = foolishness to him; = neither can he know them, = because they are spiritually discerned.<br>  <br>  IF you are Born Again, email me, and I will explain those concepts to you!<br>  <br>  IF you are NOT Born Again... all the Explanation will do No Good!<br>  <br>  Thanks for Asking!

We believe that through the Atonement of Christ, all mankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel.<br>  <br>     4.

We believe that a man must be called of God, by prophecy, and by the laying on of hands by those who are in authority, to preach the Gospel and administer in the ordinances thereof.<br>  <br>     6. We believe in the same organization that existed in the Primitive Church, namely, apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists, and so forth.<br>  <br>     7. We believe in the gift of tongues, prophecy, revelation, visions, healing, interpretation of tongues, and so forth.<br>  <br>     8. We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly; we also believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God.<br>  <br>     9. We believe all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God.<br>  <br>    10. We believe in the literal gathering of Israel and in the restoration of the Ten Tribes; that Zion (the New Jerusalem) will be built upon the American continent; that Christ will reign personally upon the earth; and, that the earth will be renewed and receive its paradisiacal glory.<br>  <br>    11. We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, let them worship how, where, or what they may.<br>  <br>    12. We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates, in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law.<br>  <br>    13. We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men; indeed, we may say that we follow the admonition of Paul—We believe all things, we hope all things, we have endured many things, and hope to be able to endure all things. If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things.<br>  <br>  for more info, follow the link to www.mormon.org|`|dc00e6f724cc094e75dc0475843d0e44aa	We follow the Bible.

We believe that the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel are: first, Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; second, Repentance; third, Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; fourth, Laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost.<br>  <br>  5. We believe that a man must be called of God, by prophecy, and by the laying on of hands by those who are in authority, to preach the Gospel and administer in the ordinances thereof.<br>  <br>  6. We believe in the same organization that existed in the Primitive Church, namely, apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists, and so forth.<br>  <br>  7. We believe in the gift of tongues, prophecy, revelation, visions, healing, interpretation of tongues, and so forth.<br>  <br>  8. We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly; we also believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God.<br>  <br>  9. We believe all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God.<br>  <br>  10. We believe in the literal gathering of Israel and in the restoration of the Ten Tribes; that Zion (the New Jerusalem) will be built upon the American continent; that Christ will reign personally upon the earth; and, that the earth will be renewed and receive its paradisiacal glory.<br>  <br>  11. We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, let them worship how, where, or what they may.<br>  <br>  12. We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates, in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law.<br>  <br>  13. We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men; indeed, we may say that we follow the admonition of Paul--We believe all things, we hope all things, we have endured many things, and hope to be able to endure all things. If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things.<br>  <br>  -Joseph Smith|`|xyIZv6iiaa	<a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/a_of_f/1/1#1" rel="nofollow">http://scriptures.lds.org/a_of_f/1/1#1</a><br>  <br>  these are our articles of faith.

President (mormon prophet) Lorenzo Snow said, "As god once was, man is. As God is, man may become." <br>  <br>  In order to reach this exalted state of godhood, a person must first become a good Mormon, pay a full ten percent tithe to the Mormon church, follow various laws and ordinances of the church, and be found worthy.  At this point, they receive a temple recommend whereupon, the Mormon is allowed to enter their sacred temples in order to go through  set of secret rituals: baptism for the dead, celestial marriage, and various oaths of secrecy and commitment. Additionally, four secret handshakes are taught so the believing Mormon, upon entering the third level of Mormon heaven, can shake hands with god in a certain pattern. This celestial ritual is for the purpose of permitting entrance into the highest level of heaven.<br>   For those who achieve this highest of heavens, exaltation to godhood awaits them. Then, he or she, will be permitted to have his or her own planet and be the god of his own world and the Mormon system will be expanded to other planets.<br>  (I'm not kidding)<br>  <br>  SEE..<a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&rlz=1T4GGLJ_enUS317&q=carm+mormon" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=na...</a><br>  There was so much information, that was not told to me while a member. <br>  Do not convert with out knowing real mormon history and beliefs.<br>  <br>  Mormonism in a Nutshell<br>  SEE..<br>  <a href="http://www.carm.org/religious-movements/mormonism/mormonism-nutshell" rel="nofollow">http://www.carm.org/religious-movements/...</a>|`|1e86a17cf7d3d6bd5f1d1eb0376ee828aa	What you ask is best done in a format that allows for communication back and forth.

He wondered why from church to church, why things were different, that surely the Lord would have "one" gospel.  So, in a humble prayer, he asked the Lord and God our Father and Christ appeared to him telling him none of the churches had the full truth and that a restoration was needed.  <br>  <br>  Sounds kind of hard to believe right?  Well, that is why we encourage all to find out for themselves, if his story is true or  not.  Read the Book of Mormon, pray to your Heavenly Father and ask.

The Church that Christ established was to be run by the apostles.  As apostles died, initially they were replaced.  Without apostles, prophets and revelation, the teachings of men crept into and mingled with scripture to become 'religion' and church practice. Therefore, there needed to be a restoration to the pure and simple gospel of Jesus Christ and a restoration of the priesthood authority.  God needed to call a prophet and apostles to head His church in the last dispensation.  This process was started when a young boy of 14 went into the woods to pray about which Church was correct as there seemed to be so much confusion between Christian sects.  His prayer was answered thru a visitation from God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ.  Over the next 8 years [and indeed the remainder of his life], Joseph received many visitations and instruction from heavenly messengers.  Among these were instructions from Moroni of gold plates hidden in a stone box in a nearby hill which detailed the dealings of God and the visitation of Jesus Christ to an ancient people in the Americas.  Joseph was also visited by John the Baptist and the apostles Peter, James and John - from whom he received the priesthood of God by those who held the authority anciently.  Joseph tranlated those gold plates and from this, we have the Book of Mormon. Under the direction of Jesus Christ, Joseph organized the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and appointed prophets, apostles, pastors, teachers, etc on April 6th 1830.|`|AnW3dzQfaa	Ask your friends.

Now ask yourself, is it possible for a given person to both one, have long hair, and two, believe that God exists and that Jesus is the divine son of God and the savior of humanity from sin? Yes, of course it is. The length of one's hair and the nature of one's beliefs about God and Jesus are two rather independent characteristics of a person.|`|WQvqLnnhaa	We dont know that Jesus had long hair.

I get a little tired of all of it. You're all too sensitive and when you ACT like a breed far removed from all others, that's how you'll be treated. Many white folks have endured racism. I'm Irish and look at what the Irish endured when they first arrived in America. Everyone has their sob stories to tell but, we're ALL living in a multi-racial society and we'd better learn to get along. Set an example and BE how you want to be treated. "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you". There will always be assholes out there. Race, religion, politics and financial status will bring out differences in people and all we can do is toughen up and deal with it as we know best or crawl under a rock and hide. Being politically correct and lies and fluff doesn't show respect. Freedom of speech is something we need to stand behind, even when it offends us. Look at the new principals of schools being unable to mention God...that's unbelieveable! Yet, Witchcraft, voodoo, war, tyranny and teenage pregnancy is a common topic of conversation....and that's ok?????<br>  Anyway, so what if you think a chimp, a watermelon or KFC symbolized something offensive. I don't like being teased about red hair or freckles or the fact that I like to keep my black truck muddy... So what if you're offended. Who isn't on a daily basis. We are ALL treated like idiots, by the media, the government and the most arrogant of all, people with money who believe everyone else are idiots for not having it. GET OVER IT. LIVE AND LET LIVE. LIFE SUCKS THEN YOU DIE. The only thing that matters in life is that your SOUL is in tact and that you love God and are a good person. Everything else is only crap that's not important. Read the book: "Don't sweat the small stuff because it's all small stuff". Anyone who offends you knowingly is just someone who you should feel sorry for because they haven't learned yet about LOVE and they don't have much self respect if they need to belittle another to feel better about themselves...Toughen up girl...And remember, the Post and any other media is owned by the same people who want to eliminate our freedoms and basically are mindfucking everyone who watches television...Turn it off!

In the large sense of that word, everything is a religion, drinking tea is my religion, money can be a religion. "We don't have a diety" - everybody has a diety - money, health, fashion, capitalism, Jesus, animals. It is something that you do something because of. Christians do it because of Jesus. People go to work because of money (not always tho). <br>  <br>  On the other note, is disbelieving not a belief? ... is lack of communication not a type of communication.

If you god believers stop having yours, there is no need to have his.|`|2gRrmPsvaa	Atheism is not a religion because you have nothing to believe in. God doesn't have to prove Himself. Either you trust Him or you don't. What, did we build Earth and create ourselves? What happens to you when you die? Where do you go? Where do you put your faith? Only because you can't see Him or audibly speak to Him, is probably the primary reason you don't believe in anything, so you put your belief in doubting Him. There's more evidence that supports God's existence than there is that supports that He doesn't. Even if the Big Bang was possible, a huge collision of atoms being able to make a human eye, it wouldn't be able to work. Perhaps God doesn't believe in you.|`|8Zey1ntAaa	Remember, "god" is nothing more than a nonsense word created by man to explain away all of the things we can't yet understand.<br>  <br>  Religion is a disease of the mind, born of fear, which has done nothing but bring untold misery down upon the human race.|`|baQodlHWaa	We're not all in the same camp.

AA11058044	From Miriam-Webster:<br>  <br>  Empirical evidence: relying on experience or observation alone often without due regard for system and theory <br>  <br>  Hmm... I suppose by that definition, there might indeed be "empirical" evidence for your supposition.|`|aPuUuWlLaa	I don't think you have a clue what the expression empirical evidence means, aside from not being able to spell it correctly.<br>  <br>  <br>  From the dictionary. Religion:<br>  1. a. Belief in and reverence for a supernatural power or powers regarded as creator and governor of the universe.<br>  b. A personal or institutionalized system grounded in such belief and worship.<br>  2. The life or condition of a person in a religious order.<br>  3. A set of beliefs, values, and practices based on the teachings of a spiritual leader.<br>  4. A cause, principle, or activity pursued with zeal or conscientious devotion.<br>  <br>  Atheists don't believe in or worship a supernatural being so that rules out the first 2. The 3rd one is why some godless religions or philosophies such as some branches of Hinduism or Buddhism are religions. They are based on spiritual teaching and leaders that they adhere to in order to be Buddhists for example you pretty much follow the teachings of Buddha. Atheist have no such leader they follow no matter how much some theists dislike Dawkins and want to think he speaks for and is responsible for everyone who is atheist.<br>  <br>  As for number 4 I think its the use of the word figuratively. As in he is religious about collecting stamps. I still wouldn't say that makes atheism a religion. Some atheists may pursue the goal of advocating secular society or educating people about the dangers of religious fanaticism but that would only make them religious about a cause not atheism a religion. Particularly considering atheists cover a broad spectrum in how vocal or interested in the topic they are.|`|4d16b72ffa495ae128ab9f89679fc203aa	Empirically, atheists do not benefit from tax-exemptions like religious churches, synagogues, temples and mosques do.<br>  <br>  Empirically, atheists do not claim to follow any holy book like religions do.|`|gASz3hDWaa	It is a belief without the supernatural which has no hope for the future of humanity.|`|4qj98nhdaa	Religion is a belief in something tangible, it is not a disbelief.<br>  <br>  Atheists disbelieve - end of story|`|dDprsKZYaa	Calling atheism a religion is like calling bald a hair color.|`|z4Yeofq8aa	No. Would I want to prove it - no.

nw0fqXj9aa	Nothing. Which it why it fails.|`|DWJOMWQ8aa	Does it have to be scientific to be true. Some things you just need to have faith in. <br>  <br>  Evolution is not scientific fact either.|`|OQdPzl15aa	actually, it uses factual science to disprove popular scientific theory.<br>  <br>  Kind of like:<br>  <br>  One of the Laws of Thermodynamics states that matter cannot be created nor destroyed; only rearranged.  <br>  <br>  By teaching this, (which is scientific fact) it leaves the student to assume/conclude that something had to have created all we see, touch and hear.<br>  <br>  It's isn't teaching a Bible lesson or Christianity or morality.<br>  <br>  It basically uses certain areas of science, physics and mathematics to prove how certain scientific theories couldn't possibly be true.<br>  <br>  Pick up a book called "More Than Meets the Eye" by Dr. Swenson MD.  It goes through all the complexity of the human body and breaks down certain aspects of evolution using other science.  Very interesting...but kind of strange when he goes into the "new physics".<br>  <br>  It's just another point of view regarding how we got here using other scientific facts and not relying so much on the theories.  So to answer your questions, YES, because it's still using factual science.<br>  <br>  It's another theory; and science doesn't limit itself to factual facts, as it is stuffed with different scientific theories.  What do you have to fear, from learning someone else's point of view and gaining more knowledge, whether or not you believe it?  I LOVE learning all I can about science and evolution, even though I don't believe in all aspects of it.<br>  <br>  Again, it isn't giving a Bible lesson and you don't even have to mention God or creation at all.  Just stick to the evidence that contradicts popular theory, and let the facts speak for themselves.  Most people are afraid of creationism being taught, because they are afraid of what they don't understand and don't want it to turn into a church service.  If they really knew what creationism was teaching, they would have no problem with it.<br>  <br>  Please, please, please, pick up that book and read it!  Although the author is Christian and specifically mentions God as the creator, you can look aside that to the evidence he uses to back up what he believes.  All the evidence is purely fact; so it is neither 'secular' or 'religious'.|`|81SiImlSaa	So I ask what is scientific about creationism?  Nothing whatsoever<br>  <br>  Does it follow empirical evidence? Uh...NO<br>  <br>  Does it follow the scientific method? Uh....NO<br>  <br>  Is it open to falsification upon new information?

I educate myself; with these theories.<br>  <br>  Forced delusion only occurs when things like religion is force upon a person from child birth. When people are told to never question their beliefs. And are beaten up whenever they disagree with them or do not comply with a belief system that just never adds up to anything. <br>  <br>  The thing about Atheists is we do not force people to accept the facts; we just raise awareness of the facts and theories and if people want to refuse to accept them; we simply live and let live. We don't use violent aggression to force it upon people. <br>  <br>  Isn't there something in your bible about not judging people? I think its odd that religious people never practice what the preach; kind of ironic lol|`|qnd4UbNYaa	probibly because religion creates people like you who think everyone should beleive what you beleive. you need to understand that you can't change someones mindset or state of mind unless they themselves want to change their views or opinions on something. and most people aren't actually atheists. they just think they are grouped with them. most people who think they are atheists are actually agnostic. i am agnostic. meaning that i don't beleive in any religion because none of it seems reasonable. atheists and agnostics don't force themselves to beleive in nothing any more than you force yourself to beleive in whatever you beleive in. and anyone that would think of attending and/or starting an atheist support group is a complete and total idiot and no better than you.<br>  <br>  and yes i did just call you an idiot|`|uFQNnuQkaa	Why can't those with religious tendencies keep their beliefs to themselves or their "intimate" circles?  We (atheists) don't delude ourselves, we just find other reasons to live. The religious use God to justify their reason for being here just like I use the ER and the important role I play in society as my reason for being here, what's the difference?<br>  I still go out and help as many people as I possibly can. I don't care whether you're religious or not. I've always operated within a strict moral and ethical code.  I'd rather place my faith in myself, the people I work with and the people I meet everyday than some spiritual or mystical belief.|`|ZxrWOyNVaa	your question is slightly offensive<br>  no there is no support group or 'special classes' we simply refuse to follow a religion because people tell us to or because we do not believe it, you have no evidence for the existence of god, it was just something made up by people years and years ago because they did not know how to explain their lives. give me 5 VALID reasons why i should become a theist and i will convert.<br>  <br>  p.s i know there is evidence that jesus exists, i do not believe he performed miracles.|`|dDprsKZYaa	How do theists force themselves into a daily delusion that God exists?<br>  <br>  Do they wake up in the morning and prepare there minds to believe the overwhelming farce that Jesus is real and that he loves them! Forced delusion can take a toll, so do they go to special classes or is there an theist support group to help perpetuate the delusion that Yahweh exists?<br>  <br>  That was fun. Thanks for the laugh!|`|YGHCkVwPaa	Chances are, they ask the same question about people like you. It's all about perception, and atheists believe there is no God just as strongly as you believe there is a God.<br>  <br>  Feel free to believe what you want, but just because YOU believe it, that doesn't make it fundamentally true.|`|T5BshhZWaa	easy we cannot see him<br>  now my question is how can you tell that when something good happens in your life it was god<br>  every body in my family is christian and respect them nobody told me or convince me i figure it out my self<br>   now my question to you are you a christian because you figure it out yourself|`|AA10387471	because once something is your belief your mind secludes all thought from it. for example like when young children go through rough experiences their mind conciously blocks out those thought to purposly forget those memories. so they block out all thoughts of god. and believe he is not real.|`|UOIcXs7Haa	Do you have to wake up every morning and tell yourself what you believe is true?<br>  I doubt it and if you do that's pretty sad, i don't put that much thought into it, i have better things to think about.|`|7c0eb610d871f4900af356753fbd90b4aa	and you wake each morning to prepare yourself into not believing in Shiva and Thor and Krishna and Mohammed and the other thousands of Gods out there ?<br>  <br>  I am not an atheist but this is silly|`|leCcd0rfaa	No. I don't. I wake up in the morning and think of what I'm going to have for breakfast.<br>  I like to have leftover dinner for breakfast, or waffles. Waffles can happen at any time.|`|wNEpfTEnaa	I see no overwhelming truth! Agree with the first answerer - and perhaps some people are just more naturally prone to religion as a way of explaining all those unknown questions. Some can see beyond this.|`|HwjYCfLJaa	Common sense, bud. Show me evidence, hard evidence, that god is real.|`|RuOTJLyvaa	Atheists live perfectly happy normal lives without a god and none of them are punished for it. There is no delusion it's the other way around.|`|bVHnNqzBaa	Can you please explain what overwhelming truth you have? Please understand that some atheists have a higher standard of evidence than you.|`|5tz405Iaaa	No we are the people that live in a world where free thinking is encouraged.. evidence is looked at rather than ignored and also have common sense rather then believe that a ominous force will come and save me...|`|z4Yeofq8aa	Lack of evidence for God makes disbelief the logical default.|`|kDz9gcMuaa	I'm a athiest I don't think about religion. I don't try not to believe in God I just don't believe in him.|`|j49IqTdiaa	they just dont think about it they dont have a religion at all....|`|9RsQ0blWaa	Some people just haven't accepted enough blessings to understand.  We have to keep praying for them|`|diChry3Vaa	It's quite easy actually.  I don't have any trouble.|`|r8qJecrMaa	wanker!|`|zYnArpdIaa	I don't know how they do that but I'm sure they miss a lot in their live...|`|AA10081135	Yes, we read science books every day.|`|WRk223m7aa	This is not hard really. <br>  <br>  It is written in the day of judgment that many will look to get into heaven with Jesus and he will say no. They will be confuse and say didn't I heal in your name, teach in your name and pray in your name. His response will be I never knew you.<br>  <br>  As a Christian who has studied the word of god for myself in faith and spent much of my life in prayer it has ended in this conclusion. Jesus came 2000 years ago because mankind had become immoral due to satan deceiving eve in the garden which started this spiral of making it difficult to Connect with God in our souls<br>  <br>   The original  existance god created for us was much easier for us to connect with God because he physcially walked with adam and eve in the garden. The scipture also show how he walked with mankind outside the garden as well.<br>  <br>  Mankind in general has been tricked into   creating a  learning system for the mind that is based upon the devil's rules of existance. <br>  <br>  How much of our living today  is devoted to learning god, how much time is spent in the homes of children learning about god, how many parents raise thier children  learning the morals of god .  Many can't because it has not been taught to them for many generations.<br>  <br>  Take a critical look at many physcial church organizations today. You  attend  on sundays and maybe a bible study for a couple hours each week.  Even take a deeper look at this,  168 hours in a week and we are tricked  into giving maybe 1  hour to God in this period. If any time at all.  This time will be more for those of faith, but you get my point.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The pastors, preachers and televangelist are not teaching the morality of god for your soul or how to save your soul. They teach about how to get money and materail possessions. They teach the letter of the Law of God to condemn us. Because they dont understand the rules of the spirit behind the rules of god's morality.<br>  <br>  Many churches today talk all around god, about god and not how to connect your soul to god. <br>  <br>  They teach to tith so the church can build a larger physical structure that is so opelant for this physcial world. Yet christ taught dont get caught up in the best food, best clothing and the best quality of things the earth has to offer.<br>  <br>  He lived by this principle. Did Christ come driving a bently, bmw or benz of his day.  Did he ride the the chariot or come to  the fesitivals  riding a stallion. No he came riding a donkey and walking.<br>  <br>  You have to consider the devil had tricked a 3rd of the angels in heaven who could see God physically to reject him. How much more diffiicult is for mankind to just believe in our minds and souls with just the scriptures with Satan blinding the minds with his learning system in place.<br>  <br>  Ponder if those who attend church have difficulty finding the lord. How much harder is it for those who don't attend church or read the bible.<br>  <br>  Trust me my friend,  It aint easy.<br>  <br>   Yet it is easy. Just accept christ in your soul and he will do the rest.<br>  <br>  Also I have learned salvation reaches a man, women or child at a appointed day or time and no one but god will know this time.<br>  <br>  I hope this is a beginning of your understanding

xxEhpytpaa	Although we were not there, I believe the Transfiguration was how Jesus really looks to the people in heaven, His spirit. Something that we will only witness when we get to heaven. For we human could not fathom the beauty and the Apostles that were with Him at the time was granted a beautiful glimpse of what was to come beyond the veil. <br>  As for how does a man become a chosen one of Christ, Priesthood. It is I think an urgency from God, A feeling deep in your heart that pulls you to Him like a magnet. Some people try to ignore it and never listen and then others feel it so deeply they no matter what, they need to be one of the brothers in Christ in the holy priesthood. You'll know it if God is calling you. For nothing satisfies this quench but God.<br>  Yes definitely it is the communion with Christ in the Eucharist that keeps our soul in line with our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

Every single prayer - including the prayer of Jesus, which is the Lord's Prayer, which I happen to pray every single morning in my secret place - will bounce right off the ceiling if there's unforgiveness in your heart. That is precisely why Jesus ended His public sermon on prayer by saying "If you forgive men when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you, but if you don't forgive men their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins."<br>  <br>  Here's another point. Get into the Bible and get the Bible into you. God's will is revealed in His Word. The only way you can know His will is to know His Word. The more we meditate upon God's Word the clearer His voice will be as daily we commune with Him in prayer. <br>  <br>  I've mentioned this before but it bears repeating: discover your secret place. The secret to prayer is secret prayer. Your public presence is a direct reflection of your private prayer life. If you spend time in the secret place you will exude peace in the midst of life's storms. If you do not you're going to be a poster child for busianity rather than for Christianity. <br>  <br>  One more point: make prayer a priority. Wisdom is the application of knowledge. Jesus said "Therefore, everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice (or applies them) is like a wise man who built his house on the rock." My experience in teaching memory for over two decades now demonstrates that if you faithfully practice a new discipline for 21 days it may well stay with you for the rest of your life. So make prayer a priority. Don't let the business of life crowd it out. Start building a habit.|`|BaY0tdc6aa	A good way to pray is any kind of prayer that affects you positively & does not offend anyone else. A bad way to pray is any kind that affects you negatively and harms someone else. But, God doesn't care about the specifics. God is simply happy to hear from us.|`|XSEWADI0aa	How Should We Approach God?<br>  <br>   Jehovah does not lay down a lot of rigid rules on how to pray. Nevertheless, we need to learn the proper approach to God, which is explained in the Bible. For instance, Jesus taught his followers: “If you ask the Father for anything he will give it to you in my name.” (John 16:23) Hence, we are required to pray in Jesus’ name, recognizing Jesus as the sole channel through which God’s blessings are extended to all mankind.<br>  <br>  What bodily position should we assume when praying? In the Bible, no particular position is specified for our prayers to be heard. (1?Kings 8:22; Nehemiah 8:6; Mark 11:25; Luke 22:41) What is important is to pray to God in sincerity and with the right heart attitude.—Joel 2:12,?13.<br>  <br>   What about the use of the word “amen”? The Scriptures indicate that this is usually a suitable conclusion to our prayers, especially when we pray in public. (Psalm 72:19; 89:52) The Hebrew word ’a?men′ has the basic meaning of “surely.” McClintock and Strong’s Cyclopedia explains that the significance of saying “Amen” at the end of prayers is “to confirm the words which have preceded, and invoke the fulfilment of them.” Thus, by concluding with a sincere “Amen,” the one praying indicates his earnest feelings about what he has just said. When a Christian representing the congregation in prayer concludes with this expression, those listening may also add an “Amen” in their hearts or audibly to indicate their strong approval of what has just been said.—1?Corinthians 14:16.<br>  <br>   There are times when God may allow us to demonstrate the depth of our concern about matters for which we pray. We may need to become like Jacob of old, who wrestled all night with an angel in order to obtain a blessing. (Genesis 32:24-26) Or some circumstances may require that we become like Abraham, who repeatedly appealed to Jehovah in behalf of Lot and any other righteous people who might be in Sodom. (Genesis 18:22-33) We may similarly plead with Jehovah about things that are precious to us, appealing to him on the basis of his justice, loving-kindness, and mercy.<br>  <br>  What May We Ask For?<br>  <br>   Remember that Paul said: “In everything .?.?. let your petitions be made known to God.” (Philippians 4:6) Hence, personal prayers may touch virtually every facet of life. However, the first concern in our prayers should be Jehovah’s interests. Daniel set a fine example in this. When Israel suffered punishment because of their sins, Daniel implored Jehovah to show mercy, saying: “Do not delay, for your own sake, O?my God, for your own name.” (Daniel 9:15-19) Do our prayers likewise show that the sanctification of Jehovah’s name and the fulfillment of his will are our main concerns?<br>  <br>   Nevertheless, it is also appropriate to make requests concerning personal matters. For example, like the psalmist, we may pray for deeper spiritual comprehension. He prayed: “Make me understand, that I may observe your law and that I may keep it with the whole heart.” (Psalm 119:33, 34; Colossians 1:9,?10) Jesus “offered up supplications and also petitions to the One who was able to save him out of death.” (Hebrews 5:7) In so doing, he demonstrated the appropriateness of seeking strength when one faces danger or trials. When giving the model prayer to his disciples, Jesus included matters of personal concern, such as forgiving errors and obtaining daily food.<br>  <br>   In that model prayer, Jesus included the request: “Do not bring us into temptation, but deliver us from the wicked one.” (Matthew 6:9-13) He later counseled: “Keep on the watch and pray continually, that you may not enter into temptation.” (Matthew 26:41) Prayer is essential when we face temptations. We may be tempted to ignore Bible principles at work or at school. Non-Witnesses may invite us to join them in questionable activities. We may be asked to do something that violates upright principles. At such times, we do well to follow Jesus’ counsel to pray—both in advance and when actually facing a temptation—asking God to help us so that we do not fall.<br>  <br>  What if We Have Sinned?<br>  <br>   How can prayer help if someone has sinned? Because of shame, some who have sinned hold back from praying. That, however, is not a wise course to follow. To illustrate: Airplane pilots know that if they get lost, they can communicate with air traffic controllers to get help. What, though, if a lost pilot hesitates to contact the controllers because he is embarrassed that he got lost? That could lead to disaster! Similarly, the person who has sinned and is embarrassed to pray to God could suffer further harm. Shame over sin should not stop one from speaking with Jehovah. In fact, God invites those who have made serious errors to pray to him. The prophet Isaiah urged sinners in his day to call to Jehovah, “for he will forgive in a large way.” (Isaiah 55:6,?7) Of course, one may need to ‘soften the face of Jehovah’ by first softening one’s own heart, turning from the sinful course, and sincerely r|`|ATPPWOpWaa	Yes.

dec96041a9328ba9706ab620e51d3697aa	God is 100% irrelevant because Gods in Church and Temples have no strength even to protect their wealth. Thieves come and stole the Gods idol but God is not stopping it. God does not even come into the dream of the policemen and hints about the thief, why? God has no strength for that. A Mosquito or an Ant can have some sort of self protection, but God did not. Worshiping such a God is foolish. The Omnipresent God is different. It is Energy. It has no shape, no passion. All are using it. It presents our inside and outside. No need to Worship it. That is actual God. (Gods in Religions are creations of the greedy priests.

r4oOID5Daa	(Jeremiah 13:1) This is what Jehovah has said to me: “Go, and you must get for yourself a linen belt and put it upon your hips, but you must not bring it into any water.”<br>  <br>  At times our willing, quick obedience may be tested. Are we willing to take the time and expend the energy to do something that seems to be a relatively insignificant thing? Perhaps it is calling on scattered addresses of persons who were not home on previous calls. Or it may be making a return visit on those who merely took a magazine. It may be a matter of exerting ourselves regularly to hold a Bible study, or to call on persons needing help. Jeremiah might have complained at the long trip and the seeming insignificance of the matter when he was commanded to take a linen belt to the Euphrates River, a trip of about 300 miles one way, and to hide the belt in the cleft of a crag. Then, after some time he was directed to go back and get it. It was, of course, ruined. ‘Why all this for a mere belt?’ he might have asked. But, instead, he obeyed, and it provided strong testimony and a living picture of Jehovah’s long-suffering with Israel and Judah. It impressed the observers with Jehovah’s determination at last to bring to ruin his nation that he had worn about his hips like a belt for a praise and something beautiful to him, but which had become stubborn and idolatrous.—Jer. 13:1-11.|`|3d7f120f2bf9906d7333799542b3a295aa	My take is that the Lord is showing Jeremiah what will become of the people because they serve idols.  Like the belt, the are tucked away to rot and become useless tools for his purpose.  The belt holds things together so you can walk in the light of day.  But if you have a useless belt you fall apart in pieces and it serves no purpose

30jrFhXAaa	Muslim women are permitted to talk to strange men. It is perfectly okay for them to do so.<br>  <br>  What is not permitted (most practicing Muslims would agree with this, but not all of them) is dating and/or being in a relationship before or outside of marriage. The exception would be when a person, man or woman, is ready to get married. In that case, a man and woman can get together and go on slightly chaperoned dates (meaning they can't be completely alone) in order to get to know each other for marriage.<br>  <br>  Also remember, Islam is not a sexist religion (I believe no religion is sexist). What applies to women applies to men. So if you want to say that Muslim women cannot talk to stranger men, then you have to agree that Muslim men cannot talk to stranger women either. Obviously though, neither of those statements are correct.<br>  <br>  Hope that answers your question. :)|`|E9chZY74aa	Nobody likes talking to a Strange Man.|`|AA11058044	I'm not muslim, nor a woman, and I don't usually speak to strange men either.<br>  <br>  Maybe they're just snubbing you because you're strange.|`|bZo5Z53Uaa	I as a Muslim women do not speak to the men whom are not related to me.

WseLyvSpaa	No.  Society does not ONLY value physical appearance, otherwise there wouldn't be any ugly people.  It also values intelligence, wit, aggression, kindness, technical skills, etc. But it does value beauty. Your face is the first thing other people see. Don't be offended to be judged based on your outward physical appearance whether you are hot or a dog.  There is nothing even remotely surprising about that.<br>  <br>  Also, contrary to myth, beauty is largely NOT subjective.  People generally agree on who is pretty and who isn't. Especially at the extremes.|`|4a43ce24fc25ee210c17b8882b616386aa	Obsessions are never good, moderation and balanced lifestyle is always better and more healthy.

You know the obsession has gotten out of hand when looking like yourself earns scorn.|`|FOTQ2zEvaa	To answer your question I would say yes. External beauty is subjective to each person. What your immature boyfriend calls "ugly" might be gorgeous to another person. I think it's human nature to judge a person based of their appearance. But on the same ticket our society has gotten us to a point where we have become shallow, arrogant, and completely ignorant to the fact that people come in all shapes and sizes.  To be honest I think if all you and your boyfriend do is stand around judging others based strictly on how they look you are really losing out on getting to know the person for who they really are. Just for the record looks only last so long. Eventually things start to go South and sag. I try my damnedest not to judge others because I am not better than them and neither are you.

Some say it should be Yehovah, I personally think we have it right now, I believe that the true God has the ability to make sure we mortals say his name right. You can also find out Gods name at Psalms 83:18 in the original King James Bible. Every other translation has translated their Bibles from the King James, why have some changed Gods name from Jehovah to, LORD,GOD,or God?

It is the name of God. Jehovah.  His son has a name, why not him?|`|r4oOID5Daa	The Divine Name Through the Ages<br>  JEHOVAH God wants man to know and use his name. This is evident from the fact that He revealed His name to the very first two persons on earth. We know that Adam and Eve were familiar with God’s name because after Eve gave birth to Cain, according to the original Hebrew text, she said: “I have produced a man with the aid of Jehovah.”—Genesis 4:1.<br>  Later we read that faithful men like Enoch and Noah “walked with the true God.” (Genesis 5:24; 6:9) They also, then, must have known God’s name. The name survived the great Flood with the righteous man Noah and his family. In spite of the great rebellion some time later at Babel, true servants of God kept on using his name. It appears hundreds of times in the laws that God gave to Israel. In the book of Deuteronomy alone, it appears 551 times.<br>  In the days of the judges, the Israelites evidently did not shy away from using God’s name. They even used it in greeting one another. We read (in the original Hebrew) of Boaz greeting his harvesters: “Jehovah be with you.” They returned his greeting by saying: “Jehovah bless you.”—Ruth 2:4.<br>  Throughout the history of the Israelites right up until the time that they returned to Judah after their captivity in Babylon, Jehovah’s name continued in common usage. King David, a man agreeable to God’s own heart, used the divine name extensively—it appears hundreds of times in the psalms that he wrote. (Acts 13:22) God’s name was also incorporated in many Israelite personal names. Thus we read of Adonijah (“My Lord Is Jah”—“Jah” is a shortened form of Jehovah), Isaiah (“Salvation of Jehovah”), Jonathan (“Jehovah Has Given”), Micah (“Who is like Jah?”) and Joshua (“Jehovah Is Salvation”).<br>  Outside the Bible<br>  There is also evidence from sources outside the Bible of the extensive use of the divine name in ancient times. In 1961 an ancient burial cave was uncovered a short distance to the southwest of Jerusalem, according to a report in the Israel Exploration Journal (Volume 13, No.?2). On its walls were Hebrew inscriptions that appear to date from the second half of the eighth century B.C.E. The inscriptions contain statements such as “Jehovah is the God of the whole earth.”<br>  In 1966 a report was published in the Israel Exploration Journal (Volume 16, No. 1) about pottery fragments with Hebrew writing on them that were found in Arad, in southern Israel. These were written in the second half of the seventh century B.C.E. One of them was a private letter to a man named Eliashib. The letter begins: “To my lord Eliashib: May Jehovah ask for your peace.” And it ends: “He dwells in the house of Jehovah.”<br>  In 1975 and 1976, archaeologists working in the Negeb uncovered a collection of Hebrew and Phoenician inscriptions on plaster walls, large storage jars and stone vessels. The inscriptions included the Hebrew word for God, as well as God’s name, YHWH, in Hebrew letters. In Jerusalem itself, there was recently discovered a small, rolled-up strip of silver, apparently dating from before the Babylonian exile. Researchers say that when it was unrolled, the name of Jehovah in Hebrew was found to be written on it.—Biblical Archaeology Review, March/April 1983, page 18.<br>  Another example of the use of God’s name is found in the so-called Lachish Letters. These letters, written on potsherds, were found between the years 1935 and 1938 in the ruins of Lachish, a fortified city that figured prominently in Israel’s history. They appear to have been written by an officer at a Judean outpost to his superior, named Yaosh, at Lachish, apparently during the war between Israel and Babylon toward the end of the seventh century B.C.E.<br>  Of the eight legible shards, seven begin their message with a salutation such as: “May Jehovah cause my lord to see this season in good health!” Altogether, God’s name appears 11 times in the seven messages, clearly indicating that the name of Jehovah enjoyed everyday usage toward the end of the seventh century B.C.E.<br>  Even pagan rulers knew and used the divine name when referring to the God of the Israelites. Thus, on the Moabite Stone, King Mesha of Moab boasts of his military exploits against Israel and, among other things, states: “Chemosh said to me, ‘Go, take Nebo from Israel!’ So I went by night and fought against it from the break of dawn until noon, taking it and slaying all .?.?. And I took from there the [vessels] of Jehovah, dragging them before Chemosh.”<br>  In reference to these non-Biblical uses of the name of God, the Theologisches W?rterbuch zum Alten Testament (Theological Dictionary of the Old Testament), in Volume 3, column 538, says: “Thus some 19 documentary evidences of the Tetragrammaton in the form jhwh testify in this regard to the reliability of the M[asoretic] T[ext]; more can be expected, above all from the Arad-Archives.”—Translated from German.<br>  God’s Name Not Forgotten<br>  This familiarity with and use of God’s name continued right up to the days of Malachi, who lived ab|`|T4wryDDNaa	Here is a very thorough answer. Please read along with your bible. It is an excerpt from the book "What Does the Bible Really Teach". I can send one to you...an excellent bible aid that I so enjoyed and gained so much bible knowledge from! Email me at spreadingoodnews@yahoo.com.<br>  <br>  The Divine Name—Its Use and Its Meaning<br>  IN YOUR copy of the Bible, how is Psalm 83:18 translated? The New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures renders this verse: “That people may know that you, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth.” A number of other Bible translations give similar renderings. However, many translations leave out the name Jehovah, replacing it with such titles as “Lord” or “Eternal.” What belongs in this verse? A title or the name Jehovah?<br>  This verse speaks about a name. In the original Hebrew in which much of the Bible was written, a unique personal name appears here. It is spelled ???? (YHWH) in Hebrew letters. In English, the common rendering of that name is “Jehovah.” Does that name occur in only one Bible verse? No. It appears in the original text of the Hebrew Scriptures nearly 7,000 times!<br>  How important is God’s name? Consider the model prayer that Jesus Christ gave. It begins this way: “Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified.” (Matthew 6:9) Later, Jesus prayed to God: “Father, glorify your name.” In response, God spoke from heaven, saying: “I both glorified it and will glorify it again.” (John 12:28) Clearly, God’s name is of the utmost importance. Why, then, have some translators left this name out of their translations of the Bible and replaced it with titles?<br>  There seem to be two main reasons. First, many claim that the name should not be used because the original way to pronounce it is unknown today. Ancient Hebrew was written without vowels. Therefore, no one today can say for sure exactly how people of Bible times pronounced YHWH. However, should this prevent us from using God’s name? In Bible times, the name Jesus may have been pronounced Yeshua or possibly Yehoshua—no one can say for certain. Yet, people the world over today use different forms of the name Jesus, pronouncing it in the way that is common in their language. They do not hesitate to use the name just because they do not know its first-century pronunciation. Similarly, if you were to travel to a foreign land, you might well find that your own name sounds quite different in another tongue. Hence, uncertainty about the ancient pronunciation of God’s name is no reason for not using it.<br>  A second reason often given for omitting God’s name from the Bible involves a long-standing tradition of the Jews. Many of them hold that God’s name should never be pronounced. This belief is evidently based on a misapplication of a Bible law that states: “You must not take up the name of Jehovah your God in a worthless way, for Jehovah will not leave the one unpunished who takes up his name in a worthless way.”—Exodus 20:7.<br>  This law forbids the misuse of God’s name. But does it forbid the respectful use of his name? Not at all. The writers of the Hebrew Bible (the “Old Testament”) were all faithful men who lived by the Law that God gave to the ancient Israelites. Yet, they made frequent use of God’s name. For instance, they included it in many psalms that were sung out loud by crowds of worshipers. Jehovah God even instructed his worshipers to call upon his name, and faithful ones obeyed. (Joel 2:32; Acts 2:21) Hence, Christians today do not hesitate to use God’s name respectfully, as Jesus surely did.—John 17:26.<br>  In replacing God’s name with titles, Bible translators make a serious mistake. They make God seem remote and impersonal, whereas the Bible urges humans to cultivate “intimacy with Jehovah.” (Psalm 25:14) Think of an intimate friend of yours. How close would you really be if you never learned your friend’s name? Similarly, when people are kept in ignorance about God’s name, Jehovah, how can they become truly close to God? Furthermore, when people do not use God’s name, they also lack knowledge of its wonderful meaning. What does the divine name mean?<br>  God himself explained the meaning of his name to his faithful servant Moses. When Moses asked about God’s name, Jehovah replied: “I shall prove to be what I shall prove to be.” (Exodus 3:14) Rotherham’s translation renders those words: “I Will Become whatsoever I please.” So Jehovah can become whatever is needed in order to fulfill his purposes.<br>  Suppose that you could become whatever you wanted to become. What would you do for your friends? If one of them became seriously ill, you could become a skilled doctor and perform a cure. If another suffered a financial loss, you could become a wealthy benefactor and come to his rescue. The truth is, though, that you are limited in what you can become. All of us are. As you study the Bible, you will be amazed to see how Jehovah becomes whatever is needed in order to fulfill his promises.

The swastika is mainly a symbol for peace for humans.

As with any spell, when faith and emotion are placed behind it, it gains power, this is how it actually worked when applied to Nazi Germany.<br>  <br>  Hitler wanted the perfect race and nation to master the world.  He got his wish.  First is destruction, tearing down of old ways of thinking, acting, nations, traditions, cultures and peoples.  Then creation, new nations, allies, technology, ways of thinking, beliefs and goals.  The two combine (the second cycle of destruction) and combat each other, both get ripped apart.  The final wind breathes final creation, and the new and the old combine to be set in stone.  <br>  <br>  Hitler wanted the perfect race and perfect nation to dominate the world.  The only nation made up of many nations, the only race made of many races, came out on top.  Magic doesn't always work as we want it to, but it worked.<br>  <br>  I will say again, (and history will agree with me) this is magic meant to be wielded by the gods alone, some things, man is not meant to play with.<br>  <br>  Dance to the rhythm of Fire|`|NxL4C1DMaa	You seem to be confused.

A million or more.  With only one Bible, one Christ, one God and one Gospel--that seems like a problem to me.  <br>  <br>  Second, I feel like one of the main purposes of the Book of Mormon is to stand as a proof of the divine calling of the prophet Joseph Smith--the person who claimed to translate the record.  If it's true--the Joseph Smith is a prophet and everything else naturally falls into line.<br>  <br>  Going to your sub questions.<br>  <br>  2.  We believe that there are prophesies in the Bible that refer to the Book of Mormon.  Examples include a sealed book in Isaiah, the stick of Judah (Bible) and the stick of Ephraim (Book of Mormon) coming together mentioned in Ezek.37 and Christ's mention of other sheep of a different fold.<br>  <br>  3.  Good enough?  See my previous comment about all the different churches in the world that understand the same passages to mean radically different things.<br>  <br>  4.  God can do anything.  Of course He could.  But He called Smith for the same reason He called Moses and the other prophets--whatever reason that may be.  God works through prophets.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  In reference to the Stick of Ephraim--we believe that the people who wrote the Book of Mormon were members of the house of Israel--Ephraimites to be exact.  With the Book of Mormon coming forth--the gathering of the lost tribes is already happening.|`|AQBow7Glaa	The Mormons were part of the millenialist movement that also inspired the 7th day adventist and other Millerite sects that arose in the Finger Lakes district of upstate New York at about the same time.<br>  <br>  In a nutshell, some 18th-19th century protestants started to interpret Rev 20 as describing the New Earth of the Millenium as happening--not after a Rapture, which nobody had yet thought of--but rather as a paradise on Earth.  Because America was the "New World," a lot of Christians decided that this was the location where the Kingdom of God on Earth would happen.<br>  <br>  Joseph Smith had been exposed to the fanciful history of the Freemasons during his time in that club, in which the writers of the history trace their English ancestry back via the druids to the original builders of Solomon's temple (it's hokey, but yes that's what they said).  So creating another testament in a similar fashion allowed Smith to claim authority for his newly-created millenialist religion by setting the historical stage for America as the Kingdom of God on Earth.<br>  <br>  Hasn't really worked out, but there it is.|`|jdRKZe18aa	We need a second witness of CHrist because clearly, the Bible has been interpreted and translated so many times so as to lose far too many plain & precious truths within its pages.  MEN have twisted and skewed the Word of God so deeply that to find the TRUTH pure & simple is no longer possible.  Also, from the beginning of time ALL Of GOd's children have kept sacred records.  These records <Arc of the Covenant> from the children of Israel down to ancient followers in Jerusalem who kept these same records in high regard and were of great value & significance to the priests and temple workers who held these sacred writings in their keep.  THIS is not a novel idea.<br>  <br>  SO does it not seem equally reasonable and CLEAR that if God had "other sheep" who were "not of the fold" in Jerusalem but who knew God, knew of a coming Messiah and had Faith in Him... that they TOO WOULD write & keep sacred records also of their own people and sacred and religious history?  Seems totally reasonable and probable to any thinking person.   SO the Book of Mormon is simply that! - it is another witness of Christ from a people who also knew of Christ and looked forward to His birth, life, resurrection and appearance to them as well - like He appeared to His Sheep in Jerusalem.  "Other Sheep I have which are not of this fold and they too will hear my voice and there will be ONE fold and ONE Shepherd".... this is biblical - these are CHrist's words.  WE BELIEVE that the other sheep He spoke of were indeed the ancient prophets and people of the Book of Mormon.  <br>  <br>  You should give it a chance - it is a beautiful accompanying scripture that expounds on biblical truths and clarifies many cloudy unanswered questions found in the bible alone....

Christ truly did fulfill the law of the prophets.  That's why we're no longer offering animal sacrifices.  <br>  <br>  Where in the Bible does it prophecy that other books that are found within the Bible will come forth?  Does the Torah prophecy of the book of Joshua, Judges, or Ruth?  Does the Old Testament prophecy of the gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John?  The Bible itself can't meet the standard that you're asking the Book of Mormon to meet.  <br>  <br>  Christ did actually speak of "other sheep" that would HEAR his voice (not hear of his words, or read his words).  We know that some of these people were in the Americas.  Additionally we know there were others still, but we don't yet know who they were. <br>  <br>  The Bible is true.  However, you don't have to look far to see that no two groups of Christians can agree on how it is to be interpreted.  Look at the massive dissent within Christianity and you'll quickly realize that the Bible alone fails to remove all conflicting opinions.  A good portion of the New Testament is written about different groups who weren't quite sure how to correctly worship or practice Christianity.  They were repeatedly corrected by living apostles of Jesus Christ.  <br>  <br>  Why did the Jews need "another testament" when they already had the Old Testament?<br>  <br>  Matthew wrote his testament, Mark, Luke, and John are really quite redundant, why is it that we "needed these other testaments"???<br>  <br>  The truth is that Moses taught truth to his people without the luxury of most of the Old or New Testaments.  Those things aren't actually necessary, however, there is a lot that can be learned from them.  Can't the people of Moses' day be saved without the New Testament?  Does that mean that the New Testament and everything but the Torah is "unnecessary"?  Clearly Christ can save any of his children.  However, we are blessed to have additional words and teachings that we can learn from.  <br>  <br>  As a Christian, if there were other true prophets and apostles of Jesus Christ who wrote down their stories and teachings, wouldn't you want to read them to gain spiritually from their words?  If we had access to more of Christ's words, wouldn't you be overjoyed to be able to read them?<br>  <br>  If the Book of Luke hadn't been canonized, but was just recently discovered and authenticated, wouldn't it be fabulous to learn of Christ's birth and early years that way?<br>  <br>  The truth is that if the Book of Mormon is indeed true scripture, it's the most exciting thing that's happened in Christianity since the Bible was canonized and translated.  <br>  <br>  So, as a true Christian, isn't it worth finding out, from God through prayer, if it's true or not?  It is true.....but don't take my word for it.  Find out from God.|`|ApyKiltXaa	John 20: 30<br>    30 ? And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book: <br>  <br>  John 21: 25<br>    25 And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen. <br>  <br>  Looks like there were more works and writings of Jesus that what we currently are exposed to in the New Testament.<br>  <br>  As for asking Jews what the stick of Judah is....you realize that they didn't recognize Christ as the Messiah when he came.  How would they know what their own teachings meant.  Sure they have history, but if they missed the Messiah when he came....do you think they may have missed the mark somewhere down the road.  Have the Jewish teachings been changed to their original understanding?  If so, how did it happen?|`|sDNTMAkmaa	Because even the Bible says that by the mouth of 2 or 3 witnesses shall all things be fulfilled.<br>  <br>  2 Corinthians 13:1<br>  <br>  1 This is the third time I am coming to you.

Hundreds of Thousands?<br>  There are so many different conflicting views held by different Christian groups that it is completely ridicules.<br>  For an example of what I am talking about I will share with you an experience I had while I was serving a mission for my Church.<br>  I will not name the what denomination this was because I do not wish to speak ill of another faith. But to clarify all three of these people were part of the same Christian denomination they went to different congregations and they all lived with in a three block radius of each other. <br>  The first person claimed that they believed what we were saying and that they believed that, from our testimonies,  the Book of Mormon is the word of God, but then informed us that they could not take it because they were taught that only a religious leader should read out of scripture. <br>  The second person was also more than happy to hear about the Book of Mormon and informed us that their religious leader held weekly Bible studies with them.<br>  The last person, shocked me and my companion so badly that we didn't get far enough to offer them a copy of the Book of Mormon. They told us that they believed that Christ did NOT live a perfect life it was his mother Mary that lived the perfect life, and that through her guidance Christ eventually attained perfection, and was thus able to preform the atonement for us.<br>  <br>  If you wish to see further examples of the need for an additional testament of Jesus Christ, then look no further than the news. You have some Christian denominations openly supporting the homosexual movement and others condemning it. You have some Homosexual ministers in various faiths and others going so far as to (wrongfully so in my opinion) attack those who choose to live their life as a homosexual. <br>  You have some Christian denominations who claim that baptism is necessary and others that say it is not. <br>  There is so much confusion and contention within the Christian world. There is confusion and contention in every area of Christianity and that cannot possibly come from God, because He would not be the author of such confusion. <br>  That is why we need the Book of Mormon. It stands with the Bible as a testimony of Christ. It helps to firmly establish Christ's teachings. When the two are read and studied together it removes all possibility of confusion and contention over doctrine.|`|AA10637643	2 Nephi 29<br>  <br>    6 Thou fool, that shall say: A Bible, we have got a Bible, and we need no more Bible.

Why reject MORE of Christ's words... I just don't get it.|`|dc00e6f724cc094e75dc0475843d0e44aa	Did not Christ preach this?<br>  <br>  Matthew 18:16<br>  But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.<br>   <br>  2 Corinthians 13:1<br>  This is the third time I am coming to you.

I will star your question so that others who can cite the scriptures better than me can answer.  <br>  <br>  But my personal take on it is this, there really is only one gospel, one baptism, one Christ.  Anyone familiar with the history of the Church (Catholic) must see that there has been a great deal changed since the time of Christ and each denomination since has made more changes.  I think the Lord saw this and established therefore made himself known the the Nephites/Laminites who keep the records that have since become the Book of Mormon. <br>  <br>  You should get some good answers from Josh and the others on this group.<br>  <br>  Best Regards!|`|xyIZv6iiaa	The first testament of Christ is the Old Testament in the Bible, which prophesied of the coming of the Savior, His transcendent life, and His  Atonement. <br>  <br>  The second testament of Christ is the New Testament, which records His birth, His life, His ministry, His gospel, His Church, His Atonement, His Resurrection, and the testimonies and experiences of His Apostles. <br>  <br>  The third testament of Christ, the Book of Mormon --- also foretells Christ’s coming, confirms the Bible’s account of His saving Atonement, and reveals the resurrected Lord’s visit to the earth’s other hemisphere. <br>  <br>  Each of these three testaments is a part of the great and indivisible whole of the Lord’s revealed word to His children. They contain the words of Christ. Those who think that one part is more important or more true than the other parts are missing some of the beauty and completeness of scripture. <br>  <br>  The LDS believe that all scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable (2 Timothy 3:16). We love the Bible and the Book of Mormon. We believe both to be the revealed word of God. Scripture is a pillar of our faith, and a powerful witness.  Question to you though - why do you place so much bearing on the Jewish interpretation and believe in Jesus?<br>  <br>  you have some very good answers here - if you are willing to consider them. <br>  <br>  Kudos to tjsg's answer, and the others.

Just because you document it does not mean they have to call the mom and daughter in there for mediation. Do not tell anyone what you are doing. Email me if you want. And yes, they are both scum!!! Do not speak to anyone at work becuase the one you talk to about this may be their friend or second cousin. If they apologize pretend to accept it while thinking, 'ok scumbag'

It is simply a way to express your thankfulness.  <br>  <br>  It is interesting to know that the fish's first known use as a Christian religious symbol was sometime within the first 300 years after Christ's resurrection.  but it wasn't until sometime around the 16th century Christians began using the Greek word ichthys for "fish". Ichthys is the most commonly used word in the New Testament for fish. <br>  <br>  Ichthys consists of five letters from the Greek alphabet: I-ch-th-y-s. When these five letters are used as initials for five words, we obtain this Christian Declaration:<br>  <br>   "Iesous Christos Theou Yios Soter". <br>  <br>  This is an acrostic for 'Jesus Christ, God's Son, Savior.'|`|S4XUl7qWaa	Your ichthus should be pointing face toward the amphibian which is eating it.|`|EcqG1Yanaa	Yes, if you point it down it will look like the original Pagan symbol.|`|xelkbdbdaa	The second commandment forbids them.|`|WX1b747Iaa	The evolved legs should be turned towards the ground, since evolution is living and ongoing.|`|GeoiGjbCaa	It doesn't matter as long as they're upright and on their feet.

The first thing that happens is that two angels, Munkir and Nakir enter the grave and put the soul back into the dead body.

What is your Qiblah?<br>  <br>  Then the person is questioned about his obligatory Prayers, and Pilgrimage that he had to perform, his fasting during the month of Ramadhan, and his love for Ahlulbait (Family of Prophet Muhammad).<br>  <br>  If the person answers correctly the angels ask him to sleep peacefully and the door of paradise is opened into his grave and he sees his place in paradise. His soul is taken from his body to a place in Wadi us Salaam (Valley of Peace.).<br>  <br>  If a person is not a believer, he will not be able to give the expected answers and thus the doors of hell will be opened to him in his grave and his soul will be transferred to Wadi al baroot to receive the Punishment.<br>  <br>  Squeeze in the Grave<br>  <br>  It is also said that if a person is questioned in the grave, he is also subjected to the squeeze of the grave. This Squeeze is for a person who has committed lots of sins and has not seek any forgiveness for it. It is painful in that, all his body is squeezed like a piece of cloth is squeezed to remove water from it.

He (peace be upon him) mentioned that “sleep is the brother of death.” This is an excellent way of looking at what we will experience in our graves. Sleep may be restful and peaceful or it may be frightening and tormenting as in a nightmare. The grave we reside in after death will be similar. It is understood among the scholars that the grave will either be a pleasant experience or it may be a frightening one, depending on our beliefs and deeds in this life.<br>  <br>  From Abu Hurayrah, who said: "The Messenger of Allah (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: ‘When the deceased is buried (or he said: when one of you is buried), there come to him two blue-black angels, one of whom is called Munkar and the other Nakeer. They ask him, ‘What did you used to say about this man?’ and he says what he used to say: ‘He is the slave and Messenger of Allah: I bear witness that there is no god except Allah and that Muhammad is the slave and Messenger of Allah. They say, ‘We knew beforehand that you used to say this.’ Then his grave will be widened for him to a size of seventy cubits by seventy cubits and it will be illuminated for him. Then they tell him, ‘Sleep.’ He says, ‘Go back to my family and tell them.’ They tell him, ‘Sleep like a bridegroom whom no-one will wake up except his most beloved,’ until Allah raises him up. If (the deceased) was a hypocrite, he says, ‘I heard the people saying something so I said something similar; I do not know.’ They say: ‘We knew beforehand that you used to say this.’ The earth will be told to squeeze him, so he will be crushed until his ribs are interlocked, and he will remain like that until Allah raises him up.’" (reported by al-Tirmidhi, no. 1071. <br>  <br>  There are minor rewards in the grave in that, for the believer, it will be spacious and well lit. Our deeds in this life will appear to us in the form of a kind companion who will keep us company until the Day of Judgment. We will be shown our place in Paradise, in sha’ Allah, through an opening in the side of the grave. For those who were not believers or led a sinful life, their deeds will appear to them in the form of an ugly and mean companion who beats and torments them until the Day of Judgment. The grave will be dark and constricting, and the punishments will be minor compared to what is waiting for them in the Hellfire, their place in which will be shown to them through an opening in their grave.<br>  <br>  The real rewards and punishments will be reserved for Hellfire and Paradise. The Day of Judgment is a fixed point in time in the future, the exact date of which is known only to Allah. Those who have gone to their graves before us are presently waiting in their graves for that Day. The grave is really a resting place, either comfortable or not, until that time. We can seek Allah’s help by following the Prophet’s example. He informed his followers that they can make du`aa’ (supplications) just before finishing their prayers with the words that mean the following:<br>  <br>  “O Allah, I seek refuge in You from the punishment of the Hellfire, and from the torment of the grave, and from the trials of life and death and from the trials of the Dajjal (False Messiah).”|`|mOWyzwubaa	Glorious Quran Does Not support this interrogation session in graves.<br>  these are imported beliefs not authorized by Glorious Quran

So therefore you have atheistic Satanists.<br>  <br>  It's certainly easier than the way of traditional or theistic Satanists like myself who know that LaVey was wrong.

I've seen that statement being thrown around, and it's getting on my nerves.  According to Abrahamic Mythology Satan was an Angel who challenged God and led a Angelic Civil War.  Satan lost and was thrown into Hell (past the River Styx, not Hell, Michigan) to live, but since God had to forgive him, he allowed Satan to take care of all of the sinners.<br>    So since an atheist does not believe in angels, Gods and such, I cannot see how the two are intertwined, except through ignorance.  <br>    That whole term does not make much sense to me.|`|26414b2f3237391dde0fd3b0221fcffcaa	Satanism is just the anti-thesis to Christianity, but it's not a-theist.

So they the miracles come and go without so much as a blink.

True it really happened and we didn't even get a scratch on our car. We were so shaken we pulled over and looked at each other and said together, "We should have been hit just then." We really couldn't figure out just what happened to the car that was coming at us. This didn't just happen once, it has happened on three different occasions and it was similar.

urIm4YaBaa	Radio Frequency ID chips are out, and have been around for years. You know the security units at stores that make a loud beeping noise if you try to walk out without paying for something? Those utilize that technology. <br>  <br>  Do we implant them in humans under any circumstance? No.<br>  <br>  Could there be a future use in implanting them? In theory, yes, but there are currently technological hurdles to overcome for their use to be consistent. I wouldn't be surprised if most of us live to see the day when this changes and they can be accepted on a voluntary basis (such as to carry around medical records).<br>  <br>  Are there any official plans to implant them in people forcibly? Conspiracy theoriests (and some millenial dispensationalists) love to claim that this is in the near future, but there's no evidence that anybody's even working toward this goal.<br>  <br>  People have claimed the Revelations is being carried out for years. The mark of the beast was once assumed to be when the U.S. began issuing social security numbers. The UN was considered the "world government." In reality, you can always find parallels between any two things if you're looking for them. <br>  <br>  There would be cause to be concerned if RFID chips are ever forced on people. However, it's quite a stretch to say that Revelations predicted this exact technology.|`|wuPTBIIuaa	Rfid chips are out NOW. <br>  <br>  they just are not linked to our genetic code and dna yet. 300 people and pets and animals are being tagged Unconstitutionallly right now.|`|rcPnnfmmaa	An RFID chip is a compact radio transmitter; it stands for radio frequency identification device. If you buy a book at Books A-Million and try to walk out the door without paying you'll be stopped by a pair of mysterious flashing devices to either side.<br>  <br>  If you examine each book closely you'll find a very thin flexible "sticker" with arcane-looking patterns inscribed on it in metal foil.<br>  <br>  The idea is simple. The sticker has no battery of it's own, but when you pass it close to the pylons by the door it can pick up a tiny bit of power. When it has power it emits a looped radio signal, usually just a number. The pylons know that book number 577798 has been paid for, but perhaps book 577799 and hasn't and if they sense you're trying to carry out a book that hasn't been added to the paid list then the alarm goes off.<br>  <br>  After you leave the store the stickers can't broadcast again because they're too far from their pylons. They also have difficulties with foil-lined shopping bags or if you accidentally remove the RFID tag with a pocket knife. I've also seen people who can hack the pylons...<br>  <br>  The belief that the government either has already or will in the very near future implant you with a RFID chip so they can track your movements is very common in the paranoid community.

xyIZv6iiaa	When first built, Mormon temples are opened to the general public in an open house for a time. After this, the temple is dedicated by LDS general authorities and reopened only to worthy members. <br>  <br>  A member is considered worthy if they hold a recommend. The recommend is an identification card, which is renewed annually by the individual's bishop. Qualifying criteria include full payment of tithes, regular attendance to ward meetings, wearing temple garments under regular clothing, and an agreement to obey the Word of Wisdom.<br>  <br>  A careful reading of the scriptures reveals that the Lord did not tell all things to all people. There were sometimes qualifications set as prerequisite to receiving sacred information --- Temple ceremonies fall within this category.<br>  <br>  One must be a member 'in good standing' - meaning that there are requirements to be met.  Not everyone who is a member of the LDS church goes to the temple.<br>  <br>  Boyd K Packer said - We do not discuss the temple ordinances outside the temples. It was never intended that knowledge of these temple ceremonies would be limited to a select few who would be obliged to ensure that others never learn of them. It is quite the opposite, in fact. With great effort we urge every soul to qualify and prepare for the temple experience. Those who have been to the temple have been taught an ideal: Someday every living soul and every soul who has ever lived shall have the opportunity to hear the gospel and to accept or reject what the temple offers. If this opportunity is rejected, the rejection must be on the part of the individual himself.|`|97f3e02ea0c61fb5033e4520729f2781aa	Temple attendance is different from regular worship services.  LDS attend church every Sunday at a chapel - visitors are always welcome to attend and see anything they'd like.<br>  We believe the temple to be the House of God.  It is dedicated and conscecrated unto the Lord.  It is a place of quiet refuge from the world.  The 'card' or recommend is received by interviewing with the proper priesthood authorities [generally a member of the bishopric and stake presidency] and answering a few questions like, does one believe Joseph Smith was a prophet? does one beleive in Jesus Christ? does one feel worthy to attend the temple?<br>  The privilege of attending the temple has throughout all history been a privilege and not open to the masses.<br>  There is nothing startling about what occurs in the Temple - in fact, everything which happens there is found in the scriptures and is generally discussed in Sunday School and Sacrament meeting on a regular basis.<br>  If you'd like to attend services, they are at local ward or stake meeting houses and all are welcome.  If you'd like to see the interior of a temple - there are several open houses this year [one currently in Draper, UT and another beginning in May in Oquirrh near south SLC, UT] and at that time [prior to the dedication] we open the temples and invite all who are interested to come see these beautiful houses of the Lord and learn more about LDS Temples.  There have been some 4-6 open houses every year around the globe.

Second you have to be in good standing within the church. Your Bishop will interview you and make that determination. Then you are given a Temple Recommend. It is signed by you , your bishop and your stake president. The point of the recommend is to keep the temple as pure and clean, in every sense of the word. We believe that the Temple is God's House. And we believe that His house should be kept sacred and Holy. As far as I know there have always been recommends needed to enter the temple.|`|1e86a17cf7d3d6bd5f1d1eb0376ee828aa	You first talk to your Bishop and get an interview with him and the you talk with your Stake President and get an interview with him. If you are found worthy then you will be issued a temple recommend.|`|AA10637643	It's a sacred and worthiness issue.<br>  <br>  What you refer to is called a Temple Recommend.  One must be living certain standards - like no drinking alcohol or coffee, paying their tithing, being chaste or completely faithful to their spouse, attending church meetings, etc - in order to obtain the recommend.  The person must also be a member of the Church and have an interview with the Bishop and Stake President, before they are issued the recommend.  They expire every 2 years.<br>  <br>  The wonderful thing is - anyone can attend who abides by the standards the Lord has set.<br>  <br>  It's not a secret or millions of people wouldn't know about it.  The temples are very sacred, and are dedicated as houses of the Lord.  When there is a new temple built, there are several weeks before it is dedicated where anyone who wishes, member of the church or not, may go through it on a tour and see what it looks like inside.  They will also explain the purpose of temples.<br>  <br>  The purpose of the card is to show we are living the standards, and to gain access to the temple.  I don't know when it started.  <br>  <br>  <br>  I love the temple!|`|rx20pKgOaa	LDS "services" are held in our Chapels and everyone is invited to attend. Our Sunday services are not secret and that is the best way to get an understanding of what we teach and believe in the LDS faith.<br>  <br>  "Services" in your understanding of the term are not conducted in our Temples.  In the Temple we perform ordinances and make covenants and while we regard them as sacred that information is, unfortunately, all over the internet.  <br>  <br>  A member in good standing is issued a "Temple Recommend" and that is the card you are referring to that allows one access to the Temple. <br>  <br>  The Temple is considered a sacred and holy place - the purpose of the recommend is to ensure that those attending are right with themselves and the Lord so that the Spirit of the Lord is not offended. <br>  <br>  I hope that helps explain.  Best Regards.|`|yTAXDL5Jaa	milk before the meat<br>  youtube has the inside of temples on there before they were dedicated by the way.|`|rFxLHqQFaa	I'm pretty sure it has something to do with OSHA.<br>  <br>  I got a card in a crackerjack box once but was a pre paid calling card.|`|6DmsiLGbaa	After a temple has been constructed and before it's been dedicated to God, there is always an open house in which anyone can enter and take a tour through the buildings.  I don't know where you live, but I believe there are at least two under construction in Utah and another in Arizona, and you can always attend when they're finished.  Here's a link to the temples being built at the moment:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ldschurchtemples.com/construction/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ldschurchtemples.com/construc...</a><br>  <br>  Once a temple has been dedicated, however, only worthy members of a certain age are allowed inside.  Temples are our most sacred places, and though of course we would never want to exclude anyone, the temples are meant, at least in part, to be a refuge from the world.  They're peaceful, beautiful places where people can redirect their thoughts and spirits to God and feel His love for us, which is precisely why they're not open to the public.  If we allowed just anyone in, after all, the temples would become nothing more than tourist attractions, and the spirit of God could not be present.  Even members who are not living the standards of the church or are not keeping the promises they have made with God are not permitted to enter, because their hearts would not be in the right place.  Though I can understand why some might be offended, the purpose of this really isn't to keep others out but to protect the sanctity of the temple.  <br>  <br>  As for letting people see what they're getting into first...well, that's why we have the lessons with the missionaries.  Before anyone can join our church, they must first meet with the missionaries and learn our basic doctrines.  One of the lessons is based pretty much entirely on temple work and the purposes of the temple, so really, any individual who joins our church already has a working knowledge of what they're for.  And member or not, that information is offered to everyone through either the missionaries or through the church's website (mormon.org, if you're curious).  When it's that easy to learn about the temples, I hardly think they'd qualify as either a secret or a dangling carrot for non-members.  <br>  <br>  The cards--recommends--are only given to those worthy members after they've been interviewed by the bishop (our version of a pastor or minister).  The bishop will only ask if the member is living according to God's commandments and keeping the promises the member made with God at baptism.  So, no, a non-member can't simply ask for a "card."  It doesn't work that way, because again, we're trying to protect the spirit of God that can be felt inside.  It's not really a safety issue at all, but it's been like that from the start.  <br>  <br>  Again, if you have more questions, you should take a few minutes to check out the church website.  I'm sure you can find answers to most of your questions there.|`|8jhACvtlaa	It's a sacred issue.  not even all Mormons are allowed in the Temple.  <br>  <br>  A "card" or "temple recommend" is obtained only after an interview with local church leadership, where they ask a few questions about your worthiness.<br>  <br>  Usually, a year after baptism into the church, a member can get a temple recommend and enter the temple.  They have to wait a year, because in the temple we make sacred covenants with God--and should be taken pretty seriously because of that.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Yes, one of the questions to get a temple recommend is "Are you an honest Tithe payer?"  Tithing is an incredible blessing in our lives, and we believe it to be a commandment from God as well.|`|NARak4iBaa	You don't understand what temples are. <br>  <br>  First there are LDS (Mormon) chapels all over that you can attend on Sunday.  This where we hold our sunday meetings (Sunday School) and so forth.  You can come and view the services as often as you want. <br>  <br>  A temple on the other hand is a place we make other covenants (Like Baptism).  <br>  So the temple is a worship service.  Now to attend the temple you do need to be a member, you do need to show you are following the teachings of the church and so forth (this is the same for everybody). <br>  <br>  Once somebody is ready and willing to make the additional covenants then they are allowed into the temple.  <br>  <br>  Its not about trying to find out all that goes on before you join.  Its about trying to teach and learn on the level people are at.  <br>  <br>  But go a head and attend on sunday you can find the closes church here<br>  <a href="http://maps.lds.org/" rel="nofollow">http://maps.lds.org/</a>|`|lZuM2pxgaa	Thanks for an honest question. To go to a Sunday service, just show up. There is nothing secret about it. See the video on mormonsmadesimple. No need to convert.<br>  <br>  Temples are different. As stated, they are open to the public when built, but then only worthy members may go. Worthiness isn't only tithes, which I'm happy to pay, but not drinking, premarital relations, prayer etc.<br>  <br>  Whatever you do, beware Mormon hating websites. The videos/cartoons on the internet were made by a rabid anti-Mormon. He was excommunicated for adultery and abuse/neglect of his children. His videos were condemned by Anti-Defamtion League, Nat'l Council of Christians and Jews, etc. Even famous anti-Mormons Jerald and Sandra Tanner, who appeared in the films, ended up condemning them and the producer.<br>  <br>  (Ask some of these ex-Mormons if they were excommunicated? I think only a small percentage actually had doctrinal concerns.) <br>  <br>  This user, history.illuminates, is obviously not an actual historian. The show he recommends is fiction based on breakaway sects. Its producer, Lawrence O'Donnell, literally lost his mind on TV during an anti-Mormon rant. He later said Mormons are easy to target because "Mormons are the nicest people in the world. They’re not going to ever take a shot at me."<br>  <br>  Technically, you don't need to wait a year to go to temple. If you join the Church, you can go much sooner on a limited temple recommend.

AA11297267	Actually, Islam *isn't* afraid of a woman's sexuality...it's the men it's concerned about.  Apparently Muslim men (who are the only ones that matter, women are just property in Islam) have no self control of any kind.<br>  <br>  The *reasons* given for the all-body and face covering for women is that an uncovered woman is a temptation to a man -- so to avoid tempting men, women must cover up.  The implication is that if there's a woman around showing her body, the men won't be able to control themselves and they *must* rape her.  So to avoid men committing rape, women must cover themselves.<br>  <br>  It's the men they're worried about, dear -- women don't count in Islam.<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|HUDSwT3baa	There not, they just dont want YOU, to see it.|`|VG2X9Ihkaa	To be able to understand, you will need to dig a bit deeper then this.<br>  <br>  The time Quran came to people of Mecca and Madina, women had no rights at all.

You must remember that at the time Islam was established, women were being raped all over the place, objectified, hurt and oppressed. Islam gave women a better life then. By covering up, women weren't as seductive. They were more respected and even though rape didn't end, it was reduced. As for the obeying of husbands, this was instilled to create family harmony then. Men are also told to respect their wives' opinions. You're just ignoring the parts where men are told to cover up anything between the navels and the knees and the parts that give women their own rights too.<br>  There is a whole Quranic chapter dedicated to women. Read that.

It was decided, that Gentile converts did not have to conform to the Laws of Judaism insofar as Ceremonial Law and the Observance of Feast Days. They did not have to become circumcised or observe other customs, even though they were technically converting to Judaism.<br>  Within the first century Gentile converts outnumbered Jewish converts, and the main division between standard (orthodox) Judaism and the new Sect (labeled "Christianity" from Christ, christos, the GK translation of the Heb. word Messiah which means "Anointed One") began to appear, as "Christianity" was becoming more Hellenized as it spread throughout the Roman Empire.<br>  By the time Rome adopted Christianity as it's State Religion in the 3rd Century AD it was already much different from Judaism since it was comprised of mostly Gentile (and pagan) converts with only a small percentage retaining their Jewish heritage and observing Feast Days and Ceremonial Laws.<br>  <br>  In any case, from that time on "Christianity" as a religion evolved so to speak and it became the dominant religion of the Roman Empire (hence the RCC) and it continued to evolve throughout the succeeding centuries becoming more and more a "new" religion that neglected it's Jewish roots save in text (Scripture) only. <br>  <br>  With the Dividing of the Church (after the Reformation) Catholicism became an entirely separate branch than Protestantism. <br>  BUT, Catholicism WAS Christianity from about the 2nd Century AD until 1400-1500's AD. <br>  <br>  The Church has undergone MANY reforms, and there are plenty of valid and invalid sects and cults springing from "Christianity." But Catholicism, in its early stages WAS Christianity. And Technically, still is because the CC professes all of the essential doctrines of Christianity, with only a few minor changes in doctrine (such as the veneration of Mary and the Saints, adding Purgatory to the Eternal States, and placing a higher value on works etc) which Protestants do not follow.<br>  <br>  Technically, All Catholics are Christians, but not all Christians are Catholics. ALSO to note, though Christianity has its roots in Judaism, and is considered "Abrahamic" it is NOT Judaism by any sense of the word, any more than Islam is Christianity. And though the Early Church (Disciples and converts) consisted of devout Jews who observed Ceremonial Laws and Feast Days, Christianity (technically) ceased to be Judaism (or a Sect thereof) after Rome adopted it as its State Religion in the 3rd Century AD.<br>  <br>  In any case, I hope this helps.<br>  xoxo ?|`|1aa8b20a9151f0263c0e250dfc8c3448aa	In the beginning there was the Roman Catholic Church...<br>  <br>  After sometime, there was a schism and the Eastern Orthodox Church broke off...<br>  <br>  Then, Martin Luther broke away and the Protestant movement began...<br>  <br>  After more time, various Protestant groups divided out and now there is a whole plethora of various Christian denominations...<br>  <br>  But, it all began with the Catholics...<br>  <br>  Of course, they [Catholics] originally came from the Jewish tradition...that is where Abraham comes in...he was of the Jewish faith...the Old Testament basically comes from the Jewish religion...<br>  <br>  Islam is also related, but I'm not so clear on how...|`|AA11796124	ABRAHAM<br>  Born in the twentieth or nineteenth century B.C., in Ur of the Chaldeans on the Euphrates River. His father, Terah, named him Abram. The family migrated to Haran, where Terah died (Genesis 11:26-31). At God's behest, Abram, his wife, Sarah, his nephew, Lot, and all their followers moved on to Canaan (Genesis 12:4). When Abram was ninety-nine years old, God made a covenant with him, changing his name to Abraham and promising to make him the "father of a multitude of nations . . . [Genesis 17:1-5] I will make you into nations and your issue shall be kings . . . I will give to you and your descendants the land you are living in, the whole land of Canaan, to own in perpetuity, and I will be your God" (Genesis 17:5-8). Hence he has been called the founder of the HEBREW PEOPLE. Abraham's dedication to the will of God was tested when he was told to take his son, Isaac, to the land of Moriah (which later became the site of the Jerusalem temple) and sacrifice his son as a burnt offering. He obeyed without hesitation, but Isaac was spared at the last moment (Genesis 22). In his final days Abraham arranged to have his son marry Rebekah, one of his kinfolk (Genesis 24), and left Isaac all his possessions before he died at the age of one hundred seventy-five (Genesis 25). <br>  <br>  Specific Examples of Subordinate Mediation in the Old Testament:<br>  <br>  Gen. 20:17 - God responds to Abraham's intercession and heals Abimelech, and also his wife and slaves. <br>  <br>  Gen. 27:29; Num. 24:9 - blessed be everyone who blesses you. If we bless others in prayer, we are also blessed. <br>  <br>  Exodus 32:11-14, 30-34; 34:9; Num. 14:17-20; 21:7-9 - these are many examples of God's response to Moses' saintly intercession. <br>  <br>  1 Sam. 12:23 - Samuel says that he would be sinning against God if he didn't continue to intercede for the people of Israel. <br>  <br>  1 Sam. 28:7-20 – the deceased prophet Samuel appears and converses with Saul, which is confirmed by Sirach 46:13,20). <br>  <br>  1 Sam. 28:7; 1 Chron. 10:13-14 - Saul practiced necromancy. He used a medium, not God, to seek the dead and was therefore condemned. Saul's practice is entirely at odds with the Catholic understanding of saintly mediation, where God is the source and channel of all communication, and who permits His children to participate in this power. <br>  <br>  2 Chron. 30:27 - the prayers of the priests and Levites came before God's holy habitation in heaven and were answered. <br>  <br>  Tobit 12:12,15 - angels place Tobit and Sarah's prayers before the Holy One. This teaches us that the angels are also our subordinate mediators. We pray to the angels to take up our prayers to God. <br>  <br>  Job 42:7-9 - Job prayed for three friends in sin and God listened to Job as a result of these prayers. <br>  <br>  Psalm 34:7 – the angel of the Lord delivers those who fear him. <br>  <br>  Psalm 91:11 – God will give His angels charge of you, to guard you in all your ways. <br>  <br>  Psalm 103:20-21; 148:1-2 – we praise the angels and ask for their assistance in doing God’s will. <br>  <br>  Psalm 141:2 - David asks that his prayer be counted as incense before God. The prayers of the saints have powerful effects. <br>  <br>  Isaiah 6:6-7 - an angel touches Isaiah's lips and declares that his sin is forgiven. The angel is a subordinate mediator of God who effects the forgiveness of sins on God’s behalf. <br>  <br>  Jer. 7:16 - God acknowledges the people's ability to intercede, but refuses to answer due to the hardness of heart. <br>  <br>  Jer. 15:1 – the Lord acknowledges the intercessory power of Moses and Samuel. <br>  <br>  Jer. 37:3 - king Zedekiah sends messengers to ask Jeremiah to intercede for the people, that he might pray to God for them. <br>  <br>  Jer. 42:1-6 - all the people of Israel went before Jeremiah asking for his intercession, that he would pray to the Lord for them. <br>  <br>  Baruch 3:4 - Baruch asks the Lord to hear the prayers of the dead of Israel. They can intercede on behalf of the people of God. <br>  <br>  Dan. 9:20-23 - Daniel intercedes on behalf of the people of Israel confessing both his sins and the sins of the people before God. <br>  <br>  Zech. 1:12-13 - an angel intercedes for those in Judea and God responds favorably. <br>  <br>  2 Macc. 15:12-16 – the high priest Onias and the prophet Jeremiah were deceased for centuries, and yet interact with the living Judas Maccabeas and pray for the holy people on earth.|`|AA11440601	+ Christians +<br>  <br>  Most non-Catholic Christian denominations accept Catholics as Christians.

We are still one Body.<br>  <br>  Catholics share the belief in the Communion of Saints with many other Christians, including the Eastern Orthodox, Anglican, Episcopal, and Methodist Churches.<br>  <br>  The Communion of Saints is the belief where all saints are intimately related in the Body of Christ, a family.

But no mention in any Egyptian literature links the name Isis to the name Mary. Isis was also not a virgin. No account of Horus’ birth makes this statement. Isis was not a virgin, but the widow of Osiris, another Egyptian god who conceived Horus with Isis. Finally, Horus was supposedly born during the month of Khoiak (Oct/Nov), and not on December 25th, a fact which does not help their claim of marrying the stories of Horus to Jesus anyway because the Bible never assigns a birth date to Christ.<br>  <br>  Next, the film states that a star in the East announced his birth and that three kings came to bring gifts to the “savior.” However, when stories detailing the birth of Horus are examined, there is no star or three kings who come to visit him. Trying to link this to Christianity fails in any event as the account of Christ’s birth in Matthew has magi (wise men, not kings) coming to Jesus with their actual number not being stated. Clearly, the movie is using the traditions of December 25 and three wise men, not the Bible, to link Jesus and Horus. <br>  <br>  There are no descriptions of Horus being a savior to anyone or serving in that capacity.<br>  <br>  This is seen again in the statements made of Horus being “baptized” and starting a “ministry.” The only accounts remotely related to Horus and water are the stories told of Osiris (his father who is sometimes combined in ancient accounts with Horus to form one individual) whose body was cut up into 14 pieces by his enemy, Set, and scattered throughout the earth. Isis supposedly found each part of the body and after having Osiris float in the Nile, he came back to life or became the lord of the underworld, depending on which account is read. In any event, stating that Horus was “baptized” is simply playing fast and loose with Christian terminology and is another obvious attempt to link mythology and the Bible.<br>  <br>  In addition, Horus had no “ministry.” Horus becoming a teacher at age 12 (mimicking Jesus’ account at the temple as a youth) is nowhere to be found in accounts of Horus; neither are there any statements to the effect that he had 12 “disciples.” According to the Horus accounts, Horus had four semi-gods that were followers and some indications of 16 human followers and an unknown number of blacksmiths that went into battle with him. No accounts of Horus being betrayed are found in his portrayals and he certainly did not die by crucifixion in any account. There is an incident described in one story of Horus being torn to pieces, with Iris requesting that the crocodile god pull him out of the water he was placed into, but the movie does not mention this as it does not fit in with their agenda. Further, history has the account of Horus as originating in 3,000 B.C., which predates the invention and practice of crucifixion, so there is another historical problem that must be overcome.<br>  <br>  The claims of Horus being buried for three days and resurrected are not to be found in any ancient Egyptian texts either. Some accounts have Osiris being brought back to life by Isis and going to be the lord of the underworld. But there is no mention of a burial for three days and no mention of his physically coming out of a grave in the same physical body he went in with and never dying again. And there is certainly no account of Horus dying for others as Jesus did.<br>  <br>  In the end, the attempt to prove Horus was a picture/forerunner of Jesus simply fails from lack of any historical evidence. It runs in the sames vein with all the other mythological pagan deities that pre-dated Jesus (Attis, Krishna, etc.) As just another simple example, the Zeitgeist movie says that Hindu’s Krishna was also crucified and resurrected. However, Hindu teachings clearly state that Krishna was killed by an arrow shot from a hunter who accidentally hit him in his heel and after he died, he ascended to be with Brahman. None of the pagan deities, when accurately examined, mirror the Son of God recorded in the New Testament gospels.<br>  <br>  Of course, you also have to consider and answer to the following facts:<br>  ? The many archaeological details confirming New Testament accounts.<br>  ? The historically confirmed references to the details of the life of Christ.<br>  ? The early dating of the Gospel accounts during the lifetime of the eyewitnesses.<br>  ? The deep moral convictions of the authors and their commitment to truth.<br>  ? The accounts of the apostles going to their deaths for what they believed.<br>  ? The typology of Joseph and Jesus (used by the film to supposedly debunk the actual existence of Christ) is very well known and accepted by conservative Christian scholars as a foreshadowing of the first coming of Jesus.<br>  ? All the good produced by Christianity (see How Christianity Changed the World by Dr. Alvin Schmidt), which are brushed aside with only the crusades and other like events being highlighted.<br>  <br>  So i'm sorry your pre-supposition is completely fallacious
ZkBLNj6Vaa	You went mental, simple.  It could be that you are really delusional about this metaphysical stuff.  That's the nature of a delusion: it looks real no matter how many people say it isn't.  When that happens, lean on evidence to validate your beliefs before just taking the plunge into uniqueness.<br>  <br>  Maybe your mind broke.  Some people getting into the unknown, like metaphysics and psychic things, they aren't fully aware or prepared for any problems, and so they have accidents on this journey into the psychic wilderness.

BzrUWCsDaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  I'm a Jehovah's Witness & you know we're known for preaching from door to door (among other places).<br>  From my experience, I've had some great talks with atheists & agnostics who genuinely have questions they want answering concerning my beliefs. This also happens with believers but its not the same, as many who profess to already know the scriptures will not actually examine the scriptures with me, whereas more non-believers will. Many believers already think they know what the bible says & don't feel the need to examine their beliefs to see if they are in line with the bible or what the bible actually says. It's a case of "don't show me I already know" even though its been handed down to them by word of mouth, they haven't examined their holy book themselves.<br>  Personally, I think it's important to examine these things if you are going to devote your life to a belief.<br>  This is just my experience though|`|UinOWcMUaa	Well, it's one thing to deny God because many don't like following rules,,, but it's another thing to flat out deny that our world has a creator. When, you look at the world and all of it's majestic and intriguing aspects you will clearly see and Intelligent Designer AKA as God :)|`|99399280e2e93e47c5b56b48ad0d3730aa	Everyone has and need a God.

I choose to try to live my life as good as i can. I fail sometimes and have to ask for forgiveness sometime too. I'm only human but my bible is my map that I use to live my life each day to the best of my ability I choose to believe what it says. it helps me to just deal with life on lifes terms|`|Buw4VWnRaa	Believers immediatelly know what is wrong with your post and your thinking. You mistakenly assume that since X has a different god than Y, that they  both thing there might be more than one God. I assure that is absurd. <br>  <br>  There is the belief in GOD, which virtually all Westerners with a belief share..but then there is the revelation from that God, which varies, even legitimately. <br>  <br>  Get someone from a major religion to explain this to you.<br>  <br>  I can say X is my father, and you say Y Is my father, but we both know I ONLY HAVE ONE FATHER :)|`|XSEWADI0aa	(Deuteronomy 5:7) You must never have any other gods against my face.<br>  <br>  <br>  This expression has reference to the fact that Jehovah does not tolerate any rivalry, the worship of any other gods.|`|O84V4pYIaa	If someone doesn't believe in any god, or they believe in a different god... it makes no difference to me.

e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	The creation stories in Genesis are allegories.  The Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil is a trope.  It is a way to talk about the loss of our innocence and gaining experience of the world.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	YOURE SO RIGHT CUZ THEY WERE BETTER OFF IN PARADISE.....IGNORANCE IS BLISS....REMEMBER BEING SMALL BEFORE ANYONE HIT YOU AND MADE YOU CRY??|`|i6d582PFaa	there is no original sin, that would imply the origin of all things is tainted. Sin is whenever man suffers under his own delusions and is not aware of it. If a man accepts his imposed upon fate, it can not be a sin. <br>  <br>  Sin is anything that goes against enlightenment, but for certain circumstances an enlightened man can engage in worldly activity, knowing full well he is tainting his mind with impurities, but can handle it because of his wisdom and virtue.|`|4d5247fbc8be95ded60ba90440fe55ecaa	Actually, that is a completely inaccurate interpretation of that passage. God didn't want to keep people in ignorance. All the "apple" story tells us is that there are consequences to our actions, and that with knowledge comes great responsibility. We learn the following truths:<br>  <br>  1. Ignorance (coupled with innocence) is often bliss. If you don't know what you are doing, then you are not responsible for your actions. It is the same logic our own courts use in determining competency in criminal cases, amongst other things.<br>  <br>  2. There are consequences to your actions. Listening to shady characters rather than respected authority figures gets you in trouble. Regardless of who you consider a "respected authority figure," this is ultimately just common sense. <br>  <br>  3. Life is hard. There are no easy answers to everyday questions, and "paradise" only exists for people who can accept this. The Adam and Eve story further serves as an ancient parable to explain basic facts of life. <br>  <br>  4. Knowing all the "facts" of life does not make life easier. It does not make us more moral people. It does not make us more kind and gentle and understanding. Educated people are still people: often ugly, nasty, brutish. That said, if you don't cherry-pick the Bible and take it all in context, you see that the Bible does NOT attack education and knowledge on the whole. It just suggests that there is more to life than knowing the difference between quantum physics and mechanical engineering. These are valuable things, but they won't help you save your marriage or decide how to help a friend in need. <br>  <br>  5. Listen to God. He's got your best interests in mind. <br>  <br>  Frankly, with the exception of the last one, I think these are lessons that even an atheist should be able to appreciate on some level.|`|3d7f120f2bf9906d7333799542b3a295aa	Man is meant to live by faith in God's revelations,not by knowledge.  Other beings that were given knowledge fell and have no chance to recover, but man's life is by faith, living by the Light that shines on our path.  With this you have the greatest thing in the universe on your side and can never fail.|`|nHizaTiDaa	It is very mysterious to me, that is for sure, I do not pretend to have all the answers.<br>  <br>  But the knowledge was NOT just "knowledge" or learning it was "the knowledge of good and evil".<br>  <br>  Animals can commit horrendous acts of violence, but they are not evil, are they? They are merely being animals.  And even the worst animal doesn't torture, tease, torment other creatures and laugh and laugh over it.<br>  <br>  You know, like other kids making so much fun of other kids they want to kill themselves? The cliques at work even, among adults.. the petty sarcastic things we say to one another, the cuts, the put-downs, it goes on and on- not only the henious things.<br>  <br>  The kids who light animals on fire and think it so funny!  You can think of endless horrid things we do to each other.. the men who enslave girls to prostitute for them! They don't care a whit about the girls or anyone- just so long as they get money and power...<br>  <br>  This is what is wrong with mankind.  We KNOW full well when we are cruel- but we excuse it all away. NO one gave ME a break!  I don't f***ng care!   That person is an idiot, etc etc...<br>  <br>  WE KNOW.|`|9f3fef8c85fa161e18f4848f36e97fb8aa	Every religion has struggled with the fact that knowledge of the world takes one out of a state of unity and oneness (heaven) and brings one into a realm where good is contrasted with evil, light with dark, love with hate (knowledge of the world).  So original sin comes with the territory in the material world.|`|VPeb2fuTaa	Well, think about it.  Adam and Eve already knew about a perfect world--because they lived in one.  So what new knowledge would they attain by eating the fruit?  Is it really worth it to suddenly understand all of the horrible things people can do to each other, all at once, simply for the sake of being less ignorant?  I mean, wouldn't all that horrible realization at once be psychologically scarring?<br>  <br>  Basically, it's the same as Pandora's Box.  Adam and Eve were so curious about what knowledge was being hidden from them, that they gave up their immortality and unleashed evils on the world, just to satisfy their curiosity.  Sometimes ignorance is bliss.|`|1LTrZbxwaa	What you are saying is NOT exactly right.<br>  <br>  It wasn't the "Tree of Knowledge", it was the "Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil".<br>  <br>  God gave Adam the knowledge of the universe, but it was only of good, therefore everything he did was good.<br>  <br>  The "Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil", had the knowledge of good as well as evil and it brought decay and corruption in equal parts. Having eaten of that tree brought evil into man's consciousness along with the good.<br>  <br>  God did not want to keep man ignorant, but merely ignorant of evil because of the bad it would bring.<br>  <br>  Now the "Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil" had to be there because the universe is made up of polar opposites as well as part of man's consciousness is having free will, therefore that choice to choose between the polar opposites had to be presented.|`|AA11227341	no that was the devil's lie to convince the innocent, for it was not about eating or gaining knowledge but of obedience and as you are aware man failed.  If you recall, God told Adam and Eve they could eat of any other tree (so there was no need to eat of the Tree of Knowledge right) they fell into temptation  --"surely you will not die but will be like God" which is what the devil wanted right?  Adam and Eve were innocent---they were naked and it did not bother them because there was no malice (no sinful motive) in them so when God asked them where are you (God knew where) they were hidden for they were shamed by their nakedness--they never saw it before so they never knew that it was wrong; they felt unease about it so God took action and killed the first animal--the first sacrifice and clothed them.  Has they not sinned by rebelling against God---they refused to obey Him, we too would be walking around naked for it would not be an issue that causes us to sin in our minds.|`|mVsWyu0yaa	Myths do not have to make sense! lol <br>  <br>  The entire Genesis Myth is so frought with idiocy that it is mind-boggling that any grown, sensible, individual would EVER take it literally. <br>  <br>  Imagine an allegedly OMNISCIENT god who KNOWS at the moment of creation that his creatures were flawed and would fall into the TRAP he set for them-----and then punishes them (and by default) the rest of humanity FOREVER....for doing EXACTLY what he Knew they would do!!!!!  That is not a SANE god...that is an arbritrary, capricious charlatan. <br>  <br>  The false doctrine of "Original Sin" posited by Augustine, resulted in the dogmatization of lunacy....everything from <br>  Free Will to the Virgin Birth,  the Immaculate Conception, and a 'sinless' sacrificial Savior that was one slice of a tri-partite divine pie and was resurrected with a human body that would have been absolutely as useless in the celestial Disneyland as teats on a bull.|`|ATPPWOpWaa	It was the Tree of knowledge but the "Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil".<br>  <br>  There is a difference.|`|KgCUpE5naa	We're all ignorant anyway.|`|4mSpN3Rxaa	He wanted us to be close to Him.|`|83zdE9rTaa	Paul specifically told Timothy to beware of "knowledge".<br>  <br>  1 Tim: 6: 20 and 21 O Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you, avoiding worldly and empty chatter and the opposing arguments of what is falsely called "knowledge".<br>  <br>  This verse from Paul kind of confirms your statement, eh?|`|JVUsliRGaa	No,<br>  you cannot answer this because this did not happen, this story is nothing more than a fanciful story that was created thousands of years ago by  a few guys who tried to rationalize and explain to the less technologically advanced society they lived in on how humans originated.<br>  <br>  This question cannot be answered legitimately using any evidence or empirical data, only by vague human rationalizations. This is nothing more than a fairy tale|`|NROUTGnzaa	The tree was not the tree of knowledge. Full name: "Tree of the knowledge of good and evil"<br>  He knew that if we did not know of evil, we could not sin. He did not want sin. Has nothing to do with intellectual knowledge.<br>  If we had no knowledge of evil, we would never be tempted to do evil. <br>  He desired us to be totally innocent because He knew what would happen if we committed sin. <br>  God said (paraphrase) "Do not eat of it, for the day you eat it, you will die."<br>  If a parent said to a child "Do not touch the hot stove or you'll get burned." You wouldn't say to that parent "You want your child to remain ignorant of pain? You are a bad parent!"<br>  <br>  Your argument against God is a straw man.|`|AA11719394	Please complete the sentence. It is the 'Tree of knowledge of Good and Evil" - Gen 2:9. <br>  <br>  You make it sound like God was withholding knowledge in general which is not true. It's misleading and twisting the Word of God. Which by the way is exactly what satan does!<br>  <br>  It yes it would have been far better for us not to have know evil and live in the perfection of God and His kingdom as He intended.|`|2X58PDrfaa	Because it is the knowledge of Good and Bad. This introduces LAW to man. But it says in the bible, that law is the strength of sin. So the more you know about what to and not to do, the more you will sin. <br>  <br>  for example, i say " Don't think of a purple dinosaur."<br>  <br>  No, i said, " Do NOT think about a purple dinosaur!" <br>  <br>  But i bet you are thinking of Barney aren't you? <br>  <br>  See my point?<br>  <br>  And God gave men free will. If all was good, what is there to choose from? there is no right or wrong to choose from.|`|H8hTvsOXaa	Because he wanted us to be able to learn and grow if we knew everything life would be boring nothing to discover or learn would you really want that He has given us the chance to learn from challenges|`|FOzN3xwzaa	Ignorant of evil, yes. <br>  <br>  Why do you need to be heavily indoctrinated in evil?|`|RuOTJLyvaa	The more knowledge we gain the less we need god|`|6vS2kmPaaa	the tree of knowledge both good and evil <==explains it all|`|0EDaFf1Haa	Cute little ant farm ... don't trouble me.

Genesis 1 records that God made all of them! Imagine the power in just one star! But it is not just about raw power. There is intelligence and design packed in our universe down to the smallest DNA strand, down to the smallest subatomic particle. God’s power and wisdom are beyond our comprehension. That is why the LORD said to Abraham in Genesis 18:14, “Is anything too hard for the LORD?” That is why the LORD said to Moses when Moses questioned how God could possibly supply meat to several million Israelites in the wilderness, “Is the Lord’s arm too short?” (Numbers 11:23). That is why Jonathan told his armor bearer that the LORD didn’t need a lot of soldiers to get a victory (1 Samuel 14:6).<br>  <br>  Jeremiah 32:17 states, “Ah Lord GOD! behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm, and there is nothing too hard for thee.” Even in the spiritual realm, those that seem the farthest from salvation are not impossible for Him to reach (Mark 10:25-27). And as great as His power is, His love and mercy are just as great...even to the point of His willingness to send His own Son to die on the cross of Calvary to pay the penalty for a sinful mankind. He did this so that He, in complete justice, could forgive those who will turn away from self-reliance and sin to reliance upon Christ and His finished work. As parents, it would be far worse to see our children endure torment than go through it ourselves, and yet that is just what God the Father did. John 3:16, a familiar verse, states God’s great love: “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” This love was not just for the “good” people (there are none), but for us...a fallen, sinful, unlovely, rebellious people (Romans 3:10-23)...and yet He chose to shower us with His love (Romans 5:6-10) when we didn’t deserve it.<br>  <br>  The only thing that God cannot do is act contrary to His own character and nature. For example, Titus 1:2 states that He cannot lie. Because He is holy (Isaiah 6:3; 1 Peter 1:16), He cannot sin. Because He is just, He cannot merely overlook sin. Because Christ paid the penalty for sin, He is now able to forgive those who will turn to Christ (Isaiah 53:1-12; Romans 3:26).<br>  <br>  Truly our God is an awesome God...unchanging, eternal, unlimited in power, in majesty, in knowledge, in wisdom, in love, in mercy, and in holiness. But we are very much like the Israelites who, even after seeing God display His power and love repeatedly, doubted both His love and power as they came face to face with each new trial in their lives (e.g., Numbers 13-14). May God help us to honor Him with dependence and trust in Him through the next “crisis” we face, for He is a “very present help in trouble” (Psalm 46:1)|`|gHSarVD1aa	GOD is the law of reality.<br>  There is two kinds of laws. There are static laws like that of gravity and there are standards created to govern actions.<br>  <br>  GOD is the first law. It is the nature of our creator that is a static law like gravity.<br>  <br>  We can do all sorts of tricks and games to try an alter that reality, but in the end, truth is truth. Our math is flawed. Our measurement of time is flawed. Our perception of GOD is really whacko.Science is mans way to study basic laws of the universe. If you would open any science manual you will find "revisions". Revisions are mistakes. <br>  GOD did not create these laws that we try so hard to understand. GOD's nature  is the law.|`|PoY7vcnQaa	There are no laws of reality, reality is a perception of the mind. I am only 15 and understand many things, but God is not one of them. I am nonreligious solely on the fact that God cannot be proven real by science. Science has been a universal, meaning that science has to be older than us humans, because then, gravity was creating out of nothing and that would, technically, be Spontaneous Generation and that has been proven wrong.|`|Buw4VWnRaa	GOD is the laws of reality. See St Thomas Aquinas, either in his own writings or in<br>  The Religious Philosophy of St Thomas Aquinas<br>  by Etienne Gilson|`|bWn8LNvJaa	This question is null since there is no such thing as "God".|`|zRQmWC5saa	we r not suppose to even think what all the wonders God can do. we leave it to him and thats it! if we knew " our heads would explode!|`|l6Jew1qAaa	Good question. Thought provoking. God made the rules and abides by them, by his own choice, not because He must. With God all things are possible. He doesn't change the so called laws of nature/physics, but he could, can, and sometimes does, to make a point. Just like Jesus turning water into wine...that goes against "laws" of nature/physics but it was done. God put the universe in motion, created the essence of everything...He could just as easily "uncreate" it, if he chose to do so.<br>  <br>  In our tiny little corner of the universe, our scientists have defined certain physical "laws" that can be measured objectively using tools that were painstakingly invented by imperfect humans over hundreds, even thousands of years (are we slow learners, or what). Does this mean that those same "laws" apply everywhere in the universe? Can anyone prove they do? Just because certain phenomena appear a particular way, or seem to follow a particular pattern of behavior, can we assume that human "laws of physics" are applicable throughout the entire universe? Einstein was brilliant, no doubt about it, and "laws" of physics that appear to work here on planet Earth in our little solar system on the outer edge of the Milky Way Galaxy, far from the center of the ever expanding universe are just as childlike and oversimplified to God as religion is to atheists. In our realm of existence, energy follows certain patterns of behavior and cannot be created or destroyed...but we are a tiny mote of existence in the larger picture. Who is to say what is possible or not possible, given the raw power of the universe and the unlimited power of God?<br>  <br>  You are right, the Human soul is just as eternal as God is...the real question then: what defines the soul? Is it just an energy form? Is it more...does it contain the "person" that we are, the ancestral memory of all that have gone before...or is it just mindless energy? Is this energy "recycled," as some religions believe, or is it gathered in a "holding" area as others believe, does it roam freely, or is there another alternative? I don't know. Of one thing I am certain, the soul is eternal, just as God is eternal. I for one do not want to take any chances on my eternal soul ending up somewhere I'd rather not be...

Mnm35sjNaa	Let's face it, our collective destiny (eventual extinction) might be a foregone conclusion, but we decide, by our choices, what we do with our lives. In the grand scheme of things, the universe will eventually expand, disperse and degrade into nothingness. Humanity won't change that a bit.<br>  <br>  As for the here and now . . .<br>  <br>  . . . There is evidence that thoughts arise from diverse modules within the brain. These diverse sources of thought, within the brain, are integrated somehow (i.e. in the brain’s electromagnetic field) and passed back for a decision. It’s the decision – yes, no, maybe, I don’t know, not yet, if conditions warrant, keep in mind, that’s interesting, etc. – that constitutes choice and, thus, free will.<br>  <br>  Until we discover extraterrestrial life, our best understanding says that the universe was over 10 billion years old before the first single-cell life forms arose. Until that point in time, THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE WAS TOTALLY INANIMATE. Then life introduced motility: the ability of animate beings to move about on their own. Life was a major milestone in the history of the universe because, instead of inanimate matter, the universe now had animate beings too. Life is intrinsically and intimately shaped by evolution; an entirely new process in the universe. Pretty major stuff, this life force!<br>  <br>  It would be another 3.5 billion years before humans evolved. Human intelligence is the next major milestone in the history of the universe. Instead of living at the mercy of nature (like all other animals), humans had the intelligence to harness nature: which is to say, humans had the ability to understand, anticipate and use causality for their own purposes . . . clothing, shelter, weapons, tools and fire. This expertise with causality is a prerequisite for intelligence and is also demonstrable evidence of free will.<br>  <br>  Without free will, nature would be the only source of causation on Earth. But free will rises (modestly) above causality and harnesses it to do our bidding. Nature didn't cause man's achievements . . . man did. The only way that could happen is if man has free will. There's nature; and then there's human nature.<br>  <br>  From the empirical point of view, free will is taken for granted: we live, work, play and plan as if we have free will. We don’t experience the horror of watching helplessly as we do things we don’t want to do (unless you suffer from a compulsive disorder).<br>  <br>  I’m aware of the usual objections to the notion of free will. Many very educated people – even those in the fields of physics and neuroscience – believe that everything is physical: matter or energy. There are far too many people who treat the current scientific paradigm just like a religion: they actually put their faith in reductionistic physicalism and conclude that EVERYTHING is determined and that free will is an illusion. They believe it absolutely – despite the experience of their everyday existence.<br>  <br>  The fact is, science is still maturing. Its history is one of successive paradigm shifts. What was once seen as obvious, develops nagging problems, inconsistencies and contradictions. The problems beget new understandings that usher in a new paradigm that becomes the new obvious answer.<br>  <br>  We already know that the existing paradigms are flawed. Relativity doesn’t get along with the quantum world. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle points to a mystical side of quantum physics that stretches credulity and suggests "mind" as a component of the material universe.<br>  <br>  Matter emerges from nowhere and disappears again. Subatomic particles can’t both be and be known to be. Matter shifts from existing to only having the potential to exist.<br>  <br>  Our human acts affect what is true at the quantum level. The act of measurement distorts what’s being measured. Human consciousness itself seeps into the discussion of quantum physics. Consciousness, mind, data, or whatever you want to call it, is beginning to factor into quantum physics and even black holes. These curious developments are the dissonances that precede paradigm shifts. It appears that the next paradigm will need to accommodate "consciousness, mind, data, or whatever you want to call it".<br>  <br>  The question of human consciousness has been relegated to philosophers until fairly recently. As of late, neuroscience has made some amazing inroads to understanding this “emergent property of the brain”. The more they learn, the more it seems that consciousness defies the reductionistic physicalism of science’s true believers. Consciousness (and life and intelligence) is one of the incongruencies revealing the gaps in the physicalism of our current paradigm.<br>  <br>  Perhaps the next scientific paradigm will account for the distinct differences between inanimate matter and animate beings (especially human beings). If you look at the trends in the history of the universe, it appears almost as if everything has been leading up to a universe that acknowledges itself via life: human life.|`|C1SOqQSkaa	No - studies show that actions are begun before rational choices are made.<br>  <br>  Free Will is an illusion: a post facto rationalisation for our behaviour.

But our hair does allow for considerable arranging and control. It can contribute a lot toward an attractive appearance.<br>  Hairdressing has a very ancient history. Down through the centuries, hairstyles have varied from country to country and from one period to another. Sometimes human pride has produced very extreme hairstyles. Back in the first century the apostles Paul and Peter found it necessary to counsel Christian women not to be extravagant or put too much importance on hairstyles. (1?Tim. 2:9; 1?Pet. 3:3) Today, however, many boys, by their very long hair and sideburns, draw most attention.<br>  Did not men in Bible times generally wear their hair longer than is customary in most lands today? Undoubtedly they did. But something else is equally certain. What? That men’s hair was still consistently shorter than that of the women. That is why the apostle Paul could write to the congregation at Corinth, Greece, and say: “Does not nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him; but if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her?” (1?Cor. 11:14, 15) How does “nature” teach us this?<br>  Paul’s statement does not mean that men cannot grow long hair like a woman’s, for they can, and today quite a number do. Commenting on Paul’s use of the word “nature” here, Bible scholar Albert Barnes said: “The word .?.?. denotes evidently that sense of propriety which all men have .?.?. It is such as is demanded by the natural sense of fitness among men. .?.?. The word .?.?. refers to a deep internal sense of what is proper and right.”—Notes on the First Epistle of Paul to the Corinthians, pp. 225, 226; see also Aid to Bible Understanding, p. 1207.<br>  So people then recognized that it was the “natural” thing—the proper and fitting thing—for men to cut their hair to a moderate length, shorter than that of women. We, today, ought to recognize what is “natural” also. A man could let his fingernails grow to a length of several inches—but it is “natural” for him to cut them, since this makes it easier for him to pick things up and do work. A person could go without washing his hands or body for a year at a time—but the “natural” (as well as considerate and healthful) thing to do is to bathe more frequently. Even animals do this.<br>  So, just because something is possible, that does not make it natural, according to the Bible’s definition. For a man or a boy to wear his hair so that he looks like a girl is still “contrary to nature.” It is typical of an age (and lands) where homosexuality is on the increase. And the Bible shows that homosexuality is also “contrary to nature,” both unfitting and detestable in God’s sight.—Rom. 1:26,?27.<br>  Does this severely limit us? No, for just as with clothes, so with hairstyles there is a wide variety of ways of arranging one’s hair that are pleasing and attractive without being immodest or unnatural. There can still be refreshing variety without going beyond the bounds of what is right in God’s eyes.

AA12010793	Wicca is a religion in which the practitioner believes they can manipulate the powers within certain chemicals and through particular rituals and chants, cause either good or harm. It is not necessarily good but it isn't necessarily bad, either. Wiccan followers tend to think of themselves as witches. Most non-Wiccans believe the religion is one of dark magic and that it is sinful and an abomination. It is also considered to be a form of paganism.|`|AA10430184	Go to Witch Vox<br>  <a href="http://www.witchvox.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.witchvox.com/</a><br>  They have a ton of information that will help you find the answers to your questions.|`|dFBccLExaa	Wicca isn't bad, it's not of the devil, it won't corrupt your sould.

It is earth based, and it promotes duality between the god and goddess. Most all Wiccans are polytheistic, though this isn't an absolute rule. Not all Wiccans practice withcraft, though some do. Mainly the religion is about the earth, the seasons, elements, etc. The religion really focuses on not hurting others, as seen by the threefold rule of whatever you send out comes back at you three fold- including bad stuff as well. So it promotes being nice. Best way to learna bout it is to read up on it.|`|21808938a2c954ea0389683f10267c69aa	Wicca is a 20th century neopagan polytheistic religion.  Ritual generally centers around a particular god and goddess.  Ritual also commonly incorporates the Platonic elements.  Wicca is esoteric and occult: followers are seeking personal religious experience and understanding rather than in mainstream Western religion where divine revelation is transmitted to believers through prophets and writings.  It also sees the spiritual and physical worlds as being intimately connected to each other.<br>  <br>  Wiccans generally believe in magic, but may or may not practice any form of practical magic.  We generally avoid associating magic with colors.  Magic is magic.  It's a tool.  The only good or bad to it is how you use it, just like how you can use a hammer to build a house or break a skull...either way, the nature of the hammer is the same.<br>  <br>  Wicca is a religion.  White magic is part of a magical practice.  So no, I would say that Wicca is like white magic.

OLnmXeWDaa	(It isn't bashing to reveal the long suppressed truth about a religion that comes to my door telling me lies.)<br>  <br>  God used angels  with drawn swords to force polygamy on poor Smith. He also gave a revelation concerning Smith's first wife Emma. She should submit or be destroyed, D&C 132.<br>  <br>  Yet God didn't bother with a single revelation or angel to tell Smith that all people should be treated equally. If He had bothered, maybe the LDS church wouldn't have been racists so late in the game.<br>  <br>  Emma denied that Smith ever practiced polygamy after she left the LDS church.<br>  <br>  Oddly, the polygamy revelation says that you should only take virgins that your wife approves of.

0aN1xIxfaa	Christians do use prayer. Constantly. Furthermore, they are willing to be the answers to their prayers. They don't pray to God, "Here I am! Send him!"<br>  <br>  Jesus said to pray to the Father to send more workers out into the harvest, because the (symbolic) fields were white unto harvest. Christians are to be those workers, labouring for the Master in the saving of souls. God could have chosen angels to do that work of preaching the gospel, but no - he has chosen imperfect sinners who put their faith in Christ as being the resurrection and the life. Their changed lives are testimony to the reality of the living Christ and His power at work through their weak earthen vessels. Jesus said to cast the seed of the gospel indiscriminately, in good soil and in poor soil. God grants growth.|`|2JbCMKNAaa	God answers my prayers...all of them.<br>  <br>  Prayer is not a weapon...it is communication with God. God's Word is the most powerful weapon we have against evil.|`|CvVgihRtaa	Prayer is indeed one of the weapons in a Christian's arsenal.  Others include, the word of God, the name of Jesus, obedience and the blood of Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, since many Christians are socially involved with others persons they are yet to discover the power of prayer.  And other Christians neglect to pray for various reasons.<br>  <br>  However Christians still need to preach and teach God's word for they are commanded to do so.  <br>  <br>  Debates and arguments may be beneficial in some situations but not all the time.  And if some Christians did pray they would be guided to know when to argue and when not to.<br>  <br>  I also think that if the power of prayer is preached about more from our pulpits then more Christians would know about this power and be able to live up to being godly and holy and being better witnesses.  Let's then pray for our pastors to preach more on this topic.<br>  <br>  Thank you for this reminder.
D6FBLQfwaa	Historically, Romania has always seemed to get bad deals politically. First they were caught between the fued of the Ottoman Empire and the Holy League, and were ultimately ceded to the Ottomans. Then they got swallowed up by the Austrians after the Ottomans left. Then they got crushed by the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Before being bullied by the Soviets, who eventually forced them to become part of the Communist Bloc. Whew...quite the sucky turn of events for poor Romania. Just like the kid who gets pushed around in school, Romania is now having some trouble emotionally.

AA10182088	if anyone is "denying" history it's only because they don't want the wrongs of their race to be in the light...but that shouldn't be the issues if we want our people to move forward. As long as the truth is out there and "we" know it we don't have to prove anything anymore.|`|DfDss68haa	Africa is being erased from history and you are very astute to notice this. Well, it really doesn't take being astute, just being willing to see Black people as the kings and queens we once were and will be again. I am noticing too that there is an unwillingness to give Africans credit for their contributions from the biggest thing (denial of Pharoahs being Black) to the smallest things (dreadlocs have become an European invention and every Disney princess but the black one was allowed to be princesses in their country of origin). Mulan, Pocahontas, Cinderella, were all princesses in their respective countries. But not the upcoming Princess Tiana who is a princess in Louisiana. Not African princesses allowed which is incredibly offensive. There are tons of ancient royalty they could have chosen from. <br>  <br>  1st This might seem like a small thing but it's quite significant. It's indicative of an overall belief that Africa has no culture, had no royalty, Africa has always been a cesspool. That's not even true today. Native Americans, Asians, Europeans have all been given a certain allure and the credit their ancient civilations deserve but there is still an idea that Blacks have been benefited by slavery. But why are black people being denied credit? It takes the guilt out of slavery for White people basically. If they acknowledge that Africa was once a prosperous, successful and diverse continent run by Black people (the same people they have degraded and placed below themselves) they would have to admit they did something truly horrible. Sure slavery was horrible blah blah blah but they can tell themselves in the back of their mind that at least Africans aren't in that horrible place anymore so in a way they did us a FAVOR.<br>  <br>  2nd Also there is another reason. There is still extreme prejudice against everything Black. This creates a two fold behavior within white people. We are forbidden, our creations are forbidden so they become cool. BUT they want to still be accepted so they try to have their cake and eat it too by rocking Black creations but "white washing" them by saying that White people created them. This way they get the cool factor by being LIKE black people but they can rationalize it by saying that Black people didn't really create it. "That's an urban myth" they can tell themselves.<br>  <br>  3rd The last reason I have noticed is still that there is racism and becuase Black people are not the top of our society today they must NEVER have been on top. I see this when someone says that Cleopatra was not a black woman. They inevitably follow up this statement with some racism like "Yeah, right like Cleopatra was Shaniqua and had braids." They are incapable of seeing modern black people as royalty and can't see past their prejudice.<br>  <br>  And then anyone who has brain cells and has noticed this gradual erasement and downplaying of African contributions and creations is labeled "Afrocentric." We don't get any credibility becuase we are "crazy". I guess seeing the obvious became being Afrocentric. Whatever, we know the truth but it makes me sad to see all these black children walking around unaware with their heritage and believing Eurocentric lies.<br>  <br>  <br>  Digga: I will always see Cleopatra as a black woman and certainly not as the white skinned blue eyed actress Hollywood has protrayed her as but understand her race is in dispute. Whether she is black or not some people would refuse to see her as black becuase of prejudice, I was more bringing it up as an example of how people think when they deny Black contributions. <br>  <br>  @ Zumaria. Excellent excellent poem. So true, I know some people like to write off Blacks and Africans and want to believe Europeans will always be the world power but the wheel is always turning and Black people will rise again. I try not to get angry at blantant lies and rewriting of history but sometimes it's hard but I should remember that anything they do doesn't touch the core of us.|`|4a43ce24fc25ee210c17b8882b616386aa	You are so right!<br>  Why?

If you look at history, every nation that conquers another will erase their history, to totally subjugate a people.  This was done beginning in the late 1700's and all the way up until today.  Look at how this was done:  <br>  <br>  1) They purposefully took slaves from different parts of Africa, and different tribes so that they could not communicate. <a href="http://icarusfilms.com/new2005/hamb2.html" rel="nofollow">http://icarusfilms.com/new2005/hamb2.htm...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.worldartswest.org/plm/guide/locator/namericanhambone.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldartswest.org/plm/guide/l...</a><br>  <br>  2) They forbade the use of the drum, which was another way they could have communicated to each other.<br>  <br>  3) They also erased their true names and languages, making them take a new language and new names, that is why you have creole languages, the slaves tried to keep some of their own original tongue, and mixed it with the colonial one.  This link explains this even more:  <a href="http://www.geographia.com/bonaire/bonpap01.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.geographia.com/bonaire/bonpap...</a><br>  <br>  Later on, many creations of blacks such as rock and roll music, was kept hidden, but the truth came out.<br>  <br>  The light is at the end of the tunnel.  More and more, the truth IS coming out, and most people today DO recognize that blacks have had great civilizations like all other people on this earth.<br>  <br>  The amazing thing to me is that despite all of this, blacks in America have overcome so may obstacles and have had such an impact on the culture of this country.  There is no limit to what we can accomplish when we put our minds to it.  It reminds me of the poetry of Maya Angelou, her poem "And Still I Rise":<br>  <br>  You may write me down in history<br>  With your bitter, twisted lies,<br>  You may trod me in the very dirt<br>  But still, like dust, I'll rise.<br>  <br>  Does my sassiness upset you?<br>  Why are you beset with gloom?<br>  'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells<br>  Pumping in my living room.<br>  <br>  Just like moons and like suns,<br>  With the certainty of tides,<br>  Just like hopes springing high,<br>  Still I'll rise.<br>  <br>  Did you want to see me broken?<br>  Bowed head and lowered eyes?<br>  Shoulders falling down like teardrops.<br>  Weakened by my soulful cries.<br>  <br>  Does my haughtiness offend you?<br>  Don't you take it awful hard<br>  'Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines<br>  Diggin' in my own back yard.<br>  <br>  You may shoot me with your words,<br>  You may cut me with your eyes,<br>  You may kill me with your hatefulness,<br>  But still, like air, I'll rise.<br>  <br>  Does my sexiness upset you?<br>  Does it come as a surprise<br>  That I dance like I've got diamonds<br>  At the meeting of my thighs?<br>  <br>  Out of the huts of history's shame<br>  I rise<br>  Up from a past that's rooted in pain<br>  I rise<br>  I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide,<br>  Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.<br>  Leaving behind nights of terror and fear<br>  I rise<br>  Into a daybreak that's wondrously clear<br>  I rise<br>  Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,<br>  I am the dream and the hope of the slave.<br>  I rise<br>  I rise<br>  I rise. <br>  <br>  Maya Angelou <br>  <a href="http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/still-i-rise/" rel="nofollow">http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/still-i-r...</a>|`|OZjlW5utaa	Basically people find it hard to think of Black people as people who have contributed greatly to the world, or have built great and powerful civilizations. Black Civilizations are either written off as the makings of a non black group or are just written off completely as now they hold no apparent significance and then we hardly learn or hear about them. Even with overwhelming evidence, like you've said, close minded people find it hard to believe that Black people, who have been labeled as a group who cannot contribute greatly, weren't able to create this powerful empires and cultures just like the kingdom of kush, Nubia, modern day northern Sudan, kingdom of great Zimbabwe or the nok in Nigeria.<br>  <br>  Nine: I know the Egyptians had black population, but Cleopatra wasn't black, I don't even think her ethnicity has been proved by anyone.

As far as African Americans contributions to this county's not being recognized it's a matter that is addressed by many people and has been for years.  You can count on your fingers how many people know that African Americans invented such things as the toilet, ice cream, the steam engine, air brakes for buses, and it was an African American who first reached the top of Everest.  In general schools are responsible for not teaching the history of this country instead of just the CAUCASIAN history of this country and that ridiculous "black history month" is an insult.  They have tagged it with a color citing dark times and then it's as if all that's required is 30 days out of the year and all that's focused on is what MLK and Rosa Parks did.  There are so many other contributors that are not discussed because it would enlighten people to the truth.  Benjamin Franklin was an old man when he "discovered" electricity.  Do you really believe that HE was the one out there standing in the rain, thunder and lightening flying a kite??  It was his African SLAVE that held that kite.  Things like this are kept under wraps.

Fact and Reality./|`|wlqUMBZbaa	Ask God - he will tell you what you need to know.<br>  <br>  The Jehovahs Witness movement was founded by someone who kept predicting the end of the world - that was over a hundred years ago.<br>  <br>  My wife has had so many blood transfusions as a result of something that wasn't her fault - in the eyes of the JW's she has already booked her place in hell - I rejoice her continued existence with every new day!<br>  <br>  Convinced of my own rightesousness? I don't know about that but I am convinced that before God I will be unafraid and will look him right in the eye and say "that really was my best father, do with me as you will".<br>  <br>  And if I go to hell, it will be without regret - I couldn't have done any more!|`|5aqYVyvAaa	Well hon,<br>  It sounds like you're on the right track. You want to do what's right you love God and your children. I honestly don't understand all that's bothering you (I never heard you can't wear jeans and stuff) but this is what I would do:<br>  <br>  Pray, pray really really hard. Write down all the things that bother you (like the birthday thing, it's origin, and anything else in general) and try to find answers in the Bible one at a time. That's where the Word of God is. If you can't find the answer (via the Bible,your priest, internet, JW's or anything like that) you can ask all of us on Yahoo. There are a lot of us on here (JWs, Bible students, and the like to help you) I'm sure you'll find the answers that you seek. <br>  <br>  One thing that helps me with different things in the Bible that I have a hard time with is this:<br>  <br>  When you put together a puzzle there WILL always be a piece or two that you just can't fit anywhere. What do you do? Throw the piece out? No! You put it aside and when you put more of the pieces together everything falls into place and makes sense.<br>  <br>  The Bible, God's word is like a puzzle. There WILL be things that we will not understand or agree with. But that's no reason to throw away everything you've learned from the Bible. Just put it aside and focus on things that you do agree with like God's amazing Love for us and Jesus' ransom sacrifice. Everything else will fall into place. I promise.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!!!|`|641c55ed860a473abbc5c57c2b35186aaa	I couldn't have said it better myself...this is exactly how I feel.  The words you said, your feelings of what God wants...that comes from the spirit inside you and you need to listen to the holy spirit inside you and don't listen to man or organized religion.  Use your mind and seek the truth and you will find it with the help of the holy spirit.  If something doesn't feel right...doesn't look right when you read it - that is the holy spirit interceding and nudging you telling you to pay attention.  Why this hasn't happened for the others we may not know until we cross over but we can definitely pray for them to find the truth as peacefully as possible.<br>  <br>  I think it is great that you said that you respect them, they do have a right to their beliefs but you should not be forced into believing what you feel is not in your heart and THEY should respect that also, if they don't and force you or judge you then they are not following the true word of God.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	"Jehovah's Witness" (JW) is a cult.  They are not Christian.  They reject the truth that Jesus is God, and they reject the truth that salvation is only by believing in Jesus alone to save you, without adding any of your own works. <br>  <br>  Avoid JW, and believe in the true Jesus, who is God!  Jesus loves you so very much!  :) <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|IxzJ6SN5aa	I believe if you believe that Jesus is the son of God and came to earth to save you, such rituals as baptisim are meaningless.  God loves you. He's not a bean counter who cares what human ritual you observed.|`|S4XUl7qWaa	It is up to each person to choose her or his own path. We all have our own lives to live, and our own personal perspectives to discover and follow. There's nothing wrong with this at all-- except that many seek to use their personal truth as a force of control against those who walk a different path.<br>  <br>  A person's religion or lack thereof is a highly personal decision, and none of anyone else's business, even your parents.|`|SDDgbtQ4aa	I believe that you are right in that God has better things to do than nitpick over whether you're wearing a comfy pair of jeans vs. a nice skirt, and whether or not you ate cake and sang a happy song in honor of the anniversary of your birth.  (Like, doesn't God want us to appreciate our lives?)<br>  <br>  It all depends on which folks in which denomination of Christianity you ask as to what is required for you to earn a "ticket to heaven".  They can't all be right, obviously, because some beliefs on the matter even within Christianity conflict with others.<br>  <br>  So, my advice would be - leave out the "middle-man", the imperfect egotistical humans, and talk directly with your God - seek the answers from Him, let Him guide you along your path.<br>  <br>  But just for the record - not every "group" out here believes we are the ONES, and ours is the ONLY way for *everyone*.  IMHO, spirituality is not a "one size fits all".<br>  <br>  Hope your day gets better. :)<br>  <br>  Blessings on your journey.|`|a1Iv39BLaa	Being righteous is an ego problem. Truth is different for everyone. No 2 people have the same truth. Your truth is yours and yours alone and your spirit knows and is your truth. Religion is an outward expression for the physical body only. True spirituality is being in contact with your own spirit, letting your spirit have the lead in your life rather than your mind which is full of concepts and dogma. Your spirit, your true self, will always give you the truth, never lie to you. Your intuition is your spirit talking to you.|`|8Zey1ntAaa	I am convinced that if you're going to claim something is The Truth then you better be able to provide evidence to back up you claims.|`|AQBow7Glaa	JW's reading of the Bible has as much authority as anyone else's. Maybe even more, because at least they actually read the Bible and try to apply its rules in a consistent way instead of skipping the parts they don't like and cherry-picking the parts they do.<br>  <br>  But I think the answer to your question is in the question: if everybody is convinced of their own righteousness and they're all saying different things, they can't all be right.<br>  <br>  So either one of them is right, or they're all wrong.<br>  <br>  So which is more likely: that one of these hundreds of groups got it exactly right and successfully read the mind of God?  Or that they're just all wrong and it's just a book?|`|T5BshhZWaa	don't worry<br>  god does not exist<br>  we are all going to die someday<br>  after you look at this would think that if god really created us he does not give a dam about us<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGxRWCmwSDE&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGxRWCmwS...</a>|`|sa1Xgu61aa	1 John 4<br>  <br>   1 Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits, whether they are of God; because many false prophets have gone out into the world. 2 By this you know the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God, 3 and every spirit that does not confess that[a] Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God. And this is the spirit of the Antichrist, which you have heard was coming, and is now already in the world.<br>  4 You are of God, little children, and have overcome them, because He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world. 5 They are of the world. Therefore they speak as of the world, and the world hears them. 6 We are of God. He who knows God hears us; he who is not of God does not hear us. By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.<br>  <br>  <br>  The Jehovah's Witnesses deny that Jesus Christ was God in the flesh and are thereby of that spirit of the evil one.  Please do not be decieved but keep your eyes on JESUS and His Word.  The JW are known for taking a verse or two out of a whole scripture and twisting it to fit their meaning.  <br>  <br>  They cite the passage in Revelation of the 144,000 being saved (which is the tribes of Israel by the way). The problem is that once there were 144,000 Jehovah's Witnesses, they had to change their doctrine!<br>  <br>  Here is a great website that you can use the counter some otheir erroneous doctrines with the first website countering all of the scriptures that they are taught to twist:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cftf.com/comments/bibleans.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cftf.com/comments/bibleans.ht...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.blueletterbible.org/study/cults/rajwd/index.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.blueletterbible.org/study/cul...</a> <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.carm.org/religious-movements/jehovahs-witnesses/biblical-response-jehovahs-witnesses" rel="nofollow">http://www.carm.org/religious-movements/...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-eden/edn-r005.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.christiananswers.net/q-eden/e...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  ***Please note that many people in the JW are geniunely nice people.  They have just been led down a wrong path, and is a case of the blind leading the blind.  We need to rescue them out of that pit that they're heading towards!<br>  <br>  Grace to you as you answer these people that the LORD loves too, out of a heart of love and gratitude that God has given you the ability to share hope with them.  <br>  <br>  **The Ten commandments are always great to go through also, if they do not understand that they need a Saviour and forgiveness from JESUS.  They seem to think they can make it to Heaven by their works.  **See Ephesisans 2:8-10, and www.needgod.com

W76VDFKCaa	Racism reminds me of the childhood story 'the boy who cried wolf.'  People who cry 'racism' at every little thing makes it difficult for others to see racism when it actually does happen.

SsSIbFhcaa	The first thing you need to consider is who is the audience in the Old Testament and the New Testament. By that I mean who is God dealing with and the focus.<br>  <br>  The Old Testament is about God dealing with the Nation of Israel. Its about God and his relationship with his people as he tried to get them to do what he wanted.<br>  <br>  The New Testament changes focus. No longer is the focus on a Nation of people but on individuals.<br>  <br>  People consider this proof that God changes, what they fail to take into account is it's not God changing but the circumstance, methods and situation that is changing.<br>  <br>  The Old Testament still has validity. It tells us of God's nature, it also speaks to how patient he is with man, as well as other applications. There is also information in the Old Testament in the nature of prophecy that has not come to past and speaks to a point in time in the future.|`|AA10988107	God could have wiped out all on earth at any time, but he <br>  has not done so.<br>  In all this time in the bible, there has been a few good men.<br>  Just think about how many decent people there were when<br>  the flood came to wipe out earth wide violence, year 1656.<br>  <br>  Abraham is not surrounded by anything God could look<br>  down upon and be proud of at 427 years after year 1656.<br>  <br>  When Moses dies 470 years later, there have been a few<br>  good men, but not the majority as Joshua establishes a<br>  way for law enforcers to get a start as Judges.<br>  <br>  1Ki.6:1 and 480 years later, Solomon is third king and has <br>  36 more years, there will be 18 kings to year 3460 [ 606<br>  BCE, now at 2009 CE, that was 2615 years ago, no king<br>  but king Jesus at 2nd coming when it is 14 generations <br>  more to 1st coming, Matt.1:1-17, in the New Testament.<br>   <br>  So how different is it at 2009 years after bible years ended?<br>  What improvements has man made living under law and<br>  order as much as possible earthwide?|`|AA11992885	the God of the OT is strict, but the god portrayed in the NT declares God to be a liar<br>  <br>  almost EVERYTHING that God said HE would NEVER do, during the days of the OT, the NT declares that God did them, thus, God would have lied when HE said NEVER<br>  <br>  God in the OT is CONSISTENT, and giving mercy, a NT was never needed for the sake of mercy<br>  <br>  the OT showed punishments, but it did not always put forth how much evil was in the world at those points in time, for instance, the flood.......God gave 120 years for anyone to repent, and no one did........the Israelites were given 40 years before their punishment was exacted..........over and over and over again, God gave time and mercy.............the NT declares that God was without mercy back then, thus, lying........not to mention the things that the NT declares about what God did in later days, thus making HIM a liar|`|AA10014750	The Lord (not lord) of Genesis-Malachi (excluding an obvious reference in Judith, a Catholic book) was Jesus of Matthew-Revelation.|`|aPuj6xoHaa	Unchanged.<br>  <br>  God does not change, He is the same yesterday, today and tomorrow.|`|j0oU4V3baa	OT was a reall jacka$$<br>  <br>  NT was nicer and impregnated Mary with Himself<br>  <br>  But theyre both FAKE|`|AA11109467	It's not the difference in God that exists between the two.<br>  <br>  It's the difference in the various writers' PERCEPTION of God.<br>  <br>  Look at it this way.

AbRfd29Haa	The recent theories, based at least in part on the material you cite (we share only a distant ancestor with the Neanderthal), leads modern anthropologists to conclude that competition with us (we call our early ancestors of the time Cro-Magnon, but yeah, that's us -- they were "anatomically modern humans") lead to the Neanderthal's downfall. <br>  <br>  The fossil evidence is that the last Neanderthals lives in southern Spain, where they were able to avoid contact with the growing Cro-Magnon population. This does not, however, suggest that there was any specific plan of genocide at work here. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/12/neanderthals-co.html" rel="nofollow">http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/...</a><br>  <br>  The conclusion is simply that Neanderthals didn't thrive where they had to compete with modern man. It could be any number of things... perhaps we so out-hunted them, they couldn't remain healthy on the food we left them... we do know our ancestors made much better tools. Even among humans, it's rare for a less advanced society to coexist with a technologically more advanced culture. <br>  <br>  Could be we carried a disease fatal to them, much as resulting deaths among the Aztecs and Maya when the Eurpoeans came to the Americas, or to the Maori in New Zealand, or the Aborigines in Australia. <br>  <br>  It doesn't have to be just one thing.. what we do is that Neanderthals failed when Cro-Magnons moved in. There may not be any final explanation. We are pretty sure at this point that climate change, once the "certain" cause, is no longer a sufficient explanation:<br>  <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/09/070912154630.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/200...</a><br>  <br>  In a biological sense, the Cro-Magnon were an invasive species... there were certainly better adapted at filling the Neanderthal's niche in the ecosystem.

There's some evidence that it might be the oldest surviving language, and possibly related to the oldest written languages, but that's hardly the same thing.<br>  <br>  2 - Languages, unlike racial characteristics, are not passed down and inherited through genetics.  Even if Sanskrit was the first language, there's no evidence that it was invented by or even spoken by the genetic ancestors of those of the Indian sub-continent.  Most evidence suggests that the language originated in the Anatolia region.<br>  <br>  3 - The split between anthropoid apes and monkeys occurred some 10-15 million years ago.  This is quite a bit longer ago than any evidence of any language used by Homo sapiens sapiens.  The earliest evidence for Homo sapiens sapiens itself comes from only 100,000 years ago in South Africa.

The most poets are belonged to brahmin community.  it is Vu.Ve.Swaminatha Iyer gave life to tamil language.  He lived in 20th century.  He is a brahmin.  similarly, a well known scholer called Suryanarayana sastrigal who on the love and affection of tamil language changed his name as Parithimarkalaignar.  He too was a brahmin.  You know poet Mahakavi Bharathiar and his contributions to tamil language.  He is also a brahmin.  In fact Agasthiya Rishi also a brahmin who gave grammer to tamil language.  i will not say that Brahmin alone gave life to the tamil language, but the contribution given by brahmins are more. Now, anyone may take and title himself as a tamilian, but a true tamilian are the persons who gave more contributions by promoting the language are brahmins.  you can not hide the history. Take the writer called  KALKI.  His contribution to tamil language are beyond the words.  He is a brahmin.  Take another writer CHANDILYAN  whose contribution also similar to kalki.  He is also a   brahmin.  Take S.S.Vasan, the owner of gemini studios who took Avvaiyar film.  His contribution to tamil cenema, and similarly muktha srinivasan are beyond the words.  i can say more and more, but i said only for an example.  ok.  Tamil language is an ancient language like sanscrit language.  Some languages grown fast and some languages grown slowly.  Our nation have so many languages and among the languages in india, certainly the tamil and sanscrit are the oldest and ancient language.  There is a link between sanscrit and tamil.  you can find many sanscrit letters, words in tamil language.  It is fact that we are living on the struggle of our elders and the tamil language grown and shined because of our elders.  For the past 40 years no one took steps to promote the language, but they will shout that they are tamilians.  it is true.  some say that tamil language is at singapore, srilanka, malaysia, moritiaous island etc.,  yes, it is true but those people are the people gone from tamilnadu only now many settled there.

XN0cYCATaa	No,Jesus Paid for thier sins as well, it was no longer required to do that<br>  <br>  Christianity is not properly represented by the Inquisition and the Salem Witch Trials. Though these things happened in the name of "Christianity" it does not mean that this is what Christianity teaches. Instead, Christianity professes conversion by love not by torture.  Those who you used coercive means did so against the Christian scriptures.<br>  <br>  Matt. 5:43-44, "You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor, and hate your enemy.' 44 'But I say to you, love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you.'" <br>  Rom. 16:19, "For the report of your obedience has reached to all; therefore I am rejoicing over you, but I want you to be wise in what is good, and innocent in what is evil." <br>  Col. 4:5-6, "Conduct yourselves with wisdom toward outsiders, making the most of the opportunity. 6 Let your speech always be with grace, seasoned, as it were, with salt, so that you may know how you should respond to each person." <br>  1 Tim. 3:7, "And he must have a good reputation with those outside the church, so that he may not fall into reproach and the snare of the devil." <br>  There have been times in the Christian church where those who have claimed to follow Christ have done horrible things. They have done these things not because Christ teaches them to, but because they have not listened to the word of God. As is frequently established in history when anyone comes into complete political and military control that abuse almost always follows. The Inquisition was a Roman Catholic invention intended to root out all sorts of "heresies." The Inquisition used torturous means to force confessions out of people. Thousands were killed mercilessly and unjustly. The Protestant Reformation distances itself from the Catholic Inquisition. However, it has its own sordid history and the witch trials we had here in America among some Puritans is an example.  They allowed their paranoia and ignorance to overtake reason and scripture.  As a result, many people were killed because they were accused of being witches -- and they weren't.<br>  <br>  Again, this does not mean that Christianity is false anymore than the police force is false because one or two cops did bad things in the name of the law. Instead of looking at the two cops, the whole of the police force, its goals, other cops, and its history of sacrifice and protection must be examined as well. The same as Christianity. It has a great history of helping countless people, establishing orphanages, building shelters, helping famine ravaged countries, and seeking to aid the downtrodden.<br>  <br>  If anyone wishes to condemn Christianity because of the failures of its members, then will they also look at its successes and approve of Christianity? It would only be fair to look at the whole of Christian history and more importantly at what the Bible actually teaches, in particular the New Testament, from which Christianity is derived.<br>  <br>  Believe in Christianity because Jesus Christ claimed to be God in flesh, died for our sins, rose from the dead, and has given us the New Testament. Believe in Jesus because He performed miracles in front of eyewitnesses and He said that He was the way the truth in a life (John 14:6).

The Hebrew word which was translated in the KJV to witch was more properly "poisoner."<br>  <br>  Second, whether following a biblical injunction or not, the torturing and killing of thousands of innocent people (take a look at the ways they proved witchcraft) is nearly as horrific as the Holocaust, even if the numbers are much smaller.  <br>  <br>  Third, the bible also enjoins believers to stone people to death for working on Sunday, and to stone to death immoral women or disobedient children.  Would you consider any of those actions to be wrong?  Is anything countenanced by the bible moral and just in modern times merely because the bible says it is?  <br>  <br>  Frankly, one of the reasons I started to doubt the bible, and by extension, the god thereof, was that no loving, caring deity could possibly behave with such callous and brutal disregard of human life and be worthy of my respect and admiration.

However most apparently did not.<br>   Some of the victims were midwives and native healers; however most were not.<br>   Most of the victims were tried executed by local, community courts, not by the Church.<br>   A substantial minority of victims -- about 25% -- were male.<br>   Many countries in Europe largely escaped the burning times: Ireland executed only four "Witches;" Russia only ten. The craze affected mostly Switzerland, Germany and France.<br>   Eastern Orthodox countries had few Witch trials. "In parts of the Orthodox East, at least, witch hunts such as those experienced in other parts of Europe were unknown...."The Orthodox Church is strongly critical of sorcerers (among whom it includes palmists, fortune tellers and astrologers), but has not generally seen the remedy in accusations, trials and secular penalties, but rather in confession and repentance, and exorcism if necessary...." 1<br>   Most of the deaths seem to have taken place in Western Europe in the times and areas where Protestant - Roman Catholic conflict -- and thus social turmoil -- was at its maximum.|`|4qj98nhdaa	That bit of the bible was inserted by the King James bible.

J7KSKm54aa	These three pigs walked into a bar. All three of them ordered a diet...with vodka. The first pig says to the bartender. Urm, what religion are you? And the guy says "I am Christian". Laughing the pig winks at the second pig. So the second pig says "what kinda Christian are ya"? And the bartender replies- "what do you mean what kind of Christian am I?" The #2 pigs says, "well there are different kinds of Christians. Are you born again"? "well no, I was born right the first time". So the #2 looks to the #3 and winks. #3 says "well, have you ever heard of Gnostic Christianity"? The bartender blanches of course, cos Sylvia Browne is a false prophet and she is sent by the devil. *shaking* He replies, " NO!" So the third pigs says- "well the three of us are thinking that you are in a cult". The bartender just starts to stammer and he looks at the three of them and says " I AM NOT A CULT MEMBER!" So the pigs all start laughing and walk outside.

Now help me build a fire so we can boil the wolf to death and listen to him die, in screaming agony, Praise the Lord!" Get real! If he was such a Christian, then why didn't he offer to feed the wolf? Don't tell me that pigs are vegetarians and wolves are carnivores, so they couldn't feed the wolf. I don't buy that excuse, because pigs aren't carpenters or brick masons either. If a pig can build a house, then by God, he can feed a wolf. Ha ha!|`|1NK1hK1Taa	Athiests? Really? Should they have not faced the wolf and when he attacked them, turn the other cheek?

But it is just a form of un-evolved Human or, yes, a species of great ape. It is as real as you or me, not a ghost of any sort, it is just a misunderstood creature with un uncanny knack for staying hidden. It probably also doesn't help that there aren't very many of them left, that would be another reason we don't see them very often. It's like the case with the recently discovered pygmy race in the Philippines, they discovered his remains and called him "the hobbit" but the found out that he and his race were living only 10000 years ago so our species of human (homosapiens) were around at the same time.

nBERj16Eaa	1st of all, examine your conscience (before confession)<br>  Decide what sins you need to dump. On one hand don't be scrupulous, on the other hand be as specific as you can.<br>  <br>  Basically what you've done that was wrong, and what good you failed to do, and maybe the attitudes behind it all. Don't just say I am sorry. Be specific without worrying how the priest will react. He's there to help.<br>  <br>  Just know your sins and be truly sorry for them.<br>  After confessing the sins, wrap it up by saying, "I'm sorry for any other sins I might have forgotten."<br>  When the priest asks you to do so, pray out loud the Act of Forgiveness (sometimes called the Act of Contrition).  Some Catholics memorize it.   Others, if they are not sure, write it down on a piece of paper and read it; still others make up one by praying from their heart.<br>  Then the priest will give the Absolution. Open up your self to the power of the Holy Spirit. At the end of the absolution prayer, the priest says "I absolve you from your sins, in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, . .." (You bless yourselves as the priest says these words.)<br>  It is then that we believ that your sins are forgiven and your soul will be as clean as it was when you were first baptized!<br>  It feels good to be right with God!<br>  The priest will give you a penance  which is a prayer(s) or maybe a good deed to get you started in living a new life. (You pray that penance after you leave the confessional or reconciliation room.<br>  Finally spend some time just thanking the Lord for His forgiveness.<br>  <br>  The most important thing is to know your sins and to be truly sorry for them.<br>  Hey, I wish you the best, son.  Welcome aboard! Walk in peace with your Savior!<br>  Hope this helps.<br>  Jim|`|AA11058044	I went to Catholic school, and so we had to on occasion go to confession with the priests.  They'd usually set up a couple of chairs in the library, and we'd have to line up to go talk to some old guy we'd never seen before.<br>  <br>  I always confessed to fighting with my brother - which was true, non-specific, and got me out of there reasonably quickly with a minimum of fuss for both myself and the priest.|`|3d7f120f2bf9906d7333799542b3a295aa	The goal of confession is to clear a guilty conscience through repentance.   Just think of something in the past that you know you should not have done, even an emotion or reaction that was uncalled for|`|fcf19f1cefff180142fdd088f485f67baa	First, God bless you and His peace be with you.  It brings so much joy to Christ's heart when a person embraces the Sacrament of Confession.<br>  <br>  I went through RCIA, too, 4 years ago, and I love seeing new converts.  <br>  <br>  Confession isn't complicated.  When you enter the confessional, cross yourself in the name of the Holy Trinity, tell the father how long it's been since your last confession, and then confess your sins.  Afterwards, he may give you some counsel, and will give you a penance.  Make sure you complete your penance after the confession, or the confession will not be valid.  <br>  <br>  After he gives you a penance, he will ask you to make an Act of Contrition.  Then, he will say the prayer that absolves your sins.<br>  <br>  And that's it!<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that there's nothing wrong with asking for help.  Many people enter the confessional unsure of what to do, so it's perfectly okay to ask the priest for help.  He is more than used to it and will be glad to.<br>  <br>  God bless.|`|AA11440601	Reconciliation is a sacrament meant to be a healing encounter between God and the penitent, and there is no need to worry about exactly what to say or do. <br>  <br>  This is one way how to go to Confession<br>  <br>  ? Get yourself ready by making your examination of conscience.<br>  <br>  You enter the confessional. You can choose to talk to the priest face to face or anonymously behind a screen.<br>  <br>  ? After the priest greets you with the Sign of the Cross make the Sign of the Cross and say: “Bless me Father for I have sinned. It has been (say how long) since my last confession. These are my sins…”<br>  <br>  ? Tell your sins simply and honestly to the priest. Don’t be embarrassed.<br>  <br>  ? When you are done listing your sins please say: “…I am sorry for these sins and all the sins I can’t remember.”<br>  <br>  ? Listen to the advice the priest gives you and accept the penance from him. Then make an Act of Contrition for your sins:<br>  <br>  My God,<br>  I am sorry for my sins with all my heart.<br>  In choosing to do wrong<br>  And failing to do good,<br>  I have sinned against you<br>  whom I should love above all things.<br>  I firmly intend, with your help,<br>  to do penance,<br>  to sin no more,<br>  and to avoid whatever leads me to sin.<br>  Amen.<br>  <br>  ? The priest will then conclude with the words: “Your sins are truly forgiven, Go in Peace”. You respond: “Thanks be to God.”<br>  <br>  ? Perform your penance as soon as possible.<br>  <br>  For more information, see the Catechism of the Catholic Church, sections 1422 and following: <a href="http://www.nccbuscc.org/catechism/text/pt2sect2chpt2.shtml#art4" rel="nofollow">http://www.nccbuscc.org/catechism/text/p...</a><br>  <br>  With love in Christ.|`|VFWRdAH3aa	you confess everything you've done wrong.|`|IGQw4267aa	When I was 9 I said that "I hit my brother in the face".

Yes, techinically you are only obligated to confess your mortal sins... that is the only way they can be forgiven. But it is also very good to confess even your venial sins (the little stuff). Don't hold back. Anyone who tells you that you should only confess mortal sins is forgetting something important: the sacramental power of confession. Reconciliation gives us extra grace to help us not sin again!|`|YnGIccE8aa	You need to reflect upon the ten commandments and determine which of your "big" sins coincide with what God commanded us not to do.<br>  <br>  When you enter the confessional you say "Forgive me Father (that's God the Father, not the priest you are confessing to) for I have sinned, this is my first confession." <br>  <br>  Have you taken the Lord's name in vain? If so confess it. You don't need an exact number. Coveted? Had an affair? Stolen anything? Murdered someone? All to be confessed. You typically don't need to give details, just the sin.<br>  <br>  The priest hears your sins, prays with you, gives you a penance and grants absolution. You then say an act of contrition together, you leave the confessional and go do your penance. <br>  <br>  It's not as scary as it sounds, in fact it's quite freeing. You'll learn more about it through RCIA prior to the confession.<br>  <br>  Oh and welcome home!|`|wxBFZ41Taa	Well, your RCIA leaders should be able to help you. <br>  <br>  But you need to spend some time examining your conscience.

Spend time in prayer before hand and ask God to help you make a good confession. We are to hate our sins because they hurt and offend God. It isn't about feeling guilty or feeling that you've done wrong, but about knowing that you've offended the one who loves you perfectly and died for you.|`|AhJaRRlbaa	Ask your RCIA teacher to give you a guide to the Examination of Conscience, and a guide for Confessions.

I'm sorry to hear how pitiful RCIA instruction can sometimes be.|`|dqZrq7Zeaa	You are supposed to list your sins.  Of course everyone gives a shortened version. <br>  You begin with "Bless me Father for I have sinned this is my first confession. (later times you just say how long it's been).<br>  The point of confession is to make you think about how you live. The priest can't forgive you because god already did. It's more like therapy in a box.<br>  Then the Priest gives you penance to do. Most of the time it's prayers.. sometimes it's acts.<br>  <br>  It's not that bad..

It is healthy and helpful for us to confess our sins one to another to avoid falling again.

He listens to us and when we fall away he guides us back to the flock.   Our priest is the human leader of the flock .|`|liJKE5B2aa	You're wasting your time. No MORTAL man can absolve you of sin. A priest does not represent the God of the Bible. you should only confess to Jesus. Please wake up.|`|kKXvIOyWaa	If you're in RCIA then hopefully they should give you a bit of a walkthrough before they send you in for confession.  If not, just mention to the priest that you're new at this and he should help walk you through it.<br>  <br>  As for what to confess, that's something personal that only you can decide.  The only advice I can really give you is to think about what things are aggravating your conscience or your mind.  Even if it's not actually a sinful action, telling the priest about any "yucky" things in your life can really help.  And (I know, easier said than done) there's no need to be nervous, because most of these priests have probably heard everything.    <br>  <br>  I'm sure your RCIA course will give you more info, but in the meantime, here's a link that you can check out:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.catholic.org/prayers/confession.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.catholic.org/prayers/confessi...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!!|`|y7qNmCkMaa	Don't worry about confessing to the priest.  If you confess to Jesus he will forgive you - but it's more important to know that you are born again.  Unless you're born-again, all the Catholic work you put in all your life will not mean a thing.  Think about it...why did Jesus die anyway and raise himself from the dead?  To free you and forgive you of your sins, to give you new life.  If you trust in Him you are already forgiven, friend.  Check out my web page on this topic that has Scriptural evidence for what I am saying....

And it usually has a good resolution.  It's a good outlet for emotions that can help people as we all face death in our lives.  And there are bad ghosts that add a twist and thrill to the show.  <br>  <br>  Often at the beginning of the show the ghost appears very scary or violent.  There are exceptional episodes where they make the storyline very good all the way through, like the airplane crash episode that had a great twist ending.   <br>  <br>  BUT, this season they ruined the show.  It is more of a soap opera focusing on romance between Melinda and her husbands ghost than what I describe.  It's so dumb now I don't know if I can tune in to watch it anymore.  Rumors have been surfacing that there is going to be more on this romance, the rumor is that a baby is coming....that would be okay if they got rid of the husband living on as a ghost in another man's body, oh brother what a joke.  It's too bad because it was such a good show before.

Very often not getting what you want puts you on a more interesting course because instead of being obsessed with what you want you end up getting things you didn't ask for and that can be more exciting, interesting and fulfilling.  The tragedy with getting what you want in non-life threatening situations is basically that you want more of the same....sex....drugs....better phone...bigger T.V....more expensive clothes........the quote is a bit too clever for it's own good because everything is relative to the needs of the individual and why they want something and what they want to do with it when they've got it.|`|B0CQi0m7aa	mm mm...very interesting...

The reason for this is that in time clauses (using while, when, before, as soon as, etc.), you do not use "will." That doesn't apply to the sixth sentence because the last three are not time clauses.<br>  <br>  While as time (during the time)<br>  Past: While I made the salad, he cooked the pasta.<br>  Present: While I make the salad, he cooks the pasta.<br>  Future: While I make the salad, he will cook the pasta. <br>  <br>  While as opposition (equivalent to whereas or on the other hand)<br>  Past: While I brought salad, he brought nothing.<br>  Present: While I bring salad to every dinner, he brings nothing.<br>  Future: While I will bring the salad, he will bring nothing. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!

It doesn't take a genius to see the pattern.<br>  <br>  Here's the history of classical antisemitism, it was fueled largely by Christianity:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://astro.temple.edu/~hfreiden/Antisemitism/timeline.htm" rel="nofollow">http://astro.temple.edu/~hfreiden/Antise...</a><br>  <br>  Want more?<br>  <br>  "The destruction of Celtic Christianity, and the horrors of the Inquisition that lasted for six hundred years, clearly illustrates just how far the Roman Catholic Church was prepared to go in order to suppress this knowledge.  This Inquisition was directed against Jews, Muslims, Gnostic Christians, and followers of Pagan Nature cults.  Acts of violence directed against the Jewish people became a highly commendable religious act.  In plague ridden medieval Strasbourg 16,000 were murdered, and in Mainz, Germany, 12,000 were burned alive.  In the south of France one million Cathar Gnostic Christians were massacred.  Pope Innocent III declared "Kill them all, God knows his own", and as a consequence most of the region was laid to waste.<br>  <br>  When Shamanism in its rawest form was confronted in the new worlds of Africa and the Americas, it was important for the Church to stamp out these cultures based upon the similar Spiritual values that the Historical Christ had come to understand.  It has recently been estimated by the University of Hawaii's Anthropology Dept. that up to 250 million Ameri-Indians and Polynesians, equal to the population of Europe at that time, lost their lives through slaughter and disease due to "Civilization" and the Church's "Good News" being spread to the New World."<br>  <br>   Not to mention the millions of Africans who died as a result of Church sanctioned slavery.<br>  <br>  As recently as the late 1800's to the beginning of the 20th Century, over half of the population of the Belgian Congo were killed by the brutal imperialism of Belgium's King Leopold II.  Forced labor, starvation, village burning, torture and murder claimed over 11 million.

As a minor living at home, it is doubtful that you would be accepted - and certainly not without the knowledge and full consent of your parents.  Circumcision doesn't come until after the learning process ends - it is one of the very last steps - and for conversions it is done in a hospital, by a doctor, with all the necessary anaesthetics.

The Bible mentions rain in connection with this wisely arranged and dependable cycle.—Job 36:27,?28; Ec 1:7; Isa 55:10.<br>  In addition to the general words for rain, a number of Hebrew and Greek terms referring to rain have the various meanings “downpour; pouring rain” (1Ki 18:41; Eze 1:28), “steady rain” (Pr 27:15), “spring or early rain” and “autumn or late rain” (De 11:14; Jas 5:7), “gentle rain” (De 32:2), “rainstorm” (Isa 4:6), and “copious showers” (Ps 65:10).<br>  At an early point in the history of the preparation of the earth, “God had not made it rain upon the earth,” but “a mist would go up from the earth and it watered the entire surface of the ground.” The time referred to is evidently early on the third creative “day,” before vegetation appeared. (Ge 2:5,?6; 1:9-13; see MIST.) The first instance in the Biblical record when rain is specifically mentioned as falling is in the account of the Flood. Then “the floodgates of the heavens were opened,” and “the downpour upon the earth went on for forty days and forty nights.”—Ge 7:11,?12; 8:2.<br>  Formation. Among the questions that Jehovah put to Job, emphasizing man’s limited understanding of the forces and laws of creation and the earth, was: “Does there exist a father for the rain?” (Job 38:28) Though meteorologists have studied extensively the formation of rain, what have emerged are, as The World Book Encyclopedia says, “theories.” (1987, Vol. 16, pp. 123, 124) As warm air containing water vapor rises and cools, moisture condenses into tiny water droplets. One theory holds that as the larger droplets fall through a cloud, they collide with smaller droplets and combine with them, until they become too heavy for the air to support. Another theory proposes that ice crystals form in cloud tops where the temperature is below the freezing point and change to rain as they fall through warmer air.<br>  Jehovah as a Source. Jehovah was no mere “rain god” for Israel. He was not like Baal, whom the Canaanites thought brought the rainy season with his awakening to life. Faithful Israelites recognized that Jehovah, not Baal, could withhold the precious rain. This was clearly illustrated when Jehovah brought a drought in Israel when Baal worship there was at its peak, in the time of the prophet Elijah.—1Ki 17:1,?7; Jas 5:17,?18.<br>  It is Jehovah who prepared rain for the earth. (Ps 147:8; Isa 30:23) He “has divided a channel for the flood,” perhaps referring to the way in which God causes clouds to channel rain down over certain parts of the globe. (Job 38:25-27; compare Ps 135:7; Jer 10:13.) His ability to control rain in harmony with his purpose is one of the things that distinguished Jehovah from the lifeless idol gods worshiped by the nations surrounding Israel. (Jer 14:22) In the Promised Land the Israelites had even more reason to appreciate that than when they were in Egypt, where rain was very infrequent.—De 11:10,?11.<br>  In preaching to the Greeks in Lystra, Paul and Barnabas explained that the rains served as a witness about “the living God” and a demonstration of his goodness. (Ac 14:14-17) The benefits of rain are felt not just by the good and righteous but by all people; so, Jesus pointed out, God’s love in this regard should serve as a pattern for humans.—Mt 5:43-48.<br>  Rainfall in the Promised Land. A distinct feature of the climate of the Promised Land is its variety as to rainfall. Two chief factors determining the amount of rain are proximity to the sea and the land’s elevation. The plains along the Mediterranean receive considerable rain during the rainy season, with the amount decreasing as one goes from N to S. The rainfall tends to be greater in the hills and mountains because the moisture carried eastward from the sea condenses more heavily there. The Jordan Valley lies in a “rain shadow,” for the air traveling over the mountains has by then given up much of its moisture, and the air is warmed as it moves into the valley. Yet, when this air meets the elevated plateau E of the Jordan, clouds again form, resulting in some rainfall. This makes a strip of land E of the Jordan suitable for grazing or limited agriculture. Farther E is the desert, where the rain is too light and irregular to be useful for raising crops or for grazing herds.<br>  Seasons. The two primary seasons in the Promised Land, summer and winter, can rather accurately be viewed as the dry season and the rainy season. (Compare Ps 32:4; Ca 2:11, ftn.) From about mid-April to mid-October very little rain falls. Rain is rare in this period during which the harvest takes place. Proverbs 26:1 shows that rain at harvesttime was considered quite out of place. (Compare 1Sa 12:17-19.) During the rainy season the rain is not constant; it alternates with clear days.

s1zitZMOaa	If you are interested in Celtic Paganism then you will do best to look at the many resources available from Celtic Reconstructionist organizations and groups. Celtic Recon may not be what you are interested in but you'll find that the people who have dedicated themselves to following scholarly sources are far better sources of information than those who slap the word "Celtic" on a book or website without any understanding of the history, culture, and practices of the people who originally worshiped those gods. <br>  <br>  Here are some good resources - <br>  <a href="http://imbas.org" rel="nofollow">http://imbas.org</a> - Celtic Recon site with many articles and links. <br>  <a href="http://paganachd.com/faq/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://paganachd.com/faq/index.html</a> - The CR FAQ - this has tons of info and a very good book list. <br>  <a href="http://www.maryjones.us/" rel="nofollow">http://www.maryjones.us/</a> - lots of articles, links, and other resources. <br>  <a href="http://www.seanet.com/~inisglas/" rel="nofollow">http://www.seanet.com/~inisglas/</a> - website of respected CR elder, Erynn Rowan Laurie. Good articles and you can download her book "A Circle of Stones" for a small fee which is nice as the book is out of print and is often quite expensive to obtain elsewhere. <br>  <a href="http://www.cyberwitch.com/wychwood/Library/whenIsACeltNotACelt.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cyberwitch.com/wychwood/Libra...</a> - I would recommend reading this essay to understand the difference between the good and the bad that exists out there with regard to sources on all things Celtic.

Learn the myths and folklore of the Celts so that you'll have a knowledge base about the cosmology, thea/ology, and philosophy that you will likely be dealing with in Celtic Paganism. Also grab copies of Margaret Adler's "Drawing Down the Moon" and books by Ronald Hutton (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Hutton)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Hutt...</a> to get you started.|`|69oZm2Saaa	you can also look for EIDAN MCCOY and DJ CONWAY books (authors) who are a couple of authors who deal mainly in the Celtic Path.

65QqZBnjaa	One flaw in you theory: What about transsexual men?  I'm going to star this question and hope some of my contacts that are trans men will let you know how they feel about being forgotten and/or dismissed.<br>  <br>  You've fallen into the same patriarchal trap of many of your predecessors.  That is to punish any show of femininity in "men".  That it is somehow an insult to you.  At the same time you seem to have no problem with transsexual men.  After all in your view (masculinity being superior) why wouldn't a woman want to be a man?  YOU FAIL TO SEE THE REAL ISSUE AT HAND!!! Identity, specifically gender identity.  Read this section of Lynn Conway's website called "Gender Basics":<br>  <br>  <a href="http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/TS/TS.html#anchor107763" rel="nofollow">http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/T...</a><br>  <br>  Gender identity is inborn and unchangeable!  People ARE born with a brain-body mismatch (transsexualism), it is a FACT.  As much as you'd like to dismiss us you can't.  Even science is now siding with us.  Not to mention the American Medical Association (see Resolution 122 they passed last year).  All evidence points to what transsexual people have said all along: We are born this way!<br>  <br>  And how simplistic can your get.  You're also using the old body parts absolutists arguments.  If you had an accident and lost your penis, would you no longer be a man?  If a women has a hysterectomy is she no longer a woman?  Of course not!  What makes us all who we are is our minds and our gender identity resides there.  Everyone has a gender identity. And for 98% of people their gender identity matches the body they were born into.  But that's not the case for many intersex people and transsexual people.  Or as a preacher I heard speak say:<br>  <br>  "God isn't interested in body parts, but what's in your heart"<br>  <br>  My heart tell me I'm female.<br>  <br>  <br>  Got a challenge for you:<br>  <br>  Without pointing to your body or your birth certificate how do you KNOW that you're a man?  If you're honest most likely the answer is "I just know".  Well it's the same for us.... we just know.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  edit: Roger I couldn't respond to your e-mail, Yahoo said the account is closed?  You finished up your e-mail saying:<br>  <br>  "This is prob why i find it hard to understand how someone says they are something they weren't born as."<br>  <br>  That's the rub ^  I wasn't born a standard issue "male".  Like Falcon said, and I believe as well, we are actually intersexed.  Or as a friend of mine likes to say "Neurologically intersexed".  Translation: Female brain in a male body.  THAT'S what I was born as, a transsexual female.  I have now transitioned and now my body matches my brain.  I feel comfortable in my own skin and in the gender role I now live in society as.  I also believe that now that my birth condition (transsexualism) has been fixed, I am no longer transsexual (no longer have a brain-body mismatch).  For the first time since I was a small child I feel happy and whole.  Something you have always taken for granted.|`|W11nQzVPaa	Number one you are insulting us~<br>  Number two. you are incorrect as there is plenty of biological proof now available to support our truths.<br>  Number three. you need to educate yourself before making unsubstantiated claims which do harm to innocent people. This amounts to nothing more than hate mongering.<br>  Grow up you are the only little boy here!<br>  Sharon|`|ITMOmE5Caa	Radgal and Fire Falcon, if I was level 2 on this site, I'd give you both all of the thumbs up I could. The original poster should take into account this is Yahoo Answers. It's on the internet so obviously there will be people out there who want to blur the truth.<br>  <br>  I can only hope that the person who asked the question understands you, Radgal and Fire Falcon. Being a transsexual woman, I've always felt like a girl from the start. NOW, that is NOT to say that some transsexual women are never more masculine than feminine; Just like how some heterosexual men are more feminine than masculine. The spectrum is very wide and has many gray areas. Sometimes, I would think, someone might not fall into that spectrum. I've never had a feeling that I lacked my masculinity. Practically, I never want to be considered masculine, but then again, that's just me.<br>  <br>  People who aren't born like this can't fully understand us. Even psychiatrists who specialize in gender disorders who are born as heterosexuals can't fully understand us. It's hard for practically anyone to try and put themselves in someone else's shoes and try to understand that other person completely. But then that is when we communicate. I'm just glad the original poster is very polite and exact with his wording.|`|vDG0iA8laa	If pre-op I, as a transvestite /crossdresser would say no, but they deserve respect, as they are in transition, but once post-op, and all has been completed obviously, then I would say yes, and again all the respect that ALL women deserve has to be shown to them / her.<br>  It doesn't take too, too much to be nice..<br>  And quite truthfully, I'm sure you will, or have found them all to be very courteous, and pleasant...

Men in traditionalist culture especially have this psychosis that showing any femininity is worse than death. It's because they believe that women are inferior other than being sex toys and who would want to actually emulate that?! Basically they don't really respect women much and the women who are attracted to them mirror the same belief and that sympathy gets amplified as hatred when trans women are involved.<br>  <br>  The other major prejudice that I encounter are from Christians who's hatred or arrogance develop into attacks, proclamations of 'sin', or insulting conversations towards me. Is it any wonder that I embrace atheism? There is a small clique of them at work that I have to be around everyday. How fun is that?!<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  This whole "pre-op" "post-op" argument I see coming up here I find ridiculous, arrogant, and prejudiced! There is an older thinking mentality of trans people who believe that only post-op matters. That's total BS and all my trans friends would agree entirely! The whole crux of the matter is how that person's mind is wired and which gender they are living as PERIOD! How cruel is it to say to a trans person that "you're not real like me cuz you haven't had SRS yet"! Some trans people for various reasons (health, financial, age, etc) can't or won't get SRS and there is no way in hell that I'm going to judge any of my trans friends that way based on their misfortunes or whatever!|`|4ab8439e5bb68131be2c8b6ff9ed3557aa	The short answer? Yes, transsexual women are REALLY women, just as transsexual men are REALLY men.<br>  <br>  You see, it's all about the brain-- not the lower bits. It has been proven that there are certain parts of the brain and all that that different between males and females, which is where the term gender comes into play... 'Sex' is one's anatomy. 'Gender' is one's brain wiring and sense of identity. Science currently suggests that there is a hormonal imbalance in the womb that causes the brain to wire itself as one sex, but the body is still born as something different. Thus, you have male brains stuck in female bodies, or female brains stuck in male bodies.<br>  <br>  Basically, being transsexual is a birth defect... which is why most transsexuals are not happy until they start presenting as their true gender, usually involving hormones, surgery, etc. It's about making the outsides match the inside, because being in a body that isn't what it should be is terrifying, horrible and disgusting.<br>  <br>  So transwomen don't have ovaries or a womb. What about women that get their ovaries and womb removed? Are they suddenly men because they had body parts removed? No, because they still identify as women, and that is what matters.<br>  <br>  Saying that transwomen "are simply men" with social issues completely strips them of their gender identity and places them in the 'delusional' category. Transwomen are women; transmen are men... Saying they're not because they don't have the right bits and are just poorly socialized folks who aren't getting any says more about yourself than it does about transpeople. It makes the assumption that being a wo/man is all above what's in your pants, and what one's brain says or what one thinks doesn't matter at all. That is extremely offensive, and I hope you can see why.<br>  <br>  Transsexuality is just a version of being intersexed-- the brain wiring doesn't match the body's anatomy. Why should other intersexed people be accepted but not transsexuals...? Just because there's no outward problem? Are people only really suffering or having problems, then, if a doctor can look down our pants and say so?<br>  <br>  What a horrible thought.|`|QZvvHp3iaa	If they are transsexual, that is post-op then yes they are physically a woman. There are women out there who do not have their ovaries or are unable to conceive, does that make them less of a woman? No, of course not. Does a man with a physical deformity who wants surgery to make them like everyone else make him wrong? Does a woman with a mental disorder from birth who wants the medicine needed to make them act like everyone else make her wrong?<br>  When a man is born the wrong gender and they want to feel like everyone else, does that make them wrong?<br>  Today, you have prosthetics/implants, medicines/ancedotes to correct what has been wronged for a reason. These people exist for a reason, all of them, all of us have a purpose. Where is the line crossed when one man's mistake is valid, should be corrected and another's is not and shouldn't.|`|XkE36LDgaa	The law says gender is based upon genitals. So if a  pre-op transexual commits  a murder s/he will be sent to prison matching their gender (like if they are a man but waiting to have sex reassignment). It dosn't matter how they look. <br>  So I would say a post-op would be there new gender, legally.<br>  <br>  Legally a tsw is a man until he gets surgery to change. <br>  <br>  Personally; I think it's really how a person feels and acts more than what's in there pants but in sociaty and law; gender is by what's in your pants.|`|UbvglIS6aa	They are women.

It is a bank holiday in Northern Ireland and a public holiday in the Republic of Ireland and Montserrat. In Canada, Great Britain, Australia, the United States and New Zealand, it is widely celebrated but is not an official holiday.<br>  <br>  It became a feast day in the Roman Catholic Church due to the influence of the Waterford-born Franciscan scholar Luke Wadding in the early part of the 17th century, and is a holy day of obligation for Roman Catholics in Ireland. The feast day usually falls during Lent; if it falls on a Friday of Lent (unless it is Good Friday), the obligation to abstain from eating meat can be lifted by the local bishop. The date of the feast is occasionally, yet controversially, moved by church authorities when March 17 falls during Holy Week; this happened in 1940 when Saint Patrick's Day was observed on April 3 in order to avoid it coinciding with Palm Sunday, and happened again in 2008, having been observed on 15 March.|`|NPmVwmxbaa	This history of St. Patrick's Day may answer some of your questions.|`|K2SOMH6iaa	they invented it so they could make money money money money money. just a pathetic attempt to sell people sh*t they don't need.|`|aiyQsqnFaa	Red is a bit cynical ..<br>  <br>  but I think it is a time (no more than x-mas) to celebrate and have fun.

It is not the last thing He will do, for His resurrection ushered in the End times.  These will last from His resuurection to His second comming, with the distruciton of the earth and the general judgement.  this will be the last thing God does on earth, and it is the epoch He has shosen us to be born into.  we are fortunate because we have the fullness of the faith, he has revield all he intends to reveal to us.

AcLjARwyaa	Jesus Came to found the kingdom of God/Heaven on earth -- the catholic church.  How do we know this, becasue this is what He did. He hand picked His first bishops, tranied them and then ordained them with the words who's sins you forgive are forgiven, who's sins you retain are retained, starting with the first Pope St. Peter to whom he gave the keys to HIS KINGDOM ON EARTH, who he ordained first and separately.  and then the remaining 10 whom he ordained using the smae words except for the keys to the kingdom part, after his resurrection.<br>  The new testament is the story of His founding and early formation of the catholic church.<br>  We worte it.<br>  In foudning this great vehicle for our slavtion -- the catholi church -- this narrow gate, he offened the jews his chosen people, because they did not want to lose thir popwer which is why he came to found his church in the first place, they his chosen people as illustrated in the old testament were not getting it, so Jesus had to come and stablish his church his kingdom himslef.  for this he was crucified that is he died in order to save us from our sins.<br>  <br>  All of this is illustrated in the parable of the vineyard the vine owner who is the father build sa vineyard and rents it to his shosen people the jews.  They get off track in keeping it up failing to realize they are doing it for the owner the fahter.  The owner the father sends them prophets/helpers, who the chosen pe0ople the tenants in the story kill, finally the vine owner sends his son who they also kill bu they cannot so, through the son the father opens up the vineyard to all the vineyard is the church etc. <br>  This is not difficult  to understand unles one is blinded by the devil.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus!

Gay marriage killed off the dinosaurs.  It's a proven scientific fact.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Twelve reasons gay marriage is wrong:<br>  <br>  1) Being gay is not natural. Real Americans always reject unnatural things like eyeglasses, polyester, and air conditioning. Also apparently those homosexual animals have picked up some unnatural behavior.<br>  <br>  2) Gay marriage will encourage people to be gay, in the same way that hanging around tall people will make you tall.<br>  <br>  3) Gay marriage will change the foundation of society; we could never adapt to new social norms. Just like we haven't adapted to cars, the service-sector economy, or longer life spans.<br>  <br>  4) Straight marriage has been around a long time and hasn't changed at all; women are still property, blacks still can't marry whites, and divorce is still illegal.<br>  <br>  5) Straight marriage will be less meaningful if gay marriage were allowed; the sanctity of Britney Spears' 55-hour just-for-fun marriage would be destroyed.<br>  <br>  6) Straight marriages are valid because they produce children. Gay couples, infertile couples, and old people shouldn't be allowed to marry because our orphanages aren't full yet, and the world needs more children.<br>  <br>  7) Obviously gay parents will raise gay children, since straight parents only raise straight children.<br>  <br>  8) Gay marriage is not supported by religion. In a theocracy like ours, the values of one religion are imposed on the entire country. That's why we have only one religion in America.<br>  <br>  9) Children can never succeed without a male and a female role model at home. That's why we as a society expressly forbid single parents to raise children.<br>  <br>  10) Legalizing gay marriage will open the door to all kinds of crazy behavior. People may even wish to marry their pets because a dog has legal standing and can sign a marriage contract.<br>  <br>  11) Gay marriage should be decided by the people, not the courts, because the majority-elected legislatures, not courts, have historically protected the rights of minorities.<br>  <br>  12) Civil Unions, providing most of the same benefits as marriage with a different name are better, because a "separate but equal" institution is always constitutional. Separate schools for African-Americans worked just as well as separate marriages for gays and lesbians will.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT @ Michael.  Did you even read my answer?

For example, a Catholic hospital in Massachusetts was told by the courts that it could not deny sex change operations, even if it when against the beliefs of the parent organization, the Catholic Church.   <br>  <br>  Rights for some impose upon the rights of others.  It goes both ways.  Many against same sex marriage are saying keep things the way they are, so as to minimize reverse discrimination the other way, and just call the term something else, like "civil unions."<br>  <br>  That way, rights can be fair for all.  Just call it something else.|`|T497f0iwaa	People can do what they want...<br>  <br>  However, in this case, they gay-rights movement is asking the state to issue "marriage" licenses to couples of the same gender.   <br>  <br>  I am opposed to this -- I do not want gay and lesbian couples to receive "marriage" licenses from the state.  I think it's better if an alternative structure is created, using a term such as "Civil Union" or "Domestic Partnership"  and providing equal protections.  <br>  <br>  As a woman, I feel that "marriage" has a very special meaning in our culture.  It is something that men and women do together.  I am socially conservative -- I do not want gender to be taken out of the idea of marriage. <br>  <br>  "Marriage will be ruined" because it will just be about two arbitrary "spouses" -- who cares whether they're men or women.   That's a huge cultural change.<br>  <br>  I am not telling gay people how to live.  They can get married in their own churches.  But I do think it is wrong for gay people to ask for "marriage" licenses from the state.  Marriage already means something very particular.<br>  <br>  I am actually a feminist and I have always supported gay rights.  But I think, in this case, the gay-rights movement has gone too far and is being extremely disrespectful of women.

NO ONE is seeking to stop that.  You <and others> misunderstand.<br>  <br>  If Gay Marriage is deemed legal, then religious institutions/churches, foundations, agencies will be legally BOUND to no longer exclude homosexuals from every and any part of their specific perameters. A church that formerly was not legally bound to marry a gay couple would be FORCED to do so.  A Catholic Adoption Agency that formerly was shielded from it - would then be legally BOUND to accept gay couples applications for adoptions.  One on the east coast has had to shut it doors because of this exact thing.  <br>  <br>  THIS Is really the crux of the issue with religious people and churches. Where once they/we had the Religious Freedom to not only believe what we wished, but to apply those beliefs directly in the area of homosexuals - if Gay marriages were made legal - all such organizations would no longer have that 'freedom'.....    <br>  <br>  EVEN as I answer this question I must admit that I find it hard to find the right words and wording and not sound judgemental and bigoted too....  SO don't automatically give me a thumbs down because you don't like what I SAY - because it is truly what lies behind those who oppose PROP 8 or gay marriage.  <br>  <br>  Personally I understand to a certain extent,  the Equal Rights perspective from Gay people, but as a Christian who also believes homosexuality is not moral or right in the eyes of God, I also see a different perspective, even while admitting it certainly seems, feels, appears and comes across as very "UNCHRISTIAN" to take this stance in many ways too.....

jcK6EXpiaa	Salam! A muslim to muslim greeting is "Asalamu alakuum" but its reserved for just muslims, its a way to identify ourselves sort of...and you'll hear Muslims respond to this greeting with "walakuum alsalam" this too, is a muslim to muslim response. You can respond with "walakuum" though. IT all pretty much means the same thing, Just remember Salam! is when you are initiating the greeting, "walakum" is when you are responding. It means "peace"<br>  <br>  Inshallah means "god willing" and its used when talking about something futeristic, like if I were to say "I am going to buy that pair of boots tomorrow, inshallah" because it isn't certain that I will be alive tomorrow, or that the boots will be there, or that I will have the money, etc...its all up to god. Or if I say "the baby will be born in December, Inshallah" see what i mean? <br>  <br>  Mashallah is used when complementing something, or when used with surprise, like saying "your baby has beautiful hair, mashallah" or "mashallah, you did great on your math exams!" its giving credit to god, as well as ensuring you don't envy the thing you're complimenting. There is superstition that if a person doesn't use this term after giving a complement or otherweise in its usual usage, something bad will happen to the person they are talking to or about. A woman from the mosque I sometimes go to blamed herself for my daughters respritory infection, she claimed that she forgot to say mashallah while admiring my daughters beauty and nose.|`|oq6PD1gRaa	Ben and the girl above me said it right<br>  so if i come to you and say "asalam alaikum" you say "wa'alaikum al-salam"<br>  <br>  If you want to compliment my dress you say for instant "masha'llah what a pretty dress" or simply "wow nice dress" hehe<br>  or "mashallah your so pretty"<br>  <br>  if you want to say  good bye you can say it in arabic by using the word "ma'a salama"<br>  In Iraq we use the term "fe aman allah" also to say may god protect you<br>  any other Q .. you may ask me :)|`|zdSRsySNaa	Assalam Alaicum is the usual one. The response is Walaicum Salam. The English spellings vary because it's transliterated from the Arabic alphabet.

It's not a greeting as such but it is a useful expression to have in your vocabulary.<br>  <br>  Allahuh akhbar means "God is greatest", but you want to use it with caution because it's a phrase made infamous by terrorists who use it as the last thing they utter.|`|tG5ODas6aa	my dad is muslim and my mum is christian <br>  but i live with my dad now and he always uses arabic around his mates and his new wife<br>  i think the first one you said is right<br>  the "wark salem"<br>  you should ask your mum what it is she says and then you can say it aswell.

AA11247648	I am a lesbian with a partner and a son. My son is 7 now and my partner and i have been together around 5 yrs (weNt through very confused straight patch when younger lol) phew. I have often wondered the effect it will have on him, but i honestly can say he's one happy little boy. Parenting obviously isn't just about male and female parents, my son has three uncles for role models. <br>  Having children is a great thing that needs lots of careful planning and attention, if i could go back n change things i would, i don't mean my child. I would be hesitant to start a family now unless i was certain of the other parent and their capabilities, thrust worthiness and reliability after all deciding to have a child with this other couple may seem like a good idea but its one that needs lots of care and attention and realistic expectations. What do you expect from them and vice versa, how will the care of the child be split and what are their parenting skills and views, do they match yours? etc. I t is not a decision to make lightly or one that you want to regret.<br>  My son understands the situation and accepts that i am a gay woman but it doesnt stop him asking me when im gonna get married to a nice man lol.

MtgiB1P2aa	OK, I don't know which parallel you are trying to touch on. <br>  The Bible = The tower of Babel?  That would indicate the it was a human construct to reach and destroy God. <br>  The Bible = God trying to confuse the human collective?  As he did with the tongues?  Then it is the story of the Tower of Babel. <br>  <br>  OK, the reason their are so many religions is Pride. Human Pride. We want the knowledge, the truth, but we also feel a superiority when achieving 'knowledge' ... knowledge is power. Pride also stops from questioning and checking if in fact we have the whole story, and not just suppositions and speculations. Therefor I agree with Socrates: True knowledge is awareness that you know NOTHING!<br>  When we can do this, then we can be close to God.

It's not like I've ever been around Methodists and heard them trash talk Presbyterians.<br>  <br>  The tower of Babel, on the other hand, was built because mankind had realized how good it is to get along and learn from each other, and so built a massive building to shelter everyone. It was clearly the beginning of a Golden Age, which infuriated God because He wasn't a part of it. In a fit of jealous rage, God confused everyone so they'd have to rely on God instead of each other.<br>  <br>  I see what you're going for, I just don't think there's really all much in common.

FcZU29W6aa	I had noticed that portions were getting bigger and bigger.  I have heard that 7-Up got its name from the fact that it contained 7 ounces.  <br>  <br>  However, lately, I have noticed portions getting smaller and the price staying the same.  My husband and I just went out this weekend to a "chain" restaurant that is not an inexpensive one.  I won't say the name because I know that is against the rules.  The food was delicious but we noticed the portions were smaller and they had changed plate sizes.  They used to have oval shaped plates, now they are round and smaller.  The food was still delicious but I realized I had gotten used to having enough for a 2nd meal at home.  This time, we had about 1/3 of the meal leftover.<br>  <br>  Also, I love tuna sandwiches and always got 2 sandwiches from a can of tuna.  Lately, that 2nd sandwich barely has enough tuna.  Sure enough, when I checked the can, it contained 5.5 ounces.  Used to be 7 ounces, then went to 6.5 ounces, and now it is the 5.5 ounces.  The price, however, has stayed the same.|`|Dmaahsc3aa	I have seen it both ways. . . Packaged food from the grocers now hold less ounces and the cost may have risen.  In restaurants the portions have gotten smaller due to theit costs (according to my daughter the waitress) but prices are the same.  Fast food places still offer some super sized portions because people have become used to them, and their prices are still the same.  I eat out once a week with a friend, but I still watch my diet, and almost always bring half home and have it for my evening meal too.|`|IWyrJ7o3aa	You are so right, They Wonder why Americans and others as far as that goes are obese. Every where you go there are buffets and do you want to super size that. We think more for our money, but think of what is doing to our health and our kids health. Great question.|`|KWwW7N49aa	Yeas!  Especially at the Cheesecake Factory. I don't frequent that place much because of the amount of food.  If you eat around the lunch hour while out, you can get half-portions.|`|UBxKqdPwaa	I always get a carry out box and eat another full meal the next day.  Two meals for the price of one!|`|ur3vgbXoaa	I used to collect restaurant plates <br>  from the old days.  The plate lunch that <br>  was served to people then was <br>  almost as small as our 'bread and butter' <br>  plates are now.  <br>  <br>  And guess what...after having a <br>  plate lunch, a dessert and a cup of <br>  coffee, people actually walked <br>  away FULL!   And stayed full <br>  till dinner time!<br>  <br>  Now it would take four of those <br>  plates to hold what we manage <br>  to cram down our throats till we <br>  can get to the candy machine <br>  or the bakery for our "snack!"  <br>  <br>  No wonder we are unpleasingly plump!|`|59Wg2cI3aa	Gotten to the point that the wife and I usually share a meal when we're dining out. Servings aren't only larger, the foods are definitely "fat" producing medicines. No wonder we're so fat dumb and unhealthy as a nation.|`|AA11017231	No, I haven't noticed that but I have noticed the more expensive a place is, the smaller the portions. Maybe with the economy you're just eating cheaper.|`|80lWqRFiaa	Not around here, when we went to the Dairy Queen last week and had hamburger baskets there were about 12 fries. Half of what we used to get, and the price went up.|`|656ecdfa98d1926ff83b40b2168d2b94aa	Yes your are right portions are getting bigger..<br>  Eating out is a nightmare you get bombarded with huge plates of food..<br>  No wonder most of us struggle with our weight..|`|MGOFjVnVaa	watch " supersize me ".|`|xL6zc0bOaa	Aye I hear Joyce's claes, dinna fit her ony mair<br>  shame in'it she'l hav go on a diet.|`|b3h0ovgRaa	No Blu, we are all just shrinking.

We all know their ain't no sugar on this aisle,|`|dNLs6GA5aa	No, I've noticed them getting smaller. I like to eat at the all you can eat buffets. A flat charge for everything but no doggie bag.<br>  <br>  I can put down 3 to 4 full plates of food. Yum.|`|AA11104093	No, the sizes are staying the same. You are just getting smaller. This gives the illusion that the sizes are getting bigger!!|`|zEoRcL91aa	Oh yes - in my old class photo, all the kids were really thin and now, it seems as if the majority of teenagers are porky!|`|lECmz3SEaa	have you noticed the fast food chains stop offering supersize|`|bc087fc5c848c231a493eee2e0caecf8aa	yes,its so distressing!i was at the movies recently.i wanted a 6 or 8 oz. frozen coke,so i ordered "small."what i got was a 20 oz. cup.i told the girl at the counter she had given me a large.she looked at me like i was insane."that is small",she informed me.medium was 32 oz.large was 64.no wonder americans are having weight problems!how many of us can take the 20 oz small,and have the willpower to stop after a third of it is gone?how many can throw out the rest,without the nagging feeling u are 'throwing away money"?we were taught not to waste-if u order it,u eat it !thats a difficult ,lifelong habit to break,another middle aged lady and myself tried to buy the childrens portion,but they refused,as we were not children!so,we went to another line and said"we need a childs portion of frozen coke for our grandkids'-and they sold it to us with a smile.THATS|`|ZPmqYNuwaa	They are definately getting bigger!  Servings are also bigger in the US then Canada.  A medium coffee up here is classed as a small coffee across the boarder, pretty crazy!
WwCBomTMaa	Cinnamon..........just ignore her. You are a Christian, and perhaps one of the more real Christians. You don't deny who you are and yet you follow Jesus with your heart. I saw the original question that started this whole thing. First of all (from another Christian standpoint) I thought it was hilarious. Second of all there are some people that would rather criticize others than take into consideration their own actions. She is one of those. Just be true to yourself and to Jesus, and try to ignore the slander from folks like this.<br>  <br>  By the way: I liked your avatar. Why did you change it??  :)<br>  <br>  Have a good day hun :)|`|tO9QjrEkaa	Xtians have devised a new theory of salvation. It's called "state of grace", or what I like to call, "sin now-pray later". They believe that they can keep sinning and still go to magical heaven just because they paid lip service to their god.|`|4mSpN3Rxaa	you are a child of God. everyone is. people are not perfect. look up to God, not people, they will always let you down and confuse you. the devil is the author of confusion.|`|AA11989999	You get to be a child of God just by being born, according to Jesus.

You'll save yourself some IQ that way.|`|AJr98ZReaa	shes a hypocritical *****, and you look fine.|`|Cgz1n3xNaa	Trust me hon, there's tons of hypocritical women out there. Christian or not. <br>  <br>  Some women just get their security out of judging other women and trashing them in their own minds. <br>  <br>  I've been called many derogatory names just because of a frickin avatar. But I know it's not true. So long as you know it's not true then why worry about it. :)|`|PeI5rpK1aa	It seems a little odd doesn't it. That you comment on the question you linked to saying how judgemental she is, and then waste 5 points making sure EVERYBODY knows what you think of this person because you feel the need to make light of this womans hypocrisy. A little pathetic isn't it? But then again, now aren't I being the judgmental one?|`|N58YMuuxaa	was it really necessary though you make a big deal out of this?  that not christian like either, maybe she did wrong but you looking for people to pat you and the back and call her hypocrite now? you had already won this debate but you not acting like a christian by going at it this way.|`|Pf4wlWZAaa	we are not to judge.All of us are God's children.It's just that some have been redeemed and others haven't.Only you and God know for sure.|`|UOIcXs7Haa	She also seems very shallow, what are looks and a perfect body when you have all the personality of a stick.|`|uK3tkaOJaa	I think if I clicked that, then I'd be judging her about whether or not she was judging you and then...?|`|D9lMg7A2aa	She isn't a Christian she is actually an impersonator and you are playing right into it, doing her dirty work...and it was ego that made you fall. Seh could give a hang about you.|`|k7FD3rt5aa	Hmmmmmm, a little hypocritical on her part.|`|6173ede5e3ea0a8b44522ccd89de7fe0aa	Although I think your picture is a little too "sexual" for a Christian, I do agree that her statements aren't much better, which does not put her in a position to judge. A Christian should also not be asking about "great boobs" or a person's looks.|`|e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	It's probably just jealousy.<br>  <br>  Since Jesus said not to judge other people, and she is doing what He said not to do, what does that tell you about her?<br>  <br>  She probably has a lot more problems and heartaches than you.  Be understanding with her.|`|PKULDaC7aa	Christians are so cool aren't they?|`|JxUFDutxaa	As a Christian..she doesn't speak for the rest of us.<br>  She needs to take the plank out of her own eye..
xnsU60hhaa	Yes, it is acceptable to get up and leave when you need to. You are an adult now and don't have to ask permission. And you are PAYING for the classes and the teacher's salary. I had to occasionally leave class to go to work. You do what you have to do, it is your education.|`|AA11280073	Yes.|`|TDfOl6kdaa	The people you see leaving are leaving for a variety of reasons, including a lack of interest in the class. Unless your instructor has said otherwise, I'd say it's more than okay to go to the bathroom without asking.|`|01kEv36Faa	Yeah, dont make a big deal about it.  Try to do it when the teachers not talking.  But if you have to go just go.|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	yes it's not high school you don't have to ask anymore|`|UOIcXs7Haa	Yep.|`|ptDkPkd8aa	Don't worry that was me too, unless the professor actually specifies that you CAN'T leave the room during lecture, you can just get up and leave, and trust me they won't even acknowledge you left, he or she just keeps talking. Now I go to the bathroom and leave early if the lecture is boring lol.|`|tZtlINbxaa	Yes, you can leave for any reason.  They will figure it out if you are gone for only a few minutes.  If it is a small, interactive class, say "excuse me," as you slip out the door--they can figure out where you're headed.  In a large lecture hall, just get up and go.  Excuse yourself if you have to trip all over people to get out of there, and choose an aisle seat if you have overactive bladder issues.|`|1nL6p8zMaa	The college I went to, yes we could leave without asking for whatever reason.  If you're worried that it might not be OK or might offend the teacher, Just ask them how they prefer you handle such situations.  Ask if you should just leave as quietly as possible or should you interrupt the class to excuse yourself. I think probably interruptions would be less appreciated.  Don't you?|`|6ba027a4abc0f6c1a9a10d1e0bb27c9daa	well yeah.  because you are in college, you are expected to be a responsible adult.  if you need to leave, then you need to leave, but you're still expected to be responsible for the material covered in class.  just make sure you don't disrupt the class in any way when you leave.|`|e0faada9a8147280b25584d40c598fb3aa	yes you csn. you can even leave the class for the day if u wanted to

65QqZBnjaa	Did you change your avatar?<br>  <br>  <br>  Anywho, speaking from the transsexual woman's perspective:<br>  <br>  YES we can have sex and orgasms.<br>  <br>  NO the technology to give us a uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes doesn't exist....... yet.  Maybe in about 20 years.<br>  <br>  In case you're wondering the cosmetic results are also generally excellent these days.

It is NOT body modification.|`|VCz1CtiLaa	I don't think they get the organs, such as a uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes.  I'm pretty sure they just have surgical construction to make a vagina, but they cannot reproduce.|`|4ab8439e5bb68131be2c8b6ff9ed3557aa	First of all, if you're getting a "sex change" involving male bits... you're not female. People who really are females wouldn't go through the trouble of getting a phalloplasty. And vise versa. :P<br>  <br>  Rule of thumb-- if someone is presenting as male, call them men (he); if someone is presenting as female, call them female (she).<br>  <br>  When FtMs get lower surgery, sometimes they do get a penis and a scrotum. Sometimes not-- oftentimes, a transman will just get the clitoris modified to form what looks like a smaller penis. But to be honest, FtM lower surgery SUCKS right now... The results aren't nearly as good as MtF lower surgery. The penis doesn't function like it normally would without help (usually implant things that can make an erection) and sometimes there is a completely loss of sensation. There's also scarring on the arms or legs, if the guy decides to get a phalloplasty.<br>  <br>  MtFs are a bit more fortunate. The new vagina tends to be fully functional, capable of normal sex and orgasm. <br>  <br>  But like FtMs, it's not perfect and reproduction (having kids) isn't possible at the moment. Males don't have fully functioning testicles, women don't have a womb, ovaries or fallopian tubes. Hopefully in the future such things will be possible, but right now there's just not enough research being done to help speed things up and make surgeries better.|`|MYIwyTpcaa	I'm pretty sure they can plastic surgery everything but the reproductive organs..so once she was done, she would have a penis and scrotum, but no natural testicles, although there are prostheses for this.<br>  <br>  Since they contruct the penis out of erectile tissue, sex and orgasm should still be possible, but no ejaculation would occur.|`|y4KXVvXkaa	theres a good movie on this out there. Its called "Modify". Its a documentary based on body modifications, such as tattooing, scarafication, plastic surgery and transgendered surgery. Its a very good film and keeps you entertained for being a documentary. It can anwser alot of your questions.
RgceFQ9Caa	The concept of a Good Friday crucifixion and a Sunday morning resurrection is a complete falsehood that has led to the deception of those who would be followers of the Christ for centuries. It is one of the traditions of men that we are warned against following. Christians should celebrate Passover as did our Savior.<br>  <br>  The truth is that the resurrection was near the end of the weekly 7th day Sabbath (our Saturday) exactly 72 hours after He was placed in the tomb. Anyone who tells you anything else is calling Christ a liar. If it was NOT 72 hours, then He is NOT your Savior. The only sign that He gave that proves His identity is Matthew 12:40. Three days and three nights cannot possibly fit into Friday evening to before sunrise Sunday. You cannot even count, if you believe in a Friday crucifixion, Sunday as a day because the scriptures say He was already risen BEFORE the women got to the tomb and that it was still dark.<br>  <br>  Several links where you can study the truth for yourself:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tomorrowsworld.org/cgi-bin/tw..." rel="nofollow">http://www.tomorrowsworld.org/cgi-bin/tw...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ucg.org/booklets/JC/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ucg.org/booklets/JC/</a><br>  <br>  To truly understand what went on during the week of the crucifixion, you need to study the Biblical Holy Days:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://media.pcog.org/en/Literature/PAG_..." rel="nofollow">http://media.pcog.org/en/Literature/PAG_...</a><br>  <br>  To give you a basic overview, because you really need to study this vital truth for yourself, in the Bible, the days start and end at sunset:<br>  <br>  Crucifixion week:<br>  <br>  Our Tuesday evening (Sunset started the 14th day of Exodus 10-12) Yeshua ate the Passover with His disciples and instituted the bread and wine ceremony as a memorial to His death. That night He was betrayed, arrested, taken to the High Priest's house. The next morning (our Wednesday) very early before the morning sacrifices began at the Temple, He was taken to the Sanhedrin. Peter denied Him, most likely about the time the Temple Crier (Not a rooster) was calling for the morning sacrifices to begin. <br>  <br>  After being shuttled back and forth between Herod and Pilate, He is finally condemned, tortured, and crucified and died on the cross late Wednesday afternoon and was placed in the tomb before the sunset that ended that day. This was the preparation day for the 1st High Sabbath of the year, the first day of Unleavened Bread (Again read the Exodus account and Leviticus 23).<br>  <br>  This period of time from sunrise Wednesday to sunset Wednesday is also the preparation day for the High day Sabbath mentioned in John's account.<br>  <br>  Night 1<br>  Sunset Wednesday to Sunrise Thursday. The High Day Sabbath, the first day of Unleavened Bread, or the Passover of the Jews, mentioned in John's account (19:31) began at this sunset<br>  <br>  Day1<br>  Sunrise Thursday to sunset Thursday. It is still the High day Sabbath.<br>  <br>  Night 2<br>  Sunset Thursday to sunrise Friday began the preparation day for the weekly Sabbath.<br>  <br>  Day 2<br>  Sunrise Friday to sunset Friday. This is the daytime portion of the preparation day for the weekly Sabbath, during which the disciple prepared the spices for the final burial of Yeshua.<br>  <br>  Night 3<br>  Sunset Friday to sunrise Saturday, the weekly Sabbath began at sunset Friday and the disciples rested according to the commandment.<br>  <br>  Day 3<br>  <br>  Sunrise Saturday (Sabbath)to just before sunset Saturday (Sabbath), 72 hours after being placed in the grave before the first Holy Day ends the 3rd day. <br>  <br>  This is so easily proven from the Bible that it is ridiculous that people still believe in a Good Friday/Easter Sunday scenario. Like so many other practices and beliefs of traditional Christianity, it is rooted in pagan worship of heathen gods and has no Biblical basis whatsoever.<br>  <br>  Bottom line;  Which do we love more, God and the truth or the false traditions of man?|`|3WYcPsm4aa	Sunday.<br>  The rush to get him off the cross and all things taken care of before sunset was because of the Jewish sabbath... it had to be done before sundown on Friday.  So, Friday is day 1, Saturday is day 2, and Sunday is day 3.  Jewish calendar counting is inclusive of the day it is and the day an event occurs.|`|954DYZLfaa	He raised on the sunday. The third day. The first day of the week. Which means Saturday is the seventh day, the Sabbath...|`|AA10471892	Jesus most likely arose from the grave at the time the wave sheaf offering was made, between the two evenings, ie immediately after sunset on Saturday, but before dark.  We call this twilight.<br>  <br>  And for accuracies sake, this was not "our" Saturday -- it was their Saturday.  Our Saturday occurs anywhere from 10 to 12 hours later, or 13 to 15 hours earlier, depending on which way from Israel you calculate it.<br>  <br>  Seeing as the wave sheaf offering was made after sunset, and Jesus was to be three days and three nights in the tomb, this brings us to the beginning of the first day when Jesus was resurrected; not Saturday.<br>  <br>  .|`|TyRfv0eoaa	The first day of the week would have begun at sundown on Saturday. However, the operative word in the sentence is "dawn." The Greek word indicates "lighting up." So it doesn't mean that Jesus rose on the Sabbath, but simply some time between sundown on Saturday and dawn on Sunday.|`|DiIAaFgzaa	The end of the Sabbath would be at sundown Saturday evening.  The dawn of the first day is the beginning of the day, which is at sundown.  <br>  <br>  We'll never know for sure, based on scripture alone, exactly when Jesus arose.  We can only say that at the earliest time when His followers went to visit the grave on the first day of the week, the tomb was already empty.|`|gDVQNMR7aa	That's a good question.

My husband remembers when a single light bulb was brought into the kitchen of his grandparent's farm.<br>  <br>  I went without electricity at my Mom's cabin for 2 weeks after a huge snow storm.  My little ones and I had heat from the kitchen wood burning range, and we cooked on that, too.  We kept bottled water for cooking, after just such emergencies.<br>  <br>  I was going, "guess I will vacuum.  Hmm. No.  Well, I will watch TV. No? Maybe listen to some music.  Dang,  Cant do that, either."  I ended up spending time playing with the kids, and putting together a huge jigsaw puzzle.

It really is necessary to turn off your brain and abandon logic and reason to have belief in regards to this god and religion thing.

As a Canadian I would not want the FBI's "help" in solving a crime in Canada.  It would make my pride sting to think we couldn't do it for ourselves.  And, quiet frankly, Canadians tend to be humble people.<br>  <br>  It could be that Pakistani government wants to show they are capable of doing this for themselves.<br>  <br>  Consider also what the US gov't has done in other places they have been "helping".  They still haven't left Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia or Iraq.  Perhaps Pakistan doesn't want to be the next US Army foreign base.<br>  <br>  Finally, I for one, am not particularly trustful of the FBI.  It may also be that the Pakistani government feels the same way.  Who knows if the FBI will find or fabricate evidence to further US gov't goals?<br>  <br>  International politics are interesting, but it is necessary to look at issues broadly if you want to try and understand policy.  I'm sure there are a number of other possibilities, some sinister, some clandestine, and any of which (or combination thereof) might be the true reason(s).|`|7Bj4AAo8aa	So that the FBI comes to the conclusion that RAW was not responsible for this attack?

19922ecff123841b68f933197d10192baa	Well said.<br>  <br>  Your points are 100% valid.

End of story.|`|6f0e45a91719820a0d453b3ba6acce13aa	There have always been those that turn the grace of God into a license to sin...they either have not read nor understood the letter to the Romans, where this is clearly spoken of and warned against.|`|tO9QjrEkaa	That's the "state of grace theory", or "sin now-pray later".

I mean they'll have time in purgatory to think about that mistake right? But what is really worrisome is when the same people who believe this doctrine start to say:<br>  <br>  "God hates this, God hates that, God hates your church" and "your going to Hell" i.e. presuming God's judgments, and his opinions, much less assuming God "HATES" at all -- that is where things get sticky for these "believers." I settle into a personal mix of feelings: disgust ranging to pity when I hear/read these sort of things. I actually pray every time I read that brand of blasphemy. <br>  <br>  We can't presume/assume God's judgments, but we can sure pray for people who do.

He said if we bear no fruit we will be cut off from Jesus and good for nothing but being thrown into the fire.  We do not want to be cut off from Jesus.  How on earth can one believe they are saved once and for all time then?  How do they believe that if they sin and persist in that sin because they do not accept the doctrine of penance, what ground do they stand on to keep believing that they are not one of the branches that is cut off?<br>  They do not believe one has to obey the commandments, they say they are no longer bound by the "law", but in the new testament Jesus tells us that if we love him, we will "obey" the commanments , also he rebuked the pharisees for holding on to a man made tradition of washing hands while Jesus told them but you disobey the commandment of God to honor your mother and father.  That proves right there that Jesus' commandments are not optional, they are not mere suggestions, THEY ARE COMMANMENTS, TO BE OBEYED.<br>  So I ask, what part of once saved always saved, do you still not understand as being a false belief, and a man made doctrine at that?|`|AA11719394	The problem here is that the Christians aren't the ones who came up with that story.

My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of My Father’s hand." - John 10<br>  <br>  Your actual problem is not with the Christians but with Christ, if He is who He said He was or not.

It's not surprising to me when they say "If that is Christianity, I want nothing to do with it."<br>  <br>  The problem is, as you and I know, that ISN'T Christianity.

As we discovered new things about the universe, things written in the Bible stopped making sense. However, still assuming that the Bible must be true, we decided to call it "metaphorical" or "symbolic" in order to preserve the thought system that was so invested in.<br>  <br>  It seems an odd way to communicate, symbolism. It's filled with hidden premises, some of which take great lengths to figure out. Why would God leave something so important, salvation, to metaphors? <br>  <br>  The Bible is acting just like every other holy book ever written. It is written as fact, then interpreted as metaphor as conflicting evidence shows up. It's credibility currently lies in the society propping it up, not in the actual information within it.|`|140b1c561177bc5cc3baf4ae5b15a6a8aa	Unless you take the Bible literally, how do you eevn know there is a heaven to attain?<br>  What?

It appears that you want to belive, but are lacking in the Holy Spirit in your spiritual life. <br>  Ask God before you read the Bible to give you the Holy Spirit. It is one of the roles of the Holy Spirit to give us an understanding of what we are reading. <br>  Try it.

God is not inside of a book. He is within your spirit. The bible is a start off guide for all to know who God is spiritually and what Jesus did for us. What God wants from his children, is one who is obedient to him and a personal relationship with him. <br>  If we say we love him. We won't have a problem listening and obeying his words. Just like a child who listen to their parents, when it comes to obeying. I have learned, the more you come to be a part of God life, the more he becomes a part of yours. In no time you will understand why he commands us not to do something or vice versa. But no the bible is a study guide to learn to better your life walk with God. <br>  If you read some of the things that Christians write about in here, oh you will be lost for sure. They contradicts themselves with a lot of the crap they add and subtract from the bible. They will have you in the bible for the rest of your life listening to them. <br>  All I can tell you. Read, study and let God teach you the word the way he want it to be taught. The same way he use Philip to go minister to the Eunuch.|`|I1w0HfQbaa	Yes you can. You don't have to follow ALL the passages in the Bible, just the ones you prefer. If you do not agree with a passage in the Bible or a commandment then you are NOT require to obey.

When Imam Jafar as-Sadiq was informed about Zaid ibn Ali's martyrdom, "he was very sad...and he set apart a thousand dinars of his own money for the families of those of (Zaid's) followers who were killed with him."<br>  <br>  _____<br>  <br>  Shayk Ibn Tamiyah(May Allah withhold his mercy on him) is a pure Nasibi.<br>  It is funny that you guys listen to morons like Ibn Tamiayah.<br>  <br>  you should do your reseach on him, about his evil Fatwas. He said It is perfectly fine to recite Quran in Bathroom. He said if a person doesn't belive that Allah(swt) is sitting on a throne is a Kafir. 40 sunnis scholars issued a takfeer against Ibn Tamiyah. some sunni scholars issued a Fatwa that Ibn Tamiyah is Kafir.<br>  He never performed Hajj, never got Married, Was in prison cause of his hypocrisy and evil fatwas and he died in prison.<br>  <br>  How the hell he become shaykul Islam?|`|PeHJALnkaa	Zayd ibn Ali was one of the sons of Imam Zain-al-Abideen but the tradition of Imamate was that the Oldest son of the Previous Imam will become the Imam of the time.Shia's do not reject Zayd ibn Ali we pledge him for giving his life for us to know GOD,That's a Sacrifice.A Raafidhah means a disbeliever Prophet Musa/Moses was called a Raafidhah for beliving in the oneness of God.Us Shia's are not Raafidhah no one should be called that our Imams and Prophet taught us to respect our selves and to respect all man and mankind.|`|mVSC9aKoaa	yes, shia cheated him when battle was about to start as they did to his grand father and he got martyed as his grand father god martyed. curse be upon enemies of Ahlel Bayt.|`|Bb6fQtl0aa	The reason why the Shi'a are not accepted nor reconciled with is because they have introduced beliefs and practices into Islam that were never taught by the Prophet, peace be upon him, never taught by his family, or his companions. Rather they have changed Islam from it's original perfected form and thusly, innovated a way of life that leads to Hellfire. This is not a dispute between a trivial "this" and "that", it is a serious issue dealing with the difference between the Straight Path to Paradise and the crooked paths that lead to punishment in this life and the next. May Allaah rectify our condition and affairs.<br>  <br>  With regards to Shee'ism, then it is not the Islam that was taught by Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him. Rather, they are a group that have exaggerated the status of the noble family of the Prophet, peace be upon him, to the extent that they build shrines devoted to their worship along with Allaah. This is shirk, polytheism, the greatest crime a human being can commit in the sight of Allaah.<br>  <br>  The proper way to practice Islam is to follow the understanding of the Qur'aan and the Prophetic life example that was actually taught by Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, and actually lived by the Prophet, peace be upon him, his family, and his companions.<br>  <br>  All beliefs and acts of worship that oppose this way are affairs that lead away from Paradise and lead towards Hellfire.<br>  <br>  It is not permissible to worship Allaah with acts of worship that did not exist in the time of the Prophet, peace be upon him (such as pilgrimage to Karbala, calling upon 'Ali or other human beings for help who are dead or absent, building shrines dedicated to saints, etc...) And it is not permissible to interpret the Qur'aan with meanings that oppose what the Prophet, peace be upon him, actually taught.<br>  <br>  Remember, the main goal of every Muslim is to enter Paradise and to avoid torment in the Hellfire. The main goal is not unity in this life for the sake of "unity". If the Shee'ah have chosen for themselves a path to destruction, then it is not in any Muslim's interest to "unite" with them. Rather the sincere Muslim should advise them to return to the right guidance that Allaah created us and them for, and if they refuse, then other Muslims should be warned against falling into their severe errors. By this way, with Allaah's permission, we preserve the correct practice of Islam for ourselves and for future generations who seek to worship Allaah correctly.<br>  <br>  Whether the Shia' as a whole will repent and return to the Straight Path...? Allaah knows best. This splitting amongst the Muslims is a test from Allaah to see who will sincerely and correctly follow His religion. He guides whom He wills and He leaves to stray whom He wills and Allaah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.<br>  <br>  ADDITIONAL NOTE: "Fitnah" Makers?<br>  <br>  It is oppression to call a Muslim who clarifies the difference between true Islam and deviant ideologies a "fitnah" maker. The people responsible for making "fitnah" are those who alter the pure religion of Allaah and turn it to something that leads our brothers and sisters to Hell.<br>  <br>  If I knew someone who was in danger of being murdered, would I be considered a "fitnah" maker if I were to alert that person to danger? No. I would not be considered a fitnah maker, even if the murderer was a Muslim.<br>  <br>  And innovation in religion and the threat of Hellfire is more serious a danger to a person than murder and thusly a Muslim has more right to be warned against it in the clearest terms possible.

Part of the difficulty folks have in answering this question, either way, is that doing so requires thinking outside the box of conventional argument/counter argument.  It's also necessary to keep the question of religious faith separate from the question of God's existence.  Normally, this question is addressed using what I'll call a bottom up approach.  We start out by leaving the box "God exists" unmarked and then try to justify our eventual answer through reason and observation.  But the rules governing even these are not agreed upon.  Moreover, the very definition of evidence is problematic.  What counts as evidence for me may not do so for you.  At the end of the day, our epistemological assumptions dictate our reasoning, and these assumptions are notoriously difficult, if not impossible to defend.  And this assumes we are even aware of what they are.  It appears we're stuck.  <br>  <br>  But what if we try another approach?  Instead of leaving the box blank, suppose we treat God's existence as a hypothesis and then test it?  What sort of physical universe should we expect, given the Theistic God's existence?   What are the epistemic implications?  How about morality?  Consciousness?  Exestential meaning?   Having worked these out to the best of our reasoning abilities, does the real world fit what we would expect?  Obviously, I cannot begin to answer all of these questions here.  I cannot safely assume you'd even be interested in the questions much less my answers.  But I am confident that if you seriously pursued them, you would find that reality as we know it does fit the theistic hypothesis.  That doesn't mean that there won't be any anomalies, things which are problematic-- say the existence of suffering and evil for example.  But these alone are not enough to defeat the hypothesis.  There is not a single mature scientific model that does not have this exact problem, and yet we still confidently accept them.  <br>  <br>  I realize this doesn't directly answer your question.  But I do hope it helps you find a way of arriving at a satisfactory answer on your own.  <br>  <br>  peace|`|yvDzvIbBaa	''Definition of God - An all powerful entity whom created us all.''<br>  <br>  you cant prove or disprove such a vague definition.<br>  <br>  call it the christian god yahweh/jehova or the muslim god allah. and it becomes childsplay to disprove. they are actually self refuting.<br>  <br>  just because you cant disprove the general concept of a god does not mean you can not disprove particular ones. and it does not mean that you can claim you religion to be true of the back of suck concept. <br>  <br>  i see you say ''God'' and not ''god'' or ''a god'' ... so you obviously mean a particular one.<br>  <br>  tell me what one and ill disprove it for you.<br>  <br>  ill come back to check in 10 minutes or so.|`|XuO2rTteaa	The best that I could think of is along the lines of the Boeing 747 gambit.

It has never been "lost", and is one of the most prevalent Scriptures found among the Dead Sea Scrolls.<br>  <br>  <br>  2) Why is it not a part of the Holy Bible?<br>  <br>  Because it contains obvious error.  We know (from its language) that it was written much later than many other Old Testament books, and so it cannot be authentic.  However, those who chose what Scriptures to include in the bible (synod of Hippo, council of Carthage) probably didn't realize that - but they *did* realize that it contained obvious error.

Basically, it lost by one vote.It is important to note that some books included in the bible only made the cut by one vote! You should read all of these ancient text and make your own decision regarding God. Another little known fact among Christians is that the Muslim Koran mentions the virgin Mary more than the Bible! I have read the holy books of many religions and have found that each  prophet of the major religions taught the same basic principles. They understood that we are all GOD'S children. The bible is not one piece, but a collection of writings written by different men, and assembled by different men much later on in history.<br>    The Roman Catholic, Greek Catholic, and Protestant canons, no two of which are alike, were fixed by modern councils. The Council of Trent (1645-1563) determined the Roman Catholic canon. While a majority were in favor of the canon of Augustine they were not agreed in regard to the character and classification of the books. There were four parties. The first advocated two divisions of the books, one to comprise the acknowledged books, the other the disputed books. The second party proposed three divisions-- the acknowledged books, the disputed books of the New Testament, and the Apocryphal books of the Old Testament. The third party desired the list of books to be named without determining their authority. The fourth party demanded that all the books, acknowledged, disputed, and apocryphal, be declared canonical. This party triumphed.<br>  <br>  At a council of the Greek church held in Jerusalem in 1672, this church, which had always refused to accept Revelation, finally placed it in the canon. The Greek canon contains several apocryphal books not contained in the Roman Catholic canon.<br>  <br>  Both divisions of the Protestant church, German and English, declared against the authority of the Apocryphal books. The Westminster Assembly (1647) formally adopted the list of books contained in our Authorized Version of the Bible.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	Only one verse of the book of Enoch is the Word of God, and that verse is found in the Book of Jude. <br>  <br>  Other than that, the book of Enoch is not the Word of God. <br>  <br>  Enoch was pleasing to the Lord.  That doesn't mean the Lord wanted the book of Enoch to be scripture.|`|AA11719394	The Book of Enoch is any of several pseudepigraphal (falsely attributed works, texts whose claimed authorship is unfounded) works that attribute themselves to Enoch, the great-grandfather of Noah; that is, Enoch son of Jared (Genesis 5:18). Enoch is also one of the three people in the Bible taken up to heaven while still alive (the only others being Elijah and Jesus), as the Bible says "And Enoch walked with God, and he was not; for God took him." (Genesis 5:24; see also Hebrews 11:5). Most commonly, the phrase "Book of Enoch" refers to 1 Enoch, which is wholly extant only in the Ethiopic language.<br>  <br>  The biblical book of Jude quotes from the Book of Enoch in verses 14-15, “Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied about these men: ‘See, the Lord is coming with thousands upon thousands of his holy ones to judge everyone, and to convict all the ungodly of all the ungodly acts they have done in the ungodly way, and of all the harsh words ungodly sinners have spoken against him.’” But this does not mean the Book of Enoch is inspired by God and should be in the Bible.<br>  <br>  Jude’s quote is not the only quote in the Bible from a non-biblical source. The Apostle Paul quotes Epimenides in Titus 1:12 but that does not mean we should give any additional authority to Epimenides’ writings. The same is true with Jude, verse 14. Jude quoting from the book of Enoch in Jude verse 9 does not indicate the entire book is inspired, or even true. All it means is that particular verse is true. It is interesting to note that no scholars believe the Book of Enoch to have truly been written by the Enoch in the Bible. Enoch was seven generations from Adam, prior to the Flood (Genesis 5:1-24). Evidently, though, this was genuinely something that Enoch prophesied – or the Bible would not attribute it to him, “Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied about these men…” (Jude 14). This saying of Enoch was evidently handed down by tradition, and eventually recorded in the Book of Enoch.<br>  <br>  We should treat the Book of Enoch (and the other books like it) in the same manner we do the other Apocryphal writings. Some of what the Apocrypha says is true and correct, but at the same time, much of it is false and historically inaccurate. If you read these books, you have to treat them as interesting but fallible historical documents, not as the inspired, authoritative Word of God.|`|r8rykCkGaa	Parts of his book were found but it's real sketchy and skips lots of chapters and not good for a Bible book.

He came up with the idea of Middle Earth when he told bedtime stories to his children, these stories later became the hobbit and the lord of the rings. I think Tolkien made a conscious decision that it would be a fantasy land and that he wouldn't try and connect it to reality. <br>  <br>  He did draw alot of subtle parallels though.<br>  Gandalf sacrificed himself to stop the Balrog and save the fellowship, similar to how Jesus sacrificed himself on the cross to allow salvation for humanity.Gandalf then came back from the dead in the Two Towers because his purpose was not yet fulfilled like Jesus did with the ressurection.<br>  Saruman and Sauron like Satan were both originally good but turned bad in a quest for power.<br>  Aragorn has alot of human weaknesses which he has to resist(the temptation to take the ring), just like Jesus did when he was tempted in the desert.<br>  Frodo has humble origins(the Shire) but does great things.

Of course, if you are a good worker, then it would not be wise for the company to fire you.  <br>  <br>  Companies are about money- not color, race or sexual preference.  If you are worth the money they pay you, then they will keep you.  If not, they will fire you.  It has nothing to do with any other orientation, unless you are using that orientation (or lifestyle) to disrupt the workplace.<br>  <br>  On your first question, you may not get a job in certain places and cities.  Conservative midwestern cities may look down upon gays.  I  my city (which is not conservative per se), there aren't enough outlets and things to do for members of the gay community.  So, when we do hire them, they hang around for a few months and then quit because there is such a small gay community here.  Therefore, employers in my city may not hire gays because they are confident these employees will leave after a short time.|`|W11nQzVPaa	In most states it is legal to discriminate against anyone who is gay,lesbian, bisexual, transgender, or transsexual.

Even if you are an Atheist its fine.|`|s7pqFa1eaa	I suspect that you would be admitted, but never accepted.|`|fNw4wJSGaa	I can't see why it would be a problem<br>  <br>  If it's a subject that interests you, then go for it!<br>  <br>  I enjoy studying it myself. Lots of rich history there! And it gives you an insight as to how others think. After all, Christianity has several different philosophies to study and decipher.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  Jeez people...lighten up on the amount of time the guy spent in school!<br>  <br>  I spent 7 years in college. I went to community college first because I wasn't sure what I wanted to do, and got an Associates degree, then I went on to earn a 4 year degree. Classes didn't transfer like I had hoped so I ended up in school longer than planned.<br>  <br>  This guy might have double majored, or gotten his masters.<br>  <br>  Just because he took a while doesn't mean he's dumb!|`|AA11668191	It really depends on how well you understand that it's not their job to make you a believer. In my mind, I see you taking up lots of teachers' time because you won't accept a given teaching. It would probably be annoying even if you weren't combative. On the other hand, I can imagine a scenario where your presence actually strengthens the faith of those around you, so maybe it's worth a shot.|`|IUQBvODuaa	I mean you did say that you stated your religious status, yet they were still welcoming, is there anything else you need to ask.<br>  <br>  I'm sure you're afraid of religious crazies who might throw you out. But thats why we call them crazy.|`|xelkbdbdaa	Exactly, how do you know whether or not your pastor is an atheist?|`|yH6JPjwOaa	Yes all should be welcomed but as a believer we will want you to some day give you life to Christ.|`|A068AKFzaa	I don't see why not. What is your interest in attending?
Gf5nMPJXaa	He's obviously very capable in a highly competitive field that takes a lot of effort to get the #1 job.<br>  <br>  But no not really beyond that, and obviously his blog is irrelevant to that opinion.|`|c0KKHMsAaa	pop culture idiocy at it's finest.|`|a48cfffc5a668f8ee11c890acdaf3ccfaa	Not really.  Anyone going about calling himself the representation of God on earth and his organization has an insurance policy for pedophile priests, I don't really care for.|`|XxWovDNCaa	I like pope Leo the Xth better. He said "the smallest of minds are the easiest to fill with faith" and boy, he was really onto something there wasn't he?|`|UH1ipgJmaa	I am a Christian & never liked him but I have started to like thim.<br>  <br>  Catholics are Chrisitans afterall ............|`|AA10067344	He looks like Emperor Palpatine.  No blog can change that.  Gimme JP2 over this new guy any day.|`|AA11506647	No and no.|`|5AbCtkWFaa	No, and I don't give a damn how popular his freaking blog is.  The Pope is still a jerk.  He'd rather children die of starvation and lack of clean water than have couples use contraception.  He'd rather women die of AIDS and leave children orphans than have couples use condoms.  He is ex-Hitler Youth and would not excommunicate a man who implied the Holocaust doesn't exist.  The Church is also notorious for protecting child molesters.<br>  <br>  So tell me why I should admire a wrinkly old man who has no clue about how things work outside his little bubble and was his predecessor's enforcer on the worst aspects of the Catholic Church.  And tell me why someone can be denied communion for supporting reproductive rights, but it's just fine if someone supports the death penalty.|`|FIXKYCIGaa	I have nothing against him.  Also, why would I care if his blog hits #1?  What, in your mind, would be the significance of that?  None that I can see.|`|4AxBMYpUaa	Not particularly.|`|70OClBEQaa	No<br>  Never met the guy........<br>  He never did/has done anything to improve my lifestyle so No|`|AxQmd4flaa	Why should I? Should I worship Suze Ormon because she has a popular blog as well?|`|0f7ba60c4b5854ac551f8222ad3afdf1aa	I liked the old pope better, he looked like my grandpa. What was his name....John Paul whatchamacallit?|`|jTVbjyghaa	Why would I admire a leader of a faith that goes against my own beliefs?|`|quN4DCGWaa	Honestly, I can't believe people still listen to those old men in Rome. You are supposed to base your spiritual life on the doctrine of some homophobic, sexist nazi who knows nothing about you or your situation, because he claim's to be "God's representative on earth". What a load of crap.|`|leCcd0rfaa	He looks like a zombie. If I saw him walking down the street, I might try to shoot him in the face.|`|81SiImlSaa	Hell no!  How could anyone admire or respect a man who has gone out of his way to make many peoples lives miserable.<br>  <br>  Not an atheist but a recovering catholic.|`|CT265lQyaa	He's the richest, most powerful human being on the planet.<br>  What's not to like?<br>  <br>  (Except that he's also old, wrinkly, and delusional.)|`|26414b2f3237391dde0fd3b0221fcffcaa	What has the Pope done that deserves admiration? He wears a big, pointy hat and tells people they shouldn't use protection during sex. How is that incredible in any way?|`|JVUsliRGaa	NO,<br>  you are a failtroll<br>  get outta here.<br>  <br>  Yeah that makes sense, reinstating his old hitler's youth friends will definitely change my opinion on him.<br>  <br>  YOU FAIL|`|YnGIccE8aa	Well you all can at least admit it's cool the Pope actually has a BLOG right?|`|dDprsKZYaa	I know absolutely nothing about the man beyond his silly hat and desperate clinging to ancient fairy tales...<br>  <br>  so no.|`|i444oWjjaa	No, and no.<br>  <br>  I don't actively dislike the man, but I don't admire him either.|`|9Ur1VL9Paa	No; I will never admire him|`|K8QTdUnfaa	No
C1SOqQSkaa	I know nothing of your tendency to lie or your degree of delusion. What you claim goes against everything I know, and your word can't be trusted.<br>  <br>  If you wish to claim something so extraordinary, the burden is on you to provide at least some evidence. Such a claim would be best served by very strong evidence indeed.|`|70OClBEQaa	I would believe that you had a drink or two before studying or when you were studying you got too bored and you started to imagine things. Maybe you had a joint before studying how the hell do i know but when i smoke i do see funny things ill admit to that so most likely i think the pink elephant is more accurate than jesus.|`|j6GVLXgDaa	I don't really believe the first one too much because you wouldn't be here on yahoo answers trying to compare the Jesus situation with the pink elephant|`|XxWovDNCaa	I believe that you THINK you saw that. And I would reccomend that you visit a mental health professional as soon as possible.|`|4AxBMYpUaa	DON'T YOU DARE MAKE FUN OF THE PINK ELEPHANT! REIEM SMASH!|`|K8QTdUnfaa	Glad you clarified about the pink elephant.  I take pink elephants very seriously.<br>  <br>  I have no reason to believe either statement.  If you truly believed that you saw or heard either, you might need a psychiatric evaluation.|`|4d16b72ffa495ae128ab9f89679fc203aa	No, I would not believe you unless you provided me with some good objective, verifiable, validatable evidence to support your claims.|`|CT265lQyaa	If you were serious about either statement I would think you've been into the "pink elephant JUICE"!|`|qhdFxwe3aa	dude whatever you were smoking...I want some!!<br>  no but for real i see what your saying..nope (that's why i'm atheist)|`|dDprsKZYaa	No on both counts.<br>  They are both ridiculous claims.<br>  <br>  Everyone knows it was Ceiling Cat that spoke to you.|`|GHdscZ2Haa	I would not believe either version.|`|s7pqFa1eaa	In either case, I would believe that you were seeing things that were not there.|`|a48cfffc5a668f8ee11c890acdaf3ccfaa	First of all with the death of the last apostle, all miracles came to a halt.  Jesus told his followers that his return would be invisible to man.  So anyone seeing Jesus (or what Hollywood has imprinted in our minds as to what Jesus looked like) is obviously suffering from delusions.  Jesus told us to worship God with Truth and Faith.  If we kept on seeing various images, what sort of faith would that require?<br>  <br>  As for pink elephants talking to you from your ceiling...can I come over and share some shrooms too?

e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	My favorite thing about St. Joseph was his humility.  I guess this goes along with  1 2 3's "flashy" comment.<br>  <br>  He had one of, if not the, arguably hardest and most important jobs of anybody in the Bible:  taking care of Jesus, God's own son.<br>  <br>  He does his work, asks for no glory, makes sure Jesus grows up to be an upright and moral man, then he quietly disappears.  Even the gospels don't say when he died or how he lived or anything.<br>  <br>  True humility is doing  what God calls you do to and not expecting angels and  trumpets and kudos from angels and men.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Concentrate on St Joseph the Worker, because Jesus was a private person and a worker for far longer than His public ministry. Same with Mary the Housewife. <br>  <br>  Youth assume the opposite of what the Gospel teaches.

0b1bc0d20db45e766b5bd783ee1b2812aa	I love Bill Maher, I enjoyed the movie and I'm quite sympathetic to his views on religion, but I will have to admit I had a moment or two of uneasyness.  The questions were fine, but the targets of his inquest were not always up to the task. I would have felt better if he had gone after more people that could have given a better retort (sort of pick on somebody his own size).  Though I did not think he was at all disrespectful.|`|i3lXJbtFaa	I thought it was good entertainment, but the interviews were too cropped and the whole thing smelled like somewhat yellow, ambush journalism.<br>  <br>  A documentary it is not. An entertaining movie it is.|`|WX1b747Iaa	I kept worrying that he was going to get beat up or killed along the way, I think the camera saved him.

They said they really think Bill Mahar is funny, and went to see it because they like his shows. Let me tell you, I've NEVER heard the class go quiet so quickly. I noted "Oh yeah I liked it too. Bill Mahar is hilarious." simply to distract the evil glares directed at this poor student.|`|XsTJPMHqaa	I never saw it, but I'm not usually offended by questions, (here's the key) depending on how they're worded.<br>  <br>  The thing is, sometimes you might offend someone without realizing it, just like how we may offend someone of a different culture because we didn't know they don't shake hands or something.<br>  <br>  Like calling the Catholic Church, "The Roman Church", or asking why we "worship Mary" or calling the Communion host a "cracker" are all very offensive, but if you didn't know, you might not understand why.<br>  <br>  Now it would be up to the person you're talking to to correct your ignorance on this so you wouldn't inadvertently offend anyone else, but if they thought you did know, well, the whole thing can get messy.|`|uurTX7POaa	drooling of a two-bit comedian-clown never offends me.

It is true that some people just take their religion for granted in the nutshell, but there is a deep meaning behind it which is very beautiful and relevant and important to lives.<br>  I think without carefully understanding this, the religious bashing will continue, and I think that is normal. They just don't understand.<br>  <br>  Peace|`|hKJIDdVqaa	nothing offends me, and I do not share the views off Mr. Maher.|`|bb06GQ5Paa	Asking questions never offends me if the person is genuinely interested and not trying to make me out to be a fool.

Don't think that everyone that is christian is good. OFten times christians are more evil then regular people. Your perception of him was wrong. Be glad you didn't marry him. He sounds like an evil man. You can also take him to court for infringement of character.|`|tx4bRDrXaa	It is very typical especially for the leaders.I've seen many preachers sent to so called different assignments and the real reason ?They had been caught up in the same thing that you mentioned. I'm not knocking any denomimation I've seen it in most all of them.The reason is they do not follow the scriptural council at (1 Corinthians 5:9-13) In my letter I wrote YOU to quit mixing in company with fornicators, 10?not [meaning] entirely with the fornicators of this world or the greedy persons and extortioners or idolaters. Otherwise, YOU would actually have to get out of the world. 11?But now I am writing YOU to quit mixing in company with anyone called a brother that is a fornicator or a greedy person or an idolater or a reviler or a drunkard or an extortioner, not even eating with such a man. 12?For what do I have to do with judging those outside? Do YOU not judge those inside, 13?while God judges those outside? “Remove the wicked [man] from among yourselves.(Matthew 7:22) Many will say to me in that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and expel demons in your name, and perform many powerful works in your name? And yet then I will confess to them: I never knew YOU! Get away from me, YOU workers of lawlessness.What  does the Bible really teach ? Living in a way that pleases God.<br>  <a href="http://www.jw.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.jw.org/</a> In our congregation if a man or woman is found guilty of any of the things Paul mentioned above he will be put out of the congregation and given time to obtain repentence then he can return.|`|xelkbdbdaa	If this church feels that this is acceptable and you don't, find a new church.

You were willing to date a man who wasn't quite divorced.  You dated him for a year while he was still married to another woman.<br>  <br>  And who dumped whom?  It sounds as if you said you didn't want to continue to date him while he was married, and he said okay.  He didn't dump you; it sounds as if you broke up by mutual consent.  He didn't do anything to you except rebound very quickly with another woman, who it appears was in the process of a divorce herself.  Yeah, it sucks to be replaced so fat, but guess what?  It happens.<br>  <br>  I tend not to trust what people claim is "god's will" because it coincides so perfectly with their own desires, in case you haven't noticed.  And his line about the devil using you is a great indicator that you're well rid of this jerk.<br>  <br>  Quit your whining.  If you don't like the church's inaction, find another, harsher church.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	Everyone is a sinner.  Stop looking at man, at pastors, and at people to live up to your expectations of perfection. <br>  <br>  Because, they WONT live up to it.  They're still sinners themselves. <br>  <br>  Look at Jesus instead.  :)<br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!  :)|`|hKJIDdVqaa	this is the exact reason I do not go to church.  I will teach my children of the lord in our home from the bible. When they get to an age when they can decipher the truth then they can go to church if they choose.  The flock leader should do as such-lead by example. However in the grand scheme of things all of it means nothing.|`|E9chZY74aa	These people are not the kind of examples for being teachers of God's word, to children or adults.  That preacher should have conferred with the elders and told them to leave until they sorted out their lives in the way God wishes.  <br>  God desires faithfulness, not feelings.  If this man was not divorced he should not be dating at all.  He is still obligated to his wife, whether he feels like it or not.

It would say the title of the station, and then the prayer would coincide with the Station. I thought it was an amazing way to have older kids not only think about what Jesus went through, but to teach them to pray for others. And for that matter: give to others less fortunate, learn about the suffering in the world, etc. <br>  <br>  I'll see if I can find a link for you and if they can be purchased.

Bb6fQtl0aa	The word "Nasabi" has been adopted by the Shee'ah as a derogatory term to insult Muslims who love the Prophet, peace be upon him, his Sunnah, his family, and his companions.<br>  <br>  The word "Raafidhah" is a term adopted by the scholars of Islam to describe the Shee'ah. The word "Raafidhah" comes from the word meaning "to reject".<br>  <br>  The term was applied because when the Shee'ah approached Zayd ibn 'Alee ibn al-Husayn (the great grandson of 'Alee ibn Abee Taalib), may Allaah be pleased with him, they asked him what he thought about Aboo Bakr and 'Umar, may Allaah be pleased with them.<br>  <br>  Zayd praised Abu Bakr and 'Umar responded: "They are the ministers of my grandfather."<br>  <br>  Upon hearing this the Shee'ah rejected Zayd ibn 'Alee ibn al-Husayn and his leadership. And this is why they are called the "Raafidhah".<br>  <br>  <br>  ADDITIONAL NOTE FOR CLARITY<br>  ---<br>  The reason why the Shi'a are not accepted nor reconciled with is because they have introduced beliefs and practices into Islam that were never taught by the Prophet, peace be upon him, never taught by his family, or his companions. Rather they have changed Islam from it's original perfected form and thusly, innovated a way of life that leads to Hellfire. This is not a dispute between a trivial "this" and "that", it is a serious issue dealing with the difference between the Straight Path to Paradise and the crooked paths that lead to punishment in this life and the next. May Allaah rectify our condition and affairs.<br>  <br>  With regards to Shee'ism, then it is not the Islam that was taught by Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him. Rather, they are a group that have exaggerated the status of the noble family of the Prophet, peace be upon him, to the extent that they build shrines devoted to their worship along with Allaah. This is shirk, polytheism, the greatest crime a human being can commit in the sight of Allaah.<br>  <br>  The proper way to practice Islam is to follow the understanding of the Qur'aan and the Prophetic life example that was actually taught by Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, and actually lived by the Prophet, peace be upon him, his family, and his companions.<br>  <br>  All beliefs and acts of worship that oppose this way are affairs that lead away from Paradise and lead towards Hellfire.<br>  <br>  It is not permissible to worship Allaah with acts of worship that did not exist in the time of the Prophet, peace be upon him (such as pilgrimage to Karbala, calling upon 'Ali or other human beings for help who are dead or absent, building shrines dedicated to saints, etc...) And it is not permissible to interpret the Qur'aan with meanings that oppose what the Prophet, peace be upon him, actually taught.<br>  <br>  Remember, the main goal of every Muslim is to enter Paradise and to avoid torment in the Hellfire. The main goal is not unity in this life for the sake of "unity". If the Shee'ah have chosen for themselves a path to destruction, then it is not in any Muslim's interest to "unite" with them. Rather the sincere Muslim should advise them to return to the right guidance that Allaah created us and them for, and if they refuse, then other Muslims should be warned against falling into their severe errors. By this way, with Allaah's permission, we preserve the correct practice of Islam for ourselves and for future generations who seek to worship Allaah correctly.<br>  <br>  Whether the Shia' as a whole will repent and return to the Straight Path...? Allaah knows best. This splitting amongst the Muslims is a test from Allaah to see who will sincerely and correctly follow His religion.

When people refer to "a pre-written memorized prayer" <which is what you refer to here I assume>, that isn't quite the same to me as a personal prayer between a person and the Lord.   The latter being far more powerful by it's very nature in my estimation.<br>  <br>  But comparing prayers to prayers.... I think the only thing that makes one prayer more "powerful" than another, is the degree of humility, faith,sincerity and earnestness with which the prayer is offered....  Christ referred often to those who prayed publicly for the recognition of men so clearly our intent and depth of truth & belief that is within the prayerful persons heart, I THINK, determines the POWER in which that prayer might be offered & received.<br>  <br>  That's my take on it.....|`|JthubNIsaa	You can pray the most eloquent prayers but if you are not right with God [in heart and deeds] and/or not in His will [meaning you really don't know Him well or are continually sinning against Him] your prayers won't be as effective. ie If you are a smoker, how can you ask/pray for healing, etc.?<br>  <br>  Some of the most powerful prayers are ones you can't even articulate. The Holy Spirit can interpret a simple sigh. He is the advocate to Jesus and Jesus is the advocate to the Father.|`|AnW3dzQfaa	I wouldn't consider praying for a good day to be powerful so to me not all prayers are equally powerful.|`|XxWovDNCaa	ALL prayer is a waste of time.<br>  After all, there is no one listening.

The more obedient  you are the more the lord will give you . And you will be amazed of the love that the lord has for you . For the lord say be careful for what you pray for, for it can come to your condemnation. For we are to pray for what can make our live happier or for things that we are in need of or to help others, the sick the needy the poor and for gifts, any thing that is good, and things you know that god can give to you. Remember nothing evil for it will come back to you, . Never ask the lord to take a life or hurt some one in any way. Pray for your enemies that they may become your friends do good to them that hate you that they may one day be grateful and help you in your time of need . Power in prayer yes great power. Also note that does a parent give unto a child that is disobedient No the lord is the same remember that,. For I have been so blessed in my life that I know that God lives and that he is real as you and I are ,except he has all power to do as he pleases. and to bless whom he pleases to bless. Amen.|`|JXMpZiwxaa	Yes. "Give me an army saying the rosary and I will conquer the world!” -Pope Blessed Pius IX <br>  <br>  The rosary is most powerful when each Hail Mary is prayed attentively.  One Hail Mary well said gives more grace than many thoughtlessly said.  However, MANY well-said is much more powerful than one well-said.<br>  <br>  St. Louis Marie Grignion de Montfort wrote: "The rosary is the most powerful weapon to touch the Heart of Jesus, Our Redeemer, who so loves His Mother."<br>  <br>  Pope Pius XII: “There is no surer means of calling down God’s blessings upon the family…than the daily recitation of the rosary.”<br>  <br>  St. Francis de Sales said the greatest method of praying is to pray the rosary.<br>  <br>  "The rosary is the scourge of the devil" -- Pope Adrian VI<br>  <br>  "The rosary is a treasure of graces" -- Pope Paul V<br>  <br>  Padre Pio, the stigmatic priest, said: "The rosary is THE WEAPON"<br>  <br>  The rosary is explained here:<br>  <a href="http://www.ewtn.com/Devotionals/prayers/rosary/how_to.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ewtn.com/Devotionals/prayers/...</a><br>  <br>  And rosary miracles are detailed on the middle of this webpage:<br>  <a href="http://overcomeproblems.com/about_the_rosary.htm" rel="nofollow">http://overcomeproblems.com/about_the_ro...</a><br>  <br>  The fifteen promises of Mary to Christians who recite the rosary:<br>  1. Whoever shall faithfully serve me by the recitation of the Rosary shall receive signal graces.<br>  2. I promise my special protection and the greatest graces to all those who shall recite the Rosary.<br>  3. The Rosary shall be a powerful armor against Hell, it will destroy vice, decrease sin, and defeat heresies.<br>  4. It will cause virtue and good works to flourish; it will obtain for souls the abundant mercy of God; it will withdraw the hearts of men from the love of the world and its vanities and will lift them to the desire of eternal things. Oh, that souls would sanctify themselves by this means.<br>  5. The soul which recommends itself to me by the recitation of the Rosary, shall not perish.<br>  6. Whoever shall recite the Rosary devoutly, applying himself to the consideration of its sacred mysteries, shall never be conquered by misfortune. God will not chastise him in His justice, he shall not perish by an unprovided death; if he be just, he shall remain in the grace of God and become worthy of eternal life.<br>  7. Whoever shall have a true devotion for the Rosary shall not die without the Sacraments of the Church.<br>  8. Those who are faithful to recite the Rosary shall have during their life and at their death the light of God and the plenitude of His graces; at the moment of death, they shall participate in the merits of the saints in Paradise.<br>  9. I shall deliver from Purgatory those who have been devoted to the Rosary.<br>  10. The faithful children of the Rosary shall merit a high degree of glory in Heaven.<br>  11.

Every culture and society has a creation story, and, like it or not, that's the one we get.  More than that, everybody, believers and non-believers alike, know the story, and we get to make whatever conclusion we want about it.  By me, the Adam and Eve story can be symbolic, and it will not change the fact that I believe in and love God.  I think it's really about how we choose to live our lives.  Best wishes to you!|`|2d3c0dd80f2737f4fd6ec8f62b612c70aa	The tree was real but it's fruit was a symbol of God’s right to determine for man what was “good” (approved by God) and what is “bad” (condemned by God). It was a test of man’s respect for his Creator’s position and his willingness to remain within the area of freedom decreed by God.<br>  To prove this read Gen 3:6,7, in doing so you will find nothing changed when Eve ate the fruit.<br>  It was when Adam ate the fruit from the tree that they realize that they were naked. <br>  (Other wise she would have find Adam and said," sweet heart you really need to cover up. Here I made me and you some things, But I really need some designer leaves though.") lol|`|mVsWyu0yaa	In a Myth everything is symbolic. <br>  <br>  Actually...when the Genesis Myth was created, the desert nomads who created their god Yahweh, were having a helluva time weaning the people away from worship of the first Deity..the GODDESS....whether she was the Summerian Anath, or the Canaanite Asterath, or the Egyptian Isis. Their remedy was to denigrate women to the point of making them the 'filthy fount' of seduction and evil.  So they created a MALE god who then created EVE, the mother of ALL evil...the reason poor, dumb Adam fell from grace..and all of his progeny with him for all time.<br>  <br>  To take the Genesis myth literally is to condone the idiocy of talking snakes and a god who sets traps for his creatures KNOWING they will fall into that trap.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	Literal.<br>  <br>  The Garden of Eden was literal.  Adam and Eve are literal.  Creation is literal. <br>  <br>  Jesus made it clear that it is all literal.

Adam and Eve both have names, which imply they were literal people. There is no reason to assume the story is allegorical, or that the tree is symbolic. <br>  Also, in descriptions of the literal heaven in other parts of scripture, the tree of life is referred to in this same literal way as being present in heaven and people eating of it's fruits.|`|M7ZU8VQfaa	I find it humorous to see how believers can never agree on this point. Some say it was literal, some say it is an allegory.  When I have asked questions in the past criticizing how Adam and Eve could have known that eating from the tree was wrong if they had no understanding of good and bad BEFORE eating from the tree, believers scream at me for taking a literal view of this story.  Then I you ask if this story is literal or an allegory and some of the same people scream at you for not taking this story as literal.  It seems obvious to me that they flip flop on this issue to suit their needs.|`|XSEWADI0aa	Gen. 2:8,?9: “Jehovah God planted a garden in Eden, toward the east, and there he put the man whom he had formed. Thus Jehovah God made to grow out of the ground every tree desirable to one’s sight and good for food and also the tree of life in the middle of the garden.” (After Adam’s sin the human pair were driven out of Eden so that they would not eat from the tree of life, according to Genesis 3:22,?23. So it seems that if Adam had remained obedient to his Creator, God would in time have permitted him to eat from that tree as a symbol of his having proved worthy to live forever. The presence of the tree of life in Eden pointed to such a prospect.)<br>  <br>  literal|`|26414b2f3237391dde0fd3b0221fcffcaa	If you want to believe the Tree of Knowledge was real, you'll also believe that the talking snake existed, that the world is only a few thousand years old, and that Adam and Eve's children were incestuous in order to create new generations.|`|sa1Xgu61aa	Greetings,<br>  <br>  It definitely was a real place!

The phrase was borrowed from Saint Catherine of Siena, whom both Dorothy and Peter admired. It was in this way that Catherine had spoken of the Pope: "Our Dear Sweet Christ on Earth."...We can think of no better headline."<br>  <br>  Paul was given insight into the future of the church.  He was shown that over the next 300 years a single man would exalt himself above the throne of God, claiming to be Christ on Earth, able to forgive sins and edit the Word of God.  This was the falling away.|`|XSEWADI0aa	The man of lawlessness” sets himself in opposition to God and is therefore a “satan,” which means “resister.” And, indeed, his “presence is according to the operation of Satan.” (2Th 2:9) In the days of the apostle Paul, there was “mystery,” or a religious secret, about the identity of this “man of lawlessness.” To this day mystery shrouds his identity in the minds of many persons, because his wickedness is practiced under the guise of godly devotion. (2Th 2:7) By his lying teachings contrary to or superseding, as it were, the law of God, “the man of lawlessness” sets himself up over Jehovah God and other ‘gods,’ mighty ones of the earth, and also against God’s holy ones, true spiritual brothers of Jesus Christ. (Compare 2Pe 2:10-13.) Since he is a hypocrite, a false teacher claiming to be Christian, he “sits down in the temple of The God,” that is, what such false teachers claim to be that temple.—2Th 2:4.|`|sa1Xgu61aa	Hello,<br>  <br>  Great question since we are approaching this time!  First you have to know that the "he" is the anti-christ.  The temple is the final version of the famous temple that was built by Solomon first, then Nehemiah/Ezra, and now for the third time and last it will be built in Israel again.  The plans have already been set for this temple (research this on google with reliable sources).  The Israelites have sent petitions out to the Jews here in the U.S. to request donations for this temple.  <br>  <br>  The Arab-Israeli conflict is what is hindering this process right now.  It seems to be closer and closer to the time when there will be a world order and a leader who will create a 7 year peace treaty in Israel.  This may be the time when the temple is built.  But the Anti-christ will declare himself to be God in that temple halfway through that peace covenant.  <br>  <br>  Be on the look out, JESUS is coming soon!<br>  <br>  May the LORD find you faithful when He comes.|`|3IimJWgXaa	the temple of God is a church...<br>  <br>  This verse is saying someone is being haha VERY foolish and acting as if they are a God.

In the seat of god I have seated myself, in the heart of the open sea,’ whereas an earthling man is what you are, and not a god, and you keep making your heart like the heart of god—<br>  <br>  (Ezekiel 28:8) Down to the pit they will bring you, and you must die the death of someone slain in the heart of the open sea.|`|ZTPCOiJlaa	Could be two things<br>  <br>  It is very possible that before the end the Temple will be rebuilt in Jerusalem.<br>  <br>  It is prophesied in Daniel and Matt that there will be an abomination that makes desolate in the temple and that the person responsible will set himself up as God.<br>  <br>  This is the most likely interpretation. However it has happened twice now. Once by the Greeks and once by the Romans<br>  <br>  It could also mean that he will set himself up as a Messiah of the church (some are looking for the coming of Elijah to be such a person believe it or not) and will set himself up in the hearts of the body of Messiah as the Messiah. This is very unlikely however the prophecies say in Matt 24 indicate that the very elect could become deceived.<br>  <br>  So I would say an actual temple in Jerusalem, however I won't rule out the body of Messiah being the temple and our hearts as the seat.<br>  <br>  Never try and nail down Messianic prophecies or you will find that you will disbelieve the truth when it happens because it doesn't fit your paradigm.|`|lJUyhMceaa	2Th 2:3  Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; <br>  2Th 2:4  Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God. <br>  <br>  This is talking about the period known as the 7 year tribulation.  Before the 7 year tribulation starts, God says there will be a great falling away from Biblical truths, and then the "son of perdition" (Antichrist) will come on the scene.  We won't know who he is right away, but towards the half way point in the7 year tribulation, he will declare himself to be the Saviour of all mankind, and will even go as far as to enter the Temple of God (in Jerusalem, which will be build again by that time), and set down on the throne and demand worship. <br>  <br>  We also know from Revelation, that he will go as far as to make everyone take a mark of some type to declare their loyalty to him.  At some point it will become mandatory or you can not even sell or buy things.  The Bible tells us that anyone who takes this mark can not be saved.|`|AaVfzRamaa	A Temple of God is different than Church that is used for regular meetings They are used for sacred ordinances that Requires a building dedicated and set apart for that purpose. They are used for saving ordinances for both the Living and the dead.

Iran is a term that is: "the land of Aryans". The Aryans were the tall giant, blonde haired blue eyed, white skinned Iranian worriors known as Saka Scythians. They were the strongest tribes in the world. they migrated to the nations of the Persian Empire, Germanic tribes, indo-European nations, Southern Russian nations(Uzbeckeztan) and the Chinese Empire ESPECIALLY Nippon(Japan). once they invaded those nations/regions it became and Aryan nation. The true Iranians are white people with blonde/red hair and blue eyes, just like Japanese people = Aryans. <br>  Both E. Asians and W.Asians presently have Aryan characteristics, especially Iran and Afghanistan, go on youtube and search Persian Aryans or the Aryans of Asia, and see for yourself. <br>  Either way i appologize for giving wrong information accidently<br>  Gutten Hag|`|ROUAPY3waa	It differs.

They are Slavic. The original inhabitants of Central Asia were indeed Mongoloid, but a lot of people who are White Russian (i.e. Slavic) moved there during the Soviet Era so the people u showed pictures of are actually Caucasian. Middle Eastern People are also classed as Caucasian racially. Being Caucasian does not mean that you have to be White skinned. While some Middle Easterners are indeed White skinned (especially those from countries like Syria and Lebanon) , even the darker ones are still biologically classed as Caucasian. The people in Central Asia who ARE Mongoloid look similar to Chinese people.|`|INIJXLVCaa	I am afraid to agree...<br>  the Caucasian Arab League may come after me...|`|iW80AcLgaa	and your point is?|`|AnHQbZQAaa	does it matter?

F4knwfVsaa	I am a car salesman and I let them speak for a solid 2 minutes then I ask them where they are from again and they stop and repeat what they first started to say. Then I wait a few minutes more and ask them what they are selling again (at this time they have already told you) then I say Oh ok. Then after a few more minutes I ask them  Who is this. They will repeat themselves and so do I with "Who is this". Then after a few more minutes I ask them what kind of car they drive....they usually answer....then I ask the all of my qualifying questions, which believe me is more than they have for me. They get freaked out and hang up. They will not call for a long time after that. They will call you in time no matter what, so why not have some fun with them.|`|3q3QXQp4aa	just hang up immediately everytime they call. rude but effective, cuts the conversation time having to say 'no i'm not interested, take my name off your calling list' etc. I'm a polite person in every other respect but I have no patience with people haranguing me at home on my landline and at work on my mobile.|`|uxvskU7Xaa	if u call the national do not call number and they continue to call report them to the people listed on the website for the national do not call list teh telemarketers get fined|`|rJJhMQ37aa	I just cut into their spiel, and tell them that I don't want anything.

There may be a bit of a delay (1-3 months) before the numbers trickle down to everyone. After three months, a company 'cold calling' you - that is with no record of you having done business with them - is breaking the law. Report them. <br>  <br>  Political callers, survey takers and not-for-profits are exempt from the list, but you can tell them to stop and they have to, or be reported.<br>  <br>  If you do have a business relationship with the company that is calling you, then you have to take a different approach. Stop the telemarketer in mid-pitch. Do not respond to the pitch - Go ahead... it's ok. Instead ask that they put you on *their* do not call list. If they can't do that, request the number of the department that does. <br>  <br>  Speak to them and after you identify yourself or your account, say in clear terms: <br>  <br>  "I wish to be placed on your Do Not Call List. I do not wish to ever hear from your company again unless it is directly related to my monthly bill or services already on my account."<br>  <br>  They have to comply. I have squashed calls from my cell phone company, mortgage company, all my credit card companies and the cable people. <br>  <br>  My phone is blissfully quiet now.|`|4p1m2Saeaa	I have some fun with them. There was one time that my wife answered the phone in a little kid voice.  When they asked for parents, she said she hasn't seen them in three days.  <br>  <br>  I also let people know of businesses who have telemarketed me.  Two I can think of off hand are Direct TV and Bank of America.  We truly need to let businesses feel that this practice costs them money and customers, not the other way around. <br>  <br>  It may be a legal business practice, but it is unethical.  My home phone is my HOME phone, not for business unless I call out. Period.|`|ezT7xruoaa	tell your phone company to block anonymous numbers, its worked for me, because all call centres block their number when they do outbound calling, and they cannot undo this so they can't call you when you do this.|`|CJ75pkgzaa	Dont get angry take the opportunity to have some fun, swear at them , swear their mothers , make weird noises, totally have fun, answer in other languages|`|I5SypMlsaa	disconnect phone, get caller id... and only pick up the phone for people on your list.<br>  just use a cellphone instead oh home phone, i dont get any telemarketing calls at all|`|d2a3834786860b34ae904f14b9d846faaa	www.donotcall.gov    Put your ph.  no.  on that website and it should  stop  most of the calls.|`|LkHzsRcDaa	Try this link: <a href="https://www.donotcall.gov/" rel="nofollow">https://www.donotcall.gov/</a>|`|IB2V5t1Oaa	Ask them to place you on their "Do Not Call" list.|`|tRcO5uyiaa	If you have Call Display, just ignore any numbers that are outside your area code or any 1-800 numbers.

My phone company did that for me before I got call display, for about 3 months straight. They blocked all telemarketers calls. It was great!|`|NXujuDxnaa	No way that I know of to effectively cut the numbers, i'm afraid. <br>  <br>  Annoying as they are, it can still be a lot of fun to mess with them.

Otherwise, just tell the telemarketer directly to stop calling you.|`|YGGASrfJaa	When they call my house i put the phone next to the tv and let them listen to it until they hang up they never call back again.|`|e5zcSIZOaa	Simple. you just politely tell them not to call your house anymore. ask them to take you off thier calling list, then if they call you again, cuss them out.|`|sqUPqbPzaa	go to donotcall.gov and register I had the same problem.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Get caller ID and a block that does not allow anyone to call you with their number blocked that way you cut down on most of them.|`|0F8hauikaa	Sign up with the National Do Not Call Registry.

e5NqWoFbaa	Oh my! The other answerers got it SO wrong! It just CANNOT be P-G-G, because the adjectives HAVE to have THE SAME case as the noun... My point is рабочей is not a noun (if it were, it truly would be genetive, but we'd have to do something to the phrase - put a comma there, for example). It's an adjective which agrees with окраине. Thus, it's P-P-P.|`|bGdTivxqaa	It is Prep., Prep., Prep.

664ef7ac282ab7a5fe638caafbfb05b3aa	I am not mixed, but I agree with Dr. Martin Luther King who was very much ahead of his time when he said that he had a dream that his children "will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character."<br>  <br>  The whole world needs to get to the point where skin color is not important -- how we live our lives is what is important.<br>  <br>  Think about it.  Figure it out.|`|4qT0TfMZaa	Mature adults remain above such shallow topics as the color of one's skin, the shape of one's lips or one's gender.  You remind me of my undergrads when they studied psychology at university - several of them began to fear they were mentally deranged because they recognized some suggestive symptoms in themselves.  It was quite difficult to get them to realize that each and every one of us exhibits some symptoms from time to time that happen to be observable also in the truly mentally ill.  You're inserting too much of yourself into your studies.  <br>  Stop it.<br>  You're better than that.|`|W76VDFKCaa	My daughter is biracial and I taught her that she is 'biracial, that she is both black and white' because I don't want her to feel like she has to choose sides.  I also learned to stay on the fence over racial issues (I try not to favor one side over the other) so she is allowed to form her own opinions.  I read somewhere not too long ago that multiracial people usually do not have an issue with their identity but there problem is when other people expect them to choose their race.  Don't try to identify yourself as black or white, just tell them that you are biracial.|`|gkVd0encaa	i do... my mom is black from the dominican republic, and my dad is north american white from USA... i fell the same too.. im right in the middle and some people say im white, others say im black... i call myself mixed... it is awkward....|`|OIo9kfzVaa	hope im not steeping out of line by putting forward my views here. But i really think your lecturer had it spot on. i feel the important factor here is not whether you are white or black, its that it doesn't matter if you are white or black. colour of skin makes no difference to who you are. its the enviournment in which you are bought up in.Imaginen the flip side of the coin, eg, rather than living with your mum, you lived with your dad. is it not feasible that you would be feeling the same things, just from the other side? its your culture that makes you who you are. I know many black people that consider themselves english, i also know some who consider themself's to be Jamaican, as that's where their family is from. in most cases, it comes down to what the parents have taught them. you are who you want to be. skin colour is not important. but it appears you have been raised as english (not white). hope this hasnt offended you in any way.
6hRbcDmmaa	That's an incredibly complex question to answer. There are a lot of psychological disturbances that happen to gays, especially, that draw them to a sexual lifestyle. Growing up where your sexuality isn't embraced, accepted and encouraged, gays and lesbians grow underdeveloped emotionally and sexually which makes them feel vulnerable and perhaps immature. Another reason could be the lack of gay role models and mentors in our lives to look up to, and the yearn for someone to embrace their sexuality. Divorced parents can also trigger the sexual urges or the need for a male/female closeness. The reason they sleep around is because they haven't fully matured to handle relationships because we have never been taught it. Therefore, these people are scared of the unknown, or possible serious relationship that could be, something so foreign it produces a great deal of anxiety. So, to sustain happiness, they start all over again with another guy/girl. It's a vicious and heartbreaking cycle. I'm a gay guy and I'll though I've never slept around, I've witness the behaviours in others.|`|cSaVqUDdaa	Na i get where your coming from <br>  i haven't been with anybody in a 1yr and a month<br>  <br>  i just have other things that im focused on<br>  besides being in a relationship or having sex<br>  <br>  im 16 ( i have my whole life ahead of me for that) <br>  i just got my hs diploma,im trying to take college<br>  classes because im gonna be a forensic nurse and<br>  im trying to look for a job so i can have money<br>  coming in as im pursuing my goal. so yeah.|`|03f6d70aa511193e6f0a3fd450df20e2aa	In these days, people could care less about a <br>  relationship.

LGBT people are not to be defined by hetero norms, and therefore relationships are not as important<br>  2. LGBT people are searching for the "perfect" prince (or in your case, princess) charming - but the fact is, that doesn't exist.<br>  3. LGBT people have so much pinned up sexual tensions, that they have as much sex as possible - like it's taboo, so it's more appealing.<br>  <br>  these are just 3.<br>  <br>  Many of us do in fact have nice stable long term relationships.

Der Umschwung der Handlung und die Action-Szenen machen ihn zu meinem Lieblingsfilm.<br>  Im Gegensatz zu anderen Filmen verl?sst sich "Der K?nig der L?wen" nicht auf berühmte Schauspieler und ist trotzdem brilliant.<br>  Meine Lieblingsszene ist die, in der Simba seinen Onkel besiegt und die Führung des Rudels übernimmt.<br>  <br>  Insgesamt ist der Film für alle Altersgruppen geeignet und wird immer mein Lieblingsfilm bleiben. Ich empfehle ihn jedem.<br>  <br>  @sedora: falls du gerade "Daumen runter" gegeben hast? Ich hab das selbst übersetzt und nicht deine übersetzung ver?ndert! Wir laufen uns hier immer wieder über den Weg und deine übersetzungen sind echt klasse -> also kein Grund für "Daumen runter" LG betty
Cgz1n3xNaa	He was the more feminine son. . . if you catch my drift.|`|NsHV4O8oaa	when dying, Jesus was able to call a legion of angels to his assistance, and likely he himself could probably have caused a supernova in Rome, and concentrated it onto each persons skull!<br>  mwahahahaa!<br>  but thats hardly an appealing quality for a saviour is it?|`|IUQBvODuaa	Would you wantt to believe in a God that would beat the CRAP outta of you, if you stepped out of line. OR . A God that forgives you for your mistakes, thus his son being a forgiving person. Nothing to do with "powers".|`|Qlo4ZWGraa	God: "Because in order for Sampson to have his mighty strength he had to grow his hair out like a damn hippy, and no Son of Mine is gonna wear His hair long like a damn dirty hippy!"|`|gf3CCvuUaa	Are you kidding me? God gave his son a power of resurrection!! Even Samson died in the end, but Jesus doesn't. What's cooler than that?!|`|qhdFxwe3aa	Any one who can turn water into wine is a PIMP and needs to party with me!!|`|D9lMg7A2aa	You are an obviously deep guy.<br>  <br>  No wonder you love you so much  :)|`|UH1ipgJmaa	Christ was actually more powerful but He only used His power for the good of Human Kind<br>  <br>  <br>  IF Chrisht wanted He would have called Legions of His Angels & destroyed this Universe in NANOSECONDS|`|dbw210qqaa	Well, you see, He had the power to do anything, but God sent His son to be a propitiation for our sins, the sacrificial Lamb<br>  but<br>  when He comes back next time He will come as King of Kings and Lord of Lords|`|Ynsow6qbaa	If you ask me a 3 day self resurrection, water walking, and water into win is cooler than super strength.|`|xLKPKgZXaa	So, you haven't read about Jesus healing the sick, raising the dead and even coming back to life Himself then!|`|WZsP5Xcbaa	Jesus could at least keep it in his pants, because of Samson's lack of self-control it cost Him his strength.
nisfxpXHaa	I know a lot of things that I wish I didn't know.<br>  <br>  <br>  You know what I mean? :P<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  L|`|AA10665732	WELL! My roommate and his girlfriend have been together for a while. She practically lives here in the room with us, I'm fine with it. So for Valentines day they gave each other gifts, she got him a photo album. I was being a little nosy one day, I really shouldn't. The first few pages were just them looking normal, like hugging and such, then I turned a few more pages and BAM it was like a porno I was like NOOO my eyeeees<br>  haha...|`|po4j4xhAaa	Oh yeah. I know a few things that I wish I didn't.  A particularly painful thing is that someone I had treasured as a friend really only "puts up" with me for old-time's sake.  Needless to say, I won't ever call her again.<br>  <br>  **hugs you back**|`|ApsAIBNWaa	I used to not like the idea that my brother was gay. I "didn't want to know" at the time. When I realized that I was gay as well, I felt a lot better about the idea. lol|`|f48d10d4bec5b5e25f9894010aed2c69aa	yep. 200+ tabs of LSD over 3 years makes you have a lot of realizations that no human needs to be carrying around in their head|`|kavhzTXgaa	Yes..... I'm really good friends with my brother's girlfriend one day she just starts talking about his d*ck size...... I was like EEWWWWW!! I have been permanently scarred.|`|qMcTeBavaa	More than I want to. Among others, I'm waiting for a very good friend's wife to get her hands around my neck when she discovers how long I've known her daughter has been sexually active. <br>  <br>  D|`|z2DmmhqJaa	I don't want to know how she views me. But i do, as a friend.|`|7pKc4WKJaa	I was dating this girl named kristi and we just broke up a few weeks ago because I just could not trust her and its because she cheated on me back in october, I never would of known about it if she wouldnt of told me though and becaue she did it ruined our relationship....and lying about where she was didnt help etha|`|FVxYIuP4aa	That the only friend I had was a fake. I wish I didn't know it. Than again, I'm better off without her anyway, she dislikes me because of the gender I wish to love. Oh well, her loss.|`|qbLTYbZlaa	I know something I wish I didn't about someone I care very much for.  I sometimes wonder if I should mention it but it's probably best not to.|`|HZhvzZKtaa	That my mom was not there! where i was  a little girl!!!!   and i do not know my dad!!!... my mom is in my life now!!!|`|BnIXqxtAaa	the past events that happened in school and everywhere i go.|`|tIU7553maa	I don't want to know that you cloned me.|`|03f6d70aa511193e6f0a3fd450df20e2aa	Yes. <br>  <br>  I wish I never knew that my ex (Guy/jerk)<br>  and my other ex (Girl/Whore) started <br>  going out. <br>  <br>  Makes me sick.|`|UbvglIS6aa	Yes, I know that my ex was cheating on me when we were together.  I wish I hadn't known, for sure.|`|N73oZyY8aa	Yeah, I know where you live.<br>  <br>  <br>  Bwahahahahahahaha!<br>  <br>  <br>  No I don't, it just sounds really scarey in my head to go bwahahahahahaha!|`|LRV65TbHaa	YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...<br>  <br>  BAD IMAGES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  :'(|`|upvd5TRRaa	yep, i have a few things i wish i didn't know.|`|uky2nsh8aa	yeah, lots of things.....<br>  blah
UbvglIS6aa	I only give my phone number to family and friends in person.  I don't like talking on the phone much anyway, so if I don't know who's calling, I won't answer.|`|uky2nsh8aa	well, first i was gonna yell at you, cause i gave you my number, but then i saw what you mean, and well, i think it's a good concept, but the world isn't full of any honest people, so it's dangerous. <br>  n-n-no hugs? *cries*|`|2BEMSGPdaa	It sounds like a pretty stupid thing to do but, almost any phone number and address is available on an on line lookup. It's giving out your real name that is a mistake. I do that anyway rather than have a big mystery..|`|FpMS47sXaa	OMFG - and these are kids!!!!<br>  <br>  It's stupid, plain and simple.<br>  <br>  No one here, not even my closest confidants have my phone number.|`|N73oZyY8aa	I hate telephones. I don't have a cell phone and I don't want one,|`|nisfxpXHaa	That's extremely foolish and reckless.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  L|`|Ao52XHjCaa	Oh goodness, no I would not give out my phone number that way. In fact, I barely give out my phone number to anyone. Maybe about 10 people know it. I don't want strangers calling me and I don't want to be bothered when I am at home by co-workers. The great thing about e-mail is that I don't actually have to give out my number to casual acquaintances any longer and risk that they will disturb me whenever they call.|`|X1j7qYkUaa	Well, when one considers how many numbers are recycled, how many telemarketers are able to contact these numbers <br>  <br>  ... Or perhaps the crazier factor comes into that we leave more serious information on applications for jobs, loans, schools, etc... where there's no clear protection for privacy with the proper disposal of these forms or therefore lack of... <br>  <br>  People are giving out more than just their numbers without much of an after-thought...  <br>  <br>  Safety is an illusion ...  Maybe not giving out a number decreases the odds, but if all this other information is given freely ... it sort of defeats the arguments in the paranoia of just giving out a number, doesn't it?|`|YQrKQ5PAaa	Whoaaaa. Talk about uneducated?<br>  <br>  I might as well print out that page and let my little cousins prank call all of these idiots. *Cheers for free long distance*<br>  <br>  :D|`|0f7ba60c4b5854ac551f8222ad3afdf1aa	Not crazy, just stupid.|`|52VDjbNTaa	That is absurd!<br>  I only give it to people I trust...<br>  =D
51fe01ef6db0c1bd743afcb3e7a2e1ffaa	I believe you. I, too, know some who have turned away.<br>  <br>  Those who promote the once saved always saved false doctrine are only looking for an easy way out.|`|tO9QjrEkaa	The truth is, religion is just a social club. If you are not a member, then you are lower than them. The one true purpose of ALL RELIGIONS is the belief that you are better than everybody else.|`|NZ0mRaG3aa	Do you still have strong loving feelings towards Jesus? If they are still there you probably were a christian. Indeed you may find God still regards you as one, whatever you may think, because you crossed over, and basic 'positional' salvation is by grace (but you may find you don't get rewarded as well as would be the case if you don't come out of the faith).<br>  <br>  I'm assuming you're a lady and maybe am reading more into the 'girlfriend' remark than was intended, but would say it is possible to have strong desires that are enjoyable that might make us turn away from Jesus for a while, although it is possible for God to transform our natures if we really desire it so that we are united with Jesus' nature.|`|jBYxEX8taa	So part of why people turn away from GOD, is because of man? How unwise. That's basically rejecting God to His face.<br>  <br>  Basing your belief in the Christian God over hypocrites is simply silly. It just shows that people "go with the crowd". He's a bad "Christian", so now I'm not following God anymore. Little unfair to God, don't you think?<br>  <br>  Edit; Exactly. And how many of the "followers" of God are actually following God? How many Christians who say they are Christians actually are? Look up the definition of "Christian". I'm sure you've read the teachings of Christ, since you say you used to be a strong believer. You should know better than to base beliefs on frauds. Rather base it on Jesus Christ if you can't trust men who claim to follow Him.<br>  <br>  But if you don't want to follow God, then that is your choice. I don't attent church with other Christians. I don't even have solid Christian friends. I chose Christianity on my own, because I read Jesus' word and it felt right to me. I'm not about to turn away from it over a hypocrite who says he follows Christ but doesn't. If in doubt, I read what Jesus said and ask "Is that person doing what Jesus said?".|`|AA11719394	Well I believe that God will not dishonor your choice of 'NOT' choosing Him just as He honors your choice of CHOOSING Him. The choice is yours and Salvation is free, but if you don't really want it I honestly don't think He is going to force it down your throat. Go figure!!|`|XzXpDPpfaa	Because it conflicts with their religious beliefs.|`|3ccd31e0b38f18f3123974ce88fcb948aa	Because SOME Christians cannot see things the way that you do.|`|liGflTmjaa	they may not hate truth but they miss it|`|2X58PDrfaa	So are you scolding those christians who behave like that, or asking a question? <br>  <br>  By the way, you yourself are scaring non-believers and painting God a not nice picture. Don't be trapped in your own little world of religion. Balance your thoughts. Try to understand a mind of a non-believer. I am a Christian too. and it doesn't help if you are so stubborn. I'm not saying you have to give in on your beliefs. But, just be less religious. Even God gave them free will. who are you to force?|`|FOzN3xwzaa	Did you believe, in faith alone, that Jesus is the only way to be saved?  That you cannot add any of your own works, and if you do add your own works, then you are not saved?  Did you believe that Jesus paid for ALL YOUR SINS past, present, and future?   Did you believe that salvation is truly a FREE GIFT? <br>  <br>  Did you believe that it is impossible to lose salvation, no matter what? <br>  <br>  If you didn't believe these things, then you didn't believe the Gospel anyway.  You can believe it at any moment and be saved  :)|`|NsHV4O8oaa	yeah, there was a guy yesterday who said that the people who wanted to make him reject christianity were mainly christians<br>  i've gotta admit, many who claim to be christians don't live up to that 'label' - not to say there aren't christians out there who believe sincerely and wholeheartedly as you once did<br>  nevertheless, there is a large amount of people giving christianity a bad name|`|Zgs4RncIaa	" I can't prove it though. I don't need to."<br>  <br>  Touche<br>  <br>  *EDIT* I feel the same way I don't owe anyone an explanation for my beliefs. YOU aren't going to get me through the gates of Heaven, Only God can do that!|`|AA10192697	God is Truth. Period
2X58PDrfaa	No such thing as ex-christian. Once a Christian, forever, a Christian. You canNOT undo yr salvation.|`|THRtsl83aa	There's a pretty substantial difference between having a belief and then changing your mind about it, and doing an act and then not doing it any more.|`|WalnRzfGaa	people just say that to demonize people that realized that Christianity is just absurd to believe in.|`|EpqSDAGyaa	Hi Myth Bomber<br>  <br>  This is what the bible tells us about that <br>   <br>  14 The sower soweth the word. 15 And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts. 16 And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness; 17 And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake, immediately they are offended. [1] 18 And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word, 19 And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts [2] of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful. 20 And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred.|`|ZDDya5Ibaa	Thats totally not true anyway, its not even worth talking about. I was catholic until I was 18, and I was definitely a christian. I believed whole heartedly, I really did. People change, their beliefs change too.|`|Ynsow6qbaa	Yes, I was a Christian for 15 years an atheist for 4 or so more and am now a Christian again so obviously i am a Jew being an ex-atheist and an ex-christian.|`|mrzeXJ6Eaa	quitters.|`|tJr8aFDpaa	You are comparing two things that are completely different in nature. smoking is a physical habit, while Christianity is a spiritual entity. the nature of a "true Christian", theoretically, is such that he holds firm to his beliefs, and continues to walk in the path of Christ regardles of what life situation may come his way. this is often compared to a "nominal Christian", who is Christian only by name, but not by practice. with regard to smoking, however, one can simply quit the physical habit and become a non smoker. there is really no such differentiation as a "true smoker" and a "not-so-true smoker". the difference is that there is theoretically an absolute state of commitment associated with the Christian belief, but no such absolute state of commitment is attached with regard to smoking.|`|TEX1iYQgaa	If your parents disowned you like they should have, does that make them no longer your biological parents?<br>  <br>  If the answer is yes, then the only way that could be true is if you never really were their "true son."<br>  <br>  Do I really need to connect the dots for you? Take off the sunglasses and the hoody, and rub your pointed little head. I'm sure you can figure this out...|`|uurTX7POaa	ah, yet another logical fallacy offered by you to bash Christians. You took logic at Yale or Princeton ? your brilliance blinds, it is a pity it is obscured by your mindless drooling...|`|70OClBEQaa	ha ha good point i guess ex-smokers like ex-christians cared more about their life than mortifying themselves with death<br>  Smoking and Religion = Death<br>  Ex smoker and ex-religion = Safe|`|AA11503457	The reality is there are ex-true-Christians, you seem to be more aware of that fact than many Christians are.|`|io7nHB3Oaa	Well in fairness, in my case I was much more adamant a smoker than I ever was a Christian.|`|0f7ba60c4b5854ac551f8222ad3afdf1aa	Exactly. :)|`|81SiImlSaa	We have a winner!<br>  <br>  now let's watch the rationalizations shall we?|`|03rOCajTaa	how does that make  not Truly a christian earlier in life<br>  you had faith and you lost it for what ever reason<br>  isn't that kinda like saying<br>  if you sinned you are a Christan|`|jCcsDdvYaa	Not at all. Smoking is a reality. Religion is a fallacy.|`|kLSH344Daa	false dichotomy|`|ZxrWOyNVaa	nice logic|`|dDprsKZYaa	"...what does that make ex-smokers..?"<br>  <br>  Worse nags than non-smokers?<br>  <br>  <br>  ...just sayin'...
X548yCR6aa	I guess doctors are holy men, by that logic.<br>  <br>  The fight diseases, pardon, demons, all day long.|`|jdRKZe18aa	Yes but in another similar incident when His disciples were unable to heal a sick individual and they came to Christ and asked why - He made it clear it was because of their lack of faith....<br>  <br>  I think the reference you make here is to be similarly interpreted.<br>  <br>  ILLNESS and sickness are NOT indicative of sin or evil unless a person is sick BECAUSE they have allowed sinful behavior affect their health, like with alcoholism or addiction.  BUT that would just be a consequence of their choices not a reflection on just being evil or sinful.|`|urIm4YaBaa	In that case, you must admit that it's amazing that demonic possession has gone down in perfect unison with advancements in medical technology. Even if we ignore the fact that physical chemicals shouldn't interact with supernatural entities (at least, not with any consistency), the correlation would still be virtually impossible.|`|cO8b7Pniaa	I do to and it is funny that you mentioned it. God created everything perfect and in His own image. If he is perfect, then everything He makes is pure shiny gold. He can't make diseases, those things come from the devil along with demons.|`|paRGbr7Xaa	Only people who don't understand how germs and the body works attribute ill health to demons. In other words, anyone who's taken a basic, middle-school level health class shouldn't be dumb enough to believe supernatural things are making you sick.|`|dDprsKZYaa	Only superstitious idiots.
4ab8439e5bb68131be2c8b6ff9ed3557aa	I don't have the same thing going on, but I remember when I was younger I felt genderless.<br>  <br>  There's nothing wrong with feeling genderless... some people are 'genderqueer' and just don't feel like they really belong to a certain gender. It's not dirty, and you're not odd or a weirdo for feeling that way. It's just how some people are.<br>  <br>  But if it's bothering you, you need to address it; a gender therapist could really help. There's nothing wrong with you, and it's not a problem per ce... What IS a problem is your feelings about it. Work on feeling strong, confident and empowered-- a gender rebel, if that helps you feel better about it.<br>  <br>  I included some links for you below.<br>  <br>  Cheers.|`|ZwXgwB5maa	Sounds as though your gender confusion may have something to do with your "woman phobia".  You should go through this with your counsellor, <br>  <br>  Don't worry too much about the dressing thing, I'm a straight girl who hardly ever dresses "girly", I'm just more comfortable in jeans & a tee-shirt, but happily female.|`|XkE36LDgaa	I don't think your a weirdo :)<br>  <br>  Your gender is a personal matter and I'm sure some people feel in the middle or neither.<br>  <br>  All I can say is; be you. Maybe dress more boyish one day and feminine the next. Don't worry about it.<br>  <br>  You say your straight so at least you know something for sure. <br>  <br>  You may want to talk to your councilar about the feelings and come up with some things on your own on what you want to do. <br>  <br>  Maybe dress feminine and cut your hair short? Just an example. <br>  <br>  In all; just be you and don't be afraid. It's not weird for girls to swtich up classic gender clothes and outfit... and adding some girly flair is a nice change. <br>  <br>  Just be able to talk to someone about things that you might think or come up with it.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|03f6d70aa511193e6f0a3fd450df20e2aa	Sort of. See, I'm a lesbian who...Let's just say<br>  that I am girly, but I also love guy clothes. <br>  Anyway, just do what you feel is comfortable, <br>  and don't listen to anyone else. (:|`|UbvglIS6aa	There is a book called Gender Outlaw: On Men, Women, and the Rest of Us by Kate Bornstein.  I recommend you read it.  She talks about her own gender identity and how she's dealing with it.<br>  <br>  I think it might help you to begin to understand yourself.|`|MYIwyTpcaa	you are, what you are , what you are. Most men probably don't go around always thinking "I'm a man..I'm a MAN..yeah!" I know I don't, I just AM me. I occasionally may be reminded of my gender when I go to the bathroom or get a spontaneous erection, but it's not something I am cogniscant otherwise. In short, dress like you wanna dress, act like you wanna act..Don't be embarassed, dirty or like a weirdo.you're simply human. Enjoy!|`|uvo24D2gaa	gosh man just coz u like wearing men clothes and woman clothes that makes you genderless now?<br>  <br>   ur a girl born one why are you even thinking about your gender?? its straight foward if you ask me penis=man , vagina+boobs=woman <br>  <br>     and please dont go on about transexual people coz thats not the point|`|NH30zxckaa	Not the clothes are so important .Only if you usually get dressed in man suit. Just don t become gay. You will upset God.You should trust your self more.|`|n2HaCqHwaa	Yes, and just been approved today to have my hormone levels tested at the local hospital tomorrow, so am quite excited. I'm 36 and male btw so this has been a long time coming. Always had this theory that lack of male hormones was responsible for a lot of my issues, but didn't really know how to deal with it or have courage to tell anyone in real life. Anyway, now we shall see.<br>    When I was 10 years younger, I enjoyed being a bit androgynous, but at 36, I want to settle down and form a solid relationship and this is getting in the way. I am a little scared of how I will turn out if my testosterone levels are increased but feel there would be a lot to be gained from it, if tests show an increase is needed.<br>    You have some very good responses to this question: I am reading with great interest what some people have written or provided links to. Sorry for sounding old: it's because I am.

7ce29aaaa2e67395ec835e75e3a79530aa	I never personally did.  I have never been attracted enough to the male body to even try it. For many years I thought I would remain celibate all my life since I couldn't justify how I felt with my religious upbringing. But regardless of how evil my thoughts supposedly were, praying and being very involved with the church and missions groups didn't change what I truly felt and needed, to be happy.  <br>  <br>  I don't however begrudge or doubt those who say they are bisexual. I truly believe I was born attracted only to women so how can I question someone else on their attractions. And for those who say they are bi and then decide they are really gay or lesbian, I fully sympathize with their coming out process, we all learn to accept ourselves at our own pace and own way. Many would fault me for not at least 'trying men' because 'how can you know you don't like something you have never tried' ... I can't explain it any more so than I can explain why I am attracted to women, I Just Know, just like I know I am not attracted to all women.|`|S4XUl7qWaa	No, I've always known I was bisexual, regardless of the gender of my partner or society's level of acceptance. Nothing like coming out in a religious fundmenalist family, and it's not any easier whether you're bi or lesbian.<br>  <br>  Saying you don't agree with bisexuality is pretty closed minded, don't you think? I get as tired of the anti-bi bias from the lgbt community as I do of the anti-gay bias from the straight community. Yay, being bi means you get sh!t on from both sides.|`|PzxUeGDCaa	I did. Bisexuality is viewed as hot by alot of high schoolers today. Im far from bi. I only like women and once completely out i was much happier, although ppl dont quite get it bc now theyre like "how were you biand now suddenly gay" Its hard to explain that ive always been gay.|`|0f7ba60c4b5854ac551f8222ad3afdf1aa	I've been bisexual for seven years, that's a long time to transition. I really do like men and women. As the saying goes: I'm bisexual, you're confused. I don't care if you like bisexuals or not.

I would venture to say it's probably more men that do this, as if being bisexual is more acceptable in society than being gay.<br>  <br>  I went from telling people I was straight, to admitting I was gay.|`|30b5fac62378b9be69757aa6b696edf4aa	I did...it sucked, and I am much happier now.  Although, when I came out (even though it was as bi) I was only 12 and that was many years ago...it was much easier, things are so much different now than they were 23 years ago.  It is too bad, that so many young people feel like they have to resort to that : )
AA10641825	You got a problem with that?<br>  <br>  Exodus 3:21, 22 also.  <br>  God told them to despoil the Egyptians.  <br>  Ever wonder where church folks get their morals?<br>  .<br>  .|`|uFyycbjiaa	Nope. They didn't steal.<br>  In fact, the last plague before the death of the firstborns was that of darkness. If they wanted to steal or flee wouldn't this have been the perfect time to do it?

Since when was that stealing or cheating?|`|AA10102190	No, Exodus 12:35-36 teaches a spiritual truth about salvation, in order to understand the truth we must understand the following first:<br>  <br>  1. In the Bible Egypt represent the sinful world.  <br>  2. Jews spiritually represent all the people that God promises to save.<br>  3. Gold and silver represent the true believers.<br>  4. Exodus is a historical parable that teaches about God's mercy and salvation.<br>  <br>  Once we have to above down we can understand the following as:<br>  <br>  Exodus 35  "And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: "<br>  <br>  The children of God follows the will of God to leave the desire for the world and follows God.  Taking jewels of silver and gold means that they are helping to convert and bring other believers along as they follow the will of God.  The raiment is the raiment amongst the world that God will save. <br>  <br>  Exodus 36  "And the LORD gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them such things as they required. And they spoiled the Egyptians."<br>  <br>  God will give protection onto His children as they live in this world.  And by "they spoiled the Egyptians" it means that the true believers are witnessing against the un-believers in the world by following the will of God.|`|5jiguSODaa	No. The secret to reading the Bible is you can not just read one verse and think you know what it is saying. You must read the verses before and after. In fact read all of that chapter. You also should study the history of the time. Sometimes things in the Bible aren't what they seem because the changes over time. Then read it again to see if you missed something the first time.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	NO-- what more to say. NO, obviously --except to you (and THAT does require explaining).|`|AA10192697	No, it says that the Israelites ASKED for these things and the Egyptians GAVE it to them.

1ffb5797d2e26ccb8eb17dd3db6e22c0aa	Thank you for understanding the REASON for a Saint name / Confirmation name. <br>  <br>  A couple of kids here on Yahoo Answers R&S section have asked <br>  "what sounds "good" with my name?"  then they proceed to tell us their name and what Middle names they think sound "cool" with theres.<br>  <br>  Clearly they are missing the point. <br>  <br>  Thank you for actually listening in class and understanding the POINT.<br>  which is to at least TRY to model your life after them.<br>  <br>  I also think this is a good time to learn a bit about some of the AWESOME Christians who lived long ago and some of the amazing things they did.   Some of their life stories are TRULY amazing. <br>  <br>  The Internet, aka Google,  makes this incredibly easy. You can probably read about 5 or 6 saints in as little as 10 minutes, thanks in part to the internet.  hehehehehhe<br>  <br>  I'm surprised your Catechism teacher didn't give you a list of websites.

St. Francis is the Patron Saint of Animals and the Environment.  He is usually portrayed as being surrounded by doves and rabbits. <br>  <br>  St. Anthony is the patron saint of lost causes or lost things.  Supposedly if you ask him to help you find things.. you often times do.<br>  <br>  St. Isadore is the Patron Saint of the Internet, Libraries and Teachers because he founded a bunch of libraries in Spain and helped to spread information around the world.<br>  <br>  St. Sebastian is the Patron Saint of Athletes.  - He was very fit and was a Captain in the Roman Army until the Emperor had him executed.  The Emperor's Archers fired dozens of arrows into his chest...but 2 days later he was STILL alive and eventually recovered.  As soon as he was healthy,  He immediately spoke out against the Emperor's treatment of Christians as the Emperor's coach road by his house.  The Emperor responded by having a group of his him grab Sebastian and beat him until he eventually died.<br>  <br>  Here is a list of Female Saints...<br>  <a href="http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=119" rel="nofollow">http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php...</a><br>  <br>  I like St. Flora..  she resisted her parents attempts to find her a husband,  entered a priory (convent) and spent most of her time in prayer.  On one occasion she was raised 4 feet off the ground in front of everyone, during prayer,  and her hands were pierced by nails (similar to the wounds of Christ on the Cross) <br>  <br>  Then there is ALWAYS Joan of Arc  <a href="http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=295" rel="nofollow">http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php...</a><br>  <br>  St. Tersea of Avila -- loved romance novels.

w8gBWpKTaa	Perhaps you are just wise beyond your years, and not willing to change just to get a bit of attention.. Many girls just put themseles out there on a plate because they want to be 'loved', and find it difficult being happy on their own. It's sad, and despite what they really think, boys often go for these girls because its easy sex, or they're either too shy or stupid to make the effort to get to know someone genuine. An exception to this is often the ugly boys, who aren't blinded by superficial atitudes and so go for the nice girls.<br>  You know your pretty and a nice person, so just be happy with that :)<br>  Rise above it, and one day the right guy will come along.. that is when hes grown up a little bit|`|bb06GQ5Paa	Maybe you aren't as pretty as you think you are.  Or maybe your attitude makes you unapproachable.|`|DooJ5iDGaa	Saying you know you are "prettier" than your friend is kind of an alter ego . I would say give up thinking about how "pretty" you are. I think you make limits because you have in mind your physical appearance, throw aside how pretty you are or you aren't, impress yourself and once you manage to satisfy the way you look for your own taste , you will impress others.|`|FknQXMzRaa	I used to ask this same exact question and wondered why I only attracted uglies.<br>  <br>   Then I discovered myself and saw that i don't need anyone to think I'm pretty except me !!!|`|vOwfC1SJaa	I am surprised these "UGLY" guys  see anything in you.

The Spanish in Mexico is not quite the same as the Spanish in Spain.<br>  <br>  Depending on how you define the term "leading language" it could currently be either Chinese or Spanish.  As for English being the dominate language of business...  let's see where Wall Street keeps heading before we start making predictions about the next 100 years.
ZPmqYNuwaa	Just because your attracted to her doesn't mean you can't be friends with her.  Are you capable of being friends with men?  If so this should be no different.  If it's specifically her that you have very strong feelings for that she doesn't have you may never have the same friendship again.  You don't need to stop being bisexual, you need to learn to talk to people as friends even if you find them attractive.  I'm a straight girl but I can hold conversations and can be close friends with men I find attractive, you just need to find that balance.|`|0f7ba60c4b5854ac551f8222ad3afdf1aa	As time goes on, friendships change and sometimes fade away.

KmULmT7Baa	No, it bothers me that god is man made.|`|s7pqFa1eaa	Yeah, but they believe that their god either wrote it or inspired humans to do so, and they think that their god is infallible.<br>  <br>  Pity them, for they are deluded!|`|gsTpQmGfaa	I believe it is highly possible that Jesus was mixed in with other myths in order to get people to follow that particular religion.<br>  <br>  Because as we know, the snake gave knowledge to mankind (therefore, anything that went against the religion as presented in the bible was considered "sinful") and who would want to go to hell? If someone told you you were going to hell, it just might scare you enough to follow that particular religion. Also, Jesus seems to have many similarities to Mithra among others.<br>  <br>  So, either he existed and his teachings were twisted by the Roman empire, or not at all. I suggest this video in the "source".|`|rBCQBHSHaa	Sure there are evil people and very likely some parts have been changed by people in order to try to control others.. But the message from Jesus is always the same no matter what.. Love God, and Love your neighbour.. <br>  <br>  You need to accept that Jesus died for your sins.. because NO ONE is perfect, and rather than suffer death for the things we do.. Jesus stepped up and made sure that we all had a chance. Believe, get baptized, and turn away from your sins.. If there was never a flood, it has no bearing on Love God and Love Thy neighbour.. The stories in the Bible are to teach you how God dealt with people.. Teach you how to live your life.. It's all about Love..|`|2X58PDrfaa	Yes. So always ask God for the final say.

jHWpNL9Iaa	I agree, it's pretty hard to understand how so many could believe something that sounds so obviously made up.|`|OLnmXeWDaa	The more you learn about the whole history of the founding of the Mormons, the more bizarre it gets.<br>  <br>  The plates were in 'Reformed Egyptian' which no one else could read. And no one has ever seen before or after. It's kind of an odd language for a bunch of Hebrews to write in.<br>  <br>  Smith translated most of it by putting his head in a hat and not even having the plates in his possession.<br>  <br>  One of his followers broke off and started his own church. He also translated from plates and people believed him too. There were witnesses, etc. Of course, the plates were easily shown to be a total sham. <br>  <br>  Anyone can up metal plates. One of Smith's early cohorts was a printer who used copper plates in printing all the time.|`|xyIZv6iiaa	After translation of the gold plates, Moroni also showed the plates to three other men, Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, and Martin Harris. They bore testimony - which was never retracted and often affirmed, even after persecution and in spite of personal apostasy from the Church. <br>  <br>  Besides the three witnesses, nine other people either participated as scribes or observed the translation process, including Emma Smith, Elizabeth Ann Whitmer Cowdery, William Smith, Lucy Mack Smith, Michael Morse, Sarah Hellor Conrad, Isaac Hale, Reuben Hale, and Joseph Knight Sr.  However, it is possible that some of these may not have seen the plates directly.<br>  <br>  Eight others were also shown these plates by JS - Christian Whitmer, Jacob Whitmer, Peter Whitmer JR, John Whitmer, Hiram Page, Joseph Smith Sr, Hyrum Smith, and Samuel Smith -They also never retracted their testimonies of such, even though some left the Church and would have had ample reason and opportunity to expose a fraud, if it had been one.|`|LuN1unJ3aa	There were eleven witnesses to the plates. Some left the church and notably, they made a point of making sure that people understood that they truly saw the plates, even when they were dying.<br>  <br>  The cited article on an apologist Mormon site will explain just what kind of evidence is out there.|`|ythN9BQgaa	ROFL! Sorry but when I read this question I thought of the South Park episode when the Mormons were telling the story about Joseph Smith and the background music kept saying "Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb!"<br>  <br>  Anyway, I have to agree. It sounds so made up. I bet if a guy did the same thing nowadays, they would be like "yeah right" I find it funny though... sorry<br>  <br>  I never met a mormon (not surprised) but if I do I am going to discuss religion with them all day long.|`|CptQVbzGaa	Well, it makes as much sense as every other religion.<br>  <br>  Also guys, she is an atheist, so stop calling her a hypocrite for believing something she doesn't believe.|`|i444oWjjaa	If you are anything other than an atheist, this question is extremely ironic.|`|K8QTdUnfaa	faith|`|AnW3dzQfaa	How come you believe in the bible?

DFwvcUnhaa	I would mention to her that you are interested in the job.|`|tdulyzXXaa	I would suggest that you indicate your interest to her in a casual way and ask her what she recommends. She already knows you, so her decision will not be based on your resume. If she wants you, she will ask you to put in a resume. If she doesn't, she will probably discourage you from applying. <br>  <br>  The weirdness of the situation is that if she hires you, she loses a babysitter, so it might be a good idea to suggest alternative babysitting arrangements should you be hired. All of that being said, in this economy, one should push any advantage that one has, and a personal relationship with the hiring manager is a huge advantage.|`|xnsU60hhaa	Definitely mention to her that you are interested and plan on sending your resume to her office.|`|16vMIGPiaa	If you were pulling this job possibility out of the newpaper, you'd call ahead to learn if the job is still open and who to send the resume to.  You have a leg up in this case because you know the person you'll be applying to.  Talk to her first; let her know you're interested in the job.<br>  Remember to keep the two situations separate in your head.  Be professional when applying for the job.  Be professional when interviewing for it.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

WwCBomTMaa	I find that it is best if you learn from those who have different beliefs. I have learned a lot from people who believe different than me, and even though I don't agree with their beliefs I don't think I have found one religion (aside from Satanists) that is all bad. Even Christianity has it's bad points (and bad apples that foul the Christian name). I do know quite a bit about other religions, but I am still learning too. I have even learned quite a bit from Atheists (not a religion). There are some Christians that believe that any other religion is barbaric. It's a very sad thought process, and one that unfortunately cannot be fixed. So I just try to lead by example and hope that other Christians will follow suit.<br>  <br>  Have a great day!! :)|`|Zgs4RncIaa	Honestly, No I stay focused on my own religion.|`|tx4bRDrXaa	Because of the self-centered and independent way of thinking,of Buddhizm the result is a veritable labyrinth of legends, traditions, complex doctrines, and interpretations generated by the many schools and sects over the centuries. What was meant to bring a simple solution to the complicated problems of life has resulted in a religious and philosophical system that is beyond the comprehension of most people. Instead, the average follower of Buddhism is simply preoccupied with worshiping idols and relics, gods and demons, spirits and ancestors, and performing many other rituals and practices that have little to do with what Gautama the Buddha taught. Clearly, seeking enlightenment without God does not work.<br>  Jainism rejects a creator, teaching that the world has always existed. It lays particular emphasis on the doctrine of ahimsa.It contends that everything is essentially a matter of viewpoint, thus ruling out absolute standards of right and wrong. This points up the tolerant attitude of Hinduism, from which Jainism sprang.This is just about what everybody today believes in isn't it,Without putting a name on it?<br>  If you didn't study other religions how would you know if your religion was the truth ?(John 8:32) and YOU will know the truth, and the truth will set YOU free.”<br>  What does the Bible really teach ?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.jw.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.jw.org/</a>|`|j6GVLXgDaa	well, not all religions|`|4AxBMYpUaa	doubt it.|`|jcK6EXpiaa	Honestly, many "christians" I have come into contact with don't even know much about Christianity, let alone other religions. They just know the story of how Jesus came into being, or some version of it, and ask god for help when they need it. The ones I have met on y/a tend to be the most educated and devout Christians I have ever come into contact with. Really, even my own siblings (who identify as christian)  know less about Christianity than I do, and I am not even Christian any more. There seems to be this sort of condescending attitude toward religious people here in america, even from people who claim to have the same beliefs. So, it doesn't surprise me that they don't know anything about other religions except for what they see on the news.|`|5WIZowKOaa	Common sense dictates that God would have one true religion. Everyone should look into as many as possible if unsure in order to have accurate info. Only then are you in a position to make a decision. Most look into other religions in order to argue who is right. If approached with an open mind and heart you cannot fail!|`|sy7ytm9Kaa	I have 3 decades under my belt in the higher study of world religions... 2 of those were in practice of a handful of those I studied.<br>  <br>  Nice generalization on percents there.  Shows how much thought you put into the post.  Therefore I am putting equally as much thought into my response.|`|81SiImlSaa	I doubt it since most of them don't really know much about their own.  If they actually practised what Christ preached, Christianity would look and sound very different from what it is today.|`|LUiiAlsJaa	I have never met one who did yet, they don't even seem to know anything about their own religion|`|AA11605393	Why would Christians NEED to know about any other religion? There is only one God!!!  And yes, Christ is the answer!|`|yk7jmSnDaa	I do and i really do my research on them too. I don't know much about Buddhism though.|`|XkidpdPWaa	That Christian didn't but please don't judge us as a whole.|`|AA10102190	I do know something about other religions.  I didn't start out as a Christian, in fact I was born into a Buddhist family, flirted with Satanism and witchcraft for a little while, then I turned into an atheist during college, and finally a Christian, which I still am.<br>  <br>  I can't say I am an expert on Buddhism or other religions, but I do know something about them.<br>  <br>  As to if I think other religion/culture without Christ are barbaric?  All I can say is this, when I was with those other religions before Christ I felt as if I was walking in an endless desert, and that I was always thirsty for the things of this world, and I never had peace.<br>  <br>  I would go to sleep dreaming about money, and waking up hating my life because I wasn't as rich as I wanted to be, or as handsome, or have as many women, or there is something I want that I didn't have.  There was always something I wanted and I just couldn't stop thinking about them until I finally got them.  Then there is always something else I wanted... Also I was easy to anger and I hated anyone that irritated me.  Like will I was driving and someone cuts in front of me I would hate them so much that I wished they were struck dead that instant. Life was very dry.<br>  <br>  Not even Buddhism helped.  When I was a Buddhist, I wished that the people I hated would go to hell and never reincarnate.  Or if they do, they would reincarnate into cows or pigs and get slaughtered.  And then I wished that I would reincarnate into a rich family in my next life after I die and get all the money and things that I wanted.<br>  <br>  After experiencing many different religions before God gave mercy to my soul, I find that Christianity finally gave me peace.  I don't have desires for the things for this world anymore and don't love money, and I don't lust after women, and I have never slept better at night in my life.  I don't hate other people anymore, and I'm rarely angry now.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't say that other religions and cultures without Christ are barbaric, but they certainly made me barbaric.  It is only through Christ do I finally feel at peace.|`|gf3CCvuUaa	Christianity has promoted peace and war at the same time. Early Christian communities were peaceful and non-violent. It was not until the Church gain tremendous political power in the middle ages that it has become corrupted and even started the Crusade War.<br>  <br>  But then again, without Christianity, maybe tribal isolated culture like the ones in deep Africa or Pacific islands would be still barbaric. The Christian missionaries has served their part in reducing barbarian attitudes, don't you think?<br>  <br>  And about other religion. Some hard-core closed-minded Christians are. But most of Christians are tolerant and are very aware of other religions.|`|8gnp5Kkjaa	No.  I know absolutely nothing about any other religions and choose to remain ignorant about them so I can come on Y!A and piss non-Christians off with my redneckitude.<br>  /sarcasm off<br>  <br>  That's a dumb question.  Of course there are Christians that know about and have probably extensively studied other religions.  The ones that say things like the person you quoted probably haven't even studied Christianity, not to mention any other faiths.|`|q8bfGbLZaa	Yes we know about other religions but we only choose to follow one because there is ONLY One God!

I could go on attacking the inconsistencies of the Vardas, Tibetan Buddhists in Beijing burning insense to 3 faced Hindu gods and Chinese "demons" or the actions of the Dali Lama that is supposed to be a Buddha incarnation and yet is fighting for power and position in Tibet....<br>  <br>  <br>  The historicity and the integrity of those LIVING the Christian faith and the Bible convinces me that the God of the Bible and Torah is the only God and that Jesus paid for the sins of those willing to believe and repent.<br>  <br>  Prof. Daniel B. Wallace (wrote the textbook on ancient Greek & Greek translation) in an interview in the book "The Case for the Real Jesus" says  "It's disturbing that when it comes to the Christian faith, people don't really want, or know how, to investigate the evidence", have you ever looked at the evidence?<br>  <br>  <br>  I think that you will find that Jesus is the son of God and the Saviour (Messiah/Christ) as written about 700 years before Jesus was born in Isaiah,<br>  Isaiah 53<br>  5 But he was pierced for our transgressions, <br>         he was crushed for our iniquities; <br>         the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, <br>         and by his wounds we are healed.<br>  6 All of us like sheep have gone astray,<br>      Each of us has turned to his own way;<br>      But the LORD has caused the iniquity of us all<br>      To fall on Him.<br>  <br>  and as written by John the Baptist in John 1<br>  29The next day he saw Jesus coming to him and said, "Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!<br>  ...<br>  34"I myself have seen, and have testified that this is the Son of God."<br>  <br>  <br>  May more find that narrow path.|`|l6Jew1qAaa	I cannot speak for All Christians...only myself. I have studied other religions/philosophy most of my life, from the time I was able to read almost. (OK, so Dr Seuss came first...then religion.) There are so many similarities as far as morality goes...like loving one's neighbor, taking care of the planet and the life God gave us, respecting God (or a "Higher Power"). You find similar teachings in virtually every religion.<br>  <br>  I personally, as a Christian, do not believe that other religions/cultures without Christ are barbaric. I just think they are missing something very important. The Son of the Living God. Other than that, there is nothing wrong with most of them. As I stated before, there are many similarities among most of the religions you mentioned. Judaism, Kabbalah, Islam, Buddhism, Jainism, Hinduism, even the Native American tribal religions (don't know the "ism", sorry), and Wicca.<br>  <br>  Isn't it interesting that most religions have very similar moral codes and value systems? Like taking care of the planet and all living things on it, taking care of your self and your family, caring for your fellow humans, being nonviolent and nonjudgmental... How can anyone argue against such things?<br>  <br>  So, in answer to your question, Yes, some Christians do know about other religions. And some even recognize the value and good things that can be found in other religions and cultures. But we are also very aware of the fact that these other religions are missing the main ingredient...Jesus.<br>  <br>  What is it about Christianity that makes some of those who are not Christian despise it so much, makes people so angry?  Why should atheists care one way or the other if someone else chooses to believe in God? I understand why Christians care whether others believe in Jesus, that is part and parcel of the religion...it is an edict to share His teachings with the World. Share...then let people decide for themselves whether to believe or not to believe...and go in peace. Other religions proselytize, so why is it when Christians do it, people get angry and defensive? Perhaps it is simply that Christianity touches a nerve that many people would rather  avoid...

In terms of carvings made while Alexander was alive, there aren't any. We have two sculptures,  a Statuette of Alexander with a Lance (Now Missing)<a href="http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artObjectDetails?artobj=8118" rel="nofollow">http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artO...</a><br>  that was made about 100 years after Alexander's death, and the Azara Herm, <a href="http://www.livius.org/aj-al/alexander/alexander_z8.html." rel="nofollow">http://www.livius.org/aj-al/alexander/al...</a> Both are copies of sculptures of Alexander that were ALMOST certainly made by the Greek sculptor Lysippus, but both are just copies of other sculptures, not done from life. Both were done long after Alexander's death. Therefore neither one of these meet the criterion you set out for Jesus above.<br>  <br>  The same is true for written accounts of Alexander as well. The best work we have on Alexander is The Campaigns of Alexander by Arrian. Arrian was a second century Greek historian (i.e. he was writing over a century after Alexander died) whose work about Alexander were based on the writings of two of Alexander's generals. However those writings are lost to history now. (A skeptic like yourself might ask if they ever existed at all, though respectable historians have no doubt that they did.)<br>  <br>  Now you might say "Well Alexander wasn't a God", but his contemporaries would disagree with you on that point.  Alexander WAS worshiped as a god in the ancient world, but his  body mysteriously disappeared, and his tomb has never been found. (We think it was in Alexandria, but we don't know.) <br>  <br>  So by your logic, Alexander the Great did not exist. You just proved it. Apparently it was all a fraud made up by his Generals....<br>  <br>  Might want to tell your history teacher.

I think there was a Jesus who was a good man who preached a simple life, charity, basically being good to one another which is such a simple yet profound message.<br>  <br>  I think he was humble and thought of himself as a teacher at most....he never considered himself a leader or above others or anything more than a teacher of the path.....so he did not aggrandize himself he did not want people following HIM but following the MESSAGE so for him it was all about the lessons...not him.<br>  <br>  It was not until after his death and the romans adoption of Christianity that Jesus "became" divine and became the sole focus of the religion instead of his actual teachings.<br>  <br>  So now we have a religion that shows a barbaric depiction of a man hung on a cross (I think Jesus would be horrified that churches made that a symbol), is all about pictures and statues of Jesus and yet for the most part worships the man not the message.<br>  <br>  It's too bad.<br>  I have always had way to much respect for Jesus and his teachings to do him the disservice of becoming a Christian|`|XHCoIo3zaa	Not having an image of a historical figure does not mean that the person did not exist.

q7z7Ni3Daa	This term originated in the streets. By that, I mean urban areas where the socioeconomic realities of everyday life lead to a large amount of crime and violence and struggle to overcome. Being a soulja boy, or a soulja girl for that matter, is a term used for a person who comes from such a background and for whom every day is a fight. Whether the person fights as part of the violent environment or against it is something that is debated in the meaning, depending on whom you ask.<br>  <br>  Its spelling is not due to a lack of literacy as much as it is a deliberate attempt to distinguish this word from soldier, a person fighting as part of a military group.<br>  <br>  A soulja boy is not paid to fight and did not volunteer to fight. Fighting is a part of who he is and where he comes from. He has no choice but to battle, so he embraces the battle and does so with "soul."<br>  <br>  The young singer Soulja Boy chose this name as a symbol of where he came from. Some people considered it pretentious, and many people who used the term long before him felt like it detracted from the meaning to have him using it. Either way, many people have bought and played his songs, so I don't think he really cares too much about either group.<br>  <br>  Take care!<br>  <br>  Edit: The funniest thing about the answers here for me are the people who criticize the spelling of soulja, while making grammatical and spelling mistakes themselves. Of course, that's very typical of social elitists who consider their own mistakes insignificant or their intentional misspellings as purposeful but attribute those of others to illiteracy or ignorance. Just a reminder, when you are trying to push people down so you can look down and make fun of them and maybe gain some false sense of superiority, look up for a second.

1TT9oiO0aa	Hmmm. It sounds to me like she's definitely interested! The body language sounds quite powerful and if you were flirty and took each other's number and asking if you had a boyfriend was so obvious it was because she wants to know your orientation. <br>  <br>  You say you aren't a lesbian and that is obviously fine, but are you bisexual or open-minded? If you aren't any of these three then there is no point pursuing this any further because you wouldn't want a relationship with her and it'd be cruel to her feelings. But I think because you've taken the time to ask this question on here and you're thinking about her sexually, I think it's safe to say you're probably bisexual? <br>  <br>  I think you should definitely respond to the text. Just put something like "I had a really good time, would you like to go out next week?" or something like that. Or even just put at the end "how are you?" so it means she has to text back and hopefully the text messages will keep on rolling etc and you might get to know of her intentions. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|03f6d70aa511193e6f0a3fd450df20e2aa	1.

I would say it is more allegiance of non-believers against believers/organized religion as opposed to an allegiance of non-believers.

Since Wicca isn't all about the magick, you could easily start by honoring the god and goddess, or the earth itself. Enjoy nature, revel in it's beauty. Become connected with the earth. Help the earth through recycling or the like. You can work on meditation, grounding, centering. All of these are necessary to become balanced. You can also do basic magick that doesn' require a candle, incense, or anything more than a paper and pen. If you want, you can email me, and I can give you more info if you like, but these are some places to start.|`|SDDgbtQ4aa	Wait, I'm a little confused.  You have two books on Wicca, but you don't know what to do without candles and "stuff", yet you claim to be a Wiccan?  Hmmmmm.<br>  <br>  First, I would suggest at least a year of more in depth study about Wicca before dedicating yourself to such a path and claiming the title.<br>  <br>  Wicca's focuses are on building a relationship with the gods, attuning to nature and the natrual cycles of the year, and living an ethical life.  You need not "buy stuff" to do any of these things really.<br>  <br>  So, what kinds of things can help you feel more connected spiritually, what activities can you get involved in, etc.  Be creative - you can incorporate Wicca into your everyday life, just as you can take almost any activity you enjoy and incorporate it into your spirituality.<br>  <br>  Here's some ideas to get you going.

AA11047076	I Judaism celibacy has always been seen NEGATIVELY!  The mitzvha of p'ru u'revu- be fruitful and multiply, is binding on EVERYONE. Everyone regardless of job or rank is expected to amrry and have children  In fact, one cannot be considered to be fully righteous if you are not.  Anyone reading the Tanakh can see this- Sarah despairs at no having children and tells Abraham to take Hagar to have children with so he can fulfill the itzavah and Sarah can be inolved through Hagar;  Channah the mother of Samuel the prophet goes to pray to have children when she is barren.  and there are others.<br>  <br>  So, the Jewish leadership- the Judges and prophets then; the Rabbis today, have always gotten married and had children|`|AA12245463	The very first commandment is to be fruitful and multiply.  The first rabbis appeared about 200 BCE.  At that time, boys became adults upon marriage.  An unmarried man would have had NO followers whatsoever!<br>  <br>  Marriage is vitally important in Judaism, and refraining from marriage is considered unnatural. Marriage is not solely for the purpose of procreation, but is primarily for the purpose of love and companionship.<br>  <a href="http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1204127202753&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull" rel="nofollow">http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?c...</a><br>  <br>  “…In many ways Amitz Koah is reminiscent of Milton's Paradise Lost - but with a difference. Milton writes: "Of man's first disobedience, and the fruit of that forbidden tree, whose mortal taste brought death into the world, and all our woe..." It may be that all of this is Judaism's way of countering the Christian concept of original sin and of making sure that we do not consider marriage and sexual relations as somehow connected to sin. It is not accidental then that Adam and Eve are mentioned in the marriage ceremony and the birkat hamazon recited at wedding feasts in such a positive way. It is another indication that as far as Judaism is concerned there is no "original sin." Adam and Eve did not bring about "all our woe." Their union was not connected to sin. They are merely symbolic of all human beings who begin as innocents but soon fall into disobedience and sin.”   Reuven Hammer  <br>  <br>  Christianity idealized non-family life in the epistles of Paul:  “It is well for a man not to touch a woman.  But because of the temptation to immorality, each man should have his own wife… I say this by way of confession, not a command.  I wish that all were (celibate) as I myself am” (1 Cor. 7:1-7).  By contrast, the ancient Rabbis of the Talmud taught that one of the first things asked of a soul in judgment after its time on the earth is, “Did you fulfill your duty with regard to establishing a family?”  A man could not become the Jewish High Priest unless he was married (Yoma 2a), and a man could not be a judge of the Sanhedrin, the Jewish high court, unless he had children, “since they teach him compassion.”  Rabbi Shmuley Boteach|`|Ovj7Nf25aa	The very first official priest was Aaron, the brother of Moses, and Aaron was married.

(Psalm 36:9) ‘When the morning light takes hold on the ends of the earth,’ God says, ‘the earth transforms itself like clay under a seal, and things take their station as in clothing.’ (Job 38:12-14) With increasing light from the sun, earth’s features take shape and become clearer, just as soft clay undergoes a transformation upon receiving an imprint from an emblem on a seal.<br>  <br>  Jehovah is also the Source of spiritual light. (Psalm 43:3) While the world remains in dense darkness, the true God continues to shed light upon his people. With what result? The Bible answers: “The path of the righteous ones is like the bright light that is getting lighter and lighter until the day is firmly established.” (Proverbs 4:18) Increasing light from Jehovah continues to illuminate the path of his people.

All prophecies in the Bible have come true are now and will continue to the end. Only God knows the exact moment the end will occur. Everything happens for a reason. God sheds light on His word as He sees fit and in the time frame he picks. It is us who jumps to the wrong conclusion.

Few things are more distressing to the human spirit than the thought that life has no meaning, no purpose. On the other hand, a person who has a clearly defined purpose in life is resilient. Viktor E.?Frankl, a neurologist and a Holocaust survivor, wrote: “There is nothing in the world, I venture to say, that would so effectively help one to survive even the worst conditions, as the knowledge that there is a meaning in one’s life.”<br>  However, there are numerous and conflicting opinions on this subject. Many feel that it is up to the individual to determine for himself the purpose of life. By contrast, some who believe in evolution teach that there is no ultimate meaning in life.<br>  Really, though, the most logical way to discover the purpose of life is to consult the Life-Giver, Jehovah God. Consider what his Word has to say on the subject.<br>  What the Bible Says<br>  The Bible teaches that Jehovah God had a specific purpose for man and woman when he created them. Jehovah gave the following command to our original parents.<br>  Genesis 1:28. “Be fruitful and become many and fill the earth and subdue it, and have in subjection the fish of the sea and the flying creatures of the heavens and every living creature that is moving upon the earth.”<br>  God purposed that Adam and Eve and their children make the whole earth a paradise. He did not intend that humans grow old and die; nor did he want mankind to harm the environment. However, because of the poor choices made by our first parents, we have inherited sin and death. (Genesis 3:2-6; Romans 5:12) Even so, Jehovah’s purpose has not changed. Soon the earth will be a paradise.—Isaiah 55:10,?11.<br>  Jehovah created us with both the physical and the intellectual capacity to fulfill his purpose. He did not create us to live independently of him. Note how God’s purpose for us is defined in the following Bible passages.<br>  Ecclesiastes 12:13. “The conclusion of the matter, everything having been heard, is: Fear the true God and keep his commandments. For this is the whole obligation of man.”<br>  Micah 6:8. “What is Jehovah asking back from you but to exercise justice and to love kindness and to be modest in walking with your God?”<br>  Matthew 22:37-39. “‘You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind.’ This is the greatest and first commandment. The second, like it, is this, ‘You must love your neighbor as yourself.’”<br>  How the Bible’s Answer Brings Real Peace of Mind<br>  For any complex piece of machinery to work properly, it must be used for the purpose and in the manner that its maker intended. Likewise, if we are to avoid damaging ourselves—be it spiritually, mentally, emotionally, or physically—we need to use our life in the way that our Maker intended. Consider how our knowing God’s purpose can bring us peace of mind in the following areas of life.<br>  When establishing priorities, many today devote their lives to accumulating wealth. However, “those who are determined to be rich fall into temptation and a snare and many senseless and hurtful desires,” warns the Bible.—1?Timothy 6:9,?10.<br>  On the other hand, those who learn to love God rather than money discover the secret of contentment. (1?Timothy 6:7,?8) They appreciate the value of hard work and know that they have an obligation to provide for their own physical needs. (Ephesians 4:28) But they also take seriously Jesus’ words of caution: “No one can slave for two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will stick to the one and despise the other. You cannot slave for God and for Riches.”—Matthew 6:24.<br>  Therefore, instead of making secular work or the pursuit of wealth their top priority, those who love God make the doing of his will their primary concern in life. They know that if their life revolves around the doing of God’s will, then Jehovah God will take care of them. In fact, Jehovah considers himself honor-bound to do so.—Matthew 6:25-33.<br>  When dealing with people, many put themselves first. Today, the world lacks peace, in large measure because so many people have become “lovers of themselves, .?.?. having no natural affection.” (2?Timothy 3:2,?3) When someone disappoints them or disagrees with their viewpoint, they give vent to “anger and wrath and screaming and abusive speech.” (Ephesians 4:31) Rather than bringing peace of mind, such a lack of self-control only “stirs up contention.”—Proverbs 15:18.<br>  By contrast, those who obey God’s command to love their neighbor as themselves are “kind to one another, tenderly compassionate, freely forgiving one another.” (Ephesians 4:32; Colossians 3:13) Even when others do not treat them kindly, they endeavor to imitate Jesus, who when being reviled “did not go reviling in return.” (1?Peter 2:23) Like Jesus, they appreciate that it brings true fulfillment to serve others, even those who may not appreciate what is being done for them.

Although some people are just naturally popular they all do mostly the same sort of things.<br>  <br>  First of being popular is a lot of work.  You have to work at it.  It means being persistant and keeping up friendships with people.  They start by being warm and friendly just to about everyone they meet. They are generally open about themseleves and share important things about themselves with builds emotional attachments in others.<br>  <br>  They also seem to keep with with popular culture, kind of study it.  They know whats in whats out.  They know the right styles.<br>  <br>  Popular people also eat a lot of crap too.  Some are not really that discrimating in who they hang around with, and those who I've seen also seem to compromise thier beliefs and values to fit in around who ever they are.

That's one way of looking at it....<br>  <br>  However, you might want to look into the REAL meaning of a Quinceanera. It's not just having presents and a party, you know.

4ab8439e5bb68131be2c8b6ff9ed3557aa	It depends.<br>  <br>  If you don't mind seeing straight people kiss, then yes, it is homophobic. Remember, homophobic doesn't just have to be the 'fear' of gay people... intolerance counts, too, and being fine with other PDoA but not gay PDoA smacks of intolerance to me.<br>  <br>  But if you hate seeing ANYONE kiss, then no, it's not homophobic. Some people just hate seeing PDoA.<br>  <br>  It's when you single a group of people out for no good reason that there's an issue. I can understand not liking PDoA, but just saying gays kissing is gross? It annoys me and I would be offended if someone said my boyfriend and I kissing was gross... while ignoring the straight people who were also kissing. :/|`|g2DRPyfPaa	Its funny how heterosexual men and women think its okay for lesbians and faux lesbians to make out in public, but its not ok for gay men to express their genuine love.  Straight men and women love lesbians kisses but hate and are disgusted by two males kissing.  They are brainwashed and encouraged by the media to have this attitude.  No one is born homophpbic, just like no one is born racist, sexist etc.,  <br>  Its homophobic and hypocritical.  Down with the straightys!<br>  <br>  When two gay men kiss its seen as "flaunting" and they would be publicly tortured, then killed, but if its two women kissing sleazy straight men and women would pull out their video cams and start taping and masturbating to it, because its seen as hot.|`|kquN54TIaa	I wouldn't use the word "sick" because of negative connotation. Just replace it with "uncomfortable."<br>  <br>  It's like my big argument for gay rights.<br>  <br>  A person should be allowed to love whoever they want. Just as long as they don't do it in front of me.<br>  <br>  Don't worry, man. I'm bi, but seeing ANYBODY kiss makes me uncomfortable because I'm bitter and lonely :P|`|tbGZnkgPaa	Yes I think it's homophobic to say but just an opinion to think it. I think straight ppl making out is UGH gross. haha! I'm dead serious. The sight of a guy and girl slobbering all over one another is just gross. I don't know what it is but it's such a turn off and just a gross thing to me! However, this time being the exception I don't go around saying it to try and make straight ppl feel bad.|`|BnIXqxtAaa	yeah it's homphobe.  guys and girls kiss out in public and not gays..discrimination!  i don't care if guy and guy kiss around me.  i'm gay though.  i don't care.  same think with girls.  if i see a guy get upset with two boys kissing, i'll kick that straight boys butt.  there is nothing wrong with that.  just a fake bible saids it that don't mean everyone go against the gay people.|`|HsSn9H5Iaa	I don't think it is that homophobic because i am gay but i dislike seeing two lads kiss, so just because u dont like seeing it infront of you doesnt mean that they are homophobic aslong as they don't have to visually see it they may be fine otherwise.|`|q5viMBDPaa	Yeah i'd say its homophobic, i'm not gay & i dont understand people that react this way, whats wrong with people of the same sex kissing?

There are a lot of people who don't like public displays of affection in any form, and some people who don't like seeing certain things.

Personally I couldn't care less, I like seeing people happy.|`|03f6d70aa511193e6f0a3fd450df20e2aa	I don't know, because when I see two straight<br>  people kiss...it makes me sick as well. <br>  <br>  ?-<br>  Lesbian.|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	I don't think that's homophobic, according to the definition of it. It's insulting and separatist because gay people are being singled out. But, what's being singled out is not that they're gay (because otherwise, they'd get sick just watching a gay person walk down the street) but that the gay people were kissing. Kissing is what's being pointed out. <br>  <br>  That's would be the same as saying something like, "seeing fat people eat, makes me sick. " It's insensitive yes, but there is no such thing as fatphobic, so it's just insensitive.|`|UbvglIS6aa	Personally, I prefer not to see anyone at all kissing in public.

You ask whether it's homophobic to say something like that, yet many people who happen not to be homosexual would say - or at least think - that such behaviour is not natural. The word phobic relates to fear. While many people are not frightened of homosexuals they do not wish to see what they get up to and would prefer that they do it in private.|`|paRGbr7Xaa	It depends on the person saying it. If it's a straight person who's saying it but doesn't mind seeing a heterosexual couple kiss, then yes, it is homophobic. But if it's from someone who just doesn't like to see *any*one kiss or do any sort of pda, then no, it's not.|`|bEkuN0Rwaa	Sounds like it could just be their opinion.

UH1ipgJmaa	Faith without works is in Vain.|`|yHfsHp6naa	No, it's obvious to me it's just irrational nonsense.|`|79529314dfb5ac7be366558924c3393baa	Faith itself isn't something you do, it's a mental state. You can just sit there all day doing nothing and still have faith. Faith is just defined as conscious, deliberate bias towards a particular viewpoint, and you don't have to make physical actions in order to have that bias.<br>  <br>  As for whether or not you can get into Heaven if you just sit around doing nothing...well, that's a different question, isn't it? Faith and going to Heaven are not one and the same...particularly because it is rather easy to imagine a universe in which there are people who have faith, but no actual Heaven. In fact, our own universe is probably of this sort.|`|bdf815178b6b27bc8977f0ec0b69e7a2aa	Faith allows good works,  everyone is called to holiness|`|1ffb5797d2e26ccb8eb17dd3db6e22c0aa	You are correct.  The bible talks a lot about faith AND works.  <br>  There is a verse in Timothy which says literally.. "faith without works is empty" <br>  <br>  Most Christians in fact do believe this..but  looongg ago, to differentiate themselves from the Catholic church they developed a new doctrine called "sole fide"  or "faith alone"  -- in this NEW doctrine, faith is the only thing that saves you. Works count for nothing.  People who follow this are keen on pointing to a verse or 2 which says that our works are but dirty rags to God  and that all fall short of the glory of God.  They argue that you can't "work" your way to heaven.  They claim that the Catholic church is a "works based religion"  -- another wards,  "do x,y,z and you are guaranteed to go to heaven. <br>  <br>  SO.. if they believe in ONLY faith in Jesus alone..then does that mean they think we can rob, steal, lie, cheat, etc. ??  <br>  <br>  NO,  not at all.  They say that anyone who does such things is not truly "saved" does not have "Jesus in their heart"  -- They believe a true believer will DO works BECAUSE of faith. <br>  <br>  They believe that FAITH is what saves and the works come naturally from that faith. But it is the faith not the works that matter.   Faith is the tree, works are the fruit. <br>  <br>  So.. in a round about way they DO believe works are necessary. They just don't state it that way.<br>  <br>  <br>  A Catholic would ask.. can you be an Apple tree and never produce fruit?  If not, then producing apples is INTRINSIC to being an apple tree. .. right?   Some would argue no, you can still be a fruitless apple tree.  <br>  <br>  In a nutshell,  Catholics simply don't make the arbitrary distinction.  They see that 3 things are INTRINSICALLY needed to have salvation.  1) Love,  2) Faith, 3) Works. <br>  <br>  The greatest of these is LOVE.  If we have love of Christ and of God, it will lead us to Faith.  IF we have love and faith, then we can't help ourselves but to do his work here on Earth.  Love is what compels the works.  <br>  So Catholics simply see all 3 as intrinsically linked and therefore saying Faith saves, works come naturally,  is silly.  All 3,  love/faith/works are needed.  <br>  <br>  Faith without Love/compassion is empty and legalistic.  Love which does not compel us to do work is selfish and not true love.<br>  Faith and Love without works are empty as well.  <br>  <br>  If you REALLY look at what both sides are saying...they are REALLY saying the same thing.  They are just wording it differently.   Sole Fide christians (AKA Protestants) would say that the Catholic view focusses too much on works and not enough on a relationship with Christ.  -- Which is partially true.  SOME Catholics DO focuss too much on "being a good person" and not on their faith. <br>  However,  Catholics would counter that "sole fide" focusses too much on mere faith.. on intellectual ascent,  on merely "feeling" like you are good and not ACTUALLY doing anything about it.  - Which is true.  SOME Protestants do have only a very shallow faith and don't actually live much of a christian life. <br>  <br>  So there are Pros and Cons to BOTH ways of stating it.  The key is that BOTH are essentially hitting at the same concept from different angles. <br>  <br>  It sounds like on the surface you tend to lean more towards the Catholic view of salvation. <br>  Love, Faith and Works,  all intertwined and necessary.|`|JCGtfNeTaa	All of us has sinned (Romans 3:23) and deserve death (Romans 6:23). None of us is good. (Mark 10:18)<br>  <br>  Faith is not true faith if it is void of works. In other words, faith without works is dead. When we repent of our sins and give our lives to Christ, we become new creatures (2 Corinthians 5:17). In other words, we no longer participate in the drug-dealer lifestyle, or the murdering lifestyle, or a sinful lifestyle of any kind. Not that we become instantly perfect, but that is not the lifestyle we lead anymore.<br>  <br>  But faith is more than mere mental ascent (mere belief). True faith includes good works and a changed life.<br>  <br>  <br>  See James 2:14:26:<br>  <br>  What does it profit, my brethren, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can faith save him? If a brother or sister is naked and destitute of daily food, and one of you says to them, “Depart in peace, be warmed and filled,” but you do not give them the things which are needed for the body, what does it profit? Thus also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.<br>  But someone will say, “You have faith, and I have works.” Show me your faith without your[d] works, and I will show you my faith by my works. You believe that there is one God. You do well. Even the demons believe—and tremble! But do you want to know, O foolish man, that faith without works is dead? Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered Isaac his son on the altar? Do you see that faith was working together with his works, and by works faith was made perfect? And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, “Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.”And he was called the friend of God. You see then that a man is justified by works, and not by faith only.<br>  Likewise, was not Rahab the harlot also justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out another way?<br>  For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.|`|s9IO0g7Xaa	I think it is both. I can't go rape someone and then say, well I believe in God and Heaven, so no big deal. It also works the other way, I can't just act very generous and crap and expect to go to Heaven. I don't believe in any of it, so from an un-bias standpoint, if your going to believe in God, you should probably follow the certain rules as you put it.|`|pqveENjUaa	Some churches teach that accepting jesus as your savior gives you a free pass to do whatever you want, but most churches have found the fallacy you are pointing out and teach that living a good life is fundamental to entering heaven. They teach that you need both.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	Grace and works are OPPOSITES (Romans 11:6). <br>  <br>  If you think you must add to Jesus's PERFECT sacrifice on the cross, then you don't understand what Jesus did there, and you don't believe Jesus.<br>  <br>  Faith is BELIEVING something to be true.  Read the interaction between Jesus and Martha in John 11.  Jesus asked Martha if she BELIEVED in Him for life.  She said yes.  Jesus NEVER tested her "works".  JOHN 11:25-27<br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT!  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!|`|2X58PDrfaa	What i've learnt is that, without believing that Jesus is your saviour, you will not go to heaven.

70a201d41704c2115cb56b74e112e905aa	You went to college with the wrong intentions, like me and other people do. You went because of the promise to make a lot of money. You thought with this degree, I can make a load of money, more than someone with a high school diploma. Well, it is not always like that here in the U.S.A. Where I work in Los Angeles, the jobs are either for those with high school diplomas and GED or those with Master and Doctorate degrees. Hardly any jobs with just a Bachelors degree. My boyfriend who has a Bachelors in Psychology can't get a job where I work. You know what, he is doing a job a person with just a high school diploma and experience can do. I don't have my degree yet but I'm still going to work on it because of the career I want, not money. What employers look for in candidates is job experience. A lot of college students never work during their 4 years at college, or they never attempt to get internships pertaining to the career they want. I was lucky to have experience in high school working as a Human Resources Student Secretary during all my summers. Although I was interested in Psychology and Early Childhood Education, I also became interested in Human Resources/Personnel and plan to have a career in that area in the future. Right now I want a career as a Paralegal and plan on gettting a degree in Paralegal studies. Paralegals make a lot of money approximately $60,000-70,000 or more a year. The economy is bad right now and a lot of jobs are laying off people, and would explain why they are on uemployment. I know it's tough hang in there. It took me years before I landed a permanent job. I've only been working permanent for only a year, before that I was doing intermittent and temporary work and barely making enough to take care of myself. But now I plan on buying a car (I just got my license too and I'm 26) and plan on moving out of my parents home. It is hard right now, stay close with your friends and family to help you get through this tough time, ok. Good Luck :)|`|S4R82Xoqaa	The reason no one feels sorry for you because , its about millions of college grads going through the same thing .

This is tuff world and it doesn't have time to baby anyone , nor would it wait on you to pick your face up . I mean I guess your at a library  , so thats why your able to use Yahoo right . Or maybe you do have a computer that cost  a lot a money so your not that bad off; IF you do have one sell it or use it to find a job.

Nyz8VtCyaa	Well I can tell you this: My dad and my mom (whom are divorced), went through a huge, long custody battle over me, their son. My mother wanted full custody. I wont get into detail as to why this all went to court, but I know that if your son wants his children back enough, that he's willing to put hour after hour on end into his argument (in case this comes to a court matter), that he has just as much of a shot as anyone else who prepares that much. My father eventually won in court and now we are back to the way things were before Katrina, which is 50/50 custody of his child. If your grandchildren are approaching or are of the age of reason (7 yrs.), they might need some help to get through this whole thing. I know I did. But best of luck to you and your son, and I hope that the final outcome is the correct outcome.|`|59821ioeaa	A friend of mine went through this, you have to go and file for grandparents rights just as if you were filing for custody. It might take a while and they might tell you that your son cannot be there when you have visitation with your grand-kids. If you do try and sneak him into your visit time, they could take your rights away altogether. Good luck|`|LU7yg6Ejaa	u have rights as a grandmother for access...my friend fought for half custody and won..fight it..the courts dislike vengefull parents|`|bb06GQ5Paa	I'm not a grandparent or even a parent.  But, it's sad that young people today do not appreciate what older folks can offer.  My grandmother died in 1989.  I was only 12 at the time and looking back, I miss her so much.  I cherish the times when she would take us walking in the woods looking for plums and berries for her homemade preserves.  Oh, they were so good; that lady could cook!  Or gathering eggs out of the chicken coop.  For some reason, those chickens wouldn't peck her but they would tear me up!  And, she would get so mad at us because my cousin and I had a bad habit of riding her pigs out in the pasture.  I wish I had been a little more mature myself so that I could ask her about her parents, who had already died, and what life was like back in the 20's and 30's.  I could have learned so much.<br>  <br>  So, I sympathize with you.  In the long run, it's going to hurt the children and it's tragic that the parents refuse to accept that.  When you have children, it's not about you anymore, it's about what's best for the kids.|`|AA11166769	Well, I'm assuming that if your son has parental rights, he also has the right to allow his children to visit their grandparents on his side of the family. Is this not the case?|`|nwnILcEAaa	When I got divorced, I let my ex-mother-in-law and ex-sisters-in-law know that they were always welcome to visit with my children because they had been good to them. It is hard enough to lose a parent through custody battles, but for the kids to lose aunts, uncles, cousins and grandparents, too is very difficult. Hope it doesn't come to a court fight for you because there are not many laws that benefit a grandparent.|`|b3h0ovgRaa	In my state grandparents have no rights when it comes to their grandchildren. If your son wants you to see his children you can. He may not get custody but he will have visits with his children and you can see them then. When the children are with him the mother cannot interfere with what or who they visit. They are his children too.   Poppy|`|80lWqRFiaa	I have never done so, but if it came up, I would fight it tooth and nail , down to my last dollar. Good luck to you.|`|G4vFjh0yaa	I understand your point and that is why I remained in contact with my daughters ex and parents. I think the familial bonds are so important.<br>  <br>  For me to subscribe, however to a philosophy that the custodial parent should not have a right to say no to visitation in certain environments is unfair to a mom or dad who are trying to protect their children from certain negative values that may harm them. And that opens a box of variables to consider.<br>  <br>  While I am sure that you are a fine family and that you love your grands this is a matter for the parents to work out through the courts.<br>  Or an impartial arbitrator. 10 hours a week is very limiting and that I would fight tooth and nail to change and there is nothing that would keep me from seeing my grands or my kid. No matter how much bending I had to do. It is just a fact that if there is a will and all things considered equal and safe that a court is not going to punish the children.<br>  <br>  As we know grands benefit from the nurturing of grandparents that are responsible. It does hurt them to not know that love and guidance.<br>  <br>  I wish you great luck and much time with your grands.

Historically and in a modern context, it is chiefly used as an ingredient in desserts throughout Japan, but in the past century has found extensive use as a solid substrate to contain culture medium for microbiological work. The gelling agent is an unbranched polysaccharide obtained from the cell walls of some species of red algae, primarily from the genera Gelidium and Gracilaria, or seaweed (Sphaerococcus euchema). Commercially it is derived primarily from Gelidium amansii.<br>  <br>  Agar (agar agar) can be used as a laxative, a vegetarian gelatin substitute, a thickener for soups, in jellies, ice cream and Japanese desserts such as anmitsu, as a clarifying agent in brewing, and for paper sizing fabrics.<br>  <br>  Chemically, agar is a polymer made up of subunits of the sugar galactose. Agar polysaccharides serve as the primary structural support for the algae's cell walls.|`|VfWbiw1kaa	you need to seriously stop joking about god it's not cute nor funny, and in the end you will see.

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist?

The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6.

In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46).

Why do so many laymen feel like they're suddenly experts when they're confronted with Evolution?<br>  <br>  1st, sulfuric acid didn't evolve; it's not a living thing.<br>  2nd, not all mutations convey an advantage.  It's unlikely epilepsy conveys any advantage.  The fact that it still exists, today, is most likely due to the fact that it hasn't proved to be enough of a disadvantage to be weeded out of the gene pool by natural selection.|`|TzY9vkinaa	I think of things evolving when I think of evolution|`|1aa8b20a9151f0263c0e250dfc8c3448aa	I think of a very long period of time...millions and millions of years.

However, it does go against the principles of the 1st and 2nd laws of thermodynamics, and has changed entirely from the theory originally proposed by Darwin due to evidence proving small sections incorrect at once.|`|5BVZWhusaa	Intelligent Design is the absolutely true and totally scientific theory that the Universe is so mind-bogglingly complex that it could only have been designed and constructed by an equally, if not more complex, "Intelligent Designer", whom we shall call the "Creator". It might be the Christian God ...but it's not likely; more likely is Fred Savage, or maybe even Chuck Norris and we're not telling! That's what makes it scientific.[1] <br>  <br>  Please note, in reverence to the Christian God, even though this has nothing to do with the Christian God, Intelligent Designer should always be capitalized. [2] If you refuse to capitalize it we’ll smite you in the name of sweet Jesus. <br>  <br>  This Creator might not have been a creator at all, but rather a committee of creators. Therefore the official theory makes absolutely no reference to a Christian God. In fact, the theory was run through a word processor which also checked for all common misspelllings, so this is an absolute certain fact!<br>  <br>  Intelligent design was conceived by the highly-respected[3], completely unbiased, scientific genius William Dembski of the world-renowned Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, a highly prestigious and respected University of Louisville, Kentuckistan. Dr. Dembski is an eccentric genius and was shunned by lesser members of the scientific community as a result of petty jealousy of Dr. Dembski's great skills. <br>  <br>  Some biologists, like the highly religious Ken G. Miller of Brown University [4], Rhode Island, claim that since Dr. Dembski is a mathematician, he shouldn’t claim to be a major authority on biology. Some of Ken’s graduate students, like Brian Griffin, are actually animals rather than humans (Brian is actually a dog)[5]. This is because Ken is in fact a mad scientist.|`|qY9svA3taa	No.  I do not see how sulfuric acid or epilepsy relate to evolution.  Maybe you are thinking of the iron sulfur world theory?

8TrS5r3daa	I will answer your question point by point. I am 30 years old and a TV producer. Sources: Education, Travel, Fact I speak 4 languages, work experience.<br>  <br>  A) From our elected and appointed officials? - Not lately. Reason: This nation is SUPPOSED TO BE a representative republic. That means that our officials are chosen by the people to represent OUR interests. Not THEIR interests. However, lobbyists and special interest groups intercede on behalf of everything from whales to gophers with cancer and direct public and private money to those special interest groups. In my opinion, that is not fair and just representation. PEOPLE make up the voting public of the United States, not philosophical constructs or little animals. Represent the PEOPLE and you do your job. Represent the special interests and you are a THIEF.<br>  B) From the private sector? - Not lately. CEOs steal from their own companies and have no idea how to manage people anymore because Political Correctness has essentially made most people too scared to even try and speak to one another in an open and honest and friendly way.<br>  C) From our foreign policy? - Nope. This nation has to decide if it is an EMPIRE or a REPUBLIC. An empire goes around the world trying to take land. March our armies over the face of the Earth or, bring them home and keep them home and maybe even begin to shrink down their size and capability. That money could be used to build roads and schools and hospitals and things people need to live.<br>  D) From our efforts to earn a living? - This depends on YOU. Not on the government, or your parents, or your boss. YOU. Work in this country has deteriorated into a game of semantics. Who said what to who. It is like watching a gigantic high school classroom filled with gossip. Professionalism has been replaced with office politics and I can see why this would discourage younger members of the USA's workforce to want to stay home and play video games and do drugs. If your leaders don't LEAD YOU, then why work for them.<br>  E) From our family? - Depends on your family. I personally do not feel bad for people whose parents are divorced. Mine stayed married. I am engaged. I get married and I will stay married. Commitment is commitment. If you can't make the commitment to get married, then don't. No one is going to judge you because you want to stay single. That's your choice. But, if you're single and 30-35, don't be surprised if people choose to spend time with their spouses as opposed to you. It's what married people do. They are boring on purpose.<br>  F) From our doctors? - Doctors are ruled by the insurance companies. Insurance companies do everything in their power to make sure that YOUR CLAIM does not get filed. This saves them money.<br>  G From our educational system? - This is my favorite topic. I was a teacher for 6 years in public schools and universities. NO! YOU DON'T GET WHAT YOU DESERVE. Standardized tests brainwash people. "No Child Left Behind" did exactly the opposite of what the name of the program implies. It left ALL the children behind. If you graduated high school after 1997, then it's not your fault. It's not Bush's fault either. You can blame his former Secretary of Education. She designed the policies that tried to enslave your minds and worked on dumbing you down so that you would be easy to control. Don't get angry. Just accept it, move on, and forget they ever existed.<br>  <br>  Kudos to whoever wrote these questions. They are poignant and insightful, and questions that must be answered over and over again.<br>  <br>  I will pose one back to the asker of this question: What is the nature and role of government in your life.<br>  <br>  For me, the answer is: As little as possible.<br>  <br>  For some, the answer is: As much as possible.<br>  <br>  Where are you on the spectrum?|`|dtCF36Psaa	A. I don't believe we get anything but greed.<br>     B. If you mean employers, I think they try to treat good employees well, but often cannot afford to provide what they would like to, like health insurance.<br>     C.  You have got to be kidding - Not since World War I.<br>     D.   I wish I could say yes, but I don't believe we do.  Good employees are seldom rewarded because they just do the job.  Bad employees are always threatening some sort of legal actions.<br>     E.  Not as often as I believe that we should because of jealousy and greed.<br>     F.  There are good and bad in all fields, I think that there are now to many medical plans that are driven by the pharmaceutical  Co. and to many people in medicine that do not speak English well enough to understand or be understood by English speaking people.  I have to request that I be treated by a person who's primary language is English to I can understand them and feel I have received appropriate treatment.

AA11615514	I don't ever recall thinking to myself, "Should I like girls or should I like boys.? You know, I think I'll like girls." So if as a heterosexual I didn't wake up and decide NOT to be gay it seems reasonable to say that gay people don't choose to be gay. I suppose you could choose not to engage in gay sex just like someone could choose not to engage in heterosexual sex. That would only make you a celibate gay person since not having sex with people of your own gender doesn't make you straight. If we don't choose our sexuality then it must be something we are born with. If we are born with it and we believe in God (or some Supreme Being) then being gay or straight comes from God. If something comes from God how can any of us be so presumptuous to condemn it?|`|cVewVL0Taa	Definitely NOT a choice.<br>  <br>  I cannot help that I am attracted to women, I have tried and tried and tried not to like women...dated men and just found myself extremely unhappy.

I don't get why its important to know how a person came into their sexuality.

There is also variation, with degrees of bisexuality, that I think highlights how it is a normal and natural variation, just as some people are amibdextrous, and can use both hands.<br>  <br>  There has been some research, and most seems to reflect that people are born with their inherent sexuality choices somewhat predisposed.  As with many genetic traits, just having the gene coding may not give a 100% exactly fixed outcome, but it makes for a greater probability.  Even eye colour is determined by more than one gene so, in my opinion, is something as fundamental as sexuality likely to be determined by many genes, which could also explain how there are subtle variations amongst all people.   It might also mean that factors, other than our genes, influence sexuality, which may include pre-birth conditions etc.<br>  <br>  Those who say it is a choice never seem to want to be asked how they chose their sexuality,  which would mean that they were bisexual, and thus had a choice.  <br>  <br>  Most gay and bisexual people I've met seem to understand that they've known their sexuality from an early age,  so we may as well take their word for it, as these people have a better understanding of how they work than others who are different could.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. Good luck! Rob|`|06aceb1d90d3755e9049c8a9a59210ddaa	Had I been given the choice I would have opted to be straight.  Do you know how hard it is to find gay guys with similar interests where I live?<br>  <br>  Anyway, the fact that it seems to relate to brain structures that develop prior to birth seems to suggest you are in fact born with your sexuality.|`|f00589104255977086e57a356d925224aa	NOT a choice.|`|EBt6Wbqpaa	choice, I know I chose.

It may denote intense hostility, sustained ill will often accompanied by malice. Such hate may become a consuming emotion seeking to bring harm to its object. “Hate” may also signify a strong dislike but without any intent to bring harm to the object, seeking instead to avoid it because of a feeling of loathing toward it. The Bible also employs the word “hate” to mean loving to a lesser degree. (Ge 29:31,?33; De 21:15,?16) For example, Jesus Christ said: “If anyone comes to me and does not hate his father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own soul, he cannot be my disciple.” (Lu 14:26) Obviously Jesus did not mean that his followers were to feel hostility or loathing toward their families and toward themselves, as this would not be in agreement with the rest of the Scriptures.—Compare Mr 12:29-31; Eph 5:28, 29,?33.<br>  <br>  God’s law to Israel stated: “You must not hate your brother in your heart.” (Le 19:17) One of the requirements for one presenting himself as an unintentional manslayer and seeking to gain safety in the cities of refuge was that he had not held hatred toward the one slain.—De 19:4, 11-13.<br>  <br>  Hate One’s Enemies? Jesus’ counsel to love one’s enemies is in full harmony with the spirit of the Hebrew Scriptures. (Mt 5:44) Faithful Job recognized that any feeling of malicious joy over the calamity of one intensely hating him would have been wrong. (Job 31:29) The Mosaic Law enjoined upon the Israelites the responsibility to come to the aid of other Israelites whom they might view as their enemies. (Ex 23:4,?5) Instead of rejoicing over the disaster of an enemy, God’s servants are instructed: “If the one hating you is hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he is thirsty, give him water to drink.”—Pr 24:17,?18; 25:21.<br>  <br>  The idea that enemies were to be hated was one of the things added to God’s law by the Jewish teachers of tradition. Since the Law directed that the Israelites love their neighbors (Le 19:18), these teachers inferred that this implied hating their enemies. “Friend” and “neighbor” came to be viewed as applying exclusively to Jews, whereas all others were considered to be natural enemies. In the light of their traditional understanding of “neighbor” and in view of tradition that fostered enmity toward the Gentiles, it can readily be seen why they added the unauthorized words “and hate your enemy” to the statement in God’s law.—Mt 5:43.<br>  <br>  The Christian, by contrast, is under obligation to love his enemies, that is, those who make themselves personal enemies. Such love (Gr., a?ga′pe) is not sentimentality, based on mere personal attachment, as is usually thought of, but is a moral or social love based on deliberate assent of the will as a matter of principle, duty, and propriety, sincerely seeking the other’s good according to what is right. A?ga′pe (love) transcends personal enmities, never allowing these to cause one to abandon right principles and to retaliate in kind. As to those who oppose his Christian course and persecute him, doing so in ignorance, the servant of God will even pray for such that their eyes might be opened to see the truth concerning God and His purposes.—Mt 5:44.<br>  <br>  Proper Hatred. Nevertheless, under certain conditions and at certain times it is proper to hate. “There is .?.?. a time to love and a time to hate.” (Ec 3:1,?8) Even of Jehovah it is said that he hated Esau. (Mal 1:2,?3) But this cannot be attributed to any arbitrariness on God’s part. Esau proved himself unworthy of Jehovah’s love by despising his birthright and selling it and hence also the divine promises and blessings attached thereto. Moreover, he purposed to kill his brother Jacob. (Ge 25:32-34; 27:41-43; Heb 12:14-16) God also hates lofty eyes, a false tongue, hands that are shedding innocent blood, a heart fabricating hurtful schemes, feet that are in a hurry to run to badness, a false witness, anyone sending forth contentions among brothers, in fact, everyone and everything standing in complete opposition to Jehovah and his righteous laws.—Pr 6:16-19; De 16:22; Isa 61:8; Zec 8:17; Mal 2:16.|`|5w3j0ugUaa	I dont believe in the Christian god but I have to say people should not treat you like that.

dc00e6f724cc094e75dc0475843d0e44aa	The same way we preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ to anyone.  We share with them our beliefs in Jesus Christ, discuss the Biblical prophesies about an apostasy from the true church of Christ, of how the true church was restored to the earth.<br>  <br>  We describe how the Bible teaches about church orgnaziation and how Christ established his church with apostles, prophets, evangelists, etc and that no church has this same organization (ie evidence of the apostasy) and that there is one church that does (the LDS Church that was restored to the earth).<br>  <br>  We talk about the Biblical passages of scripture that require a need for a prophet, how the Bible says that "God will no nothing; except revealeth his word through prophets" and how the LDS Church is the only one that follows the Bible, ie again evidence of a "restored <br>  church."<br>  <br>  We also teach about the need for priesthood, the it is given (as the Biblce teaches, by the laying on of hands) and that God has given his authority to men upon the earth to act in his name, and that the LDS Church is the only church that can trace direct priesthood authority directly back to Christ.  (No other church can make that claim)<br>  <br>  We finally teach about how Christ promised the Holy Ghost to be our companion after his ascention back to heaven, and that this "comforter" is available to all who seek it.  By prayer one can receive promptings from the Holy Ghost who teaches truth.   By study, by prayer, and by personal effort, one can ask God about which church is his true church, and as God promised, the answer will be given by the Holy Ghost.<br>  <br>  If ANYONE applies these principles in their lives, they can come to know the truthfulness of the LDS Church.  I have done this process repeatedly, and repeatedly know that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the true church of Jesus Christ.|`|jdRKZe18aa	Clearly you have some misconceptions about several things.  First of all we don't go around seeking out CATHOLICS to try to convert.  If Missionaries run across someone who is interested in what they have to offer which would imply they are seeking something more, then they are taught by the missionaries.  They are taught what we believe is God's Plan for His children from the foundational beginnings of our church <Restored truths> the plan of salvation as we know it from premortal, mortal, post mortal and eternal life.  They are taught about the Priesthood authority, the lst principles and ordinances of the gospel - which to us are faith in the Lord Jesus CHrist, Repentence, Baptism by emersion for the remission of sins and receiving the Gift of the Holy Ghost....the nature of the Godhead is included as well and many other doctrinal truths that we believe and follow.  <br>  <br>  SHOULD their interest continue through the course of these lessons taught then the missionaries would extend an invitation for them to be baptized.   It's quite simple.  <br>  <br>  The ordinance of the Sacrament is not one in which occurs in the temples by the way.  The Sacrament (or communion) is taken each Sunday in our worship service.  It is representative and remembering the atonement of JEsus Christ and provides weekly opportunity to repent and remember CHrist and remember our promises made at our own baptisms to remember, follow, obey and repent daily - as we all need.    There is no ONE type of person that is sought out to teach and attempt to convert.  Missionaries seek those with pure hearts and those who seek what we believe and offer.  <br>  <br>  I happen to be a Catholic who converted  - now 30 years ago.  I was raised a Catholic - I have several cousins who are Catholic priests... I went to confession every Saturday, and when I heard the things that the missionaries presented to me it was at once TRUE to my heart & soul and filled in all the blanks I had felt with the church I was raised with.  The Nature of Who God was in the LDS Church was precisely who I always felt God to be in my heart - and yet HE was not the God who was a part of Catholic theology <trinity>.... SO THESE TRUTHS were just true, right and spiritually HOME TO ME.  THAT is how it is for ANYONE who hears these truths and decides to convert.... catholic, fundamentalist, luthern, baptist, jewish, buddist etc.... conversion happens to people of all faiths and all nationalities across the earth.   Catholics aren't targeted - nor is anyone else....just those who are seeking something more.<br>  <br>  You know missy....if you are going to ask a question in this type of forum then you need to learn how to accept the answers given in whatever FORM they are genuinely given without offending those who answer you..  The way I read your question made me interpret it in the way I responded... THUS IS THE NATURE of this kind of communications... so chill out would ya?  I'm not on any soap box....OMG!|`|QLDMmp6Taa	They wouldn't convert me.

We encourage them to hear the lessons of the missionaries, read all or part of the Book of Mormon, and worship with us.  We encourage them to pray to God and ask him if the things that they've been taught are true or if they're false.  If God indicates through the Holy Spirit that they're true, we encourage them to be baptized and to continue learning and growing.  <br>  <br>  Different people will have different common hangups, and I think that's what you're asking about.  Just to clarify, we take the sacrament, aka communion each Sunday in our worship services and not in our temples.  Only "worthy" LDS members can enter the temples.  One is not LDS if they haven't been baptized into the LDS church.  Every member of the church is encouraged to repent of their sins and then partake of the sacrament each Sunday.  It is a renewal of the promises that we made at baptism.  If you attend an LDS service, it's most appropriate if you don't take the sacrament until you're baptized. <br>  <br>  As for attending the temple, someone must be a member of the church for one year (and generally at least 18 years old or so) before they can attend the temple.  <br>  <br>  As for converting Catholics, the challenge that I've seen personally is that so many of them have religion and culture tightly intertwined.  Many non-religious Catholics will never leave the faith because of the associated culture.  That said, there are many things that make a lot of sense to Catholics.  For example, having a prophet or the doctrine that infants who die go to heaven, not hell.  <br>  <br>  The temple ceremonies aren't exactly "secret".  It's easy to read about what goes on in the temples.  That said it's generally information that is provided by disgruntled ex-mormons, so it will have that slant.  <br>  <br>  Anyone is invited to worship with us, play with us, interact with us, or study with us.  While the covenants that we make in the temple are private, much can and is talked about.  You might read the book "the holy temple" by Boyd K. Packer.  It talks a lot about what goes on in the temple and has some great pictures.  <br>  <br>  Keep in mind, in the Bible, not everyone could enter the temple and not everyone was privy to what went on in the temple.  So, while you may not like it, you have to question your own faith as a Christian if you have a serious problem with it.  <br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|97f3e02ea0c61fb5033e4520729f2781aa	My father was staunch Catholic - but there were a number of questions he had which the Catholic church couldn't answer.  He loved talking religion and some 40 years ago, started talking to some Mormons.  He was astounded that they had doctrine and answer for his questions.  After much soul searching and prayer, he came to the conclusion that the priesthood authority and fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ rested within the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints - not the RCC.  At that time, he made the decicion to be baptized as a member of the LDS Church.  <br>  After baptism, it is entirely appropriate to partake of the sacrament [communion] at Church.  The sacrament is not performed at the temple.<br>  <br>  EDIT: no, we don't 'pay to advance' in the church.  The Lord commanded his people to tithe [see Malachi] - this commandment was also restored among Latter-day Saints.  LDS also don't pay their bishops,etc to perform weddings, etc. We have a lay clergy.  We do not pay for instruction nor can we buy positions within the Church.|`|s7pqFa1eaa	Catholics usually frighten them away, but if they stay they will pull out all the stops.

It's no different for Catholics, Baptists, Lutherans, etc.|`|FyLfEPv0aa	I spent 2 years in Italy on my mission, but the process is not that different than other areas.<br>  <br>  The misconception is that we're like Jehovah Witnesses which for the most part would like to talk to specific religions about what they do right and what they do wrong.  Conversion for them most often comes from the bible as verses are read to make points over the previous notions of belief.  The premise that they must start with is that the other person is somehow wrong in their belief.<br>  <br>  We start with a different premise.  Christians understand 99%of biblical verses in the same way, so rather than focusing on the 1% that divide us we focus on the additional revelations that God gave to us through Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon.<br>  <br>  The call is to come closer to Christ.  Take what you already have in faith and knowledge and improve it by having more words of Christ and a better relationship with him.<br>  <br>  Actual conversion is personal and spiritual and is individual as each persons seems to get the proof that God knows would convince them.  In this case it really doesn't matter what religion you are, it's the same.<br>  <br>  So our call and hope is that all come as they are and retain the great knowledge they have and keep their faith- yet as faith of the early Christians was enhanced by the addition of apostolic writings (the New Testament) onto the Law, so can our knowledge be enhanced by reading the Book of Mormon in addition to (not a replacement of) the bible.<br>  <br>  Once that personal conversion has taken place the rest is easy.  For example, I never had a single person object or have issues about tithing or the word of wisdom or chastity when we taught them because those lessons come before baptism yet after they already had this individual converting experience.  Once that experience and testimony is gained adherence to the precepts of God becomes a goal rather than an annoyance.<br>  <br>  So once you feel those feelings, Acts 19:2-7 with the disciples being rebaptised to receive the Spirit isn't a new doctrine and they'll readily accept it.<br>  <br>  For communion or the sacrament, no offense but it's not a difficult explanation that we use bread and water rather than the wafer used by the Catholic church as most really don't understand the genesis of that Catholic sacrament.<br>  <br>  There is a 1year waiting period prior to going through the temple.  The temple is a place where we make covenants with God, it's best to make sure that you're already living by your previous promises before making new ones (which are basically the same promises people have already made).  The other big reason for the wait is allow people to study and learn from the scriptures – there is no new information in the temples, only interesting items for those who know the bible already.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: tattoo - I don't know that with the history of the catholic church in indulgences that you should be throwing stones at the LDS church.  Also with learning through catachisms and a belief in mysteries of Godliness why criticise us for learning line upon line.<br>  <br>  Your question is well asked and non-confrontational, but your additional information is hypocritical.|`|77b2610047fd4e5f740d75e96c9a88a2aa	Well, to become a member of the LDS church you have to be baptized into the LDS church so yeah, you would need to have a "Mormon baptism".  You can go to church if you haven't been baptized but no, you can't go to the temple.  But you can't go to the temple for at least a year after being baptized anyway.  We take communion at church not at the temple.  We take it every Sunday.  You could take it before you are baptized although it is supposed to be for baptized members as we believe it to be a renewal of the baptismal covenants.  These things apply to anyone who joins the church whether you are Catholic, a fundie or something else.  The process is exactly the same.|`|AA10637643	Actually, it's the Spirit who converts others to the gospel, not "us".<br>  <br>  No, there is not insistance on baptism, until the person is ready and that could take any amount of time.<br>  <br>  If the person refuses to be baptized, I highly doubt they actually understand the gospel and the restoration of the Priesthood.  If they aren't baptized, they aren't a member of the church and no, cannot attend the temple.<br>  <br>  Communion - is that the Sacrament?  Sorry, not sure on this one...<br>  And we don't take the Sacrament in the temple.  The temples are for other specific ordinances - such as endowment and marriage.<br>  <br>  There is a waiting period to attend the temple, which is one year.  Again, not sure what you mean by communion.  A new member may take the sacrament at any time, at regular church services every Sunday.<br>  <br>  You say "MOST religions don't have all these secrets".... well guess what, we believe NO other religion has the fullness of the gospel, so of course NO other religion is going to have the temple ceremonies as we do.  You think it's "secret" because you don't know about it - We know it is SACRED, because we DO know about it.|`|AA11636949	If your were to convert it would start with the Missionary Discussions. THis is where 2 Missionaries(Elders or Sisters) would come to your home and teach you about the basic beliefs of the Mormon church. When you are done with them the Missionaries would challenge you for baptism. This is where you would pray about what you had been taught and choose to accept baptism or not. If you aren't a baptized and worthy member of the church you can not enter the temple. You can enter any church building you'd like. There isn't a communion in the MOrmon church. We do however have Sacrament. THis is done on Sundays during the regular worship service. Once you have become a member of the Mormon church you have to wait 1 year before being able to go to the temple. I don't think it's any more complicated than any other church.<br>  <br>  *Add*<br>  The challenge is to accept it or not. It's not like they're asking you to go through an obstacle course. They just ask you to make sure that it's something you really want to do.|`|e1a7697c7943bcffd2fa613b82800630aa	If you want to know the general points a missionary tries to convey, the missionary manual "Preach My Gospel" is available on line.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.lds.org/library/display/0,4945,8057-1-4424-1,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lds.org/library/display/0,494...</a><br>  <br>  Personally, I would not try to "convert" a Catholic, I would just teach him how to pray.  I find many (more than one) Catholics know the standard prayers like the Rosary and the Lord's Prayer.  They have a tough time learning to find their own voice.  The important thing about prayer is that it opens the heart and the mind.  If a person stayed a Catholic, but improved his communication with God, then I would have done what President Hinckley said we do.  "Bring what you have and see if we can't add to it."|`|NU06LUUXaa	Simple Dude, I don't convert anyone, I let the Holy Spirit do the conversion work. I just sit back and watch and answer questions like this one.|`|FjA3jGs4aa	shame. what a waist of a good normal person. and 10 percent of their income XD|`|8jhACvtlaa	I would get the missionaries involved, because they are called and set apart to preach the gospel.<br>  <br>  If I were a missionary teaching a Catholic family--I would probably make sure to strongly teach 3 principles.<br>  <br>  1. Christ organized His church on the Earth in the New Testament with twelve apostles.<br>  <br>  2. That church fell into apostasy not long after Christ's resurrection because the apostles were all taken from the earth/killed.<br>  <br>  3. Christ has restored His church again in these latter days and has once again called prophets and apostles and divine authority (priesthood) is once again on the earth.<br>  <br>  <br>  In your question you mention baptism.  I would think that if these 3 principles are understood, understanding baptism comes a lot easier, because baptism must be performed by somebody who has the priesthood (the authority of God to perform the saving ordinances)|`|QGLKOIlBaa	The same way God converts anyone else of any other denomination: through spiritual experiences (a.k.a. through the Holy Ghost). I served a mission in Rome, Italy for two years and I can tell you that the only thing that can convert anyone of any denomination is the Holy Spirit. The only thing that would be different would be my way of explaining the restored Gospel of Jesus Christ. For example, you wouldn't explain it to a Catholic the same way you would explain it to a Buddhist. They both have different backgrounds and could therefore hear different things regarding the same message. It's not the explaining of the restored Gospel of Jesus Christ that converts someone, though. It is the Holy Ghost that bares testimony of all truth that changes someone's heart. I could teach someone until I'm blue in the face, but it wouldn't get anywhere unless I'm worthy of the Spirit in being there to back me up.|`|lZuM2pxgaa	Appreciate the civility of your initial question. Although it's disappointing to see some Catholics on Yahoo using distortions against Mormons, my response is not an attack on your beliefs.<br>  <br>  Contrary to most Mormons, I personally don't care about converting people. I've said it to investigators of my church: don't convert for the missionaries or because we're nice or you like our potlucks or you want to marry a virgin. I want somebody strong and faithful, not somebody who quits when he reads some anti-Mormon propaganda.<br>  <br>  You seem to want specific answers to Catholic objections, so I'll just share a bit. (I was born a Catholic).<br>  <br>  I would concentrate on the things we have in common. I would compare "The Seeker's Catechism" and "True to the Faith", a little Mormon book. 9 out of 10 entries are alike. Then questions I can't get answered from Catholics...<br>  <br>  Priesthood authority: A priest answered my question here on Yahoo, but not satisfactorily. How did the bishop of Rome become head of the church while an apostle was still living on Earth?<br>  <br>  Baptism: If an infant dies before baptism, what happens? It's obviously bad, because in an emergency, a non-Catholic -even a person who doesn't believe in baptism- can baptize the baby by sprinkling some water and saying the right words. It's valid, which begs a question again of priesthood authority and importance of baptism if anybody can do it.<br>  <br>  For those who believe in the apparitions of the Virgin (which I do), I would suggest, "If Our Lady of Guadalupe chose to appear to Indian peasants, why couldn't Jesus Christ himself appear to ancient people?" (Many Mormon scholars and I believe the Book of Mormon took place in Latin America). If Mary appeared to peasants in Lourdes and Fatima, why can't a peasant boy Joseph Smith have seen Jesus or the apostles?<br>  <br>  You get the idea. If you have specific questions, I suggest going to the source, maybe e-mail is better than Yahoo. We have one Catholic guy to be baptized this month. Otherwise I've only converted one: me.

The only thing she's proven with money (the $160,000+ from her disability claim) is that she does not know how to spend it wisely.  She is an idiot with money and if you give her money, there's no guarantee she will spend it on those children.|`|tdQTZPI7aa	I do have money to donate but not to a lost cause.

You may have certain expectations, but without a written contract ("I will only spend this money on tuition for pre-school" type thing, etc) you really have no control over that money once it leaves your hands. I've given money to homeless folks I work with more than once so they could do laundry only to find out later they were sick of bag lunches from the church and hit McDonald's. Hey - I gave it to them, so it's their money and their choice what to do with it.<br>  <br>  Oh, and I don't think the octomom is capable of making a wise decision of any kind, but I am not going to take it out on her children or hate on her for being crazier than a bag of squirrels.|`|7d2faf0726d3cdb4e096e6621c45e59aaa	Our society will give this woman enough money....not for her, but to help her children all 14 of them...<br>  <br>  sorry she makes me sick....I never had more children cause I could not afford them....I have one son...who's 28 and never was able to financially have another child.  <br>  <br>  And here she is with 14 of them....and it's on society to take care of them....<br>  <br>  The doctor who implanted her should pay for the upkeep of those children....this whole thing makes me sick......<br>  <br>  I so wanted another child.....|`|r4cThgwdaa	No. I would not donate to her.

7gH7sgi6aa	Do NOT wait until the night of the concert to go to the box office as they will be too busy to help you.  Go to the box office at least one day in advance with the receipt in hand and explain your situation.

ZkBLNj6Vaa	Practice.  If you already have the basics of your abilities, then practice regularly.  Get a system where you can have hits and misses, and record your progress, and try to improve by results more than opinion.  Find other people with the same ability and compare notes.  <br>  <br>  Know your boundaries.  Getting aggressive with psychic ability can sometimes draw negative attention.  Crossing boundaries, like when someone puts up a mental brick wall and you break it, that invites trouble.  Respect the spirit, but don't trust them.  Not every one tells the truth.  Sometimes the most beautiful intelligent spirits turn out to be deceivers, just like people are screwy sometimes.<br>  <br>  Stay away from the minds of criminals.  Sometimes criminals have a psychic ability that they are aware of (sometimes more developed than you) and you don't want to be having telepathy with a personality like Charles Manson, for example.  If they mess with people in real life they will mess with you mentally; even their thought patterns are contagious, and can make you sick mentally.<br>  <br>  When you sense thoughts of live people, write them down.  I write down thoughts I can catch from people far away, and I keep them in my library.  Show your writings to the people who were thinking (if you know them) and ask them what they think about it.|`|heVrVDGEaa	Meditation almost always works.  Most people have psychic abilities, but some have it more than others.  If you feel like you're coming into contact with an evil spirit, I'd say, "I cast you out!  You're not allowed here", or something like that.  <br>  <br>  There is such thing as psychic ability and don't let anyone tell you that there isn't.  A lot of religious people (especially evangelists) will think it's evil, try to pray for you, and think you're going to hell, etc, etc.  Just don't pay attention to them and do whatever you do.  I hope I've helped.  =)

But I cannot find them. Got to be out there somewhere.|`|AAgX0SDcaa	You need to use some psychology on them. I had noise problems with two different sets of neighbors. Part of the problem was that they didn't realize how far noise travels.  One next-door neighbor at a university apartment was a loud-mouth and the minute he entered his apartment until he left was noisy and very loud, music, tv, his mouth, bouncing a basketball, etc.  I didn't say anything at first but all the neighbors were pounding the walls and yelling and he just didn't care. I waited one Friday night until he and his quiet roommate invited a couple of ladies over for a nice dinner. I heard them cooking and setting the table, their dining room wall was right next to mine.  They sat down and started talking and eating. I sat my 1948 model Pfaff sewing machine on the table next to the wall and sewed for the next 4 hours. They tapped on the wall and said "hey,hey" and all that but didn't dare to come knock on my door (I would have told them that under different circumstances I am a considerate neighbor, but if they can make noise all hours of the day and night then that means I can too)  So they got the message, actions speak louder than words and their lovely evening with the girls was not so nice and cozy.     About 10 years later I moved to another apartment complex. I had a couple of neighbors living upstairs.  One of them was loud, he would bring women up in his room and entertain them all night long....it was making my bedroom door sway back and forth. I could hear every word they both  said, and some nights I would drift off to sleep and start dreaming that there was a porno movie going on my TV.  After one of his all nighters--which lasted from 9 at night until 9 in the morning---I decided I had taken enough.  I waited until he and his party girl went to sleep, and turned on a wet-vac in my bedroom for about 3 minutes, then turned it off.  I did this for about an hour. Then I got my daughter's violin and drew the bow across the strings slowlly off and on.  And I laid my cell phone on the bed and rang it every few minutes.  A medley of strange and loud noises at intervals.   For the most part the loud noises stopped, the sex noise was kept to a minimum too and when he wanted to do something loud like play dominoes with his friends, they put their table on their balcony and played out there.   I believe that in both cases if I had politely asked them to turn down the noise to a decent level, they both would have thought I was cramping their style and bossing them.|`|CwNMq7RTaa	Do what I do.  It works every time.  Figure out when they're sleeping.  And make a lot of noise.  Enough to keep them up.  Don't say anything more to them.  Just do this.  Things will change.

I got told where to stick it the following weekend we decided to have a weekend with my in-laws on the coast. I bought a record of the Light Infantry sounds retreat. Around 5pm on the Friday we left and I put the record on and put it on so when it came to the end it would go back to the start. We returned about 9pm on the Sunday evening and I turned the record off. Above us all was quiet and after that if they had a party they would come down and let us know and it was so much different from before clearly the Light Infantry sounding retreat gave them manners.

bZo5Z53Uaa	Wsalaam<br>  <br>  1. Start off each day with 'adhkaar al-istiyqaadh' (waking up Supplications), thanking Allah for waking up in good shape.<br>  <br>  2. Put Allah first in your life.<br>  <br>  3. Broaden your horizons - learn 5 new verses from the Quran every day, travel to pray far in the mosque to brighten your day,take up a booklet having supplications and read them.<br>  <br>  4. Pray Salaat Al-dhuhaa (after sunrise).<br>  <br>  5. If someone says something mean ;to you, just shrug it off and dismiss it in a friendly, laidback manner, and pray that Allah shall forgive them.<br>  <br>  6. When you get angry, remember Allah, and how short and worthless life is to waste in being Angry.<br>  <br>  7. Remember that you can never have too many friends, but you can have few quality friends that help you fulfill the purpose of your creation (i.e. live for Allah).<br>  <br>  8. When you're happy, try to share your happiness with others. Thank Allah for that, and pray its continuation.<br>  <br>  9. When something bad or embarrassing happens to you, just think that it could always be worse, remember the reward of patience, and thank Allah that it's not worse than it is.<br>  <br>  10. Do something extra of goodness once in a while, like feeding a poor person, or caressing an orphan's head.<br>  <br>  11. Never stop believing that you can win Allah's love and thus work For it. Then you can win the love of Allah's slaves.<br>  <br>  12. Spend some time thinking of Allah's amazing creation.<br>  <br>  13. Always love those who love Allah unconditionally. This way you will ensure that you live for Him, love for Him, and hate for Him (those who are enemies of Him).<br>  <br>  14. Find the righteous ways to express yourself, and if you think that what you are about to say shall cause no benefit, maintain silence (this is tough!!).<br>  <br>  15. Every now and then, give yourself a break. Play sports, give time to your family, friends, but always remember Allah and watch that He is watching you.<br>  <br>  16. Pray for blessing to come to those being lost, and pray to Allah to guide them to the right path.<br>  <br>  17. Hug your parents, kiss their hands and heads and always obey but stop at Allah's orders.<br>  <br>  18. Smile to everyone, for your smile makes a big difference to him or her and you are rewarded.<br>  <br>  19. Forgive, forget and smile.<br>  <br>  20. Tears are not for women only... tears are for all human beings with feelings remaining in them. Don't restrain your tears when remembering Allah.<br>  <br>  21. When people criticize your actions and effort, revise your actions and see if they please Allah or no. If they do; then ignore and remember how the Prophet (SAW) and the Sahaba were criticized, made fun of and even physically harmed, so have patience.<br>  <br>  22. Read the Quran daily and try to have a schedule for completing it as much as you could. As you open the Quran daily, read with observing not just passing your eyes through the words.<br>  <br>  23. Don't let popularity go to your head, for it never lasts and you may lose from it more than gain.<br>  <br>  24. Never look down on anybody, for, to Allah, they may be better than you.|`|mOWyzwubaa	There are only Muslims mentioned in the Quran. <br>  <br>  The Quranic Iman can not enter a Sectarian Heart. It can only enter an open heart. <br>  <br>  "And that those on whom knowledge has been bestowed may know that, The (QURAN) is THE TRUTH from your Rabb (Nourisher), so that they may acquire Iman in it and their hearts may be made humbly (open) to it."(22:54)<br>  <br>  Thus the real challenge is: Do we have the courage and the patience to go deep down in our hearts and try to cleanse them from all types of non-Quranic concepts so that Iman can enter? Or, do we simply want to keep practicing what our forefathers have passed on to us? The choice is ours. But we better be prepared to face the consequences of that choice.<br>  <br>  Iman is not to accept it with the tongue but to accept it with the heart. (2:8-9)<br>  <br>  To accept everything which the Quran says as truth is Iman. (2:26)<br>  <br>  In order to acquire Iman in Allah, it is necessary to first reject every authority other than Allah. (2:25-26)|`|UhyvM73iaa	By performing Salat for Allah, obeying all His commands  like five pillars of Islam, giving charity to poor people, paying Zakat (poor tax) of 2-1/2 % of your total savings every year, being nice to all Allah's creations and fighting in the name of Allah to establish His religion on this planet. That is why Muslims are never afraid of giving their life for Allah's causes in Islam.|`|iH7ZB5Soaa	O soul! If, in a brief life, you want to do something that will profit you infinitely in the hereafter, and you want every moment of your life to be as beneficial as a life-time, and if you want to transform your habitual actions into worship and your heedlessness into awareness of the Divine presence, follow the Illustrious Practices of the Prophet (PBUH). For when you apply your actions to the rulings of the Shari‘a, it affords a sort of awareness of God’s presence; it becomes worship of a sort and yields many fruits for the hereafter. For example, you bought something. The moment you applied what is acceptable and required by the Shari‘a, that ordinary act of shopping acquired the value of worship. Recalling the injunctions of the Shari‘a calls to mind Revelation. And by thinking of the Lawgiver, you are turned towards God. And that makes you aware of His presence. That means, in applying the Illustrious Sunna to your actions, are advantages like making this fleeting life the means of gaining an everlasting life which produces eternal fruits. Heed the decree:<br>  So believe in God and His Messenger, the unlettered Prophet, who believes in God and His Word: follow him that you may be guided.<br>  Try to reflect comprehensively the effulgence and manifestation of all of the Most Beautiful Names, whose manifestations are diffused within the ordinances of the Shari‘a and Illustrious Sunna..|`|hWo22bJ0aa	Salatul Layl|`|qPSkkPqwaa	Walekum assalam<br>  wayakum...<br>  <br>  You say your not that close to Allah, then how you know JazakAllahu Khair? Because many muslims dont say it nor know it.<br>  <br>  Firstly, just because they go to Mosque doesnt mean you have to. Look here you want to be educated so you come close to Allah. Now remember Allah has said in a hadith by Rasulullah (sallalahu alaihi wa sallam) that Allah has said If my slave wants to come to me by walking i will come to HIM by RUNNING, So do you see how Merciful Allah is???????????<br>  <br>  This is your first step towards being close to Allah. What is the first step ? The first step is realizing that you want to come close to Allah and realizing Allah is Most Merciful and Knows what all we do and nothing is hidden from Allah.<br>  <br>  Second Step: Plan. Plan what? The plan is to learn from scratch. You must have to put effort. See firstly you must know that the reward or punishment of the hereafter is way greater than this worldy life. So you must strive hard because then you will attain Allah's love. So whatever you do, dont care about other or how they will think. It is because your doing something for the pleasure of Allah (that should be your intention). You must learn to read the Quran with Tajweed. Tajweed means correct arabic pronounciations. You can learn this from the Imam of the mosque. Also read Quran everyday. it will intercede on the Day of Judgement when no one can help you except Allah. Read Hadith daily and make dua everyday more than 20x. Look 20x is not much. Because everyone keeps askign O i hope i get this book (for example the hadith book). So you just have to add in O Allah I hope I get this book so please grant me. and then after each dua say Ameen. Learn religious duties. For example the 5 pillars of Islam. Learn them under supervision of Alim. This means the Alim will teach you. You can ask the Imam of the Mosque for an Alim. Also do Zikr. Zikr means remembering Allah. After each prayer say Ayatul Kursi once and SubhanAllah 33 times, Alhamdulilah 33 times, and Allahu Akbar 34 times.. you can count on your hands. Also memorize the Surah of Quran. Read Surah Mulk and Surah Waqiah before sleeping every night. Surah Mulk is # 67 and Surah Waqiah is # 56. <br>  <br>  Third Step: You must have clear intentions of the ibadah (worship). Even dua is worship. for each intention have intention of pleasing Allah only. Look the things i mentioned to do. Are VERY EASY. It will just take practice. But sometimes you are busy so cant do it. It is okay but remember you cannot stop doing them. It is because Allah doesnt mind how much u remember him. meaning you HAVE to remember Him. What i mean is, even if you do little zikr after each namaz, Allah will appreciate and reward you. But some do way more than you and me, even then Allah will appreciate it and reward him. Allah wont care if you do zikrullah for 20 mins instead of 10. The zikr should be consistent <--- Allah wants consistent zikr no matter if you do it 10 mins or 30 mins. See to make you happy I was ignorant Muslim till 2007-08. I am only 15 and now (its 2009) I have been doing zikr and im knowledgeable now. <br>  <br>  THird step: Suppose many weeks pass by and now your very knowledgeable person. now you should become more religious and encourage people to do good and forbid evil. And now you change the bad qualities of urself very much. <br>  <br>  Fourth Step: Have contacts with only those who are knowledgeable (meaning religious). Also have an habit of repenting to Allah because Allah gets angry with a person who doesnt make dua to Him. Also the angel who records our bad deeds doesnt record it for 6 hours. It is because it is there for repentance. So ask Forgivness of Allah.<br>  <br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  Summary: <br>  1) Ask dua for halal things only and keep asking forgiveness and dont lose hope in Allah.<br>  2) saying Ayatul Kursi once and SubhanAllah 33 times and Alhamdulilah 33 times, and Allahu Akbar 34 times.<br>  3) Get in contact with Imam and Alim and learn religious stuff from him.<br>  4) Learn Tajweed (correct pronounciation) from Imam at Masjid (mosque).<br>  5) Memorize Surah of Quran and keep reading Quran everyday no matter what. Even if you dont have time or are busy atleast read a page. Minimum to read everyday = 3 pages.<br>  6) Always keep on asking Allah to make your faith stronger and make you steadfast on deen. And remember dont lose Hope in Allah.<br>  7) Ask Allah to renew ur faith every few days. Like say O Allah renew and strengthen my faith. Ameen.<br>  8) Say Ameen at end of dua.<br>  9) Ask me questions..Im reading to help <br>  10) Strive hard for death can come anytime and you dont want to die with being stupid and not knowing ur religion<br>  <br>  11) ************* This one is important)))))))))))))))))))))<br>  <br>  keep on saying la ilaha ilalahu muhammadur Rasulullah.<br>  We say this when we are about to die.|`|qHutCtiwaa	One step at a time.

xTpvnWRuaa	YES I totally agree with you. We're at a tipping point where everyone is so bitter and hateful and everything. It's distuisting. Racism is already going towards full force, but to be more open minded and more intellectual about it, it's not just a black vs whites thing, it's everything. really! Indians vs whites, hispanics vs whites, hispanics vs blacks, asians vs such and such...it goes on and on. It's really not just limited to a black/white thing.<br>  <br>  Is there a way to stop this disease? Not really because it's human nature, and it happens over and over again, if you studied history.  If the world sides with not loving and evil and strife..it will produce the fruits of that. (which aren't good things I assure you).<br>  <br>  People have also deleted my questions due to religion.<br>  <br>  It's really disguisting but it's what we've come to. The world today is VERY hateful, end-times ready, and bickering about everything. it's not a good place anymore.<br>  <br>  BUT..don't get discouraged because it's not 100% THIS WAY.<br>  <br>  Heck I grew up in a pretty well off town, and the blacks/whites were totally fine with one another. Everyone was welcomed, and they moved on from this petty sh9t, and cared about culture, the arts....race was a thing of the past.<br>  <br>  <br>  Now sadly it is here again, and I tihnk most of it is because of people having difficulty in life, money issues, they don't agree with alot of things that are going on, and think the other guy is out to get them.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  It's sad, and you're 100% correct.<br>  <br>  <br>  Sometimes even when your quetsions are deleted...it's not you that was wrong.<br>  <br>  Even the authority figures that be could be wrong.<br>  <br>  <br>  sad and scary world! So keep true to urself and know what ur all about, because seemingly, everyone wants to take that away from you nowadays.<br>  <br>  <br>  :hugs: I feel ur pain, i go through the same stuff.|`|AtY7izyHaa	Aw shucks! you mean all that work i put into <br>  <br>  answering your question was for nothing cause<br>  <br>  of the yahoo gestapo speech police, oh well<br>  <br>  guess i have to reiterate what i said, even to<br>  <br>  the point of redundancy . . .<br>  <br>  And i quote . . .<br>  <br>  <br>  " Ahhh! finally, some one else noticed, not<br>  <br>  only is your cognitive perception brilliant, but<br>  <br>  if i may say so, i respectfully submit, you are<br>  <br>  a woman of courage, not to mention, a breath <br>  <br>  of true intellectual, fresh air . . .<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  now if your question gets deleted again, i suggest<br>  <br>  you offer Y/A 2 words, no, not merry xmas, i meant<br>  <br>  the other 2 . . ..|`|AA10067344	I think many people are so afraid of saying anything someone might find offensive that they prefer to ignore the topic completely.|`|2xaVpnNNaa	yes it is too late for society. we have entered an age, where no matter what you say it can be offensive. and YOU are punished for it. even if you were not being offensive.<br>  <br>  this is getting old, and is encouraging ME to be anything but PC. im sick of letting those who are easily offended winning. <br>  <br>  racism is plastered on anything now. even plain curiousity.<br>  <br>  and you are right. hiding it and being in denial about everything is only going to encourage racism and more stereotypes. so this crying racism bit, is getting extremely outdated.<br>  <br>  real racism, should be taken seriously. but words? words are words, and if they are nothing more than that, i guess we need to just look on. if you let them know it is getting to you, they will only keep doing it.

(I'd ask permission!)<br>  <br>  You may have to do some fund-raising on your own to pay for this event.  You may have to pay for it yourselves.   If you are near a city, esp. NYC, there are theatres you can rent.  They will charge admission, and hopefully you will make it back.  Do you want to charge a nominal admission price to cover any rental, costumes or props?  Look for donations?  Maybe you guys could volunteer somewhere, bartering for space.  <br>  <br>  Goodwill, Salvation Army, craigslist, and friends are all great sources for finding costumes and props cheaply.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!

PwHQSAxvaa	lol @ first answer.<br>  <br>  It depends where in the world you are, each country, or part of a country, has its own laws.<br>  <br>  In England you need to be 16 to marry (with parental permission) or 18 to marry without their permission. You need to be 17 to drive a car, or 18 to vote, or buy alcohol.|`|MHg9JhEKaa	In the UK<br>  <br>  Driving: you can start learning at 17<br>  Drinking: 18<br>  Smoking: is now 18 (used to be 16)<br>  Sex: 16|`|5I4imquJaa	smoking = 16<br>  sex = 16<br>  driving = 17<br>  drinking = 18, but they are thinking of upping the limit to 21|`|ec1d2aa1fd1a61665dfc7bfa23828ab5aa	Here in the south it's 12

sVyH0jTiaa	jdoran5 , Believe me what I am about to tell you.<br>  I'm deaf.<br>  It is depend on where you at.<br>  Some don't want to approach you because they don't know sign language. Some will want to approach you because they are interesting in learning sign language but really it depend on hearing people. I can't give you all the answer because I can't read hearing people's minds.<br>  What I will never understand hearing people is that they go someone who speak different languages and get along with them. I still don't get it but I bet you lot of people in Y!A will disagree with me.<br>  Some what I disagree with Happy-2 because some people are scared to talk to you because they don't know how to communicate with you but why are they hanging out with other people who speak different languages?<br>  Which part is it don't make really sense to me.<br>  On the other hand I using very strong ASL also I am friendly behavior but they are still scared.|`|AA10671142	why would I be scared of a deaf person. I am a hearing person. I know someone that is deaf and I am learning sign language. I treat people all the same. they should go up to you and talk with you. yes some people are rude and do stare. when I was younger, I had a grandmother who was deaf and was wearing hearing aids. I loved her and was not scared of her either|`|wwdllMzYaa	well<br>  an hoenst answer from me is<br>  my uncle is deaf, has been his whole life<br>  im 31 now, so i understand the issue much mroe than i did when i was young<br>  but<br>  when i was young<br>  i was kinda scared of him<br>  why?<br>  wel, he was very loud, beacuse he cant hear himself, he cant know how loud or quiet he is, hes always loud ;-D<br>  when your younger and dont understand much about it, it is scary, peopel shouting is always scary whether they are deaf or not<br>  <br>  and, i did have problems talking to him, i was always scared he woudl be annoyed i couldnt understand him, he never once got mad, but when your younger, this is what you think about<br>  <br>  so thats soemthing for you to consider<br>  and remember<br>  <br>  its usualy because people dont understand you or what is wrong with you which causes 'fear'  and confusion<br>  and beacuse people are not sure how to communicate with you if you dont hear<br>  <br>  as hearing is an important part of hearing peoples communciation<br>  so its almost liek communicating with soemone who speaks an entirely different language <br>  <br>  im sureif you just talked to them, tried to explain, hey sorry if i talk to loud, its these ears you know, make a joke about it, as that always loosens up the atmospher and lets peopel feel they can talk to youa bout yoru deafness, which is another problem<br>  <br>  people are always unsure and scared as to whether you can or cant talk about it with or in front of the prson<br>  so you have to somehow let them know, its ok, they can<br>  <br>  good luck<br>  ;-)|`|Xkas9BG2aa	I was in a "distress tolerance" support group the other day at a local mental health facility where I live, and there was a deaf woman in the group who had a sign language interpreter.  While watching the woman sign, I was wishing I knew how to do sign language.  It's beautiful to watch her and see someone is understanding what she is signing.  I found out from the interpreter that she wears a black shirt because when she's signing it's easier for someone to see the signs.  The more we learn about you and me and other people, the less stress we will have...but we have to keep learning.|`|bEkuN0Rwaa	I don't think people are "scared" of deaf people, but don't know how to communicate with them.  They can be interested in how a deaf person does communicate, how being deaf effects your life, or a lot of other things.  I could be that people are thinking about how their life would be if they were deaf.|`|dcovK6oqaa	I know how that feels.  My daughter Judy well she is not deaf or blind, but she suffers deficit of attention.she has a problem in learning things. It takes her longer than other students. she has to take alot of therapy. Before she couldn't even talk to you. some doctors even though that she had autism.Or that she was deaf too.  the kids in school make fun of her. they hit her.  she has improved a lot with the therapists, but the kids at school are still very cruel. They can't accept the fact that a person can be born with a disability or a problem. you know it makes me so mad that I want to hit does kids but I have no choice but to control myself. But judy has a good heart if she would be in your school she would be your friend.and she has a lot of love to give. tried to be yourself we all have problems.tell yourself I am a good person and I deserved love just like anyone else. I tried to teach her to have self -esteem and be strong and ignored this ignorants.|`|BevylvVSaa	I agree with Happy - I don't think people are scared of you at all. It is more like you speak an entirely different language than they do so they believe they have no way to communicate with you, so they don't try.<br>  <br>  Do you speak up in classes? Do they know you can hear? Perhaps you need to find a way to start educating your classmates about your abilities so that they realize you are not as difficult to communicate with as they might believe. <br>  <br>  Have you ever thought that you might need to be the person who approached them? It is a two-way street. Do you ever approach others? Do you ever initiate a hello or smile at a person you know from class? If not, perhaps they think you are unfriendly and unapproachable.|`|BQ0y50Nvaa	I think people are scared of their own inability to communicate or to feel at ease with difference. Go to people, make an effort to talk to as many people as possible, only then will they know that they are able to communicate with you and that difference is no big deal.<br>  <br>  And being a fascinating object is a good thing!|`|L9A81Xvvaa	Hey!<br>  <br>  Wow! Finally I found some Deaf users in Yahoo Answer! Awsome!<br>  <br>  Hearing people are not scared of Deaf people really. They just do not know who to communicate with you the right away. Trust me I have been there before since day 1 and I ALWAYS tried to be myself and be sociable with hearing people so they can see and feel I am not weird person to be around. It important so they can feel comfortable around Deaf people and have them understand that Deaf people are good people and can have good communication with each others. <br>  <br>  I completely agreed with the other Deaf users. They are exactly right about his/her answers. They know their stuff.<br>  <br>  Oh yeah one more thing, do not let hearing people get to you. Just ignore them if get worst. It works for me|`|xOiafJpoaa	well a very wise man one said, people are afraid of this the do not understand. So, since people dont understand that, well, just because you are deaf dosnt me you arnt capaible of having and making friends. stupid as is sound people dont know what to do when they meet some one diffrent from them, so mabey you should try aproaching them, let them see that you are just one of them...and not some fascinating weird martian object|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	I think your conclusion that they are "scared" is a mistake.  They probably merely assume that they wouldn't be able to communicate with you, so they avoid the attempt.  Maybe you would encounter more friendliness if you yourself started behaving more friendly.|`|2mCiqG3maa	I had a friend who is deaf, well not fully but she did have a hearing aid. I wasn't scared of people with hearing aids, their just people, like you, who just can't hear properly.|`|RHeuCvi9aa	the kids are jerks
