My hair stylist said that Pantene or Garnier or John Frieda can do more damage to your hair than just flat ironing your hair with other shampoos. I don't use a protectant before straightening and i am worried about my hair because I thought these products were good for your hair. My hair stylist even said that your ends could turn white after they are spilt from it. I want to know if this is true or just a selling point for their products. Plus if it is true could you tell me what shampoos or protectants won't do this to my hair?

20081022235828AAsYR83	Beauty & Style;Makeup	I want to find a great lipstick...?	I have never shoppedfor makeup at anyplace other than the local pharmacy.

Are you expected to buy something right away?  (I tend to like to mull things over before making a purchase.)  Also, are higher-priced makeups worth the money.  Is a 10$ lipstick just as good as a 20$ one?  am i just paying for the name?  i want to make sure i get the right shade for my skintone, something that will be long-wearing (i like those maybelline (or is it cover-girl?) commercials with the bride kissing her groom's white shirt and her lipstick doesn't even leave a mark..) and feels good, and something that is worth the money at least if i'm going to dish out.  Advice please!!!!!  about lipstick in general and ettiquette of visiting a counter or fancy store.  thank you!!

20080712131025AAtpk1s	Beauty & Style;Makeup	Question about makeup & perfume? (:?	I have recently started buying more expensive, quality makeup. I went to private school so I could never really wear that much makeup. Now I have more and I was wondering what other necessities I might need. I have fair-medium skin, blonde hair, and blue eyes if that helps. My favorite brands are Too Faced and Benefit, but I like all kinds of stuff from Sephora or Ulta or wherever. :)          http://www.flickr.com/photos/26888606@N0...     http://www.flickr.com/photos/26888606@N0...     http://www.flickr.com/photos/26888606@N0...     http://www.flickr.com/photos/26888606@N0...     http://www.flickr.com/photos/26888606@N0...

I'll try to give you as much information on what I have been doing with them and my habits:      So i got both my ears pierced for the first time two weeks ago. I didn't get them done with a gun, i got them done with a needle (10 gauge), i will be stretching them. So they are pretty big.   I am just wondering if the one is infected since it is a little red, it is a little swollen, there is dry flaky skin around the hole, it hurts like a *****, and i just woke up and there is a clear "liquid" around the back of  it.   I've been cleaning my ears twice a day (I shower every morning and turn them in the shower, and at night a use Studex Ear Care Solution)      I sleep on my side, either ear is against the pillow with the weight of my head on it.   Within the last 2 days I have gotten the flu (i don't know if this is because of them, i might just be worrying for nothing.)      Is there anything else i should be doing to help make this process easier? Is there anything im doing wrong? How long until they are healed?    Any other advice will be extremely appreciated.

20070106192756AA9OTK3	Beauty & Style;Hair	Dying my hair from brown to blonde.?	I dyed my hair brown about 5 months ago and I want to go back to my natural color, blonde. Im getting very bored with brown and my hair has not been blonde in about 5 years, and I've already dyed my hair reds, blacks, pink and browns. So, I dont really want to go anyother color. My professional hair dresser is gonna bleach out my hair and then dye it blonde. I have bleached out my hair before about 4 years ago, so that I could dye it pink and I didnt ruin my hair. But now Im kinda worried about bleaching it beacuse Im always paranoied about my hair falling out and thats something I dont want. I do understand that it could get strawy, but you can get shampoo's to fix that. I just dont think my hair would take that much damage like falling out beucase when I bleached it years ago nothing like that happened(it was bright red then and I bleached it out white then dyed it hot pink). Please speak our opinions on what you think I should do.
