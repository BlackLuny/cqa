Just lay in bed and your friends will give you it or you parents or whoever.....Drink diet coke at least 10 cans everyday!    Fat: Just eat junk food. You can walk over there to get it it doesn't matter. And just drink the natural soda and lay your butt in the couch and watch tv while eating junk food and soda.|`|TWzOmqqYaa	No excercise, just eat.|`|oJEtWqMYaa	mcdonalds like everyday and then sit on your butt|`|LDK2hRHIaa	Get married .....!!!!|`|vfhKkiSKaa	Eat lots of junk food like potato chips.    Lots of deserts, like ice cream and chocolate cake.    Eat lots of fast foods like Mickey D's.    Then snack constantly during the day.    After that, eat your 3 squares.    Viola, you are fat|`|GuYRsad0aa	if u wanna get a heart attack: eat fast food  if u wanna get fat: eat a lot, all the time
Jc7rI9WSaa	same here! it might just be mental.. ur not happy w/what u see... cause like when i think my friends look great they pick every little imperfection they see and i dont think theres anything wrong w/it... and same w/me i'll pick my imperfections and than they say im crazy... so it happens to everyone.. dont be so hard on urself cause u'll never be completely satisfied w/what u have.. just try to be content! :)|`|SyyWIe14aa	You might be fat..the right person to ask is your doctor    I think i am fat..but my friends told me i looked normal..but my doctor told me i should lose a few pounds|`|3k2NjOWsaa	i don't know what it is, but the exact same thing happens to me!!!!  it drives me nuts because I don't know whether to believe what i see or what they see!!!|`|oJEtWqMYaa	you have a bad body image
WS9TooJKaa	Your body absorbs most of the calories as soon as you've started eating.|`|LQ04emc3aa	when you purge, everything that's in your stomach comes out.  so the answer would have to be no,  although the food that has already been digested and absorbed into other organs is well, staying in there.  but that takes a while.  lol:)
AA11565057	It's completely normal to feel angry towards someone who has committed such a heinous act. Even without knowing your best friend, if I saw this guy, I'd probably want to kill him!    I have been in a situation that is not dissimilar. It involved someone I care about a great deal having been abused as a child. Believe me, I wanted to kill the abuser - preferably horribly, following torture. I didn't do it of course, but I didn't feel guilty about having those feelings. They're normal. The important part is not doing them! In my case, we got the police involved, made sure the person knew they weren't welcome anywhere near us, and that was the end of it. Given time, everyone became less angry. I can now think about that person without wanting to kill him - Now I just want him to rot in jail :)    It sounds as though you're actually coping pretty well. It is normal to feel that way, and given time, you'll feel less angry.|`|zquDsUVgaa	i truly believe that is a horrible thing to happen to a good friend    i believe its normal to want to get revenge, but in the end you wont really choose to kill someone    not everyone is a murderer and im sure you're not|`|CsefdZ0Gaa	What you are feeling is entirely normal and actually to be expected after the horrible tragedy you have experienced.     Everybody has crazy feelings sometimes, it normal. If you act on those feelings then THAT is the difference that makes people crazy.|`|OurcLXigaa	i have ever been put in that situation but what you are feeling is grieving in my opinion  maybe you should make an appointment with a psychiatrist (not in a bad way) just so that you can get a profesional oppinion, and they could give you some advice on what to do whilealso getting the chance to let it all out|`|sKGeirdaaa	its very normal|`|OF1f8nuiaa	if you wouldn't want to kill the murderer of your best friend you would have to be quite the heartless basterd. Its completely normal, i feel like killing people all the time. like when i'm driving.|`|A3SXq0Uoaa	it's normal. it's completely natural that you would want to feel that way. it's definitely something you shouldn't go through with but you should talk to a good friend or parents telling them how you feel about her death and about her boyfriend. it helps a lot, and i'm sure if your friends were good friends with her too, they would feel the same way.|`|nA8Qc4ZAaa	yes it's perfectly normal you want him to recieve the same harsh thing that she did. you want revenge for your friend. i have felt this way about my self and other people before and eventually you just get over it, it is still early and if she was really close it will be awhile to get over that|`|x3NIn6rSaa	You feel so horrible for your loss  And it is SUCH a normal feeling  Your fine its okay  Sorry for you loss    I'd feel the same way|`|0MunIx8raa	Yes, I have felt that way.  It's normal to want revenge on someone who does something so horrific.  I hope this guy is in jail.  I have felt this way a few times, but never acted on it, and never would.  I had a stalker once and he was trying to break into my house on several occasions and was terrorizing me...now this cat I would have snuffed out if he'd of ever gotten into my house, no doubt, no regrets.  I sat with a shotgun all night awaiting him to come through my door, but he never did.  Never found out who it was.  Even the cops couldn't catch him.  They chased him through the field out behind my house and couldn't catch him.  This guy would have surely gotten his chest blown out if he'd of come through my door.|`|XTDeAfTqaa	For $5,000 I can make it look like an accident.  The guy doesn't deserve to breathe.  Sorry for your loss.|`|s34GP3Ioaa	Yes....only once, but someone beat me to it.  LOL!!!!  True story.  His roommate got pissed at him and used a 45. on him.  When I was informed about his murder I was sad for about 2 minutes.  He was a big a$$hole.|`|k5X78IM3aa	Oh yes, I have felt that way & no you are not "going to hell".  Considering the circumstances, what you are feeling is very normal.  It is part of the grieving process.    Please tell me...he is in jail, right?|`|w74qWx0raa	ha. If you go to "hell" for that then gods the one who has the problem|`|A4KYtiNnaa	i know what you mean, two years ago i dealt with a similar problem, though i NEVER killed the guy. your not crazy, your a normal human being. im so sorry though, feel better(:|`|wb8WwWMNaa	Dude I'd totally hog tie his *** and kick him in his sack, but that's just me.  And yes what you're feeling is totally normal.|`|s4TMc1vqaa	Im so sorry about your friend. It's probally normal to want to kill someone who killed someone close to you. I've never had to go thought something like that, and i hope i never do... You probally wont go to hell either, but you should probally stop thinking like that, cause it wont help solve anything.|`|4hr9JGAdaa	when somebody hurts a loved one of their's, they feel, sad, angry and thats normal. if i was in the same situation, id probably want to kill the guy myself, and i am so sorry for your loss, i hope that guy gets what he derserves!    god bless. |`|SEqVvFUyaa	hun.. for one i am sorry for your loss.  and i hope that girls asshole boyfriend gets put in jail.  no your not doing wrong by thinking that...its totally normal. things like that really piss me off.|`|YoZZDqq9aa	You are going through the normal stages of grief and trauma. Please be sure to grieve for the boyfriend. He is suffering too.
qf66N9AAaa	Sure do.|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	what you need is child protective services, what your mother is doing (or failing to do) is ILLEGAL.  Every child in the US is required by law to recieve an education, we all pay taxes so kids can go to school.|`|Run7dyraaa	Your mother is not really home schooling you. Don't you have to hand in a certain amount of work? Your mother is abusive towards you, and your father. She needs counseling, not you dear.|`|2Xh1ywWRaa	well it would be good to be able to speak to someone about this wont you have to ask your mum?or is there a kids help line?|`|Gburbcuiaa	Maybe you should get in touch with other home schoolers in your area? School isn't really that great. It gets very old very fast and your friends are only your friends there because you are convenient. Maybe you could look into joining activities in your area like sports teams, youth groups, clubs, choirs, dance lessons, just something to get you out of the house? Why won't she let you go to school? You could clean your room and some of the house which might prompt your mom to clean more. There are many resources out there for home schoolers and no schoolers you may just have to make the best of it.|`|6HgiNCmqaa	don't ever wonder what life is like with out yourself. if going to a school never works out, join a  team sport, club, or some kind or organization. joining these kinding of things will help  make new friends!    anyway, getting counceling is ur choice, talk with ur mom about how u feel    something that helps familys relize they love each other is wife swap, it helps familys alot alot alot! plz give anyone of these things a try!    Good luck|`|YoZZDqq9aa	yes.|`|AA10852456	you could ask a counselor about your situations.|`|YPNdv0pSaa	yes, you should probably get a counselor or find someone you trust to talk to.|`|sKGeirdaaa	ya u need major help thats gross|`|n0UmA5Z9aa	Of course! We all need counselors. They have different names--guidance counselor at school, counselor in a rehab program, shrink as we get older. I am seeing one now and wish I had seen one in my teens before I had to live out my dumb mistakes.    A professional will give you an unbiased look and good advice. A good friend helps too, but a professionals are trained to be good.     Just be sure you love and care for yourself. You are very important in this world. You will see this as you grow older. We all need you.|`|9fhczyKXaa	ok, here is how to fix your life:  1. go to the library and get a bunch of books, and a tutor (they hang out there). also you can write down the questions and quiz yourself a week later so you don't see or remember the answers. if you cant go alone, just ask your mom to take you, she'll understand. or maybe ask your dad. seriously, learning is a good thing for the rest of your life. you should also check out some of those online schools and stuff. you can also find friends at the library, and see some clubs (on the bulletin board if there is one)  2. clean the house. i know it sounds like a pain, but it'll take a day. what do you have to do anyway? just clean it. listen to music at the same time. just take like half an hour everyday to keep it clean. it doesn't take much time, and your mom will be happy and softer.  3. just be careful around your mom. my dad is better when i'm careful around him. apologize a lot even if you don't want to. but i'm telling you the cleaning will put her in a good mood. oh, and if she asks for a drink, (or something similar), put a special touch on it. like an orange slice on the cup. it works, i do it all the time and my dad's happiness lasts for at least 2 hours.  in the mean time, bond with your mom, because she might warm up to you, and give her some alone time in the evening with your dad. and ask her to teach you a little bit. if she says no, make a deal-maybe cook one meal if she teaches you that day. something like that.  if all this doesn't work, then i don't know what to do. no one would. you could see a councilor  good luck, we all need it|`|B17VheFgaa	Just say your going out and go to school... Explain your situation to a Guidance Counselor, Psychiatrist or principal, and they will probably let you go to school or work out a deal with your parents.  Otherwise, there are good online schools, tutors and lessons that are quite cheap.  A google search should find some for you.
31Xl7M5faa	First of the reason it is hard after removal or hard to pull out is because your using to high absorbancy.  Try using a regular or light tampon or even a slim one and wait a little longer before removing it.  I have had that problem before. I can't use tampax pearl becuase they feel very unpleasent for me.  I like Playtex gentle glide.  Put the applicator in all the way until the thumb grip is just outside the vagina.   Good luck|`|rsAqrbsgaa	You're just really tight|`|sEFmjAJkaa	ask your mom to show you how..........|`|GEyJMsaKaa	OMG Who posts there details on how they pull out a tampon on the intenet?!?    Seriously,like,eww.|`|eMcxuo3Vaa	Dont worry, it used to hurt me to wear tampons too.    Girls have a hymen (cherry) that will pop when you have sex, and can be broken by tampons.    when it pops by tampons, you cant tell becuase you are bleeding down there anyways.    well, the reason it hurts is because your hymen is not broken, which is absolutely normal.    tampons hurt me, until one day my hymen broke, and now i dont really feel them..  its absoultely normal and actually healthy that tampons hurt you, dont worry|`|7kfZgqT1aa	It may be because you're not used to wearing a tampon. Sometimes we still feel it inside us that's normal. Once you start using them regular, you won't notice it as much. But just to make sure, ask a friend or your Mother to help you... Just incase you are not inserting properly.. It's very very easy to get it wrong! Good Luck xo Don't listen to people who say it brakes through your Hymen. That's silly you will never loose virginity when inserting tampons...|`|XzEGvaXjaa	In all honesty, I can always feel the tampon no matter how far I put it in. Sometimes when I sit a certain way, it feels as though my body is trying to push the tampon out. Its not painful, but I can still feel it. I don't understand how women can forget that foreign object is inside of them!    If it hurts, then you probably are not putting it all the way in. You'll know when it's all the way in when your fingers touch your vulva while you are putting the applicator in (your fingers should be on the place meant for your fingers). Worst come to worst, just use pads. Its slightly less comfortable, but its much, much easier.    And its normal for the tampon to take a little extra strength to pull it out. But, it shouldn't be too hard. Maybe you aren't leaving the tampon in long enough? I know that if you take them out too soon, it can be really hard to get out. Try going to a lower absorbency.|`|xlvzvAwJaa	if your hymen isnt ripped that can make tampons hurt|`|9MAgrGAMaa	Maybe the 'size' you're using is too big. That's why it would hurt coming in and out. And, when there is not enough blood, that would cause it to be 'hard'.|`|t6zrwGNraa	well, you are not supposed to feel it, ut if it hurts when you pull, try a smaller size    hope i helped    A|`|l7oyPpzIaa	maybe youre using the wrong absorbancy.  if it hurts there probably isnt enough blood, so you need the smaller size down (:|`|tsCXQhMmaa	the same thing happened to me once i started using them. to make sure you put it in all the way you hold it with your thumb and middle finger on the little grippy part. you should basically push it in until your two fingers are against your vagina. then push down with your index finger to insert. if you do this already then you're just tight and not used to it yet. also, certain tampons hurt more to remove than others ive noticed.|`|apndlp3oaa	go see a doctor...but most likely your just tight. like your body is just getting use to something going in there...|`|i8SkPj8qaa	The tampon might not be all the way absorbed. So that's why it hurts. Try a smaller size. Also relax when you put it and take it out|`|jpUTNjUjaa	it depends if u broke ur hym@en|`|1899lYjMaa	Talk to your Dr. he is probably gonna recommend pads.|`|EFihXU8Xaa	You should try using a lower absorbancy.  That will the tampon will be skinnier and you shouldn't be able to feel it.  You'll have to change it more often, however.    It might hurt when you're taking the tampon out if the tampon is too dry (for lack of a better word), or hasn't been in long enough to absorb much blood.|`|NOAwj4pOaa	i know that when i first started i read the directions that came with them and what i normally do is insert the applicator in with it yes till about when my fingers and my body touch... and as for it being hard maybe your not bleeding enough and should move down a size or keep it in longer|`|5pszijaDaa	ok, this may sound stupid but i once had a really stupid friend who it took a year for her to figure this out.... you are removing the applicator after using it to push the tampon in, right? because you are supposed to take it out and throw that part away...
5bYpbodUaa	Malignant=Cancer  Benign=NOT Cancer    Thought I'd help you out on the meanings there. Many people forget that not everyone knows all of medical terminology.    Anyway, I have a mole on my tummy that has grown a bit and changed shape, but I've had my doctor look at it, and there is nothing to be concerned about. He did mention to me that if there are any other changes like a weird shape forming, or darker color, or bigger, then he would want to check it out again.     I hope everything is ok. Please try not to worry about the "what if's" at this point. Only worry if there is something to worry about. Since you don't know yet of what this mole is, then try to relax, because stressing about it, will only cause you to feel icky inside.  Try some relaxation techniques by taking some slow deep breaths a few times and do something fun with your family.    Take care.  :-)|`|o0VyLaPiaa	Malignant isn't a big word.      You'll be fine.  Even if it is cancerous, it's probably not very spread and will be easy to remove.  If you don't know the meaning of malignant, you're probably not that old, so the chances are that you won't have cancer.    Last year, I had four suspicious moles removed and all of them came out negative.  Relax and be well!  :)|`|u5F22mEbaa	Relax - the vast majority of the time its nothing, and if it is malignant, sounds like its a pretty small area...|`|0ZxYrtv0aa	Lol, yes, I have gone to a doctor about a mole once and it turned out to be nothing. Just keep telling yourself that, that a lot of the time people have nothing to worry about. :)    Just think of it as a check up and ask the doc to check out the rest of your spots while you're there.
hXYjkCGpaa	Don't forget to take time to yourself each day. Do something fun, exercise, have a bubble bath or a massage, cuddle, laugh, and practice positive thinking.

51736e494ebf305ca5b1cba0d35f09e8aa	wowwwwww thats exactly what has been happening to be recently...I saw a psychologist instead and she told me that it might be anxiety attacks... they really do get your blood pressure up so whatever it is that you are thinking and stressed about believe me people have to deal with a lot worse...    I always say do we have to experience such a bad thing in order to appreciate what we have, im saying this because i truly believe what you have is psychological and if you dont treat yourself one day you may have a stroke... Blood pressure is really dangerous when its up so please be carefull|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	sounds like panic attacks to me, suggest you consult a mental health specialist.|`|hHC2oCqDaa	When you went to the ER I take it they did not do a full work up (blood profile, physical) on you.  I can be a number of things.  You need to get a full work up to find out, if your B.P is normal and your not diagnosed as having high bp, or boderline bp.      If you do not know if you are, a visit to the doctor to check everything out, will help determine where the sudden spikes are originating from.    It could be your kidneys.  They may not be filtering well, and sodium levels may not be maintaining correctly through your kidneys, so that your kidneys not moving sufficient water sodium through at its equal mixture.  That maybe causing the spikes and your dryness.      The human body being an absolute amazement, will find ways to keep all its systems in check.  expelling excess sodium through CO2 you exhale could be cause for dryness.  I am no physician, but you need to address it.    Hope this helps.

Concentrating is a skill not easily mastered in these days. Eliminate everything which scrambles your thoughts. TV, Radio, ipod. Everything. I took a three month vacation just to find my own thoughts. It's like that. The enemy of thought is western culture, the clock, the calendar, and all artificial noise.  The meds only degrade your thinking.  Diet is also a huge factor. Stay away from carbohydrates for a while. Increase fresh greens and vegetables for a few weeks.   Seek professional help. You need a holistic doctor.|`|SEbchthIaa	Dont tell him you need something stronger he will probably think your a druggie.

Just go to the health food store and purchase some L-phenyalaline or L-theanine.        L-Phenyalanline is a precursor of tyrosine, so it might not help you.  Plus overdoing it with this stuff, can cause nerve damage.      L-theanine is derived from green tea leaves.   No side effects known...helps calm down the nerves and helps focus better.      Although, if you are otherwise healthy and still can't focus...you might need your doc to figure out an underlying medical condition.   Just a thought.   Are you eating well?   Are you getting enough sleep?   Are you getting enough excercise?   Are you stressed out?      These factors contribute to not being able to focus.  Good luck to you!
aVXsqdLpaa	You're growing, and those lines will probably go away by the time you're 18.|`|mAp90hEeaa	This is not a serious health problem - it is normal coloration of this area.  As you get older and are going into puberty, things can change.  This is not an STD or anything else but normal body changes.|`|wb8WwWMNaa	Dude go to a doctor.|`|OdSrwFcnaa	not sure hunnie,but go to doctor just incase :)
hoDin3UYaa	You could have possibly torn cartilage or damaged tendons in the knee. Other damage could have also occurred.     You are also making the right decision by seeing a doctor. I would suggest that you make an appointment with an Orthopedic Doctor, who can Examine and then X-Ray and/or order an MRI on the knee in order to locate the problem.
sQu3LLqtaa	Under eating can stunt your growth so hopefully you are eating plenty.    Hopefully you are consuming plenty of dairy products as a calcium deficiency can stunt your growth as well.  Besides calcium and protein you also need zinc and there is plenty of zinc in red meat, seafood and nuts.    If your pituitary gland is malfunctioning and not releasing enough HGH that could be a cause for your far below average height.  HGH injections by a doctor can help midgets and dwarfs to gain a few inches if this is the problem and their growth plates are still open.  A series of such injections is likely to cost at least $12,000 or even more and there are some possible and quite bad side effects.    You can find further information in web searches for "hgh to grow taller" and hgh + "side effects".    Sometimes a girl might be a late bloomer and in your case your growth spurt, which could be anything from 2 to 8 inches, is undoubtedly and hopefully still ahead of you.  Girls usually stop growing at 15 and often there is no further growth 2 or 3 years after your first period.  Growth after 15 is possible but uncertain.  The absolute deadline for further height growth is 21 but even height growth after 18 is uncommon.    Perhaps you can find some useful information in a web search for "how to grow taller naturally".|`|EivEhi8Gaa	You'll grown more, don't worry... you're only in the 8th grade.

I did a study on height so I hope I can help you.  Normally your growth is linked to puberty and when you get your period. Have you been a bit slow with those things too?  Also, how tall are your parents? You get your height from them.  If you're delayed with puberty and your parents are both average or tall then I guess you will have a growth spurt soon. The best thing to do is to eat healthy food and make sure you get enough sleep.  If being short is a big issue for you I have loads of tips on how to look taller than you really are. Just contact me through my profile to talk more.  Simon  ;-)|`|XQ0xL8inaa	Maybe because you are not eating enough!

jQxFXAdQaa	yes, you can purchase your blood sugar monitoring systems OTC. They are expensive.     Are you drinking excessively? I mean, are you ALWAYS thirsty? Any numbness/tingling in your hands/fingers? Are you always going to the bathroom (urine)? If you are a woman: are you getting frequent yeast infections?    All of these can be symptoms of diabetes. If you experience any of these, I would seek medical advice. Especially  if you have a family history of diabetes and/or you are over weight. I don't know how old you are, either.    If you cannot afford private health insurance, you should be able to qualify for government funded programs. If you do buy a BSM, and it reads high (I don't remember what the normal levels are, and I only had gestational diabetes, so the levels were much different for me anyway), then you MUST GO TO THE ER IMMEDIATELY!    Even if you don't have health insurance, they HAVE to treat you.    Google safe/normal blood sugar levels. I do remember the numbers are different at fasting and about an hour after a meal.    BUT, I'M NOT KIDDING. IF YOUR SUGAR IS HIGH- YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM IMMEDIATELY!! YOU CAN GO INTO A DIABETIC COMA AND DIE!!!|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	yes you can purchase testing stuff otc without a prescription, but your problem doesn't sound like diabetes, it sounds more like a cardiac issue... if you are way out of shape, the heart rate does stay elevated after vigorous exercise.  And if you are overweight, you run a real risk of heart attack unless you start with easy gentle exercise and work you way up to the more strenuous stuff slowly.  If you have convinced yourself that it's diabetes, be prepared, the strips alone are over fifty dollars a month, and the testers average about 150 each.|`|ZNbauLJzaa	What will you do with the data that you get from a glucometer?

Any way, heart rate and anxiety have nothing to do with diabetes.  Do some research about how to get low cost healthcare in your area so you can speak to a doc about your concerns.|`|DQkDQraOaa	Yes, you can buy a device at your local pharmacy.|`|pRF5LLloaa	You can save yourself money by PAYING for the doctor to do an A1C test.    the A1C test take an AVERAGE of your blood sugar readings over 90 days.  Taking ONE A1C test is like taking individual reading 4 times a day for 90 days.      Taking ONE A1C test is much cheaper than taking 360 individual readings! The meters cost about $100, and the test strips are about $1 each.  So that is almost $500, but a single A1C test only costs about $50.    if the A1C test comes back OK, then you only need to take it once, maybe twice a year.    As well, it is not likely that you heart rate is caused by a sugar problem, spending all that money to measure blood sugar could probably be spent in better ways.    I have heard that there is a "home" A1C test available at some pharmacies, but I have never seen one.|`|9ed48e03128fadf6393931a15386538daa	Gary B is correct. I have used the home A1c test. It has been recalled so you cannot buy them here in the states.    you need to see a doctor STAT. You have a few issues, and your glucose is not the only problem. You need the following:    A1c blood test.  fasting glucose  cbc  BP  EKG  treadmill test    If this seams crazy consider:    Elevated glucose will eventually create diabetic ketoacidosis, which untreated will kill you. Really.    Go to the doctor. The glucose monitor will be free to you from one touch ultra if you are a diabetic (online, order for free- get the strips on ebay for cheap). You need a check up and follow up diabetes education.    Please go to the doctor.    take care|`|0Rokad7Uaa	i think its not a blood sugar issue. you can buy test strips and a meter no problem but its SUPER expensive. i think you just need to take it easy on your excersizing - maybe its too intense?

Target and Wal-Mart each carry it but it may be under a house brand at Wal-mart, I'm not sure.  Look in the section where they have antacids.

Research before you assume.|`|YIXtGxypaa	Just don't push yourself to look up to a certain standard. I used to be very thin and pushed to stay that way, and now my thyroid has slowed my metabolism down, and I have difficulty losing weight. What you need to focus on more than anything is just staying healthy, and don't overdo your workouts for risk of bone and joint problems later. Too much exercise can lead to demineralization and calcium reabsorbtion from bones leaving you with brittle bones later in life. How much you exercise and weigh indicates you are a pretty healthy person, so be happy with how you are. (Most of these people you are in school with right now will not look good in a few years from not taking care of themselves.)
l7oyPpzIaa	you could be allergic or just sensitive 'up there'.|`|byHh0A3Eaa	probably scented ones duh|`|TORBP6QIaa	You could just use pads this next period and see if the pains etc go away.  If they don't then its not the tampons causing your pain.  What you are feeling is regular period pain ,many females worldwide suffer with the same thing every month.    I have used tampons for 30 years and I don't recall ever thinking a tampon is the cause of my cramps or pains.  I also get the sharp shooting pains you describe.  What I do is take Aleve (US) Naprogesic (Aus.) the active ingredient is Naproxen and it targets the prostaglandins that cause these pains...it works brilliantly in about 20 minutes.    PS...you dont need to use a scented tampon as the odor does not happen until the blood meets the air.|`|TKOWiRwQaa	Its the chemicals in the scented ones... you shouldnt us them, or maybe ur just not the person 4 them|`|IUQZFrMfaa	i've gotten cramps that (to quote baby mama), make me feel like someone's sticking a knife up my ***. yes i've gotten those before. once i got one that hurt SO badly i woke up having it and i couldn't even move a centimeter in bed until it passed because i felt like i was going to die. i don't know if that's normal, i dont even have my period. my sister does tho and i've never heard her complain about such bad cramps.

fOzP3CmWaa	TMJ syndrome most likely. The Temperal Mandibular Joint is the joint that hooks your jaw to your skull and can often become inflamed causing pain and stiffness. It sometimes can fell like you have an ear infection as well.     The inflammation can come and go and nobody really know the reason for it. Grinding your teeth at night and chewing gum have often been blamed for causing TMJ. You can try going to a pharmacy and picking up a mouth guard to wear at night to see if this helps the pain. Just ask a pharmacist what they recommend.     Most of the time TMJ is just an annoyance and there is not much you can really do about it other than NSAIDs (ibuprofen). If the pain really starts to interfere with your daily life you should see an ENT (Ear, Nose and Throat doctor) just to see if he has any other suggestions for you, and to make sure there is nothing else going on. Good luck!|`|PNODEaF1aa	you might have grinded your teeth when you went to bed last night. that can cause your jaw to hurt. whenever you move your jaw does it feel like it's tightening? sleeping with a move guard can help or using oragel|`|mZprL9TJaa	you could have TMJ which is Tempromandibular joint disorder where the joint is actually dislocated. This can cause a lot of pain in your jaw with chewing, talking or opening your mouth wide. Sometimes it can cause your jaw to lock up. If this keeps happening you might want to see an oral surgeon or your dentist and get there opinion. If your joint is dislocated an oral surgeon can do procedures to correct that problem. You could also have sinus problems mabye even a sinus infection that can cause jaw pain but you would most likely have other symptoms such as congestion and headache or pressure above your nose and eyes or even discoloration in nasal drainage.

The list goes on.  If you're stressing about some stuff you need to look at as if you can do something about it then do it and get it over with, if you can't then get over it.  If you're drinking a lot you should probably cut back and go to some meetings. If you're not eating, start eating I know women like to starve themselves for some stupid reason.

Good luck.|`|e7b9d32e1fb4efafbebd927303f7c128aa	Certainly cold weather takes its toll on hair, but you may be on to something with the ceasing of taking the YAZ... Birthcontrol pills alter your body chemistry and fool it into thinking it's pregnant  which can lead to stronger hair... post pregnancy it is common for women to suffer mild hair loss and damage due to the changes hormonally.    Give yourself a full month to a month and a half off the yaz - but keep track of the loss. If it starts becoming noticeable that you've lost hair (balding, patchy etc) see a doctor immediately. You should see your physician anyway to make sure that ceasing the YAZ was the best course and to make sure that there is nothing else going on.

Y1LTzXataa	Sodium bicarbonate is good for indigestion but if you want a cure for diarrhoea, you should try rice-water. Boil some rice and drain the water off it.

Good or bad thing?      I don't know.  At least you will not have acidosis anymore, ut it will take a day or two while you are getting rid of excess acids to end the diarrhea.     As a cure for diarrhea?  I don't think it will cure it on it's own.  But if you have a food Poison, then it might get rid of it.  If it continues for more than 3 days, it is best to seek a doctor, as it might be parasites, or serious food poising, or something like that.

Please do make sure that the rib isn't damaged so that it might pierce your lung; so xrays might be required.  If u're sore you could get some arnica gel by Borion and apply it; Borion isn't toxic like other analgesics.  I'm not sure where your pain is exactly, but if you've fallen, I'm sure that the rest of your body is in shock.  Any kind of trauma can create subluxations (a misalignment of bone  that impedes the transmission of  your nervous system since the vertebrae enclose the spinal cord). Your nervous system is used to communicate with the rest of your body and helps restore function and helps heal broken bones.  The whole body is interconnected and so it's likely there's more going on than a broken rib.  I advise you get a good recommendation to a chiropractor, even one that is certified in extremities so that they may help you heal faster and more effectively.   I hope that you get better soon!!

If you go to weight watchers sites and see the types of foods they have, write them down, make them at your own leisure without buying their stuff. Ultimately you save more money and loose weight faster.    http://www.weightwatchers.com/index.aspx    It makes no sense to sign up for programs especially since they have the foods you should stick with already posted online.

EMDR-Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing therapy is a life saver though. find a licensed therapist in your area who does this therapy and understands grief.   preferably, call your local hospice. they all do free grief counseling, but make sure the therapist does this type of therapy.   it really will change your life!|`|k26Vbizmaa	No.   I'm still blaming myself for the death of my brother.  even though i KNOW i couldn't help him.|`|ParFJxnSaa	I agree that the EFT is worth trying, (8 stages) and is addressed in sections 33 - 34, at ezy build, below. My main post on grief may be found in section 57, at http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/shaneris but I include below some things which, if she adopts, and practices them, may help. Doctor Wayne Dwyer once said: "Negative emotions are preceded by negative thoughts". It is important to regularly monitor, and deal with a negative internal monologue (self talk), or mental process, such as disturbing thoughts, images, impulses, or emotions, by the process of (a): recognising it, and (b): challenging it immediately.     Technique For Re-Programming Negative Thoughts: When you notice something negative, such as: "I'm never going to get over this!" or: "Why am I always so pathetic/useless/such a loser?" or even: "I can't do this/will never get over this!", even an image, emotion, or a memory; recognise that this is being generated from the negative part of your mind. Having identified and labelled it, visualise a large, red, flashing, "STOP!" sign, and/or possibly a stern faced person wagging an index finger at you in a negative manner, then say to yourself as forcefully as you can, even aloud in a big voice, if alone: "I know this tactic: GO AWAY FOR A WHILE !!!" You may want to use either: "ruse", "ploy", "game", or "trick", instead of "tactic". In the case of an image, visualise a large "STOP" sign, or your preferred version. Some people go so far as to keep a wide rubber band in their pocket, then put it around their wrist, when they catch themselves backsliding, stretch and release it, as a method of reprogramming their mind sooner, but I don't regard it as being strictly necessary.     Remember to remove it, afterwards, if you use this method. Try replacing a negative thought with a positive affirmation of your choice, like: "I am a unique individual, with my own set of skills, and good points", or "I may not be perfect, but I'm doing the best I can, right now". Practice one of the relaxation methods in sections 2, 11, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed. Tai Chi, or yoga suits others better. Alternatively, give the EFT a good tryout, to see if it helps you. There is also a version for use in public places, (if you like, you can claim to have a headache, as you massage/lightly tap your temples, but you would then be restricted to subvocalising: saying it to yourself in your mind). Section 53, and pages 2, 2.q and 2.o at ezy-build also refer: "Even though I sometimes suffer from recrimination, I deeply and completely accept myself." Neurofeedback treatment for anxiety is increasingly becoming available.     Herbal remedies, such as valerian, (which is not recommended for use if depression is also present) passionflower, or St.John's wort, are often effective, but the idea is (as with anxiolytic medication) to use them like water wings, or training wheels on a bicycle, providing initial support, and giving time for other treatments, such as therapy, and relaxation techniques, to take effect. Imagine, as vividly as you possibly can, that your concerns, anxieties, worries, fears, your self-recriminations, all the agonizing "I'm-so-Stupids," and "I'm-too-fats"; every painful "I-can't-I-have-it" or "I-can't-do-it"are huge raging, hurtful bulls snorting and charging at you. You see them coming at you and you hold out your red matador's cape at arms length and simply let them charge right by. Every time they come at you, hold out your arm with the red cape and let them rage and snort and go right on past.
S1jddreQaa	either discharge or a yeast infection, nothing really too serious. Just tell you mom, if its a yeast infection you might need to get a medication.|`|Ajhh3y0Paa	its discharge its normal. it means ur gonna get ur period soon and if it smells u should tell ur parents it might be a yeast infection.|`|WcurY9Mtaa	It coulld either be discharge or yeast infection..if it is discharge then you will get your period soon..and if it is yeast infection tell your mom or dad..who evr you feel comfterbale with. If you are not sure what it is..tell your mom or dad|`|KsgdRHfNaa	ok it means you might get your period soon. also, if your afraid of telling your mom, write her a note. say mom i got my period, but im not ready to talk. ask her to leave supplies in the bathroom, and you can talk when your ready...good luck =D|`|niomGtsxaa	discharge duh duh duh duh Periode is a coming|`|x6eq1XRvaa	discharge
654CKsm9aa	Well that's where your lungs are, so it's definitely not safe.  I don't know about fainting, but I guess it's possible. You could get out of breath and faint.|`|f7fe854f34875855e7bddc879f7c8ff9aa	You could put enough pressure on your diaphragm to make yourself woozy.  I doubt that you could keep yourself from breathing for long though.|`|kJ7tmwE6aa	no i faint when im scared..  or whenever im around or in a hospital.  i cant stand it, so i faint. lol|`|zE6KabiWaa	1. thats disgusting  2. probly dangerous too  3. therefore i guarantee you can :D|`|1NzCH71Haa	I cannot do this.|`|zTal4HIGaa	yes you can i've done it before|`|QhSSPBLfaa	no i dont think so    but if u sit on a chair for ages staring up at the celing then stand up im pretty sure u faint    but dont try it|`|VZIHy5fLaa	I can make myself faint by rubbing my hands underneath my armpits and sniffing them too hard because I never use deodorant.    Hope this helps,  Liz|`|EZmDdNl2aa	It's possible.|`|DWJGyxDOaa	xD lol. damn first of all it is not possible to put your hand under you rib cage and you would definitely faint if you touched you heart (ribcage on the left) and you could die if you touch your heart. your heart it not meant to be touched and your ribs do not move so that you can put you hand under them. why would you need gloves if you can put your hand in your ribs|`|99hfFssXaa	NO, I just did it and nothing happened|`|e4QW4xvOaa	Put enough pressure, and that would kill you; as many of your vital organs are located under your ribcage. It's there for a reason, to protect your vital organs. It's best not to mess with it either.|`|j6RDbnl6aa	i don't think that is possible, unless you are very skinny.|`|bc02d98790d5ca24c3abee27d698edbeaa	It does work, but I think only if you do it hard enough.  I've seen it happen but it was when someone did it to someone else.|`|m3ThrbDMaa	Yes, but never on the first date...|`|qX0KdYUjaa	Also you can faint if you stick your fingers deep inside your vagina. Its tested.|`|MK8JvIJNaa	why u ask this ?|`|aVXsqdLpaa	You would have to hurt yourself before you fainted.  The best way to faint is not to eat for two days.  That will do it.|`|oojVKGjCaa	hahaha wow no but i heard that too|`|XOj3dd3qaa	no|`|JyS5FYOnaa	Interestingg..... ?_?    Well, i just tried it, and no passing out action, so im gonna say no. Unless i was doing it wrong.  I'll get back too you on this onee.|`|zNOstTOJaa	yes but only if u manage to keep it there like that for a few minutes( u prob wont(unless someone else is doing it fo u) cuz its just likae holding ur breath...u cant cause of the pain)
31Xl7M5faa	Well first your mom should wait in the waiting room and not go in the room at least during your exam.  There is no way to detect if you've had sex or with how many people so relax there.  BUT be honest with the doctor about your sexual health no matter what the circumstance! He/she needs to know everything to make sure that your are in the best reproductive health you can be.  Good Luck and don't stress|`|MHFuJGdGaa	You weren't raped.  Stop lying to yourself.    Also, you don't have to be a virgin for your "cherry" to have popped.|`|j4rirb8laa	Mums do understand.She should be more loving to you because of your pass.  Why cant you see the Dr on your own.  Good luck.|`|b6QzfsMUaa	You can always ask your mom to leave.|`|x3NIn6rSaa	Alright  you can't just go screaming and yell  you have to make the vibe right  sit her down let her know in a serious way  a tear wouldn't hurt either|`|6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	When you have the pap smear done the only people that will be in the room is you, the doctor and maybe a nurse.  You mother will be sitting in the waiting room.  So she will not idea of what is going on in the room unless you come out and tell her.  Since you are over the age of 13 your doctor can not tell your mother anything.  It has been two yeas since you were raped, so you can just go on and keep the act to yourself or you can try to explain it to her and make sure she understand that you are not lying and you were just afraid to tell anyone.  But if you have been okay with that then do not bring it up or it will bring back bad memories for you, having to explain it and all.  But as far as your doctor first she will not know anything that you do not tell her.  But if your mother was aware of anything she would know that you can not get a pap smear done until you have had sex.|`|Y9DCuWPIaa	Ok I wasn't going to reply to this question until I read that guy Justins response. Typical man. Has it ever happened to you?    Unless it has, you can never truely understand why its not "sheer idiocy" to keep it to yourself. There can be a feeling of shame, there can be blaming yourself, or a fear of having someone else blame you, for having a few drinks, for wearing revealing clothes, for being so stupid that you let him walk you home.   Theres a fear of your brother/father finding out and beating the guy to a pulp. Getting arrested. Getting thrown in jail. Whos fault is it?  Theres a fear of talking through it with the police, having them take your clothes, your underwear and accompaning you to a hospital. Having them read the very intimate doctors report.     When it goes to court, it can feel like YOUR the one in the wrong. 2/3/4 years later and the events of the worst night of your life is being read out and argued and intimate details being discussed in front of your parents. Having the rapists barrister try tear you to pieces in the stand.     Will my mom and dad ever look at me the same way again?  Will my boyfriend ever be able to look at me the same way?  Did I deserve it?    So, no. Keeping it to herself is not stupid. It does not make her an idiot. Don't talk about something so horrific when you understand absolutely nothing about it.|`|6yy0jtzDaa	Unless ur mom is the gyno they can not tell her anything about your sexual history just go in the room by yourself you do have the right to go without her just tell her your not comfortable having her in there with someone poking at your vag|`|ACnb0UhLaa	she doesn't have to go in the room with you and technically your doctor cant tell her anything w/o your permission      or just tell her and if she doesn't believe you then shes in the wrong|`|OIPZS74Xaa	I'm not gay but you should just tell her. She's not going to be mad at you or anything...|`|AA11788494	I think you should tell the doctor.  Let him make a report.  If you mother doesn't believe then that is her fault.  I think she may believe you though.|`|t315IBLNaa	Personally, I think you should sit her down and tell her. You can't keep a secret like that from your mom. She might deny it, but she'll be there for you.|`|WqkFJ2Pgaa	It's okay. First of all, your hymen can be broken by physical activity, not just sex, so your doctor may assume you're a virgin if you don't tell her the truth (I think you should tell her the truth, though). If she does know you had sex, she won't tell your mom. I think it's against the law in most states, actually.|`|938a2d00c5a47f7e019534c2ab49c3fbaa	how worried could she be you were in foster care  she should kill your foster parent or the person who raped you not you chill out maybe now would be the time to let her know unless you were not raped make sure you tell the truth lots of innocent people not saying you werent raped but lots go to jail for lies please be truthful and it may help you cope with what you held in better be honest ill pray for you and your mom too.|`|5fdgfNCRaa	If you were raped it is NOT YOUR FAULT. NOT YOUR FAULT.  NOT YOUR FAULT. Please understand this. Your mom cannot blame you. I admit that foster homes aren't always the best places to grow up but I'm willing to bet that you wouldn't have been in foster care to begin with if your mom had been being a good mom and doing what she should have been doing. If anyone is to be blamed, it's the person that raped you and your mom for putting you in an unsafe situation.    That being said, I think you should tell your mom. Since the doctor's appointment is soon, you need to decide what to do. Generally, I don't think parents are required to be in the exam room and since that's a pretty private thing to do/see, she should be understanding of it if you want it to just be you and the doctor.     KEEP IN MIND... you said your mom wouldn't believe you if you said you were raped, correct? You may want to tell your doctor. You're under 18 so your mom can find out what went on in your pap (how you're doing etc) so if your hymen is broken, your mom can find out. Do you want to keep it from the doctor and from your mom? Your mom will think you just slept around. If you tell your doctor she can at least tell ur mom the truth. She's gonna find out either way, it might as well be the truth.   Just please go to the appt and get looked at. You might have contracted an std so please be tested for those too. Your mom needs to understand that you weren't a careless slut, you're a victim.   I wish you the best,   good luck!|`|j1YHYXaFaa	noo you cant tell after this long.  you would only be able to tell that day adn the day after.  not longer then that..|`|x5nWWyylaa	theres no way for them to tell if you are a virgin  because the hymen is easily broken doing any activity  no worries sweetie.|`|Ed5sIoA2aa	she doesnt have to know!!!    tell her you dont feel comfortable with her in there cause its too awkward or something like that    and the doctor CANT say your not a virgin because its supposed to be confidental!!|`|4wsMXrWZaa	Well, You should probably tell the police.  Then tell your mother, because i dont see how she could get mad at your for getting raped.|`|tsCXQhMmaa	gynos are good with confidentiality. just ask for your mom to be out of the room. you dont have to tell the doctor you were raped but if she/he asks if you are sexually active just say yes.|`|zMbOiwFtaa	Well a Papsmere can be embarrassing so just tell your Mom you are uncomfortable and want her to leave. There is no way they can tell if you are a virgin or not, a lot of girls lost there Hymen while Bicycling its just a thin piece of tissue that can be broken WITHOUT penetration.|`|0b942db656cf91b93e0853fad2dd236eaa	This is going to sound rude, and in all ways isn't.  If you were raped, its shear idiocy  that you didn't tell anyone.  Yes i understand you may have been scared, but it led you to this situation.    Just sit down and talk with her|`|dvht9KlIaa	you cont tell|`|xcHnS4Jsaa	im dying to know how Gary G is stating it like a fact that you werent raped  whateverrr  you should tell your mom right away because getting raped isnt your fault and if your serious with her she will belive you & you need to catch the guy who did this to you   and the doctor wont know if your a virgin or not hymens can be broken while playing sports or many other ways|`|FHCkczemaa	You need to report this low life..He needs to be stopped from harming someone else..  it may save someone's life..anyone that would rape a 14 year old would do anything...|`|bzST3EcWaa	the doctor will ask ur mom to leave the room when she asks you questions like that
rHSEbb3naa	Hmm, she needs to go to a chemist and ask for some thread worm tablets - everyone gets worms their extremly common and spread easily. All you have to do is ask at the chemist if your unsure. it's just a tablet that you have to chew its vulgar but it kills them and 2 weeks later you take another to ensure they've gone.  Remind her that she should wash her hands after shes been to the toilet please :) oh and please, less slang!|`|S1jddreQaa	Your spelling teacher should be fired.|`|JB8samC7aa	You could try learning to spell first...that might help you get your question answered.|`|Dwe6aO4naa	What?|`|ACnb0UhLaa	your an idiot i think they help you need it speaking english! and yes you need it now BADLY!|`|r98neii5aa	Try your hardest to make her tell her parents, they really so know and be there to help her. And as for the 1st answer person we seriously done need to know your life story jeepers creepers, the girl asked the question, if you didnt wana anwser you didnt have to!?|`|AA11625446	http://www.netpharmacy.co.nz/107/news/26...    check this out it should help, but if I am reading correctly, she might have thread worm or pin worm?  She needs to tell her mother so she can go to the doctor to be treated..|`|AA11788494	I don't really understand what you are saying as you write in slang.  She probably doesn't have worms if her mom doesn't know about it.  You have to get your poop tested for that, unless it is ring worm.|`|ZHSFyxqSaa	stop typing like that  it's annoying and people do not understand you|`|wXrAqf8Caa	im sorry, i dont know what to do, and can you please slow down and type the paragraph right???|`|HDUq1ls7aa	I agree you do need help.

ph0nXt7paa	My dad, age 60, was diagnosed with liver cancer (a hepatoma specifically) in August. We used the Nexavar until last week, and the side effects were awful and the tumor kept growing. He also started getting extremely high levels of amonia in his blood, which caused him to become delusional and required hospitiliziaton for at least 5 days each time (8 times in about 13 weeks), while they rehydrated him. My mom died December 1, 2008, so I don't know a whole lot of the details from the beginning of the treatment, but I know that since stopping the Nexavar, he is slightly stronger and more alert. He also recieves regular blood transfusions to keep his platelet count up and to keep him stronger. HIs prognosis at this point is only about 3 weeks, but they'll be better than they would have been on the Nexavar. Its normal to be scared. Don't worry about making mistakes or trying to do the right thing....its all about making your step dad comfortable, making sure you consider his wishes and keeping a positive outlook, even if you know bad things are going on.

hoDin3UYaa	First off, Congratulations on trying to enter the Air Force    I think that you should see a doctor to locate the cause of your knee problems. Treating the injury will ultimately help you reach your goals.    Also, try getting a personal trainer to assist you in losing weight, and in the mean time, try to keep the same routine each day. Keeping the same routine will not only help you in staying focused but it will also keep you motivated.    Good Luck|`|wOSBjO9caa	Depends on what type of injury: strain or strain of a ligament should eventually heal, but a partially torn ligament may or may not. Same for a torn meniscus - that generally requires surgery, as does a ligament that is completely torn, which requires reconstructive surgery. Also, a torn tendon always requires surgery.

776XWUYfaa	No of couse this is not normal.  However, it doesn't really sound like it is heat related.  Please seek the advice of your chosen Medical Doctor,  Perhaps you are experiencing high blood pressure, or some other malady.  You can go on line and seek out more of your symptoms at the link below.      http://symptoms.webmd.com/default.htm|`|jVsN7N6maa	You say the benzoyl peroxide is not always effective? I'm not sure exactly what your mean, but I've found that applying a thin layer over my entire face, as the products usually suggest, doesn't work as well as applying a thicker layer to just the problem areas. That is, I don't use it as a preventative-- because it doesn't seem to work for that purpose-- I just use it to help any blemishes that have already came up go away faster. Actually, the benzoyl peroxide irritates your skin, so if you put it everwhere, you have to be extra careful about touching your face; if you just put in on some spots, you just have to avoid those. I think what really prevents new break outs is sticking to a washing and toning routine.    For washing, I use any plain, non-foaming, acne face wash. As long as it washes off without leaving any residue, and does a good job of leaving my skin oil-free (but not overly dry), I think it's a good product. To get the benefit of the medication (usually I use the benzoyl peroxide based ones) I leave it on for a minute or so before washing it off. But the main point of the washing is to clear your face and prepare it for the toner, which is what's actually going to help your skin repair itself.    For toning, what I use depends on the time of day. Have you tried vinegar and lemon juice? Squeeze a lemon into a cup of vinegar, and apply the mixture with a cotton ball and let it air dry. The smell is strong, but this definitely kills bacteria before it can worsen acne infections, so I use this at night before I go to bed. It also makes your skin smoother, but you have to apply it with a light touch, as it stings, especially on inflamed areas. In the mornings, I use witch hazel, or one of those toners that come with acne face wash, again applied with a cotton ball and left to air dry, then apply aloe vera gel to moisture my skin without leaving it feeling greasy. Aloe vera gel is the best moisturizer! If you can find the gel that contains vitamin e also, that's even better. After that dries, then I use a layer of benzoyl peroxide on any pimples or irritated bumps.    I don't like to put anything on my skin at night-- even aloe vera. Really, you should give your skin some time to rest and do its own thing uninterrupted at some point.    Weekly changes of your bedsheets and pillowcases, and showering before you go to bed (making sure you get your hair, too-- that's a big repository of oil) helps A LOT. I think the oils and gunk that builds up on you during the day get into the sheets and rubbed all over your face, otherwise. Whatever the reason, my break outs occur less often and are of less severity since I started doing this.

1HeW6F6qaa	The pain thing is general for vaginal irritation. This could be nothing, or could be the start of something. I recommend giving it a day or so to see if it worsens.    Yeast infections are not painful; they are unconquerable urges to scratch down there. This is caused by long-term exposure to moisture. If you do get one, there are some cheaper creams to use to soothe and eventually cure it.|`|Vr0f7w8Xaa	It may be a bladder infection! Most likely. It happens alot.

Now we prefer just chilling at home or having a couple of friends over for a bbq or going to a friends place for a bbq or dinner. But that's not all that often.

zBaFsGhiaa	What you are doing is designed to relieve some of the discomfort (which you don't have) and itchiness, but will not get rid of them.  High fiber and increasing the amount of water you drink should also help soften your bm's and therefore prevent new hemi's.

Then she will have you go into a room adn sit on the table and take your blood pressure and check your pulse.  All while taking a few notes.  The she will leave.  Before she leaves if you are getting a pap smear or cervical exam she will instruct you to undress and put on a gown.  Then the doctor will come in and ask you the reason for your visit.  He will perform the pap smear and cervical exam, talk to you some more.  Then tell you to get up and get dressed.  If he thinks you have an infection he will let you know.  When you leave you will stop at the front desk and get the prescription if needed, pay if you have to and make another appointment if needed.  I believe that is all that happens in the office.|`|kJ7tmwE6aa	LOL. they check your pulse or whatever.  hit your knees with the little hammer.  make you do the breathing thing.      thats all my doctor did.|`|6yy0jtzDaa	They take your height and weight check your blood pressure and temp look in your ears and listen to your lungs and they might make you touch your toes or walk on your toes  ask you if you have any physical problems or any questions simple things that shouldn't be a problem all doctors are different but those are the basics|`|LijKVPUYaa	do for what?    Just spIt it out!|`|WqkFJ2Pgaa	At regular physicals, they do weight and height, blood pressure, heart and lung sounds, pulse, look in eyes, ears, etc. I think you're talking about a pap smear, though, where they examine your girl parts.    You change into a gown and lay down on the bed with your feet in stirrups. The doctor opens your knees and shines a really hot light on you. She puts on gloves and slides a speculum into your vagina, which is this weird-looking plastic device that opens you up a little so the doctor can see your cervix. She brushes your cervix with a couple q-tips, then you're done. She'll also poke and prod your belly to feel your uterus and ovaries, and probably do a breast exam, too. None of it hurts, and it goes much easier if you relax. It's over in a couple minutes. If you have any questions about sex or your body, you can ask your doctor while you're there. It's weird the first couple times, but nothing to worry about.|`|ICraIZLiaa	they check you   i mean it depends on your age  they check if u r developed righ or not  i know that it'weird leting the doctor see  but that's wat they hav to do  By the way haz to be a lady doc for girls|`|WlRylbs4aa	I was so nervous because I had to get my first real physical a week ago but it was not bad at all.

iAv9P3HTaa	here are the best exercises for hard core abs:    Side Bends    * Holding a dumbbell in you right hand, stand with feet shoulder width apart and your knees slightly bent.  * Place your left hand behind your head and slowly bend sideways to your right lowering the dumbbell down to your knee.  * Return to an upright position and repeat for the desired number of reps.    Medicine Ball Sit Ups    * Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor.  * Hold a medicine ball (choose a 5 pound ball to begin) to your chest and have a partner stand at your feet (not on them).  * Push your lower back into the floor flattening the arch and hold.  * As you curl up throw the ball to your partner. Hold the crunch as your partner catches the ball and throws it back to you.  * Catch the ball and slowly return to the start position.  * Tip: Don't sit right the way up as you wait for the return pass. Your shoulders should be no more than 6 inches off the floor.    Weighted Curls with Medicine Ball    * Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor.  * Hold a medicine ball (or weight plate) to your chest (start with 5 pounds).  * Push your lower back into the floor flattening the arch and hold.  * Curl up just enough to lift both your shoulders off the floor a few inches.  * Hold for a count of 2 and return to the start position.    Cable Crunch    * This exercise requires a triceps pushdown machine with a rope attachment.  * Knee down in font of the machine holding the rope just above your head.  * Slowly crunch down to your right knee and hold for 2 seconds as you breathe out.  * Return to the start position slowly and repeat to the left knee.    Abdominal Exercise Guidelines  Perform several (3-5) abdominal exercises 3-5 times a week. Start with exercises and repetitions that are comfortable for your fitness level and as you improve increase the number of repetitions.

An act like this at my school would result in expulsion.  You definitely should have at the time.

In fact, to me the "scrawny + big belly" build is the most out of shape build in the world.  Cause you should be thin.  you probably have good genetics, but you're doing everything wrong.    How long it takes to get rid of it - or even if you do - is the result of how much effort you put into it.      Check your local yahoo pages and see if there is a crossfit gym in your area.  If so, go to it, and follow their nutrition guidelines.  you'll lose the fat.

2w1pmTpMaa	A good weight to shoot for is 120 pounds. The general rule is to be 100 pounds at 5'0'' and add five pounds for every inch after that. That means you need to lose forty-eight pounds.

bdc0c1d1aead267282553512169a9932aa	depends on the bones and what was done...if you don't have a gene problem where the bones grow due to disease, then NO the bones probably won't grow back.  But if you have surgery and the bones need to knit to keep the 'join' stable, then yes they will.    It's like when you break a bone (arm, leg, etc) it will grow back to knit the bone together, and sometimes it will over grow a bit, if that happens they take a bit off.    Usually bones don't over grow..

It take several weeks to notice any difference once you start a healthy plan.  If you want to lose the weight and are very serious about it, consult a personal trainer and a nutritionist.

You can not spot check the parts of your body that need improvement.  Sit ups aren't going to make the fat on your stomach go away.  It will make the muscles underneath look good but your body burns fat proportionately throughout your whole body.  Depending on how over weight you are you most likely won't be able to get a flat stomach in a month.  The best thing you can do is get your diet in check, stop with those stupid pills.  Take the 3 meals you should normally eat in a day and turn the same amount of food into 6 meals spread closely through the day to keep your metabolism burning fat at a higher rate than usual all day.  On top of that you need to get a good excercise routine going consisting of just more than sit ups.  You have to work your whole body. The more muscle you put on your body the more fat you will burn faster. 10lbs of lean muscle will burn 1 pound of fat per week on its own.  The more muscle you gain will in turn burn more and more fat combined with controlling your metabolism and working out. Just because you're putting on muscle doesn't mean you're going to get buff (if you're a female and that's not what you want). Muscle can be Lean but dense which is what women would want to go for so you still get the muscle without the mass. Don't take those stupid diet pills because when you stop taking them you're going to gain weight because they alter your body's natural hormones and then you get them all out of wack when you stop.  Do things the natural way.|`|Fk2DxGKCaa	It takes time for hard work to pay off.

Let me say that differently- you CAN achieve it :o) but I don't want to give you an unrealistic solution or answer. First off- change the way you eat. If you're scarfing down lattes and ice cream like I use to...then you're not going to get anywhere. I didn't get a flat stomach under 4 weeks, it took me about 12 weeks. Don't get discouraged, this takes time. I ate 6 small meals everyday. By doing this you can regulate your metabolism and that way you're fueling your body with a small amount of food every couple of hours. So for example, you wake up in the morning so eat breakfast within the first hour. Three hours later if you're hungry and it's still before lunch time, have a mid-morning snack like an apple and reduced fat peanut butter. Then three hours later, have your lunch, then three hours later your afternoon snack, and then your dinner. The key is- if you're hungry even after your meal-you're not eating enough. That is when you can increase the amount of food you eat at each meal. Eating 6 times a day will prevent you from overeating and over loading on calories at the end of the day. If you want to see a flat belly, you're going to have to lose the fat. It's simple-you can not see that badass six pack unless you melt the layer of fat sitting on it. So your best bet is to incorporate cardio into your exercise regimen. This will burn calories and pump blood into your system. Doing it for 1/2 an hour is good, but I usually try to do it for 40 minutes. The reason I say this is because after 20 minutes your body goes into this fat burning machine. It's done using the energy stored from the food you ate hours before, so then it relies on the stored fat in your body for energy. You should also lift weights in addition to doing cardio. Women think that it's bad for them to lift weights but that's a huge misconception. Lifting weight actually increases your metabolism- it's proven that you're still burning calories AFTER you're done strength training. It promotes lean muscle mass, so if you keep at it...you'll definitely see definition in your triceps, and maybe even your abs depending on what exercises you perform. My advice to you is to switch off with your workout. Try this if you're interested:     Monday 30-45 minutes of cardio (if you just started working out do low intensity cardio, like power walking)    Tues: Upper body strength training (shoulders, triceps, biceps, upper back etc.)    Wed: another 30-45 minutes of cardio  Thursday: Lower body strength training ( thighs, butt, calves)  Friday: cardio again   Sat/Sun: your days off. Your body needs the rest.     Depending on how fast you want results and how much time you're willing to put into this you can definitely do upper and lower body in the same day- but i wouldn't recommend it if you're a newbie to working out. Your muscles need at least 2 days to rest in between. This is my workout routine and I've lost quite a bit of body fat. I'm studying to be a dietitian so if you have any questions on what you should eat-or even other exercises please don't hesitate to ask. I would be happy to help if I can. Good Luck, have faith in yourself. Congrats to you for making the choice to lose weight and live a healthier life.|`|mXTrncR7aa	Rome was not built in a day!

Usually these surgeries are for people that can't lose weight by diet and exercise. people who have motivation to lose weight and not people that are looking for an easy way out to lose excess weight. Try to get help with your emotional problems that lead to the excess eating. Then try to diet and exercise and see where that goes. If that doesn't work then maybe you would qualify.

Vj13f7zmaa	The root canal tooth does not fall out, but if you don't get it crowned, it will eventually crack.  If you get it crowned, it is generally fine for your lifetime after that point.  The tooth is not alive after a root canal.  Basically after the root canal is done, you wait about a month, and then they go back and grind the tooth down, and set a post in the remaining root and put a crown... a fake tooth.. onto that post.  I have 3.  They are fine.|`|gViGPF0Faa	well...your tooth will be "dead' . There will be no nutrients or anything going to it. It will stay in your gums, but it is very easily breakable. i got a root canal two years ago, and that tooth has been chipping like crazy. the dentist said i have to get it capped soon, or the whole thing will keep chipping. I don't think it will fall out.|`|briRpzL1aa	This depends on where you live...  Meaning, the US they crown everything, but elsewhere they only crown if the tooth discolors and/or cracks..    You are correct that the tooth will eventually get more brittle over time.  How many roots were destroyed will ultimately determine how brittle the tooth gets.  Also, discoloration only occurs in about 50% of the time, so if this occurs then it makes sense from a visual standpoint to crown the tooth.    Good Luck and I Hope this Helps..

And, deodorant will not make it get infected.|`|uAK7VpiNaa	You should try going to a doctor|`|ppNm3MORaa	Cover any small blisters with a dry adhesive dressing like a large bandaid strip. Larger blisters should be covered with a gauze pad or dressing that you can then tape in place. If you have a blister in a position that is causing you pain or that makes it likely to burst (on the bottom of your foot or palm of your hand), its important to cover it with a soft dressing to pad and protect it. Then change the dressing daily.    If a blister bursts open, take care to refrain from peeling off the burst skin from top of the blister. This is very important in the case of very large blisters that occur on the legs in cases of diabetes and poor circulation. Peeling off this "dead" skin can allow infections to enter the open wound and can ultimately lead to necrosis (dead tissues) and even amputation of the leg. The most severe cases of cellulitis infections that occur in such blister infections can lead to death if untreated. Go to a doctor if you have a blister larger than a half dollar coin.|`|N0k6iZFRaa	Get checked for mrsa asap!

Most men have their "best" erection just after getting good REM sleep as they wake up.  Do not worry about it, your fine.

You can divert you thoughts by thinking of something that curbs you erection response from such thoughts or situations.  Its all normal!!|`|ni06WWg4aa	If you are healthy, get used to waking up with an erection every morning. It is normal. And for most men (and I'm a female), men can get an erection from the wind blowing. Don't worry about it. If it gets erect, place it at 12:00 so it isn't too noticeable. Enjoy it dear.

fQebKAWlaa	As per medical science no reason can be attributed to the increase blood pressure. But many alternatives are there to reduce the same.      Good Luck.!!|`|brvOa9QYaa	too much salt  too little exercise  obesity  stress.|`|gSo4dR7oaa	Anxiety or stress, high salt intake, and some medications can increase blood pressure.|`|Y0eVhjiPaa	lots of things,     short answer, salt, fluid, exercise, stress    long answer: blood pressure is produced by the amount of force your blood exerts on the blood vessles. It will increase any time the blood vessles get smaller, the amount of blood plasma increases, or the harder the heart pumps. Therefore any one of these things can cause your blood pressure to rise.     One of the most common ways to control your blood pressure is to control your salt. As you eat lots of salt it is absorbed into your bloodstream and with it a lot of water is drawn in as well (wherever salt goes, water follows). Therefore eating a lot of salt effectively increases the amount of blood you have in your body which causes the blood to press harder on the vessles, increasing your blood pressure.    Stress and exercise can also increase blood pressure by causing your heart to beat hader and faster as your body tries to provide more oxygen to your body. It causes the blood to be pumped out which much more force which in turn causes your blood pressure to rise.    Laying down can also increase your blood pressure (as measured in your arms) as the blood no longer is pulled down by gravity (this is sometimes why people who are anemic pass out when they stand up, their pressure is fine laying down but when the stand up the blood rushes to their feet and they no longer have enough).    Your blood pressure can also change in response to how wide open or constricted your arteries are, some drugs, or stress, as well as other factors cause the vessles to get bigger and smaller which alters the pressure (the same amount of blood in a smaller space causes more pressure to be put on teh vessle walls which means the persons BP rises)|`|dEef3vVuaa	Salt, fluid, eating more food, exercise, stress... lots of stuff|`|NRQXmIcwaa	cholesterol

tEmnBO5Kaa	Well if you had a lot of calculous and tartar around the tooth it can feel loose since it is being pulled away from your gums from all of the debris. After a really good cleaning the gum will tend to tighten up and make the tooth more secure.  Flossing is the best prevention.|`|kvsdv19Naa	Floss, massage your gums, brush after eating.  You can use mouthwashes or dental rinses to reduce bacteria in the mouth;  try one with goldenseal and myrrh (see below).  Or use an alkalyzing mouthwash such as Alka-Thyme.  Supplement with CoQ10 and vitamin C.  This will increase the integrity of the gums.  Think about supplementing calcium if your loose tooth is due to bone loss.  Reduce consumption of sugars which the bacteria love--don't feed them.    Take this seriously!  Bleeding gums is the first sign of pyorrhea which leads to tooth loss.  Trust me, I found out the hard way.
K60MPna1aa	You can still get the vaccine. It protects against the 4 most common types of HPV (out of over a hundred) so even if you have one or two types, you would still benefit from protection against the other 2. You and your doctor should discus if it's still worth it.
Yu7y6yfraa	I would guess that you have a problem with your inner ear or your sinuses that affect your inner ear. I can certainly relate to this.  If you have any sinus problems make sure to keep your nose flushed with saline and you might need to takeantihistaminess and/or decongestants.  Sometimes, fluid get trapped in the inner ear and keeping the sinuses clear will help it drain.    Because of my sinus problems I see both an Allergist and an Ear, Nose and Throat doctor, on a regular basis.      You might want to see an Ear, Nose and Throat specialist.  That is where you will problaby receive the best help.  My doctors have me take Meclazine, an antihistimine, when the vertigo bothers me.  It is very helpful and not as sedating as Dramamine.  Both work well.  Also, I find Bendryl to be very helpful.  Basically, lessening the inflammation in the sinuses can relieve inner ear problems.    If you see a doctor, do not take anything for your problems before you go.  It will mask your symptoms and your doctor may not be able to determine the source of your problem as well.  The doctor may have you place your head in various tilted positions and ask how you feel.    Vertigo problems can also be related to your eyes and vision.  You may notice when you ride in a car and stay focused straight ahead, you are fine; but, if you look around, you get nauseous.       There are exercises that often help with vertigo.  I listed a link that explains instructions for some of them.    There are many things that are causing this, but I would guess that it is your inner ear or eyes.  I hope you get this checked out.  I know how uncomfortable this can be.    Oh yes, you are gramatically correct with your use of the word nauseous.    I hope you get to feeling better.|`|7sA8HwTzaa	First of all, you feel nauseated, not 'nauseous.'    You probably have some sort of inner ear issues going on.  Got to the doctor and tell them that you feel nauseated.  You can try taking Dramamine for the problem, before your appointment to see if it helps.  If not, you really should be checked out.    Nausea can be the first symptom of literally hundreds of diseases.  Make an appointment.    Nauseous people make OTHER people feel nauseated.|`|NRQXmIcwaa	Diabetes?  check your blood sugar.|`|hLohtlPEaa	Nausea for that amount of time can be from fluid in the ear. It's a kind of vertigo. I would go and get checked out by the doctor.

Running on a treadmill is little like 'real' running where your body constantly adapts to the terrain and your brain also is constantly fed information about your changing surroundings.    You are also only 15 and probably still growing, so conventional dieting doesn't apply to you.|`|Mkroj9gPaa	15 pounds probably. running in so good for you! you need to run for more than 30 mins though to really see optimum results|`|bNphTSCiaa	you will lose a noticeable amount of weight.  just eat well:  remember to eat healthily and also eat when you are hungry.

Long bouts with a UTI can lead to complications like kidney infections, so it's best to cure it as quickly as possible. You do that with antibiotics.

Grapefruit seed extract is a multipurpose (broad spectrum) compound that is currently being used in humans and animals alike to safely fight many types of internal and external infections caused from parasites (single and multi-celled), viruses, bacteria and fungi.     Grapefruit seed extracts biggest benefit is due to it's multipurpose (broad spectrum) effect. It is effective even if the causes of the infections are known, unknown or misdiagnosed. By eliminating a wide range of dangerous pathogens grapefruit seed extract actually enhances the immune system.    Also ask them about other natural antibiotics such as Colloidal Silver, Olive Leaf Extract, Vitamin C supplementation in a powdered form with bioflavonoids too.    Olive leaf extract has been used as a natural antiotiobic for thousand years, but it is only recently that scientific research has shown that its active ingredient oleuropein, has the ability to fight a broad range of infective microorganisms.... Oleuropein has been proven to be very effective as an anti bacterial, antiviral anti fungal and also very effective in fighting yeasts and parasites in laboratory studies.    raw garlic is a very powerfull antibiotic that fights bacteria, parasites and viruses ........ and is also good for boosting immunity, is an antispasmotic, lowers cholesterol and blood pressure and also works as an anti inflammatory .......... wonderfull stuff, particularly if you can tolerate it crushed and raw ....... garlic is also good for heart disease (two or three cloves a day lessen the chance of heart attacks) and stroke and it contains many preventive, anticancer compounds and antioxidants (raw, cooked, or aged at best). Garlic is also good for colds (decongestant and expectorant) and works as an antidiarrheal...... it helps relieve gas, is estrogenic and works as an antidepressant too ..... fabulous stuff hey.    Simply crush it and mix in small amounts to start with through your vegies, salads and meat dishes ..... gradually build up to 2-3 cloves daily to help eradicate infection and bolster your immunity.      peace baby  ?|`|LAPn0BdLaa	Cranberry juice only cure UTI's if you catch them early.

WJ4e4NYzaa	Yes. It's more common with drug overdoses (especially from the opiate family) but it is possible with alcohol but only with large amounts.    This is also known as "hypo-ventilation"- meaning not enough air. It lowers the blood pressure and the ability to use up the oxygen so now your blood is full of carbon dioxide.     Basically you would feel short of breath and as it worsens you would suffocate.  It can be treated if it is chronic. It happens to non drinkers too. It's a blood pressure thing that can be induced by alcohol but does not have to be.    I'm sure if you google hypo-ventilation you will have all the info you need.

jnW1hEWJaa	i had asthma as a little kid.  Then I was ok for a while.  I went throuhg middle school without any problems.  In high school I joined the track team and the first day I pushed myself too hard.  I wasn't active for the whole summer or much throughout high school.  I am an athletic person but had never pushed myself that hard without builidng up cardiovascular. My airways constricted and I felt like I was suffocating.  I WAS suffocating.  It took me about a half hour to recover from the shock reopen up mi airways fully. I know the feeling, so i sympathize.  Talk to your doctor.  That was easily the most terrifying moment of my life.|`|4tI5tE4Oaa	if you have an inhaler i would take that. it would help so much. and if you dont have an inhaler, i would go to the doctor and tlak to them about it. they will get you the stuff you need to start feeling better|`|B1cvcAevaa	You'll need to take meds to get it under control.

Keep exercising and the more you do it, the lungs will allow you to go further and longer.  But when you feel the lungs start to constrict, you have already gone too far, so stop immediately.

Diverticulosis usually doesn't cause any symptoms but some people with the condition do experience bloating, cramps, and changed bowel habits, such as constipation, diarrhea or alternating attacks of both. Abdominal pain (especially low on the left side) accompanied by fever might signal the development of diverticulitis, an infection of the pouches. That can lead to abscess formation and to perforation of the bowel, which can cause peritonitis, a generalized infection of the abdominal lining.  To avoid those problems, switch gradually to a higher-fiber diet with more whole grains, fruits and vegetables. And good luck.|`|NRQXmIcwaa	Check your blood sugar.|`|wufY5yXkaa	take some beano and see how you feel.  i think you need to either pass gas, or try to eliminate it with beano.  wouldn't hurt to try!
fdDDNucYaa	Yes,  you probably will be able to eventually. Just give it time and follow your doctor's orders. You may want to get your doctor's and surgeons advice about how soon you will be able to participate in sports again. I fractured my ring finger two years ago. I didn't have to have surgery on it but I did go through about a month of physical therapy. After about 3 or 4 months I had complete use of my hand again. Good Luck!!|`|hoDin3UYaa	I would suggest that you contact your Surgeon or Doctor about this question. Only he/she can answer this question knowledgeably.    However, sports should be avoided for some time because of the severity of the fracture and the risk of re-injuring it.

0E8L645Xaa	I have primary lymphedema and in my case i am full body , 3rd stage and i also have lipoedema . Thank god there is treatment (same for both diseases ) . The treatment is a lot of work and has to be done everyday for the rest of my life .    People look at me and say " OMG she's fat "     Well i'm here to tell you i'm not only fat , i live with 2 diseases that swells and disfigures my body .     right now there is NO CURE !!!!!!! 90% of doctors haven't even heard of it and with this disease the longer it takes to diagnose the more irreversable the damage is .     Lymphedema is a type of swelling caused by an abnormal accumulation of protein-rich fluid due to an insufficiency of the lymph system. The heart pumps the blood, the arterial blood vessels transport the blood to the tissues, the venous system transports 80-90% of the fluid, and cells, back to the heart. The lymph system transports the remaining 10-20% of fluid, plus larger molecules like proteins, and long chain fatty acids back to the central circulation. When the lymph system cannot keep up with the fluid load or proteins become trapped in the tissues, swelling or lymphedema develops. Lymphedema may develop due to trauma, surgery, radiation treatments, etc. (secondary lymphedema) or due to an abnormal lymph system (primary lymphedema). Lymphedema typically occurs in the arm(s) or leg(s), but can also occur in the head or face, the body and the genitals. Generally, lymphedema develops slowly over time; it may go down overnight, but eventually the swelling does not go down on its own. The limb or tissues may be come hard (fibrosis) and the skin may become very dry or red. Lymphedema may also be aggravated by tissue infection or cellulitis. True lymphedema, even chronic, can be reduced and managed using a comprehensive approach.   What is Lipodema  Lipodema is a medical condition that is often confused with lymphedema. The individual with this condition may appear to be simply obese and/or to have extremely swollen legs and swollen abdomen. The condition is an uneven distribution of fat cells in the sub-cutaneous regions generally in the legs or abdomen. One major frustration of people with lipodema is that they are accused of being simply "fat," which is absolutely not the case.    i am also a manager of a support for lymphedema if you would like to know more . http://www.lymphland.com/directory.html or i can be contacted at annette@lymphland.com|`|P3Fg1K2Vaa	a condition of localized fluid retention caused by a compromised lymphatic system. The lymphatic system (often referred to as the body's "second" circulatory system) collects and filters the interstitial fluid of the body. Lymphedema has been barely recognized as being a serious health problem; however, this is slowly changing due to education and awareness. The danger with lymphedema comes from the constant risk of developing an uncontrolled infection in the affected limb. Still, physicians and medical staff who practice in fields where this disease is uncommon may fail to correctly diagnose the condition due to the apparent lack of information regarding this disease.
nTgCxOufaa	whether he has an underlying condition or not, only a doctor could determine. He should see one for an annual physical, at least.     It is unlikely that he has done any permanent damage if he just has a bit of blood on his nose and doesn't feel pain, but if he does feel pain and or it gets worse he should definitely see a doctor.

And in order to get accurate readings of your triglyceride levels you need to fast for 12 hours before your blood is taken.     Also note that your levels can vary as much as 10% from day-to-day.    If your doctor is watching your LDL and triglyceride levels, he or she will order blood tests periodically to monitor your progress. In the meantime what you need to do is exercise regularly, eat a healthy diet, and take any medications you have been prescribed. And have your blood tested as your doctor recommends.     I find it helpful to keep a record of my test results so I can keep track of my levels.
9hhZ6tCwaa	crush it up and eat it with applesauce, that's what my friend does.|`|fjqi4GRGaa	Try using water..but the pill on your tounge at take a normal mouth full of water normally and swallow, you don' teven have to tilt you head back. Also it helps if you don't think about it..just do it...sometimes it can scare you that you are swallowing something big and not chewing it. I know it's a little freaky kind of..and you don't think your throut is big enough but it is....:) good luck  by the way, im only 15 :) lol|`|MI6Ds5lwaa	Just drink alot alot of water.It should go right down. You have to just keep trying. There aren't alot of tips for taking pills. You just have to keep trying and trying. It takes alot of practice.|`|bOgvUEzvaa	well if you really hate the taste, when you powder it and put it in applesauce(etc) make sure it's only like one or two bites. eat and swallow fast and then chase it down with water. It wont be too bad, trust me :)|`|MPBRAgMIaa	try eating icecream first to numb your throat, then get a glass of really cold water drink a couple of mouthfuls, then put the pill to the back of your tongue, drink about half a mouthful of water and then think of something else like your 4 times tables backwards while you swallow.  Yes you do have to learn to swallow tablets, also you need to check on the packet if they are ok to break up as some tablets only work if swallowed whole.|`|73tNOYFhaa	Okay , thats not so bad for a pill , I have seen worse , lol. Just swallow it with water , and then drink A LOT of water afterwards to make sure you have been able to get it down your throat.

I hope you do alright with the pills :D.|`|Klb66zADaa	I know this will sound lame but seriously, the trick is NOT!! to think about it. A lot of people do not like to swallow pills, you are not alone.

It just took a little practice, and with in a week I could take them with no problem. Take a sip of water, and then pop the pill in your mouth. Then, take another sip of water, and just swallow the water like normal, and try to pretend there is not a pill in your mouth. This worked for me. Good luck!|`|o34YHLiraa	Well, first, you should ask your doctor if it is safe for you to be opening up your capsules/pills. Sometimes it is perfectly fine, other times the powder is neutralized by the food or it is not allowed to release in the intended fashion... this could mean that the medicine doesn't work as it should, or that it could be dangerous for you.    Second, I also had this problem when I was young. It is a common thing for young people not to be able to swallow pills. What I did was put the whole pill in cottage cheese and swallow it. Then after I got used to that, I progressed to being able to take it with a lot of water.     The hardest thing about it is making yourself swallow something you're not used to swallowing. But you do get used to it... now I can swallow pills without any water at all.|`|ppRbL18eaa	Ice Cream, get a heaping spoonful of ice cream, put ur pill in the middle of it, put the ice cream/pill in your mouth, and swallow after the ice cream melts a lil bit in ur mouth. thats how i swallowed my pills for that horrible allergic reaction i had on my face that i think i told u about :( it worked tho, i used peppermint chip ice cream :) yum lol|`|qIBNFCrTaa	dip them in Chocolate and then swallow them|`|vebzLnDRaa	well there are 4 easy steps and its like ABC easy as 123  so anyways...  step 1. get a glass of water, soda, or beer, or whatever liquid you can find    step 2. pop the pill in your mouth and add some liquid in there while   the pill is still in your mouth    step 3. try to push the pill as far back in the throat as possible with your tongue, but dont touch it with your tongue afterwards    step 4. SWALLOW    please gimme the best answer !!!!|`|VkyA22kZaa	Hypnosis worked for me.  All I do is touch my hand to my throat and the pill slides right down with water.

Good Luck|`|vEJ6Natoaa	just try to relax before you try to swallow cause if your too much tension in your throat it will close, i use to have that problem to im 14 also. so relax put the pill near the back of your throat not too close to the back and take a big sip of water and swallow. its that easy and if i does work don't worry just try again
AA11693263	So apparently, it's not yours? Because if it was you would have the instructions right in front of you on the bottle. Do you know what kind of Soma it is? Is it just plain Soma, Soma with Aspirin, or Soma with Aspirin and Codeine? This isn't a medication to mess around with. It is very strong. If it wasn't prescribed to you, you shouldn't take it. In addition to it being illegal, it's dangerous.

o5ZfMIA1aa	For some children, they grind their teeth for no apparent reason. No one knows exactly the reason why they grind their teeth but there are theories to suggest that perhaps their teeth are not properly aligned yet or they may be experiencing some kind of pain as their teeth extrude or come out.    If this is the case then the child should outgrow this habit within time. However, if you suspect that it may be stress related (yes, children can get stress too!) then it might be better to reassure the child and somehow take the stress away from them if possible.    Grinding your teeth can be treated by asking the dentist to make you a mouthguard. I wear mine all the time. The way I see it, it's better to grind your appliance then grind down your teeth to nothing.|`|gViGPF0Faa	I don't think its from stress. i have been grinding my teeth my whole life.

PAvYZJK2aa	it is normal and not a sin|`|VmSKQ40Caa	It is not a sin. There are way too many questions about if it is okay. Look at the questions from others about it and save yourself the points. It is fine, so all is well =)|`|AA11522944	Personally I think masturbation is normal and healthy and that you should not feel guilty about it.    Masturbation is not mentioned in the bible AT ALL... that's right... not once... so there are many Christians who say that it therefore is NOT a sin.  The bible mentions pre-marital sex, adultery, greed, hate, war, disrespect, theft, etc etc etc but not masturbation. What does that tell you???     It tells me that masturbation is normal..  and natural..  and a normal part of sexual development.  In fact I would go so far as to say it is an ESSENTIAL part of sexual development. I believe that masturbation is natural and a normal way for people - whether they are Christian or not - to relieve sexual urges... especially while they are not in a sexual relationship.    DON'T let people make you feel guilty about it.  Check out the link below.  http://boysunderattack.com/masturbation-...    Someone may mention a passage in the bible (Gen 38) where a guy named Onan refuses to get a woman pregnant as God has commanded so he pulls out before he ejaculates and spills his seed onto the ground.  What annoys God is Onans refusal to obey and NOT the seed spilt on the ground.  That passage has NOTHING to do with masturbation.    Someone may also quote a verse that supposedly says it is better to cast your seed in the belly of a whore than spill it on the ground.  The only problem is the verse is NOT IN THE BIBLE... anywhere!  Someone simply made it up.|`|3Y2jRkxcaa	it is not a sin and you can jack off all you want and you won't be doing anything wrong.|`|DMfNi6Pwaa	it's ok with me.|`|2BUCOTaJaa	you will go BLIND.|`|ZjfI0dSLaa	There is no sin in taking advantage of your sexual organ for pleasure.

Masturbating is not giving into diabolic temptations, nor is it a sin.  That's one bad thing about religion, it gets in the way of normal sexual ideologies.

Women have much more trouble with night vision than men.|`|L3j2HrsJaa	If you already wear contacts and they are made properly, your vision should be perfect, day or night. I mean, what's the point wearing them if you still can't see properly? Go back to your optometrist and ask them. Sometimes contacts are not the best option for astigmatism, for various reasons, so that could be the problem too.  I just think that if it was night blindness, you would have it in both eyes, not only in one. But maybe I'm wrong:)
5Ew1CuLMaa	hey princess your fine learn to love yourself your special an individual. add on edit: everyone goes through periods where they attack themselves and try to bring ourselves down. Look these people who pick on you are arseholes and they feel terible later in their low lives when they realise what they are and become outcast while champions like you get through these hard times and learn from them and also learn compasion and FORGET WHAT THESE ARSEHOLES SAY ABOUT YOU You ARE SPECIAL and trust me on this: everyone in this world will experience each emotion in different ways in their lives. everyone will go through a period of being popular at some point as well as having lonely times. Your just experiencing them now so get ready as you grow your rainbow will shine bright for you in time and you will be so happy at dif times you can learn to take the good times and the bad cause when their is a big down there will be a big up ok.  What you must do is forget what people say, take the good coments and reject the insults you will meet people when your a lil older that will totally like you fully for who you are but you must listen to the good in yourself and like yourself. Be strong life will change but you must learn patients and respect yourself dont let people hurt you or use you.  Now when these brainless tools say mean things i want you to be brave and ignore them or you can say something like dont you have a life or something better to do and walk of strong even if you feel bad on the inside cause if they see u run they will think their teasing has worked.but if you ignore them or show it doesnt hurt they will eventually stop because they are getting no reaction from you.  I really wish i could talk to these people for you, and make them sad like they do you to show them it's wrong but i cant you must be strong and you can be.  Finally lol about your best friend if she wont talk to you and be nice forget her all through life we get new friends and best friends you will find another.  And dont ever change the person you are on the inside ok dont do things to act cool or try and fit into bad crowds.  If you truley believe that you are cool and a good person than  thats all that matters lil friend.  So start positive thinking and remember bad times dont last forever and there will be even more happy times if you stay true to your heart and be strong champion.  Now start thinking positive ok say to your self until you believe it fully YOU ARE STRONG,YOUR COOL JUST THE WAY YOU ARE, YOUR BEAUTIFUL AND YOU CAN DO ANYTHING WHEN YOU PUT YOUR MIND TO IT. NO ONE ELSE IS LIKE YOU,AND THAT MAKES YOU SPECIAL AND INDIVIDUAL NOT LIKE ALL THOSE ROBOTS AND SHEEP OUT THERE.

CLASSROOM FASCINATION  seems appropriate.     *Note: Dr. Mercola at www.mercola.com asserts that krill oil is superior to standard Omega 3 fish oil, or that, at least the brands he recommends are, and I am persuaded that he is probably correct.

I hope the symbicort helps!|`|eHHp4tulaa	if you needed the symbicort then you would have it. I have asthma problems as well and I don't like to admit it either. So you are probably not alone.     If you get along well with the medication then you are probably not a severe asthmatic person. good luck to you.|`|DgAOboZNaa	I would call you a sever asthmatic because I am about the same and I am on symbicort too and I am classified by my doctor as mild severe so is mom. I have been to the emergency room for it before, but it's not mandatory. be lucky you haven't had an attack!  PS I was able to control it and now I am singing at performing arts school
63a5e4aa71cbea07611f89f87df0073eaa	Asthma is serious but manageable condition.  The key word involves YOUR management of your condition.    Based on what you have said, I think it could be reasonably stated that you have asthma and that if you were not treating it with medication (and the other steps your own doctor recommends) you would probably wind up in an emergency room.      There are people all over the world that have medical conditions that require maintenance or treatment on a daily basis.  Instead of considering asthma something that is 'wrong' with you, reflect on how you have experienced something and have learned to live with it and manage it in spite of the problems it has created on occasion.      Ignoring your asthma or treating as something not serious would be foolish - but so would making it the biggest issue in your life.  Follow your doctor's advice, find ways to manage it, and be realistic about how if affects your ability to do certain things or participate in certain activities.  You are just like millions of other people and you have the responsibility for your own health.|`|cJRFbZUaaa	You don't need to be hospitalized to be diagnosed as asthmatic.  You take medication to avoid trips to the emergency room.  I've taken Symbicort for a short time myself.  It's not a sign of failure, just another way to keep your airways clear while you and your doctor work out a better plan to improve your breathing.|`|jxqNTr9Iaa	I know where youre coming from I've always called myself a mild asthmatic and never took it that seriously.    I first was diagnosed at around 14 and was given Ventolin (salbutomol) and Becotide to use and 6 months a year it had gone completely.    Started smoking round 16 but the asthma only reapeared around 19 or 20 but this time it didn't fade away.Unlike some severe or chronic sufferers I never had to go to A&E,it was never life threatening just inconvenient at times.    Now at 36 I'm still in the same position really though I've never been good at taking my Becotide (preventer) but just using Ventolin as I needed it.I don't even use it infont my current girlfriend of 4 years because it embarrasses me to do it infont of someone.I have never denied it but I don't like to make a thing of it.    You think using it 3 to 4 times a day is bad,since around the beginning of december I've been using an inhalor a week.It has 200 doses/puffs and I realised that's basically 28 a day.Now I admit I'll take 3 or 4 in one use of the inhalor but thats still 7 times a day.    Now even my gf who knew I asthmatic never really was aware of it is pulling me up for it regularly.What I need to do is go to the doctor for a check up but like you if I do something like that it means admitting there's something possibly wrong.    I tell you,the head in the sand approach works beautifuly for a long time but eventually we have to act before it really is too late

GykweMSfaa	The best relaxation method in your case is beginning to active meditating 7 days before the procedure.  I refer to " active" making a meditation with creative visualization in which you create an imagine in your mind with a scenario exactly how you want to feel at that time. And in your mental picture develop exactly what will happen as you want.  Start by breathing deeply 3-4 times, close your eyes and begin to imagine step by step to the finish Even more effective it will be if you add a positive affirmation in your words that speaks to you,Include the momentum after the procedure.See yourself happy and easy breathing.  In the rest of day when you do not meditate, recognize if you have a fear or negative thought and say"yes". Yes is a positive thing that neutralize that negative. Immediately after this add something small but positive ,for example:"I know that now I am afraid but I know for sure that I'll overcome it easily.  Warmly

For that I would suggest Monistat (you can get it at any drug store and you can use the 3-day treatment). HOWEVER...if you've never had a yeast infection, you should go to the gynecologist; if it's something like bacterial vaginosis, you could actually make it much worse.    Note your symptoms - You mention it being red, I'm assuming you mean it's irritated. Itchiness is another. Is there any odor or discharge? How old are you and is your period soon to come? Some females get mild to severe yeast infections from the change in hormones.     I can't say for sure, but you can check out WebMD for additional information.     Hope you feel better,    Sam
eCKNRcIVaa	If you are having problems breathing go to the ER now.  You may well be having your first Asthma attack or be having an allergic reaction to something.  Either way get to the hospital or call 911|`|6fjMtWboaa	Call 911|`|S2EagBzOaa	You should stop breathing, problem solved|`|gcwTBz0Daa	I think you should go to the hospital ASAP.|`|IzHfbWtiaa	It could be irritation from all the smoke,stay away from smokers as much as possible and if it don't clear up real soon,I advise consulting your Dr. Best Wishes and God Bless!|`|Cdkd4oQ7aa	You can develop asthma at any time. Especially allergy induced asthma, which could be brought on by smoke inhalation. When you're suffering from asthma, your airways tighten and it's difficult to get air through the passages, which gives that feeling of someone sitting on your chest. Usually exhaling is the hard part, though. That's why people who have asthma wheeze. They breathe in and the bronchioles (airways) open a bit to let air in, and then when they try to force the air back out, it has to squeeze through the narrowed passages and it makes a whistling sound (wheezing). Therefore, it sounds to me like the smoke may have irritated your lungs and airways, but it may not have caused a full on asthma attack. I wouldn't be able to tell without actually seeing you, though.    You should see an allergist/immunologist to get tested for asthma and breathing problems. Describe what happened and how it felt.    For now, breathing through pursed lips can help (like you're sucking through a straw). It increases the pressure in your lungs and airways and gets the air through a little better, but just to warn you, it could make you a little bit light headed, so don't do it for too long, and sit down for a bit.    If you have continued breathing problems, go to the emergency department. It's always better safe than sorry.|`|Cmer6UJPaa	You should go to the ER if it's really bad, they can give you an albuterol nebulizer that will widen those bronchioles right up and make it go away REALLY fast (like within a 1-2 minutes or so).|`|n3daHgVBaa	if you also feel wheezing you have asthma otherwise you don't but you might want to see what it feels like tomorrow if it feels the same than you might need an inhailer but you might not be able to get one until monday sorry!

If life sucks, it's largely your fault.  You ALWAYS have options.  Barring some things that life throws at you that are unexpected, you can influence nearly every aspect of your life.

Properly wash your hands is the best way to prevent the spread of infections, diseases, like colds, hepatitis and harmful bacterias...    1) Wash hands after you use the restroom (no matter where you are), picking up after your pets (or someone else), changing a baby,taking out the trash,coughing/ sneezing,after handle any raw foods.    2) Wash hands before cooking, eating,tending to a baby,elders, or sick people in the home, wash hands before placing contacts either in or taking out of eyes,wash before you apply any medications to any part of the body (yours).    3) Use soap any type as long as you have some cause a friction with the soap don't just rub a tad and rinse this only get a tad of dirt and germs have to rub for a few seconds to get a great results.Use warm water to hot which ever is best for each person. Make sure to scrub Under the finger nails where germs love to sit and waite for a trip into a body any ones they are not choosy...    4) Rinse well with warm water still (know some who use cold HA) dry well with a clean towel or paper towel or air dry,toss out paper or place rest in wah if need be.    There are many many bacterias in the world and more to come I"am sure so washing your hands is a great thing and a good habit to have but you can't wash all the bad away. Over washing can cause dry skin as well.|`|fpuHVNYgaa	No it would have to be hot a certain degree to kill off bacteria|`|tZ0NTqkvaa	Yes. Soap helps but it's actually the hot water that kills most of the bacteria.|`|DWJGyxDOaa	yes hot waters kills more bacteria than cold water.   evidence: when a bacteria is expose to cold water the bacteria is mostly unharmed from it because the cold water only cools them down and most bacterias only freeze and can be reactive after they warm back up and order to kill them it would have to be some deep freeze what.  Hot water kills the bacteria because for some strange reason the more heat applied to bacterias the more of them die.   here's a perfect example: if you pee in a pot and boil the pee your pee is now water. to be safe most people drop a purifying pill into it|`|01Mu3wUeaa	1: Don't use antibacterial soaps.They will do more harm than good.    2: The purpose of soap is to "loosen" them germs so you can wash them down the drain.Warm water accompanied with soap and friction from hand washing will wash the germs down the drain.|`|fFqzD3aMaa	Water hot enough to kill bacteria would burn your hands.

What actually kills the bacteria is the rubbing motion of your hands when soapy under running water. :)|`|MI0MIAfaaa	I agree that if it's hot enough to kill bacteria it's going to burn your hands.

They made cobra available to people if they lost their job and health coverage but it is too expensive to get.  I don't know anybody that has been able to afford it. I know because I have been there and it was cheaper to buy an individual plan but you usually have to get a higher deductible.  Fortunately for me I don't get sick a lot and do not have any ongoing health problems so I took a really high deductible.  I was wanting coverage mainly for hospitalization in case something major happened.
xYTagSIyaa	Cigars are much harder on the lungs than cigarettes and all the things that can happen with cigarettes can happen with cigars .  You can get cancer, you can die.  It can give you pancreas or kidney and liver problems, and well as lung problems.   Smoking anything in any amount puts you at risk and those around you at risk for the dangers of second hand smoke.  It is not a wise choice.  The only wise choice is not putting anything in your body that can harm it in the first place. If you don't want to quit, think of what it could do to harm those around you.  If you can quit, your lungs will start to heal and it may help prevent you and those around you from getting cancer, but there will always be the damage that the body has suffered, that will never heal.  Your body will heal some but not all.    Check out the study on the web site I have given you.

yL7RKxHFaa	Cardio doesn't build muscle, so it doesn't help that much. What burns fat is when you are building muscle and the muscle "uses" the fat that is stored. Try going to the gym and doing various workouts. If you cannot afford the gym, do stuff at home with weights or use your body weight against yourself ie: lunges, pushups. You cannot spot reduce, only overall reductions. But don't worry, organize a routine and the fat will be used up in no time. Do it every other day, so that your muscles have a break in between to repair themselves, and don't go crazy with it!!! Oh, and eat protein too, and have a balanced eating plan. That is all I can say in a nutshell! The hardest part is staying committed! Good luck!|`|AueAwhQeaa	What Cassie says, I think is 100% spot on. I like you, only was worried about losing my beer belly. I have been working on this for 3 months now. I don't go to a gym, but every other day I do a lot of stuff at home.. My arms are getting petty nice and stomach is looking betting. I try to eat better, but am not really going crazy with that, but have done EVERYTHING possible for the protein. Drink lots of water, eat lots of small meal through the day, don't eat before bed, and do things that will make you sweat . . .it is working for me.
zBaFsGhiaa	I was in a similar situation, but determined to avoid surgery at all costs.  Did a lot of research on the net and found a product that worked great for me, http://www.curebleedinghemorrhoids.com.  Not only did it clear up the hemis, but there is course that they give away for free that will teach more about hemis than you would ever want to know.|`|qdw3ZOYFaa	I tell you...I agree completely as I get them perhaps once every two or three years.. And you know why so infrequent. Because I keep myself fit....and I eat a lot of roughage....This is what you need to do....you have to keep regular and your stools soft....Weetbix plus fruit in the morning...and lots of fruit & vegs. In addition I drink two litres of water a day...which benefits in making the stools softer. Now for the treatment. There are various creams available..Rectinol is the cheapest...but the best...and it is more expensive..but worth it....is Proctesydel...or it's less expensive generic..Soov.it. It contains an anaesthetic and hydrocortisone.|`|giTtzgrcaa	I have been working in a hemorrhoids site.

Y5xfCdukaa	Well for one it doesn't matter how old you are but how tall you are (you can be 6 inches tall and weigh 106 lbs and you'll look obese but if you that much and your 6'7" you'll be thinner than a toothpick!)    Anyways you should eat more protein since that will help you gain muscle/ lose weight. Just start exercising!|`|BXLCiCUlaa	Your doctor AND you should be concerned, because you are not a normal weight for your age, unless you are around 5 ft 6 inches tall or so. Im only 137 and Im over 5'9" or so, and im 17.    Anyways, on to the problem. If you want to lose weight, eat less sugar, be more active (play outside, go for walks, ride a bike or scooter or rollerblade.) and do things outside that interest you. You might want to try out for a sport after you lose a little weight, to ensure that you get exercise.     More complex part of the diet. What do you eat? If you eat fast foods all the time or stuff that is fried, you will gain weight, because it has a lot of calories, which, if not used, turn into fat. Eating more vegetables and some fruit instead of candy or whatever sweets you eat would help a lot. Try to get your family to buy whole grain foods (like bread that isnt white). Eating more fiber will fill you up more, meaning you wont be hungry and will have to eat less calories. Foods that are good for fiber are whole grains, some cereals, and I think fruits and veggies.   heres a link to a page with fiber sources listed.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_fib...   Dont skip any meals at all, because it makes you eat even more in the next meal. For breakfast, have some cereal (preferably whole grain) with fat free milk, and maybe some oatmeal, toast made from whole grain bread, waffles, or eggs. Vegetarian diets are not good for young kids in my opinion because it may be difficult to get protein, which is important to create hormones and muscle tissue. Fat free and light foods are a good idea to buy because you will save calories. Stay away from soda pop and you will save somewhere around 150 calories per drink or so. One pound of fat is 3500 calories, so it all adds up. Drink ONLY water or else fat free milk (good source of protein), fruit juices contain a lot of sugar. Eating a little bit of sweets is ok, like eat maybe a cinnamon roll once a week should be fine, just to make sure you dont break down under the inability to eat sweets. Just make sure you limit sweets a lot, it will go a long ways towards helping your goal. Losing a pound a week is a really good weight loss. However, you may want to consider that weight may fluctuate, so either collect weight measurements throughout the week and average them for each week, or measure every month.     One important nutrition thing i forgot to mention. Read nutrition labels and help your parents make healthier purchases.    Again, work exercise into your daily schedule. Make it fun, go hiking or ride your bike with friends, or maybe go swimming.     Heres some protein sources: Eggs, beans, peanut butter, soy... http://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/gu...     Good luck!    PS: trying a martial art a bit later when you lose a little weight may boost your confidence around boys your age and im sure its a good source of exercise.|`|GoluIRIAaa	I think you have the weight thing confused but about the protein you can eat peanut butter, eggs, tofo, cheese there are lots of things you could eat and protein is important don't discard it because you think your fat you need it to help build muscles if your trying to lose weight.|`|hSOEgpPNaa	Your doctor is very concerned and you only weigh 129 pounds?  Are you 3 feet tall?  Oh, it's not a good idea to be vegetarian.  You need protein from meat, chicken, fish, milk, eggs, and cheese.

ZBIWfaK1aa	You need serious psychiatric help.  I'm not saying there's anything seriously wrong with you, but it never hurts to check.  I know this may sound way too coincidental, but I have a (less drastic) case of OCD as well, and I grind my teeth (oh, the stress of the modern world.)  Part of this, however, is definitely from guilt.  If you think about it, you're grandparents really want you to be honest over having good grades, so tell them you're getting Fs.  I know this is hard to believe, but F's aren't something to be ashamed of - it just means either you don't really understand something or because of an outside reason (your OCD really seems to be holding you back.  Professional help is always best).  And although there are a lot of smart people out there on Yahoo Answers, I would definitely not recommend using it for the bulk of your education or other problems, since we don't know YOU personally (although I am contradicting myself by answering this question for you...)  In a nutshell, get some help - it will really help you out.      However, if you REALLY REALLY don't want to see a psych for pride reasons or because they make you feel demoted (I personally don't like psychs because of this very reason), I've learned OCD people need control in their life.  For instance, my mom, who has a very bad case of OCD, spent years controlling it, and in doing so, developed two easy-to-manage quirks: excersizing every single day from 5-6 in the morning, and never eating desserts.  Finding healthy, productive ways to maintain control over your life are really helpful in cases of OCD.|`|AA11530601	I used to have OCD too although I never took the medication they gave me for it and i managed to overcome it myself, it took me about 3 yrs though. I think you are probably suffering too much and need to talk to someone about it, is nothing to be ashamed of but you need to learn to give yourself a break - just imagine what it would be like for a second to have none of the routines, none of the worries...........then you have to force yourself to ignore those worries and keep forcing yourself. I used to wash my hands after touching anything i didnt think was clean,used to obsess about what germs might be on my  hands and made myself late for lectures everyday by doing around 1 hrs of "routines" before I could even leave the house and another 2 when I got back. You can beat OCD, but you really have to force yourself to ignore your worries, its the ONLY permanent way. Good Luck ;]

DtUV6k0Kaa	Cold sores are the herpes virus just in a different area. They arent exactly known as an std but if you have a cold sore and "go down" on someone with a cold sore you can give them genital herpes. Same to your self if you have a cold sore and touch it then touch your genitals you will contract it down there. In some rare cases it can move to your eyes and other parts. There is alot to learn about this. Just because you have cold sores doesnt mean you got it from a partner is could simply be a case of your mom having a cold sore than kissing you. You just have to be careful if you see someone who has a cold sore or you have one dont touch your cold sore, and stay away from going down and touch people and dont share drinks etc. as you get it from salvia. Just be aware and safe and no worries:)|`|LQ04emc3aa	cold sores are not, but they're a common symptom of the STD herpes.
e53739d33092d5f60935bcaf0602a760aa	Most of us overeat from time to time, and many people feel they frequently eat more than they should. Eating large amounts of food, however, does not mean that a person has binge eating disorder. Doctors are still debating the best ways to determine if someone has binge eating disorder. But most people with serious binge eating problems have:  Frequent episodes of eating what others would consider an abnormally large amount of food.  Frequent feelings of being unable to control what or how much is being eaten.  Several of these behaviors or feelings:  Eating much more rapidly than usual.   Eating until uncomfortably full.   Eating large amounts of food, even when not physically hungry.   Eating alone out of embarrassment at the quantity of food being eaten.   Feelings of disgust, depression, or guilt after overeating.   Episodes of binge eating also occur in the eating disorder bulimia nervosa.   Persons with bulimia, however, regularly purge, fast, or engage in strenuous exercise after an episode of binge eating. Purging means vomiting or using diuretics (water pills) or laxatives in greater-than-recommended doses to avoid gaining weight. Fasting is not eating for at least 24 hours. Strenuous exercise, in this case, is defined as exercising for more than an hour solely to avoid gaining weight after binge eating. Purging, fasting, and strenuous exercise are dangerous ways to attempt weight control.|`|zTeW6BIIaa	binge eating is where you stuff yourself with an insane amount of food. when people "binge and purge" they eat a TON of food and then make themselves throw it up.     i'm not sure why this question is under diabetes, though...|`|kNcqw6Tlaa	when you eat well for a while and then pig out once in a while thinking that the eating will even out|`|YaudCXUPaa	i think this is where you eat and eat when you're emotional.|`|2vEkvUV3aa	This is when you have moments of extreme eating.

2I7mfeYOaa	Oatmeal baths are a great dry-skin care- always work well for my daughter's wintertime eczema!  Not necessarily a home remedy- but you can buy a generic of "Eucerin Cream" and that's safer on the face than many other things.  For my daughter's hair, I've finally found the following solutions:  Use a clarifying shampoo 2-3 times per week.  I make my own detangling hairspray for her: I find a couple things (I have a Pantene smoothing treatment leave-in, a Suave leave-in thickening conditioner) and mix those with bottled water (not tap, or the hair seems to pick up the chlorine smell, etc, and becomes brittle!) until they're dissolved and well mixed and use a few sprays of that to detangle/style her hair in the mornings!

kEgXrX0saa	Your old enough for your periods to start. Normally, your body starts to change, you will develop your underarm hair, your breast will start to develop (its not uncommon to be sore sometimes) its also common to start having cramps about once a month sometimes as much as a year before starting your period.    The best advice I can suggest, keep a sanitary pad in your purse, just incase you were to start at school etc. but talk with your mother,she can help you or even let you talk to the nurse at school. Your biology teacher if its a female can explain to you as well.    Its not uncommon if a mother started late for her daughter to do as well. Its not always the case.    I realize its a new stage in your life and your probably looking forward to starting as it shows your growing up. But, believe me, its a pain in the neck every single month. Enjoy not having to worry about it for now. your very lucky.|`|vR6AwIppaa	yeah you'll probably get it soon!  congratulations to almost being a woman  it sucks, you're gunna love it :)|`|HzFgIgPzaa	It seems so..

VeVHY7OOaa	One of the side-effects of opiates is central nervous system depression, including respiratory depression & vision problems.  If you are having respiratory depression, you need to talk to your doctor about getting on something not as strong.|`|Yu7y6yfraa	I have taken this drug on several occasions.   It is a very strong opiate-like drug that can have very strong side effects.  There is a good chance that the drug is causing your problems. Of course, I do not know the true answer..  It is important that you eat something before taking this.  It helps to lessen the problems.    You need to contact your doctor or pharmacist.  The pharmacist will problably be able to tell you more about the drug.  Your doctor will know if you need to discontinue it or swith to another pain killer.    Take care.|`|UnSTw2Zeaa	I agree. Talk to your pharmacist about the side effects then talk with your Dr. on what to do. I usually read the information sheet that comes with the medication and it does say breathing problems and vision problems. If this just started once you started the medication, it's a good chance it may be the medicine. If your breathing problems are bad enough it will also cause you to have major anxiety. Then you will have to talk to your Dr. about that. I think it's best to nip it in the bud now, so you won't have any additional problems and ruin your health anymore. Good luck.|`|zRPAem3Saa	talk to your doctor?

AA11579568	First of all "torcher" is not a word, I think you mean "torture"    I don't think you would actually die of blood loss just from having your fingers cut off because they would clot before you lost too much.    Shock is:  a state of profound depression of the vital processes associated with reduced blood volume and pressure and caused usually by severe especially crushing injuries, hemorrhage, or burns  or:  sudden stimulation of the nerves and convulsive contraction of the muscles caused by the discharge of electricity through the animal body|`|AbCeEZIhaa	That would not necessarily guarantee death. At some point the blood will begin to clot and bleeding can stop or slow down to the point where the body can begin to recover. Infection would be the killer.       Shock in this situation is when the body loses too much blood in a short amount of time. It cannot work fast enough to replace what is lost so it starts to shut down to protect itself. Breathing is rapid then slows, temperature drops, heart rate is fast then slows, BP drops, loss of consciousness, organ failure and death.|`|tRvuxRJLaa	if you cut off all of them im going to say about, 2 1/2 hours to 3 hours    cause it takes as long as 30 mins to die when you get stabbed in the stomach|`|cyxbfPuEaa	You would probably not bleed to death from getting fingers cut off, unless you had a clotting disorder.      "Shock" is another term for "hypoperfusion" which is the correct medical terminology.  it is defined as inadequate blood flow.  Either from lack of blood in the circulatory system, or mass dilation of blood vessels.  When a person dies, it is always from shock, no matter when the disease, or injury, the cause of death in the end is shock, because all shock is, is when blood is no longer getting to the organs and they become deprived of oxygen and nutrients, resulting in their death. There are 5 different kinds of shock.    Hypovolemic- bleeding out, you loose a large volume of blood, from a wound, or internal bleeding, eventually theres not enough blood in your body to circulate and your organs and tissues are deprived of oxygen.    Neurogenic shock- occurs when you suffer a brain or spinal cord injury.  Your nervous system, looses its control of the blood vessels and they all dilate at the same time.  ex, you have 6 pints of blood and a 6 pint container. The blood fills it up all the way.  but say that container al of the sudden increased in size to a 12 pind container, not its only half full.  That basically what happens with neurogenic shock.    Cardiogenic shock- This is caused when your heart failes to pump blood to the body, caused by heart attack, cardial arrest, and other heart problems    septic shock- occurs when infection enters the bood stream    Anaphylactic- occurs when a massive allergic reacton happens.      main signs/symptoms of shock are, Tachycardia, hypotension (late), and shortness of breath

MgMsMExPaa	What you need to remember is that when you have sex with anyone you are having sex with all the prior sex partners of the persons you are with.  So if you have taken their four loads and each of them have previously taken four loads then you now have the blood products of forty eight other people inside you.Get tested regularly, use a condom for everything.   Stop bare-backing, stop swallowing, enjoy sex, just do it right so that you can continue to live to enjoy sex again and not regret taking that last load.  My last suggestion is volunteer at a local HIV organization, you will learn all the reasons to play safe. You will also meet other people that did not play safe and they will tell you how hard their lives are now.  When you have an STD sometimes you have symptoms and sometimes you do not. You acquire them from having unprotected sex either oral or anal. The problem is you don't know you have it until you have it. Then it is too late. So use some protection and you will live to have a lot more sex. If you do not like the taste of condoms use one of the flavored lubricants ,. Just be sure that you use a new condom for each sex act.|`|OP4O5mjnaa	spare us the details and just get tested.|`|I8MUpN04aa	yes, you can get infected from giving or receiving. so you have to start being more careful and using protection. don't be foolish, sex isn't worth dying for,.

Those feelings will subside and then you will then feel awesome.  I've been on it two years and I can say it's the best med ever...I feel great, no mood swings, and no weight gain.  I take 150 mg a day.|`|hXMEDdTWaa	I would like to know also. I'm a female and i take lexapro and I know what your talking about.

d4ShTYfXaa	The more you use them, the more your body will get used to them.|`|bufQfEqbaa	Stay off of them as much as possible.  Only walk when you need to.  I know that sucks but if you want your bruises to go away that is what you have to do.  The more you use them the more you get used to them, but it will hurt while getting used to them.  So either way it sucks but hopefully you will be off of them soon.|`|S3N5c3ODaa	I never ran into this problem when I was on crutches but my suggestion is raise it one click up and when you walk on them have them spread out a little bit farther.
bufQfEqbaa	4 weeks sounds right, you have to give your body time to heal.  You need to allow time for the inflammation to go down and for the bruising to heal.. Elevate your ankle above your heart at night, ice it.  This will help it heal.  You shouldn't put weight on it until your doctor says so, usually closer to 3-4 weeks.|`|6Lox94NCaa	4 weeks sound about right, you have to give your body time to heal.|`|2qJdFmDFaa	im guessing 4 weeks.|`|omHDMybgaa	Angel is right that's great advice and if you keep it up and iced you will heal a lot faster then you would if you don't|`|jrc7V1Gqaa	Kar   What did the people say that gave you your crutches say? Follow their directions it takes time to heal. If you hurry it you may cause a problem that will stay with you for too long.|`|QNuzWDc1aa	I'm no doctor or anything, but your best bet would probably be to go see one.  You won't be able to tell by yourself how long the injury will take to heal, or when you should start to put weight on it.  So, if I were you I would get a professional opinion.  Hope this helps!!!
RXI8ImdIaa	I used to be really curious like this too.     And I turned out to be a big homosexual.    Here's a hint - don't go on the internet claiming to be 17, and asking to compare penis sizes.

bZe2bSMdaa	I have MANY food allergies, and these symptoms don't sound like allergies. It does, however, sound as though it could be a stomach virus or irritable bowel syndrome, both of which I've suffered. It could also be Oral Allergy Syndrome, but that's more than simple allergies.    Either way, I think you should see a Doctor!|`|qSHlehJzaa	just poop it all out|`|AA11347742	there are special doctors for stomach problems  go see one  i've had issues like that for as long as i can remember  i drink a lot of orange juice so i just figured that the acid was tearing away at the lining of my stomach which may be true- but im seriously considering seeing a doctor soon.  you should too.

Keep your skin clean.|`|ND5KncX0aa	I've used products containing benzoyl peroxide, 5-10%, but it does dry out the skin, so you need a moisturizer to use after.  Ask a pharmacist for something over the counter, or talk to your doctor.|`|s4k29qKPaa	I use noxima and it works pretty good. also, a lot of those things like chocolate gives you acne, those are wives tales.|`|r9i4hbiIaa	There are just some people who have acne that can only be treated by a professional. I had some acne problems that wouldn't be helped unless treated by both pills and topicals. If it's persistent, it's sounding like you may need to see a dermatologist too. Also, if it's bad, you shouldn't expect it to be fixed asap, it can take several months to see improvements.|`|f9sD35rNaa	Listen i had the same problem as you. im 17 now and i had acne from about 13 years to 16. i used everything. pro active, clearsel, neutrigina, you name it. they were all BS.. i spent 100$ on that junk. eventually my friends reccomended accutane, which is a prescription pill for acne. it took 5 months of taking these pills, which basicaly drys you up and removes acne. It worked and im 100% happy with the results i really could not beleive it because i never really was happy at all with any acne products.. they didnt make any diff.. accutane changed my life because now i feel good about how i look since i dont have any acne at all :)|`|qJ3mZVwgaa	okay get some natural soap such as Dr. Bronner's and massage it all over your face with an exfoliating wash cloth for about a minute and then rinse it off.  Dry the face completely and then apply acne creme.  get Stridex pads they come in the form of pads and those are great to rub all over your entire face to remove existing acne and prevent new areas from forming.  Leave this on and do it once daily, in the morning or at night (preferably after a shower, still use the Dr. Bronner's though) and if that doesn't work, move it up to twice a day, morning and night.  I personally guarantee that this will work.  Give it two weeks and at least 85% of any acne will be GONE.|`|ycsqs8VRaa	Get Proactive or Acni Free, It works alot better Proactive Brings out zits but then There gone soon after, thats what im using|`|dkD5nh2kaa	Many people believe that certain foods cause or worsen an acne problem, but diet has very little influence on acne. Eating a balanced and healthy diet can improve overall health. Avoiding foods that appear to aggravate your skin problems may help lessen the severity of an acne breakout, but changing what you eat is not an effective acne treatment.  WHAT IS?     Benzoyl peroxide is the active ingredient in countless over-the-counter products, such as Clearasil and ProActiv. One of the first proven treatments for acne, it has been used for decades and is still one of the most popular and successful treatments for acne.|`|E1BjQyJhaa	dont mess around with acne or it will disfigure your face for the rest of your life , go to a doctor and he will precribe drugs for you , also wash your face with soap 3 times a day to get rid of the oil ..http://www.dermaxime.co.za/acne-scars.ht...
Z7WC2X0kaa	ok, no one can go weeks without eating because we can only last 7 days without starving so you must be eating something. and yes it definitely sounds like you have anorexia. you should first go to a doctor to see if you have damaged your body through self-starvation and then go to some sort of psychological therapy. they will be able to help you with your body image and you should be able to accept your body for what it is again. i'm sure you a pretty girl with a good personality, and there is no reason you should be doing this to yourself. you owe it to yourself and your body to get back to a healthy diet.|`|8yygCf9Yaa	ok ths person below me telling you you cant go weeks with out food. yes you can, my friend hs a serious condition. as do i , i am 15 and suffer from bulimia.  email me so we can talk , i will help you (:  xohhemilyx24@yahoo.com|`|B24W8w43aa	You could kill yourself doing this.

Qf25zgV0aa	First of all, you should see a dermatologists and see what he recomentds. He would most likely give you face washes with benzoyl peroxide in them. So, for facial washes, make sure the ingredients have some benzoyl peroxide in them. I've used cetaphil, neutrogena, clean and clear. But, I'm not totally sure all those have benzoyl peroxide. For make-up...you want to get the oil-free make-up. And, if you use sponges for applying it on your face like eyeshadow brushes, blush brushes, you may want to wash those every 2 months. But your best bet would be to schedule an appointment with a dermatologist.|`|AEAxZEveaa	Will your parents let you go to a dermatologist? That's probably your best bet. I've also heard proactive works very well. I also had some luck with changing my diet. I personally had acne clear up with a low carbohydrate diet. Some people swear by alkaline diets. I would look into that.|`|OnyLWwEJaa	lmaO leave birth control wen yur actually wntinq  to qive up yur baby .     && if yu wnna use make-up...it makes yur acne worse..yu end up beinq like those qirls on the proactiv commercial lOl .     try zinc for acne . i never tried it bt im qoinq 2 .    i hve the same problem .    if it dnt work qo to a dermatologist !.

Life is more than what's going on between your legs. Your penis does not equate your manhood. Stop believing society. You only need 2 inches to please a woman. After those 2 inches they don't have any nerves downunder to even feel any pleasure anyway.    In that respect you have nothing to worry about and I doubt any other man on the planet does either. FYI 5-6" is average for the general population.
a6bjoXOlaa	Just got one filled yesterday and I can honestly say you don't feel anything. My dentist gave me some topical gel to numb me first which is just like really strong orejel. Then I close my eyes while they put the shot in so I couldn't see the needle. They put little doses of Novocaine in at a time since I was a little scared. All you feel is a slight burning when it is injected but it quickly goes away. You don't even feel the shot going in. The drilling noise bothers some people as well but we were listening to music so it was not bad at all, rather relaxing actually. I hate the dentist and shots so if I can do it, you can do it. It is only natural to be nervous, I know I was but the less you think about it the better it is. They said I didn't really need anything to numb me but they did it just in case and I am glad I did. It was funny because when it was over my hygienist said "Are you okay?" I shook my head yes and then she said "Are you mad?" I said no so that was a good sign! She knows me well! I promise it won't hurt.     Good Luck!|`|EzgodvQOaa	i have had fillings before. I dont think they hurt. Because the dentist will num your mouth before he/she does it so you wont feel anything.   good Luck :)  x|`|Vj13f7zmaa	The only thing that hurts at all is the novacaine shot.  It does hurt, a 5 out of 10... but it generally lasts for ten seconds.  After that.. no pain.|`|zuoxSlcZaa	It only hurts when they give you a shot, but thats only to make the pain go away later.|`|BeEy621vaa	Well first there going to numb the area with Novocaine, that's done with a needle, so that part hurts for a second. The rest of the process is almost painless but uncomfortable.|`|KK1xHrePaa	Well, lets see last time i had a filling they gave me a shot but i had no idea there even was a shot involved. I felt no pain. So truly I believe its more mental like if you think the shot is gonna hurt its gonna hurt.|`|MV1ZWnpLaa	No it doesnt hurt  unless your like me and scream  anytime you see and needle and exaderate lol
LbWG9zu9aa	My spacers fell out and i put them back in myself with the floss like you said and it didn't alter my outcome when i had them put on. Sometimes when the spacer has fell out it means that the space has been made. When i got my spacers put in it was two weeks before my braces went on but that is only because there was space after my initial consultation. Also if you are worried about the teeth marks on them you could go back to the surgery and get new ones if you don't have spares but it shouldn't really make a difference|`|YBcB0732aa	You should be fine.Actually that particular spacer did it's job by making room now that it actually fits properly.    The spacers are rubber they push you teeth to make room.
AA10250756	They do come back with some people. They have to do a culture to find out what kind of UTI you have so you get the right medication. There are some cranberry concentrate capsules that are over the counter at the drug store and they help keep you from getting a UTI. you also have to drink lots of water every day.|`|gSo4dR7oaa	Make sure you take the entire course of antibiotics exactly as your doctor prescribes.  If you don't, leftover bacteria could multiply and cause more problems.  Frequent or untreated UTI could lead to kidney damage.    Drinking more water and cranberry juice may  help prevent UTI, but will NOT cure a UTI you already have.    If you have not done so already, consider seeing a urologist--a specialist who may be able to help you figure out what is causing your frequent infections.|`|JexFy4Cnaa	a low cost and very effective treatment for the problem is cranberry juice. I mix it with mineral water so its nicer. I used to get infections every few weeks it felt like...but i have learned to manage it. My doctor told me some people have thin lining in their urethra that allows bacteria in easily.    Start thinking of some alternatives/natural therapies, in my case i am way better off drinking cranberry juice once a day (about 4 glasses a day if i already had an infection) and never needing to go to the doctor for treatment. good luck !|`|sCuw4JeRaa	Check out this web sight i had uti`s all the time till i ran across this. I have been free of them for over a year. It`s not cheap but was so worth it to me. Hope this helps.
2sycPf8Daa	Blood clots can be caused by many different things,namely anything that causes your blood not to circulate properly.Blood clots can occur for a number of reasons. One concern many people have is that blood clots can be caused by sitting for hours at a time, as when you're traveling by car or airplane. While sitting for long periods can promote a blood clot. By taking proper precautions, such as periodically stretching your legs or getting up to walk around, you can decrease your risk of developing a blood clot.     When a vein close to the surface of your skin is affected, you may see a red, hard and tender cord just under the surface of your skin. When a deep vein in the leg is affected, your leg may become swollen, tender and painful, most noticeably when you stand or walk. You may also have a fever. However, many people with deep vein thrombosis have no symptoms.     See your doctor if you have a red, swollen or tender vein,especially if you have one or more risk factors for thrombophlebitis, such as being inactive for a long period of time or a family history of the clotting disorder.   If vein swelling and pain are severe or occur with a high fever or shortness of breath, go to an emergency room. These signs and symptoms may indicate deep vein thrombosis, which increases your risk of a dislodged blood clot traveling through your veins to your lungs.     If thrombophlebitis occurs in a superficial vein, your doctor may recommend self-care steps that include applying heat to the painful area, elevating the affected leg and using an over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). The condition usually doesn't require hospitalization and improves within a week or two.     Take care as always.|`|MWe4hMm1aa	maybe you sit in a way that would do that and you don't realise it..or it could be a pinched nerve so the area is sensitive. or some people go red in a particular spot when they excercise. or it could just be a skin problem.     if it worries you just ask your doctor.
OE67o2dCaa	Nose bleeds can oftentimes have different causes, but rarely, if EVER, is the cause Diabetes.    Symptoms of Diabetes at his age, would likely be Type I, insulin dependent Diabetes, and they would include polyuria (frequent urination), persistent dehydration, and an abnormal hunger for carbohydrates.    A nose bleed could be many things.  In some people, when the blood pressure rises, nose bleeds occur.  In a child, who I'm assuming has good parental care (or you wouldn't be here!) the chances of persistently high blood pressure are low.    Another cause could be dry air.  If you live in a particularly dry area, a humidifier late at night while he sleeps could help fix this.  Try some of these simple tricks to do what doctors call a "differential"... you're doing ONE step at a time, to prove that each symptom is not it, and when you do one of them, and the symptoms stop, then you've found the cause.|`|7oYpbSjIaa	night sweats and nosebleeds are not signs of diabetes.  whoever told you that is wrong. talk to a doctor.|`|2dfc54c0eb87bcd7851f591498f1e09eaa	Is your house dry as many kids get nose bleeds from dry air. i would dry putting a humidifier in his room and see if that helps you can also try putting a dab of vasoline right inside his nose that will keep it moist and hopefully prevent the bleeds. i would try this first and if it doesn't help then take him in to the doctors to be checked out

cNzBfgFnaa	Oh gosh!  I think I will stay in the Dental area for a while.  It sounds like you may have a dry socket.  Do not rinse with listerine right now but do rinse with a saline solution of 1 tsp of salt to 1 cup of warm water.  If you smoke, place a warm damp wash cloth on your right side where the tooth was removed and bite down while smoking.  The thing to remember is that you must allow the area to heal and any suction at all pulls the blood clot.  You need to get to a dr right away.  Go to the dentist that removed it and they will place some medicine in there and that will help.  Ibuprofen is the only med that will help, you will need the anti inflamitory effect.  Take it every 6-8 hours and take 800mg.  usually 4 200mg tabs.  I hope this helps, if you havent already gone in.  This happens to a lot of people and the only way to fix it right away is a trip to the dentist.|`|KK1xHrePaa	Sorry about your pain, have you tried those gels that numb your mouth out for a while?|`|GHwYCvVvaa	It sounds like you have a dry socket.

rNsCkHEwaa	Speak to your doctor.  He/she can change your medication.  Don't be embarrassed.|`|a30ECl3aaa	Sexual dysfunction, including , decreased libido, delayed ejaculation, and lack of orgasm, is a common side effect of the SSRIs, a class of antidepressant medications, which includes Zoloft (sertraline). Sexual side effects are one of the main reasons that men being treated for depression stop taking their medications.    Lowering the dose of your Zoloft  a lower dose may continue to help your depression, but relieve your ED.   Switching to a different SSRI  changing your depression medication may also change the sexual side effects. You may have to go through several months of trial and error. Some options include Lexapro (escitalopram), Paxil (paroxetine), and Prozac (fluoxetine).   Switching to a different antidepressant medication  although most of the medications used to treat depression can cause sexual dysfunction, Wellbutrin (bupropion) is less likely to cause ED.   Taking a specific medication to treat your ED  in some men with ED caused by an SSRI, taking a medication such as Cialis (tadalafil), Levitra (vardenafil), or Viagra (sildenafil), may help. Your doctor can advise you if this is safe for you to do.  A word of caution: Do not abruptly stop your Zoloft; this can cause uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms and possible harmful side effects.    Erectile dysfunction can also be caused by other drugs besides the SSRIs, including some medications used to treat high blood pressure, most medications used to treat psychological disorders (such as depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia), and some medications used to treat an enlarged prostate and prostate cancer.
OE67o2dCaa	As a Type I Diabetic, I'll be the first to tell you, NO, it cannot be caused by eating too much sugar.    Mine, for example, was caused because of a genetic flaw in my immune system.  My immune system was heightened, 120% of normal, and initially they had diagnosed me with Leukemia!  However, as it turns out, at some point (age 13) I picked up a flu bug that looked somewhat like the BETA cells in the pancreas that produce insulin.  So when my immune system destroyed THOSE cells, they took my BETA cells with them, and I couldn't produce insulin.    Diabetes Type II, however, CAN be a result of obesity combined with a lack of exercise.  Two main reasons it occurs: too much fat on your Red Blood Cells (RBCs) means the hormone, insulin, that forces sugar into your cells (for ATP, energy) cannot get by.  Another way it happens, is if your body simply doesn't produce enough insulin (gestational, during pregnancy) you can't keep up, and your sugars will rise.    Long story sh... well, even longer I suppose, no, don't worry.  Eating like crap is an American way of life, and you'll be just as well off as anybody else who does.  Just don't become too large, and you'll be set!|`|ZNbauLJzaa	NO NO NO NO NO NO NO!  This question is asked here so many times.  There is no food that causes diabetes.  Type 1 is an autoimmune disorder.  Type 2 is linked to obesity and a sedentary lifestyle.  There is some genetic link, but it's not too strong.|`|kNhnwftoaa	No.   Gaining weight can though.|`|CsefdZ0Gaa	yes, too much sugar consumption can burn out your pancreas as it try to make enough insulin to keep up.|`|Tmr7f3Xgaa	Not directly.

yDJiiqcsaa	These are the 4 best ideas short of prescription anti-depressants.  1. Get REGULAR adequate sleep (remember that it takes about 3 or 4 nights of good sleep to compensate for one short night). You can't expect to stay up Fri/Sat and not "payfor that" until about Thursday.   2. Daily vigorous exercise (preferably in the outside air- err, not in freezing weather though) 3. Exposure to sunlight or sunlamps that simulate sunlight  4 Daily multi-vitamins and possibly St John's wort (natural anti-depressant)|`|zblFCh7Paa	Chill Relax watch a funny movie  What always cheers my depression is going for a long walk  by myself try to cheer up man ^.^|`|AEAxZEveaa	I would look more deeply into dietary cures.

Make sure you know what you're getting into. It works on your brain like an MAOI and so you have to abide by the same standards. You hear the commercials for medications that say "don't take this if you're taking an MAOI". That goes for St. John's wort too. You also have to stick to a low tyramine diet, which means giving up beer and some other foods.|`|KlDoKDEjaa	try to excesies with music also try to punch something like a pillow it gets all the bad emotions out of you hope i could help|`|52otNiElaa	If you play guitar(if not learn) play some blues.|`|y8jIXgOdaa	i would try talking to someone who you feel comfortable with/ a doctor. get some help because it could get worse =/|`|V2XqT8RPaa	theres two ways of looking at this..the scientific way (pschological etc) or the "religious" way! depending on what you believe you can go from there! obviusly science solves many problems...but true faith does as well! its your call!|`|45u3Ml46aa	you should try excersize yoga actually helps alot, it takes your mind off things and makes you at peace with yourself.

CNW6eAjoaa	It is normal and healthy for a young man to masturbate.  It is one of the few free pleasures available to everyone, and everyone does it.  There is no need to feel shame about it, because it is natural.  Forward thinking health groups now recommend it.  They say it helps to prevent prostate cancer later in life, builds a healthy reproductive system, and leaves you feeling relaxed, and stress free.  The white, creamy substance that comes out is semen, or '***'.  It is what is 'ejaculated' when you have sexual intercourse, and is the male component of the fertilization process to begin life.  In short, it is what makes a woman pregnant,...well that and a few other conditions.  Now, to dispel a few myths so you do not have to live out your early teens years with old wives tales and untruths.  No, it will not make you go blind, no, it will not give you hairy palms, no, you will not run out as your body produces it over your entire life,....and yes it is good for you.  At your age, several times a day is normal.  Your body will tell you when it does not want to do it any more that day.  No one wants to walk in on you so find a quiet, private time and place where you will not be disturbed.  E-mail me if you still have questions.  I will give you the no BS answers you need to know.  Good luck|`|AA11684065	Yes guy okay!!!! (IT'S NORMAL)  The stuff coming out is called semen. The word *** is a slang term.

GXiCrhVYaa	I took seroquel for 2 months and had to quit due to awful side effects. I don't know if you are looking for natural remedies or pharmaceuticals. I will start off with the natural stuff.    In terms of herbs, please remember that they can take 3-4 weeks of usage before they will start to work. These herbs include valerian root, kava kava, chamomile, hops, passion flower, lavender, and skullcap. Probably, valerian root and kava kava are the best.     You can also try 5-HTP, trytophan or melatonin (3 mg) from a vitamin store. I would not take melatonin for over a month unless your doctor says it is ok. It is a hormone produced by the pineal gland. If you take too much, your pineal gland might get "lazy" and produce less melatonin naturally.     If the natural stuff ain't working, you can try over-the-counter medicines in a drugstore include unisom, sominex, benedryl, Tylenol PM, Advil PM.    Prescribed sleeping pills are stronger than over the counter pills. They are better at putting you to sleep, but they can become addictive. Try to take them only when needed. At the top of my list are lunesta, ambien CR, and sonata.     There are stronger pills called benzodiazepines, for example, ativan and xanax. These two don't stay in your body very long, so you are unlikely to have grogginess the next day. Next on my list of benzos are restoril and prosom.    Even stronger are klonopin, librium or valium (the worst). These stay in your body for days and are not recommended unless necessary.     You can probably be ok with most of the benzos as long as you take them in moderation and not too frequently. If you decide to stop any of the benzos, you MUST taper off VERY slowly.|`|LMoJl7hFaa	Drugs can only make the problem worse.    One reason for sleep problems is that the liver is working too hard getting rid of toxins and thus effects the thyroid gland.   Drugs are hard on the liver.    There are lots of side effects with using drugs.  I've known a lot of people who wind up not being able to sleep while on 2 or 3 sleep drugs.    Find out from a good nutritionist what is going on and learn to sleep naturally.|`|CDZXUimLaa	You can try the following OTC meds:    Diphenhydramine (benadryl)  Doxylamine (unisom)  Dimenhydrinate (dramamine)  Melatonin (works best when combined with the above 3)

I went to a drug store and asked for something and the dude recommended that. it works like a charm. and doesn't sting at all.|`|cb422b6c3f9c9f2317116c9a1fcfe7d7aa	I do know there is a medicated bandaid on the market that has worked well for me and does not hurt.

AA11492002	You are more likely to die in a car or bus accident than having anything to worry from this one activity, something less than 1 in a billion.    Now if you were to have taken meth, I might be concerned. You are experimenting because of peer pressure, trying to look "cool". Be careful with what you experiment; avoid pills and any man made substances.     I highly recommend you not bow to peer pressure and take a karate class in place of experimenting.

Do the math.     If after you quit smoking, it takes 9 years for your cells to regenerate to almost new (about 90%).

k7MINvaIaa	Many. Surgical and catheter based ablation techniques are continuing to advance. You can ask your cardiologist for a referral to an electrophysiologist who performs these procedures.|`|2sycPf8Daa	Sometimes atrial fibrillation will correct or "reset" itself. The treatment option best for you will depend on how long you've had atrial fibrillation, how bothersome your symptoms are and the underlying cause of your atrial fibrillation. Generally, the goals of treating atrial fibrillation are to:Reset the rhythm  or  control the rate.Prevent blood clots.     Sometimes medications or cardioversion to control atrial fibrillation doesn't work. In those cases, your doctor may recommend a procedure to destroy the area of heart tissue responsible for the erratic electrical signals and restore your heart to a normal rhythm. These options can include:  Radiofrequency catheter ablation.   Surgical maze procedure.     Newer and less invasive techniques are being developed to create the atrial scar tissue. Doctors at some centers use radio frequency or cryotherapy applied to the outside surface of the heart through a small chest incision or through a scope placed into the chest cavity (thorascopic approach). Microwave, laser and ultrasound energy are also being studied as options to perform the maze procedure.As with atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter is usually not life-threatening when it's properly treated.    Take care as always.

cku5S9WLaa	Yes!! Several years ago I took Paxil for about 6 months. Before that I was feeling low but after taking them things like self-harming became easier to do and I would do it no matter what mood I was in. I decided on my own to come off them despite my doctors reccomendations to try something else. Once the Paxil was out of my system, I felt like all that emotional numbness went away and I was able to feel again.

Since 2001 I have taken 5 and am not med's resistant so I really don't understand the wanting to stop.<br>  <br>  Personally I would seek a second opinion and be open honest with that doctor because something is just not right in wanting to remove you from med's all together.  You have diagnosed depression, anxiety and ocd....I don't know what the heck he will do for those extra 2 diagnosis....if he wants you to come off them completely that leaves you high and dry to deal with it on your own! With Anxiety along that is  not possible......<br>  <br>  I would seriously have a talk with this doctor about trying something new or I would seek the advise of another doctor. Going off med's and having these 3 issues is to me a danger zone for the future of especially the depression and anxiety...some can handle ocd on their own with hard work but I really worry about the main 2. <br>  <br>  I took Paxil and Cymbalta and I do agree Cymbalta doesn't do a thing...didn't for me either.<br>  <br>  -- I hope I have helped you in some way and I wish  you the very best.

The doctor told me I was drinking to many sodas and it was developing the stones in my kidneys. I drank water for a solid 3 months, no cokes, tea, juice, nothing but water. There are no sugar in water. Do not drink the flavored water either. It also contains sugar. Well in the three months that I drank water I lost weight quickly but healthy. It has been about a year now and I am 32 pounds lighter. I weigh 160 now. I NEVER thought I would see 170, nonetheless 160. But you must loose weight in a healthy way other wise it will not stay off. 1-2 pounds a week Idealistically.     -Start today not tomorrow!-  -Drink only water, buy a case of water bottles and keep them in your car or room.-  -Do not eat before bed! very very bad-  -Make sure you eat a sugar free breakfast, and cereal  that is cocoa pebbles or things like hunny buns-  -Eat lots of raw veggies for snacks or fruit-  -Exercise, which is a planned and specific time set away from everything else just to burn calories, taking the stairs instead of elevator and walking to work or in between classes DO NOT COUNT-    Good luck and believe in yourself!!!

When your head/neck faces downwards for a long period of time, this can cause pain in your esophagus/ throat. <br>  <br>  If your throat feels scratchy, it may be irritated.

5Q8vMxuqaa	This is called "shy bladder". You find it difficult to pee in public bathrooms, i have it too! It gets annoying..I really have to go but it just won't come out! No matter how hard I try, it won't budge...I'm over it now though. Here's what you do, you find a spec or something on the floor (even if its the floor tile) and you just focus on it really hard, no matter what do NOT stop focusing on it. Don't blink, close your ears (usually when I hear people around me that makes it harder) but just zone everything out. If that doesn't work try closing your eyes, blocking your ears..and picture yourself in your own bathroom at home. I can't really close my ears cause my hands gotta be somewhere else lol ;) You try it though..Either way will help, good luck!    and if your at your friend's house try running the sink, the sound will make you want to pee! (almost forgot that part)|`|jwgliewnaa	Did you masturbate?|`|BsDv3k5iaa	Could be mental, could be a physical problem.  I suggest seeing your doctor.|`|hvgXADgfaa	Could just be you like UR TOLIET AND UR TOLIET ALONE|`|Ez4svBtXaa	just open ur pants let it just all flow down and out  and no it isn't a mental problem|`|jv0xjt1Iaa	your freaking crazy man!  go urinate on  a bush!  wear looser jeans|`|oojVKGjCaa	i thought i was the only one i cant pee, neither in school or in friends home its horrible and no its not a mental problem dont worry its just we cant haha yes so weird!!!|`|W9B6EJrWaa	Uh-oh!

Do you have a phobia of public bathrooms?|`|wufY5yXkaa	yes it is!  i have the same problem, i'd kind of rather pee my pants than go in an unfamiliar bathroom!     you have to work through it though.  i'm now able to use the restroom at work and at friend's houses.  you wont catch me dead in a mall bathroom though lol.  someday though!|`|zdPqht41aa	its most likely shyness its ok some people take forever to get over it  but like for me i cant do number two anywhere other than my own home or a family members house idk the thought of doing it anywhere else scares me and i do it reluctantly at friends houses but yeah its all mental just dont join the military cause you have to use the bathroom in front of eachother|`|SA1gfcFlaa	YES!! YOU HAVE A VERY SERIOUS MENTAL PROBLEM!! GO SEE A DOCTOR!|`|JmH8Zkimaa	yeah, basically its mental, when people arent comfortable where they are peeing, then your body just wont let you do it, i have the same problem when urinals have no walls in between them|`|35e17Gklaa	OH MAN !   that sounds like it sucks ..   lol im the oppisite, peeing in public or new places really   pumps my nads jkjk.

Could be anxiety in an uncomfortable environment. Could be that you have fears of the nastiness of other bathrooms (justified btw). I am 30. I hate peeing or pooping anywhere but home too.

HA2IV3r3aa	Yes. You need protein to survive.  You're underweight to begin with, so foregoing protein for that long isn't helping you.|`|2R1H8B8taa	One week of not eating meat is not going to make you lose all your muscle. With any different diet, or changes in routine, it is customary that you may feel weak and tired.    If you are thinking of trying a vegetarian diet, there are many ways to get protein from  sources other than meat. I did not eat any red meat for four years, but inevitably went back to eating red meat.    check out this resource, but please be healthy, eat and exercise.    http://www.vrg.org/    plus, there is a nice part for teens on this site|`|W9B6EJrWaa	Don't be stupid.  Just eat like a normal person and quit trying to draw attention to yourself.|`|Vr0f7w8Xaa	It is because you have a loss of protein! EAT MEAT!! And if you are trying to become vegetarian, try vitamins, and make sure you eat alot of protein-y food! :)|`|e7b9d32e1fb4efafbebd927303f7c128aa	Maintaining balance and healthy lifestyle is about moderation. Radical changes, even healthy ones, can put a lot of stress on your body. Changes should always be gradual to prevent shocking your system. Slow change also helps a person psychologically adjust to a new life style too.     To answer your initial question though, no you haven't lost all your muscle. Muscle is maintained through nutrition and exercise. Different kinds of foods and different kinds of exercise change the shape\length\size\weight and strength of your muscles.     This sort of change doesn't immediately cause muscle loss or gain. It does however have a relatively immediate change on your metabolism and energy levels.    What you are most likely experiencing is the body stress of change. Whether it was the sudden decrease of fats, protein, or iron, your body is now trying to adjust to the missing intake.     Try consuming some alternate sources of protein, iron and fat - in small amounts, to reintroduce them to your system over a couple of days. You'll feel your energy come back to  you.    Also, due to your age, height, and weight - you are considered pediatrically at a safe weight although lower is not really recommended. Over the next few months and years you should experience more weight gain as your muscles gain mass and your bones strengthen and body fills out. This weight is not an indication of "fat."     If you are becoming a vegetarian please consider talking to your doctor about making the changes in a healthy way. Becoming a vegetarian as a teenager means the doctor will have a few more things he will take into consideration when evaluating your overall health (periodic tests for anemia, and protein deficiencies).

If the bacteria possess a special toxin (some do, some dont) it causes scarlet fever and causes a red rash on the trunk, cause a sore throat and can damage the kidneys and heart|`|yMTCaB8qaa	it's a diesese caused of dirtiness and it does not exist except if ur in a dirty, really dirty place!|`|AA11693263	It is like Strep throat but with an itchy rash on the "trunk" of the body and bright red cheeks.

My advise to you is only based off of personal experience. If you are really worried about this pain & it continues, I would highly suggest calling the Nurses Hot line (if you have one in your town), or speaking to your doctor right away.    There are free online tools called "symptom checkers", that can help narrow down what could be the problem. One is from Web MD - http://symptoms.webmd.com/    .. and the other is from the Mayo Clinic - http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/symptom...    This might be a muscle spasm, they can be very painful, & if it is located in the torso area it can also make it painful to breathe (because breathing causes the muscle to work while it is in pain).  Using a pain relieving creme (like 'Bengay' or 'Aspercreme'), may help by rubbing it onto the painful area. Pain relievers such as aspirin may also help with the pain. (Use with caution, do not use if you know you are allergic to any ingredients in any products, & always read the directions before using).    If it only hurts when you try to take deep/long breaths, then it's probably a muscle spasm. If it hurts no matter how little you breathe, then I would again suggest going to your doctor.    I hope you feel better soon, good luck.|`|NRQXmIcwaa	Kidney?  check your blood sugar.|`|ND5KncX0aa	go to emergency. any pain like that means something bad is happening.|`|Ztc9YIYMaa	if its under your rib cage it could be pleurisy, ive had that its sharp like stabbing pains when you breathe or move a certain way
P3Fg1K2Vaa	Autism is a developmental disability that comes from a neurological disorder that affects the normal functioning of the brain. It is characterized by the abnormal development of communication skills, social skills, and reasoning. Males are affected four times as often as females. Children may appear normal until around the age of 30 months.    Autism Symptoms vary widely in severity, include impairment in social interaction, fixation on inanimate objects, inability to communicate normally, and resistance to changes in daily routine. Characteristic traits include lack of eye contact, repetition of words or phrases, unmotivated tantrums, inability to express needs verbally, and insensitivity to pain.     Behaviors may change over time. Autistic children often have other disorders of brain function; about two thirds are mentally retarded; over one quarter develop seizures.    Autism can be confused with several other disorders which may have similar behaviors. Here is a list of autism like disorders that you should look at.     It remains unclear, but a psychological one has been ruled out. Neurological studies seem to indicate a primary brain dysfunction, and a genetic component is suggested by a pattern of autism in some families. It is largely believed that autism is a genetic disorder that involves several genes related to gene function. However it is unclear to researchers what causes these genes to turn on. Learn more about other causes of autism.|`|8ryoShBpaa	My children no longer have autism because I got on this Internet and researched and found people who successfully rid it.  I did what they did, and now my children no longer have it. It's from pathogens and toxins.  Mainstream medical does not know this yet; it is not taught in schools yet, but thousands are ridding their children of autism.  I say this to let you know that ONLY those who have rid children of autism have the correct cause.  There are a bunch of people saying its this or that, but NONE of them have rid it in anyone, so they are WRONG.     You do not say much as to symptoms, but I am guessing your eyes are bothering you and you are feeling moody or different than usual.  I suggest going to an eye doctor; he/she may be able to detect an infection like Bartonella that affects moods and eyes.  Most medical doctors will likely not detect a problem, but you should at least try one.  If they can not help you, you can go to  www.generationrescue.org and ask about local doctors who REALLY know how to help you.  This is an organization of people who live near you who can tell you of their experiences and knowledge about doctors and services in your area.  It's totally free and they do not have ties to services or doctors.  They are just a bunch of parents who recovered their children, and know which doctors in the area know how to test and treat the pathogens and toxins, that are actually in epidemic proportions right now.|`|H6jdAQlQaa	You probably do not have autism.  If you have autism I think the doctor would have known when you were born.      I'm not entirely sure what causes autism, however my little sister has a form of autism and it is because a piece of her 10th chromosome fell off and attached itself to her 15th chromosome, sso she has 3 10th chromosomes.  That affects her behavior and also her speech.

Autism cannot be cured but needs pills. It causes you to have fantasies while begin mentally disabled. Some effects are Autism are being scared of normal things. Most likely to be good at one anything, like my cousin he has autism he's really good even at video  games, even we he never played it. Another effect is being which is most likely is being very short or a little bigger than midget size. My cousin is 12 and I'm 11 and I'm taler than him. If a person have autism, it will be most likely to get held back in some grades and he/she will not be able to go to collage. Hoped this helped you!|`|a98MpjZ9aa	First of all, you probably don't have autism.  It's something that starts in infancy.  The symptoms in children are withdrawal, anxiety, avoidance of eye contact,  inability to learn proper social behavior, poor fine motor or gross motor coordination, clumsiness, speech issues, and various bizarre behavioral symptoms.      There are no neurological tests or genetic tests or chemical tests for it.  It can only be diagnosed by observing behavior.    Autism is a mental disorder with an onset usually between birth and age two.  It is always caused by shock--psychological or physical.  There are no exceptions.  It is purely psychological.  Those who use terms like "neurobiological" are simply repeating medical euphemisms to describe the simple fact that ANYTHING that takes place in the brain is *neurobiological.*       It is always associated with at least one of the following:      Trauma in early infancy:  http://www.autism-pdd.net/testdump/test1...

zRXkkh0Maa	Firstly, please clip up your fringe. Everyone's hair is oily and therefore, it spreads oil on our forehead, making it oily and humid, which is very easy to grwo pimples and blackheads. You have to also clip up on both sides.     Eucerin is quite good. It has a tonic to help you lightenes your sacrs and lessen the oil, but you must find a washlotion that fits you most. Go to the pharmacist and ask them for assistance, or maybe a dermatologist if you really want to.     Please DO NOT put makeup as possible coz if you put it on for a long time there would also be a great big blast of pimples. Putting on makeup makes your pores humid and if it is not washed off cleanly, there would be blackheads.     Good luck! (:|`|ppNm3MORaa	To avoid further clogging of your pores, all cosmetics, lotions and sunscreens should be oil-free! To avoid dry skin, use an oil-free lotion such as Complex 15. To avoid sunburn use oil-free products such as Neutrogena or Coppertone Oil-free Sunscreen. And remember to beware of hair products and gels, as they tend to be very oily.

What you heard was one of this "infomercials", and they will say anything.    Lettuce is a high-fiber food.  it IS good for your diet.  it is also primarily water, and has few calories.  In effect, it take more calories to eat lettuce than the lettuce provides.  That IS good news!    But the bad news is that to burn any serious amount of calories in excess of the lettuce, you'd have to eat like 40 pounds of it!  And if you eat 40 pounds of ANYTHING, you WILL gain weight, and that is bad news for the diabetic.    Other than that, lettuce has NO special or "magical" qualities that benefit the diabetic.    The most recent TRUE news is that scientist have found that some rats can be CURED of diabetes using stem cells.  However, it is a LONG way from experiments on rats to a commercial cure for humans.  IF this proves to be good for humans too, it will take 20-30 YEARS before a "cure" is available.|`|09b317729060c9dedb69f8059c07c3d0aa	This is what you mean.

AA11522944	Tights pants... whether underwear or over-wear... will hold your testicles close to your body which can cause overheating.    Your testicles 'sag' in a pouch away from the body for a reason... that reason is that sperm production is optimal at a temerature lower than your core body temperature.    Wearing clothing that holds your testicles against your body can lower sperm production and cause fertility problems.    If you wear tight underwear ensure that you do not wear it 24/7.  Sleep without underwear or sleep naked.|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	If your pants are too tight - when you let a fart - you'll blow your shoes off!  Did I say that?|`|k4NAnEYpaa	your testicles can overheat because the tight pants push your testicles closer to your body.|`|vw4KXRlLaa	If the pants are tight enough then they can hold the testicles closer to the body than they might normally be, causing excess heating of the testicles, which has been shown to cause damage to sperm.    However they'd have to be really tight pants for a really long time to have that even remotely be a possible issue.  Only other thing is it might make it a little more likely you accidently squick one of your boys when sitting or doing other things.|`|LQ04emc3aa	most guys try to sag their tight pants.  less they have nothing.|`|e8yt5PrGaa	they might constrict circulation but that is it|`|ATC2fFMqaa	if ur balls get too hot the heat will eventually will kill ur sperm......when ur ballz get hot they drop...in tight pants or briefs ur balls cant drop.....this is nothing to worry about if u are a teen or in ur 20;s....but if ur married and wanting to have a baby....most likely ur wearing dress pants to work anyway....and if u wear briefs like most married guys do then try commando in the lounge pants or boxers every once in a while....especailly if u and ur wife want a baby

2R1H8B8taa	You definetly need to take the pill every day at the same time.    There are different types of pills out there. Ortho tricycline, and many others, have three weeks of "active" pills, and one week of "reminder pills". In these types, you can skip the inactive/reminder pills and not be in trouble.    Yaz works differently. The hormones are balanced differently, so that all four weeks there is active hormones.    Personally, it didn't work for me. It caused major headaches, dizziness and mood swings.    If you are looking for birth control that is not in pill form, check out deprovera.    http://www.birth-control-comparison.info...|`|KVhbEf6zaa	Not if you are trying to prevent pregnancy.

Bu6kTnLfaa	its a fear of the unknown- its also what tv and other socials and conditioning as a child has taught you- young is where its at- WRONG my mother tells me all the time that 30's is where its at because you are comfortable in your own skin- you know who you are and you are building really on what you are rather than what you will be like in your 20's .. 40's you become laid back and really enjoy life as it rolls in and 50's well you bask in your children's growth and see them starting the cycle- 60's you learn of retirement and feel free in life to trael and explore- 70's you see your grandchildren and work with them. 80s you learn your legacies of life and share them - all the while you can have a fullfilling life no matter what age- be contenet with the fact that you are alive and have  this very moment to treasure as every moment - every event is there to teach you and you are to learn about life. that is the point of life- to learn it every step of the way :)|`|OoGLOAzhaa	Yes Youth is exciting but that doesn't mean you need to be dissapointed about getting older.

Often they put things in capsule if they want to have it slowly release over time, so your body doesn't absorb it all at once.  They sell acai berry powder mixtures that you can mix into water.

You can also exercise in the MORNING. Right after you get up, exercising will get your blood pumping. Exercising at night will give you this high energy - right before bed. Stupid.    Don't take naps... Get lots of sleep at one time rather than getting a nights sleep of only 6 hrs and taking a 2 hr nap will confuse your body.

mAp90hEeaa	Tylenol or ibuprofen taken regularly as directed on the box, sipping very cold or hot liquids, gargling with warm salt water gargles and spit out - do this as often as you want; resting as much as possible while your body heals itself and running a humidifier in the bedroom where you sleep.  And, consider getting a strep test done if you haven't already to see if you need any antibiotics.  Sore throats usually go away in about 5 days|`|rsAqrbsgaa	tea and honey|`|5bYpbodUaa	Vanilla Chai Tea.  I drank this tea when I was sick, and it made me feel MUCH better. Hot tea is especially good for the sore throat. And adding honey makes it taste really good too.  I make the Chai tea with water. It calls for water or milk, but with your sore throat, I don't recommend milk at this time.    Hope you feel better soon!|`|mMKayhNGaa	i gurgle salt water i mean like 1/4 salt 3/4 hot water|`|AA10453678	a nice cup of tea usually helps.|`|f8mLpPXlaa	Yeah, gargling with salt water will help soothe it.

This is what I usually do:  *Drink hot/warm soup.  *Drink tea.  *Eat cough drops (Halls, etc)  *Water  * And if none of these works, then i just withstand the pain until  it gets better and take medicine, because the only way to get rid  of it is to be patient, rest, take medicine.    :o)

You can start to strengthen your "bad" arm by moving it. Don't lift any weights just yet but you want to stretch your arms and shoulders at least 3 times per day to get the blood flowing. The worst thing you can do is not move your arm.  Raise your hands above your head the move them side to side etc...after a few weeks you'll notice that your arm is stronger.<br>  <br>  Also, if you ask your doctor, he can give you great exercises...good luck!
NuvKPl3naa	you know the old saying "be yourself". i would start small with talking offer her a drink etc... maybe walk away and come back later on, take it slow. see how it goes and if it seems she likes you. if so, you could then hang out with her and talk about basic things. then if its still going well chances are she likes you too, and ask her out, or have a friend invite you to go someplace with him and his girlfriend and see if she would like to go. couples ease the tension, having anxiety sucks i know, but couple dating at first may help good luck|`|kr0IgpDeaa	A SUPER BOWL PARTY IS A GREAT TIME TO SOCIALIZE WITH A GIRL YOU LIKE.

Would you tell her lies to get her to admire you? Would you do something against your will just to impress her?    Of course not.    So why not begin your conversation with the truth about how you feel about her, and that you're really nervous because you suffer from CAD, but that you really want to start things out right with her. GEE! Do you think blunt honesty might be what turns her on to you?|`|5pszijaDaa	a: listen to bob  b: if you want to show her you like her and don't want to have to try to talk (no conditions and i still end up sounding like a fool) try expressing it as an action. when sitting next to her put your arm over her shoulders or try holding her hand. you do probably want to talk to her about your feelings when you become comfortable though.
OCMSTxYfaa	you need a new doctor..a specialist to be exact!  If you have had this for 4 years and no one can diagnose you, there is a problem with the doctors you have seen.  don't create problems in your head until you know for sure. the stress about worrying that it is cancer will only add to your illness.<br>  Maybe you have a rare disease that is harder to diagnois...so don't give up...and good luck!|`|ZrEOteztaa	Usually... cancer kills you if you've had it for 4 yrs...or at least gets much worse over time!!!

1RXOjaryaa	You're giving us guys an awful lot of credit. Do you know how long it takes us to notice that a girl has changed her HAIR (let alone her eyes) even when we like her? It's not that we're shallow. It's just that we're not all that observant about that sort of thing.    Still, yes, we're capable of telling the difference (whether or not we actually notice is another story), and no, I don't think it matters .

If you do this and follow a healthy diet you should see results in the first month.  you will probably loose the 15lbs within 2 if not sooner.

T8AkXMpxaa	You can save money by making meals yourself. There is no reason you should need to spend more than ￡120 a month on healthy food. <br>  <br>  Cereal doesn't have to be expensive to be healthy. You should ignore the healthy brands like special k etc... because they put a premium on what is a very unspecial product. Try smart price (Asda) oats, cornflakes or muesli. It's just the same and less than half the price.<br>  <br>  Apples are cheap. But Check in your supermarket or local fruit store for specials, sometimes they buy in too much of one thing and reduce the price. Fruits vary in price with the seasons as well, so make sure your buying fruit that is in season.<br>  <br>  Smoked mackerel is healthy, but they say you only need one or two portions of fish a week.  There is nothing wrong with freezing things. You could make 3 or 4 portions of a big healthy meal then freeze the extra ones. This saves time and ensures that it will be as cheap as possible.<br>  <br>  Instead of ready made quiches you could follow a recipe and make it yourself, share the cooking with other people.<br>  <br>  The Brands these days are very savvy about making things healthy and convenient and they will charge you a premium for that.

1lewFV8oaa	20/40 vision is slightly worse than normal vision.  It means that you have to be 20 feet away from an object to see it when a person with normal vision can see the object at 40 feet.    You can legally drive in most US states with 20/40 vision in one eye.  If you have 20/40 vision it is a good idea to wear corrective lenses when driving at night.      Legally blind is when a person's best corrected visual acuity is at 20/200 or worse.  I knew there is another parameter for legal blindness that involves the field of vision but I can't remember exactly what it was.    If your vision is correctable that is all that really matters.|`|8nbeqVRVaa	ummm well my vision is somewhere worse than 20/400 (yes, 400, not 40)... and i have friends with worse vision than me. 20/40 isn't perfect vision, but it's definitely not great.|`|bXLgpUq2aa	20/40 is adequate for driving a car in most states but not really sharp enough for safe night driving.

She is probably gonna have to go on antibiotics. I would stay away from hospitals because they are gonna be very expensive. A clinic is better and talk to a pharmacy about the generic antibiotics that are on a $4.00 plan.

LzJMaw2Iaa	It's possible the tech saw signs of an infection or other problem in your glands and/or lymph nodes in your chest.  When I had a lump develop in my neck right around the time I had bronchitis, the tech that did chest x-rays to check for pneumonia was able to use the x-rays to determine that my lymph nodes weren't involved in the mass on my neck.  It's all connected so there's probably nothing to worry about as far as the mammogram results themselves.  You may want to follow up with your doctor about whatever else the tech may have seen the prompted the sinus question.|`|AA10352420	I am not sure why she asked this question Mammogram does not show any infection in the sinus These pictures are the picture of the breast only.

Cavities don't develop in a couple of hours you know. it takes months. But if you don't floss, you could get infections/cavities where the tooth brush doesn't reach. Unless your teeth are really spaced out, then you should floss. It doesn't take long, just buy those small ones with a handle and a string and just use that. It literally takes one minute.|`|pOgzmCn2aa	Without flossing, plaque in between your teeth can build up and cause things like cavities and periodontal disease. Flossing is good for your teeth because it also helps with the blood flow in your gums.    While your dentist says you do not have any cavities, it is possible to get them from not flossing, sometimes you will not notice any problems until later in life.     However, most people floss too hard and cause their gums to be cut and bleed, which can lead to infections.    So break out the floss and floss lightly between your teeth, it will not only help the blood flow to your gums (which could be why they're darkening, I am not sure about that) it will get rid of any nasties that your toothbrush might've missed.    Also a good Floride mouthwash helps clean out your mouth so you have amazing teeth --and breath!|`|tAEHBJ8gaa	uhh your breath will stank.|`|pKIIOuyLaa	you only need to floos when u have something stuck in ur teeth that wont come out

I went through the light cramping as well. If your period was normal from 2/14 until 2/20 it would be odd if you got pregnant so soon after, but life does have its little quirks. Just keep an eye out for more spotting and good luck to you!|`|whHVJc0gaa	that coul mean you werent finished yet or if you had sex you could have got an std|`|SWAWw0Wdaa	go to the doctor|`|dr32Mtxdaa	go to the doctors|`|eMSP740Taa	I seriously doubt that you could be pregnant, since us women can only get pregnant when we ovulate. The average woman ovulates between the 13th and 15th day of your menstrual cycle. When you began spotting you were only on you 8th day. So the spotting in my opinion cannot be due to pregnancy. One thing that is well known for causing spotting is having either begun or recently stopped using a method of birth control. Also if you are not consistent with your birth control spotting can occur. Hope this helps a bit!!|`|Zu2oVVhoaa	take a pregnancy test and if it says negative wait a few weeks then take anouther one!!

Iodine is by far the best antibiotic, antiviral and antiseptic of all time - Dr. David Derry    According to http://www.naturalnews.com/022800.html  Dr. Derry says that iodine is effective "for standard pathogens such as Staphylococcus, but also iodine has the broadest range of action, fewest side effects and no development of bacterial resistance."

h0ypk4Dtaa	Your middle ear is connected to your throat by a tube called the Eustacian tube. This tube opens to equalize the pressure inside the middle ear, because it is otherwise a closed chamber and the structures could be damaged. When you contract the muscle surrounding the opening of the tube in throat (salpingopharyngeus muscle), the tube is opened and the pressure is equalized. That is the "pop" that you are talking about, and it can be uncomfortable. Try yawning or chewing gum before you blow your nose to equalize the pressure. Then the "pop" won't be so drastic.|`|cZsUrErMaa	Try to hold your breath for about 30 second that should do the trick|`|688a7b812dded24c0867e947aee9d86aaa	Try blowing one nostril at a time.

Anyway, I have two pieces of advice, one of which I am very comfortable will apply for you, and the other I am quite not as confident.  (You'll have to guess which is which.)  Here they are:  (1) You need "color tints" for dark eyes, and should buy them from an optometrist so that, even if not prescription, they will fit your eyes.  (i.e. don't just choose a brand, go in and let the optometrist suggest the brand.)  (2) Don't look for non-verifiable information Yahoo!

If he's masturbating multiple times a day then he needs to give it a bit of a rest, say once every 2 days for ejaculate to be produced everytime without fail. After about 2 years of being able to produce ejaculate, he'll be fine with masturbating everyday and still being able to put out some ejaculate everytime. He could even do it multiple times a day and still shoot out some. Don't worry really, he's not running dry, sperm is replenished daily, but in small amounts.

But try calling your doctor, and ask if it's serious enough for you to go in.|`|uSsmriwWaa	I had a c-section over 9 months ago and it still feels weird. The muscles are probably always going to be weaker in that area since they were severed. I still have a pins and needles feeling when I touch it, and some women say that never fully goes away. I think it sounds normal, but if it continues, call your doctor.
BaX0rfRmaa	Don't listen to the negative responses your getting. You can check online at the American Cancer Society, cancer care has come a long way, I was diagnosed Sept. 2007 went through radiation and chemo treatments, kept a very positive attitude, did what I was told to do, changed some of my eating and drinking habits. I love coffee but couldn't drink it during my chemo. It made me feel sick. Herbal teas were great. I don't know what type of lung cancer you need info on, I had non small cell, and was going into the 3rd stage when I was diagnosed.  Essiac tea was great too, you can get it at the Health Food stores.|`|3jFm0rWdaa	The most people who die of cancer each year die from lung cancer.  Less than 30% of people with lung cancer survive 5 years.  90% of people who get lung cancer are smokers - do the Math!|`|teAtI3Itaa	usually lung cancer is diagnosed when it's too late, though I'm not a doctor so my answer can't be counted too much|`|lEjYhwxkaa	my husband died within 6 mths of being diagnosed. He died a horrible death.
kRTSVuywaa	maybe you shouldnt drink so much|`|kFlMHSKIaa	Cut down on your drinking and do not mix alcohol with your presciption drugs.|`|pcdEb8kMaa	Usually numbness in the face can be a sign of a mini stroke if you are mixing these things you should see a doctor soon(now).|`|tfC8BQXOaa	you are right to be scared. And yes, if you drink and take drugs what do you expect it'll happen? Your liver must be in a bad shape indeed.<br>  I am not sure the doctor can do anything except tell you to give up drinking every day.|`|EMbaak9waa	If your on Lexapro then you should only drink sparingly.<br>  Maybe grinding your teeth doesn't help.<br>  Don't be too scared, just go and see your doc and see what he says.
cNzBfgFnaa	Hi Steph, I answered your other question and yes, I did add you because you remind me so much of myself.  I think you are a sweetheart and you are just in a hard place.     why do so many of you think she is talking about illegal drugs...I have not seen anyone on here help her except say how aweful drugs are.  While knowing how terrible illegal drugs are and how they affect your body and long term life is important, I think all you need is a good friend and some good old support without judgement. I could never suggest illegal drugs to anyone...aside from all else, they are illegal!  There are many natural remedies, personally I think they do not work.  I think the reason is that anything must be done along with your diet and exercise.      Like I said before, there are ways to loose weight fast, people do it, but I would be interested to do a long term study to see how it worked long term, even over a 2 year period.  I bet we would find that they are trying another one, for yet another quick fix.    Try to add a quick fix to a dedication to a life change, as I said before.  You will loose weight quickly and you will be able to keep it off by making a change.  any type of drug alone is guaranteed to leave you unhappy in the end.  Exercise increases energy and increases endorphines and overall makes you happier.      Try the plan I gave you in the last question.  I would like to hear how it works for you, if you want, you can join my sister and I as we loose weight together using caloriecounter.com and it is free.  It calculates everything for you!      Keep in touch and contact me if you need someone to share this with.  With a little work, the girl you see in the mirror will soon be the girl everyone else sees too!  I have a feeling you are georgous.  You need someone who understands we make mistakes, someone who doesnt judge your mistakes, just helps you through them.      Good luck sweetie.|`|9EgXeA2waa	all drugs do, some cus of lost apetite|`|BMConIedaa	Have you seen a picture of Amy Winehouse recently?  Are you SURE you still want to use drugs to lose weight?  Or are you just plain stupid?|`|oubC3TCOaa	Drugs don't help you lose weight, Darling.  They will just make you look ugly.|`|7n4rtfp6aa	I wouldn't recomend using drugs in order to lose weight, as the side effects could be terrible. Try not eating affter 6, eating more fruits&veggies..not the pills. Trust me its not worth it|`|Ts33DJSwaa	stay off the drugs period. tobacco for one but seriously drugs arent the answer to shi*.    if you want to lose weight, ease less or exercise more, get more active and eat healthy, easy...    on drugs, check out:    www.uniteagainstdrugs.com    for more info|`|e8f092bbd197b0b3bdad36d4e1287a01aa	DONT DO DRUGS|`|RSB4RRDJaa	Not canabas for sure it makes you gain weight :)|`|CAkVYHeMaa	No drug makes you loose weight safely, The side effects out weigh the weight loss, for the amount of money you could spend on these dugs you could hire a personal trainer at your local gym who can advise you on the right diet etc - dont go there|`|vZtDjHJUaa	GIVE HUGS NOT DRUGS|`|YeUJCvKUaa	cocaine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, methylphenidate, mdma.    It's been really fast then probably something really addictive like inahled crack/meth.    However, drugs are not the answer to Weight loss, make sure you eat a healthy diet and exercise..|`|C3eCfiXaaa	Well theres meth, side affects include: gross skin, possably scabs, horrible acne, and overall a very ugly appearance, looking like a creep when your twitching all over and moving your mouth obnoxiously, acting completely weird, paranoid, your friends will probably stop hanging out with you, and probably become an addict. You may be skinny, but it would be wasted because the rest of you would look like a hot mess.  DRUGS ARE BAD MKAY.  just eat right and exercises, youll do just fine, besides if you take drugs to loose weight if you ever want to get off them the weight will just come right back on. Be healthy and good luck!|`|vZMN82U8aa	drugs are a short term remedy to a simple poblem...    1 stop reading beauty magazines  2 get up go out and exercise...   3 stop drinking alcohol  4 eat a healthy diet...     unless you do this, all the drugs will do is turn you into a stick insect, make you ill, and cause you all sorts of health issues...

xxq5JAM6aa	You need an antibiotic. Plain and simple. Sounds like what you've got could easily turn into pneumonia, if it hasn't already.|`|c05bb431beac7ffe86bf43bdbf9897fcaa	Yeah, at 16 you are considered an adult, and shouldn't have a fever of 103 for longer than a day. It is too high. You might need an antibiotic. If you need to see a new doc to get the antibiotic, go do it.|`|ccded6c1859c9ef04f029c1502be58d9aa	Yes, you should be a little concerned with the fever 103. If it is a constant 103 you should go to the E.R/hospital. I have been admitted to the hospital before for a temp of 104/105. The body aches and fatigue along with the temp would make for a good reason to go back in to the doctor.
PHyNJHRCaa	It won't hurt the whole time. I broke my tibia on my right leg about two inches above the ankle when I was 18. I understand your pain. You're young and it will heal a lot faste for you than it did for me. Hang in there. ^_^|`|7xq7hUB7aa	once the cast comes off, if will feel like if pressure is rushing down to your ankle, just make sure your leg is always elevated and keep taking those pain killers. you will be fine, the pain will go away and it shoudnt stay for all 6 weeks.|`|WdNBCHIDaa	im 13 and i broke my tibia in in the fall....mine hurt for about the first 2 weeks and then it stopped. i just took advil when it hurt[:<br>  good luck(:|`|SWAWw0Wdaa	No, but the first 3 will be the most painful|`|twy8S0L2aa	not all 6 weeks, but it willfor the first few weeks. how did u break it|`|AA11101968	Not likely the entire 6 weeks, but at least another week or so.  Talk to your doctor about the pain and sleeping problems though, no need to keep that to yourself.
gViGPF0Faa	That is confusing. Don't care about how your teeth look with braces on. My dentist did that too. She moved two teeth together, but then there was a gap on the other side and other junk like that. I kept worrying my teeth would never work out well, but they did. So don't worry in the end they will look perfect|`|M9X9usmzaa	The teeth are  really unpredictable, your ortho is probably just taking care of the problems as they come. . . it really depends on how long you have had braces and what was wrong with your mouth in the first place.   If you have any friends that have had braces dont expect to do the same things as they do.   Elastics are also when your teeth are ready, you can ask your ortho and they might be able to tell you possibly when .. .|`|VBmEhDdfaa	what?|`|iaDhbBQQaa	Maybe your orthodontist is a quack.|`|vm5TgsQwaa	some teeth do go back to normal. I had a spacer before I got my braces when i was younger Elastics are used when your jaw is crooked (bottom on left & Top on right)|`|AA10747411	Sometimes in the process of getting the teeth to where they need to be permanently the teeth have to shift to different places.  I'm not an orthodontist but I work in an ortho clinic.  Perhaps he or she is trying to stabilize your teeth more with the metal ties.  We use those sometimes if the little O's aren't quite strong enough.      When you have questions you should be able to ask the orthodontist in a sweet way; however, the one I work for would probably get mad if someone had questions.  He's kind of a jerk!!  Anyways, best to you!!!|`|cB247Azuaa	Were you too shy to ask the orthodontist?  I'm sure he/she can be reached during office hours.|`|pKIIOuyLaa	He must not be a great dentist have them put on but for longer|`|paHt6Yi8aa	i can't really answer the question, but i'd ask the orthodontist why the heck he didn't give u a retainer?|`|kuJY1yiBaa	I don't really know. You should talk to your orthodontist about this. You pay him to take care of this. Don't waste your money. :D|`|n54cx5Lxaa	Its just a process in getting your teeth to move together, the rubber bands will eventually be put back on.|`|0SoglbRUaa	you should just do what the orthodontist tells you.  he has gone through college for it so you should trust him/her.  dude, like just go with the flow!! dont be confused.  do research about it if you need to haha!|`|tjEG8dxwaa	ask your parents about that.|`|kCghGbopaa	I have a power chain right now...and my gap isnt fully closed.  My friend had the same thing as you....but all her teeth had a space inbetween them.  I think its because they can straighten them out then pull them back together.  I would as you dentist.|`|0QT269rOaa	Teeth move surprisingly easily.  From my experience with braces and years of other work, what you are describing is normal.  I've had both elastic bands and metal ties, both alone and combined.  It's just one of those things that you'll probably never understand even if your orthodontist tries to explain it.  I still don't get it.  Since teeth movement can be unpredictable, it may take a few tries and different methods before he/she can get the correct results.  Just trust them!  My advice is if you are really dying to know is to ask your orthodontist next time you go in.
BMConIedaa	Sounds like conjunctivitis, the proper term for "pink eye."    WebMD is your friend.  http://www.webmd.com/search/search_resul...
8goEkQ49aa	I agree with Aseem.  Lung cancer most frequently spreads to brain and bone, and it's very hard to watch.    I'm a hospice nurse, just FYI.  I do not like the dermal pain patches at all, especially for cancer patients.  Pain can change rapidly, and the medication dose on these patches takes a long time to "catch up".  There are better medication choices, in my opinion.  Talk frankly about this with her doctor.    May her journey be comfortable, and yours too-- as you walk her to the gate of her next experience.  We all pray for the best outcome possible in situations like yours.|`|dbVQpbScaa	I am sorry to learn about your grandma.    What she's suffering from is stage IV Lung cancer which has spread to bones (hip) and may be also to her brain (her talk and twitches). She has only 25% of her lung remaining the functioning of which is compromised by the cancer.  In these conditions it is best for her not to receive any chemotherapy as she may not be able to stand the side effects.  In addition the pain pills are helping her to be free of pain in her last days, therefore, the doctor is okay with it.  Rather ask the doctor for dermal patch if that could be used and just try to see that she feels comfortable in her last days.  Sorry for such an analysis, but this is what can be inferred by the information given.  Just take her to a place which is near to her heart and let her go in peace.|`|W7LGoC3yaa	I know it must be so hard to see your grandma like this. Try to stay positive and let her know how much you love her.  Stage 4 is extremely serious.  If the doctors aren't going to give her chemo there probably is little chance for recovery.  I'm so sorry.|`|AA11492002	Take good care of your grandma. Unfortunately bone cancers are the most difficult to treat and often do not respond to radiation. If she gets a response to radiation she will be a lucky one.
9FlAKRSRaa	But don't stop!!<br>  Don't take breaks.<br>  <br>  I mean, well, you can do a little bit of exercise that lasts like 2 minutes.<br>  <br>  I suggest Yoga on Sundays. I'm 15 too (except I'm not super bothered to exercise LOL) and I find yoga really awesome.<br>  <br>  Your diet is good. You're going to experience a bit of "blahness". I mean, it's not super yummy and there isn't any taste in it.<br>  <br>  AND YES<br>  Do not put too much dressing on your salad. It's supposed to be fattening, I THINK.

You need to let your muscles rest and rebuild. Otherwise your body might get used to it too fast and you'll plateau (won't loose weight anymore).|`|wb9BBKzRaa	I think you need to ease into it. That sounds like a lot of working out, you'll be killing yourself.|`|hgRNavIBaa	Wow, perfectionist or something? Huh you are really on the diet thing!|`|8hULtMU9aa	sounds good to me|`|WiQNbmHFaa	it takes usually 4 - 6 weeks to see any results from working out. and make sure your in taking at least 1,200 calories a day! you don't want your body going into starvation mode.

XN0cYCATaa	Sounds like you have had an allegic reation to the medication the Doctor gave you, Go back to the Doctor and inform Him, I have had a Boil before, The best way to get rid of it is to soak it as long as you can and as often as you can in as hot a water as you can stand it, this will cause the Boil to liquify and come to a head, The core will trun yellow inside and the top will turn Black just before it begins to drain, when it does keep pleanty of gauze to catch it is it is a mix of pus and Blood and will stink a bit but that is normal|`|ppNm3MORaa	DO Drink Lots and Lots of Water    DO NOT....  1.

They even have special hot teas for soothing sore throats.|`|gcVeEbiNaa	Sucking on popsicles and throat drops with menthol can help numb the pain.  What really helps with the pain is Tylenol Sore Throat Daytime or Tylenol Extra Strength Rapid Blast. Both are liquids and really get to the pain quickly.   If your throat doesn't feel better soon get to the doctor in case of Tonsilitis or Strep!

4ErKoqbzaa	the hymen is NOT always an indication of intercourse. it can be torn through sports and accidents as well. therefore; that's not proof of whether or not you're a virgin. your gyno would ask if you're sexually active, and it's true that they cannot tell your parents. do not ever lie to the gyno about whether or not you are having sex. your secrets are safe with them, and they're just trying to make sure you're healthy.|`|71ae4755ec6533f862aed7b1761c0dccaa	Yes, they would notice the absence of your hymen.  But if you're worried about your gyno telling anyone - they won't.  It's all confidential.|`|iJtuhLMTaa	No they can't unless there is evidence of recent sexual activity (ie seminal fluid).  They can only tell if your hymen is intact and the hymen can be broken or stretched in many ways other than sex (ie exercise, tampon use etc)  Many women break or stretch their hymens by other means long before they ever have sex.    You do however need to be honest with your doctor about any sexual activity as there are test that need to be run if you are sexually active that they will not run if you tell them you are not.   Most are for conditions that are easily treatable but can have long term affects on your health and/or fertility if left untreated.|`|quTKsQPhaa	Usually. Don't worry, she won't tell your parents unless you give her permission to...|`|Di8rxYvUaa	Yes|`|qttFnNz7aa	most likely ...they are specialists  but just b/c the hymen is broken doesnt mean the person had sex ..it could be broken from sports, using a tampon,or masturbation...|`|pE8oQTWgaa	NO, ALL THESE ANSWERS ARE WRONG!    She can not tell if you've had actual sex unless you tell her, which she will most likely ask you anyways(Standard question). Some people masturbate and they loosen their own hymens which looks similar to someone who's had sex,so no, the doctor can not tell for sure weather or not you've had sex unless you tell them.|`|0KXxsTsyaa	Yes, of course!! They specialize in the reproductive system, so of course they could tell!|`|wufY5yXkaa	if she looks in your vagina and doesn't see a hymen, she'll probably put two and two together.|`|9nYifIn4aa	They cannot tell by just looking at you, but if they examine inside, then yes, they can tell.  But they cannot tell anyone else, so your secret will be safe with them.|`|1HeW6F6qaa	They're specialists! Of course they can; male or female.|`|yPAdMJbDaa	well...the hymen ("Cherry") is normally popped by intercorse.    but sometimes from other things.    and if you a teenage worring about if your moms gonna be able t tell if your a virgin or not dont worry bc you cna just say it happened a long time ago when you fell off your bike or something.    and your dactor isnt going to be like "Yeep, shes no virgin"  she/he will ask first.  and if your hymen is already broken they will asume that something happened.    your doctor wont make it known that your not a virgin.  promise.|`|UIbZOOBIaa	Yes of course she is a doc. Whether you have a grl or a guy they both can tell because when you have sex there is a thing called a cherry in you that gets popped. Thats how they tell.|`|FWFkLRmMaa	yea   if youre thinking about lying to your gyno-that should be the LAST person you lie to. due to patient confidentiality-they cant tell your parents about what you tell them unless youre thinking of hurting yourself or others, so dont worry about hiding it from your doctor so they wont tell your parents
bufQfEqbaa	If your temperature is above 105 is life threatening  and can cause you to become unconscious.  Hypothermia slows your heart rate way down and will eventually cause you to become unconscious and die. If you hit your head, you can have a concussion which if you pass out this is severe and needs immediate medical attention.  Heat stroke can cause you to faint and is very severe as well.  So all of those are severe and need medical attention.|`|VkXv4RInaa	yes

I remeber one time I went on a trip too and this guy he took a red pair of briefs and this immature kid got them and told all the other kids (which was like 8) what he had brought.

Don't take chances....take Boxers!!|`|3A7xH3qVaa	Take both  They should be mature enough to not make fun of you for the kind of underwear you wear  but if you only want to take one type, take whatever is the most comfortable to you.|`|uRIPybr0aa	Take both. But wear the boxers and leave the briefs in your bag. Let them see the briefs in your bag and if they don't say anything, just wear them. If they say something, you were not wearing them.

I used to be a brief/boxer brief person. Now I wear boxers all the time, and I wear boxer-briefs when I wear running/basketball-type shorts for support.     So I would take both incase you are in a situation where you may need either one.     Most teen guys wear boxers, though some wear briefs. If you want to avoid any conflict and join the crowd to and boxers don't bother you, take them.    But if you prefer briefs over boxers even though you like boxers, take the briefs.    I say, if you're 50-50 on liking them, I would take BOXERS! But that's ME, it's up to YOU!|`|UDR1a8JGaa	boxers ftw!|`|yL7RKxHFaa	Boxers!!

2sycPf8Daa	1. Atherosclerosis  Arteries are blood vessels that carry oxygen and nutrients from your heart to the rest of your body. Healthy arteries are flexible, strong and elastic. Over time, however, too much pressure in your arteries can make the walls thick and stiff  sometimes restricting blood flow to your organs and tissues. This process is called arteriosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries.  2-Coronary Artery Disease  Your coronary arteries are the major blood vessels that supply your heart with blood, oxygen and nutrients. When these arteries become damaged or diseased  usually due to a buildup of fatty deposits called plaques  it's known as coronary artery disease.   3. Aortic Insufficiency  Aortic valve regurgitation, also known as aortic insufficiency or aortic incompetence, is a condition that occurs when your heart's aortic valve doesn't close tightly. In this condition, some of the blood that was just pumped out of your heart leaks back into it. The leakage of blood may prevent your heart from efficiently pumping blood out to the rest of your body. If your heart isn't working efficiently, you may feel fatigued and short of breath.   4. Congestive Heart Failure  Heart failure, also known as congestive heart failure (CHF), means your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your body's needs. Over time, conditions such as coronary artery disease or high blood pressure gradually leave your heart too weak or stiff to fill and pump efficiently.   5. Valvular Stenosis  Pulmonary valve stenosis is a condition in which the flow of blood from your heart to your lungs is obstructed by a deformed pulmonary valve.   The disorder is usually present at birth. Adults occasionally have pulmonary valve stenosis as a complication of another illness.   Pulmonary valve stenosis ranges from mild and without symptoms to severe and debilitating, with most cases being mild. Mild pulmonary stenosis doesn't usually worsen over time, but moderate and severe cases may progress and require surgery. Fortunately, treatment is highly successful, and most people with pulmonary valve stenosis can expect to lead normal lives.     Take care as always!

HHB9LUqiaa	The best way you are going to loose weight is just to eat less calories than you burn - that sounds simple enough but sometimes you may not realize how man calories you are actually taking in - if you dont want to spend money id say the best thing you might can do is keep a food log of everything you eat with calorie content and keep a running total so you know how much you have consumed.  based on your weight id say a good target is about 1400 to 1500 calories max per day as long as you are exercising.  I use the Body Bugg and thats the basic principal i follow - the one thing that you wont have is something telling you how many calories you have actually burned that why i love the body bugg because it tells you that - but it does cost so if you dont want to spend money id say just follow the principal of keep track of what you eat and make sure you work out|`|ZLt8TwOiaa	www.sparkpeople.com|`|rduVctOraa	this looks pretty interesting

T5ZAYYpNaa	Cheese is often avoided by those who are lactose intolerant, but ripened cheeses like Cheddar contain only about 5% of the lactose found in whole milk, and aged cheeses contain almost none.  so you can look into that for substitutes.  no milk, so juices or water as a drink.  no yogurt.  you can always look in the "vegan" sections, since they usually have a soy version of anything that is usually made with milk.|`|V8GrFx0jaa	Same as other kids, but without the cheese or milk.

xzwZ3lt3aa	The reason the kneecap slides out of the groove, is because of a muscle imbalance. Usually the strong outside muscle ( quad ) pulls the kneecap off to the outside. You can go to a physiotherapist and get some exercises to help strengthen the inside muscle. Sometimes the physiotherapist can tape your kneecap in the proper position, and sometimes a simple surgery ( lateral release ) is needed.<br>  By daughter had the surgery when she was 13 or 14, and hasn't had a problem since|`|WOU4u2y1aa	u should get surgery for it and that should help out a lot|`|tpnSRZl9aa	First thing to do is see your Family doctor or i would highly recommend a doctor in sports medicine. <br>  <br>  What i think you have is called patella subluxation<br>  <a href="http://orthopedics.about.com/cs/patelladisorders/a/kneecapdisloc.htm" rel="nofollow">http://orthopedics.about.com/cs/patellad...</a><br>  <br>  I would highly recommend a Knee brace called a Patella Stabilization Brace, or a PTO (patella tracking orthosis).

lzQgxLg2aa	Dear wamp<br>  <br>  A panic attack is a sudden surge of overwhelming anxiety and fear. Your heart pounds and you can’t breathe. You feel dizzy and sick to your stomach.  But panic is treatable – and the sooner you seek help, the better. With treatment, you can reduce or eliminate the symptoms of panic and regain control of your life<br>  <br>  Whilst drug therapy is valid for most medical conditions, when used as a treatment for anxiety conditions, like panic attacks, it couldn't be more misplaced. <br>  The most highly recommended product for anxiety and panic attack can be found at<br>  <a href="http://tinylink.com/?hbE1uPN9RA" rel="nofollow">http://tinylink.com/?hbE1uPN9RA</a> ,  treat your attack and start living today.|`|hh9IdFlxaa	Panic attacks are characterized by unexpected and repeated episodes of intense fear accompanied by physical symptoms that may include chest pain, heart palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, or abdominal distress. <br>  <br>  Whilst drug therapy is valid for most medical conditions, when used as a treatment for anxiety conditions, like panic attacks, it couldn't be more misplaced. <br>  <br>  The most highly recommended product for anxiety and panic attack can be found at<br>  <a href="http://tinylink.com/?hbE1uPN9RA" rel="nofollow">http://tinylink.com/?hbE1uPN9RA</a> ,  treat your attack and start living today.|`|0c50732f76641f6a048f51ae5fab416daa	I have what is called "Panic Attacks" but not quite a feeling of "panic" or fear, it does feel like you've been shot and can't breathe. it lasts sometimes for a minute or several minutes. It leaves as fast as it comes on and when it's happening there is nothing you can do about it. I think that is where the word panic is thrown in, because you feel helpless of whats happening to you and its scary because you feel as though you are having a heart attack. If you've had your heart checked by a doctor or specialist and you checked out fine, you may want to re-evaluate the panic attack symptoms and see whats available out there for treatment. Best of luck!

Cranberry juice (ALOT) or cranberry pills can help to clear it up, otherwise if its too far your'll have to have antibyotics.<br>  I had it nand thought it would go away but it didn't and I ended up trying cranberry pills, didnt work. I left it too long to go to the doctors for oral anitbyotics and then one evening I had terrible pain in my kidneys and the UTI had spread to my kidneys making it a kidney infection. I had to go to hospital for a few days to have a drip with antibiotics. <br>  My advice its LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS of water, cranberry juice or cranberry pills, painkillers asswell. It might clear up, if not, go to your doctor ok x good luck|`|hZWup7xXaa	yes i think it is a uti. going to the doctors is the best thing to do but if you really dont want to get your self some cranberry juice and drink as much as you possibly can.try to drink at least one cup of cranberry juice a day, it really helps to prevent uti's from happening again i doubt its from masturbating hun. and going from the anus to vagina is a very bad idea, this can cause yeast infections or even worse infection hun. hope this help :)|`|3Ks21ASDaa	yeah go to the gyno. never go from anus to urethra or vagina. bad bad bad. you can be rough and not hurt yourself while doing so. put some hydrocortizone cream down there for now. drink some cranberry juice. it helps tremendously with bacteria in the urethra and helps cure a UTI. good luck!|`|Ieslv5JJaa	It is most definitely a UTI! When you do pee after sex (in your case masturbation) your not cleaning what ever germs your sending up there. They stay there, and create an infection known as a bladder infection/UTI. You can also get them from holding your pee too long! Some people get them a lot, whereas a lot of people will NEVER experience them no matter what. I get them from using tampons, every month! When I feel one coming I just take an alka-seltzer and have a nap, clears it right up!<br>  <br>  In your case though, since you've gotten to the bleeding, you've probably had if for at least 4 days? Get toa doctor right away. It could cause a kidney infection!<br>  <br>  Best of luck|`|IgdJG3yGaa	STD<br>  Water infection<br>  One of the two...
R02vAa48aa	I weigh myself before a workout. I drink a lot of water and I tend to weigh a little more right after I work out so if you're trying to weigh in at your lowest then I would say weigh yourself in the morning before you work out.|`|ZLt8TwOiaa	Depending on how close to your weigh in, yes when you workout you  sweat losing water weight, although it is a temporary weight loss you will weigh less on the scale. If it is sometime after your workout you weigh in then no, you have replaced the fluids the you lost sweating. The important thing is to weigh in the same time of day for an accurate weight loss. A person body can fluctuate several pound throughout the day.

The lumps can be any size.<br>  <br>  I don't agree with the two week rule above.  Mine happened very fast and was aggressive.  And I am young statistically too. I got it checked the next day and they fast tracked me through the diagnostic process and am now in treatment.  Any delay for me would have been very bad.  Though most breast lumps are benign and most cancers can wait the two weeks, mine couldn't.  I had all the routine screening, did all the right things and it still happened very quickly. I am glad I didn't wait.|`|6cwJi5kxaa	It can hurt yes. But the chances of it hurting and turning out to be cancer is not high. If you found a lump you should definately go see either your primary doctor, ob/gyn or general surgeon. Depending on your age they will probably send you for an ultrasound first. They also need to do a physical exam. But just remember to take one step at a time. Just see the doctor and then go from there.|`|AA10352420	Most cancers in the body are silent growths They cause little or no pain and by the time it is painful then some times it is too late to do any curative treatment as it might have spread to other areas.

The early the detection the better prognosis for the patient and probably will give the best treatment, which is the local excision of the tumor. The tumors from the breast are classified as benign and malignant. The most frequent benign tumor is the fibrocystic breast disease. Any breast mass or change detected during physical exam should trigger a response with breast biopsy or specialized evaluation including studies( mammogram, Ultrasound) depending upon MD decision. Always ask your MD.|`|GKOVehLKaa	Get to your doctor ASAP.<br>  <br>  1) you can still have a blocked duct even though it has been 4 years<br>  2) breast cancer lumps can be painful however some are not....depends on where it is, size etc.<br>  3) breast cancer does not discriminate on age or family history<br>  4) This is not to scare you at all, just information - 70% of breast cancers are not family related<br>  You are young and living with the fear of the unknown is no way to live.

Diabetes is not contagious.|`|pRF5LLloaa	No./    Family Guy is funny, but it is funny because it is SOOOO WRONG in so many areas.    This is one of them.    You CAN however, get OTHER diseases especially AIDS, from drinking blood.  Hepatitis, too, I think.
dfcCoGwRaa	Absolutely, not all calories are created equal.  Whether you get your calories from carbohydrates, fat, or protein makes a big difference.  The calories in ice cream are primarily from refined carbohydrates, which are horrible for you and impede fat loss by increasing insulin secretion, which is a storage hormone that stores glycogen (excess sugar from carbohydrates) as fat in the adipose (fat) tissue. On the other hand, the carbohydrates in the apple, providing it is organic and bought from a health food store, not a typical supermarket, are natural, and the fiber in the apple will help excrete wastes, which will aid in weight loss.|`|e9WIWHGQaa	NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO...  OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO...|`|70MRFokCaa	caliroes gain fait and apple have netriouns and etc|`|y2ZLVTPGaa	not really , ultimately your weight gain/loss is dependant upon whether you have a calorie deficit or surplus at the end of the day.  however, hte ice cream has minimal nutritional value (vitamins, nutrients, etc) and so your body will be left lacking some of  that if you eat ice cream instead of a daily serving of fruit regularly.  not to mention, it would make more sense to have 1 apple (4 is a lot) and a smaller 150 calorie portion of ice cream!!|`|nN8D64Yzaa	yes, certain foods are helpful for your metabolism. i know you're aware that ice cream is not the same as apples, but in truth it's the nature of the calories in the apples that help you lose weight and stay healthy. eating sugar and fats all day will tire you out and eventually make you hungrier, while high fiber and nutritious foods of the same caloric value will keep you full and rev up your metabolism while keeping your body happy and healthy (think bright, clear skin, healthy muscles and a healthy heart...you definitely want to go with the apple!)|`|9ZgvC2quaa	Hi Sara,    Whilst overall calorie intake (and creating a calorie deficit) is the most important factor when losing weight, the composition of the food is also worthwhile considering.     Food composition is important because is affects how your body utilises and stores the nutrients from the food you eat. For argument's sake let consider ice cream to be just a concentrated source of fat and carbs. Of course, it is easy for your body to store the fat from the ice cream and the carbs may be used to replenish glycogen stores, maintain blood glucose or be stored as fat.     For more info on this check out an article I wrote called, 'Calories in Food' on my website.     GI is not a factor because the fat slows down the absorption rate of the carbs.    However, the other factor to consider is this: how easy is it to eat more than 1 scoop of ice cream and how difficult is it to eat 4 apples?    It is similar to having a glass of fruit juice and eating 8 oranges.    There are also so many healthy nutrients in apples compared to ice cream.     So, the answer to your question is 'YES' it does make a difference.     I hope this helps.    Regards,    Steve.|`|c3zCdjBiaa	the only thing thats different is that the apple has good things in it antioxidants, fiber, vitamins where and ice cream does not,  the ice cream is also harder to digest and has Fat
jddxzWp8aa	well it might hurt a little bit for the girl but the guys nope not at all|`|om56VY6yaa	if ur a guy then NO.    if ur a girl, i think it does hurt cos of the first time use but im not sure tho.|`|7Sk7c4IAaa	lol good question but the answer is no and since your a virgin your first time will be VERY pleasurable cause you never tried it lol good luck.
JyvG8dFcaa	call your doctor and ask !!!!!  sounds serious
0H8prIJCaa	Hi stranger,    a) No, as both two people are HIV negative then the virus cannot spread further than it already has.    b) If you lick the blood of someone with AIDS you would need to have some kind of small wound or cut inside the mouth for it to transfer. However, if you swallow a certain amount of the persons blood (let's say 15mm) then the virus can be absorbed in the stomach and into the blood stream.|`|qX0KdYUjaa	Are you a vampire?|`|K60MPna1aa	For the first question: No. Definitely no.     HIV is not created out of thin air by two people just having sex. One of the parties has to have it for it to be passed on.
80boEgoEaa	I think your in shape. You're probably not gaining weight because you have a high metabolism from all your exercises and healthy eating. If you do want to gain weight, eat food with high calories, fat, or protein. Which you would not want to do, because some food with high calories, fat, or protein are unhealthy. So there's nothing wrong with you.|`|GEyJMsaKaa	You don't need to see a doctor. You are at a healthy weight. You just have a fast metabolism.Some people are like that. You just need to eat a lot more protein in each meal.Also,try to include some weights in your workout.    Good luck and God bless!!
QkBJeSyeaa	a CT of what is the first question you need to answer|`|mAp90hEeaa	The other question is correct.  Every facility charges different amounts for a CT scan and it depends on how large an area of the body that is being scanned and whether there is dye injected or not.  There is no way to answer this question.
P9hRxZTyaa	the so-called ''white'' pubes are only translucent hairs that are not colored.   i have had them from time to time and i have described them as white. and i have noticed them on patients from time to time as well. they are not particularly noticeable, and i would tell him to pluck them if they are such a problem.     i don't know about the dots, but there can be places that are darker in pigmentation than in others especially in the groin area.  it's important that they are not growing in area, if the area gets bigger you may want to head for the doctor.    good luck|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	Sounds like a trip to the doctor might be in order on this one.|`|Q5qpMLOVaa	Could be vitiligo(sp?), which is basically the loss of pigmentation, and causes hair in that area to become white.    There isn't really any cure, but it isn't dangerous or like threatening.|`|rsAqrbsgaa	disease    Why don't you look yourself?  it's just your son.|`|TPn3CEK0aa	Probably acne, and puberty.    OHHH he has a ways to go|`|o1wIz3VVaa	Hopefully it is normal... but to be on the safe side take him to see a doctor... better safe than sorry... if he has concerns with others knowing about the issue, check with your insurance carrier to find a doctor away from town.... privacy can also be important with teenagers and an issue such as this one...    Thanks and God Bless,  Michelle|`|4MtR8MLpaa	the white hair could be premature gray hair, my nephew had that.|`|CEI3o31Eaa	Uh..maybe you should take him to a doctor|`|LaUouVtfaa	uhh why yahoo answers?  ask a doctor.|`|N2O9rJvUaa	nothing weird... its just non developed hair|`|lTOeMNnraa	i think i heard some disease like that before when i was watching this show teenage body's. from what i remember it can make you infertile. but who knows i could be wrong,it could just be undevloped pubic hair.|`|6MHuI3NXaa	ehk.  i would take him to a doctor  if were you, hes not gonna like that  though, but it needs to be done if you think  it might be a disease.  cause trust me, i dont mean to be rude but  im 15 and if i knew a guy had this i wouldnt even  kiss him.... no offense but get him checked out.|`|NoGmacqNaa	i think that u should ask a doctor if your concerned? bu ti think that it is just puberty it just pay be the color of his i wouldnt b concerned i think he will b ok|`|uzGIdiFdaa	well even as an adult the pubic hair on the scrotum is very fine and has almost no pigment. The dots could be a cist, or a papule, which is very normal in that area, they may not look pretty, but it's all apart of growing up. If it really concerns you enough then take him to a doctor|`|rnZoebKQaa	i had white pubes on my scrotum one nite...after i screwed an old lady|`|lMzWMxz7aa	maybe he did it how old is he!|`|AzrARnZBaa	it might just be puberty check it out alone with him only if he lets you so the next time he tells you about it ask him if you could take a look at it and then maybe ask him if it hurts him and let him tell you the truth ok so take a good look at it and see if there is anything strange going on like can he pee the right way or something like that|`|kKU5xhdtaa	its this rare disease called amcetonvia synd. u can die in mithin 3 years. u can spray vodka or any other high alcohol on it.  do it immediatly
tluT02tvaa	Your talking about the "master cleanse".Just google that and you can find the recipe.But let me tell you..its one hell of a hard diet to follow.Its also very unhealthy,and is only good for temporary weightloss.  Beyonce used that to fit into her "dream girls" costume.  Its very hard on your body,i hear you need to devote 2 to 3 hours a day..just using the bathroom.Its like a mega laxative..and sorta has anorexic tendencies,be prepared,better yet,don't do it.|`|y2ZLVTPGaa	this is not healthy, end of story
afsanqjPaa	LOL you will definitely keep growing till about 17-18years old, This is great, you can be a model :D|`|S1jddreQaa	you'll probably end up anywhere between 170-180cm|`|9nYifIn4aa	There is a very good possibility that you will be about 170+ cm.  It is in your genes!

I think he's trying to throw you a signal, but just isn't sure of how to do it DISCREETLY. You and him may both be virgins, and that's what it seems......of course people have sex in school, I almost did......    But I would definitely stay away from that, you can be expelled from school, and when your parents find out, it's not gonna be nice!!|`|1HeW6F6qaa	Kick him in the face and ask him if he feels anything.|`|WLShLi04aa	lol in schools a stupid place........... you could give him a quickie  but honestly, if you think "sex" is so bad that you cant even type it out, just worry about something else, because obviousley you're not ready considering mentally or you're just too young|`|claW4UUcaa	if you don't like the attention your getting. tell him to stop it and if he does it again. ask to go to the office. tell them. even if you do like the attention he needs to stop. school isn't the place to be fooling around. you also need to think about your reputation.|`|zkS9MhFxaa	dear god, please don't do it! save yourself for the right one! lol|`|UIbZOOBIaa	AHHAHA guys suck!!

rpnFxnCQaa	Collard greens are widely considered to be healthy foods, collards are good sources of vitamin C and soluble fiber and contain multiple nutrients with potent anti-cancer properties, such as diindolylmethane and sulforaphane (Wikipedia). Now, keep in mind that anything is to be eaten with moderation! That being said, one never eats enough vegetables.
VL4Srqinaa	drink lots of water
7f222aac2ff9b3cf155ecfc961dfc183aa	they dont go away unless you have surgery however if you have pain caused by it that can go away with things such as ice, rest, and wearing shoes with a wider toe box. There is also injections and inserts that you could use to help with pain. I would only seek how surgical correction if necessary and you have tired EVERYthing thing else. Ask your doctor.
F15Kfifzaa	no you can have it done at the age of 7months old if you want  lol  you dont have to be over 16 xx|`|7576ccf58b0f0d06d5465ee6303c37b2aa	It depends on where you live.  This state the age requirement without an adult is 18.|`|XGFiIY9Eaa	nope. you just need to have your parents sign the form.|`|kL9tqt1Eaa	there is no age limit though i'm pretty sure you do need to have a parents concern though to get your belly button pierced you need to be over 16.    It's a piercing I had done when I was 14 the only thing that would make them wary to pierce is if you have a medical condition and it may require a letter from your doctor to say it is alright for you to have the piercing done.    Also they may still pierce regardless of age but could be wary if you are really young as it is cartilagee.    hope this helped a bit
xxq5JAM6aa	Morphine and codeine are the most common medical derivative of poppy latex. Heroin is a synthetic derivative of these two.    Any respiratory depression would go away when the opiate is eliminated by the body.|`|IzHfbWtiaa	Opiates are dangerous drugs which are well enough left alone as they can make a person anxious,depressed and even suicidal and can also cause death! Bottom line,get off them now! If need be,go into a rehab program! Best Wishes and God Bless!|`|nTgCxOufaa	Just because the "intoxication" is gone, doesn't mean that the opiate is out of your system and /or its effects have worn off.      It really depends on what opiates you used, how much of it, and the route of entry into your body. It's hard to say without more information, but you can find out the half-life for each opiate readily online.  This number tells you how long it takes your body to clear HALF of the amount that you took. After another half-life, another half of the drug has been cleared, so after 2 half lives, you still have 1/4 of the original amount in your body. etc.     If you are still having problems days after using prescription painkillers or any other opiates where you feel difficulty breathing, then call a doctor (or go to an ER) immediately for evaluation, as the problem could be something else such as infection, penumonia, etc.
xYTagSIyaa	All that you are describing are typical signs of constipation.  It sounds like you are still having movements but it is abnormal.    You need to increase your water intake a minimum of 8 cups a day, and increase your fiber intake to 30-50grams , and exercise (at least 30 minutes daily).  If you are having no movements you need take nothing internally and should go to the emergency dept. of your hospital.  It is possible to get blocked and this could be a medical emergency.  If you are passing gas from your bottom, it is a good sign,  if you can feel abdominal movement or hear sounds in your abdomen it is a good sign.  If you have normal constipation you could take a mild laxative, but I can't recommend that because I don't know if things are normal with you or not, because I don't have enough information.  If you take a laxative and you have a blockage it is an emergency so do not try that unless you are sure you don't have a blockage.  You could try a  glycerin suppository or an enema.|`|C2M2StR1aa	Drink lots of water, eat foods high in fiber (fruits, veggies, oatmeal) and eliminate processed foods and sugar.      I have one trick that I tell my clients about that works very well.  Jumping on a mini-trampoline or rebounder will help with constipation.  I have posted a page on constipation at my website below.    Chronic constipation can be an indication of health problems to come.  It is wise to work on eliminating :) it.    Good luck and good health.|`|AA10427880	I won't go there because it could be a number of things, but, do you have a strong family history of colorectal cancer, if you do have your doctor do  colonoscopy asap|`|TOdvLQnxaa	The 'rumbling noise' could be gas caused not having lactose to digest the milk sugars in dairy products.  An easy way to tell and get immediate relief would be to take a OTC LAST ASE pill  (is one brand name) with the first bite of any food.  This pill is enzymes about 9,000 enzyme that will help digest the dairy food.  A lot of people 'loose' the lactose in their body, even children.  You can verify this information at any medical website by reading about lactose.  I do not think you should ever let yourself stay constipated, many things even an apple or apple juice will keep you normal. Good Luck!|`|NRQXmIcwaa	maybe it's something you're eating.
OocDN5evaa	Try eating more veggies and fruits. Eating yogurt and beans would help too. I had similar problems, but since becoming a vegetarian, I've never been constipated. You might still have gas, but it won't be the type of gas you have now that just sits in your body. So eat more fruits and veggies - you'll be cleaning your insides out and your body will thank you!|`|bXl12I4Baa	I have the same problem sometimes I sit in the toilet for half an hour to 45 minutes and nothing comes out. is very painful and I do not like it at all .is something that  my doctor tall  me  , and I do every time I need  it. Put a surgical glove on, and use you index finger and dipping in Vaseline then you use you index finger at you but, and crease all around the wall .I do it and it does help. You may try it and see. Sorry I know the feeling. Also change your diet eat more vegetables and salads and drink   a lot of water.

It's important if you take any kind of medication or if you drink a lot of beverages with alcohol or caffeine. Some vitamins, especially ones with iron in them, will constipate you.

Try increasing your intake of water, increase your fiber (get some Bran ... in the cereal aisle ... and mix it into yoghurt, get some Raising Bran or Bran Muffins), and get a stool softener. If that does not help, then you need to get to the doctor before trying anything more drastic ... Fleet's Enema, etc.|`|bQ4RAi07aa	Gas is usually not painful unless you are also constipated, with pockets of gas stretching your colon where it is trapped by hard stool. The contents of your intestines are liquid until they reach your colon, where water is absorbed and stool is formed. If you don't drink enough fluid or eat enough fiber, the stool rapidly turns into hard stones. Try avoiding all foods made with flour, eating lots of fruit, vegetables and whole grains, and drinking plenty of water. If this does not correct the problem, check with your doctor. Constant use of laxatives can deprive you of essential nutrients.|`|gpBicBEPaa	EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW...|`|vk6sczbLaa	You need to make sure there is enough fiber in your diet, and that you're staying well hydrated.

Its what they usually give before surgery.
vEsSIGfYaa	I lived most of my life with symptoms you describe.  It was never diagnosed any better than the standard doctor's answer when they don't know what's going on ---- "Must be nerves, get used to it, live with it."  Eventually, over some 40 years, and with age the problem slowly dwindled away.    From my reading over the years, I'm convinced it was what today is called Irritable Bowel Syndrome.    You need to SEE A DOCTOR AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  Rapid, distinct changes in intestinal and bowl habits can be indicative of possibly very serious health issues.  See a doctor NOW.    In the meantime, to relieve some of the gas accumulation, try one or both of the following:    1.  Kneel on your bed, with your head and shoulders down on the bed surface for several minutes until the gas has worked its way "up" through your intestine.  2.  Or, lay on your left side for a few minutes, then rotate to your stomach for a minute or two.  Then rotate to your right side for a few minutes.  Due to the spiral nature of the bowel, this will tend to "work" the gas through the intestine.    One or a combination of both of these two techniques have worked successfully for me for many years.|`|eMDnLUpqaa	Try Some Fiber supplements and stool relaxers (easy on the stool relaxer though) to stimulate your bowels.

Eliminating processed foods and sugar is also helpful.      I have one trick that I tell my clients about that works very well.  Jumping on a mini-trampoline or rebounder will help with constipation.|`|mZprL9TJaa	what you need to do is try a couple of medications that are over-the-counter. You should be able to get them at any pharmacy or somewhere like walmart. The first thing you need is to take a stool softener such as Colace 100mg capsules. Take one of those in the morning and one in the evening with plenty of water or liquids through the day. The second thing you should try along with the stool softenter is a laxative called MiraLax...it comes in different size bottles and it is a powder but it has no taste you just mix 17 grams of miralax which should be one capful into 8 ounces of liquid. take that once a day and you can mix it into any liquid. Some liquids i've used are tea and gatorade but you can use whatever. I'm a nurse and the doctor I work for prescribes this to his patients with constipation and this works very well for most patients. If this doesnt work for you they have presciption medications you could talk to your doctor about such as Amitiza. Keep drinking plenty of fluids and put more fiber in your diet. Hope this helps!|`|UnSTw2Zeaa	I was also thiking irritable bowel syndrome. I would go to the ER now to make sure you do not have a blockage. Both of them could cause serious problems, but a blockage is more immediate. I had similar symptoms, and mine was a blockage. Although I had a fever as well, but that's not always the case. Have someone massage your back up and down to see if they can get things moving. Then let them do your stomach. This will give you temporary relief, but please seek medical attention. Now!!!
Su0O55W8aa	In order to know if someone has strep throat you have to do a throat culture or rapid strep test.  Usually with strep throat you have bad breath and ulcers on your throat.  You will ache and have fevers too!  I had them at least once every month almost when I was little for years and finally had my tonsils removed and haven't had strep throat in over 10 years!  You can even have some neck aches too!|`|bPd1RsxDaa	He probably just has a cold.  Then again, it may be flu.  With the flu, your throat doesn't always hurt, but you do not feel well at all.  With strep throat, on the otherhand, your throat will be red, sore, and possibly have "pus pockets" on your tonsils.  If you see a white spot on either of his tonsils, he probably has strep.  Sorry he's so sick, hope he gets well soon :)
5CcHOXdKaa	Ive had mine out and my surgeon told me that the swelling should only last as long as a week or two at most and if not I needed to let him know right away. So I'd say something has gone very wrong with your healing if wisdom teeth are the cause. it also seems like the gums should have healed over by now. The holes in mine were healed in about a week.|`|s4k29qKPaa	No. My brother had his wisdom teeth pulled out, and the swelling was only after surgery.
AA11522944	Have you ever heard people 'crack' their knuckles?  It sounds like they are breaking bone or cartilage doesn't it?    In fact the 'popping' sounds you hear is air bubbles being forced out of the joint and that is likely to be what you are hearing also.  It is harmless.    If you have any joint pain or restricted movement see a doctor.  Otherwise it is unlikely to be anything harmful.|`|QLZQtUH4aa	Well here is what I say as long as it doesn't really hurt you and you don't feel any pain go ahead and continue. The guy talking about cracking knuckles has a good point.
XEEcC7Jbaa	They definitely sound like migraines.  Keep in mind that migraines are a symptom, not a diagnosis, so make sure you see a specialist about this.  You may want to get a CT scan.  It sounds like it could be retino blastoma, but I am not a doctor, just a Pre-Med student, and the chances of it actually being retino blastoma is very slim, so do not panic.  The most important thing is that you get medical help from doctors who will listen.|`|ksxlW3HQaa	There are doctors who specialize in headaches.  You need to find one a go to him.|`|F08HDRvraa	Have you thought about going to a chiropractor?  I have had headaches since I was a teenager, sometimes so bad I was nauseous with pain that ran through my neck and over the top of my head.  When I was pregnant with my daughter, I suffered a fall on some ice and for weeks had severe back pain in addition to the headaches, although the doctor said nothing was wrong.  A friend referred me to her chiropractor after my daughter was born.  At that time I not only had back pain, but the head aches made it almost impossible to care for my baby.  The doctor diagnosed several slipped discs in my spine and I went through a series of daily adjustments for about a month.  Not only did my back pain stop, the headaches went away completely.  I have sworn by them ever since.  Like regular doctors, they are not all the same, so try to talk to people you know to see if they have one they like and give it a try.|`|AA10590038	Get another opinion.

This is what you should do:    1. Take a piece of paper.  2. Write down all the worries that have been disturbing you for the past couple of years - it could be abuse, hurt and so on.  3. Ensure that you deal with those worries in a positive way and that they don't worry you anymore.  4. Finally, get back to doing what you love the best.

jNKXqoJUaa	I agree, eat yogurt and talk to your doctor or pharmacist.  Don't use mouth rinse.|`|eMDnLUpqaa	Thrush is a type of yeast infection. You have to talk to your doctor and get the appropriate medication. In the mean time avoid anything that may aggrivate it and eat yogurt.|`|fjHpA5oiaa	Thrush is when the yeast that lives normally in your body multiply too much and overwhelm you, maybe from too much sugar (yeast feeds on it) or antibiotics (that kill its balancing counterparts) or beer (lots of yeast) or something else. Call 411 and ask for a health store somewhere nearby. Get the address, go to the health store, find the refrigerated section, and locate acidophilus. It's probably in a brown bottle. Acidophilus is like the juice that you see floating on top of plain yogurt and tastes kind of like yogurt, but stronger. It is full of little good bacteria, some cultures that your body lost, so now you will replace them. Their absence is what let the yeast take over in your mouth. Acidophilus is potent at first. I think it's yummy, but you might need to get used to the taste. It could cost you ten or fifteen dollars, depending on your health food store. Drink maybe a tablespoon 4 times a day every day for like five days. But if you get thrush or yeast infections often, following up with a tablespoon once a day for a month won't hurt. Also along the same line of good-bacteria reasoning are "probiotics", other good bacteria that acidophilus doesn't have. If you buy, it should be in the refrigerated section as well. Pill forms exist of acidophilus and probiotics, often cheaper, but I don't trust them. You get what you pay for if you buy the cold liquid. The cultures are alive and could have died in the pill bottle if they were exposed to heat, so if the company cares enough to refrigerate it, you know you're not wasting money and time. In my life as a lady and raising 5 children, I find this remedy will far outdo (plus be more comfortable than) anything you can buy in a box at the pharmacy or get from a doctor for yeast related problems. Good luck! Feel better! And try not to get on antibiotics unless you absolutely have too. Those things are raunchy!
ue7sKvLOaa	No, if it hurts don't do it    Stiff necks are caused by sudden neck movements or jerks or by bad posture or sleeping position.    Try taking a hot water bag and placing it on your neck once every hour, and try a pain reliever.  Also, if someone is available, try having them give you a neck massage.        If it gets unbearable, see a doctor|`|H0aiDO9Paa	With fever and headache, there is a possibility of meningitis may cause intense spasms of the neck muscles and make the neck very stiff. More commonly, though, neck pain is part of a flu syndrome that includes fever, muscle aches and a headache. When generalized aching throughout the muscles is present, a visit to a doctor is seldom useful.  When a stiff neck is due to one of the more common causes of muscle spasm, the sufferer can usually touch the chin to the chest, though perhaps with difficulty. If in doubt, it is better to see the doctor for an ordinary muscle spasm than to attempt to treat meningitis at home. And good luck.

WCPqMcFNaa	Hey I heard that too. I don't know why exactly. Whats the hurry? I you lead a pretty healthy life and whats important. Besides swimming and fencing do get the muscles working. just stick with it and you will see the result unless you do already. All I'm saying wait abit nothing is gonna happen if you do, it's just not a good idea to do something bad to your body while you've clearly been taking care off.|`|OOzadIJFaa	im jealous of now and as long as you arent underweight and have enough body fat your fine|`|B3Cd58ehaa	Im 15 and I learned from my teachers that you shouldnt work on getting abs or whatever till your at least 14, Im not sure about this you should talk to a different person then me about it. I started getting abs around several monthes ago...|`|Uu8iCur8aa	Im 12 :)|`|5pszijaDaa	a six pack just means you have so little fat over your abs that you can clearly see the muscles. its fine for a kid to have them as long as they maintain a healthy body weight and fat percentage too. to have your ab muscles show more work them out so that they get bigger and stronger (try sit ups and the like).
DDkkwPcPaa	Hi,    Firstly consider that the panic attacks are temporary and will go, do not worry about them, treat them with the respect that they deserve, that they exactly that temporary! Be positive about this as this may help to get you through.    Minds try and shut down when things are getting too complicated for us to deal with problems or emotions, this is a natural thing that you are experiencing, people see this as a negative, but really is a positive although you may not think this.    Secondly your agoraphobia, you are beating it! well done, as you are going back to uni, don't worry about what people think, this is a part of you at the moment, and if people can not accept that then they should grow up! It will all go away eventually and you will look back and think what was all the fuss about as we all do!    Keep going to uni, nobody with an ounce of decency would think of you as a freak of weirdo, if they did then they have no place in the adult world!    Be as positive as you can    Hope this Helps and hope all goes well at uni for you    regards    nick G|`|WXExyAlWaa	I think you should tell your teacher. Tell them that you really want to do well but you have anxiety problems and might need some understanding or extra help if you can't make it to class. See if the counselor (when you get to see them) has any ideas that could help you deal with your schoolwork.

5gG2OfHIaa	There was a debate about fluoride in toothpaste and drinking water in the 1950s and 60s.  Those opposed to fluoride maintained that its toxic qualities were more harmful than its benefits.  If you know someone in their 70s ask if they have  any cavities.   Usually that age group does.  Ask a teenager, who as grown up with fluoride, about tooth cavities. The teenager is likely to have none or few when compared to the 70 year plus population who did not have fluoride in the drinking water or toothpaste during their youth.  Your question tweaked my memory on this topic.  It was a rather hot political debate at one point in time.|`|YBcB0732aa	Training toothpaste for kids has no fluoride like, Orajel Toddler Training Toothpaste.|`|AA10038340	You can find toothpaste without fluoride. I believe Toms of Maine has no fluoride.

gzERnclQaa	The high blood pressure and lightheadedness is most likely just stress/anxiety over trying the tampon.  It is very possible that you may have tore your hymen (popped your cherry) as you inserted the tampon.  That is normal, depending on your body size.|`|aMHIA7XMaa	1. It might have been.  2. No, you should not use tampons again if this is what happens to you.|`|gLxEoauxaa	What is cherry pop ?|`|lHCZUPm2aa	You need to consult your gynecologist.|`|Omd9Zs5jaa	The high blood pressure and dizziness is all in your head. You are basically freaking your self out. When you put in a tampon RELAX. If your not relaxed them when you do put it in it will hurt and feel uncomfortable. You did not pop your cherry ( I hate that saying) your period can change flow through out the day and if the tampon was no in right or left in to long you will bleed alot when it is taken out. When you put it in make sure that you push it all the way in so only the string is hanging out.  I think you should try it again ... this time just relax and don't worry about TSS.    Oh the symptoms of TSS are  high fever (greater than 102 Fahrenheit [38.8 Celsius])   rapid drop in blood pressure (with lightheadedness or fainting)   sunburn-like rash on the entire body   vomiting and diarrhea   severe muscle aches or weakness   bright red coloring of the eyes, throat, and vagina   headache, confusion, disorientation, or seizures   kidney and other organ failure       *** Just letting you know that the high blood pressure has nothing to do with TTS and everything to do with anxiety.|`|pDkJeELFaa	It might have, you should probably go see the gynecologist and you shouldn't try tampons again until you see him or her.

GDkmWCbSaa	it is truely up to you mate.. If you do not know yet, do not worry.  go to a community college near you and complete all of the Gen. Ed. classes you can, and during that time, try and figure out what YOU want to do (that is yours, and your choice only).  Pick a field you would really enjoy doing.  a field you would like to do for the rest of your life and not have to regret it years down the line.     going into the medical field is good for money, but if your heart is not into that, you will not be happy doing it and you will be miserable.  if you dont want to do it the rest of your life, it is not worth it.        al lin all, my suggestion, go to a community college (it saves ALOT of money) and complete all of your General Education courses (such as math, science, literature, statistics, etc.  the works)and during that time, think of what you want to do.|`|AEAxZEveaa	I don't think it is worth the stress. I'm not a doc, but I'm a nurse and I see what doc's do. They make a lot of money, but they have a lot riding on them it's a very stressful field. Personally, I would avoid the health field altogether, but that's just me. I would put off the decision for now. Don't declare a major yet, do some job shadowing and ask people what they like and don't like about their jobs. It's hard to know at such a young age what you want to do with the rest of your  life.

3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	I think you are moving into true mania, perhaps induced by the antidepressants. I've only ever had hypomania before, except when I was on antidepressants without a mood stabilizer. I TRASHED my life when I did that (it wasn't my fault, I was misdiagnosed with depression, knew nothing about bipolar, and doc continued to increase the antidepressant that was causing the problem)    Most mood stabilizers do not make most people feel like a zombie.  If a mood stabilizer does that, you decrease the dosage, or switch to another one.    Taking an antidepressant without a mood stabilizer is a mistake if you have bipolar. It can make your bipolar worse for the rest of your life, many bipolar researchers believe.    I suggest you go into urgent care and get a lithium prescription RIGHT AWAY.  Lithium will get you back to earth in a hurry.|`|gkqmrIAGaa	You have to have an antipsychotic medication you are suffering with the manic phase of BiPolar.  I have taken them for years and can tell you that the right one and the right dosage has no affect on you other than to prevent highs. You cannot continue with this it can become dangerous for you.  please get help.|`|xUcjzYPdaa	It sounds like you're becoming delusional. PLEASE speak to your doctor or therapist.    Antidepressants can induce mania (sometimes even in people who don't have bipolar disorder). If you have bipolar and are taking antidepressants without something to counter their mania-inducing effects then you are at serious risk of becoming manic.    Mood stabilisers, when prescribed at the level which is best for you, do not make you feel like a zombie. They make you feel normal, and okay.    And don't kid yourself about hypomania - it can be destructive.    Speak to somebody, now.

Best Wishes and Lord Bless!|`|2flYH6ogaa	I had whooping cough when I was a teenager and what you have is NOT whooping cough. Whooping cough is where you cannot stop coughing for so long that when you do finally stop, you breathe in with this really sharp sound (which is where it gets its name). When I had it, I would repeatedly cough for so long at a stretch that I'd throw up. It happened over and over. As soon as I started to cough, I would head for the sink or grab a pail, since it is impossible to stop once you start. I coughed so hard when I had it that I broke my ribs and seriously bruised my spleen, because your chest literally caves in with the force and extent of the coughing. There is nothing mild or questionable about whooping cough. It is severe and downright brutal and you are just incredibly ill. I nearly died. It took me months to fully recover from it. I still have a small hiatial hernia as a result of having coughed and gagged so hard. It's excrutiating and if you had it, you would know. So don't worry, you do not have whooping cough.|`|e3eed8e1848cf66173578a71330925b5aa	whooping cough or pertusis,has a charecterestic cough but come in episodis attack of coughing that usually end with vomitting and it is usually children diseasemmost,and ull have congested eye and it is limited for 6 wks,so most propably u dobt have whooping cough
WXExyAlWaa	There are different reasons for people to get depressed. It can run in families (three of the five of me and my siblings have suffered from very serious depression, and four of us have been at least on the borderline of some kind of mental illness) but it can also be environmental. If things aren't going so well for her, she might be using the medication and therapy to get through a rough patch.    Even if it is something that she's biologically prone to, there is no way to tell if you will be as well. Quite likely you'll be fine.    You could try to open a line of communication with her, though - it would probably help her to know that you care about her. Try just asking how she's been feeling lately. If you guys can learn to talk to each other then in the future you'll be able to share any worries you have with her more easily, too.|`|TbYQyxM0aa	Depression it very much genetic. My mom is depressed and so are all 3 of her kids, Me, my mom, and brothers all take Celexa and see psychologist. BUT just because your mom has it and it is hereditary doesn't mean you will get it. The chances of you developing depression is just greater because she has it. Many people get depression because of life events, such as divorce, rape or finances. That is not hereditary, and this could possibly be what your mother has. Is your grandmom or grandfather depressed or mentally handicap? Don't worry though, if you do have a problem know that there are many treatments for it. You should talk to your mom about this if you are that concerned. Your mom probably is somewhat embrassed and doesn't want to worry you, but if you let her know that you understand and want to know more about her struggles she may open up. Good Luck

I wouldn't recommend shaving it cause it grows back thicker and more noticeable !|`|6dd9f8d90259c24d923f08e0666b6bcdaa	Only if you're a guy|`|tvWm1e4naa	yes it is bad shaving your arms or legs esp. if you are a lady because when the hair grow back it will be hard like wire. you'll regret it. if your arms are too hairy and really bothering you should consider laser hair removal. otherwise be contented with what you have.|`|fvuEtkROaa	Bad ? No.  Probably unnecessary, though.   It will NOT make the hair grow back thicker, in spite of a common belief.  When it starts to grow back, however, it will be dark because it  hasn't been exposed to sunlight to keep it bleached out, and it will be prickley until it gets longer.  You need to do what makes you most comfortable.|`|GSu34HUqaa	It's not bad, by any means. But you do have to take some precautions. As you shave more and more, the hair gets a little more coarse and darker. You may have noticed that with your legs, underarms, etc. But, to sum the answer up, it's not bad for you.|`|a09dd1c5a64bc210a3271b614cb8987baa	no of course not! you have nothing to worry about at all. :)|`|fOzP3CmWaa	If you want to shave your arms there is nothing wrong with that. You can shave anywhere you want, or not shave anywhere you want. It's all up to you!     Shave away!|`|UuwkPzN6aa	you can pretty much shave anywhere. but I'm sure some will tell you that it may cause coarser looking hair, when it grows back. my wife uses nair, and it works for longer than shaving.|`|jQxFXAdQaa	no one does it, and it looks silly if you do. do not start or you will have to do it every day for the rest of your life. if the hair is light, then why bother?|`|W0S7gQDaaa	yeah it grows thicker hair after you shave and my sister said to pluck because it goes to the root of the hair.
gNM35w7Raa	If  your finger is infected the antibiotic will clear it.  Make sure the bandage isnt too tight it might be causing your pain.  You need to let the medicine work.  Try calming down, take a bath or lay down and just relax your sinuses will take about 2-3 days to clear even on an antibiotic if it is a true sinus infection.  Good Luck.|`|2PGvedOcaa	I think that you need to give your body a chance to heal first.  If you are having a reaction to the antibiotics, then you must stop using them.   I know this sounds trite, but do you eat raw fruits and veggies?

Ls6mvhG9aa	We have all had at least one in our lives  a headache. Sometimes its dull and slight and simply an annoyance. Sometimes it can be so bad that you need to go to the ER for immediate sedation. Why? Ask that question 20 years ago and the answer would depend on the particular type of headache were talking about. We would have guessed that a migraine headache resulted from contraction and dilation of blood vessels running to the brain and that a tension headache was the result of tensed-up muscles. Today we would say that most headaches, if not all, probably originate in the same area of the brain, and this is how they seem to work:  Headaches and Serotonin  Some event, were not sure what, triggers the trigeminal nerve (located in the brain stem, its branches run to your face) which releases a burst of chemicals signaling pain. Usually, these stimulate the a release of serotonin, a substance which counteracts the pain signals. The people who get headaches are those whose serotonin reaction is slow. Two problems that trouble many headache sufferers are depression and sleep disorders which are also serotonin related. Frequently, when people diagnosed with depression begin treatment with medications called selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), the frequency and severity of their headaches disappear. Serotonin, however, does not provide a full explanation of where headaches come from. More research is needed before we will have a complete understanding of the underlying processes. There is a possibility your headaches are an effect of an ailment in another part of your body. If you suffer from headaches regularly you should consult your doctor, who will probably prescribe a battery of tests before making a diagnosis.  Keep a Headache Log  The best way to deal with headaches is to prevent them, and you can do that by identifying and eliminating those things which trigger your headaches. To identify your headache triggers, keep a headache diary. Whenever you feel a headache coming on, record this data:        * Woman listingThe time of onset.      * Where you were.      * What you were doing.      * Who you were with.      * The location of the headache in your head.      * How you were feeling (hot, cold, angry, sad, happy, anxious, hungry, etc.).      * When and what you last ate.      * Any ideas about what you think may have triggered the headache.      * What you did/will do to relieve the pain, and how it worked.      * What medications you were on and the dosage.      * When the headache ended.    Estimate, on a scale of 1-to-10, the amount of pain you felt when the headache was at its worst. From this diary, you should begin to see a pattern. Perhaps a certain type of food, a particular person in your life, or perhaps they occur at the same times every day. Any patterns you find may help you identify the problem. Share your diary with your doctor, who may also be able to discern patterns you cannot and identify the source.  What Types of Things Can Cause a Headache?        * Emotions: Chronic headache sufferers are more prone to stress and anxiety, emotions which seem to reduce immunity to pain.      * Diet: Certain substances such as nitrites, tyramine, MSG, alcohol, caffeine, high doses of vitamins, and lack of water can trigger headaches.      * Medications: Nitroglycerin, drugs for hypertension, blood thinners, ulcer treatments, antiseizure drugs, and oral contraceptives.      * Environmental factors: You may be living or working in a place that exposes you to odors, glare, noise, stress, or other factors that can trigger headaches.        Angry woman  Diet  Sleeping pattern      * Eating and Sleeping Patterns: Missing meals, getting too much or too little sleep.      * Strains: Straining eye, neck, or shoulder muscles.      * Hormones      * Physical exertion    Laugh Your Headache Away    Once you have a better idea of what it is that triggers your headaches, take action. Here are some things that may reduce the number of headaches or even stop them in their tracks: Laugh more. It stimulates the release of serotonin.    Get counseling.    Let family and friends know what triggers you headaches.    Learn how to relax.    Avoid foods that appear to trigger headaches.    Reduce alcohol and coffee consumption.    Women, ask your doctor about magnesium supplements.  Laughing  Relaxing  Exercising    A different type of oral contraceptive may relieve hormone imbalances that can trigger headaches.    Estrogen supplements may relieve menstrual migraines.    Stop smoking.    Maintain regular sleeping and eating habits.    Exercise.    Take regular breaks and do a lot of stretches, especially of your neck muscles.    Ask your company to have an occupational therapist analyze your workspace toward coming up with ways to reduce stressors and strains.

This feels like a tight band around your head with possible ad|`|F6jBrNmuaa	The smart answers is to go to a clinic and buy medicine, and the lazy one is to hit your forehead.|`|1JwBoU7Haa	Tylenol or some other OTC.

You cant target areas to lose fat in. If you want to lose fat, eat less and exercise more. Cut out sugar from your diet. Eat more fiber and whole grains, more veggies, and try to get light or fat free versions of foods. Do cardio for at least 30 minutes a day. If you want to keep it off, you have to make a permanent change to your diet and lifestyle.
UY7AN1vUaa	at that height... you should weigh more than 147 pounds.  If you are trying to gain muscle, it means eating a lot, and if you work out everyday,  then you have to really eat more to be able to gain muscle mass to compensate for the fat that is being burned... if you are under 25 than you have a higher than normal metabolism also.  It isn't just about the calories that you eat, but also what kind of foods you are eating to get those calories.  Consider eating lots of protein, like chicken and drink protein shakes, those are calories that can help you bulk up.  So if you are wanting to get big...you might want to consider taking in more than 2500 calories.|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	It aint gonna happen overnite, Bubba!  Sometimes it takes months to reach your goal.  Commitmentl & dedication & will power needed to succeed.  Have you got it?|`|AA10350894	You need to eat more high protein foods as well as work out if you expect to gain any muscle mass.|`|MT1498npaa	They should, but it takes time.|`|iXWXllhQaa	They will be. For things like this, it takes time.  Lift & eat foods with more protein. Incorperate them into your every day meal, like steak or something.     And on a more serious note, avoid steroids, unless you want to develop breasts and more estrogen as a side effect.|`|Ok3XlTV3aa	If you're trying to gain muscle you have to eat.  Many body builders eat 5-6 meals per day.  2500 calories is a bit low if you're trying to gain weight.  Also try not working out everyday.  5 or 6 days a week is optimum and make sure to rotate through different muscle groups to give the previously worked groups a chance to recover.  When you lift you're tearing muscle fibers and they get bigger and stronger when they heal so you have to give them a chance to heal.  Hope this helps.  By the way do a Google search on Bigger Faster Stronger.  It's a great workout program endorsed by many college sports teams.|`|PuVgZiddaa	well obviously you metabolism is very fast.  If you interest in gaining weight you should increase your protein intake dramatically.  just remember to follow the instructions label on any supplements that you take because for example some people think they can eat huge amounts of protein to gain weight.  but in reality your body can only process 27 grams of protein per hour.  the rest becomes waste.  but there are pills that you can take to make your body process protein faster..  what does your work out consist of. (should be heavy weight until muscle failure) remember protein is key soy or weigh is good and remember to eat protein before and after eat work out.  good luck.  i am 6' 2" and 178.  i have gained 30 pounds in 5 months of muscle    GOOD LUCK|`|0i4sNq2waa	I would think so. Avoid steroids.|`|cZu8b9yjaa	if u keep working out ur "muscle" is going 2 get small|`|YCMr0xI4aa	They should get bigger, but it is going to take time. Do not do steroids or enhancers.

Believe it or not we all have flaws that we wish we were not born with but will all the anxiety, worry, etc. actually change us.  No. It will only be a continuous cycle of beating ourselves up because we feel we don't measure up.  What good qualities, talents or traits do you possess that make you unique?  Focus on them.

AA10295001	Anyone who tells to to practice self-will has never suffered from any type of addiction.    I myself had to had help.  I reached a point when I got sick and tired of being sick and tired with drinking.  I didn't know how to live without a drink.  The alcohol did everything for me.  I didn't think I had a problem because I still had a husband and a child.  I lived in a nice home and didn't feel I had lost much because of my drinking.      I did realize later than the person I lost the most was myself.  I was 100% lost myself.  I didn't know what to do either because I couldn't stop drinking and the alcohol wasn't working any more for me.  I felt like dying.    There are three places alcoholics end up and that's jails, institutions and death.  By the Grace of God I hadn't had to go to jail-Yet.  I like you admitted my drinking problem to a doctor my husband took me too.  He gave me a few choices I could make.  One was treatment, AA or outpatient treatment.      I knew nothing about AA and I knew if I picked outpatient treatment I would probably drive to get a drink instead of where I was suppose to be.  So for me, I opted for inpatient treatment to detox.  I ended up spending 28 days and left.  Now understand that this was in 1990 and insurance companies change the way they pay today.    In treatment they introduced me to the 12 Steps of A.A.  After I got out of treatment I started going to meetings and I've met so many people from around the world who have the same problem I have and can relate to my sick thinking.      You're not alone with the disease of alcoholism.  It's not a moral issue whatsoever.  It's not something you can stop by yourself or self will.  If you find when you drink that you can stop you may have a problem.      Not only has AA given me my life back, today I have a new way of living "One Day At A Time" without drinking.  I'm grateful to be clean and sober now for 18 years and I didn't do this by myself.    Not only do you have the disease, but your family suffers with you.  Good Luck and get the help you need.|`|Ts33DJSwaa	hi, cant say i know exactly whay you are going through but i always suggest that the first place to start is to get the facts about alcohol and the effects and then go from there, check out:    www.uniteagainstdrugs.com|`|f00589104255977086e57a356d925224aa	AA?|`|eI9ocdtKaa	It's called Rehab, dude.|`|m65xAqdmaa	Don't buy any drink.|`|AA10247648	You have already taken the first step to recovery because you realize that there is a problem.

I come from a family full of drug addicts and alcoholics. my brother and one of my sisters are both bad drunks. my sister is worse. the doctor says she wont make it through the year at the rate she is drinking today. she is 41 years old. i am the youngest of the 4 of us. my brothers alcholism has cause me nothing but trouble over the last 6 years. Im tired of baby sitting children that are adults. do you want your wife to baby sit a grown man? what about your children? do they really matter. what is really important to you? sure life is not perfect but it only happen once! we can either rise above the darkness of the world and appreciate ourselves and others not matter what... or whither away like a dead tree. its your choice, but when your dead you will have to look back realize you did nothing to stop what was happening!   addiction or not. theres no excuse. i dont care how addictive alcohol or drugs are. i have one sister who quit using drugs after 20 years of being a heroin addict. i started smoking when i was 13 and quit last year at the age of 28. i lived a very difficult and painful life myself, having two alcoholic parents and drug addict siblings; but it is my difficult past that made me value life and gave me the strength not too follow in the footsteps of others but to find a new path when one is dead ended! you can quit! yes you can change! i did it you can too.   and no, life will never be easy. but we are still fortunate to have it. we cannot take advantage of and misuse it!!!! and no, it is never to late to change. development is a life long process for some and never happens for others. make the choice. what will it be?

You should take it slow because if your a smoker and you try to stop cold turkey well 91 persent of people in the world had a very hard time. You could start by asking your waiter to olny serve you so many drinks. That might not work but give it a try. Then, take all your beer and other drinks out of your house so your not tempted. Try to only go out about once every other weekend until your on your feet. And that once every other week you should hire a babysitter and go out with your wife instead of your buddies since your buddies are hard core drinkers and your wife could cut you off after so many drinks. Also, until your on your feet you should not drink stronger drinks like vodka and whiskey try to keep it simple like mabey a beer or so. And after a while you will be strong enough to stop or just have a beer or 2 on Holidays and stuff. Wich is another major problem for dinkers they tend to drink a whole lot more on holidays so try to avoid that.    I hope I've helped.|`|SSr5h5DZaa	I know you don't want to here this but you will need to separate yourself from places that "trigger" this behavior.  Clubs and bars are a big trigger so stay away.  Let your friends know you can't be around them if they drink.  If they don't respect that then you need to stay away.  Go to AA several times a week and get a mentor to help you out.  Don't try to do this on your own.    Let your motivation be your little boy.

You can see if they run meetings in your area on their website http://www.alcoholics-anonymous.org.uk You may find it's for you and that other members have a positive influence on you, especially ones who have been free from alcohol for a long time.  They can give you good advice and AA also hold parties and confrences that are free of alcohol to allow members to socialise without being around temptation.    For other methods why not make an appointment with your GP or nurse at your surgery and see what they advise?

That is the million dollar question right now for you.    If so, you will be on your way to recovery. Find a therapist, engage in healthy hobbies, work on stress management.|`|1wb9rotSaa	okay.  Here's the deal.  iF you want to stop, you have to stop all together.  Don't try to do the thing where you drink less and less and less and evnetually stop.  My dad drank all my life like an animal too.  I got so sick of it but no matter what I did, he would not stop.  He would go behind the wheel drunk and I could not do anything about it.  Now, at the age of 47, he finally stopped.  He hasen't had a drink in about 6 months and he does not seem to want any.  We have wine and other alcoholic beverages in the house but he does nto feel like he needs or wants it.  New years he did not drink anything either.  He just decided to stop one day because he wanted to become a better father and husband.  I am so proud of him.  Hang in there.  If you have a will, there is a way.      My dad's friend also was a major alcoholic and 20 years ago he stopped all together.  It was the hardest thing ever for him but he overcame it.      Think of it this way.  you crave and crave and crave but after a little time passes, you get over it.  Its like exercise.  If you don't exercise, you don't want to do it.  once you start on a regular basis, you want to do it more and more.  Alcoholism is the exact opposite.      Im 20 now and very proud of my father.

You should be very proud of yourself for reaching out for help I pray that you will follow through as it looks like you could be heading for serious trouble that could lead to jail or prison.|`|TAT0bkXyaa	You need to make a choice, what is more important, your son and family or your drinking ways. You may not have both for long you need to seriously consider what is more important to you.|`|B4YESGmwaa	Well  Dude admitting you have a problem is a step in the right direction. Does your wife go out drinking with you or is she fed up with this also. Depending on how often you drink, detox off alcohol can be dangerous, without detox help.   I would strongly suggest entering a treatment center at least to Detox. If you live in the states and want to email me or IM I can give you some information on state funded treatment centers if you don't have insurance that will pay for this. Read my profile if you would like more info. I am also in recovery. God Bless Reggie|`|Ewosh9pTaa	For what it's worth I'm in EXACTLY the same place right now.   I can't figure how my life will work without drink.  BUT,  It HAS to because I won't accept living that way.  So...  to answer your question, I reckon try to find a way to see booze as a crutch that stops you from being yourself. BE yourself. LOVE yourself. Don't be scared of failure and humiliation.  If you can step out your house with that in your head, then you won't need to hide behind the drink.  Best,  Mike Zealey|`|caff779ef781d65802c4f0d1f5908eedaa	Clearly you are an addict!  Your only solution is to quit drinking all together!  Try to go to AA(alcoholics anonymous) meetings near by in your area,and if you and you buddies want to go out  just tell your friends that you cant go to the clubs wth them if that will put you into temptation to drink...  and just please promise me that youll do that especially for your little boy!:]|`|aeiP74PLaa	this happened to my dad he was addicted to the club scene but 1 day i told my dad y dont u stay in tonight and surprised him with my turntables n revealed that ive been practicing djing so learn to party with ur wife n kids n maybe parents and instead of drinking alcohol my dad drinks sarsaparilla
xWpDhVCNaa	i would check your iron... maybe start taking vitamin b... that really helped me... also make sure your diet is full of good foods and not junk... they really dont give you much enegry at all.    lol and masterbate as much as you want it doesn't affect your sleep cycle.|`|RVicFEyFaa	It can depend on what you do during the day, it can also be diet related. If you have a 2pm sleepy eye, you need a power nap that most jobs don't provide. You could sit behind a desk or work construction it's the same drowsy hour. Passing out before prime time is good sleep health. Your body needs more zzz's, not always convenient to the work place or ones time of day spent outside work, let it be.

jrc7V1Gqaa	It could be thought of being high, but there are other factors the have to be taken into consideration. I would ask the school nurse to take your B/P and make recommendations.|`|kNhnwftoaa	It's OK|`|Cmer6UJPaa	The systolic pressure (first number) is relatively normal if slightly high. However, I'm a bit concerned about the diastolic (second number), it's pretty low for a systolic that high. Did you take it yourself? it's very possible that you messed it up because taking BP on yourself is hard to get right.. Otherwise, I would say that for your age your're probabily ok, although the two values are a bit farther apart than they should be in a perfect world. Usually most textbooks tell you that the magic number is 120/80, but being a bit above or below that is normal. Also, bear in mind that BP fluctuates very rapidly based on the processes in your body and your environment (eg. just laying down should make it go up a bit). Ask your doc if you're concerned about it.    *edit - question for medic* Clearly head trauma or some sort of subdural hematoma/edema here is the oh-s**t scenario, but out of pure curiosity (and nothing else), if his ICP was above normal limits, wouldn't there be other symptoms like AMS or concussive symptoms (nausea etc.) that we would be seeing at this point? Or, is it more possible that they wouldn't manifest? Just a little  informal ConED...glad I'm on the same page as you as to the interpretation of the values, though...|`|OE67o2dCaa	If you've recently had a head injury, this is a problem.    Alone, neither of your numbers make me worry, except the diastolic pressure (the bottom number) is SLIGHTLY low, but nothing to worry about.  The problem here is the widened pulse pressure.  If you've had a recent head injury, ICP (Intra-cranial pressure) is from blood filling up the space where your brain is supposed to rest, and it presses on your brain, causing all manner of problems.  Other potential problems with a widened pulse pressure could be all over the book, but at the age of 15, I wouldn't think to go in those directions.

I have actually heard of some cosmetic butt "implants" but the ones I saw appeared pretty unnatural and unsightly. I wouldn't recommend going under the knife.    Now for a secret: I watched a segment on TODAY where they had a model with a very flat bottom (like yours).

iK3YYRaTaa	If it a fasting blood test you can bet your bippy that you are a diabetic. And have been for a long time.        Fasting Blood Sugar Test:  Measures the blood sugar level after 8 hours fast or overnight. Normal fasting blood glucose level is less than 100mg/dl. If your fasting blood glucose level is from 100mg/dl to 125mg/dl then you will have impaired blood glucose level also known as Pre-Diabetes. If your blood glucose level is above 125mg/dl then your doctor will diagnose as a patient of diabetes. To confirm the diagnosis, your doctor may repeat the fasting blood glucose test on any other day. If you have blood glucose level of 126mg/dl or higher in two consecutive tests, then you may have diabetes. If you have blood glucose level greater than 200mg/dl and you have symptoms of diabetes like increased thirst or hunger, frequent urination, weight loss, blurred vision etc, then you may be diagnosed with diabetes mellitus without confirming it with second test.    Good luck my friend|`|69SHxWA9aa	Hi,    If it is a fasting blood test, and you are at 180+ then you likely need to take another test called a A1c test.    It will give a clear result.  If it is over 7%, that is a sure sign that you have diabetes, and need to monitor your sugar level several times a day, and use diet and medication to keep it under control.    If below 6%, then you are in the normal range.  If between those two levels, then you are a candidate for diabetes.    You might want to read both of these books.  Dr. Barnard's Program for Reversing Diabetes.    The PH Miracle for Diabetes.  By Dr. Young.    They both agree that to much soft drinks is bad for you, so is to much cheese, and reducing eggs, milk products, animal fats is a key to improving your health.    Good Luck !|`|vVfH8yBYaa	Curious what you mean by "random" blood test? And do you know what a "fasting glucose" is, because it's definitely not a random blood test.    A fasting glucose is taken after a period of fasting between 8 and 10 hours. Normal results range from 70-99. Anything over 126 is considered in the diabetic range. Thus, your result of 189 puts you well into the range of diabetic.    If this was really a "fasting" glucose, you need to see a doctor soon. The longer you go without treatment, the more damage the disease can do.|`|AA12360257	189 is high normal is 70-120. Loose some weight and the number will go down.|`|kNhnwftoaa	That's a very good sign.  See a doctor before you get sick and go into ketoacidosis like I did.|`|pRF5LLloaa	Pretty much so, yeah.    Combined with your other "symptoms" -- it would appear that you are a pretty good candidate.    But diabetes canNOT be diagnosed by symptoms alone.  You MUST have more extensive blood tests done by a doctor.    The doctor will want to do at least one more test -- The Glucose Tolerance Test.  This test determines how well your body does (or doe not) respond to sugar.  The doctor will ask you to fast (not eat) for at least 8 hours before taking this test.  you must have NO food before the test!    He will then take a blood sugar reading.  this is your "baseline".      He will then ask you to quickly drink a really sweet liquid.  This is almost pure glucose.  It require NO digestion, and the glucose will enter you blood almost as soon as you swallow it.    The doctor will then wait 30-60 minutes, and then take another blood sugar reading.  He will wait another 30-60 minuets, and take a third reading.  He may wait another 30 minutes, and take a fourth reading.  He may also take other reading in the between times.    With all these readings, he can plot a "graph" showing how your blood sugar reacts.    In a normal person, your fasting reading should be low, about 100,  As soon as you drink the liquid, it will jump up to 300-400.  After that, it will quickly drop back down to around 150 or so.    If you are diabetic, your fasting reading will be high (like about 150-200).  When you drink the liquid, your blood sugar will spike to 400-500.  then it will drop VEYR SLOWLY -- showing that you do not have enough insulin.    After the test is over, the doctor may give you a shot of insulin to "bring you back down".    All in all this test takes about 3-4 hours.    But the result are definitive.  After taking the test, the doctor can tell you positively YES or NO if you have diabetes.    THERE IS NO CURE FOR DIABETES.  It CAN, though, be CONTOLLED.     The first line of defense is STRICT control of your diet and adding additional exercise.  the goal is to lose weight (being overweight, even just a little, is what causes diabetes).  the doctor may also recommend one of several oral medications.  if your blood sugars are very high, he may start insulin immediately.    IF you follow doctors orders exactly, (especially the diet....) and lose the necessary weight, most of your symptoms will go away.  The tingling in your toes and fingers is Peripheral Neuropathy (nerve damage), and that will be the LAST symptom go to away.    I strongly urge you to see a doctor and follow his orders EXACLTY.    I was 27 when I was diagnosed -- similar symptoms to you. But I have been a bad patient, and I DIDN'T always follow doctors order (man, I LOVE McRibs....).  But now it is more than 30 years later -- and my kidneys have failed doe to diabetic damage.  I am waiting for a possible kidney transplant.  If it doesnt come soon I will need daily dialysis.  Without a transplant, I can expect to live for only another 5-6 years.  With the transplant I might make 10-12 more years.  At that rate, I wont see my 75th birthday!    PLEASE dont do like I did.  My diabetes is under control now, but it is too late.  Go to the doctor, get tested, and follow his recommendations.  TAKE CARE OF YOUR SEFL!  lose the weight. Get the diabetes under control. Dont waste your health!|`|m9dJH32Taa	Wow, that is extremely high.    Normal is 70 - 99    Pre-diabetes is 100 - 125    Diabetes is 126 and above    And you are 63 points above that!!!    What did your doctor say?    Losing weight and exercising will likely reverse it.|`|Cmer6UJPaa	Yes, 189 is high, normal glucose is usually between 80-120. This alone can't confirm diagnosis of diabetes though, you should see your doctor.|`|AA11492002	You can easily avoid diabetes; remove sodas and diet drinks and limit your sweets to once per day with a meal. Type 2 diabetes is caused from years of insulin overload (eating sweets, junk food or carbs in any form all day long) and not giving your body a break. Eventually your body shuts down insulin production (diabetes) in response to your snacking on junk all day long. Give your body a break and you will be happy.|`|OE67o2dCaa	The possible problem you're referring to is Diabetes, Type II.  This is a form of diabetes where, to break it down in simpler terms to understand (for my benefit as well as yours!) where the amount of fat cells on your Red Blood Cells proves to be a problem.  The act of forcing sugar molecules into your RBCs to be changed into ATP (energy) is a facilitated diffusion process, which is 'facilitated' by a hormone called Insulin.  If your body has a problem, where insulin can't bind to the RBC, or where your body doesn't produce enough or ANY insulin (Type I) you need to take medication to lower it.    However, that being said, lowering your overall bodyweight, and fat will help you, and many people have proven to 'cure' themselves of diabetes with a healthier diet, and with an exercise routine.  Don't fall for any of those "you don't have to exercise, just do this!" routines.  You NEED healthy food, AND a good exercise plan.  No need to train like Arnold, but you do need both, to facilitate weight loss.    Good luck!

I've had the same think for the past few days.....except my symtoms are diahhrea, very tired and somewhat of a stomach ache and a slight fever, but no vomiting.

ldyKSejgaa	Exercise is always healthy and being pregnant is not going to be an exception to the rule, but depending on your specific needs, the type and amount of exercise will need to be adjusted decreasing exercise performance to satisfy the diverse physiologic and lifestyle changes associated with pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Your Doctor will review your actual exercising routine if any, and will advise the avoidance of the following activities that may result in potential harm to your baby and risky for you even if you are healthy.<br>  <br>  Downhill skiing, parachute jumping, roller blading, skateboarding, horseback riding, off-road biking, weight lifting, high impact aerobics, high altitude training, contact sports, scuba-diving, kayaking, surfing, water-skiing and most water sports except swimming.<br>  <br>  Regular exercise requiring you to lie flat on your back is risky particularly after the first trimester because studies have demonstrated that most pregnant women show decreased cardiac output even with low impact exercises so the problem is the position.<br>  <br>  Those considered non-weight-bearing exercises are not only recommended but benefit women that never kept an exercise regime before pregnancy, not only minimizing the risk or injury to the developing baby but making it easier to continue exercising after giving birth.<br>  <br>  Walking, cycling and swimming are usually safe but stop if they make you feel tired and resume them gradually after getting some rest. Do not hesitate to ask your doctor if you have any questions regarding your current exercise routine and those changes or adjustments you may need to do in your program during pregnancy.|`|l5mFq1dqaa	I dont think jumping is good, it can cause the baby to shift positions or bump againts your stomach maybe Yoga would be more stimulating|`|sdv0F3MVaa	Yes, any type of too much shaking can hurt the baby. especially if you are in your first 5 months of carring your child.|`|EuD4pX0saa	yes it is. it's just like shaking baby syndrome. u shaking the baby up. be careful|`|klh0EhIOaa	NO! Don't jump rope, thats bizarre, you'll throw the baby around, don't lift your arms over your head and stretch either, stay off drugs, don't drink, get alot of rest, you can walk to exercise but not power walk.

Once you get past 16 it's harder to move teeth as they settle into their final positions, while when you're still growing they are loose enough to move easily.

LLuCpfh9aa	Yes I have smoked weed, and I'm 16.  I may not be the smartest doctor, but I can tell you that pretty near everything negative you find about weed on the internet is false.  The only truly bad thing about it its that it is not legal, other than that it causes no harm.  There is no chemical addiction, and you can stop anytime you want, which is why I did not have a hard time quitting.  It is a fun experience while you are high, it feels like you are in a dream, but it does not put you in danger, because you know that you are high and you really can still function properly and do anything you can do if you are sober.  Don't make this a big deal, such as breaking up with him for smoking weed.  Also, if you do not want to do it, do not let him pressure you into it.  If you have any more questions, feel free to ask, I hope I helped.|`|T9kMy13Haa	I smoke weed, it is hard to explain how it feels. Time passes a bit slower, stuff is more funny, food tastes better, and you just feel nice and mellow.

I tried it once and I hated it never again it made me feel sluggish. Talk to him that'ss not a good thing. good luck honey|`|BsJwPodoaa	I think it affects people differently.  Some people get stupid or lazy, but there are some people who can actually function fine.  My husband smokes weed, it helps him relax.  He can still do everything he needs to do around the house and work and everything, but I have met people who smoke and don't care about anything except smoking.  You can't die from it, you'd probably just fall asleep if you smoked too much!  It kind of makes you calm and happy.  The first time I tried it, I wanted to take pictures of everything because I thought everything looked like something you'd see in a picture.  It also makes you focus- but only on one thing.  Like if you want to do something like fold laundry, so boring, but if I was high, it'd be easier!  I don't do it anymore.  I found it makes me insanely paranoid.|`|Yt2aUu3caa	the guy at the top is a moron by the way.    i've been smoking since the sixties, and ever since then, i've just smoked because it makes me a kinder, more insightful person.     but you have to moderate, cause if you smoke all day everyday, then your just going to end up a lazy bum, but smoking once a day, maybe even twice just makes you more mellow, more creative and have a deeper appreciation for the more simple things in life like a warm home cooked meal, or the softness of your bed.|`|01x55AbOaa	see the only experienced people say its not so bad.which it isnt, i smoked weed  for years everyday and all day and quit without a problem.i miss how much more fun things were when i was high.but i guess with this country its either be high and have no good job or drink beer heavily and have a decent job.which is kinda funny cuz i was a lot more functional when i was able to get high on weed than when i drank alot.|`|0HfrBEBJaa	It seems obvious to me that it is still smoking so has all the problems that smoking tobacco leaves has. It is interesting as it has a strange affect on time which seems to go ever so slow. However it has lots of disadvantageous the cost being just one. It does turn one into a very sedate type of vegetable as you can achieve very little while using and can have a detrimental affect on the mind and memory but these are long term affects -----something to consider. Perhaps it is time to acquire a new boyfriend as there is no future in this type of entertainment|`|51jR2Lmlaa	You can be killed from smoking weed after you smoke about 150,000 pounds in one day, so yeah not really.    Most people have to smoke three or four times within the same month before they can really understand and enjoy the effects.    It makes you think deeper and more intelligently about everything. I smoke weed before I work out because it allows me to "feel" what muscles need to be stronger and am able to target those muscles when I work out.    There aren't really any negative effects besides the damage done to your heart and lungs from smoking, but this is eliminated when you eat it or smoke with a vaporizer. Also after you come down from the high you feel very tired so its best to smoke at night.     There is no hangover the next day either.|`|AEAxZEveaa	Some people love it, I personally did not think it was that great. How old are you? I don't think drugs are morally wrong, but they are definitely illegal. That's the biggest reason that I'm against drug use. It can really screw up your future if you get caught. No you can't die from it. There will probably not be any big side effects. But if you get caught it can be really bad. I vote for not doing it. Sorry if I sound like your mom:-)|`|2BUCOTaJaa	no thats aganist the law and im scared i will go to hell.
JwecpnBVaa	Sounds good but there is room for improvement.<br>  <br>  On the food be sure that the food you're eating is healthy, mainly fruits and vegetables with some lean meats.<br>  <br>  The exercises are great except you also need to have cardio like jogging, walking, running, and swimming a minimum of three times a week for thirty minutes.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|IUnC3dbraa	you're on the right track with portion control....but you have to understand that WHAT you are eating is just as important as how MUCH you are eating...for example...1 cup of salad is not the same as 1 cup of spaghetti!! make sure that you are eating whole grains, fruits, and tons of vegetables along with protein. also, the times seem alright except that maybe you should eat your snack 2 hours after lunch and then dinner 3-4 hours after your snack. because say you woke up at 10:00am....here's what your schedule would be:<br>  <br>  10-breakfast<br>  11-snack<br>  12-lunch<br>  1-snack<br>  3-dinner<br>  like..you are eating every single hour! you should break it up longer throughout the day so you wont be starving from 3-bedtime! <br>  <br>  also, if you are trying to lose weight, you NEED to incorporate some cardio into your workouts, like at least 45 mins of running/biking/swimming/speed walking anything!! <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|HHB9LUqiaa	I just answered this for you under this question<br>  Does this diet sound good?<br>  go read it!!!  i hope it helps you!! :) :)|`|3SNhXpf0aa	Sounds good. Just make sure you eat 1200-1500 calories a day. Also try incorporating some cardio into your routine.

They aren't created out of thin air just from having sex, either with yourself of a partner.
F9QuGX3Zaa	I have had this, my discomfort was under my arm to that side of my breast. doctors said it lymph nodes that were swollen. However i would advise you to go to your doctor just to be on the safe side. If your worried about going just think your health is important|`|AA11597153	You could have a clogged duct or sweat gland.  If you have recently changed deodorant's that can cause it too.|`|gdY0yPiAaa	rash maybe|`|3Ks21ASDaa	it could be a cyst or like the other person said, swollen lymph nodes. either way, go to the doctor about it. both of these things could be a sign of another serious problem, or they could be just what they are.
fk9AvB25aa	There is not much difference between male and female out breaks, accept when it comes to the genitals since men and women are made differently down there, but genital herpes can affect all areas of both male and female genitalia, even the inner thighs and buttocks. Out breaks will be different from person to person mainly because of their immune systems. Some may have big bad out breaks and other may have very mild ones that feel like a rash. Some will only have one out break and others will have out breaks intermittently through out their lives.|`|vhvFNwz7aa	The male will get blisters anywhere in genital area, base of testicles etc.  Its even common to burn and tingle, and almost look like a birth mark on the penis (head etc)  it will go away in a week, no scar etc, nothing.  Some people break out once a month, some once every 2 years.<br>  <br>  Avoid foods with Arginine in them, its an amino acid that can trigger it, much like stress, caffeine, etc.  <br>  <br>  To help it go away naturally take an amino acid called L-lysine, this works for cold sores, which is HSV-2. similar to genital herpes.<br>  <br>  $7 at health food store.|`|uYzjMAI8aa	Both female and male eventually become riddled with the stuff, nasty, women can have the sores and blisters travel inside and cause serious problems. Men's tend to stay on the surface of the genitalia. <br>  <br>  Deal with them soon as possible.|`|blslTBZKaa	Outbreaks are going to vary from person to person based on their immune system.  The actual physical symptom of the sore is going to be the same the difference may be where they occur and if its a cluster or just a few.  <br>  <br>  It is the immune system that causes people to vary in symptoms not gender.  Thats why some people have severe outbreaks and others less severe.<br>  <br>  Keeping your immnunse system strong is going to help with outbreaks.
AA10958492	If you pick your nose, stop - picking will irritate the vessels in your nose and may cause them to bleed. <br>  <br>  If you are experiencing frequent nose bleeds, having the vessels cauterized is not a bad idea. It may be painful but the nose bleeds should stop. If you choose not to go this route, you could try putting cold compresses on your nose and the bridge of your nose. The heat would most likely be your enemy for nosebleeds. Use a fairly cold compress but not too cold as you said this causes your nose bleeds as well. Good luck to you!|`|j9nhk1v2aa	If you have frequent nose bleeds. then yes you may have to go to the doctor. You may have a sinus infection that causes a lot of nosebleeds. I don't know about blood vessels being burned. But you really should check it out! Sounds serious!!|`|sw2R5A9iaa	drink more water, run a vaporizer when you sleep, and apply neosporin when your nose is dry.  talk to your doctor about effective treatment options.  cauterization is not for your symptoms.|`|vFF5vwqsaa	Consult a doctor.|`|fznvQptlaa	u should go to the doctor

AA11146632	This is not normal.  Stop taking the Tylenol immediately.  There are other medications for pain. Some antispasmodics might work, but will not make you tired or faint.  Find out exactly what is causing the pain, don't just try and cover it up with painkillers. That is very dangerous.  You are also overdosing on it, which may cause you to be admitted to hospital.|`|3yjGfluqaa	this could be the effects of low blood pressure, you need to check it|`|de4dJ0cxaa	Eat well,sleep well,study well,work well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, so u never faint again.NOTE::::EAT WELL ,SLEEP WELL.

I have known a few friends who have called them in times of crisis, and their experiences have varied. Some found the hotline helpful, others thought that it only made the situation worse. One thing they always ask is if you're safe, if you intend to hurt yourself or others. And they say that if you aren't safe, they will call the police in your area. Other than that, they just listen, I guess.|`|KlDoKDEjaa	they talk to you like your some nut job but it helps it gives you someone to talk to

They can be just some brown spotting or last for 3-10 days depending on the person.  Some girls even miss a few months until their hormones develop.  When you get regular, your period will start anywhere from 25-35 days apart and all are normal, but most are usually about 28 days.    welcome to womanhood..|`|TORBP6QIaa	seems like it was the very beginnings of your period....some of us get this brown stain instead of the expected blood loss...it may happen again like this or next time you may get the blood...did you tell mum...if not let her know...if she does your washing she probably noticed the stain and is wondering why you didnt come to talk to her...us mums expect our teenage daughters to get their periods one day...so try not to be embarrassed or shy.|`|4MffVLX8aa	This is probably just your period, don't worry :)|`|SUKdrAkGaa	it could be your period.  when i am on my period, its more brown colored than red|`|zMYYow55aa	it's your period. happened to me. i asked my mom|`|HDUq1ls7aa	What ever happened to mothers answering these damn questions?

RMdKNJWtaa	I'd also recommend that you NOT touch unclean animals with your bare hands. Even rescue workers at the ASPCA use gloves. There are too many things that you can be affected by, from allergies to viral and bacterial infections.    As the person above mentioned, it is very possible you're allergic to ferrets. Or fecal matter on your sensitive skin. But there's no way to tell for sure since we haven't been following you around. Allergies generally show up sooner than two days, but again, I don't know how often you touched them and if you touched anything else or used a product both times (like a hand soap, cage cleaner, lotion). In the mean time, tell your friends to take better care of their animals, and you take better care of yourself.    Sam|`|bVCTq9v6aa	You're clearly allergic to ferrets, take a benedryl and go back to bed.
UQdqzLgfaa	A sneeze is formed by the spasm of the chest and of the pharynx that connects the esophagus and the nasal cavity. When the nerve endings in the lining of the nose detect the irritating substances, they send impulses to the part of the brain that controls involuntary actions. The brain then sends signals to the chest muscles to squeeze the lungs. The pharynx also shuts to prevent the air being squeezed out of the lungs into the mouth. And so, with a loud blast, the air is expelled through the nose in the form of a sneeze.<br>  <br>  And why the hell can't we spell legibly?|`|3sGkmzOYaa	Learn to use spell check.|`|IXcNofwnaa	Dust in our noses?|`|tz1aVHoUaa	lolz,lovin da slang lol,erm me think its a reaction to certain products or particles. they react with us creatin a response which is known as a  sneeze<br>  XxxMwahXxx|`|QK7ssy2Xaa	Doesn't your heart skip a beat when we sneeze?|`|VemHKmkmaa	god damn, srsly wut the f_ck???|`|b1NMh5K2aa	Ermm what??|`|fKuvMPCiaa	Speak English!|`|a59ef2d6e344a5e9aa6f055a0dfa92f1aa	bc Iz haz sumpin n meh noze??|`|lQR9fYGhaa	blow your nose|`|6ycnSoaRaa	WHAT??????
PXjdCO6raa	Hi. I am an orthodontist assistant so I can answer that question for you. You dont want anything hard and your doctor should have told you this. No hard candy, sugar candy, chewy candy, gum, hard foods like carrots or apples unless you cut them in pieces. You can eat many things just nothing you think could possibly pop off one of the brackets. If it pops off it ok. Go to your dentist and they can put it right back on. No big deal. Just be careful.|`|X1pCRnhGaa	When I had my braces, I ate mashed potatoes, jello, pudding, stuff like that...Just anything soft really...
HskD8XYOaa	I had this problem and solved it by going to the doctors in person and refusing to leave until I saw a doctor. Took about 20 minutes. Remember if you act like a sheep these people will treat you like a sheep.|`|L4z1FI5Kaa	Our surgery usually keeps a couple of "Emergency Appointments"; you can also get to see either the Practice Nurse or even better, the Nurse Practitioner fairly quickly.  Do you have these at your Practice?<br>  If either of those sees you and they feel that it is imperative you see a doc soonest, they will interrupt before he calls his next patient and call him in to see you.<br>  It's also easier to go into the surgery to make an appointment than to get into a telephone queue.|`|HAhm1TUoaa	I never used to, but I'm having a lot of difficulty with my most recent problem because they keep "forgetting" to put the referral through, or they say they'll ring me back so they don't. So I keep having to ring THEM back to keep the ball rolling. I heard nothing for a whole month after my first appointment, then my patience ran out and when I rang back it turned out that had just been doing nothing the whole time. It is driving me mad.|`|7FGsxx4Qaa	I certainly used to but i'm with a different surgery now and i find them very good,so far..Change yours if you have a bad one............|`|OgaJqkSQaa	At my surgery you can either phone in the morning, which is a waste of time, or book ahead, which is usually a two or three week wait.<br>  <br>  Sometimes a gp will be available on the day, but I've made this mistake before - they're the crap ones that no-one bothers with, so it's a pointless waste of time going to see them in the first place.|`|534b588aabc2f9470b492f99f7d98b2baa	No. I have heard this opinion before but where I live if I ring the surgery in the morning, then I get seen in the morning. I have never yet failed to get an appointment on demand.<br>  <br>  I should add that the practice has the policy of limiting it's catchment to a defined area and they keep to this rigerously. Maybe more practices should do this.|`|g0qIAWhmaa	yes !<br>  you have to make a appointment by phone  by either 8.45 or 2.45 both of witch are school run times , and if you try and phone after those times they tell you there isn't any appointment times left ! <br>  so i have no option but to sit in the waiting room with my kids till the doctor decides he can fit me in . it's ridiculous .|`|u8Km1J3Gaa	I have no problems, but my surgery has 6 GPs and locums so you can always get an appointment.<br>  I have problems getting an appointment with my NHS dentist. I have a filling that has come out and if I want to see him I have to pay ￡20 for emergency appointment or wait 3 months for an appointment.<br>  <br>  The whole system is ridiculous.|`|e3bbea72940dc8ddb89cf1c33bdc265aaa	I can see you a week on monday?<br>  Yes its a nightmare.... take some time from work and go for an emergency appointment... your health deserves it|`|xKjm7t5Iaa	Yep, keep getting told to phone back the next morning. Or go to A+E and sit there for 8 hours.|`|K1WkdUtvaa	Oh yes!! It's chronic here [a bit like your illness is by the time you see a doctor!] We have to wait well over a week for an appointment and up to three weeks if you want to see your own GP, whom you hardly ever get to see so there's no continuity of care. If you are working and can only have an evening appointment it's even worse. My husband who has high blood pressure has to wait two weeks from ringing up just to see the nurse for her to do his regular check, it's rediculous. It makes me mad as we only ever go when it's urgent, I didn't go for seven years once and when I was unexpectedly taken really ill I couldn't get an appointment, it's not as if we're time wasters like some people. They also will not do home visits unless you kick up a fuss and you have to be dying, recently my Dad who is 89 had a fall and injured himself, we rang for the GP to come out or even the nurse as he was badly shaken up and not up to being moved really and we didn't want to bother the hospital if not needed, he wouldn't come and the ambulance said it was better if we took him ourselves as they'd be ages. So we ended up really struggling to get him in our car as he has very limited mobility. It was disgusting, so you're not on your own with this problem it's really bad here too!|`|fynzkVK4aa	Yes its the same here.  Whats even more annoying is even when the doctor tells you to make a follow up appointment, or sends a letter to say you need an appointment, you still have to go through the same daft system and it can take weeks to get an appointment.<br>  <br>  I'm having loads of trouble at the moment because they are playing with my medication and want me to go back every 4 weeks, but won't issue repeat prescriptions without my seeing the doctor because of the changes they are making.  Because I couldn't get an appointment I waited ten extra days without any medication before I could see the doctor. This was despite trying to book an appointment in advance, but only to be told I would have to ring back on the day, to find myself in the queue and getting through once all appointments were gone...*sigh*<br>  <br>  I think they should split it so that some appointments are pre-bookable, and others "ring on the day", so that people who have been trying to get through with a continuing problem, or who have been told to make an appointment, would be able to do so, but still leave some appointments for those who wake up ill or whatever.  At the moment it is just ridiculous and something definitely needs to be done.|`|CszuPEXTaa	This happened to me just this morning.<br>  The GPs' surgery phoneline opens at 0800, I rang at 0811 and there were no appointments left.<br>  I don't feel right asking for an emergency appointment when someone else could actually have a real emergency...<br>  <br>  Instead, I had no choice but to go to A&E and wait 2.5 hours - the last time I had to wait 4 hours.<br>  (I'd like to say the hospital staff were excellent :)|`|9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	Yes this is a big problem which allocating booking at a certain time of the day, so naturally everyone rings at this time and one can't get through. Also, it's a little unfair as 0800 -0900 is the school run time so many people may not be able to get to the phone to book an appointment.<br>  <br>  These bloody surgeries are supposed to be making it more accessible for patients, it's a joke! That said, my surgery have a fairly goo system. You can book appointments online in advanced- I always tend to get an appointment this way. You should write a letter to the practise manager, nothing will change if no one complains.<br>  <br>  Also, if you absolutely need an appointment on a certain day, ring the day before and specifically ask for advanced bookable appointment. They should let you do this if you explain your reasons or simply say that you are unable to phone at that time of the day- you could be working etc.<br>  <br>  Edit<br>  I agree with Geoff. If they fail to co operate then just turn up there and demand to be seen- I have done this on more than one occasion.|`|AA10352420	Yes this is a real problem with the present system of NHS There are no responsible persons to ask anything on this You will be shifted from post to post until you give up. Ideally go the surgery and  make the appointment or go the nearest A and E department if this is urgent
PYl3GSQZaa	Hey I may not be qualified, per se, to answer your question, but I am just wondering how much pressure is placed on you by friends, family members and others to be "perfect"? From what I I gather, I am assuming that your always doing things to please others. We all want to excell in life, and we should be allowed to do so within our own means, with no outside pressures to be what or who we cannot be. This is all new to me, but I really think you should speak to someone about your feelings, speak to a close friend, or simply check the phone listings for a 24 hour counsellor you can speak to. I hope tht you will speak to someone, because someone is willing to listen. I went to a funeral today for a young woman, she was the daughter of my friend. She was 21 years old, a excellent university student who excelled in all studies and she was also an avid baseball player. In her young life a lot was expected of her, and she felt pressured to do and be the best, a week ago she commited suicide. No one could understand how such a young woman who had everything going for her and with so many friends could give up on her life. So I hope that you believe me when I say that someone is willing to listen.|`|rNdun1V7aa	just sounds like you suffer from depression, sometimes it's nothing that happened to you, it's just a malfunction in your brain. that's what meds are for. you shouldn't live with this impending gloom.|`|NBT5PoRVaa	hey don't make things more complicated than they are. people have a tendancy to blame themselves for things they didn't have any control of or if they couldn't predict something bad was going to happen and they did nothing about it. If you feel guilty about stupid things maybe you are just thinking too much. Go do something with friends or play a sport to release some energy so you don't do this stuff.   You need to change your thought proccess. never tell yourself that you are nothing. it should never be an option. I will say a prayer for you and i hope everything goes well.|`|nhGorPBoaa	If you are looking for an answer as to where this feeling originated, you will probably have to sit down with a professional who can help you discover that for yourself. If you are asking what triggers or causes you to feel this way now, that is a question that you might be able to discover on your own. Very often what causes something originally will no longer be a factor after a while, but the thing that has been caused will remain and continue to stick around until the original issue is dealt with. For example, you might feel this way because something in your past originally created a feeling of inferiority. Now, that thing that caused it might no longer be pertinent to your current situation, however the actual feeling of inferiority itself is going to remain and it will be triggered by one or possibly many things. The only way to fully deal with and hopefully remove the issue is to go and deal with the original prime causer and like i said, that takes a professional.  I hope that it works out for you. By the sounds of it you have a lot of life to enjoy and there is no reason why you shouldn't try to get beyond these feelings.  Best of luck!|`|vXotXl1Laa	Lack of self confidence. I am the same, so that makes you not alone.  Let me ask this, "No matter what you do, it doesn't seem good enough?" You can win awards, be praised at work, be craft-y and such, but find no reward for yourself? Find yourself still looking for acceptance? People looking at you are judging you for everything!?    I still do this after seeing a therapist, taking anxiety meds, and working at the same job for 17 years. All I can do is be me...those thoughts are mine, they are my drive to be a perfectionist...and I hope someday I get there. Not to sound crazy, but when you get there too, say HI...!|`|LRC5ns2xaa	maybe it was something that happened in your childhood life...|`|PsqwNTW5aa	To feel like you make all these mistakes and misfortunes, that you are worthless and inferior most likely tells me that you were not adequately loved as a child. Sure, my mom told me she loved me but she would blame me for her feelings, she would hit me when she was frustrated, and she didn't provide warmth and trust.    I would think that this is stemming from your childhood and seeing a therapist for more insight is the best advice I can give.
OiQFklFraa	you probably just coughed so hard it busted a blood vessel in your sinuses.  it will be ok.  if the cough continues for a couple days you should see your doctor.|`|JkoZzjwaaa	you may have a blood spot in your nose (where your skin in your nose is thin) when you coughed your blood pressure rose and busted it (its ok i have one) its a common thing to have but i would still talk to your doctor about it if your concerned (it may give you a bit of closure)
g3AdLLUPaa	Finding an anti wrinkle solution that works for you is a long and tiring process. You're faced with offerings from hundreds of companies using a variety of unproven components that promise to leave your face as smooth as it was in your youth.     Most men and women want to look younger and reduce the appearance of facial wrinkles, and restore their skin to its younger days.     As a result a great deal of creams and various other skin treatments have been created to solve this ever-present problem but few of these treatments are effective and safe.     Your search for the right skin-care treatment ends here. Revitol combines the most effective anti aging skin care ingredients with a new revolutionary component in a blend that will really leave your skin feeling young and smooth
YnPu2uCpaa	Oh, sure. My brother used to sleepwalk, and he was maybe eight years old. He would go all over the house, and we'd occasionally even find him outside.  If you're really concerned about it, talk to your family doctor. But it does happen, even for stress-free non-drug users.|`|0yNFwwpeaa	All of the things you mention can contribute to sleep walking, but sleepwalking can still occur in their absence.|`|969b1d6ecb8f3f15381cdfc44bfc106eaa	yesss|`|sKGeirdaaa	yes its very possible
5kXxr6r0aa	BMI stands for Big Misleading Information.    its a sham that makes fat people feel fatter than they are and skinny people feel fat.    want proof? 1 year ago my BMI was like... 19 or something and i was 11% bodyfat.    now, my BMI is around 20, and i'm around 4% bodyfat. hmmm...    don't worry bout your BMI, worry about bodyfat percentage.|`|cJRFbZUaaa	Think of your weight like the gas gauge in your car rather than like a thermometer.  By that I mean look at the direction the numbers are going, not the number itself, just like you look at the gauge to see whether you're running low on gas but wouldn't obsess with the exact amount in your tank. Too many people yo-yo, losing weight and then gaining more than they lost.  Instead of fixating on a set amount of weight to lose, focus on healthy eating and exercise.|`|UVFtr5f4aa	I really dislike the BMI because it does not account for any muscle, bone density, etc.  You could be average size and still be overweight according to the BMI.  The best way is to just look in the mirror.  Do you fit in your clothes and there problem areas that a little exercise will help you slim down.  If no, you are probably just fine.|`|s9ZUMI5maa	Eat less. Exercise more.    Pretty fuckin' basic.
y39iNwFjaa	Not having first hand experience I can only go from what I've heard You can't help her. She must help herself and I think that you have no choice other than to tell her that you'll be there when she gets help for her drinking - but not until then. Get details of your local AA meeting and tell her that you'll even take her there - but she HAS to take that step. Tell her when she's sober that you love her and that you fear for her - she has to WANT to stop. You need to try and make her want that.|`|RoicHy87aa	INTERVENTION!!!!! the only way she can go to rehab is to realize how badly she is hurting you all and then admit herself. rehabilitation is going to be just as hard for her as it is for you to see her drunk but just give her reassurance every day how proud you all are of her if and when she decides to stop. good luck and i really do wish well for you and your family.|`|ArDjAl4Raa	It was the same for me, but it was my dad. He abused my mom, verbally, in front of us, and though he drinks less now and sometimes not at all, my mom, sister, and I are damaged in all different ways. my mom divorced him too late, and the damage was done. I can't tell you whether you should get her help, because she has to want it and unfortunately she may never recover. Some people don't and you simply can't predict who will and who won't. I think you should try an intervention and rehab, but do lots of reearch on the places to take her and the method of intervention. For now, try to stay away from her. I mean emotionally detach yourself from her. She will help herself or accept help if she wants to, and if she is ready. That is the hardest thing to learn: that it is out of your power. I think you should build a rich and fulfilling life for now. Surround yourself with healthy, loving people and work on improving yourself and your career, getting where you want to go, and having fun. Stay close to you grandma. It's out of your power for the most part, I'm sorry to say. You may not like the idea of this, but try an Alanon meeting. You don't have to talk to make friends. Listening is nice. It may not be for you. I don't know. You can love your mom, and she will love you always, despite her problem. Alcoholism is a hard thing. My family isnt fixed and I'm not that wise or lucky, but i hope i've helped. Dinnner's ready!|`|eTwTcw1Waa	I think you need to tell her how you feel.  Convince her that alcohol is not good for you and convince her to go to rehab.  I have the same problem with my mom. I am 14 and have to deal with it.  My dad and I convinced my mom to stop drinking by telling her that she is hurting the family by drinking.      I think you need to get her committed to get treatment.  She is only going to get worse.  I am sorry that this is happening to you.  I know how it feels.|`|DDkkwPcPaa	Hi    From what i hav seen and read about alcoholics is that they need to become clean for themselves, they need to do it, no matter how much you want your mum to change, it has to come from her, I think that getting her committed no matter how tempting this is, would ruin your relationship with her, this may be seen as interference and not appreciated, and not be seen as you intended it to be.    I would try and ignore any bad comments, and believe in yourself as a caring individual, and that you are better than she says.    I am no expert on this, but was an alcoholic at 16 yrs old, I gave up because I had my stomach pumped twice and was told by my gp that I would end up with liver failure and be lucky to get to my 21st birthday.    You need to try and point your Mum into a direction that she would be happy fighting for, and it needs to be subtle, so that she believes that it is her own suggestion!    Try research, maybe library or AA for advise.    Hope this helps    Nick G
TdqeC0vmaa	it sounds like ocd. <br>  and actually it sounds like my ex. <br>  <br>  He would wipe off the telephone with Clorox wipes after anyone else used it.... including me... <br>  <br>  Is he normal - no<br>  should you be concerned - maybe yes maybe no<br>  <br>  The questions you need to consider<br>  <br>  1- can you live with this behavior in the long term?<br>  if it doesnt bother you than so what. Let him do what he does.<br>  If it does bother you it will only bother you more and more as time goes on and its highly unlikely he will change.<br>  <br>  2- can you cohabitate?<br>  He is already organizing your things "purse etc" <br>  Does he move your things or get irritated when you move his things or do not quite keep his place the way he would like it to be. <br>  If you are planning a long term relationship with him again it is likely he will not change and in the opposite of the last question can he live with you being how you are? <br>  If your normal healthy standards do not meet his obsessive standards and you were to share a space for any length of time you will drive eachother MAD. So if he can tolerate your normalcy and you can live with his orderliness you'll be ok. But if either one of you can not deal with the others expectations over a long time this may not go so well<br>  <br>  3- is his behavior interfering with his life?<br>  people with obsessions and compulsions -ocd or not - can go about their buisness seeming a little "quirky" but otherwise happy , healthy, working, and living. If he still has time to have a full happy and prosperous life while being this way then its not so severe that you should be concerned.<br>  <br>  4-is his behavior interfering with your relationship?<br>  compulsively sweeping floors and not making eye contact when you visit. <br>  Everyone comes to relationships with certain expectations of needs to be met. And the best relationships meet the needs of both individuals and both people strive to fulfill the others needs and keep them happy while making sure they have their bounderies and needs met. <br>  If you need more focus on you , more time, more of anything in order to feel your needs are being met that he can not provide because he has to do these behaviors then there may be an issue. Not to be concerned for him per say but for your relationship with him. Again hes not likely going to change. And if you need more from him that he may not be able to give you may grow unhappy. If you try to make him give you more and stop his behaviors to do so he may grow unhappy. <br>  <br>  If he can live with it and live with you and you can live with it and live with him being that way and your both getting what you need from each other so what. let him be.<br>  <br>  If its interfering with his life, you can not get along in the same space overtime, one or both of you can not get your needs met<br>  then you might have cause to have concern|`|b81H0vlYaa	You should only be concerned if it becomes a problem to him, meaning he spends way to much time doing this that he doesn't do much else, or is interferring with your relationship.  It also could be a problem if not being able to clean everything or get it clean enough causes him anxiety or panick attacks.  This sounds like typical OCD.  You could ask him about it if you want.  He could seek counseling or medicines to help with it, it if is bothering him.|`|EMbaak9waa	Wow he sounds like my dream man.<br>  How about you send him my way LOL<br>  I would enjoy this if i was you.<br>  Oh and i don't think its anything for you to be concerned about.<br>  If he's happy as can be let him keep doing it.|`|562qoBUUaa	He cleans his nuts with rubbing alcohol?!?! WOW.|`|ffpdB1tzaa	He sounds like a very clean person, but if the relationship is going to go anywhere, and you are not as OCD as he is, you will drive each other crazy.  <br>  <br>  He needs to go to a regular physician and tell him the problems that he is having.  There are many antidepressants that will help him not be so obsessive about small things.  If it doesn't get better after a few monhts, it would be time for him to ask his family doctor about a psychiatrist.|`|dWlp4fOLaa	to me it sounds like ocd (obsessive compulsive disorder) i have a couple of links here.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsessive-compulsive_disorder" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsessive-c...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/DS00189/DSECTION=symptoms" rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/obsessi...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.helpguide.org/mental/obsessive_compulsive_disorder_ocd.htmhttp://www.mentalhealthchannel.net/ocd/symptoms.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.helpguide.org/mental/obsessiv...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.medicinenet.com/obsessive_compulsive_disorder_ocd/article.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.medicinenet.com/obsessive_com...</a><br>  <br>  i hope these links help you and your friend!|`|lf5ZXo9Eaa	Sounds like he has Obsessive Compulsive disorder (OCD).

xyWe7BFqaa	Hi Jack,    It sounds like you're very frustrated and angry. While exercise can be a great way to make yourself feel better (and stay healthy), sometimes it just isn't enough. One of the main symptoms of depression in men your age is irritability, and based on what you've said it sounds like this may be the problem. Depression is treatable. I would encourage you to talk to your parents, or a counselor at school. Good luck!
uCtj31SNaa	you dont take anything that has not been prescribed by a doctor.  This is very dangerous. Yes there is a reason doctors do not prescribe this type of med to young people it can cause a reverse reaction because your hormones and your body has not stopped growing and can do more harm than good you may have mood swings worse than before you need to go to the doc let them know you are taking this so they can tell you the safest way to get off them so you do not crash or can prescribe something safe. They might prescribe the same thing but you dont know so i would suggest you get to the doc before something bad happens. and by the way all teenagers do things they are not proud of thats how we learn so please dont be so hard on yourself and just make yourself the best person you can be. Good luck|`|cku5S9WLaa	Epilim was something I was taking when I used to have epilepsy when I was 0 - 4 years old. Don't mess with these drugs. They have to be prescribed.
bSQgVqtiaa	depression is a nasty little buuger. I started having it at around 16. Im now 30 and it still attacks me from time to time but when you get older hopefully we get tougher or more immune to its affects or we are supossed to? Talking about it would probably help you because when its inside and trapped in there its not very nice company to keep. So I would say take tentative steps and get help with it from helpful people you can trust even if you have to have funnies as your peer group. Fellow sufferers are very interesting and usually very wise people. Hope you feel better soon|`|0H63P4jAaa	get off your medication. go see a shrink.|`|fXcZ5DbRaa	your sick you *****|`|eTwTcw1Waa	Seeing a psychologist can help figure out why you are depressed.|`|2QS8j9aOaa	You can talk to a psychologist because their might be a deeper problem that you have buried in the unconscious. They can do things to bring that out by talking and Bi-Polar might be a genetic factor too.Get some help because your depression is real and needs to be helped.|`|reng2yyEaa	Hi, let me start by congratulating you by posting this question. I think you are a very brave young man. Depression can be a momentary response to many situations and stresses. In teenagers, depressed feeling is common because of the typical maturation process, the stress related to it, the influence of sex hormones, and independence disagreements with parents ( I am hoping you dont have the last one).   Your description shows that you have already sought medical advice.  If there is a history of Bipolar disorder in your family,  you have to continue to see your GP and go through different test and examination to make sure that  you have the disorder or not.  I am not sure whether you have done this or not. I f you have, please look at the following links you get a great deal of help  and support  for Bipolar  disorder:    http://www.dbsalliance.org/site/PageServ... This is the website for USA)    http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Bipolar-dis... ( This is the Website  for UK)      Did your doctor recommend you to see a counsellor? If yes please do so as it helps. You may think talking wouldnt help but once you do start talking to someone who did not have passed judgement on you, you will feel much better.   Meanwhile try to find a hobby or sport. From your question it seems to me that you are a smart teenager and I am sure there are hobbies out there which can help to distract you of thinking that you are depressed even for a short time. Loads of good luck to you and hope this helps a little|`|ZdCgVTFKaa	you might have dysthymia its constant depression with small pauses in between them...chronic... its not like as bad as major depression but theirs a high chance of obtaining major depressive disorder later on in your life... im supposing you're depressed because of a genetic predisposition to depression...sometimes something so small that wouldn't make sense for a regular person to be depressed...triggers the psychological disease...     definitely seek therapy... talking doesn't seem like it helps but what you don't know is that therapy is a maybe 3 year process and it takes long to feel the effect... because they have to find the root of the problem and help you fix it... many unlock old traumas and brings them back to your present mind and then heals them...depends on what kind of therapy you get...    and you should discuss the medicine with your doctor...there are many types and some people don't feel the effect of one but do with others
zzaScg0haa	Start with some interval training, sprinting them jogging then sprinting, etc for 45 minutes a day|`|YYRb6oE3aa	You can do the interval training (speed up for a certain period of time, like 1-2 minutes) on elliptical machine or hill/speed training on the treadmill. Stair work does a trick as well. You can go one step at a time, skip one, and/or going side way. Think about going up 3 flights of stairs. If you train there for even 10 minutes, that will be a good workout! I know I enjoy training my clients on stairs!
ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	NO, cold sores are Herpes type 1, usually contracted when you get childhood chicken pox, from the varicella virus.  Genital Herpes or Herpes type 2, is an std and passed thru sexual contact.  The real bugger is that type 1 can be transmitted to the genitals in oral sex and then it mutates into type 2.

ufgv7oTjaa	Acai is a fantastic antioxidant... but I would be very very wary of the sites that offer the free offers. Lots of repeated words in there, but many of the "free offers" are either scamming because they aren't sending real Acai or canceling the plan after the "free trial" will be more than a pain. There have been so many members that have posted in this section that they have been ripped off by some of these companies (and some that think all companies that sell Acai are the same), so it's safest to just avoid the "free offers" if you want to try it out.<br>  <br>  Most health food stores carry smaller bottles of Acai for just a few dollars per bottle (a month's supply might be $5-10, depending on the dose and the company), but that would be more than enough to try it out.<br>  It is a great antioxidant and my personal experience with similar products is when my wife got sick while I was taking it and I didn't. Aside from that, whenever she got sick, so did I. Some people love the taste of this and some don't like it, so that's a matter of personal preference. Some people prefer to take capsules to avoid the taste issue and some prefer to mix the juice into other juices to cover the taste... it's up to you. <br>  Good luck and I hope I helped!|`|FkXt4XLvaa	Acai berries are not really all they are cracked up to be. ANY berry is good for you. ANY berry has antioxidants in it. ANY berry (or any fruit or vegetable for that matter) can help to cleanse your system.<br>  <br>  Most of the weight loss products made with Acai berries are system flushers...meaning they are basically like laxatives. You eat. You take a pill. You don't really have time to gather any fat from the food because it all goes to, ahem, waste.<br>  <br>  Most people who do the before and after shots and videos for commercials and ads are people who have never worked out and have simply just gained weight over the years. Fat on them will go away quickly when any sort of diet, exercise routine, or weight loss pill is introduced because they have not built muscle over it.<br>  <br>  I found this website a while back when I was researching them, wanting to know the same things you do now. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.acaiberryrating.com/index.asp?Network=1&OVRAW=acai%20berry&OVKEY=acai%20berry%20diet&OVMTC=advanced&OVADID=42061252022&OVKWID=170221505022" rel="nofollow">http://www.acaiberryrating.com/index.asp...</a><br>  <br>  Don't believe all the hype - on anything really. If you want to try it, make sure you look at the label for other ingredients. If it's really going to work, it's got to be mostly acai berry and other natural derivatives. If you can't pronounce it, it's probably not good for you.<br>  <br>  Some specialty grocery stores may even carry them in the produce section. I don't live anywhere with a specialty grocery store so am not sure on that but it would be your best bet if you want to try them since they will be fresh and not processed and the effects will be instant and not clouded by other ingredients.<br>  <br>  I myself have not tried them as I am allergic to berries but I have several friends who have tried them in various forms.<br>  <br>  One no longer takes her high blood pressure medicine (but she also lost about fifteen pounds recently because she walks constantly in her new job). <br>  <br>  A friend of hers no longer has swelling in his legs (but he also stopped driving a truck so isn't sitting in that position anymore.)<br>  <br>  Two friends of mine began throwing up after taking it because it was so strong (but one has irritable bowel syndrome and one had the flu at the time).<br>  <br>  It really depends on the person, the situation, why you want to take them, if you have taken things of this sort before, and your own body functioning.<br>  <br>  Try regular berries first...to see what effect they have on you. Buy a bunch of different kinds and blend them together. Spoon that mixture into yogurt or over icecream or just take a spoonful and eat it like that. Do that daily for a week at least. If you can handle that and you feel like it's positively affecting you - Do foods digest better? Is your skin more supple and vibrant? Do you have more energy? - then Acai berry may be for you. Then again, if you're doing great on the other types of berries, you might as well stick with them!|`|yjliGiRmaa	This is a berry that is blended into different thing they have a wine that u can buy or supplement pills if u like green tea its all natural like that.

lhOd2hvXaa	I wish I had been given the chance of PT before my disc (L5 S1) ruptured.  I ignored all symptoms of the problem until it was too late.     In my opinion a year in pain is already too long. I'm not sure if the HMO process is what might be stalling the process but you need to be your own advocate.  I didn't push hard enough on my own behalf and, as a result, I have now had two surgeries (discectomy and spinal fusion) and I still have constant pain in my left leg (the ruptured disc permanently affected my sciatic nerve).    Get a second opinion if that's possible, I know that PT is usually the fist stepping stone in the red tape so you may have to at least make an attempt at that first.    Good Luck!|`|bQ4RAi07aa	Within the first six weeks it is probably reasonable to try different medications, methods and therapies to try to alleviate the pain and give the disk herniation time to heal. With time the body can reabsorb the disk herniation, and if the symptoms start to slow within the six-week period, continued conservative treatment for the herniated disk is warranted and this might be your case.    At the very least, at the start of pain from a herniated disk it is usually considered reasonable to start with a couple of days of bed rest followed by slow movement.  Try to do these conservative treatments and small doses of your pain meds and this should help heal.  Always check with your dr. regarfding any advice on treatment.|`|Ytpq9PCfaa	I have that as well if you do not take care now it will adventually effect your neck. basically rest when you hurt, move around alot and walking is good for you.no push pulling type of stuff. and yoga is the best just basic stuff.   surgery is an option that will help for a few years but more than likley you have oystioauthritis.

TXlPfydxaa	Alright, first off, you were close with your spelling, it's Morphine. Second, the Endocets you were prescribed are the exact same thing as Percocet, just a different brand name, they're both Oxycodone/Acetaminophen pills. The side effects you're describing are normal side effects of the oxycodone, however if it's too much to handle, ask your doctor if he/she can switch you to something different, switching to Advil may help, however, the prescription pain relievers you've got are far more superiour to Ibuprofen which is in Advil. Oxycodone, (endocet) is an opiate pain reliever, and is derived from Thebaine and Codeine, also it is more potent than Morphine, as the bioavailibility of Oxycodone is 87%, and Morphine is around 50%-65%, but there are alternatives to Endocet, such as Vicodin in a higher amount, MS Contin (morphine), or Tramadol. Trying to get the same pain relief from Advil as you get from Endocet will be a disappointment, because Advil is very inferior to Endocet, and I'd advise you to stay on the Endocet, but if the side effects from the oxycodone are too much to handle, Talk to your doctor about getting a prescription for a different pain reliever. Hope this helps|`|AA10097817	Ouch!    Always better to try to use a non-addictive drug than an addictive drug. Percocet is addictive. I'd try to switch to the Advil as much as possible, leaving the Percocet for just before bed.    Good luck.
oQBzf5tYaa	Whatever the reasons may be for your high blood cholesterol level - diet, heredity, or both - the treatment your doctor will prescribe first is a diet. If your blood cholesterol level has not decreased sufficiently after carefully following the diet for 6 months, your doctor may consider adding cholesterol-lowering medication to your dietary treatment. Remember, diet is a very essential step in the treatment of high blood cholesterol.|`|05OKQFXkaa	Cholesterol is a fat buildup on the walls of your arteries. I recommend exercise and a healthy diet. Less fats in your food, more vegetables. Also small amounts of alcohol may help, because alcohol contains groups that dissolve fats, therefore when your blood will carry alcohol it will dissolve some of the fat on the walls of the arteries. Exercise helps because it improves your cardiovascular system and your arteries constantly have to expand and contract, depending on the amount + type of physical activities you do.|`|Y5xfCdukaa	EAT CHEERIOS! OMG!!! :]|`|Pxa0jx2paa	I've done this and it has helped:    You can donate blood every 8 weeks, and you can drink green tea.

It usually takes 10–14 days for all the blisters to be scabbed over and then you are no longer contagious.

C'mon ... do you REALLY think wanting to chop off your Great Toe (big toe)  is normal behavior?<br>  <br>  I'm sorry you've had such on-going problems with the nail and yes, having the nail and nailbed removed may be a valid surgical solution.  However, do you even understand how much of your normal balance and gait (walking) depends on having those Great Toes?<br>  <br>  Time to talk to your parents and Health Care Provider seriously about your concerns and how desperate you're feeling by having to deal with this chronic pain and repeated infections.
g8U6NthEaa	no, you do NOT have to shower in high school. its ok, if u are small down there, because u  are still goriwng and in the middle of puberty. i think its ok if u are bi, it seems as though u are bi.....it seems like u like girls and guys, and that is fine and everything....just make sure that you are sure about all this before you do anything about it and be sure not to wreck any friendships that you might have with your friend if you are thinking to take your relationship with him to the next level. ok, well i hope this helps annd PLEASE VOTE ME AS BEST ANSWER! thanks, and if u have anymore questions, feel free to contact me at neon_rainbow99@yahoo.com!|`|AVe03ZtUaa	You don't have to I don't think. U shuld prob ask someone who goes to the school.|`|yL7RKxHFaa	I think that is the creepiest thing ever. LOSE THE FRIEND. And you are too young to even know about this stuff....  Although you seem to not be serious...Almost like this is a trick question.|`|htMOl3c4aa	Isn't taking showers with other guys a good thing for you if you think you're bi? Anyways at my high school, it's optional after gym which we only have during our freshman/sophomore year. But I always showered with the team after basketball, it's not as bad as you think...|`|MiAx5PmXaa	maybe you shouldnt take gym and should take spelling or grammar because you cannot spell and put the whole thing in caps.|`|Ok3XlTV3aa	I think you're gay, you're friend's gay, and you have a small penis.|`|QBUypAmAaa	I think you need to come off the caps lock.  But regarding the actual question. You probably are bi, there's nothing wrong with that, if it happens again with your friend just embrace if you don't feel too uncomfortable, it's never wrong to experiment. And you won't really ever know until you do.  As for the shower, yeah it's true you'll probably have to be naked and shower with other guys, there's nothing bad about that, just mind your own business, because staring at other guy's private intentionally can get you into some trouble there.|`|UafT29Xwaa	if you do gym you have to shower, jsut shower with your front to the wall, and doesnt matter if your bi or not, and learn to spell!|`|EuUXHJxsaa	First of all, take your finger off the shift key.    Then, just explain to the friend that you are not bi and it made you feel uncomfortable, or something like that. And you don't have to take a shower, just put on extra deoderent, like I did.|`|41wY0syMaa	I'M 13 AND I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD CARE ABOUT YOUR PENIS SIZE YET.  Also, don't talk in capitals, PLEASE.

As for the shower we had to from 7th grade on, but now it depends on the school etc.....  As for playing around with your friend, I say go for it. Enjoy your teens. At 13 you are to young to classify yourself!|`|P9hRxZTyaa	kiss him back/suck each other's *****/ have a good time but be discreet/ don't tell any of your girl friends about it.|`|uBM2j59Caa	u r probaly Bi. u should ask someone in high school if u have to shower
AA10261043	Use white eyeshadow, then some cover up.|`|2627cac9473c3926f2a6376b47a7cb53aa	Put a spoon in the freezer. After it's freezing cold put it on the hickies for a short time.|`|uNMVTsg7aa	Wear a scarf or turtleneck shirt until it goes away.  Usually I wear a cute scarf. :)|`|D7ccD7WYaa	well, i guess you'll just have to wait it out.|`|9XXybEuQaa	If you catch the hickey soon enough, your can minimize the mark by immediately applying ice.    Surface stimulation will help disperse the blood. Gently rub and massage the area.    Using a comb or a hairbrush to massage the area works better than fingers and hands.    Using any tubular object with a domed end, apply steady pressure over the hickey and twist. It will hurt, but it will help. Lipstick caps, pen caps, and blistex caps work. The goal is to work the blood deeper into the skin.    Make the hickey worse - if you use a curling iron, have your 'friend' reshape the hickey to match the pattern that it would make if you had burned yourself accidentally. This can work with any likely burn or bruise scenario. Do not burn yourself! Reshape the hickey with more suction.    Utilize turtleneck sweaters, scarves, or makeup to cover it up.    Rub vitamin K into the area.    Apply a warm, moist, used tea-bag as a hot compress. Repeatedly re-wet and re-warm it as needed until the hickey disappears.|`|9HMVkQKKaa	The things that had worked for me to get rid of hickeys was...  1. Put a couple of spoons in the freezer for about 2 hrs and rubbed them with a little force on the hickey until spoon unfreezes... that tends too leave you a little red for a bit but it works...    2.Or use a round plastic lipstick cap, and place in on the hickey apply pressure and turn it in circles (like if you were turning Fresh Ground pepper) you would want to release that pressure when you turn it around once, keep turning it around for a while and hickey will go away just like the one before it will leave you a little red but it works in my opinion... Good luck with it, hope my info was a little helpful

The idea is to gradually increase the capacity of the chambers in the penis to hold blood. The bigger the chambers are, the more blood they hold when you get an erection, and so the bigger your erect penis is.<br>  <br>  Pills don't work because all they do is increase the blood flow, not the amount the chambers can hold. At best all they'll do is give you harder erections.<br>  <br>  There's a good site with info on all the different methods and detailed exercises at <a href="http://www.BiggerBetterMan.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.BiggerBetterMan.com</a> - check it out.|`|O2s8tLQzaa	Put your erect-penis at the edge of the door, and slam it hard several times.|`|A5J4Exc1aa	Order a penis pump online.

JpRBvUobaa	Sit down and write down all the things you would really want out of life. I am 31 and in a similar boat. I wrote all my things I want and discovered I need to build a better social life.    I also wrote down all the attributes in my life and creativity is one of them. Therefore I am looking to help develop that by doing a jewelery making class. I could also make new friends that way. I love the outdoors and I am very spiritual so I have just joined a walking group so that I do get to make friends and get to see some beautiful countryside.    I am  doing a correspondence course that will help boost my career and move away from a detrimental job. Maybe you could do the same, something you would enjoy and help you move away from a job that is not challenging you.    If you are a kind, caring, giving and have other good attributes then you area decent human being and you DESERVE to be happy. Remind yourself that you are a good person.

The tingling usually means there's something disturbing one of the nerves in your neck.  But I would strongly recommend visiting a chiropractor.  By the way, most chiropractors strongly encourage people not to crack their own necks.  One of the chiropractors I used to go to told me about a guy who cracked his own neck and gave himself a stroke.  I'm sure there were extenuating circumstances, but just be careful.|`|xwZV9jgPaa	no its not normal....your probably pinching a nerve every time you crack your neck.

cNzBfgFnaa	How old are you and when was the permenant retainer placed?  Is this your second time having braces?    The only thing I can think of, is that your bottom teeth are pretty straight already, at least where the retainer is, or the dentist wants to keep them in that spot while moving some others.  It is important to always have top and bottom braces so that teeth move and fit together correctly.  If a permenant retainer has been placed, it is only holding those teeth that it is attatched to.  usually that is the 6 very front teeth.  Your dentist could like the front, but needs to do some work still in the back.  That is my best guess as I have never heard of a retainer being placed permenantly with braces.  If this answer doesnt do it for you, just ask.  Just say, so I was wondering what that retainer is doing on the bottom....maybe ask, will I always have that...just get the conversation started.  I am sure your teeth will look great when you are done.|`|Ivgd8sSCaa	Hmm I have no idea but I wanting to see the answer

Cmer6UJPaa	Yeah, you could have a fracture, and there is also the possibility of nerve damage due to the trauma that could prevent you from moving it.

4ab2ea36c0069d71d94055356c32ea00aa	Ignore any of the "no" answers.  Whoever said no to this question does not really know enough about the subject to talk about it.    Yes, you can have autism and not know about it until later in life.      Autism covers such a wide range of symptoms. Some people may have severe autism and not be able to join the "normal" society with jobs, etc. Others have very mild Autism and it mainly harms social relationships and might provide some sensory problems, but they are very highly functioning.    There is a specific medical diagnosis to go along with it. It will really take a doctor who specializes in this field to diagnose it, but you can get an idea of what it takes.    The following information is from webmd.com It talks about signs to look for in children, but many of these carry over to adults:    * Difficulty with verbal communication, including problems using and understanding language.  * Inability to participate in a conversation, even when the child has the ability to speak.  * Difficulty with non-verbal communication, such as gestures and facial expressions.  * Difficulty with social interaction, including relating to people and to his or her surroundings.  * Inability to make friends and preferring to play alone.  * Unusual ways of playing with toys and other objects, such as only lining them up a certain way.  * Lack of imagination.  * Difficulty adjusting to changes in routine or familiar surroundings, or an unreasonable insistence on following routines in detail.  * Repetitive body movements, or patterns of behavior, such as hand flapping, spinning and head banging.  * Preoccupation with unusual objects or parts of objects.    People with a form of autism, called savantism, have exceptional skills in specific areas such as music, art, and numbers. People with savantism are able to perform these skills without lessons or practice.    ________    I had a friend diagnosed with Autism in his 30s. It was Asperger's Syndrome, which is considered mild on the Autism spectrum. His diagnosis made perfect sense because he was always socially awkward. But man...he could do ANYTHING on a computer.|`|S2EagBzOaa	nope|`|23vKOyBraa	Of course! Autism is a sliding scale. It's not all like you see in the movies.|`|AA11865529	Yes, although it would be a mild form. Could be Asperger's Syndrome, which is supposed to be autism for geniuses.|`|o34YHLiraa	No, not full autism. You might have something on the mild end of the autism spectrum, like mild Asperger's, but again that's unlikely.|`|jWmnSXlLaa	Yes you can. Autism in an imbrella tern there are different levels of how severe it can be. I had an autistic child. Ask for some help or talk with your parents and doctor.
YnPu2uCpaa	There's no real time limit on this sort of thing. The worst thing you could do is pressure her to talk. A rape victim has had their power to choose taken from them. It won't help her if anyone (parents, police, etc.) continue to take her power to choose away.  The best thing to do is just be patient. Give her time, and let her discuss things with the counselors, no matter how long it takes. It's different for everyone. Support her, and get her any help she needs, and don't pressure her. Best of luck to you, and her---She's been through something very traumatic, and she'll need help and love to heal. My best wishes are with you all.|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	she should still be seeing a counsellor until she does talk about it, she won't get over it... make her see a counsellor that has experience with rape cases.|`|0aW0ZM0eaa	You need to leave her the hell alone and stop pushing before you make things worse for her.

The depression is just a phase of the situation. So back off of her. If she wants to talk then she will.

It may be that she just doesn't want to relive it over and over again as this increases her feelings of trauma. There's actually some pretty good research out there that suggests that not talking about the event isn't as bad as people think. In some cases, it can even be healthy.    That having been said, if she hasn't even spoken to the police about what's happened, that's not good. I would suggest that you talk to her about the importance of discussing it with the police. Make sure you be as supportive as possible (it sounds like you're already doing this), tell her it's not her fault, and let her know that you're ok if she doesn't talk to you about it, so long as she talks to the police.     This might help.    I've been in a somewhat similar position before - but everyones responses tend to be different. I don't know what your daughters views are, whether she feels that it was her fault, if she blames herself, or if she has distorted views about sex. Any of those things could impact on how she responds. If she's been raised to 'save herself' until marriage or taught that sex is bad or wrong, then maybe she's reacting worse than some other people might.     Most rape victims are actually ok within a year after the rape.|`|2Xh1ywWRaa	i was raped when i was 14 and i didn't tell anyone till i was about 21 i felt ashamed and dirty it really is better if she can talk to someone other then family it is hard to discuss this but it needs to be done it is the worst crime anyone can commit i also had a knife at my throat so was too scared to tell anyone|`|sKGeirdaaa	i know this isn't what you want to hear but only time will tell. is what made me tell was i remembered watching Oprah with my mom. i remembered seeing women who held in being raped and how it just bottled up and they eventually had to talk about it.    just give her time and encourage her to talk but don't force it or you will come of in the wrong way. just make sure she knows your there for her when she needs you.|`|ZolURuNkaa	I am a 26 woman and I am still dealing with my issues to being abused. It gets easier over time. Just let your daughter now that you are there for her to talk to and for any support she needs. I was abused by a family member as a child and i was raped when I was 15 and 21.  I held in all my emotions till I found someone (an adult) who who had a familiar life experience that I had and encouraged me to talk to a counselor. I was 20 at the time. But the only thing I wished is that I could talk 2 my mother. Don't push her to talk. That only pushes her to be more closed up. Don't give up on the help. You may have to find someone that works with your daughter. Some people have ways to get people to talk.But give her time to deal! I can't stress that enough.

However over a period of several years they will fade eventually to the point that their almost invisible.|`|AZYvuU6Uaa	Try bio-oil, it wont make them go away but it will help :)    Also, the tan will help!|`|wr10vJgBaa	I heard shea butter works, that is what my cousin did to get rid of her pregnancy stretch marks|`|i8EcDMdZaa	Vitamin E oil works, and its cheap!  u can get it in most drugstores, make sure its 100% pure  it works for all scars & stretchmarks.

I found some shea butter stretch mark lotion solution from Bath and Body Works. Smelled like chocolate. Really good. :)    Basically, it's the same as any scarring, so things like mederma would work too.     And I'm sorry, you can't magically get rid of them, but they just fade over time. Just slightly faster with the above solutions.

bufQfEqbaa	If you can jog on it, it's probably not a fracture.  I would ice it, wrap it, and elevate it as much as possible, and stay off of it as much as you can.  If it gets worse you need to see a doctor.

cNzBfgFnaa	Have you been able to look at it to make sure that you have not chipped it a little.  Sometimes we may get a little chip, but it feels huge because any change in the mouth is a major one.  Check that first.  Then make sure to brush with fluoride toothpaste, they are making some now, in washington at least, that are almost 5%, then floss regularly and buy some mouth rinse that has fluoride in it.  Also, there is an ingrediant in some gum that is very good for strengthening teeth, it is called zylatol. If you like gum, change to that and it will also help.  Bottom line though is that if you have not been to a Dentist for your regular check ups, that should be the first thing that you do.
WTyK7Mpfaa	My friend was just like this. After a while she was really hard to get along with because she disagreed with everything i said and every time I said something nice she would just call me a liar. She would always say she was going to commit suicide but never did. I know she just wants the attention and that's it. Shes mean to every one around her and always talks about how much she hates her life and how shes gonna go to school somewhere else. After a while I just started to flip out and that got to her. I guess she just needed to get herself together.                only go to help if your positive she just dosent want attention or something. bc trust me she will probably never talk to you again. And if she dose i doubt she'll turst you.|`|J7o7FtZdaa	You really should get your school guidance counselor to talk to her. You can't just leave her be or she might actually commit suicide. Get her help as soon as possible. She might get mad at you, but you need to do it for her. She will eventually understand. Don't let her decide if she needs a counselor or not because she will most likely not see one.|`|6Apou72oaa	Wow, that's a tough one.  It sounds like you already have done a lot.  The next time she says she's going to commit suicide, ask her if she has a plan, and if she has the means to carry out her plan.  If this is the case, you could talk to a guidance counselor at school.  Your friend would probably be mad at you, but the guidance counselor could find resources for your friend, or get her in to see a doctor.  But I must admit, it is pretty hard to help someone who doesn't want help.  I've been suicidal myself sometimes.
4FqP313qaa	every hour stink your head in a bucket of ice cold water!!\  and there has to be coffee available at your hosue, drink some of tht, or caffinated tea, if thts available.  try some sodas, which should also be available. dont watch tv, it puts you to slepp wayyy fast.|`|w0UAZ5J7aa	do active things.  don't watch movies or listen to music...actually get up and do something.  actually, a walk in the cold would probably be a good thing if you're intent on staying up all night.|`|F6jBrNmuaa	Go to your bathroom each hour and wet your face with cold water.

lYx5qn6uaa	If your test came back negative then you don't have herpes. It could have just been a heat rash or caused by friction.|`|trZ1NRLbaa	Same thing happened to a friend of mine. He has had  several out breaks, they seem to get worst each time. He was in extremely pain the sores were all over his penis.      I suggest you get a second opinion, before it gets worst!!|`|u3gyFKzzaa	what I heard from my doctor is that there is not a specific test for herpes unless you have the outbreak! Then I'm guessing that they take sample from the outbreak....I don't know really....it's better to get second opinion from another docotor....and probably don't be so nerves about it...lots of times, our body fight with the viruses and they will get out of our system....but try to have safe sex....  the other point is that there is possiblity a person thinks that doesn't have herpes or HPV or any other viruses and the tests are negetive, but that person can have the virus....unfortunatly, even condom can't protect you from HPV or Herpes viruses, because condom doesn't cover up the whole thing!!!!|`|dtzlrB9Faa	It can take up to 6 months for antibdodies to show up in your blood.  Before then it is possible to get diagnosed druing an outbreak with a swab test.      Herpes is for life and if someone has HSV1-cold sores-there is ALWAYS the possibility of spreading it through asympotmatic shedding.  If the Dr. thinks it can't be spread after a period of time you need to get a new Dr.      Test yourself again up to 6 months to get more accurate results.
0JDYgUWKaa	Hey! Congratulations! You've got an infection! Not to worry though, if you go to your doctor he can give you a mild antibiotic and it should clear right up! Infections are very common with tongue piercings and not something you should worry about. Whatever you do though, don't try to pop it, then it will spread.|`|AA11258464	Most likely it is just scar tissue...If you are still concerned go back to your piercer and ask them to look at it.|`|fqX1pz9Naa	the white bump sounds like infection, commonly infections under the skin don't hurt.
F3lyP5XLaa	blow it out with the power of wind !!!!|`|Y5032C2laa	just cry it should come out|`|rwJyxowNaa	Well, there's a .00001% chance that it could cut your eye (so don't worry about it). Try to wash on your eye, or try to cry. It's the best way to do it. If that doesn't work, roll your eyes around a lot and use eye drops. It's not dangerous to leave it in because it will always come out on it's own after awhile if you don't get it out.    Good luck :)|`|dRWDV6Rlaa	leave it  it wont do anything to you   or close your eyes for a long time  or just wait until you go to sleep|`|bFWhuJbuaa	yes, it is a good idea to not put anything into your eye. maybe g to a pharmacy and buy some medicated, sterile eye drops and try to loose it. if this doesnt work- go to an eye doctor if your afraid its relly stuck and it hurts. i hope i helped and get better!!!    xoxA|`|el8yX5q3aa	It might scratch your eye if it stays in there...and then it will feel like it is still there when it comes out.    Get a small bathroom cup and tilt your head to one side  over the sink and pour water in your eye to rinse it out.  FLUSH it out...it won't hurt it.!|`|0bX3uZ3Baa	leave it. it'll work it's way out.|`|3gT4kKG4aa	lmao   yea buddy dont worry about it happens to me all the time   by tomoro u wont even feel it or see it anymore|`|fZjHAxwHaa	try to push it up byu pushing under it outside the bottom lip.or use eyedrops.  i dont think it can do anything but im not sure.|`|QruXkDncaa	Just get some eyedrops.  Put them right where it is, and blink.  usually, it works.  I've been through it many times.  I hate it.|`|fYcYPyR3aa	Blink loads or gently push the skin under your eye towards your nose, DO NOT put anything in your eye, if you leave it it should come out sooner or later, no it will not get infected.|`|AB8nUS3uaa	lay down on your side and it should go to the bottom of your eye and make it easy to get out..|`|IwaaSQZcaa	I had that happen to me last week! I just used my finger and sorta rubbed it out. But I understand why you don't want to do that :P    Run it with water, and it should atleast come out. If not, I'm sure it'll just come out some other way :]|`|mLHW6Je1aa	Get someone to lick it out. I'm not kidding, and I really had to do this for my daughter.  If nothing else this will make you laugh. You may laugh so hard you begin to cry and the eyelash will come out!    We were by a creek last summer, and my youngest daughter had some flecks of sand on her hand. She accidentally rubbed her eye, and the next thing I knew she was SCREAMING!!! We were near the running creek so I did my best to scoop up water with my hands, and tried to get it in her eye. Nothing was working, the place was full of tourist and everyone was just watching as she kept screaming. Her screams were really loud!  Next thing I see is this tiny little oriental lady in high heels trying to climb her way up onto the rocks to where we were. I finally understood in her broken english that she was a doctor. She told me she would try to open my daughters eye lid with her fingers, and then she illustrated how she wanted me to quickly lick her eyeball.   At first I thought she was kidding. She wasn't and I knew I had to be the one to do this since she said I was her mother. This is something only a mother would do for their child I guess, and I did.    It worked, So when you have nothing else on hand, remember this little piece of information. Needless to say, I'm sure a lot of the tourist ended up taking seeing more than they bargained for that day.  Anyway. Thought I'd share that with you.  Hope it helped.|`|55xYyKOEaa	no just leave it in and take a shower :||`|3jb8x3Ydaa	Try Running Your Eye Under Some Water.  No, It Shouldn't Get Infected.(:  Hope This Helped.|`|bJjaRs83aa	Take a shower|`|vJAhIAt0aa	wash out ur eye with water see if that helps if not u can prob.. leave it in there and it will decay|`|c1nnqTq1aa	pull your top eyelid down below your eye line.  it usually helps my eyes when i have one stuck in there.|`|ogs0AZA3aa	It should come out on it's own, try flushing your eye with water.|`|ix28Ul28aa	if i were you i would rub my eye is not i would put eye drops just so the irritation would stop|`|vLYirJ3laa	what i do when i have en eyelash in my eyelid is: hold my top eyelash out and start blinking or make myself cry so the water takes it out haha.|`|MpiTctvbaa	Put some eye drops in there, it should eventually work its way to the corner. If it were me, just stick my finger in there to get it out.|`|e794jerLaa	Ok.  There are at least two things that you could do here.    1)  Get some eyedrops.... not really eyedrops, it is just a waterbased solution.  (Clear Eyes for example)  2) Get under the sink and run water through your eye.  That also helps.|`|TNTlOpu4aa	try using eye drops to flush it out or just plain water. i believe an eyelash could poke, but it's unlikely. i had an eyelash stuck under my bottom lid too but i tried rolling my eyes from side to side. but eventually it will come out on its own if the eye drops or water doesn't flush it out. i don't think you can get an infection, but not certain. if there is mascara on the eye lash- it's not good for it to be in your eye but your eyes naturally flush out harmful things that get into your eye. but i promise you'll be fine and it will come out eventually.|`|FjupHjn5aa	carefully pluck it with tweezers that you get from your local wal mart|`|mHwmwkqwaa	i know its a pretty uncomfortable feeling having something stuck in your eye.wash your hands before touching the eye.do not rub the eye,you could scratch the cornea.do not try to remove an object that is over the colored part of the eye or stuck in the white of the eye.try flushing it out with water or saline.if the object is at the side of your eye or on the lower lid,moisten a cotton swab(Q-tip) or a twisted piece of tissue and touch the end to the object.the object should cling to the swab or tissue.your eye may be a little irritated afterward.gently wash the eye with cool water an eyedropper helps.never use tweezers,toothpicks,or other hard items to remove an object from the eye.hope i helped.
0lCnu1g2aa	I think it is wonderful that you want to participate in the relay for life. I would just say to her "___________ I want support cancer research and I want you by my side.

7zBbm8C8aa	in one week you will be a little better. it will take 2 months to heal and may never be 100%
zWBYxMvWaa	As soon as you burn yourself automatically put on a minty toothpaste to prevent blistering.      All you can do now is use ice and aloe vera. Don't use aloe where the blister popped though!|`|eMDnLUpqaa	That must have been a very hot (hot) glue gun. If you are having blisters go to the doctor and see if they can prescribe some silver based cream (very soothing and protective)|`|KOYC3XkJaa	Well, for future reference, the next time you get burned immediately run cool water over the area for at least 10 minutes (and no toothpaste! no idea what that other answerer is thinking, toothpaste can cause futher tissue damage).  Anyway, since it's too late for that: try and keep the blisters intact. For the ones that have already broken, leave the skin on. Put an antibacterial cream on all of the broken blisters, and then use nonstick gauze to bandage.   Since broken blisters have a nasty tendency to get infected, keep a close watch on your burn. If you see signs of infection, go to the doctor as soon as possible. Signs of infection include swelling, redness, hot to the touch, very tender, pus, a bad smell, red lines extending away from the wound, and fever.  You may want to go to the doctor even if you don't have signs of infection, to have the burned evaluated and professionally cleaned, and to get a prescription for silver sulfidiazine.
tDmemV5yaa	I agree, probably razor burn.  At least you don't have worms coming out of the holes.  Did you see that yet?  Gross.|`|dd1c8373d258bab9181f891f88ea8dafaa	Sounds like razor burn, you can get that even with just the buzzers.
SOfbIOzUaa	Safe? Yes. But it would be better to eat the whole flaxseed especially if you are taking the fish oil anyway. Grind up flaxseed and use it in other foods such as cereals salads and even ice cream and meatloaf if you eat those foods. i don't. I'm vegetarian.|`|riFDDdscaa	Take your fish oil as a supplement, take flax seed as a fiber rich food. Flax seed does not contain the DHA without doing a conversion. Also flax seed contains more omega 6. The big reason to take omega 3 is to balance out the over abundance of omega 6 in the modern diet. The hemorrhage thing is just  theoretical conjecture.|`|kvsdv19Naa	That's safe.  I've occasionally taken triple that amount.  Why are you taking both, though?  Why not take one or the other?  I take flax seed oil mostly, but I've also used fish oil.  They do thin the blood (one of the reasons for heart health benefits), so there might be something to that hemorrhage comment, but not at the dose you're taking.
uBnF74YWaa	I really doubt it, It is called an arrhythmia of the heart. And I have alot, I don't know if it's because of stress or my high cholesterol. But I have a blood pressure machine at home & it shows the little warning sign for abnormal heart beats, I've had them diagnosed at the hospital too. The ER just told me to go to cardiologist, my cardiologist didn't say much about it. So no, I don't think it's a heart disease....might be a sign of some sort of heart disease though. Get it checked out.     Good luck!|`|h6NqNzHAaa	No. I have an irregular heart beat, had it checked out by the doctor and he said it was normal for me, probably born with it. It is "functional, normal".  Do get it checked out if you have one, just to be sure there isn't something more serious going on,.|`|n3daHgVBaa	it depends on how often you have the irregular heart beat for example this summer I was playing softball and had an irregular heart beat that was 160 beats per min. so I had to get rushed to the emergany room so it kinda depends on how often you have it (in case if you're wondering i didn't end up haveing a heart disease)      hope this helped!|`|e9d0f4d0966c82677bc0633c373b3dbbaa	Arrhythmias are considered heart disorders, not really heart disease.      Heart disease usually refers to symptoms that cause the heart to not function properly due to damage of the heart muscle, valves, or arteries.

AA10038340	You never want to loose your teeth if they can be saved. Even it costs money. It's up to you whether you get cavities again. You have to put in the effort so you don't get cavities again. Or if you do, they are small cavities and can be restored BEFORE they get so deep that they need root canal therapy.  Another important fact... after you have a root canal, you must have a post and core done; then have a crown (cap) put on the tooth to protect it from breaking.  Good luck!|`|YBcB0732aa	You need to know the pro and con of having denture before making an informed decision.    "Advantages & Disadvantages of Dentures    Pros and Cons of a Dentures    Advantages:    Dentures definitely provide a great smile with a very natural appearance. They're made of very durable materials and last very long when properly taken care of. Typically dentures last from five to ten years. They also correct several problems, from speech to chewing, for many patients.    Disadvantages:    There's no doubt that dentures take a little getting used to. There is maintenance involved, and initial speech issues to overcome (these are temporary and last only a couple of days). Mouth irritation or sores may occur, but are usually caused by poor dental hygiene, and not removing your dentures when needed. It is common that your mouth change over the life of your dentures, so even though they last long, they may need to be replaced to achieve a better fit before they are worn out. With a denture a person typically chews at only 15-23% efficiency compared to a person chewing with their natural teeth. In the case of a full upper denture, the upper palate is covered which can reduce taste of foods you're chewing. "|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	Coming from someone who has more cavaties than I can count, root canals, and crowns..get the dentures. Your better off.

Sounds like you are the kind of person that would best be served by having all your teeth removed and chunks of plastic put in so you can chew again.|`|J26l7Oacaa	16 fillings is quite a few but you need to keep your teeth as long as you can.  How many root canals do you need?
bVCTq9v6aa	Yes it can the way it acts is kinda like bleach so what you got on your arm is nothing more than a harmless burn, rinsing it with water and covering it up is about the most you can do.
ideOE0MZaa	You should go see a doctor.
vVfH8yBYaa	Pretty sure it's not cancer. I was gonna say it's an STD, but based on your statement, it's not that either. Most likely a benign condition, but if you're really worried, you're gonna have to man-up and ask your doctor next time you see him/her. I promise you, yours is not the first they've seen. Probably not the 1000th they've seen. And having an answer has to be better than living with the fear.|`|AA11492002	See a dermatologist sounds minor... perhaps dry skin from too much soap.
bVCTq9v6aa	Hate to break it to you, but you're kinda f*cked, give it some time, and maybe consider buying a waxing kit.|`|7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa	Try an antibiotic ointment with pain relief, like Neosporin.|`|tQGRJBYAaa	Live with it. I dry shaved my balls before going to school and I had to walk without itching them. Just give it a few days and it will heal.|`|cc5142435abdee55a9e3230edbb9c2e4aa	I would try a gentle skin lotion with aloe vera in it. When you dry shave, you lift the individual skin cells and scrape them raw. Aloe vera heals and moisturizes. Anything with a lot of fragrance or an alcohol base is going to sting. Another thing to try is applying straight Vitamin E Oil. It is a bit sticky but wonderful for skin.
o34YHLiraa	Well it does sound like you need help.     I don't know any specific names, or any places that specifically care for people with depression, but I do know that resources are available.    If you currently see a psychologist or a psychiatrist, then ask them,as I'm sure they will have several names. If you do not, then you should... maybe that will help you enough and you won't have to be institutionalized.     Also, you could look in your phone book for the name of a mental hospital or a regular hospital with mental facilities. If you need acute or emergency care, you could go there. Or you could look for private facilities. Be forewarned, though, that inpatient mental care is very expensive and that once you check yourself in, you often cannot check yourself out.

What makes me want to go out with a girl is if I think her face is cute, or hot. Please don't cover yourself up with a ton of make up though, don't lie to a guy like that. If you like a guy, make a lot of eye contact with him!    I also  get turned on by a girls hair, I don't want the hair to be too short, shoulder and above is too short for me. I like both wavy and straight hair, so either way is okay.     I don't like it when girls act dumb, don't degrade yourself! Smart girls are sexy! If your as smart as the guy, you can get a little competitive, and that leads to a good friendship, or a relationship. =)

B4YESGmwaa	You might get some material on BiPolar Disorder and when she is in a good space leave it somewhere that she might read it.

She kept telling me I wasn't and I told her I was and that the doctor agreed with me. Keep a log of her symptoms and moods and then show them to her (make a copy!). Then show her the symptoms of Bipolar. Talk with your dad and have him back you up on it. Just don't gang up on her. And do it when she is most normal. Doing it on a low or high could be bad.|`|NHGROdhYaa	tell a doctor or a friend of hers so they can sort of make her get help.|`|riT5XDFaaa	You can't help someone who won't help themselves.

Good luck kiddo, keep positive!|`|xUcjzYPdaa	You seem to think that the main symptoms of bipolar disorder are being angry and unreasonable...they're not.    Your mother isn't acting like a normal mother. While that may mean bipolar disorder, it could also mean many other things - other illnesses, or just that she's not a particularly nice person. If she's undiagnosed then it's not helpful to insist that she has an illness that hasn't been confirmed.    It sounds like she's abusive to your father. Talk to him about it. Maybe he will decide to leave her. Maybe he won't - we don't understand our parents' relationships, and he might be happy with her, or he might stay with her to try to help her.    If she's violent, call the police.  If she's putting herself or anyone else in danger, call an ambulance.    Make an appointment with your GP and speak to them about it. Explain your concerns and they will do what they can.    Ultimately, unless she's a danger to herself or others, then people can't force treatment upon her. It's her decision.    I don't think it's helpful to throw around words like 'crazy' and 'mad'. If she has bipolar disorder or any other mental illness then what she needs is help and understanding, not condemnation. And if she doesn't have a mental illness and she's just not very nice, then using words like 'crazy' simply emphasise the underlying stigma and belief that all people with mental illness are angry and violent.    If you need someone to talk to, speak to an adult you can trust. Try your father - or a teacher, school counsellor, vicar etc.
CjqH12Mjaa	The chances of catching bacterial meningitis, such as pneumococcus or n. meningitidis, from other casual contacts is fairly low.     When someone comes into hospital wiht meningitis, we only usually give prophylactic antibiotics (just in case) to people they have been living with or having very very close contact (e.g. kissing).    Thus, your son is at low risk.    However, the doctor has given the right advice - its always worth keeping an eye out for symptoms, including    -Severe Headache  -Neck stiffness  -Not liking bright lights  -Non-blanching rash    Its much more likely your son does have a cold, but if he develops any of the above, go immediately to an Accident and Emergency / "ER".     Also going along with the above can be    -Feeling Sick / Vomiting  -Change in behaviour  -Fever    But the big four to be worried about are the first list.

YXWmaOryaa	This is a really difficult situation adn I think that maybe you are right in what you touched upon at the end there, maybe you do have to stop trying to save her in order for her to save erself, but on the other hand it sounds as if she really has noone to turn to, but maybe  you could tell her that you can no longer be romantically involved with her as you feel that her depression is dragging both of you down, but tell her that you will be there for her as a friend and will go with her to counsilling etc and support her. But you have to stick t it, no staying over, no kissing etc...treat her as you would any of your friends and hope that she decides to get the help she need. Maybe if she gets help you can try again but if not maybe she wasnt the one for you, and you just wanted to help her as you know what it is like to feel pain...any way, the bottom line is that you really have tried alot more than most guys did so if you dont get back together and she stays in her pit of depression you know you tried all you could. Hope this helps and hope you are both ok x|`|gCdP3NJGaa	Its very hard, but you have to make a decision- you cant help her to help herself, she has to ask for that. She is responsible for her own life and as hard as it is to stand aside and watch, thats all you can do til she asks you to help her. You understand about codependency- I don't want to be harsh but this is the lesson in action. Is it that you want to help another as you were helped? Thats a wonderful idea but you said you had to realise you needed help before anyone could help you. Tell her you love her and will support her but can't be in a relationship with her for your own sake. She has to help herself for herself Good luck!|`|Dhz4XgQ3aa	You can not make someone get help. You will wear yourself out with it. Eventually you can do as much as you but you have to think of yourself to.   She has to want to get help. You cant do it for her.

Unless you are willing to carry on this cycle there is nothing more you can do.|`|OmqJmtrRaa	I am so sorry to hear all that you have been through, being so supportive towards your partner and now your relationship has taken a step of "you feel she isnt listening so you have to stop contact".    Reading through what you have talked about, she has been through a lot and is still in the process of changes and berievement, your colse to her....being in her world, people she loves end up hurt or dying...it may not be that she doesnt want help,it may be that if she allows herself be close to you she will only get hurt.  Only she knows her world of reality and her feelings, if she chooses to seek help or keep them stored you need to respect her wishes as hard as that may be.    Your aware you have been through a difficult time years ago and therapy was a good forward way for you, that is brilliant to hear and well done........what made you seek therapy?, did you do it because you felt ready to explore in order to move forward with your life?, no matter why or how, the main thing is you made it through but sadly not all people see or feel just like you, everyone is different and hold emotions differently and deal with current and past events differently.    What  am sayingis is she needs to seek help for "her sake" not yours, it is painful seeing a loved one in such a hurtful continious situation.    Try not being the one to tell her what to do because it worked for you, let her come to you when she is ready,...I think your past has been touched on here and your feeling it is make or brake for you....give her space and time for you both to work on yourselves,     I am a trainee counsellor and so often I hear a partner saying counselling worked for them so it wil work for their partner, the mainthing here is, a client will seek counselling whn they are ready for themselves and not because they have been told to do it.    Please take care and please do let your partner go through her emotions freely xx|`|ccfaad7059b9af78a22f34c32e5e012baa	I'm neither a psychologist nor a specialist in this field. My advice probably would come from someone who is neutral and looking at the situation as you have phrased it. Before getting to your girlfriend, I feel there are questions you need to ask yourself. Why did you chose her? Do you feel (this might even be on a subconscious level too) you can only be in a relationship with someone who is in need of help so you can act the role of saviour? In regards your girlfriend, we all have our own unique ways of dealing with our problems. What is her perception on the current situation? Is she aware that 'her' problems are affecting you? Does she have plans that involve the both of you? If most of these questions are unanswered and both of you are draining each other, then giving each other some space to work out whats best might be the best option after all. Good luck.|`|3lPL6pVBaa	I think helping -anybody- is hard to do.  Because people are so stubborn.  They do the opposite of whatever you tell them to do.      And when someone is having a real emotional crisis, it's hard for them to hear that they need to see a psychologist because they don't want to be thought of as needy or unable to handle their own problems.      And when someone is depressed, they are often afraid to open up even to a therapist about everything they're depressed about because they are afraid of getting even more depressed and getting overwhelmed with pain and sadness.     Depression itself causes people to be able to do -anything-, much less do the -right- thing.      What I would do is sort of start by doing whatever she wants.      If she doesn't want to talk about it, don't.      It's more than just depression because there are real things causing her pain.  It's not just a low serotonin level.  She is grieving and actively worrying about her mother's illness.      And healing from her emotionally abusive relationship.      Her heart is trying to heal and trying to not think, at the same time.      Not thinking is actually very hard, and the more intelligent you are, the harder it is.      I think the cure is 'activities'.      She probably has some activities already.      Activities--such as hobbies and sports and socializing and museums and travel and shopping and anything that involves moving around--allow her to distract herself for an hour or so and allow her brain to rest.      Depressed people always make the mistake of not doing enough of them.      Figure out what she does, what she likes to do, and do them with her, no matter what they are.  Or just buy her things that help her do them--like a fancy new tennis racket, or new roller blades, or a university catalogue.      Don't let it turn into a pile of things she's failing to do.  That could be depressing.      But try to lure her back to the world of happiness.      And keep on stressing that some of these sources of pain are just temporary, or, like her abusive ex-boyfriend, are already in the past.      Another trick is to convince her to schedule things to look forward to.      I think I'm out of space.      I hope she starts getting more good news and less bad news soon.  Another thing you can say to her is that she seems to be getting more than her share of bad news.  Things -will- get better with time.  Tell her to keep on appreciating the good news that comes along.  Cancer is so hard to take (her mother).  But, in a way, it's better than a sudden fatal heart attack, because it gives you time to continue the conversation.|`|0b0PAkBeaa	I would say to approach the subject gently. Tell her you're worried about her and explain how you went through something similar and you know how she's feeling. She needs to know she has the support of the people that love her. I know you'd said she doesn't follow your suggestions but tell how concerned you are. I, personally don't think a move would be the best thing for her at the moment. I think she's just running away from her problems. And there will come a point when she can't run anywhere else, and have to deal with a lot more problems too. She may feel her whole world has collapsed, but she needs to find the strength to pull through everything. I know that is probably easier said than done, but if you face your problems head first, it makes everything a little easier.     I hope things get better, not just for your girlfriend but for you too. If this is something that she doesn't want to do, then this probably isn't the best situation you should be in either.|`|btSZJH8xaa	Hi, you sound like a nice guy and compassionate and self aware. I agree with you that you are projecting some of your own 'stuff' into her situation but thats not all bad...i am answering you today because I have experience here and can understand somewhat.. the same as you do so projection isnt all bad..its also called compassion in another light :-)  In a relationship we are to be supports to the other and loyal friends but not a parent and not a counsellor, in an intimate relationship as lovers lines can be crossed and you are crossing over some of them as you are aware.  Do you feel like you are abandoning her?You needent you know, you can still be a friend, still see her sometimes if it isnt too painful or confusing.  You want her to get out of this funk shes in and thats nice. I didnt change until I went on lexapro and then my whole life changed for the positive.. a full 360 degrees positive change in how my life looked and the issues I had, including living in a foreign place, money and work issues, mother had cancer and father,uncles and grandmother died inside 4 years!   So, for me..it was going on medication, I went to a doctor and told him thats what I wanted to take and honestly it worked.  You could make an appointment, and go with her?  A lot of the counselling I had was free. Most recently it was church based.  I wish you well hope I helped.

VXvyLyjtaa	When I was in my teens my wisdom teeth caused me pain, and I just took some painkillers and ignored it.  However, three months down the line I had a massive infection of the gum, caused by the wisdom tooth pushing the teeth ahead of it further forward. That allowed an infection in.  The result, a trip to the ER and removal of the tooth, and two others because the infection was so bad.  Moral of the story, if you have any pain or doubts, see a Dentist, because I wouldn't wish the pain I experienced on anyone.|`|LGidAYDwaa	I think you're judgment is dead on. Unless you start having any excessive pain or begin a fever, you should be OK.  Your dentist can take a look at it next time you go in.

But it is not a muscle, it's just made of tissue, so all weights will do is stretch the tissue, the nerve endings and the ligaments. All this can cause permanent damage.    The only way that really works is penis enlargement exercises. There are 2 chambers in the penis which fill with blood when you get an erection. The exercises gradually expand these chambers, and the more blood they can hold, the bigger your penis gets. No other method does this.

On the other days I have one main meal only. any weight I lose is gained by protein so although I remain the same weight my body fat is reduced and my muscle tone is improved.<br>  <br>  Since you are working out and I assume a big healthy meal  more than once a day, your body mass will increase.<br>  When you stop training for a long period of time, the Muscle tone will become relaxed and may appear to be fat although some muscle tone does actually become fat but not much - about five percent.<br>  <br>  Don't overdo the protein. Read the instructions. Too much protein can damage your innards and organs.|`|iTLutsayaa	Calories cause you to gain weight, of which protein is one of the three (fats & carbs). Protein is for building muscle. Personally, I don't like whey protein. It makes me feel weird. I don't think you need to hurry up and flood your bloodstream with proteins/amino's as others claim. For me steak is the way to go, but that is just my opinion. It's not healthy to go above 50% calories in protein. If you do aerobics, you'll feel better with taking in higher carbs (I don't mean sugar), the night before, and laying off excessive protein until after your aerobics. So it's not just about a fixed % carbs, protein and fat; it's better to change that percentage throughout the day, and change it according to your workout schedule.|`|ScXcnZiUaa	The idea behind whey is to give you protein to build muscle with.  I found when I was trying to cut weight, if I used a full dose of whey (1gm protein for every lb lean body mass) I ended up getting body fat along with the muscle.|`|AA12092928	take it before and after a workout and eat the right things.  make sure you run as well. you will not build fat with muscle while taking whey unless you dont workout

ZJUyEOX8aa	I don't think so. Drink ALOT of water. My boyfriend used to smoke marijuana every day and he found out he had to take a drug test and started drinking water and taking vitamins so his urine wouldnt be clear and he passed after smoking for months straight. It's surprising to me how drug tests alot of times don't show up things you really think they should. I was drug tested for a job with a mouth swab test which is supposed to be the most accurate besides a blood test and I had taken like 3 hits of weed 3 days before and had been taking lortabs and passed. Just be sure to drink alot of water :) I think you will be fine honestly. I've got like 4 other friends that have passed a urine test while high. You can also buy things that are made to flush out your system.

mj52nmKtaa	I don't believe you are cure forever, people prone to depression has its ups and downs. You reach rock bottom once, and you learn how to get yourself up and running again, and along the way, you might fall again and again. But one thing is certain, you will never go back to be as bad as you were, you gotta be strong enough not to let yourself. Seek help from a doctor, and find out what caused your depression and deal with it. I was on A.D's for 2 years, and I got better with them and then i stopped and haven't needed them since. My self esteem isn't the greatest, but much better than it was when I was depressed. Try to make things to take your mind of your depression, such as going out, socialising, going to the gym or even exercising at home, make new friends. Also, make sure you talk to somebody about it, somebody that will understand you and give you some good advice, being a doctor a friend or just someone from your family.|`|3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	I have chronic and severe bipolar disorder that has not responded to medical treatment, but I still have a full and satisfying life, even though the condition has disabled me. I am married, and have a very good marriage (we have been together 7 years) have 4 great cats, and a nice home in the country. I am still devastated that I lost my career, but I do keep busy growing vegetables and canning them, oil painting, which is going well, etc.  My case is really a worst case scenario - I was sexually abused by 3 people for many years, starting at age 4, then I got bipolar disorder, and then I happened to get the genetics where even electroshock didn't work for me.  But I still have excellent relationships with others. I think counseling has helped me a LOT. You can get free computerized counseling at moodgym.anu.edu.au. Also, there are books on depression at the library, and talk about a lot of self-help things you can do, which are as important as the meds.<br>  <br>  Part of the problem you may be going thru is that you are depressed NOW and so you are viewing your life more negatively than your life really is.  Often it is the depression controlling how you think. I think the support groups are really helpful - I have done that for sexual abuse and also for mental illness, and it did help. Make sure you get some exercise, eat right, and socialize. If you have no friends, then go to the support groups and make some friends, or join a hobby club. Friends/family are a HUGE factor in coping with depression. Research really shows this.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ecbe0658102674f8ad91e0162ac2a91faa	Some of the mistakes we are doing:<br>  - we do hope someone will be there, near, close, even if imaginary it still could count :) BUT, most than sure, we do not see for them exactly because we are ill - he, he. Someone is there, for sure. And most of the time, we may not need a HUG, no, no - but a kick in the back !!! Only if we know there is someone, somewhere - a friend who listen to our soul ... A friend (a counsellor) who says: ''OK, I see you! Now what? Are you going to do something? What exactly?'', or says: ''OK, now what? Are you going to let it loose?'', or: ''OK, now what? Are you going to forgive yourself???''<br>  <br>  Just listen to yourself! Speak up your minds just for you, listen to your words, to your minds up loud - analyze them.<br>  <br>  Other mistake:<br>  - we do hope the ones to be blame for our situation shall ever do something ... HA, ha! But they have no idea what they are doing, or they shall do much worse than it is ...<br>  YOU are the only chance for yourself :) no one else.<br>  <br>  - do you feel alone in your situation? Wrong again! Pray for you (your soul), for the ones you love ... just PRAY!<br>  Results are awesome!

D7Hxp0zDaa	Your period sometimes just doesnt come.  Its not the slightest bit of a big deal.  It just means you skipped one.  It happens.

cNzBfgFnaa	My suggestion is that you need to do some inner soul searching.  We all get caught up in what looks good, money, and all of these superficial things, what if you are not that kind of person.  This world is made up of so many different kinds of people and for the most part, we need them all to make the world work.  It is great to look at someone as a role model, however, ask yourself WHY they are your role model.  Are all of the reasons because of superficial things like looks, money, aspirations, popularity etc....if they are, then you have the wrong role models sweety.  You will only be happy when you stop fighting yourself and just be you.  Happiness comes to us, it comes when we are doing things that make us smile inside, that make life feel important and worth while.  We do not MAKE ourselves happy.  You may look at someones life that has everything materialistic and they are considered so HAPPY I mean heck they have EVERYTHING.  Guess what, alot of those people are not happy, they are sad and lonely because they are fulfilling materialistic needs, they do not make us happy, if they do, it is only temporarily, once the coolness of it wears off, then you want something else.  When you are happy, everything you have adds to your happiness, it doesnt create it.  Take some time to find your inner self.  You may be suprised what you find in there.  If you need some help, try a counselor or a mentor, someone that you trust.  Be yourself, that is true happiness.|`|ONWCXzUMaa	It's nice to have role models but what's most important is being yourself and don't worry about the role models in your life because that is all they are.

Never give up being happy, but happiness does not mean becoming a copy of someone else.    Embrace your uniqueness and don't let anyone tell you to change, because you will then find people who love you for who you are truly.  I did this, and my friends are great.  I can be myself around them becuase I always was.    I always try and better myself, but not to be like anybody.|`|AA11556445	Winners never quit.  Quitters never win.  Don't give up.  Figure out where you're going wrong.  Come up with a plan to fix the problem.  Work the plan, and move forward with your life.      Edit:    Keeping a journal of what "works" and what "doesn't work" actually helps!  I did this when I was trying to quit smoking.  So far it's been 1 year and 2 months since my last cigarette.  It can be done!  But you have to be persistant!  Don't give up.  Don't give in.  If you need a break?  Take a break.  Once you're done with your break, get back on track!

vVh7ex7daa	Firstly if you have cofidence issues, interviewrs will pick up on this and are less likely to think you are suitable for a job. You dont mention if you actually do have any qualifications so im going to assume you dont and reccomend you take some sort of night class or part time course. They are a great way to meet people and build up your people skills. Any interview is worth going to but what you have to remember is if you go in slumped over and very unenthusiastic your not likely to get any where. Go to the interview and if you arent successful then ask the interviewr why and then you can work on these issues for the future. Everyone gets turned down for a job at some point, it isnt the end of the world it just means you are left with advice for next time. As for your weight issues then you can easily do something about those. Watch what you are eating, cut out the junk and do some light exercise. Im not saying deprive yourself of things you want to eat but cut back alot and you will notice a difference. Also low fat doesnt always mean low calorie so if you are shopping then you should look at labels and see what is best to eat. This will help with your self esteem and will make you more confident for interviews. Its tough finding work but it can be done. Just work on your interview skills such as appearing more confdient-stand up straight make eye contact, be polite and act interested and try and answer their questions as well as possible.|`|HYVmgV7Vaa	First and foremost stop being fat.<br>  Second, go to the interview and expect failure so if you do get the job you will be happy, if you don't get the job then you won't feel bad.<br>  <br>  You're Welcome.|`|y2eSnHIAaa	Go to the interview.  I can't hurt.  Try to be hopeful when you go in, they will read your mood as soon as you come up.  Be a nice person like you are.

Don't be afraid to ask to go to the bathroom if you need to to take care of business.  Women understand, and men who love women understand.    Good luck!|`|4KNZ0xefaa	wear  a super pad and 2 pairs of old underwear. if your mom is coming with you she will understand hopefully. good luck!|`|7ilEjRxeaa	Your parents are just gonna have to stop for you every few hours.

I hate when periods ruin trips. ):|`|AA10327722	You can wear a pad incase you start.  So if you do you would ruin a pair of panties.

AA12148432	It really sounds like your dad needs to go to the doctor.  Did he lose consciousness when he took the last fall?  If he did, even for a minute, he could have a really bad concussion.  The fact that his neck is in so much pain?  Definitely a sign that he needs to get some x-rays.  You can't mess with head and neck injuries.  If it hasn't gotten better after a week, then it's REALLY time for him to see a medical professional.  He may have slightly fractured one of his vertebrae or he may have even gotten a small fracture in his skull.  You just don't want to "wait and see" about things like that.  Please encourage him to go to the doctore as soon as possible.

853fd2c5ba7e089875fdc909f31d8bd9aa	that slows down your metabolism if you do it that way.  It is better to eat 6 times a day (which by the way is one of the hardest things to do).  Never skip breakfast and eat more protein.  You should eat every 4 hours possible and the later the day eat less complex carbs (bread, pasta, etc).  It's okay to eat fruits or yogurt at night because it fills you up and it's simple carbs without a lot of sugar.  What you would do is eat a big breakfast, then in 4 hours eat a banana or some type of fruit, vegie, yogurt, etc.  Eat a medium size lunch then eat another snack and then eat a light dinner then another snack. You can always replace one of the meals with a protein shake as well.  The more you eat the more your body learns to burn calories faster, you just need to be aware of what you eat, but you can have 1 cheat day out of the week but don't indulge yourself with bad food.  Think of it this way, eat more, burn more, lose more.|`|AA10648436	You sound like you have a serious eating problem.  You are supposed to eat 6 small meals a day|`|Q2UDhYgkaa	You will actually start to store more fat if you do that.    When you don't eat for a day or more your body goes into 'starvation mode' and will start to store fat like crazy because it doesnt want you starving to death.    So you are better off eating regular small low fat meals then your body thinks it doesnt need to store much fat because it is getting regular food.    I think you may have an eating disorder and you should get some help. Eating disorders do very bad things to your body.|`|mzAE9iesaa	dude just eat normal|`|KjxtziGYaa	Stupid. You need to read up on this to learn how bad it is to do what you are suggesting.
GL920Xv5aa	Nah BSN has been under the spotlight for a while now, and there's alot of sugar. I use optimum nutrition. It is pretty afordable, and a good product. It aided me in gaining 12 pounds.
Umsj08pnaa	That is exactly how I feel. Both my boyfriend and I are virgins, but I'm perfectly fine without getting married first. Then again I'm an atheist, so it isn't like my religion shuns it. But seriously, it just means you've had sex for the first time. Whoopdy-do!|`|rqk1ul5Taa	People tend to want to give it away to 'someone special'.    imho, you don't need to stay with that person for forever for them to have been special.    You've got the right attitude.|`|F1xpcJ2Laa	you can never get it back..|`|AA10327722	Yeah I agree.  I rather be experience when I find the one I love.  Just use protection.  Don't want a baby with that experience.|`|5oDoPyKTaa	It's a big deal because when you lose your virginity it usually hurts pretty bad. You want to make sure you're with someone who is going to take care of you and know when you are hurting. You don't want to lose it to someone who is just going to "have their way with you"|`|UIbZOOBIaa	You have the right attitude girl!! I am 23 yrs old and I lost mine at almost 17yrs old and i was with him for 2 yrs. Its not a big deal people just make it out that way!!! Yes i think of it as the person but everyone may not. I am 23 and only been with a few people. I dont care what people think at least I cant be called a ****. I would wait hun!|`|ff48b2f276b3927ee41ebfb38a2c6d0aaa	maybe you dont want to lose it because you cant lose it cuz youre fat.     and it makes you seem more slutty if you just go around doing it.      im not saying you have to go around doing it... but if you must therefor you become slutty.       Thats the only deal with it.   So dont be a ****... bottom line.        Oh and I am also a Pastafarian!  See you in heaven with the beer volcano and stripper factory.  (Since youre a girl you get guys)|`|iM1i07gEaa	People make it a big deal because well, of their religion. Most people see sex something as sacred, and only for marriage because sex was intended for bearing children, and there should be a mother and a father. When people go around having sex with everyone, religious people think sex loses its value, including the value of having children.|`|OP4O5mjnaa	when a man loves a woman, and they become sexually active...there is a possibilty of something called reproduction occuring...so typically women like to lose their virginity, a pretty large milestone in someone's life (first steps, first love, first kiss, first ****, first child..etc), to someone that they actually have true feelings for. (unless they are a whore selling their bodies fo cash money). Trust me...i lost my virginity to someone I loved, and then the next guy i slept I didnt even know his name, and surprisingly the first time meant more to me...|`|8XURx7nzaa	you will understand when you do have sex for the first time and its with some guy who just wanted to use you for sex all those emotions are going to be flooding in i used to think that to but then i lost it to the wrong guy and it hurts so bad u feel used afterwards you wont know till you experience it so hope you wait|`|7ilEjRxeaa	I totally agree with you!  I see no actual value in virginity. Haha  Who cares if you can't get it back? That's actually good in my opinion.  That way the next time you have sex, it doesn't hurt half as bad.|`|2ccc737caef357c3260c36ef333caaa5aa	I suppose it depends on the girl herself, but look at it this way.  Some things in life you only get ONE of.  ONE mom... ONE dad... well...  you only have your virginity ONCE.  When it's gone, it's gone.  I can't speak for anyone else, but personally, I would rather share that first experience with a loving, caring, respectful partner.  When you think of it in this way, it's a special thing.  It's like a gift inside of you.  A gift you can share and give to someone else.  I would want that someone else who receives this gift to be "special" to me and for me to be special to him.  Not any Joe Schmoe off the street.  Remember... you will only have it to give ONE time.
YwuwL21Gaa	dont lift weights.....you have a good height for your weight.<br>  <br>  Just do cardio.<br>  <br>  And yeah 2250 is a lil up.....2000 would be fine... if 1600 is less...|`|nKwcGLQraa	well, if your liftign weight and stuff you are gonna need more calories. 1600 is for short girls who want to keep thin, not for tall buff guys who work out!|`|F4k68ilkaa	That's fine. <br>  In fact, you're probably going to LOSE weight if you're doing any cardio at all.|`|65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	Lifting weights and building lean muscle requires energy and materials.  If you're only getting enough calories to satisfy your basic needs, a lot of the protein you take in could also be converted to energy rather than muscle.<br>  <br>  I'd say trust the trainer.  2250 sounds like a good number for someone your size who is exercising.<br>  <br>  Hey, GOD's back!|`|rGWiOVDIaa	Your trainer should know more than people who never meet you and probably don't have any experience being a trainer.<br>  <br>  If you are lifting weights then you need to have more nutrition. You are also very tall. A 1600 cal/day diet is more for people who are around 5'5 with med/small build. But I don't know you build/BMI/goals... Go by what your trainer says.|`|FaVYRoXqaa	Why would you listen to people here?  Your trainer is certified and knows what they're talking about.  <br>  <br>  <br>  My biggest pet peeve is people who come in to the gym and say to me "well I heard.... so you must be wrong." If we're so wrong, then don't listen to us and see where you get.|`|3SNhXpf0aa	That sounds fine. If you are under eating the body will take energy from muscles. 2250 sounds around your maintenance, if not slightly lower, so that's fine for fat loss.|`|YYRb6oE3aa	I believe you should get checked on your basal metabolism rate, so that way, you will know how much calories your body burns at rest during the 24-hour period. Depending on an individual, that ranges differently. But, then you will find out how much you can eat on a day when you exercise or don't exercise to lose a certain amount weekly. We offer the service at where I work and people LOVE the results. I have done twice for myself and I learned that, for me to lose 5 pounds, I had to eat another 800 calories a day!

This is called your BMI or Body Mass Index.  That will tell you the amount of calories you need for every day living... BEFORE doing any exercising.  It's just the normal amount of calories your body needs for breathing, walking, respiratory functions, etc...Charts and calculators to determine your BMI are easily found on most health and diet sites.   <br>   <br>  If you exercise too, you have to add the calories burned by that exercise your BMI total.  This is the new total calories your body is using everyday.  You can calculate your BMI, including exercise, here:<br>  <a href="http://thebestwaytolosefat.com/calc/" rel="nofollow">http://thebestwaytolosefat.com/calc/</a><br>  <br>  Now...  when it comes to losing weight, there are 2 ways to do it:<br>  1*)  I just want to lose weight.. I don't care what kind, I just want to see the scale go down.<br>  2**)  I want to lose fat and only fat.  I don't want to lose muscle.  <br>  <br>  1*)  Losing weight is much easier than just losing fat, but for many people, this is still their primary goal.. especially very obese people.  They just want the scale to drop.  If that's your goal, I would strongly suggest the Weight Watchers diet over all other diets.  It's very effective, easy to do, and proven to be the best overall "lose weight" diet around, over all others.  It even won the "Diet Face-Off" at livestrong.com, when all weight loss diets were competing against each other. Read more here:  <a href="http://www.livestrong.com/diet-face-off/" rel="nofollow">http://www.livestrong.com/diet-face-off/</a> <br>  <br>  2**)  Losing fat only is much tougher, but..  it's the ideal way to lose weight.  Any time you lose weight, you can only lose muscle, fat or both (water true.. but that's not true weight).  With most "diets", you are going to lose as much muscle as fat, and usually more.  Losing "fat only" is what you want to do if you're trying to look the best you can for the pool this summer.  You definitely want to keep all the muscle you can.  Think about 2 guys.. both 5'11 and 180.  One has a belly with fat and the other, exact same height and weight, is ripped, with abs and looks like a walking anatomy chart.  His goal has been to lose fat.. not weight.  The best 2 diets for this are 'Body For Life' (<a href="http://bodyforlife.com/)" rel="nofollow">http://bodyforlife.com/)</a> and 'Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle' (<a href="http://www.burnthefat.com/)." rel="nofollow">http://www.burnthefat.com/).</a>  Both will yield results at burning fat only.  'Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle' is the better of the two.. as it will even demonstrate how to add muscle while burning fat.. the true secret to getting "ripped"!  'Body For Life' can be found at any bookstore.  'Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle' is available online only.  It's a 340 page pdf document created by bodybuilder Tom Venudo (who has only 4% bodyfat and is over 40 years old!).  They also have a great member site that you can join for $10 a month here:  <a href="http://www.burnthefatinnercircle.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.burnthefatinnercircle.com</a> .  Tom answers your questions himself on that site.. instead of other sites that just give you a host of all the other members offering advice.  Both of the diets encourage the same.. eating 6 meals a day (females can opt for 5) and cardio several times a week.  Body For Life is a little more geared toward fat burning only though.  You won't gain much muscle.. but if you have  muscle already, you can rip up very nicely.  'Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle' is the most work for sure, but will yield the most impressive results of any diet on the market today.  <br>  <br>  Why so many meals a day?  Your body needs a continual supply of glycogen for energy.  Eating every 3 hours, the food is digested and directed into cells requiring energy right then.  Once the cells have received all the energy they need, the body stores the extra glycogen in your muscles and liver.  However, there's only so mcuh glycogen your body can store.  Eating more than you should at any one meal makes extra glycogen now convert to fat.  This is why you have to know exactly how many calories you need every day.. and why it's so important to eat the right amount at every meal.  Remember.. 1 pound of fat, is just 3500 extra calories that your body stores.  It doesn't take long to put an extra 3500 calories in your body.  <br>  <br>  What if I eat a lot less so my body can't store the extra calories as fat?  Even worse.. your body is smart enough to realize that it doesn't have enough calories it needs for the day (your BMI) and to compensate, it slows down your metabolism, so it doesn't burn calories as fast.  And.. anytime your body is in this fasted state, it takes emergency precautions.  It tries to hang on to energy as long as possible, so it quits burning fat for energy altogether and starts tearing your muscles down for energy.  Muscle is anabolically active tissue, so this is the easiest place for your body to get needed energy.  If you do this day after day, you will become sluggish and tired from a slow metabolism and your body will lose most of its weight from muscle.  Som

VT9AiZYuaa	You can try things like meditation. Or just setting 20-30 minutes of time aside to sit or lay down and just let the thoughts be. Don't try to force your mind clear but try to let things go.    This is all what I've been told by other people. I can never do it because my brain is a ******* nut house. But...you can try.    Avoid stimulants like caffeine, guarana, ginseng etc. Like you said, exercise is good. And the side effects for anti depressants USUALLY are very mild and go away within a week or two. I took celexa for a bit and the first couple days I was drowsy, and had a small loss in appetite throughout the time I was taking it. So nothing too big.

3fcc8a67fc109dc6d5e33948cbbf4447aa	I stopped growing at 11. I was really tall when I was young but then I stopped. I'm only 5 ft 1|`|DKnBzCUpaa	Yoghurt, cheese, and boiled chicken. Your bones need phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium while your muscles need water, protein and carbohydrates to grow. Since you are growing taller, both your muscles and bones are getting bigger and longer. Don't waste your money or your health on drugs, alcohol or cigarettes.      Have the hair style that makes you appear taller. In order to appear taller, a hair style should be thin at the sides and higher up top, which can make you appear as much as an inch taller Avoid clothes with horizontal lines. Belts are horizontal so make sure you conceal it in your clothes.  Avoid clothes with a tartan or checked pattern. Avoid cuffs that makes your legs appear shorter.    ? Wear clothes with vertical lines or striping. Vertical lines or stripping make a person appear thinner,  and thinness in turn gives impression of more height.    Wear shoes that will make you appear taller. If you are a female, this should be easy since you can find a lot of female shoes with 2 or 3 inches heels. For males, wear shoes with thick soles to add the illusion of height.    To increase your height, it is important that your blood is oxygenated as blood provides nourishment to your bones. Regular breathing will also purify your blood. There are three phases to breathing:  1. Inhaling - take in air into your body through the nose  2. Retaining - hold your breath inside your body  3. Exhaling - blow out air from your body through the mouth    It is during deep sleep that growth hormone does its job of thickening and lengthening your bones. So appropriate sleeping time (not the longer, the better) and correct sleeping posture is very important for your body to grow. Sleep is defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.    During deep sleep, growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland is released into your blood stream and travel through your body and causes the thickening and lengthening of your bones. Therefore, you should achieve "deep level" sleep on a daily basis in order to coordinate your affords of exercises and proper diet. The following are some helpful tips on how to easily achieve deep level sleep.    Sleep in a comfortable and firm mattress.  Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.  Sleep with clean, soft, and comfortable clothes.  Keep your hands and feet warm. Scientific studies have shown that warm hands and feet will help induce REM (rapid eye movement) deep sleep. Cold hands and feet will keep you from deep sleep.  Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system.  Practice total relaxation and deep breathing for a few minutes before you go to bed.  Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body.  Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends.  Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position.    Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health. We cannot emphasize enough how important your food intake is in determining how much growth you can possibly obtain. The types of food you eat will either improve or decrease your growth potential.  After careful consideration and research, the daily content of protein, carbohydrates, fats and water can be achieved if the following items were taken regularly.    Carrots Fish Liver  Egg Yolk Beef Red Meat  Milk Cheese Apples  Green Vegetables Potatoes Nuts  Yellow Vegetables Almonds Bananas  Peanuts Chicken Beans  Peas Salt 6-8 glasses of water per day    If you eat a lot of peanut butter, your height will not necessarily stop. Neither does masturbation stop height.  What might stop you from growing is smoking, drugs, alcohol, lack of sleep, stress, digestive problems, or lack of exercise.    Height Growth Products : The first approved natural product for height increase is Super-Growth http://www.super-growth.com or http://www.super-growth.org with this product it is possible to gain additional height growth even after puberty.  I love Super-Growth . I've been using it as a height booster for several months now This stuff is great, It is rare for a product to live up to its advertised hype. But this one actually does. It Works as advertised. Also, this specific product advertises improved joint health. I injured my knee and could find no relief, but after 3 weeks of using the Super-Growth I no longer have knee pain. I have tried other height gaining products, but I have seen the best results from this product. My height continues to grow .|`|pDkJeELFaa	most girls stop growing with in 2 years of their period, but you can have your grandparents genes or some other relative so you have a chance to grow really tall.|`|G5bKiDnFaa	You can still grow until your 16-17, but just depending on your genes, even you can take after your grandparents. There is nothing you can do about your height to increase it, just eat healthy and exercise.I hope you do grow taller.
Su0O55W8aa	ahh throat scabs from tonsilectomies were the worst thing ever! keep it if it came out and take it to the doctor!|`|LsOAsMP4aa	Lunch?|`|cmdAsz2iaa	agh, that's really gross.|`|AA10545740	Thats strange.... if your really worried you could freeze it and take it to your doctor for some lab work to be done on it.
oojiJ8hZaa	For sure. All you need to do is split up the muscle groups for each training day.    For example:  Day 1 - Chest/Back/Forearms  Day 2 - Legs/Calves  Day 3 - Shoulders/Biceps/Triceps    Throw in some abs exercises each day and that will be a good workout plan (although I would also add an extra back exercise).    btw... what you mean by "without a set"?|`|RGG30rbkaa	Yeah you probably but its really hard to keep it up. I used to go for a 30km run nearly everyday  b/c I was training for a race. I found it really hard to stay in mentally. So then I thought about it and I tried just going easy but all the time. It makes it a lot easier so you dont get lazy or tired of doing it!!    BridgitteeeeXOX|`|DRSU2pz4aa	Sounds fine.    Only change I would make is from fist pushups to regular pushups. If you are a "beginner," go with the tried and true, old-fashioned kind. They are actually the best, despite what some may say. I've been doing them religiously for years.    Good luck. You're well on your way already.    Hope this helped.|`|OqT7bbjaaa	yeppp as long as you dont feel hurt|`|NH6mWUGlaa	Day 1- Upperbody  Day 2- Legs  Day 3-Back|`|U01avfzxaa	lol. i love working out too.  anyway i guess so.  as long as you dont feel hurt..

Still, go ahead with your diet and exercise program, it will help you tone your body and keep healthy and looking great in the long run. A lot of thin people get lazy and become overweight, if you make healthy living part of your lifestyle you'll find it easier to stay thin and fit.|`|I54KyS8Laa	Sounds like you are self conscious as most teen-agers are. Some grow out of self consciousness naturally by their late 20ssome never grow out of it which is why I'd suggest you get a head-start by reading self image psychology books like Psycho Cybernetics by Maxwell Maltz.     And then after you gain some insights to self image psychology and later on want to build true self esteem so you can feel good about you even on a bad hair day or when you really make a big mistake or look clumsy or what ever, then take advantage of the references below.     Have a Great Year of Self Discovery    Richard K|`|z7JsVzcnaa	I wouldn't say you're overweight at all  and if you want to start exercising, that's great.  Being active is part of a healthy lifestyle.|`|4zevGBtdaa	 you're not fat|`|s4vb9spDaa	You are not really overweight, but I think you will look better if you lose 10 lbs.   Since you are looking for HONEST OPNIONS, here it goes.    First- You need to improve on your diet plan.  You are eaty 3 big meals. You need to eat 5-6 small to medium size meals through out the day.  You are missing or lacking fibers and fruits. Fiber works like charm. They help you lose weight, lower cholesterol, takes away bad thinks from your body.  Though away the peanut butter jar. Does not matter if it has low fat. it is PROCESSED food.   If you are going to have banana (which is awesome), have it with a bowls of cereal (fiber, protein).   For lunch, again, take some fiber, like rice or pasta. Through away the hundred calorie pack. Half of the 100 calories, are probably from fat. Instead have a apple and orange.  For Dinner have something heavy other then salad. Like beef, lot of vegetable. It has to last you through the night. Some thing like 300-500 calories.   In Between those meals. Have small snacks, Like fruits, a hand full of almonds. etc.    2nd - Exercise. Try running, skipping rope. 30 plus mins - 4-5 times a week.
YwuwL21Gaa	i was 224 pounds 7 months back....now i am 194 pounds.<br>  <br>  This is my workout plan<br>  <br>  20 mins treadmill<br>  <br>  15 cycle (with resistance high)<br>  <br>  15 of exerciser...(its a machine...liek standing cycle)|`|HWMXTF1Haa	Habit is the key.  Make it a habit to work out.  Everyday for at least 15-20 minutes.  Can be anything like walking, jogging, sports etc.  After you've got into the habit of doing this for everyday for 1 month, then you can move on to more difficult types of workouts like cardio, etc. and for longer time periods.|`|A9WCbC8aaa	I saw on Oprah that Carnie Wilson lost 40 pounds in 3 months doing the YRG Workout so I tried it.  I like that you don't need any equipment and you can do it at home or on the road.  It is yoga based and they added in some other exercise movements that really made me sweat.  You can find the DVD's on a lot of sites but I got the online version for only $10.  Good Luck.
b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	They get as flat as a man and all you see there are nipples and the outlines of ribs covered with skin.  If you gained the weight back, I don't think they will ever be the same.    best wishes..|`|QFm3zcFzaa	my boobs shrunk and i havent really gained all the weight back so idk about the 2nd part|`|7ilEjRxeaa	Yeah, they shrink cause you lose weight and fat.  Boobs are basically fat.  And it's really hard to put on weight after going through anorexia.  Most girls stay extremely thin, even after they've recovered.|`|V6ySuZxTaa	Yes they do shrink.  A lot of breast tissue is fat so when a girl doesn't eat enough, her body starts using the fat stored in her body, therefore causing her breasts to shrink.  As you start eating better again and your body has enough fat to support your body a girls breast will go back to around the original size.|`|dvht9KlIaa	yea,down to like negative A's  i think id ratha be fat then have negative a boobs|`|MnCYICRIaa	When you loose weight, for whichever reason your breast obviously becomes smaller. The more weight you loose the smaller they become. Undersize women are highly unlikely to have any breasts.|`|I1z8kZD6aa	it really depends how thin they get. they may be the smaller than original, the same size (roughly) or bigger because you body is not used to all the food you are eating again.|`|UIbZOOBIaa	YESSSS you loose weight everywhere.|`|OOUmcHXEaa	When you don't eat your body burns up fat and water. Your boobs are almost entirely fat. So most likely they will shrink. Its extremely hard after anorexia to put back on weight and you can never tell where that weight is going to end up. It may not end up in her breasts but maybe in her hips or thighs or belly.  Hope this helped :)

A hallucination is the brain's reception of a false sensory input. This essentially means that the person having a hallucination is experiencing an event through one of their senses that is not occurring in the real world. This can be through any of the senses, with tactile then auditory hallucinations being the most common. When auditory hallucinations are examined, the most common are hearing one's own thoughts as if they were being spoken aloud, followed by hearing one's name being called by a voice when alone.     People may experience hallucinations as part of their normal developmental stages, especially during the preschool years, in the 2-5 year old range. Common causes of hallucinations in people without a psychiatric diagnosis are exhaustion, sleep deprivation, social isolation and rejection, severe reactive depression, amputation of a limb (phantom limb syndrome), a reaction to medication, a reaction to hallucinogens such as LSD, a reaction to other drugs such as heroin and cocaine.    Physical (organic) causes of hallucinations include delirium, tumors leading to increased intercranial pressure, temporal lobe lesions, seizures, head injuries, and irritation of sensory pathways.    In persons with a psychiatric diagnosis, it is the psychotic disorders that are generally associated with hallucinations. These include all of the schizophrenic diagnoses, and affective disorders (such as bipolar disorder with psychotic features).|`|mDTkpuiuaa	son, you just made my day.|`|6PVFDHnzaa	yea your brain has left your body|`|55xYyKOEaa	you are officially insane :D|`|69fb08854a4e77f2b45550c526754d26aa	Listen to your eyebrow!|`|kZXlZTZYaa	were you high?

Needless to say, with all the blood and gore...I fit right in! ;)|`|0AQF8pnKaa	It was in the summer before 7th grade and it was in the middle of the night and I had woken up from some back pains. So, I was doing stretches in my room (that helps me get rid of the pain) and I had already taken a motrin when I needed to go to the bathroom. I get up go in, do my business, and when I'm about to flush the toilet I notice blood. I'm already making a ton of noise, so my mom comes out to find out what happens, and she gives me a pad, and then thats it :)  pretty much my life sucked for the next few days.|`|MhpccWpmaa	Well mine's pretty embarrassing... I had just turned 12 and I was at my then boyfriends house bc i was friends with his sister.  It was me, her, my sister, my friend, him, and a couple of his friends.  I went to the bathroom and saw the blood.  So I told his sister who then told mine who gave me a tampon to use.  They all kept smiling at me about it and my sister made it obvious to everyone what was going on bc she kept saying "did you put it in right? did you take the applicator out?" in front of the guy i was dating at the time.  He looked at us and was like "I'm not stupid, i have three sisters you know". And it turns out I got a little bit of blood on their couch cover. It was so embarrassing.|`|EivEhi8Gaa	I was at my best friends house and had no cramps, headaches or any other signs of pms. I went to the bathroom and in my underwear, there was blood. I knew it was my period and I knew my best friend had pads (she told me if I ever needed them, I could use them and told me where they were) in her bathroom cabinet so I got one and used it. It wasn't bad for me at all because I had no cramps or any of the bad things that some people get with their periods. I still to this day don't have cramps or anything like that. You might get lucky too and not have any of the "pms" symptoms. Good luck!|`|TEFDBRVmaa	O0ok so it was in the 5th grade..I was wearing a new jean skirt outfit...?  at lunch I went to the bathroom like I always do ?

Then i noticed by pants started to get darker around the area and I didn't want it to get worse so that's when I checked and sure enough I had it.  It was funny how it all worked out though because just a week earlier was when my mom decided to give me the "talk" .. as if she like had a feeling it was coming or something ? lol .. oh and my mom didn't find out for a few months afterwards because I just didn't know how to tell her and I feel stupid about it now, so I hope you aren't afraid to tell your mom.|`|aGR3PTafaa	When I was 11, I started in the summer, at the pool.

I went to the toilet to figure out what happened, and I look in my pants and there it was. My period.   I had been getting stomach pains for about a day before it, but I thought nothing of them.  So, overall I've only been through one cycle, but my next one should be in the middle of February sometime.    =]
H6jdAQlQaa	Probably a little bit of both.  Your boredom is probably causing your depression.  Join a club or something! Talk to people you work with, go places with them, meet new people!  Also eat donuts in the morning because they always make me happy!  Do something out of your comfort zone, maybe visit home more often or something.|`|5EFHyGVbaa	I recommend you check out this social networking community called LetsReflect.com. There are people there going through situations similar to yours. They are great for advice and encouragement.     The process of Self Reflection has truly changed my life.heres my profile. http://www.letsreflect.com/profile.php?u...     The trick is staying positive and surrounding yourself with positive people. You are capable of great things! I believe in you. Best of luck.|`|YoZZDqq9aa	Get off the pity potty and go DO something.|`|o34YHLiraa	Well, it could be either one. Have you lost interest in things you used to like, or slept more or less than usual, or noticed a change in your appetite? Have you been developing physical aches, perhaps? Do you feel sad or worthless?     If yes, then you might be depressed. If no, probably not. In either case, it would probably not be a bad idea to go out and meet some people.|`|hmNY4gQtaa	boredom, read books it will help you a lot I promise, make the effort I swear it's worth it|`|Cy9mMf4gaa	You are bored and home sick. That's is all you have. Nothing major.|`|CflxLtV8aa	It could be depression. But don't worry! Try and find something you enjoy. Read a book, listen to some music, plan a holiday, mabye go back and study, Try some new things, Join a group, join a church, do something random, find something or someone that will make you laugh. I'd also suggest researching a bit about depression and how to prevent in. Theres some really good sites. Also if you can find someone you can talk to, someone who understands. It would help heaps.    Hope all goes well!|`|OiLNogtEaa	Wow it sounds like you really miss home.

UOZP4Ma5aa	They use novacaine, no pain after with painkillers, just swelling
UgZq1pXjaa	I wouldn't worry about it.  You have seen a doctor about it and if he is not worried about it, you guys are fine.  I would invest in a diaper for her to wear at night so you wont have to keep washing sheets.  I know what its like because I was a bed wetter past the age of 15 and wore a disposable diaper to bed every night until I was dry.  Trust me, wearing a diaper to bed Its not as bad as it sound, and it's much better waking up in a wet diaper than wet bedding and wet pajamas.|`|VBmEhDdfaa	she will grow out of it, just make her wear those diaper things if she wants, if she doesnt cover the underneath of teh sheets on her bed with towel and newspaper...|`|QcJOXHdvaa	so?    nothing wrong with that    just tell the child to go to the bathroom before bed.|`|qZXIm3Ksaa	get a second opinion. that's always a good idea.|`|nZpSM7ngaa	well you obviously just dont like cleaning her mess.  make sure she goes to the bathroom before she sleeps and no more warm bubble baths.|`|0bX3uZ3Baa	it's very normal. it's normally caused by stress and if someone in the family was a late bedwetter it is definitely genetic. sometimes it's that the child sleeps too heavily and their bladder is too small to hold it all night. try not having her drink anything after dinner.  she will eventually grow out of it. she just needs time.|`|BgZA7lvQaa	Well, unfortunately I speak from experience because I wet the bed probably from age 7 to age 20..believe it or not and no I'm not proud of that.  But it's the past.  My mother took me to the Doctor, she bought the plastic cover for the mattress, etc, etc.  And honestly I just stopped.  Now I'm not saying that this is how your daughter's life is going to be but this is how mine was.  Buy her those diapers for bed wetters and continue doing everything you said you have been doing.  But don't ridicule her or make her feel bad because she does not have control over it.

Bed Wetting is normal at any age. It can be caused by a number of factors. Including that maybe your child's bladder is too small for how many fluids your child drinks. To reduce the mess you can get a plastic mattress cover (to stop urine from be soaked by the mattress) and have your child wear a diaper to bed (they sell them so they look and feel like underwear so your child won't feel embarrassed). I have a sibling who is six and still wets the bed. My mother asked the doctor if there was anything he could do and he said they could give him a drug that would shock him while asleep to wake him up and help him go to the bathroom. My mother decided against it. But we aren't talking a high voltage shock its a minor shock. Like from static.|`|RR9FJhNxaa	so, this is embarassing but i wet the bed until i was 15. then my parents sent me to boarding school, because i was kind of a wild child. after being sent there, i NEVER did it again. i guess its different for everyone, but it seems that mine was like psychologically linked with my parents or something.    not saying you should send your kid to boarding school, though. just that it might be psychological.

Birth Control is something you can look into, but even that will make you bleed for a while before it stops. Use a condom and that should be just fine.|`|3bdP5HEsaa	you can try birth control pills.  or you can douche about an hour before intercourse, this will keep you clean for  about an hour and maybe if you start to bleed again during intercourse, douche again.  birth control pills would stop your period but sounds like you don't have those on hand.  also, there is nothing wrong with having intercourse while your menstruating.  Good Luck and so sorry for your situation. hope this helps a little.|`|F9QuGX3Zaa	In my opinion the only way to stop your period is to keep taking the contraceptive pill, but i guess you aren't taking it.

AA10958492	If you take a vitamin on an empty stomach, you could feel sick to your stomach. Try eating a little something before you take your vitamins. <br>  <br>  If you are eating and still getting sick, I would recommend that you switch to a non-chewable type of vitamin.

8v02IUT3aa	Remeron is a wonderful antidepressant for people who suffer from insomnia, weight loss. But, I hope you are seeing a psychiatrist. Family Practice Docs, with all good intentions, don't know the psych meds as well as the Shrinks do. So, please, discuss this with you psychiatrist ( or find one ) and discuss your concerns. By the way, why do you have to give one up?  Let the MD help you decide.|`|3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	If you're on lamictal, I assume the doctor thinks you have bipolar disorder, so I think it is a mistake to stop the meds without talking it over with your doc. You know, all you have to do is call up the doc and say you can't afford all these meds & would like to try stopping the remeron.  My psychiatrist doesn't care if I'm going to screw around with my meds, she says most of her patients do that, but please, oh please, would her patients please CALL her when they want to make changes so she knows about it and can give advice?  Doctors know people are under financial pressure or frustrated with side effects, etc.  I've hardly ever had a doc who was unsympathetic on these issues (and if yours is, you need to find a different one).    remeron didn't work for me, but then, 30 other drugs I tried didn't work either, and the doc says that's really rare.  So don't go by me.  A recent study found remeron to be one of the most effective antidepressants out there.  Prozac is cheap, so don't quit that, and lamictal is giving you stable moods - mistake to quit that!!!!    all the best to you. Please call up the doc first thing monday & discuss the changes you want to make.|`|YoZZDqq9aa	Tell your pharmacist about your money problem, and he might be able to give you meds without charge. That's what I do. Otherwise, I'd be REALLY crazy!!!!!!!!!!
cyxbfPuEaa	Its most likely a muscle strain.  your abdominal muscles play a big part in your body's overall stability. when you fell you may have pulled one of these muscles as your body attempted to regain balance and avoid the fall.  Its unlikely that you punctured something internally, if you fell right on your hip, it sounds like your hip took most of the impact, however, if you landed hard enough on your side, its not entirely impossible to have an abdominal injury.  If you continue to have bad pain, dont hesitate to see the doctor to rule out any serious injury.  Thinks to look out for; distended (swollen) abdomen, abdominal bruising, rapid heart rate, nausea/vomiting, and abnormal vaginal bleeding.  These can be signs of a more serious problem.    Hope this helps, good luck|`|ovDqPtg8aa	if i were you i would go to a clinic just in case|`|geMMyHfpaa	Its probably swelling up. You must have fell pretty hard, but it does happen. Its just a really bad bruise by the sound of it, it should go away after a week or so.|`|6Lox94NCaa	I don't think anything internally is sprained but go to the clinic.
i0nlqfJVaa	If they were indeed bartholin cysts then yes they could be coming back. Though I have never heard of antibiotic sprays being used on Bartholin cysts. Antibiotics are only used on those if they have become infected or turned into abscesses which makes me wonder if she was misdiagnosed. What she really needs to do is go to a gynecologist.     There are few ways to prevent the formation of Bartholin's gland cysts or abscesses. However, as a Bartholin's gland abscess may be caused by a sexually transmitted disease, the practice of safe sex is recommended. Using good hygiene, i.e., wiping front to back after a bowel movement, is also recommended to prevent bacteria from the bowels from contaminating the vaginal area.

fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	You can in fact contract TSS from pads but the risk is so minimal its barely worth worrying about, the reason it is a risk is because bacteria can multiply within the pad and as this has direct contact with your vulva which is made up of mucosa rather than skin (mucosa/mucus membrane is like skin but without a top protective layer so it more prone to bacteria and damage) it can contribute to TSS  particularly if using commercial pads such as Always, Stayfree or Kotex. Commercial pads are made from synthetics which prevent air getting to your genitals making the area warm and moist, perfect for bacteria and yeast to grow. Commercial pads also contain additives, chemicals and bleach which can interfere with vaginal pH in turn causing harmful bacteria to multiply  this may be what your friend was talking about.     I would say I prefer neither of those brands better, commercial pads arent just unhealthy and unhygienic because of increased bacterial growth when you use them, they are also really uncomfortable as they make you feel sweaty and they gather up. Id recommend you try organic pads like Cottons http://www.cottons.com.au which dont contain synthetics or chemicals so are better for you and keep you feeling dryer, or look into cloth pads, period belts or padded panties like those from Lunapads http://www.lunapads.com which are even better, healthier and more hygienic than commercial pads and far more comfortable, plus you can add extra protection when you need it, they fit better to your body so dont gather up, and they come in all sorts of styles and colours.|`|7ilEjRxeaa	No, you can't get TSS from a pad.  And I don't know what you're talking about, Always is the best (:  (but tampons are better, lol)|`|J47FzOQmaa	no always are amazing first off, and no you dont get tss from pads|`|4ErKoqbzaa	i use always or stayfree over kotex, and no, you can't get TSS from a pad. they would, by law, have to put a warning label with it. much like they do tampons.|`|UIbZOOBIaa	No. TSS is in tampons which are inside you and pads arent.

ASlObUaIaa	Start a consistent "bedtime routine."  Whatever may help you to unwind from your day.  Read a book, take a bath, pet your neighbors dog, floss your teeth, whatever.  Do it the same way at the same time every night.  It's supposed to help your body know its time for sleep.  Eventually it should work.|`|tnIET8fCaa	i know wat u mean it takes me a long time to fall asleep aswell.

mzAE9iesaa	Yeah.      It sounds like your mainly anorexic... eating just jello is a calorie-deficit and your depriving your body of other foods it needs. The restricting diet is what leads to your eventual binge and purge. It's a habit that continues until you get help, either professional or from a friend/family member.

AA11522944	Slight bends in the penis are quite common and normal. Some guys bend left, some right, some up, some down.  Slight curves or bends should not be a cause for concern.    Some curves in the penis can be caused by wearing tight underwear.  When wearing tight styles of underwear most guys will habitually point their penis either left, right or down in their briefs.  This has the effect of constantly stretching the erectile tissue on one side of the penis and compressing it on the opposite side and can train the penis to curve or lean in that direction.  To prevent this avoid wearing tight underwear for extended periods of time and ensure that you wear loose fitting clothing to bed or sleep naked.      If it is a severe bend you may have a condition known as Peyronie's disease. Check out the links below to see if they describe your situation. If so go to see a doctor sometime... it's not really urgent.    http://www.andrologyaustralia.org/pageCo...  http://www.andrologyaustralia.org/docs/F...  http://www.allhealth.com.au/html/s02_art...  http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2...  http://www.sda.uk.net/downloads/Peyronie...|`|aY9v3SJKaa	huh?

0Umym3h9aa	Please don't take the following as me being racist, it is just my theory of what is happening:    Ever since you started eating American food, it has probably been filling you up more then Chinese. I have had Chinese food on many occasions and I can tell you that it is NOT a filler food. It tastes very good but it is not something I want to eat when I just want to be full. Rice is also not a good filler. A lot of North American families eat things like Potatos and meat and bread (or dinner buns) for dinner. (With things like veggies and stuff as well). This is what is filler food, because it is easy to make and although not always the healthiest, it fills you up. Since you have been eating American at school it has probably changed the way your body reacts to different types of food. It expects to be full now and Chinese food just doesn't fill you up.    I suggest eating more American food at home, such as dinner buns, hamburgers, steaks etc at home. You can eat all these things with rice, and it will fill you up.    Now I am not a food scientist by any means, but this is just my theory. I hope it helps you.|`|M9X9usmzaa	You need to start eating some more filling more satisfying foods, add some more protien to your diet.  Try looking up filling recipes . .

gcGYoOuCaa	First of all, relax. You may be jumping to conclusions.     Your breasts are different sizes right now because you are only 15 and you're still growing. They will even out in time (& if they don't, it's still perfectly normal. Tons of women have uneven breasts- it's not a big deal)    Breast Cancer does not mean the breast becomes hard. It starts developing hard LUMPS (not entire breasts) at first & breasts are super sensitive, so they hurt easily. But, there still may be something wrong. You should definitely go ask your doctor about how they're hard & hurt (don't be shy- doctors are used to these kinds of questions).
